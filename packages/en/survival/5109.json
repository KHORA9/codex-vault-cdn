The earth. What part of the earth? The latest\r\nformations, of course. We live upon the top of a mighty series of\r\nstratified rocks, laid down in the water of ancient seas and lakes,\r\nduring incalculable ages, said, by geologists, to be from _ten to\r\ntwenty miles in thickness_.\r\n\r\nThink of that! Rock piled over rock, from the primeval granite\r\nupward, to a height _four times greater than our highest mountains_,\r\nand every rock stratified like the leaves of a book; and every leaf\r\ncontaining the records of an intensely interesting history,\r\nillustrated with engravings, in the shape of fossils, of all forms of\r\nlife, from the primordial cell up to the bones of man and his\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nBut it is not with the pages of this sublime volume\r\n\r\n{p. 2}\r\n\r\nwe have to deal in this book. It is with a vastly different but\r\nequally wonderful formation.\r\n\r\nUpon the top of the last of this series of stratified rocks we find\r\nTHE DRIFT.\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nGo out with me where yonder men are digging a well. Let us observe\r\nthe material they are casting out.\r\n\r\nFirst they penetrate through a few inches or a foot or two of surface\r\nsoil; then they enter a vast deposit of sand, gravel, and clay. It\r\nmay be fifty, one hundred, five hundred, eight hundred feet, before\r\nthey reach the stratified rocks on which this drift rests. It covers\r\nwhole continents. It is our earth. It makes the basis of our soils;\r\nour railroads cut their way through it; our carriages drive over it;\r\nour cities are built upon it; our crops are derived from it; the\r\nwater we drink percolates through it; on it we live, love, marry,\r\nraise children, think, dream, and die; and in the bosom of it we will\r\nbe buried.\r\n\r\nWhere did it come from?\r\n\r\nThat is what I propose to discuss with you in this work,--if you will\r\nhave the patience to follow me.\r\n\r\nSo far as possible, [as I shall in all cases speak by the voices of\r\nothers] I shall summon my witnesses that you may cross-examine them.\r\nI shall try, to the best of my ability, to buttress every opinion\r\nwith adequate proofs. If I do not convince, I hope at least to\r\ninterest you.\r\n\r\nAnd to begin: let us understand what the Drift _is_, before we\r\nproceed to discuss its origin.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is mainly unstratified; its lower formation is\r\naltogether so. There may be clearly defined strata here and there in\r\nit, but they are such as a tempest might make, working in a\r\ndust-heap: picking up a patch here and laying it upon another there.\r\nBut there\r\n\r\n{p. 3}\r\n\r\nare no continuous layers reaching over any large extent of country.\r\n\r\nSometimes the material has been subsequently worked over by rivers,\r\nand been distributed over limited areas in strata, as in and around\r\nthe beds of streams.\r\n\r\nBut in the lower, older, and first-laid-down portion of the Drift,\r\ncalled in Scotland \"the till,\" and in other countries \"the hard-pan,\"\r\nthere is a total absence of stratification.\r\n\r\nJames Geikie says:\r\n\r\n\"In describing the till, I remarked that the irregular manner in\r\nwhich the stones were scattered through that deposit imparted to it a\r\nconfused and tumultuous appearance. The clay does not arrange itself\r\nin layers or beds, but is distinctly unstratified.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"The material consisted of earth, gravel, and stones, and also in\r\nsome places broken trunks or branches of trees. Part of it was\r\ndeposited in a pell-mell or unstratified condition during the\r\nprogress of the period, and part either stratified or unstratified in\r\nthe opening part of the next period when the ice melted.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\"The unstratified drift may be described as a heterogeneous mass of\r\nclay, with sand and gravel in varying proportions, inclosing the\r\ntransported fragments of rock, of all dimensions, partially rounded\r\nor worn into wedge-shaped forms, and generally with surfaces furrowed\r\nor scratched, the whole material looking as if it had been scraped\r\ntogether.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe \"till\" of Scotland is \"spread in broad but somewhat ragged\r\nsheets\" through the Lowlands, \"continuous across wide tracts,\" while\r\nin the Highland and upland districts it is confined principally to\r\nthe valleys.[4]\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 21.\r\n\r\n2. Dana's \"Text-Book,\" p. 220.\r\n\r\n3. \"American Cyclopædia,\" vol. vi, p. 111.\r\n\r\n4. \"Great Ice Age,\" Geikie, p. 6.]\r\n\r\n{p. 4}\r\n\r\n\"The lowest member is invariably a tough, stony clay, called 'till'\r\nor 'hard-pan.' Throughout wide districts stony clay alone occurs.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"It is hard to say whether the till consists more of stones or of\r\nclay.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThis \"till,\" this first deposit, will be found to be the strangest\r\nand most interesting.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, although the Drift is found on the earth, it is\r\nunfossiliferous. That is to say, it contains no traces of\r\npre-existent or contemporaneous life.\r\n\r\nThis, when we consider it, is an extraordinary fact:\r\n\r\nWhere on the face of this life-marked earth could such a mass of\r\nmaterial be gathered up, and not contain any evidences of life? It is\r\nas if one were to say that he had collected the _detritus_ of a great\r\ncity, and that it showed no marks of man's life or works.\r\n\r\n\"I would reiterate,\" says Geikie,[3] \"that nearly all the Scotch\r\nshell-bearing beds belong to the _very close of the glacial_ period;\r\nonly in one or two places have shells ever been obtained, with\r\ncertainty, from a bed in the true till of Scotland. They occur here\r\nand there in bowlder-clay, and underneath bowlder-clay, in maritime\r\ndistricts; but this clay, as I have shown, is more recent than the\r\ntill--fact, rests upon its eroded surface.\"\r\n\r\n\"The lower bed of the drift is entirely destitute of organic\r\nremains.\"[4]\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell tells us that even the stratified drift is usually\r\ndevoid of fossils:\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be the cause, the fact is certain that over large areas\r\nin Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, I might add throughout the northern\r\nhemisphere, on both sides of the Atlantic, the stratified drift of\r\nthe glacial period is very commonly devoid of fossils.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[1. \"Great Ice Age,\" Geikie, p. 7.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 9.\r\n\r\n3. Ibid., p. 342.\r\n\r\n4. Rev. O. Fisher, quoted in \"The World before the Deluge,\" p. 461.\r\n\r\n5. \"Antiquity of Man,\" third edition, p. 268.]\r\n\r\n{p. 5}\r\n\r\nIn the next place, this \"till\" differs from the rest of the Drift in\r\nits exceeding hardness:\r\n\r\n\"This till is so tough that engineers would much rather excavate the\r\nmost obdurate rocks than attempt to remove it from their path. Hard\r\nrocks are more or less easily assailable with gunpowder, and the\r\nnumerous joints and fissures by which they are traversed enable the\r\nworkmen to wedge them out often in considerable lumps. But till has\r\nneither crack nor joint; it will not blast, and to pick it to pieces\r\nis a very slow and laborious process. Should streaks of sand\r\npenetrate it, water will readily soak through, and large masses will\r\nthen run or collapse, as soon as an opening is made into it.\"\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n           TILL OVERLAID WITH BOWLDER-CLAY, RIVER STINCHAR.\r\n    _r_, Rock; _t_, Till; _g_, Bowlder-Clay; _x_, Fine Gravel, etc.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cut shows the manner in which it is distributed, and\r\nits relations to the other deposits of the Drift.\r\n\r\nIn this \"till\" or \"hard-pan\" are found some strange and\r\ncharacteristic stones. They are bowlders, not water-worn, not\r\nrounded, as by the action of waves, and yet not angular--for every\r\npoint and projection has been ground off. They are not very large,\r\nand they differ in this and other respects from the bowlders found in\r\nthe other portions of the Drift. These stones in the \"till\" are\r\nalways striated--that is, cut by deep lines or grooves, usually\r\nrunning lengthwise, or parallel to their longest diameter. The cut on\r\nthe following page represents one of them.\r\n\r\n{p. 6}\r\n\r\nAbove this clay is a deposit resembling it, and yet differing from\r\nit, called the \"bowlder-clay.\" This is not so tough or hard. The\r\nbowlders in it are larger and more angular-sometimes they are of\r\nimmense size; one at\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n            SCRATCHED STONE (BLACK SHALE), FROM THE TILL.\r\n\r\nBradford, Massachusetts, is estimated to weigh 4,500,000 pounds. Many\r\non Cape Cod are twenty feet in diameter. One at Whitingham, Vermont,\r\nis forty-three feet long by thirty feet high, or 40,000 cubic feet in\r\nbulk. In some\r\n\r\n{p. 7}\r\n\r\ncases no rocks of the same material are found within two hundred\r\nmiles.[1]\r\n\r\nThese two formations--the \"till\" and the \"bowlder-clay\"--sometimes\r\npass into each other by insensible degrees. At other times the\r\ndistinction is marked. Some of the stones in the bowlder-clay are\r\nfurrowed or striated, but a large part of them are not; while in the\r\n\"till\" _the stone not striated is the rare exception_.\r\n\r\nAbove this bowlder-clay we find sometimes beds of loose gravel, sand,\r\nand stones, mixed with the remains of man and other animals. These\r\nhave all the appearance of being later in their deposition, and of\r\nhaving been worked over by the action of water and ice.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is, briefly stated, the condition of the Drift.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that it was the result of violent action of some kind.\r\n\r\nAnd this action must have taken place upon an unparalleled and\r\ncontinental scale. One writer describes it as,\r\n\r\n\"A remarkable and stupendous period--a period so startling that it\r\nmight justly be accepted with hesitation, were not the conception\r\nunavoidable before a series of facts as extraordinary as itself.\"[2]\r\n\r\nRemember, then, in the discussions which follow, that if the theories\r\nadvanced are gigantic, the facts they seek to explain are not less\r\nso. We are not dealing with little things. The phenomena are\r\ncontinental, world-wide, globe-embracing.\r\n\r\n[1. Dana's \"Text-Book,\" p. 221.\r\n\r\n2.

Nevertheless, we repeat, no explanation presents\r\nitself which can be considered conclusive; and in science we should\r\nnever be afraid to say, _I do not know_.\"\r\n\r\nGeikie says:\r\n\r\n\"Many geologists can not yet be persuaded that till has ever formed\r\nand accumulated under ice.\" [3]\r\n\r\nA recent scientific writer, after summing up all the facts and all\r\nthe arguments, makes this confession:\r\n\r\n[1. \"American Cyclopædia,\" vol. vi, p. 112.\r\n\r\n2. \"The World before the Deluge,\" pp. 435, 463.\r\n\r\n3. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 370.]\r\n\r\n{p. 9}\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing facts, it seems to me that we are justified in\r\nconcluding:\r\n\r\n\"1. That however simple and plausible the Lyellian hypothesis may be,\r\nor however ingenious the extension or application of it suggested by\r\nDana, it is not sustained by any proof, and the testimony of the\r\nrocks seems to be decidedly against it.\r\n\r\n\"2. Though much may yet be learned from a more extended and careful\r\nstudy of the glacial phenomena of all parts of both hemispheres, the\r\nfacts already gathered _seem to be incompatible with any theory yet\r\nadvanced_ which makes the Ice period simply a series of telluric\r\nphenomena, and so far strengthens the arguments of those who look to\r\nextraneous and cosmical causes for the origin of these phenomena.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe reader will therefore understand that, in advancing into this\r\nargument, he is not invading a realm where Science has already set up\r\nher walls and bounds and landmarks; but rather he is entering a forum\r\nin which a great debate still goes on, amid the clamor of many\r\ntongues.\r\n\r\nThere are four theories by which it has been attempted to explain the\r\nDrift.\r\n\r\nThese are:\r\n\r\nI. The action of great waves and floods of water.\r\n\r\nII. The action of icebergs.\r\n\r\nIII. The action of glaciers.\r\n\r\nIV. The action of a continental ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nWe will consider these several theories in their order.\r\n\r\n[1. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" July, 1876, p. 290.]\r\n\r\n{p. 10}\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                         THE ACTION OF WAVES.\r\n\r\nWHEN men began, for the first time, to study the drift deposits, they\r\nbelieved that they found in them the results of the Noachic Deluge;\r\nand hence the Drift was called the Diluvium, and the period of time\r\nin which it was laid down was entitled the Diluvial age.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that--\r\n\r\n\"Somehow and somewhere in the far north a series of gigantic waves\r\nwas mysteriously propagated. These waves were supposed to have\r\nprecipitated themselves upon the land, and then swept madly over\r\nmountain and valley alike, carrying along with them a mighty burden\r\nof rocks and stones and rubbish. Such deluges were called 'waves of\r\ntranslation.'\"[1]\r\n\r\nThere were many difficulties about this theory:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there was no cause assigned for these waves,\r\nwhich must have been great enough to have swept over the tops of high\r\nmountains, for the evidences of the Drift age are found three\r\nthousand feet above the Baltic, four thousand feet high in the\r\nGrampians of Scotland, and six thousand feet high in New England.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, if this deposit had been swept up from or by the\r\nsea, it would contain marks of its origin. The shells of the sea, the\r\nbones of fish, the remains of seals and whales, would have been taken\r\nup by these great deluges, and carried over the land, and have\r\nremained\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 26.]\r\n\r\n{p. 11}\r\n\r\nmingled in the _débris_ which they deposited. This is not the case.\r\nThe unstratified Drift is unfossiliferous, and where the stratified\r\nDrift contains fossils they are the remains of land animals, except\r\nin a few low-lying districts near the sea.\r\n\r\nI quote:\r\n\r\n\"Over the interior of the continent _it contains no marine fossils or\r\nrelics_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nGeikie says:\r\n\r\n\"_Not a single trace of any marine organism has yet been detected in\r\ntrue till_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nMoreover, if the sea-waves made these great deposits, they must have\r\npicked up the material composing them either from the shores of the\r\nsea or the beds of streams. And when we consider the vastness of the\r\ndrift-deposits, extending, as they do, over continents, with a depth\r\nof hundreds of feet, it would puzzle us to say where were the\r\nsea-beaches or rivers on the globe that could produce such\r\ninconceivable quantities of gravel, sand, and clay. The production of\r\ngravel is limited to a small marge of the ocean, not usually more\r\nthan a mile wide, where the waves and the rocks meet. If we suppose\r\nthe whole shore of the oceans around the northern half of America to\r\nbe piled up with gravel five hundred feet thick, it would go but a\r\nlittle way to form the immense deposits which stretch from the Arctic\r\nSea to Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe stones of the \"till\" are strangely marked, striated, and\r\nscratched, with lines parallel to the longest diameter. No such\r\nstones are found in river-beds or on sea-shores.\r\n\r\nGeikie says:\r\n\r\n\"We look in vain for striated stones in the gravel which the surf\r\ndrives backward and forward on a beach,\r\n\r\n[1. Dana's \"Text-Book,\" p. 220.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 15.]\r\n\r\n{p. 12}\r\n\r\nand we may search the _detritus_ that beaches and rivers push along\r\ntheir beds, but _we shall not find any stones at all resembling those\r\nof the till_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nBut we need not discuss any further this theory. It is now almost\r\nuniversally abandoned.\r\n\r\nWe know of no way in which such waves could be formed; if they were\r\nformed, they could not find the material to carry over the land; if\r\nthey did find it, it would not have the markings which are found in\r\nthe Drift, and it would possess marine fossils not found in the\r\nDrift; and the waves would not and could not scratch and groove the\r\nrock-surfaces underneath the Drift, as we know they are scratched and\r\ngrooved.\r\n\r\nLet us then dismiss this hypothesis, and proceed to the consideration\r\nof the next.\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 69.]\r\n\r\n{p. 13}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                      WAS IT CAUSED BY ICEBERGS?\r\n\r\nWE come now to a much more reasonable hypothesis, and one not without\r\nnumerous advocates even to this day, to wit: that the drift-deposits\r\nwere caused by icebergs floating down in deep water over the sunken\r\nland, loaded with _débris_ from the Arctic shores, which they shed as\r\nthey melted in the warmer seas of the south.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis explains the carriage of enormous blocks weighing\r\nhundreds of tons from their original site to where they are now\r\nfound; but it is open to many unanswerable objections.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if the Drift had been deposited under water deep\r\nenough to float icebergs, it would present throughout unquestionable\r\nevidences of stratification, for the reason that the larger masses of\r\nstone would fall more rapidly than the smaller, and would be found at\r\nthe bottom of the deposit. If, for instance, you were to go to the\r\ntop of a shot-tower, filled with water, and let loose at the same\r\nmoment a quantity of cannon-balls, musket-balls, pistol-balls,\r\nduck-shot, reed-bird shot, and fine sand, all mixed together, the\r\ncannon-balls would reach the bottom first, and the other missiles in\r\nthe order of their size; and the deposit at the bottom would be found\r\nto be regularly stratified, with the sand and the finest shot on top.\r\nBut nothing of this kind is found in the Drift, especially in the\r\n\"till\"; clay, sand, gravel, stones,\r\n\r\n{p. 14}\r\n\r\nand bowlders are all found mixed together in the utmost confusion,\r\n\"higgledy-piggledy, pell-mell.\"\r\n\r\nSays Geikie:\r\n\r\n\"Neither can till owe its origin to icebergs. If it had been\r\ndistributed over the sea-bottom, it would assuredly have shown some\r\nkind of arrangement. When an iceberg drops its rubbish, it stands to\r\nreason that the heavier blocks will reach the bottom first, then the\r\nsmaller stones, and lastly the finer ingredients. There is no such\r\nassortment visible, however, in the normal 'till,' but large and\r\nsmall stones are scattered pretty equally through the clay, which,\r\nmoreover, is quite unstratified.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThis fact alone disposes of the iceberg theory as an explanation of\r\nthe Drift.\r\n\r\nAgain: whenever deposits are dropped in the sea, they fall uniformly\r\nand cover the surface below with a regular sheet, conforming to the\r\ninequalities of the ground, no thicker in one place than another. But\r\nin the Drift this is not the case. The deposit is thicker in the\r\nvalleys and thinner on the hills, sometimes absent altogether on the\r\nhigher elevations.\r\n\r\n\"The true bowlder-clay is spread out over the region under\r\nconsideration as a somewhat widely extended and uniform sheet, yet it\r\nmay be said to fill up all small valleys and depressions, and to be\r\nthin or absent on ridges or rising grounds.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThat is to say, it fell as a snow-storm falls, driven by high winds;\r\nor as a semi-fluid mass might be supposed to fall, draining down from\r\nthe elevations and filling up the hollows.\r\n\r\nAgain: the same difficulty presents itself which we found in the case\r\nof \"the waves of transplantation.\" Where did the material of the\r\nDrift come from? On what sea-shore, in what river-beds, was this\r\nincalculable mass of clay, gravel, and stones found?\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 72.\r\n\r\n2. \"American Cyclopædia,\" vol. vi, p. 112.]\r\n\r\n{p. 15}\r\n\r\nAgain: if we suppose the supply to have existed on the Arctic coasts,\r\nthe question comes,\r\n\r\nWould the icebergs have carried it over the face of the continents?\r\n\r\nMr. Croll has shown very clearly[1] that the icebergs nowadays\r\nusually sail down into the oceans without a scrap of _débris_ of any\r\nkind upon them.\r\n\r\nAgain: how could the icebergs have made the continuous scratchings or\r\nstriæ, found under the Drift nearly all over the continents of Europe\r\nand America? Why, say the advocates of this theory, the icebergs\r\npress upon the bottom of the sea, and with the stones adhering to\r\ntheir base they make those striæ.\r\n\r\nBut two things are necessary to this: First, that there should be a\r\nforce great enough to drive the berg over the bottom of the sea when\r\nit has once grounded. We know of no such force. On the contrary, we\r\ndo know that wherever a berg grounds it stays until it rocks itself\r\nto pieces or melts away. But, suppose there was such a propelling\r\nforce, then it is evident that whenever the iceberg floated clear of\r\nthe bottom it would cease to make the strive, and would resume them\r\nonly when it nearly stranded again. That is to say, when the water\r\nwas deep enough for the berg to float clear of the bottom of the sea,\r\nthere could be no striæ; when the water was too shallow, the berg\r\nwould not float at all, and there would be no striæ. The berg would\r\nmark the rocks only where it neither floated clear nor stranded.\r\nHence we would find striæ only at a certain elevation, while the\r\nrocks below or above that level would be free from them. But this is\r\nnot the case with the drift-markings. They pass over mountains and\r\ndown into the deepest valleys; they are\r\n\r\n[1. \"Climate and Time,\" p. 282.]\r\n\r\n{p. 16}\r\n\r\nuniversal within very large areas; they cover the face of continents\r\nand disappear under the waves of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is simply impossible that the Drift was caused by icebergs. I\r\nrepeat, when they floated clear of the rocks, of course they would\r\nnot mark them; when the water was too shallow to permit them to float\r\nat all, and so move onward, of course they could not mark them. The\r\nstriations would occur only when the water was; just deep enough to\r\nfloat the berg, and not deep enough to raise the berg clear of the\r\nrocks; and but a small part of the bottom of the sea could fulfill\r\nthese conditions.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when the waters were six thousand feet deep in New England,\r\nand four thousand feet deep in Scotland, and over the tops of the\r\nRocky Mountains, where was the rest of the world, and the life it\r\ncontained?\r\n\r\n{p. 17}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                      WAS IT CAUSED BY GLACIERS?\r\n\r\nWHAT is a glacier? It is a river of ice, crowded by the weight of\r\nmountain-ice down into some valley, along which it descends by a\r\nslow, almost imperceptible motion, due to a power of the ice, under\r\nthe force of gravity, to rearrange its molecules. It is fed by the\r\nmountains and melted by the sun.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers are local in character, and comparatively few in number;\r\nthey are confined to valleys having some general slope downward. The\r\nwhole Alpine mass does not move down upon the plain. The movement\r\ndownward is limited to these glacier-rivers.\r\n\r\nThe glacier complies with some of the conditions of the problem. We\r\ncan suppose it capable of taking in its giant paw a mass of rock, and\r\nusing it as a graver to carve deep grooves in the rock below it; and\r\nwe can see in it a great agency for breaking up rocks and carrying\r\nthe _detritus_ down upon the plains. But here the resemblance ends.\r\n\r\nThat high authority upon this subject, James Geikie, says:\r\n\r\n\"But we can not fail to remark that, although scratched and polished\r\nstones occur not infrequently in the frontal moraines of Alpine\r\nglaciers, yet at the same time these moraines _do not at all resemble\r\ntill_. The moraine consists for the most part of a confused heap of\r\nrough _angular_ stones and blocks, and loose sand and _débris_;\r\nscratched\r\n\r\n{p. 18}\r\n\r\nstones are decidedly in the minority, and indeed _a close search will\r\noften fail to show them_. Clearly, then, the till is not of the\r\nnature of a terminal moraine. _Each stone_ in the 'till' gives\r\nevidence of having been subjected to a grinding process. . . .\r\n\r\n\"We look in vain, however, among the glaciers of the Alps for such a\r\ndeposit. The scratched stones we may occasionally find, _but where is\r\nthe clay?_ . . . It is clear that the conditions for the gathering of\r\na stony clay like the I till' do not obtain (as far as we know) among\r\nthe Alpine glaciers. There is too much water circulating below the\r\nice there to allow any considerable thickness of such a deposit to\r\naccumulate.\"[1]\r\n\r\nBut it is questionable whether the glaciers do press with a steady\r\nforce upon the rocks beneath so as to score them. As a rule, the base\r\nof the glacier is full of water; rivers flow from under them. The\r\nopposite picture, from Professor Winchell's \"Sketches of Creation,\"\r\npage 223, does not represent a mass of ice, bugging the rocks,\r\nholding in its grasp great gravers of stone with which to cut the\r\nface of the rocks into deep grooves, and to deposit an even coating\r\nof rounded stones and clay over the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, here are only angular masses of rock, and a stream\r\nwhich would certainly wash away any clay which might be formed.\r\n\r\nLet Mr. Dawkins state the case:\r\n\r\n\"The hypothesis upon which the southern extension is founded--that\r\nthe bowlder-clays have been formed by ice melting on the land--is\r\nopen to this objection, that _no similar clays have been proved to\r\nhave been so formed_, either in the Arctic regions, where the\r\nice-sheet has retreated, or in the districts forsaken by the glaciers\r\nin the Alps or Pyrenees, or in any other mountain-chain. . . .\r\n\r\nThe English bowlder-clays, as a whole, differ from\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" pp. 70-72.]\r\n\r\n{p. 19}\r\n\r\nthe _moraine profonde_ in their softness, and the large area which\r\nthey cover. Strata of bowlder-clay at all comparable to the great\r\nclay mantle covering the lower grounds of Britain, north of the\r\nThames, are conspicuous by their absence from the glaciated regions\r\nof Central Europe and the Pyrenees, which were not depressed beneath\r\nthe sea.\"\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                A RIVER ISSUING FROM A SWISS GLACIER.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Drift, especially the \"till,\" lies in great continental\r\nsheets of clay and gravel, of comparatively uniform thickness. The\r\nglaciers could not form such sheets; they deposit their material in\r\nlong ridges called \"terminal moraines.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz, the great advocate of the ice-origin of the Drift, says:\r\n\r\n\"All these moraines are the land-marks, so to speak, by which we\r\ntrace the height and extent, as well as the\r\n\r\n[1. Dawkin's \"Early Man in Britain,\" pp. 116, 117.]\r\n\r\n{p. 20}\r\n\r\nprogress and retreat, of glaciers in former times. Suppose, for\r\ninstance, that a glacier were to disappear entirely. For ages it has\r\nbeen a gigantic ice-raft, receiving all sorts of materials on its\r\nsurface as it traveled onward, and bearing them along with it; while\r\nthe hard particles of rocks set in its lower surface have been\r\npolishing and fashioning the whole surface over which it extended. As\r\nit now melts it drops its various burdens to the ground; bowlders are\r\nthe milestones marking the different stages of its journey; the\r\nterminal and lateral moraines are the frame-work which it erected\r\naround itself as it moved forward, and which define its boundaries\r\ncenturies after it has vanished.\"[1]\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                          TERMINAL MORAINE.\r\n\r\nAnd Professor Agassiz gives us, on page 307 of the same work, the\r\nabove representation of a \"terminal moraine.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader can see at once that these semicircular\r\n\r\n[1. \"Geological Sketches,\" p. 308.]\r\n\r\n{p. 21}\r\n\r\nridges bear no resemblance whatever to the great drift-deposits of\r\nthe world, spread out in vast and nearly uniform sheets, without\r\nstratification, over hills and plains alike.\r\n\r\nAnd here is another perplexity: It might naturally be supposed that\r\nthe smoothed, scratched, and smashed appearance of the underlying\r\nrocks was due to the rubbing and rolling of the stones under the ice\r\nof the glaciers; but, strange to say, we find that--\r\n\r\n\"The scratched and polished rock-surfaces are by no means confined to\r\ntill-covered districts. They are met with _everywhere_ and _at all\r\nlevels_ throughout the country, from the sea-coast up to near the\r\ntops of some of our higher mountains. The lower hill-ranges, such as\r\nthe Sidlaws, the Ochils, the Pentlands, the Kilbarchan and Paisley\r\nHills, and others, exhibit polished and smoothed rock-surfaces _on\r\ntheir very crest_. Similar markings streak and score the rocks up to\r\na great height in the deep valleys of the Highlands.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWe can realize, in our imagination, the glacier of the\r\nmountain-valley crushing and marking the bed in which it moves, or\r\neven the plain on which it discharges itself; but it is impossible to\r\nconceive of a glacier upon the bare top of a mountain, without walls\r\nto restrain it or direct its flow, or higher ice accumulations to\r\nfeed it.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n\"If glaciers descended, as they did, on both sides of the great\r\nAlpine ranges, then we would expect to find the same results on the\r\nplains of Northern Italy that present themselves on the low grounds\r\nof Switzerland. But this is not the case. On the plains of Italy\r\nthere are no traces of the stony clay found in Switzerland and all\r\nover Europe. Neither are any of the stones of the drift of Italy\r\nscratched or striated.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 73.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., pp. 491, 492.]\r\n\r\n{p. 22}\r\n\r\nBut, strange to say, while, as Geikie admits, no true \"till\" or Drift\r\nis now being formed by or under the glaciers of Switzerland,\r\nnevertheless \"till\" is found in that country _disassociated from the\r\nglaciers_. Geikie says:\r\n\r\n\"In the low grounds of Switzerland we get a dark, tough clay, packed\r\nwith scratched and well-rubbed stones, and containing here and there\r\nsome admixture of sand and irregular beds and patches of earthy\r\ngravel. This clay is quite unstratified, and the strata upon which it\r\nrests frequently exhibit much confusion, being turned up on end and\r\nbent over, exactly as in this country the rocks are sometimes broken\r\nand disturbed below till. The whole deposit has experienced much\r\ndenudation, but even yet it covers considerable areas, and attains a\r\nthickness varying from a few feet up to not less than thirty feet in\r\nthickness.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere, then, are the objections to this theory of the glacier-origin\r\nof the Drift:\r\n\r\nI. The glaciers do not produce striated stones.\r\n\r\nII. The glaciers do not produce drift-clay.\r\n\r\nIII. The glaciers could not have formed continental sheets of \"till.\"\r\n\r\nIV. The glaciers could not have existed upon, and consequently could\r\nnot have striated, the mountain-tops.\r\n\r\nV. The glaciers could not have reached to the great plains of the\r\ncontinents far remote from valleys, where we still find the Drift and\r\ndrift-markings.\r\n\r\nVI. The glaciers are limited in number and confined in their\r\noperations, and were utterly inadequate to have produced the\r\nthousands of square miles of drift-_débris_ which we find enfolding\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 373.]\r\n\r\n{p. 23}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n               WAS IT CAUSED BY CONTINENTAL ICE-SHEETS?\r\n\r\nWE, come now to the theory which is at present most generally\r\naccepted:\r\n\r\nIt being apparent that glaciers were not adequate to produce the\r\nresults which we find, the glacialists have fallen back upon an\r\nextraordinary hypothesis--to wit, that the whole north and south\r\nregions of the globe, extending from the poles to 35° or 40° of north\r\nand south latitude, were, in the Drift age, covered with enormous,\r\ncontinuous sheets of ice, from one mile thick at its southern margin,\r\nto three or five miles thick at the poles. As they find\r\ndrift-scratches upon the tops of mountains in Europe three to four\r\nthousand feet high, and in New England upon elevations six thousand\r\nfeet high, it follows, according to this hypothesis, that the\r\nice-sheet must have been considerably higher than these mountains,\r\nfor the ice must have been thick enough to cover their tops, and high\r\nenough and heavy enough above their tops to press down upon and\r\ngroove and scratch the rocks. And as the _striæ_ in Northern Europe\r\nwere found to disregard the conformation of the continent and the\r\nislands of the sea, it became necessary to suppose that this polar\r\nice-sheet filled up the bays and seas, so that one could have passed\r\ndry-shod, in that period, from France to the north pole, over a\r\nsteadily ascending plane of ice.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to explain where all this\r\n\r\n{p. 24}\r\n\r\nice came from; or what force lifted the moisture into the air which,\r\nafterward descending, constituted these world-cloaks of frozen water.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, easy to suppose that such world-cloaks might have\r\nexisted; we can imagine the water of the seas falling on the\r\ncontinents, and freezing as it fell, until, in the course of ages, it\r\nconstituted such gigantic ice-sheets; but something more than this is\r\nneeded. This does not account for these hundreds of feet of clay,\r\nbowlders, and gravel.\r\n\r\nBut it is supposed that these were torn from the surface of the rocks\r\nby the pressure of the ice-sheet moving southward. But what would\r\nmake it move southward? We know that some of our mountains are\r\ncovered to-day with immense sheets of ice, hundreds and thousands of\r\nfeet in thickness. Do these descend upon the flat country? No; they\r\nlie there and melt, and are renewed, kept in equipoise by the\r\ncontending forces of heat and cold.\r\n\r\nWhy should the ice-sheet move southward? Because, say the\r\n\"glacialists,\" the lands of the northern parts of Europe and America\r\nwere then elevated fifteen hundred feet higher than at present, and\r\nthis gave the ice a sufficient descent. But what became of that\r\nelevation afterward? Why, it went down again. It had accommodatingly\r\nperformed its function, and then the land resumed its old place!\r\n\r\nBut _did_ the land rise up in this extraordinary fashion? Croll says:\r\n\r\n\"The greater elevation of the land (in the Ice period) is simply\r\nassumed as an hypothesis to account for the cold. The facts of\r\ngeology, however, are fast establishing the opposite conclusion,\r\nviz., that when the country was covered with ice, the land stood in\r\nrelation to the sea at a lower level than at present, and that the\r\ncontinental periods or times, when the land stood in relation to the\r\n\r\n{p. 25}\r\n\r\nsea at a higher level than now, were the warm inter-glacial periods,\r\nwhen the country was free of snow and ice, And a mild and equable\r\ncondition of climate prevailed. This is the conclusion toward which\r\nwe are being led by the more recent revelations of surface-geology,\r\nand also by certain facts connected with the geographical\r\ndistribution of plants and animals during the Glacial epoch.\"[1]\r\n\r\nH. B. Norton says:\r\n\r\n\"When we come to study the cause of these phenomena, we find many\r\nperplexing and contradictory theories in the field. A favorite one is\r\nthat of vertical elevation. But it seems impossible to admit that the\r\ncircle inclosed within the parallel of 40°--some seven thousand miles\r\nin diameter--could have been elevated to such a height as to produce\r\nthis remarkable result. This would be a supposition hard to reconcile\r\nwith the present proportion of land and water on the surface of the\r\nglobe and with the phenomena of terrestrial contraction and\r\ngravitation.\"[2]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the surface-rocks underneath the Drift are scored\r\nand grooved by some external force. Now we find that these markings\r\ndo not all run in the same direction; on the contrary, they cross\r\neach other in an extraordinary manner. The cut on the following page\r\nillustrates this.\r\n\r\nIf the direction of the motion of the ice-sheets, which caused these\r\nmarkings, was,--as the glacialists allege,--always from the elevated\r\nregion in the north to the lower ground in the south, then the\r\nmarkings must always have been in the same direction: given a fixed\r\ncause, we must have always a fixed result. We shall see, as we go on\r\nin this argument, that the deposition of the \"till\" was\r\ninstantaneous; and, as these markings were made before or at the same\r\ntime the \"till\" was laid down, how could the land\r\n\r\n[1. \"Climate and Time,\" p. 391.\r\n\r\n2. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" October, 1879, p. 833.]\r\n\r\n{p. 26}\r\n\r\npossibly have bobbed up and down, now here, now there, so that the\r\nelevation from which the ice-sheet descended\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n  SKETCH OF GLACIER-FURROWS AND SCRATCHES AT STONY POINT, LAKE ERIE,\r\n                              MICHIGAN.\r\n\r\n     _aa_, deep water-line; _bb_ border of the bank of earthy\r\n     materials; _cc_, deep parallel grooves four and a half feet\r\n     apart and twenty-five feet long, bearing north 60° east;\r\n     _d_, a set of grooves and scratches bearing north 60° west;\r\n     _e_, a natural bridge.\r\n\r\n     [Winchell's \"Sketches of Creation,\" p. 213.]\r\n\r\nwas one moment in the northeast, and the next moment had whirled away\r\ninto the northwest? As the poet says:\r\n\r\n     \". . . Will these trees,\r\n     That have outlived the eagle, page thy steps\r\n     And skip, when thou point'st out?\"\r\n\r\n{p. 27}\r\n\r\nBut if the point of elevation was whisked away from east to west, how\r\ncould an ice-sheet a mile thick instantaneously adapt itself to the\r\nchange? For all these markings took place in the interval between the\r\ntime when the external force, whatever it was, struck the rocks, and\r\nthe time when a sufficient body of \"till\" had been laid down to\r\nshield the rocks and prevent further wear and tear. Neither is it\r\npossible to suppose an ice-sheet, a mile in thickness, moving in two\r\ndiametrically opposite directions at the same time.\r\n\r\nAgain: the ice-sheet theory requires an elevation in the north and a\r\ndescent southwardly; and it is this descent southwardly which is\r\nsupposed to have given the momentum and movement by which the weight\r\nof the superincumbent mass of ice tore up, plowed up, ground up, and\r\nsmashed up the face of the surface-rocks, and thus formed the Drift\r\nand made the _striæ_.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, when we come to apply this theory to the facts,\r\nwe find that it is the _north_ sides of the hills and mountains that\r\nare striated, while the _south sides have gone scot-free!_ Surely, if\r\nweight and motion made the Drift, then the groovings, caused by\r\nweight and motion, must have been more distinct upon a declivity than\r\nupon an ascent. The school-boy toils patiently and slowly up the hill\r\nwith his sled, but when he descends he comes down with\r\nrailroad-speed, scattering the snow before him in all directions. But\r\nhere we have a school-boy that tears and scatters things going\r\n_up_-hill, and sneaks down-hill snail-fashion.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Hitchcock remarks, that Mount Monadnock, New Hampshire,\r\n3,250 feet high, is scarified from top to bottom on its northern side\r\nand western side, but not on, the southern.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThis state of things is universal in North America.\r\n\r\n[1. Dana's \"Manual of Geology,\" p. 537.]\r\n\r\n{p. 28}\r\n\r\nBut let us look at another point:\r\n\r\nIf the vast deposits of sand, gravel, clay, and bowlders, which are\r\nfound in Europe and America, were placed there by a great continental\r\nice-sheet, reaching down from the north pole to latitude 35° or 40°;\r\nif it was the ice that tore and scraped up the face of the rocks and\r\nrolled the stones and striated them, and left them in great sheets\r\nand heaps all over the land--then it follows, as a matter of course,\r\nthat in all the regions equally near the pole, and equally cold in\r\nclimate, the ice must have formed a similar sheet, and in like manner\r\nhave torn up the rocks and ground them into gravel and clay. This\r\nconclusion is irresistible. If the cold of the north caused the ice,\r\nand the ice caused the Drift, then in all the cold north-lands there\r\nmust have been ice, and consequently there ought to have been Drift.\r\nIf we can find, therefore, any extensive cold region of the earth\r\nwhere the Drift is not, then we can not escape the conclusion that\r\nthe cold and the ice did not make the Drift.\r\n\r\nLet us see: One of the coldest regions of the earth is Siberia. It is\r\na vast tract reaching to the Arctic Circle; it is the north part of\r\nthe Continent of Asia; it is intersected by great mountain-ranges.\r\nHere, if anywhere, we should find the Drift; here, if anywhere, was\r\nthe ice-field, \"the sea of ice.\" It is more elevated and more\r\nmountainous than the interior of North America where the\r\ndrift-deposits are extensive; it is nearer the pole than New York and\r\nIllinois, covered as these are with hundreds of feet of _débris_, and\r\nyet _there is no Drift in Siberia!_\r\n\r\nI quote from a high authority, and a firm believer in the theory that\r\nglaciers or ice-sheets caused the drift; James Geikie says:\r\n\r\n\"It is remarkable that _nowhere in the great plains of Siberia do any\r\ntraces of glacial action appear to have_\r\n\r\n{p. 29}\r\n\r\n_been observed._ If cones and mounds of gravel and great erratics\r\nlike those that sprinkle so wide an area in Northern America and\r\nNorthern Europe had occurred, they would hardly have failed to arrest\r\nthe attention of explorers. Middendorff does, indeed, mention the\r\noccurrence of trains of large erratics which he observed along the\r\nbanks of some of the rivers, but these, he has no doubt, were carried\r\ndown by river-ice. The general character of the 'tundras' is that of\r\nwide, flat plains, covered for the most part with a grassy and mossy\r\nvegetation, but here and there bare and sandy. Frequently nothing\r\nintervenes to break the monotony of the landscape. . . . It would\r\nappear, then, that ill Northern Asia representatives of the glacial\r\ndeposits which are met with in similar latitudes in Europe and\r\nAmerica _do not occur_. The northern drift of Russia and Germany; the\r\nåsar of Sweden; the kames, eskers, and erratics of Britain; and the\r\niceberg-drift of Northern America have, apparently, no equivalent in\r\nSiberia. Consequently we find the great river-deposits, with their\r\nmammalian remains, which tell of a milder climate than now obtains in\r\nthose high latitudes, still lying _undisturbed at the surface_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThink of the significance of all this. There is no Drift in Siberia;\r\nno \"till,\" no \"bowlder-clay,\" no stratified masses of gravel, sand,\r\nand stones. There was, then, no Drift age in all Northern Asia, _up\r\nto the Arctic Circle!_\r\n\r\nHow pregnant is this admission. It demolishes at one blow the whole\r\ntheory that the Drift came of the ice. For surely if we could expect\r\nto find ice, during the so-called Glacial age, anywhere on the face\r\nof our planet, it would be in Siberia. But, if there was an ice-sheet\r\nthere, it did not grind up the rocks; it did not striate them; it did\r\nnot roll the fragments into bowlders and pebbles; it rested so\r\nquietly on the face of the land that, as Geikie tells us, the\r\npre-glacial deposits throughout Siberia, with their mammalian\r\nremains, are still found \"_lying undisturbed_\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 460, published in 1873.]\r\n\r\n{p. 30}\r\n\r\n_on the surface_\"; and he even thinks that the great mammals, the\r\nmammoth and the woolly rhinoceros, \"may have survived in Northern\r\nAsia down to a comparatively recent date,\"[1] ages after they were\r\ncrushed out of existence by the Drift of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nMr. Geikie seeks to account for this extraordinary state of things by\r\nsupposing that the climate of Siberia was, during the Glacial age,\r\ntoo dry to furnish snow to make the ice-sheet. But when it is\r\nremembered that there was moisture enough, we are told, in Northern\r\nEurope and America at that time to form a layer of ice from _one to\r\nthree miles in thickness_, it would certainly seem that enough ought\r\nto have blown across the eastern line of European Russia to give\r\nSiberia a fair share of ice and Drift. The explanation is more\r\nextraordinary than the thing it explains. One third of the water of\r\nall the oceans must have been carried up, and was circulating around\r\nin the air, to descend upon the earth in rain and snow, and yet none\r\nof it fell on Northern Asia! And as the line of the continents\r\nseparating Europe and Asia had not yet been established, it can not\r\nbe supposed that the Drift ref used to enter Asia out of respect to\r\nthe geographical lines.\r\n\r\nBut not alone is the Drift absent from Siberia, and, probably, all\r\nAsia; it does not extend even over all Europe. Louis Figuier says\r\nthat the traces of glacial action \"are observed in all the north of\r\nEurope, in Russia, Iceland, Norway, Prussia, the British Islands,\r\npart of Germany in the north, and even in some parts of the south of\r\nSpain.\"[2] M. Edouard Collomb finds only a \"a shred\" of the glacial\r\nevidences in France, and thinks they were _absent from part of\r\nRussia!_\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 461.\r\n\r\n2. \"The World before the Deluge,\" p. 451.]\r\n\r\n{p. 31}\r\n\r\nAnd, even in North America, the Drift is not found everywhere. There\r\nis a remarkable region, embracing a large area in Wisconsin, Iowa,\r\nand Minnesota, which Professor J. D. Whitney[1] calls \"the driftless\r\nregion,\" in which no drift, no clays, no gravel, no rock strive or\r\nfurrows are found. The rock-surfaces have not been ground down and\r\npolished. \"This is the more remarkable,\" says Geikie, \"seeing that\r\nthe regions to the north, west, east, and south are all more or less\r\ndeeply covered with drift-deposits.\"[2] And, in this region, as in\r\nSiberia, the remains of the large, extinct mammalia are found\r\nimbedded in the surface-wash, or in cracks or crevices of the\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nIf the Drift of North America was due to the ice-sheet, why is there\r\nno drift-deposit in \"the driftless region\" of the Northwestern States\r\nof America? Surely this region must have been as cold as Illinois,\r\nOhio, etc. It is now the coldest part of the Union. Why should the\r\nice have left this oasis, and refused to form on it? Or why, if it\r\ndid form on it, did it refuse to tear up the rock-surfaces and form\r\nDrift?\r\n\r\nAgain, no traces of northern drift are found in California, which is\r\nsurrounded by high mountains, in some of which fragments of glaciers\r\nare found even to this day.[3]\r\n\r\nAccording to Foster, the Drift did not extend to Oregon; and, in the\r\nopinion of some, it does not reach much beyond the western boundary\r\nof Iowa.\r\n\r\nNor can it be supposed that the driftless regions of Siberia,\r\nNorthwestern America, and the Pacific coast are due to the absence of\r\nice upon them during the Glacial\r\n\r\n[1. \"Report of the Geological Survey of Wisconsin,\" vol. i, p. 114.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 465.\r\n\r\n3. Whitney, \"Proceedings of the California Academy of Natural\r\nSciences.\"]\r\n\r\n{p. 32}\r\n\r\nage, for in Siberia the remains of the great mammalia, the mammoth,\r\nthe woolly rhinoceros, the bison, and the horse, are found to this\r\nday imbedded in great masses of ice, which, as we shall see, are\r\nsupposed to have been formed around them at the very coming of the\r\nDrift age.\r\n\r\nBut there is another difficulty:\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that on all the continents an ice-belt came down from\r\nthe north and south poles to 35° or 40° of latitude, and there stood,\r\nmassive and terrible, like the ice-sheet of Greenland, frowning over\r\nthe remnant of the world, and giving out continually fogs,\r\nsnow-storms, and tempests; what, under such circumstances, must have\r\nbeen the climatic conditions of the narrow belt of land which these\r\nice-sheets did not cover?\r\n\r\nLouis Figuier says:\r\n\r\n\"Such masses of ice could only have covered the earth when the\r\ntemperature of the air was lowered at least some degrees below zero.\r\nBut organic life is incompatible with such a temperature; and to this\r\ncause must we attribute the disappearance of certain species of\r\nanimals and plants--in particular the rhinoceros and the\r\nelephant--which, before this sudden and extraordinary cooling of the\r\nglobe, appeared to have limited themselves, in immense herds, to\r\nNorthern Europe, and chiefly to Siberia, where their remains have\r\nbeen found in such prodigious quantities.\"[1]\r\n\r\nBut if the now temperate region of Europe and America was subject to\r\na degree of cold great enough to destroy these huge animals, then\r\nthere could not have been a tropical climate anywhere on the globe.\r\nIf the line of 35° or 40°, north and south, was several degrees below\r\nzero, the equator must have been at least below the frost-point. And,\r\nif so, how can we account for the survival,\r\n\r\n[1. \"The World before the Deluge,\" p. 462.]\r\n\r\n{p. 33}\r\n\r\nto our own time, of innumerable tropical plants that can not stand\r\nfor one instant the breath of frost, and whose fossilized remains are\r\nfound in the rocks prior to the Drift? As they lived through the\r\nGlacial age, it could not have been a period of great and intense\r\ncold. And this conclusion is in accordance with the results of the\r\nlatest researches of the scientists:--\r\n\r\n\"In his valuable studies upon the diluvial flora, Count Gaston de\r\nSaporta concludes that the climate in this period was marked rather\r\nby extreme moisture than extreme cold.\"\r\n\r\nAgain: where did the clay, which is deposited in such gigantic\r\nmasses, hundreds of feet thick, over the continents, come from? We\r\nhave seen (p. 18, _ante_) that, according to Mr. Dawkins, \"no such\r\nclay has been proved to have been formed, _either in the Arctic\r\nregions, whence the ice-sheet has retreated_, or in the districts\r\nforsaken by the glaciers.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Arctic ice-sheet does not create such a clay now, why did it\r\ncreate it centuries ago on the plains of England or Illinois?\r\n\r\nThe other day I traveled from Minnesota to Cape May, on the shore of\r\nthe Atlantic, a distance of about fifteen hundred miles. At scarcely\r\nany point was I out of sight of the red clay and gravel of the Drift:\r\nit loomed up amid the beach-sands of New Jersey; it was laid bare by\r\nrailroad-cuts in the plains of New York and Pennsylvania; it covered\r\nthe highest tops of the Alleghanies at Altoona; the farmers of Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin were raising crops upon it; it was\r\neverywhere. If one had laid down a handful of the Wisconsin Drift\r\nalongside of a handful of the New Jersey deposit, he could scarcely\r\nhave perceived any difference between them.\r\n\r\n{p. 34}\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a geological formation, almost identical in character,\r\nfifteen hundred miles long from east to west, and reaching through\r\nthe whole length of North and South America, from the Arctic Circle\r\nto Patagonia.\r\n\r\nDid ice grind this out of the granite?\r\n\r\nWhere did it get the granite? The granite reaches the surface only in\r\nlimited areas; as a rule, it is buried many miles in depth under the\r\nsedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nHow did the ice pick out its materials so as to grind _nothing but\r\ngranite_?\r\n\r\nThis deposit overlies limestone and sandstone. The ice-sheet rested\r\nupon them. Why were _they_ not ground up with the granite? Did the\r\nice intelligently pick out a particular kind of rock, and that the\r\nhardest of them all?\r\n\r\nBut here is another marvel--this clay is red. The red is due to the\r\ngrinding up of mica and hornblende. Granite is composed of quartz,\r\nfeldspar, and mica. In syenitic granite the materials are quartz,\r\nfeldspar, and hornblende. Mica and hornblende contain considerable\r\noxide of iron, while feldspar has none. When mica and hornblende are\r\nground up, the result is blue or red clays, as the oxidation of the\r\niron turns the clay red; while the clay made of feldspar is light\r\nyellow or white.\r\n\r\nNow, then, not only did the ice-sheet select for grinding the granite\r\nrocks, and refuse to touch the others, but it put the granite itself\r\nthrough some mysterious process by which it separated the feldspar\r\nfrom the mica and hornblende, and manufactured a white or yellow clay\r\nout of the one, which it deposited in great sheets by itself, as west\r\nof the Mississippi; while it ground up the mica and hornblende and\r\nmade blue or red clays, which it laid down elsewhere, as the red\r\nclays are spread over that great stretch of fifteen hundred miles to\r\nwhich I have referred.\r\n\r\n{p. 35}\r\n\r\nCan any one suppose that ice could so discriminate?\r\n\r\nAnd if it by any means effected this separation of the particles of\r\ngranite, indissolubly knit together, how could it perpetuate that\r\nseparation while moving over the land, crushing all beneath and\r\nbefore it, and leave it on the face of the earth free from commixture\r\nwith the surface rocks?\r\n\r\nAgain: the ice-sheets which now exist in the remote north do not move\r\nwith a constant and regular motion southward, grinding up the rocks\r\nas they go. A recent writer, describing the appearance of things in\r\nGreenland, says:\r\n\r\n\"The coasts are deeply indented with numerous bays and fiords or\r\nfirths, which, when traced inland, are almost invariably found to\r\nterminate against glaciers. Thick ice frequently appears, too,\r\ncrowning the exposed sea-cliffs, from the edges of which _it droops\r\nin thick, tongue-like, and stalactitic projections_, until its own\r\nweight forces it to break away and topple down the precipices into\r\nthe sea.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThis does not represent an ice-sheet moving down continuously from\r\nthe high grounds and tearing up the rocks. It rather breaks off like\r\ngreat icicles from the caves of a house.\r\n\r\nAgain: the ice-sheets to-day do not striate or groove the rocks over\r\nwhich they move.\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell, author of two works in defense of the iceberg\r\ntheory--\"Fire and Frost,\" and \"A Short American Tramp\"--went, in\r\n1864, to the coasts of Labrador, the Strait of Belle Isle, and the\r\nGulf of St. Lawrence, for the express purpose of witnessing the\r\neffects of icebergs, and testing the theory he had formed. On the\r\ncoast of Labrador he reports that at Hanly Harbor, where\r\n\r\n[1. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" April, 1874, p. 646.]\r\n\r\n{p. 36}\r\n\r\nthe whole strait is blocked up with ice each winter, and the great\r\nmass swung bodily up and down, \"grating along the bottom at all\r\ndepths,\" he \"found the rocks ground smooth, but _not striated_.\"[1]\r\nAt Cape Charles and Battle Harbor, he reports, \"the rocks at the\r\nwater-line are _not striated_.\"[2] At St. Francis Harbor, \"the\r\nwater-line is much rubbed smooth, but _not striated_.\"[3] At Sea\r\nIslands, he says, \"No striæ are to be seen at the land-wash in these\r\nsounds or on open sea-coasts near the present waterline.\"[4]\r\n\r\nAgain: if these drift-deposits, these vast accumulations of sand,\r\nclay, gravel, and bowlders, were caused by a great continental\r\nice-sheet scraping and tearing the rocks on which it rested, and\r\nconstantly moving toward the sun, then not only would we find, as I\r\nhave suggested in the case of glaciers, the accumulated masses of\r\nrubbish piled up in great windrows or ridges along the lines where\r\nthe face of the ice-sheet melted, but we would naturally expect that\r\nthe farther north we went the less we would find of these materials;\r\nin other words, that the ice, advancing southwardly, would sweep the\r\nnorth clear of _débris_ to pile it up in the more southern regions.\r\nBut this is far from being the case. On the contrary, the great\r\nmasses of the Drift extend as far north as the land itself. In the\r\nremote, barren grounds of North America, we are told by various\r\ntravelers who have visited those regions, \"sand-hills and erratics\r\nappear to be as common as in the countries farther south.\"[5] Captain\r\nBach tells us[6] that he saw great chains of sand-hills, stretching\r\n\r\n[1. \"A Short American Tramp,\" pp. 68, 107.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 68.\r\n\r\n3. Ibid., p. 72.\r\n\r\n4. Ibid., p. 76.\r\n\r\n5. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 391.\r\n\r\n6. \"Narrative of Arctic Land Expedition to the Mouth of the Great\r\nFish River,\" pp. 140, 346.]\r\n\r\n{p. 37}\r\n\r\naway from each side of the valley of the Great Fish River, in north\r\nlatitude 66°, of great height, and crowned with gigantic bowlders.\r\n\r\nWhy did not the advancing ice-sheet drive these deposits southward\r\nover the plains of the United States? Can we conceive of a force that\r\nwas powerful enough to grind up the solid rocks, and yet was not able\r\nto remove its own _débris_?\r\n\r\nBut there is still another reason which ought to satisfy us, once for\r\nall, that the drift-deposits were not due to the pressure of a great\r\ncontinental ice-sheet. It is this:\r\n\r\nIf the presence of the Drift proves that the country in which it is\r\nfound was once covered with a body of ice thick and heavy enough by\r\nits pressure and weight to grind up the surface-rocks into clay,\r\nsand, gravel, and bowlders, then the tropical regions of the world\r\nmust have been covered with such a great ice-sheet, upon the very\r\nequator; for Agassiz found in Brazil a vast sheet of \"ferruginous\r\nclay with pebbles,\" which covers the whole country, \"a sheet of\r\ndrift,\" says Agassiz, \"consisting of the same homogeneous,\r\nunstratified paste, and containing loose materials of all sorts and\r\nsizes,\" deep red in color, and distributed, as in the north, in\r\nuneven hills, while sometimes it is reduced to a thin deposit. It is\r\nrecent in time, although overlying rocks ancient geologically.\r\nAgassiz had no doubt whatever that it was of glacial origin.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hartt, who accompanied Professor Agassiz in his South\r\nAmerican travels, and published a valuable work called \"The Geology\r\nof Brazil,\" describes drift-deposits as covering the province of\r\nPará, Brazil, upon the equator itself. The whole valley of the Amazon\r\nis covered with stratified and unstratified and unfossiliferous\r\n\r\n{p. 38}\r\n\r\nDrift,[1] and also with a peculiar drift-clay (_argile plastique\r\nbigarrée_), plastic and streaked.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hartt gives a cut from which I copy the following\r\nrepresentation of drift-clay and pebbles overlying a gneiss hillock\r\nof the Serra do Mar, Brazil:\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                    DRIFT-DEPOSITS IN THE TROPICS.\r\n\r\n     _a_, drift-clay; _f f_, angular fragments of quartz; _c_.\r\n     sheet of pebbles; _d d_, gneiss in situ; _g g_, quartz and\r\n     granite veins traversing the gneiss.\r\n\r\nBut here is the dilemma to which the glacialists are reduced: If an\r\nice-sheet a mile in thickness, or even one hundred feet in thickness,\r\nwas necessary to produce the Drift, and if it covered the equatorial\r\nregions of Brazil, then there is no reason why the same climatic\r\nconditions should not have produced the same results in Africa and\r\nAsia; and the result would be that the entire globe, from pole to\r\npole, must have rolled for days, years, or centuries, wrapped in a\r\ncontinuous easing, mantle, or shroud of ice, under which all\r\nvegetable and animal life must have utterly perished.\r\n\r\n[1. \"Geology of Brazil,\" p. 488.]\r\n\r\n{p. 39}\r\n\r\nAnd we are not without evidences that the drift-deposits are found in\r\nAfrica. We know that they extend in Europe to the Mediterranean. The\r\n\"Journal of the Geographical Society\" (British) has a paper by George\r\nMan, F. G. S., on the geology of Morocco, in which he says:\r\n\r\n\"Glacial moraines may be seen on this range nearly eight thousand\r\nfeet above the sea, forming gigantic ridges and mounds of porphyritic\r\nblocks, in some places damming up the ravines, and at the foot of\r\nAtlas are enormous mounds of bowlders.\"\r\n\r\nThese mounds oftentimes rise two thousand feet above the level of the\r\nplain, and, according to Mr. Man, were produced by glaciers.\r\n\r\nWe shall see, hereafter, that the sands bordering Egypt belong to the\r\nDrift age. The diamond-bearing gravels of South Africa extend to\r\nwithin twenty-two degrees of the equator.\r\n\r\nIt is even a question whether that great desolate land, the Desert of\r\nSahara, covering a third of the Continent of Africa, is not the\r\ndirect result of this signal catastrophe.

Haynes tells us\r\nthat drift-deposits are found in the Desert of Sahara, and that--\r\n\r\n\"In the _bottoms_ of the dry ravines, or wadys, which pierce the\r\nhills that bound the valley of the Nile, I have found numerous\r\nspecimens of flint axes of the type of St. Acheul, which have been\r\nadjudged to be true palæolithic implements by some of the most\r\neminent cultivators of prehistoric science.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe sand and gravel of Sahara are underlaid by a deposit of clay.\r\n\r\nBayard Taylor describes in the center of Africa\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Palæolithic Implements of the Valley of the Delaware,\"\r\nCambridge, 1881.]\r\n\r\n{p. 40}\r\n\r\ngreat plains of coarse gravel, dotted with gray granite bowlders.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the United States Professor Winchell shows that the drift-deposits\r\n_extend to the Gulf of Mexico_. At Jackson, in Southern Alabama, be\r\nfound deposits of pebbles one hundred feet in thickness.[2]\r\n\r\nIf there are no drift-deposits except where the great ice-sheet\r\nground them out of the rocks, then a shroud of death once wrapped the\r\nentire globe, and _all life ceased_.\r\n\r\nBut we know that all life,--vegetable, animal, and human,--is derived\r\nfrom pre-glacial sources; therefore animal, vegetable, and human life\r\ndid not perish in the Drift age; therefore an ice-sheet did not wrap\r\nthe world in its death-pall; therefore the drift-deposits of the\r\ntropics were not due to an ice-sheet; therefore the drift-deposits of\r\nthe rest of the world were not due to ice-sheets: therefore we must\r\nlook elsewhere for their origin.\r\n\r\nThere is no escaping these conclusions. Agassiz himself says,\r\ndescribing the Glacial age:\r\n\r\n\"All the springs were dried up; the rivers ceased to flow. To the\r\nmovements of a numerous and animated creation _succeeded the silence\r\nof death_.\"\r\n\r\nIf the verdure was covered with ice a mile in thickness, all animals\r\nthat lived on vegetation of any kind must have perished;\r\nconsequently, all carnivores which lived on these must have ceased to\r\nexist; and man himself, without animal or vegetable food, must have\r\ndisappeared for ever.\r\n\r\nA writer, describing Greenland wrapped in such an ice-sheet, says\r\n\r\n[1. \"Travels in Africa,\" p. 188.\r\n\r\n2. \"Sketches of Creation,\" pp. 222, 223.]\r\n\r\n{p. 41}\r\n\r\n\"The whole interior seems to be buried beneath a great depth of snow\r\nand ice, which loads up the valleys and wraps over the hills. The\r\nscene opening to view in the interior is desolate in the\r\nextreme--nothing but one dead, dreary expanse of white, so far as the\r\neye can reach--_no living creature frequents this wilderness--neither\r\nbird, beast, nor insect_. The silence, deep as death, is broken only\r\nwhen the roaring storm arises to sweep before it the pitiless,\r\nblinding snow.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAnd yet the glacialists would have us believe that Brazil and Africa,\r\nand the whole globe, were once wrapped in such a shroud of death!\r\n\r\nHere, then, in conclusion, are the evidences that the deposits of the\r\nDrift are not due to continental ice-sheets:\r\n\r\nI. The present ice-sheets of the remote north create no such deposits\r\nand make no such markings.\r\n\r\nII. A vast continental elevation of land-surfaces at the north was\r\nnecessary for the ice to slide down, and this did not exist.\r\n\r\nIII. The ice-sheet, if it made the Drift markings, must have scored\r\nthe rocks going up-hill, while it did not score them going down-hill.\r\n\r\nIV. If the cold formed the ice and the ice formed the Drift, why is\r\nthere no Drift in the coldest regions of the earth, where there must\r\nhave been ice?\r\n\r\nV. Continental ice-belts, reaching to 40° of latitude, would have\r\nexterminated all tropical vegetation. It was not exterminated,\r\ntherefore such ice-sheets could not have existed.\r\n\r\nVI. The Drift is found in the equatorial regions of the world. If it\r\nwas produced by an ice-sheet in those regions, all pre-glacial forms\r\nof life must have perished; but they did not perish; therefore the\r\nice-sheet could not\r\n\r\n[1. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" April, 1874, p. 646.]\r\n\r\n{p. 42}\r\n\r\nhave covered these regions, and could not have produced the\r\ndrift-deposits there found.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the Drift is _not_ found where ice must have been, and _is_\r\nfound where ice could not have been; the conclusion, therefore, is\r\nirresistible that the Drift is not due to ice.\r\n\r\n{p. 43}\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                  THE DRIFT A GIGANTIC CATASTROPHE.\r\n\r\nIN the first place, the Drift fell upon a fair and lovely world, a\r\nworld far better adapted to give happiness to its inhabitants than\r\nthis storm-tossed planet on which we now live, with its endless\r\nbattle between heat and cold, between sun and ice.\r\n\r\nThe pre-glacial world was a garden, a paradise; not excessively warm\r\nat the equator, and yet with so mild and equable a climate that the\r\nplants we now call tropical flourished within the present Arctic\r\nCircle. If some future daring navigator reaches the north pole and\r\nfinds solid land there, he will probably discover in the rocks at his\r\nfeet the fossil remains of the oranges and bananas of the pre-glacial\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThat the reader may not think this an extravagant statement, let me\r\ncite a few authorities.\r\n\r\nA recent writer says:\r\n\r\n\"This was, indeed, for America, _the golden age_ of animals and\r\nplants, and in all respects but one--the absence of man--the country\r\nwas more interesting and picturesque than now. We must imagine,\r\ntherefore, that the hills and valleys about the present site of New\r\nYork were covered with noble trees, and a dense undergrowth of\r\nspecies, for the most part different from those now living there; and\r\nthat these were the homes and feeding-grounds of many kinds of\r\nquadrupeds and birds, which have long since become extinct. The broad\r\nplain which sloped gently seaward from the highlands must have been\r\n\r\n{p. 44}\r\n\r\ncovered with a sub-tropical forest of-giant trees and tangled vines\r\nteeming with animal life. This state of things doubtless continued\r\nthrough many thousands of years, but ultimately a change came over\r\nthe fair face of Nature more complete and terrible than we have\r\nlanguage to describe.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAnother says:\r\n\r\n\"At the close of the Tertiary age, which ends the long series of\r\ngeological epochs previous to the Quaternary, the landscape of Europe\r\nhad, in the main, assumed its modern appearance. The middle era of\r\nthis age--the Miocene--was characterized by tropical plants, a varied\r\nand imposing fauna, and a genial climate, so extended as to nourish\r\nforests of beeches, maples, _walnuts_, poplars, and _magnolias in\r\nGreenland and Spitzbergen_, while an exotic vegetation hid the\r\nexuberant valleys of England.\"[2]\r\n\r\nDr. Dawson says:\r\n\r\n\"This delightful climate was not confined to the present temperate or\r\ntropical regions. It extended to the very shores of the Arctic Sea.\r\nIn _North_ Greenland, at Atane-Kerdluk, in latitude 70° north, at an\r\nelevation of more than a thousand feet above the sea, were found the\r\nremains of beeches, oaks, pines, poplars, maples, _walnuts,\r\nmagnolias, limes_, and _vines_. The remains of similar plants were\r\nfound in Spitzbergen, in latitude 78° 56'.\"[3]\r\n\r\nDr. Dawson continues:\r\n\r\n\"Was the Miocene period on the whole a better age of the world than\r\nthat in which we live? In some respects it was. Obviously, there was\r\nin the northern hemisphere a vast surface of land under a mild and\r\nequable climate, and clothed with a rich and varied vegetation. Had\r\nwe lived in the Miocene we might have sat under our own vine and\r\nfig-tree equally in Greenland and Spitzbergen and in those more\r\nsouthern climes to which this\r\n\r\n[1. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" October, 1878, p. 648.\r\n\r\n2.

Some reasons have been adduced for\r\nthe belief that in the Miocene and Eocene there were intervals of\r\ncold climate; but the evidence of this may be merely local and\r\nexceptional, and does not interfere with the broad characteristics of\r\nthe age.\"[1]\r\n\r\nSir Edward Belcher brought away from the dreary shores of Wellington\r\nChannel (latitude 75° 32' north) portions of a tree which there can\r\nbe no doubt whatever had actually grown where be found it. The roots\r\nwere in place, in a frozen mass of earth, the stump standing upright\r\nwhere it was probably overtaken by the great winter.[2] Trees have\r\nbeen found, _in situ_, on Prince Patrick's Island, in latitude 76°\r\n12' north, _four feet in circumference_. They were so old that the\r\nwood had lost its combustible quality, and refused to burn. Mr.\r\nGeikie thinks that it is possible these trees were pre-glacial, and\r\nbelonged to the Miocene age. They may have been the remnants of the\r\ngreat forests which clothed that far northern region when the\r\nso-called glacial age came on and brought the Drift.\r\n\r\nWe shall see hereafter that man, possibly civilized man, dwelt in\r\nthis fair and glorious world--this world that knew no frost, no cold,\r\nno ice, no snow; that he had dwelt in it for thousands of years; that\r\nhe witnessed the appalling and sudden calamity which fell upon it;\r\nand that he has preserved the memory of this catastrophe to the\r\npresent day, in a multitude of myths and legends scattered all over\r\nthe face of the habitable earth.\r\n\r\nBut was it sudden? Was it a catastrophe?\r\n\r\nAgain I call the witnesses to the stand, for I ask you, good reader,\r\nto accept nothing that is not _proved_.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, was it sudden?\r\n\r\n[1. \"Earth and Man,\" p. 264.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Last of the Arctic Voyages,\" vol. i, p. 380.]\r\n\r\n{p. 46}\r\n\r\nOne writer says:\r\n\r\n\"The glacial action, in the opinion of the land-glacialists, was\r\nlimited to a _definite period_, and operated _simultaneously_ over a\r\nvast area.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\"The drift was accumulated where it is by some violent action.\"[2]\r\n\r\nLouis Figuier says:\r\n\r\n\"The two cataclysms of which we have spoken surprised Europe at the\r\nmoment of the development of an important creation. The whole scope\r\nof animated nature, the evolution of animals, was _suddenly arrested_\r\nin that part of our hemisphere over which these gigantic convulsions\r\nspread, followed by the brief but sudden submersion of entire\r\ncontinents. Organic life had scarcely recovered from the violent\r\nshock, when a second, and perhaps severer blow assailed it. The\r\nnorthern and central parts of Europe, the vast countries which extend\r\nfrom Scandinavia to the Mediterranean and the Danube, were visited by\r\na period of sudden and severe cold; the temperature of the polar\r\nregions seized them. The plains of Europe, but now ornamented by the\r\nluxurious vegetation developed by the heat of a burning climate, the\r\nboundless pastures on which herds of great elephants, the active\r\nhorse, the robust hippopotamus, and great carnivorous animals grazed\r\nand roamed, became covered with a mantle of ice and snow.\"[3]\r\n\r\nM. Ch. Martins says:\r\n\r\n\"The most violent convulsions of the solid and liquid elements appear\r\nto have been themselves only the effects due to a cause much more\r\npowerful than the mere expansion of the pyrosphere; and it is\r\nnecessary to recur, in order to explain them, to some new and bolder\r\nhypothesis than has Yet been hazarded. Some philosophers have belief\r\n\r\n[1. American Cyclopædia,\" vol. vi, p. 114.\r\n\r\n2.

They admit _that the poles have not always been\r\nas they are now_, and that _some terrible shock displaced them_,\r\nchanging at the same time the inclination of the axis of the rotation\r\nof the earth.\"[1]\r\n\r\nLouis Figuier says:\r\n\r\n\"We can not doubt, after such testimony, of the existence, in the\r\nfrozen north, of the almost entire remains of the mammoth. The\r\nanimals seem to have _perished suddenly; enveloped in ice at the\r\nmoment of their death_, their bodies have been preserved from\r\ndecomposition by the continual action of the cold.\"[2]\r\n\r\nCuvier says, speaking of the bodies of the quadrupeds which the ice\r\nhad seized, and which have been preserved, with their hair, flesh,\r\nand skin, down to our own times:\r\n\r\n\"If they had not been frozen as soon as killed, putrefaction would\r\nhave decomposed them; and, on the other hand, this eternal frost\r\ncould not have previously prevailed in the place where they died, for\r\nthey could not have lived in such a temperature. It was, therefore,\r\n_at the same instant when these animals perished that the country\r\nthey inhabited was rendered glacial_. These events must have been\r\n_sudden, instantaneous, and without any gradation_.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that the Drift fell upon a land covered\r\nwith forests, and that the trunks of the trees were swept into the\r\nmass of clay and gravel, where they are preserved to this day.\r\n\r\nMr. Whittlesey gives an account of a log found _forty feet below the\r\nsurface_, in a bed of blue clay, resting\r\n\r\n[1. \"The World before the Deluge,\" p. 463.\r\n\r\n2.

It is evident, on\r\nthe contrary, that it was dry land, inhabited land, land embowered in\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nOn top of the Norwich crag, in England, are found the remains of an\r\nancient forest, \"showing stumps of trees standing erect with their\r\nroots penetrating an ancient soil.\"[4] In this soil occur the remains\r\nof many extinct species of animals, together with those of others\r\nstill living; among these may be mentioned the hippopotamus, three\r\nspecies of elephant, the mammoths, rhinoceros, bear, horse, Irish\r\nelk, etc.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland remains of trees have been found in sand-beds below the\r\ntill.[5]\r\n\r\nDr. Dawson found a hardened peaty bed under the bowlder-clay, in\r\nCanada, which \"contained many small roots and branches, apparently of\r\nconiferous trees allied to the spruces.\"[6] Mr. C.

Two elephant-tasks were got at a depth of seventeen\r\nand a half feet from the surface. . . . The mammalian remains,\r\nobtained from this quarry, occurred in a peaty layer between two thin\r\nbeds of sand and gravel which lay beneath a mass of 'till,' and\r\n_rested directly on the sandstone rock_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\"Remains of the mammoth have been met with at Chapelhall, near\r\nAirdrie, where they occurred in a bed of laminated sand, _underlying_\r\n'till.' Reindeer-antlers have also been discovered in other\r\nlocalities, as in the valley of the Endrick, about four miles from\r\nLoch Lomond, where an antler was found associated with marine shells,\r\nnear the bottom of a bed of blue clay, and _close to the underlying\r\nrock_--the blue clay being covered with twelve feet of tough, stony\r\nclay.\"[2]\r\n\r\nProfessor Winchell says\r\n\r\n\"Buried tree-trunks are often exhumed from the glacial drift at a\r\ndepth of from twenty to _sixty feet from the surface_. Dr. Locke has\r\npublished an account of a mass of buried drift-wood at Salem, Ohio,\r\n_forty-three feet below the surface_, imbedded in ancient mud. The\r\nmuseum of the University of Michigan contains several fragments of\r\nwell-preserved tree-trunks exhumed from wells in the vicinity of Ann\r\nArbor. Such occurrences are by no means uncommon.

The Great Ice Age,\" p. 149.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 150.\r\n\r\n3. Winchell, \"Sketches of Creation,\" p. 259.]\r\n\r\n{p. 51}\r\n\r\nbreaking up the forests, and overwhelming the trunks and branches of\r\nthe trees in its masses of _débris_.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the next question: Was it an extraordinary event, a\r\nworld-shaking cataclysm?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question is plain: The Drift marks probably the\r\nmost awful convulsion and catastrophe that has ever fallen upon the\r\nglobe. The deposit of these continental masses of clay, sand, and\r\ngravel was but one of the features of the apalling event. In addition\r\nto this the earth at the same time was cleft with great cracks or\r\nfissures, which reached down through many miles of the planet's crust\r\nto the central fires and released the boiling rocks imprisoned in its\r\nbosom, and these poured to the surface, as igneous, intrusive, or\r\ntrap-rocks. Where the great breaks were not deep enough to reach the\r\ncentral fires, they left mighty fissures in the surface, which, in\r\nthe Scandinavian regions, are known as _fiords_, and which constitute\r\na striking feature of the scenery of these northern lands; they are\r\ngreat canals--hewn, as it were, in the rock--with high walls\r\npenetrating from the sea far into the interior of the land. They are\r\nfound in Great Britain, Maine, Nova Scotia, Labrador, Greenland, and\r\non the Western coast of North America.\r\n\r\nDavid Dale Owen tells us that the outburst of trap-rock at the Dalles\r\nof the St. Croix came up _through open fissures_, breaking the\r\ncontinuity of strata, without tilting them into inclined planes.\"[1]\r\nIt would appear as if the earth, in the first place, cracked into\r\ndeep clefts, and the igneous matter within took advantage of these\r\nbreaks to rise to the surface. It caught masses of the sandstone in\r\nits midst and hardened around them.\r\n\r\nThese great clefts seem to be, as Owen says, \"lines\r\n\r\n[1. \"Geological Survey of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota,\" p. 142.]\r\n\r\n{p. 52}\r\n\r\nradiating southwestwardly from Lake Superior, as if that was the seat\r\nof the disturbance which caused them.\"[1]\r\n\r\nMoreover, when we come to examine the face of the rocks on which the\r\nDrift came, we do not find them merely smoothed and ground down, as\r\nwe might suppose a great, heavy mass of ice moving slowly over them\r\nwould leave them. There was something more than this. There was\r\nsomething, (whatever it was,) that fell upon them with awful force\r\nand literally _smashed_ them, pounding, beating, pulverizing them,\r\nand turning one layer of mighty rock over upon another, and\r\nscattering them in the wildest confusion. We can not conceive of\r\nanything terrestrial that, let loose upon the bare rocks to-day,\r\nwould or could produce such results.\r\n\r\nGeikie says:\r\n\r\n\"When the 'till' is removed from the underlying rocks, these almost\r\ninvariably show either a well-smoothed, polished, and striated\r\nsurface, or else a _highly confused, broken, and smashed_\r\nappearance.\"[2]\r\n\r\nGratacap says:\r\n\r\n\"'_Crushed ledges_' designate those plicated, overthrown, or curved\r\nexposures where parallel rocks, as talcose schist, usually vertical,\r\nare bent and fractured, _as if by a maul like force, battering them\r\nfrom above_. The strata are oftentimes tumbled over upon a cliff-side\r\nlike a row of books, and rest upon heaps of fragments broken away by\r\nthe strain upon the bottom layers, or _crushed_ off from their\r\nexposed layers.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. O. Fisher, F. G. S., says he\r\n\r\n\"Finds the covering beds to consist of two members--a lower one,\r\nentirely destitute of organic remains, and\r\n\r\n[1. \"Geological Survey of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota,\" p. 147.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 73.\r\n\r\n3. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" January, 1878, p. 326.]\r\n\r\n{p. 53}\r\n\r\ngenerally unstratified, which has often been _forcibly_ INDENTED\r\n_into the bed beneath it_, sometimes exhibiting slickensides at the\r\njunction. There is evidence of this lower member having been pushed\r\nor dragged over the surface, from higher to lower levels, _in a\r\nplastic condition_; on which account he has named it 'The Trail'.\"[1]\r\n\r\nNow, all these details are incompatible with the idea of ice-action.\r\nWhat condition of ice can be imagined that would _smash_ rocks, that\r\nwould beat them like a maul, that would _indent_ them?\r\n\r\nAnd when we pass from the underlying rocks to the \"till\" itself, we\r\nfind the evidences of tremendous force exerted in the wildest and\r\nmost tumultuous manner.\r\n\r\nWhen the clay and stones were being deposited on those crushed and\r\npounded rocks, they seem to have picked up the _detritus_ of the\r\nearth in great masses, and whirled it wildly in among their own\r\nmaterial, and deposited it in what are called \"the intercalated\r\nbeds.\" It would seem as if cyclonic winds had been at work among the\r\nmass. While the \"till\" itself is devoid of fossils, \"the intercalated\r\nbeds\" often contain them. Whatever was in or on the soil was seized\r\nupon, carried up into the air, then cast down, and mingled among the\r\n\"till.\"\r\n\r\nJames Geikie says, speaking of these intercalated beds:\r\n\r\n\"They are twisted, bent, crumpled, and confused _often in the wildest\r\nmanner_. Layers of clay, sand, and gravel, which were probably\r\ndeposited in a nearly horizontal plane, are puckered into folds and\r\nsharply curved into vertical positions. I have seen whole beds of\r\nsand and clay which had all the appearance of having been pushed\r\nforward bodily for some distance the bedding assuming _the most\r\nfantastic appearance_. . . .

But a flood which could bring down so great a mass would certainly\r\nhave swept away the comparatively light and movable gravel below. We\r\ncan not, therefore, account for the phenomena by aqueous action,\r\nbecause a flood which would deposit the sandstone blocks would remove\r\nthe underlying gravel, and a flood which would deposit the gravel\r\nwould not remove the blocks. The _Deus ex machinâ_ has not only been\r\ncalled in most unnecessarily, but when examined turns out to be but\r\nan idol, after all.\"\r\n\r\nSir John thinks that floating ice might have dropped these blocks;\r\nbut then, on the other hand, M. C. d'Orbigny observes that all the\r\nfossils found in these beds belong to fresh-water or land animals.\r\nThe sea has had nothing to do with them. And D'Orbigny thinks the\r\nDrift came from cataclysms.\r\n\r\nM. Boucher de Perthes, the first and most exhaustive investigator of\r\nthese deposits, has always been of opinion that the drift-gravels of\r\nFrance were deposited by _violent cataclysms_.[1]\r\n\r\nThis view seems to be confirmed by the fact that the gravel-beds in\r\nwhich these remains of man and extinct animals are found lie at an\r\nelevation of from eighty to _two hundred feet above the present\r\nwater-levels of the valleys_.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock says:\r\n\r\n\"Our second difficulty still remains--namely, the height at which the\r\nupper-level gravels stand above the\r\n\r\n[1. \"Mém. Soc. d'Em. l'Abbeville,\" 1861, p. 475.]\r\n\r\n{p. 56}\r\n\r\npresent water-line. We can not wonder that these beds have generally\r\nbeen attributed to violent cataclysms.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn America, in Britain, and in Europe, the glacial deposits made\r\nclean work of nearly all animal life. The great mammalia, too large\r\nto find shelter in caverns, were some of them utterly swept away,\r\nwhile others never afterward returned to those regions. In like\r\nmanner palæolithic man, man of the rude and unpolished flint\r\nimplements, the contemporary of the great mammalia, the mammoth, the\r\nhippopotamus, and the rhinoceros, was also stamped out, and the\r\ncave-deposits of Europe show that there was a long interval before be\r\nreappeared in those regions. The same forces, whatever they were,\r\nwhich \"smashed\" and \"pounded\" and \"contorted\" the surface of the\r\nearth, crushed man and his gigantic associates out of existence.[2]\r\n\r\nBut in Siberia, where, as we have seen, some of the large mammalia\r\nwere caught and entombed in ice, and preserved even to our own day,\r\nthere was no \"smashing\" and \"crushing\" of the earth, and many escaped\r\nthe snow-sheets, and their posterity survived in that region for long\r\nages after the Glacial period, and are supposed only to have\r\ndisappeared in quite recent times. In fact, within the last two or\r\nthree years a Russian exile declared that he had seen a group of\r\nliving mammoths in a wild valley in a remote portion of that\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nThese, then, good reader, to recapitulate, are points that seem to be\r\nestablished:\r\n\r\nI. The Drift marked a world-convulsing catastrophe. It was a gigantic\r\nand terrible event. It was something quite out of the ordinary course\r\nof Nature's operations.\r\n\r\nII. It was sudden and overwhelming.\r\n\r\n[1. \"Prehistoric Times,\" p. 372.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 466.]\r\n\r\n{p. 57}\r\n\r\nIII. It fell upon land areas, much like our own in geographical\r\nconformation; a forest-covered, inhabited land; a glorious land,\r\nbasking in perpetual summer, in the midst of a golden age.\r\n\r\nLet us go a step further.\r\n\r\n{p. 58}\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                      GREAT HEAT A PREREQUISITE.\r\n\r\nNow, it will be observed that the principal theories assigned for the\r\nDrift go upon the hypothesis that it was produced by extraordinary\r\nmasses of ice--ice as icebergs, ice as glaciers, or ice in\r\ncontinental sheets. The scientists admit that immediately preceding\r\nthis Glacial age the climate was mild and equable, and these great\r\nformations of ice did not exist. But none of them pretend to say how\r\nthe ice came or what caused it. Even Agassiz, the great apostle of\r\nthe ice-origin of Drift, is forced to confess:\r\n\r\n\"We have, as yet, no clew to the source of this great and _sudden_\r\nchange of climate. Various suggestions have been made--among others,\r\nthat formerly the inclination of the earth's axis was greater, or\r\nthat a submersion of the continents under water might have produced a\r\ndecided increase of cold; but none of these explanations are\r\nsatisfactory, and science has yet to find any cause which accounts\r\nfor all the phenomena connected with it.\"[1]\r\n\r\nSome have imagined that a change in the position of the earth's axis\r\nof rotation, due to the elevation of extensive mountain-tracts\r\nbetween the poles and the equator, might have caused a degree of cold\r\nsufficient to produce the phenomena of the Drift; but Geikie says--\r\n\r\n\"It has been demonstrated that the protuberance of the earth at the\r\nequator so vastly exceeds that of any\r\n\r\n[1. \"Geological Sketches,\" p. 210.]\r\n\r\n{p. 59}\r\n\r\npossible elevation of mountain-masses between the equator and the\r\npoles, that any slight changes which may have resulted from such\r\ngeological causes could have had only an infinitesimal effect upon\r\nthe. general climate of the globe.\"[1]\r\n\r\nLet us reason together:--\r\n\r\nThe ice, say the glacialists, caused the Drift. What caused the ice?\r\nGreat rains and snows, they say, falling on the face of the land.\r\nGranted. What is rain in the first instance? Vapor, clouds. Whence\r\nare the clouds derived? From the waters of the earth, principally\r\nfrom the oceans. How is the water in the clouds transferred to the\r\nclouds from the seas? By evaporation. What is necessary to\r\nevaporation? _Heat_.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the sequence:\r\n\r\nIf there is no heat, there is no evaporation; no evaporation, no\r\nclouds; no clouds, no rain; no rain, no ice; no ice, no Drift.\r\n\r\nBut, as the Glacial age meant ice on a stupendous scale, then it must\r\nhave been preceded by heat on a stupendous scale.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall asserts that the ancient glaciers indicate the\r\naction of heat as much as cold. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Cold will not produce glaciers. You may have the bitterest northeast\r\nwinds here in London throughout the winter without a single flake of\r\nsnow. Cold must have the fitting object to operate upon, and this\r\nobject--the aqueous vapor of the air--is the direct product of heat.\r\nLet us put this glacier question in another form: the latent heat of\r\naqueous vapor, at the temperature of its production in the tropics,\r\nis about 1,000° Fahr., for the latent heat augments as the\r\ntemperature of evaporation descends.\r\n\r\nA pound of water thus vaporized at the equator has absorbed one\r\nthousand times the quantity of heat which\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 98.]\r\n\r\n{p. 60}\r\n\r\nwould raise a pound of the liquid one degree in temperature. . . . It\r\nis perfectly manifest that by weakening the sun's action, either\r\nthrough a defect of emission or by the steeping of the entire solar\r\nsystem in space of a low temperature, _we should be cutting off the\r\nglaciers at their source_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nMr. Croll says:\r\n\r\n\"Heat, to produce _evaporation_, is just as essential to the\r\naccumulation of snow and ice as cold to produce condensation.\"[2]\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock says:\r\n\r\n\"Paradoxical as it may appear, the primary cause of the Glacial epoch\r\nmay be, after all, _an elevation of the temperature in the tropics_,\r\ncausing a greater amount of evaporation in the equatorial regions,\r\nand consequently a greater supply of the raw material of snow in the\r\ntemperate regions during the winter months.\"[3]\r\n\r\nSo necessary did it appear that heat must have come from some source\r\nto vaporize all this vast quantity of water, that one gentleman,\r\nProfessor Frankland,[4] suggested that the ocean must have been\r\nrendered hot by the internal fires of the earth, and thus the water\r\nwas sent up in clouds to fall in ice and snow; but Sir John Lubbock\r\ndisposes of this theory by showing that the fauna of the seas during\r\nthe Glacial period possessed an Arctic character. We can not conceive\r\nof Greenland shells and fish and animals thriving in an ocean nearly\r\nat the boiling-point.\r\n\r\nA writer in \"The Popular Science Monthly\"[5] says:\r\n\r\n\"These evidences of vast accumulations of ice and snow on the borders\r\nof the Atlantic have led some theorists\r\n\r\n[1. \"Heat considered as a Mode of Motion,\" p. 192.\r\n\r\n2. \"Climate and Time,\" p. 74.\r\n\r\n3. \"Prehistoric Times,\" p. 401.\r\n\r\n4. \"Philosophical Magazine,\" 1864, p. 328.\r\n\r\n5. July, 1876, p. 288.]\r\n\r\n{p. 61}\r\n\r\nto suppose that the Ice period was attended, if not in part caused,\r\nby a far more abundant evaporation from the surface of the Atlantic\r\nthan takes place at present; and it has even been conjectured that\r\nsubmarine volcanoes in the tropics might have loaded the atmosphere\r\nwith an unusual amount of moisture. This speculation seems to me,\r\nhowever, both improbable and superfluous; improbable, because no\r\ntraces of any such cataclysm have been discovered, and it is more\r\nthan doubtful whether the generation of steam in the tropics, however\r\nlarge the quantity, would produce glaciation of the polar regions.\r\nThe ascent of steam and heated air loaded with vapor to the altitude\r\nof refrigeration would, as it seems to me, result in the rapid\r\nradiation of the heat into space, and the local precipitation of\r\nunusual quantities of rain; and the effect of such a catastrophe\r\nwould be slowly propagated and feebly felt in the Arctic and\r\nAntarctic regions.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the magnitude of the ice-sheets which, it is claimed\r\nby the glacialists, covered the continents during the Drift age, it\r\nbecomes evident that a vast proportion of the waters of the ocean\r\nmust have been evaporated and carried into the air, and thence cast\r\ndown as snow and rain. Mr. Thomas Belt, in a recent number of the\r\n\"Quarterly Journal of Science,\" argues that the formation of\r\nice-sheets at the poles _must have lowered the level of the oceans of\r\nthe world two thousand-feet!_\r\n\r\nThe mathematician can figure it out for himself: Take the area of the\r\ncontinents down to, say, latitude 40°, on both sides of the equator;\r\nsuppose this area to be covered by an ice-sheet averaging, say, two\r\nmiles in thickness; reduce this mass of ice to cubic feet of water,\r\nand estimate what proportion of the ocean would be required to be\r\nvaporized to create it. Calculated upon any basis, and it follows\r\nthat the level of the ocean must have been greatly lowered.\r\n\r\nWhat a vast, inconceivable accession of _heat_ to our\r\n\r\n{p. 62}\r\n\r\natmosphere was necessary to lift this gigantic layer of ocean-water\r\nout of its bed and into the clouds!\r\n\r\nThe ice, then, was not the cause of the cataclysm; it was simply one\r\nof the secondary consequences.\r\n\r\nWe must look, then, behind the ice-age for some cause that would\r\nprodigiously increase the _heat_ of our atmosphere, and, when we have\r\nfound _that_, we shall have discovered the cause of the\r\ndrift-deposits as well as of the ice.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the whole stupendous problem is, therefore, heat, not\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n{p. 63}\r\n\r\n                               PART II.\r\n\r\n                              The Comet.\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                      A COMET CAUSED THE DRIFT.\r\n\r\nNow, good reader, we have reasoned together up to this point. To be\r\nsure, I have done most of the talking, while you have indulged in\r\nwhat the Rev. Sydney Smith called, speaking of Lord Macaulay,\r\n\"brilliant flashes of silence.\"\r\n\r\nBut I trust we agree thus far that neither water nor ice caused the\r\nDrift. Water and ice were doubtless associated with it, but neither\r\nproduced it.\r\n\r\nWhat, now, are the elements of the problem to be solved?\r\n\r\nFirst, we are to find something that instantaneously increased to a\r\nvast extent the heat of our planet, vaporized the seas, and furnished\r\nmaterial for deluges of rain, and great storms of snow, and\r\naccumulations of ice north and south of the equator and in the high\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we are to find something that, _coming from above_,\r\nsmashed, pounded, and crushed \"as with a maul,\" and rooted up as with\r\na plow, the gigantic rocks of the surface, and scattered them for\r\nhundreds of miles from their original location.\r\n\r\n{p. 64}\r\n\r\nThirdly, we are to find something which brought to the planet vast,\r\nincalculable masses of clay and gravel, which did not contain any of\r\nthe earth's fossils; which, like the witches of Macbeth,\r\n\r\n     Look not like th' inhabitants of earth,\r\n     And yet are on it; \"\r\n\r\nwhich are marked after a fashion which can not be found anywhere else\r\non earth; produced in a laboratory which has not yet been discovered\r\non the planet.\r\n\r\nFourthly, we are to find something that would produce cyclonic\r\nconvulsions upon a scale for which the ordinary operations of nature\r\nfurnish us no parallel.\r\n\r\nFifthly, we are to find some external force so mighty that it would\r\ncrack the crust of the globe like an eggshell, lining its surface\r\nwith great rents and seams, through which the molten interior boiled\r\nup to the light.\r\n\r\nWould a comet meet all these prerequisites?\r\n\r\nI think it would.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed in regular order.\r\n\r\n{p. 65}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                           WHAT IS A COMET?\r\n\r\nIN the first place, are comets composed of solid, liquid, or gaseous\r\nsubstances? Are they something, or the next thing to nothing?\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by some that they are made of the most\r\nattenuated gases, so imponderable that if the earth were to pass\r\nthrough one of them we would be unconscious of the contact. Others\r\nhave imagined them to be mere smoke-wreaths, faint mists, so rarefied\r\nthat the substance of one a hundred million miles long could, like\r\nthe genie in the Arabian story, be inclosed in one of Solomon's brass\r\nbottles.\r\n\r\nBut the results of recent researches contradict these views:\r\n\r\nPadre Secchi, of Rome, observed, in Donati's comet, of 1858, from the\r\n15th to the 22d of October, that the nucleus threw out intermittingly\r\nfrom itself appendages having the form of brilliant, coma-shaped\r\nmasses of incandescent substance twisted violently backward. He\r\naccounts for these very remarkable changes of configuration by the\r\ninfluence first of the sun's heat upon the comet's substance as it\r\napproached toward perihelion, and afterward by the production in the\r\nluminous emanations thus generated of enormous tides and perturbation\r\nderangements. Some of the most conspicuous of these luminous\r\ndevelopments occurred on October 11th, when the comet was at its\r\nnearest approach to the earth, and on\r\n\r\n{p. 66}\r\n\r\nOctober 17th, when it was nearest to the planet Venus. He has no\r\ndoubt that the close neighborhood of the earth and Venus at those\r\ntimes was the effective cause of the sudden changes of aspect, and\r\nthat those changes of aspect may be accepted _as proof that the\r\ncomet's substance consists of \"really ponderable material.\"_\r\n\r\nMr. Lockyer used the spectroscope to analyze the light of Coggia's\r\ncomet, and he established beyond question that--\r\n\r\n\"Some of the rays of the comet were sent either from _solid\r\nparticles_, or from vapor in a state of _very high condensation_, and\r\nalso that beyond doubt other portions of the comet's light issue from\r\nthe vapor _shining by its own inherent light_. The light coming from\r\nthe more dense constituents, and therefore giving a continuous\r\ncolored spectrum, was, however, deficient in blue rays, and was most\r\nprobably emitted _by material substance at the low red and yellow\r\nstages of incandescence_.\"\r\n\r\nPadre Secchi, at Rome, believed he saw in the comet \"carbon, or an\r\noxide of carbon, as the source of the bright luminous bands,\" and the\r\nAbbé Moigno asks whether this comet may not be, after all, \"_un\r\ngigantesque diamant volatilisé_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be the answer hereafter given to that question, the\r\nverdict of the spectroscope is clearly to the effect that the comet\r\nis made up of a _commingling of thin vapor and of denser particles_,\r\neither compressed into the _condition of solidification_, or into\r\nsome physical state approaching to that condition, and is therefore\r\nentirely in accordance with the notion formed on other grounds that\r\nthe nucleus of the comet is a _cluster of solid nodules or granules_,\r\nand that the luminous coma and tail are jets and jackets of vapor,\r\nassociated with the more dense ingredients, and _swaying and\r\nstreaming about them as heat and gravity, acting antagonistic ways,\r\ndetermine_.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1. \"Edinburgh Review,\" October, 1874, p. 210.]\r\n\r\n{p. 67}\r\n\r\nIf the comet shines by reflected light, it is pretty good evidence\r\nthat there must be some material substance there to reflect the light.\r\n\r\n\"A considerable portion of the light of the comet is, nevertheless,\r\nborrowed from the sun, for it has one property belonging to it that\r\nonly reflected light can manifest. It is capable of being polarized\r\nby prisms of double-refracting spar. Polarization of this character\r\nis _only possible_ when the light that is operated upon has already\r\nbeen reflected _from an imperfectly transparent medium_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThere is considerable difference of opinion as to whether the bead of\r\nthe comet is solid matter or inflammable gas.\r\n\r\n\"There is nearly always a point of superior brilliancy perceptible in\r\nthe comet's head, which is termed its nucleus, and it is necessarily\r\na matter of pressing interest to determine what this bright nucleus\r\nis; whether it is really a kernel of hard, solid substance, or merely\r\na whiff of somewhat more condensed vapor. Newton, from the first,\r\nmaintained that the comet is _made partly of solid substance_, and\r\n_partly of an investment of thin, elastic vapors_. If this is the\r\ncase, it is manifest that the central nodule of dense substance\r\nshould be capable of intercepting light when it passes in front of a\r\nmore distant luminary, such as a fixed star. Comets, on this account,\r\nhave been watched very narrowly whenever they have been making such a\r\npassage. On August 18, 1774, the astronomer Messier believed that he\r\nsaw a second bright star _burst into sight from behind the nucleus of\r\na comet which had concealed it the instant before_. Another observer,\r\nWartmann, in the year 1828, noticed that the light of an\r\neighth-magnitude star was _temporarily quenched as the nucleus of\r\nEncke's comet passed over it_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nOthers, again, have held that stars have been seen through the\r\ncomet's nucleus.\r\n\r\n[1. \"Edinburgh Review,\" October, 1874, p. 207.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 206.]\r\n\r\n{p. 68}\r\n\r\nAmédée Guillemin says:\r\n\r\n\"Comets have been observed whose heads, instead of being nebulous,\r\nhave presented the appearance of stars, with which, indeed, they have\r\nbeen confounded.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWhen Sir William Herschel discovered the planet Urania, he thought it\r\nwas a comet.\r\n\r\nMr. Richard A. Proctor says:\r\n\r\n\"The spectroscopic observations made by Mr. Huggins on the light of\r\nthree comets show that a certain portion, at least, of the light of\r\nthese objects _is inherent_. . . . The nucleus gave in each case\r\nthree bands of light, indicating that the substances of the nuclei\r\nconsisted of glowing vapor.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIn one case, the comet-head seemed, as in the case of the, comet\r\nexamined by Padre Secchi, to consist of pure carbon.\r\n\r\nIn the great work of Dr. H. Schellen, of Cologne, annotated by\r\nProfessor Huggins, we read:\r\n\r\n\"That the nucleus of a comet can not be in itself a dark and solid\r\nbody, such as the planets are, is proved by its great transparency;\r\nbut this does not preclude the possibility of its consisting of\r\n_innumerable solid particles_ separated from one another, which, when\r\nilluminated by the sun, give, by the reflection of the solar light,\r\nthe impression of a homogeneous mass. It has, therefore, been\r\nconcluded that comets are either composed of a substance which, like\r\ngas in a state of extreme rarefaction, is perfectly transparent, or\r\nof _small solid particles_ individually separated by intervening\r\nspaces through which the light of a star can pass without\r\nobstruction, and which, held together by mutual attraction, as well\r\nas by gravitation toward a denser central conglomeration, moves\r\nthrough space _like a cloud of dust_. In any case the connection\r\nlately noticed by Schiaparelli, between comets and meteoric\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Heavens,\" p. 239.\r\n\r\n2. Note to Guillemin's \"Heavens,\" p. 261.]\r\n\r\n{p. 69}\r\n\r\nshowers, seems to necessitate the supposition that in many comets a\r\nsimilar aggregation of particles seems to exist.\"[1]\r\n\r\nI can not better sum up the latest results of research than by giving\r\nDr. Schellen's words in the work just cited:\r\n\r\n\"By collating these various phenomena, the conviction can scarcely be\r\nresisted that the nuclei of comets not only emit their own light,\r\nwhich is that of a glowing gas, but also, together with the coma and\r\nthe tail, reflect the light of the sun. There seems nothing,\r\ntherefore, to contradict the theory that the mass of a comet may be\r\ncomposed of _minute solid bodies_, kept apart one from another in the\r\nsame way as the infinitesimal particles forming a cloud of dust or\r\nsmoke are held loosely together, and that, as the comet approaches\r\nthe sun, the most easily fusible constituents of these small bodies\r\nbecome wholly or partially vaporized, and in a condition of _white\r\nheat_ overtake the remaining solid particles, and surround the\r\nnucleus in a self-luminous cloud of glowing vapor.\"[2]\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the comet:\r\n\r\nFirst, a more or less solid nucleus, on fire, blazing, glowing.\r\n\r\nSecond, vast masses of gas heated to a white heat and enveloping the\r\nnucleus, and constituting the luminous head, which was in one case\r\nfifty times as large as the moon.\r\n\r\nThird, solid materials, constituting the tail (possibly the nucleus\r\nalso), which are ponderable, which reflect the sun's light, and are\r\ncarried along under the influence of the nucleus of the comet.\r\n\r\nFourth, possibly in the rear of all these, attenuated volumes of gas,\r\nprolonging the tail for great distances.\r\n\r\nWhat are these solid materials?\r\n\r\n[1. \"Spectrum Analysis,\" 1872.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 402.]\r\n\r\n{p. 70}\r\n\r\nStones, and sand, the finely comminuted particles of stones ground\r\noff by ceaseless attrition.\r\n\r\nWhat is the proof of this?\r\n\r\nSimply this: that it is now conceded that meteoric showers are shreds\r\nand patches of cometic matter, dropped from the tail; _and meteoric\r\nshowers are stones_.\r\n\r\n\"Schiaparelli considers meteors to be dispersed portions of the\r\ncomet's original substance; that is, of the substance with which the\r\ncomet entered the solar domain. Thus comets would come to be regarded\r\nas consisting of _a multitude of relatively minute masses_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nNow, what is the genesis of a comet? How did it come to be? How was\r\nit born?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there are many things which would connect them\r\nwith our planets.\r\n\r\nThey belong to the solar system; they revolve around the sun.\r\n\r\nSays Amédée Guillemin:\r\n\r\n\"Comets form a part of our solar system. Like the. planets, they\r\nrevolve about the sun, traversing with very variable velocities\r\nextremely elongated orbits.\"[2]\r\n\r\nWe shall see reason to believe that they contain the same kinds of\r\nsubstances of which the planets are composed.\r\n\r\nTheir orbits seem to be reminiscences of former planetary conditions:\r\n\r\n\"All the comets, having a period not exceeding seven years, travel in\r\nthe same direction around the sun as the planets. Among comets with\r\nperiods less than eighty years long, five sixths travel in the same\r\ndirection as the planets.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[1. \"American Cyclopædia,\" vol. v, p. 141.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Heavens,\" p. 239.\r\n\r\n3. American Cyclopedia,\" vol. v, p. 141.]\r\n\r\n{p. 71}\r\n\r\nIt is agreed that this globe of ours was at first a gaseous mass; as\r\nit cooled it condensed like cooling steam into a liquid mass; it\r\nbecame in time a molten globe of red-hot matter. As it cooled still\r\nfurther, a crust or shell formed around it, like the shell formed on\r\nan egg, and on this crust we dwell.\r\n\r\nWhile the crust is still plastic it shrinks as the mass within grows\r\nsmaller by further cooling, and the wrinkles so formed in the crust\r\nare the depths of the ocean and the elevations of the mountain-chains.\r\n\r\nBut as ages go on and the process of cooling progresses, the crust\r\nreaches a density when it supports itself, like a couple of great\r\narches; it no longer wrinkles; it no longer follows downward the\r\nreceding molten mass within; mountains cease to be formed; and at\r\nlength we have a red-hot ball revolving in a shell or crust, with a\r\nspace between the two, like the space between the dried and shrunken\r\nkernel of the nut and the nut itself.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes are always found on sea-shores or on islands. Why? Through\r\nbreaks in the earth the sea-water finds its way occasionally down\r\nupon the breast of the molten mass; it is at once converted into gas,\r\nsteam; and as it expands it blows itself out through the escape-pipe\r\nof the volcano; precisely as the gas formed by the gunpowder coming\r\nin contact with the fire of the percussion-cap, drives the ball out\r\nbefore it through the same passage by which it had entered. Hence,\r\nsome one has said, \"No water, no volcano.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the amount of water which so enters is small because of the\r\nsmallness of the cavity between the shell of the earth and the molten\r\nglobe within, this process is carried on upon a comparatively small\r\nscale, and is a safe one for the earth. But suppose the process of\r\ncooling to go on uninterruptedly until a vast space exists between the\r\n\r\n{p. 72}\r\n\r\ncrust and the core of the earth, and that some day a convulsion of\r\nthe surface creates a great chasm in the crust, and the ocean rushes\r\nin and fills up part of the cavity; a tremendous quantity of steam is\r\nformed, too great to escape by the aperture through which it entered,\r\nan explosion takes place, and the crust of the earth is blown into a\r\nmillion fragments.\r\n\r\nThe great molten ball within remains intact, though sorely torn; in\r\nits center is still the force we call gravity; the fragments of the\r\ncrust can not fly off into space; they are constrained to follow the\r\nmaster-power lodged in the ball, which now becomes the nucleus of a\r\ncomet, still blazing and burning, and vomiting flames, and wearing\r\nitself away. The catastrophe has disarranged its course, but it still\r\nrevolves in a prolonged orbit around the sun, carrying its broken\r\n_débris_ in a long trail behind it.\r\n\r\nThis _débris_ arranges itself in a regular order: the largest\r\nfragments are on or nearest the head; the smaller are farther away,\r\ndiminishing in regular gradation, until the farthest extremity, the\r\ntail, consists of sand, dust, and gases. There is a continual\r\nmovement of the particles of the tail, operated upon by the\r\nattraction and repulsion of the sun. The fragments collide and crash\r\nagainst each other; by a natural law each stone places itself so that\r\nits longest diameter coincides with the direction of the motion of\r\nthe comet; hence, as they scrape against each other they mark each\r\nother with lines or _striæ_, lengthwise of their longest diameter.\r\nThe fine dust ground out by these perpetual collisions does not go\r\noff into space, or pack around the stones, but, still governed by the\r\nattraction of the head, it falls to the rear and takes its place,\r\nlike the small men of a regiment, in the farther part of the tail.\r\n\r\nNow, all this agrees with what science tells us of the constitution\r\nof clay.\r\n\r\n{p. 73}\r\n\r\n\"It is a finely levigated silico-aluminous earth--formed by the\r\ndisintegration of feldspathic or granite rocks.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe particles ground out of feldspar are finer than those derived\r\nfrom mica and hornblende, and we can readily understand how the great\r\nforces of gravity, acting upon the dust of the comet's tail, might\r\nseparate one from the other; or how magnetic waves passing through\r\nthe comet might arrange all the particles containing iron by\r\nthemselves, and thus produce that marvelous separation of the\r\nconstituents of the granite which we have found to exist in the Drift\r\nclays. If the destroyed world possessed no sedimentary rocks, then\r\nthe entire material of the comet would consist of granitic stones and\r\ndust such as constitutes clays.\r\n\r\nThe stones are reduced to a small size by the constant attrition:\r\n\r\n\"The stones of the 'till' are not of the largest; indeed, bowlders\r\nabove four feet in diameter are comparatively seldom met with in the\r\ntill.\"[2]\r\n\r\nAnd this theory is corroborated by the fact that the eminent German\r\ngeologist, Dr. Hahn, has recently discovered an entire series of\r\norganic remains in meteoric stones, of the class called _chrondites_,\r\nand which he identifies as belonging to classes of sponges, corals,\r\nand crinoids. Dr. Weinland, another distinguished German,\r\ncorroborates these discoveries; and he has also found fragments in\r\nthese stones very much like the youngest marine chalk in the Gulf of\r\nMexico; and he thinks he sees, under the microscope, traces of\r\nvegetable growth. Francis Birgham says:\r\n\r\n[1. \"American Cyclopædia,\" article \"Clay.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 10.]\r\n\r\n{p. 74}\r\n\r\n\"This entire ex-terrestrial fauna hitherto discovered, which already\r\ncomprises about fifty different species, and which originates from\r\ndifferent meteoric falls, even from some during the last century,\r\nconveys the impression that it doubtlessly once formed part of _a\r\nsingle ex-terrestrial-celestial body_ with a unique creation, which\r\nin by-gone ages seems to have been overtaken by a grand catastrophe,\r\nduring which it was broken up into fragments.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that meteors are now generally believed to be the\r\ndroppings of comets, we come very near to proof of the supposition\r\nthat comets are the _débris_ of exploded planets; for only on planets\r\ncan we suppose that life existed, for there was required, for the\r\ngrowth of these sponges, corals, and crinoids, rocks, earth, water,\r\nseas or lakes, atmosphere, sunshine, and a range of temperature\r\nbetween the degree of cold where life is frozen up and the degree of\r\nheat in which it is burned up: hence, these meteors must be fragments\r\nof bodies possessing earth-like conditions.\r\n\r\nWe know that the heavenly bodies are formed of the same materials as\r\nour globe.\r\n\r\nDana says:\r\n\r\n\"Meteoric stones exemplify the same chemical and crystallographic\r\nlaws as the rocks of the earth, and have afforded no new element or\r\nprinciple of any kind.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed, therefore, that the granite crust of the exploded\r\nglobe from which some comet was created was the source of the finely\r\ntriturated material which we know as clay.\r\n\r\nBut the clays are of different colors--white, yellow, red, and blue.\r\n\r\n[1. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" November, 1881, p. 86.\r\n\r\n2. \"Manual of Geology,\" p. 3.]\r\n\r\n{p. 75}\r\n\r\n\"The aluminous minerals contained in granite rocks are feldspar,\r\nmica, and hornblende. . . . Mica and hornblende generally contain\r\nconsiderable oxide of iron, while feldspar usually yields only a\r\ntrace or none. Therefore clays which are derived from feldspar are\r\nlight-colored or white, while those partially made up of decomposed\r\nmica or hornblende are dark, either bluish or red.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe tail of the comet seems to be perpetually in motion. It is, says\r\none writer, \"continually _changing and fluctuating_ as vaporous\r\nmasses of cloud-like structure might be conceived to do, and in some\r\ninstances there has been a strong appearance even of an _undulating\r\nmovement_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe great comet of 1858, Donati's comet, which many now living will\r\nwell remember, and which was of such size that when its head was near\r\nour horizon the extremity of the tail reached nearly to the zenith,\r\nillustrated this continual movement of the material of the tail; that\r\nappendage shrank and enlarged millions of miles in length.\r\n\r\nMr. Lockyer believed that he saw in Coggia's comet the evidences of a\r\n_whirling_ motion--\r\n\r\n\"In which the regions of greatest brightness were caused by the\r\ndifferent coils _cutting_, or appearing to cut, each other, and so in\r\nthese parts leading to compression or condensation, and _frequent\r\ncollision of the luminous particles_.\"\r\n\r\nOlbers saw in a comet's tail--\r\n\r\n\"A sudden flash and pulsation of light which vibrated for several\r\nseconds through it, and the tail appeared during the continuance of\r\nthe pulsations of light to be lengthened by several degrees and then\r\nagain contracted.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1. \"American Cyclopædia,\" article \"Clay.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Edinburgh Review,\" October, 1874, p. 208,\r\n\r\n3, \"Cosmos,\" vol. i, p. 143.]\r\n\r\n{p. 76}\r\n\r\nNow, in this perpetual motion, this conflict, these great thrills of\r\nmovement, we are to find the source of the clays which cover a large\r\npart of our globe to a depth of hundreds of feet. Where are those\r\nexposures of granite on the face of the earth from which ice or water\r\ncould have ground them? Granite, I repeat, comes to the surface only\r\nin limited areas. And it must be remembered that clay is the product\r\nexclusively of granite ground to powder. The clays are composed\r\nexclusively of the products of disintegrated granite. They contain\r\nbut a trace of lime or magnesia or organic matters, and these can be\r\nsupposed to have been infiltrated into them after their arrival on\r\nthe face of the earth.[1] Other kinds of rock, ground up, form sand.\r\nMoreover, we have seen that neither glaciers nor ice-sheets now\r\nproduce such clays.\r\n\r\nWe shall see, as we proceed, that the legends of mankind, in\r\ndescribing the comet that struck the earth, represent it as\r\nparty-colored; it is \"speckled\" in one legend; spotted like a tiger\r\nin another; sometimes it is a _white_ boar in the heavens; sometimes\r\na _blue_ snake; sometimes it is _red_ with the blood of the millions\r\nthat are to perish. Doubtless these separate formations, ground out\r\nof the granite, from the mica, hornblende, or feldspar, respectively,\r\nmay, as I have said, under great laws, acted upon by magnetism or\r\nelectricity, have arranged themselves in separate lines or sheets, in\r\nthe tail of the comet, and hence we find that the clays of one region\r\nare of one color, while those of another are of a different hue.\r\nAgain, we shall see that the legends represent the monster as\r\n\"winding,\" undulating, writhing, twisting, fold over fold, precisely\r\nas the telescopes show us the comets do to-day.\r\n\r\n[1. \"American Cyclopædia,\" vol. iv, p. 650.]\r\n\r\n{p. 77}\r\n\r\nThe very fact that these waves of motion run through the tail of the\r\ncomet, and that it is capable of expanding and contracting on an\r\nimmense scale, is conclusive proof that it is composed of small,\r\nadjustable particles. The writer from whom I have already quoted,\r\nspeaking of the extraordinary comet of 1843, says:\r\n\r\n\"As the comet moves past the great luminary, it sweeps round its tail\r\nas a sword may be conceived to be held out at arm's-length, and then\r\nwaved round the head, from one side to the opposite. But a sword with\r\na blade one hundred and fifty millions of miles long must be a\r\nsomewhat awkward weapon to brandish round after this fashion. Its\r\npoint would have to sweep through a curve stretching out more than\r\nsix hundred millions of miles; and, even with an allowance of two\r\nhours for the accomplishment of the movement, the flash of the weapon\r\nwould be of such terrific velocity that it is not an easy task to\r\nconceive how any blade of _connected material substance_ could bear\r\nthe strain of the stroke. Even with a blade that possessed the\r\ncoherence and tenacity of iron or steel, the case would be one that\r\nit would be difficult for molecular cohesion to deal with. But that\r\ndifficulty is almost infinitely increased when it is a substance of\r\nmuch lower cohesive tenacity than either iron or steel that has to be\r\nsubjected to the strain.\r\n\r\n\"There would be, at least, some mitigation of this difficulty if it\r\nwere lawful to assume that the substance which is subjected to this\r\nstrain was not amenable to the laws of ponderable existence; if there\r\nwere room for the notion that comets and their tails, which have to\r\nbe brandished in such a stupendous fashion, were sky-spectres,\r\nimmaterial phantoms, unreal visions of that negative shadow-kind\r\nwhich has been alluded to. This, however, unfortunately, is not a\r\npermissible alternative in the circumstances of the case. The great\r\nunderlying and indispensable fact that the comet comes rushing up\r\ntoward the sun out of space, and then shoots round that great center\r\nof attraction by the force of its own acquired and ever-increasing\r\nimpetuosity; the fact that it is obedient\r\n\r\n{p. 78}\r\n\r\nthrough this course to the law of elliptical, or, to speak more\r\nexactly, of conic-section, movement, _permits of no doubt as to the\r\ncondition of materiality_. The comet is obviously drawn by the\r\ninfluence of the sun's mass, and is subservient to that all-pervading\r\nlaw of sympathetic gravitation that is the sustaining bond of the\r\nmaterial universe. _It is ponderable substance beyond all question_,\r\nand held by that chain of physical connection which it was the glory\r\nof Newton to discover. If the comet were not a material and\r\nponderable substance it would not gravitate round the sun, and it\r\nwould not move with increasing velocity as it neared the mighty mass\r\nuntil it had gathered the energy for its own escape in the enhanced\r\nand quickened momentum. In the first instance, the ready obedience to\r\nthe attraction, and then the overshooting of the spot from which it\r\nis exerted, combine to establish the comet's right to stand ranked at\r\nleast among the ponderable bodies of space.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAnd it is to the comet we must look for the source of a great part of\r\nthose vast deposits of gravel which go to constitute the Drift.\r\n\r\n\"They have been usually attributed to the action of waves; but the\r\nmechanical work of the ocean is mostly confined to its shores and\r\nsoundings, where alone material exists in quantity within reach of\r\nthe waves and currents.[2] . . . The eroding action is greatest for a\r\nshort distance above the height of half-tide, and, except in violent\r\nstorms, it is almost null below low-tide.\"[3]\r\n\r\nBut if any one will examine a sea-beach he will see, not a vast mass\r\nof pebbles perpetually rolling and grinding each other, but an\r\nexpanse of sand. And this is to be expected; for as soon as a part of\r\nthe pebbles is, by the attrition of the waves, reduced to sand, the\r\nsand packs around the stones and arrests their further waste. To form\r\nsuch a mass of gravel as is found in the Drift we\r\n\r\n[1. \"Edinburgh Review,\" October, 1874, p. 202.\r\n\r\n2. Dana's \"Text Book,\" p. 286.\r\n\r\n3. Ibid., p. 287.]\r\n\r\n{p. 79}\r\n\r\nmust conceive of some way whereby, as soon as the sand is formed, it\r\nis removed from the stones while the work of attrition goes on. This\r\nprocess we can conceive of in a comet, if the finer _detritus_ is\r\nconstantly carried back and arranged in the order of the size of its\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate my meaning: let one place any hard substance,\r\nconsisting of large fragments, in a mortar, and proceed to reduce it\r\nwith a pestle to a fine powder. The work proceeds rapidly at first,\r\nuntil a portion of the material is triturated; you then find that the\r\npulverized part has packed around and protected the larger fragments,\r\nand the work is brought to a stand-still. You have to remove the\r\nfiner material if you would crush the pieces that remain.\r\n\r\nThe sea does not separate the sand from the gravel; it places all\r\ntogether at elevations where the waves can not reach them:\r\n\r\n\"Waves or shallow soundings have some transporting power; and, as\r\nthey always move toward the land, their action is landward. They thus\r\nbeat back, little by little, any _detritus_ in the waters, preventing\r\nthat loss to continents or islands which would take place if it were\r\ncarried out to sea.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe pebbles and gravel are soon driven by the waves up the shore, and\r\nbeyond the reach of further wear;[2] and \"_the rivers carry only silt\r\nto the ocean_.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe brooks and rivers produce much more gravel than the sea-shore:\r\n\r\n\"The _detritus_ brought down by rivers is vastly greater in quantity\r\nthan the stones, sand, or clay produced by the wear of the coasts.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[1. Dana's \"Text Book,\" p. 288.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 291.\r\n\r\n3. Ibid., p. 302.\r\n\r\n4. Ibid., p. 290.]\r\n\r\n{p. 80}\r\n\r\nBut it would be absurd to suppose that the beds of rivers could have\r\nfurnished the immeasurable volumes of gravel found over a great part\r\nof the world in the drift-deposits.\r\n\r\nAnd the drift-gravel is different from the gravel of the sea or\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nGeikie says, speaking of the \"till\":\r\n\r\n\"There is something very peculiar about the shape of the stones. They\r\nare neither round and oval, like the pebbles in river-gravel, or the\r\nshingle of the sea-shore, nor are they sharply angular like\r\nnewly-fallen _débris_ at the base of a cliff, although they more\r\nclosely resemble the latter than the former. They are, indeed,\r\nangular in shape, but the sharp corners and edges have _invariably\r\nbeen smoothed away_. . . . Their shape, as will be seen, is by no\r\nmeans their most striking peculiarity. Each is smoothed, polished,\r\nand covered with striæ or scratches, some of which are delicate as\r\nthe lines traced by an etching-needle, others deep and harsh as the\r\nscores made by the plow upon a rock. And, what is worthy of note,\r\nmost of the scratches, coarse and fine together, seem to run parallel\r\nto the longer diameter of the stones, which, however, are scratched\r\nin many other directions as well.\"[1]\r\n\r\nLet me again summarize:\r\n\r\nI. Comets consist of a blazing nucleus and a mass of ponderable,\r\nseparated matter, such as stones, gravel, clay-dust, and gas.\r\n\r\nII. The nucleus gives out great heat and masses of burning gas.\r\n\r\nIII. Luminous gases surround the nucleus.\r\n\r\nIV. The drift-clays are the result of the grinding up of granitic\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nV. No such deposits, of anything like equal magnitude, could have\r\nbeen formed on the earth.\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 13.]\r\n\r\n{p. 81}\r\n\r\nVI. No such clays are now being formed under glaciers or Arctic\r\nice-sheets.\r\n\r\nVII. These clays were ground out of the substance of the comet by the\r\nendless changes of position of the material of which it is composed\r\nas it flew through space, during its incalculable journeys in the\r\nlong reaches of time.\r\n\r\nVIII. The earth-supplies of gravel are inadequate to account for the\r\ngravel of the drift-deposits.\r\n\r\nIX. Neither sea-beach nor rivers produce stones like those found in\r\nthe Drift.\r\n\r\nI pass now to the next question.\r\n\r\n{p. 82}\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                    COULD A COMET STRIKE THE EARTH?\r\n\r\nREADER, the evidence I am about to present will satisfy you, not only\r\nthat a comet might have struck the earth in the remote past, but,\r\nthat the marvel is that the earth escapes collision for a single\r\ncentury, I had almost said for a single year.\r\n\r\nHow many comets do you suppose there are within the limits of the\r\nsolar system (and remember that the solar system occupies but an\r\ninsignificant portion of universal space)?\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen-fifty-a hundred-you will answer.\r\n\r\nLet us put the astronomers on the witness-stand:\r\n\r\nKepler affirmed that \"COMETS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE HEAVENS WITH\r\nAS MUCH PROFUSION AS FISHES IN THE OCEAN.\"\r\n\r\nThink of that!\r\n\r\n\"Three or four telescopic comets are now entered upon astronomical\r\nrecords every year. Lalande had a list of seven hundred comets that\r\nhad been observed in his time.\"\r\n\r\nArago estimated that the comets belonging to the solar system, within\r\nthe orbit of Neptune, numbered _seventeen million five hundred\r\nthousand!_\r\n\r\nLambert regards _five hundred millions_ as a very moderate\r\nestimate![1]\r\n\r\n[1. Guillemin, \"The Heavens,\" p. 251.]\r\n\r\n{p. 83}\r\n\r\nAnd this does not include the monstrous fiery wanderers who may come\r\nto visit us, bringing their relations\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                    ORBITS OF THE PERIODIC COMETS.\r\n\r\nalong, from outside the solar system--a sort of celestial immigrants\r\nwhom no anti-Chinese legislation can keep away.\r\n\r\nSays Guillemin:\r\n\r\n\"Leaving mere re-appearances out of the question, _new comets are\r\nconstantly found to arrive from the depths of space_, describing\r\naround the sun orbits which testify to the attractive power of that\r\nradiant body; and, for the\r\n\r\n{p. 84}\r\n\r\nmost part, going away for centuries, to return again from afar after\r\ntheir immense revolutions.\"[1]\r\n\r\nBut do these comets come anywhere near the orbit of the earth?\r\n\r\nLook at the map on the preceding page, from Amédée Guillemin's great\r\nwork, \"The Heavens,\" page 244, and you can answer the question for\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nHere you see the orbit of the earth overwhelmed in a complication of\r\ncomet-orbits. The earth, here, is like a lost child in the midst of a\r\nforest full of wild beasts.\r\n\r\nAnd this diagram represents the orbits of only six comets out of\r\nthose seventeen millions or five hundred millions!\r\n\r\nIt is a celestial game of ten-pins, with the solar system for a\r\nbowling-alley, and the earth waiting for a ten-strike.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 the earth and Biela's comet, as I will show more particularly\r\nhereafter, were both making for the same spot, moving with celestial\r\nrapidity, but the comet reached the point of junction one month\r\nbefore the earth did; and, as the comet was not polite enough to wait\r\nfor us to come up, this generation missed a revelation.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1779 Lexell's comet approached so near to the earth that\r\nit would have increased the length of the sidereal year by three\r\nhours if its mass had been equal to the earth's.\"[2]\r\n\r\nAnd this same comet did strike our fellow-planet, Jupiter.\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Heavens,\" p. 251.\r\n\r\n2. \"Edinburgh Review,\" October, 1874, p. 205.]\r\n\r\n{p. 85}\r\n\r\nIn the years 1767 and 1779 Lexell's comet passed though the midst of\r\nJupiter's satellites, and became entangled temporarily among them.\r\nBut not one of the satellites altered its movements to the extent of\r\na hair's breadth, or of a tenth of an instant.\"[1]\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered that we had no glasses then, and have none\r\nnow, that could tell us what were the effects of this visitation upon\r\nthe surface of Jupiter or its moons. The comet might have covered\r\nJupiter one hundred feet--yes, one hundred miles--thick with gravel\r\nand clay, and formed clouds of its seas five miles in thickness,\r\nwithout our knowing anything about it. Even our best telescopes can\r\nonly perceive on the moon's surface--which is, comparatively\r\nspeaking, but a few miles distant from us--objects of very great\r\nsize, while Jupiter is sixteen hundred times farther away from us\r\nthan the moon.\r\n\r\nBut it is known that Lexell's comet was very much demoralized by\r\nJupiter. It first came within the influence of that planet in 1767;\r\nit lost its original orbit, and went bobbing around Jupiter until\r\n1779, when it became entangled with Jupiter's moons, and then it lost\r\nits orbit again, and was whisked off into infinite space, never more,\r\nperhaps, to be seen by human eyes. Is it not reasonable to suppose\r\nthat an event which thus demoralized the comet may have caused it to\r\ncast down a considerable part of its material on the face of Jupiter?\r\n\r\nEncke's comet revolves around the sun in the short period of twelve\r\nhundred and five days, and, strange to say--\r\n\r\n\"The period of its revolution is _constantly diminishing_; so that,\r\nif this progressive diminution always follows the same rate, _the\r\ntime when the comet_, continually\r\n\r\n[1. \"Edinburgh Review,\" October, 1874, p. 205.]\r\n\r\n{p. 86}\r\n\r\ndescribing a spiral, _will be plunged into the incandescent mass of\r\nthe sun can be calculated_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1874, first seen by Coggia, at Marseilles, and called by\r\nhis name, came between the earth and the sun, and _approached within\r\nsixty thousand miles of the flaming surface of the sun_. It traveled\r\nthrough this fierce blaze at the rate of _three hundred and sixty-six\r\nmiles per second!_ Three hundred and sixty-six miles _per second!_\r\nWhen a railroad-train moves at the rate of a mile per minute, we\r\nregard it as extraordinary speed; but three hundred and sixty-six\r\nmiles _per second!_ The mind fails to grasp it.\r\n\r\nWhen this comet was seen by Sir John Herschel, after it had made its\r\ngrand sweep around the sun, it was not more than _six times the\r\nbreadth of the sun's face away from the sun_. And it had come\r\ncareering through infinite space with awful velocity to this close\r\napproximation to our great luminary.\r\n\r\nAnd remember that these comets are no animalculæ. They are monsters\r\nthat would reach from the sun to the earth. And when we say that they\r\ncome so close to the sun as in the above instances, it means peril to\r\nthe earth by direct contact; to say nothing of the results to our\r\nplanet by the increased combustion of the run, and the increased heat\r\non earth should one of them fall upon the sun. We have seen, in the\r\nlast chapter, that the great comet of 1843 possessed a tail one\r\nhundred and fifty million miles long; that is, it would reach from\r\nthe sun to the earth, and have over fifty million miles of tail to\r\nspare; and it swept this gigantic appendage around in two hours,\r\ndescribing the are of a circle _six hundred million miles long!_\r\n\r\n[1. Guillemin, \"The Heavens,\" p. 247.]\r\n\r\n{p. 87}\r\n\r\nThe mind fails to grasp these figures. Solar space is hardly large\r\nenough for such gyrations.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be remembered that this enormous creature actually\r\n_grazed the surface of the sun_.\r\n\r\nAnd it is supposed that this monster of 1843, which was first seen in\r\n1668, returned, and was seen in the southern hemisphere in 1880--that\r\nis to say, it came back in thirty-seven years instead of one hundred\r\nand seventy-five years. Whereupon Mr. Proctor remarked:\r\n\r\n\"If already the comet experiences such resistance in passing through\r\nthe corona when at its nearest to the sun that its period undergoes a\r\nmarked diminution, the effect must of necessity be increased at each\r\nreturn, and after only a few, possibly one or two, circuits, the\r\ncomet will be absorbed by the sun.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 10, 1880, Lewis Swift, of Rochester, New York, discovered\r\na comet which has proved to be of peculiar interest. From its first\r\ndiscovery it has presented no brilliancy of appearance, for, during\r\nits period of visibility, a telescope of considerable power was\r\nnecessary to observe it. Since this comet, when in close proximity to\r\nthe earth, was very faint indeed, its dimensions must be quite\r\nmoderate.\r\n\r\nThe illustration on page 88 gives the orbit of the earth and the\r\norbit of this comet, and shows how closely they approached each\r\nother; when at its nearest, the comet was only distant from the earth\r\n0.13 of the distance of the earth from the sun.\r\n\r\nIt comes back in eleven years, or in 1891.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of June, 1881, a comet of great brilliancy flashed\r\nsuddenly into view. It was unexpected, and advanced with tremendous\r\nrapidity. The illustration on page 89 will show how its flight\r\nintersected the orbit of the earth. At its nearest point, June 19th,\r\nit was distant\r\n\r\n{p. 88}\r\n\r\nfrom the earth only 0.28 of the distance of the sun from the earth.\r\n\r\nNow, it is to be remembered that great attention has been paid during\r\nthe past few years to searching for comets, and some of the results\r\nare here given. As many as five were discovered during the year 1881.\r\nBut not\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                       ORBIT OF EARTH AND COMET\r\n\r\na few of the greatest of these strange orbs require thousands of\r\nyears to complete their orbits. The period of the comet of July,\r\n1844, has been estimated at not less than one hundred thousand years!\r\n\r\nSome of those that have flashed into sight recently have been\r\ncomparatively small, and their contact with\r\n\r\n{p. 89}\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                          THE EARTH'S ORBIT\r\n\r\nthe earth might produce but trifling results. Others, again, are\r\nconstructed on an extraordinary scale; but even the largest of these\r\nmay be but children compared with the monsters that wander through\r\nspace on orbits\r\n\r\n{p. 90}\r\n\r\nthat penetrate the remotest regions of the solar system, and even\r\nbeyond it.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the millions of comets around us, and when we\r\nremember how near some of these have come to us during the last few\r\nyears, who will undertake to say that during the last thirty\r\nthousand, fifty thousand, or one hundred thousand years, one of these\r\nerratic luminaries, with blazing front and train of _débris_, may not\r\nhave come in collision with the earth?\r\n\r\n{p. 91}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                    THE CONSEQUENCES TO THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nIN this chapter I shall try to show what effect the contact of a\r\ncomet must have had upon the earth and its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI shall ask the reader to follow the argument closely first, that he\r\nmay see whether any part of the theory is inconsistent with the\r\nwell-established principles of natural philosophy; and, secondly,\r\nthat he may bear the several steps in his memory, as he will find, as\r\nwe proceed, that _every detail of the mighty catastrophe has been\r\npreserved in the legends of mankind_, and precisely in the order in\r\nwhich reason tells us they must have occurred.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is, of course, impossible at this time to say\r\nprecisely how the contact took place; whether the head of the comet\r\nfell into or approached close to the sun, like the comet of 1843, and\r\nthen swung its mighty tail, hundreds of millions of miles in length,\r\nmoving at a rate almost equal to the velocity of light, around\r\nthrough a great are, and swept past the earth;--the earth, as it\r\nwere, going through the midst of the tail, which would extend for a\r\nvast distance beyond and around it. In this movement, the side of the\r\nearth, facing the advance of the tail, would receive and intercept\r\nthe mass of material--stones, gravel, and the finely-ground-up-dust\r\nwhich, compacted by water, is now clay--which came in contact with\r\nit, while the comet would sail off into space,\r\n\r\n{p. 92}\r\n\r\ndemoralized, perhaps, in its orbit, like Lexell's comet when it\r\nbecame entangled with Jupiter's moons, but shorn of a comparatively\r\nsmall portion of its substance.\r\n\r\nThe following engraving will illustrate my meaning. I can not give,\r\neven approximately, the proportions of the\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                  THE COMET SWEEPING PAST THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nobjects represented, and thus show the immensity of the sun as\r\ncompared with our insignificant little orb. In a picture showing the\r\ntrue proportions of the sun and earth, the sun would have to be so\r\nlarge that it would take up the entire page, while the earth would be\r\nbut as a\r\n\r\n{p. 93}\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n           THE SIDE OF THE EARTH STRUCK BY THE COMET {left}\r\n\r\n               THE SIDE NOT STRUCK BY THE COMET {right}\r\n\r\n{p. 94}\r\n\r\npin-head. And I have not drawn the comet on a scale large enough as\r\ncompared with the earth.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will examine the map on page 93, he will see that the\r\ndistribution of the Drift accords with this theory. If we suppose the\r\nside of the earth shown in the left-hand figure was presented to the\r\ncomet, we will see why the Drift is supposed to be confined to\r\nEurope, Africa, and parts of America; while the right-hand figure\r\nwill show the half of the world that escaped.\r\n\r\n\"The breadth of the tail of the great comet of 1811, at its widest\r\npart, was nearly fourteen million miles, the length one hundred and\r\nsixteen million miles, and that of the second comet of the same year,\r\none hundred and forty million miles.\"[1]\r\n\r\nOn page 95 is a representation of this monster.\r\n\r\nImagine such a creature as that, with a head _fifty times as large as\r\nthe moon_, and a tail one hundred and sixteen million miles long,\r\nrushing past this poor little earth of ours, with its diameter of\r\nonly seven thousand nine hundred and twenty-five miles! The earth,\r\nseven thousand nine hundred and twenty-five miles wide, would simply\r\nmake a bullet-hole through that tail, fourteen million miles broad,\r\nwhere it passed through it!--a mere eyelet-hole--a pin-hole--closed\r\nup at once by the constant movements which take place in the tail of\r\nthe comet. And yet in that moment of contact the side of the earth\r\nfacing the comet might be covered with hundreds of feet of _débris_.\r\n\r\nOr, on the other hand, the comet may, as described in some of the\r\nlegends, have struck the earth, head on, amid-ships, and the shock\r\nmay have changed the angle of inclination of the earth's axis, and\r\nthus have modified\r\n\r\n[1. Schellen, \"Spectrum Analysis,\" p. 392.]\r\n\r\n{p. 95}\r\n\r\npermanently the climate of our globe; and to this cause we might look\r\nalso for the great cracks and breaks in the earth's surface, which\r\nconstitute the fiords of the sea-coast and the trap-extrusions of the\r\ncontinents; and here, too,\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                       THE GREAT COMET OF 1811.\r\n\r\nmight be the cause of those mighty excavations, hundreds of feet\r\ndeep, in which are now the Great Lakes of America, and from which, as\r\nwe have seen, great cracks radiate out in all directions, like the\r\nfractures in a pane of glass where a stone has struck it.\r\n\r\nThe cavities in which rest the Great Lakes have been attributed to\r\nthe ice-sheet, but it is difficult to comprehend how an ice-sheet\r\ncould dig out and root out a hole, as in the case of Lake Superior,\r\n_nine hundred feet deep!_\r\n\r\n{p. 96}\r\n\r\nAnd, if it did this, why were not similar holes excavated wherever\r\nthere were ice-sheets--to wit, all over the northern and southern\r\nportions of the globe? Why should a general cause produce only local\r\nresults?\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell shows[1] that glaciers do not cut out holes like\r\nthe depressions in which the Great Lakes lie; he also shows that\r\nthese lakes are not due to a sinking down of the crust of the earth,\r\nbecause the strata are continuous and unbroken beneath them. He also\r\ncalls attention to the fact that there is a continuous belt of such\r\nlakes, reaching from the northwestern part of the United States,\r\nthrough the Hudson Bay Territory, Canada, and Maine, to Finland, and\r\nthat this belt does not reach below 50° north latitude in Europe and\r\n40° in America. Do these lie in the track of the great collision? The\r\ncomet, as the striæ indicate, came from the north.\r\n\r\nThe mass of Donati's comet was estimated by MM. Faye and Roche at\r\nabout the seven-hundredth part of the bulk of the earth. M. Faye says:\r\n\r\n\"That is the weight of a sea of forty thousand square miles one\r\nhundred and nine yards deep; and it must be owned that a like mass,\r\nanimated with considerable velocity, might well produce, by its shock\r\nwith the earth, very perceptible results.\"[2]\r\n\r\nWe have but to suppose, (a not unreasonable supposition,) that the\r\ncomet which struck the earth was much larger than Donati's comet, and\r\nwe have the means of accounting for results as prodigious as those\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that it is difficult to suppose that ice produced the\r\ndrift-deposits, because they are not found where ice certainly was,\r\nand they are found where ice certainly was not. But, if the reader\r\nwill turn to the\r\n\r\n[1. \"Elements of Geology,\" pp. 168,171, _et seq_.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Heavens,\" p. 260.]\r\n\r\n{p. 97}\r\n\r\nillustration which constitutes the frontispiece of this volume, and\r\nthe foregoing engraving on page 93, he will see that the Drift is\r\ndeposited on the earth, as it might have been if it had suddenly\r\nfallen from the heavens; that is, it is on one side of the globe--to\r\nwit, the side that faced the comet as it came on. I think this map is\r\nsubstantially accurate. There is, however, an absence of authorities\r\nas to the details of the drift-distribution. But, if my theory is\r\ncorrect, the Drift probably fell at once. If it had been twenty-four\r\nhours in falling, the diurnal revolution would, in turn, have\r\npresented all sides of the earth to it, and the Drift would be found\r\neverywhere. And this is in accordance with what we know of the rapid\r\nmovements of comets. They travel, as I have shown, at the rate of\r\nthree hundred and sixty-six miles per second; this is equal to\r\ntwenty-one thousand six hundred miles per minute, and one million two\r\nhundred and ninety-six thousand miles per hour!\r\n\r\nAnd this accords with what we know of the deposition of the Drift. It\r\ncame with terrific force. It smashed the rocks; it tore them up; it\r\nrolled them over on one another; it drove its material _into_ the\r\nunderlying rocks; \"it _indented it_ into them,\" says one authority,\r\nalready quoted.\r\n\r\nIt was accompanied by inconceivable winds--the hurricanes and\r\ncyclones spoken of in many of the legends. Hence we find the loose\r\nmaterial of the original surface gathered up and carried into the\r\ndrift-material proper; hence the Drift is whirled about in the\r\nwildest confusion. Hence it fell on the earth like a great snow-storm\r\ndriven by the wind. It drifted into all hollows; it was not so thick\r\non, or it was entirely absent from, the tops of hills; it formed\r\ntails, precisely as snow does, on the leeward side of all\r\nobstructions. Glacier-ice is slow and plastic,\r\n\r\n{p. 98}\r\n\r\nand folds around such impediments, and wears them away; the wind does\r\nnot. Compare the following representation of a well-known feature of\r\nthe Drift, called\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                CRAG AND TAIL.--_c_, crag; _t_, till.\r\n\r\n\"crag and tail,\" taken from Geikie's work,[1] with the drifts formed\r\nby snow on the leeward side of fences or houses.\r\n\r\nThe material runs in streaks, just as if blown by violent winds:\r\n\r\n\"When cut through by rivers, or denuded by the action of the sea,\r\n_ridges_ of bowlders are often seen to be inclosed within it.\r\nAlthough destitute of stratification, horizontal lines are found,\r\nindicating differences in texture and color.\"[2]\r\n\r\nGeikie, describing the bowlder-clay, says:\r\n\r\n\"It seems to have come from regions whence it is bard to see how they\r\ncould have been borne by glaciers. As a rule it is quite\r\nunstratified, but traces of bedding are not uncommon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes it contains worn fossils, and fragments of shells, broken,\r\ncrushed, and striated; sometimes it contains bands of stones arranged\r\nin lines.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, it appears as if it were gusts and great whirls of the same\r\nmaterial as the \"till,\" lifted up by the cyclones and mingled with\r\nblocks, rocks, bones, sands, fossils, earth, peat, and other matters,\r\npicked up with terrible\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 18.\r\n\r\n2. \"American Cyclopædia,\" vol. vi, p. 112.]\r\n\r\n{p. 99}\r\n\r\nforce from the face of the earth and poured down pell-mell on top of\r\nthe first deposit of true \"till.\"\r\n\r\nIn England ninety-four per cent of these stones found in this\r\nbowlder-clay are \"stranger\" stones; that is to say, they do not\r\nbelong to the drainage area in which they are found, but must have\r\nbeen carried there from great distances.\r\n\r\nBut how about the markings, the _striæ_, on the face of the\r\nsurface-rocks below the Drift? The answer is plain. _Débris_, moving\r\nat the rate of a million miles an hour, would produce just such\r\nmarkings.\r\n\r\nDana says:\r\n\r\n\"The sands carried by the winds when passing over rocks sometimes\r\n_wear them smooth_, or cover them with _scratches and furrows_, as\r\nobserved by W. P. Blake on granite rocks at the Pass of San\r\nBernardino, in California. Even quartz was polished and garnets were\r\nleft projecting upon pedicels of feldspar. Limestone was so much worn\r\nas to look as if the surface had been removed by solution. Similar\r\neffects have been observed by Winchell in the Grand Traverse region,\r\nMichigan. Glass in the windows of houses on Cape Cod sometimes has\r\nholes worn through it by the same means. The hint from nature has led\r\nto the use of sand, driven by a blast, with or without steam, for\r\ncutting and engraving glass, and even for cutting and carving granite\r\nand other hard rocks.\"[1]\r\n\r\nGratacap describes the rock underneath the \"till\" as polished and\r\noftentimes lustrous.\"[2]\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, if it be true that _débris_, driven by a\r\nterrible force, could have scratched and dented the rocks, could it\r\nhave made long, continuous lines and grooves upon them? But the fact\r\nis, the _striæ_ on the face of the rocks covered by the Drift are\r\n_not_ continuous;\r\n\r\n[1. Dana's \"Text-Book,\" p. 275.\r\n\r\n2. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" January, 1878, p. 320.]\r\n\r\n{p. 100}\r\n\r\nthey do not indicate a steady and constant pressure, such as would\r\nresult where a mountainous mass of ice had caught a rock and held it,\r\nas it were, in its mighty hand, and, thus holding it steadily, had\r\nscored the rocks with it as it moved forward.\r\n\r\n\"The groove is of irregular depth, its floor rising and falling, as\r\nthough hitches had occurred when it was first planed, the great\r\nchisel meeting resistance, or being thrown up at points along its\r\npath.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWhat other results would follow at once from contact with the comet?\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, to produce the phenomena of the Glacial age, it\r\nwas absolutely necessary that it must have been preceded by a period\r\nof heat, great enough to vaporize all the streams and lakes and a\r\nlarge part of the ocean. And we have seen that no mere ice-hypothesis\r\ngives us any clew to the cause of this.\r\n\r\nWould the comet furnish us with such heat? Let me call another\r\nwitness to the stand:\r\n\r\nIn the great work of Amédée Guillemin, already cited, we read:\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, it seems proved that the light of the comets is,\r\nin part, at least, borrowed from the sun. But may they not also\r\npossess a light of their own? And, on this last hypothesis, is this\r\nbrightness owing to a kind of phosphorescence, or to the state of\r\nincandescence of the nucleus? Truly, if the nuclei of comets be\r\nincandescent, the smallness of their mass would eliminate from the\r\ndanger of their contact with the earth only one element of\r\ndestruction: _the temperature of the terrestrial atmosphere would be\r\nraised to an elevation inimical to the existence of organized\r\nbeings_; and we should only escape the danger of a mechanical shock,\r\nto run into a not less frightful\r\n\r\n[1. Gratacap, \"The Ice Age,\" in \"Popular Science Monthly,\" January,\r\n1818, p. 321.]\r\n\r\n{p. 101}\r\n\r\none of being _calcined in a many days passage through an immense\r\nfurnace_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere we have a good deal more heat than is necessary to account for\r\nthat vaporization of the seas of the globe which seems to have taken\r\nplace during the Drift Age.\r\n\r\nBut similar effects might be produced, in another way, even though\r\nthe heat of the comet itself was inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nSuppose the comet, or a large part of it, to have fallen into the\r\nsun. The arrested motion would be converted into heat. The material\r\nwould feed the combustion of the sun. Some have theorized that the\r\nsun is maintained by the fall of cometic matter into it. What would\r\nbe the result?\r\n\r\nMr. Proctor notes that in 1866 a star, in the constellation Northern\r\nCross, suddenly shone with _eight hundred times its former luster_,\r\nafterward rapidly diminishing in luster. In 1876 a new star in the\r\nconstellation Cygnus became visible, subsequently fading again so as\r\nto be only perceptible by means of a telescope; the luster of this\r\nstar must have increased from five hundred to _many_ thousand times.\r\n\r\nMr. Proctor claims that should our sun similarly increase in luster\r\neven one hundred-fold, the glowing heat would destroy all vegetable\r\nand animal life on earth.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in seeing our way to heat enough, if we\r\nconcede that a comet really struck the earth or fell into the sun.\r\nThe trouble is in the other direction--we would have too much heat.\r\n\r\nWe shall see, hereafter, that there is evidence in our rocks that in\r\ntwo different ages of the world, millions of years before the Drift\r\nperiod, the whole surface of the\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Heavens,\" p. 260.]\r\n\r\n{p. 102}\r\n\r\nearth was actually fused and melted, probably by cometic contact.\r\n\r\nThis earth of ours is really a great powder-magazine there is enough\r\ninflammable and explosive material about it to blow it into shreds at\r\nany moment.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell quotes, approvingly, the thought of Pliny: \"It is\r\nan amazement that our world, so full of combustible elements, stands\r\na moment unexploded.\"\r\n\r\nIt needs but an infinitesimal increase in the quantity of oxygen in\r\nthe air to produce a combustion which would melt all things. In pure\r\noxygen, steel burns like a candle-wick. Nay, it is not necessary to\r\nincrease the amount of oxygen in the air to produce terrible results.\r\nIt has been shown[1] that, of our forty-five miles of atmosphere, one\r\nfifth, or a stratum of nine miles in thickness, is oxygen. A shock,\r\nor an electrical or other convulsion, which would even partially\r\ndisarrange or decompose this combination, and send an increased\r\nquantity of oxygen, the heavier gas, to the earth, would wrap\r\neverything in flames. Or the same effects might follow from any great\r\nchange in the constitution of the water of the world. Water is\r\ncomposed of eight parts of oxygen and one part of hydrogen. \"The\r\nintensest heat by far ever yet produced by the blow-pipe is by the\r\ncombustion of these two gases.\" And Dr. Robert Hare, of Philadelphia,\r\nfound that the combination which produced the intensest heat was that\r\nin which the two gases were in the _precise proportions found in\r\nwater_.[2]\r\n\r\nWe may suppose that this vast heat, whether it came from the comet,\r\nor the increased action of the sun, preceded the fall of the _débris_\r\nof the comet by a few minutes or a few hours. We have seen the\r\nsurface-rocks\r\n\r\n[1. \"Science and Genesis,\" p. 125.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 127.]\r\n\r\n{p. 103}\r\n\r\ndescribed as lustrous. The heat may not have been great enough to\r\nmelt them--it may merely have softened them; but when the mixture of\r\nclay, gravel, striated rocks, and earth-sweepings fell and rested on\r\nthem, they were at once hardened and almost baked; and thus we can\r\naccount for the fact that the \"till,\" which lies next to the rocks,\r\nis so hard and tough, compared with the rest of the Drift, that it is\r\nimpossible to blast it, and exceedingly difficult even to pick it to\r\npieces; it is more feared by workmen and contractors than any of the\r\ntrue rocks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hartt shows that there is evidence that some cause, prior\r\nto but closely connected with the Drift, did decompose the\r\nsurface-rocks underneath the Drift to great depths, changing their\r\nchemical composition and appearance. Professor Hartt says:\r\n\r\n\"In Brazil, and in the United States in the vicinity of New York\r\ncity, the surface-rocks, under the Drift, are decomposed from a depth\r\nof a few inches to that of a hundred feet. The feldspar has _been\r\nconverted into slate_, and the mica _has parted with its iron_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nProfessor Hartt tries to account for this metamorphosis by supposing\r\nit to have been produced by warm rains! But why should there be warm\r\nrains at this particular period? And why, if warm rains occurred in\r\nall ages, were not all the earlier rocks similarly changed while they\r\nwere at the surface?\r\n\r\nHeusser and Clarez suppose this decomposition of the rocks to be due\r\nto nitric acid. But where did the nitric acid come from?\r\n\r\nIn short, here is the proof of the presence on the earth, just before\r\nthe Drift struck it, of that conflagration which we shall find\r\ndescribed in so many legends.\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Geology of Brazil,\" p. 25.]\r\n\r\n{p. 104}\r\n\r\nAnd certainly the presence of ice could not decompose rocks a hundred\r\nfeet deep, and change their chemical constitution. Nothing but heat\r\ncould do it.\r\n\r\nBut we have seen that the comet is self-luminous--that is, it is in\r\nprocess of combustion; it emits great gushes and spouts of luminous\r\ngases; its nucleus is enveloped in a cloak of gases. What effect\r\nwould these gases have upon our atmosphere?\r\n\r\nFirst, they would be destructive to animal life. But it does not\r\nfollow that they would cover the whole earth. If they did, all life\r\nmust have ceased. They may have fallen in places here and there, in\r\ngreat sheets or patches, and have caused, until they burned\r\nthemselves out, the conflagrations which the traditions tell us\r\naccompanied the great disaster.\r\n\r\nSecondly, by adding increased proportions to some of the elements of\r\nour atmosphere they may have helped to produce the marked difference\r\nbetween the pre-glacial and our present climate.\r\n\r\nWhat did these gases consist of?\r\n\r\nHere that great discovery, the spectroscope, comes to our aid. By it\r\nwe are able to tell the elements that are being consumed in remote\r\nstars; by it we have learned that comets are in part self-luminous,\r\nand in part shine by the reflected light of the sun; by it we are\r\neven able to identify the very gases that are in a state of\r\ncombustion in comets.\r\n\r\nIn Schellen's great work[1] I find a cut (see next page) comparing\r\nthe spectra of carbon with the light emitted by two comets observed\r\nin 1868--Winnecke's comet and Brorsen's comet.\r\n\r\nHere we see that the self-luminous parts of these comets\r\n\r\n[1. \"Spectrum Analysis,\" p. 396.]\r\n\r\n{p. 105}\r\n\r\nburned with substantially the same spectrum as that emitted by\r\nburning carbon. The inference is irresistible that these comets were\r\nwrapped in great masses of carbon in a state of combustion. This is\r\nthe conclusion reached by Dr. Schellen.\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                            SOLAR SPECTRUM\r\n\r\nPadre Secchi, the great Roman astronomer, examined Dr. Winnecke's\r\ncomet on the 21st of June, 1868, and concluded that the light from\r\nthe self-luminous part was produced by carbureted hydrogen.\r\n\r\nWe shall see that the legends of the different races speak of the\r\npoison that accompanied the comet, and by which great multitudes were\r\nslain; the very waters that\r\n\r\n{p. 106}\r\n\r\nfirst flowed through the Drift, we are told, were poisonous. We have\r\nbut to remember that carbureted hydrogen is the deadly fire-damp of\r\nthe miners to realize what effect great gusts of it must have had on\r\nanimal life.\r\n\r\nWe are told[1] that it burns with a _yellow_ flame when subjected to\r\ngreat heat, and some of the legends, we will see hereafter, speak of\r\nthe \"yellow hair\" of the comet that struck the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd we are further told that, \"when it, carbureted hydrogen, is mixed\r\nin due proportion with oxygen or atmospheric air, a compound is\r\nproduced which explodes with the electric spark or the approach of\r\nflame.\" Another form of carbureted hydrogen, olefiant gas, is deadly\r\nto life, burns with a white light, and when mixed with three or four\r\nvolumes of oxygen, or ten or twelve of air, it explodes with terrific\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nWe shall see, hereafter, that many of the legends tell us that, as\r\nthe comet approached the earth, that is, as it entered our atmosphere\r\nand combined with it, it gave forth world-appalling noises, thunders\r\nbeyond all earthly thunders, roarings, howlings, and hissings, that\r\nshook the globe. If a comet did come, surrounded by volumes of\r\ncarbureted hydrogen, or carbon combined with hydrogen, the moment it\r\nreached far enough into our atmosphere to supply it with the\r\nrequisite amount of oxygen or atmospheric air, precisely such\r\ndreadful explosions would occur, accompanied by noises similar to\r\nthose described in the legends.\r\n\r\nLet us go a step further:\r\n\r\nLet us try to conceive the effects of the fall of the material of the\r\ncomet upon the earth.\r\n\r\nWe have seen terrible rain-storms, hail-storms, snow-storms;\r\n\r\n[1. \"American Cyclopædia,\" vol. iii, p. 776.]\r\n\r\n{p. 107}\r\n\r\nbut fancy a storm of stones and gravel and clay-dust!--not a mere\r\nshower either, but falling in black masses, darkening the heavens,\r\nvast enough to cover the world in many places hundreds of feet in\r\nthickness; leveling valleys, tearing away and grinding down hills,\r\nchanging the whole aspect of the habitable globe. Without and above\r\nit roars the earthquaking voice of the terrible explosions; through\r\nthe drifts of _débris_ glimpses are caught of the glaring and burning\r\nmonster; while through all and over all is an unearthly heat, under\r\nwhich rivers, ponds, lakes, springs, disappear as if by magic.\r\n\r\nNow, reader, try to grasp the meaning of all this description. Do not\r\nmerely read the words. To read aright, upon any subject, you must\r\nread below the words, above the words, and take in all the relations\r\nthat surround the words. So read this record.\r\n\r\nLook out at the scene around you. Here are trees fifty feet high.\r\nImagine an instantaneous descent of granite-sand and gravel\r\nsufficient to smash and crush these trees to the ground, to bury\r\ntheir trunks, and to cover the earth one hundred to five hundred feet\r\nhigher than the elevation to which their tops now reach! And this not\r\nalone here in your garden, or over your farm, or over your township,\r\nor over your county, or over your State; but over the whole continent\r\nin which you dwell--in short, over the greater part of the habitable\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nAre there any words that can draw, even faintly, such a picture--its\r\nterror, its immensity, its horrors, its destructiveness, its\r\nsurpassal of all earthly experience and imagination? And this human\r\nant-hill, the world, how insignificant would it be in the grasp of\r\nsuch a catastrophe! Its laws, its temples, its libraries, its\r\nreligions, its armies, its mighty nations, would be but as the veriest\r\n\r\n{p. 108}\r\n\r\nstubble--dried grass, leaves, rubbish-crushed, smashed, buried, under\r\nthis heaven-rain of horrors.\r\n\r\nBut, lo! through the darkness, the wretches not beaten down and\r\nwhelmed in the _débris_, but scurrying to mountain-caves for refuge,\r\nhave a new terror: the cry passes from lip to lip, \"The world is on\r\nfire!\"\r\n\r\nThe head of the comet sheds down fire. Its gases have fallen in great\r\nvolumes on the earth; they ignite; amid the whirling and rushing of\r\nthe _débris_, caught in cyclones, rises the glare of a Titanic\r\nconflagration. The winds beat the rocks against the rocks; they pick\r\nup sand-heaps, peat-beds, and bowlders, and whirl them madly in the\r\nair. The heat increases. The rivers, the lakes, the ocean itself,\r\nevaporate.\r\n\r\nAnd poor humanity! Burned, bruised, wild, crazed, stumbling, blown\r\nabout like feathers in the hurricanes, smitten by mighty rocks, they\r\nperish by the million; a few only reach the shelter of the caverns;\r\nand thence, glaring backward, look out over the ruins of a destroyed\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAnd not humanity alone has fled to these hiding-places: the terrified\r\ndenizens of the forest, the domestic animals of the fields, with the\r\ninstinct which in great tempests has driven them into the houses of\r\nmen, follow the refugees into the caverns. We shall see all this\r\ndepicted in the legends.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of the great heat is the vaporization of the waters\r\nof the earth; but this is arrested long before it has completed its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nStill the heat is intense--how long it lasts, who shall tell? An\r\nArabian legend indicates years.\r\n\r\nThe stones having ceased to fall, the few who have escaped--and they\r\nare few indeed, for many are shut up for ever by the clay-dust and\r\ngravel in their hiding-places,\r\n\r\n{p. 109}\r\n\r\nand on many others the convulsions of the earth have shaken down the\r\nrocky roofs of the caves--the few survivors come out, or dig their\r\nway out, to look upon a changed and blasted world. No cloud is in the\r\nsky, no rivers or lakes are on the earth; only the deep springs of\r\nthe caverns are left; the sun, a ball of fire, glares in the bronze\r\nheavens. It is to this period that the Norse legend of Mimer's well,\r\nwhere Odin gave an eye for a drink of water, refers.\r\n\r\nBut gradually the heat begins to dissipate. This is a signal for\r\ntremendous electrical action. Condensation commences. Never has the\r\nair held such incalculable masses of moisture; never has heaven's\r\nartillery so rattled and roared since earth began! Condensation means\r\nclouds. We will find hereafter a whole body of legends about \"the\r\nstealing of the clouds\" and their restoration. The veil thickens. The\r\nsun's rays are shut out. It grows colder; more condensation follows.\r\nThe heavens darken. Louder and louder bellows the thunder. We shall\r\nsee the lightnings represented, in myth after myth, as the arrows of\r\nthe rescuing demi-god who saves the world. The heat has carried up\r\nperhaps one fourth of all the water of the world into the air. Now it\r\nis condensed into cloud. We know how an ordinary storm darkens the\r\nheavens. In this case it is black night. A pall of dense cloud, many\r\nmiles in thickness, enfolds the earth. No sun, no moon, no stars, can\r\nbe seen. \"Darkness is on the face of the deep.\" Day has ceased to be.\r\nMen stumble against each other. All this we shall find depicted in\r\nthe legends. The overloaded atmosphere begins to discharge itself.\r\nThe great work of restoring the waters of the ocean to the ocean\r\nbegins. It grows colder--colder--colder. The pouring rain turns into\r\nsnow, and settles on all the uplands and north countries; snow falls\r\non\r\n\r\n{p. 110}\r\n\r\nsnow; gigantic snow-beds are formed, which gradually solidify into\r\nice. While no mile-thick ice-sheet descends to the Mediterranean or\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, glaciers intrude into all the valleys, and the\r\nflora and fauna of the temperate regions become arctic; that is to\r\nsay, only those varieties of plants and animals survive in those\r\nregions that are able to stand the cold, and these we now call arctic.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this darkness and cold and snow, the remnants of poor\r\nhumanity wander over the face of the desolated world; stumbling,\r\nawe-struck, but filled with an insatiable hunger which drives them\r\non; living upon the bark of the few trees that have escaped, or on\r\nthe bodies of the animals that have perished, and even upon one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAll this we shall find plainly depicted in the legends of mankind, as\r\nwe proceed.\r\n\r\nSteadily, steadily, steadily--for days, weeks, months, years--the\r\nrains and snows fall; and, as the clouds are drained, they become\r\nthinner and thinner, and the light increases.\r\n\r\nIt has now grown so light that the wanderers can mark the difference\r\nbetween night and day. \"And the evening and the morning were the\r\nfirst day.\"\r\n\r\nDay by day it grows lighter and warmer; the piled-up snows begin to\r\nmelt. It is an age of tremendous floods. All the low-lying parts of\r\nthe continents are covered with water. Brooks become mighty rivers,\r\nand rivers are floods; the Drift _débris_ is cut into by the waters,\r\nre-arranged, piled up in what is called the stratified, secondary, or\r\nChamplain drift. Enormous river-valleys are cut out of the gravel and\r\nclay.\r\n\r\nThe seeds and roots of trees and grasses, uncovered by the rushing\r\ntorrents, and catching the increasing\r\n\r\n{p. 111}\r\n\r\nwarmth, begin to put forth green leaves. The sad and parti-colored\r\nearth, covered with white, red, or blue clays and gravels, once more,\r\nwears a fringe of green.\r\n\r\nThe light increases. The warmth lifts up part of the water already\r\ncast down, and the outflow of the steaming ice-fields, and pours it\r\ndown again in prodigious floods. It is an age of storms.\r\n\r\nThe people who have escaped gather together. _They know the sun is\r\ncoming back_. They know this desolation is to pass away. They build\r\ngreat fires and make human sacrifices to bring back the sun. They\r\npoint and guess where he will appear; for they have lost all\r\nknowledge of the cardinal points. And all this is told in the legends.\r\n\r\nAt last the great, the godlike, the resplendent luminary breaks\r\nthrough the clouds and looks again upon the wrecked earth.\r\n\r\nOh, what joy, beyond all words, comes upon those who see him! They\r\nfall upon their faces. They worship him whom the dread events have\r\ntaught to recognize as the great god of life and light. They burn or\r\ncast down their animal gods of the pre-glacial time, and then begins\r\nthat world-wide worship of the sun which has continued down to our\r\nown times.\r\n\r\nAnd all this, too, we shall find told in the legends.\r\n\r\nAnd from that day to this we live under the influence of the effects\r\nproduced by the comet. The mild, eternal summer of the Tertiary age\r\nis gone. The battle between the sun and the ice-sheets continues.\r\nEvery north wind brings us the breath of the snow; every south wind\r\nis part of the sun's contribution to undo the comet's work. A\r\ncontinual amelioration of climate has been going on since the Glacial\r\nage; and, if no new catastrophe falls on the earth, our remote\r\nposterity will yet see the last snow-bank\r\n\r\n{p. 112}\r\n\r\nof Greenland melted, and the climate of the Eocene reestablished in\r\nSpitzbergen.\r\n\r\n\"It has been suggested that the warmth of the Tertiary climate was\r\nsimply the effect of the residual heat of a globe cooling from\r\nincandescence, but many facts disprove this. For example, the fossil\r\nplants found in our Lower Cretaceous rocks in Central North America\r\nindicate a temperate climate in latitude 35° to 40° in the Cretaceous\r\nage. The coal-flora, too, and the beds of coal, indicate a moist,\r\nequable, and warm but not hot climate in the Carboniferous age,\r\nmillions of years before the Tertiary, and three thousand miles\r\nfarther south than localities where magnolias, tulip-trees, and\r\ndeciduous cypresses, grew in the latter age. Some learned and\r\ncautious geologists even assert that there have been several Ice\r\nperiods, one as far back as the Devonian.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe ice-fields and wild climate of the poles, and the cold which\r\ndescends annually over Europe and North America, represent the\r\nresiduum of the refrigeration caused by the evaporation due to the\r\ncomet's heat, and the long absence of the sun during the age of\r\ndarkness. Every visitation of a comet would, therefore, necessarily\r\neventuate in a glacial age, which in time would entirely pass away.\r\nAnd our storms are bred of the conflict between the heat and cold of\r\nthe different latitudes. Hence, it may be, that the Tertiary climate\r\nrepresented the true climate of the earth, undisturbed by comet\r\ncatastrophes; a climate equable, mild, warm, stormless. Think what a\r\nworld this would be without tempests, cyclones, ice, snow, or cold!\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to the evidences that man dwelt on the earth during\r\nthe Drift, and that he has preserved recollections of the comet to\r\nthis day in his myths and legends.\r\n\r\n[1. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" July, 1876, p. 283.]\r\n\r\n{p. 113}\r\n\r\n                               PART III\r\n\r\n                              The Legends\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                         THE NATURE OF MYTHS.\r\n\r\nIN a primitive people the mind of one generation precisely repeats\r\nthe minds of all former generations; the construction of the\r\nintellectual nature varies no more, from age to age, than the form of\r\nthe body or the color of the skin; the generations feel the same\r\nemotions, and think the same thoughts, and use the same expressions.\r\nAnd this is to be expected, for the brain is as much a part of the\r\ninheritable, material organization as the color of the eyes or the\r\nshape of the nose.\r\n\r\nThe minds of men move automatically: no man thinks because he intends\r\nto think; he thinks, as he hungers and thirsts, under a great primal\r\nnecessity; his thoughts come out from the inner depths of his being\r\nas the flower is developed by forces rising through the roots of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe female bird says to herself, \"The time is propitious, and now, of\r\nmy own free will, and under the operation of my individual judgment,\r\nI will lay a nestful of eggs and batch a brood of children.\" But it\r\nis unconscious that it is moved by a physical necessity, which has\r\nconstrained all its ancestors from the beginning of time,\r\n\r\n{p. 114}\r\n\r\nand which will constrain all its posterity to the end of time; that\r\nits will is nothing more than an expression of age, development,\r\nsunlight, food, and \"the skyey influences.\" If it were otherwise it\r\nwould be in the power of a generation to arrest the life of a race.\r\n\r\nAll great thoughts are inspirations of God. They are part of the\r\nmechanism by which he advances the race; they are new varieties\r\ncreated out of old genera.\r\n\r\nThere come bursts of creative force in history, when great thoughts\r\nare born, and then again Brahma, as the Hindoos say, goes to sleep\r\nfor ages.\r\n\r\nBut, when the fever of creation comes, the poet, the inventor, or the\r\nphilosopher can no more arrest the development of his own thoughts\r\nthan the female bird, by her will-power, can stop the growth of the\r\nova within her, or arrest the fever in the blood which forces her to\r\nincubation.\r\n\r\nThe man who wrote the Shakespeare plays recognized this involuntary\r\noperation of even his own transcendent intellect, when he said:\r\n\r\n     \"Our poesy is a gum which oozes\r\n     From whence 'tis nourished.\"\r\n\r\nIt came as the Arabian tree distilled its \"medicinal gum\"; it was the\r\nmere expression of an internal force, as much beyond his control as\r\nthe production of the gum was beyond the control of the tree.\r\n\r\nBut in primitive races mind repeats mind for thousands of years. If a\r\ntale is told at a million hearth-fires, the probabilities are small,\r\nindeed, that any innovation at one hearth-fire, however ingenious,\r\nwill work its way into and modify the narration at all the rest.\r\nThere is no printing-press to make the thoughts of one man the\r\nthoughts of thousands. While the innovator is modifying\r\n\r\n{p. 115}\r\n\r\nthe tale, to his own satisfaction, to his immediate circle of\r\nhearers, the narrative is being repeated in its unchanged form at all\r\nthe rest. The doctrine of chances is against innovation. The majority\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, a marvelous tale is told to the new generation--to the\r\nlittle ones sitting around with open eyes and gaping mouths--they\r\nnaturally ask, \"_Where_ did all this occur?\" The narrator must\r\nsatisfy this curiosity, and so he replies, \"On yonder mountain-top,\"\r\nor \"In yonder cave.\"\r\n\r\nThe story has come down without its geography, and a new geography is\r\ngiven it.\r\n\r\nAgain, an ancient word or name may have a signification in the\r\nlanguage in which the story is told different from that which it\r\npossessed in the original dialect, and, in the effort to make the old\r\nfact and the new language harmonize, the story-teller is forced,\r\ngradually, to modify the narrative; and, as this lingual difficulty\r\noccurs at every fireside, at every telling, an ingenious explanation\r\ncomes at last to be generally accepted, and the ancient myth remains\r\ndressed in a new suit of linguistic clothes.\r\n\r\nBut, as a rule, simple races repeat; they do not invent.\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago the highest faith was placed in written\r\nhistory, while the utmost contempt was felt for all legends. Whatever\r\nhad been written down was regarded as certainly true; whatever had\r\nnot been written down was necessarily false.\r\n\r\nWe are reminded of that intellectual old brute, Dr. Samuel Johnson,\r\ntrampling poor Macpherson under foot, like an enraged elephant, for\r\ndaring to say that he had collected from the mountaineers of wild\r\nScotland the poems of Ossian, and that they had been transmitted,\r\nfrom mouth to mouth, through ages. But the great epic of the son of\r\nFingal will survive, part of the widening\r\n\r\n{p. 116}\r\n\r\nheritage of humanity, while Johnson is remembered only as a\r\ncoarse-souled, ill-mannered incident in the development of the great\r\nEnglish people.\r\n\r\nBut as time rolled on it was seen that the greater part of history\r\nwas simply recorded legends, while all the rest represented the\r\npassions of factions, the hates of sects, or the servility and\r\nvenality of historians. Men perceived that the common belief of\r\nantiquity, as expressed in universal tradition, was much more likely\r\nto be true than the written opinions of a few prejudiced individuals.\r\n\r\nAnd then grave and able men,--philosophers, scientists,--were seen\r\nwith note-books and pencils, going out into Hindoo villages, into\r\nGerman cottages, into Highland huts, into Indian _tepees_, in short,\r\ninto all lands, taking down with the utmost care, accuracy, and\r\nrespect, the fairy-stories, myths, and legends of the people;--as\r\nrepeated by old peasant-women, \"the knitters in the sun,\" or by\r\n\"gray-haired warriors, famousèd for fights.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, when they came to put these narratives in due form, and, as it\r\nwere, in parallel columns, it became apparent that they threw great\r\nfloods of light upon the history of the world, and especially upon\r\nthe question of the unity of the race. They proved that all the\r\nnations were repeating the same stories, in some cases in almost\r\nidentical words, just as their ancestors had heard them, in some most\r\nancient land, in \"the dark background and abysm of time,\" when the\r\nprogenitors of the German, Gaul, Gael, Greek, Roman, Hindoo, Persian,\r\nEgyptian, Arabian, and the red-people of America, dwelt together\r\nunder the same roof-tree and used the same language.\r\n\r\nBut, above all, these legends prove the absolute fidelity of the\r\nmemory of the races.\r\n\r\nWe are told that the bridge-piles driven by the Romans, two thousand\r\nyears ago, in the rivers of Europe,\r\n\r\n{p. 117}\r\n\r\nfrom which the surrounding waters have excluded the decaying\r\natmosphere, have remained altogether unchanged in their condition. If\r\nthis has been the case for two thousand years, why would they not\r\nremain unchanged for ten thousand, for a hundred thousand years? If\r\nthe ice in which that Siberian mammoth was incased had preserved it\r\nintact for a hundred years, or a thousand years, why might it not\r\nhave preserved it for ten thousand, for a hundred thousand years?\r\n\r\nPlace a universal legend in the minds of a race, let them repeat it\r\nfrom generation to generation, and time ceases to be an element in\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\nLegend has one great foe to its perpetuation--civilization.\r\n\r\nCivilization brings with it a contempt for everything which it can\r\nnot understand; skepticism becomes the synonym for intelligence; men\r\nno longer repeat; they doubt; they dissect; they sneer; they reject;\r\nthey invent. If the myth survives this treatment, the poets take it\r\nup and make it their stock in trade: they decorate it in a masquerade\r\nof frippery and finery, feathers and furbelows, like a clown dressed\r\nfor a fancy ball; and the poor barbarian legend survives at last, if\r\nit survives at all, like the Conflagration in Ovid or King Arthur in\r\nTennyson--a hippopotamus smothered in flowers, jewels, and laces.\r\n\r\nHence we find the legends of the primitive American Indians adhering\r\nquite closely to the events of the past, while the myths that survive\r\nat all among the civilized nations of Europe are found in garbled\r\nforms, and. only among the peasantry of remote districts.\r\n\r\nIn the future more and more attention will be given to the myths of\r\nprimitive races; they will be accounted as more reliable, and as\r\nreaching farther back in time than many things which we call history.\r\nThoughtful men will\r\n\r\n{p. 118}\r\n\r\nanalyze them, despising nothing; like a chemist who resolves some\r\ncompound object into its original elements--the very combination\r\nconstituting a history of the object.\r\n\r\nH. H. Bancroft describes myths as--\r\n\r\n\"A mass of fragmentary truth and fiction, not open to rationalistic\r\ncriticism; a partition wall of allegories, built of dead facts\r\ncemented with wild fancies; it looms ever between the immeasurable\r\nand the measurable past.\"\r\n\r\nBut he adds:\r\n\r\n\"Never was there a time in the history of philosophy when the\r\ncharacter, customs, and beliefs of aboriginal man, and everything\r\nappertaining to him, were held in such high esteem by scholars as at\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is now a recognized principle of philosophy that no religious\r\nbelief, however crude, nor any historical tradition, however absurd,\r\ncan be held by the majority of a people for any considerable time as\r\ntrue, without having had in the beginning some foundation in fact.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAn universal myth points to two conclusions:\r\n\r\nFirst, that it is based on some fact.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that it dates back, in all probability, to the time when\r\nthe ancestors of the races possessing it had not yet separated.\r\n\r\nA myth should be analyzed carefully; the fungi that have attached\r\nthemselves to it should be brushed off; the core of fact should be\r\nseparated from the decorations and errors of tradition.\r\n\r\nBut above all, it must be remembered that we can not depend upon\r\neither the geography or the chronology of a myth. As I have shown,\r\nthere is a universal tendency to give the old story a new habitat,\r\nand hence we have Ararats and Olympuses all over the world. In the\r\nsame\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Native Races of America,\" vol. iii, p. 14.]\r\n\r\n{p. 119}\r\n\r\nway the myth is always brought down and attached to more recent\r\nevents:\r\n\r\n\"All over Europe-in Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, England,\r\nScotland, Ireland--the exploits of the oldest mythological heroes,\r\nfiguring in the Sagas, Eddas, and Nibelungen Lied, have been\r\nascribed, in the folk-lore and ballads of the people, to Barbarossa,\r\nCharlemagne, Boabdil, Charles V, William Tell, Arthur, Robin Hood,\r\nWallace, and St. Patrick.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn the next place, we must remember how impossible it is for the mind\r\nto invent an entirely new fact.\r\n\r\nWhat dramatist or novelist has ever yet made a plot which did not\r\nconsist of events that had already transpired somewhere on earth? He\r\nmight intensify events, concentrate and combine them, or amplify\r\nthem; but that is all. Men in all ages have suffered from\r\njealousy,--like Othello; have committed murders,--like Macbeth; have\r\nyielded to the sway of morbid minds,--like Hamlet; have stolen, lied,\r\nand debauched,--like Falstaff;--there are Oliver Twists, Bill\r\nSykeses, and Nancies; Micawbers, Pickwicks, and Pecksniffs in every\r\ngreat city.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the mind of man that has not preexisted in\r\nnature. Can we imagine a person, who never saw or heard of an\r\nelephant, drawing a picture of such a two-tailed creature? It was\r\nthought at one time that man had made the flying-dragon out of his\r\nown imagination; but we now know that the image of the _pterodactyl_\r\nhad simply descended from generation to generation. Sindbad's great\r\nbird, the _roc_, was considered a flight of the Oriental fancy, until\r\nscience revealed the bones of the _dinornis_. All the winged beasts\r\nbreathing fire are simply a recollection of the comet.\r\n\r\nIn fact, even with the patterns of nature before it, the\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft, \"Native Races,\" note, vol. iii, p. 17.]\r\n\r\n{p. 120}\r\n\r\nhuman mind has not greatly exaggerated them: it has never drawn a\r\nbird larger than the _dinornis_ or a beast greater than the mammoth.\r\n\r\nIt is utterly impossible that the races of the whole world, of all\r\nthe continents and islands, could have preserved traditions from the\r\nmost remote ages, of a comet having struck the earth, of the great\r\nheat, the conflagration, the cave-life, the age of darkness, and the\r\nreturn of the sun, and yet these things have had no basis of fact. It\r\nwas not possible for the primitive mind to have imagined these things\r\nif they had never occurred.\r\n\r\n{p. 121}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                    DID MAN EXIST BEFORE THE DRIFT?\r\n\r\nFIRST, let us ask ourselves this question, Did man exist before the\r\nDrift?\r\n\r\nIf he did, he must have survived it; and he could hardly have passed\r\nthrough it without some remembrance of such a terrible event\r\nsurviving in the traditions of the race.\r\n\r\nIf he did not exist before the Drift, of course, no myths descriptive\r\nof it could have come down to us.\r\n\r\nThis preliminary question must, then, be settled by testimony.\r\n\r\nLet us call our witnesses\r\n\r\n\"The palæolithic hunter of the mid and late Pleistocene\r\nriver-deposits in Europe belongs, as we have already shown, to a\r\nfauna which arrived in Britain before the lowering of the temperature\r\nproduced glaciers and icebergs in our country; he may, therefore, be\r\nviewed as being probably pre-glacial.\"[1]\r\n\r\nMan had spread widely over the earth before the Drift; therefore, he\r\nhad lived long on the earth. His remains have been found in Scotland,\r\nEngland, Ireland, France, Spain, Italy, Greece; in Africa, in\r\nPalestine, in India, and in the United States.[2]\r\n\r\n\"Man was living in the valley of the lower Thames before the Arctic\r\nmammalia had taken full possession of\r\n\r\n[1. Dawkins's \"Early Man in Britain,\" p. 169.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., pp. 165, 166.]\r\n\r\n{p. 122 }\r\n\r\nthe valley of the Thames, and before the big-nosed rhinoceros had\r\nbecome extinct.\"[1]\r\n\r\nMr. Tidderman[2] writes that, among a number of bones obtained during\r\nthe exploration of the Victoria Cave, near Settle, Yorkshire, there\r\nis one which Mr. Busk has identified as _human_. Mr. Busk says:\r\n\r\n\"The bone is, I have no doubt, human; a portion of an unusually\r\nclumsy fibula, and in that respect not unlike the same bone in the\r\nMentone skeleton.\"\r\n\r\nThe deposit from which the bone was obtained is overlaid \"by a bed of\r\nstiff glacial clay, containing ice-scratched bowlders.\" \"Here then,\"\r\nsays Geikie, \"is direct proof that men lived in England prior to the\r\nlast inter-glacial period.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe evidences are numerous, as I have shown, that when these deposits\r\ncame upon the earth the face of the land was above the sea, and\r\noccupied by plants and animals.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\nSECTION AT ST. ACHEUL.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cut, taken from Sir John Lubbock's \"Prehistoric\r\nTimes,\" page 364, represents the strata at St. Acheul, near Amiens,\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[1. Dawkins's \"Early Man in Britain,\" p. 137.\r\n\r\n2. \"Nature,\" November 6, 1873.\r\n\r\n3. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 475.]\r\n\r\n{p. 123}\r\n\r\nThe upper stratum (_a_) represents a brick earth, four to five feet\r\nin thickness, and containing a few angular flints. The next (_b_) is\r\na thin layer of angular gravel, one to two feet in thickness. The\r\nnext (_c_) is a bed of sandy marl, five to six feet in thickness. The\r\nlowest deposit (_d_) _immediately overlies the chalk_; it is a bed of\r\npartially rounded gravel, and, in this, _human implements of flint\r\nhave been found_. The spot was used in the early Christian period as\r\na cemetery; _f_ represents one of the graves, made fifteen hundred\r\nyears ago; _e_ represents one of the ancient coffins, of which only\r\nthe nails and clamps are left, every particle of the wood having\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nAnd, says Sir John Lubbock:\r\n\r\n\"It is especially at the _lower part_\" of these lowest deposits \"that\r\nthe flint implements occur.\"\r\n\r\nThe bones of the mammoth, the wild bull, the deer, the horse, the\r\nrhinoceros, and the reindeer are found near the bottom of these\r\nstrata mixed with the flint implements of men.\r\n\r\n\"All the fossils belong to animals which live on land; . . . we find\r\nno marine remains.\"[2]\r\n\r\nRemember that the Drift is unfossiliferous and unstratified; that it\r\nfell _en masse_, and that these remains are found in its lower part,\r\nor _caught between it and the rocks below it_, and you can form a\r\nvivid picture of the sudden and terrible catastrophe. The trees were\r\nimbedded with man and the animals; the bones of men, smaller and more\r\nfriable, probably perished, ground up in the tempest, while only\r\ntheir flint implements and the great bones of the larger animals,\r\nhard as stones, remain to tell the dreadful story. And yet some human\r\nbones\r\n\r\n[1. \"Prehistoric Times,\" p. 366.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., pp. 366, 367.]\r\n\r\n{p. 124}\r\n\r\nhave been found; a lower jaw-bone was discovered in a pit at\r\nMoulinguignon, and a skull and other bones were found in the valley\r\nof the Seine by M. Bertrand.[1]\r\n\r\nAnd these discoveries have not been limited to river-gravels. In the\r\nShrub Hill gravel-bed in England, \"_in the lowest part of it_,\r\nnumerous flint implements of the palæolithic type have been\r\ndiscovered.\"[2]\r\n\r\nWe have, besides these sub-drift remains, the skulls of men who\r\nprobably lived before the great cataclysm,--men who may have looked\r\nupon the very comet that smote the world. They represent two widely\r\ndifferent races. One is \"the Engis skull,\" so called from the cave of\r\nEngis, near Liége, where it was found by Dr. Schmerling. \"It is a\r\nfair average human skull, which might,\" says Huxley, \"have belonged\r\nto a philosopher, or might have contained the thoughtless brains of a\r\nsavage.\"[3] It represents a\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                           THE ENGIS SKULL.\r\n\r\ncivilized, if not a cultivated, race of men. It may represent a\r\nvictim, a prisoner, held for a cannibalistic feast or a trader from a\r\nmore civilized region.\r\n\r\n[1. \"Prehistoric Times,\" p. 360.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 351.\r\n\r\n3. \"Man's Place in Nature,\" p. 156.]\r\n\r\n{p. 125}\r\n\r\nIn another cave, in the Neanderthal, near Hochdale, between\r\nDüsseldorf and Elberfeld, a skull was found which is the most\r\nape-like of all known human crania. The mail to whom it belonged must\r\nhave been a barbarian brute of the rudest possible type. Here is a\r\nrepresentation of it.\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                        THE NEANDERTHAL SKULL.\r\n\r\nI beg the reader to remember these skulls when he comes to read, a\r\nlittle further on, the legend told by an American Indian tribe of\r\nCalifornia, describing the marriage between the daughter of the gods\r\nand a son of the grizzly bears, from which union, we are told, came\r\nthe Indian tribes. These skulls represent creatures as far apart, I\r\nwas about to say, as gods and bears. The \"Engis skull,\" with its full\r\nfrontal brain-pan, its fine lines, and its splendidly arched dome,\r\ntells us of ages of cultivation and development in some favored\r\ncenter of the race; while the horrible and beast-like proportions of\r\n\"the Neanderthal skull\" speak, with no less certainty, of\r\nundeveloped, brutal, savage man, only a little above the gorilla in\r\ncapacity;--a prowler, a robber, a murderer, a cave-dweller, a\r\ncannibal, a Cain.\r\n\r\n{p. 126}\r\n\r\nWe shall see, as we go on in the legends of the races on both sides\r\nof the Atlantic, that they all looked to some central land, east of\r\nAmerica and west of Europe, some island of the ocean, where dwelt a\r\ngodlike race, and where alone, it would seem, the human race was\r\npreserved to repeople the earth, while these brutal representatives\r\nof the race, the Neanderthal people, were crushed out.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not mere theorizing. It is conceded, as the result of\r\nmost extensive scientific research:\r\n\r\n1. That the great southern mammalia perished in Europe when the Drift\r\ncame upon the earth.\r\n\r\n2. It is conceded that these two skulls are associated with the bones\r\nof these locally extinct animals, mingled together in the same\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n3. The conclusion is, therefore, logically irresistible, that these\r\nskulls belonged to men who lived during or before the Drift Age.\r\n\r\nMany authorities support this proposition that man--palæolithic man,\r\nman of the mammoth and the mastodon--existed in the caves of Europe\r\nbefore the Drift.\r\n\r\n\"After having occupied the English caves for untold ages, palæolithic\r\nman disappeared for ever, and with him vanished many animals now\r\neither locally or wholly extinct.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAbove the remains of man in these caves comes a deposit of\r\nstalagmite, twelve feet in thickness, indicating a vast period of\r\ntime during which it was being formed, and during this time _man was\r\nabsent_.[2]\r\n\r\nAbove this stalagmite comes another deposit of cave-earth:\r\n\r\n\"The deposits immediately _overlying_ the stalagmite and cave-earth\r\ncontain an almost _totally different assemblage_\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 411.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 411.]\r\n\r\n{p. 127}\r\n\r\n_of animal remains_, along with relics of the neolithic, bronze,\r\niron, and historic periods.\r\n\r\n\"There is no passage, but, on the contrary, a _sharp and abrupt\r\nbreak_ between these later deposits and the underlying palæolithic\r\naccumulations.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere we have the proof that man inhabited these caves for ages before\r\nthe Drift; that he perished with the great mammals and disappeared;\r\nand that the twelve feet of stalagmite were formed while no men and\r\nfew animals dwelt in Europe. But some fragment of the human race had\r\nescaped elsewhere, in some other region; there it multiplied and\r\nreplenished the earth, and gradually extended and spread again over\r\nEurope, and reappeared in the cave-deposits above the stalagmite.\r\nAnd, in like manner, the animals gradually came in from the regions\r\non which the Drift had not fallen.\r\n\r\nBut the revelations of the last few years prove, not only that man\r\nlived during the Drift age, and that he dwelt on the earth when the\r\nDrift fell, but that he can be traced backward for ages before the\r\nDrift; and that he was contemporary with species of great animals\r\nthat had run their course, and ceased to exist centuries, perhaps\r\nthousands of years, before the Drift.\r\n\r\nI quote a high authority:\r\n\r\n\"Most of the human relics of any sort have been found in the more\r\nrecent layers of the Drift. They have been discovered, however, not\r\nonly in the older Drift, but also, though very rarely, _in the\r\nunderlying Tertiary_. For instance, in the Upper Pliocene at St.\r\nPrest, near Chartres, were found stone implements and cuttings on\r\nbone, in connection with relics of a long-extinct elephant (_Elephas\r\nmeridionalis_) _that is wholly lacking in the Drift_. During the past\r\ntwo years the evidences of human existence in the Tertiary period, i.\r\ne., previous to the age of mammoths\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 411.]\r\n\r\n{p. 128}\r\n\r\nof the Diluvial period, have multiplied, and by their multiplication\r\ngive cumulative confirmation to each other. Even in the lower strata\r\nof the Miocene (the middle Tertiary) important discoveries of stone\r\nknives and bone-cuttings have been made, as at Thenay, department of\r\nMarne-et-Loire, and Billy, department of Allier, France. Professor J.\r\nD. Whitney, the eminent State geologist of California, reports\r\nsimilar discoveries there also. So, then, we may believe that before\r\nthe last great upheaval of the Alps and Pyrenees, and while the yet\r\nluxuriant vegetation of the then (i. e., in the Tertiary period)\r\nparadisaic climate yet adorned Central Europe, man inhabited this\r\nregion.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWe turn to the American Continent and we find additional proofs of\r\nman's pre-glacial existence. The \"American Naturalist,\" 1873, says:\r\n\r\n\"The discoveries that are constantly being made in this country are\r\nproving that man existed on this continent as far back in geological\r\ntime as on the European Continent; and it even seems that America,\r\nreally the Old World, geologically, will soon prove to be the\r\nbirthplace of the earliest race of man. One of the late and important\r\ndiscoveries is that by Mr. E. L. Berthoud, which is given in full,\r\nwith a map, in the 'Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of\r\nSciences for 1872,' p. 46. Mr. Berthoud there reports the discovery\r\nof ancient fire-places, rude stone monuments, and implements of stone\r\nin great number and variety, in several places along Crow Creek, in\r\nColorado, and also on several other rivers in the vicinity. These\r\nfire-places indicate several ancient sites of an unknown race\r\ndiffering entirely from the mound-builders and the present Indians,\r\nwhile the shells and other fossils found with the remains make it\r\nquite certain that the deposit in which the ancient sites are found\r\n_is as old as the Pliocene, and perhaps as the Miocene_. As the\r\nfossil shells found with the relies of man are of estuary forms, and\r\nas the sites of the ancient towns are on extended\r\n\r\n[1. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" April, 1875, p. 682.]\r\n\r\n{p. 129}\r\n\r\npoints of land, and at the base of the ridges or bluffs, Mr. Berthoud\r\nthinks the evidence is strongly in favor of the locations having been\r\nnear some ancient fresh-water lake, whose vestiges the present\r\ntopography of the region favors.\"\r\n\r\nI quote the following from the \"Scientific American\" (1880):\r\n\r\n\"The finding of numerous relies of a buried race on an ancient\r\nhorizon, _from twenty to thirty feet below the present level of\r\ncountry in Missouri and Kansas_, has been noted. The St. Louis\r\n'Republican' gives particulars of another find of an unmistakable\r\ncharacter made last spring (1880) in Franklin County, Missouri, by\r\nDr. R. W. Booth, who was engaged in iron-mining about three miles\r\nfrom Dry Branch, a station on the St. Louis and Santa Fé Railroad. At\r\na depth of _eighteen feet below the surface_ the miners uncovered a\r\nhuman skull, with portions of the ribs, vertebral column, and\r\ncollar-bone. With them were found two flint arrow-heads of the most\r\nprimitive type, imperfect in shape and barbed. _A few pieces of\r\ncharcoal were also found_ at the same time and place. Dr. Booth was\r\nfully aware of the importance of the discovery, and tried to preserve\r\neverything found, but upon touching the skull it crumbled to dust,\r\nand some of the other bones broke into small pieces and partly\r\ncrumbled away; but enough was preserved to fully establish the fact\r\nthat they are human bones.\r\n\r\n\"Some fifteen or twenty days subsequent to the first finding, at a\r\ndepth of _twenty-four feet below the surface_, other bones were\r\nfound--a thigh-bone and a portion of the vertebra, and several pieces\r\nof _charred wood, the bones apparently belonging to the first-found\r\nskeleton_. In both cases the bones rested on a fibrous stratum,\r\nsuspected at the time to be a fragment of coarse matting. This lay\r\nupon a floor of soft _but solid iron-ore_, which retained the imprint\r\nof the fibers. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The indications are that the filled cavity had originally been a\r\nsort of cave, and that the supposed matting was more probably a layer\r\nof twigs, rushes, or weeds, which the inhabitants of the cave had\r\nused as a bed, as the fiber\r\n\r\n{p. 130}\r\n\r\nmarks cross each other irregularly. The ore-bed in which the remains\r\nwere found, and part of which seems to have formed after the period\r\nof human occupation of the cave, lies in the second (or saccharoidal)\r\nsandstone of the Lower Silurian.\"\r\n\r\nNote the facts: The remains of this man are found separated--part are\r\neighteen feet below the surface, part twenty-four feet--that is, they\r\nare _six feet apart_. How can we account for this condition of\r\nthings, except by supposing that the poor savage had rushed for\r\nsafety to his shallow rock-shelter, and had there been caught by the\r\nworld-tempest, and _torn to pieces_ and deposited in fragments with\r\nthe _débris_ that filled his rude home?\r\n\r\nIn California we encounter a still more surprising state of things.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Calaveras skull was found in a shaft _one hundred and\r\nfifty feet deep_, under five beds of lava and volcanic tufa, and four\r\nbeds of auriferous gravel.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cut represents a plummet found in digging a well in\r\nthe San Joaquin Valley, California, _thirty feet below the surface_.\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                PLUMMET FROM SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY, CAL.\r\n\r\nDr. Foster says:\r\n\r\n\"In examining this beautiful relic, one is led almost instinctively\r\nto believe that it was used as a plummet, for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the perpendicular to the horizon [for building\r\npurposes?]; . . . when we consider its symmetry of form, the contrast\r\nof colors brought out by the process of grinding and polishing, and\r\nthe delicate drilling of the hole through a material (syenite) so\r\nliable to fracture, we are free to say it affords an exhibition of\r\nthe lapidary's skill superior to anything yet furnished by the Stone\r\nage of either continent.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Prehistoric Races of the United States,\" p. 55.]\r\n\r\n{p. 131}\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana, layers of pottery, _six inches thick_, with remnants of\r\nmatting and baskets, were found _twelve feet below the surface_, and\r\nunderneath what Dr. Foster believes to be strata of the Drift.[1]\r\n\r\nI might fill pages with similar testimony; but I think I have given\r\nenough to satisfy the reader that man _did_ exist before the Drift.\r\n\r\nI shall discuss the subject still further when I come to consider, in\r\na subsequent chapter, the question whether pre-glacial man was or was\r\nnot civilized.\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Prehistoric Races of the United States,\" p. 56.]\r\n\r\n{p. 132}\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                  LEGENDS OF THE COMING OF THE COMET.\r\n\r\nWE turn now to the legends of mankind.\r\n\r\nI shall try to divide them, so as to represent, in their order, the\r\nseveral stages of the great event. This, of course, will be difficult\r\nto do, for the same legend may detail several different parts of the\r\nsame common story; and hence there may be more or less repetition;\r\nthey will more or less overlap each other.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, I shall present one or two legends that most clearly\r\nrepresent the first coming of the monster, the dragon, the serpent,\r\nthe wolf, the dog, the Evil One, the Comet.\r\n\r\nThe second Hindoo \"Avatar\" gives the following description of the\r\nrapid advance of some dreadful object out of space, and its\r\ntremendous fall upon the earth:\r\n\r\n\"By the power of God there issued from the essence of Brahma a being\r\nshaped like a boar, _white and exceeding small_; this being, _in the\r\nspace of an hour_, grew to the size of an elephant of the largest\r\nsize, _and remained in the air_.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, it was an atmospheric, not a terrestrial creature.\r\n\r\n\"Brahma was astonished on beholding this figure, and discovered, by\r\nthe force of internal penetration, that it could be nothing but the\r\npower of the Omnipotent which had assumed a body and become visible.\r\nHe now felt that God is all in all, and all is from him, and all in\r\nhim;\r\n\r\n{p. 133}\r\n\r\nand said to Mareechee and his sons (the attendant genii): 'A\r\nwonderful animal has emanated from my essence; at first of the\r\nsmallest size, it has in one hour increased to this enormous bulk,\r\nand, without doubt, it is a portion of the almighty power.'\"\r\n\r\nBrahma, an earthly king, was at first frightened by the terrible\r\nspectacle in the air, and then claimed that he had produced it\r\nhimself!\r\n\r\n\"They were engaged in this conversation when that _vara_, or\r\n'boar-form,' suddenly uttered a sound _like the loudest thunder_, and\r\nthe echo reverberated and _shook all the quarters of the universe_.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the same terrible noise which, as I have already shown, would\r\nnecessarily result from the carbureted hydrogen of the comet\r\nexploding in our atmosphere. The legend continues:\r\n\r\n\"But still, under this dreadful awe of heaven, a certain wonderful\r\ndivine confidence secretly animated the hearts of Brahma, Mareechee,\r\nand the other genii, who immediately began praises and thanksgiving.\r\nThat _vara_ (boar-form) figure, hearing the power of the Vedas and\r\nMantras from their mouths, again made a loud noise, and _became a\r\ndreadful spectacle_. Shaking the _full flowing mane_ which hung down\r\nhis neck on both sides, and erecting the humid _hairs_ of his body,\r\nhe proudly displayed his two most exceedingly white tusks; then,\r\nrolling about his wine-colored (red) eyes, and erecting his _tail_,\r\nhe descended _from the region of the air_, and plunged headforemost\r\ninto the water. The whole body of water was convulsed by the motion,\r\nand began to rise in waves, while the guardian spirit of the sea,\r\nbeing terrified, began to tremble for his domain and cry for mercy.[1]\r\n\r\nflow fully does this legend accord with the descriptions of comets\r\ngiven by astronomers, the \"horrid hair,\" the mane, the animal-like\r\nhead! Compare it with Mr.\r\n\r\n[1. Maurice's \"Ancient History of Hindustan,\" vol. i, p. 304.]\r\n\r\n{p. 134}\r\n\r\nLockyer's account of Coggia's comet, as seen through Newell's large\r\nrefracting telescope at Ferndene, Gateshead, and which he described\r\nas having a head like \"_a fan-shaped projection of light_, with\r\n_ear-like appendages_, at each side, which sympathetically\r\ncomplemented each other at every change either of form or luminosity.\"\r\n\r\nWe turn to the legends of another race:\r\n\r\nThe Zendavesta of the ancient Persians[1] describes a period of\r\n\"great innocence and happiness on earth.\"\r\n\r\nThis represents, doubtless, the delightful climate of the Tertiary\r\nperiod, already referred to, when endless summer extended to the\r\npoles.\r\n\r\n\"There was a 'man-bull,' who resided on an elevated region, which the\r\ndeity had assigned him.\"\r\n\r\nThis was probably a line of kings or a nation, whose symbol was the\r\nbull, as we see in Bel or Baal, with the bull's horns, dwelling in\r\nsome elevated mountainous region.\r\n\r\n\"At last an evil one, denominated Ahriman, corrupted the world. After\r\nhaving _dared to visit heaven_\" (that is, he appeared first in the\r\nhigh heavens), \"he _descended upon the earth and assumed the form of\r\na serpent_.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, a serpent-like comet struck the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The man-bull was _poisoned by his venom_, and died in consequence of\r\nit. Meanwhile, Ahriman _threw the whole universe into confusion_\r\n(chaos), for that enemy of good mingled himself with everything,\r\nappeared everywhere, and sought to do mischief above and below.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall find all through these legends allusions to the poisonous\r\nand deadly gases brought to the earth by the comet: we have already\r\nseen that the gases which are proved to be associated with comets are\r\nfatal to life.\r\n\r\n[1. Faber's \"Horæ Mosaicæ,\" vol. i, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n{p. 135}\r\n\r\nAnd this, be it remembered, is not guess-work, but the revelation of\r\nthe spectroscope.\r\n\r\nThe traditions of the ancient Britons[1] tell us of an ancient time,\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n\"The profligacy of mankind had provoked the great Supreme to send a\r\npestilential wind upon the earth. A pure _poison descended, every\r\nblast was death_. At this time the patriarch, distinguished for his\r\nintegrity, _was shut up_, together with his select company, in the\r\n_inclosure with the strong door_. (The cave?) Here the just ones were\r\nsafe from injury. _Presently a tempest of fire arose. It split the\r\nearth asunder_ to the great deep. The lake Llion burst its bounds,\r\nand the waves of the sea lifted themselves on high around the borders\r\nof Britain, _the rain poured down from heaven, and the waters covered\r\nthe earth_.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the whole story told briefly, but with the regular\r\nsequence of events:\r\n\r\n1. The poisonous gases.\r\n\r\n2. The people seek shelter in the caves.\r\n\r\n3. The earth takes fire.\r\n\r\n4. The earth is cleft open; the fiords are made, and the trap-rocks\r\nburst forth.\r\n\r\n5. The rain pours down.\r\n\r\n6. There is a season of floods.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the Greek legends, as recorded by one of their most\r\nancient writers, Hesiod, we find the coming of the comet clearly\r\ndepicted.\r\n\r\nWe shall see here, and in many other legends, reference to the fact\r\nthat there was more than one monster in the sky. This is in\r\naccordance with what we now know to be true of comets. They often\r\nappear in pairs or even triplets. Within the past few years we have\r\nseen Biela's comet divide and form two separate comets, pursuing\r\n\r\n[1. \"Mythology of the British Druids,\" p. 226.]\r\n\r\n{p. 136}\r\n\r\ntheir course side by side. When the great comet of 1811 appeared,\r\nanother of almost equal magnitude followed it. Seneca informs us that\r\nEphoras, a Greek writer of the fourth century before Christ, had\r\nrecorded the singular fact of a comet's separation into two parts.\r\n\r\n\"This statement was deemed incredible by the Roman philosopher. More\r\nrecent observations of similar phenomena leave no room to question\r\nthe historian's veracity.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese annals record the appearance of _three_ comets--one large\r\nand two smaller ones--at the same time, in the year 896 of our era.\r\n\r\n\"They traveled together for three days. The little ones disappeared\r\nfirst and then the large one.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\"On June 27th, A. D. 416, two comets appeared in the constellation\r\nHercules, and pursued nearly the same path.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIf mere proximity to the earth served to split Biela's comet into two\r\nfragments, why might not a comet, which came near enough to strike\r\nthe earth, be broken into several separate forms?\r\n\r\nSo that there is nothing improbable in Hesiod's description of two or\r\nthree aërial monsters appearing at or about the same time, or of one\r\nbeing the apparent offspring of the other, since a large comet may,\r\nlike Biela's, have broken in two before the eyes of the people.\r\n\r\nHesiod tells us that the Earth united with Night to do a terrible\r\ndeed, by which the Heavens were much wronged. The Earth prepared a\r\nlarge sickle of white iron, with jagged teeth, and gave it to her son\r\nCronus, and stationed him in ambush, and when Heaven came, Cronus,\r\nhis son, grasped at him, and with his \"huge sickle, long and\r\njagged-toothed,\" cruelly wounded him.\r\n\r\n[1. Kirkwood, \"Comets and Meteors,\" p. 60.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 51.]\r\n\r\n{p. 137}\r\n\r\nWas this jagged, white, sickle-shaped object a comet?\r\n\r\n\"And Night bare also hateful Destiny, and black Fate, and Death, and\r\nNemesis.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Hesiod tells us that \"she,\" probably Night--\r\n\r\n\"Brought forth another monster, _irresistible_, nowise like to mortal\r\nman or immortal gods, in a hollow cavern; the divine,\r\nstubborn-hearted Echidna (half-nymph, with dark eyes and fair cheeks;\r\nand half, on the other hand, a _serpent, huge and terrible and\r\nvast_), _speckled_, and _flesh-devouring_, 'neath caves of sacred\r\nEarth. . . . With her, they say that Typhaon (Typhon) associated in\r\nlove, a terrible and lawless ravisher for the dark-eyed maid. . . .\r\nBut she (Echidna) bare Chimæra, _breathing resistless fire_, fierce\r\nand huge, fleet-footed as well as strong; this monster had three\r\nheads: one, indeed, of a grim-visaged lion, one of a goat, and\r\nanother of a serpent, a fierce dragon;\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n    COMET OF 1862. Aspect of the head of the comet at nine in the\r\n    evening, the 23d August, and the 24th August at the same hour.\r\n\r\n{p. 138}\r\n\r\nin front a lion, a dragon behind, and in the midst a goat, _breathing\r\nforth the dread strength of burning fire_. Her Pegasus slew and brave\r\nBellerophon.\"\r\n\r\nThe astronomical works show what weird, and fantastic, and\r\ngoblin-like shapes the comets assume under the telescope. Look at the\r\nrepresentation on page 137, from Guillemin's work,[1] of the\r\nappearance of the comet of 1862, giving the changes which took place\r\nin twenty-four hours. If we will imagine one of these monsters close\r\nto the earth, we can readily suppose that the excited people, looking\r\nat \"the dreadful spectacle,\" (as the Hindoo legend calls it,) saw it\r\ntaking the shapes of serpents, dragons, birds, and wolves.\r\n\r\nAnd Hesiod proceeds to tell us something more about this fiery,\r\nserpent-like monster:\r\n\r\n\"But when Jove had driven the Titans out from Heaven, huge Earth bare\r\nher youngest-born son, Typh&oelig;us (Typhaon, Typh&oelig;us,\r\nTyphon), by the embrace of Tartarus (Hell), through golden Aphrodite\r\n(Venus), whose hands, indeed, are apt for deeds on the score of\r\nstrength, and untiring the feet of the strong god; and from his\r\nshoulders there were a hundred heads of a serpent, a fierce dragon\r\nplaying with _dusky tongues_\" (_tongues of fire and smoke?_), \"and\r\nfrom the eyes in his wondrous heads are sparkled beneath the brows;\r\nwhilst from all his heads _fire was gleaming_, as he looked keenly.\r\nIn all his terrible heads, too, _were voices sending forth every kind\r\nof voice ineffable_. For one while, indeed, they would utter sounds,\r\nso as for the gods to understand, and at another time, again, the\r\nvoice of a loud-bellowing bull, untamable in force and proud in\r\nutterance; at another time, again, that of a lion possessing a daring\r\nspirit; at another time, again, they would sound like to whelps,\r\nwondrous to hear; and at another, he would hiss, and the lofty\r\nmountains resounded.\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Heavens,\" p. 256.]\r\n\r\n{p. 139}\r\n\r\n\"And, in sooth, then would there have been done a deed past remedy,\r\nand he, even he, would have reigned over mortals and immortals,\r\nunless, I wot, the sire of gods and men had quickly observed him.\r\nHarshly then he thundered, and heavily and terribly the earth\r\nre-echoed around; and the broad heaven above, and the sea and streams\r\nof ocean, and the abysses of earth. But beneath his immortal feet\r\n_vast Olympus trembled_, as the king uprose and earth groaned\r\nbeneath. And the _heat from both caught the dark-colored sea_, both\r\nof the thunder and the lightning, and _fire from the monster_, the\r\nheat arising from the thunder-storms, _winds_, and burning lightning.\r\n_And all earth, and heaven, and sea, were boiling_; and huge billows\r\nroared around the shores about and around, beneath the violence of\r\nthe gods; and _unallayed quaking arose_. Pluto trembled, monarch over\r\nthe dead beneath; and the Titans under Tartarus, standing about\r\nCronus, trembled also, on account of _the unceasing tumult and\r\ndreadful contention_. But Jove, when in truth he had raised high his\r\nwrath, and had taken his arms, his thunder and lightning, and smoking\r\nbolt, leaped up and smote him from Olympus, and scorched all around\r\nthe wondrous heads of the terrible monster.\r\n\r\n\"But when at length he had quelled it, after having smitten it with\r\nblows, the monster _fell down_, lamed, and _huge Earth groaned_. But\r\nthe _flame_ from the lightning-blasted monster _flashed forth in the\r\nmountain hollows_, hidden and rugged, when he was stricken, and _much\r\nwas the vast earth burnt and melted by the boundless vapor_, like as\r\npewter, heated by the art of youths, and by the well-bored\r\nmelting-pit, or iron, which is the hardest of metals, subdued in the\r\ndells of the mountain by blazing fire, melts in the sacred earth,\r\nbeneath the hands of Vulcan. So, I wot, _was earth melted in the\r\nglare of burning fire_. Then, troubled in spirit, he hurled him into\r\nwide Tartarus.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere we have a very faithful and accurate narrative of the coming of\r\nthe comet:\r\n\r\n[1. \"Theogony.\"]\r\n\r\n{p. 140}\r\n\r\nBorn of Night a monster appears, a serpent, huge, terrible, speckled,\r\nflesh-devouring. With her is another comet, Typhaon; they beget the\r\nChimæra, that breathes resistless fire, fierce, huge, swift. And\r\nTyphaon, associated with both these, is the most dreadful monster of\r\nall, born of Hell and sensual sin, a serpent, a fierce dragon,\r\nmany-headed, with dusky tongues and fire gleaming; sending forth\r\ndreadful and appalling noises, while mountains and fields rock with\r\nearthquakes; chaos has come; the earth, the sea boils; there is\r\nunceasing tumult and contention, and in the midst the monster,\r\nwounded and broken up, _falls upon the earth_; the earth groans under\r\nhis weight, and there he blazes and burns for a time in the mountain\r\nfastnesses and desert places, melting the earth with boundless vapor\r\nand glaring fire.\r\n\r\nWe will find legend after legend about this Typhon he runs through\r\nthe mythologies of different nations. And as to his size and his\r\nterrible power, they all agree. He was no earth-creature. He moved in\r\nthe air; he reached the skies:\r\n\r\n\"According to Pindar the head of Typhon reached to the stars, his\r\neyes darted fire, his hands extended from the East to the West,\r\nterrible serpents were twined about the middle of his body, and one\r\nhundred snakes took the place of fingers on his hands. Between him\r\nand the gods there was a dreadful war. Jupiter finally killed him\r\nwith a flash of lightning, and buried him under Mount Etna.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there, smoking and burning, his great throes and writhings, we\r\nare told, still shake the earth, and threaten mankind:\r\n\r\n     And with pale lips men say,\r\n     'To-morrow, perchance to-day,\r\n     Encelidas may arise! \"'\r\n\r\n{p. 141}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                               RAGNAROK\r\n\r\nTHERE is in the legends of the Scandinavians a marvelous record of\r\nthe coming of the Comet. It has been repeated generation after\r\ngeneration, translated into all languages, commented on, criticised,\r\nbut never understood. It has been regarded as a wild, unmeaning\r\nrhapsody of words, or as a premonition of some future earth\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nBut look at it!\r\n\r\nThe very name is significant. According to Professor Anderson's\r\netymology of the word, it means \"the darkness of the gods\"; from\r\n_regin_, gods, and _rökr_, darkness; but it may, more properly, be\r\nderived from the Icelandic, Danish, and Swedish _regn_, a rain, and\r\n_rök_, smoke, or dust; and it may mean the rain of dust, for the clay\r\ncame first as dust; it is described in some Indian legends as ashes.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is, as in the tradition of the Druids, page 135, _ante_,\r\nthe story of an age of crime.\r\n\r\nThe Vala looks upon the world, and, as the \"Elder Edda\" tells us--\r\n\r\n     There saw she wade\r\n     In the heavy streams,\r\n     Men--foul murderers\r\n     And perjurers,\r\n     And them who others' wives\r\n     Seduce to sin.\r\n     Brothers slay brothers\r\n     Sisters' children\r\n     Shed each other's blood. {p. 142}\r\n     Hard is the world!\r\n     Sensual sin grows huge.\r\n     There are sword-ages, axe-ages;\r\n     Shields are cleft in twain;\r\n     Storm-ages, murder ages;\r\n     Till the world falls dead,\r\n     And men no longer spare\r\n     Or pity one another.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe world has ripened for destruction; and \"Ragnarok,\" the darkness\r\nof the gods, or the rain of dust and ashes, comes to complete the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe whole story is told with the utmost detail, and we shall see that\r\nit agrees, in almost every particular, with what reason assures us\r\nmust have happened.\r\n\r\n\"There are three winters,\" or years, \"during which great wars rage\r\nover the world.\" Mankind has reached a climax of wickedness.\r\nDoubtless it is, as now, highly civilized in some regions, while\r\nstill barbarian in others.\r\n\r\n\"Then happens that which will seem a great miracle: that _the wolf\r\ndevours the sun_, and this will seem a great loss.\"\r\n\r\nThat is, the Comet strikes the sun, or approaches so close to it that\r\nit seems to do so.\r\n\r\n\"The other wolf devours the moon, and this, too, will cause great\r\nmischief.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the comets often come in couples or triplets.\r\n\r\n\"The stars shall be hurled from heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThis refers to the blazing _débris_ of the Comet falling to the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Then it shall come to pass that the earth will shake so violently\r\nthat trees will be torn up by the roots, the\r\n\r\n[1. Anderson, \"Norse Mythology,\" p. 416.]\r\n\r\n{p. 143}\r\n\r\nmountains will topple down, and all bonds and fetters will be broken\r\nand snapped.\"\r\n\r\nChaos has come again. How closely does all this agree with Hesiod's\r\ndescription of the shaking earth and the universal conflict of nature?\r\n\r\n\"The Fenris-wolf gets loose.\"\r\n\r\nThis, we shall see, is the name of one of the comets.\r\n\r\n\"_The sea rushes over the earth_, for the Midgard-serpent writhes in\r\ngiant rage, and seeks to gain the land.\"\r\n\r\nThe Midgard-serpent is the name of another comet; it strives to reach\r\nthe earth; its proximity disturbs the oceans. And then follows an\r\ninexplicable piece of mythology:\r\n\r\n\"The ship that is called Naglfar also becomes loose. It is made of\r\nthe nails of dead men; wherefore it is worth warning that, when a man\r\ndies with unpared nails, he supplies a large amount of materials for\r\nthe building of this ship, which both gods and men wish may be\r\nfinished as late as possible. But in this flood Naglfar gets afloat.\r\nThe giant Hrym is its steersman.\r\n\r\n\"The Fenris-wolf advances with wide-open mouth; _the upper jaw\r\nreaches to heaven and the lower jaw is on the earth_.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the comet extends from the earth to the sun.\r\n\r\n\"He would open it still wider had he room.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the space between the sun and earth is not great\r\nenough; the tail of the comet reaches even beyond the earth.\r\n\r\n\"_Fire flashes from his eyes and nostrils_.\"\r\n\r\nA recent writer says:\r\n\r\n\"When bright comets happen to come very near to the sun, and are\r\nsubjected to close observation under the\r\n\r\n{p. 144}\r\n\r\nadvantages which the fine telescopes of the present day afford, a\r\nseries of remarkable changes is found to take place in their luminous\r\nconfiguration. First, _jets of bright light start out from the\r\nnucleus_, and move through the fainter haze of the coma toward the\r\nsun; and then these jets are turned backward round the edge of the\r\ncoma, and stream from it, behind the comet, until they are fashioned\r\ninto a tail.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"The Midgard-serpent vomits forth _venom_, defiling all the air and\r\nthe sea; he is very terrible, and places himself _side by side with\r\nthe wolf_.\"\r\n\r\nThe two comets move together, like Biela's two fragments; and they\r\ngive out poison--the carbureted-hydrogen gas revealed by the\r\nspectroscope.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of this clash and din the heavens are rent in twain,\r\nand the sons of Muspelheim come riding through the opening.\"\r\n\r\nMuspelheim, according to Professor Anderson,[2] means the day of\r\njudgment.\" _Muspel_ signifies an abode of fire, peopled by fiends. So\r\nthat this passage means, that the heavens are split open, or appear\r\nto be, by the great shining comet, or comets, striking the earth; it\r\nis a world of fire; it is the Day of Judgment.\r\n\r\n\"Surt rides first, and before him and after _him flames burning\r\nfire_.\"\r\n\r\nSurt is a demon associated with the comet;[3] he is the same as the\r\ndestructive god of the Egyptian mythology, Set, who destroys the sun.\r\nIt may mean the blazing nucleus of the comet.\r\n\r\n\"He has a very good sword that shines brighter than the sun. As they\r\nride over Bifrost it breaks to pieces, as has before been stated.\"\r\n\r\n[1. \"Edinburgh Review,\" October, 1874, p. 207.\r\n\r\n2. \"Norse Mythology,\" p. 454.\r\n\r\n3. Ibid., p. 458.]\r\n\r\n{p. 145}\r\n\r\nBifrost, we shall have reason to see hereafter, was a prolongation of\r\nland westward from Europe, which connected the British Islands with\r\nthe island-home of the gods, or the godlike race of men.\r\n\r\nThere are geological proofs that such a land once existed. A writer,\r\nThomas Butler Gunn, in a recent number of an English publication,[1]\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"Tennyson's 'Voyage of Maeldune' is a magnificent allegorical\r\nexpansion of this idea; and the laureate has also finely commemorated\r\nthe old belief in the country of Lyonnesse, _extending beyond the\r\nbounds_ of Cornwall:\r\n\r\n     'A land of old upheaven from the abyss\r\n     By fire, _to sink into the abyss again_;\r\n     Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,\r\n     And the long mountains ended in a coast\r\n     Of ever-shifting sands, and far away\r\n     The phantom circle of a moaning sea.'\r\n\r\n\"Cornishmen of the last generation used to tell stories of strange\r\nhousehold relics picked up at the very low tides, nay, even of the\r\nquaint habitations seen fathoms deep in the water.\"\r\n\r\nThere are those who believe that these Scandinavian Eddas came, in\r\nthe first instance, from Druidical Briton sources.\r\n\r\nThe Edda may be interpreted to mean that the Comet strikes the planet\r\nwest of Europe, and crushes down some land in that quarter, called\r\n\"the bridge of Bifrost.\"\r\n\r\nThen follows a mighty battle between the gods and the Comet. It can\r\nhave, of course, but one termination; but it will recur again and\r\nagain in the legends of different nations. It was necessary that the\r\ngods, the protectors of mankind, should struggle to defend them\r\nagainst these strange and terrible enemies. But their very\r\nhelplessness\r\n\r\n[1. \"All the Year Round.\"]\r\n\r\n{p. 146}\r\n\r\nand their deaths show how immense was the calamity which had befallen\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe Edda continues:\r\n\r\n\"The sons of Muspel direct their course to the plain which is called\r\nVigrid. Thither repair also the Fenris-wolf and the Midgard-serpent.\"\r\n\r\nBoth the comets have fallen on the earth.\r\n\r\n\"To this place have also come Loke\" (the evil genius of the Norse\r\nmythology) \"and Hrym, and with him all the Frost giants. In Loke's\r\ncompany are all the friends of Hel\" (the goddess of death). \"The sons\r\nof Muspel have then their efficient bands alone by themselves. The\r\nplain Vigrid is one hundred miles (rasts) on each side.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, all these evil forces, the comets, the fire, the\r\ndevil, and death, have taken possession of the great plain, the heart\r\nof the civilized land. The scene is located in this spot, because\r\nprobably it was from this spot the legends were afterward dispersed\r\nto all the world.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for the defenders of mankind to rouse themselves.\r\nThere is no time to be lost, and, accordingly, we learn--\r\n\r\n\"While these things are happening, Heimdal\" (he was the guardian of\r\nthe Bifrost-bridge) \"stands up, blows with all his might in the\r\nGjallar-horn and _awakens all the gods_, who thereupon hold counsel.\r\nOdin rides to Mimer's well to ask advice of Mimer for himself and his\r\nfolk.\r\n\r\n\"Then quivers the ash Ygdrasil, and all things in heaven and earth\r\ntremble.\"\r\n\r\nThe ash Ygdrasil is the tree-of-life; the tree of the ancient\r\ntree-worship; the tree which stands on the top of the pyramid in the\r\nisland-birth place of the Aztec race; the tree referred to in the\r\nHindoo legends.\r\n\r\n\"The asas\" (the godlike men) \"and the einherjes\" (the heroes) \"arm\r\nthemselves and speed forth to the battlefield. Odin rides first; with\r\nhis golden helmet, resplendent\r\n\r\n{p. 147}\r\n\r\nbyrnie, and his spear Gungner, he advances against the Fenris-wolf\"\r\n(the first comet). \"Thor stands by his side, but can give him no\r\nassistance, for he has his hands full in his struggle with the\r\nMidgard-serpent\" (the second comet). \"Frey encounters Surt, and heavy\r\nblows are exchanged ere Frey falls. The cause of his death is that he\r\nhas not that good sword which he gave to Skirner. Even the dog Garm,\"\r\n(another comet), \"that was bound before the Gnipa-cave, gets loose.\r\nHe is the greatest plague. He contends with Tyr, and they kill each\r\nother. Thor gets great renown by slaying the Midgard-serpent, but\r\nretreats only nine paces when he falls to the earth dead, _poisoned\r\nby the venom that the serpent blows upon him_.\"\r\n\r\nHe has breathed the carbureted-hydrogen gas!\r\n\r\n\"The wolf swallows Odin, and thus causes his death; but Vidar\r\nimmediately turns and rushes at the wolf, placing one foot on his\r\nnether jaw.\r\n\r\n[\"On this foot he has the shoe, for which materials have been\r\ngathering through all ages, namely, the strips of leather which men\r\ncut off from the toes and heels of shoes; wherefore he who wishes to\r\nrender assistance to the asas must cast these strips away.\"]\r\n\r\nThis last paragraph, like that concerning the ship Naglfar, is\r\nprobably the interpolation of some later age. The narrative continues:\r\n\r\n\"With one hand Vidar seizes the upper jaw of the wolf, and thus rends\r\nasunder his mouth. Thus the wolf perishes. Loke fights with Heimdal,\r\nand they kill each other. _Thereupon Surt flings fire over the earth,\r\nand burns up all the world_.\"\r\n\r\nThis narrative is from the Younger Edda. The Elder Edda is to the\r\nsame purpose, but there are more allusions to the effect of the\r\ncatastrophe on the earth\r\n\r\n     The eagle screams,\r\n     _And with pale beak tears corpses_. . . .\r\n     Mountains dash together, {p. 148}\r\n     Heroes go the way to Hel,\r\n     And heaven is rent in twain. . . .\r\n     _All men abandon their homesteads_\r\n     When the warder of Midgard\r\n     In wrath slays the serpent.\r\n     _The sun grows dark,\r\n     The earth sinks into the sea_,\r\n     The bright stars\r\n     From heaven vanish;\r\n     _Fire rages,\r\n     Heat blazes,\r\n     And high flames play\r\n     'Gainst heaven itself_\"\r\n\r\nAnd what follow then? Ice and cold and winter. For although these\r\nthings come first in the narrative of the Edda, yet we are told that\r\n\"_before these_\" things, to wit, the cold winters, there occurred the\r\nwickedness of the world, and the wolves and the serpent made their\r\nappearance. So that the events transpired in the order in which I\r\nhave given them.\r\n\r\n     \"First there is a winter called the Fimbul winter,\"\r\n\r\n     \"The mighty, the great, the iron winter,\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"'_When snow drives from. all quarters_, the frosts are so severe,\r\nthe winds so keen, there is no joy in the sun. _There are three such\r\nwinters in succession, without any intervening summer_.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the Glacial period which followed the Drift. Three years\r\nof incessant wind, and snow, and intense cold.\r\n\r\nThe Elder Edda says, speaking of the Fenris-wolf:\r\n\r\n     \"It feeds on the bodies\r\n     Of men, when they die\r\n     The seats of the gods\r\n     _It stains with red blood_.\"\r\n\r\n[1. \"Norse Mythology,\" p. 444.]\r\n\r\n{p. 149}\r\n\r\nThis probably refers to the iron-stained red clay cast down by the\r\nComet over a large part of the earth; the \"seats of the gods\" means\r\nthe home of the god-like race, which was doubtless covered, like\r\nEurope and America, with red clay; the waters which ran from it must\r\nhave been the color of blood.\r\n\r\n     \"_The Sunshine blackens_\r\n     In the summers thereafter,\r\n     And the weather grows bad.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Younger Edda (p. 57) we are given a still more precise\r\ndescription of the Ice age:\r\n\r\n\"Replied Har, explaining, that as soon as the streams, that are\r\ncalled Elivogs\" (the rivers from under ice), \"had came so far that\r\nthe venomous yeast\" (the clay?) \"which flowed with them hardened, as\r\ndoes dross that runs from the fire, then it turned\" (as) \"into ice.\r\nAnd when this ice stopped and flowed no more, then gathered over it\r\nthe drizzling rain that arose from the venom\" (the clay), \"and froze\r\ninto rime\" (ice), \"_and one layer of ice was laid upon another clear\r\ninto the Ginungagap_.\"\r\n\r\nGinungagap, we are told,[1] was the name applied in the eleventh\r\ncentury by the Northmen to the ocean between Greenland and Vinland,\r\nor America. It doubtless meant originally the whole of the Atlantic\r\nOcean. The clay, when it first fell, was probably full of chemical\r\nelements, which rendered it, and the waters which filtered through\r\nit, unfit for human use; clay waters are, to this day, the worst in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\"Then said Jafnhar: 'All that part of Ginungagap that turns to the\r\nnorth' (the north Atlantic) 'was filled with thick and heavy ice and\r\nrime, and everywhere within were drizzling rains and gusts. But the\r\nsouth part of Ginungagap was lighted up by the glowing sparks that\r\nflew out of Muspelheim.'\"\r\n\r\n[1. \"Norse Mythology,\" p. 447.]\r\n\r\n{p. 150}\r\n\r\nThe ice and rime to the north represent the age of ice and snow.\r\nMuspelheim was the torrid country of the south, over which the clouds\r\ncould not yet form in consequence of the heat--Africa.\r\n\r\nBut it can not last forever. The clouds disappear; the floods find\r\ntheir way back to the ocean; nature begins to decorate once more the\r\nscarred and crushed face of the world. But where is the human race?\r\nThe \"Younger Edda\" tells us:\r\n\r\n\"During the conflagration caused by Surt's fire, a woman by the name\r\nof Lif and a man named Lifthraser lie concealed in Hodmimer's hold,\r\nor forest. The dew of the dawn serves them for food, and so great a\r\nrace shall spring from them, that their descendants shall soon spread\r\nover the whole earth.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe \"Elder Edda\" says:\r\n\r\n     \"Lif and Lifthraser\r\n     Will lie hid\r\n     In Hodmimer's-holt;\r\n     The morning dew\r\n     They have for food.\r\n     From them are the races descended.\"\r\n\r\nHolt is a grove, or forest, or hold; it was probably a cave. We shall\r\nsee that nearly all the legends refer to the caves in which mankind\r\nescaped from destruction.\r\n\r\nThis statement,\r\n\r\n\"From them are the races descended,\"\r\n\r\nshows that this is not prophecy, but history; it refers to the past,\r\nnot to the future; it describes not a Day of Judgment to come, but\r\none that has already fallen on the human family.\r\n\r\nTwo others, of the godlike race, also escaped in some\r\n\r\n[1. \"Norse Mythology\" p. 429.]\r\n\r\n{p. 151}\r\n\r\nway not indicated; Vidar and Vale are their names. They, too, had\r\nprobably taken refuge in some cavern.\r\n\r\n\"Neither the sea nor Surt's fire had harmed them, and they dwell on\r\nthe plains of Ida, where Asgard _was before_. Thither come also the\r\nsons of Thor, Mode, and Magne, and they have Mjolner. _Then come\r\nBalder and Hoder from Hel_.\r\n\r\nMode and Magne are children of Thor; they belong to the godlike race.\r\nThey, too, have escaped. Mjolner is Thor's hammer. Balder is the Sun;\r\nhe has returned from the abode of death, to which the comet consigned\r\nhim. Hoder is the Night.\r\n\r\nAll this means that the fragments and remnants of humanity reassemble\r\non the plain of Ida--the plain of Vigrid--where the battle was\r\nfought. They possess the works of the old civilization, represented\r\nby Thor's hammer; and the day and night once more return after the\r\nlong midnight blackness.\r\n\r\nAnd the Vala looks again upon a renewed and rejuvenated world:\r\n\r\n     \"She sees arise\r\n     The second time.\r\n     From the sea, the earth,\r\n     _Completely green_.\r\n     The cascades fall,\r\n     The eagle soars,\r\n     From lofty mounts\r\n     Pursues its prey.\"\r\n\r\nIt is once more the glorious, the sun-lighted world the world of\r\nflashing seas, dancing streams, and green leaves; with the eagle,\r\nhigh above it all,\r\n\r\n     \"Batting the sunny ceiling of the globe\r\n     With his dark wings;\"\r\n\r\nwhile\r\n\r\n     \"The wild cataracts leap in glory.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 152}\r\n\r\nWhat history, what poetry, what beauty, what inestimable pictures of\r\nan infinite past have lain hidden away in these Sagas--the despised\r\nheritage of all the blue-eyed, light-haired races of the world!\r\n\r\nRome and Greece can not parallel this marvelous story:\r\n\r\n     The gods convene\r\n     On Ida's plains,\r\n     And talk of the powerful\r\n     Midgard-serpent;\r\n     They call to mind\r\n     The Fenris-wolf\r\n     And the ancient runes\r\n     Of the mighty Odin.\"\r\n\r\nWhat else can mankind think of, or dream of, or talk of for the next\r\nthousand years but this awful, this unparalleled calamity through\r\nwhich the race has passed?\r\n\r\nA long-subsequent but most ancient and cultivated people, whose\r\nmemory has, for us, almost faded from the earth, will thereafter\r\nembalm the great drama in legends, myths, prayers, poems, and sagas;\r\nfragments of which are found to-day dispersed through all literatures\r\nin all lands; some of them, as we shall see, having found their way\r\neven into the very Bible revered alike of Jew and Christian:\r\n\r\nThe Edda continues,\r\n\r\n     \"Then again\r\n     The wonderful Golden tablets\r\n     Are found in the grass\r\n     In time's morning,\r\n     The leader of the gods\r\n     And Odin's race\r\n     Possessed them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what a find was that! This poor remnant of humanity discovers\r\n\"the golden tablets\" of the former\r\n\r\n{p. 153}\r\n\r\ncivilization. Doubtless, the inscribed tablets, by which the art of\r\nwriting survived to the race; for what would tablets be without\r\ninscriptions? For they talk of \"the ancient runes of mighty Odin,\"\r\nthat is, of the runic letters, the alphabetical writing. And we shall\r\nsee hereafter that this view is confirmed from other sources.\r\n\r\nThere follows a happy age:\r\n\r\n     \"The fields unsown\r\n     Yield their growth;\r\n     All ills cease.\r\n     Balder comes.\r\n     Hoder and Balder,\r\n     Those heavenly gods,\r\n     Dwell together in Odin's halls.\"\r\n\r\nThe great catastrophe is past. Man is saved, The world is once more\r\nfair. The sun shines again in heaven. Night and day follow each other\r\nin endless revolution around the happy globe. Ragnarok is past.\r\n\r\n{p. 154}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                     THE CONFLAGRATION OF PHAËTON\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to the mythology of the Latins, as preserved in the\r\npages of Ovid, one of the greatest of the poets of ancient Rome.[1]\r\n\r\nHere we have the burning of the world involved in the myth of\r\nPhaëton, son of Ph&oelig;bus--Apollo--the Sun--who drives the chariot\r\nof his father; he can not control the horses of the Sun, they run\r\naway with him; they come so near the earth as to set it on fire, and\r\nPhaëton is at last killed by Jove, as he killed Typhon in the Greek\r\nlegends, to save heaven and earth from complete and common ruin.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the conflagration as treated by a civilized\r\nmind, explained by a myth, and decorated with the flowers and foliage\r\nof poetry.\r\n\r\nWe shall see many things in the narrative of Ovid which strikingly\r\nconfirm our theory.\r\n\r\nPhaëton, to prove that he is really the son of Ph&oelig;bus, the Sun,\r\ndemands of his parent the right to drive his chariot for one day. The\r\nsun-god reluctantly consents, not without many pleadings that the\r\ninfatuated and rash boy would give up his inconsiderate ambition.\r\nPhaëton persists. The old man says:\r\n\r\n\"Even the ruler of vast Olympus, who hurls the ruthless bolts with\r\nhis terrific right hand, can not guide\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Metamorphoses,\" book xi, fable 1.]\r\n\r\n{p. 155}\r\n\r\nthis chariot; and yet, what have we greater than Jupiter? The first\r\npart of the road is steep, and such as the horses, though fresh in\r\nthe morning, can hardly climb. In the middle of the heaven it is high\r\naloft, whence it is often a source of fear, even to myself, to look\r\ndown upon the sea and the earth, and my breast trembles with fearful\r\napprehensions. The last stage is a steep descent, and requires a sure\r\ncommand of the horses. . . . Besides, the heavens are carried round\r\nwith a constant rotation, and carrying with them the lofty stars, and\r\nwhirl them with rapid revolution. Against this I have to contend; and\r\nthat force which overcomes all other things does not overcome me, and\r\n_I am carried in a contrary direction to the rapid world_.\"\r\n\r\nHere we seem to have a glimpse of some higher and older learning,\r\nmixed with the astronomical errors of the day: Ovid supposes the\r\nrapid world to move, revolve, one way, while the sun appears to move\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nBut Phaëton insists on undertaking the dread task. The doors of\r\nAurora are opened, \"her halls filled with roses\"; the stars\r\ndisappear; the Hours yoke the horses, \"filled with the _juice of\r\nambrosia_,\" the father anoints the face of his son with a hallowed\r\ndrug that he may the better endure the great heat; the reins are\r\nhanded him, and the fatal race begins. Ph&oelig;bus has advised him\r\nnot to drive too high, or \"thou wilt set on fire the signs of the\r\nheavens\"--the constellations;--nor too low, or he will consume the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\"In the mean time the swift Pyroeis, and Eoüs and Æthon, the horses\r\nof the sun, and Phlegon, the fourth, fill the air with neighings,\r\nsending forth flames, and beat the barriers with their feet. . . .\r\nThey take the road . . . they cleave the resisting clouds, and,\r\nraised aloft by their wings, they pass by the east winds that had\r\narisen from the same parts. But the weight\" (of Phaëton) \"was light,\r\nand such as the horses of the sun could not feel; and the yoke was\r\ndeficient of its wonted weight. . . . Soon as\r\n\r\n{p. 156}\r\n\r\nthe steeds had perceived this they rush on and leave the beaten\r\ntrack, and run not in the order in which they did before. He himself\r\nbecomes alarmed, and knows not which way to turn the reins intrusted\r\nto him; nor does he know where the way is, nor, if he did know, could\r\nhe control them. Then, for the first time, did the cold Triones grow\r\nwarm with sunbeams, and attempt, in vain, to be dipped in the sea\r\nthat was forbidden to them. And the Serpent, which is situate next to\r\nthe icy pole, being before torpid with cold, and formidable to no\r\none, grew warm, and regained new rage for the heat. And they say that\r\nthou, Boötes, scoured off in a mighty bustle, although thou wert but\r\nslow, and thy cart hindered thee. But when from the height of the\r\nskies the unhappy Phaëton looked down upon the earth lying far, very\r\nfar beneath, he grew pale, and his knees shook with a sudden terror;\r\nand, in a light so great, darkness overspread his eyes. And now he\r\ncould wish that he had never touched the horses of his father; and\r\nnow he is sorry that he knew his descent, and prevailed in his\r\nrequest; now desiring to be called the son of Merops.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can he do? . . . He is stupefied; he neither lets go the reins,\r\nnor is able to control them. In his fright, too, he sees strange\r\nobjects scattered everywhere in various parts of the heavens, and the\r\nforms of huge wild beasts. There is a spot where the Scorpion bends\r\nhis arms into two curves, and, with his tail and claws bending on\r\neither side, he extends his limbs through the space of two signs of\r\nthe zodiac. As soon as the youth beheld him, wet with the sweat of\r\nblack venom, and threatening wounds with the barbed point of his\r\ntail, bereft of sense he let go the reins in a chill of horror.\"\r\n\r\nCompare the course which Ovid tells us Phaëton pursued through the\r\nconstellations, past the Great Serpent and Boötes, and close to the\r\nvenomous Scorpion, with the orbit of Donati's comet in 1858, as given\r\nin Schellen's great work.[1]\r\n\r\n[1. \"Spectrum Analysis,\" p. 391.]\r\n\r\n{p. 157}\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                       COURSE OF DONATI'S COMET\r\n\r\nThe path described by Ovid shows that the comet came from the north\r\npart of the heavens; and this agrees with what we know of the Drift;\r\nthe markings indicate that it came from the north.\r\n\r\nThe horses now range at large; \"they go through\r\n\r\n{p. 158}\r\n\r\nthe air of an unknown region; . . . they rush on the stars fixed in\r\nthe sky\"; they approach the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The moon, too, wonders that her brother's horses run _lower than her\r\nown_, and the scorched clouds send forth smoke, As each region is\r\nmost elevated it is _caught by the flames_, and cleft, it makes _vast\r\nchasms, its moisture being carried away_. The grass grows pale; the\r\ntrees, with their foliage, are _burned up_, and the dry, standing\r\ncorn affords fuel for its own destruction. But I am complaining of\r\ntrifling ills. _Great cities perish_, together with their\r\nfortifications, and the flames _turn whole nations into ashes_;\r\nwoods, together with mountains, are on fire. Athos burns, and the\r\nCilician Taurus, and Tmolus, and &OElig;ta, and Ida, now dry but once\r\nmost famed for its springs, and Helicon, the resort of the virgin\r\nMuses, and Hæmus, not yet called &OElig;agrian. _Ætna burns intensely\r\nwith redoubled flames_, and Parnassus, with its two summits, and\r\nEryx, and Cynthus, and Orthrys, and Rhodope, at length to be\r\ndespoiled of its snows, and Mimas, and Dindyma, and Mycale, and\r\nCithæron, created for the sacred rites. Nor does its cold avail even\r\nScythia; Caucasus is on fire, and Ossa with Pindus, and Olympus,\r\ngreater than them both, and the lofty Alps, and the cloud-bearing\r\nApennines.\r\n\r\n\"Then, indeed, Phaëton _beholds the world see on fire on all sides_,\r\nand he can not endure heat so great, and he inhales with his mouth\r\nscorching air, as though from a deep furnace, and perceives his own\r\nchariot to be on fire. And neither is he able now to bear the ashes\r\nand _the emitted embers_; and on every side he is involved in a\r\n_heated smoke_. Covered with _a pitchy darkness_, he knows not\r\nwhither he is going, nor where he is, and is hurried away at the\r\npleasure of the winged steeds. They believe that it was then that the\r\nnations of _the Æthiopians contracted their black hue_, the blood\r\nbeing attracted. into the surface of the body. Then was Libya\"\r\n(Sahara?) \"made dry by the heat, the moisture being carried off; then\r\nwith disheveled hair the Nymphs _lamented the springs and the lakes_.\r\nB&oelig;otia bewails Dirce, Argos Amymone, and Ephyre the waters of\r\nPirene. Nor do rivers that\r\n\r\n{p. 159}\r\n\r\nhave banks distant remain secure. Tanais smokes in the midst of its\r\nwaters, and the aged Peneus and Teuthrantian Caïcus and rapid\r\nIsmenus. . . . The Babylonian Euphrates, too, was on fire, Orontes\r\nwas in flames, and the swift Thermodon and Ganges and Phasis and\r\nIster. Alpheus _boils_; the banks of Spercheus burn; and the gold\r\nwhich Tagus carries with its stream melts in the flames. The\r\nriver-birds, too, which made famous the Mæonian banks with song, grew\r\nhot in the middle of Caÿster. The Nile, affrighted, fled to the\r\nremotest parts of the earth and concealed his head, which still lies\r\nhid; his seven last mouths are empty, seven channels without any\r\nstreams. The same fate dries up the Ismarian rivers, Hebeus together\r\nwith Strymon, and the Hesperian streams, the Rhine, the Rhone, and\r\nthe Po, and the Tiber, to which was promised the sovereignty of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, according to these Roman traditions here poetized,\r\nthe heat dried up the rivers of Europe, Asia, and Africa; in short,\r\nof all the known world.\r\n\r\nOvid continues:\r\n\r\n\"All the ground bursts asunder, and through the chinks the light\r\npenetrates into Tartarus, and startles the infernal king with his\r\nspouse.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen that during the Drift age the great clefts in the earth,\r\nthe fiords of the north of Europe and America, occurred, and we shall\r\nsee hereafter that, according to a Central American legend, the red\r\nrocks boiled up through the earth at this time.\r\n\r\n\"The _ocean, too, is contracted_,\" says Ovid, \"and that which lately\r\nwas sea is a surface of parched sand, and the mountains which the\r\ndeep sea has covered, start up and increase the number of the\r\nscattered Cyclades\" (a cluster of islands in the Ægean Sea,\r\nsurrounding Delos as though with a circle, whence their name); \"the\r\nfishes sink to the bottom, and the crooked dolphins do not care to\r\nraise themselves on the surface into the air as usual. The bodies of\r\nsea-calves float lifeless on their backs on\r\n\r\n{p. 160}\r\n\r\nthe top of the water. The story, too, is that even Nereus himself and\r\nDoris and their daughters _lay hid in the heated caverns_.\"\r\n\r\nAll this could scarcely have been imagined, and yet it agrees\r\nprecisely with what we can not but believe to have been the facts.\r\nHere we have an explanation of how that vast body of vapor which\r\nafterward constituted great snow-banks and ice-sheets and\r\nriver-torrents rose into the air. Science tells us that to make a\r\nworld-wrapping ice-sheet two miles thick, all the waters of the ocean\r\nmust have been evaporated;[1] to make one a mile thick would take one\r\nhalf the waters of the globe; and here we find this Roman poet, who\r\nis repeating the legends of his race, and who knew nothing about a\r\nDrift age or an Ice age, telling us that the water _boiled_ in the\r\nstreams; that the bottom of the Mediterranean lay exposed, a bed of\r\ndry sand; that the fish floated dead on the surface, or fled away to\r\nthe great depths of the ocean; and that even the sea-gods \"hid in the\r\nheated caverns.\"\r\n\r\nOvid continues:\r\n\r\n\"Three times had Neptune ventured with stern countenance to thrust\r\nhis arms out of the water; three times he was unable to endure the\r\nscorching heat of the air.\"\r\n\r\nThis is no doubt a reminiscence of those human beings who sought\r\nsafety in the water, retreating downward into the deep as the heat\r\nreduced its level, occasionally lifting up their heads to breathe the\r\ntorrid and tainted air.\r\n\r\n\"However, the genial Earth, _as she was surrounded by the sea_, amid\r\nthe waters of the main\" (the ocean); \"the springs dried up on every\r\nside which had hidden themselves in the bowels of their cavernous\r\nparent, burnt up, lifted up her all-productive face as far as her\r\nneck, and\r\n\r\n[1. \"Science and Genesis,\" p. 125.]\r\n\r\n{p. 161}\r\n\r\nplaced her hand to her forehead, and, shaking all things with a _vast\r\ntrembling_, she _sank down a little and retired below the spot where\r\nshe is wont_ to be.\"\r\n\r\nHere we are reminded of the bridge Bifrost, spoken of in the last\r\nchapter, which, as I have shown, was probably a prolongation of land\r\nreaching from Atlantis to Europe, and which the Norse legends tell us\r\nsank down under the feet of the forces of Muspelheim, in the day of\r\nRagnarok:\r\n\r\n\"And thus she spoke with a parched voice: 'O sovereign of the gods,\r\nif thou approvest of this, if I have deserved it, why do thy\r\nlightnings linger? Let me, if doomed to perish by the force of fire,\r\nperish by thy flames; and alleviate my misfortune by being the author\r\nof it. With difficulty, indeed, do I open my mouth for these very\r\nwords. Behold my scorched hair, and _such a quantity of ashes over my\r\neyes_' (the Drift-deposits), '_so much, too, over my features_. And\r\ndost thou give this as my recompense? This as the reward of my\r\n_fertility_ and my duty, in that I _endure wounds from the crooked\r\nplow and harrows_, and am harassed all the year through, in that I\r\nsupply green leaves for the cattle, and corn, a wholesome food, for\r\nmankind, and frankincense for yourselves.\r\n\r\n\"'But still, suppose I am deserving of destruction, why have the\r\nwaves deserved this? Why has thy brother' (Neptune) 'deserved it? Why\r\ndo the seas delivered to him by lot _decrease_, and why do they\r\n_recede still farther from the sky?_ But if regard neither for thy\r\nbrother nor myself influences thee, still have consideration for thy\r\nown skies; look around on either side, see how each pole is\r\n_smoking_; if the fire shall injure them, _thy palace will fall in\r\nruins_. See! Atlas himself is struggling, and hardly can he bear the\r\nglowing heavens on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"'If the sea, if the earth, if the palace of heaven, perish, we are\r\nthen jumbled into the old chaos again. Save it from the flames, if\r\naught still survives, and provide for the preservation of the\r\nuniverse.'\r\n\r\n{p. 162}\r\n\r\n\"Thus spoke the Earth; nor, indeed, could she any longer endure the\r\nvapor, nor say more, and she withdrew her face within herself, _and\r\nthe caverns neighboring to the shades below_.\r\n\r\n\"But the omnipotent father, having called the gods above to witness,\r\nand him, too, who had given the chariot to Phaëton, that unless he\r\ngives assistance all things will perish in direful ruin, mounts aloft\r\nto the highest eminence, from which he is wont to spread the clouds\r\nover the spacious earth; and from which he moves his thunders, and\r\nburls the brandished lightnings. _But then he had neither clouds that\r\nhe could draw over the earth, nor showers that he could pour down\r\nfrom the sky_.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, so long as the great meteor shone in the air, and for\r\nsome time after, the heat was too intense to permit the formation of\r\neither clouds or rain; these could only come with coolness and\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\nHe thundered aloud, and darted the poised lightning from his right\r\near, against the charioteer, and at the same moment deprived him both\r\nof life and his seat, and by his ruthless fires restrained the\r\nflames. The horses are affrighted, and, making a bound in the\r\nopposite direction, they shake the yoke from their necks, and\r\ndisengage themselves from the torn harness. In one place lie the\r\nreins, in another the axle-tree wrenched from the pole, in another\r\npart are the spokes of the broken wheels, and _the fragments of the\r\nchariot torn in pieces are scattered far and wide_. But Phaëton, the\r\nflames consuming his _yellow_ hair, _is hurled headlong_, and is\r\nborne in _a long track through the air_, as sometimes _a star is seen\r\nto fall from the serene sky_, although it really has not fallen. Him\r\nthe great Eridanus receives in a part of the world far distant from\r\nhis country, and bathes his foaming face. The _Hesperian Naiads_\r\ncommit his body, smoking from the _three-forked_ flames, to the tomb,\r\nand inscribe these verses on the stone: 'Here is Phaëton buried, the\r\ndriver of his father's chariot, which, if he did not manage, still he\r\nmiscarried in a great attempt.'\r\n\r\n\"But his wretched father\" (the Sun) \"_had hidden his_\r\n\r\n{p. 163}\r\n\r\n_face overcast with bitter sorrow_, and, if only we can believe it,\r\nthey say that _one day passed without the sun_. The flames\" (of the\r\nfires on the earth) \"afforded light, and there was some advantage in\r\nthat disaster.\"\r\n\r\nAs there was no daily return of the sun to mark the time, that one\r\nday of darkness was probably of long duration; it may have endured\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\nThen follows Ovid's description of the mourning of Clymene and the\r\ndaughters of the Sun and the Naiads for the dead Phaëton. Cycnus,\r\nking of Liguria, grieves for Phaëton until he is transformed into a\r\nswan; reminding one of the Central American legend, (which I shall\r\ngive hereafter,) which states that in that day all men were turned\r\ninto _goslings_ or _geese_, a reminiscence, perhaps, of those who\r\nsaved themselves from the fire by taking refuge in the waters of the\r\nseas:\r\n\r\n\"Cycnus becomes a new bird; but he trusts himself not to the heavens\r\nor the air, as being mindful of the _fire unjustly sent from thence_.\r\nHe _frequents the pools and the wide lakes_, and, abhorring fire, he\r\nchooses the streams, the very contrary of flames.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, the father of Phaëton\" (the Sun), \"in _squalid garb_ and\r\ndestitute of his comeliness, _just as he is wont to be when he\r\nsuffers an eclipse of his disk_, abhors both the light, himself, and\r\nthe day; and gives his mind up to grief, and adds resentment to his\r\nsorrow.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, the poet is now describing the age of darkness,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, must have followed the conflagration, when\r\nthe condensing vapor wrapped the world in a vast cloak of cloud.\r\n\r\nThe Sun refuses to go again on his daily journey; just as we shall\r\nsee hereafter, in the American legends, he refuses to stir until\r\nthreatened or coaxed into action.\r\n\r\n{p. 164}\r\n\r\n\"All the deities,\" says Ovid, \"stand around the Sun as he says such\r\nthings, and they entreat him, with suppliant voice, _not to determine\r\nto bring darkness over the world_.\" At length they induce the enraged\r\nand bereaved father to resume his task.\r\n\r\n\"But the omnipotent father\" (Jupiter) \"surveys the vast walls of\r\nheaven, and carefully searches that no part, impaired by the violence\r\nof the fire, may fall into ruin. After he has seen them to be secure\r\nand in their own strength, he examines the earth, and the _works of\r\nman_; yet a care for his own Arcadia is more particularly his object.\r\nHe _restores, too, the springs and the rivers_, that had not yet\r\ndared to flow, _he gives grass to the earth, green leaves to the\r\ntrees_; and orders the injured forests again to be green.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of renovation has begun; the condensing moisture renews the\r\nsprings and rivers, the green mantle of verdure once more covers the\r\nearth, and from the waste places the beaten and burned trees put\r\nforth new sprouts.\r\n\r\nThe legend ends, like Ragnarok, in a beautiful picture of a\r\nregenerated world.\r\n\r\nDivest this poem of the myth of Phaëton, and we have a very faithful\r\ntradition of the conflagration of the world caused by the comet.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the trouble is a something which takes place high in the\r\nheavens; it rushes through space; it threatens the stars; it\r\ntraverses particular constellations; it is disastrous; it has yellow\r\nhair; it is associated with great heat; it sets the world on fire it\r\ndries up the seas; its remains are scattered over the earth; it\r\ncovers the earth with ashes; the sun ceases to appear; there is a\r\ntime when he is, as it were, in eclipse, darkened; after a while he\r\nreturns; verdure comes again upon the earth, the springs and rivers\r\nreappear, the world is renewed. During this catastrophe man has\r\nhidden himself, swanlike,\r\n\r\n{p. 165}\r\n\r\nin the waters; or the intelligent children of the earth betake\r\nthemselves to deep caverns for protection from the conflagration.\r\n\r\nHow completely does all this accord, in chronological order and in\r\nits details, with the Scandinavian legend; and with what reason\r\nteaches us must have been the consequences to the earth if a comet\r\nhad fallen upon it!\r\n\r\nAnd the most ancient of the ancient world, the nation that stood\r\nfarthest back in historical time, the Egyptians, believed that this\r\nlegend of Phaëton really represented the contact of the earth with a\r\ncomet.\r\n\r\nWhen Solon, the Greek lawgiver, visited Egypt, six hundred years\r\nbefore the Christian era, he talked with the priests of Sais about\r\nthe Deluge of Deucalion. I quote the following from Plato\r\n(\"Dialogues,\" xi, 517, _Timæus_):\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon, one of the priests, who was of very great age, said, 'O\r\nSolon, Solon, you Hellenes are but children, and there is never an\r\nold man who is an Hellene.' Solon, hearing this, said, 'What do you\r\nmean?' 'I mean to say,' he replied, 'that in mind you are all young;\r\nthere is no old opinion handed down among you by ancient tradition,\r\nnor any science which is hoary with age. And I will tell you the\r\nreason of this: there have been, and there will be again, many\r\ndestructions of mankind arising out of many causes. There is a story\r\nwhich even you have preserved, that once upon a time Phaëthon, the\r\nson of Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father's chariot,\r\nbecause he was not able to drive them in the path of his father,\r\nburnt up all that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a\r\nthunder-bolt. Now, this has the form of a myth, but _really signifies\r\na declination of the bodies moving around the earth and in the\r\nheavens, and a great conflagration of things upon the earth_\r\nrecurring at long intervals of time: when this happens, those who\r\nlive upon the mountains and in dry and lofty places are more liable\r\nto destruction than those who dwell by rivers or on the sea-shore.\"'\r\n\r\n{p. 166}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                  OTHER LEGENDS OF THE CONFLAGRATION.\r\n\r\nTHE first of these, and the most remarkable of all, is the legend of\r\none of the Central American nations, preserved not by tradition\r\nalone, but committed to writing at some time in the remote past.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Codex Chimalpopoca,\" one of the sacred books of the Toltecs,\r\nthe author, speaking of the destruction which took place by fire,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The third sun\" (or era) \"is called _Quia-Tonatiuh_, sun of rain,\r\nbecause there fell a _rain of fire; all which existed burned; and\r\nthere fell a rain of gravel_.\"\r\n\r\n\"They also narrate that while the sandstone, which we now see\r\n_scattered about_, and the _tetzontli_ (_amygdaloide poreuse_--trap\r\nor basaltic rocks), '_boiled with great tumult_, there also rose the\r\nrocks of vermilion color.'\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the basaltic and red trap-rocks burst through the\r\ngreat cracks made, at that time, in the surface of the disturbed\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\"Now, this was in the year _Ce Tecpatl_, One _Flint_, it was the day\r\n_Nahui-Quiahuit_l, Fourth Rain. Now, in this day, in which men were\r\nlost and destroyed _in a rain of fire_, they _were transformed into\r\ngoslings_; the _sun itself was on fire_, and everything, together\r\nwith the houses, was consumed.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1. \"The North Americans of Antiquity,\" p. 499.]\r\n\r\n{p. 167}\r\n\r\nHere we have the whole story told in little: \"Fire fell from heaven,\"\r\nthe comet; \"the sun itself was on fire\"; the comet reached to, or\r\nappeared to reach to, the sun; or its head had fallen into the sun;\r\nor the terrible object may have been mistaken for the sun on fire.\r\n\"_There was a rain of gravel_\"--the Drift fell from the comet. There\r\nis also some allusion to the sandstones scattered about; and we have\r\nanother reference to the great breaks in the earth's crust, caused\r\neither by the shock of contact with the comet, or the electrical\r\ndisturbances of the time; and we are told that the trap-rocks, and\r\nrocks of vermilion color, boiled up to the surface with great tumult.\r\nMankind was destroyed, except such as fled into the seas and lakes,\r\nand there plunged into the water, and lived like \"goslings.\"\r\n\r\nCan any one suppose that this primitive people invented all this? And\r\nif they did, how comes it that their invention agreed so exactly with\r\nthe traditions of all the rest of mankind; and with the revelations\r\nof science as to the relations between the trap rocks and the gravel,\r\nas to time at least?\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the legends of a different race, in a different stage\r\nof cultivation--the barbarian Indians of California and Nevada. It is\r\na curious and wonderful story:\r\n\r\n\"The natives in the vicinity of Lake Tahoe ascribe its origin to a\r\ngreat natural convulsion. There was a time, they say, when their\r\ntribe possessed the whole earth, and were strong numerous, and rich;\r\nbut a day came in which a people rose up stronger than they, and\r\ndefeated and enslaved them. Afterward the Great Spirit sent an\r\nimmense wave across the continent from the sea, and this wave\r\ningulfed both the oppressors and the oppressed, all but a very small\r\nremnant. Then the task-masters made the remaining people raise up a\r\ngreat temple, so that\r\n\r\n{p. 168}\r\n\r\nthey, of the ruling caste, should have a refuge in case of another\r\nflood, and on the top of this temple the masters worshiped a column\r\nof perpetual fire.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be natural to suppose that this was the great deluge to\r\nwhich all the legends of mankind refer, and which I have supposed,\r\nelsewhere, to refer to the destruction of \"Atlantis\"; but it must be\r\nremembered that both east and west of the Atlantic the traditions of\r\nmankind refer to several deluges--to a series of\r\ncatastrophes--occurring at times far apart. It may be that the legend\r\nof the Tower of Babel refers to an event far anterior in time even to\r\nthe deluge of Noah or Deucalion; or it may be, as often happens, that\r\nthe chronology of this legend has been inverted.\r\n\r\nThe Tahoe legend continues:\r\n\r\n\"Half a moon had not elapsed, however, before the earth was again\r\ntroubled, this time with strong convulsions and thunderings, upon\r\nwhich the masters took refuge in their great tower, closing the\r\npeople out. The poor slaves fled to the Humboldt River, and, getting\r\ninto canoes, paddled for life _from the awful sight behind them_; for\r\nthe land was tossing like a troubled sea, and casting up fire, smoke,\r\nand ashes. _The flames went up to the very heavens, and melted many\r\nstars_, SO THAT THEY RAINED DOWN IN MOLTEN METAL UPON THE EARTH,\r\nforming the ore\" [gold?] \"that white men seek. The Sierra was mounded\r\nup from the bosom of the earth; while the place where the great fort\r\nstood sank, leaving only the dome on the top exposed above the waters\r\nof Lake Tahoe. The inmates of the temple-tower clung to this dome to\r\nsave themselves from drowning; but the Great Spirit walked upon the\r\nwaters in his wrath, and took the oppressors one by one, _like\r\npebbles_, and threw them far into the recesses of a great cavern on\r\nthe east side of the lake, called to this day the Spirit Lodge, where\r\nthe waters shut them in. There must they remain till the last great\r\nvolcanic burning, which is to overturn the\r\n\r\n{p. 169}\r\n\r\nwhole earth, is to again set them free. In the depths of\r\ncavern-prison they may still be heard, wailing and their cave,\r\nmoaning, when the snows melt and the waters swell in the lake.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere we have the usual mingling of fact and myth. The legend\r\ndescribes accurately, no doubt, the awful appearance of the tossing\r\nearth and the falling fire and _débris_; the people flying to rivers\r\nand taking shelter in the caves) and some of them closed up in the\r\ncaves for ever.\r\n\r\nThe legend, as is usual, accommodates itself to the geography and\r\ntopography of the country in which the narrators live.\r\n\r\nIn the Aztec creation-myths, as preserved by the Fray Andres de\r\nOlmos, and taken down by him from the lips of those who narrated the\r\nAztec traditions to him, we have an account of the destruction of\r\nmankind by the sun, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\nThe sun had risen indeed, and _with the glory of the cruel fire about\r\nhim_, that not even the eyes of the gods could endure; but he moved\r\nnot. There he lay on the horizon; and when the deities sent Tlotli,\r\ntheir messenger, to him, with orders that he should go on upon his\r\nway, his ominous answer was that he would never leave that place\r\n_till he had destroyed and put an end to them all_. Then a great fear\r\nfell upon some, while others were moved only to anger; and among the\r\nothers was one Citli, who immediately strung his bow and advanced\r\nagainst the glittering enemy. By quickly lowering his head the sun\r\navoided the first arrow shot at him; but the second and third had\r\nattained his body in quick succession, when, filled with fury, he\r\nseized the last and launched it back upon his assailant. And the\r\nbrave Citli laid shaft to string never more, for the arrow of the sun\r\npierced his forehead. Then all was dismay in the assembly of the\r\ngods, and _despair filled their hearts_, for they saw that\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 89.]\r\n\r\n170 THE LEGENDS.\r\n\r\nthey could not prevail against the shining one; and they agreed to\r\ndie, and to cut themselves open through the breast. . Xololt was\r\nappointed minister, and he killed his companions one by one, and last\r\nof all he slew himself also. . . . Immediately after the death of the\r\ngods, the sun began his motion in the heavens; and a man called\r\nTecuzistecatl, or Tezcociztecatl, who, when Nanahuatzin leaped into\r\nthe fire, had retired into a cave, now emerged from his concealment\r\nas the moon. Others say that instead of going into a cave, this\r\nTecuzistecatl had leaped into the fire after Nanahuatzin, but that\r\nthe heat of the fire being somewhat abated he had come out less\r\nbrilliant than the sun. Still another variation is that the sun and\r\nmoon came out equally bright, but this not seeming good to the gods,\r\none of them took a rabbit by the heels and slung it into the face of\r\nthe moon, dimming its luster with a blotch whose mark may be seen to\r\nthis day.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere we have the same Titanic battle between the gods, the godlike\r\nmen of old--\"the old ones\"--and the Comet, which appears in the Norse\r\nlegends, when Odin, Thor, Prey, Tyr, and Heimdal boldly march out to\r\nencounter the Comet and fall dead, like Citli, before the weapons or\r\nthe poisonous breath of the monster. In the same way we see in Hesiod\r\nthe great Jove, rising high on Olympus and smiting Typhaon with his\r\nlightnings. And we shall see this idea of a conflict between the gods\r\nand the great demon occurring all through the legends. And it may be\r\nthat the three arrows of this American story represent the three\r\ncomets spoken of in Hesiod, and the Fenris-wolf, Midgard-serpent, and\r\nSurt or Garm of the Goths: the first arrow did not strike the sun;\r\nthe second and the third \"attained its body,\" and then the enraged\r\nsun launched the last arrow back at Citli, at the earth; and\r\nthereupon despair filled the people, and they prepared to die.\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 62.]\r\n\r\n{p. 171}\r\n\r\nThe Avesta, the sacred book of the ancient Persians, written in the\r\nZend dialect, tells the same story. I have already given one version\r\nof it:\r\n\r\nAhura Mazda is the good god, the kind creator of life and growth; he\r\nsent the sun, the fertilizing rain. He created for the ancestors of\r\nthe Persians a beautiful land, a paradise, a warm and fertile\r\ncountry. But Ahriman, the genius of evil, created Azhidahaka, \"_the\r\nbiting snake of winter_.\" \"He had triple jaws, three heads, six eyes,\r\nthe strength of a thousand beings.\" He brings ruin and winter on the\r\nfair land. Then comes a mighty hero, Thraetaona, who kills the snake\r\nand rescues the land.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the Persian legends we have Feridun, the hero of the Shah-Nameh.\r\nThere is a serpent-king called Zohak, who has committed dreadful\r\ncrimes, assisted by a demon called Iblis. As his reward, Iblis asked\r\npermission to kiss the king's shoulder, which was granted. Then from\r\nthe shoulder sprang two dreadful serpents. Iblis told him that these\r\nmust be fed every day with the brains of two children. So the human\r\nrace was gradually being exterminated. Then Feridun, beautiful and\r\nstrong, rose up and killed the serpent-king Zohak, and delivered his\r\ncountry. Zohak is the same as Azhidahaka in the Avesta--\"the biting\r\nsnake of winter.\"[2] He is Python; he is Typhaon; he is the\r\nFenris-wolf; he is the Midgard-serpent.\r\n\r\nThe Persian fire-worship is based on the primeval recognition of the\r\nvalue of light and fire, growing out of this Age of Darkness and\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nIn the legends of the Hindoos we read of the fight between Rama, the\r\nsun-god (_Ra_ was the Egyptian god of the sun), and Ravana, a giant\r\nwho, accompanied by the\r\n\r\n[1. Poor, \"Sanskrit Literature,\" p. 144.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 158.]\r\n\r\n{p. 172}\r\n\r\nRakshasas, or demons, made terrible times in the ancient land where\r\nthe ancestors of the Hindoos dwelt at that period. He carries away\r\nthe wife of Rama, Sita; her name signifies \"a furrow,\" and seems to\r\nrefer to agriculture, and an agricultural race inhabiting the\r\nfurrowed earth. He bears her struggling through the air. Rama and his\r\nallies pursue him. The monkey-god, Hanuman, helps Rama; a bridge of\r\nstone, sixty miles long, is built across the deep ocean to the Island\r\nof Lanka, where the great battle is fought: \"_The stones which crop\r\nout through Southern India are said to have been dropped by the\r\nmonkey builders!_\" The army crosses on the bridge, as the forces of\r\nMuspelheim, in the Norse legends, marched over the bridge \"Bifrost.\"\r\n\r\nThe battle is a terrible one. Ravana has ten heads, and as fast as\r\nRama cuts off one another grows in its place. Finally, Rama, like\r\nApollo, fires the terrible arrow of Brahma, the creator, and the\r\nmonster falls dead.\r\n\r\n\"Gods and demons are watching the contest from the sky, and flowers\r\nfall down in showers on the victorious hero.\"\r\n\r\nThe body of Ravana is _consumed by fire_. Sita, the furrowed earth,\r\ngoes through _the ordeal of fire_, and comes out of it purified and\r\nredeemed from all taint of the monster Ravana; and Rama, the sun, and\r\nSita, the earth, are separated _for fourteen years_; Sita _is hid in\r\nthe dark jungle_, and then they are married again, and live happily\r\ntogether ever after.\r\n\r\nHere we have the battle in the air between the sun and the demon: the\r\nearth is taken possession of by the demon; the demon is finally\r\nconsumed by fire, and perishes; the earth goes through an ordeal of\r\nfire, a conflagration; and for fourteen years the earth and sun do\r\nnot see each other; the earth is hid in a dark jungle; but\r\n\r\n{p. 173}\r\n\r\neventually the sun returns, and the loving couple are again married,\r\nand live happily for ever after.\r\n\r\nThe Phoibos Apollo of the Greek legends was, Byron tells us--\r\n\r\n     The lord of the unerring bow,\r\n     The god of life and poetry and light,\r\n     The sun in human limbs arrayed, and brow\r\n     All radiant from his triumph in the fight.\r\n     The shaft had just been shot, the arrow bright\r\n     With an immortal's vengeance; in his eye\r\n     And nostril beautiful disdain, and might,\r\n     And majesty flash their full lightnings by,\r\n     Developing in that one glance the deity.\"\r\n\r\nThis fight, so magnificently described, was the sun-god's battle with\r\nPython, the destroyer, the serpent, the dragon, the Comet. What was\r\nPython doing? He was \"stealing the springs and fountains.\" That is to\r\nsay, the great heat was drying up the water-courses of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The arrow bright with an immortal's vengeance,\" was the shaft with\r\nwhich Apollo broke the fiend to pieces and tumbled him down to the\r\nearth, and saved the springs and the clouds and the perishing ocean.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to America, the legends tell us of the same great battle\r\nbetween good and evil, between light and darkness.\r\n\r\nManibozho, or the Great Hare Nana, is, in the Algonquin legends, the\r\nWhite One, the light, the sun. \"His foe was the glittering prince of\r\nserpents\"-the Comet.[1]\r\n\r\nAmong the Iroquois, according to the Jesuit missionary, Father\r\nBrebeuf, who resided among the Hurons in 1626, there was a legend of\r\ntwo brothers, Ioskeba and Tawiscara, which mean, in the Oneida\r\ndialect, the _White One_, the light, the sun, and the _Dark One_, the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths,\" p. 182.]\r\n\r\n{p. 174}\r\n\r\nThey were twins, born of a virgin mother, who died in giving them\r\nlife. Their grandmother was the moon (the _water_ deity), called\r\n_At-aeusic_, a word which signifies \"she bathes herself,\" derived\r\nfrom the word for _water_.\r\n\r\n\"The brothers quarreled, and finally came to blows, the former using\r\nthe horns of a stag, the latter the wild rose. He of the weaker\r\nweapon was very naturally discomfited and sorely wounded. Fleeing for\r\nlife, the blood gushed from him at every step, and as it fell _turned\r\ninto flint-stones_. The victor returned to his grandmother in the\r\n_far east_, and established his lodge on _the borders of the great\r\nocean_, whence the sun comes. In time he became _the father of\r\nmankind_, and special guardian of the Iroquois. The earth was at\r\nfirst arid and sterile, but he destroyed the gigantic frog which had\r\nswallowed all the waters, and guided the torrents into smooth streams\r\nand lakes. The woods he stocked with game; and, having learned from\r\nthe great tortoise who supports the world how to make fire, taught\r\nhis children, the Indians, this indispensable art. . . . Sometimes\r\nthey spoke of him as the sun, but this is only figuratively.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere we have the light and darkness, the sun and the night, battling\r\nwith each other; the sun fights with a younger brother, another\r\nluminary, the comet; the comet is broken up; it flies for life, the\r\nred blood (the red clay) streaming from it, and _flint-stones_\r\nappearing on the earth wherever the blood (the clay) falls. The\r\nvictorious sun re-establishes himself in the east. And then the myth\r\nof the sun merges into the legends concerning a great people, who\r\nwere the fathers of mankind who dwelt \"in the east,\" on the borders\r\nof the great eastern ocean, the Atlantic. \"The earth was at first\r\narid and sterile,\" covered with _débris_ and stones; but the\r\nreturning sun, the White One, destroys the gigantic frog, emblem of\r\ncold and water, the great snows and ice-deposits; this\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 184.]\r\n\r\n{p. 175}\r\n\r\nfrog had \"swallowed all the waters,\" that is to say, the falling\r\nrains had been congealed in these great snow-banks and glaciers; the\r\nsun melts them, and kills the frog; the waters pour forth in deluging\r\nfloods; Manibozho \"guides the torrents into smooth streams and\r\nlakes\"; the woods return, and become once more full of animal life.\r\nThen the myth again mixes up the sun and the sun-land in the east.\r\nFrom this sun-land, represented as \"a tortoise,\" always the emblem of\r\nan island, the Iroquois derive the knowledge of \"how to make fire.\"\r\n\r\nThis coming of the monster, his attack upon and conquest of the sun,\r\nhis apparent swallowing of that orb, are all found represented on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic, on the walls of temples and in great\r\nearth-mounds, in the image of a gigantic serpent holding a globe in\r\nits mouth.\r\n\r\nThis long-trailing object in the skies was probably the origin of\r\nthat primeval serpent-worship found all over the world. And hence the\r\nassociation of the serpent in so many religions with the evil-one. In\r\nitself, the serpent should no more represent moral wrong than the\r\nlizard, the crocodile, or the frog; but the hereditary abhorrence\r\nwith which he is regarded by mankind extends to no other created\r\nthing. He is the image of the great destroyer, the wronger, the enemy.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to another legend.\r\n\r\nAn ancient authority[1] gives the following legend of the Tupi\r\nIndians of Brazil:\r\n\r\n\"Monau, without beginning or end, author of all that is, seeing the\r\ningratitude of men, and their contempt for him who had made them thus\r\njoyous, withdrew from them, and sent upon them _tata_, the divine\r\n_fire, which burned all that was on the surface of the earth_. He\r\n\r\n[1. \"Une Fête Brésilienne célébré à Rouen en 1550,\" par M. Ferdinand\r\nDenis, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n{p. 176}\r\n\r\nswept about the fire in such a way that _in places he raised\r\nmountains, and in others dug valleys_. Of all men one alone, Irin\r\nMagé, was saved, whom Monau carried into the heaven. He, seeing all\r\nthings destroyed, spoke thus to Monau: 'Wilt thou also destroy the\r\nheavens and their garniture? Alas! henceforth where will be our home?\r\nWhy should I live, since there is none other of my kind? Then Monau\r\nwas so filled with pity that he _poured a deluging rain on the earth,\r\nwhich quenched the fire_, and flowed on all sides, forming the ocean,\r\nwhich we call the _parana_, the great waters.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe prayer of Irin Magé, when he calls on God to save the garniture\r\nof the heavens, reminds one vividly of the prayer of the Earth in\r\nOvid.\r\n\r\nIt might be inferred that heaven meant in the Tupi legend the\r\nheavenly land, not the skies; this is rendered the more probable\r\nbecause we find Irin asking where should he dwell if heaven is\r\ndestroyed. This could scarcely allude to a spiritual heaven.\r\n\r\nAnd here I would note a singular coincidence: The fire that fell from\r\nheaven was the divine _tata_. In Egypt the Dame of deity was \"ta-ta,\"\r\nor \"pta-pta,\" which signified father. This became in the Hebrew\r\n\"ya-ya,\" from which we derive the root of Jah, Jehovah. And this word\r\nis found in many languages in Europe and America, and even in our\r\nown, as, \"da-da,\" \"daddy,\" father. The Tupi \"_tata_\" was fire from\r\nthe supreme father.\r\n\r\nWho can doubt the oneness of the human race, when millions of threads\r\nof tradition and language thus cross each other through it in all\r\ndirections, like the web of a mighty fabric?\r\n\r\nWe cross from one continent to another, from the torrid part of South\r\nAmerica to the frozen regions of North America, and the same legend\r\nmeets us.\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 227.]\r\n\r\n{p. 177}\r\n\r\nThe Tacullies of British Columbia believe that the earth was formed\r\nby a musk-rat, who, diving into the universal sea, brought up the\r\nland in his mouth and spit it out, until he had formed \"quite an\r\nisland, and, by degrees, the whole earth\":\r\n\r\n\"In some unexplained way, this earth became afterward peopled in\r\nevery part, and it remained, _until a fierce fire, of several days'\r\nduration, swept over it, destroying all life_, with two exceptions;\r\none man and one woman _hid themselves in a deep cave in the heart of\r\na mountain_, and from these two has the world since been\r\nrepeopled.\"[1]\r\n\r\nBrief as is this narrative, it preserves the natural sequence of\r\nevents: First, the world is made; then it becomes peopled in every\r\npart; then a fierce fire sweeps over it for several days, consuming\r\nall life, except two persons, who save themselves by hiding in a deep\r\ncave; and from these the world is repeopled. How wonderfully does all\r\nthis resemble the Scandinavian story!\r\n\r\nIt has oftentimes been urged, by the skeptical, when legends of\r\nNoah's flood were found among rude races, that they had been derived\r\nfrom Christian missionaries. But these myths can not be accounted for\r\nin this way; for the missionaries did not teach that the world was\r\nonce destroyed by fire, and that a remnant of mankind escaped by\r\ntaking refuge in a cave; although, as we shall see, such a legend\r\nreally appears in several places hidden in the leaves of the Bible\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWe leave the remote north and pass down the Pacific coast until we\r\nencounter the Ute Indians of California and Utah. This is their\r\nlegend:\r\n\r\n\"The Ute philosopher declares the sun to be a living personage, and\r\nexplains his passage across the heavens along an appointed way by\r\ngiving an account of a fierce\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 98]\r\n\r\n{p. 178}\r\n\r\npersonal conflict between Ta-vi, the sun-god, and Ta-wats, one of the\r\nsupreme gods of his mythology.\r\n\r\n\"In that, long ago, the time to which all mythology refers, the sun\r\nroamed the earth at will. _When he came too near with his fierce heat\r\nthe people were scorched, and when he hid away in his cave for a long\r\ntime, too idle to come forth, the night was long and the earth cold_.\r\nOnce upon a time Ta-wats, the hare-god, was sitting with his family\r\nby the camp-fire in the solemn woods, anxiously waiting for the\r\nreturn of Ta-vi, the wayward sun-god. Wearied with long watching, the\r\nhare-god fell asleep, and the sun-god came so near that he scorched\r\nthe naked shoulder of Ta-wats. Foreseeing the vengeance which would\r\nbe thus provoked, he fled back to his cave beneath the earth. Ta-wats\r\nawoke in great anger, and speedily determined to go and fight the\r\nsun-god. After a long journey of many adventures the hare-god came to\r\nthe brink of the earth, and there watched long and patiently, till at\r\nlast the sun-god coming out he shot an arrow at his face, but the\r\nfierce heat consumed the arrow ere it had finished its intended\r\ncourse; then another arrow was sped, but that also was consumed; and\r\nanother, and still another, till only one remained in his quiver, but\r\nthis was the magical arrow that had never failed its mark. Ta-wats,\r\nholding it in his hand, lifted the barb to his eye and baptized it in\r\na divine tear; then the arrow was sped and _struck the sun-god full\r\nin the face, and the sun was shivered into a thousand fragments,\r\nwhich fell to the earth, causing a general conflagration_. Then\r\nTa-wats, the hare-god, fled before the destruction he had wrought,\r\nand as he fled the burning earth consumed his feet, consumed his\r\nlegs, consumed his body, consumed his bands and his arms--all were\r\nconsumed but the head alone, which bowled across valleys and over\r\nmountains, fleeing destruction from the burning earth, until at last,\r\nswollen with heat, the eyes of the god burst and the tears _gushed\r\nforth in a flood which spread over the earth and extinguished the\r\nfire_. The sun-god was now conquered, and he appeared before a\r\ncouncil of the gods to await sentence. In that long council were\r\nestablished the days and the nights, the seasons and the years, with\r\nthe length\r\n\r\n{p. 179}\r\n\r\nthereof, and the sun was condemned to travel across the firmament by\r\nthe same trail day after day till the end of time.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere we have the succession of arrows, or comets, found in the legend\r\nof the Aztecs, and here as before it is the last arrow that destroys\r\nthe sun. And here, again, we have the conflagration, the fragments of\r\nsomething falling on the earth, the long absence of the sun, the\r\ngreat rains and the cold.\r\n\r\nLet us shift the scene again.\r\n\r\nIn Peru--that ancient land of mysterious civilization, that brother\r\nof Egypt and Babylon, looking out through the twilight of time upon\r\nthe silent waters of the Pacific, waiting in its isolation for the\r\nworld once more to come to it-in this strange land we find the\r\nfollowing legend:\r\n\r\n\"_Ere sun and moon was made_, Viracocha, the White One, rose from the\r\nbosom of Lake Titicaca, and presided over the erection of those\r\nwondrous cities whose ruins still dot its islands and western shores,\r\nand whose history is totally lost in the night of time.\"[2]\r\n\r\nHe constructed the sun and moon and created the inhabitants of the\r\nearth. These latter attacked him with murderous intent (the comet\r\nassailed the sun?); but \"scorning such unequal contest he manifested\r\nhis power by hurling the lightning on the hill-sides and _consuming\r\nthe forests_,\" whereupon the creatures he had created humbled\r\nthemselves before him. One of Viracocha names was _At-achuchu_. He\r\ncivilized the Peruvians, taught them arts and agriculture and\r\nreligion; they called him \"The teacher of all things.\" _He came from\r\nthe east_ and disappeared in the Western Ocean. Four civilizers\r\nfollowed him who _emerged from the cave_\r\n\r\n[1. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" October, 1879, p, 799.\r\n\r\n2. Brinton's; \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 192.]\r\n\r\n{p. 180}\r\n\r\nPacarin Tampu, the House of Birth.[1] These four brothers were also\r\ncalled Viracochas, _white men_.\r\n\r\nHere we have the White One coming from the east, hurling his\r\nlightning upon the earth and causing a conflagration; and afterward\r\ncivilized men emerged from a cave. They were white men; and it is to\r\nthese cave-born men that Peru owed its first civilization.\r\n\r\nHere is another and a more amplified version of the Peruvian legend:\r\n\r\nThe Peruvians believed in a god called At-achuchu, already referred\r\nto, the creator of heaven and earth, and the maker of all things.\r\nFrom him came the first man, Guamansuri.\r\n\r\nThis first mortal is mixed up with events that seem to refer to the\r\nAge of Fire.\r\n\r\nHe descended to the earth, and \"there seduced the sister of certain\r\nGuachemines, rayless ones, or Darklings\"; that is to say, certain\r\nPowers of Darkness, \"who then possessed it. For this crime they\r\ndestroyed him.\" That is to say, the Powers of Darkness destroyed the\r\nlight. But not for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Their sister proved pregnant, and died in her labor, giving birth to\r\ntwo eggs,\" the sun and moon. \"From these emerged the two brothers,\r\nApocatequil and Piguerao.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed the same great battle, to which we have so many\r\nreferences in the legends, and which always ends, as in the case of\r\nCain and Abel, in one brother slaughtering the other. In this case,\r\nApocatequil \"was the more powerful. By touching the corpse of his\r\nmother (the sun?) he brought her to life, he drove off and slew the\r\nGuachemines (the Powers of Darkness), and, directed by\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 193.]\r\n\r\n{p. 181}\r\n\r\n_At-achuchu_, released the race of Indians from the soil by turning\r\nit up with a golden spade.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, he dug them out from the cave in which they were\r\nburied.\r\n\r\n\"For this reason they adored him as their maker. He it was, they\r\nthought, who produced the thunder and the lightning by _hurling\r\nstones with his sling;_ and the thunder-bolts that fall, said they,\r\nare his children. Few villages were willing to be without one or more\r\nof these. They were in appearance _small, round, smooth stones_, but\r\nhad the admirable properties of securing fertility to the fields,\r\nprotecting from lightning,\" etc.[1]\r\n\r\nI shift the scene again; or, rather, group together the legends of\r\nthree different localities. I quote:\r\n\r\n\"The Takahlis\" (the Tacullies already referred to) \"of the North\r\nPacific coast, the Yurucares of the Bolivian Cordilleras, and the\r\nMbocobi of Paraguay, each and all attribute the destruction of the\r\nworld to a _general conflagration_, which swept over the earth,\r\nconsuming everything living _except a few who took refuge in a deep\r\ncave_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe Botocudos of Brazil believed that the world was once destroyed by\r\nthe moon falling upon it.\r\n\r\nLet us shift the scene again northward:\r\n\r\nThere was once, according to the Ojibway legends, a boy; the sun\r\nburned and spoiled his bird-skin coat; and he swore that he would\r\nhave vengeance. He persuaded his sister to make him a noose of her\r\nown hair. He fixed it just where the sun would strike the land as it\r\nrose above the earth's disk; and, sure enough, he caught the sun, and\r\nheld it fast, so that it did not rise.\r\n\r\n\"The animals who ruled the earth were immediately put into _great\r\ncommotion. They had no light._ They called a council to debate upon\r\nthe matter, and to appoint\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 165.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 217.]\r\n\r\n{p. 182}\r\n\r\nsome one to go and cut the cord, for this was a very hazardous\r\nenterprise, as the rays of the sun would _burn up whoever came so\r\nnear_. At last the dormouse undertook it, for at this time the\r\ndormouse was the largest animal in the world\" (the mastodon?); \"when\r\nit stood up it looked like a mountain. When it got to the place where\r\nthe sun was snared, its back began to _smoke and burn with the\r\nintensity of the heat_, and the top of its carcass was reduced to\r\n_enormous heaps of ashes_. It succeeded, however, in cutting the cord\r\nwith its teeth and freeing the sun, but it was _reduced to very small\r\nsize_, and has remained so ever since.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a reminiscence of the destruction of the great\r\nmammalia.[1] The \"enormous heaps of ashes\" may represent the vast\r\ndeposits of clay-dust.\r\n\r\nAmong the Wyandots a story was told, in the seventeenth century, of a\r\nboy whose father was killed and eaten by a bear, and his mother by\r\nthe Great Hare. He was small, but of prodigious strength. He climbed\r\na tree, like Jack of the Bean-Stalk, until he reached heaven.\r\n\r\n\"He set his snares for game, but when he got up at night to look at\r\nthem he found _everything on fire_. His sister told him he had caught\r\nthe sun unawares, and when the boy, Chakabech, went to see, so it\r\nwas. But he dared not go near enough to let him out. But by chance he\r\nfound a little mouse, and blew upon her until she grew so big\" (again\r\nthe mastodon) \"that she could set the sun free, and he went on his\r\nway. But while he was held in the snare, _day failed down here on\r\nearth_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the age of darkness[2]\r\n\r\nThe Dog-Rib Indians, far in the northwest of America, near the\r\nEsquimaux, have a similar story: Chakabech becomes Chapewee. He too\r\nclimbs a tree, but it is in pursuit\r\n\r\n[1. Tylor's \"Early History of Mankind,\" p. 848.\r\n\r\n2. Le Jeune (1637), in \"Rélations des Jesuits dans la Nouvelle\r\nFrance,\" vol. i, p. 54.]\r\n\r\n{p. 183}\r\n\r\nof a squirrel, until he reaches heaven. He set a snare made of his\r\nsister's hair and caught the sun. \"_The sky was instantly darkened_.\r\nChapewee's family said to him, 'You must have done something wrong\r\nwhen you were aloft, _for we no longer enjoy the light of day_.' 'I\r\nhave,' replied he, 'but it was unintentionally.' Chapewee sent a\r\nnumber of animals to cut the snare, but the intense _heat reduced\r\nthem all to ashes_.\" At last the ground-mole working in the earth cut\r\nthe snare but lost its sight, \"and its nose and teeth have ever since\r\nbeen brown as if burnt.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe natives of Siberia represented the mastodon as a great mole\r\nburrowing in the earth and casting up ridges of earth--the sight of\r\nthe sun killed him.\r\n\r\nThese sun-catching legends date back to a time when the races of the\r\nearth had not yet separated. Hence we find the same story, in almost\r\nthe same words, in Polynesia and America.\r\n\r\nMaui is the Polynesian god of the ancient days. He concluded, as did\r\nTa-wats, that the days were too short. He wanted the sun to slow-up,\r\nbut it would not. So he proceeded to catch it in a noose like the\r\nOjibway boy and the Wyandot youth. The manufacture of the noose, we\r\nare told, led to the discovery of the art of rope-making. He took his\r\nbrothers with him; he armed himself, like Samson, with a jaw-bone,\r\nbut instead of the jaw-bone of an ass, he, with much better taste,\r\nselected the jawbone of his mistress. She may have been a lady of\r\nfine conversational powers. They traveled far, like Ta-wats, even to\r\nthe very edge of the place where the sun rises. There he set his\r\nnoose. The sun came and put his head and fore-paws into it; then the\r\nbrothers pulled the ropes\r\n\r\n[1. Richardson's \"Narrative of Franklin's Second Expedition,\" p. 291.]\r\n\r\n{p. 184}\r\n\r\ntight and Maui gave him a great whipping with the jawbone; he\r\nscreamed and roared; they held him there for a long time, (the Age of\r\nDarkness,) and at last they let him go; and weak from his wounds,\r\n(obscured by clouds,) he crawls slowly along his path. Here the jaw\r\nof the wolf Fenris, which reached from earth to heaven, in the\r\nScandinavian legends, becomes a veritable jaw-bone which beats and\r\nruins the sun.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the sun in this Polynesian legend is _Ra_,\r\nprecisely the same as the name of the god of the sun in Egypt, while\r\nin Hindostan the sun-god is Ra-ma.\r\n\r\nIn another Polynesian legend we read of a character who was satisfied\r\nwith nothing, \"even pudding would not content him,\" and this\r\nunconscionable fellow worried his family out of all heart with his\r\nnew ways and ideas. He represents a progressive, inventive race. He\r\nwas building a great house, but the days were too short; so, like\r\nMaui, he determined to catch the sun in nets and ropes; but the sun\r\nwent on. At last he succeeded; he caught him. The good man then had\r\ntime to finish his house, but the sun cried and cried \"until the\r\nisland of Savai was nearly drowned.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAnd these myths of the sun being tied by a cord are, strange to say,\r\nfound even in Europe. The legends tell us:\r\n\r\n\"In North Germany the townsmen of Bösum sit up in their church-tower\r\nand hold the sun by a cable all day long; taking care of it at night,\r\nand letting it up again in the morning. In 'Reynard the Fox,' the day\r\nis bound with a rope, and its bonds only allow it to come slowly on.\r\nThe Peruvian Inca said the sun is like a tied beast, who goes ever\r\nround and round, in the same track.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThat is to say, they recognized that he is not a god, but the servant\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n[1. Tyler's \"Early Mankind,\" p. 347.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 352.]\r\n\r\n{p. 185}\r\n\r\nVerily the bands that knit the races of the earth together are\r\nwonderful indeed, and they radiate, as I shall try to show, from one\r\nspot of the earth's surface, alike to Polynesia, Europe, and America.\r\n\r\nLet us change the scene again to the neighborhood of the Aztecs:\r\n\r\nWe are told of two youths, the ancestors of the Miztec chiefs, who\r\nseparated, each going his own way to conquer lands for himself:\r\n\r\n\"The braver of the two, coming to the vicinity of Tilantongo, armed\r\nwith buckler and bow, was _much vexed and oppressed by the ardent\r\nrays of the sun_, which he took to be the lord of that district,\r\nstriving to prevent his entrance therein. Then the young man strung\r\nhis bow, and advanced his buckler before him, and drew shafts from\r\nhis quiver. He shot these against the great light even till the going\r\ndown of the same; then he took possession of all that land, seeing\r\nthat he had _grievously wounded the sun_ and forced him to hide\r\nbehind the mountains. Upon this story is founded the lordship of all\r\nthe caciques of Mizteca, and upon their descent from this mighty\r\narcher, their ancestor. Even to this day, the chiefs of the Miztecs\r\nblazon as their arms a plumed chief with bow and arrows and shield,\r\nand the sun in front of him setting behind gray clouds.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAre these two young men, one of whom attacks and injures the sun, the\r\ntwo wolves of the Gothic legends, the two comets, who devoured the\r\nsun and moon? And did the Miztec barbarians, in their vanity, claim\r\ndescent from these monstrous creatures of the sky? Why not, when the\r\nhistorical heroes of antiquity traced their pedigree back to the\r\ngods; and the rulers of Peru, Egypt, and China pretended to be the\r\nlineal offspring of the sun? And there are not wanting those, even in\r\nEurope, who\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 73.]\r\n\r\n{p. 186}\r\n\r\nyet believe that the blood-royal differs in some of its constituents\r\nfrom the blood of the common people\r\n\r\n     \"What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster\r\n     Sink in the ground? \"\r\n\r\nIn the Aztec legends there were four ages, or suns, as they were\r\ntermed. The first terminated, according to Gama, in a destruction of\r\nthe people of the world by hunger; the second ended in a destruction\r\nby winds; in the third, _the human race was swept away by fire_, and\r\nthe fourth destruction was by water. And in the Hindoo legends we\r\nfind the same series of great cycles, or ages: one of the Shastas\r\nteaches that the human race has been destroyed four times--first by\r\nwater, secondly by winds, thirdly the earth swallowed them, and\r\n_lastly fire consumed them_.[1]\r\n\r\nI come now to a most extraordinary record:\r\n\r\nIn the prayer of the Aztecs to the great god Tezcatlipoca, \"the\r\nsupreme, invisible god,\" a prayer offered up in time of pestilence,\r\nwe have the most remarkable references to the destruction of the\r\npeople by stones and fire. It would almost seem as if this great\r\nprayer, noble and sublime in its language, was first poured out in\r\nthe very midst of the Age of Fire, wrung from the human heart by the\r\nmost appalling calamity that ever overtook the race; and that it was\r\ntransmitted from age to age, as the hymns of the Vedas and the\r\nprayers of the Hebrews have been preserved, for thousands of years,\r\ndown to our own times, when it was carefully transcribed by a\r\nmissionary priest. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"O mighty Lord, under whose wing we find defense and shelter, thou\r\nart invisible and impalpable, even as night and the air. How can I,\r\nthat am so mean and worthless, dare to appear before thy majesty?\r\nStuttering\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 232.]\r\n\r\n{p. 187}\r\n\r\nand with rude lips I speak, ungainly is the manner of my speech as\r\none leaping among furrows, as one advancing unevenly; for all this I\r\nfear to raise thine anger, and to provoke instead of appeasing thee;\r\nnevertheless, thou wilt do unto me as may please thee. O Lord, _thou\r\nhast held it good to forsake us in these days_, according to the\r\ncounsel that thou hast as well in heaven as in hades,--alas for us,\r\nin that thine _anger and indignation has descended upon us in these\r\ndays_; alas in that the many and grievous afflictions of thy wrath\r\nhave overgone, and swallowed us up, _coming down even as stones,\r\nspears, and arrows upon the wretches that inhabit the earth!_--this\r\nis the sore pestilence with which we are afflicted and _almost\r\ndestroyed_. O valiant and all-powerful Lord, the common people are\r\nalmost _made an end of and destroyed;_ a great destruction the ruin\r\nand pestilence already make in this nation; and, what is most pitiful\r\nof all, the little children, that are innocent and understand\r\nnothing, only to play with _pebbles and to heap up little mounds of\r\nearth, they too die, broken and dashed to pieces as against stones\r\nand a wall_--a thing very pitiful and grievous to be seen, for there\r\nremain of them not even those in the cradles, nor those that could\r\nnot walk or speak. Ah, Lord, how _all things become confounded!_ of\r\nyoung and old and of men and women there _remains neither branch nor\r\nroot;_ thy nation, and thy people, and thy wealth, _are leveled down\r\nand destroyed_.\r\n\r\n\"O our Lord, protector of all, most valiant and most kind, _what is\r\nthis?_\r\n\r\n\"Thine anger and thine indignation, does it glory or delight in\r\n_hurling the stone, and arrow, and spear? The FIRE of the pestilence,\r\nmade exceeding hot, is upon thy nation_, as a fire in a hut, _burning\r\nand smoking, leaving nothing upright or sound_. The grinders of thy\r\nteeth,\" (the falling stones), \"are employed, and thy bitter whips\r\nupon the miserable of thy people, who have become lean, and of little\r\nsubstance, even as a hollow green cane.\r\n\r\nYea, _what doest thou now_, O Lord, most strong, compassionate,\r\ninvisible, and impalpable, whose will all things obey, upon whose\r\ndisposal depends the rule of the world, to whom all are\r\nsubject,--what in thy divine breast\r\n\r\n{p. 188}\r\n\r\nhast thou decreed? Peradventure, hast thou altogether forsaken thy\r\nnation and thy people? Hast thou verily determined that it _utterly\r\nperish_, and that there be no more memory of it in the world, _that\r\nthe peopled place become a wooded hill, and_ A WILDERNESS OF STONES?\r\nPeradventure, wilt thou permit that the temples, and the places of\r\nprayer, and the altars, built for thy service, _be razed_ and\r\ndestroyed, and no memory of them left?\r\n\r\n\"Is it, indeed, possible that thy wrath and punishment and vexed\r\nindignation are altogether implacable, and will go on to the end to\r\nour destruction? Is it already fixed in thy divine counsel that there\r\nis to be no mercy nor pity for us, _until the arrows of thy fury are\r\nspent to our utter perdition and destruction?_ Is it possible that\r\nthis lash and chastisement is not given for our correction and\r\namendment, but only for _our total destruction and obliteration;_\r\nthat THE SUN SHALL NEVER MORE SHINE UPON US, _but that we must remain\r\nin_ PERPETUAL DARKNESS and silence; that never more wilt thou look\r\nupon us with eyes of mercy, neither little nor much?\r\n\r\n\"Wilt thou after this fashion destroy the wretched sick that can not\r\nfind rest, nor turn from side to side, whose mouth and teeth _are\r\nfilled with earth and scurf?_ It is a sore thing to tell how we are\r\nall in darkness, having none understanding nor sense to watch for or\r\naid one another. We are all as drunken, and without understanding:\r\nwithout hope of any aid, _already the little children perish of\r\nhunger_, for there is none to give them food, nor drink, nor\r\nconsolation, nor caress; none to give the breast to them that suck,\r\n_for their fathers and mothers have died and left them orphans_,\r\nsuffering for the sins of their fathers.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a graphic picture is all this of the remnant of a civilized\r\nreligious race hiding in some deep cavern, in darkness, their friends\r\nslaughtered by the million by the falling stones, coming like arrows\r\nand spears, and the pestilence of poisonous gases; their\r\nfood-supplies scanty; they themselves horrified, awe-struck,\r\ndespairing, fearing that they would never again see the light; that\r\nthis dreadful day was the end of the human race\r\n\r\n{p. 189}\r\n\r\nand of the world itself! And one of them, perhaps a priest, certainly\r\na great man, wrought up to eloquence, through the darkness and the\r\nterror, puts up this pitiful and pathetic cry to the supreme God for\r\nmercy, for protection, for deliverance from the awful visitation.\r\n\r\nHow wonderful to think that the priesthood of the Aztecs have through\r\nages preserved to us, down to this day, this cavern-hymn--one of the\r\nmost ancient of the utterances of the heart of man extant on the\r\nearth--and have preserved it long after the real meaning of its words\r\nwas lost to them!\r\n\r\nThe prayer continues\r\n\r\n\"O our Lord, all-powerful, full of mercy, our refuge, though indeed\r\nthine anger and indignation, thine arrows and stones, have sorely\r\nhurt this poor people, let it be as a father or a mother that rebukes\r\nchildren, pulling their ears, pinching their arms, whipping them with\r\nnettles, pouring chill water upon them, all being done that they may\r\namend their puerility and childishness. Thy chastisement and\r\nindignation have lorded and prevailed over these thy servants, over\r\nthis poor people, even as rain falling upon the trees and the green\r\ncanes, being touched of the wind, drops also upon those that are\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\"O most compassionate Lord, thou knowest that the common folk are as\r\nchildren, that being whipped they cry and sob and repent of what they\r\nhave done. Peradventure, already these poor people by reason of their\r\nchastisement weep, sigh, blame, and murmur against themselves; in thy\r\npresence they blame and bear witness against their bad deeds, and\r\npunish themselves therefor. Our Lord, most compassionate, pitiful,\r\nnoble, and precious, let a time be given the people to repent; let\r\nthe past chastisement suffice; let it end here, to begin again if the\r\nreform endure not. Pardon and overlook the sins of the people; cause\r\nthine anger and thy resentment to cease; repress it again within thy\r\nbreast _that it destroy no further_; let it rest there; let it cease,\r\nfor of a surety _none can avoid death nor escape to anyplace_.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 190}\r\n\r\n\"We owe tribute to death; and all that live in the world are vassals\r\nthereof; this tribute shall every man pay with his life. None shall\r\navoid from following death, for it is thy messenger what hour soever\r\nit may be sent, hungering and thirsting always to devour all that are\r\nin the world and so powerful that none shall escape; then, indeed,\r\nshall every man be judged according to his deeds. O most pitiful\r\nLord, at least take pity and have mercy upon the children that are in\r\nthe cradles, upon those that can not walk Have mercy also, O Lord,\r\nupon the poor and very miserable, who have nothing to eat, nor to\r\ncover themselves withal, nor a place to sleep, who do not know what\r\nthing a happy day is, whose days pass altogether in pain, affliction,\r\nand sadness. Than this, were it not better, O Lord, if thou shouldst\r\nforget to have mercy upon the soldiers and upon the men of war whom\r\nthou wilt have need of some time? Behold, it is better to die in war\r\nand go to serve food and drink in the house of the Sun, than to die\r\nin this pestilence and descend to hades. O most strong Lord,\r\nprotector of all, lord of the earth, governor of the world and\r\nuniversal master, let the sport and satisfaction thou hast already\r\ntaken in this past punishment suffice; _make an end of this smoke and\r\nfog_ of thy resentment; _quench also the burning and destroying fire\r\nof thine anger;_ let _serenity come and clearness;_ let the small\r\nbirds of thy people begin to sing and\" (to) \"_approach the sun; give\r\nthem_ QUIET WEATHER; so that they may cause their voices to reach thy\r\nhighness, and thou mayest know them.\"[1]\r\n\r\nNow it may be doubted by some whether this most extraordinary\r\nsupplication could have come down from the Glacial Age; but it must\r\nbe remembered that it may have been many times repeated in the deep\r\ncavern before the terror fled from the souls of the desolate fragment\r\nof the race; and, once established as a religious prayer, associated\r\nwith such dreadful events, who would dare to change a word of it?\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 200.]\r\n\r\n{p. 191}\r\n\r\nWho would dare, among ourselves, to alter a syllable of the \"Lord's\r\nPrayer\"? Even though Christianity should endure for ten thousand\r\nyears upon the face of the earth; even though the art of writing were\r\nlost, and civilization itself had perished, it would pass unchanged\r\nfrom mouth to mouth and from generation to generation, crystallized\r\ninto imperishable diamonds of thought, by the conservative power of\r\nthe religious instinct.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of the authenticity of this and the other\r\nancient prayers to Tezcatlipoca, which I shall quote hereafter. I\r\nrepeat what H. H. Bancroft says, in a foot-note, in his great work:\r\n\r\n\"Father Bernardino de Sahagun, a Spanish Franciscan, was _one of the\r\nfirst preachers sent to Mexico_, where he was much employed in the\r\ninstruction of the native youth, working for the most part in the\r\nprovince of Tezcuco. While there, in the city of Tepeopulco, in the\r\nlatter part of the sixteenth century, he began the work, best known\r\nto us as the 'Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España,' from\r\nwhich the above prayers have been taken. It would be hard to imagine\r\na work of such a character constructed after a better fashion of\r\nworking than his. Gathering the principal natives of the town in\r\nwhich he carried on his labors, he induced them to appoint him a\r\nnumber of persons, the most learned and experienced in the things of\r\nwhich he proposed to write. These learned Mexicans being collected,\r\nFather Sahagun was accustomed to get them to paint down in their\r\nnative fashion the various legends, details of history and mythology,\r\nand so on, that he wanted; at the foot of the said. pictures these\r\nlearned Mexicans wrote out the explanations of the same in the\r\nMexican tongue; and this explanation the Father Sahagun translated\r\ninto Spanish. That translation purports to be what we now read as the\r\n'Historia General.'\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Native Races of the Pacific States,\" vol. iii, p. 231.]\r\n\r\n{p. 192}\r\n\r\nSahagun was a good and holy man, who was doubtless inspired of God,\r\nin the face of much opposition and many doubts, to perpetuate, for\r\nthe benefit of the race, these wonderful testimonials of man's\r\nexistence, condition, opinions, and feelings in the last great\r\ncataclysm which shook the whole world and nearly destroyed it.\r\n\r\nReligions may perish; the name of the Deity may change with race and\r\ntime and tongue; but He can never despise such noble, exalted,\r\neloquent appeals from the hearts of millions of men, repeated through\r\nthousands of generations, as these Aztec prayers have been. Whether\r\naddressed to Tezcatlipoca, Zeus, Jove, Jehovah, or God, they pass\r\nalike direct from the heart of the creature to the heart of the\r\nCreator; they are of the threads that tie together matter and spirit.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me recapitulate\r\n\r\n1. The original surface-rocks, underneath the Drift, are, we have\r\nseen, decomposed and changed, for varying depths of from one to one\r\nhundred feet, by fire; they are metamorphosed, and their metallic\r\nconstituents vaporized out of them by heat.\r\n\r\n2. Only tremendous heat could have lifted the water of the seas into\r\nclouds, and formed the age of snow and floods evidenced by the\r\nsecondary Drift.\r\n\r\n3. The traditions of the following races tell us that the earth was\r\nonce swept by a great conflagration:\r\n\r\n_a_. The ancient Britons, as narrated in the mythology of the Druids.\r\n\r\n_b_. The ancient Greeks, as told by Hesiod.\r\n\r\n_c_. The ancient Scandinavians, as appears in the _Elder Edda_ and\r\n_Younger Edda_.\r\n\r\n_d_. The ancient Romans, as narrated by Ovid.\r\n\r\n_e_. The ancient Toltecs of Central America, as told in their sacred\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n{p. 193}\r\n\r\n_f_. The ancient Aztecs of Mexico, as transcribed by Fray de Olmos.\r\n\r\n_g_. The ancient Persians, as recorded in the Zend-Avesta.\r\n\r\n_h_. The ancient Hindoos, as told in their sacred books.\r\n\r\n_i_. The Tahoe Indians of California, as appears by their living\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nAlso by the legends of--\r\n\r\n_j_. The Tupi Indians of Brazil.\r\n\r\n_k_. The Tacullies of British America.\r\n\r\n_1_. The Ute Indians of California and Utah.\r\n\r\n_m_. The Peruvians.\r\n\r\n_n_. The Yurucares of the Bolivian Cordilleras.\r\n\r\n_o_. The Mbocobi of Paraguay.\r\n\r\n_p_. The Botocudos of Brazil.\r\n\r\n_q_. The Ojibway Indians of the United States.\r\n\r\n_r_. The Wyandot Indians of the United States.\r\n\r\n_s_. Lastly, the Dog-rib Indians of British Columbia.\r\n\r\nWe must concede that these legends of a world-embracing conflagration\r\nrepresent a race-remembrance of a great fact, or that they are a\r\ncolossal falsehood--an invention of man.\r\n\r\nIf the latter, then that invention and falsehood must have been\r\nconcocted at a time when the ancestors of the Greeks, Romans,\r\nHindoos, Persians, Goths, Toltecs, Aztecs, Peruvians, and the Indians\r\nof Brazil, the United States, the west coast of South America, and\r\nthe northwestern extremity of North America, and the Polynesians,\r\n(who have kindred traditions,) all dwelt together, as one people,\r\nalike in language and alike in color of their hair, eyes, and skin.\r\nAt that time, therefore, all the widely separated regions, now\r\ninhabited by these races, must have been without human inhabitants;\r\nthe race must have been a mere handful, and dwelling in one spot.\r\n\r\n{p. 194}\r\n\r\nWhat vast lapses of time must have been required before mankind\r\nslowly overflowed to these remote regions of the earth, and changed\r\ninto these various races speaking such diverse tongues!\r\n\r\nAnd if we take the ground that this universal tradition of a\r\nworld-conflagration was an invention, a falsehood, then we must\r\nconclude that this handful of men, before they dispersed, in the very\r\ninfancy of the world, shared in the propagation of a prodigious lie,\r\nand religiously perpetuated it for tens of thousands of years.\r\n\r\nAnd then the question arises, How did they hit upon a lie that\r\naccords so completely with the revelations of science? They possessed\r\nno great public works, in that infant age, which would penetrate\r\nthrough hundreds of feet of _débris_, and lay bare the decomposed\r\nrocks beneath; therefore they did not make a theory to suit an\r\nobserved fact.\r\n\r\nAnd how did mankind come to be reduced to a handful? If men grew, in\r\nthe first instance, out of bestial forms, mindless and speechless,\r\nthey would have propagated and covered the world as did the bear and\r\nthe wolf. But after they had passed this stage, and had so far\r\ndeveloped as to be human in speech and brain, some cause reduced them\r\nagain to a handful. What was it? Something, say these legends, some\r\nfiery object, some blazing beast or serpent, which appeared in the\r\nheavens, which filled the world with conflagrations, and which\r\ndestroyed the human race, except a remnant, who saved themselves in\r\ncaverns or in the water; and from this seed, this handful, mankind\r\nagain replenished the earth, and spread gradually to all the\r\ncontinents and the islands of the sea.\r\n\r\n{p. 195}\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                      LEGENDS OF THE CAVE-LIFE.\r\n\r\nI HAVE shown that man could only have escaped the fire, the poisonous\r\ngases, and the falling stones and clay-dust, by taking refuge in the\r\nwater or in the deep caves of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd hence everywhere in the ancient legends we find the races\r\nclaiming that they came up out of the earth. Man was earth-born. The\r\nToltecs and Aztecs traced back their origin to \"the seven caves.\" We\r\nhave seen the ancestors of the Peruvians emerging from the primeval\r\ncave, _Pacarin-Tampu_; and the Aztec Nanahuatzin taking refuge in a\r\ncave; and the ancestors of the Yurucares, the Takahlis, and the\r\nMbocobi of America, all biding themselves from the conflagration in a\r\ncave; and we have seen the tyrannical and cruel race of the Tahoe\r\nlegend buried in a cave. And, passing to a far-distant region, we\r\nfind the Bungogees and Pankhoos, Hill tribes, of the most ancient\r\nraces of Chittagong, in British India, relating that \"their ancestors\r\ncame out of a cave in the earth, under the guidance of a chief named\r\nTlandrokpah.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWe read in the Toltec legends that a dreadful hurricane visited the\r\nearth in the early age, and carried away trees, mounds, horses, etc.,\r\nand the people escaped by _seeking safety in caves_ and places where\r\nthe great hurricane\r\n\r\n[1. Captain Lewin, \"The Hill Tribes of Chittagong\" p. 95, 1869.]\r\n\r\n{p. 196}\r\n\r\ncould not reach them. After a few days they came forth \"to see what\r\nhad become of the earth, when they found it all populated with\r\nmonkeys. All this time they were in darkness, without the light of\r\nthe sun Or the moon, which the wind had brought them.\"[1]\r\n\r\nA North American tribe, a branch of the Tinneh of British America,\r\nhave a legend that \"the earth existed first in a chaotic state, with\r\nonly one human inhabitant, a woman, _who dwelt in a cave_ and lived\r\non berries.\" She met one day a mysterious animal, like a dog, who\r\ntransformed himself into a handsome young man, and they became the\r\nparents of a giant race.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be an allusion to the cave-life in Ovid, where,\r\ndetailing the events that followed soon after the creation, he says:\r\n\r\n\"Then for the first time did the parched air _glow with sultry heat_,\r\nand the _ice_, bound up by the winds, was pendent. Then for the first\r\ntime did men enter houses; those houses were _caverns_, and thick\r\nshrubs, and twigs fastened together with bark.\"[3]\r\n\r\nBut it is in the legends of the Navajo Indians of North America that\r\nwe find the most complete account of the cave-life.\r\n\r\nIt is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Navajos, living north of the Pueblos, say that at one time all\r\nthe nations, Navajos, Pueblos, Coyoteros, and white people, lived\r\ntogether tinder ground, in the heart of a mountain, near the river\r\nSan Juan. _Their food was meat, which they had in abundance, for all\r\nkinds of game were closed up with them in their cave;_ but their\r\nlight was dim, and only endured for a few hours each day. There were,\r\nhappily, two dumb men among the Navajos, flute-players,\r\n\r\n[1. \"North Americans of Antiquity,\" p. 239.\r\n\r\n2. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 105.\r\n\r\n3. \"The Metamorphoses,\" Fable IV.]\r\n\r\n{p. 197}\r\n\r\nwho enlivened the darkness with music. One of these, striking by\r\nchance on the roof of the limbo with his flute, brought out a hollow\r\nsound, upon which the elders of the tribe determined to bore in the\r\ndirection whence the sound came. The flute was then set up against\r\nthe roof, and the Raccoon sent up the tube _to dig a way out_, but he\r\ncould not. Then the Moth-worm mounted into the breach, and bored and\r\nbored till he found himself suddenly on the outside of the mountain,\r\nand _surrounded by water_.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall see hereafter that, in the early ages, mankind, all over the\r\nworld, was divided into totemic septs or families, bearing animal\r\nnames. It was out of this fact that the fables of animals possessing\r\nhuman speech arose. When we are told that the Fox talked to the Crow\r\nor the Wolf, it simply means that a man of the Fox totem talked to a\r\nman of the Crow or Wolf totem. And, consequently, when we read, in\r\nthe foregoing legend, that the Raccoon went up to dig a way out of\r\nthe cave and could not, it signifies that a man of the Raccoon totem\r\nmade the attempt and failed, while a man of the Moth-worm totem\r\nsucceeded. We shall see hereafter that these totemic distinctions\r\nprobably represented original race or ethnic differences.\r\n\r\nThe Navajo legend continues:\r\n\r\n\"Under these novel circumstances, he, (the Moth-worm,) heaped up a\r\nlittle mound, and set himself down on it to observe and ponder the\r\nsituation. A critical situation enough!--for from the four corners of\r\nthe universe four great white Swans bore down upon him, every one\r\nwith two arrows, one under each wing. The Swan from the north reached\r\nhim first, and, having pierced him with two arrows, drew them out and\r\nexamined their points, exclaiming, as the result, 'He is of my race.'\r\nSo, also, in succession, did all the others. Then they went away; and\r\ntoward the directions in which they departed, to the north, south,\r\neast, and west, were found four great _arroyos_,\r\n\r\n{p. 198}\r\n\r\nby which _all the water flowed off, leaving only_ MUD. The Worm now\r\nreturned to the cave, and the Raccoon went up into the mud, _sinking\r\nin it mid-leg deep_, as the marks on his fur show to this day. And\r\nthe wind began to rise, sweeping up the four great _arroyos_, and\r\n_the mud was dried away_.\r\n\r\n\"_Then the men and the animals began to come up from their cave_, and\r\ntheir coming up required several days. First came the Navajos, and no\r\nsooner had they reached the surface than they commenced gaming at\r\n_patole_, their favorite game. Then came the Pueblos and other\r\nIndians, who _crop their hair and build houses_. Lastly came _the\r\nwhite people_, who started off at once _for the rising sun_, and were\r\nlost sight of for many winters.\r\n\r\n\"When these nations lived under ground they all _spake one tongue_;\r\nbut, with the light of day and the level of earth, came many\r\nlanguages. The earth was at this time very small, and _the light was\r\nquite as scanty as it had been down below, for there was as yet no\r\nheaven, no sun, nor moon, nor stars_. So another council of the\r\nancients was held, and a committee of their number appointed to\r\nmanufacture these luminaries.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere we have the same story:\r\n\r\nIn an ancient age, before the races of men had differentiated, a\r\nremnant of mankind was driven, by some great event, into a cave; all\r\nkinds of animals had sought shelter in. the same place;\r\nsomething--the Drift--had closed up the mouth of the cavern; the men\r\nsubsisted on the animals. At last they dug their way out, to find the\r\nworld covered with mud and water. Great winds cut the mud into deep\r\nvalleys, by which the waters ran off. The mud was everywhere;\r\ngradually it dried up. But outside the cave it was nearly as dark as\r\nit was within it; the clouds covered the world; neither sun, moon,\r\nnor stars could be seen; the earth was very small, that is, but\r\nlittle of it was above the waste of waters.\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 81.]\r\n\r\n{p. 199}\r\n\r\nAnd here we have the people longing for the return of the sun. The\r\nlegend proceeds to give an account of the making of the sun and moon.\r\nThe dumb fluter, who had charge of the construction of the sun,\r\nthrough his clumsiness, _came near setting fire to the world_.\r\n\r\n\"_The old men_, however, either more lenient than Zeus, or lacking\r\nhis thunder, contented themselves with forcing the offender back by\r\npuffing the smoke of their pipes into his face.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the event, which properly should have preceded the\r\ncave-story, brought in subsequent to it. The sun nearly burns up the\r\nearth, and the earth is saved amid the smoke of incense from the\r\npipes of the old men--the gods. And we are told that the increasing\r\nsize of the earth has four times rendered it necessary that the sun\r\nshould be put farther back from the earth. The clearer the\r\natmosphere, the farther away the sun has appeared.\r\n\r\n\"At night, also, the other dumb man issues from this cave, bearing\r\nthe moon under his arm, and lighting up such part of the world as he\r\ncan. Next, the old men set to work to make the heavens, intending to\r\n_broider in the stars in beautiful patterns of bears, birds, and such\r\nthings_.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, a civilized race 'began to divide up the heavens into\r\nconstellations, to which they gave the names of the Great and Little\r\nBear, the Wolf, the Serpent, the Dragon, the Eagle, the Swan, the\r\nCrane, the Peacock, the Toucan, the Crow, etc.; some of which names\r\nthey retain among ourselves to this day.\r\n\r\n\"But, just as they had made a beginning, a prairie-wolf rushed in,\r\nand, crying out, 'Why all this trouble and embroidery?' scattered the\r\npile of stars over all the floor of heaven, just as they still lie.\"\r\n\r\nThis iconoclastic and unæsthetical prairie-wolf represents a\r\nbarbarian's incapacity to see in the arrangement\r\n\r\n{p. 200}\r\n\r\nof the stars any such constellations, or, in fact, anything but an\r\nunmeaning jumble of cinders.\r\n\r\nAnd then we learn how the tribes of men separated:\r\n\r\n\"The old men\" (the civilized race, the gods) \"prepared two earthen\r\n_tinages_, or water-jars, and having decorated one with bright\r\ncolors, filled it with trifles; while the other was left plain on the\r\noutside, but filled within with flocks and herds and riches of all\r\nkinds. These jars being covered, and presented to the Navajos and\r\nPueblos, the former chose the gaudy but paltry jar; while the Pueblos\r\nreceived the plain and rich vessel--each nation showing, in its\r\nchoice, traits which characterize it to this day.\"\r\n\r\nIn the legends of the Lenni-Lenape,--the Delaware Indians,--mankind\r\nwas once buried in the earth with a wolf; and they owed their release\r\nto the wolf, who scratched away the soil and dug out a means of\r\nescape for the men and for himself. The Root-Diggers of California\r\nwere released in the same way by a coyote.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"The Tonkaways, a wild people of Texas, still celebrate this early\r\nentombment of the race in a most curious fashion. They have a grand\r\nannual dance. One of them, naked as he was born, is _buried in the\r\nearth_; the others, clothed in wolf-skins, walk over him, snuff\r\naround him, howl in lupine style, and finally dig _him up with their\r\nnails_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nCompare this American custom with the religious ceremony of an\r\nancient Italian tribe:\r\n\r\n\"Three thousand years ago the Hirpani, or Wolves, an ancient Sabine\r\ntribe of Italy, were wont to collect on Mount Soracte, and there go\r\nthrough certain rites, in memory of an oracle which predicted their\r\nextinction when they ceased to gain their living as wolves do, by\r\nviolence and plunder. Therefore they dressed in wolf-skins,\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 247.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n{p. 201}\r\n\r\n_ran with barks and howls over burning coals_, and gnawed wolfishly\r\nwhatever they could seize.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAll the tribes of the Creeks, Seminoles, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and\r\nNatchez, who, according to tradition, were in remote times banded\r\ninto one common confederacy, unanimously located their earliest\r\nancestry near an artificial eminence in the valley of the Big Black\r\nRiver, in the Natchez country, whence they pretended to have emerged.\r\nThis hill is an elevation of earth about half a mile square and\r\nfifteen or twenty feet high. From its northeast corner a wall of\r\nequal height extends for nearly half a mile to the high land. This\r\nwas the _Nunne Chaha_, properly _Nanih waiya_, sloping hill, famous\r\nin Choctaw story, and which Captain Gregg found they had not yet\r\nforgotten in their Western home.\r\n\r\n\"The legend was, that in its center was a cave, the house of the\r\nMaster of Breath. Here he made the first men from the _clay around\r\nhim, and, as at that time the waters covered the earth_, he raised\r\nthe wall to dry them on. When the soft mud had hardened into elastic\r\nflesh and firm bone, he _banished the waters to their channels and\r\nbeds_, and gave the dry land to his creatures.\"[2]\r\n\r\nHere, again, we have the beginnings of the present race of men in a\r\ncave, surrounded by clay and water, which covered the earth, and we\r\nhave the water subsiding into its channels and beds, and the dry land\r\nappearing, whereupon the men emerged from the cave.\r\n\r\nA parallel to this Southern legend occurs among the Six Nations of\r\nthe North. They with one consent looked to a mountain near the falls\r\nof the Oswego River, in the State of New York, as the locality where\r\ntheir forefathers saw the light of day; and their name, Oneida,\r\nsignifies _the people of the stone_.\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 217.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 242.]\r\n\r\n{p. 202}\r\n\r\nThe cave of Pacarin-Tampu, already alluded to, the Lodgings of the\r\nDawn, or the Place of Birth of the Peruvians, was five leagues\r\ndistant from Cuzco, surrounded by a sacred grove, and inclosed with\r\ntemples of great antiquity.\r\n\r\n\"From its hallowed recesses the mythical civilizers, of Peru, tile\r\nfirst of men, emerged, and in it, during the time of the flood, the\r\nremnants of the race escaped the fury of the waves.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWe read in the legends of Oraibi, hereafter quoted more fully, that\r\nthe people climbed up a ladder from a lower world to this--that is,\r\nthey ascended from the cave in which they had taken refuge. This was\r\nin an age of cold and darkness; there was yet no sun or moon.\r\n\r\nThe natives in the neighborhood of Mount Shasta, in Northern\r\nCalifornia, have a strange legend which refers to the age of Caves\r\nand Ice.\r\n\r\nThey say the Great Spirit made Mount Shasta first:\r\n\r\n\"_Boring a hole in the sky_,\" (the heavens cleft in twain of the\r\nEdda?) \"using a _large stone_ as an auger,\" (the fall of stones and\r\npebbles?) \"he pushed down _snow and ice until they reached the\r\ndesired height;_ then he stepped from cloud to cloud down to _the\r\ngreat icy pile_, and from it to the earth, where he planted the first\r\ntrees by merely putting his finger into the soil here and there. _The\r\nsun began to melt the snow; the snow produced water; the water ran\r\ndown the sides of the mountains_, refreshed the trees, and made\r\nrivers. The Creator gathered the leaves that fell from the trees,\r\nblew upon them, and they became birds,\" etc.[2]\r\n\r\nThis is a representation of the end of the Glacial Age.\r\n\r\nBut the legends of these Indians of Mount Shasta go still further.\r\nAfter narrating, as above, the fall of a\r\n\r\n[1. Balboa, \"Histoire du Pérou,\" p. 4.\r\n\r\n2. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n{p. 203}\r\n\r\nstone from heaven, and the formation of immense masses of ice, which\r\nsubsequently melted and formed rivers, and after the Creator had made\r\ntrees, birds,. and animals, especially the grizzly bear, then we have\r\na legend which reminds us of the cave-life which accompanied the\r\ngreat catastrophe:\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, this animal\" (the grizzly bear) \"was then so large, strong,\r\nand cunning, that the Creator somewhat feared him, and hollowed out\r\nMount Shasta as a wigwam for himself, where he might reside while on\r\nearth in the most perfect security and comfort. So the smoke was soon\r\nto be seen curling up from the mountain where the Great Spirit and\r\nhis family lived, and still live, though their hearth-fire is alive\r\nno longer, now that the white-man is in the land.\"\r\n\r\nHere the superior race seeks shelter in a cave on Mount Shasta, and\r\ntheir camp-fire is associated with the smoke which once went forth\r\nout of the volcano; while an inferior race, a Neanderthal race, dwell\r\nin the plains at the foot of the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"This was thousands of snows ago, and there came after this a late\r\nand severe spring-time, in which a memorable storm blew up from the\r\nsea, shaking the huge lodge\" (Mount Shasta) \"to its base.\"\r\n\r\n(Another recollection of the Ice Age.)\r\n\r\n\"The Great Spirit commanded his daughter, little more than an infant,\r\nto go up and bid the wind to be still, cautioning her, at the same\r\ntime, in his fatherly way, not to put her head out into the blast,\r\nbut only to thrust out her little red arm and make a sign, before she\r\ndelivered her message.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere we seem to have a reminiscence of the cave-dwellers, looking out\r\nat the terrible tempest from their places of shelter.\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n{p. 204}\r\n\r\nThe child of the Great Spirit exposes herself too much, is caught by\r\nthe wind and blown down the mountain-side, where she is found,\r\nshivering on the snow, by a family of grizzly bears. These grizzly\r\nbears evidently possessed some humane as well as human traits: \"They\r\nwalked then on their hind-legs like men, and talked, and carried\r\nclubs, using the fore-limbs as men use their arms.\" They represent in\r\ntheir bear-skins the rude, fur-clad race that were developed during\r\nthe intense cold of the Glacial Age.\r\n\r\nThe child of the Great Spirit, the superior race, intermarries with\r\none of the grizzly bears, and _from this union came the race of men_,\r\nto wit, the Indians.\r\n\r\n\"But the Great Spirit punished the grizzly bears by depriving them of\r\nthe power of speech, and of standing erect--in short, by making true\r\nbears of them. But no Indian will, to this day, kill a grizzly bear,\r\nrecognizing as he does the tie of blood.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, we are told:\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants of central Europe and the Teutonic races who came\r\nlate to England place their mythical heroes under ground in caves, in\r\nvaults beneath enchanted castles, or _in mounds_ which rise up and\r\nopen, and show their buried inhabitants alive and busy about the\r\navocations of earthly men. . . . In Morayshire the buried race are\r\n_supposed to be under the sandhills_, as they are in some parts of\r\nBrittany.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAssociated with these legends we find many that refer to the time of\r\ngreat cold, and snow, and ice. I give one or two specimens:\r\n\r\nIn the story of the Iroquois, (see p. 173, _ante_,) we are told that\r\nthe White One, [the Light One, the Sun,] after he had destroyed the\r\nmonster who covered the earth with\r\n\r\n[1. \"Frost and Fire,\" vol. ii, p. 190.]\r\n\r\n{p. 205}\r\n\r\nblood and stones, then destroyed the gigantic frog. The frog, a\r\ncold-blooded, moist reptile, was always the emblem of water and cold;\r\nit represented the great ice-fields that squatted, frog-like, on the\r\nface of the earth. It had \"swallowed all the waters,\" says the\r\nIroquois legend; that is, \"the waters were congealed in it; and when\r\nit was killed great and destructive torrents broke forth and\r\ndevastated the land, and Manibozho, the White One, the beneficent\r\nSun, guided these waters into smooth streams and lakes.\" The Aztecs\r\nadored the goddess of water under the figure of a great green frog\r\ncarved from a single emerald.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the Omaha we have the fable of \"How the Rabbit killed the Winter,\"\r\ntold in the Indian manner. The Rabbit was probably a reminiscence of\r\nthe Great Hare, Manabozho; and he, probably, as we shall see, a\r\nrecollection of a great race, whose totem was the Hare.\r\n\r\nI condense the Indian story:\r\n\r\n\"The Rabbit in the past time moving came where the Winter was. The\r\nWinter said: 'You have not been here lately; sit down.' The Rabbit\r\nsaid he came because his grandmother had altogether _beaten the life\r\nout of him_\" (the fallen _débris_?). \"The Winter went hunting. It was\r\n_very cold: there was a snow-storm_. The Rabbit seared up a deer.\r\n'Shoot him,' said the Rabbit. 'No; I do not hunt such things as\r\nthat,' said the Winter. They came upon some men. That was the\r\nWinter's game. He killed the men and _boiled them for supper_,\"\r\n(cave-cannibalism). \"The Rabbit refused to eat the human flesh. The\r\nWinter went hunting again. The Rabbit found out from the Winter's\r\nwife that the thing the Winter dreaded most of all the world was the\r\nhead of a Rocky Mountain sheep. The Rabbit procured one. _It was\r\ndark_. He threw it suddenly at the Winter, saying, 'Uncle, that\r\n_round thing_ by you is the head of a Rocky Mountain\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 185.]\r\n\r\n{p. 206}\r\n\r\nsheep.' The Winter became altogether dead. Only the woman remained.\r\n_Therefore from that time it has not been very cold_.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, any attempt to interpret such a crude myth must be\r\nguess-work. It shows, however, that the Indians believed that there\r\nwas a time when the winter was much more severe than it is now; it\r\nwas very cold and dark. Associated with it is the destruction of men\r\nand cannibalism. At last the Rabbit brings a round object, (the\r\nSun?), the head of a Rocky Mountain sheep, and the Winter looks on\r\nit, and perishes.\r\n\r\nEven tropical Peru has its legend of the Age of Ice.\r\n\r\nGarcilaso de la Vega, a descendant of the Incas, has preserved an\r\nancient indigenous poem of his nation, which seems to allude to a\r\ngreat event, the breaking to fragments of some large object,\r\nassociated with ice and snow. Dr. Brinton translates it from the\r\nQuichua, as follows\r\n\r\n     \"Beauteous princess,\r\n     Lo, thy brother\r\n     _Breaks thy vessel\r\n     Now in fragments_.\r\n     From the blow come\r\n     Thunder, lightning,\r\n     Strokes of lightning\r\n     And thou, princess,\r\n     Tak'st the water,\r\n     With it raineth,\r\n     And _the hail_, or\r\n     _Snow dispenseth_.\r\n     Viracocha,\r\n     World-constructor,\r\n     World-enlivener,\r\n     To this office\r\n     Thee appointed,\r\n     Thee created.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1. \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 167.]\r\n\r\n{p. 207}\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, How in such a period of terror and calamity--as\r\nwe must conceive the comet to have caused-would men think of finding\r\nrefuge in caves?\r\n\r\nThe answer is plain: either they or their ancestors had lived in\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\nCaves were the first shelters of uncivilized men. It was not\r\nnecessary to fly to the caves through the rain of falling _débris_;\r\nmany were doubtless already in them when the great world-storm broke,\r\nand others naturally sought their usual dwelling-places.\r\n\r\n\"The cavern,\" says Brinton, \"dimly lingered in the memories of\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nMan is born of the earth; he is made of the clay like Adam, created--\r\n\r\n            \"Of good red clay,\r\n     Haply from Mount Aornus, beyond sweep\r\n     Of the black eagle's wing.\"\r\n\r\nThe cave-temples of India-the oldest temples, probably, on earth--are\r\na reminiscence of this cave-life.\r\n\r\nWe shall see hereafter that Lot and his daughters \"dwelt in a cave\";\r\nand we shall find Job bidden away in the \"narrow-mouthed bottomless\"\r\npit or cave.\r\n\r\n[1. \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 244.]\r\n\r\n{p. 208}\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                    LEGENDS OF THE AGE OF DARKNESS.\r\n\r\nALL the cosmogonies begin with an Age of Darkness; a damp, cold,\r\nrainy, dismal time.\r\n\r\nHesiod tells us, speaking of the beginning of things\r\n\r\n\"In truth, then, _foremost sprung Chaos_. . . . But from Chaos were\r\nborn _Erebus and black Night;_ and from Night again sprang forth\r\nÆther and Day, whom she bare after having conceived by _union with\r\nErebus_.\"\r\n\r\nAristophanes, in his \"Aves,\" says:[1]\r\n\r\n\"_Chaos and Night and black Erebus_ and wide Tartarus _first\r\nexisted_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nOrpheus says:\r\n\r\n\"_From the beginning the gloomy night enveloped and obscured all\r\nthings_ that were under the ether\" (the clouds). \"The earth was\r\ninvisible on account of the darkness, but the light _broke through\r\nthe ether_\" (the clouds), \"and illuminated the earth.\"\r\n\r\nBy this power were produced the sun, moon, and stars.[3]\r\n\r\nIt is from Sanchoniathon that we derive most of the little we know of\r\nthat ancient and mysterious people, the Ph&oelig;nicians. He lived\r\nbefore the Trojan war; and of his writings but fragments\r\nsurvive--quotations in the writings of others.\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Theogony.\"\r\n\r\n2. Faber's \"Origin of Pagan Idolatry,\" vol. i, p. 255.\r\n\r\n3. Cory's \"Fragments,\" p. 298.]\r\n\r\n{p. 209}\r\n\r\nHe tells us that--\r\n\r\n\"The beginning of all things was a condensed, windy air, or a breeze\r\nof _thick_ air, and a _chaos turbid and black as Erebus_.\r\n\r\n\"Out of this chaos was generated Môt, which some call Ilus,\" (_mud,_)\r\n\"but others the putrefaction of a watery mixture. And from this\r\nsprang all the seed of the creation, and the generation of the\r\nuniverse. . . . And, when the air began to send forth light, winds\r\nwere produced and clouds, and very great defluxions and _torrents of\r\nthe heavenly waters_.\"\r\n\r\nWas this \"thick air\" the air thick with comet-dust, which afterward\r\nbecame the mud? Is this the meaning of the \"_turbid_ chaos\"?\r\n\r\nWe turn to the Babylonian legends. Berosus wrote from records\r\npreserved in the temple of Belus at Babylon. He says:\r\n\r\n\"There was a time in which there _existed nothing but darkness_ and\r\nan _abyss of waters_, wherein resided _most hideous beings_, which\r\nwere produced of a twofold principle.\"\r\n\r\nWere these \"hideous beings\" the comets?\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Laws of Menu,\" of the Hindoos, we learn that the universe\r\nexisted at first in darkness.\r\n\r\nWe copy the following text from the Vedas:\r\n\r\n\"The Supreme Being alone existed; _afterward there was universal\r\ndarkness;_ next the watery ocean was produced by the diffusion of\r\nvirtue.\"\r\n\r\nWe turn to the legends of the Chinese, and we find the same story:\r\n\r\nTheir annals begin with \"Pwan-ku, or the Reign of Chaos.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Ancient Dynasties of Berosus and China,\" Rev. T. P.\r\nCrawford, D. D., p. 4.]\r\n\r\n{p. 210}\r\n\r\nAnd we are told by the Chinese historians that--\r\n\r\n\"P'an-ku came forth in the midst of the _great chaotic void_, and we\r\nknow not his origin; that he knew the rationale of heaven and earth,\r\nand _comprehended the changes of the Darkness and the Light_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHe \"existed _before the shining of the Light_.\"[2] He was \"the Prince\r\nof Chaos.\"\r\n\r\n\"After the chaos _cleared away_, heaven appeared first in order, then\r\nearth, then after they existed, _and the atmosphere had changed its\r\ncharacter, man came forth_.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThat is to say, P'an-ku lived through the Age of Darkness, during a\r\nchaotic period, and while the atmosphere was pestilential with the\r\ngases of the comet. Where did he live? The Chinese annals tell us:\r\n\r\n\"In the age after the chaos, when heaven and earth had _just\r\nseparated_.\"\r\n\r\nThat is, when the great mass of cloud had just lifted from the earth:\r\n\r\n\"Records had not yet been established or inscriptions invented. At\r\nfirst even the rulers _dwelt in caves_ and desert places, eating raw\r\nflesh and drinking blood. At this fortunate juncture Pan-ku-sze _came\r\nforth_, and from that time heaven and earth began to be heaven and\r\nearth, men and things to be men and things, and so the chaotic state\r\npassed away.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThis is the rejuvenation of the world told of in so many legends.\r\n\r\nAnd these annals tell us further of the \"Ten Stems,\" being the stages\r\nof the earth's primeval history.\r\n\r\n\"At _Wu_--the Sixth Stem--the Darkness and the Light unite _with\r\ninjurious effects_--all things become _solid_,\" (frozen?), \"_and the\r\nDarkness destroys the growth of all things_.\r\n\r\n[1.

In the 8th--_Hëen-hia_--all things\r\nharmonize, and the present order of things is established; that is to\r\nsay, the effects of the catastrophe have largely passed away.[2]\r\n\r\nThe kings who governed before the Drift were called the Rulers of\r\nheaven and earth; those who came after were the Rulers of man.\r\n\r\n\"_Cheu Ching-huen_ says: 'The Rulers of man succeeded to the Rulers\r\nof heaven and the Rulers of earth in the government; that then _the\r\natmosphere gradually cleared away_, and all things sprang up\r\ntogether; that the order of time was gradually settled, and the\r\nusages of society gradually became correct and respectful.\"[3]\r\n\r\nAnd then we read that \"the day and night had not yet been divided,\"\r\nbut, after a time, \"day and night were distinguished from each\r\nother.\"[4]\r\n\r\nHere we have the history of some event which changed\r\n\r\n[1. \"Compendium of Wong-shi-Shing 1526-1590,\" Crawford, pp. 4, 5.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 8.\r\n\r\n3. Ibid.\r\n\r\n4. Ibid., p. 7.]\r\n\r\n{p. 212}\r\n\r\nthe dynasties of the world: the heavenly kingdom was succeeded by a\r\nmerely human one; there were chaos, cold, and darkness, and death to\r\nvegetation; then the light increases, and vegetation begins once more\r\nto germinate; the atmosphere is thick; the heavens rest on the earth;\r\nday and night can not be distinguished from one another, and mankind\r\ndwell in caves, and live on raw meat and blood.\r\n\r\nSurely all this accords wonderfully with our theory.\r\n\r\nAnd here we have the same story in another form:\r\n\r\n\"The philosopher of Oraibi tells us that when the people ascended by\r\nmeans of the magical tree, which constituted the ladder from the\r\nlower world to this, they found the firmament, _the ceiling of this\r\nworld, low down upon the earth_--the floor of this world.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, when the people climbed up, from the cave in which\r\nthey were bidden, to the surface of the earth, the dense clouds\r\nrested on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Machito, one of their gods, raised the firmament on his shoulders to\r\nwhere it is now seen. _Still the world was dark, as there was no sun,\r\nno moon, and no stars_. So the people murmured because of the\r\ndarkness and the cold. Machito said, 'Bring me seven maidens'; and\r\nthey brought him seven maidens; and he said, 'Bring me seven baskets\r\nof cotton-bolls'; and they brought him seven baskets of cotton-bolls;\r\nand he taught the seven maidens to weave a magical fabric from the\r\ncotton, and when they had finished it he held it aloft, and the\r\nbreeze carried it away toward the firmament, and in the twinkling of\r\nan eye it was transformed into a beautiful and full-orbed moon; and\r\nthe same breeze caught the remnants of flocculent cotton, which the\r\nmaidens had scattered during their work, and carried them aloft, and\r\nthey were transformed into bright stars. But _still it was cold;_ and\r\nthe people murmured again, and Machito said, 'Bring me seven\r\nbuffalo-robes'; and they brought him seven buffalo-robes, and from\r\nthe densely matted hair of the robes he wove another wonderful\r\nfabric, which the storm carried\r\n\r\n{p. 213}\r\n\r\naway into the sky, and it was transformed into the full-orbed sun.\r\nThen Machito appointed times and seasons, and ways for the heavenly\r\nbodies; and the gods of the firmament have obeyed the injunctions of\r\nMachito from the day of their creation to the present.\" *\r\n\r\nAmong the Thlinkeets of British Columbia there is a legend that the\r\nGreat Crow or Raven, Yehl, was the creator of most things:\r\n\r\n\"_Very dark, damp, and chaotic_ was the world in the beginning;\r\nnothing with breath or body moved there except Yehl; in the likeness\r\nof _a raven he brooded over the mist; his black winds beat down the\r\nvast confusion; the waters went back before him and the dry land\r\nappeared_. The Thlinkeets were placed on the earth--though how or\r\nwhen does not exactly appear--while the world was _still in darkness,\r\nand without sun, moon, or stars_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe legend proceeds at considerable length to tell the doings of\r\nYehl. His uncle tried to slay him, and, when he failed, \"he\r\nimprecated with a potent curse a deluge upon all the earth. . . . The\r\nflood came, the waters rose and rose; but Yehl clothed himself in his\r\nbird-skin, and soared up to the heavens, where he stuck his beak into\r\na cloud, and remained until the waters were assuaged.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThis tradition reminds us of the legend of the Thessalian Cerambos,\r\n\"who escaped the flood by rising into the air on wings, given him by\r\nthe nymphs.\"\r\n\r\nI turn now to the traditions of the Miztecs, who dwelt on the\r\noutskirts of the Mexican Empire; this legend was taken by Fray\r\nGregoria Garcia[4] from a book found in a convent in Cuilapa, a\r\nlittle Indian town, about a league and a half south of Oajaca; the\r\nbook had been compiled by the vicar of the convent, \"just as they\r\n\r\n[1. \"Popular Science Monthly,\" October, 1879, p. 800.\r\n\r\n2.

There appeared also a\r\nvery beautiful goddess called the Deer, and surnamed the Tiger-snake.\r\nThese two gods were the origin and beginning of all the gods.\"\r\n\r\nThis lion-snake was probably one of the comets; the tiger-snake was\r\ndoubtless a second comet, called after the tiger, on account of its\r\nvariegated, mottled appearance. It will be observed they appeared\r\n_before_ the light had returned,\r\n\r\nThese gods built a temple on a high place, and laid out a garden, and\r\nwaited patiently, offering sacrifices to the higher gods, wounding\r\nthemselves with _flint_ knives, and \"praying that it might seem good\r\nto them to shape the firmament, and _lighten the darkness_ of the\r\nworld, and to establish the foundation of the earth; or, rather, to\r\ngather the waters together so that the earth might appear--as they\r\nhad no place to rest in save only one little garden.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the snakes and the people confounded together. The earth\r\nwas afterward made fit for the use of mankind, and at a later date\r\nthere came--\r\n\r\n\"A great deluge, wherein perished many of the sons and daughters that\r\nhad been born to the gods; and it is said that, when the deluge was\r\npassed, the human race\r\n\r\n{p. 215}\r\n\r\nwas restored, as at the first, and the Miztec kingdom populated, and\r\nthe heavens and the earth established.\"[1]\r\n\r\nFather Duran, in his MS. \"History Antique of New Spain,\" written in\r\nA. D. 1585, gives the Cholula legend, which commences:\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning, _before the light of the sun_ had been created,\r\nthis land was _in obscurity and darkness_ and void of any created\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Toltec legends we read of a time when--\r\n\r\n\"There was a tremendous hurricane that carried away trees, mounds,\r\nhouses, and the largest edifices, notwithstanding which many men and\r\nwomen escaped, _principally in caves_, and places where the great\r\nhurricane could not reach them. A few days having passed, they set\r\nout to see what had become of the earth, when they found it all\r\npopulated with monkeys. All this time they were in darkness, _without\r\nseeing the light of the sun, nor the moon, that the wind had brought\r\nthem_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIn the Aztec creation-myths, according to the accounts furnished by\r\nMendieta, and derived from Fray Andres de Olmos, one of the earliest\r\nof the Christian missionaries among the Mexicans, we have the\r\nfollowing legend of the \"Return of the Sun\":\r\n\r\n\"_Now, there had been no sun in existence for many years;_ so the\r\ngods being assembled in a place called Teotihuacan, six leagues from\r\nMexico, and gathered at the time _around a great fire_, told their\r\ndevotees that he of them who should first cast himself into that,\r\nfire should have the honor of being transformed into a sun. So, one\r\nof them, called Nanahuatzin . . . flung himself into the fire. Then\r\nthe gods\" (the chiefs?) \"began to peer through the gloom in all\r\ndirections _for the expected light_, and to make bets as to what part\r\nof heaven. he should\r\n\r\n[1.

Some said 'Here,' and some said 'There'; but when\r\nthe sun rose they were all proved wrong, for not one of them had\r\nfixed upon the east.\"\r\n\r\nIn the long-continued darkness they had lost all knowledge of the\r\ncardinal points. The ancient landmarks, too, were changed.\r\n\r\nThe \"Popul Vuh,\" the national book of the Quiches, tells us of four\r\nages of the world. The man of the first age was made of clay; he was\r\n\"strengthless, inept, watery; he could not move his head, his face\r\nlooked but one way; his sight was restricted, he could not look\r\nbehind him,\" that is, he had no knowledge of the past; \"he had been\r\nendowed with language, but he had no intelligence, so he was consumed\r\nin the water.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThen followed a higher race of men; they filled the world with their\r\nprogeny; they had intelligence, but _no moral sense_\"; \"they forgot\r\nthe Heart of Heaven.\" They were _destroyed by fire and pitch from\r\nheaven_, accompanied by tremendous earthquakes, from which only a few\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nThen followed a period _when all was dark_, save the white light \"of\r\nthe morning-star--sole light as yet of the primeval world\"--probably\r\na volcano.\r\n\r\n\"Once more are the gods in council, _in the darkness, in the night of\r\na desolated universe_.\"\r\n\r\nThen the people prayed to God for light, evidently for the return of\r\nthe sun:\r\n\r\n\"'Hail! O Creator they cried, 'O Former! Thou that hearest and\r\nunderstandest us! abandon us not! forsake us not! O God, thou that\r\nart in heaven and on earth; O Heart of Heaven I O Heart of Earth!\r\n_give us descendants, and a posterity as long as the light endure_.'\"\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nIn other words, let not the human race cease to be.\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 46.]\r\n\r\n{p. 217}\r\n\r\n\"It was thus they spake, living tranquilly, _invoking the return of\r\nthe light; waiting the rising of the sun;_ watching the star of the\r\nmorning, precursor of the sun. But no sun came, and the four men and\r\ntheir descendants grew uneasy. 'We have no person to watch over us,'\r\nthey said; 'nothing to guard our symbols!' Then they adopted gods of\r\ntheir own, and waited. They kindled fires, _for the climate was\r\ncolder;_ then there fell _great rains and hail-storms,_ and put out\r\ntheir fires. Several times they made fires, and several times the\r\nrains and storms extinguished them. Many other trials also they\r\nunderwent in Tulan, famines and such things, and _a general dampness\r\nand cold_--for the earth was _moist, there being yet no sun_.\"\r\n\r\nAll this accords with what I have shown we might expect as\r\naccompanying the close of the so-called Glacial Age. Dense clouds\r\ncovered the sky, shutting out the light of the sun; perpetual rains\r\nand storms fell; the world was cold and damp, muddy and miserable;\r\nthe people were wanderers, despairing and hungry. They seem to have\r\ncome from an eastern land. We are told:\r\n\r\n\"Tulan was a much colder climate than the happy eastern land they had\r\nleft.\"\r\n\r\nMany generations seem to have grown up and perished under the sunless\r\nskies, \"waiting for the return of the light\"; for the \"Popul Vuh\"\r\ntells us that \"here also the language of all the families was\r\nconfused, so that no one of the first four men could any longer\r\nunderstand the speech of the others.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, separation and isolation into rude tribes had made\r\ntheir tongues unintelligible to one another.\r\n\r\nThis shows that many, many years--it may be centuries--must have\r\nelapsed before that vast volume of moisture, carried up by\r\nevaporation, was able to fall\r\n\r\n{p. 218}\r\n\r\nback, in snow and rain to the land and sea, and allow the sun to\r\nshine through \"the blanket of the dark.\" Starvation encountered the\r\nscattered fragments of mankind.\r\n\r\nAnd in these same Quiche legends of Central America we are told:\r\n\r\n\"The persons of the godhead were enveloped in the _darkness which\r\nenshrouded a desolated world_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThey counseled together, and created four men of white and yellow\r\nmaize (the white and yellow races?). It was _still dark;_ for they\r\nhad no light but the light of the morning-star. They came to Tulan.\r\n\r\nAnd the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg gives further details of the\r\nQuiche legends:\r\n\r\nNow, behold our ancients and our fathers were made lords, and _had\r\ntheir dawn_. Behold we will relate also the rising of the sun, the\r\nmoon, and the stars! Great was their joy when they saw the\r\nmorning-star, which came out first, with its resplendent face before\r\nthe sun. _At last_ the sun itself began to come forth; the animals,\r\nsmall and great, were in joy; they rose from the water-courses and\r\nravines, and stood on the mountain-tops, with their heads toward\r\nwhere the sun was coming. An innumerable crowd of people were there,\r\nand the dawn cast light on all these people at once. At last _the\r\nface of the ground was dried by the sun:_ like a man the sun showed\r\nhimself, and his presence warmed and dried the surface of the ground.\r\nBefore the sun appeared, _muddy and wet_ was the surface of the\r\nground, and it was before the sun appeared, and then only the sun\r\nrose like a man. _But his heat had no strength_, and he _did but show\r\nwhen he rose;_ he only remained like\" (an image in) \"a mirror and it\r\nis not, indeed, the same sun that appears now, they say, in the\r\nstories.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[1. \"North Americans of Antiquity,\" p. 214.\r\n\r\n2. Tylor's \"Early History of Mankind,\" p. 308.]\r\n\r\n{p. 219}\r\n\r\nHow wonderfully does all this accord with what we have shown would\r\nfollow from the earth's contact with a comet!\r\n\r\nThe earth is wet and covered with mud, the clay; the sun is long\r\nabsent; at last he returns; he dries the mud, but his face is still\r\ncovered with the remnants of the great cloud-belt; \"his heat has no\r\nstrength\"; he shows himself only in glimpses; he shines through the\r\nfogs like an image in a mirror; he is not like the great blazing orb\r\nwe see now.\r\n\r\nBut the sun, when it did appear in all its glory, must have been a\r\nterrible yet welcome sight to those who had not looked upon him for\r\nmany years. We read in the legends of the Thlinkeets of British\r\nColumbia, after narrating that the world was once \"dark, damp, and\r\nchaotic,\" full of water, with no sun, moon, or stars, how these\r\nluminaries were restored. The great hero-god of the race, Yehl, got\r\nhold of three mysterious boxes, and, wrenching the lids off, let out\r\nthe sun, moon, and stars.\r\n\r\n\"When he set up the blazing light\" (of the sun) \"in heaven, the\r\npeople that saw it were at first afraid. Many hid themselves in the\r\nmountains, and in the forests, and even in the water, and were\r\nchanged into the various kinds of animals that frequent these\r\nplaces.\"[1]\r\n\r\nSays James Geikie:\r\n\r\n\"Nor can we form any proper conception of how long a time was needed\r\nto bring about that other change of climate, under the influence of\r\nwhich, slowly and imperceptibly, this immense sheet of frost melted\r\naway from the lowlands and retired to the mountain recesses. We must\r\nallow that long ages elapsed before the warmth became such as to\r\ninduce plants and animals to clothe and people the land. How vast a\r\ntime, also, must have passed away ere the warmth reached its\r\nclimax!\"[2]\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 100.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 184.]\r\n\r\n{p. 220}\r\n\r\nAnd all this time the rain fell. There could be no return of the sun\r\nuntil all the mass of moisture sucked up by the comet's heat had been\r\ncondensed into water, and falling on the earth had found its way back\r\nto the ocean; and this process had to be repeated many times. It was\r\nthe age of the great primeval rain.\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                          THE PRIMEVAL STORM.\r\n\r\nIn the Andes, Humboldt tells us of a somewhat similar state of facts:\r\n\r\n\"A thick mist during a particular season obscures the firmament for\r\nmany months. Not a planet, not the most brilliant stars of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere--Canopus, the\r\n\r\n{p. 221}\r\n\r\nSouthern Cross, nor the feet of Centaur--are visible. It is\r\nfrequently almost impossible to discover the position of the moon. If\r\nby chance the outlines of the sun's disk be visible during the day,\r\nit appears devoid of rays.\"\r\n\r\nSays Croll:\r\n\r\n\"We have seen that the accumulation of snow and ice on the ground,\r\nresulting from the long and cold winters, tended to cool the air and\r\nproduce fogs, which cut off the sun's rays.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe same writer says:\r\n\r\n\"Snow and ice lower the temperature by chilling the air and\r\ncondensing the rays into thick fogs. The great strength of the sun's\r\nrays during summer, due to his nearness at that season, would, in the\r\nfirst place, tend to produce an increased amount of evaporation. But\r\nthe presence of snow-clad mountains and an icy sea would chill the\r\natmosphere and condense the vapors into thick fogs. The thick fogs\r\nand cloudy sky would effectually prevent the sun's rays from reaching\r\nthe earth, and the snow, in consequence, would remain unmelted during\r\nthe entire summer. In fact, we have this very condition of things\r\nexemplified in some of the islands of the Southern Ocean at the\r\npresent day. Sandwich Land, which is in the same parallel of latitude\r\nas the north of Scotland, is covered with ice and snow the entire\r\nsummer; and in the Island of South Georgia, which is in the same\r\nparallel as the center of England, the perpetual snow descends to the\r\nvery sea-beach. The following is Captain Cook's description of this\r\ndismal place: 'We thought it very extraordinary,' he says, 'that an\r\nisland between the latitudes of 54° and 55° should, in the very\r\nheight of summer, be almost wholly covered with frozen snow, in some\r\nplaces many fathoms deep. . . . The head of the bay was terminated by\r\nice-cliffs of considerable height, pieces of which were continually\r\nbreaking off, which made a noise like cannon. Nor were the interior\r\nparts of the country less horrible. The savage rocks raised their\r\nlofty summits\r\n\r\n[1. \"Climate and Time,\" p. 75.]\r\n\r\n{p. 222}\r\n\r\ntill lost in the clouds, and valleys were covered with seemingly\r\nperpetual snow. Not a tree nor a shrub of any size was to be seen.'\"\r\n\r\nI return to the legends.\r\n\r\nThe Gallinomeros of Central California also recollect the day of\r\ndarkness and the return of the sun:\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning they say there was _no light, but a thick darkness\r\ncovered all the earth_. Man stumbled blindly against man and against\r\nthe animals, the birds clashed together in the air, and confusion\r\nreigned everywhere. The Hawk happening by chance to fly into the face\r\nof the Coyote, there followed mutual apologies, and afterward a long\r\ndiscussion on the emergency of the situation. Determined to make some\r\neffort toward abating the public evil, the two set about a remedy.\r\nThe Coyote gathered a great heap, of tules\" (rushes) \"rolled them\r\ninto a ball, and gave it to the Hawk, together with some pieces of\r\nflint. Gathering all together as well as he could, the Hawk flew\r\nstraight up into the sky, where he struck fire with the flints, lit\r\nhis ball of reeds, and left it there whirling along all in a fierce\r\nred glow as it continues to the present; for it is the sun. In the\r\nsame way the moon was made, but as the tules of which it was\r\nconstructed were rather damp, its light has always been somewhat\r\nuncertain and feeble.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe Algonquins believed in a world, an earth, \"anterior to this of\r\nours, but one _without light or human inhabitants_. A lake burst its\r\nbounds and submerged it wholly.\"\r\n\r\nThis reminds us of the Welsh legend, and the bursting of the lake\r\nLlion (see page 135, _ante_).\r\n\r\nThe ancient world was united in believing in great cycles of time\r\nterminating in terrible catastrophes:\r\n\r\n[1. Captain Cook's \"Second Voyage,\" vol. ii, pp. 232-235;\r\n\r\n2. \"Climate and Time,\" Croll, pp. 60, 61.\r\n\r\n3. Powers's Pomo MS., Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 86.]\r\n\r\n{p. 223}\r\n\r\nHence arose the belief in Epochs of Nature, elaborated by ancient\r\nphilosophers into the Cycles of the Stoics, the great Days of Brahm,\r\nlong periods of time rounding off by sweeping destructions, the\r\nCataclysms and Ekpyrauses of the universe. Some thought in these all\r\nthings perished, others that a few survived. . . . For instance,\r\nEpietetus favors the opinion that at the solstices of the great year\r\nnot only all human beings, but even the gods, are annihilated; and\r\nspeculates whether at such times Jove feels lonely.[1] Macrobius, so\r\nfar from agreeing with him, explains the great antiquity of Egyptian\r\ncivilization by the hypothesis that that country is so happily\r\nsituated between the pole and the equator, as to escape both the\r\ndeluge and conflagration of the great cycle.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIn the Babylonian Genesis tablets we have the same references to the\r\nman or people who, after the great disaster, divided the heavens into\r\nconstellations, and regulated, that is, discovered and revealed,\r\ntheir movements. In the Fifth Tablet of the Creation Legend[3] we\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\"1. It was delightful all that was fixed by the great gods.\r\n\r\n2. Stars, their appearance (in figures) of animals he arranged.\r\n\r\n3. To fix the year through the observation of their constellations,\r\n\r\n4. Twelve months or signs of stars in three rows he arranged,\r\n\r\n5. From the day when the year commences unto the close.\r\n\r\n6. He marked the positions of the wandering stars to shine in their\r\ncourses,\r\n\r\n7. That they may not do injury, and may not trouble any one.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the civilized race that followed the great cataclysm,\r\nwith whom the history of the event was\r\n\r\n[1. Discourses,\" book iii, chapter xiii.\r\n\r\n2. Brinton's Myths of the New World,\" p. 215.\r\n\r\n3. Proctor's Pleasant Ways,\" p. 393.]\r\n\r\n{p. 224}\r\n\r\nyet fresh, and who were impressed with all its horrors, and who knew\r\nwell the tenure of danger and terror on which they held all the\r\nblessings of the world, turned their attention to the study of the\r\nheavenly bodies, and sought to understand the source of the calamity\r\nwhich had so recently overwhelmed the world. Hence they \"marked,\" as\r\nfar as they were able, \"the positions of the 'comets,'\" \"that they\r\nmight not\" again \"do injury, and not trouble any one.\" The word here\r\ngiven is _Nibir_, which Mr. Smith says does not mean planets, and, in\r\nthe above account, _Nibir_ is contradistinguished from the stars;\r\nthey have already been arranged in constellations; hence it can only\r\nmean comets.\r\n\r\nAnd the tablet proceeds, with distinct references to the Age of\r\nDarkness:\r\n\r\n\"8. The positions of the gods Bel and Hea he fixed with him,\r\n\r\n9. And _he opened the great gates in the darkness shrouded_.\r\n\r\n10. The fastenings were strong on the left and right.\r\n\r\n11. In its mass, (i. e., the lower chaos,) he made a _boiling_.\r\n\r\n12. The god Uru (the moon) _he caused to rise out_, the _night he\r\novershadowed_,\r\n\r\n13. To fix it also for the light of the night until the shining of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n14. That the month might not be broken, and in its amount be regular,\r\n\r\n15. At the beginning of the month, at the rising of the night,\r\n\r\n16. His (the sun's) horns are breaking through to shine on the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\n17. On the seventh day _to a circle he begins to swell_,\r\n\r\n18. And stretches _toward the dawn further_,\r\n\r\n19. When the god Shamas, (the in the horizon of heaven, in the east,\r\n\r\n20 . . . . formed beautifully and . . .\r\n\r\n21 . . . . to the orbit Shamas was perfected.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 225}\r\n\r\nHere the tablet becomes illegible. The meaning, however, seems plain:\r\n\r\nAlthough to left and right, to east and west, the darkness was\r\nfastened firm, was dense, yet \"the great gods opened the great gates\r\nin the darkness,\" and let the light through. First, the moon\r\nappeared, through a \"boiling,\" or breaking up of the clouds, so that\r\nnow men were able to once more count time by the movements of the\r\nmoon. On the seventh day, Shamas, the sun, appeared; first, his\r\nhorns, his beams, broke through the darkness imperfectly; then he\r\nswells to a circle, and comes nearer and nearer to perfect dawn; at\r\nlast he appeared on the horizon, in the east, formed beautifully, and\r\nhis orbit was perfected; i. e., his orbit could be traced\r\ncontinuously through the clearing heavens.\r\n\r\nBut how did the human race fare in this miserable time?\r\n\r\nIn his magnificent poem \"Darkness,\" Byron has imagined such a blind\r\nand darkling world as these legends depict; and he has imagined, too,\r\nthe hunger, and the desolation, and the degradation of the time.\r\n\r\nWe are not to despise the imagination. There never was yet a great\r\nthought that had not wings to it; there never was yet a great mind\r\nthat did not survey things from above the mountain-tops.\r\n\r\nIf Bacon built the causeway over which modern science has advanced,\r\nit was because, mounting on the pinions of his magnificent\r\nimagination, he saw that poor struggling mankind needed such a\r\npathway; his heart embraced humanity even as his brain embraced the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nThe river which is a boundary to the rabbit, is but a landmark to the\r\neagle. Let not the gnawers of the world, the rodentia, despise the\r\nwinged creatures of the upper air.\r\n\r\n{p. 226}\r\n\r\nByron saw what the effects of the absence of the sunlight would\r\nnecessarily be upon the world, and that which he prefigured the\r\nlegends of mankind tell us actually came to pass, in the dark days\r\nthat followed the Drift.\r\n\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n     \"Morn came, and went--and came, and brought no day,\r\n     And men forgot their passions in the dread\r\n     Of this their desolation, and all hearts\r\n     Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light. . . .\r\n     A fearful hope was all the world contained;\r\n     Forests were set on fire--but hour by hour\r\n     They fell and faded,--and the crackling trunks\r\n     Extinguished with a crash,--and all was black.\r\n     The brows of men by the despairing light\r\n     Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits\r\n     The flashes fell upon them; some lay down\r\n     And bid their eyes and wept; and some did rest\r\n     Their chins upon their clinchèd hands and smiled;\r\n     And others hurried to and fro, and fed\r\n     Their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up\r\n     With mad disquietude on the dull sky,\r\n     The pall of a past world; and then again\r\n     With curses cast them down upon the dust,\r\n     And gnashed their teeth and howled. . . .\r\n     And War, which for a moment was no more,\r\n     Did glut himself again--a meal was bought\r\n     With blood, and each sat sullenly apart,\r\n     Gorging himself in gloom, . . . and the pang\r\n     Of famine fed upon all entrails;--men\r\n     Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh\r\n     The meager by the meager were devoured,\r\n     Even dogs assailed their masters.\"\r\n\r\nHow graphic, how dramatic, how realistic is this picture! And how\r\ntrue!\r\n\r\nFor the legends show us that when, at last, the stones and clay had\r\nceased to fall, and the fire had exhausted itself, and the remnant of\r\nmankind were able to dig their way out, to what an awful wreck of\r\nnature did they return.\r\n\r\n{p . 227}\r\n\r\nInstead of the fair face of the world, as they had known it, bright\r\nwith sunlight, green with the magnificent foliage of the forest, or\r\nthe gentle verdure of the plain, they go forth upon a wasted, an\r\nunknown land, covered with oceans of mud and stones; the very face of\r\nthe country changed--lakes, rivers, hills, all swept away and lost.\r\nThey wander, breathing a foul and sickening atmosphere, under the\r\nshadow of an awful darkness, a darkness which knows no morning, no\r\nstars, no moon; a darkness palpable and visible, lighted only by\r\nelectrical discharges from the abyss of clouds, with such roars of\r\nthunder as we, in this day of harmonious nature, can form no\r\nconception of. It is, indeed, \"chaos and ancient night.\" All the\r\nforces of nature are there, but disorderly, destructive, battling\r\nagainst each other, and multiplied a thousand-fold in power; the\r\nwinds are cyclones, magnetism is gigantic, electricity is appalling.\r\n\r\nThe world is more desolate than the caves from which they have\r\nescaped. The forests are gone; the fruit-trees are swept away; the\r\nbeasts of the chase have perished; the domestic animals, gentle\r\nministers to man, have disappeared; the cultivated fields are buried\r\ndeep in drifts of mud and gravel; the people stagger in the darkness\r\nagainst each other; they fall into the chasms of the earth; within\r\nthem are the two great oppressors of humanity, hunger and terror;\r\nhunger that knows not where to turn; fear that shrinks before the\r\nwhirling blasts, the rolling thunder, the shocks of blinding\r\nlightning; that knows not what moment the heavens may again open and\r\nrain fire and stones and dust upon them.\r\n\r\nGod has withdrawn his face; his children are deserted; all the,\r\nkindly adjustments of generous Nature are gone. God has left man in\r\nthe midst of a material world without law; he is a wreck, a fragment,\r\na lost particle,\r\n\r\n{p. 228}\r\n\r\nin the midst of an illimitable and endless warfare of giants.\r\n\r\nSome lie down to die, hopeless, cursing their helpless gods; some die\r\nby their own bands; some gather around the fires of volcanoes for\r\nwarmth and light--stars that attract them from afar off; some feast\r\non such decaying remnants of the great animals as they may find\r\nprojecting above the _débris_, running to them, as we shall see, with\r\noutcries, and fighting over the fragments.\r\n\r\nThe references to the worship of \"the morning star,\" which occur in\r\nthe legend, seem to relate to some great volcano in the East, which\r\nalone gave light when all the world was lost in darkness. As Byron\r\nsays, in his great poem, \"Darkness\":\r\n\r\n     And they did live by watch-fires--and the thrones,\r\n     The palaces of crownèd kings--the huts,\r\n     The habitations of all things which dwell,\r\n     Were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed,\r\n     And men were gathered round their blazing homes\r\n     To look once more into each other's face;\r\n     Happy were they _who dwelt within the eye\r\n     Of the volcanoes and their mountain-torch_.\"\r\n\r\nIn this pitiable state were once the ancestors of all mankind.\r\n\r\nIf you doubt it, reader, peruse again the foregoing legends, and then\r\nturn to the following Central American prayer, the prayer of the\r\nAztecs, already referred to on page 186, _ante_, addressed to the god\r\nTezcatlipoca, himself represented as a flying or winged serpent,\r\nperchance the comet:\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that this lash and chastisement are not given for our\r\ncorrection and amendment, but only for our total destruction and\r\noverthrow; that _the sun will never more shine upon us, but that we\r\nmust remain in perpetual darkness?_ . . . It is a sore thing to tell\r\nhow we are all in\r\n\r\n{p. 229}\r\n\r\ndarkness. . . . O Lord, . . . make an end of _this smoke and fog_.\r\nQuench also the _burning and destroying fire of thine anger_; let\r\nserenity come and _clearness_,\" (light); \"let the small birds of thy\r\npeople begin to sing and _approach the sun_.\"\r\n\r\nThere is still another Aztec prayer, addressed to the same deity,\r\nequally able, sublime, and pathetic, which it seems to me may have\r\nbeen uttered when the people had left their biding-place, when the\r\nconflagration had passed, but while darkness still covered the earth,\r\nbefore vegetation had returned, and while crops of grain as yet were\r\nnot. There are a few words in it that do not answer to this\r\ninterpretation, where it refers to those \"people who have something\";\r\nbut there may have been comparative differences of condition even in\r\nthe universal poverty; or these words may have been an interpolation\r\nof later days. The prayer is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"O our Lord, protector most strong and compassionate, invisible and\r\nimpalpable, thou art the giver of life; lord of all, and lord of\r\nbattles. I present myself here before thee to say some few words\r\nconcerning the need of the poor people of none estate or\r\nintelligence. When they lie down at night they have nothing, nor when\r\nthey rise up in the morning; the darkness and the light pass alike in\r\ngreat poverty. Know, O Lord, that thy subjects and servants suffer a\r\nsore poverty that can not be told of more than that it is a sore\r\npoverty and desolateness. The men have no garments, nor the women, to\r\ncover themselves with, but only certain rags rent in every part, that\r\nallow the air and the cold to pass everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"With great toil and weariness they scrape together enough for each\r\nday, _going by mountain and wilderness seeking their food_; so faint\r\nand enfeebled are they that their bowels cleave to their ribs, and\r\nall their body reechoes with hollowness, and they walk as people\r\naffrighted, the face and body in likeness of death. If they be\r\nmerchants, they now sell only cakes of salt and broken\r\n\r\n{p. 230}\r\n\r\npepper; the people that have something despise their wares, so that\r\nthey go out to sell from door to door, and from house to house; and\r\nwhen they sell nothing they sit down sadly by some fence or wall, or\r\nin some corner, licking their lips and gnawing the nails of their\r\nhands for the hunger that is in them; they look on the one side and\r\non the other at the mouths of those that pass by, hoping peradventure\r\nthat one may speak some word to them.\r\n\r\n\"O compassionate God, the bed on which they lie down is not a thing\r\nto rest upon, but to endure torment in; they draw a rag over them at\r\nnight, and so sleep; there they throw down their bodies, and the\r\nbodies of children that thou hast given them. For the misery that\r\nthey grow up in, for the filth of their food, for the lack of\r\ncovering, their faces are yellow, and all their bodies of the color\r\nof earth. They _tremble with cold_, and for leaness they stagger in\r\nwalking. They go weeping and sighing, and full of sadness, and all\r\nmisfortunes are joined to them; _though they stay by afire, they find\r\nlittle heat_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe prayer continues in the same strain, supplicating God to give the\r\npeople \"some days of prosperity and tranquillity, so that they may\r\nsleep and know repose\"; it concludes:\r\n\r\n\"If thou answerest my petition it will be only of thy liberality and\r\nmagnificence, for no one is worthy to receive thy bounty for any\r\nmerit of his, but only through thy grace. _Search below the\r\ndung-hills_ and in the mountains for thy servants, friends, and\r\nacquaintance, and raise them to riches and dignities.\" . . .\r\n\r\n\"Where am I? Lo, I speak with thee, O King; well do I know that I\r\nstand in an eminent place, and that I talk with one of great majesty,\r\nbefore whose presence flows a river through a chasm, a gulf sheer\r\ndown of awful depth; this, also, is a slippery place, whence many\r\nprecipitate themselves, for there shall not be found one without\r\nerror before thy majesty. I myself, a man of little understanding and\r\nlacking speech, dare to address\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 204.]\r\n\r\n{p. 231}\r\n\r\nmy words to thee; I put myself in peril of falling into the gorge and\r\ncavern of this river. I, Lord, have come to take with my hands,\r\n_blindness to mine eyes_, rottenness and shriveling to my members,\r\npoverty and affliction to my body; for my meanness and rudeness this\r\nit is that I merit to receive. Live and rule for ever in all\r\nquietness and tranquillity, O thou that art our lord, our shelter,\r\nour protector, most compassionate, most pitiful, invisible,\r\nimpalpable.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that much of all this would apply to any great period of\r\nfamine, but it appears that these events occurred when there was\r\ngreat cold in the country, when the people gathered around fires and\r\ncould not get warm, a remarkable state of things in a country\r\npossessing as tropical a climate as Mexico. Moreover, these people\r\nwere wanderers, \"going by mountain and wilderness,\" seeking food, a\r\nwhole nation of poverty-stricken, homeless, wandering paupers. And\r\nwhen we recur to the part where the priest tells the Lord to seek his\r\nfriends and servants in the mountains, \"below the dung-hills,\" and\r\nraise them to riches, it is difficult to understand it otherwise than\r\nas an allusion to those who had been buried under the falling slime,\r\nclay, and stones. Even poor men do not dwell under dung-hills, nor\r\nare they usually buried under them, and it is very possible that in\r\ntransmission from generation to generation the original meaning was\r\nlost sight of. I should understand it to mean, \"Go, O Lord, and\r\nsearch and bring back to life and comfort and wealth the millions\r\nthou hast slaughtered on the mountains, covering them with hills of\r\nslime and refuse.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when we turn to the traditions of the kindred and more ancient\r\nrace, the Toltecs,[1] we find that, after the fall of the fire from\r\nheaven, the people, emerging from the\r\n\r\n[1. \"North Americans of Antiquity,\" p. 240.]\r\n\r\n{p. 232}\r\n\r\nseven caves, wandered _one hundred and four years_, \"suffering from\r\nnakedness, hunger, and cold, over many lands, across expanses of sea,\r\nand through untold hardships,\" precisely as narrated in the foregoing\r\npathetic prayer.\r\n\r\nIt tells of the migration of a race, over the desolated world, during\r\nthe Age of Darkness. And we will find something, hereafter, very much\r\nlike it, in the Book of Job.\r\n\r\n{p. 233}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                        THE TRIUMPH OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nA GREAT solar-myth underlies all the ancient mythologies. It\r\ncommemorates the death and resurrection of the sun. It signifies the\r\ndestruction of the light by the clouds, the darkness, and the\r\neventual return of the great luminary of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Syrian Adonis, the sun-god, the Hebrew Tamheur, and the Assyrian\r\nDu-Zu, all suffered a sudden and violent death, disappeared for a\r\ntime from the sight of men, and were at last raised from the dead.\r\n\r\nThe myth is the primeval form of the resurrection.\r\n\r\nAll through the Gothic legends runs this thought--the battle of the\r\nLight with the Darkness; the temporary death of the Light, and its\r\nfinal triumph over the grave. Sometimes we have but a fragment of the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nIn the Saxon Beowulf we have Grendel, a terrible monster, who comes\r\nto the palace-hall at midnight, and drags out the sleepers and sucks\r\ntheir blood. Beowulf assails him. A ghastly struggle follows in the\r\ndarkness. Grendel is killed. But his fearful mother, the devil's\r\nclam, comes to avenge his death; she attacks Beowulf, and is\r\nslain.[1] There comes a third dragon, which Beowulf kills, but is\r\nstifled with the breath of the monster and dies, rejoicing, however,\r\nthat the dragon has brought with him a great treasure of gold, which\r\nwill make his people rich.[2]\r\n\r\n[1. Poor, \"Sanskrit and Kindred Literatures,\" p. 315.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n{p. 234}\r\n\r\nHere, again, are the three comets, the wolf, the snake, and the dog\r\nof Ragnarok; the three arrows of the American legends; the three\r\nmonsters of Hesiod.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to Egypt we find that their whole religion was\r\nconstructed upon legends relating to the ages of fire and ice, and\r\nthe victory of the sun-god over the evil-one. We find everywhere a\r\nrecollection of the days of cloud, \"when darkness dwelt upon the face\r\nof the deep.\"\r\n\r\nOsiris, their great god, represented the sun in his darkened or\r\nnocturnal or ruined condition, before the coming of day. M.\r\nMariette-Bey says:\r\n\r\n\"Originally, Osiris is the nocturnal sun; he is _the primordial night\r\nof chaos_; he is consequently anterior to Ra, the Sun of Day.\"[1]\r\n\r\nMr. Miller says:\r\n\r\n\"As nocturnal sun, Osiris was also regarded as a type of the sun\r\n_before its first rising_, or of the primordial night of chaos, and\r\nas such, according to M. Mariette, his first rising--his original\r\nbirth to the light under the form of Ra--symbolized the birth of\r\nhumanity itself in the person of the first man.\"[2]\r\n\r\nM. F. Chabas says:\r\n\r\n\"These forms represented the same god at different hours of the day.\r\n. . . the nocturnal sun and the daily sun, which, succeeding to the\r\nfirst, dissipated the darkness on the morning of each day, and\r\nrenewed the triumph of Horus over Set; that is to say, _the cosmical\r\nvictory which determined the first rising of the sun_--the\r\norganization of the universe at the commencement of time. Ra is the\r\ngod who, after _having marked the commencement of time_, continues\r\neach day to govern his work. . . . He succeeds\r\n\r\n[1. \"Musée de Boulaq,\" etc., pp. 20, 21, 100, 101.\r\n\r\n2. Rev. O. D. Miller, \"Solar Symbolism,\" \"American Antiquarian,\"\r\nApril, 1881, p. 219.]\r\n\r\n{p. 235}\r\n\r\nto a primordial form, Osiris, the nocturnal sun, or better, _the sun\r\nbefore its first rising_.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"_The suffering and death of Osiris_,\" says Sir G. Wilkinson, \"_were\r\nthe great mystery of the Egyptian religion_, and some traces of it\r\nare perceptible among other people of antiquity. His being the divine\r\ngoodness, and the abstract idea of good; his _manifestation upon\r\nearth_, his _death_ and _resurrection_, and his office as judge of\r\nthe dead in a future state, look like the early revelation of a\r\nfuture manifestation of the Deity, converted into a mythological\r\nfable.\"[2]\r\n\r\nOsiris--the sun--had a war with Seb, or Typho, or Typhon, and was\r\nkilled in the battle; he was subsequently restored to life, and\r\nbecame the judge of the under-world.[3]\r\n\r\nSeb, his destroyer, was a son of Ra, the ancient sun-god, in the\r\nsense, perhaps, that the comets, and all other planetary bodies, were\r\noriginally thrown out from the mass of the sun. Seb, or Typho, was\r\n\"the personification of all evil.\" He was the destroyer, the enemy,\r\nthe evil-one.\r\n\r\nIsis, the consort of Osiris, learns of his death, slain by the great\r\nserpent, and ransacks the world in search of his body. She finds it\r\nmutilated by Typhon. This is the same mutilation which we find\r\nelsewhere, and which covered the earth with fragments of the sun.\r\n\r\nIsis was the wife of Osiris (the dead sun) and the mother of Horus,\r\nthe new or returned sun; she seems to represent a civilized people;\r\nshe taught the art of cultivating wheat and barley, which were always\r\ncarried in her festal processions.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the Greek legends, we shall find\r\n\r\n[1. \"Revue Archæologique,\" tome xxv, 1873, p. 393.\r\n\r\n2. Notes to Rawlinson's \"Herodotus,\" American edition, vol. ii,\r\np.:219.\r\n\r\n3. Murray's \"Mythology,\" p. 347.]\r\n\r\n{p. 236}\r\n\r\nTyphon described in a manner that clearly identifies him with the\r\ndestroying comet. (See page 140, _ante_.)\r\n\r\nThe entire religion of the Egyptians was based upon a solar-myth, and\r\nreferred to the great catastrophe in the history of the earth when\r\nthe sun was for a time obscured in dense clouds.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the legend of \"the dying sun-god,\" Rev. O. D. Miller says:\r\n\r\n\"The wide prevalence of this legend, and its extreme antiquity, are\r\nfacts familiar to all Orientalists. There was the Egyptian Osiris,\r\nthe Syrian Adonis, the Hebrew Tamheur, the Assyrian _Du-Zu_, all\r\nregarded as solar deities, vet as having lived a mortal life,\r\n_suffered a violent death_, being subsequently _raised from, the\r\ndead_. . . . How was it possible _to conceive the solar orb as dying\r\nand rising from the dead_, if it had not already been taken for a\r\nmortal being, as a type of mortal man? . . . We repeat the\r\nproposition: it was impossible to conceive the sun _as dying and\r\ndescending into hades_ until it had been assumed as a type and\r\nrepresentative of man. . . . The reign of Osiris in Egypt, his war\r\nwith Typhon, his death and resurrection, were events appertaining to\r\nthe divine dynasties. We can only say, then, that the origin of these\r\nsymbolical ideas was _extremely ancient_, without attempting to fix\r\nits chronology.\"\r\n\r\nBut when, we realize the fact that these ancient religions were built\r\nupon the memory of an event which had really happened--an event of\r\nawful significance to the human race--the difficulty which perplexed\r\nMr. Miller and other scholars disappears. The sun had, apparently,\r\nbeen slain by an evil thing; for a long period it returned not, it\r\nwas dead; at length, amid the rejoicings of the world, it arose from\r\nthe dead, and came in glory to rule mankind.\r\n\r\nAnd these events, as I have shown, are perpetuated in the sun-worship\r\nwhich still exists in the world in many\r\n\r\n{p. 237}\r\n\r\nforms. Even the Christian peasant of Europe still lifts his hat to\r\nthe rising sun.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Hindoos was also based on the same great cosmical\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nIndra was the great god, the sun. He has a long and dreadful contest\r\nwith Vritra, \"the throttling snake.\" Indra is \"the cloud-compeller\";\r\nhe \"shatters the cloud with his bolt and releases the imprisoned\r\nwaters\";[1] that is to say, he slays the snake Vritra, the comet, and\r\nthereafter the rain pours down and extinguishes the flames which\r\nconsume the world.\r\n\r\n\"He goes in search of the cattle, the clouds, which the evil powers\r\nhave driven away.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThat is to say, as the great heat disappears, the moisture condenses\r\nand the clouds form. Doubtless mankind remembered vividly that awful\r\nperiod when no cloud appeared in the blazing heavens to intercept the\r\nterrible heat.\r\n\r\n\"He who fixed firm the _moving earth_; who tranquillized _the\r\nincensed mountains_; who spread the spacious firmament; who\r\nconsolidated the heavens--he, men, is Indra.\r\n\r\n\"He who having destroyed Ahi (Vritra, Typhon,) set free the seven\r\nrivers, who, _recovered the cows_, (the clouds,) _detained by Bal_;\r\nwho generated fire in the clouds; who is invincible in battle--he,\r\nmen, is Indra.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the \"Vendidad,\" first chapter, the author gives\r\nan account of the beautiful land, the Aryana Vaejo, which was a land\r\nof delights, created by Ahura Mazda (Ormaz). Then \"an evil being,\r\nAngra-Manyus, (Ahriman,) pill of death, created _a mighty serpent_,\r\nand _winter_, the work of the Devas.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ten months of winter are there_, and two months of summer.\"\r\n\r\n[1. Murray's \"Mythology,\" p. 330.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n{p. 238}\r\n\r\nThen follows this statement:\r\n\r\n\"Seven months of summer are there; five months of winter were there.\r\nThe latter are cold as to water, cold as to earth, cold as to trees.\r\nThere is the heart of winter; then all around _falls deep snow_.\r\nThere is the worst of evils.\"\r\n\r\nThis signifies that once the people dwelled in a fair and pleasant\r\nland. The evil-one sent a mighty serpent; the serpent brought a great\r\nwinter; there were but two months of summer; gradually this\r\nameliorated, until the winter was five months long and the summer\r\nseven months long. The climate is still severe, cold and wet; deep\r\nsnows fell everywhere. It is an evil time.\r\n\r\nThe demonology of the Hindoos turns on the battles between the\r\nAsuras, the irrational demons of the air, the comets, and the gods:\r\n\r\n\"They dwell beneath the three-pronged root of the world-mountain,\r\noccupying the nadir, while their great enemy Indra,\" (the sun;) \"the\r\nhighest Buddhist god, sits upon the pinnacle of the mountain, in the\r\nzenith. The Meru, which stands between the earth and the heavens,\r\naround which the heavenly bodies revolve, is the battlefield of the\r\nAsuras and the Devas.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the land Meru--the same as the island Mero of the\r\nancient Egyptians, from which Egypt was first colonized; the Merou of\r\nthe Greeks, on which the Meropes, the first men, dwelt--was the scene\r\nwhere this battle between the fiends of the air on one side, and the\r\nheavenly bodies and earth on the other, was fought.\r\n\r\nThe Asuras are painted as \"gigantic opponents of the gods, terrible\r\nogres, with bloody tongues and long tusks, eager to devour human\r\nflesh and blood.\"[2]\r\n\r\nAnd we find the same thoughts underlying the myths\r\n\r\n[1. \"American Cyclopædia,\" vol. v, p. 793.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n{p. 239}\r\n\r\nof nations the most remote from these great peoples of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux of Greenland have this myth:\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning were two brothers, one of whom said, 'There shall\r\nbe night and there shall be day, and men shall die, one after\r\nanother.' But the second said, 'There shall be no day, but only night\r\nall the time, and men shall live for ever.' They had a long struggle,\r\nbut here once more he who loved darkness rather than light was\r\nworsted, and the day triumphed.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the same great battle between Light and Darkness. The\r\nDarkness proposes to be perpetual; it says, \"There shall be no more\r\nday.\" After a long struggle the Light triumphed, the sun returned,\r\nand the earth was saved.\r\n\r\nAmong the Tupis of Brazil we have the same story of the battle of\r\nlight and darkness. They have a myth of Timandonar and Ariconte:\r\n\r\n\"They were brothers, one of fair complexion, the other dark. They\r\nwere constantly struggling, and Ariconte, which means _the stormy or\r\ncloudy day_, came out worst.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the myth reappears; this time among the Norsemen:\r\n\r\nBalder, the bright sun, (Baal?) is slain by the god Hodur, the blind\r\none; to wit, the Darkness. But Vali, Odin's son, slew Hodur, the\r\nDarkness, and avenged Balder. Vali is the son of Rind--the rind--the\r\nfrozen earth. That is to say, Darkness devours the sun; frost rules\r\nthe earth; Vali, the new sun, is born of the frost, and kills the\r\nDarkness. It is light again. Balder returns after Ragnarok.\r\n\r\nAnd Nana, Balder's wife, the lovely spring-time, died of grief during\r\nBalder's absence.\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 200.]\r\n\r\n{p. 240}\r\n\r\nWe have seen that one of the great events of the Egyptian mythology\r\nwas the search made by Isis, the wife of Osiris, for the dead sun-god\r\nin the dark nether world. In the same way, the search for the dead\r\nBalder was an important part of the Norse myths. Hermod, mounted on\r\nOdin's horse, Sleifner, the slippery-one, (the ice?) set out to find\r\nBalder. He rode nine days and nine nights through deep valleys, _so\r\ndark that he could see nothing_;[1] at last he reaches the barred\r\ngates of Hel's (death's) dominions. There he found Balder, seated on\r\na throne: he told Hel that all things in the world were grieving for\r\nthe absence of Balder, the sun. At last, after some delays and\r\nobstructions, Balder returns, and the whole world rejoices.\r\n\r\nAnd what more is needed to prove the original unity of the human\r\nrace, and the vast antiquity of these legends, than the fact that we\r\nfind the same story, and almost the same names, occurring among the\r\nwhite-haired races of Arctic Europe, and the dark-skinned people of\r\nEgypt, Ph&oelig;nicia, and India. The demon Set, or Seb, of one,\r\ncomes to us as the Surt of another; the Baal of one is the Balder of\r\nanother; Isis finds Osiris ruling the underworld as Hermod found\r\nBalder on a throne in Hel, the realm of death.\r\n\r\nThe celebration of the May-day, with its ceremonies, the May-pole,\r\nits May-queen, etc., is a survival of the primeval thanksgiving with\r\nwhich afflicted mankind welcomed the return of the sun from his long\r\nsleep of death. In Norway,[2] during the middle ages, the whole scene\r\nwas represented in these May-day festivals: One man represents\r\nsummer, he is clad in green leaves the other represents winter; he is\r\nclad in straw, fit picture of the\r\n\r\n[1. \"Nome Mythology,\" p. 288.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 291.]\r\n\r\n{p. 241}\r\n\r\nmisery of the Drift Age. They have each a large company of attendants\r\narmed with staves; they fight with each other until winter (the age\r\nof darkness and cold) is subdued. They pretend to pluck his eyes out\r\nand throw him in the water. Winter is slain.\r\n\r\nHere we have the victory of Osiris over Seb; of Adonis over Typhon,\r\nof Balder over Hodur, of Indra over Vritra, of Timandonar over\r\nAriconte, brought down to almost our own time. To a late period, in\r\nEngland, the rejoicing over the great event survived.\r\n\r\nSays Horatio Smith:\r\n\r\n\"It was the custom, both here and in Italy, for the youth of both\r\nsexes to proceed before daybreak to some neighboring wood,\r\naccompanied with music and horns, about sunrise to deck their doors\r\nand windows with garlands, and to spend the afternoon dancing around\r\nthe May-pole.\"\r\n\r\nStow tells us, in his \"Survey of London\":\r\n\r\n\"Every man would walk into the sweet meddowes and green woods, there\r\nto rejoice their spirits with the beauty and savour of sweet flowers,\r\nand with the harmony of birds praising God in their kindes.\"[2]\r\n\r\nStubbs, a Puritan of Queen Elizabeth's days, describing the May-day\r\nfeasts, says:\r\n\r\n\"And then they fall to banquet and feast, to leape and dance about\r\nit,\" (the May-pole), \"as the heathen people did at the dedication of\r\ntheir idolles, whereof this is a perfect picture, or rather the thing\r\nitself.\"[3]\r\n\r\nStubbs was right: the people of England in the year 1550 A. D., and\r\nfor years afterward, were celebrating the end of the Drift Age, the\r\ndisappearance of the darkness and the victory of the sun.\r\n\r\n[1. \"Festivals, Games,\" etc., p. 126.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 127.\r\n\r\n3. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n{p. 242}\r\n\r\nThe myth of Hercules recovering his cows from Cacus is the same story\r\ntold in another form:\r\n\r\nA strange monster, Cacus, (the comet,) stole the cows of Hercules,\r\n(the clouds,) and dragged them backward by their tails into a cave,\r\nand vomited smoke and flame when Hercules attacked him. But Hercules\r\nkilled Cacus with his unerring arrows, and released the cows.\r\n\r\nThis signifies that the comet, breathing fire and smoke, so rarefied\r\nthe air that the clouds disappeared and there followed an age of\r\nawful heat. Hercules smites the monster with his lightnings, and\r\nelectrical phenomena on a vast scale accompany the recondensation of\r\nthe moisture and the return of the clouds.\r\n\r\n\"Cacus is the same as Vritra in Sanskrit, Azbidihaka in Zend, Python\r\nin Greek, and the worm Fafnir in Norse.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe cows everywhere are the clouds; they are white and soft; they\r\nmove in herds across the fields of heaven; they give down their milk\r\nin grateful rains and showers to refresh the thirsty earth.\r\n\r\nWe find the same event narrated in the folk-lore of the modern\r\nEuropean nations.\r\n\r\nSays the Russian fairy-tale:\r\n\r\n\"Once there was an old couple who had three sons.\"\r\n\r\nHere we are reminded of Shem, Ham, and Japheth; of Zeus, Pluto, and\r\nNeptune; of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva; of the three-pronged trident of\r\nPoseidon; of the three roots of the tree Ygdrasil.\r\n\r\n\"Two of them,\" continues the legend, \"had their wits about them, but\r\nthe third, Ivan, was a simpleton.\r\n\r\n\"Now, in the lands in which Ivan lived _there was never any day, but\r\nalways night_. This was a _snake's doings_. Well, Ivan undertook to\r\nkill the snake.\"\r\n\r\n[1. Poor, \"Sanskrit Literature,\" p. 236.]\r\n\r\n{p. 243}\r\n\r\nThis is the same old serpent, the dragon, the apostate, the leviathan.\r\n\r\n\"Then came a _third_ snake with twelve heads. Ivan killed it, and\r\ndestroyed the heads, and immediately there was _a bright light_\r\nthroughout the whole land.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere we have the same series of monsters found in Hesiod, in\r\nRagnarok, and in the legends of different nations; and the killing of\r\nthe third serpent is followed by a bright light throughout the whole\r\nland--the conflagration.\r\n\r\nAnd the Russians have the legend in another form. They tell of Ilia,\r\nthe peasant, the servant of Vladimir, _Fair Sun_. He meets the\r\nbrigand Soloveï, a monster, a gigantic bird, called the nightingale;\r\nhis claws extend for seven versts over the country. Like the dragon\r\nof Hesiod, he was full of sounds--\"he roared like a wild beast,\r\nbowled like a dog, and whistled like a nightingale.\" Ilia bits him\r\nwith an arrow in the right eye, and he _tumbles_ headlong from his\r\nlofty nest _to the earth_. The wife of the monster follows Ilia, who\r\nhas attached him to his saddle, and is dragging him away; she offers\r\ncupfuls of gold, silver, and pearls--an allusion probably to the\r\nprecious metals and stones which were said to have fallen from the\r\nheavens. The Sun (Vladimir) welcomes Ilia, and requests the monster\r\nto howl, roar, and whistle for his entertainment; he contemptuously\r\nrefuses; Ilia then commands him and he obeys: the noise is so\r\nterrible that the roof of the palace falls off, and the courtiers\r\n_drop dead with fear_. Ilia, indignant at such an uproar, \"cuts up\r\nthe monster into little pieces, which _he scatters over the\r\nfields_\"--(the Drift).[2]\r\n\r\nSubsequently Ilia _hides away in a cave_, unfed by\r\n\r\n[1. Poor, \"Sanskrit and Kindred Literatures,\" p. 390.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. .281.]\r\n\r\n{p. 244}\r\n\r\nVladimir--that is to say, without the light of the sun. At length the\r\nsun goes to seek him, expecting to find him starved to death; but the\r\nking's daughter has sent him food every day for _three years_, and he\r\ncomes out of the cave hale and hearty, and ready to fight again for\r\nVladimir, the Fair Sun.[1] These three years are the three years of\r\nthe \"Fimbul-winter\" of the Norse legends.\r\n\r\nI have already quoted (see chapter viii, Part Ill, page 216, _ante_)\r\nthe legends of the Central American race, the Quiches, preserved in\r\nthe \"Popul Vuh,\" their sacred book, in which they describe the Age of\r\nDarkness and cold. I quote again, from the same work, a graphic and\r\nwonderful picture of the return of the sun\r\n\r\n\"They determined to leave Tulan, and the greater part of them, under\r\nthe guardianship and direction of Tohil, set out to see where they\r\nwould take up their abode. They continued on their way amid the most\r\nextreme hardships for the want of food; sustaining themselves at one\r\ntime upon the mere smell of their staves, and by imagining they were\r\neating, when in verity and truth they ate nothing. Their heart,\r\nindeed, it is again and again said, was almost broken by affliction.\r\nPoor wanderers! they had a cruel way to go, many forests to pierce,\r\nmany stern mountains to overpass, and a long passage to make through\r\nthe sea, along _the shingle and pebbles and drifted sand_--the sea\r\nbeing, however, parted for their passage. At last they came to a\r\nmountain, that they named Hacavitz, after one of their gods, and here\r\nthey rested--for here they were by some means given to understand\r\nthat _they should see the sun_. Then, indeed, was filled with an\r\nexceeding joy the heart of Balam-Quitzé, of Balam-Agab of Mahucutah,\r\nand of Iqui-Balam. It seemed to them that even the face of the\r\nmorning star caught a new and more resplendent brightness.\r\n\r\n\"They shook their incense-pans and danced for very gladness: sweet\r\nwere their tears in dancing, very hot\r\n\r\n[1. Poor, \"Sanskrit and Kindred Literatures,\" p. 883.]\r\n\r\n{p. 245}\r\n\r\ntheir incense--their precious incense. _At last the sun commenced to\r\nadvance_; the animals small and great were full of delight; they\r\nraised themselves to the surface of the water; they fluttered in the\r\nravines; they gathered at the edge of the mountains, turning their\r\nbeads together toward that part from which the sun came. And the lion\r\nand the tiger roared. And the first bird that sang was that called\r\nthe Queletzu. All the animals were beside themselves at the sight;\r\nthe eagle and the kite beat their wings, and every bird both great\r\nand small. _The men prostrated themselves on the ground_, for their\r\nhearts were full to the brim.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHow graphic is all this picture! How life-like! Here we have the\r\nstarving and wandering nations, as described in the preceding\r\nchapter, moving in the continual twilight; at last the clouds grow\r\nbrighter, the sun appears: all nature rejoices in the unwonted sight,\r\nand mankind fling themselves upon their faces like \"the rude and\r\nsavage man of Ind, kissing the base ground with obedient breast,\" at\r\nthe first coming of the glorious day.\r\n\r\nBut the clouds still are mighty; rains and storms and fogs battle\r\nwith the warmth and light. The \"Popul Vuh\" continues:\r\n\r\n\"And the sun and the moon and the stars were now all established\";\r\nthat is, they now become visible, moving in their orbits. \"Yet was\r\nnot the sun then in the beginning the same as now; his _heat wanted\r\nforce_, and he was _but as a reflection in a mirror_; verily, say the\r\nhistorians, not at all the same sun as that of to-day. Nevertheless,\r\nhe _dried up and warmed the surface of the earth, and answered many\r\ngood ends_.\"\r\n\r\nCould all this have been invented? This people could not themselves\r\nhave explained the meaning of their myth, and yet it dove-tails into\r\nevery fact revealed by our latest science as to the Drift Age.\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 46.]\r\n\r\n{p. 246}\r\n\r\nAnd then, the \"Popul Vuh\" tells us, the sun petrified their gods: in\r\nother words, the worship of lions, tigers, and snakes, represented by\r\nstone idols, gave way before the worship of the great luminary whose\r\nsteadily increasing beams were filling the world with joy and light.\r\n\r\nAnd then the people sang a hymn, \"the song called 'Kamucu,'\" one of\r\nthe oldest of human compositions, in memory of the millions who had\r\nperished in the mighty cataclysm:\r\n\r\n\"We _see;_\" they sang, \"alas, we ruined ourselves in Tulan; _there\r\nlost we many of our kith and kin;_ they still remain there! left\r\nbehind! We, indeed, _have seen the sun_, but they--now that his\r\ngolden light begins to appear, where are they?\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, we rejoice, but the mighty dead will never rejoice\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAnd shortly after Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Agab, Mahucutah, and\r\nIqui-Balam, the hero-leaders of the race, died and were buried.\r\n\r\nThis battle between the sun and the comet graduated, as I have shown,\r\ninto a contest between light and darkness; and, by a natural\r\ntransition, this became in time the unending struggle between the\r\nforces of good and the powers of evil--between God and Satan; and the\r\nimagery associated with it has,--strange to say,--continued down into\r\nour own literature.\r\n\r\nThat great scholar and mighty poet, John Milton, had the legends of\r\nthe Greeks and Romans and the unwritten traditions of all peoples in\r\nhis mind, when he described, in the sixth book of \"Paradise Lost,\"\r\nthe tremendous conflict between the angels of God and the followers\r\nof the Fallen One, the Apostate, the great serpent, the dragon,\r\nLucifer, the bright-shining, the star of the morning, coming, like\r\nthe comet, from the north.\r\n\r\n{p. 247}\r\n\r\nMilton did not intend such a comparison; but he could not tell the\r\nstory without his over-full mind recurring to the imagery of the\r\npast. Hence we read the following description of the comet; of that--\r\n\r\n             \"Thunder-cloud of nations,\r\n     Wrecking earth and darkening heaven.\"\r\n\r\nMilton tells us that when God's troops went forth to the battle--\r\n\r\n             \"At last,\r\n     Far in the horizon, _to the north_, appeared\r\n     From skirt to skirt, a _fiery region stretched_,\r\n     In battailous aspect, and nearer view\r\n     Bristled with upright beams innumerable\r\n     Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged and shields\r\n     Various, with boastful arguments portrayed,\r\n     The banded powers of Satan, hasting on\r\n     With furious expedition. . . .\r\n     High in the midst, exalted as a god,\r\n     The apostate, in _his sun-bright chariot_, sat,\r\n     Idol of majesty divine, inclosed\r\n     With _flaming cherubim_ and golden shields.\"\r\n\r\nThe comet represents the uprising of a rebellious power against the\r\nsupreme and orderly dominion of God. The angel Abdiel says to Satan:\r\n\r\n             \"Fool! not to think how vain\r\n     Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms;\r\n     Who out of smallest things could without end\r\n     Have raised incessant armies to defeat\r\n     Thy folly; or, with solitary hand,\r\n     Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow,\r\n     Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed\r\n     Thy legions under darkness.\"\r\n\r\nThe battle begins:\r\n\r\n     \"Now storming fury rose,\r\n     And clamor such as heard in heav'n till now\r\n     Was never; arms on armor clashing brayed {p. 248}\r\n     Horrible discord, and the madding wheels\r\n     Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise\r\n     Of conflict; overhead the dismal _hiss_\r\n     Of fiery darts in _flaming volleys flew_,\r\n     And, flying, vaulted either host with fire. . . .\r\n     Army 'gainst army, numberless to raise\r\n     _Dreadful combustion_ warring and disturb\r\n     Though not destroy, their happy native seat.\r\n             . . . Sometimes on firm ground\r\n     A standing fight, then _soaring on main wing_\r\n     Tormented all the air, _all air seemed then_\r\n     Conflicting fire.\"\r\n\r\nMichael, the archangel, denounces Satan as an unknown being a\r\nstranger:\r\n\r\n     \"Author of evil, _unknown till thy revolt_,\r\n     _Unnamed_ in heaven . . . how hast thou disturbed\r\n     Heav'n's blessed peace, and into nature brought\r\n     Misery, uncreated till the crime\r\n     Of thy rebellion! . . . But think not here\r\n     To trouble holy rest; heav'n casts thee out\r\n     From all her confines: heav'n, the seat of bliss,\r\n     Brooks not the works of violence and war.\r\n     Hence then, and evil go with thee along,\r\n     Thy offspring, to the place of evil, bell,\r\n     Thou and thy wicked crew! \"\r\n\r\nBut the comet (Satan) replies that it desires liberty to go where it\r\npleases; it refuses to submit its destructive and erratic course to\r\nthe domination of the Supreme Good; it proposes--\r\n\r\n             \"Here, however, to dwell free\r\n     If not to reign.\"\r\n\r\nThe result, of the first day's struggle is a drawn battle.\r\n\r\nThe evil angels meet in a night conference, and prepare gunpowder and\r\ncannon, with which to overthrow God's armies!\r\n\r\n     \"Hollow engines, long and round,\r\n     Thick rammed, at th' other bore with touch of fire {p. 249}\r\n     Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth\r\n     From far, with thund'ring noise, among our foes\r\n     Such implements of mischief, as shall dash\r\n     To pieces, and overwhelm whatever stands\r\n     Adverse.\"\r\n\r\nThus armed, the evil ones renew the fight. They fire their cannon:\r\n\r\n             \"For sudden all at once their reeds\r\n     Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied\r\n     With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame,\r\n     But soon obscured with clouds, all heav'n appeared,\r\n     From these deep-throated engines belched, whose roar\r\n     Emboweled with outrageous noise the air,\r\n     And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul\r\n     Their devilish glut, chained thunder-bolts and hail\r\n     Of iron globes.\"\r\n\r\nThe angels of God were at first overwhelmed by this shower of\r\nmissiles and cast down; but they soon rallied:\r\n\r\n     \"From their foundations, loos'ning to and fro,\r\n     They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,\r\n     Rocks, waters, woods, and by their shaggy tops\r\n     Uplifted bore them in their hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe rebels seized the hills also:\r\n\r\n     So hills amid the air encountered hills,\r\n     Hurled to and fro with jaculation. dire.\r\n\r\n     . . . . And now all heaven\r\n     Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread,\"\r\n\r\nhad not the Almighty sent out his Son, the Messiah, to help his\r\nsorely struggling angels. The evil ones are overthrown, overwhelmed,\r\ndriven to the edge of heaven:\r\n\r\n             \"The monstrous sight\r\n     Struck them with horror backward, but far worse\r\n     Urged them behind; headlong themselves they threw\r\n     Down from the verge of heav'n; eternal wrath\r\n     Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. . . .{p. 250}\r\n     Nine days they fell: _confounded Chaos roared_\r\n     And felt tenfold confusion in their fall\r\n     Through his wide anarchy, so huge a rout\r\n     Encumbered him with ruin.\"\r\n\r\nThus down into our own times and literature has penetrated a vivid\r\npicture of this world-old battle. We see, as in the legends, the\r\ntemporary triumph of the dragon; we see the imperiled sun obscured;\r\nwe see the flying rocks filling the appalled air and covering all\r\nthings with ruin; we see the dragon at last slain, and falling clown\r\nto hell and chaos; while the sun returns, and God and order reign\r\nonce more supreme.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, again, Milton paints the chaos that precedes restoration:\r\n\r\n     On heav'nly ground they stood; and from the shores\r\n     They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss,\r\n     Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,\r\n     Up from the bottom, turned by furious winds\r\n     And surging waves, as mountains to assault\r\n     Heav'n's height, and with the center mix the poles.\"\r\n\r\nBut order, peace, love, and goodness follow this dark, wild age of\r\ncold and wet and chaos:--the Night is slain, and the sun of God's\r\nmercy shines once more on its appointed track in the heavens.\r\n\r\nBut never again, they feel, shall the world go back to the completely\r\nglorious conditions of the Tertiary Age, the golden age of the\r\nEden-land. The comet has \"brought death into the world, and all our\r\nwoe.\" Mankind has sustained its great, its irreparable \"Fall.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the event that lies, with mighty meanings, at the base of all\r\nour theologies.\r\n\r\n{p. 251}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                   THE FALL OF THE CLAY AND GRAVEL.\r\n\r\nI TRUST that the reader, who has followed me thus far in this\r\nargument, is satisfied that the legends of mankind point unmistakably\r\nto the fact that the earth, in some remote age--before the\r\nPolynesians, Red-men, Europeans, and Asiatics had separated, or been\r\ndeveloped as varieties out of one family--met with a tremendous\r\ncatastrophe; that a conflagration raged over parts of its surface;\r\nthat mankind took refuge in the caves of the earth, whence they\r\nafterward emerged to wander for a long time, in great poverty and\r\nhardships, during a period of darkness; and that finally this\r\ndarkness dispersed, and the sun shone again in the heavens.\r\n\r\nI do not see how the reader can avoid these conclusions.\r\n\r\nThere are but two alternatives before him: he must either suppose\r\nthat all this concatenation of legends is the outgrowth of a\r\nprodigious primeval lie, or he must concede that it describes some\r\nevent which really happened.\r\n\r\nTo adopt the theory of a great race-lie, originating at the beginning\r\nof human history, is difficult, inasmuch as these legends do not tell\r\nthe same story in anything like the same way, as would have been the\r\ncase had they all originated in the first instance from the same\r\nmind. While we have the conflagration in some of the legends, it has\r\n\r\n{p. 252}\r\n\r\nbeen dropped out of others; in one it is caused by the sun; in\r\nanother by the demon; in another by the moon; in one Phaëton produced\r\nit by driving the sun out of its course; while there are a whole body\r\nof legends in which it is the result of catching the sun in a noose.\r\nSo with the stories of the cave-life. In some, men seek the caves to\r\nescape the conflagration; in others, their race began in the caves.\r\nIn like manner the age of darkness is in some cases produced by the\r\nclouds; in others by the death of the sun. Again, in tropical regions\r\nthe myth turns upon a period of terrible heat when there were neither\r\nclouds nor rain; when some demon had stolen the clouds or dragged\r\nthem into his cave: while in more northern regions the horrible age\r\nof ice and cold and snow seems to have made the most distinct\r\nimpression on the memory of mankind. In some of the myths the comet\r\nis a god; in others a demon; in others a serpent; in others a\r\nfeathered serpent; in others a dragon; in others a giant; in others a\r\nbird in others a wolf; in others a dog; in still others a boar.\r\n\r\nThe legends coincide only in these facts:--the monster in the air;\r\nthe heat; the fire; the cave-life; the darkness; the return of the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn everything else they differ.\r\n\r\nSurely, a falsehood, springing out of one mind, would have been more\r\nconsistent in its parts than this.\r\n\r\nThe legends seem to represent the diverging memories which separating\r\nraces carried down to posterity of the same awful and impressive\r\nevents: they remembered them in fragments and sections, and described\r\nthem as the four blind men in the Hindoo story described the\r\nelephant;--to one it was a tail, to another a trunk, to another a\r\nleg, to another a body;--it needs to put all their stories together\r\nto make a consistent whole. We can not understand\r\n\r\n{p. 253}\r\n\r\nthe conflagration without the comet; or the cave-life without both;\r\nor the age of darkness without something that filled the heavens with\r\nclouds; or the victory of the sun without the clouds, and the\r\nprevious obscuration of the sun.\r\n\r\nIf the reader takes the other alternative, that these legends are not\r\nfragments of a colossal falsehood, then he must concede that the\r\nearth, since man inhabited it, encountered a comet. No other cause or\r\nevent could produce such a series of gigantic consequences as is here\r\nnarrated.\r\n\r\nBut one other question remains: Did the Drift material come from the\r\ncomet?\r\n\r\nIt could have resulted from the comet in two ways: either it was a\r\npart of the comet's substance falling upon our planet at the moment\r\nof contact; or it may have been torn from the earth itself by the\r\nforce of the comet, precisely as it has been supposed that it was\r\nproduced by the ice.\r\n\r\nThe final solution of this question can only be reached when close\r\nand extensive examination of the Drift deposits have been made to\r\nascertain how far they are of earth-origin.\r\n\r\nAnd here it must be remembered that the matter which composes our\r\nearth and the other planets and the comets was probably all cast out\r\nfrom the same source, the sun, and hence a uniformity runs through it\r\nall. Humboldt says:\r\n\r\n\"We are 'astonished at being able to touch, weigh, and chemically\r\ndecompose metallic and earthy masses which belong to the outer world,\r\nto celestial space'; to find in them the minerals of our native\r\nearth, making it probable, as the great Newton conjectured, that the\r\nmaterials which belong to one group of cosmical bodies are for the\r\nmost part the same.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1. \"Cosmos,\" vol. iv, p. 206.]\r\n\r\n{p. 254}\r\n\r\nSome aërolites are composed of finely granular tissue of olivine,\r\naugite, and labradorite blended together (as the meteoric stone found\r\nat Duvets, in the department de l'Ardèche, France):\r\n\r\n\"These bodies contain, for instance, crystalline substances,\r\nperfectly similar to those of our earth's crust; and in the Siberian\r\nmass of meteoric iron, investigated by Pallas, the olivine only\r\ndiffers from common olivine by the absence of nickel, which is\r\nreplaced by oxide of tin.\"\r\n\r\nNeither is it true that all meteoric stones are of iron. Humboldt\r\nrefers to the aërolites of Siena, \"in which the iron scarcely amounts\r\nto two per cent, or the earthy aërolite of Alais, (in the department\r\ndu Gard, France,) _which broke up in the water_,\" (clay?); \"or,\r\nlastly, those from Jonzac and Juvenas, which contained _no metallic\r\niron_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nWho shall say what chemical changes may take place in remnants of the\r\ncomet floating for thousands of years through space, and now falling\r\nto our earth? And who shall say that the material of all comets\r\nassumes the same form?\r\n\r\nI can not but continue to think, however, until thorough scientific\r\ninvestigation disproves the theory, that the cosmical granite-dust\r\nwhich, mixed with water, became clay, and which covers so large a\r\npart of the world, we might say one half the earth-surface of the\r\nplanet, and possibly also the gravel and striated stones, fell to the\r\nearth from the comet.\r\n\r\nIt is a startling and tremendous conception, but we are dealing with\r\nstartling and tremendous facts. Even though we dismiss the theory as\r\nimpossible, we still find ourselves face to face with the question,\r\nWhere, then, did these continental masses of matter come from?\r\n\r\n[1. \"Cosmos,\" vol. i, p. 131.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., vol. i, p. 129.]\r\n\r\n{p. 255}\r\n\r\nI think the reader will agree with me that the theory of the\r\nglacialists, that a world-infolding ice-sheet produced them, is\r\nimpossible; to reiterate, they are found, (on the equator,) where the\r\nice-sheet could not have been without ending all terrestrial life;\r\nand they are not found where the ice must have been, in Siberia and\r\nNorthwestern America, if ice was anywhere.\r\n\r\nIf neither ice nor water ground up the earth-surface into the Drift,\r\nthen we must conclude that the comet so ground it up, or brought the\r\nmaterials with it already ground up.\r\n\r\nThe probability is, that both of these suppositions are in part true;\r\nthe comet brought down upon the earth the clay-dust and part of the\r\ngravel and bowlders; while the awful force it exerted, meeting the\r\nearth while moving at the rate of a million miles an hour, smashed\r\nthe surface-rocks, tore them to pieces, ground them up and mixed the\r\nmaterial with its own, and deposited all together on the heated\r\nsurface of the earth, where the lower part was baked by the heat into\r\n\"till\" or \"hardpan,\" while the rushing cyclones deposited the other\r\nmaterial in partly stratified masses or drifts above it; and part of\r\nthis in time was rearranged by the great floods which followed the\r\ncondensation of the cloud-masses into rain and snow, in the period of\r\nthe River or Champlain Drift.\r\n\r\nNothing can be clearer than that the inhabitants of the earth\r\nbelieved that the stones fell from heaven--to wit, from the comet.\r\nBut it would be unsafe to base a theory upon such a belief, inasmuch\r\nas stones, and even fish and toads, taken up by hurricanes, have\r\noften fallen again in showers; and they would appear to an uncritical\r\npopulation to have fallen from heaven. But it is, at least, clear\r\nthat the fall of the stones and the clay are associated in\r\n\r\n{p. 256}\r\n\r\nthe legends with the time of the great catastrophe; they are part of\r\nthe same terrible event.\r\n\r\nI shall briefly recapitulate some of the evidence.\r\n\r\nThe Mattoles, an Indian tribe of Northern California, have this\r\nlegend:\r\n\r\n\"As to the creation, they teach that a certain Big Man began by\r\nmaking the _naked earth, silent and bleak_, with nothing of plant or\r\nanimal thereon, save one Indian, who roamed about _in a wofully\r\nhungry and desolate state_. Suddenly there arose a terrible\r\nwhirlwind, _the air grew dark and thick with dust and drifting sand_,\r\nand the Indian fell upon his face in sore dread. Then there came a\r\ngreat calm, and the man rose and looked, and lo, all the earth was\r\nperfect and peopled; the grass and the trees were green on every\r\nplain and hill; the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the\r\ncreeping things, the things that swim, moved everywhere in his\r\nsight.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHere, as often happens, the impressive facts are remembered, but in a\r\ndisarranged chronological order. There came a whirlwind, thick with\r\ndust, the clay-dust, and drifting sand and gravel. It left the world\r\nnaked and lifeless, \"silent and bleak\"; only one Indian remained, and\r\nhe was dreadfully hungry. But after a time all this catastrophe\r\npassed away, and the earth was once more populous and beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn the Peruvian legends, Apocatequil was the great god who saved them\r\nfrom the powers of the darkness. He restored the light. He produced\r\nthe lightning by hurling stones with his sling. The thunder-bolts are\r\n_small, round, smooth stones_.[2]\r\n\r\nThe stone-worship, which played so large a part in antiquity, was\r\ndoubtless due to the belief that many of the stones of the earth had\r\nfallen from heaven. Dr. Schwarz,\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 86.\r\n\r\n2. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 165.]\r\n\r\n{p. 257}\r\n\r\nof Berlin, has shown that the lightning was associated in popular\r\nlegends _with the serpent_.\r\n\r\n\"When the lightning kindles the woods it is associated with the\r\n_descent of fire from heaven_, and, as in popular imagination, where\r\nit falls it scatters the thunderbolts in all directions, _the\r\nflint-stones_, which flash when struck, were supposed to be these\r\nfragments, and gave rise to the stone-worship so frequent in the old\r\nworld.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, in old times, the bowlders were called devil-stones; they\r\nwere supposed. to have originated from \"the malevolent agency of\r\nman's spiritual foes.\" This was a reminiscence of their real source.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see (page 173, _ante_) that the Iroquois legends\r\nrepresent the great battle between the _White One_, the sun, and the\r\n_Dark One_, the comet. The _Dark One_ was wounded to death, and, as\r\nit fled for life, \"the blood gushed from him at every step, and as it\r\nfell _turned into flint-stones_.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the red clay and the gravel both represented.\r\n\r\nAmong the Central Americans the flints were associated with Hurakan,\r\nHaokah, and Tlaloe {_Tlaloc?--jbh_}, the gods of storm and thunder:\r\n\r\n\"The thunder-bolts, as elsewhere, were believed to be flints, and\r\nthus, as the emblem of the fire and the storm, this stone figures\r\nconspicuously in their myths. Tohil, the god who gave the Quiches\r\nfire by shaking his sandals, was _represented by a flint-stone_. Such\r\na stone, _in the beginning of things, fell from heaven to earth, and\r\nbroke into sixteen hundred pieces_, each of which sprang up a god. .\r\n. . This is the germ of the adoration of stones as emblems of the\r\nfecundating rains. This is why, for example) the Navajos use, as\r\ntheir charm for rain, certain\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 117.]\r\n\r\n{p. 258}\r\n\r\nlong, _round_ stones, which they think fall from the cloud when it\r\nthunders.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn the Algonquin legends of Manibozho, or Manobosbu, or Nanabojou,\r\nthe great ancestor of all the Algic tribes, the hero man-god, we\r\nlearn, had a terrific battle with \"his brother Chakekenapok, _the\r\nflint-stone, whom he broke in pieces, and scattered over the land_,\r\nand changed his entrails into fruitful vines. The conflict was _long\r\nand terrible_. The face of nature was _desolated as by a tornado, and\r\nthe gigantic bowlders and loose rocks found on the prairies are the\r\nmissiles hurled by the mighty combatants_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nWe read in the Ute legends, given on page ---, _ante_, that when the\r\nmagical arrow of Ta-wats \"struck the sun-god full in the face, the\r\nsun was shivered into a _thousand fragments, which fell to the\r\nearth_, causing a general conflagration.\"[3]\r\n\r\nHere we have the same reference to matter falling on the earth from\r\nthe heavens, associated with devouring fire. And we have the same\r\nsequence of events, for we learn that when all of Ta-wats was\r\nconsumed but the head, \"his tears gushed forth in a flood, which\r\nspread over the earth and extinguished the fires.\"\r\n\r\nThe Aleuts of the Aleutian Archipelago have a tradition that a\r\ncertain Old Man, called Traghdadakh, created men \"_by casting stones\r\non the earth; he flung also other stones into the air, the water, and\r\nover the land_, thus making beasts, birds, and fishes.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIt is a general belief in many races that the stone axes and celts\r\nfell from the heavens. In Japan, the stone\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 170.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 181.\r\n\r\n3. Major J. W.

Similar beliefs are found in Brittany, in Madagascar, Ireland,\r\nBrazil, China, the Shetlands, Scotland, Portugal, etc.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the legends of Quetzalcoatl, the central figure of the Toltec\r\nmythology, we have a white man--a bearded man--from an eastern land,\r\nmixed up with something more than man. He was the Bird-serpent, that\r\nis, the winged or flying serpent, the great snake of the air, the son\r\nof Iztac Mixcoatl, \"the white-cloud serpent, the spirit of the\r\ntornado.\"[2] He created the world. He was overcome by Tezcatlipoca,\r\nthe spirit of the night.\r\n\r\n\"When he would promulgate his decrees, his herald proclaimed them\r\nfrom Tzatzitepec, the hill of shouting, with such a mighty voice that\r\nit could be heard a hundred leagues around. The _arrows which he\r\nshot_ transfixed great trees; _the stones he threw leveled forests;_\r\nand when he laid his hands on the rocks the _mark was indelible_.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\"His symbols were the bird, the serpent, the cross, and _the\r\nflint_.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIn the Aztec calendar the sign for the age of fire is the _flint_.\r\n\r\nIn the Chinese Encyclopædia of the Emperor Kang-hi, 1662, we are told:\r\n\r\n\"In traveling from the shores of the Eastern Sea toward Che-lu,\r\nneither brooks nor ponds are met with in the country, although it is\r\nintersected by mountains and valleys. Nevertheless, there are found\r\nin the sand, very far away from the sea, oyster-shells and the\r\nshields of crabs.

This is why these deserts are\r\ncalled the 'Sandy Sea,' which indicates that they were not always\r\ncovered with sand and gravel.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn the Russian legends, a \"golden ship sails across the heavenly sea;\r\nit breaks into fragments, which neither princes nor people can put\r\ntogether again,\"--reminding one of Humpty-Dumpty, in the\r\nnursery-song, who, when he fell from his elevated position on the\r\nwall--\r\n\r\n     \"Not all the king's horses,\r\n     Nor all the king's men,\r\n     Can ever make whole again.\"\r\n\r\nIn another Russian legend, Perun, the thunder-god, destroys the\r\ndevils with _stone_ hammers. On Ilya's day, the peasants offer him a\r\nroasted animal, which is cut up and _scattered over the fields_,[2]\r\njust as we have seen the great dragon or serpent cut to pieces and\r\nscattered over the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Christy found at Bou-Merzoug, on the plateau of the Atlas, in\r\nNorthern Africa, in a bare, deserted, stony place among the\r\nmountains, a collection of fifteen hundred tombs, made of rude\r\nlimestone slabs, set up with one slab to form a roof, so as to make\r\nperfect dolmens--closed chambers--where the bodies were packed in.\r\n\r\n\"Tradition says that a wicked people lived there, and for their sins\r\n_stones were rained upon them from heaven;_ so they built these\r\nchambers to creep into.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the legend of \"Phaëton,\" already given, Ovid derived\r\nfrom the legends of his race another story,\r\n\r\n[1. Tylor's \"Early Mankind,\" p. 328.\r\n\r\n2. Poor, \"Sanskrit Literature,\" p. 400.\r\n\r\n3. Tylor's \"Early Mankind,\" p. 222.]\r\n\r\n{p. 261}\r\n\r\nwhich seems to have had reference to the same event. He says (Fable\r\nXI):\r\n\r\n\"After the men who came from the Tyrian nation had touched this grove\r\nwith ill-fated steps, and the urn let down into the water made a\r\nsplash, the _azure dragon_ stretched forth his head from the deep\r\ncave, and uttered dreadful hissings.\"\r\n\r\nWe are reminded of the flying monster of Hesiod, which roared and\r\nhissed so terribly.\r\n\r\nOvid continues:\r\n\r\n\"The urns dropped from their hands, and the blood left their bodies,\r\nand a sudden trembling seized their astonished limbs. He wreathes his\r\nscaly orbs in rolling spirals, and, with a spring, becomes twisted\r\ninto mighty folds; and, uprearing himself from below the middle into\r\nthe light air, he looks down upon all the grove, and is of\" (as)\r\n\"large size, as, if you were to look on him entire, the _serpent_\r\nwhich separates the two Bears\" (the constellations).\r\n\r\nHe slays the Ph&oelig;nicians; \"some he kills with his sting, some\r\nwith his long folds, some breathed upon by the venom of his baleful\r\npoison.\"\r\n\r\nCadmus casts a huge stone, as big as a millstone, against him, but it\r\nfalls harmless upon his scales, \"that were like a coat-of-mail\"; then\r\nCadmus pierced him with his spear. In his fall he crushes the\r\nforests; the blood flows from his poisonous palate and changes the\r\ncolor of the grass. He is slain.\r\n\r\nThen, under the advice of Pallas, Cadmus _sows the earth with the\r\ndragon's teeth,_ \"_under the earth turned up_, as the seeds of a\r\nfuture people.\" Afterward, the earth begins to move, and armed men\r\nrise up; they slay Cadmus, and then fight with and slay each other.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a recollection of the comet, and the stones falling\r\nfrom heaven; and upon the land so afflicted\r\n\r\n{p. 262}\r\n\r\nsubsequently a warlike and aggressive and quarrelsome race of men\r\nsprings up.\r\n\r\nIn the contest of Hercules with the Lygians, on the road from\r\nCaucasus _to the Hesperides_, \"there is an attempt to explain\r\nmythically the origin of the round quartz blocks in the Lygian field\r\nof stones, at the mouth of the Rhône.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn the \"Prometheus Delivered\" of Æsechylus, Jupiter draws together a\r\ncloud, and causes \"the district round about to be _covered with a\r\nshower of round stones_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe legends of Europe refer to a race buried under sand and earth:\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants of Central Europe and Teutonic races who came late\r\nto England, place their mythical heroes _under ground in caves_, in\r\nvaults beneath enchanted castles, or in _mounds_ which open and show\r\ntheir buried inhabitants alive and busy about the avocations of\r\nearthly men. . . . In Morayshire _the buried race are supposed to\r\nhave been buried under the sand-hills_, as they are in some parts of\r\nBrittany.\"[3]\r\n\r\nTurning again to America, we find, in the great prayer of the Aztecs\r\nto Tezcalipoca, {_Tezcatlipoca--jbh_} given on page 186, _ante_, many\r\nreferences to some material substances falling from heaven; we read:\r\n\r\n\"Thine anger and indignation has _descended upon us_ in these days, .\r\n. . coming down even as _stones, spears, and darts upon the wretches\r\nthat inhabit_ the earth; this is the pestilence by which we are\r\nafflicted and _almost destroyed_.\" The children die, \"broken and\r\ndashed to pieces _as against stones_ and a wall. . . . Thine anger\r\nand thy indignation does it delight in _hurling the stone and arrow\r\nand spear_. The _grinders of thy teeth_\" (the dragon's teeth of\r\nOvid?) \"are employed, and thy bitter whips upon the miserable of\r\n\r\n[1. \"Cosmos,\" vol. i, p. 115.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 115.\r\n\r\n3. \"Frost and Fire,\" vol. ii, p. 190.]\r\n\r\n{p. 263}\r\n\r\nthy people.... Hast thou verily determined that it utterly perish; .\r\n. . that the peopled place become a wooded hill and _a wilderness of\r\nstones?_ . . . Is there to be no mercy nor pity for us until the\r\n_arrows of thy fury are spent?_ . . . Thine arrows and _stones have\r\nsorely hurt this poor people_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the legend of the Indians of Lake Tahoe (see page 168, _ante_), we\r\nare told that the stars were melted by the great conflagration, and\r\nthey rained down molten metal upon the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the Hindoo legend (see page 171, _ante_) of the great battle\r\nbetween Rama, the sun-god, and Ravana, the evil one, Rama persuaded\r\nthe monkeys to help him build a bridge to the Island of Lanka, \"and\r\n_the stones which crop out through Southern India are said to have\r\nbeen dropped by the monkey builders_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the legend of the Tupi Indians (see page 175, _ante_), we are told\r\nthat God \"swept about the fire in such way that in _some places he\r\nraised mountains and in others dug valleys_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Bible we have distinct references to the fall of matter from\r\nheaven. In Deuteronomy (chap. xxviii), among the consequences which\r\nare to follow disobedience of God's will, we have the following:\r\n\r\n\"22. The Lord shall smite thee . . . with an extreme burning, and\r\nwith the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall\r\npursue thee until thou perish.\r\n\r\n\"23. And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the\r\nearth that is under thee shall be iron.\r\n\r\n\"24. _The Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from.\r\nheaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed_. . . .\r\n\r\n\"29. And thou shalt _grope at noonday_, as the blind gropeth in\r\ndarkness.\"\r\n\r\nAnd even that marvelous event, so much mocked at by modern thought,\r\nthe standing-still of the sun, at the\r\n\r\n{p. 264}\r\n\r\ncommand of Joshua, may be, after all, a reminiscence of the\r\ncatastrophe of the Drift. In the American legends, we read that the\r\nsun stood still, and Ovid tells us that \"a day was lost.\" Who shall\r\nsay what circumstances accompanied an event great enough to crack the\r\nglobe itself into immense fissures? It is, at least, a curious fact\r\nthat in Joshua (chap. x) the standing-still of the sun was\r\naccompanied by a fall of stones from heaven by which multitudes were\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nHere is the record\r\n\r\n\"11. And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were\r\nin the going down to Beth-horon, that _the Lord cast down great\r\nstones from heaven upon them_ unto Azekah, and they died: there were\r\nmore which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel\r\nslew with the sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"13. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people\r\nhad avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the\r\nbook of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and\r\nhasted not to go down _about a whole day_.\r\n\r\n\"14. And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the\r\nLord hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for\r\nIsrael.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"book of Jasher\" was, we are told, a very ancient work, long\r\nsince lost. Is it not possible that a great, dim memory of a terrible\r\nevent was applied by tradition to the mighty captain of the Jews,\r\njust as the doings of Zeus have been attributed, in the folk-lore of\r\nEurope, to Charlemagne and Barbarossa?\r\n\r\nIf the contact of Lexell's comet with the earth would, as shown on\r\npage 84, _ante_, have increased the length of the sidereal year three\r\nhours, what effect might not a comet, many times larger than the mass\r\nof the earth, have had upon the revolution of the earth? Were the\r\nheat,\r\n\r\n{p. 265}\r\n\r\nthe conflagrations, and the tearing up of the earth's surface caused\r\nby such an arrestment or partial slowing-up of the earth's revolution\r\non its axis?\r\n\r\nI do not propound these questions as any part of my theory, but\r\nmerely as suggestions. The American and Polynesian legends represent\r\nthat the catastrophe increased the length of the days. This may mean\r\nnothing, or a great deal. At least, Joshua's legend may yet take its\r\nplace among the scientific possibilities.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the legend of the Toltecs of Central America, as\r\npreserved in one of the sacred books of the race, the \"Codex\r\nChimalpopoca,\" that we find the clearest and most indisputable\r\nreferences to the fall of gravel (see page 166, _ante_):\r\n\r\n\"'The third sun' (or era) 'is called Quia-Tonatiuh, sun of rain,\r\nbecause there fell a rain of fire; all which existed burned; _and\r\nthere fell a rain of gravel_.'\r\n\r\n\"'They also narrate that while _the sandstone which we now see\r\nscattered about_, and the tetzontli' (_amygdaloide poreuse_, basalt,\r\ntrap-rocks) 'boiled with great tumult, there also arose the rocks of\r\nvermilion color.'\r\n\r\n\"'Now this was in the year Ce Tecpatl, One _Flint_, it was the day\r\n_Nahui-Quiahuitl_, Fourth Rain. Now, in this day in which men were\r\nlost and destroyed _in a rain of fire_, they were transformed into\r\ngoslings.'\"[1]\r\n\r\nWe find also many allusions in the legends to the clay.\r\n\r\nWhen the Navajos climbed up from their cave they found the earth\r\ncovered with clay into which they sank mid-leg deep; and when the\r\nwater ran off it left the whole world full of mud.\r\n\r\nIn the Creek and Seminole legends the Great Spirit made the first\r\nman, in the primeval cave, \"from the clay around him.\"\r\n\r\n[1. \"North Americans of Antiquity,\" p. 499.]\r\n\r\n{p. 266}\r\n\r\nSanchoniathon, from the other side of the world, tells us, in the\r\nPh&oelig;nician legends (see page 209, _ante_), that first came\r\nchaos, and out of chaos was generated _môt_ or mud.\r\n\r\nIn the Miztec (American) legends (see page 214, _ante_), we are told\r\nthat in the Age of Darkness there was \"nothing but _mud and slime_ on\r\nall the face of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Quiche legends we are told that the first men were destroyed\r\nby fire and _pitch_ from heaven.\r\n\r\nIn the Quiche legends we also have many allusions to the wet and\r\nmuddy condition of the earth before the returning sun dried it up.\r\n\r\nIn the legends of the North American Indians we read that the earth\r\nwas covered with great heaps of ashes; doubtless the fine, dry powder\r\nof the clay looked like ashes before the water fell upon it.\r\n\r\nThere is another curious fact to be considered in connection with\r\nthese legends--that the calamity seems to have brought with it some\r\ncompensating wealth.\r\n\r\nThus we find Beowulf, when destroyed by the midnight monster,\r\nrejoicing to think that his people would receive a treasure, a\r\nfortune by the monster's death.\r\n\r\nHence we have a whole mass of legends wherein a dragon or great\r\nserpent is associated with a precious horde of gold or jewels.\r\n\r\n\"The Scythians had a saga of the sacred gold which fell _burning_\r\nfrom heaven. The ancients had also some strange fictions of silver\r\nwhich fell from heaven, and with which it had been attempted, under\r\nthe Emperor Severus, to cover bronze coins.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"In Peru the god of riches was worshiped under the image of a\r\nrattlesnake, horned and hairy, _with a tail of gold_. It was said to\r\n_have descended from the heavens in_\r\n\r\n[1. \"Cosmos,\" vol. i, p. 115.]\r\n\r\n{p. 267}\r\n\r\n_the sight of all the people_, and to have been seen by the whole\r\narmy of the Inca.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe Peruvians--probably in reference to this event--chose as their\r\narms two serpents with their tails interlaced.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks and ancient Germans the fiery dragon was _the\r\ndispenser of riches_, and \"_watches a treasure in the earth_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThese legends may be explained by the fact that in the Ural\r\nMountains, on the east of Europe, in South America, in South Africa,\r\nand in other localities, the Drift gravels contain gold and precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is found in drift-gravels alone. It is pure carbon\r\ncrystallized. Man has been unable to reproduce it, except in minute\r\nparticles; nor can he tell in what laboratory of nature it has been\r\nfabricated. It is not found _in situ_ in any of the rocks of an\r\nearth-origin. Has it been formed in space? Is it an outcome of that\r\npure carbon which the spectroscope has revealed to us as burning in\r\nsome of the comets?\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 125.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 125.]\r\n\r\n{p. 268}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                          THE ARABIAN MYTHS.\r\n\r\nAND when we turn to the Arabian tales, we not only see, by their\r\nidentity with the Hindoo and Slavonic legends, that they are of great\r\nantiquity, dating back to the time when these widely diverse races,\r\nAryan and Semitic, were one, but we find in them many allusions to\r\nthe battle between good and evil, between God and the serpent.\r\n\r\nAbou Mohammed the Lazy, who is a very great magician, with power over\r\nthe forces of the air and the Afrites, beholds a battle between two\r\ngreat snakes, one tawny-colored, the other white. The tawny serpent\r\nis overcoming the white one; but Abou Mohammed kills it with a rock.\r\n\"The white serpent\" (the sun) \"departed and was _absent for a while_,\r\nbut returned\"; and the tawny serpent was torn to pieces and scattered\r\nover the land, and nothing remained of her but her head.\r\n\r\nAnd then we have the legend of \"the City of Brass,\" or bronze. It\r\nrelates to \"an ancient age and period in the olden time.\" One of the\r\ncaliphs, Abdelmelik, the son of Marwan, has heard from antiquity that\r\nSolomon, (Solomon is, in Arabic, like Charlemagne in the middle-age\r\nmyths of Europe, the synonym for everything venerable and powerful,)\r\nhad imprisoned genii in bottles of brass, and the Caliph desired to\r\nprocure some of these bottles.\r\n\r\n{p. 269}\r\n\r\nThen Talib (the son of Sahl) tells the Caliph that a man once voyaged\r\nto the Island of Sicily, but a wind arose and blew him away \"to one\r\nof the lands of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"This happened during the black darkness of night.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a remote, unfrequented land; the people were black and lived\r\nin caves, and were naked and of strange speech. They cast their nets\r\nfor Talib and brought up a bottle of brass or bronze, containing one\r\nof the imprisoned genii, who came out of it, as a blue smoke, and\r\ncried in a horrible voice, \"Repentance, repentance, O prophet of God!\"\r\n\r\nAll this was in a Western land. And Abdelmelik sent Talib to find\r\nthis land. It was \"a journey of two years and some months going, and\r\nthe like returning.\" It was in a far country. They first reach a\r\ndeserted palace in a desolate land, the palace of \"Kosh the son of\r\nSheddad the son of Ad, the greater.\" He read an inscription:\r\n\r\n\"Here was a people, whom, after their works, thou shalt see wept over\r\nfor their lost dominion.\r\n\r\n\"And in this palace is the last information respecting lords\r\ncollected in the dust.\r\n\r\n\"Death hath destroyed them and disunited them, and in the dust they\r\nhave lost what they amassed.\"\r\n\r\nTalib goes on with his troops, until they come to a great pillar of\r\nblack stone, sunk into which, to his armpits, was a mighty creature;\r\n\"he had two wings and four arms; two of them like those of the sons\r\nof Adam, and two like the fore-legs of lions with claws. He had hair\r\nupon his head like the tails of horses, and two eyes like two burning\r\ncoals, and he had a third eye in his forehead, like the eye of the\r\nlynx, from which there appeared sparks of fire.\"\r\n\r\nHe was the imprisoned comet-monster, and these\r\n\r\n{p. 270}\r\n\r\narms and eyes, darting fire, remind us of the description given of\r\nthe apostate angel in the other legends:\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                      THE AFRITE IN THE PILLAR.\r\n\r\n\"He was tall and black; and he was crying out 'Extolled be the\r\nperfection of my Lord, who hath appointed me this severe affliction\r\nand painful torture until the day of resurrection!'\"\r\n\r\n{p. 271}\r\n\r\nThe party of Talib were stupefied at the sight and retreated in\r\nfright. And the wise man, the Sheik Abdelsamad, one of the party,\r\ndrew near and asked the imprisoned monster his history. And he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"I am an Afrite of the genii, and my name is Dahish, the son of\r\nElamash, and I am restrained here by the majesty of God.\r\n\r\n\"There belonged to one of the sons of Eblis an idol of red carnelian,\r\nof which I was made guardian; and there used to worship it one of the\r\nkings of the sea, of illustrious dignity, of great glory, leading,\r\namong his troops of the genii, a million warriors who smote with\r\nswords before him, and who answered his prayer in cases of\r\ndifficulty. These genii, who obeyed him, were under my command and\r\nauthority, following my words when I ordered them: all of them were\r\nin rebellion against Solomon the son of David (on both of whom be\r\npeace!), and I used to enter the body of the idol, to command them\r\nand to forbid them.\"\r\n\r\nSolomon sent word to this king of the sea that he must give up the\r\nworship of the idol of red carnelian; the king consulted the idol,\r\nand this Afrite, speaking through the idol, encouraged the king to\r\nrefuse. What,--he said to him,--can Solomon do to thee, \"when thou\r\nart in the midst of this great sea?\" And so Solomon came to compel\r\nthe island-race to worship the true God; he surrounded his island,\r\nand filled the land with his troops, assisted by birds and wild\r\nbeasts, and a dreadful battle followed in the air:\r\n\r\n\"After this they came upon us all together, and we contended with him\r\nin a wide tract _for a period of two days_; and calamity befell us on\r\nthe third day, and the decree of God (whose name be exalted!) was\r\nexecuted among us. The first who charged upon Solomon were I and my\r\ntroops: and I said to my companions, 'Keep in your places in the\r\nbattle-field while I go forth to them and challenge _Dimiriat_.\"'\r\n(Dimiriat was the Sun, the\r\n\r\n{p. 272}\r\n\r\nbright one.) \"And lo, _he came forth, like a great mountain, his\r\nfires flaming and his smoke ascending;_ and he approached and _smote\r\nme with a flaming fire; and his arrow prevailed over my fire_. He\r\ncried out at me _with a prodigious cry_, so that I imagined the\r\n_heaven had fallen_ and closed over me, and the mountains shook at\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                    DAHISH OVERTAKEN BY DIMIRIAT.\r\n\r\nThen he commanded his companions, and they charged upon us all\r\ntogether: we also charged upon them, and we cried out one to another:\r\n_the fires rose and the smoke ascended_, the hearts of the combatants\r\nwere almost cleft asunder, and the battle raged. The birds fought in\r\nthe air, and the wild _beasts in the dust_; and I contended with\r\nDimiriat until he wearied me and I wearied him;\r\n\r\n{p. 273}\r\n\r\nafter which I became weak, and my companions and troops were\r\nenervated and my tribes were routed.\"\r\n\r\nThe birds tore out the eyes of the demons, and cut them in pieces\r\nuntil _the earth was covered with the fragments_, like the trunks of\r\npalm-trees. \"As for me, I flew from before Dimiriat, but he followed\r\nme a journey of three months until he overtook me.\" And Solomon\r\nhollowed out the black pillar, and sealed him in it with his signet,\r\nand chained him until the day of resurrection.\r\n\r\nAnd Talib and his party go on still farther, and find \"the City of\r\nBrass,\" a weird, mysterious, lost city, in a desolate land; silent,\r\nand all its people dead; a city once of high civilization, with\r\nmighty, brazen walls and vast machinery and great mysteries; a city\r\nwhose inhabitants had perished suddenly in some great calamity. And\r\non the walls were tablets, and on one of them were inscribed these\r\nsolemn words:\r\n\r\n\"'Where are the kings and the peoples of the earth? They have quitted\r\nthat which they have built and peopled. And in the grave they are\r\npledged for their past actions. There, after destruction, they have\r\nbecome putrid corpses. Where are the troops? They repelled not nor\r\nprofited. And where is that which they collected and boarded? The\r\ndecree of the Lord of the Throne _surprised them_. Neither riches nor\r\nrefuge saved them from it.'\r\n\r\n\"And they saw the merchants dead in their shops; their skins were\r\ndried, and their bones were carious, and they had become examples to\r\nhim who would be admonished.\"\r\n\r\nEverywhere were the dead, \"lying upon skins, and appearing almost as\r\nif they would speak.\"\r\n\r\nTheir death seems to have been due to a long period of terrible heat\r\nand drought.\r\n\r\nOn a couch was a damsel more beautiful than all the daughters of\r\nAdam; she was embalmed, so as to preserve all her charms. Her eyes\r\nwere of glass, filled with quick\r\n\r\n{p. 274}\r\n\r\nsilver, which seemed to follow the beholder's every motion. Near her\r\nwas a tablet of gold, on which was inscribed:\r\n\r\n\"In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.... the Lord of\r\nlords, the Cause of causes; the Everlasting, the Eternal. . . . Where\r\nare the kings of the regions of the earth\" Where are the Amalekites?\r\nWhere are the mighty monarchs? The mansions are void of their\r\npresence, and they have quitted their families and homes. Where are\r\nthe kings of the foreigners and the Arabs? They have all died and\r\nbecome rotten bones. Where are the lords of high degree? They have\r\nall died. Where are Korah and Haman? Where is Sheddad, the son of\r\nAdd? Where are Canaan and Pharaoh? God hath _cut them off_, and it is\r\nhe who cutteth short the lives of mankind, and he hath made the\r\nmansions to be void for their presence. . . . I am Tadmor, the\r\ndaughter of the king of the Amalekites, of those who ruled the\r\ncountries with equity: I possessed what none of the kings possessed,\"\r\n(i. e., in extent of dominion,) \"and ruled with justice, and acted\r\nimpartially toward my subjects; I gave and bestowed; and I lived a\r\nlongtime in the enjoyment of happiness and an easy life, and\r\nemancipated both female and male slaves. Thus I did until _the\r\nsummoner of death came, and disasters occurred before me_. And the\r\ncause was this: _Seven years_ in succession came upon us, _during\r\nwhich no water descended on us from heaven, nor did any grass grow\r\nfor us on the face of the earth_. So we ate what food we had in our\r\ndwellings, and after that we fell upon the beasts and ate, and there\r\nremained nothing. Upon this, therefore, I caused the wealth to be\r\nbrought, and meted it with a measure, and sent it, by trusty men, who\r\nwent about with it through _all regions_, not leaving unvisited a\r\nsingle large city, to seek for some food. _But they found it not_,\r\nand they returned to us with the wealth after a long absence. So,\r\nthereupon we exposed to view our riches and our treasures, locked the\r\ngates of the fortresses in our city, and submitted ourselves to the\r\ndecrees of our Lord; and thus we all died, as thou beholdest, and\r\nleft what we had built and what we had treasured.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 275}\r\n\r\nAnd this strange tale has relations to all the other legends.\r\n\r\nHere we have the great demon, darting fire, blazing, smoking, the\r\ndestructive one; the rebel against the good God. He is overthrown by\r\nthe bright-shining one, Dimiriat, the same as the Dev-Mrityu of the\r\nHindoos; he and his forces are cut to pieces, and scattered over the\r\nland, and he, after being chased for months through space, is\r\ncaptured and chained. Associated with all this is a people of the\r\nBronze Age--a highly civilized people; a people living on an island\r\nin the Western Sea, who perished by a calamity which came on them\r\nsuddenly; \"a summoner of death\" came and brought disasters; and then\r\nfollowed a long period of terrible heat and drought, in which not\r\nthey alone, but all nations and cities, were starved by the drying up\r\nof the earth. The demon had devoured the cows-the clouds; like Cacus,\r\nhe had dragged them backward into his den, and no Hercules, no Indra,\r\nhad arisen to hurl the electric bolt that was to kill the heat,\r\nrestore the clouds, and bring upon the parched earth the grateful\r\nrain. And so this Bronze-Age race spread out their useless treasures\r\nto the sun, and, despite their miseries, they praise the God of gods,\r\nthe Cause of causes, the merciful, the compassionate, and lie down to\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nAnd in the evil-one, captured and chained and sealed by Solomon, we\r\nseem to have the same thing prefigured in Revelation, xx, 2:\r\n\r\n\"2. And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the\r\ndevil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.\r\n\r\n\"3. And he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set\r\na seal upon him, that he should no more seduce the nations.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 276}\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                           THE BOOK OF JOB.\r\n\r\nWE are told in the Bible (Job, i, 16)--\r\n\r\n\"While he [Job] was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,\r\n_The fire of God is fallen from heaven_ and hath burned up the sheep,\r\nand the servants, and _consumed them_, and I only am escaped alone to\r\ntell thee.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in verse 18 we are told--\r\n\r\n\"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy\r\nsons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest\r\nbrother's house:\r\n\r\n\"19. And behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and\r\nsmote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men,\r\nand they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.\"\r\n\r\nWe have here the record of a great convulsion. Fire fell from heaven;\r\nthe fire of God. It was not lightning, for it killed the seven\r\nthousand sheep, (see chap. i, 3,) belonging to Job, and all his\r\nshepherds; and not only killed but consumed them--burned them up. A\r\nfire falling from heaven great enough to kill seven thousand sheep\r\nmust have been an extensive conflagration, extending over a large\r\narea of country. And it seems to have been accompanied by a great\r\nwind--a cyclone--which killed all Job's sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nHas the book of Job anything to do with that great event which we\r\nhave been discussing? Did it originate out of it? Let us see.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is, I believe, conceded by the foremost\r\n\r\n{p. 277}\r\n\r\nscholars that the book of Job is not a Hebrew work; it was not\r\nwritten by Moses; it far antedates even the time of Abraham.\r\n\r\nThat very high orthodox authority, George Smith, F. S. A., in his\r\nwork shows that--\r\n\r\n\"Everything relating to this patriarch has been violently\r\ncontroverted. His country; the age in which he lived; the author of\r\nthe book that bears his name; have all been fruitful themes of\r\ndiscord, and, as if to confound confusion, these disputants are\r\ninterrupted by others, who would maintain that no such person ever\r\nexisted; that the whole tale is a poetic fiction, an allegory!\"[1]\r\n\r\nJob lived to be two hundred years old, or, according to the\r\nSeptuagint, four hundred. This great age relegates him to the era of\r\nthe antediluvians, or their immediate descendants, among whom such\r\nextreme ages were said to have been common.\r\n\r\nC. S. Bryant says:\r\n\r\n\"Job is in the purest Hebrew. The author uses only the word _Elohim_\r\nfor the name of God. The compiler or reviser of the work, Moses, or\r\nwhoever he was, employed at the heads of chapters and in the\r\nintroductory and concluding portions the name of _Jehovah_; but all\r\nthe verses where _Jehovah_ occurs, in Job, are later interpolations\r\nin a very old poem, written at a time when the Semitic race had no\r\nother name for God but _Elohim_; before Moses obtained the elements\r\nof the new name from Egypt.\"[2]\r\n\r\nHale says:\r\n\r\n\"The cardinal constellations of spring and autumn, in Job's time,\r\nwere _Chima_ and _Chesil_, or Taurus and Scorpio, of which the\r\nprincipal stars are Aldebaran, the Bull's Eye, and Antare, the\r\nScorpion's Heart. Knowing, therefore, the longitudes of these stars\r\nat present, the interval\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Patriarchal Age,\" vol. i, p. 351.\r\n\r\n2. MS. letter to the author, from C. S. Bryant, St. Paul, Minnesota.]\r\n\r\n{p. 278}\r\n\r\nof time from thence to the assumed date of Job's trial will give the\r\ndifference of these longitudes, and ascertain their positions then\r\nwith respect to the vernal and equinoctial points of intersection of\r\nthe equinoctial and ecliptic; according to the usual rate of the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes, one degree in seventy-one years and a\r\nhalf.\"[1]\r\n\r\nA careful calculation, based on these principles, has proved that\r\nthis period was 2338 B. C. According to the Septuagint, in the\r\nopinion of George Smith, Job lived, or the book of Job was written,\r\nfrom 2650 B. C. to 2250 B. C. Or the events described may have\r\noccurred 25,740 years before that date.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that the book of Job was written, even\r\naccording to the calculations of the orthodox, long before the time\r\nof Abraham, the founder of the Jewish nation, and hence could not\r\nhave been the work of Moses or any other Hebrew. Mr. Smith thinks\r\nthat it was produced _soon after the Flood_, by an Arabian. He finds\r\nin it many proofs of great antiquity. He sees in it (xxxi, 26, 28)\r\nproof that in Job's time idolatry was an offense under the laws, and\r\npunishable as such; and he is satisfied that all the parties to the\r\ngreat dialogue were free from the taint of idolatry. Mr. Smith says:\r\n\r\n\"The Babylonians, Chaldeans, Egyptians, Canaanites, Midianites,\r\nEthiopians of Abyssinia, Syrians, and other contemporary nations, had\r\nsunk into gross idolatry long before the time of Moses.\"\r\n\r\nThe Arabians were an important branch of the great Atlantean stock;\r\nthey derived their descent from the people of Add.\r\n\r\n\"And to this day the Arabians declare that _the father of Job was the\r\nfounder of the great Arabian people_.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[1. Hale's \"Chronology,\" vol. ii, p. 55.\r\n\r\n2. Smith's \"Sacred Annals,\" vol. i, p. 360.]\r\n\r\n{p. 279}\r\n\r\nAgain, the same author says:\r\n\r\n\"Job acted as high-priest in his own family; and, minute as are the\r\ndescriptions of the different classes and usages of society in this\r\nbook, we have not the slightest allusion to the existence of any\r\npriests or specially appointed ministers of religion, _a fact which\r\nshows the extreme antiquity of the period_, as priests were, in all\r\nprobability, first appointed about the time of Abraham, and became\r\ngeneral soon after.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHe might have added that priests were known among the Egyptians and\r\nBabylonians and Ph&oelig;nicians from the very beginning of their\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nDr. Magee says:\r\n\r\n\"If, in short, there be on the whole, that genuine air of the antique\r\nwhich those distinguished scholars, Schultens, Lowth, and Michaelis,\r\naffirm in every respect to pervade the work, we can scarcely hesitate\r\nto pronounce, with Lowth and Sherlock, that _the book of Job is the\r\noldest in the world now extant_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is evident that this ancient hero, although he probably\r\nlived before Babylon and Assyria, before Troy was known, before\r\nGreece had a name, nevertheless dwelt in the midst of a high\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n\"The various arts, the most recondite sciences, the most remarkable\r\nproductions of earth, in respect of animals, vegetables, and\r\nminerals, the classified arrangement of the stars of heaven, are all\r\nnoticed.\"\r\n\r\nNot only did Job's people possess an alphabet, but books were\r\nwritten, characters were engraved; and some have even gone so far as\r\nto claim that the art of printing was known, because Job says, \"Would\r\nthat my words were printed in a book!\"\r\n\r\n[1. Smith's \"Sacred Annals,\" p. 364.\r\n\r\n2. Magee \"On the Atonement,\" vol. ii, p. 84.]\r\n\r\n{p. 280}\r\n\r\nThe literary excellence of the work is of the highest order. Lowth\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The antiquary, or the critic, who has been at the pains to trace the\r\nhistory of the Grecian drama from its first weak and imperfect\r\nefforts, and has carefully observed its tardy progress to perfection,\r\nwill scarcely, I think, without astonishment, contemplate a poem\r\nproduced so many ages before, so elegant in its design, so regular in\r\nits structure, so animated, so affecting, so near to the true\r\ndramatic model; while, on the contrary, the united wisdom of Greece,\r\nafter ages of study, was not able to produce anything approaching to\r\nperfection in this walk of poetry before the time of Æschylus.\"[1]\r\n\r\nSmith says:\r\n\r\n\"The debate rises high above earthly things; the way and will and\r\nprovidential dealings of God are investigated. All this is done with\r\nthe greatest propriety, with the most consummate skill; and,\r\nnotwithstanding the expression of some erroneous opinions, all is\r\nunder the influence of a devout and sanctified temper of mind.\"[2]\r\n\r\nHas this most ancient, wonderful, and lofty work, breathing the\r\nspirit of primeval times, its origin lost in the night of ages,\r\ntestifying to a high civilization and a higher moral development, has\r\nit anything to do with that event which lay far beyond the Flood?\r\n\r\nIf it is a drama of Atlantean times, it must have passed through many\r\nhands, through many ages, through many tongues, before it reached the\r\nIsraelites. We may expect its original meaning, therefore, to appear\r\nthrough it only like the light through clouds; we may expect that\r\nlater generations would modify it with local names and allusions; we\r\nmay expect that they would even strike out parts whose meaning they\r\nfailed to understand, and\r\n\r\n[1. \"Hebrew Poetry,\" lecture xxxiii.\r\n\r\n2. \"Sacred Annals,\" vol. i, p. 365.]\r\n\r\n{p. 281}\r\n\r\ninterpolate others. It is believed that the opening and closing parts\r\nare additions made in a subsequent age. If they could not comprehend\r\nhow the fire from heaven and the whirlwind could have so utterly\r\ndestroyed Job's sheep, servants, property, and family, they would\r\nbring in those desert accessories, Sabæan and Chaldean robbers, to\r\ncarry away the camels and the oxen.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of the whole poem?\r\n\r\nGod gives over the government of the world for a time to Satan, to\r\nwork his devilish will upon Job. Did not God do this very thing when\r\nhe permitted the comet to strike the earth? Satan in Arabic means a\r\nserpent. \"Going to and fro\" means in the Arabic in \"the heat of haste\r\n\"; Umbreit translates it, \"from _a flight over the earth_.\"\r\n\r\nJob may mean a man, a tribe, or a whole nation.\r\n\r\nFrom a condition of great prosperity Job is stricken down, in an\r\ninstant, to the utmost depths of poverty and distress; and the chief\r\nagency is \"fire from heaven\" and great wind-storms.\r\n\r\nDoes this typify the fate of the world when the great catastrophe\r\noccurred? Does the debate between Job and his three visitors\r\nrepresent the discussion which took place in the hearts of the\r\nmiserable remnants of mankind, as they lay hid in caverns, touching\r\nGod, his power, his goodness, his justice; and whether or not this\r\nworld-appalling calamity was the result of the sins of the people or\r\notherwise?\r\n\r\nLet us see what glimpses of these things we can find in the text of\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\nWhen Job's afflictions fall upon him he curses his day--the day, as\r\ncommonly understood, wherein he was born. But how can one curse a\r\npast period of time and ask the darkness to cover it?\r\n\r\n{p. 282}\r\n\r\nThe original text is probably a reference to the events that were\r\n_then_ transpiring:\r\n\r\n\"Let that day _be turned into darkness_; let not God regard it from\r\nabove; and _let not the light shine upon it_. Let darkness and the\r\n_shadow of death cover it;_ let a mist overspread it, and let it be\r\nwrapped up in bitterness. _Let a darksome whirlwind_ seize upon that\r\nnight. . . . Let them curse it who curse the clay, who are _ready to\r\nraise up a leviathan_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nDe Dieu says it should read, \"And thou, leviathan, rouse up.\" \"Let a\r\nmist overspread it\"; literally, \"let a gathered mass of dark clouds\r\ncover it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Fathers generally understand the devil to be meant by the\r\nleviathan.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall see that it means the fiery dragon, the comet:\r\n\r\n\"Let the stars be darkened _with the mist thereof;_ let it _expect\r\nlight and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIn other words, Job is not imprecating future evils on a past\r\ntime--an impossibility, an absurdity: he is describing the events\r\nthen transpiring--the whirlwind, the darkness, the mist, the day that\r\ndoes not come, and the leviathan, the demon, the comet.\r\n\r\nJob seems to regret that he has escaped with his life:\r\n\r\n\"For now,\" he says, \"_should I have lain still and been quiet_,\" (if\r\nI had not fled) \"I should have slept: then had I been at rest, with\r\nkings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for\r\nthemselves; or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses\r\nwith silver.\"[3]\r\n\r\nJob looks out over the whole world, swept bare of its inhabitants,\r\nand regrets that he did not stay and bide the\r\n\r\n[1. Douay version, chapter iii, verses 4-8.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., verse 9.\r\n\r\n3. King James's version, chapter iii, verses 18-15.]\r\n\r\n{p. 283}\r\n\r\npelting of the pitiless storm, as, if he had done so, he would be now\r\nlying dead with kings and counselors, who built places for\r\nthemselves, now made desolate, and with princes who, despite their\r\ngold and silver, have perished. Kings and counselors do not build\r\n\"desolate places\" for themselves; they build in the heart of great\r\ncommunities; in the midst of populations: the places may become\r\ndesolate afterward.\r\n\r\nEliphaz the Temanite seems to think that the sufferings of men are\r\ndue to their sins. He says:\r\n\r\nEven _as I have seen_, they that plough wickedness and sow\r\nwickedness, reap the same. _By the blast of God they perish, and by\r\nthe breath of his nostrils are they consumed_. The roaring of the\r\nlion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young\r\nlions are broken. _The old lion perisheth for lack of prey_, and the\r\nstout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly, this seems to be a picture of a great event. Here again\r\nthe fire of God, that consumed Job's sheep and servants, is at work;\r\neven the fiercest of the wild beasts are suffering: the old lion dies\r\nfor want of prey, and its young ones are scattered abroad.\r\n\r\nEliphaz continues:\r\n\r\n\"In thoughts, from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth\r\non me, _fear came upon me_, and trembling, which made all my bones to\r\nshake. Then a spirit _passed before my face_, the hair of my flesh\r\nstood up.\"\r\n\r\nA voice spake:\r\n\r\n\"Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure\r\nthan his Maker? Behold he put no trust in his servants, and his\r\nangels he charged with folly: How much less them that dwell in houses\r\nof clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before\r\nthe moth. _They are destroyed from morning to evening; they perish\r\nforever without any regarding it_.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 284}\r\n\r\nThe moth can crush nothing, therefore Maurer thinks it should read,\r\n\"crushed like the moth.\" \"They are destroyed,\" etc.; literally, \"they\r\nare _broken to pieces in the space of a day_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAll through the text of Job we have allusions to the catastrophe\r\nwhich had fallen on the earth (chap. v, 3):\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I,\" (God,) \"cursed\r\nhis habitation.\"\r\n\r\n\"4. His children are far from safety,\" (far from any place of\r\nrefuge?) \"and they are _crushed in the gate_, neither is there any to\r\ndeliver them.\r\n\r\n\"5. Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the\r\nthorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, in the general confusion and terror the harvests are\r\ndevoured, and there is no respect for the rights of property.\r\n\r\n\"6. Although affliction _cometh not forth of the dust_, neither doth\r\ntrouble _spring out of the ground_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Douay version it reads:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing on earth is done without a cause, and sorrow doth not spring\r\nout of the ground\" (v, 6).\r\n\r\nI take this to mean that the affliction which has fallen upon men\r\ncomes not out of the ground, but from above.\r\n\r\n\"7. Yet man is born unto trouble, _as the sparks fly upward_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Hebrew we read for sparks, \"sons of _flame_ or burning coal.\"\r\nMaurer and Gesenius say, \"As the sons of lightning fly high\"; or,\r\n\"troubles are many and fiery as sparks.\"\r\n\r\n[1. Faussett's \"Commentary,\" iii, 40.]\r\n\r\n{p. 285}\r\n\r\n\"8. I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause;\r\n\r\n\"9. Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things\r\nwithout number:\r\n\r\n10. Who _giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the\r\nfields_.\"\r\n\r\nRain here signifies the great floods which cover the earth.\r\n\r\n\"11. To set up _on high_ those that be low; that those which mourn\r\nmay be _exalted to safety_.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the poor escape to the high places--to safety--while\r\nthe great and crafty perish.\r\n\r\n\"12. He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands\r\ncan not perform their enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"13. He taketh the wise in their own craftiness,\" (that is, in the\r\nvery midst of their planning,) \"and the counsel of the froward is\r\n_carried headlong_,\" (that is, it is instantly overwhelmed).\r\n\r\n\"14. They MEET WITH DARKNESS IN THE DAY-TIME, and _grope in the\r\nnoonday as in the night_.\" (Chap. v.)\r\n\r\nSurely all this is extraordinary--the troubles of mankind come from\r\nabove, not from the earth; the children of the wicked are crushed in\r\nthe gate, far from places of refuge; the houses of the wicked are\r\n\"crushed before the moth,\" those that plow wickedness perish,\" by the\r\n\"blast of God's nostrils they are consumed\"; the old lion perishes\r\nfor want of prey, and its whelps are scattered abroad. Eliphaz sees a\r\nvision, (the comet,) which \"makes his bones to shake, and the hair of\r\nhis flesh to stand up\"; the people \"are destroyed from morning to\r\nevening\"; the cunning find their craft of no avail, but are taken;\r\nthe counsel of the froward is carried headlong; the poor find safety\r\nin high places; and darkness comes in midday, so that the people\r\ngrope their way;\r\n\r\n{p. 286}\r\n\r\nand Job's children, servants, and animals are destroyed by a fire\r\nfrom heaven, and by a great wind.\r\n\r\nEliphaz, like the priests in the Aztec legend, thinks he sees in all\r\nthis the chastening hand of God:\r\n\r\n\"17. Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise\r\nnot thou the chastening of the Almighty:\r\n\r\n\"18. For he _maketh sore_, and bindeth up: he _woundeth_, and his\r\nhands make whole.\" (Chap. v.)\r\n\r\nWe are reminded of the Aztec prayer, where allusion is made to the\r\nwounded and sick in the cave \"whose mouths were full of _earth_ and\r\nscurf.\" Doubtless, thousands were crushed, and cut, and wounded by\r\nthe falling stones, or burned by the fire, and some of them were\r\ncarried by relatives and friends, or found their own way, to the\r\nshelter of the caverns.\r\n\r\n\"20. In _famine_ he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the\r\npower of the sword.\r\n\r\n\"21. _Thou shalt be hid_ from the scourge of the tongue: neither\r\nshalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.\" (Chap. v.)\r\n\r\n\"The scourge of the tongue\" has no meaning in this context. There has\r\nprobably been a mistranslation at some stage of the history of the\r\npoem. The idea is, probably, \"You are hid in safety from the scourge\r\nof the comet, from the tongues of flame; you need not be afraid of\r\nthe destruction that is raging without.\"\r\n\r\n\"22. At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be\r\nafraid of the beasts of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"23. For thou shalt be in league with THE STONES OF THE FIELD: and\r\nthe beasts of the field shall _be at peace with thee_.\" (Chap. v.)\r\n\r\nThat is to say, as in the Aztec legend, the stones of the field have\r\nkilled some of the beasts if the earth, \"the lions have perished,\"\r\nand their whelps have been scattered;\r\n\r\n{p. 287}\r\n\r\nthe stones have thus been your friends; and other beasts have fled\r\nwith you into these caverns, as in the Navajo tradition, where you\r\nmay be able, living upon them, to defy famine.\r\n\r\nNow it may be said that all this is a strained construction; but what\r\nconstruction can be substituted that will make sense of these\r\nallusions? How can the stones of the field be in league with man? How\r\ndoes the ordinary summer rain falling on the earth set up the low and\r\ndestroy the wealthy? And what has all this to do with a darkness that\r\ncometh in the day-time in which the wicked grope helplessly?\r\n\r\nBut the allusions continue\r\n\r\nJob cries out, in the next chapter (chap. vi)\r\n\r\n\"2. Oh that my grief\" (my sins whereby I deserved wrath) \"were\r\nthoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!\r\n\r\n3. _As the sands of the sea this would appear heavier_, therefore my\r\nwords are full of sorrow. (Douay version.)\r\n\r\n'14. For the _arrows of the Almighty are within_ me, the poison\r\nwhereof drinketh up my spirit; _the terrors of God do set themselves\r\nin array against me_\" (\"war against me\"-Douay ver.).\r\n\r\nThat is to say, disaster comes down heavier than the sands--the\r\ngravel of the sea; I am wounded; the arrows of God, the darts of\r\nfire, have stricken me. We find in the American legends the\r\ndescending _débris_ constantly alluded to as \"stones, arrows, and\r\nspears\"; I am poisoned with the foul exhalations of the comet; the\r\nterrors of God are arrayed against me. All this is comprehensible as\r\na description of a great disaster of nature, but it is extravagant\r\nlanguage to apply to a mere case of boils.\r\n\r\n\"9. Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let\r\nloose his hand and cut me off.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 288}\r\n\r\nThe commentators say that \"to destroy me\" means literally \"to grind\r\nor crush me.\" (Chap. vi.)\r\n\r\nJob despairs of final escape:\r\n\r\n\"11. What is my strength that I can hold out? And what is I end that\r\nI should keep patience?\" (Douay.)\r\n\r\n\"12 . Is my strength the _strength of stones?_ Or is my flesh of\r\nbrass? \"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, how can I ever bold out? How can I ever survive this\r\ngreat tempest? How can my strength stand the crushing of these\r\nstones? Is my flesh brass, that it will not burn up? Can I live in a\r\nworld where such things are to continue?\r\n\r\nAnd here follow allusions which are remarkable as occurring in an\r\nArabian composition, in a land of torrid beats:\r\n\r\n\"15. My brethren\" (my fellow-men) \"have dealt deceitfully\" (have\r\nsinned) \"as a brook, and as the stream of brooks _they pass away_.\r\n\r\n16. Which are blackish _by reason of the ice_, and wherein _the snow\r\nis hid_.\r\n\r\n\"17. What time they wax _warm_, they vanish: when it is hot, they\r\n_are consumed out of their place_.\r\n\r\n18. The paths of their way are turned aside; they _go to nothing and\r\nperish_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Douay version has it:\r\n\r\n\"16. They\" (the people) \"that fear the hoary frost, _the snow shall\r\nfall upon them_.\r\n\r\n\"17. At the time _when they shall be scattered they shall perish;_\r\nand after it _groweth hot they shall be melted out of their place_.\r\n\r\n\"18. The paths of their steps are entangled; _they shall walk in vain\r\nand shall perish_.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of perishing here--some by frost and snow, some\r\nby heat; the people are scattered, they lose their way, they perish.\r\n\r\n{p. 289}\r\n\r\nJob's servants and sheep were also consumed in their place; _they_\r\ncame to naught, _they_ perished.\r\n\r\nJob begins to think, like the Aztec priest, that possibly the human\r\nrace has reached its limit and is doomed to annihilation (chap. vii):\r\n\r\n\"1. Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? Are not his\r\ndays also like the days of an hireling?\"\r\n\r\nIs it not time to discharge the race from its labors?\r\n\r\n\"4. When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, _and the night be\r\ngone?_ and I am full of tossings to and fro unto _the dawning of the\r\nday_.\"\r\n\r\nHe draws a picture of his hopeless condition, shut up in the cavern,\r\nnever to see the light of day again. (Douay ver., chap. vii):\r\n\r\n\"12: Am I sea or a whale, _that thou hast inclosed me in a prison?_\"\r\n\r\n\"7. My eyes _shall not return to see good things_.\r\n\r\n\"8. Nor shall the sight of man behold me; thy eyes are upon me, and I\r\nshall be no more\"; (or, as one translates it, thy mercy shall come\r\ntoo late when I shall be no more.)\r\n\r\n\"9. As a cloud is consumed and passeth away, so he that shall go down\r\nto hell\" (or the grave, the cavern) shall not come up.\r\n\r\n\"10. Nor shall he return any more into his house, neither shall his\r\nplace know him any more.\"\r\n\r\nHow strikingly does this remind one of the Druid legend, given on\r\npage 135, _ante_:\r\n\r\n\"The profligacy of mankind had provoked the Great Supreme to send a\r\npestilential wind upon the earth. A pure poison descended, every\r\nblast was death. At this time the patriarch, _distinguished for his\r\nintegrity_, was _shut up, together with his select company_, in the\r\ninclosure with the strong door. Here the just ones were safe from\r\ninjury. Presently a tempest of fire arose,\" etc.\r\n\r\n{p. 290}\r\n\r\nWho can doubt that these widely separated legends refer to the same\r\nevent and the same patriarch?\r\n\r\nJob meditates suicide, just as we have seen in the American legends\r\nthat hundreds slew themselves under the terror of the time:\r\n\r\n\"21. For now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the\r\nmorning, but I shall not be.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chaldaic version gives us the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of\r\nchapter viii as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the\r\ngrass, and the flower thereof faileth, and the grace of the fashion\r\nof it perisheth, so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Job refers to the power of God, seeming to paint the\r\ncataclysm (chap. ix):\r\n\r\n\"5. Which _removeth the mountains_, and they know not which\r\n_overturneth them in his anger_.\r\n\r\n\"6. Which _shaketh the earth out of her place_, and the _pillars\r\nthereof_ tremble.\r\n\r\n\"7. Which commandeth the sun, _and it riseth not; and sealeth up the\r\nstars_.\r\n\r\n\"8. Which alone spreadeth out the heavens and _treadeth upon the\r\nwaves of the sea_.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is most remarkable: here is the delineation of a great\r\ncatastrophe--the mountains are removed and leveled; the earth shakes\r\nto its foundations; the sun _fails to appear_, and the stars are\r\nsealed up. How? In the dense masses of clouds?\r\n\r\nSurely this does not describe the ordinary manifestations of God's\r\npower. When has the sun refused to rise? It can not refer to the\r\nstory of Joshua, for in that case the sun was in the heavens and\r\nrefrained from setting; and Joshua's time was long subsequent to that\r\nof Job. But when we take this in connection with the fire\r\n\r\n{p. 291}\r\n\r\nfalling from heaven, the great wind, the destruction of men and\r\nanimals, the darkness that came at midday, the ice and snow and sands\r\nof the sea, and the stones of the field, and the fact that Job is\r\nshut up as in a prison, never to return to his home or to the light\r\nof day, we see that peering through the little-understood context of\r\nthis most ancient poem are the disjointed reminiscences of the age of\r\nfire and gravel. It sounds like the cry not of a man but of a race, a\r\ngreat, religious, civilized race, who could not understand how God\r\ncould so cruelly visit the world; and out of their misery and their\r\nterror sent up this pitiful yet sublime appeal for mercy.\r\n\r\n\"13. If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop\r\nunder him.\"\r\n\r\nOne commentator makes this read:\r\n\r\n\"Under him the whales below heaven bend,\" (the crooked leviathan?)\r\n\r\n\"17. For he shall crush me in a _whirlwind_, and multiplieth my\r\nwounds even without cause.\" (Douay ver.)\r\n\r\nAnd Job can not recognize the doctrine of a special providence; he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"22. This is one thing\" (therefore I said it). \"He _destroyeth the\r\nperfect and the wicked_.\r\n\r\n\"23. If the _scourge slay suddenly_, he will laugh at the trial of\r\nthe innocent.\r\n\r\n\"24. The earth _is given into the hands of the wicked:_ he covereth\r\nthe faces of the judges thereof; if it be not him, who is it then?\"\r\n(Douay ver.)\r\n\r\nThat is to say, God has given up the earth to the power of Satan (as\r\nappears by chapter i); good and bad perish together; and the evil one\r\nlaughs as the scourge (the comet) slays suddenly the innocent ones;\r\nthe very judges who should have enforced justice are dead, and\r\n\r\n{p. 292}\r\n\r\ntheir faces covered with dust and ashes. And if God has not done this\r\nterrible deed, who has done it?\r\n\r\nAnd Job rebels against such a state of things\r\n\r\n\"34. Let him take his _rod away from me_, and let not his fear\r\nterrify me.\r\n\r\n\"35. Then I would speak to him and not fear him but it is not so with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nWhat rod--what fear? Surely not the mere physical affliction which is\r\npopularly supposed to have constituted Job's chief grievance. Is the\r\n\"rod\" that terrifies Job so that he fears to speak, that great object\r\nwhich cleft the heavens; that curved wolf-jaw of the Goths, one end\r\nof which rested on the earth while the other touched the sun? Is it\r\nthe great sword of Surt?\r\n\r\nAnd here we have another (chap. x) allusion to the \"darkness,\"\r\nalthough in our version it is applied to death:\r\n\r\n\"21. Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of\r\ndarkness and the shadow of death.\r\n\r\n\"22. A _land of darkness_ as darkness itself, and of the shadow of\r\ndeath, _without any order_, and _where the light is as darkness_.\"\r\n\r\nOr, as the Douay version has it:\r\n\r\n\"21. Before I go, and return no more, to _a land that is dark and\r\ncovered with the mist of death_.\r\n\r\n\"22. A land of misery and darkness, where the shadow of death, and no\r\norder but _everlasting horror dwelleth_.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not death; death is a place of peace, \"where the wicked\r\nceased from troubling \"; this is a description of the chaotic\r\ncondition of things on the earth outside the cave, \"without any\r\norder,\" and where even the feeble light of day is little better than\r\ntotal darkness. Job thinks he might just as well go out into this\r\ndreadful world and end it all.\r\n\r\nZophar argues (chap. xi) that all these things have\r\n\r\n{p. 293}\r\n\r\ncome because of the wickedness of the people, and that it is all\r\nright:\r\n\r\n\"10. If he _cut off_ and _shut up_ and _gather together_, who can\r\nhinder him?\r\n\r\n\"11. For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not\r\nthen consider it?\r\n\r\n\"If he cut off,\" the commentators say, means literally, \"If he pass\r\nby as a storm.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, if he cuts off the people, (kills them by the\r\nmillion,) and shuts up a few in caves, as Job was shut up in prison,\r\ngathered together from the storm, how are _you_ going to help it?\r\nHath he not seen the vanity and wickedness of man?\r\n\r\nAnd Zophar tells Job to hope, to pray to God, and that he will yet\r\nescape:\r\n\r\n\"16. Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it _as waters\r\nthat pass away_.\r\n\r\n\"17. And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt\r\nshine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt shine forth\" Gesenius renders, \"though _now thou art in\r\ndarkness_ thou shalt presently be as the morning\"; that is, the storm\r\nwill pass and the light return. Umbreit gives it, \"Thy darkness shall\r\nbe as the morning; only the darkness of morning twilight, not\r\nnocturnal darkness.\" That is, Job will return to that dim light which\r\nfollowed the Drift Age.\r\n\r\n\"18. And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, _thou\r\nshalt dig_ about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, when the waters pass away, with them shall pass away\r\nthy miseries; the sun shall yet return brighter than ever; thou shalt\r\nbe secure; thou shalt _dig thy way out of these caverns;_ and then\r\ntake thy rest in\r\n\r\n{p. 294}\r\n\r\nsafety, for the great tempest shall have passed for ever. We are told\r\nby the commentators that the words \"about thee\" are an interpolation.\r\n\r\nIf this is not the interpretation, for what would Job dig about him?\r\nWhat relation can digging have with the disease which afflicted Job?\r\n\r\nBut Job refuses to receive this consolation. He refuses to believe\r\nthat the tower of Siloam fell only on the wickedest men in the city.\r\nHe refers to his past experience of mankind. He thinks honest poverty\r\nis without honor at the hands of successful fraud. He says (chap.\r\nxii):\r\n\r\n\"5. He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp _despised in\r\nthe thought of him that is at ease_.\"\r\n\r\nBut--\r\n\r\n\"6. The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are\r\nsecure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he can not see how, if this calamity has come upon men for their\r\nsins, that the innocent birds and beasts, and even the fish in the\r\nheated and poisoned waters, are perishing:\r\n\r\n\"7. But ask now the beasts,\" (\"for verily,\" he has just said, \"ye are\r\nthe men, and wisdom will die with you,\") \"and _they_ shall teach\r\nthee; and the fowls of the air, and _they_ shall tell thee:\r\n\r\n\"8. Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of\r\nthe sea shall declare it unto thee.\r\n\r\n\"9. Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the Lord hath\r\nwrought this?\"\r\n\r\nWrought what? Job's disease? No. Some great catastrophe to bird and\r\nbeast and earth.\r\n\r\nYou pretend, he says, in effect, ye wise men, that only the wicked\r\nhave suffered; but it is not so, for aforetime I have seen the honest\r\npoor man despised and the villain\r\n\r\n{p. 295}\r\n\r\nprosperous. And if the sins of men have brought this catastrophe on\r\nthe earth, go ask the beasts and the birds and the fish and the very\r\nface of the suffering earth, what they have done to provoke this\r\nwrath. No, it is the work of God, and of God alone, and he gives and\r\nwill give no reason for it.\r\n\r\n\"14. Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built up again; _he\r\nshutteth up a man_, and there can be no opening.\r\n\r\n\"15. Behold, _he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up:_ also, he\r\nsendeth them out, and _they overturn the earth_.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the heat of the fire from heaven sucks up the waters\r\nuntil rivers and lakes are dried up: Cacus steals the cows of\r\nHercules; and then again they fall, deluging and overturning the\r\nearth, piling it into Mountains in one place, says the Tupi legend,\r\nand digging out valleys in another. And God buries men in the caves\r\nin which they sought shelter.\r\n\r\n\"23. He increaseth the nations, _and destroyeth them:_ he enlargeth\r\nthe nations, and straiteneth them again.\r\n\r\n\"24. He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the\r\nearth, and causeth them to wander _in a wilderness where there is no\r\nway_.\r\n\r\n\"25. _They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to\r\nstagger like a drunken man_.\"\r\n\r\nMore darkness, more groping in the dark, more of that staggering like\r\ndrunken men, described in the American legends:\r\n\r\n\"Lo, mine eye,\" says Job, (xiii, 1,) \"_hath seen all this, mine ear\r\nhath heard_ and understood it. What ye know, the same do I know also.\"\r\n\r\nWe have all seen it, says Job, and now you would come here with your\r\nplatitudes about God sending all this to punish the wicked:\r\n\r\n{p. 296}\r\n\r\n\"4. But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.\"\r\n\r\nHonest Job is disgusted, and denounces his counselors with Carlylean\r\nvigor:\r\n\r\n\"11. Shall not his excellency make you afraid? _and his dread fall\r\nupon you?_\r\n\r\n\"12. Your remembrances are like unto _ashes_, your bodies to bodies\r\nof _clay_.\r\n\r\n\"13. Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on\r\nme what will.\r\n\r\n\"14. Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in\r\nmine hand?\r\n\r\n\"15. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain\r\nmine own ways before him.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, I don't think this thing is right, and, though I tear\r\nmy flesh with my teeth, and contemplate suicide, and though I may be\r\nslain for speaking, yet I will speak out, and maintain that God ought\r\nnot to have done this thing; he ought not to have sent this horrible\r\naffliction on the earth--this fire from heaven, which burned up my\r\ncattle; this whirlwind which slew my children; this sand of the sea;\r\nthis rush of floods; this darkness in noonday in which mankind grope\r\nhelplessly; these arrows, this poison, this rush of waters, this\r\nsweeping away of mountains.\r\n\r\n\"If I hold my tongue,\" says Job, \"I shall give up the ghost!\"\r\n\r\nJob believes--\r\n\r\n             \"The grief that will not speak,\r\n     Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break.\"\r\n\r\n\"As _the waters fail from the sea_,\" says Job, (xiv, 11,) and the\r\nflood _decayeth and drieth up:_\r\n\r\n\"12. So man _lieth down, and riseth not:_ till the heavens be no\r\nmore, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.\r\n\r\n{p. 297}\r\n\r\n13. O that thou wouldest _hide me_ in the grave, that thou wouldest\r\nkeep me secret, _until thy wrath be past_, that thou wouldest appoint\r\nme a set time, and _remember me!_\"\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? When in history have the waters failed from the\r\nsea? Job believes in the immortality of the soul (xix, 26): \"Though\r\nworms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.\" Can these\r\nwords then be of general application, and mean that those who lie\r\ndown and rise not shall not awake for ever? No; he is simply telling\r\nthat when the conflagration came and dried up the seas, it\r\nslaughtered the people by the million; they fell and perished, never\r\nto live again; and he calls on God to hide him in a grave, a tomb, a\r\ncavern--until the day of his wrath be past, and then to remember him,\r\nto come for him, to let him out.\r\n\r\n\"20. My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and _I am escaped\r\nwith the skin of my teeth_.\"\r\n\r\nEscaped from what? From his physical disease? No; he carried that\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nBut Zophar insists that there is a special providence in all these\r\nthings, and that only the wicked have perished (chap. xx):\r\n\r\n\"5. The triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the\r\nhypocrite but for a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"7. Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have\r\nseen him shall say, Where is be?\"\r\n\r\n16. He shall suck the _poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay\r\nhim_.\"\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\n\"23. When he is about to fill his belly, _God shall cast the fury of\r\nhis wrath upon him_, and shall RAIN IT UPON him, while he is eating.\r\n\r\n\"24. He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall\r\nstrike him through.\r\n\r\n{p. 298}\r\n\r\n\"25. It is drawn and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering\r\nsword\" (the comet?) \"cometh out of his gall: _terrors are upon him_.\r\n\r\n\"26. _All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not\r\nblown shall consume him_. . . .\r\n\r\n\"27. The heavens _shall reveal his iniquity;_ and _the earth shall\r\nrise up against him_.\r\n\r\n\"28. The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall\r\n_flow away_ in the day of his wrath.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does all this mean? While the rich man, (necessarily a wicked\r\nman,) is eating his dinner, God shall rain upon him a consuming fire,\r\na fire not blown by man; he shall be pierced by the arrows of God,\r\nthe earth shall quake under his feet, the heavens shall blaze forth\r\nhis iniquity; the darkness shall be hid, shall disappear, in the\r\nglare of the conflagration; and his substance shall flow away in the\r\nfloods of God's wrath.\r\n\r\nJob answers him in powerful language, maintaining from past\r\nexperience his position that the wicked ones do not suffer in this\r\nlife any more than the virtuous (chap. xxi):\r\n\r\n\"Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon\r\nthem. Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and\r\ncasteth not her calf. They send forth their little ones like a flock,\r\nand their children dance. They spend their days in wealth, and _in a\r\nmoment go down to the grave_. Therefore they say unto God, Depart\r\nfrom us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here we seem to have a description (chap. xvi, Douay ver.) of\r\nJob's contact with the comet:\r\n\r\n\"9. A false speaker riseth up against my face, contradicting me.\"\r\n\r\nThat is, Job had always proclaimed the goodness of God, and here\r\ncomes something altogether evil.\r\n\r\n{p. 299}\r\n\r\n\"10. He hath gathered together his fury against me; and threatening\r\nme he hath _gnashed with his teeth upon me:_ my enemy hath beheld me\r\n_with terrible_ eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"14. He has compassed me _round about with his lances_, he hath\r\nwounded my loins, he hath not spared, he hath poured out my bowels on\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n\"15. He hath torn me with _wound upon wound_, he hath rushed in upon\r\nme _like a giant_.\"\r\n\r\n\"20. For behold _my witness is in heaven_, and he that knoweth my\r\nconscience is on high.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to understand this as referring to a skin-disease,\r\nor even to the contradictions of Job's companions, Zophar, Bildad,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSomething rose up against Job that comes upon him with fury, gnashes\r\nhis teeth on him, glares at him with terrible eyes, surrounds him\r\nwith lances, wounds him in every part, and rushes upon him like a\r\ngiant; and the witness of the truth of Job's statement is there in\r\nthe heavens.\r\n\r\nEliphaz returns to the charge. He rebukes Job and charges him with\r\nmany sins and oppressions (chap. xxii):\r\n\r\n\"10. Therefore snares are around about thee, and _sudden fear\r\ntroubleth thee;_\r\n\r\n\"11. _Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters\r\ncover thee_.\"\r\n\r\n\"13. And thou sayest, How doth God know? Can he judge _through the\r\ndark cloud?_\r\n\r\n\"14. _Thick clouds are a covering to him_, that he seeth not and he\r\nwalketh in the circuit of heaven.\r\n\r\n15. Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?\r\n\r\n\"16. Which were cut down out of time, _whose foundation was overflown\r\nwith a flood?_\"\r\n\r\n\"20. Whereas our substance is not cut down, but _the remnant of them\r\nthe fire consumeth_.\"\r\n\r\n\"24. He shall give for earth _flint_, and for flint _torrents of\r\ngold_.\" (Douay ver.)\r\n\r\n{p. 300}\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of all this? And why this association of the\r\nflint-stones, referred to in so many legends; and the gold believed\r\nto have fallen from heaven in torrents, is it not all wonderful and\r\ninexplicable upon any other theory than that which I suggest?\r\n\r\n\"30. He shall deliver _the island of the innocent_: and it is\r\ndelivered by the pureness of thine \"(Job's) \"hands.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? Where was \"the island of the innocent\"? What was\r\nthe way which the wicked, who did not live on \"the island of the\r\ninnocent,\" had trodden, but which was swept away in the flood as the\r\nbridge Bifrost was destroyed, in the Gothic legends, by the forces of\r\nMuspelheim?\r\n\r\nAnd Job replies again (chap. xxiii):\r\n\r\n\"16. For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:\r\n\r\n\"17. _Because I was not cut off before the darkness_, neither hath he\r\ncovered the darkness from my face.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, why did I not die before this great calamity fell on\r\nthe earth, and before I saw it?\r\n\r\nJob continues (chap. xxvi):\r\n\r\n\"5. Dead things are formed from _under the waters_, and the\r\ninhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\n\"6. _Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering_.\r\n\r\nThe commentators tell us that the words, \"dead things are formed\r\nunder the waters,\" mean literally, \"the souls of the dead tremble\r\nfrom under the waters.\"\r\n\r\nIn all lands the home of the dead was, as I have shown elsewhere,[1]\r\nbeyond the waters: and just as we have seen in Ovid that Phaëton's\r\nconflagration burst open the earth\r\n\r\n[1. \"Atlantis,\" 359, 421, etc.]\r\n\r\n{p. 301}\r\n\r\nand disturbed the inhabitants of Tartarus; and in Hesiod's narrative\r\nthat the ghosts trembled around Pluto in his dread dominion; so here\r\nhell is laid bare by the great catastrophe, and the souls of the dead\r\nin the drowned Flood-land, beneath the waters, tremble.\r\n\r\nSurely, all these legends are fragments of one and the same great\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\"7. He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the\r\nearth upon nothing.\r\n\r\n\"8. _He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is\r\nnot rent under them_.\"\r\n\r\nThe clouds do not break with this unparalleled load of moisture.\r\n\r\n\"9. _He holdeth back the face of his throne_, and _spreadeth his\r\ncloud upon it_.\r\n\r\n\"10. He hath compassed the waters with bounds, _until the day and\r\nnight come to an end_.\r\n\r\n\"11. The pillars of heaven _tremble_, and are astonished at his\r\nreproof.\r\n\r\n\"12. He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he\r\nsmiteth through the proud.\" (\"By his wisdom _he has struck the proud_\r\none.\"--Douay ver.)\r\n\r\n\"13. By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hath\r\n_formed the crooked serpent_.\" (\"His artful hand brought forth the\r\nwinding serpent.\"--Douay ver.)\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of all this? The dead under the waters tremble;\r\nhell is naked, in the blazing heat, and destruction is uncovered; the\r\nnorth, the cold, descends on the world; the waters are bound up in\r\nthick clouds; the face of God's throne, the sun, is bidden by the\r\nclouds spread upon it; darkness has come, day and night are all one;\r\nthe earth trembles; he has lighted up the heavens with the fiery\r\ncomet, shaped like a crooked serpent, but he has struck him as Indra\r\nstruck Vritra.\r\n\r\nHow else can these words be interpreted? When\r\n\r\n{p. 302}\r\n\r\notherwise did the day and night come to an end? What is the crooked\r\nserpent?\r\n\r\nJob continues, (chap. xxviii,) and speaks in an enigmatical way, v.\r\n3, of \"the _stones_ of darkness, and the shadow of death.\"\r\n\r\n114. The flood breaketh out from the inhabitants; even the waters\r\nforgotten of the foot: _they are dried up_, they are gone away from\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\"5. As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned\r\nup _as it were fire_.\"\r\n\r\nMaurer and Gesenius translate verse 4 in a way wonderfully in accord\r\nwith my theory: \"The flood breaketh out from the inhabitants,\" they\r\nrender, \"a shaft, (or gulley-like pit,) is broken open far from the\r\ninhabitant, the dweller on the surface of the earth.\"[1] This is\r\ndoubtless the pit in which Job was bidden, the narrow-mouthed,\r\nbottomless cave, referred to hereafter. And the words, \"forgotten of\r\nthe foot,\" confirm this view, for the high authorities, just cited,\r\ntell us that these words mean literally, \"unsupported by the foot\r\nTHEY HANG BY ROPES IN DESCENDING; they are dried up; they are gone\r\naway from men.\"[2]\r\n\r\nHere we have, probably, a picture of Job and his companions\r\ndescending by ropes into some great cavern, \"dried up\" by the heat,\r\nseeking refuge, far from the habitations of men, in some \"deep shaft\r\nor gulley-like pit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the words, \"they are gone away from men,\" Maurer and Gesenius\r\ntranslate, \"far from men they move with uncertain steps--they\r\n_stagger_.\" They are stumbling through the darkness, hurrying to a\r\nplace of refuge, precisely as narrated in the Central American\r\nlegends.\r\n\r\n[1. Fausset's \"Commentaries,\" vol. iii, p. 66.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n{p. 303}\r\n\r\nThis is according to the King James version, but the Douay version\r\ngives it as follows:\r\n\r\n\"3. He hath set _a time for darkness_, and the _end of all things he\r\nconsidereth_; the stone also that is _in the dark_, and the shadow of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"4. The flood _divideth from the people that are on their journey,\r\nthose whom the foot of the needy man hath forgotten, and those who\r\ncannot be come at_.\r\n\r\n5. The land out of which bread grew in its place, _hath been\r\noverturned with fire_.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, God has considered whether he would not make an end\r\nof all things: he has set a time for darkness; in the dark are the\r\nstones; the flood separates the people; those who are escaping are\r\ndivided by it from those who were forgotten, or who are on the other\r\nside of the flood, where they can not be come at. But the land where\r\nformerly bread grew, the land of the agricultural people, the\r\ncivilized land, the plain of Ida where grew the apples, the plain of\r\nVigrid where the great battle took place, _that has been overturned\r\nby fire_.\r\n\r\nAnd this land the next verse tells us:\r\n\r\n\"6. The stones of it are the place of sapphires, and the clods of it\"\r\n(King James, \"dust\") \"are gold.\"\r\n\r\nWe are again reminded of those legends of America and Europe where\r\ngold and jewels fell from heaven among the stones. We are reminded of\r\nthe dragon-guarded hoards of the ancient myths.\r\n\r\nThe Douay version says:\r\n\r\n\"9. He\" (God) \"has stretched out his hand to the _flint_, he hath\r\n_overturned mountains from the roots_.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning Of FLINT here? And why this recurrence of the\r\nword flint, so common in the Central American legends and religions?\r\nAnd when did God in\r\n\r\n{p. 304}\r\n\r\nthe natural order of things overturn mountains by the roots?\r\n\r\nAnd Job (chap. xxx, Douay version) describes the condition of the\r\nmultitude who had at first mocked him, and the description recalls\r\nvividly the Central American pictures of the poor starving wanderers\r\nwho followed the Drift Age:\r\n\r\n\"3. Barren with want and hunger, who gnawed in the wilderness,\r\n_disfigured with calamity_ and misery.\r\n\r\n4. And they ate grass, and _barks of trees_, and the _root of\r\njunipers was their food_.\r\n\r\n\"5. Who snatched up these things out of the valleys, and _when they\r\nhad found any of them, they ran to them with a cry_.\r\n\r\n\"6. They dwelt in the _desert places of torrents_, and _in caves of\r\nthe earth_, or UPON THE GRAVEL.\"\r\n\r\nIs not all this wonderful?\r\n\r\nIn the King James version, verse 3 reads:\r\n\r\n3. For want and famine they were solitary, fleeing into the\r\nwilderness, in former time, desolate and waste.\"\r\n\r\nThe commentators say that the words, \"in former time, desolate and\r\nwaste,\" mean literally, \"_the yesternight of desolation and waste_.\"\r\n\r\nJob is describing the condition of the people immediately following\r\nthe catastrophe, not in some remote past.\r\n\r\nAnd again Job says (Douay version, chap. xxx):\r\n\r\n\"12. . . . My calamities forthwith arose; they have overthrown my\r\nfeet, and have overwhelmed me with their paths as with waves. . . .\r\n\r\n\"14. They have rushed in upon me as when a wall is broken, and a gate\r\nopened, and have rolled themselves down to my miseries. . . .\"\r\n\r\nMaurer translates, \"as when a wall is broken,\" \"with a shout like the\r\n_crash of falling masonry_.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 305}\r\n\r\n29. I was the brother of _dragons_ and companion of ostriches.\r\n\r\n\"30. My _skin is become black_ upon me, and my bones are dried up\r\nwith the _heat_.\"\r\n\r\nWe are reminded of Ovid's statement that the conflagration of Phaëton\r\ncaused the skin of the Africans to turn black.\r\n\r\nIn chapter xxxiv, (King James's version,) we read:\r\n\r\n\"14. If he\" (God) \"set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself\r\nhis spirit and his breath;\r\n\r\n\"15. _All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto\r\ndust_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in chapter xxxvi, (verses 15, 16, Douay,) we see that Job was\r\nshut up in something like a cavern:\r\n\r\n\"15. He shall deliver the poor out of his distress, and shall open\r\nhis ear in affliction.\r\n\r\n\"16. Therefore he shall _set thee at large out of the narrow mouth,\r\nand which hath no foundation under it_; and the rest of thy table\r\nshall be full of fatness.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, in the day when he delivers the poor out of their\r\nmisery, he will bring thee forth from the place where thou hast been\r\n\"hiding,\" (see chap. xiii, 20,) from that narrow-mouthed, bottomless\r\ncavern; and instead of starving, as you have been, your table, during\r\nthe rest of your life, \"shall be full of fatness.\"\r\n\r\n\"27. He\" (God) \"lifteth up the drops of rain and poureth out showers\r\nlike floods.\r\n\r\n\"28. Which flow from the clouds which _cover all from above_.\"\r\n\r\nThe commentators tell us that this expression, \"which cover all from\r\nabove,\" means literally, \"the bottom of the sea is laid bare\"; and\r\nthey confess their inability to understand it. But is it not the same\r\nstory told by Ovid of the bottom of the Mediterranean having been\r\nrendered\r\n\r\n{p. 306}\r\n\r\na bed of dry sand by Phaëton's conflagration; and does it not remind\r\nus of the Central American legend of the starving people migrating in\r\nsearch of the sun, through rocky places where the sea had been\r\nseparated to allow them to pass?\r\n\r\nAnd the King James version continues\r\n\r\n\"32. _With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to\r\nshine by the cloud that cometh betwixt_.\r\n\r\n\"33. _The noise thereof_ sheweth concerning it, the cattle also\r\nconcerning the vapor.\"\r\n\r\nThis last line shows how greatly the original text has been garbled;\r\nwhat have the cattle to do with it? Unless, indeed, here, as in the\r\nother myths, the cows signify the clouds. The meaning of the rest is\r\nplain: God draws up the water, sends it down as rain, which covers\r\nall things; the clouds gather before the sun and hide its light; and\r\nthe vapor restores the cows, the clouds; and all this is accompanied\r\nby great disturbances and noise.\r\n\r\nAnd the next chapter (xxxvii) continues the description:\r\n\r\n\"2. Hear ye attentively the terror of his\" (the comet's) \"voice, and\r\nthe sound that cometh out of his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"3. He beholdeth under all the heavens,\" (he is seen under all the\r\nheavens?) \"and his _light is upon the ends of the earth_.\r\n\r\n\"4. After it a NOISE SHALL ROAR, he shall thunder with the voice of\r\nhis majesty, and shall not be found out when his voice shall be\r\nheard.\"\r\n\r\nThe King James version says, \"And he will not stay them when his\r\nvoice is heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"5. God shall _thunder wonderfully_ with his voice, he that doth\r\ngreat and unsearchable things.\"\r\n\r\nHere, probably, are more allusions to the awful noises made by the\r\ncomet as it entered our atmosphere, referred to by Hesiod, the\r\nRussian legends, etc.\r\n\r\n{p. 307}\r\n\r\n\"6. _He commandeth the snow to go down upon the earth_, and _the\r\nwinter rain_ and the shower of his strength \"--(\"the _great rain of\r\nhis strength_,\" says the King James version).\r\n\r\n\"7. He sealeth up the hand of every man.\"\r\n\r\nThis means, says one commentator, that \"he confines men within doors\"\r\nby these great rains. Instead of houses we infer it to mean \"the\r\ncaves of the earth,\" already spoken of, (chap. xxx, v. 6,) and this\r\nis rendered more evident by the next verse:\r\n\r\n\"8. And _the beast shall go into his covert_ and shall _abide in his\r\nden_.\r\n\r\n\"9. Out of the inner parts\" (meaning the south, say the commentators\r\nand the King James version) \"_shall tempest come_, and _cold out of\r\nthe north_.\r\n\r\n\"10. When God bloweth, there cometh _frost_, and _again the waters\r\nare poured forth abundantly_.\"\r\n\r\nThe King James version continues:\r\n\r\n\"11. Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the cloud is gradually dissipated by dropping its\r\nmoisture in snow and rain.\r\n\r\n\"12. And it is turned round about by his counsels that they may do\r\nwhatsoever be commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.\r\n\r\n\"13. He causeth it to come, whether for _correction_, or for his\r\nland, or for mercy.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no mistaking all this. It refers to no ordinary events.\r\nThe statement is continuous. God, we are told, will call Job out from\r\nhis narrow-mouthed cave, and once more give him plenty of food. There\r\nhas been a great tribulation. The sun has sucked up the seas, they\r\nhave fallen in great floods; the thick clouds have covered the face\r\nof the sun; great noises prevail; there is a great light, and after\r\nit a roaring noise; the snow\r\n\r\n{p. 308}\r\n\r\nfalls on the earth, with winter rains, (cold rains,) and great rains;\r\nmen climb down ropes into deep shafts or pits; they are sealed up,\r\nand beasts are driven to their dens and stay there: there are great\r\ncold and frost, and more floods; then the continual rains dissipate\r\nthe clouds.\r\n\r\n\"19. Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we can not order our\r\nspeech _by reason of darkness_.\r\n\r\n\"20. Shall it be told him that I speak? If a man speak, surely _he\r\nshall be swallowed up?_\"\r\n\r\nAnd then God talks to Job, (chap. xxxviii,) and tells him \"to gird up\r\nhis loins like a man and answer him.\" He says:\r\n\r\n\"8. Who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth as issuing\r\nout of the womb?\r\n\r\n119. When I made a _cloud the garment thereof_, and wrapped it in\r\n_mists_ as in swaddling-bands,\r\n\r\n\"10. I set my bounds around it, and made it bars and doors.\" . . .\r\n\r\n\"22. Hast thou entered into _the storehouses of the snow_, or hast\r\nthou beheld the treasures of the _hail?_\" . . .\r\n\r\n\"29. Out of whose womb came the _ice_? and the _frost_ from heaven,\r\nwho hath gendered it?\r\n\r\n\"30. The waters are hardened like a _stone_, and _the surface of the\r\ndeep is frozen_.\"\r\n\r\nWhat has this Arabian poem to do with so many allusions to clouds,\r\nrain, ice, snow, hail, frost, and _frozen oceans_?\r\n\r\n\"36. Who hath put wisdom in the inward part? Or who hath given\r\nunderstanding to the heart? \"\r\n\r\nUmbreit says that this word \"heart\" means literally \"a shining\r\nphenomenon--a meteor.\" Who hath given understanding to the comet to\r\ndo this work?\r\n\r\n\"38. When was _the dust poured on the earth_, and the _clods hardened\r\ntogether_?\"\r\n\r\n{p. 309}\r\n\r\nOne version makes this read:\r\n\r\n\"Poured itself into a mass by the rain, like molten metal.\"\r\n\r\nAnd another translates it--\r\n\r\n\"_Is caked into a mass by heat, like molten metal_, BEFORE THE RAIN\r\nFALLS.\"\r\n\r\nThis is precisely in accordance with my theory that the \"till\" or\r\n\"hard-pan,\" next the earth, was caked and baked by the heat into its\r\npresent pottery-like and impenetrable condition, long before the work\r\nof cooling and condensation set loose the floods to rearrange and\r\nform secondary Drift out of the upper portion of the _débris_.\r\n\r\nBut again I ask, when in the natural order of events was dust poured\r\non the earth and hardened into clods, like molten metal?\r\n\r\nAnd in this book of Job I think we have a description of the\r\nveritable comets that struck the earth, in the Drift Age, transmitted\r\neven from the generations that beheld them blazing in the sky, in the\r\nwords of those who looked upon the awful sight.\r\n\r\nIn the Norse legends we read of three destructive objects which\r\nappeared in the heavens one of these was shaped like a serpent; it\r\nwas called \"the Midgard-serpent\"; then there was \"the Fenris wolf\";\r\nand, lastly, \"the dog Garm.\" In Hesiod we read, also, of three\r\nmonsters: first, Echidna, \"a serpent huge and terrible and vast\";\r\nsecond, Chimæra, a lion-like creature; and, thirdly, Typh&oelig;us,\r\nworst of all, a fierce, fiery dragon. And in Job, in like manner, we\r\nhave three mighty objects alluded to or described: first the\r\n\"winding\" or \"twisting\" serpent with which God has \"adorned the\r\nheavens\"; then \"behemoth,\" monstrous enough to \"drink up rivers,\"\r\n\"the chief of the ways of God\"; and lastly,\r\n\r\n{p. 310}\r\n\r\nand most terrible of all, \"leviathan\"; the name meaning, the twisting\r\nanimal, gathering itself into folds.\"\r\n\r\nGod, speaking to Job, and reminding him of the weakness and\r\nlittleness of man, says (chap. xl, v. 20):\r\n\r\n\"Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a book, or canst thou tie his\r\ntongue with a cord? \"\r\n\r\nThe commentators differ widely as to the meaning of this word\r\n\"leviathan.\" Some, as I have shown, think it means the same thing as\r\nthe crooked or \"winding\" serpent (_vulg_.) spoken of in chapter xxvi,\r\nv. 13, where, speaking of God, it is said:\r\n\r\n\"His spirit hath adorned the heavens, and his artful hand brought\r\nforth the winding serpent.\"\r\n\r\nOr, as the King James version has it:\r\n\r\n\"By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed\r\nthe crooked serpent.\"\r\n\r\nBy this serpent some of the commentators understand \"a constellation,\r\nthe devil, the leviathan.\" In the Septuagint he is called \"the\r\napostate dragon.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lord sarcastically asks Job:\r\n\r\n\"21. Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with\r\na buckle?\r\n\r\n\"22. Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft words to\r\nthee?\r\n\r\n\"23. Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him to be\r\na servant for ever?\r\n\r\n\"24. Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up for thy\r\nhandmaids?\r\n\r\n\"25. Shall friends\" (Septuagint, \"the nations\") cut him in pieces,\r\nshall merchants\" (Septuagint, \"the generation of the\r\nPh&oelig;nicians\") \"divide him?\" . . (chap. xli, v. 1. Douay version.)\r\n\r\n\"I will not stir him up, like one that is cruel; for who can resist\r\nmy\" (his?) \"countenance,\" or, \"who shall stand against me\" (him?)\r\n\"and live?\" . . .\r\n\r\n{p. 311}\r\n\r\n\"4. Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the\r\nmidst of his mouth?\r\n\r\n\"5. Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\"6. His body is like _molten shields_, shut close up, the scales\r\npressing upon one another.\r\n\r\n\"7. One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\"8. They stick one to another, and they hold one another fast, and\r\nshall not be separated.\r\n\r\n\"9. His sneezing is like the _shining of fire_, and his eyes like the\r\neyelids of the morning.\" (Syriac, \"His look is brilliant.\" Arabic,\r\n\"The apples of his eyes are fiery, and his eyes are like the\r\nbrightness of the morning.\")\r\n\r\n10. _Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire_.\"\r\n\r\nCompare these \"sneezings\" or \"neesings\" of the King James version,\r\nand these \"lamps like torches of lighted lire,\" with the appearance\r\nof Donati's great comet in 1858:\r\n\r\n\"On the 16th of September two diverging streams of light shot out\r\nfrom the nucleus across the coma, and, having separated to about the\r\nextent of its diameter, they turned back abruptly and streamed out in\r\nthe tail. _Luminous substance_ could be distinctly seen _rushing out\r\nfrom the nucleus_, and then flowing back into the tail. M. Rosa\r\ndescribed the streams of light as resembling _long hair brushed\r\nupward from the forehead_, and then allowed to fall back on each side\r\nof the head.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"11. _Out of his nostrils goeth forth smoke_, like that of a pot\r\nheated and boiling.\" (King James's version has it, \"as out of a\r\nseething pot or caldron.\")\r\n\r\n\"12. His breath _kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his\r\nmouth_.\r\n\r\n\"13. In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his\r\nface.\" (Septuagint, \"_Destruction runs before him_.\")\r\n\r\n[1. \"Edinburgh Review,\" October, 1874, p. 208.]\r\n\r\n{p. 312}\r\n\r\n\"14. The members of his flesh cleave one to another; he shall send\r\nlightnings against him, and they shall not be carried to another\r\nplace.\" (Sym., \"His flesh being cast for him as in a foundry,\"\r\n(molten,) \"is immovable.\")\r\n\r\n\"15. His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith's\r\nanvil.\" (Septuagint, \"He hath stood immovable as an anvil.\")\r\n\r\n\"16. When he shall raise him up, _the angels shall fear_, and being\r\naffrighted shall purify themselves.\"\r\n\r\nCould such language properly be applied, even by the wildest stretch\r\nof poetic fancy, to a whale or a crocodile, or any other monster of\r\nthe deep? What earthly creature could terrify the angels in heaven?\r\nWhat earthly creature has ever breathed fire?\r\n\r\n\"17. When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor\r\na spear, nor a breast-plate.\r\n\r\n\"18. For he shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.\r\n\r\n\"19. The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling\r\nare to him like stubble.\r\n\r\n\"20. As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to\r\nscorn who shaketh the spear.\"\r\n\r\nWe are reminded of the great gods of Asgard, who stood forth and\r\nfought the monster with sword and spear and hammer, and who fell dead\r\nbefore him; and of the American legends, where the demi-gods in vain\r\nhurled their darts and arrows at him, and fell pierced by the\r\nrebounding weapons.\r\n\r\n\"21. _The beams of the sun shall be under him_,\" (in the King James\r\nversion it is, \"SHARP STONES _are under him_\"--the gravel, the\r\nfalling _débris_,) \"and _he shall strew gold under him like mire_.\"\r\n(The King James version says, \"_he spreadeth sharp-pointed things\r\nupon the mire_.\")\r\n\r\nTo what whale or crocodile can these words be applied? When did they\r\never shed gold or stones? And\r\n\r\n{p. 313}\r\n\r\nin this, again, we have more references to gold falling from heaven:\r\n\r\n\"22. He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it\r\nas when ointments boil.\" (The Septuagint says, \"He deems the sea as a\r\nvase of ointment, and the Tartarus of the abyss like a prisoner.\")\r\n\r\n\"23. _A path shall shine after him_; he shall esteem the deep as\r\ngrowing old.\" (The King James version says, \"One would think the deep\r\nto be hoary.\")\r\n\r\n1124. _There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him_,\r\nwho was made to fear no one.\r\n\r\n\"25. He beholdeth every _high thing_; he is king over all the\r\nchildren of pride.\" (Chaldaic, \"of all the sons of the mountains.\")\r\n\r\nNow, when we take this description, with all that has preceded it, it\r\nseems to me beyond question that this was one of the crooked serpents\r\nwith which God had adorned the heavens: this was the monster with\r\nblazing bead, casting out jets of light, breathing volumes of smoke,\r\nmolten, shining, brilliant, irresistible, against whom men hurled\r\ntheir weapons in vain; for destruction went before him: he cast down\r\nstones and pointed things upon the mire, the clay; the sea boils with\r\nhis excessive heat; he threatens heaven itself; the angels tremble,\r\nand he beholds all high places. This is he whose rain of fire killed\r\nJob's sheep and shepherds; whose chaotic winds killed Job's children;\r\nwhose wrath fell upon and consumed the rich men at their tables; who\r\nmade the habitations of kings \"desolate places\"; who spared only in\r\npart \"the island of the innocent,\" where the remnant of humanity,\r\ndescending by ropes, hid themselves in deep, narrow-mouthed caves in\r\nthe mountains. This is he who dried up the rivers and absorbed or\r\nevaporated a great part of the water of the ocean, to subsequently\r\ncast it down in great floods of snow and rain, to cover the north\r\nwith ice;\r\n\r\n{p. 314}\r\n\r\nwhile the darkened world rolled on for a long night of blackness\r\nunderneath its dense canopy of clouds.\r\n\r\nIf this be not the true interpretation of Job, who, let me ask, can\r\nexplain all these allusions to harmonize with the established order\r\nof nature? And if this interpretation be the true one, then have we\r\nindeed penetrated back through all the ages, through mighty lapses of\r\ntime, until, on the plain of some most ancient civilized land, we\r\nlisten, perchance, at some temple-door, to this grand justification\r\nof the ways of God to man; this religious drama, this poetical\r\nsermon, wrought out of the traditions of the people and priests,\r\ntouching the greatest calamity which ever tried the hearts and tested\r\nthe faith of man.\r\n\r\nAnd if this interpretation be true, with how much reverential care\r\nshould we consider these ancient records embraced in the Bible!\r\n\r\nThe scientist picks up a fragment of stone--the fool would fling it\r\naway with a laugh,--but the philosopher sees in it the genesis of a\r\nworld; from it he can piece out the detailed history of ages; he\r\nfinds in it, perchance, a fossil of the oldest organism, the first\r\ntraces of that awful leap from matter to spirit, from dead earth to\r\nendless life; that marvel of marvels, that miracle of all miracles,\r\nby which dust and water and air live, breathe, think, reason, and\r\ncast their thoughts abroad through time and space and eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd so, stumbling through these texts, falling over mistranslations\r\nand misconceptions, pushing aside the accumulated dust of centuried\r\nerrors, we lay our hands upon a fossil that lived and breathed when\r\ntime was new: we are carried back to ages not only before the flood,\r\nbut to ages that were old when the flood came upon the earth.\r\n\r\nHere Job lives once more: the fossil breathes and palpitates;-hidden\r\nfrom the fire of heaven, deep in his cavern;\r\n\r\n{p. 315}\r\n\r\ncovered with burns and bruises from the falling _débris_ of the\r\ncomet, surrounded by his trembling fellow-refugees, while chaos rules\r\nwithout and hope has fled the earth, we hear Job, bold, defiant,\r\nunshrinking, pouring forth the protest of the human heart against the\r\ncruelty of nature; appealing from God's awful deed to the sense of\r\nGod's eternal justice.\r\n\r\nWe go out and look at the gravel-heap--worn, rounded, ancient, but\r\nsilent,--the stones lie before us. They have no voice. We turn to\r\nthis volume, and here is their voice, here is their story; here we\r\nhave the very thoughts men thought-men like ourselves, but sorely\r\ntried--when that gravel was falling upon a desolated world.\r\n\r\nAnd all this buried, unrecognized, in the sacred book of a race and a\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n{p. 316}\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                GENESIS READ BY THE LIGHT OF THE COMET.\r\n\r\nAND now, gathering into our hands all the light afforded by the\r\nforegoing facts and legends, let us address ourselves to this\r\nquestion: How far can the opening chapters of the book of Genesis be\r\ninterpreted to conform to the theory of the contact of a comet with\r\nthe earth in the Drift Age?\r\n\r\nIt may appear to some of my readers irreverent to place any new\r\nmeaning on any part of the sacred volume, and especially to attempt\r\nto transpose the position of any of its parts. For this feeling I\r\nhave the highest respect.\r\n\r\nI do not think it is necessary, for the triumph of truth, that it\r\nshould lacerate the feelings even of the humblest. It should come,\r\nlike Quetzalcoatl, advancing with shining, smiling face, its hands\r\nfull of fruits and flowers, bringing only blessings and kindliness to\r\nthe multitude; and should that multitude, for a time, drive the\r\nprophet away, beyond the seas, with curses, be assured they will\r\neventually return to set up his altars.\r\n\r\nHe who follows the gigantic Mississippi upward from the Gulf of\r\nMexico to its head-waters on the high plateau of Minnesota, will not\r\nscorn even the tiniest rivulet among the grass which helps to create\r\nits first fountain. So he who considers the vastness for good of this\r\ngreat force, Christianity, which pervades the world down the long\r\ncourse of so many ages, aiding, relieving, encouraging, cheering,\r\npurifying, sanctifying humanity, can not afford\r\n\r\n{p. 317}\r\n\r\nto ridicule even these the petty fountains, the head-waters, the\r\nfirst springs from which it starts on its world-covering and\r\nage-traversing course.\r\n\r\nIf we will but remember the endless array of asylums, hospitals, and\r\norphanages; the houses for the poor, the sick, the young, the old,\r\nthe unfortunate, the helpless, and the sinful, with which\r\nChristianity has literally sprinkled the world; when we remember the\r\nuncountable millions whom its ministrations have restrained from\r\nbestiality, and have directed to purer lives and holier deaths, he\r\nindeed is not to be envied who can find it in his heart, with\r\nmalice-aforethought, to mock or ridicule it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, few, I think, even of the orthodox, while bating no\r\njot of their respect for the sacred volume, or their faith in the\r\ngreat current of inspired purpose and meaning which streams through\r\nit, from cover to cover, hold to-day that every line and word is\r\nliterally accurate beyond a shadow of question. The direct\r\ncontradictions which occur in the text itself show that the errors of\r\nman have crept into the compilation or composition of the volume.\r\n\r\nThe assaults of the skeptical have been largely directed against the\r\nopening chapters of Genesis:\r\n\r\n\"What!\" it has been said, \"you pretend in the first chapter that the\r\nanimated creation was made in six days; and then in the second\r\nchapter (verses 4 and 5) you say that the heavens and the earth and\r\nall the vegetation were made in one day. Again: you tell us that\r\nthere was light shining on the earth on the first day; and that there\r\nwas night too; for 'God divided the light from the darkness'; and\r\nthere was morning and evening on the first, second, and third days,\r\nwhile the sun, moon, and stars, we are told, were not created until\r\nthe fourth day; and grass and fruit-trees were made before the sun.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 318}\r\n\r\n\"How,\" it is asked, \"could there be night and day and vegetation\r\nwithout a sun?\"\r\n\r\nAnd to this assault religion has had no answer.\r\n\r\nNow, I can not but regard these opening chapters as a Mosaic work of\r\nancient legends, dovetailed together in such wise that the true\r\nchronological arrangement has been departed from and lost.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded that in some of the verses of these chapters God is\r\nspoken of as Elohim, while in the remaining verses he is called\r\nJehovah Elohim. This is very much as if a book were discovered to-day\r\nin part of which God was referred to as Jove, and in the rest as\r\nJehovah-Jove. The conclusion would be very strong that the first part\r\nwas written by one who know the Deity only as Jove, while the other\r\nportion was written by one who had come under Hebraic influences. And\r\nthis state of facts in Genesis indicates that it was not the work of\r\none inspired mind, faultless and free from error; but the work of two\r\nminds, relating facts, it is true, but jumbling them together in an\r\nincongruous order.\r\n\r\nI propose, therefore, with all reverence, to attempt a re-arrangement\r\nof the verses of the opening chapters of the book of Genesis, which\r\nwill, I hope, place it in such shape that it will be beyond future\r\nattack from the results of scientific research; by restoring the\r\nfragments to the position they really occupied before their last\r\ncompilation. Whether or not I present a reasonably probable case, it\r\nis for the reader to judge.\r\n\r\nIf we were to find, under the _débris_ of Pompeii, a grand\r\ntessellated pavement, representing one of the scenes of the \"Iliad,\"\r\nbut shattered by an earthquake, its fragments dislocated and piled\r\none upon the top of another, it would be our duty and our pleasure to\r\nseek, by following the clew of the picture, to re-arrange the\r\nfragments so as\r\n\r\n{p. 319}\r\n\r\nto do justice to the great design of its author; and to silence, at\r\nthe same time, the cavils of those who could see in its shocked and\r\nbroken form nothing but a subject for mirth and ridicule.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, following the clew afforded by the legends of\r\nmankind and the revelations of science, I shall suggest a\r\nreconstruction of this venerable and most ancient work. If the reader\r\ndoes not accept my conclusions, he will, at least, I trust,\r\nappreciate the motives with which I make the attempt.\r\n\r\nI commence with that which is, and should be, the first verse of the\r\nfirst chapter, the sublime sentence:\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\"\r\n\r\nLet us pause here: \"God created the heavens and the earth _in the\r\nbeginning_\";--that is, before any other of the events narrated in the\r\nchapter. Why should we refuse to accept this statement? _In the\r\nbeginning_, says the Bible, at the very first, God created the\r\nheavens and the earth. He did not make them in six days, he made them\r\n_in the beginning_; the words \"six days\" refer, as we shall see, to\r\nsomething that occurred long afterward. He did not attempt to create\r\nthem, he created them; he did not partially create them, he created\r\nthem altogether. The work was finished; the earth was made, the\r\nheavens were made, the clouds, the atmosphere, the rocks, the waters;\r\nand the sun, moon, and stars; all were completed.\r\n\r\nWhat next? Is there anything else in this dislocated text that refers\r\nto this first creation? Yes; we go forward to the next chapter; here\r\nwe have it:\r\n\r\nChap. ii, v. 1. \"_Thus_ the heavens and the earth were finished, and\r\nall the host of them.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 320}\r\n\r\nAnd then follows:\r\n\r\nChap. ii, v. 4. \"These are the generations of the heavens and of the\r\nearth, _when they were created_, IN THE DAY that the Lord God made\r\nthe earth and the heavens.\r\n\r\nChap. ii, v. 5. \"And every plant of the field before it was in the\r\nearth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for the Lord God\r\n_had not caused it to rain upon the earth_, and there was not a man\r\nto till the ground.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have a consecutive statement--God made the heavens and the\r\nearth in the beginning, and thus they were _finished_, and all the\r\nhost of them. They were not made in six days, but \"_in the day_,\" to\r\nwit, in that period of remote time called \"The Beginning.\" And God\r\nmade also all the herbs of the field, all vegetation. And he made\r\nevery plant of the field before it was cultivated in that particular\r\npart of the world called \"The Earth,\" for, as we have seen, Ovid\r\ndraws a distinction between \"The Earth\" and the rest of the globe;\r\nand Job draws one between \"the island of the innocent\" and the other\r\ncountries of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd here I would call the reader's attention particularly to this\r\nremarkable statement:\r\n\r\nChap. ii, verse 5. \"For the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon\r\nthe earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.\r\n\r\nVerse 6. \"But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the\r\nwhole face of the ground.\"\r\n\r\nThis is extraordinary: _there was no rain_.\r\n\r\nA mere inventor of legends certainly had never dared make a statement\r\nso utterly in conflict with the established order of things; there\r\nwas no necessity for him to do so; he would fear that it would throw\r\ndiscredit on all the rest of his narrative; as if he should say, \"at\r\nthat time the grass was not green,\" or, \"the sky was not blue.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 321}\r\n\r\nA world without rain! Could it be possible? 'Did the writer of\r\nGenesis invent an absurdity, or did he record an undoubted tradition?\r\nLet us see:\r\n\r\nRain is the product of two things--heat which evaporates the waters\r\nof the oceans, lakes, and rivers; and cold which condenses them again\r\ninto rain or snow. Both heat and cold are necessary, In the tropics\r\nthe water is sucked up by the heat of the sun; it rises to a cooler\r\nstratum, and forms clouds; these clouds encounter the colder air\r\nflowing in from the north and south, condensation follows,\r\naccompanied probably by some peculiar electrical action, and then the\r\nrain falls.\r\n\r\nBut when the lemon and the banana grew in Spitzbergen, as geology\r\nassures us they did in pre-glacial days, where was the cold to come\r\nfrom? The very poles must then have possessed a warm climate. There\r\nwere, therefore, at that time, no movements of cold air from the\r\npoles to the equator; when the heat drew up the moisture it rose into\r\na vast body of heated atmosphere, surrounding the whole globe to a\r\ngreat height; it would have to pass through this cloak of warm air,\r\nand high up above the earth, even to the limits of the earth-warmth,\r\nbefore it reached an atmosphere sufficiently cool to condense it, and\r\nfrom that great height it would fall as a fine mist.\r\n\r\nWe find an illustration of this state of things on the coast of Peru,\r\nfrom the river Loa to Cape Blanco,[1] where no rain ever falls, in\r\nconsequence of the heated air which ascends from the vast sand\r\nwastes, and keeps the moisture of the air above the point of\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\nOr it would have to depend for its condensation on the difference of\r\ntemperature between night and day, settling\r\n\r\n[1. \"American Cyclopædia,\" vol. xiii, p. 387.]\r\n\r\n{p. 322}\r\n\r\nlike a dew at night upon the earth, and so maintaining vegetation.\r\n\r\nWhat a striking testimony is all this to the fact that these\r\ntraditions of Genesis reach back to the very infancy of human\r\nhistory--to the age before the Drift!\r\n\r\nAfter the creation of the herbs and plants, what came next? We go\r\nback to the first chapter:\r\n\r\nVerse 21. \"And God created great whales, and every living creature\r\nthat moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their\r\nkind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nVerse 22. \"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply,\r\nand fill the waters in the seas, and let the fowl multiply in the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nVerse 25. \"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and\r\ncattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth\r\nafter his kind: and God saw that it was good.\"\r\n\r\nVerse 26. \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our\r\nlikeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and\r\nover the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the\r\nearth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\"\r\n\r\nWe come back to the second chapter:\r\n\r\nVerse 7. \"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and\r\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a\r\nliving soul.\"\r\n\r\nWe return to the first chapter:\r\n\r\nVerse 27. \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God\r\ncreated he him; male and female created he them.\"\r\n\r\nWe come back to the second chapter:\r\n\r\nVerse 8. \"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and\r\nthere he put the man he had formed.\"\r\n\r\nVerse 9. \"And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree\r\nthat is pleasant to the sight and good\r\n\r\n{p. 323}\r\n\r\nfor food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the\r\ntree of knowledge of good and evil.\"\r\n\r\nVerse 10. \"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden,\" etc.\r\n\r\nHere follows a description of the garden; it is a picture of a\r\nglorious world, of that age when the climate of the Bahamas extended\r\nto Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nVerse 15. \"And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden\r\nof Eden to dress it and to keep it.\"\r\n\r\nHere follows the injunction that \"the man whom God had formed,\" (for\r\nhe is not yet called Adam--the Adami--the people of Ad,) should not\r\neat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\r\n\r\nAnd then we have, (probably a later interpolation,) an account of\r\nAdam, so called for the first time, naming the animals, and of the\r\ncreation of Eve from a rib of Adam.\r\n\r\nAnd here is another evidence of the dislocation of the text, for we\r\nhave already been informed (chap. i, v. 27) that God had made Man,\r\n\"male and _female_\"; and here we have him making woman over again\r\nfrom man's rib.\r\n\r\nVerse 25. \"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were\r\nnot ashamed.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an age of primitive simplicity, the primeval world; free from\r\nstorms or ice or snow; an Edenic age; the Tertiary Age before the\r\nDrift.\r\n\r\nThen follows the appearance of the serpent. Although represented in\r\nthe text in a very humble capacity, he is undoubtedly the same great\r\ncreature which, in all the legends, brought ruin on the world--the\r\ndragon, the apostate, the demon, the winding or crooked serpent of\r\nJob, the leviathan, Satan, the devil. And as such he is regarded by\r\nthe theologians.\r\n\r\nHe obtains moral possession of the woman, just as we\r\n\r\n{p. 324}\r\n\r\nhave seen, in the Hindoo legends, the demon Ravana carrying off Sita,\r\nthe representative of an agricultural civilization; just as we have\r\nseen Ataguju, the Peruvian god, seducing the sister of certain\r\nrayless ones, or Darklings. And the woman ate of the fruit of the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThis is the same legend which we see appearing in so many places and\r\nin so many forms. The apple of Paradise was one of the apples of the\r\nGreek legends, intrusted to the Hesperides, but which they could not\r\nresist the temptation to pluck and eat. The serpent Ladon watched the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the apples of Idun, in the Norse legends, the wife of\r\nBrage, the god of poetry and eloquence. She keeps them in a box, and\r\nwhen the gods feel the approach of old age they have only to taste\r\nthem and become young again. Loke, the evil-one, the Norse devil,\r\ntempted Idun to come into a forest with her apples, to compare them\r\nwith some others, whereupon a giant called Thjasse, in the appearance\r\nof an enormous eagle, flew down, seized Idun and her apples, and\r\ncarried them away, like Ravana, into the air. The gods compelled Loke\r\nto bring her back, for they were the apples of the tree of life to\r\nthem; without them they were perishing. Loke stole Idun from Thjasse,\r\nchanged her into a nut, and fled with her, pursued by Thjasse. The\r\ngods kindled _a great fire_, the eagle plumage of Thjasse caught the\r\nflames, he _fell to the earth, and was slain by the gods_.[1]\r\n\r\nBut the serpent in Genesis ruins Eden, just as he did in all the\r\nlegends; just as the comet ruined the Tertiary Age. The fair world\r\ndisappears; cold and ice and snow come.\r\n\r\nAdam and Eve, we have seen, were at first naked, and subsequently\r\nclothe themselves, for modesty, with fig-leaves, (chap. iii, v. 7;)\r\nbut there comes a time, as in the\r\n\r\n[1. Norse Mythology,\" pp. 275, 276.]\r\n\r\n{p. 325}\r\n\r\nNorth American legends, when the great cold compels them to cover\r\ntheir shivering bodies with the skins of the wild beasts they have\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nA recent writer, commenting on the Glacial Age, says:\r\n\r\n\"Colder and colder grew the winds. The body could not be kept warm.\r\nClothing must be had, and this must be furnished by the wild beasts.\r\nTheir hides must assist in protecting the life of men. . . . The\r\nskins were removed and transferred to the bodies of men.\"[1]\r\n\r\nHence we read in chapter iii, verse 21:\r\n\r\n\"Unto Adam also, and to his wife, did the Lord God make _coats of\r\nskins and clothed them_.\"\r\n\r\nThis would not have been necessary during the warm climate of the\r\nTertiary Age. And as this took place, according to Genesis, before\r\nAdam was driven out of Paradise, and while he still remained in the\r\ngarden, it is evident that some great change of climate had fallen\r\nupon Eden. The Glacial Age had arrived; the Drift had come. It was a\r\nrude, barbarous, cold age. Man must cover himself with skins; he\r\nmust, by the sweat of physical labor, wring a living out of the\r\nground which God had \"cursed\" with the Drift. Instead of the fair and\r\nfertile world of the Tertiary Age, producing all fruits abundantly,\r\nthe soil is covered with stones and clay, as in Job's narrative, and\r\nit brings forth, as we are told in Genesis,[2] only \"thorns and\r\nthistles\"; and Adam, the human race, must satisfy its starving\r\nstomach upon grass, \"and thou shalt eat the herb of the field\"; just\r\nas in Job we are told:\r\n\r\nChap. xxx, verse 3. \"For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing\r\ninto the wilderness in former time, desolate and solitary.\"\r\n\r\n[1. Maclean's \"Antiquity of Man,\" p. 65.\r\n\r\n2. Chap. iii, verse 18.]\r\n\r\n{p. 326}\r\n\r\nVerse 4. \"Who cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper-roots for\r\ntheir food.\"\r\n\r\nVerse 7. \"Among the bushes they brayed, under the nettles were they\r\ngathered together.\"\r\n\r\nAnd God \"_drove out the man_\" from the fair Edenic world into the\r\npost-glacial desolation; and Paradise was lost, and--\r\n\r\n\"At the east of the garden of Eden he placed cherubims and _a flaming\r\nsword_, which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the sword of the comet. The Norse legends say:\r\n\r\n\"Yet, before all things, there existed what we call Muspelheim. It is\r\na world luminous, glowing, not to be dwelt in by strangers, and\r\nsituate at the end of the earth. Surtur holds his empire there. _In\r\nhis hand there shines a flaming sword_.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great conflagration between the by-gone Eden and the\r\npresent land of stones and thistles.\r\n\r\nIs there any other allusion besides this to the fire which\r\naccompanied the comet in Genesis?\r\n\r\nYes, but it is strangely out of place. It is a distinct description\r\nof the pre-glacial wickedness of the world, the fire falling from\r\nheaven, the cave-life, and the wide-spread destruction of humanity;\r\nbut the compiler of these antique legends has located it in a time\r\nlong subsequent to the Deluge of Noah, and in the midst of a densely\r\npopulated world. It is as if one were to represent the Noachic Deluge\r\nas having occurred in the time of Nero, in a single province of the\r\nRoman Empire, while the great world went on its course unchanged by\r\nthe catastrophe which must, if the statement were true, have\r\ncompletely overwhelmed it. So we find the story of Lot and the\r\ndestruction of the cities of the plain brought down to the time\r\n\r\n{p. 327}\r\n\r\nof Abraham, when Egypt and Babylon were in the height of their glory.\r\nAnd Lot's daughters believed that the whole human family, except\r\nthemselves, had been exterminated; while Abraham was quietly feeding\r\nhis flocks in an adjacent country.\r\n\r\nFor if Lot's story is located in its proper era, what became of\r\nAbraham and the Jewish people, and all the then civilized nations, in\r\nthis great catastrophe? And if it occurred in that age, why do we\r\nhear nothing more about so extraordinary an event in the history of\r\nthe Jews or of any other people?\r\n\r\nMr. Smith says:\r\n\r\n\"The conduct of Lot in the mountain whither he had retired scarcely\r\nadmits of explanation. It has been generally supposed that his\r\ndaughters believed that the whole of the human race were destroyed,\r\nexcept their father and themselves. But how they could have thought\r\nso, when they had previously tarried at Zoar, it is not easy to\r\nconceive; and we can not but regard the entire case as one of those\r\nproblems which the Scriptures present as indeterminate, on account of\r\na deficiency of data on which to form any satisfactory conclusion.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe theory of this book makes the whole story tangible, consistent,\r\nand probable.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, prior to the coming of the comet, the human race,\r\naccording to the legends, had abandoned itself to all wickedness. In\r\nthe Norse Sagas we read:\r\n\r\n     Brothers will fight together,\r\n     And become each other's bane;\r\n     Sisters' children\r\n     Their sib shall spoil;\r\n     Hard, is the world,\r\n     Sensual sins grow huge.\"\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Patriarchal Age,\" vol. i, p. 388.]\r\n\r\n{p. 328}\r\n\r\nIn the legends of the British Druids we are told that it was \"the\r\nprofligacy of mankind\" that caused God to send the great disaster.\r\nSo, in the Bible narrative, we read that, in Lot's time, God resolved\r\non the destruction of \"the cities of the plain,\" Sodom, (Od, Ad,) and\r\nGomorrah, (Go-Meru,) because of the wickedness of mankind:\r\n\r\nChap. xviii, verse 20. \"And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom\r\nand Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous\"--\r\n\r\ntherefore he determined to destroy them. When the angels came to\r\nSodom, the people showed the most villainous and depraved appetites.\r\nThe angels warned Lot to flee. Blindness (darkness?) came upon the\r\npeople of the city, so that they could not find the doors of the\r\nhouses. The angels took Lot and his wife and two daughters by the\r\nhands, and led or dragged them away, and told them to fly \"to the\r\nmountain, lest they be consumed.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an interlude here, an inconsistent interpolation probably,\r\nwhere Lot stays at Zoar, and persuades the Lord to spare Zoar; but\r\nsoon after we find all the cities of the plain destroyed, and Lot and\r\nhis family hiding in a cave in the mountain; so that Lot's\r\nintercession seems to have been of no avail:\r\n\r\nVerse 24. \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah\r\n_brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven_.\"\r\n\r\nVerse 25. \"And he overthrew those cities, and _all the cities of the\r\nplain_, and all the _inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew\r\nupon the ground_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a complete destruction of all living things in that locality;\r\nand Lot \"_dwell in a cave_, he and his two daughters.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the daughters were convinced that they were the\r\n\r\n{p. 329}\r\n\r\nlast of the human race left alive on the face of the earth,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the Lord had promised (chap. iii, verse\r\n21), \"I will not overthrow this city,\" Zoar; but Zoar evidently _was_\r\noverthrown. And the daughters, rather than see the human race perish,\r\ncommitted incest with their father, and became the mothers of two\r\ngreat and extensive tribes or races of men, the Moabites and the\r\nAmmonites.\r\n\r\nThis, also, looks very much as if they were indeed repeopling an\r\nempty and desolated world..\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, we have here, in due chronological order:\r\n\r\n1. The creation of the heavens and the earth, and all the host of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2. The creation of the plants, animals, and man.\r\n\r\n3. The fair and lovely age of the Pliocene, the summer-land, when the\r\npeople went naked, or clothed themselves in the leaves of trees; it\r\nwas the fertile land where Nature provided abundantly everything for\r\nher children.\r\n\r\n4. The serpent appears and overthrows this Eden.\r\n\r\n5. Fire falls from heaven and destroys a large part of the human race.\r\n\r\n6. A remnant take refuge in a cave.\r\n\r\n7. Man is driven out of the Edenic land, and a blazing sword, a\r\nconflagration, waves between him and Paradise, between Niflheim and\r\nMuspelheim.\r\n\r\nWhat next?\r\n\r\nWe return now to the first chapter of this dislocated text:\r\n\r\nVerse 2. \"And the earth _was without form, and void_.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, chaos had come in the train of the comet. Otherwise,\r\nhow can we understand how God, as stated in the preceding verse, has\r\njust made the heavens\r\n\r\n{p. 330}\r\n\r\nand the earth? How could his work have been so imperfect?\r\n\r\n\"_And darkness was upon the face of the deep_.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the primeval night referred to in all the legends; the long\r\nage of darkness upon the earth.\r\n\r\n\"And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\"\r\n\r\nThe word for _spirit_, in Hebrew, as in Latin, originally meant\r\n_wind_; and this passage might be rendered, \"a mighty wind swept the\r\nface of the waters.\" This wind represents, I take it, the great\r\ncyclones of the Drift Age.\r\n\r\nVerse 3. \"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun and moon had not yet appeared, but the dense mass of clouds,\r\npouring their waters upon the earth, had gradually, as Job expresses\r\nit, \"wearied\" themselves,--they had grown thin; and the light began\r\nto appear, at least sufficiently to mark the distinction between day\r\nand night.\r\n\r\nVerse 4. \"And God saw the light: that it was good; and God divided\r\nthe light from the darkness.\"\r\n\r\nVerse 5. \"And God called the light day, and the darkness be called\r\nnight. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, in subdividing the phenomena of this dark period,\r\nwhen there was neither moon nor sun to mark the time, mankind drew\r\nthe first line of subdivision, very naturally, at that point of time,\r\n(it may have been weeks, or months, or years,) when first the\r\ndistinction between night and day became faintly discernible, and men\r\ncould again begin to count time.\r\n\r\nBut this gain of light had been at the expense of the\r\n\r\n{p. 331}\r\n\r\nclouds; they had given down their moisture in immense and perpetual\r\nrains; the low-lying lands of the earth were overflowed; the very\r\nmountains, while not under water, were covered by the continual\r\nfloods of rain. There was water everywhere. To appreciate this\r\ncondition of things, one has but to look at the geological maps of\r\nthe amount of land known to have been overflowed by water during the\r\nso-called Glacial Age in Europe.\r\n\r\nAnd so the narrative proceeds:\r\n\r\nVerse 6. \"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the\r\nwaters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\"\r\n\r\nThis has been incomprehensible to the critics. It has been supposed\r\nthat by this \"firmament\" was meant the heavens; and that the waters\r\n\"above the firmament\" were the clouds; and it has been said that this\r\nwas a barbarian's conception, to wit, that the unbounded and\r\nillimitable space, into which the human eye, aided by the telescope,\r\ncan penetrate for thousands of billions of miles, was a blue arch a\r\nfew hundred feet high, on top of which were the clouds; and that the\r\nrain was simply the leaking of the water through this roof of the\r\nearth. And men have said: \"Call ye this real history, or inspired\r\nnarrative? Did God know no more about the nature of the heavens than\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Religion has been puzzled to reply.\r\n\r\nBut read Genesis in this new light: There was water everywhere;\r\nfloods from the clouds, floods from the melting ice; floods on the\r\nland, where the return of the evaporated moisture was not able, by\r\nthe channel-ways of the earth, to yet find its way back to the oceans.\r\n\r\n\"And God said, Let there be a firmament _in the midst of the waters_,\r\nand let it divide the waters from the waters.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 332}\r\n\r\nThat is to say, first a great island appeared dividing the waters\r\nfrom the waters. This was \"the island of the innocent,\" referred to\r\nby Job, where the human race did not utterly perish. We shall see\r\nmore about it hereafter.\r\n\r\n\"7. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were\r\nunder the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:\r\nand it was so.\r\n\r\n\"8. _And God called the firmament Heaven_. And the evening and the\r\nmorning were the second day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew _Rokiâ_ is translated _stereoma_, or _solidity_, in the\r\nSeptuagint version. It meant solid land--not empty space.\r\n\r\nAnd if man was not or had not yet been on earth, whence could the\r\nname Heaven have been derived? For whom should God have named it, if\r\nthere were no human ears to catch the sound? God needs no lingual\r\napparatus--he speaks no human speech.\r\n\r\nThe true meaning probably is, that this was the region that had been\r\nfor ages, before the Drift and the Darkness, regarded as the home of\r\nthe godlike, civilized race; situated high above the ocean, \"_in the\r\nmidst of the waters_,\" in mid-sea; precipitous and mountainous, it\r\nwas the first region to clear itself of the descending torrents.\r\n\r\nWhat next?\r\n\r\n\"9. And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered\r\ntogether unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\r\n\r\n\"10. And God called the dry land Earth and the gathering together of\r\nthe waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.\"\r\n\r\nThis may be either a recapitulation of the facts already stated, or\r\nit may refer to the gradual draining off of the continents, by the\r\npassing away of the waters; the continents\r\n\r\n{p. 333}\r\n\r\nbeing distinguished in order of time from the island \"in the midst of\r\nthe waters.\"\r\n\r\n\"11. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding\r\nseed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is\r\nin itself _upon the earth_: and it was so.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been objected, as I have shown, that this narrative was false,\r\nbecause science has proved that the fruit-trees did not really\r\nprecede in order of creation the creeping things and the fish, which,\r\nwe are told, were not made until the fifth day, two days afterward.\r\nBut if we will suppose that, as the water disappeared from the land,\r\nthe air grew warmer by the light breaking through the diminishing\r\nclouds, the grass began to spring up again, as told in the Norse,\r\nChinese, and other legends, and the fruit-trees, of different kinds,\r\nbegan to grow again, for we are told they produced each \"after his\r\nkind.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we learn \"that its seed is in itself upon the earth.\" Does this\r\nmean that the seeds of these trees were buried in the earth, and\r\ntheir vitality not destroyed by the great visitation of fire, water,\r\nand ice?\r\n\r\nAnd on the fourth day \"God made two great lights,\" the sun and moon.\r\nIf this were a narration of the original creation of these great\r\norbs, we should be told that they were made exclusively to give\r\nlight. But this is not the case. The light was there already; it had\r\nappeared on the evening of the first day; they were made, we are\r\ntold, to \"divide the day from the night.\" Day and night already\r\nexisted, but in a confused and imperfect way; even the day was dark\r\nand cloudy; but, with the return of the sun, the distinction of day\r\nand night became once more clear.\r\n\r\n\"14. And God said . . . Let them be for signs and for _seasons_, and\r\nfor days and years.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 334}\r\n\r\nThat is to say, let them be studied, as they were of old, as\r\nastronomical and astrological _signs_, whose influences control\r\naffairs on earth. We have seen that in many legends a good deal is\r\nsaid about the constellations, and the division of time in accordance\r\nwith the movements of the heavenly bodies, which was made soon after\r\nthe catastrophe:\r\n\r\n\"90. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving\r\ncreature that hath life, and fowls that may fly above the earth in\r\nthe open firmament of heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the moving creatures, the fishes which still live,\r\nwhich have escaped destruction in the deep waters of the oceans or\r\nlakes, and the fowls which were flying wildly in the open firmament,\r\nare commanded to bring forth abundantly, to \"replenish\" the desolated\r\nseas and earth.\r\n\r\n\"23. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\r\n\r\n\"24. And God said, Let the earth _bring forth_ the living creature\r\nafter his kind, cattle, and creeping thing and beast of the earth\r\nafter his kind: and it was so.\"\r\n\r\nGod does not, in this, _create_ them; he calls them forth from the\r\nearth, from the caves and dens where they had been hiding, each\r\n_after his kind_; they were already divided into species and genera.\r\n\r\n\"28. And God blessed them,\" (the human family,) \"and God said unto\r\nthem, Be fruitful, and multiply and REPLENISH the _earth_.\"\r\n\r\nSurely the poor, desolated world needed replenishing, restocking. But\r\nhow could the word \"replenish\" be applied to a new world, never\r\nbefore inhabited?\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in chapter ii (verses 16 and 17) God especially\r\nlimited man and enjoined him not to eat of the\r\n\r\n{p. 335}\r\n\r\nfruit of the tree of knowledge; while in v. 22, ch. iii, it is\r\nevident that there was another tree, \"the tree of life,\" which God\r\ndid not intend that man should enjoy the fruit of. But with the close\r\nof the Tertiary period and the Drift Age all this was changed: these\r\ntrees, whatever they signified, had been swept away, \"the blazing\r\nsword\" shone between man and the land where they grew, or had grown;\r\nand hence, after the Age of Darkness, God puts no such restraint or\r\ninjunction upon the human family. We read:\r\n\r\nCh. i, v. 29. \"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb\r\nbearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and _every\r\ntree_, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; _to you it\r\nshall be for meat_.\"\r\n\r\nWith what reason, if the text is in its true order, could God have\r\ngiven man, in the first chapter, the right to eat the fruit of\r\n_every_ tree, and in the following chapters have consigned the whole\r\nrace to ruin for eating the fruit of one particular tree?\r\n\r\nBut after the so-called Glacial Age all limitations were removed. The\r\ntree of knowledge and the tree of life had disappeared for ever. The\r\nDrift covered them.\r\n\r\nReader, waive your natural prejudices, and ask yourself whether this\r\nproposed readjustment of the Great Book does not place it thoroughly\r\nin accord with all the revelations of science; whether it does not\r\nanswer all the objections that have been made against the\r\nreasonableness of the story; and whether there is in it anything\r\ninconsistent with the sanctity of the record, the essentials of\r\nreligion, or the glory of God.\r\n\r\nInstead of being, compelled to argue, as Religion now does, that the\r\nwhole heavens and the earth, with its twenty miles in thickness of\r\nstratified rocks, were made in six actual days, or to interpret\r\n\"days\" to mean vast periods\r\n\r\n{p. 336}\r\n\r\nof time, notwithstanding the record speaks of \"the evening and the\r\nmorning\" constituting these \"days,\" as if they were really\r\nsubdivisions of sun-marked time; we here see that the vast Creation,\r\nand the great lapses of geologic time, all lie far back of the day\r\nwhen darkness was on the face of the deep; and that the six days\r\nwhich followed, and in which the world was gradually restored to its\r\nprevious condition, were the natural subdivisions into which events\r\narranged themselves. The Chinese divided this period of\r\nreconstruction into \"branches\" or \"stems\"; the race from whom the\r\nJews received their traditions divided it into days.\r\n\r\nThe first subdivision was, as I have said, that of the twilight age,\r\nwhen light began to invade the total darkness; it was subdivided\r\nagain into the evening and the morning, as the light grew stronger.\r\n\r\nThe next subdivision of time was that period, still in the twilight,\r\nwhen the floods fell and covered a large part of the earth, but\r\ngradually gathered themselves together in the lower lands, and left\r\nthe mountains bare. And still the light kept increasing, and the\r\nperiod was again subdivided into evening and morning.\r\n\r\nAnd why does the record, in each case, tell us that the evening and\r\nthe morning \"constituted the day, instead of the morning and the\r\nevening? The answer is plain:--mankind were steadily advancing from\r\ndarkness to light; each stage terminating in greater clearness and\r\nbrightness; they were moving steadily forward to the perfect dawn.\r\nAnd it is a curious fact that the Israelites, even now, commence the\r\nday with the period of darkness: they begin their Sabbath on Friday\r\nat sunset.\r\n\r\nThe third subdivision was that in which the continents cleared\r\nthemselves more and more of the floods, and the increasing light and\r\nwarmth called forth grass and the\r\n\r\n{p. 337}\r\n\r\ntrees, and clothed nature in a mantle of green. Man had come out of\r\nhis cave, and there were scattered remnants of the animal kingdom\r\nhere and there, but the world, in the main, was manless and\r\nlifeless--a scene of waste and desolation.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth subdivision of time, the sun, moon, and stars\r\nappeared;--dimly, and wrapped in clouds, in the evening; clearer and\r\nbrighter in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn the next subdivision of time, the fish, which spawn by the\r\nmillion, and the birds, which quadruple their numbers in a year,\r\nbegan to multiply and scatter themselves, and appear everywhere\r\nthrough the waters and on the land. And still the light kept\r\nincreasing, and \"the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on the sixth day, man and the animals, slower to increase, and\r\nrequiring a longer period to reach maturity, began to spread and show\r\nthemselves everywhere on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nThere was a long interval before man sent out his colonies and\r\nrepossessed the desolated continents. In Europe, as I have shown,\r\ntwelve feet of stalagmite intervenes in the caves between the remains\r\nof pre-glacial and post-glacial man. As this deposit forms at a very\r\nslow rate, it indicates that, for long ages after the great\r\ndestruction, man did not dwell in Europe. Slowly, \"like a great blot\r\nthat spreads,\" the race expanded again over its ancient\r\nbunting-grounds.\r\n\r\nAnd still the skies grew brighter, the storms grew less, the earth\r\ngrew warmer, and \"the evening and the morning\" constituted the sixth\r\nsubdivision of time.\r\n\r\nAnd this process is still going on. Mr. James Geikie says:\r\n\r\n\"We are sure of this, that since the deposition of the shelly clays,\r\nand the disappearance of the latest local glaciers,\r\n\r\n{p. 338}\r\n\r\nthere have been no oscillations, but only a _gradual amelioration of\r\nclimate_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe world, like Milton's lion, is still trying to disengage its\r\nbinder limbs from the superincumbent weight of the Drift. Every\r\nsnow-storm, every chilling blast that blows out from the frozen lips\r\nof the icy North, is but a reminiscence of Ragnarok.\r\n\r\nBut the great cosmical catastrophe was substantially over with the\r\nclose of the sixth day. We are now in the seventh day. The darkness\r\nhas gone; the sun has come back; the waters have returned to their\r\nbounds; vegetation has resumed its place; the fish, the birds, the\r\nanimals, men, are once more populous in ocean, air, and on the land;\r\nthe comet is gone, and the orderly processes of nature are around us,\r\nand God is \"resting\" from the great task of restoring his afflicted\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for some such interpretation as this was apparent to\r\nthe early fathers of the Christian Church, although they possessed no\r\ntheory of a. comet. St. Basil, St. Cæsarius, and Origen, long before\r\nany such theory was dreamed of, argued that the sun, moon, and stars\r\nexisted from the beginning, but that they did not _appear_ until the\r\nfourth day. \"Who,\" says Origen, \"that has sense, can think that the\r\nfirst, second, and third days were without sun, moon, or stars?\"\r\n\r\nBut where were they? Why did they not appear? What obscured them?\r\n\r\nWhat could obscure them but dense clouds? Where did the clouds come\r\nfrom? They were vaporized water. What vaporized the water and caused\r\nthis darkness on the face of the deep, so dense that the sun, moon,\r\nand stars did not appear until the world had clothed itself\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 438.]\r\n\r\n{p. 389}\r\n\r\nagain in vegetation? Tremendous heat. Where did the heat come from?\r\nIf it was not caused by contact with a comet, _what was it_? And if\r\nit was not caused by contact with a comet, how do you explain the\r\nblazing sword at the gate of Eden; the fire falling from heaven on\r\n\"the cities of the plain\"; and the fire that fell on Job's sheep and\r\ncamels and consumed them; and that drove Job to clamber by ropes down\r\ninto the narrow-mouthed bottomless cave; where he tells us of the\r\nleviathan, the twisted, the undulating one, that cast down stones in\r\nthe mire, and made the angels in heaven to tremble, and the deep to\r\nboil like a pot? And is it not more reasonable to suppose that this\r\nsublime religious poem, called the Book of Job, represents the\r\nexaltation of the human soul under the stress of the greatest\r\ncalamity our race has ever endured, than to believe that it is simply\r\na record of the sufferings of some obscure Arab chief from a\r\nloathsome disease? Surely inspiration should reach us through a\r\ndifferent channel; and there should be some proportion between the\r\ngrandeur of the thoughts and the dignity of the events which produced\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd if Origen is right, and it is absurd to suppose that the sun,\r\nmoon, and stars were not created until the third day, then the sacred\r\ntext is dislocated, transposed; and the second chapter narrates\r\nevents which really occurred before those mentioned in the first\r\nchapter; and the \"darkness\" is something which came millions of years\r\nafter that \"Beginning,\" in which God made the earth, and the heavens,\r\nand all the host of them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let us observe how fully the Bible record accords with\r\nthe statements of the Druidical, Hindoo, Scandinavian, and other\r\nlegends, and with the great unwritten theory which underlies all our\r\nreligion. Here we have:\r\n\r\n{p. 340}\r\n\r\n1. The Golden Age; the Paradise.\r\n\r\n2. The universal moral degeneracy of mankind; the age of crime and\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n3. God's vengeance.\r\n\r\n4. The serpent; the fire from heaven.\r\n\r\n5. The cave-life and the darkness.\r\n\r\n6. The cold; the struggle to live.\r\n\r\n7. The \"Fall of Man,\" from virtue to vice; from plenty to poverty;\r\nfrom civilization to barbarism; from the Tertiary to the Drift; from\r\nEden to the gravel.\r\n\r\n8. Reconstruction and regeneration.\r\n\r\nCan all this be accident? Can all this mean nothing?\r\n\r\n{p. 341}\r\n\r\n                               PART IV.\r\n\r\n                            (Conclusions)\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                    WAS PRE-GLACIAL MAN CIVILIZED?\r\n\r\nWE come now to another and very interesting question:\r\n\r\nIn what stage of development was mankind when the Drift fell upon the\r\nearth?\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, difficult to attain to certainties in the\r\nconsideration of an age so remote as this. We are, as it were,\r\ncrawling upon our hands and knees into the dark cavern of an abysmal\r\npast; we know not whether that which we encounter is a stone or a\r\nbone; we can only grope our way. I feel, however, that it is proper\r\nto present such facts as I possess touching this curious question.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion at which I have arrived is, that mankind, prior to the\r\nDrift, had, in some limited localities, reached a high stage of\r\ncivilization, and that many of our most important inventions and\r\ndiscoveries were known in the pre-glacial age. Among these were\r\npottery, metallurgy, architecture, engraving, Carving, the use of\r\nmoney, the domestication of some of our animals, and even the use of\r\nan alphabet. I shall present the proofs of this startling conclusion,\r\nand leave the reader to judge for himself.\r\n\r\n{p. 342}\r\n\r\nWhile this civilized, cultivated race occupied a part of the earth's\r\nsurface, the remainder of the world was peopled by races more rude,\r\nbarbarous, brutal, and animal-like than anything we know of on our\r\nearth to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I shall refer to the legends of mankind, wherein\r\nthey depict the condition of our race in the pre-glacial time. If\r\nthese statements stood alone, we might dismiss them from\r\nconsideration, for there would be a strong probability that later\r\nages, in repeating the legends, would attribute to their remote\r\nancestors the civilized advantages which they themselves enjoyed; but\r\nit will be seen that these statements are confirmed by the remains of\r\nman which have been dug out of the earth, and upon which we can rely\r\nto a much greater extent.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the legends:\r\n\r\nIf I have correctly interpreted Job as a religious drama, founded on\r\nthe fall of the Drift, then we must remember that Job describes the\r\npeople overtaken by the catastrophe as a highly civilized race. They\r\nhad passed the stage of worshiping sticks and stones and idols, and\r\nhad reached to a knowledge of the one true God; they were\r\nagriculturists; they raised flocks of sheep and camels; they built\r\nhouses; they had tamed the horse; they had progressed so far in\r\nastronomical knowledge as to have mapped out the heavens into\r\nconstellations; they wrote books, consequently they possessed an\r\nalphabet; they engraved inscriptions upon the rocks.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said truly that the book of Job, although it may be\r\nreally a description of the Drift catastrophe, was not necessarily\r\nwritten at the time of, or even immediately after, that event. So\r\ngigantic and terrible a thing must have been the overwhelming\r\nconsideration and memory of mankind for thousands of years after it\r\noccurred. We will see that its impress still exists on the\r\n\r\n{p. 343}\r\n\r\nimagination of the race. Hence we may assign to the book of Job an\r\nextraordinary antiquity, and nevertheless it may have been written\r\nlong ages after the events to which it refers occurred; and the\r\nwriter may have clothed those events with the associations and\r\nconditions of the age of its composition. Let us, then, go forward to\r\nthe other legends, for in such a case we can _prove_ nothing. We can\r\nsimply build up cumulative probabilities.\r\n\r\nIn Ovid we read that the Earth, when the dread affliction fell upon\r\nher, cried out:\r\n\r\n\"O sovereign of the gods, if thou approvest of this, if I have\r\ndeserved it, why do thy lightnings linger? . . . And dost thou give\r\nthis as my recompense? This as the reward of my fertility and of my\r\nduty, in that _I endure wounds from the crooked plow and harrows_,\r\nand am harassed all the year through? In that I supply green leaves\r\nto the _cattle_, and _corn_, a wholesome food for mankind, and\r\n_frankincense_ for yourselves? \"\r\n\r\nHere we see that Ovid received from the ancient traditions of his\r\nrace the belief that when the Drift Age came man was already an\r\nagriculturist; he had invented the plow and the barrow; he had\r\ndomesticated the cattle; he had discovered or developed some of the\r\ncereals; and he possessed a religion in which incense was burned\r\nbefore the god or gods. The legend of Phaëton further indicates that\r\nman had tamed the horse and had invented wheeled vehicles.\r\n\r\nIn the Hindoo story of the coming of the demon Ravana, the comet, we\r\nread that he carried off Sita, the wife of Rama, the sun; and that\r\nher name indicates that she represented \"the _furrowed earth_,\" to\r\nwit, a condition of development in which man plowed the fields and\r\nraised crops of food.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the Scandinavian legends, we see\r\n\r\n{p. 344}\r\n\r\nthat those who transmitted them from the early ages believed that\r\npre-glacial man was civilized. The Asas, the godlike, superior race,\r\ndwelt, we are told, \"in stone houses.\"\r\n\r\nIn describing, in the Elder Edda, the corrupt condition of mankind\r\nbefore the great catastrophe occurred, the world, we are told, was\r\ngiven over to all manner of sin and wickedness. We read:\r\n\r\n     \"Brothers will fight together,\r\n     And become each other's bane\r\n     Sisters' children\r\n     Their sib shall spoil.\r\n     Hard is the world;\r\n     Sensual sins grow huge.\r\n     There are _axe_-ages, _sword_-ages\r\n     _Shields_ are cleft in twain,\r\n     There are wind-ages,\r\n     murder-ages,\r\n     Ere the world falls dead.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWhen the great day of wrath comes, Heimdal blows in the\r\nGjallar-_horn_, Odin _rides_ to Mimer's well, Odin puts on his\r\n_golden helmet_, the Asas hold counsel before their _stone doors_.\r\n\r\nAll these things indicate a people who had passed far beyond\r\nbarbarism. Here we have axes, swords, helmets, shields, musical\r\ninstruments, domesticated horses, the use of gold, and stone\r\nbuildings. And after the great storm was over, and the remnant of\r\nmankind crept out of the caves, and came back to reoccupy the houses\r\nof the slain millions, we read of the delight with which they found\r\nin the grass \"the golden tablets\" of the _Asas_--additional proof\r\nthat they worked in the metals, and possessed some kind of a written\r\nlanguage; they also had \"the runes,\" or runic letters of Odin.\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Vala's Prophecy,\" 48, 49.]\r\n\r\n{p. 345}\r\n\r\nIn the Norse legends we read that Loke, the evil genius, carried off\r\nIduna, and her _apples_.\r\n\r\nAnd when we turn to the American legends, similar statements present\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWe see the people, immediately after the catastrophe, sending a\r\nmessenger to the happy eastern land, over the sea, by a bridge, to\r\nprocure drums and other musical instruments; we learn from the Aztecs\r\nthat while the darkness yet prevailed, the people built a sumptuous\r\n_palace_, a masterpiece of skill, and on the top of it they placed an\r\n_axe of copper_, the edge being uppermost, and on this axe the\r\nheavens rested.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Navajos, shut up in their cave, had flute-players with them. The\r\nPeruvians were dug out of their cave with a golden _spade_. In the\r\nTahoe legend, we read that the superior race compelled the inferior\r\nto build a great _temple_ for their protection from floods; and the\r\noppressed people escaped in _canoes_, while the world blazes behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Navajos came out of the cave, we find them, according\r\nto the legend, possessed of water-jars, and we have references to the\r\ndivision of the heavens into constellations.\r\n\r\nIn the Arabian legend of the City of Brass, we are told that the\r\npeople who were destroyed were great architects, metallurgists,\r\nagriculturists, and machinists, and that they possessed a written\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the more reliable evidences of man's condition, which\r\nhave been exhumed from the caves and the Drift.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, Fray Pedro Simon relates that some\r\nminers, running an adit into a hill near Callao,\r\n\r\n[1. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 71.]\r\n\r\n{p. 346}\r\n\r\n\"met with a ship, _which had on top of it the great mass of the\r\nhill_, and did not agree in its make and appearance with our ships.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Clerk describes a canoe found near Edinburgh, in 1726. \"The\r\nwashings of the river Carron discovered a _boat thirteen or fourteen\r\nfeet under ground_; it is thirty-six feet long and four and a half\r\nbroad, all of one piece of oak. There were several strata above it,\r\nsuch as loam, clay, shells, moss, sand, and gravel.\"\r\n\r\nBoucher de Perthes found remains of man _thirty to forty feet_ below\r\nthe surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the following we have the evidence that the pre-glacial race was\r\nacquainted with the use of fire, and cooked their food:\r\n\r\n\"In the construction of a canal between Stockholm and Gothenburg, it\r\nwas necessary to cut through one of those hills called _osars_, or\r\nerratic blocks, which were deposited by the Drift ice during the\r\nglacial epoch. Beneath an immense accumulation of osars, with shells\r\nand sand, there was discovered _in the deepest layer of subsoil, at a\r\ndepth of about sixty feet_, a circular mass of stones, forming a\r\nhearth, in the middle of which there were wood-coals. No other hand\r\nthan that of man could have performed the work.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIn the State of Louisiana, on Petite Anse Island, remarkable\r\ndiscoveries have been made.[3]\r\n\r\nAt considerable depths below the surface of the earth, fifteen to\r\ntwenty feet, _immediately overlying the salt-rocks_, and _underneath_\r\nwhat Dr. Foster believes to be the equivalent of the _Drift_ in\r\nEurope, \"associated with the bones of elephants and other huge\r\nextinct quadrupeds,\" \"incredible quantities of _pottery_ were found\";\r\nin some\r\n\r\n[1. Tylor's \"Early Mankind,\" p. 330.\r\n\r\n2. Maclean's \"Manual of Antiquity of Man,\" p. 60; Buchner, p. 242.\r\n\r\n3. Foster's \"Prehistoric Races,\" p. 56, etc.]\r\n\r\n{p. 347}\r\n\r\ncases these remains of pottery formed \"veritable strata, three and\r\nsix inches thick\"; in many cases the bones of the mastodon were found\r\n_above_ these strata of pottery. Fragments of baskets and matting\r\nwere also found.\r\n\r\nHere we have evidence of the long-continued occupation of this spot\r\nby man prior to the Drift Age, and that the human family had\r\nprogressed far enough to manufacture pottery, and weave baskets and\r\nmatting.\r\n\r\nThe cave of Chaleux, Belgium, was buried by a mass of rubbish caused\r\nby the falling in of the roof, consequently preserving all its\r\nimplements. There were found the split bones of mammals, and the\r\nbones of birds and fishes. There was an immense number of objects,\r\nchiefly manufactured from reindeer-horn, such as needles,\r\narrow-heads, daggers, and hooks. Besides these, there were ornaments\r\nmade of shells, pieces of slate with engraved figures, mathematical\r\nlines, remains of very coarse pottery, hearthstones, ashes, charcoal,\r\nand last, but not least, thirty thousand worked flints mingled with\r\nthe broken bones. In the hearth, placed in the center of the cave,\r\nwas discovered a stone, with certain but unintelligible signs\r\nengraved upon it. M. Dupont also found about twenty pounds of the\r\nbones of the water-rat, either scorched or roasted.[1]\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n         EARTHEN VASE, FOUND IN THE CAVE OF FURFOOZ, BELGIUM.\r\n\r\n[1. Maclean's \"Antiquity of Man,\" p. 87.]\r\n\r\n{p. 348}\r\n\r\nHere we have the evidence that the people who inhabited this cave, or\r\nsome race with whom they held intercourse, manufactured pottery; that\r\nthey wore clothing which they sewed with needles; that they used the\r\nbow and arrow; that they caught fish with hooks; that they ornamented\r\nthemselves; that they cooked their food; that they engraved on stone;\r\nand that they had already reached some kind of primitive alphabet, in\r\nwhich signs were used to represent things.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, (page 124, _ante_,) that there is reason to\r\nbelieve that pre-glacial Europe contained a very barbarous race,\r\nrepresented by the Neanderthal skull, side by side with a cultivated\r\nrace, represented by the fine lines and full brow of the Engis skull.\r\nThe latter race, I have suggested, may have come among the former as\r\ntraders, or have been captured in war; precisely as today in Central\r\nAfrica the skulls of adventurous, civilized Portuguese or Englishmen\r\nor Americans might be found side by side with the rude skulls of the\r\nsavage populations of the country. The possession of a piece of\r\npottery, or carving, by an African tribe would not prove that the\r\nAfricans possessed the arts of engraving or manufacturing pottery,\r\nbut it would prove that somewhere on the earth's surface a race had\r\nadvanced far enough, at that time, to be capable of such works of\r\nart. And so, in the remains of the pre-glacial age of Europe, we have\r\nthe evidence that some of these people, or their captives, or those\r\nwith whom they traded or fought, had gone so far in the training of\r\ncivilized life as to have developed a sense of art and a capacity to\r\nrepresent living forms in pictures or carvings, with a considerable\r\ndegree of taste and skill. And these works are found in the most\r\nancient caves, \"the archaic caves,\" associated with the bones of the\r\nanimals _that ceased to exist in Europe at the time of the_\r\n\r\n{p. 349}\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n               PRE-GLACIAL MAN'S PICTURE OF THE MAMMOTH\r\n\r\n{p. 350}\r\n\r\n_Drift deposits_. Nay, more, a picture of a mammoth has been found\r\nengraved _upon a piece of mammoth-tusk_. The engraving on page 349\r\nrepresents this most curious work of art.\r\n\r\nThe man who carved this must have seen the creature it represented;\r\nand, as the mammoth did not survive the Drift, that man must have\r\nlived before or during the Drift. And he was no savage. Says Sir John\r\nLubbock:\r\n\r\n\"No representation, however rude, of any animal has yet been found in\r\nany of the Danish shell-mounds, or the Stone-Age lake-villages. Even\r\non objects of the Bronze Age they are so rare that it is doubtful\r\nwhether a single well-authenticated instance could be produced.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn the Dordogne caves the following spirited drawing was found,\r\nrepresenting a group of reindeer:\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                PRE-GLACIAL MAN'S PICTURE OF REINDEER.\r\n\r\nHere it would appear as if the reindeer were fastened together by\r\nlines or reins; if so, it implies that they were\r\n\r\n[1. \"Prehistoric Times,\" p. 333.]\r\n\r\n{p. 351}\r\n\r\ndomesticated. In this picture they seem to have become entangled in\r\ntheir lines, and some have fallen to the ground.\r\n\r\nAnd it does not follow from the presence of the reindeer that the\r\nclimate was Lapland-like. The ancestors of all our so-called Arctic\r\nanimals must have lived during the mild climate of the Tertiary Age;\r\nand those only survived after the Drift, in the north, that were\r\ncapable of accommodating themselves to the cold; the rest perished or\r\nmoved southwardly.\r\n\r\nAnother group of animals was found, engraved on a piece of the palm\r\nof a reindeer's horn, as follows:\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                PRE-GLACIAL MAN'S PICTURE OF THE HORSE.\r\n\r\nHere the man stands alongside the horse's head--a very natural\r\nposition if the horse was domesticated, a very improbable one if he\r\nwas not.\r\n\r\nPieces of pottery have also been found accompanying these palæolithic\r\nremains of man.\r\n\r\nThe oldest evidence of the existence of man is probably the fragment\r\nof a cut rib from the Pliocenes of Tuscany, preserved in the museum\r\nat Florence; it was associated with flint-flakes and _a piece of rude\r\npottery_.[1]\r\n\r\nBut the art-capacity of these people was not limited to the drawing\r\nof animals; they also carved figures out\r\n\r\n[1. Dawkins's \"Early Man in Britain,\" p. 91.]\r\n\r\n{p. 352}\r\n\r\nof hard substances. The following engraving represents a poniard cut\r\nfrom a reindeer's horn.\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                  A SPECIMEN OF PRE-GLACIAL CARVING.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock says:\r\n\r\n\"The artist bas ingeniously adapted the position of the animal to the\r\nnecessities of the case. The horns are thrown back on the neck, the\r\nfore-legs are doubled up under the belly, and the hind-legs are\r\nstretched out along the blade.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThese things seem to indicate quite an advanced condition; the people\r\nwho made them manufactured pottery, possessed. domesticated animals,\r\nand were able to engrave and carve images of living objects. It is\r\ndifficult to believe that they could have carved and engraved these\r\nhard substances without metallic gravers or tools of some kind.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see, on page 130, _ante_, a representation of a\r\nsienite plummet found _thirty feet below the surface_, in a well, in\r\nthe San Joaquin Valley, California, which Professor Foster pronounces\r\nto be--\r\n\r\n\"A finer exhibition of the lapidary's skill than has yet been\r\nfurnished by the Stone Age of either continent. \"[2]\r\n\r\n[1. \"Prehistoric Times,\" p. 335.\r\n\r\n2. Foster's \"Prehistoric Races of the United States,\" p. 56.]\r\n\r\n{p. 353}\r\n\r\nThe following picture represents a curious image carved out of black\r\nmarble, about twice as large as the cut, found near Marlboro, Stark\r\nCounty, Ohio, by some workmen, while digging a well, at a depth of\r\n_twelve feet below the surface_. The ground above it had never been\r\ndisturbed. It was imbedded in _sand and gravel_. The black or\r\nvariegated marble out of which this image is carved has not been\r\nfound in place in Ohio.\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n                      STONE IMAGE FOUND IN OHIO\r\n\r\nT. W. Kinney, of Portsmouth, Ohio, writes as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Last summer, while digging a vault for drainage, at the _depth of\r\ntwenty-seven feet_, the workmen found the tusk of a mastodon. The\r\npiece was about four feet long and four inches in diameter at the\r\nthickest part. It was nearly all lost, having, crumbled very much\r\nwhen exposed to the air. I have a large piece of it; also several\r\nflakes of flint found near the same depth.\r\n\r\n\"I also have several of the flakes from other vaults, some of which\r\nshow evidence of work.\r\n\r\n\"We also found a log at the depth of _twenty-two feet_. The log was\r\n_burned at one end_, and at the other end was a _gap, the same as an\r\naxeman's kerf_. Shell-banks below the level of the base of\r\nmound-builders' works, from six to fifteen feet.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWas this burned log, thus found at a depth of twenty-two feet, a\r\nrelic of the great conflagration? Was that\r\n\r\n[1. \"American Antiquarian,\" April, 1878, p. 36.]\r\n\r\n{p. 354}\r\n\r\naxe-kerf made by some civilized man who wielded a bronze or iron\r\nweapon?\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that _burned_ logs have, in repeated instances,\r\nbeen exhumed from great depths in the Drift clay.\r\n\r\nWhile this work is going through the press, an article has appeared\r\nin \"Harper's Monthly Magazine,\" (September, 1882, p. 609,) entitled\r\n\"The Mississippi River Problem,\" written by David A. Curtis, in which\r\nthe author says:\r\n\r\n\"When La Salle found out how goodly a land it was, his report was the\r\nwarrant of eviction that drove out the red man to make place for the\r\nwhite, as the mound-builders had made place for the Indian in what we\r\ncall the days of old. Yet it must have been only yesterday that the\r\nmound-builders wrought in the valley, for in the few centuries that\r\nhave elapsed since then the surface of the ground has risen only a\r\nfew feet--not enough to bury their works out of sight. How long ago,\r\nthen, must it have been that the race lived there whose pavements and\r\ncisterns of Roman brick now lie _seventy feet underground_?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis does not mean that the bricks found in this prehistoric\r\nsettlement had any historical connection with Rome, but simply that\r\nthey resemble Roman bricks. These remains, I learn, were discovered\r\nin the vicinity of Memphis, Tennessee. The details have not yet, so\r\nfar as I am aware, been published.\r\n\r\nIs it not more reasonable to suppose that civilized man existed on\r\nthe American Continent thirty thousand years ago, (the age fixed by\r\ngeologists for the coming of the Drift,) a comparatively short period\r\nof time, and that his works were then covered by the Drift-_débris_,\r\nthan to believe that a race of human beings, far enough advanced in\r\ncivilization to manufacture bricks, and build pavements and cisterns,\r\ndwelt in the Mississippi Valley, in a past so inconceivably remote\r\nthat the slow increase of the soil,\r\n\r\n{p. 355}\r\n\r\nby vegetable decay, has covered their works to the depth of _seventy\r\nfeet_?\r\n\r\nI come now to the most singular and marvelous revelation of all:\r\n\r\nProfessor Alexander Winchell, in an interesting and recent work,[1]\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"I had in my possession for some time a copper relic resembling a\r\nrude coin, which was taken from an artesian boring at the depth of\r\n_one hundred and fourteen feet_, at Lawn Ridge, Marshall County,\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. W. H. Wilmot, then of Lawn Ridge, furnished me, in a letter\r\ndated December 4, 1871, the following statement of deposits pierced\r\nin the boring:\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Soil                     3 feet.\r\n\r\n                   Yellow clay              17 \"\r\n\r\n                   Blue clay                44 \"\r\n\r\n                   Dark vegetable matter    4 \"\r\n\r\n                   Hard purplish clay       18 \"\r\n\r\n                   Bright green clay        8 \"\r\n\r\n                   Mottled clay             18 \"\r\n\r\n                   Soil                     2 \"\r\n\r\n                   Depth of coin            114 \"\r\n\r\n                   Yellow clay              1 \"\r\n\r\n                   Sand and clay.\r\n\r\n                   Water, rising 60 feet.\r\n\r\n\"In a letter of the 27th of December, written from Chillicothe,\r\nIllinois, he stated that the bore was four inches for eighty feet,\r\nand three inches for the remainder of the depth. But before one\r\nhundred feet had been reached the four-inch portion was 'so plastered\r\nover as to be itself but three inches in diameter,' and hence the\r\n'coin' could not have come from any depth less than _eighty feet_.\r\n\r\n\"'Three persons saw \"the coin\" at the same instant, and each claims\r\nit.' This so-called coin was about the\r\n\r\n[1. \"Sparks from a Geologist's Hammer,\" p. 170.]\r\n\r\n{p. 356}\r\n\r\nthickness and size of a silver quarter of a dollar, and was of\r\n_remarkably uniform thickness_. It was approximately round, and\r\n_seemed to have been cut_. Its two faces bore marks as shown in the\r\nfigure, _but they were not stamped as with a die nor engraved_. They\r\nlooked as if _etched_\r\n\r\n                                ### ###\r\n\r\n   COPPER COIN, FOUND ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN FEET UNDER GROUND IN\r\n                              ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\n_with acid_. The character of the marks was partly unintelligible. On\r\neach side, however, was a rude outline of a human figure. One of\r\nthese held in one hand an object resembling a child, while the other\r\nwas raised as if in the act of striking. The figure wore a\r\nhead-dress, apparently made of quills. _Around the border were\r\nundecipherable hieroglyphics_. The figure on the opposite side\r\nextended only to the waist, and had also one hand upraised. This was\r\nfurnished _with long tufts like mule's ears_. Around the border was\r\nanother circle of hieroglyphics. On this side also was a rude outline\r\nof a quadruped. I exhibited this relic to the Geological Section of\r\nthe American Association, at its meeting at Buffalo in 1876. The\r\ngeneral impression seemed to be that its origin could not date from\r\nthe epoch of the stratum in which it is represented to have been\r\nfound. One person thought he could detect a rude representation of\r\nthe signs of the zodiac around the border. Another fancied he could\r\ndiscover numerals, and even dates. No one could even offer any\r\nexplanation of the objects or the circumstances of its discovery. The\r\nfigures bear a close resemblance to rude drawings executed on\r\nbirch-bark and rock surfaces by the American Indians. _But by what\r\nmeans were they etched_? And by what means was _the uniform thickness\r\nof the copper produced_?\r\n\r\n{p. 357}\r\n\r\nThis object was sent by the owner to the Smithsonian Institution for\r\nexamination, and Secretary Henry referred it to Mr. William E.\r\nDubois, who presented the result of his investigation to the American\r\nPhilosophical Society. _Mr. Dubois felt sure that the object had\r\npassed through a rolling-mill, and he thought the cut edges gave\r\nfurther evidence of the machine-shop_. 'All things considered,' he\r\nsaid, 'I can not regard this Illinois piece as _ancient_ nor _old_\r\n(observing the usual distinction), nor yet recent; because the tooth\r\nof time is plainly visible.' He could suggest nothing to clear up the\r\nmystery. Professor J. P. Lesley thought it might be an astrological\r\namulet. He detected upon it the signs of Pisces and Leo. He read the\r\ndate 1572. He said, 'The piece was placed there as a practical joke.'\r\nHe thought it might be Hispano-American or French-American in origin.\r\nthe suggestion of 'a practical joke' is itself something which must\r\nbe taken as a joke. No person in possession of this interesting\r\nobject would willingly part with it; least of all would he throw so\r\nsmall an object into a hole where not one chance in a thousand\r\nexisted that it would ever be seen again by any person.\r\n\r\n\"If this object does not date from the age of the stratum from which\r\nobtained, it can only be a relic of the sixteenth or seventeenth\r\ncentury, buried beneath the alluvium deposited more recently by the\r\nIllinois River. The country is a level prairie, and 'Peoria Lake' is\r\nan expansion of the river ten miles long and a mile and a half broad.\r\nIt is certainly possible that in such a region deep alluvial deposits\r\nmay have formed since the visits of the French in the latter part of\r\nthe seventeenth century. _But it is not easy to admit an accumulation\r\nof one hundred and fourteen or one hundred and twenty-feet_, since\r\nsuch a depth extends too much below the surface of the river. In\r\nWhiteside County, fifty miles northwest from Peoria County, about\r\n1851, according to Mr. Moffat, _a large copper ring was found one\r\nhundred and twenty feet beneath the surface_, as also something which\r\nhas been compared to a boat-hook. Several other objects have been\r\nfound at less depths, including _stone pipes and pottery, and a\r\nspear-shaped hatchet_, MADE OF IRON. If these\r\n\r\n{p. 358}\r\n\r\nare not 'ancient,' their occurrence at depths of ten, forty, fifty,\r\nand one hundred and twenty feet must be explained as I have suggested\r\nin reference to the 'coin.' An instrument of iron is a strong\r\nindication of the civilized origin of all.\"\r\n\r\nThis is indeed an extraordinary revelation. Here we have a copper\r\nmedal, very much like a coin, inscribed with alphabetical or\r\nhieroglyphical signs, which, when placed under the microscope, in the\r\nhands of a skeptical investigator, satisfies him that it is not\r\nrecent, and that it _passed through a rolling-mill and was cut by a\r\nmachine_.\r\n\r\nIf it is not recent, if the tooth of time is plainly seen on it, it\r\nis not a modern fraud; if it is not a modern fraud, then it is really\r\nthe coin of some pre-Columbian people. The Indians possessed no\r\ncurrency or alphabet, so that it dates back of the red-men. Nothing\r\nsimilar has been found in the hundreds of American mounds that have\r\nbeen opened, so that it dates back of the mound-builders.\r\n\r\nIt comes from a depth of _not less than eighty feet in glacial clay_,\r\ntherefore it is profoundly ancient.\r\n\r\nIt is engraved after a method _utterly unknown to any civilized\r\nnation on earth, within the range of recorded history_. IT IS\r\nENGRAVED WITH ACID!\r\n\r\nIt belongs, therefore, to a civilization unlike any we know of. If it\r\nhad been derived from any other human civilization, the makers, at\r\nthe same time they borrowed the round, metallic form of the coin,\r\nwould have borrowed also the mold or the stamp. But they did not; and\r\nyet they possessed a rolling-mill and a machine to cut out the coin.\r\n\r\nWhat do we infer? That there is a relationship between our\r\ncivilization and this, but it is a relationship in which this\r\nrepresents the parent; and the round metallic\r\n\r\n{p. 359}\r\n\r\ncoins of historical antiquity were derived from it, but without the\r\nart of engraving by the use of acid.\r\n\r\nIt does not stand alone, but at great depths in the same clay\r\n_implements of copper and of_ IRON _are found_.\r\n\r\nWhat does all this indicate?\r\n\r\nThat far below the present level of the State of Illinois, in the\r\ndepths of the glacial clays, about one hundred or one hundred and\r\ntwenty feet below the present surface of the land, there are found\r\nthe evidences of a high civilization. For a coin with an inscription\r\nupon it implies a high civilization:--it implies an alphabet, a\r\nliterature, a government, commercial relations, organized society,\r\nregulated agriculture, which could alone sustain all these; and some\r\nimplement like a plow, without which extensive agriculture is not\r\npossible; and this in turn implies domesticated animals to draw the\r\nplow. The presence of the coin, and of implements of copper and iron,\r\nproves that mankind had passed far beyond the Stone Age. And these\r\nviews are confirmed by the pavements and cisterns of brick found\r\nseventy feet below the surface in the lower Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nThere is a Pompeii, a Herculaneum, somewhere, underneath central and\r\nnorthwestern Illinois or Tennessee, of the most marvelous character;\r\nnot of Egypt, Assyria, or the Roman Empire, things of yesterday, but\r\nbelonging to an inconceivable antiquity; to pre-glacial times; to a\r\nperiod ages before the flood of Noah;--a civilization which was\r\ndrowned and deluged out of sight under the immeasurable clay-flood of\r\nthe comet.\r\n\r\nMan crawled timidly backward into the history of the past over his\r\nlittle limit of six thousand years; and at the farther end of his\r\ntether he found the perfect civilization of early Egypt. He rises to\r\nhis feet and looks still backward, and the vista of history spreads\r\nand\r\n\r\n{p. 360}\r\n\r\nspreads to antediluvian times. Here at last he thinks he has reached\r\nthe beginning of things: here man first domesticated the animals;\r\nhere he first worked in copper and iron; here he possessed for the\r\nfirst time an alphabet, a government, commerce, and coinage. And, lo!\r\nfrom the bottom of well-holes in Illinois, one hundred and fourteen\r\nfeet deep, the buckets of the artesian-well auger bring up copper\r\nrings and iron hatchets and engraved coins--engraved by a means\r\nunknown to historical mankind--and we stand face to face with a\r\ncivilization so old that man will not willingly dare to put it into\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nHere we are in the presence of that great, but possibly brutal and\r\nsensual development of man's powers, \"the sword-ages, the axe-ages,\r\nthe murder-ages of the Goths,\" of which God cleared the earth when he\r\nburied the mastodon under the Drift for ever.\r\n\r\nHow petty, how almost insignificant, how school-boy-like are our\r\nhistorians, with their little rolls of parchment under their arms,\r\ncontaining their lists of English, Roman, Egyptian, and Assyrian\r\nkings and queens, in the presence of such stupendous facts as these!\r\n\r\nGood reader, your mind shrinks back from such conceptions, of course.\r\nBut can you escape the facts by shrinking back? Are they not there?\r\nAre they not all of a piece--Job, Ovid, Rama, Ragnarok, Genesis, the\r\nAztec legends; the engraved ivory tablets of the caves, the pottery,\r\nthe carved figures of pre-glacial Europe; the pottery-strata of\r\nLouisiana under the Drift; the copper and iron implements, the brick\r\npavements and cisterns, and this coin, dragged up from well-holes in\r\nIllinois?\r\n\r\nAnd what do they affirm?\r\n\r\nThat this catastrophe was indeed THE FALL OF MAN.\r\n\r\nThink what a fall!\r\n\r\nFrom comfort to misery; from plowed fields to the\r\n\r\n{p. 361}\r\n\r\nthistles and the stones; from sunny and glorious days in a stormless\r\nland to the awful trials of the Drift Age; the rains, the cold, the\r\nsnow, the ice, the incessant tempests, the darkness, the poverty, the\r\ncoats of hides, the cave-life, the cannibalism, the Stone Age.\r\n\r\nHere was a fall indeed.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in antiquity that has not a meaning. The very fables\r\nof the world's childhood should be sacred from our laughter.\r\n\r\nOur theology, even where science has most ridiculed it, is based on a\r\ngreat, a gigantic truth. Paradise, the summer land of fruits, the\r\nserpent, the fire from heaven, the expulsion, the waving sword, the\r\n\"fall of man,\" the \"darkness on the face of the deep,\" the age of\r\ntoil and sweat--all, all, are literal facts.\r\n\r\nAnd could we but penetrate their meaning, the trees of life and\r\nknowledge and the apples of paradise probably represent likewise\r\ngreat and important facts or events in the history of our race.\r\n\r\nAnd with what slow steps did mankind struggle upward! In some favored\r\ngeographical center they recovered the arts of metallurgy, the\r\ndomestication of animals, and the alphabet.\r\n\r\n\"All knowledge,\" says the Hindoo Krishna, \"was originally bestowed on\r\nmankind by God. They lost it. They recovered it as a recollection.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor barbarian Indians of America possess traditions of this\r\nancient civilization, traditions in forms as rude as their own\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIt was represented by the Great Hare, Manibozho, or Nanaboshu.\r\n\r\nDo we not find his typical picture, with those great mule-tufts,\r\n(referred to by Professor Winchell,) the hare-like ears, on this coin\r\nof Illinois?\r\n\r\n{p. 362}\r\n\r\nRead what the Indians tell of this great being\r\n\r\n\"From the remotest wilds of the Northwest,\" says Dr. Brinton, \"to the\r\ncoast of the Atlantic, from the southern boundaries of Carolina to\r\nthe cheerless swamps of Hudson's Bay, the Algonquins were never tired\r\nof gathering around the winter fire and repeating the story of\r\nManibozho or Michabo, the _Great Hare_. With entire unanimity their\r\nvarious branches, the Powhatans of Virginia, the Lenni-Lenape of the\r\nDelaware, the warlike hordes of New England, the Ottawas of the far\r\nNorth, and the Western tribes, perhaps without exception, spoke of\r\nthis 'chimerical beast,' as one of the old missionaries calls it as\r\n_their common ancestor_. The totem or clan which bore his name was\r\nlooked up to with peculiar respect. . . .\r\n\r\n\"What he really was we must seek in the accounts of older travelers,\r\nin the invocations of the _jossakeeds_ or prophets, and in the part\r\nassigned to him in the solemn mysteries of religion. In these we find\r\nhim portrayed as the patron and founder of the Meda worship, _the\r\ninventor of picture-writing_, the father and guardian of their\r\nnation, the ruler of the winds, even the maker and preserver of the\r\nworld and creator of the sun and moon. From a grain of sand brought\r\nfrom the bottom of the primeval ocean, he fashioned the habitable\r\nland, and set it floating on the waters till it grew to such a size\r\nthat a strong young wolf, running constantly, died of old age ere he\r\nreached its limits. . . . He was the founder of the medicine-hunt. .\r\n. . He himself was a _mighty hunter_ of old. . . . Attentively\r\nwatching the spider spread its web to trap unwary flies, _he devised\r\nthe art of knitting nets to catch fish_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThis is a barbarian's recollection of a great primeval civilized race\r\nwho established religion, invented nets, and, as the other legends\r\nconcerning him show, first made the bow and arrow and worked in the\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to think the division of the people into\r\nseveral classes, or families, who take the name of\r\n\r\n[1. \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 175.]\r\n\r\n{p. 363}\r\n\r\nsome animal whose picture is their _totem_, dates back to the very\r\nbeginning of the human race. The animal fables, as I have suggested,\r\ngrew out of these animal _totems_; we find them everywhere among the\r\nAmerican tribes; and in some cases they are accompanied by mental and\r\nphysical traits which may be supposed to indicate that they\r\noriginated in primal race differences. This is the belief of Warren,\r\nthe native historian of the Ojibways. I am indebted to Hon. H. Al.\r\nRice, of St. Paul, for an opportunity to examine his valuable\r\nmanuscript history of that tribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nThe great _totem_ of the Algonquins is the Hare; he represents a\r\nruling class, and is associated with recollections of this Great\r\nHare, this demi-god, this man or race, who taught them all the arts\r\nof life with which they are acquainted. Then there is a _turtle\r\ntotem_, associated with myths of the turtle or tortoise, which are\r\nthe images all over the world of an island.[1]\r\n\r\nAnd when we cross the Atlantic we find[2] that the Arabs are divided\r\nup in the same way into tribes bearing animal names.\r\n\r\n\"_Asad_, lion; 'a number of tribes.' _Aws_, wolf; 'a tribe of the\r\nAncar, or Defenders.' _Badau_, ibex; 'a tribe of the Kalb and\r\nothers.' _Tha'laba_, she-fox; 'a name of tribes.' _Garad_, locusts;\r\n'a sub-tribe of the Azol.' _Thawr_, bull; 'a sub-tribe of Hamdan and\r\nof Abel Manah.' _Gahah_, colt of an ass; 'a sub-tribe of the Arabs.'\r\n_Hida'_, kite; 'a sub-tribe of Murad.'\r\n\r\n\"The origin of all names is referred, in the genealogical system of\r\nthe Arabs, to an ancestor who bore the tribal or gentile name. Thus\r\nthe _Kalb_ or dog-tribe consists of the Beni-Kalb--sons of Kalb (the\r\ndog), who is in turn son of Wabra (the female rock-badger), son of\r\nTha'laba\r\n\r\n[1. Tylor's \"Early History of Mankind.\"\r\n\r\n2. W. J. F. Maclennan, \"Fortnightly Review,\" 1869 and 1870.]\r\n\r\n{p. 364}\r\n\r\n(the she-fox), great-grandson of Quoda'a, grandson of Saba', the\r\nSheba of Scripture. A single member of the tribe is Kalbi--a\r\nKalbite--_Caninus_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same names which appear as _totem_ tribes reach through Edom,\r\nMidian, and Moab, into the land of Canaan.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAmong the Jews there was the stock of the serpent, Nashon, to which\r\nDavid belonged; and there is no doubt that they were once divided\r\ninto totemic families.\r\n\r\nAnd in all this we see another proof of the race-identity of the\r\npeoples on the opposite sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nPermit me to close this chapter with a suggestion:\r\n\r\nIs there not energy enough among the archæologists of the United\r\nStates to make a thorough examination of some part of the deep clay\r\ndeposits of Central Illinois or of those wonderful remains referred\r\nto by Mr. Curtis?\r\n\r\nIf one came and proved that at a given point he had found indications\r\nof a coal-bed or a gold-mine, he would have no difficulty in\r\nobtaining means enough to dig a shaft and excavate acres. Can not the\r\ngreed for information do one tenth as much as the greed for profit?\r\n\r\nWho can tell what extraordinary revelations wait below the vast mass\r\nof American glacial clay? For it must be remembered that the articles\r\nalready found have been discovered in the narrow holes bored or dug\r\nfor wells. How small is the area laid bare by such punctures in the\r\nearth compared with the whole area of the country in which they are\r\nsunk! How remarkable that _anything_ should have been found under\r\nsuch circumstances! How probable, therefore, that the remains of man\r\nare numerous at a certain depth!\r\n\r\nWhere a coin is found we might reasonably expect to\r\n\r\n[1. W. J. F. Maclennan, \"Fortnightly Review,\" 1869 and 1870.]\r\n\r\n{p. 365}\r\n\r\nfind other works of copper, and all those things which would\r\naccompany the civilization of a people working in the metals and\r\nusing a currency,--such as cities, houses, temples, etc. Of course,\r\nsuch things might exist, and yet many shafts might be sunk without\r\ncoming upon any of them. But is not the attempt worth making?\r\n\r\n{p. 366}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                      THE SCENE OF MAN'S SURVIVAL\r\n\r\nLET us pass to another speculation:\r\n\r\nThe reader is not constrained to accept my conclusions. They will, I\r\ntrust, provoke further discussion, which may tend to prove or\r\ndisprove them.\r\n\r\nBut I think I can see that many of these legends point to an island,\r\neast of America and west of Europe, that is to say in the Atlantic\r\nOcean, as the scene where man, or at least our own portion of the\r\nhuman race, including the white, yellow, and brown races, survived\r\nthe great cataclysm and renewed the civilization of the pro-glacial\r\nage and that from this center, in the course of ages, they spread\r\neast and west, until they reached the plains of Asia and the islands\r\nof the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe negro race, it seems probable, may have separated from our own\r\nstock in pre-glacial times, and survived, in fragments, somewhere in\r\nthe land of torrid heats, probably in some region on which the Drift\r\ndid not fall.\r\n\r\nWe are told by Ovid that it was the tremendous heat of the comet-age\r\nthat baked the negro black; in this Ovid doubtless spoke the opinion\r\nof antiquity. Whether or not that period of almost insufferable\r\ntemperature produced any effect upon the color of that race I shall\r\nnot undertake to say; nor shall I dare to assert that the white race\r\nwas bleached to its present complexion by the long absence of the sun\r\nduring the Age of Darkness.\r\n\r\n{p. 367}\r\n\r\nIt is true Professor Hartt tells us[1] that there is a marked\r\ndifference in the complexion of the Botocudo Indians who have lived\r\nin the forests of Brazil and those, of the same tribe, who have dwelt\r\non its open prairies; and that those who have resided for hundreds,\r\nperhaps thousands, of years in the dense forests of that tropical\r\nland are nearly white in complexion. If this be the case in a merely\r\nleaf-covered tract, what must have been the effect upon a race\r\ndwelling for a long time in the remote north, in the midst of a humid\r\natmosphere, enveloped in constant clouds, and much of the time in\r\nalmost total darkness?\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that here and then were developed the rude,\r\npowerful, terrible \"ice-giants\" of the legends, out of whose\r\nferocity, courage, vigor, and irresistible energy have been evolved\r\nthe dominant races of the west of Europe--the land-grasping,\r\nconquering, colonizing races; the men of whom it was said by a Roman\r\npoet, in the Viking Age: \"The sea is their school of war and the\r\nstorm their friend they are sea-wolves that prey on the pillage of\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nThey are now taking possession of the globe.\r\n\r\nGreat races are the weeded-out survivors of great sufferings.\r\n\r\nWhat are the proofs of my proposition that man survived on an\r\nAtlantic island?\r\n\r\nIn the first place we find Job referring to \"the _island_ of the\r\ninnocent.\"\r\n\r\nIn chapter xxii, verse 29, Eliphaz, the Temanite, says\r\n\r\nWhen men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and\r\nhe shall save the humble person.\"\r\n\r\nWhere shall he save him? The next verse (30) seems to tell\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Geology of Brazil,\" p. 589.]\r\n\r\n{p. 368}\r\n\r\n\"He shall deliver _the island of the innocent_: and _it is delivered_\r\nby the pureness of thine [Job's] hands.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as I have shown, in Genesis it appears that, after the Age of\r\nDarkness, God separated the floods which overwhelmed the earth and\r\nmade a firmament, a place of solidity, a refuge, (chap. i, vs. 6, 7,)\r\n\"in the midst of the waters.\" A firm place in the _midst_ of the\r\nwaters is necessarily an island.\r\n\r\nAnd the location of this Eden was westward from. Europe, for we read,\r\n(chap. iii, v. 24):\r\n\r\n\"So he drove out the man; and he placed _at the_ EAST _of the garden\r\nof Eden_ cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to\r\nkeep the way of the tree of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe man driven out of the Edenic land was, therefore, driven\r\n_eastward_ of Eden, and the cherubims in the east of Eden faced him.\r\nThe land where the Jews dwelt was eastward of paradise; in other\r\nwords, paradise was west of them.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, when Cain was driven out be too moved _eastward_; he\r\n\"dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden,\" (chap. iv, verse\r\n16.) There was, therefore, a constant movement of the human family\r\neastward. The land of Nod may have been _Od_, _Ad_, Atlantis; and\r\nfrom _Od_ may have come the name of _Odin_, the king, the god of\r\nRagnarok.\r\n\r\nIn Ovid \"the earth\" is contradistinguished from the rest of the\r\nglobe. It is an island-land, the civilized land, the land of the\r\nTritons or water-deities, of Proteus, Ægeon, Doris, and Atlas. It is,\r\nin my view, Atlantis.\r\n\r\nOvid says, (book ii, fable 1, \"The Metamorphoses\")\r\n\r\n\"_The sea circling around the encompassed earth_. . . . The earth has\r\nupon it men and cities, and woods and wild beasts, and rivers, and\r\nnymphs and other deities of the\r\n\r\n{p. 369}\r\n\r\ncountry.\" On this land is \"the palace of the sun, raised high on\r\nstately columns, bright with radiant gold, and carbuncle that rivals\r\nthe flames; polished ivory crests its highest top, and double folding\r\ndoors shine with the brightness of silver.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, the legend refers to the island-home of a civilized\r\nrace, over which was a palace which reminds one of the great temple\r\nof Poseidon in Plato's story.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic was sometimes called \"the sea of ivory,\" in allusion,\r\nprobably, to this ivory-covered temple of Ovid. Hence Croly sang:\r\n\r\n     Now on her hills of ivory\r\n         Lie giant-weed and ocean-slime,\r\n     Hiding from man and angel's eye\r\n         The land of crime.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, again, Ovid says, after enumerating the different rivers and\r\nmountains and tracts of country that were on fire in the great\r\nconflagration, and once more distinguishing the pre-eminent earth\r\nfrom the rest of the world:\r\n\r\n\"However, the genial Earth, _as she was surrounded with sea_, amid\r\nthe waters of the _main_,\" (the ocean,) \"and the springs dried up on\r\nevery side, lifted up her _all-productive face_,\" etc.\r\n\r\nShe cries out to the sovereign of the gods for mercy. She refers to\r\nthe burdens of the crops she annually bears; the wounds of the\r\ncrooked plow and the barrow, which she voluntarily endures; and she\r\ncalls on mighty Jove to put an end to the conflagration. And he does\r\nso. The rest of the world has been scarred and seared with the fire,\r\nbut he spares and saves this island-land, this agricultural,\r\ncivilized land, this land of the Tritons and Atlas; this \"island of\r\nthe innocent\" of Job. And when the terrible convulsion was over, and\r\nthe\r\n\r\n{p. 370}\r\n\r\nrash Phaëton dead and buried, Jove repairs, with especial care, \"his\r\nown Arcadia.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that Phaëton was the son of _Merops_; and\r\nTheopompus tells us that the people who inhabited Atlantis were the\r\n_Meropes_, the people of Merou. And the Greek traditions[1] show that\r\nthe human race issued from _Upa-Merou_; and the Egyptians claim that\r\ntheir ancestors came from the _Island of Mero_; and among the Hindoos\r\nthe land of the gods and the godlike men was _Meru_.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is, we are told, where in deep caves, and from the seas,\r\nreceding under the great heat, the human race, crying out for mercy,\r\nwith uplifted and blistered hands, survived the cataclysm.\r\n\r\nAnd Ovid informs us that this land, \"with a mighty trembling, sank\r\ndown a little\" in the ocean, and the Gothic and Briton (Druid)\r\nlegends tell us of a prolongation of Western Europe which went down\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nIn the Hindoo legends the great battle between Rama and Ravana, the\r\nsun and the comet, takes place _on an island_, the Island of Lanka,\r\nand Rama builds a stone bridge sixty miles long to reach the island.\r\n\r\nIn the Norse legends Asgard lies to the west of Europe; communication\r\nis maintained with it by the bridge Bifrost. Gylfe goes to visit\r\nAsgard, as Herodotus and Solon went to visit Egypt: the outside\r\nbarbarian was curious to behold the great civilized land. There he\r\nasks many questions, as Herodotus and Solon did. He is told:[2]\r\n\r\n\"The earth is round, and _without it round about lies the deep\r\nocean_.\"\r\n\r\n[1. \"Atlantis,\" p. 171.\r\n\r\n2. The Fooling of Gylfe--The Creation of the World--The Younger Edda.]\r\n\r\n{p. 371}\r\n\r\nThe earth is Ovid's earth; it is Asgard. It is an island, surrounded\r\nby the ocean:\r\n\r\n\"And along the outer strand of that sea they gave lands for the\r\ngiant-races to dwell in; and against the attack of restless giants\r\nthey built a burg within the sea and around the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThis proves that by \"the earth\" was not meant the whole globe; for\r\nhere we see that around the outside margin of that ocean which\r\nencircled Asgard, the mother-country had given lands for colonies of\r\nthe giant-races, the white, large, blue-eyed races of Northern and\r\nWestern Europe, who were as \"restless\" and as troublesome then to\r\ntheir neighbors as they are now and will be to the end of time.\r\n\r\nAnd as the _Elder_ and _Younger Edda_ claim that the Northmen were\r\nthe giant races, and that their kings were of the blood of these\r\nAsas; and as the bronze-using people advanced, (it has been proved by\r\ntheir remains,[1]) into Scandinavia from the _southwest_, it is clear\r\nthat these legends do not refer to some mythical island in the Indian\r\nSeas, or to the Pacific Ocean, but to the Atlantic: the west coasts\r\nof Europe were \"the outer strand\" where these white colonies were\r\nestablished; the island was in the Atlantic; and, as there is no body\r\nof submerged land in that ocean with roots or ridges reaching out to\r\nthe continents east and west, except the mass of which the Azores\r\nIslands constitute the mountain-tops, the conclusion is irresistible\r\nthat here was Atlantis; here was Lanka; here was \"the island of the\r\ninnocent,\" here was Asgard.\r\n\r\nAnd the Norse legends describe this \"Asgard\" as a land of temples and\r\nplowed fields, and a mighty civilized race.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is that Ragnarok comes. It is from the\r\n\r\n[1. Du Chaillu's \"Land of the Midnight Sun,\" vol. i, pp. 343, 345,\r\netc.]\r\n\r\n{P. 372}\r\n\r\npeople of Asgard that the wandering Gylfe learns all that he tells\r\nabout Ragnarok, just as Solon learned from the priests of Sais the\r\nstory of Atlantis. And it is here in Asgard that, as we have seen,\r\n\"during Surt's fire two persons, called Lif and Lifthraser, a man and\r\na woman, concealed themselves in Hodmimer's holt,\" and afterward\r\nrepeopled the world.\r\n\r\nWe leave Europe and turn to India.\r\n\r\nIn the Bagaveda-Gita Krishna recalls to the memory of his disciple\r\nArdjouna the legend as preserved in the sacred books of the Veda.\r\n\r\nWe are told:\r\n\r\n\"The earth was covered with flowers; the trees bent under their\r\nfruit; thousands of animals sported over the plains and in the air;\r\nwhite elephants roved unmolested under the shade of gigantic forests,\r\nand Brahma perceived that the time had come for the creation of man\r\nto inhabit this dwelling-place.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThis is a description of the glorious world of the Tertiary Age,\r\nduring which, as scientific researches have proved, the climate of\r\nthe tropics extended to the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nBrahma makes man, Adima, (Adam,) and he makes a companion for him,\r\nHéva, (Eve).\r\n\r\n_They are upon an island_. Tradition localizes the legend by making\r\nthis the Island of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\"Adima and Héva lived for some time in perfect happiness--no\r\nsuffering came to disturb their quietude; they had but to stretch\r\nforth their hands and pluck from surrounding trees the most delicious\r\nfruits--but to stoop and gather rice of the finest quality.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the same Golden Age represented in Genesis, when Adam and\r\nEve, naked, but supremely happy, lived\r\n\r\n[1. Jacolliet, \"The Bible in India,\" p. 195.]\r\n\r\n{p. 373}\r\n\r\nupon the fruits of the garden, and knew neither sorrow nor suffering,\r\nneither toil nor hunger.\r\n\r\nBut one day the evil-one came, as in the Bible legend the Prince of\r\nthe _Rakchasos_ (Raknaros--Ragnarok?) came, and broke up this\r\nparadise. Adima and Héva leave their _island_; they pass to a\r\nboundless country; they fall upon an evil time; \"trees, flowers,\r\nfruits, birds, vanish in an instant, amid terrific clamor\";[1] the\r\nDrift has come; they are in a world of trouble, sorrow, poverty, and\r\ntoil.\r\n\r\nAnd when we turn to America we find the legends looking, not\r\nwestward, but _eastward_, to this same island-refuge of the race.\r\n\r\nWhen the Navajos come out of the cave the white race goes _east_, and\r\nthe red-men go _west_; so that the Navajos inhabit a country _west_\r\nof their original habitat, just as the Jews inhabit one _east_ of it.\r\n\r\n\"Let me conclude,\" says the legend, \"by telling how the Navajos came\r\nby the seed they now cultivate. All the wise men being one day\r\nassembled, a Turkey-Hen came flying _from the direction of the\r\nmorning star_, and shook from her feathers an ear of blue corn into\r\nthe midst of the company; and in subsequent visits _brought all the\r\nother seeds they possess_.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIn the Peruvian legends the civilizers of the race came _from the\r\neast_, after the cave-life.\r\n\r\nSo that these people not only came from the east, but they maintained\r\nintercourse for some time afterward with the parent-land.\r\n\r\nOn page 174, _ante_, we learn that the Iroquois believed that when\r\nJoskeha renewed the world, after the great battle with Darkness, he\r\nlearned from _the great tortoise_\r\n\r\n[1. Jacolliet, \"The Bible in India,\" p. 198.\r\n\r\n2. Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 83.]\r\n\r\n{p. 374}\r\n\r\n--always the image of an island--how to make fire, and taught the\r\nIndians the art. And in their legends the battle between the White\r\nOne and the Dark One took place in the east near the great ocean.\r\n\r\nDr. Brinton says, speaking of the Great Hare, Manibozho:\r\n\r\n\"In the oldest accounts of the missionaries he was alleged to reside\r\n_toward the east_, and in the holy formula of the meda craft, when\r\nthe winds are invoked to the medicine-lodge, the _east is summoned_\r\nin his name, the door opens in that direction, and there _at the edge\r\nof the earth_, where the sun rises, on _the shore of the infinite\r\nocean that surrounds the land_, he has his house, and sends the\r\nluminaries forth on their daily journey.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThat is to say, in the east, in the _surrounding_ ocean of the east,\r\nto wit, in the Atlantic, this god, (or godlike race,) has his house,\r\nhis habitation, upon a land surrounded by the ocean, to wit, an\r\nisland; and there his power and his civilization are so great that he\r\ncontrols the movements of the sun, moon, and stars; that is to say,\r\nhe fixes the measure of time by the movements of the sun and moon,\r\nand he has mapped out the heavenly bodies into constellations.\r\n\r\nIn the Miztec legend, (see page 214, _ante_,) we find the people\r\npraying to God to gather the waters together and enlarge the land,\r\nfor they have only \"a little garden\" to inhabit in the waste of\r\nwaters. This meant an island.\r\n\r\nIn the Arabian legends we have the scene of the catastrophe described\r\nas an island west of Arabia, and it _requires two years and a half of\r\ntravel to reach it_. It is the land of bronze.\r\n\r\nIn the Hindoo legend of the battle between Rama, the\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 177.]\r\n\r\n{p. 375}\r\n\r\nsun, and Ravana, the comet, the scene is laid on the _Island_ of\r\nLanka.\r\n\r\nIn the Tahoe legend the survivors of the civilized race take refuge\r\nin a cave, in a mountain on an _island_. They give the tradition a\r\nlocal habitation in Lake Tahoe.\r\n\r\nThe Tacullies say God first created an _island_.\r\n\r\nIn short, we may say that, wherever any of these legends refer to the\r\nlocality where the disaster came and where man survived, the scene is\r\nplaced upon an island, in the ocean, in the midst of the waters; and\r\nthis island, wherever the points of the compass are indicated, lies\r\nto the west of Europe and to the east of America: it is, therefore,\r\nin the Atlantic Ocean; and the island, we shall see, is connected\r\nwith these continents by long bridges or ridges of land.\r\n\r\nThis island was Atlantis. Ovid says it was the land of Neptune,\r\nPoseidon. It is Neptune who cries out for mercy. And it is associated\r\nwith Atlas, the king or god of Atlantis.\r\n\r\nLet us go a step further in the argument.\r\n\r\n{p. 376}\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                              THE BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nTHE deep-sea soundings, made of late years in the Atlantic, reveal\r\nthe fact that the Azores are the mountaintops of a colossal mass of\r\nsunken land; and that from this center one great ridge runs southward\r\nfor some distance, and then, bifurcating, sends out one limb to the\r\nshores of Africa, and another to the shores of South America; while\r\nthere are the evidences that a third great ridge formerly reached\r\nnorthward from the Azores to the British Islands.\r\n\r\nWhen these ridges--really the tops of long and continuous\r\nmountain-chains, like the Andes or the Rocky Mountains, the backbone\r\nof a vast primeval Atlantic-filling, but, even then, in great part,\r\nsunken continent, were above the water, they furnished a wonderful\r\nfeature in the scenery and geography of the world; they were the\r\npathways over which the migrations of races extended in the ancient\r\ndays; they wound for thousands of miles, irregular, rocky,\r\nwave-washed, through the great ocean, here expanding into islands,\r\nthere reduced to a narrow strip, or sinking into the sea; they\r\nreached from a central civilized land--an ancient, long-settled land,\r\nthe land of the godlike race--to its colonies, or connections, north,\r\nsouth, east, and west; and they impressed themselves vividly on the\r\nimagination and the traditions of mankind, leaving their image even\r\nin the religions of the world unto this day.\r\n\r\nAs, in process of time, they gradually or suddenly settled\r\n\r\n{p. 377}\r\n\r\ninto the deep, they must at first have formed long, continuous\r\nstrings of islands, almost touching each other, resembling very much\r\nthe Aleutian Archipelago, or the Bahama group; and these islands\r\ncontinued to be used, during later ages, as the stepping-stones for\r\nmigrations and intercourse between the old and the new worlds, just\r\nas the discovery of the Azores helped forward the discovery of the\r\nNew World by Columbus; he used them, we know, as a halting-place in\r\nhis great voyage.\r\n\r\nWhen Job speaks of \"the island of the innocent,\" which was spared\r\nfrom utter destruction, he prefaces it by asking, (chap. xxii):\r\n\r\n\"15. Hast thou marked _the old way_ which wicked men have trodden?\r\n\r\n\"16. Which were (was?) cut down out of time, _whose foundation was\r\noverflown with a flood_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in chapter xxviii, verse 4, we have what may be another allusion\r\nto this \"way,\" along which go the people who are on their journey,\r\nand which \"divideth the flood,\" and on which some are escaping.\r\n\r\nThe Quiche manuscript, as translated by the Abbé Brasseur de\r\nBourbourg,[1] gives an account of the migration of the Quiche race to\r\nAmerica from some eastern land in a very early day, in \"the day of\r\ndarkness,\" ere the sun was, in the so-called glacial age.\r\n\r\nWhen they moved to America they wandered for a long time through\r\nforests and over mountains, and \"they had a _long passage to make,\r\nthrough the sea, along the shingle and pebbles and drifted sand_.\"\r\nAnd this long passage was through the sea \"which was parted for their\r\npassage.\" That is, the sea was on both sides of this long ridge of\r\nrocks and sand.\r\n\r\n[1. Tylor's \"Early Mankind,\" p. 308.]\r\n\r\n{p. 378}\r\n\r\nThe abbé adds:\r\n\r\n\"But it is not clear how they crossed the sea; they passed as though\r\nthere had been no sea, for they passed over scattered rocks, and\r\nthese rocks were rolled on the sands. This is why they called the\r\nplace 'ranged stones and torn-up sands,' the name which they gave it\r\nin their passage within the sea, the water being divided when they\r\npassed.\"\r\n\r\nThey probably migrated along that one of the connecting ridges which,\r\nthe sea-soundings show us, stretched from Atlantis to the coast of\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the Hindoo legends that when Rama went to the Island\r\nof Lanka to fight the demon Ravana, he built a bridge of stone, sixty\r\nmiles long, with the help of the monkey-god, in order to reach the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIn Ovid we read of the \"settling down a little\" of the island on\r\nwhich the drama of Phaëton was enacted.\r\n\r\nIn the Norse legends the bridge Bifrost cuts an important figure. One\r\nwould be at first disposed to regard it as meaning, (as is stated in\r\nwhat are probably later interpolations,) the rainbow; but we see,\r\nupon looking closely, that it represents a material fact, an actual\r\nstructure of some kind.\r\n\r\nGylfe, who was, we are told, A king of Sweden in the ancient days,\r\nvisited Asgard. He assumed the name of Ganglere, (the walker or\r\nwanderer). I quote from the \"_Younger Edda, The Creation_\":\r\n\r\n\"Then asked Ganglere, 'What is the path from earth to heaven?'\"\r\n\r\nThe earth here means, I take it, the European colonies which surround\r\nthe ocean, which in turn surrounds Asgard; heaven is the land of the\r\ngodlike race, Asgard. Ganglere therefore asks what is, or was, in the\r\nmythological past, the pathway from Europe to the Atlantic island.\r\n\r\n{p. 379}\r\n\r\n\"Har answered, laughing, 'Foolishly do you now ask. Have you not been\r\ntold that the gods made a bridge from earth to heaven, which is\r\ncalled Bifrost? You must have seen it. It may be that you call it the\r\nrainbow. It has three colors, is very strong, and is made with more\r\ncraft and skill than other structures. Still, however strong it is,\r\nit will break when the sons of Muspel come to ride over it, and then\r\nthey will have to swim their horses over great rivers in order to get\r\non.'\"\r\n\r\nMuspel is the blazing South, the land of fire, of the convulsions\r\nthat accompanied the comet. But how can Bifrost mean the rainbow?\r\nWhat rivers intersect a rainbow?\r\n\r\n\"Then said Ganglere, 'The gods did not, it seems to me, build that\r\nbridge honestly, if it shall be able to break to pieces, since they\r\ncould have done so if they had desired.' Then made answer Har: 'The\r\ngods are worthy of no blame for this structure. Bifrost is indeed a\r\ngood bridge, but there is nothing in the world that is able to stand\r\nwhen the sons of Muspel come to the fight.'\"\r\n\r\nMuspel here means, I repeat, the heat of the South. Mere heat has no\r\neffect on rainbows. They are the product of sunlight and falling\r\nwater, and are often most distinct in the warmest weather.\r\n\r\nBut we see, a little further on, that this bridge Bifrost was a real\r\nstructure. We read of the roots of the ash-tree Ygdrasil, and one of\r\nits roots reaches to the fountain of Urd:\r\n\r\nHere the gods have their doomstead. The _Asas ride hither every day\r\nover Bifrost_, which is also called Asa-bridge.\"\r\n\r\nAnd these three mountain-chains going out to the different continents\r\nwere the three roots of the tree Ygdrasil, the sacred tree of the\r\nmountain-top; and it is to this \"three-pronged root of the\r\nworld-mountain\" that the\r\n\r\n{p. 380}\r\n\r\nHindoo legends refer, (see page 238, _ante_): on its top was heaven,\r\nOlympus; below it was hell, where the Asuras, the comets, dwelt; and\r\nbetween was Meru, (Mero Merou,) the land of the Meropes, Atlantis.\r\n\r\nThe _Asas_ were clearly a human race of noble and godlike qualities.\r\nThe proof of this is that they perished in Ragnarok; they were\r\nmortal. They rode over the bridge every day going from heaven, the\r\nheavenly land, to the earth, Europe.\r\n\r\nWe read on:\r\n\r\n     \"Kormt and Ormt,\r\n     And the two Kerlaugs\r\n     These shall Thor wade\r\n     Every day,\r\n     When he goes to judge\r\n     Near the Ygdrasil ash;\r\n     _For the Asa-bridge\r\n     Burns all ablaze--_\r\n     The holy waters roar.\"\r\n\r\nThese rivers, Kormt and Ormt and the two Kerlaugs, were probably\r\nbreaks in the long ridge, where it had gradually subsided into the\r\nsea. The Asa-bridge was, very likely, dotted with volcanoes, as the\r\nislands of the Atlantic are to this day.\r\n\r\n\"Then answered Ganglere, 'Does fire burn over Bifrost?' Har answered:\r\n'The red which you see in the rainbow is burning fire. The\r\nfrost-giants and the mountain-giants would go up to heaven if Bifrost\r\nwere passable for all who desired to go there. Many fair places are\r\nthere in heaven, and they are protected by a divine defense.'\"\r\n\r\nWe have just seen (p. 371, _ante_) that the home of the godlike race,\r\nthe _Asas_, to wit, heaven, Asgard, was surrounded by the ocean, was\r\ntherefore an island; and that around the outer margin of this ocean,\r\nthe Atlantic,\r\n\r\n[1. Elder Edda, \"Grimner's Lay,\" 29.]\r\n\r\n{p. 381}\r\n\r\nthe godlike race had given lands for the ice-giants to dwell in. And\r\nnow we read that this Asa-bridge, this Bifrost, reached from earth to\r\nheaven, to wit, across this gulf that separated the island from the\r\ncolonies of the ice-giants. And now we learn that, if this bridge\r\nwere not defended by a divine defense, these troublesome ice-giants\r\nwould go up to heaven; that is to say, the bold Northmen would march\r\nacross it from Great Britain and Ireland to the Azores, to wit, to\r\nAtlantis. Surely all this could not apply to the rainbow.\r\n\r\nBut we read a little further. Har is reciting to Ganglere the wonders\r\nof the heavenly land, and is describing its golden palaces, and its\r\nmixed population of dark and light colored races, and he says:\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, there is a dwelling, by name Himinbjorg, _which stands\r\nat the end of heaven, where the Bifrost bridge is united with\r\nheaven_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then we read of Heimdal, one of the gods who was subsequently\r\nkilled by the comet:\r\n\r\n\"He dwells in a place called Himinbjorg, near Bifrost. He is the\r\nward,\" (warder, guardian,) \"of the gods, and sits _at the end of\r\nheaven, guarding the bridge against the mountain-giants_. He needs\r\nless sleep than a bird; sees an hundred miles around him, and as well\r\nby night as by day. _His teeth are of gold_.\"\r\n\r\nThis reads something like a barbarian's recollection of a race that\r\npracticed dentistry and used telescopes. We know that gold filling\r\nhas been found in the teeth of ancient Egyptians and Peruvians, and\r\nthat telescopic lenses were found in the ruins of Babylon.\r\n\r\nBut here we have Bifrost, a bridge, but not a continuous structure,\r\ninterrupted in places by water, reaching from Europe to some Atlantic\r\nisland. And the island-people regarded it very much as some of the\r\nEnglish look\r\n\r\n{p. 382}\r\n\r\nupon the proposition to dig a tunnel from Dover to Calais, as a\r\nsource of danger, a means of invasion, a threat; and at the end of\r\nthe island, where the ridge is united to it, they did what England\r\nwill probably do at the end of the Dover tunnel: they erected\r\nfortifications and built a castle, and in it they put a ruler,\r\npossibly a sub-king, Heimdal, who constantly, from a high lookout,\r\npossibly with a field-glass, watches the coming of the turbulent\r\nGoths, or Gauls, or Gael, from afar off. Doubtless the white-headed\r\nand red-headed, hungry, breekless savages had the same propensity to\r\ninvade the civilized, wealthy land, that their posterity had to\r\ndescend on degenerate Rome.\r\n\r\nThe word _Asas_ is not, as some have supposed, derived from Asia.\r\nAsia is derived from the _Asas_. The word _Asas_ comes from a Norse\r\nword, still in use in Norway, _Aas_, meaning _a ridge of high\r\nland_.[1] Anderson thinks there is some connection between _Aas_, the\r\nhigh ridge, the mountain elevation, and _Atlas_, who held the world\r\non his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe _Asas_, then, were the civilized race who inhabited a high,\r\nprecipitous country, the meeting-point of a number of ridges. Atlas\r\nwas the king, or god, of Atlantis. In the old time all kings were\r\ngods. They are something more than men, to the multitude, even yet.\r\n\r\nAnd when we reach \"Ragnarok\" in these Gothic legends, when the jaw of\r\nthe wolf Fenris reached from the earth to the sun, and he vomits fire\r\nand poison, and when Surt, and all the forces of Muspel, \"ride over\r\nBifrost, _it breaks to pieces_.\" That is to say, in this last great\r\ncatastrophe of the earth, the ridge of land that led from the British\r\nIslands to Atlantis goes down for ever.\r\n\r\n[1. The Younger Edda,\" Anderson, note, p. 226.]\r\n\r\n{p. 383}\r\n\r\nAnd in Plato's description of Atlantis, as received by Solon from the\r\nEgyptian priests, we read:\r\n\r\n\"There was an island\" (Atlantis) \"situated in front of the straits\r\nwhich you call the Columns of Hercules; the island was larger than\r\nLibya and Asia put together, and _was the way to other islands_, and\r\nfrom the islands _you might pass through the whole of the opposite\r\ncontinent_,\" (America,) \"which surrounds the true ocean.\"\r\n\r\nNow this is not very clear, but it may signify that there was\r\ncontinuous land communication between Atlantis and the islands of the\r\nhalf-submerged ridge, and from the islands to the continent of\r\nAmerica. It would seem to mean more than a passage-way by boats over\r\nthe water, for that existed everywhere, and could be traversed in any\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nI have quoted on p. 372, _ante_, in the last chapter, part of the\r\nSanskrit legend of Adima and Héva, as preserved in the Bagaveda-Gita,\r\nand other sacred books of the Hindoos. It refers very distinctly to\r\nthe bridge which united the island-home of primeval humanity with the\r\nrest of the earth. But there is more of it:\r\n\r\nWhen, under the inspiration of the prince of demons, Adima and Héva\r\nbegin to wander, and desire to leave their island, we read:\r\n\r\n\"Arriving at last at the extremity of the island\"--\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the bridge Bifrost was connected with the extremity\r\nof Asgard--\r\n\r\n\"they beheld a smooth and narrow arm of the sea, and beyond it a vast\r\nand apparently boundless country,\" (Europe?) \"_connected with their\r\nisland by a narrow and rocky pathway, arising from the bosom of the\r\nwaters_.\"\r\n\r\nThis is probably a precise description of the connecting ridge; it\r\nunited the boundless continent, Europe, with\r\n\r\n{p. 384}\r\n\r\nthe island; it rose out of the sea, it was rocky; it was the broken\r\ncrest of a submerged mountain-chain.\r\n\r\nWhat became of it? Here again we have a tradition of its destruction.\r\nWe read that, after Adima and Héva had passed over this rocky bridge--\r\n\r\n\"No sooner did they touch the shore, than trees, flowers, fruit,\r\nbirds, all that they had seen from the opposite side, vanished in an\r\ninstant, _amidst terrible clamor; the rocks by which they had crossed\r\nsank beneath the waves_, a few sharp peaks alone remaining above the\r\nsurface, to indicate the place of the bridge, _which had been\r\ndestroyed by divine displeasure_.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the crushing and instant destruction by the Drift, the\r\nterrific clamor of the age of chaos, and the breaking down of the\r\nbridge Bifrost under the feet of the advancing armies of Muspel; here\r\nwe have \"the earth\" of Ovid \"settling down a little\" in the ocean;\r\nhere we have the legends of the Cornishmen of the lost land,\r\ndescribed in the poetry of Tennyson; here we have the emigrants to\r\nEurope cut off from their primeval home, and left in a land of stones\r\nand clay and thistles.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, localized in Ceylon, precisely as the mountain of\r\nArarat and the mountain of Olympus crop out in a score of places,\r\nwherever the races carried their legends. And to this day the Hindoo\r\npoints to the rocks which rise in the Indian Ocean, between the\r\neastern point of India and the Island of Ceylon, as the remnants of\r\nthe Bridge; and the reader will find them marked on our maps as\"\r\nAdam's Bridge\" (_Palam Adima_). The people even point out, to this\r\nday, a high mountain, from whose foot the Bridge went forth, over\r\nwhich Adima and Héva, crossed to the continent; and it is known in\r\nmodern geography as \"Adam's Peak.\" So vividly have the traditions of\r\na vast antiquity come down to us! The legends\r\n\r\n{p. 385}\r\n\r\nof the Drift have left their stamp even in our schoolbooks.\r\n\r\nAnd the memory of this Bridge survives not only in our geographies,\r\nbut in our religions.\r\n\r\nMan reasons, at first, from below upward; from godlike men up to\r\nman-like gods; from Cæsar, the soldier, up to Cæsar, the deity.\r\n\r\nHeaven was, in the beginning, a heavenly city on earth; it is\r\ntransported to the clouds; and there its golden streets and sparkling\r\npalaces await the redeemed.\r\n\r\nThis is natural: we can only conceive of the best of the spiritual by\r\nthe best we know of the material; we can imagine no musical\r\ninstrument in the bands of the angels superior to a harp; no weapon\r\nbetter than a sword for the grasp of Gabriel.\r\n\r\nThis disproves not a spiritual and superior state; it simply shows\r\nthe poverty and paucity of our poor intellectual apparatus, which,\r\nlike a mirror, reflects only that which is around it, and reflects it\r\nimperfectly.\r\n\r\nMen sometimes think they are mocking spiritual things when it is the\r\nimperfection of material nature, (which they set so much store by,)\r\nthat provokes their ridicule.\r\n\r\nSo, among all the races which went out from this heavenly land, this\r\nland of high intelligence, this land of the master race, it was\r\nremembered down through the ages, and dwelt upon and sung of until it\r\nmoved upward from the waters of the Atlantic to the distant skies,\r\nand became a spiritual heaven. And the ridges which so strangely\r\nconnected it with the continents, east and west, became the bridges\r\nover which the souls of men must pass to go from earth to heaven.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\nThe Persians believe in this bridge between earth and\r\n\r\n{p. 386}\r\n\r\nparadise. In his prayers the penitent in his confession says to this\r\nday:\r\n\r\n\"I am wholly without doubt in the existence of the Mazdayaçnian\r\nfaith; in the coming of the resurrection of the latter body; in the\r\nstepping _over the bridge Chinvat_; as well as in the continuance of\r\nparadise.\"\r\n\r\nThe bridge and the land are both indestructible.\r\n\r\nOver the midst of the Moslem hell stretches the bridge Es-Sirat,\r\n\"finer than a hair and sharper than the edge of a sword.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Lyke-Wake Dirge of the English north-country, they sang of\r\n\r\n     The Brig of Dread\r\n     Na braider than a thread.\"\r\n\r\nIn Borneo the passage for souls to heaven is across a long tree; it\r\nis scarcely practicable to any except those who have killed a man.\r\n\r\nIn Burmah, among the Karens, they tie strings across the rivers, for\r\nthe ghosts of the dead to pass over to their graves.\r\n\r\nIn Java, a bridge leads across the abyss to the dwelling-place of the\r\ngods; the evil-doers fall into the depths _below_.\r\n\r\nAmong the Esquimaux the soul crosses an awful gulf over a stretched\r\nrope, until it reaches the abode of \"the great female evil spirit\r\nbelow\" (beyond?) \"the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ojibways cross to paradise on a great snake, which serves as a\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nThe Choctaw bridge is a slippery pine-log.\r\n\r\nThe South American Manacicas cross on a wooden bridge.\r\n\r\nAmong many of the American tribes, the Milky Way is the bridge to the\r\nother world.\r\n\r\n[1. Poor, \"Sanskrit Literature,\" p. 151.]\r\n\r\n{p. 387}\r\n\r\nThe Polynesians have no bridge; they pass the chasm in canoes.\r\n\r\nThe Vedic Yama of the Hindoos crossed the rapid waters, and showed\r\nthe way to our Aryan fathers.\r\n\r\nThe modern Hindoo hopes to get through by holding on to the cow's\r\ntail!\r\n\r\nEven the African tribes, the Guinea negroes, believe that the land of\r\nsouls can only be reached by crossing a river.\r\n\r\nAmong some of the North American tribes \"the souls come to a great\r\nlake,\" (the ocean,) \"where there is a _beautiful island_, toward\r\nwhich they have to paddle in a canoe of white stone. On the way there\r\narises a storm, and the wicked souls are wrecked, and the heaps of\r\ntheir bones are to be seen under the water, but the good reach the\r\nhappy _island_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe Slavs believed in a pathway or road which led to the other world;\r\nit was both the rainbow (as in the Gothic legends) and the Milky Way;\r\nand, since the journey was long, they put boots into the coffin, (for\r\nit was made on foot,) and coins to pay the ferrying across a wide\r\nsea, even as the Greeks expected to be carried over the Styx by\r\nCharon. This abode of the dead, at the end of this long pathway, was\r\n_an island_, a warm, fertile land, called _Buyau_.[2]\r\n\r\nIn their effort to restore the dead men to the happy island-home, the\r\nheavenly land, beyond the water, the Norsemen actually set their dead\r\nheroes afloat in boats on the open ocean.[3]\r\n\r\nSubsequently they raised a great mound over boat, warrior, horses,\r\nweapons, and all. These boats are now being dug up in the north of\r\nEurope and placed in the\r\n\r\n[1. Tylor's \"Early Mankind,\" p. 362.\r\n\r\n2. Poor, \"Sanskrit and Kindred Literatures,\" pp. 3 71, 372.\r\n\r\n3. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n{p. 388}\r\n\r\ngreat museums. They tell a marvelous religious and historical story.\r\n\r\nI think the unprejudiced reader will agree with me that these legends\r\nshow that some Atlantic island played an important part in the very\r\nbeginning of human history. It was the great land of the world before\r\nthe Drift; it continued to be the great land of the world between the\r\nDrift and the Deluge. Here man fell; here he survived; here he\r\nrenewed the race, and from this center he repopulated the world.\r\n\r\nWe see also that this island was connected with the continents east\r\nand west by great ridges of land.\r\n\r\nThe deep-sea soundings show that the vast bulk of land, of which the\r\nAzores are the outcroppings, are so connected yet with such ridges,\r\nalthough their crests are below the sea-level; and we know of no\r\nother island-mass of the Atlantic that is so united with the\r\ncontinents on both sides of it.\r\n\r\nIs not the conclusion very strong that Atlantis was the island-home\r\nof the race, in whose cave Job dwelt; on whose shores Phaëton fell;\r\non whose fields Adam lived; on whose plain Sodom and Gomorrah stood,\r\nand Odin and Thor and Citli died; from which the Quiches and the\r\nAztecs wandered to America; the center of all the races; the root of\r\nall the mythologies?\r\n\r\n{p. 389}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                        OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nLET ME consider, briefly, those objections to my theory which have\r\nprobably presented themsevles {_sic_} to some of my readers.\r\n\r\nFirst, it may be said:\r\n\r\n\"We don't understand you. You argue that there could not have been\r\nsuch an ice-age as the glacialists affirm, and yet you speak of a\r\nperiod of cold and ice and snow.\"\r\n\r\nTrue: 'but there is a great difference between such a climate as that\r\nof Scotland, damp and cold, snowy and blowy, and a continental\r\nice-sheet, a mile or two thick, reaching from John o' Groat's House\r\nto the Mediterranean. We can see that the oranges of Spain can grow\r\nto-day within a comparatively short distance of Edinburgh; but we can\r\nnot realize that any tropical or semitropical plant could have\r\nsurvived in Africa when a precipice of ice, five thousand feet high,\r\nfrowned on the coast of Italy; or that any form of life could have\r\nsurvived on earth when the equator in South America was covered with\r\na continental ice-sheet a mile in thickness, or even ten feet in\r\nthickness. We can conceive of a glacial age of snow-storms, rains,\r\nhail, and wind--a terribly trying and disagreeable climate for man\r\nand beast--but we can not believe that the whole world was once in\r\nthe condition that the dead waste of ice-covered Greenland is in now.\r\n\r\n{p. 390}\r\n\r\nSecondly, it may be said--\r\n\r\n\"The whole world is now agreed that ice produced the Drift; what\r\nright, then, has any one man to set up a different theory against the\r\nopinions of mankind? \"\r\n\r\nOne man, Mohammed said, with God on his side, is a majority; and one\r\nman, with the truth on his side, must become a majority.\r\n\r\nAll recognized truths once rested, solitary and alone, in some one\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nTruth is born an acorn, not an oak.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Sydney Smith once said that there was a kind of men into\r\nwhom you could not introduce a new idea without a surgical operation.\r\nHe might have added that, when you had once forced an idea into the\r\nhead of such a man, you could not deliver him of it without\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThe conservatism of unthinkingness is one of the potential forces of\r\nthe world. It lies athwart the progress of mankind like a colossal\r\nmountain-chain, chilling the atmosphere on both sides of it for a\r\nthousand miles. The Hannibal who would reach the eternal city of\r\nTruth on the other side of these Alps must fight his way over ice and\r\nhew his way through rocks.\r\n\r\nThe world was once agreed that the Drift was due to the Deluge. It\r\nabandoned this theory, and then became equally certain that it came\r\nfrom icebergs. This theory was, in turn, given up, and mankind were\r\nthen positive that glaciers caused the Drift. But the glaciers were\r\nfound to be inadequate for the emergency; and so the continents were\r\nlifted up fifteen hundred feet, and the ice-sheets were introduced.\r\nAnd now we wait to hear that the immense ice-masses of the Himalayas\r\nhave forsaken their elevations and are moving bodily over the plains\r\nof India, grinding up the rocks into clay and gravel\r\n\r\n{p. 391}\r\n\r\nas they go, before we accept a theory which declares that they once\r\nmarched over the land in this fashion from Hudson's Bay to Cape Horn,\r\nfrom Spitzbergen to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe universality of an error proves nothing, except that the error is\r\nuniversal. The voice of the people is only the voice of God in the\r\nlast analysis. We can safely appeal from Caiaphas and Pilate to Time.\r\n\r\nBut, says another:\r\n\r\n\"We find deep grooves or striations under the glaciers of to-day;\r\ntherefore the glaciers caused the grooves.\"\r\n\r\nBut we find striations on level plains far remote from mountains,\r\nwhere the glaciers could not have been; therefore the glaciers did\r\nnot cause the striations. \"A short horse is soon curried.\"\r\nSuperposition is not paternity. A porcelain nest-egg found under a\r\nhen is no proof that the hen laid it.\r\n\r\nBut, says another\r\n\r\n\"The idea of a comet encountering the earth, and covering it with\r\n_débris_, is so stupendous, so out of the usual course of nature, I\r\nrefuse to accept it.\"\r\n\r\nAh, my friend, you forget that those Drift deposits, hundreds of feet\r\nin thickness, are _there_. _They_ are out of the usual course of\r\nnature. It is admitted that they came suddenly from some source. If\r\nyou reject my theory, you do not get clear of the phenomena. The\r\nfacts are a good deal more stupendous than the theory. Go out and\r\nlook at the first Drift deposit; dig into it a hundred feet or more;\r\nfollow it for a few hundred miles or more; then come back, and\r\nscratch your head, and tell me where it came from! Calculate how many\r\ncart-loads there are of it, then multiply this by the area of your\r\nown continent, and multiply that again by the area of two or three\r\nmore continents, and then again tell me where it came from!\r\n\r\n{p. 392}\r\n\r\nSet aside my theory as absurd, and how much nearer are you to solving\r\nthe problem? If neither waves, nor icebergs, nor glaciers, nor\r\nice-sheets, nor comets, produced this world-cloak of _débris_, where\r\ndid it come from?\r\n\r\nRemember the essential, the incontrovertible elements of the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Great heat.\r\n\r\n2. A sudden catastrophe.\r\n\r\n3. Great evaporation of the seas and waters.\r\n\r\n4. Great clouds.\r\n\r\n5. An age of floods and snows and ice and torrents.\r\n\r\n6. The human legends.\r\n\r\nFind a theory that explains and embraces all these elements, and\r\nthen, and not until then, throw mine aside.\r\n\r\nAnother will say:\r\n\r\n\"But in one place you give us legends about an age of dreadful and\r\nlong-continued heat, as in the Arabian tale, where no rain is said to\r\nhave fallen for seven years; and in another place you tell us of a\r\nperiod of constant rains and snows and cold. Are not these statements\r\nincompatible?\"\r\n\r\nNot at all. This is a big globe we live on: the tropics are warmer\r\nthan the poles. Suppose a tremendous heat to be added to our natural\r\ntemperature; it would necessarily make it hotter on the equator than\r\nat the poles, although it would be warm everywhere. There can be no\r\nclouds without condensation, no condensation without some degree of\r\ncooling. Where would the air cool first? Naturally at the points most\r\nremote from the equator, the poles. Hence, while the sun was still\r\nblazing in the uncovered heavens of the greater part of the earth,\r\nsmall caps of cloud would form at the north and south poles, and shed\r\ntheir moisture in gentle rain. As the heat brought to the earth by\r\nthe comet was accidental and\r\n\r\n{p. 393}\r\n\r\nadventitious, there would be a natural tendency to return to the\r\npre-comet condition. The extraordinary evaporation would of itself\r\nhave produced refrigeration. Hence the cloud-caps would grow and\r\nadvance steadily toward the equator, casting down continually\r\nincreasing volumes of rain. Snow would begin to form near the poles,\r\nand it too would advance. We would finally have, down to say the\r\nthirty-fifth degree of north and south latitude, vast belts of rain\r\nand snow, while the equator would still be blazing with the tropical\r\nheat which would hold the condensation back. Here, then, we would\r\nhave precisely the condition of things described in the \"Younger\r\nEdda\" of the Northmen:\r\n\r\n\"Then said Jafnhar: 'All that part of Ginungagap' (the Atlantic)\r\n'that turns toward the north _was filled with thick, heavy ice and\r\nrime_,' (snow,) 'and everywhere within were _drizzling gusts and\r\nrain_. But the south part of Ginungagap was lighted up by the\r\n_glowing sparks_ that flew out of Muspelheim' (Africa?). Added\r\nThride: 'As cold and all things grim proceeded from Niflheim, so that\r\nwhich bordered on Muspelheim was hot and bright, and Ginungagap' (the\r\nAtlantic near Africa?) 'was as warm and mild as windless air.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother may say:\r\n\r\n\"But how does all this agree with your theory that the progenitors of\r\nthe stock from which the white, the yellow, and the brown races were\r\ndifferentiated, were saved in one or two caverns in one place? How\r\ndid they get to Africa, Asia, and America?\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is no essential part of my case that man\r\nsurvived in one place or a dozen places; it can not, in either event,\r\naffect the question of the origin of the Drift. It is simply an\r\nopinion of my own, open to modification upon fuller information. If,\r\nfor instance, men dwelt in Asia at that time, and no Drift deposits\r\n\r\n{p. 394}\r\n\r\nfell upon Asia, races may have survived there; the negro may have\r\ndwelt in India at that time; some of the strange Hill-tribes of China\r\nand India may have had no connection with Lif and Lifthraser.\r\n\r\nBut if we will suppose that the scene of man's survival was in that\r\nAtlantic island, Atlantis, then this would follow:\r\n\r\nThe remnant of mankind, whether they were a single couple, like Lif\r\nand Lifthraser; or a group of men and women, like Job and his\r\ncompanions; or a numerous party, like that referred to in the Navajo\r\nand Aztec legends, in any event, they would not and could not stay\r\nlong in the cave. The distribution of the Drift shows that it fell\r\nwithin twelve hours; but there were probably several days thereafter\r\nduring which the face of the earth was swept by horrible cyclones,\r\nborn of the dreadful heat. As soon, however, as they could safely do\r\nso, the remnant of the people must have left the cave; the limited\r\nnature of their food-supplies would probably drive them out. Once\r\noutside, their condition was pitiable indeed. First, they encountered\r\nthe great heat; the cooling of the atmosphere had not yet begun;\r\nwater was a pressing want. Hence we read in the legends of Mimer's\r\nwell, where Odin pawned his eye for a drink. And we are told, in an\r\nAmerican legend, of a party who traveled far to find the life-giving\r\nwell, and found the possessor sitting over it to hide it. It was\r\nduring this period that the legends originated which refer to the\r\ncapture of the cows and their recovery by demi-gods, Hercules or Rama.\r\n\r\nThen the race began to wander. The world was a place of stones.\r\nHunger drove them on. Then came the clouds, the rains, the floods,\r\nthe snows, the darkness; and still the people wandered. The receded\r\nocean laid bare the great ridges, if they had sunk in the catastrophe,\r\n\r\n{p. 395}\r\n\r\nand the race gradually spread to Europe, Africa, and America.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" says one, \"how long did all this take?\r\n\r\nWho shall say? It may have been days, weeks, months, years,\r\ncenturies. The Toltec legends say that their ancestors wandered for\r\nmore than a hundred years in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe torrent-torn face of the earth; the vast rearrangement of the\r\nDrift materials by rivers, compared with which our own rivers are\r\nrills; the vast continental regions which were evidently flooded, all\r\ntestify to an extraordinary amount of moisture first raised up from\r\nthe seas and then cast down on the lands. Given heat enough to raise\r\nthis mass, given the cold caused by its evaporation, given the time\r\nnecessary for the great battle between this heat and this\r\ncondensation, given the time to restore this body of water to the\r\nocean, not once but many times,--for, along the southern border of\r\nthe floods, where Muspelheim. and Niflheim met, the heat must have\r\nsucked up the water as fast almost as it fell, to fall again, and\r\nagain to be lifted up, until the heat-area was driven back and water\r\nfell, at last, everywhere on the earth's face, and the extraordinary\r\nevaporation ceased,--this was a gigantic, long-continued battle.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked:\r\n\r\n\"Suppose further study should disclose the fact that the Drift _is_\r\nfound in Siberia and the rest of Asia, and over all the world, what\r\nthen? \"\r\n\r\nIt will not disprove my theory. It will simply indicate that the\r\n_débris_ did not, as I have supposed, strike the earth\r\ninstantaneously, but that it continued to fall during twenty-four\r\nhours. If the comet was split into fragments, if there was the\r\n\"Midgard-Serpent\" as well as the\r\n\r\n{p. 396}\r\n\r\n\"Fenris Wolf\" and \"the dog Garm,\" they need not necessarily have\r\nreached the earth at the same time.\r\n\r\nAnother says:\r\n\r\n\"You supposed in your book, 'Atlantis,' that the Glacial Age might\r\nhave been caused by the ridges radiating from Atlantis shutting off\r\nthe Gulf Stream and preventing the heated waters of the tropics from\r\nreaching the northern shores of the world.\"\r\n\r\nTrue; and I have no doubt that these ridges did play an important\r\npart in producing climatic changes, subsequent to the Drift Age, by\r\ntheir presence or absence, their elevation or depression; but on\r\nfuller investigation I find that they are inadequate to account for\r\nthe colossal phenomena of the Drift itself--the presence of the clay\r\nand gravel, the great heat and the tremendous downfall of water.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked,\r\n\r\n\"How does your theory account for the removal of great blocks,\r\nweighing many tons, for hundreds of miles from their original site?\r\n\r\nThe answer is plain. We know the power of the ordinary hurricanes of\r\nthe earth. \"The largest trees are uprooted, or have their trunks\r\nsnapped in two; and few if any of the most massive buildings stand\r\nuninjured.\"[1] If we will remember the excessive heat and the\r\nelectrical derangements that must have accompanied the Drift Age, we\r\ncan realize the tremendous winds spoken of in many of the legends. We\r\nhave but to multiply the hurricane of the West Indies, or the cyclone\r\nof the Mississippi Valley, a hundred or a thousand fold, and we shall\r\nhave power enough to move all the blocks found scattered over the\r\nface of the Drift deposits or mixed with its material.\r\n\r\n[1. Appletons' \"American Cyclopædia,\" vol. ix, p. 80.]\r\n\r\n{p. 397}\r\n\r\nAnother asks:\r\n\r\n\"How do you account for the fact that this Drift material does not\r\nresemble the usual aërolites, which are commonly composed of iron,\r\nand unlike the stones of the earth?\"\r\n\r\nI nave shown that aërolites have fallen that did not contain any\r\niron, and that could not be distinguished from the material native to\r\nthe earth. And it must be remembered that, while the shining\r\nmeteoroids that blaze in periodical showers from radiant points in\r\nthe sky are associated with comets, and are probably lost fragments\r\nof comet-tails, these meteoroids do not reach the earth, but are\r\nalways burned out, far up in our atmosphere, by the friction produced\r\nby their motion. The iron aërolite is of different origin. It may be\r\na product of space itself, a condensation of metallic gases. The fact\r\nthat it reaches the earth without being consumed would seem to\r\nindicate that it belongs at a lower level than the meteoric showers,\r\nand has, consequently, a less distance to fall and waste.\r\n\r\nAnd these views are confirmed by a recent writer,[1] who, after\r\nshowing that the meteoroids, or shooting-stars, are very different\r\nfrom meteorites or aërolites, and seldom or never reach the earth,\r\nproceeds to account for the former. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Many theories have been advanced in the past to account for these\r\nstrange bodies, but the evidence now accumulated proves beyond\r\nreasonable doubt that they are near relatives, and probably the\r\n_débris_ of comets.\r\n\r\n\"Tempel's comet is now known to be traveling in the same orbit as the\r\nNovember meteors, and is near the head of the train, and it appears,\r\nin like manner, that the second comet of 1862 (Swift's comet) is\r\ntraveling in the orbit of the August meteors. And the first comet of\r\n1881 seems to be similarly connected with the April meteors. . . .\r\n\r\n[1. Ward's \"Science Bulletin,\" E. E. II., 1882, p. 4.]\r\n\r\n{p. 398}\r\n\r\n\"Although few scientific men now question a relationship between\r\ncomets and the ordinary meteors, there are those, and among them some\r\nof our ablest men, who think that the large meteors, or bolides, and\r\naërolites, may be different astronomically, and perhaps physically,\r\nfrom the ordinary shooting-stars, and in the past some contended that\r\nthey originated in our atmosphere others that they were ejected from\r\nterrestrial volcanoes. . . And at the present time the known facts,\r\nand all scientific thought, seem to point to the conclusion that the\r\ndifference between them and ordinary shooting-stars is analogous to\r\nthat between rain and mist, and, in addition to the reasons already\r\ngiven for connecting them with comets, may be mentioned the fact that\r\nmeteorites bring with them carbonic acid, which is known to form so\r\nprominent a part of comets' tails; and if fragments of meteoric iron\r\nor stone be heated moderately in a vacuum, they yield up gases\r\nconsisting of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, and the\r\nspectrum of these gases corresponds to the spectrum of a cornet's\r\ncoma and tail.\r\n\r\n\"By studying their microscopical structure, Mr. Sorby has been able\r\nto determine that the material was at one time certainly in a state\r\nof fusion; and that the most remote condition of which we have\r\npositive evidence was that of small, detached, melted globules, the\r\nformation of which can not be explained in a satisfactory manner,\r\nexcept by supposing that their constituents were originally in the\r\nstate of vapor, as they now exist in the atmosphere of the sun; and,\r\non the temperature becoming lower, condensed into these \"ultimate\r\ncosmical particles.\" These afterward collected into larger masses,\r\nwhich have been variously changed by subsequent metamorphic action,\r\nand broken up by repeated mutual impact, and often again collected\r\ntogether and solidified. The meteoric irons are probably those\r\nportions of the metallic constituents which were separated from the\r\nrest by fusion when the metamorphism was carried to that extreme\r\npoint.'\"\r\n\r\nBut if it be true, as is conceded, that all the planets and comets of\r\nthe solar system were out-throwings from the sun itself, then all\r\nmust be as much of one quality of\r\n\r\n{p. 399}\r\n\r\nmaterial as half a dozen suits of clothes made from the same bolt of\r\ncloth. And hence our-brother-the-comet must be made of just such\r\nmatter as our earth is made of. And hence, if a comet did strike the\r\nearth and deposited its ground-up and triturated material upon the\r\nearth's surface, we should find nothing different in that material\r\nfrom earth-substance of the same kind.\r\n\r\nBut, says another:\r\n\r\n\"If the Drift fell from a comet, why would not this clay-dust and\r\nthese pebbles have been consumed before reaching the earth by the\r\nfriction of our atmosphere just as we have seen the meteoroids\r\nconsumed; or, if not entirely used up, why would these pebbles not\r\nshow a fused surface, like the iron aërolites? \"\r\n\r\nHere is the difference: a meteorite, a small or large stone, is\r\ndetached, isolated, lone-wandering, lost in space; it comes within\r\nthe tremendous attractive power of our globe; it has no parental\r\nattraction to restrain it; and it rushes headlong with lightning-like\r\nrapidity toward the earth, burning itself away as it falls.\r\n\r\nBut suppose two heavenly bodies, each with its own center of\r\nattraction, each holding its own scattered materials in place by its\r\nown force, to meet each other; then there is no more probability of\r\nthe stones and dust of the comet flying to the earth, than there is\r\nof the stones and dust of the earth flying to the comet. And the\r\nattractive power of the comet, great enough to bold its gigantic mass\r\nin place through the long reaches of the fields of space, and even\r\nclose up to the burning eye of the awful sun itself, holds its dust\r\nand pebbles and bowlders together until the very moment of impact\r\nwith the earth. In short, they, the dust and stones, do not continue\r\nto follow the comet, because the earth has got in their way and\r\narrested them. It was this terrific force of the\r\n\r\n{p. 400}\r\n\r\ncomet's attraction, represented in a fearful rate of motion, that\r\ntore and pounded and scratched and furrowed our poor earth's face, as\r\nshown in the crushed and striated rocks under the Drift. They would\r\nhave gone clean through the earth to follow the comet, if it had been\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIf we can suppose the actual bulk of the comet to have greatly\r\nexceeded the bulk of the earth, then the superior attraction of the\r\ncomet may have shocked the earth out of position. It has already been\r\nsuggested that the inclination of the axis of the earth may have been\r\nchanged at the time of the Drift; and the Esquimaux have a legend\r\nthat the earth was, at that time, actually shaken out of its\r\nposition. But upon this question I express no opinion.\r\n\r\nBut another may say:\r\n\r\n\"Your theory is impossible; these dense masses of clay and gravel\r\ncould not have fallen from a comet, because the tails of comets are\r\ncomposed of material so attenuated that sometimes the stars are seen\r\nthrough them.\"\r\n\r\nGranted: but remember that the clay did not come to the earth as\r\nclay, but as a finely comminuted powder or dust; it packed into clay\r\nafter having been mixed with water. The particles of this dust must\r\nhave been widely separated while in the comet's tail; if they had not\r\nbeen, instead of a deposit of a few hundred feet, we should have had\r\none of hundreds of miles in thickness. We have seen, (page 94,\r\n_ante_,) that the tail of one comet was thirteen million miles broad;\r\nif the particles of dust composing that tail had been as minute as\r\nthose of clay-dust, and if they had been separated from each other by\r\nmany feet in distance, they would still have left a deposit on the\r\nface of any object passing through them much greater than the Drift.\r\nTo illustrate my meaning: you ride on a summer day a hundred miles in\r\na railroad-car, seated by an open\r\n\r\n{p. 401}\r\n\r\nwindow. There is no dust perceptible, at least not enough to obscure\r\nthe landscape; yet at the end of the journey you find yourself\r\ncovered with a very evident coating of dust. Now, suppose that,\r\ninstead of traveling one hundred miles, your ride had been prolonged\r\na million miles, or thirteen million miles; and, instead of the\r\natmosphere being perfectly clear, you had moved through a cloud of\r\ndust, not dense enough to intercept the light of the stars, and yet\r\ndense enough to reflect the light of the sun, even as a smoke-wreath\r\nreflects it, and you can readily see that, long before you reached\r\nthe end of your journey, you would be buried alive under hundreds of\r\nfeet of dust. To creatures like ourselves, measuring our stature by\r\nfeet and inches, a Drift-deposit three hundred feet thick is an\r\nimmense affair, even as a deposit a foot thick would be to an ant;\r\nbut, measured on an astronomical scale, with the foot-rule of the\r\nheavens, and the Drift is no more than a thin coating of dust, such\r\nas accumulates on a traveler's coat. Even estimating it upon the\r\nscale of our planet, it is a mere wrapping of tissue-paper thickness.\r\nIn short, it must be remembered that we are an infinitely\r\ninsignificant breed of little creatures, to whom a cosmical\r\ndust-shower is a cataclysm.\r\n\r\nAnd that which is true of the clay-dust is true of the gravel. At a\r\nmillion miles' distance it, too, is dust; it runs in lines or\r\nstreaks, widely separated; and the light shines between its particles\r\nas it does through the leaves of the trees\r\n\r\n     \"And glimmering through the groaning trees\r\n     Kirk Alloway seems in a blaze;\r\n     Through every bore the beams are glancing.\"\r\n\r\nBut another says:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you think the finer parts of the material of the comet are\r\ncarried farthest back from the head?\"\r\n\r\n{p. 402}\r\n\r\nBecause the attractive power lodged in the nucleus acts with most\r\nforce on the largest masses; even as the rock is not so likely to\r\nleave the earth in a wind-storm as the dust; and in the flight of the\r\ncomet through space, at the rate of three hundred and sixty-six miles\r\nper second, its lighter substances would naturally trail farthest\r\nbehind it; for--\r\n\r\n             \"The thing that's heavy in itself\r\n     Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it would seem as if in time this trailing material of the comet\r\nfalls so far behind that it loses its grip, and is lost; hence the\r\nshowers of _meteoroids_.\r\n\r\nAnother says:\r\n\r\n\"I can not accept your theory as to the glacial clays they were\r\ncertainly deposited in water, formed like silt, washed down from the\r\nadjacent continents.\"\r\n\r\nI answer they were not, because:--\r\n\r\n1. If laid down in water, they would be stratified; but they are not.\r\n\r\n2. If laid down in water, they would be full of the fossils of the\r\nwater, fresh-water shells, sea-shells, bones of fish, reptiles,\r\nwhales, seals, etc.; but they are non-fossiliferous.\r\n\r\n3. If laid down in water, they would not be made exclusively from\r\ngranite. Where are the continents to be found which are composed of\r\ngranite and nothing but granite?\r\n\r\n4. Where were the continents, of any kind, from which these washings\r\ncame? They must have reached from pole to pole, and filled the whole\r\nAtlantic Ocean. And how could the washings of rivers have made this\r\nuniform sheet, reaching over the whole length and half the breadth of\r\nthis continent?\r\n\r\n5. If these clays were made from land-washings, how comes it that in\r\nsome places they are red, in others blue, in others yellow? In\r\nWestern Minnesota you penetrate\r\n\r\n{p. 403}\r\n\r\nthrough twenty feet of yellow clay until you reach a thin layer of\r\ngravel, about an inch thick, and then pass at once, without any\r\ngradual transition, into a bed of blue clay fifty feet thick; and\r\nunder this, again, you reach gravel. What separated these various\r\ndeposits? The glacialists answer us that the yellow clay was\r\ndeposited in fresh water, and the blue clay in salt water, and hence\r\nthe difference in the color. But how did the water change instantly\r\nfrom salt to fresh? Why was there no interval of brackish water,\r\nduring which the blue and yellow clays would have gradually shaded\r\ninto each other? The transition from the yellow clay to the blue is\r\nas immediate and marked as if you were to lay a piece of yellow cloth\r\nacross a piece of blue cloth. You can not take the salt out of a vast\r\nocean, big enough to cover half a continent, in a day, a month, a\r\nyear, or a century. And where were the bowl-like ridges of land that\r\ninclosed the continent, and kept out the salt water during the ages\r\nthat elapsed while the yellow clay was being laid down in fresh\r\nwater? And, above all, why are no such clays, blue, yellow, or red,\r\nnow being formed anywhere on earth, under sheet-ice, glaciers,\r\nicebergs, or anything else? And how about the people who built\r\ncisterns, and used coins and iron implements before this silt was\r\naccumulated in the seas, a million years ago, for it must have taken\r\nthat long to create these vast deposits if they were deposited as\r\nsilt in the bottom of seas and lakes.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked:\r\n\r\n\"What relation, in order of time, do you suppose the Drift Age to\r\nhold to the Deluge of Noah and Deucalion? \"\r\n\r\nThe latter was infinitely later. The geologists, as I have shown,\r\nsuppose the Drift to have come upon the earth--basing their\r\ncalculations upon the recession of the\r\n\r\n{p. 404}\r\n\r\nFalls of Niagara--about thirty thousand years ago. We have seen that\r\nthis would nearly accord with the time given in Job, when he speaks\r\nof the position of certain constellations. The Deluge of Noah\r\nprobably occurred somewhere from eight to eleven thousand years ago.\r\nHence, about twenty thousand years probably intervened between the\r\nDrift and the Deluge. These were the \"myriads of years\" referred to\r\nby Plato, during which mankind dwelt on the great plain of Atlantis.\r\n\r\nAnd this order of events agrees with all the legends.\r\n\r\nIn the Bible a long interval elapsed between the fall of man, or his\r\nexpulsion from paradise, and the Deluge of Noah; and during this\r\nperiod mankind rose to civilization; became workers in the metals,\r\nmusicians, and the builders of cities.\r\n\r\nIn the Egyptian history, as preserved by Plato, the Deluge of\r\nDeucalion, which many things prove to have been identical with the\r\nDeluge of Noah, was the last of a series of great catastrophes.\r\n\r\nIn the Celtic legends the great Deluge of Ogyges preceded the last\r\ndeluge.\r\n\r\nIn the American legends, mankind have been many times destroyed, and\r\nas often renewed.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are you right in supposing that man first rose to civilization in a\r\ngreat Atlantic island?\r\n\r\nWe can conceive, as I have shown, mankind at some central point, like\r\nthe Atlantic island, building up anew, after the Drift Age, the\r\nshattered fragments of pre-glacial civilization, and hence becoming\r\nto the post-glacial ancient world the center and apparent fountain of\r\nall cultivation. But in view of the curious discoveries made, as I\r\nhave shown, in the glacial clays of the United\r\n\r\n{p. 405}\r\n\r\nStates, further investigations may prove that it was on the North\r\nAmerican Continent civilization was first born, and that it was\r\nthence moved _eastward_ over the bridge-like ridges to Atlantis.\r\n\r\nAnd it is, in this connection, remarkable that the Bible tells us\r\n(Genesis, chap. ii, v. 8):\r\n\r\n\"And the Lord God planted a garden _eastward, in Eden_; and there he\r\nput the man that he had formed.\"\r\n\r\nHe had first (v. 7) \"formed man of the dust of the ground,\" and then\r\nhe moves him eastward to Eden, to the garden.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I have shown, when the fall of man came, when the Drift\r\ndestroyed the lovely Tertiary conditions, man was _again moved\r\neastward_; he was driven out of Eden, and the cherubims guarded the\r\n_eastern_ extremity of the garden, to prevent man's return from (we\r\nwill say) the shores of Atlantis. In other words, the present habitat\r\nof men is, as I have shown, according to the Bible, _east_ of their\r\nformer dwelling-place.\r\n\r\nIn the age of man's declension he moved eastward. In the age of his\r\nredemption he moves westward.\r\n\r\nHence, if the Bible is to be relied on, before man reached the garden\r\nof Eden, he had been created in some region _west of the garden_, to\r\nwit, in America; and here he may have first developed the\r\ncivilization of which we find traces in Illinois, showing a\r\nmetal-working race sufficiently advanced to have an alphabet and a\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nBut in all this we do not touch upon the question of where man was\r\nfirst formed by God.\r\n\r\nThe original birthplace of the human race who shall tell? It was\r\npossibly in some region now under the ocean, as Professor Winchell\r\nhas suggested; there he was evolved during the mild, equable, gentle,\r\nplentiful,\r\n\r\n406 CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\ngarden-age of the Tertiary; in the midst of the most favorable\r\nconditions for increasing the vigor of life and expanding it into new\r\nforms. It showed its influence by developing mammalian life in one\r\ndirection into the monstrous forms of the mammoth and the mastodon,\r\nthe climax of animal growth; and in the other direction into the more\r\nmarvelous expansion of mentality found in man.\r\n\r\nThere are two things necessary to a comprehension of that which lies\r\naround us--development and design, evolution and purpose; God's way\r\nand God's intent. Neither alone will solve the problem. These are the\r\ntwo limbs of the right angle which meet at the first life-cell found\r\non earth, and lead out until we find man at one extremity and God at\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nWhy should the religious world shrink from the theory of evolution?\r\nTo know the path by which God has advanced is not to disparage God.\r\n\r\nCould all this orderly nature have grown up out of chance, out of the\r\naccidental concatenation of atoms? As Bacon said:\r\n\r\n\"I would rather believe all the fables in the Talmud and the Koran\r\nthan that this universal frame is _without a mind!_\"\r\n\r\nWonderful thought! A flash of light through the darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd what greater guarantee of the future can we have than evolution?\r\nIf God has led life from the rudest beginnings, whose fossils are\r\nengraved, (blurred and obscured,) on the many pages of the vast\r\ngeological volume, up to this intellectual, charitable, merciful,\r\npowerful world of to-day, who can doubt that the same hand will guide\r\nour posterity to even higher levels of development?\r\n\r\n{p. 407}\r\n\r\nIf our thread of life has expanded from Cain to Christ, from the man\r\nwho murders to him who submits to murder for the love of man, who can\r\ndoubt that the Cain-like in the race will gradually pass away and the\r\nChrist-like dominate the planet?\r\n\r\nReligion and science, nature and spirit, knowledge of God's works and\r\nreverence for God, are brethren, who should stand together with\r\ntwined arms, singing perpetual praises to that vast atmosphere,\r\nocean, universe of spirituality, out of which matter has been born,\r\nof which matter is but a condensation; that illimitable,\r\nincomprehensible, awe-full Something, before the conception of which\r\nmen should go down upon the very knees of their hearts in adoration.\r\n\r\n{p. 408}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                            BIELA'S COMET.\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT Says:\r\n\r\n\"It is probable that the vapor of the tails of comets mingled with\r\nour atmosphere in the years 1819 and 1823.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the present generation has passed\r\nthrough the gaseous prolongation of a comet's tail, and that hundreds\r\nof human beings lost their lives, somewhat as they perished in the\r\nAge of Fire and Gravel, burned up and poisoned by its exhalations.\r\n\r\nAnd, although this catastrophe was upon an infinitely smaller scale\r\nthan that of the old time, still it may throw some light upon the\r\ngreat cataclysm. At least it is a curious story, with some marvelous\r\nfeatures:\r\n\r\nOn the 27th day of February, 1826, (to begin as M. Dumas would\r\ncommence one of his novels,) M. Biela, an Austrian officer, residing\r\nat Josephstadt, in Bohemia, discovered a comet in the constellation\r\nAries, which, at that time, was seen as a small round speck of filmy\r\ncloud. Its course was watched during the following month by M.\r\nGambart at Marseilles and by M. Clausen at Altona, and those\r\nobservers assigned to it an elliptical orbit, with a period of _six\r\nyears and three quarters_ for its revolution.\r\n\r\nM. Damoiseau subsequently calculated its path, and announced that on\r\nits next return the comet would cross\r\n\r\n[1. \"Cosmos,\" Vol. i, p. 100.]\r\n\r\n{p. 409}\r\n\r\nthe orbit of the earth, within _twenty thousand miles of its track,\r\nand but about one month before the earth would have arrived at the\r\nsame spot!_\r\n\r\nThis was shooting close to the bull's-eye!\r\n\r\nHe estimated that it would lose nearly ten days on its return trip,\r\nthrough the retarding influence of Jupiter and Saturn; but, if it\r\nlost forty days instead of ten, what then?\r\n\r\nBut the comet came up to time in 1832, and the earth _missed it by\r\none month_.\r\n\r\nAnd it returned in like fashion in 1839 and 1846. But here a\r\nsurprising thing occurred. _Its proximity to the earth had split it\r\nin two_; each half had a head and tail of its own; each had set up a\r\nseparate government for itself; and they were whirling through space,\r\nside by side, like a couple of race-horses, about sixteen thousand\r\nmiles apart, or about twice as wide apart as the diameter of the\r\nearth. Here is a picture of them, drawn from life.\r\n\r\n                                  ###\r\n\r\n  BIELA'S COMET, SPLIT IN TWO, (From Guillemin's \"The Heavens,\" page\r\n                                247.)\r\n\r\n{p. 410} Did the Fenris-Wolf, the Midgard-Serpent, and the Dog-Garm\r\nlook like this?\r\n\r\nIn 1852, 1859, and 1866, the comet SHOULD have returned, but it did\r\nnot. It was lost. It was dissipated. Its material was banging around\r\nthe earth in fragments somewhere. I quote from a writer in a recent\r\nissue of the \"Edinburgh Review\":\r\n\r\nThe puzzled astronomers were left in a state of tantalizing\r\nuncertainty as to what had become of it. At the beginning of the year\r\n1866 this feeling of bewilderment gained expression in the Annual\r\nReport of the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society. The matter\r\ncontinued, nevertheless, in the same state of provoking uncertainty\r\nfor another six years. The third period of the perihelion passage had\r\nthen passed, and nothing had been seen of the missing luminary. But\r\non the night of November 27, 1872, night-watchers were startled by a\r\nsudden and a very magnificent display of falling stars or meteors, of\r\nwhich there had been no previous forecast, and Professor\r\nKlinkerflues, of Berlin, having carefully noted the common radiant\r\npoint in space from which this star-shower was discharged into the\r\nearth's atmosphere, with the intuition of ready genius jumped at once\r\nto the startling inference that here at last were traces of the\r\nmissing luminary. There were eighty of the meteors that furnished a\r\ngood position for the radiant point of the discharge, and that\r\nposition, strange to say, was very much the same as the position in\r\nspace which Biela's comet should have occupied just about that time\r\non its fourth return toward perihelion. Klinkerflues, therefore,\r\ntaking this spot as one point in the path of the comet, and carrying\r\nthe path on as a track into forward space, fixed the direction there\r\nthrough which it should pass as a 'vanishing-point' at the other side\r\nof the starry sphere, and having satisfied himself of that further\r\nposition he sent off a telegram to the other side of the world, where\r\nalone it could be seen--that is to say, to Mr. Pogson, of the Madras\r\nObservatory--which may be best told in his own nervous and simple\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n{p. 411}\r\n\r\nHerr Klinkerflues's telegram to Mr. Pogson, of Madras, was to the\r\nfollowing effect:\r\n\r\n\"'November 30th--Biela touched the earth on the 27th of November.\r\nSearch for him near Theta Centauri.'\r\n\r\n\"The telegram reached Madras, through Russia, in one hour and\r\nthirty-five minutes, and the sequel of this curious passage of\r\nastronomical romance may be appropriately told in the words in which\r\nMr. Pogson replied to Herr Klinkerflues's pithy message. The answer\r\nwas dated Madras, the 6th of December, and was in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"'On the 30th of November, at sixteen hours, the time of the comet\r\nrising here, I was at my post, but hopelessly; clouds and rain gave\r\nme no chance. The next morning I had the same bad luck. But on the\r\nthird trial, with a line of blue break, about 17¼ hours mean time, _I\r\nfound Biela immediately!_ Only four comparisons in successive minutes\r\ncould be obtained, in strong morning twilight, with an anonymous\r\nstar; but direct motion of 2.5 seconds decided that I had got the\r\ncomet all right. I noted it--circular, bright, with, a decided\r\nnucleus, but NO TAIL, and about forty-five seconds in diameter. Next\r\nmorning I got seven good comparisons with an anonymous star, showing\r\na motion of 17.9 seconds in twenty-eight minutes, and I also got two\r\ncomparisons with a Madras star in our current catalogue, and with\r\n7,734 Taylor. I was too anxious to secure one good place for the one\r\nin hand to look for the other comet, and the fourth morning was\r\ncloudy and rainy.'\r\n\r\n\"Herr Klinkerflues's commentary upon this communication was that he\r\nforthwith proceeded to satisfy himself that no provoking accident had\r\nled to the discovery of a comet altogether unconnected with Biela's,\r\nalthough in this particular place, and that he was ultimately quite\r\nconfident of the identity of the comet observed by Mr. Pogson with\r\none of the two heads of Biela. It was subsequently settled that Mr.\r\nPogson had, most probably, seen both heads of the comet, one on the\r\nfirst occasion of his successful search, and the second on the\r\nfollowing day; and the meteor-shower experienced in Europe on\r\nNovember 27th was unquestionably due to the passage\r\n\r\n{p. 412}\r\n\r\nnear the earth of a meteoric trail traveling in the track of the\r\ncomet. When the question of a possible collision was mooted in 1832,\r\nSir John Herschel remarked that such an occurrence might not be\r\nunattended with danger, and that on account of the intersection of\r\nthe orbits of the earth and the comet a rencontre would in all\r\nlikelihood take place within the lapse of some millions of years. As\r\na matter of fact the collision did take place on November 27, 1872,\r\nand the result, so far as the earth was concerned, was a magnificent\r\ndisplay of aërial fireworks! But a more telling piece of ready-witted\r\nsagacity than this prompt employment of the telegraph for the\r\napprehension of the nimble delinquent can scarcely be conceived. The\r\nsudden brush of the comet's tail, the instantaneous telegram to the\r\nopposite side of the world, and the glimpse thence of the vagrant\r\nluminary as it was just whisking itself off into space toward the\r\nstar Theta Centauri, together constitute a passage that stands quite\r\nwithout a parallel in the experience of science.\"\r\n\r\nBut did the earth escape with a mere shower of fireworks?\r\n\r\nI have argued that the material of a comet consists of a solid\r\nnucleus, giving out fire and gas, enveloped in a great gaseous mass,\r\nand a tail made up of stones, possibly gradually diminishing in size\r\nas they recede from the nucleus, until the after-part of it is\r\ncomposed of fine dust ground from the pebbles and bowlders; while\r\nbeyond this there may be a still further prolongation into gaseous\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nNow, we have seen that Biela's comets lost their tails. What became\r\nof them? There is no evidence to show whether they lost them in 1852,\r\n1859, 1866, or 1872. The probabilities are that the demoralization\r\ntook place before 1852, as otherwise the comets would have been seen,\r\ntails and all, in that and subsequent years. It is true that the\r\nearth came near enough in 1872 to attract some of the wandering\r\ngravel-stones toward itself, and that they fell,\r\n\r\n{p. 413}\r\n\r\nblazing and consuming themselves with the friction of our atmosphere,\r\nand reached the surface of our planet, if at all, as cosmic dust. But\r\nwhere were the rest of the assets of these bankrupt comets? They were\r\nprobably scattered around in space, _disjecta membra_, floating\r\nhither and thither, in one place a stream of stones, in another a\r\nvolume of gas; while the two heads had fled away, like the fugitive\r\npresidents of a couple of broken banks, to the Canadian refuge of\r\n\"_Theta Centauri_\"--shorn of their splendors and reduced to first\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nDid anything out of the usual order occur on the face of the earth\r\nabout this time?\r\n\r\nYes. In the year 1871, on Sunday, the 8th of October, at half past\r\nnine o'clock in the evening, events occurred which attracted the\r\nattention of the whole world, which caused the death of hundreds of\r\nhuman beings, and the destruction of millions of property, and which\r\ninvolved three different States of the Union in the wildest alarm and\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1871 had been excessively dry; the moisture seemed to\r\nbe evaporated out of the air; and on the Sunday above named the\r\natmospheric conditions all through the Northwest were of the most\r\npeculiar character. The writer was living at the time in Minnesota,\r\nhundreds of miles from the scene of the disasters, and he can never\r\nforget the condition of things. There was a parched, combustible,\r\ninflammable, furnace-like feeling in the air, that was really\r\nalarming. It felt as if there were needed but a match, a spark, to\r\ncause a world-wide explosion. It was weird and unnatural. I have\r\nnever seen nor felt anything like it before or since. Those who\r\nexperienced it will bear me out in these statements.\r\n\r\nAt that hour, half past nine o'clock in the evening, _at apparently\r\nthe same moment_, at points hundreds of miles\r\n\r\n{p. 414}\r\n\r\napart, in three different States, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois,\r\nfires of the most peculiar and devastating kind broke out, so far as\r\nwe know, by spontaneous combustion.\r\n\r\nIn Wisconsin, on its eastern borders, in a heavily timbered country,\r\nnear Lake Michigan, a region embracing _four hundred square miles_,\r\nextending north from Brown County, and containing Peshtigo, Manistee,\r\nHolland, and numerous villages on the shores of Green Bay, was swept\r\nbare by an absolute whirlwind of flame. There were _seven hundred and\r\nfifty people killed outright_, besides great numbers of the wounded,\r\nmaimed, and burned, who died afterward. More than three million\r\ndollars' worth of property was destroyed.[1]\r\n\r\nIt was no ordinary fire. I quote:\r\n\r\n\"At sundown there was a lull in the wind and comparative stillness.\r\nFor two hours there were no signs of danger; but at a few minutes\r\nafter nine o'clock, and by a singular coincidence, _precisely the\r\ntime at which the Chicago fire commenced_, the people of the village\r\nheard a terrible roar. It was that of a tornado, crushing through the\r\nforests. _Instantly the heavens were illuminated with a terrible\r\nglare_. _The sky_, which had been so dark a moment before, _burst\r\ninto clouds of flame_. A spectator of the terrible scene says the\r\nfire did not come upon them gradually from burning trees and other\r\nobjects to the windward, but the first notice they had of it was _a\r\nwhirlwind of flame in great clouds from above the tops of the trees_,\r\nwhich fell upon and entirely enveloped everything. The poor people\r\ninhaled it, or the intensely hot air, and fell down dead. This is\r\nverified by the appearance of many of the corpses. They were found\r\ndead in the roads and open spaces, _where there were no visible marks\r\nof fire near by, with not a trace of burning upon their bodies or\r\nclothing_. At the Sugar Bush, which is an extended clearing, in some\r\nplaces four miles in width,\r\n\r\n[1. See \"History of the Great Conflagration,\" Sheahan & Upton,\r\nChicago, 1871, pp. 393, 394, etc.]\r\n\r\n{p. 415}\r\n\r\ncorpses were found in the open road, between fences only slightly\r\nburned. _No mark of fire was upon them; they lay there as if asleep_.\r\nThis phenomenon seems to explain the fact that so many were killed in\r\ncompact masses. They seemed to have huddled together, in what were\r\nevidently regarded at the moment as the safest places, _far away from\r\nbuildings, trees, or other inflammable_ material, and there to have\r\ndied together.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAnother spectator says:\r\n\r\n\"Much has been said of the intense heat of the fires which destroyed\r\nPeshtigo, Menekaune, Williamsonville, etc., but all that has been\r\nsaid can give the stranger but a faint conception of the reality. The\r\nheat has been compared to that engendered by a flame concentrated on\r\nan object by a blow-pipe; but even that would not account for some of\r\nthe phenomena. For instance, we have in our possession a copper cent\r\ntaken from the pocket of a dead man in the Peshtigo Sugar Bush, which\r\nwill illustrate our point. _This cent has been partially fused_, but\r\nstill retains its round form, and the inscription upon it is legible.\r\nOthers, in the same pocket, were partially _melted_, and yet _the\r\nclothing and the body of the man were not even singed_. We do not\r\nknow in what way to account for this, unless, as is asserted by some,\r\nthe tornado and fire were accompanied by electrical phenomena.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\"It is the universal testimony that the prevailing idea among the\r\npeople was, that the last day had come. Accustomed as they were to\r\nfire, nothing like this had ever been known. They could give no other\r\ninterpretation to this ominous roar, this _bursting of the sky with\r\nfame, and this dropping down of fire out of the very heavens_,\r\nconsuming instantly everything it touched.\r\n\r\n\"No two give a like description of the great tornado as it smote and\r\ndevoured the village. It seemed as if 'the fiery fiends of hell had\r\nbeen loosened,' says one. 'It came in great sheeted _flames from\r\nheaven_,' says another. 'There was _a pitiless rain of fire and_\r\nSAND.' 'The\r\n\r\n[1. See \"History of the Great Conflagration,\" Sheahan & Upton,\r\nChicago, 1871, p. 372.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 373.]\r\n\r\n{p. 416}\r\n\r\natmosphere was all afire.' Some speak of '_great balls of fire\r\nunrolling and shooting forth, in streams_.' The fire leaped over\r\nroofs and trees, and ignited whole streets at once. No one could\r\nstand before the blast. It was a race with death, above, behind, and\r\nbefore them.\"[1]\r\n\r\nA civil engineer, doing business in Peshtigo, says\r\n\r\n\"The heat increased so rapidly, as things got well afire, that, _when\r\nabout four hundred feet from the bridge and the nearest building_, I\r\nwas obliged to lie down behind a log that was aground in about two\r\nfeet of water, and by going under water now and then, and holding my\r\nhead close to the water behind the log, I managed to breathe. There\r\nwere a dozen others behind the same log. If I had succeeded in\r\ncrossing the river and gone among the buildings on the other side,\r\nprobably I should have been lost, as many were.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen Ovid describing the people of \"the earth\" crouching in\r\nthe same way in the water to save themselves from the flames of the\r\nAge of Fire.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, one Allison Weaver, near Port Huron, determined to\r\nremain, to protect, if possible, some mill-property of which he had\r\ncharge. He knew the fire was coming, and dug himself a shallow well\r\nor pit, made a thick plank cover to place over it, and thus prepared\r\nto bide the conflagration.\r\n\r\nI quote:\r\n\r\n\"He filled it nearly full of water, and took care to saturate the\r\nground around it for a distance of several rods. Going to the mill,\r\nhe dragged out a four-inch plank, sawed it in two, and saw that the\r\nparts tightly covered the mouth of the little well. 'I kalkerated it\r\nwould be tech and go,' said he, 'but it was the best I could do.' At\r\nmidnight he had everything arranged, and the roaring then was\r\n\r\n[1. See \"History of the Great Conflagration,\" Sheahan & Upton,\r\nChicago, 1871, p. 374.]\r\n\r\n{p. 417}\r\n\r\nawful to hear. The clearing was ten to twelve acres in extent, and\r\nWeaver says that, for two hours before the fire reached him, there\r\nwas a constant flight across the ground of small animals. As he\r\nrested a moment from giving the house another wetting down, a horse\r\ndashed into the opening at full speed and made for the house. Weaver\r\ncould see him tremble and shake with excitement and terror, and felt\r\na pity for him. After a moment the animal gave utterance to a snort\r\nof dismay, ran two or three times around the house, and then shot on\r\ninto the woods like a rocket.\"\r\n\r\nWe have, in the foregoing pages, in the legends of different nations,\r\ndescriptions of the terrified animals flying with the men into the\r\ncaves of the earth to escape the great conflagration.\r\n\r\n'I Not long after this the fire came. Weaver stood by his well, ready\r\nfor the emergency, yet curious to see the breaking-in of the flames.\r\nThe roaring increased in volume, the air became oppressive, a cloud\r\nof dust and cinders came showering down, and he could see the flame\r\nthrough the trees. It did not run along the ground, or leap from tree\r\nto tree, but it came on like a tornado, _a sheet of flame reaching\r\nfrom the earth to the tops of the trees_. As it struck the clearing\r\nhe jumped into his well, and closed over the planks. He could no\r\nlonger see, but he could hear. He says that the flames made no halt\r\nwhatever, or ceased their roaring for an instant, but he hardly got\r\nthe opening closed before the house and mill were burning tinder, and\r\nboth were down in five minutes. The smoke came down upon him\r\npowerfully, and his den was so hot he could hardly breathe.\r\n\r\n\"He knew that the planks above him were on fire, but, remembering\r\ntheir thickness, he waited till the roaring of the flames had died\r\naway, and then with his head and hands turned them over and put out\r\nthe fire by dashing up water with his hands. Although it was a cold\r\nnight, and the water had at first chilled him, the heat gradually\r\nwarmed him up until he felt quite comfortable. He remained in his den\r\nuntil daylight, frequently turning\r\n\r\n{p. 418}\r\n\r\nover the planks and putting out the fire, and then the worst had\r\npassed. The earth around was on fire in spots, house and mill were\r\ngone, leaves, brush, and logs were swept clean away as if shaved off\r\nand swept with a broom, and nothing but soot and ashes were to be\r\nseen.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn Wisconsin, at Williamson's Mills, there was a large but shallow\r\nwell on the premises belonging to a Mr. Boorman. The people, when cut\r\noff by the flames and wild with terror, and thinking they would find\r\nsafety in the water, leaped into this well. \"The relentless fury of\r\nthe flames drove them pell-mell into the pit, to struggle with each\r\nother and die--some by drowning, and others by fire and suffocation.\r\nNone escaped. _Thirty-two bodies were found there_. They were in\r\nevery imaginable position; but the contortions of their limbs and the\r\nagonizing expressions of their faces told the awful tale.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe recital of these details, horrible though they may be, becomes\r\nexcusable when we remember that the ancestors of our race must have\r\nendured similar horrors in that awful calamity which I have discussed\r\nin this volume.\r\n\r\nJames B. Clark, of Detroit, who was at Uniontown, Wisconsin, writes:\r\n\r\n\"The fire suddenly made a rush, like the flash of a train of\r\ngunpowder, and swept in the shape of a crescent around the\r\nsettlement. It is almost impossible to conceive _the frightful\r\nrapidity of the advance of the flames_. The rushing fire seemed to\r\neat up and annihilate the trees.\"\r\n\r\nThey saw a black mass coming toward them from the wall of flame:\r\n\r\n\"It was a stampede of cattle and horses thundering toward us,\r\nbellowing moaning, and neighing as they galloped\r\n\r\n[1. See \"History of the Great Conflagration,\" Sheahan & Upton,\r\nChicago, 1871, p. 390.\r\n\r\n2.

Some had\r\nbeen badly burned, and must have plunged through a long space of\r\nflame in the desperate effort to escape. Following considerably\r\nbehind came a solitary horse, panting and snorting and nearly\r\nexhausted. He was saddled and bridled, and, as we first thought, had\r\na bag lashed to his back. As he came up we were startled at the sight\r\nof a young lad lying fallen over the animal's neck, the bridle wound\r\naround his hands, and the mane being clinched by the fingers. Little\r\neffort was needed to stop the jaded horse, and at once release the\r\nhelpless boy. He was taken into the house, and all that we could do\r\nwas done; but he had inhaled the smoke, and was seemingly dying. Some\r\ntime elapsed and he revived enough to speak. He told his\r\nname--Patrick Byrnes--and said: 'Father and mother and the children\r\ngot into the wagon. I don't know what became of them. Everything is\r\nburned up. I am dying. Oh! is hell any worse than this?'\"[1]\r\n\r\nHow vividly does all this recall the book of Job and the legends of\r\nCentral America, which refer to the multitudes of the burned, maimed,\r\nand wounded lying in the caverns, moaning and crying like poor\r\nPatrick Byrnes, suffering no less in mind than in body!\r\n\r\nWhen we leave Wisconsin and pass about two hundred and fifty miles\r\neastward, over Lake Michigan and across the whole width of the State\r\nof Michigan, we find much the same condition of things, but not so\r\nterrible in the loss of human life. Fully _fifteen thousand people\r\nwere rendered homeless by the fires_; and their food, clothing,\r\ncrops, horses, and cattle were destroyed. Of these five to six\r\nthousand were burned out the _same night that the fires broke out in\r\nChicago and Wisconsin_. The\r\n\r\n[1. See \"History of the Great Conflagration,\" Sheahan & Upton,\r\nChicago, 1871, p. 383.]\r\n\r\n{p. 420}\r\n\r\ntotal destruction of property exceeded one million dollars; not only\r\nvillages and cities, but whole townships, were swept bare.\r\n\r\nBut it is to Chicago we must turn for the most extraordinary results\r\nof this atmospheric disturbance. It is needless to tell the story in\r\ndetail. The world knows it by heart:\r\n\r\n     Blackened and bleeding, helpless, panting, prone,\r\n     On the charred fragments of her shattered throne,\r\n     Lies she who stood but yesterday alone.\"\r\n\r\nI have only space to refer to one or two points.\r\n\r\nThe fire was spontaneous. The story of Mrs. O'Leary's cow having\r\nstarted the conflagration by kicking over a lantern was proved to be\r\nfalse. It was the access of gas from the tail of Biela's comet that\r\nburned up Chicago!\r\n\r\nThe fire-marshal testified:\r\n\r\n\"I felt it in my bones that we were going to have a burn.\"\r\n\r\nHe says, speaking of O'Leary's barn:\r\n\r\n\"We got the fire under control, and it would not have gone a foot\r\nfarther; but the next thing I knew they came and told me that St.\r\nPaul's church, about two squares north, was on fire.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThey checked the church-fire, but--\r\n\r\n\"The next thing I knew the fire was in Bateham's planing-mill.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in the New York \"Evening Post\" says he saw in Chicago\r\n\"buildings far beyond the line of fire, _and in no contact with it,\r\nburst into flames from the interior_.\"\r\n\r\n[1. See \"History of the Great Conflagration,\" Sheahan & Upton,\r\nChicago, 1871, p. 163.]\r\n\r\n{p. 421}\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the fall of 1871 was marked by\r\nextraordinary conflagrations in regions widely separated. On the 8th.\r\nof October, _the same day_ the Wisconsin, Michigan, and Chicago fires\r\nbroke out, the States of Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana, and Illinois were\r\nseverely devastated by prairie-fires; while terrible fires raged on\r\nthe Alleghanies, the Sierras of the Pacific coast, and the Rocky\r\nMountains, and in the region of the Red River of the North.\r\n\r\n\"The Annual Record of Science and Industry\" for 1876, page 84, says:\r\n\r\n\"For weeks before and after the great fire in Chicago in 1872, great\r\nareas of forest and prairie-land, both in the United States and the\r\nBritish Provinces, were on fire.\"\r\n\r\nThe flames that consumed a great part of Chicago were of an unusual\r\ncharacter and produced extraordinary effects. They absolutely\r\n_melted_ the hardest building-stone, which had previously been\r\nconsidered fire-proof. Iron, glass, granite, were fused and run\r\ntogether into grotesque conglomerates, as if they had been put\r\nthrough a blast-furnace. No kind of material could stand its breath\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\nI quote again from Sheahan & Upton's Work:\r\n\r\n\"The huge stone and brick structures melted before the fierceness of\r\nthe flames as a snow-flake melts and disappears in water, and almost\r\nas quickly. Six-story buildings would take fire and _disappear for\r\never from sight in five minutes by the watch_. . . . The fire also\r\ndoubled on its track at the great Union Depot and burned half a mile\r\nsouthward _in the very teeth of the gale_--a gale which blew a\r\nperfect tornado, and in which no vessel could have lived on the lake.\r\n. . . _Strange, fantastic fires of blue, red, and green played along\r\nthe cornices of buildings_.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1. \"History of the Chicago Fire,\" pp. 85, 86.]\r\n\r\n{p. 422}\r\n\r\nHon. William B. Ogden wrote at the time:\r\n\r\n\"The fire was accompanied by the fiercest tornado of wind ever known\r\nto blow here.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"The most striking peculiarity of the fire was its intense heat.\r\nNothing exposed to it escaped. Amid the hundreds of acres left bare\r\nthere is not to be found a piece of wood of any description, and,\r\n_unlike most fires, it left nothing half burned_. . . . The fire\r\nswept the streets of all the ordinary dust and rubbish, consuming it\r\ninstantly.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe Athens marble burned like coal!\r\n\r\n\"The intensity of the heat may be judged, and the thorough combustion\r\nof everything wooden may be understood, when we state that in the\r\nyard of one of the large agricultural-implement factories was stacked\r\nsome hundreds of tons of pig-iron. This iron was two hundred feet\r\nfrom any building. To the south of it was the river, one hundred and\r\nfifty feet wide. No large building but the factory was in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the fire. Yet, so great was the heat, that\r\n_this pile of iron melted and run, and is now in one large and nearly\r\nsolid mass_.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe amount of property destroyed was estimated by Mayor Medill at one\r\nhundred and fifty million dollars; and the number of people rendered\r\nhouseless, at one hundred and twenty-five thousand. Several hundred\r\nlives were lost.\r\n\r\nAll this brings before our eyes vividly the condition of things when\r\nthe comet struck the earth; when conflagrations spread over wide\r\nareas; when human beings were consumed by the million; when their\r\nworks were obliterated, and the remnants of the multitude fled before\r\nthe rushing flames, filled with unutterable consternation;\r\n\r\n[1. \"History of the Chicago Fire,\" p. 87.\r\n\r\n2.

Who shall say how far great revolutions and wars and other\r\nperturbations of humanity have been due to similar modifications?\r\nThere is a world of philosophy in that curious story, \"Dr. Ox's\r\nHobby,\" wherein we are told how he changed the mental traits of a\r\nvillage of Hollanders by increasing the amount of oxygen in the air\r\nthey breathed.\r\n\r\n{p. 424}\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                   THE UNIVERSAL BELIEF OF MANKIND.\r\n\r\nTHERE are some thoughts and opinions which we seem to take by\r\ninheritance; we imbibe them with our mothers' milk; they are in our\r\nblood; they are received insensibly in childhood.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the folk-lore of the nations, passing through the\r\nendless and continuous generation of children, unchanged from the\r\nremotest ages.\r\n\r\nIn the same way there is an untaught but universal feeling which\r\nmakes all mankind regard comets with fear and trembling, and which\r\nunites all races of men in a universal belief that some day the world\r\nwill be destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nThere are many things which indicate that a far-distant, prehistoric\r\nrace existed in the background of Egyptian and Babylonian\r\ndevelopment, and that from this people, highly civilized and\r\neducated, we have derived the arrangement of the heavens into\r\nconstellations, and our divisions of time into days, weeks, years,\r\nand centuries. This people stood much nearer the Drift Age than we\r\ndo. They understood it better. Their legends and religious beliefs\r\nwere full of it. The gods carved on Hindoo temples or painted on the\r\nwalls of Assyrian, Peruvian, or American structures, the flying\r\ndragons, the winged gods, the winged animals, Gucumatz, Rama, Siva,\r\nVishnu, Tezcatlipoca, were painted in the very colors of the clays\r\nwhich came from the disintegration of the granite, \"red,\r\n\r\n{p. 425}\r\n\r\nwhite, and blue,\" the very colors which distinguished the comet; and\r\nthey are all reminiscences of that great monster. The idols of the\r\npagan world are, in fact, congealed history, and will some day be\r\nintelligently studied as such.\r\n\r\nDoubtless this ancient astronomical, zodiac-building, and\r\nconstellation-constructing race taught the people the true doctrine\r\nof comets; taught that the winding serpent, the flying dragon, the\r\ndestructive winged dog, or wolf, or lion, whose sphinx-like images\r\nnow frown upon us from ancient walls and door-ways, were really\r\ncomets; taught how one of them had actually struck the earth; and\r\ntaught that in the lapse of ages another of these multitudinous\r\nwanderers of space would again encounter our globe, and end all\r\nthings in one universal conflagration.\r\n\r\nAnd down through the race this belief has come, and down through the\r\nrace it will go, to the consummation of time.\r\n\r\nWe find this \"day of wrath\" prefigured in the words of Malachi,\r\n(chap. iv, v. 1):\r\n\r\n\"1. For behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven; and all the\r\nproud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day\r\nthat cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it\r\nshall leave them neither root nor branch.\r\n\r\n\"2. But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness\r\narise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up\r\nas calves of the stall.\r\n\r\n\"3. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under\r\nthe soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the\r\nLord of hosts.\"\r\n\r\nWe find the same great catastrophe foretold in the book of\r\nRevelation, (chap. xii, v. 3):\r\n\r\n\"And there appeared another _wonder in heaven_; and behold a great\r\nred _dragon_, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon\r\nhis heads.\r\n\r\n{p. 426}\r\n\r\n\"4. _And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did\r\ncast them to the earth_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, (chap. vi):\r\n\r\n\"12. And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there\r\nwas a great earthquake; _and the sun became black as sackcloth of\r\nhair_, and the moon became as blood;\r\n\r\n\"13. _And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth_, even as a\r\nfig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n\"14. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together;\r\nand _every mountain and island were moved out of their places_.\r\n\r\n\"15. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,\r\nand the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman and\r\nevery freeman, _hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the\r\nmountains_;\r\n\r\n\"16. And said to the mountains and the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us\r\nfrom the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath\r\nof the Lamb\r\n\r\n17. _For the great day of his wrath is come_, and who shall be able\r\nto stand?\"\r\n\r\nHere we seem to have the story of Job over again, in this\r\nprefiguration of the future.\r\n\r\nThe Ethiopian copy of the apocryphal book of Enoch contains a poem,\r\nwhich is prefixed to the body of that work, and which the learned\r\nauthor of \"Nimrod\" supposes to be authentic. It certainly dates from\r\na vast antiquity. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Enoch, a righteous man, who was with God, answered and spoke while\r\nhis eyes were open, and while _he saw a holy vision in the heavens_.\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\"Upon this account I spoke, and conversed with him who will _go forth\r\nfrom his habitation_, the holy and mighty One, the God of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Who will hereafter tread upon the mountain Sinai, and _appear with\r\nhis hosts_, and he manifested in the strength of his power from\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n{p. 427}\r\n\r\n\"All shall be afraid, and the watchers be terrified. Great fear and\r\ntrembling shall seize even to the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The lofty mountains shall be troubled, and the exalted hills\r\ndepressed, _melting like honeycomb in the flame_.\r\n\r\n\"The earth shall be _immerged_, and _all things_ which are in it\r\n_perish_. . . .\r\n\r\n\"He shall preserve the elect, and toward them exercise clemency. . .\r\n. The whole earth is full of water.\"\r\n\r\nThis is either history or prophecy.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Epistle General of Peter, (chap. iii,) we have some\r\nallusions to the past, and some prophecies based upon the past, which\r\nare very curious:\r\n\r\nVerse 5. \"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word\r\nof God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the\r\nwater and in the water.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the earth was, as in Ovid and Ragnarok, and the\r\nlegends generally, an island, \"standing out of the water and in the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nVerse 6. \"Whereby _the world that then was_, being overflowed with\r\nwater, perished.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems to refer to the island Atlantis, \"overflowed with water,\"\r\nand destroyed, as told by Plato; thereby forming a very distinct\r\nconnection between the Island of Poseidon and the Deluge of Noah.\r\n\r\nWe read on:\r\n\r\nVerse 7. \"But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same\r\nword are kept in store, _reserved unto fire_ against the day of\r\njudgment and perdition of ungodly men.\"\r\n\r\nVerse 10. \"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night;\r\nin the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the\r\nelements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works\r\nthat are therein shall be burned up.\"\r\n\r\n{p. 428}\r\n\r\nThe Gothic mythology tells us that Surt, with his flaming sword,\r\n\"shall come at the end of the world; he shall vanquish all the gods;\r\nhe shall give up the universe a prey to the flames.\"\r\n\r\nThis belief in the ultimate destruction of the world and all its\r\ninhabitants by fire was found among the American races as well as\r\nthose of the Old World:\r\n\r\n\"The same terror inspired the Peruvians at every eclipse; for some\r\nday--taught the Amantas--the shadow will veil the sun for ever, and\r\nland, moon, and stars will be wrapped in a devouring conflagration,\r\nto know no regeneration.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe Algonquin races believed that some day Michabo \"will stamp his\r\nfoot on the ground, flames will burst forth to consume the habitable\r\nland; only a pair, or only, at most, those who have maintained\r\ninviolate the institutions he ordained, will he protect and preserve\r\nto inhabit the new world he will then fabricate.\"[2]\r\n\r\nNearly all the American tribes had similar presentiments. The\r\nChickasaws, the Mandans of the Missouri, the Pueblo Indians of New\r\nMexico, the Muyscas of Bogota, the Botocudos of Brazil, the\r\nAraucanians of Chili, the Winnebagoes, all have possessed such a\r\nbelief from time immemorial. The Mayas of Yucatan had a prediction\r\nwhich Father Lizana, _curé_ of Itzamal, preserved in the Spanish\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n     \"At the close of the ages, it hath been decreed,\r\n     Shall perish and vanish each weak god of men,\r\n     And the world shall be _purged with ravening fire_.\"\r\n\r\nWe know that among our own people, the European races, this looking\r\nforward to a conflagration which is to end all things is found\r\neverywhere; and that everywhere a comet is regarded with terror. It\r\nis a messenger of\r\n\r\n[1. Brinton's \"Myths,\" p. 235.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n{p. 429}\r\n\r\nwoe and disaster; it is a dreadful threat shining in the heavens; it\r\nis \"God's rod,\" even as it was in Job's day.\r\n\r\nI could fill pages with the proofs of the truth of this statement.\r\n\r\nAn ancient writer, describing the great meteoric shower of the year\r\n1202, says:\r\n\r\n\"The stars flew against one another like a scattering swarm of\r\nlocusts, to the right and left; this phenomenon lasted until\r\ndaybreak; people were thrown into consternation and cried to God, the\r\nMost High, with confused clamor.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe great meteoric display of 1366 produced similar effects. An\r\nhistorian of the time says:\r\n\r\n\"Those who saw it were filled with such great fear and dismay that\r\nthey were astounded, imagining that they were all dead men, and that\r\nthe end of the world had come.\"[2]\r\n\r\nHow could such a universal terror have fixed itself in the blood of\r\nthe race, if it had not originated from some great primeval fact? And\r\nall this terror is associated with a dragon.\r\n\r\nAnd Chambers says:\r\n\r\n\"The dragon appears in the mythical history and legendary poetry of\r\nalmost every nation, as the emblem of the destructive and anarchical\r\nprinciple; . . . as misdirected physical force and untamable animal\r\npassions. . . . The dragon proceeds openly to work, running on its\r\nfeet with expanded wings, and head and tail erect, violently and\r\nruthlessly outraging decency and propriety, _spouting fire and fury\r\nfrom both mouth and tail, and wasting and devastating the whole\r\nland_.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThis fiery monster is the comet.\r\n\r\n[1. Popular Science Monthly,\" June, 1882, p. 193.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 193.\r\n\r\n3. \"Chambers's Encyclopaedia,\" vol. iii, p. 655.]\r\n\r\n{p. 430}\r\n\r\nAnd Milton speaks from the same universal inspiration when he tells\r\nus:\r\n\r\n            \"A comet burned,\r\n     That fires the length of Ophiucus huge\r\n     In th' arctic sky, and _from its horrid hair\r\n     Shakes pestilence and war_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the Shakespeare plays[1] we read:\r\n\r\n     \"Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!\r\n     Comets, importing change of times and states,\r\n     Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky;\r\n     And with them scourge the bad revolting stars.\"\r\n\r\nMan, by an inherited instinct, regards the comet as a great terror\r\nand a great foe; and the heart of humanity sits uneasily when one\r\nblazes in the sky. Even to the scholar and the scientist they are a\r\npuzzle and a fear; they are erratic, unusual, anarchical,\r\nmonstrous--something let loose, like a tiger of the heavens, athwart\r\nan orderly, peaceful, and harmonious world. They may be impalpable\r\nand harmless attenuations of gas, or they way be loaded with death\r\nand ruin; but in any event man can not contemplate them without\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n[1. 1 Henry VI, 1, 1.]\r\n\r\n{p. 431}\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                THE EARTH STRUCK BY COMETS MANY TIMES.\r\n\r\nIF the reader is satisfied, from my reasoning and the facts I have\r\nadduced, that the so-called Glacial Age really represents a collision\r\nof the earth with one of these wandering luminaries of space, the\r\nquestion can not but occur to him, Was this the first and only\r\noccasion, during all the thousands of millions of years that our\r\nplanet has been revolving on its axis and circling around the sun,\r\nthat such a catastrophe has occurred?\r\n\r\nThe answer must be in the negative.\r\n\r\nWe find that all through the rocky record of our globe the same\r\nphenomena which we have learned to recognize as peculiar to the Drift\r\nAge are, at distant intervals, repeated.\r\n\r\nThe long ages of the Palæozoic Time passed with few or no\r\ndisturbances. The movements of the earth's crust oscillated at a rate\r\nnot to exceed one foot in a century.[1] It was an age of peace. Then\r\ncame a tremendous convulsion. It has been styled by the geologists\r\n\"the epoch of the Appalachian revolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strata were upraised and flexed into great (olds, some of the folds\r\na score or more of miles in span.

Its rocks were melted--not merely decomposed,\r\nas in the Drift Age,--but actually melted and metamorphosed; the\r\nheat, as in the Drift Age, sucked up the waters of the seas, to cast\r\nthem down again in great floods; it wiped out nearly all the life of\r\nthe planet, even as the Drift Age exterminated the great mammals;\r\nwhatever drift then fell probably melted with the burning rocks.\r\n\r\nHere are phenomena which no ice-sheet, though it were a thousand\r\nmiles thick, can explain; here is heat, not ice; combustion, not\r\ncold; and yet all these phenomena are but the results which we have\r\nseen would naturally follow the contact of the earth with a comet.\r\n\r\nBut while, in this particular case, the size of the comet, or its\r\nmore fiery nature, melted the surface of the globe, and changed the\r\nvery texture of the solid rocks, we find in the geological record the\r\nevidences of repeated visitations when Drift was thrown upon the\r\nearth in great quantities; but the heat, as in the last Drift Age,\r\nwas not great enough to consume all things.\r\n\r\nIn the Cambrian formation, conglomerates are found, combinations of\r\nstones and hardened clay, very much like the true \"till.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Silurian of the south of Scotland, large blocks and\r\nbowlders (from one foot to five feet in diameter)\r\n\r\n[1. Dana's \"Text-Book,\" p. 156.]\r\n\r\n{p. 434}\r\n\r\nare found, \"of gneiss, syenite, granite, etc., none of which belong\r\nto the rocks of that neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\nGeikie says:\r\n\r\n\"Possibly these bowlders may have come from some ancient Atlantis,\r\ntransported by ice.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe conglomerates belonging to the Old Red Sandstone formation in the\r\nnorth of England and in Scotland, we are told, \"closely resemble a\r\nconsolidated bowlder drift.\"[2]\r\n\r\nNear Victoria, in Australia, a conglomerate was found _nearly one\r\nhundred feet in thickness_.\r\n\r\n\"Great beds of conglomerate occur at the bottom of the Carboniferous,\r\nin various parts of Scotland, which it is difficult to believe are\r\nother than ancient morainic _débris_. They are frequently quite\r\nunstratified, and the stones _often show that peculiar blunted form\r\nwhich is so characteristic of glacial work_.\"[3]\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsay found well-scratched and blunted stones in a Permian\r\nconglomerate.\r\n\r\nIn the north of Scotland, a coarse, bowlder-conglomerate is\r\nassociated with the Jurassic strata. The Cretaceous formation has\r\nyielded great stones and bowlders. In the Eocene of Switzerland,\r\nerratics have been found, some angular and some rounded. They often\r\nattain great size; one measured one hundred and five feet in length,\r\nninety feet in breadth, and forty-five feet in height. Some of the\r\nblocks consist of _a kind of granite not known to occur anywhere in\r\nthe Alps_.\r\n\r\nGeikie says:\r\n\r\n\"The occurrence in the Eocene of huge ice-carried blocks seems\r\n_incomprehensible_ when the general character of the Eocene fossils\r\nis taken into account, for these have a somewhat _tropical_ aspect.\r\nSo, likewise, the appearance of ice-transported blocks in the Miocene\r\nis a _sore puzzle_,\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 478.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 479.\r\n\r\n3. Ibid.]\r\n\r\n{p. 435}\r\n\r\nas the fossils imbedded in this formation speak to us of tropical and\r\nsub-tropical climates having prevailed in Central Europe.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIt was precisely during the age when a warm climate prevailed in\r\nSpitzbergen and North Greenland that these erratics were dropped down\r\non the plains of Italy!\r\n\r\nAnd, strange to say, just as we have found the Drift-deposits of\r\nEurope and America unfossiliferous,--that is to say, containing no\r\ntraces of animal or vegetable life,--so these strange stone and clay\r\ndeposits of other and more ancient ages were in like manner\r\nunfossiliferous.[2]\r\n\r\nIn the \"flysch\" of the Eocene of the Alps, few or no fossils have\r\nbeen found. In the conglomerates of Turin, belonging to the Upper\r\nMiocene period, not a single organic remain has been found.\r\n\r\nWhat conclusion is forced upon us?\r\n\r\nThat, written in the rocky pages of the great volume of the planet,\r\nare the records of _repeated visitations from the comets_ which then\r\nrushed through the heavens.\r\n\r\nNo trace is left of their destructive powers, save the huge,\r\nunstratified, unfossiliferous deposits of clay and stones and\r\nbowlders, locked away between great layers of the sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nCan it be that there wanders through immeasurable space, upon an\r\norbit of such size that millions of years are required to complete\r\nit, some monstrous luminary, so vast that when it returns to us it\r\nfills a large part of the orbit which the earth describes around the\r\nsun, and showers down upon us deluges of _débris_, while it fills the\r\nworld with flame? And are these recurring strata of stones and clay\r\nand bowlders, written upon these widely separated pages of the\r\ngeologic volume, the record of its oft and regularly recurring\r\nvisitations?\r\n\r\n[1. \"The Great Ice Age,\" p. 480.\r\n\r\n2. Ibid., p. 481.]\r\n\r\n{p. 436}\r\n\r\nWho shall say? Science will yet compare minutely the composition of\r\nthese different conglomerates. No secret can escape discovery when\r\nthe light of a world's intelligence is brought to bear upon it.\r\n\r\nAnd even here we stumble over a still more tremendous fact:\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the primeval granite was the molten crust\r\nof the original glowing ball of the earth, when it first hardened as\r\nit cooled.\r\n\r\nBut, lo! the microscope, (so Professor Whichell tells us,) reveals\r\nthat this very granite, this foundation of all our rocks, this\r\nancient globe-crust, is itself made up of sedimentary rocks, which\r\nwere melted, fused, and run together in some awful conflagration\r\nwhich wiped out all life on the planet.\r\n\r\nBeyond the granite, then, there were seas and shores, winds and\r\nrains, rivers and sediment carried into the waters to form the rocks\r\nmelted up in this granite; there were countless ages; possibly there\r\nwere animals and man; but all melted and consumed together. Was this,\r\ntoo, the result of a comet visitation?\r\n\r\nWho shall tell the age of this old earth? Who shall count the ebbs\r\nand flows of eternity? Who shall say how often this planet has been\r\ndeveloped up to the highest forms of life, and how often all this has\r\nbeen obliterated in universal fire?\r\n\r\nThe earth is one great tomb of life:\r\n\r\n             \"All that tread\r\n     The globe are but a handful to the tribes\r\n     That slumber in its bosom.\"\r\n\r\nIn endless series the ages stretch along--birth, life, development,\r\ndestruction. And so shall it be till time is no more.\r\n\r\n{p. 437}\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                            THE AFTER-WORD.\r\n\r\nWHEN that magnificent genius, Francis Bacon, sent forth one of his\r\ngreat works to the world, he wrote this prayer:\r\n\r\n\"Thou, O Father, who gavest the visible light as the first-born of\r\nthy creatures, and didst pour into man the intellectual light as the\r\ntop and consummation of thy workmanship, be pleased to protect and\r\ngovern this work, which coming from thy goodness returneth to thy\r\nglory. . . . We humbly beg that this mind may be steadfastly in us;\r\nand that thou, by our hands and the hands of others, on whom thou\r\nshalt bestow the same spirit, wilt please to convey a largess of new\r\nalms to thy family of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he says:\r\n\r\n\"This also we beg, that human things may not prejudice such as are\r\ndivine; neither that from the unlocking of the gates of sense, and\r\nthe kindling of a greater natural light, anything of incredulity, or\r\nintellectual night, may arise in our minds toward divine mysteries.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit, but humbly halting afar after this illustrious\r\nman, I should be sorry to permit this book to go out to the world\r\nwithout a word to remove the impression which some who read it, and\r\nmay believe it, may form, that such a vast catastrophe as I have\r\ndepicted militates against the idea that God rules and cares for his\r\nworld and his creatures. It will be asked, If \"there is a special\r\nprovidence even in the fall of a sparrow,\" how\r\n\r\n{p. 438}\r\n\r\ncould He have permitted such a calamity as this to overtake a\r\nbeautiful, populous, and perhaps civilized world?\r\n\r\nHere we fall again upon the great debate of Job, and we may answer in\r\nthe words which the author of that book puts into the mouth of God\r\nhimself, when from out the whirlwind he answered him:\r\n\r\n\"Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him \"He that\r\nreproveth God, let him answer.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, Who and what is man to penetrate the counsels and\r\npurposes of the Creator; and who are you, Job?--\r\n\r\n\"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare\r\nit, if thou hast understanding.\r\n\r\n\"Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who has\r\nstretched the line upon it?\r\n\r\n\"Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the\r\ncorner-stone thereof?\r\n\r\n\"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God\r\nshouted for joy.\"\r\n\r\nConsider, Job, the littleness of man, the greatness of the universe;\r\nand what right have you to ask Him, who made all this, the reasons\r\nfor his actions?\r\n\r\nAnd this is a sufficient answer: A creature seventy inches long\r\nprying into the purposes of an Awful Something, whose power ranges so\r\nfar that blazing suns are seen only as mist-specks!\r\n\r\nBut I may make another answer:\r\n\r\nAlthough it seems that many times have comets smitten the earth,\r\ncovering it with _débris_, or causing its rocks to boil, and its\r\nwaters to ascend into the heavens, yet, considering all life, as\r\nrevealed in the fossils, from the first cells unto this day, _nothing\r\nhas perished that was worth preserving_.\r\n\r\n{p. 439}\r\n\r\nSo far as we can judge, after every cataclysm the world has risen to\r\nhigher levels of creative development.\r\n\r\nIf I am right, despite these incalculable tons of matter piled on the\r\nearth, despite heat and cyclones and darkness and ice and floods, not\r\neven a tender tropical plant fit to adorn or sustain man's life was\r\nblotted out; not an animal valuable for domestication was\r\nexterminated; and not even the great inventions which man had\r\nattained to, during the Tertiary Age, were lost. Nothing died but\r\nthat which stood in the pathway of man's development,--the monstrous\r\nanimals, the Neanderthal races, the half-human creatures intermediate\r\nbetween man and the brute. The great centers of human activity to-day\r\nin Europe and America are upon the Drift-deposits; the richest soils\r\nare compounded of the so-called glacial clays. Doubtless, too, the\r\nhuman brain was forced during the Drift Age to higher reaches of\r\ndevelopment under the terrible ordeals of the hour.\r\n\r\nSurely, then, we can afford to leave God's planets in God's hands.\r\nNot a particle of dust is whirled in the funnel of the cyclone but\r\nGod identifies it, and has marked its path.\r\n\r\nIf we fall again upon\r\n\r\n     \"Axe-ages, sword-ages,\r\n     Wind-ages, murder-ages--\r\n\r\nif \"sensual sins grow huge\"; if \"brother spoils brother\" if Sodom and\r\nGomorrah come again--who can say that God may not bring out of the\r\ndepths of space a rejuvenating comet?\r\n\r\nBe assured of one thing--this world tends now to a deification of\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nDives says: \"The earth is firm under my feet; I own my possessions\r\ndown to the center of the earth and up to\r\n\r\n{p. 440}\r\n\r\nthe heavens. If fire sweeps away my houses, the insurance company\r\nreimburses me; if mobs destroy them, the government pays me; if civil\r\nwar comes, I can convert them into bonds and move away until the\r\nstorm is over; if sickness comes, I have the highest skill at my call\r\nto fight it back; if death comes, I am again insured, and my estate\r\nmakes money by the transaction; and if there is another world than\r\nthis, still am I insured: I have taken out a policy in the -----\r\nchurch, and pay my premiums semiannually to the minister.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Dives has an unexpressed belief that heaven is only a larger Wall\r\nStreet, where the millionaires occupy the front benches, while those\r\nwho never had a bank account on earth sing in the chorus.\r\n\r\nSpeak to Dives of lifting up the plane of all the underfed,\r\nunder-paid, benighted millions of the earth--his fellow-men--to\r\nhigher levels of comfort, and joy, and intelligence--not tearing down\r\nany but building up all--and Dives can not understand you.\r\n\r\nAh, Dives! consider, if there is no other life than this, the fate of\r\nthese uncounted millions of your race! What does existence give to\r\nthem? What do they get out of all this abundant and beautiful world?\r\n\r\nTo look down the vista of such a life as theirs is like gazing into\r\none of the corridors of the Catacombs: an alley filled with reeking\r\nbones of dead men; while from the cross-arches, waiting for the poor\r\nman's coming on, ghastly shapes look out:--sickness and want and sin\r\nand grim despair and red-eyed suicide.\r\n\r\nPut yourself in his place, Dives, locked up in such a cavern as that,\r\nand the key thrown away!\r\n\r\nDo not count too much, Dives, on your lands and houses and\r\nparchments; your guns and cannon and laws; your insurance companies\r\nand your governments. There\r\n\r\n{p. 441}\r\n\r\nmay be even now one coming from beyond Arcturus, or Aldebaran, or\r\nComa Berenices, with glowing countenance and horrid hair, and\r\nmillions of tons of _débris_, to overwhelm you and your possessions,\r\nand your corporations, and all the ant-like devices of man in one\r\ncommon ruin.\r\n\r\nBuild a little broader, Dives. Establish spiritual relations. Matter\r\nis not everything. You do not deal in certainties. You are but a\r\nvitalized speck, filled with a fraction of God's delegated\r\nintelligence, crawling over an egg-shell filled with fire, whirling\r\nmadly through infinite space, a target for the bombs of a universe.\r\n\r\nTake your mind off your bricks and mortar, and put out your tentacles\r\ntoward the great spiritual world around you. Open communications with\r\nGod. You can not help God. For Him who made the Milky Way you can do\r\nnothing. But here are his creatures. Not a nerve, muscle, or\r\nbrain-convolution of the humblest of these but duplicates your own;\r\nyou excel them simply in the coordination of certain inherited\r\nfaculties which have given you success. Widen your heart. Put your\r\nintellect to work to so readjust the values of labor, and increase\r\nthe productive capacity of Nature, that plenty and happiness, light\r\nand hope, may dwell in every heart, and the Catacombs be closed for\r\never.\r\n\r\nAnd from such a world God will fend off the comets with his great\r\nright arm, and the angels will exult over it in heaven.\r\n\r\n              End of Ragnarok: The Age of Fire and Gravel",
