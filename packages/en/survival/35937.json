There was a greater light to rule the day;\r\na lesser light to rule the night; and there were the stars also.\r\n\r\nIn those days there seemed an immense difference between the earth upon\r\nwhich men stood, and the bright objects that shone down upon it from the\r\nheavens above. The earth seemed to be vast, dark, and motionless; the\r\ncelestial lights seemed to be small, and moved, and shone. The earth was\r\nthen regarded as the fixed centre of the universe, but the Copernican\r\ntheory has since deprived it of this pride of place. Yet from another\r\npoint of view the new conception of its position involves a promotion,\r\nsince the earth itself is now regarded as a heavenly body of the same\r\norder as some of those which shine down upon us. It is amongst them, and\r\nit too moves and shines--shines, as some of them do, by reflecting the\r\nlight of the sun. Could we transport ourselves to a neighbouring world,\r\nthe earth would seem a star, not distinguishable in kind from the rest.\r\n\r\nBut as men realized this, they began to ask: \"Since this world from a\r\ndistant standpoint must appear as a star, would not a star, if we could\r\nget near enough to it, show itself also as a world? This world teems with\r\nlife; above all, it is the home of human life. Men and women, gifted with\r\nfeeling, intelligence, and character, look upward from its surface and\r\nwatch the shining members of the heavenly host. Are none of these the home\r\nof beings gifted with like powers, who watch in their turn the movements\r\nof that shining point which is our world?\"\r\n\r\nThis is the meaning of the controversy on the Plurality of Worlds which\r\nexcited so much interest some sixty years ago, and has been with us more\r\nor less ever since. It is the desire to recognize the presence in the orbs\r\naround us of beings like ourselves, possessed of personality and\r\nintelligence, lodged in an organic body.\r\n\r\nThis is what is meant when we speak of a world being \"inhabited.\" It would\r\nnot, for example, at all content us if we could ascertain that Jupiter was\r\ncovered by a shoreless ocean, rich in every variety of fish; or that the\r\nhard rocks of the Moon were delicately veiled by lichens. Just as no\r\nrichness of vegetation and no fulness and complexity of animal life would\r\njustify an explorer in describing some land that he had discovered as\r\nbeing \"inhabited\" if no men were there, so we cannot rightly speak of any\r\nother world as being \"inhabited\" if it is not the home of intelligent\r\nlife. If the life did not rise above the level of algae or oysters, the\r\nglobe on which they flourish would be uninhabited in our estimation, and\r\nits chief interest would lie in the possibility that in the course of ages\r\nlife might change its forms and develop hereafter into manifestations with\r\nwhich we could claim a nearer kinship.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, of necessity we are precluded from extending our\r\nenquiry to the case of disembodied intelligences, if such be conceived\r\npossible. All created existences must be conditioned, but if we have no\r\nknowledge of what those conditions may be, or means for attaining such\r\nknowledge, we cannot discuss them. Nothing can be affirmed, nothing\r\ndenied, concerning the possibility of intelligences existing on the Moon\r\nor even in the Sun if we are unable to ascertain under what limitations\r\nthose particular intelligences subsist. Gnomes, sylphs, elves, and\r\nfairies, and all similar conceptions, escape the possibility of discussion\r\nby our ignorance of their properties. As nothing can be asserted of them\r\nthey remain beyond investigation, as they are beyond sight and touch.\r\n\r\nThe only beings, then, the presence of which would justify us in regarding\r\nanother world as \"inhabited\" are such as would justify us in applying that\r\nterm to a part of our own world. They must possess intelligence and\r\nconsciousness on the one hand; on the other, they must likewise have\r\ncorporeal form. True, the form might be imagined as different from that we\r\npossess; but, as with ourselves, the intelligent spirit must be lodged in\r\nand expressed by a living material body. Our enquiry is thus rendered a\r\nphysical one; it is the necessities of the living body that must guide us\r\nin it; a world unsuited for living organisms is not, in the sense of this\r\nenquiry, a \"habitable\" world.\r\n\r\nThe discussion, as it was carried on sixty years ago by Dr. Whewell and\r\nSir David Brewster, was essentially a metaphysical, almost a theological\r\none, and it was chiefly considered in its supposed relationship to certain\r\nreligious conceptions. It was urged that it was derogatory to the wisdom\r\nand goodness of the Creator to suppose that He would have created so many\r\ngreat and glorious orbs without having a definite purpose in so doing, and\r\nthat the only purpose for which a world could be made was that it might be\r\ninhabited. So, again, when Dr. A. R. Wallace revived the discussion in\r\n1903, he clearly had a theological purpose in his opening paper, though he\r\nwas taking the opposite view from that held by Brewster half a century\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nFor myself, if there be any theological significance attaching to the\r\nsolving of this problem, I do not know what it is. If we decide that there\r\nare very many inhabited worlds, or that there are few, or that there is\r\nbut one--our own--I fail to see how it should modify our religious\r\nbeliefs. For example: explorers have made their way across the Antarctic\r\ncontinent to the South Pole but have found no \"inhabitant\" there. Has this\r\nfact any theological bearing? or if, on the contrary, a race of men had\r\nbeen discovered there, what change would it have made in the theological\r\nposition of anyone? And if this be so with regard to a new continent on\r\nthis earth, why should it be different with regard to the continents of\r\nanother planet?\r\n\r\nThe problem therefore seems not to be theological or metaphysical, but\r\npurely physical. We have simply to ask with regard to each heavenly body\r\nwhich we pass in review: \"Are its physical conditions, so far as we can\r\nascertain them, such as would render the maintenance of life possible upon\r\nit?\" The question is not at all as to how life is generated on a world,\r\nbut as to whether, if once in action on a particular world, its activities\r\ncould be carried on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE LIVING ORGANISM\r\n\r\n\r\nA world for habitation, then, is a world whereon living organisms can\r\nexist that are comparable in intelligence with men. But \"men\" presuppose\r\nthe existence of living organisms of inferior grades. Therefore a world\r\nfor habitation must first of all be one upon which it is possible for\r\nliving organisms, as such, to exist.\r\n\r\nIt does not concern us in the present connection how life first came into\r\nexistence on this planet. It is sufficient that we know from experience\r\nthat life does exist here; and in whatsoever way it was first generated\r\nhere, in that same way we may consider that it could have been generated\r\non another planet.\r\n\r\nNor need any question trouble us as to the precise line of demarkation to\r\nbe drawn between inorganic and organic substances, or amongst the latter,\r\nbetween plants and animals. These are important subjects for discussion,\r\nbut they do not affect us here, for we are essentially concerned with the\r\nhighest form of organism, the one furthest from these two dividing lines.\r\n\r\nIt suffices that living organisms do exist here, and exist under\r\nwell-defined conditions. Wanting these conditions, they perish. We can, to\r\na varying degree, determine the physical conditions prevailing upon the\r\nheavenly bodies, and we can ascertain whether these physical conditions\r\nwould be favourable, unfavourable, or fatal to the living organism.\r\n\r\nWhat is a living organism? A living organism is such that, though it is\r\ncontinually changing its substance, its identity, as a whole, remains\r\nessentially the same. This definition is incomplete, but it gives us a\r\nfirst essential approximation, it indicates the continuance of the whole,\r\nwith the unceasing change of the details. Were this definition complete, a\r\nriver would furnish us with a perfect example of a living organism,\r\nbecause, while the river remains, the individual drops of water are\r\ncontinually changing. There is then something more in the living organism\r\nthan the continuity of the whole, with the change of the details.\r\n\r\nAn analogy, given by Max Verworn, carries us a step further. He likens\r\nlife to a flame, and takes a gas flame with its butterfly shape as a\r\nparticularly appropriate illustration. Here the shape of the flame remains\r\nconstant, even in its details. Immediately above the burner, at the base\r\nof the flame, there is a completely dark space; surrounding this, a bluish\r\nzone that is faintly luminous; and beyond this again, the broad spread of\r\nthe two wings that are brightly luminous. The flame, like the river,\r\npreserves its identity of form, while its constituent details--the gases\r\nthat feed it--are in continual change. But there is not only a change of\r\nmaterial in the flame; there is a change of condition. Everywhere the gas\r\nfrom the burner is entering into energetic combination with the oxygen of\r\nthe air, with evolution of light and heat. There is change in the\r\nconstituent particles as well as change of the constituent particles;\r\nthere is more than the mere flux of material through the form; there is\r\nchange of the material, and in the process of that change energy is\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nA steam-engine may afford us a third illustration. Here fresh material is\r\ncontinually being introduced into the engine there to suffer change. Part\r\nis supplied as fuel to the fire there to maintain the temperature of the\r\nengine; so far the illustration is analogous to that of the gas flame. But\r\nthe engine carries us a step further, for part of the material supplied to\r\nit is water, which is converted into steam by the heat of the fire, and\r\nfrom the expansion of the steam the energy sought from the machine is\r\nderived. Here again we have change in the material with development of\r\nenergy; but there is not only work done in the subject, there is work done\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nBut the living organism differs from artificial machines in that, of\r\nitself and by itself, it is continuously drawing into itself non-living\r\nmatter, converting it into an integral part of the organism, and so\r\nendowing it with the qualities of life. And from this non-living matter it\r\nderives fresh energy for the carrying on of the life of the organism.\r\n\r\nThe engine and the butterfly gas flame do not give us, any more than the\r\nriver, a complete picture of the living organism. The form of the river is\r\nimposed upon it from without; the river is defined by its bed, by the\r\ncontour of the country through which it flows. The form and size of the\r\nflame are equally defined by exterior conditions; they are imposed upon it\r\nby the shape of the burner and the pressure of the gas passing through it.\r\nThe form of the engine is as its designer has made it. But the form of the\r\nliving organism is imposed upon it from within; and, as far as we can\r\ntell, is inherent in it. Here is the wonder and mystery of life: the power\r\nof the living organism to assimilate dead matter, to give it life and\r\nbring it into the law and unity of the organism itself. But it cannot do\r\nthis indiscriminately; it is not able thus to convert every dead material;\r\nit is restricted, narrowly restricted, in its action. \"One of the chief\r\ncharacteristics of living matter is found in the continuous range of\r\nchemical reactions which take place between living cells and their\r\ninorganic surroundings. Without cease certain substances are taken up and\r\ndisappear in the endless round of chemical reactions in the cell. Other\r\nsubstances which have been produced by the chemical reactions in living\r\nmatter pass out of the cell and reappear in inorganic nature as waste\r\nproducts of the life process. The whole complex of these chemical\r\ntransformations is generally called _Metabolism_. Inorganic matter\r\ncontrasts strikingly with living substance. However long a crystal or a\r\npiece of metal is kept in observation, there is no change of the\r\nsubstance, and the molecules remain the same and in the same number. For\r\nliving matter the continuous change of substances is an indispensable\r\ncondition of existence. To stop the supply of food material for a certain\r\ntime is sufficient to cause a serious lesion of the life process or even\r\nthe death of the cell. But the same happens when we hinder the passing out\r\nof the products of chemical transformation from the cell. On the other\r\nhand, we may keep a crystal of lifeless matter in a glass tube carefully\r\nshut up from all exchange of substance with the external world for as many\r\nyears as we like. The existence of this crystal will continue without end\r\nand without change of any of its properties. There is no known living\r\norganism which could remain in a dry resting state for an infinitely long\r\nperiod of time. The longest lived are perhaps the spores of mosses which\r\ncan exist in a dry state more than a hundred years. As a rule the seeds of\r\nhigher plants show their vital power already weakened after ten years;\r\nmost of them do not germinate if kept more than twenty to thirty years.\r\nThese experiences lead to the opinion that even dry seeds and spores of\r\nlower plants in their period of rest of vegetation continue the processes\r\nof metabolism to a certain degree. This supposition is confirmed by the\r\nfact that a very slight respiration and production of carbonic acid can be\r\nproved when the seeds contain a small percentage of water. It seems as if\r\nlife were weakened in these plant organs to a quite imperceptible degree,\r\nbut never, not even temporarily, really suspended.\r\n\r\n\"Life is, therefore, quite inseparable from chemical reactions, and on the\r\nwhole what we call life is nothing else but a complex of innumerable\r\nchemical reactions in the living substance which we call protoplasm.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe essential quality, therefore, of life is continual change, but not\r\nmere change in general. It is that special process of the circulation of\r\nmatter which we call metabolism, and this circulation is always connected\r\nwith a particular chemical substance--protoplasm.\r\n\r\nIn this substance five elements are always present and\r\npredominant--carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulphur. The\r\ncompounds which these five elements form with each other are most complex\r\nand varied, and they also admit to combination--but in smaller\r\nproportions--some of the other elements, of which phosphorus, potassium,\r\ncalcium, magnesium, and iron are the most important.\r\n\r\nFor protoplasm--using the term in the most general sense--is a chemical\r\nsubstance, not a mere mixture of a number of chemical elements, nor a mere\r\nmechanical structure. \"However differently the various plasma substances\r\nbehave in detail, they always exhibit the same general composition as the\r\nother albuminoids out of the five 'organo-genetic elements'--namely in\r\npoint of weight, 51-54% carbon, 21-23% oxygen, 15-17% nitrogen, 6-7%\r\nhydrogen, and 1-2% sulphur.\"[2]\r\n\r\nHaeckel, the writer just quoted, describes the plasm, the universal basis\r\nof all the vital phenomena, in the following terms: \"In every case where\r\nwe have with great difficulty succeeded in examining the plasm as far as\r\npossible and separating it from the plasma-products, it has the appearance\r\nof a colourless, viscous substance, the chief physical property of which\r\nis its peculiar thickness and consistency. The physicist distinguishes\r\nthree conditions of inorganic matter--solid, fluid, and gaseous. Active\r\nliving protoplasm cannot be strictly described as either fluid or solid in\r\nthe physical sense. It presents an intermediate stage between the two\r\nwhich is best described as viscous; it is best compared to a cold jelly,\r\nor solution of glue. Just as we find the latter substance in all stages\r\nbetween the solid and the fluid, so we find in the case of protoplasm. The\r\ncause of this softness is the quantity of water contained in the living\r\nmatter, which generally amounts to a half of its volume and weight. The\r\nwater is distributed between the plasma molecules or the ultimate\r\nparticles of living matter in much the same way as it is in the crystals\r\nof salts, but with the important difference that it is very variable in\r\nquantity in the plasm. On this depends the capacity for the absorption or\r\nimbibition in the plasm, and the mobility of its molecules, which is very\r\nimportant for the performance of the vital actions. However, this capacity\r\nof absorption has definite limits in each variety of plasm; living plasm\r\nis not soluble in water, but absolutely resists the penetration of any\r\nwater beyond this limit.\"[3] And Czapek further tells us that \"the most\r\nstriking feature of cell life is the fact that an enormous number of\r\nchemical reactions take place within the narrowest space. Most plant cells\r\ndo not exceed 0.1 to 0.5 millimetres in diameter. Their greatest volume\r\ntherefore can only be an eighth of a cubic millimetre. Nevertheless, in\r\nthis minute space we notice in every stage of cell life a considerable\r\nnumber of chemical reactions which are carried on contemporaneously,\r\nwithout one disturbing the other in the slightest degree.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIt is clear if organic bodies were built up of chemical compounds of small\r\ncomplexity and great stability that this continuous range of chemical\r\nreactions, this unceasing metabolism, could not take place. It is\r\ntherefore a necessary condition for organic substances that they should be\r\nbuilt up of chemical compounds that are most complex and unstable.\r\n\"Exactly those substances which are most important for life possess a very\r\nhigh molecular weight, and consequently very large molecules, in\r\ncomparison with inorganic matter. For example: egg-albumin is said to have\r\nthe molecular weight of at least 15,000, starch more than 30,000, whilst\r\nthe molecular weight of hydrogen is 2, of sulphuric acid and of potassium\r\nnitrate about 100, and the molecular weight of the heaviest metal salts\r\ndoes not exceed about 300.\"[5]\r\n\r\nTo sum up: the living organism, whether it be a simple cell, or the\r\nordered community of cells making up the perfect plant or animal, is an\r\nentity, a living individual, wherein highly complex and unstable compounds\r\nare unceasingly undergoing chemical reactions, a metabolism essentially\r\nassociated with protoplasm. But these complex compounds are, nevertheless,\r\nformed by the combinations of but a few of the elements now known to us.\r\n\r\nMany writers on the subject of the habitability of other worlds, from\r\ncontemplating the rich and apparently limitless variety of the forms of\r\nlife, and the diversity of the conditions under which they exist, have\r\nbeen led to assume that the basis of life must itself also in like manner\r\nbe infinitely broad and infinitely varied. In this they are mistaken. As\r\nwe have seen, the elements entering into the composition of organic bodies\r\nare, in the main, few in number. The temperatures at which they can exist\r\nare likewise strictly limited. But, above all, that circulation of matter\r\nwhich we call Life--the metabolism of vital processes--requires for its\r\ncontinuance the presence of one indispensable factor--WATER.\r\n\r\nProtoplasm itself, as Czapek puts it, is practically an _albumin sol_;\r\nthat is to say, it is a chemical substance of which the chief constituents\r\nare albuminous matter and water, and the protoplasm can only take from\r\nwithout material dissolved in water; it can only eject matter in the same\r\nway. This _osmosis_ is an indispensable condition in the vital process.\r\nAnd the \"streaming\" of protoplasm, its continual movement in the cell, can\r\nonly be carried on in water.\r\n\r\nWATER is the compound of oxygen and hydrogen in the proportion of two\r\natoms of hydrogen to one of oxygen. It is familiar to us in three states:\r\nsolid, liquid, and gaseous, or ice, water, and steam. But it is only in\r\nthe liquid state that water is available for carrying on the processes of\r\nlife. This fact limits the temperatures at which the organic functions can\r\nbe carried on, for water under terrestrial conditions is only liquid for a\r\nhundred degrees; it freezes at 0 deg. Centigrade, it boils at 100 deg. Centigrade.\r\nNecessarily, our experiences are mostly confined within this range, and\r\ntherefore we are apt unconsciously to assume that this range is all the\r\nrange that is possible, whereas it is but a very small fraction of the\r\nrange conceivable, and indeed existing, in cosmical space. In its liquid\r\nstate water is a general solvent, and yet pure water is neutral in its\r\nqualities, both characteristics being essential to its usefulness as a\r\nvehicle for the protoplasmic actions. Naturally, this function of water as\r\na solvent can only exist when water is in the liquid state; solid water,\r\nthat is ice, neither dissolves nor flows; and water, when heated to\r\nboiling point, passes into vapour, and so leaves the organism\r\nmoistureless, and therefore dead. It is possible to grind a living\r\norganism to a pulp so that the structure of the cells is practically\r\ndestroyed, and yet for some reactions which are quite peculiar to life\r\nstill to show themselves for some appreciable time. But when the cell-pulp\r\nis heated to the temperature of boiling water, these chemical processes\r\ncannot be longer observed. What is left may then be considered as\r\ndefinitely dead.\r\n\r\nWater is, then, indispensable for the living organism; but there are two\r\ngreat divisions of such organisms--plants and animals. Animals are\r\ngenerally, but not universally, free to move, and therefore to travel to\r\nseek their food. But their food is restricted; they cannot directly\r\nconvert inorganic matter to their own use; they can only assimilate\r\norganic material. The plant, on the other hand, unlike the animal, can\r\nmake use of inorganic material. Plant life, therefore, requires an\r\nabundant supply of water in which the various substances necessary for its\r\nsupport can be dissolved; it must either be in water, or, if on land,\r\nthere must be an active circulation of water both through the atmosphere\r\nand through the soil, so as to bring to it the food that it requires.\r\nAnimal life presupposes plant life, for it is always dependent upon it.\r\n\r\nMany writers have assumed that life is very widely distributed in\r\nconnection with this planet. The assumption is a mistaken one, as has been\r\nwell pointed out by Garrett P. Serviss, a charming writer on astronomical\r\nsubjects: \"On the Earth we find animated existence confined to the surface\r\nof the crust of the globe, to the lower and denser strata of the\r\natmosphere, and to the film of water that constitutes the oceans. It does\r\nnot exist in the heart of the rocks forming the body of the planet nor in\r\nthe void of space surrounding it outside the atmosphere. As the Earth\r\ncondensed from the original nebula, and cooled and solidified, a certain\r\nquantity of matter remained at its surface in the form of free gases and\r\nunstable compounds, and, within the narrow precincts where these things\r\nwere, lying like a thin shell between the huge inert globe of permanently\r\ncombined elements below, and the equally unchanging realm of the ether\r\nabove, life, a phenomenon depending upon ceaseless changes, combinations\r\nand re-combinations of chemical elements in unstable and temporary union,\r\nmade its appearance, and there only we find it at the present time.\"[6]\r\n\r\n\"The huge inert globe of permanently combined elements below, and the\r\nequally unchanging realm of the ether above,\" offer no home for the living\r\norganism; least of all for the highest of such organisms--Man. Both must\r\nbe tempered to a condition which will permit and favour continual change,\r\nthe metabolism which is the essential feature of life.\r\n\r\n\"When the earth had to be prepared for the habitation of man, a veil, as\r\nit were, of intermediate being was spread between him and its darkness, in\r\nwhich were joined, in a subdued measure, the stability and the\r\ninsensibility of the earth, and the passion and perishing of mankind.\r\n\r\n\"But the heavens, also, had to be prepared for his habitation. Between\r\ntheir burning light,--their deep vacuity, and man, as between the earth's\r\ngloom of iron substance, and man, a veil had to be spread of intermediate\r\nbeing;--which should appease the unendurable glory to the level of human\r\nfeebleness, and sign the changeless motion of the heavens with the\r\nsemblance of human vicissitude. Between the earth and man arose the leaf.\r\nBetween the heaven and man came the cloud. His life being partly as the\r\nfalling leaf and partly as the flying vapour.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe leaf and the cloud are the signs of a habitable world. The leaf--that\r\nis to say, plant life, vegetation--is necessary because animal life is not\r\ncapable of building itself up from inorganic material. This step must have\r\nbeen previously taken by the plant. The cloud, that is to say\r\nwater-vapour, is necessary because the plant in its turn cannot directly\r\nassimilate to itself the nitrogen from the atmosphere. The food for the\r\nplant is brought to it by water, and it assimilates it by the help of\r\nwater. It is, therefore, upon the question of the presence of water that\r\nthe question of the habitability of a given world chiefly turns. In the\r\nphysical sense, man is \"born of water,\" and any world fitted for his\r\nhabitation must \"stand out of the water and in the water.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sun is, of all the heavenly bodies, the most impressive, and has\r\nnecessarily, at all times, attracted the chief attention of men. There are\r\nonly two of the heavenly bodies that appear to be more than points of\r\nlight, only two that show a surface to the naked eye, and the Sun, being\r\nso much the brighter of the two, and the obvious source of all our light\r\nand heat, and the fosterer of vegetation, readily takes the premier place\r\nin interest. In the present day we know too much about the Sun for anyone\r\nto suppose that it can be the home of organic life; but it is not many\r\nyears since its habitability was seriously suggested even by so high an\r\nauthority as Sir William Herschel. He conceived that it was possible that\r\nits stores of light and heat might be confined to a relatively thin shell\r\nin its upper atmosphere, and that below this shell a screen of clouds\r\nmight so check radiation downward that it would be possible for an inner\r\nnucleus to exist which should be cool and solid. This fancied inner globe\r\nwould then necessarily enjoy perpetual daylight, and a climate which knew\r\nno variation from pole to pole. To its inhabitants the entire heavens\r\nwould be generally luminous, the light not being concentrated into any one\r\npart of the vault; and it was supposed that, ignorant of time, a happy\r\nrace might flourish, cultivating the far-spread solar fields, in perpetual\r\ndaylight, and in the serenity of a perpetual spring that was distracted by\r\nno storm.\r\n\r\nThe picture thus conjured up is a pleasing one, though probably, to the\r\nrestless sons of Earth, it would seem to suffer somewhat from monotony.\r\nBut we now know that it corresponds in not a single detail to the actual\r\nfacts. The study of solar conditions carried on through the last hundred\r\nyears has revealed to us, not serenity and peace, but storm, stress, and\r\ncommotion on the most gigantic scale. But though we now can dismiss from\r\nour minds the possibility that the Sun can be inhabited, yet it is of such\r\nimportance to the maintenance of life on this planet, and by parity of\r\nreasoning to life on any other planet, that a review of its conditions\r\nforms a necessary introduction to our subject. Further, those conditions\r\nthemselves will bring out certain principles that are of necessary\r\napplication when we come to consider the case of particular planets.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the Sun from the Earth is often spoken of as the\r\n\"astronomical unit\"; it is the fundamental measure of astronomy, and all\r\nour information as to the sizes and distances of the various planets rests\r\nupon it. And, as we shall shortly see, the particular problem with which\r\nwe are engaged--the habitability of worlds--is directly connected with\r\nthese two factors: the size of the world in question, and its distance\r\nfrom the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the Sun has been determined by several different methods\r\nthe principles of which do not concern us here, but they agree in giving\r\nthe mean distance of the Sun as a little less than 93,000,000 miles; that\r\nis to say, it would require 11,720 worlds as large as our own to be put\r\nside by side in order to bridge the chasm between the two. Or a traveller\r\ngoing round the Earth at its equator would have to repeat the journey 3730\r\ntimes before he had traversed a space equal to the Sun's distance.\r\n\r\nBut knowing the Sun's distance, we are able to deduce its actual diameter,\r\nits superficial extent, and its volume, for its apparent diameter can\r\nreadily be measured. Its actual diameter then comes out as 866,400 miles,\r\nor 109.4 times that of the Earth. Its surface exceeds that of the Earth\r\n11,970 times; its volume, 1,310,000 times.\r\n\r\nBut the weight of the Sun is known as well as its size; this follows as a\r\nconsequence of gravitation. For the planets move in orbits under the\r\ninfluence of the Sun's attraction; the dimensions of their orbits are\r\nknown, and the times taken in describing them; the amount of the\r\nattractive force therefore is also known, that is to say, the mass of the\r\nSun. This is 332,000 times the mass of the Earth; and as the latter has\r\nbeen determined as equal to about\r\n\r\n  6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons\r\n\r\nthat of the Sun would be equal to\r\n\r\n  2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the proportion of the volume of the Sun to that of\r\nthe Earth is greater than the proportion of its mass to the Earth's\r\nmass--almost exactly four times greater; so that the mean density of the\r\nSun can be only one-fourth that of the Earth. Yet, if we calculate the\r\nforce of gravity at the surfaces of both Sun and Earth, we find that the\r\nSun has a great preponderance. Its mass is 332,000 times that of the\r\nEarth, but to compare it with the attraction of the Earth's surface we\r\nmust divide by (109.4){2}, since the distance of the Sun's centre from its\r\nsurface is 109.4 times as great as the corresponding distance in the case\r\nof the Earth, and the force of gravity diminishes as the square of the\r\nincreased distance. This gives the force of gravity at the solar surface\r\nas 27.65 times its power at the surface of the Earth, so that a body\r\nweighing one ton here would weigh 27 tons 13 cwt. if it were taken to the\r\nSun.[8]\r\n\r\nThis relation is one of great importance when we realize that the pressure\r\nof the Earth's atmosphere is 14.7 lb. on the square inch at the sea\r\nlevel; that is to say, if we could take a column of air one square inch in\r\nsection, extending from the surface of the Earth upwards to the very limit\r\nof the atmosphere, we should find that it would have this weight. If we\r\nconstruct a water barometer, the column of water required to balance the\r\natmosphere must be 34 feet high, while the height of the column of mercury\r\nin a mercurial barometer is 30 inches high, for the weight of 30 cubic\r\ninches of mercury or of 408 cubic inches of water (34 x 12 = 408) is 14.7\r\nlb.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we ascend a mountain, carrying a mercurial barometer with us we\r\nshould find that it would fall about one inch for the first 900 feet of\r\nour ascent; that is to say, we should have left one-thirtieth of the\r\natmosphere below us by ascending 900 feet. As we went up higher we should\r\nfind that we should have to climb more than 900 feet further in order that\r\nthe barometer might fall another inch; and each successive inch, as we\r\nwent upward, would mean a longer climb. At the height of 2760 feet the\r\nbarometer would have fallen three inches; we should have passed through\r\none-tenth of the atmosphere. At the height of 5800 feet, we should have\r\npassed through one-fifth of the atmosphere, the barometer would have\r\ndropped six inches; and so on, until at about three and a third miles\r\nabove sea level the barometer would read fifteen inches, showing that we\r\nhad passed through half the atmosphere. Mont Blanc is not quite three\r\nmiles high, so that in Europe we cannot climb to the height where half the\r\natmosphere is left below us, and there is no terrestrial mountain anywhere\r\nwhich would enable us to double the climb; that is to say, to ascend six\r\nand two-third miles. Could we do so, however, we should find that the\r\nbarometer had fallen to seven and a half inches; that the second ascent of\r\nthree and a third miles had brought us through half the remaining\r\natmosphere, so that only one-fourth still remained above us. In the\r\ncelebrated balloon ascent made by Mr. Coxwell and Mr. Glaisher on\r\nSeptember 5, 1861, an even greater height was attained, and it was\r\nestimated that the barometer fell at its lowest reading to seven inches,\r\nwhich would correspond to a height of 39,000 feet.\r\n\r\nBut on the Sun, where the force of gravity is 27.65 times as great as at\r\nthe surface of the Earth, it would, if all the other conditions were\r\nsimilar, only be necessary to ascend one furlong, instead of three and a\r\nthird miles, in order to reach the level of half the surface pressure, and\r\nan ascent of two furlongs would bring us to the level of quarter pressure,\r\nand so on. If then the solar atmosphere extends inwards, below the\r\napparent surface, it should approximately double in density with each\r\nfurlong of descent. These considerations, if taken alone, would point to a\r\nmean density of the Sun not as we know it to be, less than that of the\r\nEarth, but immeasurably greater; but the discordance is sufficiently\r\nexplained when we come to another class of facts.\r\n\r\nThese relate to the temperature of the Sun, and to the enormous amount of\r\nlight and heat which it radiates forth continually. This entirely\r\ntranscends our power to understand or appreciate. Nevertheless, the\r\nastonishing figures which the best authorities give us may, by their\r\nvastness, convey some rough general impression that may be of service.\r\nThus Prof. C. A. Young puts the total quantity of sunlight as equivalent\r\nto\r\n\r\n  1,575,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 standard candles.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of sunlight at each point of the Sun's surface is variously\r\nexpressed as\r\n\r\n  190,000 times that of a standard candle,\r\n  5300 times that of the metal in a Bessemer converter,\r\n  146 times that of a calcium light,\r\n  or, 3.4 times that of an electric arc.\r\n\r\nThe same authority estimates at 30 _calories_ the value of the _Solar\r\nConstant_; that is to say, the heat which, if our atmosphere were removed,\r\nwould be received from the Sun in a minute of time upon a square metre of\r\nthe Earth's surface that had the Sun in its zenith, would be sufficient to\r\nraise the temperature of a kilogram of water 30 degrees Centigrade. This\r\nwould involve that the heat radiation from each square metre of the Sun's\r\nsurface would equal 1,340,000 calories; or sufficient to melt through in\r\neach minute of time a shell of ice surrounding the Sun to the thickness of\r\n58.2 feet. Prof. Abbot's most recent determination of the solar constant\r\ndiminishes these estimates by one third; but he still gives the probable\r\ntemperature of the solar surface as not far short of 7000 degrees\r\nCentigrade, or about 12,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe Sun, then, presents us with temperatures and pressures which entirely\r\nsurpass our experience on the Earth. The temperatures, on the one hand,\r\nare sufficient to convert into a permanent gas every substance with which\r\nwe are acquainted; the pressures, on the other hand, apart from the high\r\ntemperatures, would probably solidify every element, and the Sun, as a\r\nwhole, would present itself to us as a comparatively small solid globe,\r\nwith a density like that of platinum. With both factors in operation, we\r\nhave the result already given: a huge globe, more than one hundred times\r\nthe diameter of the Earth, yet only one-fourth its density, and gaseous\r\nprobably throughout the whole of its enormous bulk.\r\n\r\nWhat effect have these two factors, so stupendous in scale, upon its\r\nvisible surface? What is the appearance of the Sun?\r\n\r\nIt appears to be a large glowing disc, sensibly circular in outline, with\r\nits edge fairly well-defined both as seen in the telescope and as\r\nregistered on photographs. In the spectroscope, or when in an eclipse of\r\nthe Sun the Moon covers the whole disc, a narrow serrated ring is seen\r\nsurrounding the rim, like a velvet pile of a bright rose colour. This\r\ncrimson rim, the sierra or _chromosphere_ as it is usually called, is\r\nalways to be found edging the entire Sun, and therefore must carpet the\r\nsurface everywhere. But under ordinary conditions, we do not see the\r\nchromosphere itself, but look down through it on the _photosphere_, or\r\ngeneral radiating surface. This, to the eye, certainly looks like a\r\ndefinite shell, but some theorists have been so impressed with the\r\ndifficulty of conceiving that a gaseous body like the Sun could, under the\r\nconditions of such stupendous temperatures as there exist, have any\r\ndefined limit at all, that they deny that what we see on the Sun is a real\r\nboundary, and argue that it only appears so to us through the effects of\r\nthe anomalous refraction or dispersion of light. Such theories introduce\r\ndifficulties greater and more numerous than those that they clear away,\r\nand they are not generally accepted by practical observers of the Sun.\r\nThey seem incompatible with the apparent structure of the photosphere,\r\nwhich is everywhere made up of a complicated mottling: minute grains\r\nsomewhat resembling those of rice in shape, of intense brightness, and\r\nirregularly scattered. This mottling is sometimes coarsely, sometimes\r\nfinely textured; in some regions it is sharp and well defined, in others\r\nmisty or blurred, and in both cases they are often arranged in large\r\nelaborate patterns, the figures of the pattern sometimes extending for a\r\nhundred thousand miles or more in any direction. The rice-like grains or\r\ngranules of which these figures are built up, and the darker pores between\r\nthem, are, on the other hand, comparatively small, and do not, on the\r\naverage, exceed two to four hundred miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nBut the Sun shows us other objects of quite a different order in their\r\ndimensions. Here and there the bright granules of the photosphere become\r\ndisturbed and torn apart, and broad areas are exposed which are relatively\r\ndark. These are _sunspots_, and in the early stages of their development\r\nthey are usually arranged in groups which tend to be stretched out\r\nparallel to the Sun's equator. A group of spots in its later stages of\r\ndevelopment is more commonly reduced to a single round, well-defined, dark\r\nspot. These groups, when near the edge of the Sun, are usually seen to be\r\naccompanied by very bright markings, arranged in long irregular lines,\r\nlike the foam on an incoming tide. These markings are known as the\r\n_faculae_, from their brightness. In the spectroscope, when the serrated\r\nedges of the chromosphere are under observation, every now and then great\r\n_prominences_, or tongues and clouds of flame, are seen to rise up from\r\nthem, sometimes changing their form and appearance so rapidly that the\r\nmotion can almost be followed by the eye. An interval of fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes has frequently been sufficient to transform, quite beyond\r\nrecognition, a mass of flame fifty thousand miles in height. Sometimes a\r\nprominence of these, or even greater, dimensions has formed, developed,\r\nrisen to a great distance from the Sun, and completely disappeared within\r\nless than half an hour. The velocity of the gas streams in such eruptions\r\noften exceeds one hundred miles a second; sometimes, though only rarely,\r\nit reaches a speed twice as great.\r\n\r\nSunspots do not offer us examples of motions of this order of rapidity,\r\nbut the areas which they affect are not less astonishing. Many spot groups\r\nhave been seen to extend over a length of one hundred thousand, or one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand miles, and to cover a total area of a thousand\r\nmillion square miles. Indeed, the great group of February, 1905, at its\r\ngreatest extent, covered an area four times as great as this. Again, in\r\nthe normal course of the development of a spot group, the different\r\nmembers of the group frequently show a kind of repulsion for each other in\r\nthe early stages of the group's history, and the usual speed with which\r\nthey move away from each other is three hundred miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe spots, the faculae, the prominences, are all, in different ways, of\r\nthe nature of storms in an atmosphere; that is to say, that, in the great\r\ngaseous bulk of the Sun, certain local differences of constitution,\r\ntemperature, and pressure are marked by these different phenomena. From\r\nthis point of view it is most significant that many spots are known to\r\nlast for more than a month; some have been known to endure for even half a\r\nyear. The nearest analogy which the Earth supplies to these disturbances\r\nmay be found in tropical cyclones, but these are relatively of far smaller\r\narea, and only last a few days at the utmost, while a hundred miles an\r\nhour is the greatest velocity they ever exhibit, and this, fortunately,\r\nonly under exceptional circumstances. For a wind of such violence mows\r\ndown buildings and trees as a scythe the blades of grass; and were\r\ntornadoes moving at a rate of 300 miles an hour as common upon the Earth\r\nas spots are upon the Sun, it would be stripped bare of plants and\r\nanimals, as well as of men and of all their works.\r\n\r\nIt is not an accident that the Sun, when storm-swept, shows this violence\r\nof commotion, but a necessary consequence of its enormous temperature and\r\npressures. As we have seen, the force of gravity at its surface is 27.65\r\ntimes that at the surface of the Earth, where a body falls 16.1 feet in\r\nthe first second of time; on the Sun, therefore, a body would fall 445\r\nfeet in the first second; and the atmospheric motions generally would be\r\naccelerated in the same proportion.\r\n\r\nThe high temperatures, the great pressures, the violent commotions which\r\nprevail on the Sun are, therefore, the direct consequence of its enormous\r\nmass. The Sun is, then, not merely the type and example of the chief\r\nsource of light and heat in a given planetary system; it indicates to us\r\nthat size and mass are the primary tokens by which we may judge the\r\ntemperature of a world, and the activity to be expected in its changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ELEMENTS IN SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now an old story, but still possessing its interest, how Fraunhofer\r\nanalysed the light of the Sun by making it pass through a narrow slit and\r\na prism, and found that the broad rainbow-tinted band of light so obtained\r\nwas interrupted by hundreds of narrow dark lines, images in negative of\r\nthe slit; and how Kirchhoff succeeded in proving that two of these dark\r\nlines were caused by the white light of the solar photosphere having\r\nsuffered absorption at the Sun by passing through a stratum of glowing\r\nsodium vapour. From that time forward it has been known that the Sun is\r\nsurrounded by an atmosphere of intensely heated gases, among which figure\r\nmany of those elements familiar to us in the solid form on the Earth, such\r\nas iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, and the like. These metals,\r\nhere the very types of solid bodies, are permanent gases on the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe Sun, then, is in an essentially gaseous condition, enclosed by the\r\nluminous shell which we term the photosphere. This shell Prof. C. A. Young\r\nand the majority of astronomers regard as consisting of a relatively thin\r\nlayer of glowing clouds, justifying the quaint conceit of R. A. Proctor,\r\nwho spoke of the Sun as a \"Bubble\"; that is, a globe of gas surrounded by\r\nan envelope so thin in comparison as to be a mere film. There has been\r\nmuch difference of opinion as to the substance forming these clouds, but\r\nthe theory is still widely held which was first put forward by Dr.\r\nJohnstone Stoney in 1867, that they are due to the condensation of carbon,\r\nthe most refractory of all known elements. Prof. Abbot, however, refuses\r\nto believe in a surface of this nature, holding that the temperature of\r\nthe Sun is too high even at the surface to permit any such condensation.\r\n\r\nThe application of the spectroscope to astronomy is not confined to the\r\nSun, but reaches much further. The stars also yield their spectra, and we\r\nare compelled to recognize that they also are suns; intensely heated\r\nglobes of glowing gas, rich in the same elements as those familiar to us\r\non the Earth and known by their spectral lines to be present on the Sun.\r\nThe stars, therefore, cannot themselves be inhabited worlds any more than\r\nthe Sun, and at a stroke the whole of the celestial luminaries within the\r\nfurthest range of our most powerful telescopes are removed from our\r\npresent search. Only those members of our solar system that shine by\r\nreflecting the light of the Sun can be cool enough for habitation; the\r\ntrue stars cannot be inhabited, for, whatever their quality and order,\r\nthey are all suns, and must necessarily be in far too highly heated a\r\ncondition to be the abode of life. Many of them may, perhaps, be a source\r\nof light and heat to attendant planets, but there is no single instance in\r\nwhich such a planet has been directly observed; no dark, non-luminous body\r\nhas ever been actually seen in attendance on a star. Many double or\r\nmultiple stars are known, but these are all instances in which one\r\nsun-like body is revolving round another of the same order.[9] We see no\r\nbody shining by reflected light outside the limits of the solar system.\r\nPlanets to the various stars may exist in countless numbers, but they are\r\ninvisible to us, and we cannot discuss conditions where everything is\r\nunknown. Enquiry in such a case is useless, and speculation vain.\r\n\r\nThe stars, as revealed to us by the spectroscope are all of the same order\r\nas the Sun, but they are not all of the same species. Quite a large number\r\nof stars, of which Arcturus is one of the best-known examples, show\r\nspectra that are essentially the same as that of the Sun, but there are\r\nother stars of which the spectra bear little or no semblance to it.\r\nNevertheless, it remains true that, on the whole, stellar spectra bear\r\nwitness to the presence of just the same elements as we recognize in the\r\nSun, though not always in the same proportions or in the same\r\nconditions--hydrogen, calcium, sodium, magnesium, iron, titanium, and many\r\nmore are recognized in nearly all. It is true that not all the known\r\nterrestrial elements have yet been identified in either Sun or stars; but,\r\nin general, those missing are either \"negative\" elements like the\r\nhalogens, or elements of great atomic weight like mercury and platinum.\r\nThat elements of one class should, as a rule, reveal their presence in Sun\r\nand stars wherever these are placed, and, correspondingly, that other\r\nclasses should as generally fail to show themselves, indicate that such\r\nabsence is more likely to be due to the general structure of the stellar\r\nphotospheres and reversing layers than to any irregularity in the\r\ndistribution of matter in the universe. It is easy, for example, to\r\nconceive that the heavy metals may lie somewhat deeper down within the Sun\r\nor star than those of low atomic weight. In the case of the Sun, there\r\nseems a clear connection between atomic weight and the distinctness with\r\nwhich the element is recognized in the spectrum of the photosphere, the\r\nlower atomic weights showing themselves more conspicuously.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that not all elements present in a Sun or star show themselves\r\nin its spectrum. Oxygen is very feebly represented by its elemental\r\nlines, but the flutings of titanium oxide are found in sunspots, and with\r\ngreat distinctness in a certain type of stars. Nitrogen, too, though not\r\ndirectly recognized, proves its presence by the lines of cyanogen. The\r\ncase of helium is one of particular interest; this element was recognized\r\nby a very bright yellow line in the solar prominences before it was known\r\nto exist on the Earth; indeed, it received the name _helium_ because it\r\nthen seemed to be a purely solar constituent. Now it is seen as a strong\r\nabsorption line in the spectrum of many stars; but for some reason it is\r\nnot in general seen as an absorption line over the Sun's disc, and if our\r\nSun were removed to such distance so as to appear to us only as a star, we\r\nshould have no evidence that it contained any helium at all. So far, then,\r\nas the evidence of the spectroscope goes, the elements present in the\r\nEarth are present throughout the whole extent of the universe within our\r\nview: the same elements and with the same qualities. For the lines of the\r\nspectrum of an element are the revelation of its innermost molecular\r\nstructure, so that we can confidently affirm that hydrogen and oxygen on\r\nSirius, Arcturus, or the Sun, are essentially the same elements as\r\nhydrogen and oxygen on the Earth. On a planet attached to any of these\r\nstars, the two gases would combine together to form water under just the\r\nsame conditions as they do here on the Earth; and at suitable\r\ntemperatures that water would be a neutral liquid, capable of dissolving\r\njust the same chemical substances that it does here. It would freeze as it\r\ndoes here; it would evaporate as it does here; it would be water as\r\ncompletely in all its qualities and conditions as earthly water is. And\r\nwhat applies to one element or compound applies to all. Throughout the\r\nwhole extent of space, the same building materials have been employed, and\r\nthroughout they retain the same qualities.\r\n\r\nHydrogen is seen in the spectra of nearly all stars, and also in those of\r\nnebulae. The elemental lines of oxygen are not indeed seen in stellar\r\nspectra, but that the element is present is shown by the flutings of\r\ntitanium oxide which distinguish stars like Antares. Nitrogen and carbon\r\nagain are not recognized by their elemental lines, but the lines of\r\ncyanogen are seen in the spectra of comets and of sunspots, and\r\nhydrocarbon flutings in the spectra of comets and red stars; while in a\r\nfew of the hottest stars even sulphur has recently been identified.[10]\r\nAll the five organo-genetic elements are therefore abundantly diffused\r\nthrough space; the materials for protoplasm, \"the albuminous substance\r\nwith water,\" are at hand everywhere. This being so, it is reasonable to\r\ninfer that if organic life exists elsewhere than on this Earth, its\r\nessential feature, there as here, is the metabolism of nitrogenous carbon\r\ncompounds in association with protoplasm.\r\n\r\nBut it is objected that \"we are not yet able to identify all the lines in\r\nsolar or stellar spectra; may not some of these lines be due to elements\r\nof which we know nothing here, and may not such new elements form complex\r\nand unstable compounds with each other, or with some of those familiar to\r\nus, that would take the place of the five organo-generators, and so give\r\nrise to a physical basis of life, different from that we know on this\r\nEarth?\"\r\n\r\nBut the development of Mendeleeff's Periodic Law has shown that the\r\nelements are not to be regarded as disconnected entities. The Law as given\r\nin Mendeleeff's own words, runs: \"The properties of the elements as well\r\nas the forms and properties of their compounds are in periodic dependence\r\non, or (expressing ourselves algebraically) form a periodic function of\r\nthe atomic weights of the elements.\" In other words, they form a series,\r\nnot only as it regards their atomic weights, but also as it regards their\r\nown properties and the forms and properties of their compounds. We are no\r\nlonger at liberty, as we might have been many years ago, to call into\r\nfancied existence new elements having no relation in their properties and\r\ncompounds to those with which we are acquainted. New elements, no doubt,\r\nwill be discovered in the future, as in the past; and indeed we may be\r\nable to discover them and learn their atomic weights and properties\r\nwithout ever being able to handle them in a terrestrial laboratory.\r\n\r\nIn a series of remarkable papers communicated to the Royal Astronomical\r\nSociety during the past year (1911-1912), Dr. J. W. Nicholson has given\r\nthe result of his computation of the positions of the spectral lines of\r\ntwo elements of simple structure, and has found that the resulting lines\r\ncorrespond, for one dynamical system, to the chief unidentified lines\r\nobserved in the spectra of nebulae, and for the other, to the chief\r\nunidentified lines in the spectrum of the corona. The latter element is\r\nprobably associated with the halogens, but of much lower atomic weight\r\n(namely, 1.3), than fluorine; he therefore gives it the name of\r\n_Protofluorine_. The other element, to which he gives the name _Nebulium_,\r\nwill have an atomic weight of 2.1. Prof. Max Wolf, of Heidelberg, has\r\nrecently pointed out[11] the evidence of the presence of two other unknown\r\ngases in the Ring nebula in Lyra, and there is no reason to suppose that\r\nthe process of discovery has come to an end. But we cannot imagine that we\r\nshall discover any new elements that are more abundant and more\r\nuniversally diffused than the five which give us protoplasm--\"the physical\r\nbasis of life.\" To take an analogy from the solar system: many hundreds of\r\nplanetoids have now been discovered between the orbits of Mars and\r\nJupiter, and probably many hundreds more remain to be discovered; but of\r\none thing we are certain, that none of the planetoids yet to be discovered\r\nwill be of the same rank as either of those two guardians, Mars and\r\nJupiter, who revolve on the confines of the planetoidal zone. Indeed,\r\nCeres, the planetoid first discovered, has a greater mass than the\r\naggregate of all discovered since, and probably of all that exist in the\r\nzone.\r\n\r\nWater is essential for life here, but the quality in water which restricts\r\nthe range of terrestrial life is that it freezes at 0 deg. Centigrade, and\r\nboils at 100 deg. Centigrade; it is only in the liquid state during the\r\nintermediate range of 100 degrees. In order to extend the range for living\r\norganisms, we should have, therefore, to discover a new vehicle, that,\r\npossessing all the other qualities of water, is not restricted to the\r\nliquid state within the same limits. But we are at once met with the\r\ndifficulty that the first essential for the vehicle is that it should be\r\nabundant, and there are no other elements more abundant than hydrogen and\r\noxygen. This new vehicle must, like water, be both neutral and stable, or\r\nit would itself interfere with the highly unstable compounds that are a\r\nnecessity for metabolism. And, if we could find this new vehicle, liquid\r\nat temperatures outside the 0 deg. to 100 deg. Centigrade, have we any reason to\r\nsuppose that protoplasm itself would be able to endure these outlying\r\ntemperatures? Looking through the range of substances available, we can\r\nonly say that none other presents itself as approaching water in\r\nsuitability for its essential office. If we, ourselves, were able to\r\ncreate a vehicle, could we imagine one more perfectly suited?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sun and Moon offer to our sight almost exactly the same apparent\r\ndiameters; to the eye, they look the same size. But as we know the Sun to\r\nbe 400 times as distant as the Moon, it is necessarily 400 times as large;\r\nits surface must exceed that of the Moon by the square of 400, or 160,000;\r\nits volume by the cube of 400, or 64,000,000. As the Sun is of low mean\r\ndensity, its mass does not exceed that of the Moon in quite the same high\r\nratio; but it is equal in mass to\r\n\r\n  27,000,000 moons.\r\n\r\nCompared with the Sun, the Moon is therefore an insignificant little\r\nball--a mere particle; but as a world for habitation it possesses some\r\nadvantages over the Sun. The first glance at it in a telescope is\r\nsufficient to assure the observer that he is looking at a solid,\r\nsubstantial globe. It is not only substantial, it is rugged; its surface\r\nis broken up into mountains, hills, valleys, and plains; the mountains\r\nstand out in sensible relief; it looks like a ball of solid silver boldly\r\nembossed and chased.\r\n\r\nSo far all is to the good for the purpose of habitation. Wherever men\r\nare, they must have a solid platform on which to stand; they must have a\r\nstable terrene whereon their food may grow, and this the Moon could\r\nsupply. \"The Earth's gloom of iron substance\" is necessary for man here,\r\nand the Moon appears to offer a like stability.\r\n\r\nAnother favourable condition is that we know that the Moon receives from\r\nthe Sun a sufficient supply of light and heat. Each square yard of its\r\nsurface receives, on the average, the same amount of light and heat that\r\nwould fall upon a square yard on the Earth that was presented towards the\r\nSun at the same inclination; and we know from our own experience that this\r\nis sufficient for the maintenance of life.\r\n\r\nAnd the Moon is near enough for us to subject her to a searching scrutiny.\r\nEvery part of the hemisphere turned toward us has been repeatedly\r\nexamined, measured, and photographed; to that extent our knowledge of its\r\ntopography is more complete than of the world on which we live. There are\r\nno unexplored regions on our side of the Moon. The great photographs taken\r\nin recent years at the observatories of Paris and of the University of\r\nChicago have shown thousands of \"crater-pits,\" not more than a mile\r\nacross; and narrow lines on the Moon's surface have been detected with a\r\nbreadth less than one-tenth of this. An elevation on the Moon, if it rose\r\nup abruptly from an open plain, would make its presence apparent by the\r\nshadow which it would cast soon after sunrise or near sunset; in this way\r\nan isolated building, if it were as large as the great pyramid of Ghizeh,\r\nwould also show itself, and all our great towns and cities would be\r\napparent as areas of indistinct mottling, though the details of the cities\r\nwould not be made out.\r\n\r\nBut if vegetation took the same forms on the Moon as on the Earth, and\r\npassed through the same changes, we should have no difficulty in\r\nperceiving the evidence of its presence. If we were transported to the\r\nMoon and turned our eyes earthward, we should not need the assistance of\r\nany telescope in order to detect terrestrial changes which would be\r\nplainly connected with the seasonal changes of vegetation. The Earth would\r\npresent to us a disc four times the apparent diameter of the Moon, and on\r\nthat disc Canada would offer as great an area as the whole of the Moon\r\ndoes to us. We could easily follow with the naked eye the change from the\r\nglittering whiteness of the aspect of Canada when snow-covered in winter,\r\nto the brown, green and gold which would succeed each other during the\r\nbrighter months of the year. And this type of change would alternate\r\nbetween the northern and southern hemispheres, for the winter of Canada is\r\nthe summer of the Argentine, and conversely.\r\n\r\nWe ought, therefore, to have no difficulty in observing seasonal changes\r\non the Moon, if such take place. But nothing of the kind has ever been\r\nremarked; no changes sufficiently pronounced for us to be sure of them are\r\never witnessed. Here and there some slight mutations have been suspected,\r\nnearly all accomplishing their cycle in the course of a lunar day; so that\r\nit is difficult to separate them from changes purely apparent, brought\r\nabout by the change in the incidence of the illumination.\r\n\r\nThe difference in appearance of a given area on the Moon when viewed under\r\na low Sun and when the Sun is on the meridian is very striking. In the\r\nfirst case everything is in the boldest relief; the shadows are long and\r\nintensely black; the whole area under examination in the telescope seems\r\nas if it might be handled. Under the high Sun, the contrasts are gone; the\r\nscenery appears flat, many of the large conspicuous markings are only\r\nrecognized with difficulty. Thus the terse remark of Maedler, \"The full\r\nMoon knows no Maginus,\" has become a proverb amongst selenographers; yet\r\nMaginus is a fine walled plain some eighty miles in diameter, and its\r\nrampart attains a height in parts of 14,000 feet. Maginus lies near Tycho,\r\nwhich has been well named \"the lunar metropolis,\" for from it radiates the\r\nprincipal system of bright streaks conspicuous on the full Moon. These\r\nwhite streaks appear when the shadows have vanished or are growing short;\r\nthey are not seen under a low Sun.\r\n\r\nThe changes which appear to take place in the lunar formations owing to\r\nthe change in their illumination are much more striking and varied than\r\nwould be anticipated. But the question arises whether all the changes that\r\nare associated with the progress of the lunar day can be ascribed to this\r\neffect. Thus, Prof. W. H. Pickering writes concerning a well-known pair of\r\nlittle craters of about nine miles in diameter, \"known as Messier and\r\nMessier A, situated side by side not far from the centre of the Mare\r\nFecunditatis. When the Sun rises first on them, the eastern one, A, is\r\ntriangular and larger than Messier, which latter is somewhat pear-shaped.\r\nAbout three days after sunrise they both suddenly turn white, Messier\r\nrapidly grows in size, soon surpasses A, and also becomes triangular in\r\nshape. Six days after sunrise the craters are again nearly of the same\r\nsize, owing to the diminution of Messier. The shape of A has become\r\nirregular, and differs in different lunations. At nine days after sunrise\r\nthe craters are exactly alike in size and shape, both now being\r\nelliptical, with their major axes lying in a nearly N. and S. direction.\r\nJust before sunset A is again the larger, being almost twice the size of\r\nMessier.\"[12]\r\n\r\nSome observers explain this cycle of changes as due merely to the peculiar\r\ncontour of the two objects, the change in the lighting during the lunar\r\nday altering their apparent figures. Prof. W. H. Pickering, on the other\r\nhand, while recognizing that some portion of the change of shape is\r\nprobably due to the contour of the ground, conceives that, in order to\r\nexplain the whole phenomenon, it is necessary to suppose that a white\r\nlayer of hoar frost is formed periodically round the two craters. It is\r\nalso alleged that whereas Maedler described the two craters as being\r\nexactly alike eighty years ago, Messier A is now distinctly the larger;\r\nbut it is very doubtful whether Maedler's description can be trusted to\r\nthis degree of nicety. If it could, this would establish a permanent\r\nchange in the actual structure of the lunar surface at this point.\r\n\r\nThere are several other cases of the same order of ambiguity. The most\r\ncelebrated is Linne, a white spot about six miles in diameter on the Mare\r\nSerentatis. This object appears to change in size during the progress of\r\nthe lunar day, and, as with Messier, some selenographers consider that it\r\nhas also suffered an actual permanent change in shape within the last\r\nsixty or seventy years. Here again the evidence is not decisive; Neison is\r\nby no means convinced that a change has taken place, yet does not think it\r\nimpossible that Linne may once have been a crater with steep walls which\r\nhave collapsed into its interior through the force of gravity.\r\n\r\nAnother type of suspected change is associated with the neighbourhood of\r\nAristarchus, the brightest formation on the Moon, so bright indeed that\r\nSir William Herschel, observing it when illuminated by earthshine in the\r\ndark portion of the Moon, thought that he was watching a lunar volcano in\r\neruption. In 1897, on September 21, the late Major Molesworth noticed that\r\nthe crater was at that time under the rays of the setting Sun, and filled\r\nwith shadow, and the inner terraces, which should have been invisible,\r\nwere seen as faint, knotted, glimmering streaks under both the eastern and\r\nwestern walls, and the central peak was also dimly discernible. He thought\r\nthis unusual lighting up of rocks on which the Sun had already set might\r\nbe due either to phosphorescence produced by long exposure to the Sun's\r\nrays, or to inherent heat, or to reflected glare from the western rampart.\r\nStill more important, both Major Molesworth and Mr. Walter Goodacre, each\r\non more than one occasion, observed what seemed to be a faint bluish mist\r\non the inner slope of the east wall, soon after sunrise, but this was\r\nvisible only for a short time. Other selenographers too, on rare\r\noccasions, have made observations accordant with these, relating to\r\nvarious regions on the Moon.\r\n\r\nThese, and a few other similar instances, are all that selenography has to\r\noffer by way of evidence of actual lunar change. Of seeming change there\r\nis abundance, but beyond that we have only cases for controversy, and one\r\nof the most industrious of the present-day observers of the Moon, M.\r\nPhilip Fauth, declares that \"as a student of the Moon for the last twenty\r\nyears, and as probably one of the few living investigators who have kept\r\nin practical touch with the results of selenography, he is bound to\r\nexpress his conviction that no eye has ever seen a physical change in the\r\nplastic features of the Moon's surface.\"[13]\r\n\r\nIn this matter of change, then, the Earth and Moon stand in the greatest\r\ncontrast to each other. As we have seen, from the view-point of the Moon,\r\nthe appearance of the Earth would change so manifestly with the progress\r\nof the seasons that no one could fail to remark the difference, even\r\nthough observing with the naked eye. But from the view-point of the Earth,\r\nthe Moon when examined by our most experienced observers, armed with our\r\nmost powerful telescopes, offers us only a few doubtful enigmatical\r\ninstances of possible change confined to small isolated localities; we see\r\nno evidence that the \"gloom of iron substance\" below is ever concealed by\r\na veil of changing vegetation, or that \"between the burning light and deep\r\nvacuity\" of the heavens above, the veil of the flying vapour has ever been\r\nspread out. We see the Moon so clearly that we are assured it holds no\r\nwater to nourish plant life; we see it so clearly because there is no air\r\nto carry the vapour that might dim our view.\r\n\r\nLife is change, and a planet where there is no change, or where that\r\nchange is very small, can be no home for life. The \"stability and\r\ninsensibility\" are indeed required in the platform upon which life is to\r\nappear, but there must be the presence of \"the passion and the perishing,\"\r\nor life will be unable to find a home.\r\n\r\nWe infer the absence of water and air from the Moon not only from the\r\nunchanging character of its features and the distinctness with which we\r\nsee them; we are able to make direct observations. Galileo, the first man\r\nto observe the Moon to better advantage than with the naked eye, was not\r\nlong before he decided that the Moon contained no water, for though\r\nMilton, in a well-known passage, makes Galileo discover\r\n\r\n  \"Rivers or mountains on her spotty globe,\"\r\n\r\nGalileo himself wrote: \"I do not believe that the body of the Moon is\r\ncomposed of earth and water.\" The name of _maria_ was given to the great\r\ngrey plains of the Moon by Hevelius, but this was simply for convenience\r\nof nomenclature, not because he actually believed them to be seas. One\r\nobservation is, in itself, sufficient to prove that the maria are not\r\nwater surfaces. The Moon's \"terminator,\" that is to say, the line dividing\r\nthe part in sunlight from that in darkness, is clearly irregular when it\r\npasses over the great plains; were they actually sea it would be a bright\r\nline and perfectly smooth. The grey plains are therefore not expanses of\r\nwater now, nor were they in time past. It is obvious that in some remote\r\nantiquity their surface was in a fluid condition, but it was the fluidity\r\nof molten rock. This is seen by the way in which the maria have invaded,\r\nbreached, broken down, and submerged many of the circular formations on\r\ntheir margins. Thus the Mare Humorum has swept away half the wall of the\r\nrings, Hippalus and Doppelmayer, and far out in the open plain of the Mare\r\nNubium, great circles like Kies, and that immediately north of Flamsteed,\r\nstand up in faint relief as of half-submerged rings. Clearly there was a\r\nperiod after the age in which the great ring mountains and walled plains\r\ncame into existence, when an invasive flood attacked and partially\r\ndestroyed a large proportion of them. And the flood itself evidently\r\nbecame more viscous and less fluid the further it spread from its original\r\ncentre of action, for the ridges and crumpling of the surface indicate\r\nthat the material found more and more difficulty in its flow.\r\n\r\nWe have evidence just as direct that there is no atmosphere. This is very\r\nstrikingly shown when the Moon, in its monthly progress among the stars,\r\npasses before one of them and occults it. Such an occultation is\r\ninstantaneous, and is particularly impressive when either a disappearance\r\nor a reappearance occurs at the defective limb; that is to say, at the\r\nlimb which is not illuminated by the Sun, and is therefore invisible. The\r\nobserver may have a bright star in the field of view, showing steadily in\r\na cloudless sky; there is not a hint of a weakening in its light; suddenly\r\nit is gone. The first experience of such an observation is most\r\ndisconcerting; it is hardly less disconcerting to observe the reappearance\r\nat the dark limb. One moment the field of view of the telescope is empty;\r\nthe next, without any sort of dawning, a bright star is shining steadily\r\nin the void, and it almost seems to the observer as if an explosion had\r\ntaken place. If the Moon had an atmosphere extending upwards from its\r\nsurface in all directions and of any appreciable density, an occultation\r\nwould not be so exceedingly abrupt; and, in particular, if the occultation\r\nwere watched through a spectroscope, then, at the disappearance, the\r\nspectrum of the star would not vanish as a whole, but the red end would go\r\nfirst, and the rest of the spectrum would be swept out of sight\r\nsuccessively, from orange to the violet. This does not happen; the whole\r\nspectrum goes out together, and it is clear that no appreciable atmosphere\r\ncan exist on the Moon. In actual observation so inappreciable is it that\r\nits density at the Moon's surface is variously estimated as 1/300th of\r\nthat of the Earth by Neison, and as 1/10000th by W. H. Pickering. If the\r\nMoon possessed an atmosphere bearing the same proportion to her total mass\r\nas we find in the case of the Earth, she would have a density of\r\none-fortieth of our atmosphere at the sea level.\r\n\r\nThe Moon is at the same mean distance from the Sun as the Earth, and\r\ntherefore, surface for surface, receives from it on the average the same\r\namount of light and heat. But it makes a very different use of these\r\nsupplies. Bright as the Moon appears when seen at the full on some winter\r\nnight, it has really but a very low power of reflection, and is only\r\nbright by contrast with the darkness of the midnight sky. If the full Moon\r\nis seen in broad daylight, it is pale and ghost-like. Sir John Herschel\r\nhas put it on record that when in South Africa he often had the\r\nopportunity of comparing the Moon with the face of Table Mountain, the Sun\r\nshining full upon both, and the Moon appeared no brighter than the\r\nweathered rock. The best determinations of the _albedo_ of the Moon, that\r\nis to say, of its reflective power, give it as 0.17, so that only\r\none-sixth of the incident light is reflected, the other five-sixths being\r\nabsorbed. It is difficult to obtain a good determination of the Earth's\r\n_albedo_, but the most probable estimate puts it as about 0.50, or three\r\ntimes as great as that of the Moon. This high reflective power is partly\r\nto be accounted for by the great extent of the terrestrial polar caps, but\r\nchiefly by the clouds and dust layer always present in its atmosphere.\r\n\r\nA larger proportion, therefore, of the solar rays are employed in heating\r\nthe soil of the Moon than in heating that of the Earth, and in this\r\nconnection the effect of an important difference between the two worlds\r\nmust be noted. The Earth rotates on its axis in 23 hours 56 minutes 4\r\nseconds, the mean length of its rotation as referred to the Sun being 24\r\nhours. The rotation of the Moon, on the other hand, takes 27 days 7 hours\r\n43 minutes to accomplish, giving a mean rotation, as referred to the Sun,\r\nof 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes. The lunar surface is therefore exposed\r\nuninterruptedly to the solar scorching for very nearly fifteen of our days\r\nat a time, and it is, in turn, exposed to the intense cold of outer space\r\nfor an equal period. As the surface absorbs heat so readily, it must\r\nradiate it as quickly; hence radiation must go on with great rapidity\r\nduring the long lunar night. Lord Rosse and Prof. Very have both obtained\r\nmeasures of the change in the lunar heat radiation during the progress of\r\na total eclipse of the Moon, with the result that the heat disappeared\r\nalmost completely, though not quite at the same time as the light. Prof.\r\nLangley succeeded in obtaining from the Moon, far down in the long wave\r\nlengths of the infra-red, a heat spectrum which was only partly due to\r\nreflection from the Sun; part coming from the lunar soil itself, which,\r\nhaving absorbed heat from the Sun, radiated it out again almost\r\nimmediately. In 1898, Prof. Very, following up Langley's line of work,\r\nconcluded that the temperature of the lunar soil must range through about\r\n350 deg. Centigrade, considerably exceeding 100 deg. at the height of the lunar\r\nday, and falling to about the temperature of liquid air during the lunar\r\nnight. So wide a range of temperature must be fatal to living organisms,\r\nparticularly when the range is repeated at short, regular intervals of\r\ntime. But this range of temperature comes directly from the length of the\r\nMoon's rotation period; for the longer the day of the Moon, the higher the\r\ntemperature which may be attained in it; the longer the night, the greater\r\nthe cold which will in turn be experienced. We learn, therefore, that the\r\ntime of rotation of a planet is an important factor in its habitability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CANALS OF MARS\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth of the two worlds best placed for our study are thus, for different\r\nreasons, ruled out of court as worlds for habitation. The Sun by its\r\nvastness, its intolerable heat and the violence of its changes, has to be\r\nrejected on the one hand, while the Moon, so small, and therefore so\r\nrigid, unchanging and bare, is rejected on the other.\r\n\r\nOf the other heavenly bodies, the planet Mars is the one that we see to\r\nbest advantage. Two other planets, Eros and Venus, at times come nearer to\r\nus, but neither offers us on such occasions equal facilities for their\r\nexamination. But of Mars it has been asserted not only that it is\r\ninhabited, but that we know it to be the case, since the evidence of the\r\nhandiwork of intelligent beings is manifest to us, even across the\r\ntremendous gulf of forty or more million miles of space.\r\n\r\nA claim so remarkable almost captures the position by its audacity. There\r\nis a natural desire among men to believe the marvellous, and the very\r\nboldness of the assertion goes no small way to overcome incredulity. And\r\nwhen we consider how puny are men as we see them on this our planet, how\r\nminute their greatest works, how superhuman any undertaking would be which\r\ncould demonstrate our existence to observers on another planet, we must\r\nadmit that it is a marvel that there should be any evidence forthcoming\r\nthat could bear one way or another on the solution of a problem so\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe first fact that we have to remember with regard to the planet Mars is\r\nthe smallness of its apparent size. To the eye it is nearly a star--a\r\npoint of light without visible surface. It is almost twice the size of the\r\nMoon in actual diameter, but as its mean distance from the Earth is 600\r\ntimes that of the Moon, its mean apparent diameter is 300 times smaller.\r\nWe cannot, however, watch Mars in all parts of its orbit; it is best\r\nplaced for observation, and, therefore, most observed, when in opposition,\r\nand oppositions may be favourable or unfavourable. At the most favourable\r\nopposition, Mars is 140 times as distant as the Moon; at the least\r\nfavourable, 260 times; so that on such occasions its apparent size varies\r\nfrom 1/70th of the diameter of the Moon to 1/130th. But a telescope with a\r\nmagnifying power of 70 could never, under the most perfect conditions,\r\nshow Mars, even in the closest opposition, as well as the Moon is seen\r\nwith the naked eye, for the practical magnifying power of a telescope is\r\nnever as great as the theoretical. In practice, a child's spy-glass\r\nmagnifying some six diameters will show the full Moon to better advantage\r\nthan Mars has ever been seen, even in our most powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\nThe small apparent size of the planet explains how it was that Galileo\r\ndoes not seem to have been able to detect any markings upon it. In 1659,\r\nHuyghens laid the foundation stone of areography by observing some dark\r\nspots, and determining from their apparent movements that the planet had a\r\nrotation on its axis, which it accomplished in about the same time as the\r\nEarth. Small and rough as are the drawings that Huyghens made, the\r\nidentification of one or two of his spots is unmistakable. Seven years\r\nlater, in 1666, both Cassini and Hooke made a number of sketches, and\r\nthose by Hooke have been repeatedly used in modern determinations of the\r\nrotation period of the planet. The next great advance was made by Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel, who, during the oppositions of 1777, 1779, 1781, and\r\n1783, determined the inclination of the axis of Mars to the plane of its\r\norbit, measured its polar and equatorial diameters, and ascertained the\r\namount of the polar flattening. He paid also special attention to two\r\nbright white spots upon the planet, and he showed that these formed round\r\nthe planet's poles and increased in size as the winter of each several\r\nhemisphere drew on and diminished again with the advance of summer,\r\nbehaving therefore as do the snow caps of our own polar regions.\r\n\r\nThe next stage in the development of our knowledge of Mars must be\r\nascribed to the two German astronomers, Beer and Maedler, who made a series\r\nof drawings in the years 1830, 1832 and 1837, by means of a telescope of 4\r\ninches aperture, from which they were able to construct a chart of the\r\nentire globe. This chart may be considered classic, for the features which\r\nit represents have been observed afresh at each succeeding opposition.\r\nMars, therefore, possesses a permanent topography, and some of the\r\nmarkings in question can be identified, not only in the rough sketches\r\nmade by Sir William Herschel, but even in those made by Hooke and Cassini\r\nas far back as the year 1666. In the forty years that followed, the planet\r\nwas studied by many of the most skilled observers, particularly by Mr. J.\r\nN. Lockyer in 1862, and the Rev. W. R. Dawes in 1864. In 1877, the late\r\nMr. N. E. Green, drawing-master to Queen Victoria, and a distinguished\r\npainter in water colours, made a series of sketches of the planet from a\r\nstation in the island of Madeira 2000 feet above sea-level. When the\r\nopposition was over, Mr. Green collected together a large number of\r\ndrawings, and formed a chart of the planet, much richer in detail than any\r\nthat had preceded it, and from his skill, experience and training as an\r\nartist he reproduced the appearance of the planet with a fidelity that had\r\nnever been equalled before and has never been surpassed since. At this\r\ntime it was generally assumed that Mars was a miniature of our own world.\r\nThe brighter districts of its surface were supposed to be continents, the\r\ndarker, seas. As Sir William Herschel had already pointed out long before,\r\nthe little world evidently had its seasons, its axis being inclined to the\r\nplane of its orbit at much the same angle as is the case with the Earth;\r\nit had its polar caps, presumably of ice and snow; its day was but very\r\nlittle longer than that of the Earth; and the only important difference\r\nseemed to be that it had a longer year, and was a little further off the\r\nSun. But the general conclusion was that it was so like the Earth in its\r\nconditions that we had practically found out all that there was to know;\r\nall that seemed to be reserved for future research was that a few minor\r\ndetails of the surface might be filled in as the power of our telescopes\r\nwas increased.\r\n\r\nBut fortunately for progress, this sense of satisfaction was to be rudely\r\ndisturbed. As Mars, in its progress round the Sun, receded from the Earth,\r\nor rather as the Earth moved away from it, the astronomers who observed so\r\ndiligently during the autumn of 1877 turned their attention to other\r\nobjects. One of them, however, Schiaparelli, the most distinguished\r\nastronomer on the continent of Europe, still continued to watch the\r\nplanet, and, as the result of his labours, he published some months later\r\nthe first of a magnificent series of _Memoirs_, bringing to light what\r\nappeared to be a new feature. His drawings not only showed the \"lands\" and\r\n\"seas,\" that is to say the bright and dark areas, that Green and his\r\npredecessors had drawn, but also a number of fine, narrow, dark lines\r\ncrossing the \"lands\" in every direction. These narrow lines are the\r\nmarkings which have since been so celebrated as the \"canals of Mars,\" and\r\nthe discussion as to the real nature of these canals has focussed\r\nattention upon Mars in a way that, perhaps, nothing else could have done.\r\nBefore 1877 the study of planetary markings was left almost entirely to\r\nthe desultory labours of amateurs, skilled though many of them were; since\r\n1877, the most powerful telescopes of the great public observatories of\r\nthe world have been turned upon Mars, and the most skilful and experienced\r\nof professional astronomers have not been ashamed to devote their time to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to pass in review the whole of the immense mass of\r\nobservations that have been accumulated since Schiaparelli brought out the\r\nfirst of his great Memoirs. That Memoir gave rise to an immediate\r\ncontroversy, for many astronomers of skill and experience had observed the\r\nplanet in 1877 without detecting the network of lines which Schiaparelli\r\nhad revealed, and it was natural that they should feel some reluctance in\r\naccepting results so strange and novel. But little by little this\r\ncontroversy has passed. We now know that the \"canals\" vary much in their\r\nvisibility, and \"curiously enough the canals are most conspicuous, not at\r\nthe time the planet is nearest to the Earth and its general features are\r\nin consequence best seen, but as the planet goes away the canals come out.\r\nThe fact is that the orbital position and the seasonal epoch conspire to a\r\nmasking of the phenomena.\" This was the chief reason why Schiaparelli's\r\ndiscoveries seemed at first to stand so entirely without corroboration;\r\nthe \"canals\" did not become conspicuous until after most observers had\r\ndesisted from following the planet. Another reason was that, in 1877, Mars\r\nwas low down in the sky for northern observatories, and good definition is\r\nan essential for their recognition. But the careful examination of\r\ndrawings made in earlier oppositions, especially those made by Dawes and\r\nGreen, afforded confirmation of not a few of Schiaparelli's \"canals\"; even\r\nin 1877 a few of the easiest and most conspicuous had been delineated by\r\nother astronomers before any rumour of Schiaparelli's work had come\r\nabroad, and as Mars came under observation again and again at successive\r\noppositions, the number of those who were able to verify Schiaparelli's\r\ndiscoveries increased. It has now long been known that the great Italian\r\nastronomer was not the victim of a mere optical illusion; there were\r\nactual markings on the planet Mars where he had represented them; markings\r\nwhich, when seen under like conditions and with equal instrumental\r\nequipment, did present the appearance of straight, narrow lines. The\r\n\"canals of Mars\" are not mere figments of the imagination, but have a real\r\nobjective basis.\r\n\r\nAs this controversy has passed away, another and a very different one has\r\narisen out of an unfortunate mistranslation of the term chosen by\r\nSchiaparelli to indicate these linear streaks. In conformity with the type\r\nof nomenclature adopted by previous areographers who had divided Mars into\r\n\"seas,\" \"continents,\" \"islands,\" \"isthmuses,\" \"straits\" and the like,\r\nSchiaparelli had called the narrow lines he detected \"_canali_\", that is\r\nto say \"channels,\" but without intending to convey the idea of artificial\r\nconstruction. Indeed, he himself was careful to point out that these\r\ndesignations \"were not intended to prejudge the nature of the spot, and\r\nwere nothing but an artifice for helping the memory and for shortening\r\ndescriptions.\" And he added, \"We speak in the same way of the lunar seas,\r\nalthough we well know that there are no true seas on the Moon.\" But\r\n\"_canali_\" was unhappily rendered in English as \"canals,\" instead of\r\n\"channels.\" \"Channel\" would have left the nature of the marking an open\r\nquestion, but, in English, \"canal\" means an artificial waterway. Here then\r\nthe question as to whether or no Mars is inhabited comes definitely before\r\nus. Have we sufficient grounds for believing that the \"canals\" are\r\nartificial constructions, or may they be merely natural formations?\r\n\r\nIn 1894, Mr. Percival Lowell founded at Flagstaff, Arizona, U.S.A., a\r\nwell-equipped observatory for the special study of Mars, and he has\r\ncontinued his scrutiny of the planet from that time to the present with\r\nthe most unrelaxing perseverance. The chief results that he has obtained\r\nhave been the detection of many new \"canals\"; the discovery of a number of\r\ndark, round dots, termed by him \"oases,\" at the junctions of the \"canals\";\r\nand the demonstration that the \"canals\" and certain of the dusky regions\r\nare subject to strictly seasonal change, as really as the polar caps\r\nthemselves. In addition, he has formed the conclusion, which he has\r\nsupported with much ingenuity and skill, that the regularity of the\r\n\"canals\" and \"oases\" quite precludes the possibility of their being\r\nnatural formations. Hence there has arisen the second controversy: that on\r\nthe nature of the \"canals\"; for Mr. Lowell considers that their presence\r\nproves the existence of inhabitants on Mars, who, by means of a Titanic\r\nsystem of irrigation, are fighting a losing battle against the gradual\r\ndesiccation of their planet.\r\n\r\nIn a paper published in the _International Scientific Review_, \"Scientia,\"\r\nin January, 1910, Mr. Lowell gave a summary of his argument.\r\n\r\n    \"Organic life needs water for its existence. This water we see exists\r\n    on Mars, but in very scant amount, so that if life of any sort exists\r\n    there, it must be chiefly dependent on the semi-annual unlocking of\r\n    the polar snows for its supply, inasmuch as there are no surface\r\n    bodies of it over the rest of the planet. Now the last few years,\r\n    beginning with Schiaparelli in 1877, and much extended since at\r\n    Flagstaff, have shown:\r\n\r\n    \"The surface of the planet to be very curiously meshed by a fine\r\n    network of lines and spots.\r\n\r\n    \"Now if one considers first the appearance of this network of lines\r\n    and spots, and then its regular behaviour, he will note that its\r\n    geometrism precludes its causation on such a scale by any natural\r\n    process and, on the other hand, that such is precisely the aspect\r\n    which an artificial irrigating system, dependent upon the melting of\r\n    the polar snows, would assume. Since water is only to be had at the\r\n    time it is there unlocked, and since for any organic life it must be\r\n    got, it would be by tapping the disintegrated cap, and only so, that\r\n    it could be obtained. If Mars be inhabited, therefore, it is precisely\r\n    such a curious system we should expect to see, and only by such\r\n    explanation does it seem possible to account for the facts.\r\n\r\n    \"These lines are the so-called canals of Mars. It is not supposed that\r\n    what we see is the conduit itself. On the contrary, the behaviour of\r\n    these lines indicates that what we are looking at is vegetation. Now,\r\n    vegetation can only be induced by a water-supply. What we see\r\n    resembles the yearly inundation of the Nile, of which to a spectator\r\n    in space the river itself might be too narrow to be seen, and only the\r\n    verdured country on its banks be visible. This is what we suppose to\r\n    be the case with Mars. However the water be conducted, whether in\r\n    covered conduits, which seems probable, or not, science is not able to\r\n    state, but the effects of it are so palpable and so exactly in accord\r\n    with what such a system of irrigation would show, that we are\r\n    compelled to believe that such is indeed its _vera causa_.\"\r\n\r\nBeside the bulky _Memoirs_ in which Prof. Lowell has published the\r\nscientific results obtained at his observatory at Flagstaff, and papers\r\nand articles appearing in various scientific journals, he has brought out\r\nthree books of a more popular character: \"_Mars_\"; \"_Mars and its\r\nCanals_\"; and \"_Mars as the Abode of Life_.\" In these he shows that to the\r\nassiduity of the astronomer he adds the missionary's zeal and eagerness\r\nfor converts as he pleads most skilfully for the acceptance of his chosen\r\ndoctrine of the presence of men on Mars. In the last of the three books\r\nmentioned, he deals directly with \"Proofs of Life on Mars.\" The presence\r\nof vegetation may be inferred from seasonal changes of tint, just as an\r\nobserver on the Moon might with the naked eye watch effects on the Earth.\r\nBut though \"vegetable life could thus reveal itself directly, animal life\r\ncould not. Not by its body but by its mind would it be known. Across the\r\ngulf of space it could be recognized only by the imprint it had made on\r\nthe face of Mars.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Confronting the observer are lines and spots that but impress him the\r\n    more, as his study goes on, with their non-natural look. So uncommonly\r\n    regular are they, and on such a scale as to raise suspicions whether\r\n    they can be by nature regularly produced\" (p. 188).\r\n\r\n    \"... Unnatural regularity, the observations showed, betrays itself in\r\n    everything to do with the lines: in their surprising straightness,\r\n    their amazing uniformity throughout, their exceeding tenuity, and\r\n    their immense length\" (p. 189).\r\n\r\n    \"As a planet ages, its surface water grows scarce. Its oceans in time\r\n    dry up, its rivers cease to flow, its lakes evaporate (p. 203)....\r\n    Now, in the struggle for existence, water must be got.... Its\r\n    procuring depends on the intelligence of the organisms that stand in\r\n    need of it.... As a planet ages, any organisms upon it will share in\r\n    its development. They must evolve with it, indeed, or perish. At first\r\n    they change only, as environment offers opportunity, in a lowly,\r\n    unconscious way. But, as brain develops, they rise superior to such\r\n    occasioning.... The last stage in the expression of life upon a\r\n    planet's surface must be that just antecedent to its dying of\r\n    thirst.... With an intelligent population this inevitable end would be\r\n    long foreseen.... Both polar caps would be pressed into service in\r\n    order to utilize the whole available supply and also to accommodate\r\n    most easily the inhabitants of each hemisphere\" (pp. 204-11).\r\n\r\n    \"That intelligence should thus mutely communicate its existence to us\r\n    across the far reaches of space, itself remaining hid, appeals to all\r\n    that is highest and most far-reaching in man himself. More\r\n    satisfactory than strange this; for in no other way could the\r\n    habitation of the planet have been revealed. It simply shows again the\r\n    supremacy of mind.... Thus, not only do the observations we have\r\n    scanned lead us to the conclusion that Mars at this moment is\r\n    inhabited, but they land us at the further one that these denizens are\r\n    of an order whose acquaintance was worth the making\" (p. 215).\r\n\r\nFor the moment, let us leave Prof. Lowell's argument as he puts it.\r\nWhether we accept it or not, it remains that it is a marvellous\r\nachievement of the optician's skill and the observer's devotion that from\r\na planet so small and so distant as Mars any evidence should be\r\nforthcoming at all that could bear upon the question of the existence of\r\nintelligent organisms upon its surface. But it is of the utmost\r\nsignificance to note that the whole question turns upon the presence of\r\nwater--of water in the liquid state, of water in a sufficient quantity;\r\nand the final decision, for Mr. Lowell's contention, or against it, must\r\nturn on that one point. The search for Life on Mars is essentially a\r\nsearch for Water; a search for water, not only in the present state of\r\nMars, but in its past as well. For, without water in sufficient quantities\r\nin the past, life on Mars could not have passed through the evolutionary\r\ndevelopment necessary to its attaining its highest expression,--that where\r\nthe material living organism has become the tabernacle and instrument of\r\nthe conscious intelligent spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CONDITION OF MARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planet Mars is the debatable ground between two opinions. Here, the\r\ntwo opposing views join issue; the controversy comes to a focus. The point\r\nin debate is whether certain markings--some linear, some circular--are\r\nnatural or artificial. If, it is argued, some are truly like a line,\r\nwithout curve or break, as if drawn with pen, ink, and ruler; or others,\r\nso truly circular, without deviation or break, as if drawn with pen, ink,\r\nand compass; if, moreover, when we obtain more powerful telescopes,\r\nerected in better climates for observing, these markings become more truly\r\nlines and circles the better we see them; then they are _artificial_, not\r\nnatural structures.\r\n\r\nBut artificial structures imply artificers. And if the structures are so\r\ndesigned as to meet the needs of a living organism, it implies that the\r\nliving organism that designed them must have a reasonable mind lodged in a\r\nnatural body. If, then, the \"lines\" and \"circles\" that Prof. Lowell and\r\nhis disciples assert to be artificial canals and oases are really such,\r\nthey premise the order of being that we call Man. But these canals and\r\noases also premise the liquid that we call Water--water that flows and\r\nwater utilized in cultivation. In this chapter we will leave out of count\r\nthe first premiss--Man--and only deal with what concerns the second\r\npremiss--Water; with water that flows and is utilized in vegetation.\r\n\r\nPLANETARY STATISTICS\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------++--------++----------------\r\n  |                                            || Minor  ||          Inner\r\n  |                                            ||Planets.||\r\n  +--------------------------------------------++--------++-------+-------+\r\n  |                                            || Ceres  || Moon  |Mercury|\r\n  +--------------------------------------------++--------++-------+-------+\r\n  |PROPORTIONS OF THE PLANETS:--               ||        ||       |       |\r\n  | Diameter in miles                          ||   477  || 2163  | 3030  |\r\n  |     \"    [Symbol] = 1                      ||  0.06  || 0.273 | 0.383 |\r\n  | Surface, [Symbol] = 1                      ||  0.004 || 0.075 | 0.147 |\r\n  | Volume,  [Symbol] = 1                      ||  0.0002|| 0.02  | 0.06  |\r\n  | Density, Water = 1                         ||  2.8 ?

As the foregoing\r\nTable shows, it comes between the Moon and the Earth in these respects.\r\n\r\nThe figures show at a glance that Mars ranks in its dimensions between the\r\nMoon and the Earth, and that, on the whole, it is more like to the Moon\r\nthan it is to the Earth.\r\n\r\nBut in what way would this affect Mars as a suitable home for life? In\r\nmany ways; and amongst these the distribution of its atmosphere and the\r\nsluggishness of its atmospheric circulation are not the least important.\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned in Chapter III that at a height of about three and a\r\nthird miles the barometer will stand at 15 inches, or half its mean height\r\nat sea level, showing that one half the atmosphere has been passed\r\nthrough. Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Europe, is under 3 miles in\r\nheight, so that it is not possible, in Europe, to climb to the level of\r\nhalf-pressure; Mt. Everest, the highest mountain in the world, is not\r\nquite six miles high, so that no part of the solid substance of our planet\r\nreaches up to the level of the quarter pressure. On a very few occasions\r\ndaring aeronauts have soared into the empyrean higher than the summits of\r\neven our loftiest mountains, but the excursion has been a dangerous one,\r\nand they have with difficulty brought their life back from so rare and\r\ncold, so inhospitable a region. When Gay-Lussac, in 1804, attained a\r\nheight of 23,000 feet above sea level, the thermometer, which on the\r\nground read 31 deg. C., sank to 9 deg. below zero, and the rare atmosphere was so\r\ndry that paper crumpled up as if it had been placed near the fire, and his\r\npulse rose to 120 pulsations a minute instead of his normal 66. When Mr.\r\nGlaisher and Mr. Coxwell made their celebrated ascent between 1 and 2\r\no'clock on the afternoon of September 5, 1861, they found that at a height\r\nof 21,000 feet the temperature sank to -10.4 deg.; at 26,000 feet to -15.2 deg.;\r\nand at 39,000 feet the temperature was down to -16.0 deg. C. At this height\r\nthe rarefaction of the air was so great and the cold so intense that Mr.\r\nGlaisher fainted, and Mr. Coxwell's hands being rendered numb and useless\r\nby the cold, he was only able to bring about their descent in time by\r\npulling the string of the safety valve with his teeth. Yet when they\r\nattained this height they were far above all cloud or mist, and the Sun's\r\nrays fell full upon them. The Sun's rays had all the force that they had\r\nat the surface of the Earth, but in the rare atmosphere of seven miles\r\nabove the Earth, the radiation from every particle not in direct sunlight\r\nwas so great that while the right hand, exposed to the Sun, might burn,\r\nthe left hand, protected from his direct rays, might freeze.\r\n\r\nBut gravity at the surface of Mars is much feebler than at the surface of\r\nthe Earth, and in order to reach the level of half-pressure a Martian\r\nmountaineer would have to climb, not three and a third miles, but eight\r\nand three-quarter miles; that is to say, the distance to be ascended is in\r\nthe inverse proportion of the force of gravity at the surface of the\r\nplanet. The atmosphere of Mars, therefore, is much deeper than that of the\r\nEarth, and one great cause of precipitation here is much weakened there. A\r\ncurrent of air heavily laden with moisture, if it encounters a range of\r\nmountains, is forced upwards, and consequently expands, owing to the\r\ndiminished pressure. The expansion brings about a cooling, and from both\r\ncauses the atmosphere is unable to retain as much water-vapour as it\r\ncarried before. On Mars, the same relative expansion and cooling would\r\nonly follow if the ascent were nearly three times as great, and the feeble\r\nforce of gravity has its effect in another way; for just as a weight on\r\nMars will only fall six feet in the first second as against sixteen on\r\nthe Earth, so a dense and heavy column of air will fall with proportionate\r\nslowness and a light column ascend in the same languid manner. An\r\nascending current on Mars would therefore take 1/0.38 x 1/0.38 = 1/0.145,\r\nor seven times as long to attain the same relative expansion as on the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nThe winds of Mars are therefore sluggish, and precipitation is slight. So\r\nfar at least it resembles\r\n\r\n  \"The island valley of Avilion;\r\n  Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,\r\n  Nor ever wind blows loudly;\"\r\n\r\nand R. A. Proctor, acute and accurate writer on planetary physics as he\r\nwas, fell into a mistake when he referred to Mars as being\r\n\"hurricane-swept.\" There are no hurricanes on Mars; its fiercest winds can\r\nnever exceed in violence what a sailor would call a \"capful.\"\r\n\r\nThis holds good for Mars, but it also holds good for every planet where\r\nthe force of gravity at the surface is relatively feeble. The greater the\r\nforce of gravity the more active the atmospheric circulation, and more\r\nviolent its disturbances; the feebler the action of gravity the more\r\nlanguid the circulation, and the slighter the disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Mars is relatively deeper than that of the Earth, so\r\nthat we, in observing the details of its surface, are looking down through\r\nan immense thickness of an obscuring medium. And yet the details of the\r\nsurface are seen with remarkable distinctness; not as clearly indeed as we\r\ncan see those of the Moon, but nearly so. For instance, the \"canals\"\r\nappear to have a breadth of from 15 to 20 miles, corresponding to 1/16th,\r\nand 1/12th, of a second of arc, at an average opposition. The oases, as a\r\nrule, are about 120 miles in diameter, that is to say about half a second\r\nof arc. These are extraordinarily fine details to be perceived and held,\r\neven if Mars had no atmosphere at all; it would certainly be impossible to\r\ndetect them unless the atmosphere were exceedingly thin and transparent.\r\nFor we must remember that, though our own atmosphere is a hindrance to our\r\nobserving, yet the atmosphere of the planet into which we are looking is a\r\ngreater hindrance still. Like the lace curtains of the window of a house,\r\nit is a much greater obstacle to looking inward than to looking outward,\r\nand as the perfect distinctness with which we see the Moon is a proof that\r\nit is practically without an atmosphere, so the great detail visible on\r\nMars bears unmistakable testimony to the slightness of the atmospheric\r\nveil around that planet.\r\n\r\nAnd when we turn again to the statistics of Mars, we see that this must\r\ninevitably be the case. Of two planets, one heavier than the other, it is\r\nnot possible to suppose that the lighter should secure the greater\r\nproportional amount of atmosphere. With planets, as with persons, it is\r\nthe most powerful that gets the lion's share: \"to him that hath it is\r\ngiven, and from him that hath not is taken away even that which he seemeth\r\nto have.\" But if we assume that Mars has acquired an atmosphere\r\nproportional to its mass, then we see from the Table that this must be a\r\nlittle less than 1/9th of that of the Earth; exactly 0.107. It is\r\ndistributed over a smaller surface, 0.285. Consequently the amount of air\r\nabove each square inch of Martian surface is 0.107 / 0.285 = 0.38. But\r\nsince the force of gravity at the surface of Mars is less than on the\r\nEarth, this column of air will only weigh 0.38 x 0.38 = 0.145; or\r\none-seventh of the column of air resting on a square inch of the Earth's\r\nsurface. The pressure at the surface of Mars will therefore be 2.1 lb.;\r\nand the aneroid barometer would read 4.3 inches. (In order to express the\r\ndiminished pressure of the Martian atmosphere, it is necessary to refer it\r\nto the aneroid barometer. The mercury in a mercurial barometer, or the\r\nwater in a water barometer would lose in weight in consequence of the\r\ndiminished force of gravity in the same proportion as the air would, and\r\nthe mercurial barometer would read 11.4 inches.)\r\n\r\nBut a pressure of 2.1 lb. on the square inch is far less than that\r\nexperienced by Coxwell and Glaisher in their great ascent; it is about\r\none-half the pressure that is experienced on the top of the very highest\r\nterrestrial mountains. But the habitable regions of the Earth do not\r\nextend even so far upward as to the level of a pressure of 7.3 lb. on the\r\nsquare inch; that is, of half the terrestrial surface pressure. Plant life\r\ndies out before we reach that point, and though birds or men may\r\noccasionally attain greater heights, they cannot domicile there, and are,\r\nindeed, only able thus to ascend in virtue of nourishment which they have\r\nprocured in more favoured regions. If we could suppose the conditions of\r\nthe whole Earth changed to correspond with those prevailing at the summit\r\nof Mt. Everest, or even at the summit of Mont Blanc, it is clear that the\r\nlife now present on this planet would be extinguished, and that speedily.\r\nMuch more would this be the case if the atmosphere were diminished to one\r\nhalf the pressure on the summit of the highest earthly mountain.\r\n\r\nThe tenuity of the atmosphere on Mars has another consequence. Here water\r\nfreezes at 0 deg. C. and boils at 100 deg. C.; so that for one hundred degrees it\r\nremains in a liquid condition. On Mars, under the assumed conditions,\r\nwater would boil at 53 deg. C., and the range of temperature within which it\r\nwould be liquid would be much curtailed. But it is only water in the\r\nliquid state that is useful for sustaining life.\r\n\r\nThe above estimate of the density of the atmosphere of Mars is an outside\r\nlimit, for it assumes that Mars has retained an atmosphere to the full\r\nproportion of its mass. But as the molecules of a gas are in continual\r\nmotion, and in every direction, the lighter, most swiftly moving molecules\r\nmust occasionally be moving directly outwards from the planet at the top\r\nof their speed, and in this case, if the speed of recession should exceed\r\nthat which the gravity of the planet can control, the particle is lost to\r\nthe planet for ever. A small planet therefore is subject to a continual\r\ndrain upon its atmosphere, a drain of the lightest constituents. Hence it\r\nis, no doubt, that free hydrogen is not a constituent of the atmosphere of\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\nTo what extent, then, has the atmosphere of Mars fallen below its full\r\nproportion? Mr. Lowell has adopted an ingenious method of obtaining some\r\nlight on this question, by comparing the relative albedoes of the Earth\r\nand Mars; that is to say the relative power of reflection possessed by the\r\ntwo planets. Of course the method is rough; we have first of all no\r\nsatisfactory means of determining the albedo of the Earth itself, and Mr.\r\nLowell puts it higher than most astronomers would do; then there is the\r\ndifficulty of determining what portion of the total albedo is to be\r\nreferred to the atmosphere and what to the actual soil or surface of the\r\nplanet. But, on the whole, Mr. Lowell concludes that the amount of\r\natmosphere above the unit of surface of Mars is 0.222 of that above the\r\nunit of surface of the Earth. This would bring down the pressure on each\r\nsquare inch of Mars to 1.2 lb., and the aneroid barometer would read 2.5\r\ninches; and water would boil at 44 deg. C. The range of temperature from day\r\nto night, from summer to winter, at any place on the planet would be\r\nincreased, while the range within which water could retain its liquid form\r\nwould be diminished.\r\n\r\nThese statistics may seem rather dull and tiresome, but if we are to deal\r\nwith the problem before us at all, it is important to understand that one\r\nfactor in the condition of a planet cannot be altered and all the other\r\nfactors retained unchanged. It will be seen that in computing the density\r\nof the atmosphere of Mars, we had to take into consideration not only the\r\ndiameter of the planet, but the surface, which varies as the square of the\r\ndiameter; the volume, which varies as the cube; the mass, which varies in\r\na higher power still; and various combinations of these numbers. Novelists\r\nwho write tales of journeys to other worlds or of the inhabitants of other\r\nworlds visiting this one, usually assume that the atmosphere is of the\r\nsame density on all planets, and the action of gravity unchanged. In their\r\nview it is only that men would have a little less ground to walk upon on\r\nMars, and a good deal more on Jupiter. Dean Swift, in _Gulliver's\r\nTravels_, made the Lilliputians take a truer view of the effect of the\r\nalteration of one dimension, for, finding that Gulliver was twelve times\r\nas tall as the average Lilliputian, they did not appoint him the rations\r\nof twelve Lilliputians, which would have been rather poor feeding for\r\nthat veracious mariner, but allotted him the cube of twelve, viz.\r\nseventeen hundred and twenty-eight rations. Mr. J. Holt Schooling, in one\r\nof his ingenious and interesting statistical papers, tried to bring home\r\nthe vast extent of the British Empire by supposing that it seceded, and\r\ntaking the portion of Earth that has fallen to it, set up a world of its\r\nown--the planet \"Victoria.\" He allots to the British Empire 21 per cent of\r\nthe land surface of the world. If the Earth were divided so as to form two\r\nglobes with surfaces in proportion of 21 to 79, the smaller globe, which\r\nwould correspond to Mr. Schooling's new planet \"Victoria,\" would be less\r\nthan half the present Earth in diameter; it would be considerably smaller\r\nthan Mars. But \"the rest of the world\" would be 0.96 of the present Earth\r\nin diameter, or very nearly the size of Venus, and it would contain just\r\neight-ninths of the substance of the Earth, leaving only one-ninth for\r\n\"Victoria.\" The statistics given above will suggest to the reader that,\r\ncould such a secession be carried out, the inhabitants of the British\r\nEmpire would not be happier for the change during the very short continued\r\nexistence that remained to them. The \"rest of the world\" could spare our\r\nfraction of the planet much better than we could spare theirs.\r\n\r\nThis is a principle which applies to worlds anywhere; not merely within\r\nthe limits of the solar system but wherever they exist. Everywhere the\r\nsurface must vary with the square of the diameter; the volume with the\r\ncube; everywhere the smaller planet must have the rarer atmosphere, and\r\nwith a rare atmosphere the extreme range of temperature must be great,\r\nwhile the range of temperature within which water will flow will be\r\nrestricted. Our Earth stands as the model of a world of the right size for\r\nthe maintenance of life; much smaller than our Earth would be too small;\r\nmuch larger, as we shall see later, would be too large.\r\n\r\nSo far we have dealt with Mars as if it received the same amount of light\r\nand heat from the Sun that the Earth does. But, as the Table shows, from\r\nits greater distance from the Sun, Mars receives per unit of surface only\r\nabout three-sevenths of the light and heat of that received by the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe inclination of the axis of Mars is almost the same as that of the\r\nEarth, so that the general character of the seasons is not very different\r\non the two planets, and the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones have\r\nalmost the same proportions. The length of the day is also nearly the same\r\nfor both, the Martian day being slightly longer; but the most serious\r\nfactor is the greater distance of Mars, and the consequent diminution in\r\nthe light and heat received from the Sun. The light and heat received by\r\nthe Earth are not so excessive that we could be content to see them\r\ndiminished, even by 5 per cent, but for Mars they are diminished by 57 per\r\ncent. How can we judge the effect of so important a difference?\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of our Earth is supposed to be about 60 deg.F., or 16 deg.C.\r\nThree-sevenths of this would give us 7 deg.C. as the mean temperature of Mars,\r\nwhich would signify a planet not impossible for life. But the zero of the\r\nCentigrade scale is not the absolute zero; it only marks the\r\nfreezing-point of water. The absolute zero is computed to be -273 deg. on the\r\nCentigrade scale; the temperature of the Earth on the absolute scale\r\ntherefore should be taken as 289 deg., and three-sevenths of this would give\r\n124 deg. of absolute temperature. But this is 149 deg. below freezing-point, and\r\nno life could exist on a planet under such conditions.\r\n\r\nBut the mean temperature of Mars cannot be computed quite so easily. The\r\nhotter a body is the more rapidly it radiates heat; the cooler it is the\r\nslower its radiation. According to Stefan's Law, the radiation varies for\r\na perfect radiator with the 4th power of the absolute temperature; so that\r\nif Mars were at 124 deg. abs., while the Earth were at 289 deg. abs., the Earth\r\nwould be radiating its heat nearly 30 times faster than Mars. The heat\r\nincome of Mars would therefore be in a much higher proportion than its\r\nexpenditure; and necessarily its heat capital would increase until income\r\nand expenditure balanced. Prof. Poynting has made the temperature of the\r\nplanets under the 4th power law of radiation the subject of an interesting\r\nenquiry, and the figures which he has obtained for Mars and other planets\r\nare included in the Table.\r\n\r\nThe equatorial and average temperatures are given under the assumption\r\nthat Mars possesses an atmosphere as efficient as our own in equalizing\r\nthe temperature of the whole planet. If, on the other hand, its atmosphere\r\nhas no such regulating power, then under the zenith Sun the upper limit of\r\nthe temperature of a portion of its surface reflecting one-eighth would\r\nbe, as shown in the Table, 64 deg.C. This would imply that the temperature on\r\nthe dark side of the planet was very nearly at the absolute zero. \"If we\r\nregard Mars as resembling our Moon, and take the Moon's effective average\r\ntemperature as 297 deg. abs., the corresponding temperature for Mars is 240 deg.\r\nabs., and the highest temperature is four-fifths of 337 deg. = 270 deg. abs. But\r\nthe surface of Mars has probably a higher coefficient of absorption than\r\nthe surface of the Moon--it certainly has for light--so that we may put\r\nhis effective average temperature, on this supposition, some few degrees\r\nabove 240 deg. abs., and his equatorial temperature some degrees higher still.\r\nIt appears as exceedingly probable, then, that whether we regard Mars as\r\nlike the Earth or, going to the other extreme, as like the Moon, the\r\ntemperature of his surface is everywhere below the freezing-point of\r\nwater.\"[14] As the atmospheric circulation on Mars must be languid, and\r\nthe atmosphere itself is very rare, the general condition of the planet\r\nwill approximate rather to the lunar type than to the terrestrial, and the\r\nextremes, both of heat and cold, will approach those which would prevail\r\non a planet without a regulating atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThere is another way of considering the effect on the climate of Mars and\r\nits great distance from the Sun, which, though only rough and crude, may\r\nbe helpful to some readers. If we take the Earth at noonday at the time of\r\nthe equinox, then a square yard at the equator has the Sun in its zenith,\r\nand is fully presented to its light and heat. But, as we move away from\r\nthe equator, we find that each higher latitude is less fully presented to\r\nthe Sun, until, when we reach latitude 64-1/2 deg.--in other words just\r\noutside the Arctic Circle--7 square yards are presented to the Sun so as\r\nto receive only as much of the solar radiation as 3 square yards receive\r\nat the equator. We may take, then, latitude 64-1/2 deg. as representing Mars,\r\nwhile the equator represents the Earth. Or, we may take it that we should\r\ncompare the climate of Archangel with the climate of Singapore.\r\n\r\nNow the mean temperature of latitude 64-1/2 deg., say the latitude of\r\nArchangel, is just about freezing-point (0 deg.C.), while that of the equator\r\nis about 28 deg.C. We should therefore expect from this a difference between\r\nthe mean temperatures of the Earth and Mars of 28 deg.; that is to say, as the\r\nEarth stands at 16 deg.C, Mars would be at -12 deg.C. But, on the Earth, the\r\nevaporation and precipitation is great, and the atmospheric circulation\r\nvigorous. Evaporation is always going on in equatorial regions, and the\r\nmoisture-laden winds are continually moving polewards, carrying with them\r\nvast stores of heat to be liberated as the rain falls. The oceanic\r\ncurrents have the same effect, and how great the modification which they\r\nintroduce may be seen by comparing the climates of Labrador and Scotland.\r\nThere appear to be no great oceans on Mars. The difference of 28 deg. which we\r\nfind on the Earth between the equator and the edge of the Arctic Circle is\r\na difference which remains after the convection currents of air and sea\r\nhave done much to reduce the temperature of the equator and to raise that\r\nof high latitudes. If we suppose that their effect has been to reduce this\r\ndifference to one half of what it would have been were each latitude\r\nisolated from the rest, we shall not be far wrong, and we should get a\r\nrange of 56 deg. as the true equivalent difference between the mean\r\ntemperatures of Singapore and Archangel; i.e. of the Earth and Mars; and\r\nMars would stand at -40 deg.C. The closeness with which this figure agrees\r\nwith that reached by Prof. Poynting suggests that it is a fair\r\napproximation to the correct figure.\r\n\r\nThe size of Mars taught us that we have in it a planet with an atmosphere\r\nof but one half the density of that prevailing on the top of our highest\r\nmountain; the distance of Mars from the Sun showed us that it must have a\r\nmean temperature close to that of freezing mercury. What chance would\r\nthere be for life on a world the average condition of which would\r\ncorrespond to that of a terrestrial mountain top, ten miles high and in\r\nthe heart of the polar regions? But Mars in the telescope does not look\r\nlike a cold planet. As we look at it, and note its bright colour, the\r\nsmall extent of the white caps presumed to be snow, and the high latitudes\r\nin which the dark markings--presumed to be water or vegetation--are seen,\r\nit seems difficult to suppose that the mean temperature of the planet is\r\nlower than that of the Earth. Thus on the wonderful photographs taken by\r\nProf. Barnard in 1909, the Nilosyrtis with the Protonilus is seen as a\r\ndark canal. Now the Protonilus is in North Lat. 42 deg., and on the date of\r\nobservation--September 28, 1909--the winter solstice of the northern\r\nhemisphere of Mars was just past. There would be nothing unusual for the\r\nground to be covered with snow and the water to be frozen in a\r\ncorresponding latitude if in a continental situation on the Earth. Then,\r\nagain, in the summer, the white polar caps of Mars diminish to a far\r\ngreater extent than the snow and ice caps of the Earth; indeed, one of the\r\nMartian caps has been known to disappear completely.\r\n\r\nYet, as the accompanying diagram will show, something of this kind is\r\nprecisely what we ought to expect to see. The diagram has been constructed\r\nin the following manner: A curve of mean temperatures has been laid down\r\nfor every 10 deg. of latitude on the Earth, derived as far as possible from\r\naccepted isothermals in continental countries in the northern hemisphere.\r\nFrom this curve ordinates have been drawn at each 10 deg., upward to show\r\naverage deviation from the mean temperature for the hottest part of the\r\nday in summer, downward for the deviation for the coldest part of the\r\nnight in winter. Obviously, on the average, the range from maximum to\r\nminimum will increase from the equator to the poles. The mean temperature\r\nof the Earth has been taken as 16 deg.C, and as representing that prevailing\r\nin about 42 deg. lat. The diagram shows that the maximum temperature of no\r\nplace upon the Earth's surface approaches the boiling-point of water, and\r\nthat it is only within the polar circle that the mean temperature is below\r\nfreezing-point. Water, therefore, on the Earth must be normally in the\r\nliquid state.\r\n\r\nIn constructing a similar diagram for Mars, three modifications have to be\r\nmade. First of all, the mean temperature of the planet must be\r\nconsiderably lower than that of the Earth. Next, since the atmospheric\r\ncirculation is languid and there are no great oceans, the temperatures of\r\ndifferent latitudes cannot be equalized to the same extent as on the\r\nEarth. It follows, therefore, that the range in mean temperature from\r\nequator to pole must be considerably greater on Mars than on the Earth.\r\nThirdly, the range in temperature in any latitude, from the hottest part\r\nof the day in summer to the coldest part of the night in winter, must be\r\nmuch greater than with us; partly on account of the very slight density of\r\nthe atmosphere, and partly on account of the length of the Martian year.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THERMOGRAPHS OF THE EARTH AND MARS]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot know the exact figures to adopt, but the general type of the\r\nthermograph for Mars as compared with that of the Earth will remain. The\r\nmean temperature of Mars will be lower, the range of temperature from\r\nequator to pole will be greater, and the extremes of temperature in any\r\ngiven latitude more pronounced than upon the Earth. And the general lesson\r\nof the diagram may be summed up in a sentence. The maximum temperature on\r\nthe planet is well above freezing-point, and the part of the planet at\r\nmaximum temperature is precisely the part that we see the best. But while\r\nthis is so, it is clear that water on Mars must normally be in the state\r\nof ice; Mars is essentially a frozen planet; and the extremes of cold\r\nexperienced there, not only every year but every night, far transcend the\r\nbitterest extremes of our own polar regions.\r\n\r\nThe above considerations do not appear to render it likely that there is\r\nany vegetation on Mars. A planet ice-bound every night and with its mean\r\ntemperature considerably below freezing-point does not seem promising for\r\nvegetation. If vegetation exists, it must be of a kind that can pass\r\nthrough all the stages of its life-history during the few bright hours of\r\nthe Martian day. Every night will be for it a winter, a winter of\r\nundescribable frost, which it could only endure in the form of spores. So\r\nif there be vegetation it must be confined to some hardy forms of a low\r\ntype. At a distance of forty millions of miles it is not easy to\r\ndiscriminate between the darkness of sheets of water and the darkness of\r\nstretches of vegetation. Some of the so-called \"seas\" may possibly be\r\nreally of the latter class, but that there must be expanses of water on\r\nthe planet is clear, for if there were no water surfaces there would be no\r\nevaporation; and if there were no evaporation from whence could come the\r\nsupply of moisture that builds up the winter pole cap?\r\n\r\nThe great American astronomer, Prof. Newcomb, gave in _Harper's Weekly_\r\nfor July 25, 1908, an admirable summary of the verdict of science as to\r\nthe character of the meteorology of Mars. \"The most careful calculation\r\nshows that if there are any considerable bodies of water on our\r\nneighbouring planet they exist in the form of ice, and can never be\r\nliquid to a depth of more than one or two inches, and that only within the\r\ntorrid zone and during a few hours each day.... There is no evidence that\r\nsnow like ours ever forms around the poles of Mars. It does not seem\r\npossible that any considerable fall of such snow could ever take place,\r\nnor is there any necessity of supposing actual snow or ice to account for\r\nthe white caps. At a temperature vastly below any ever felt in Siberia,\r\nthe smallest particles of moisture will be condensed into what we call\r\nhoar frost, and will glisten with as much whiteness as actual snow....\r\nThus we have a kind of Martian meteorological changes, very slight indeed\r\nand seemingly very different from those of our earth, but yet following\r\nsimilar lines on their small scale. For snowfall substitute frostfall;\r\ninstead of feet or inches say fractions of a millimetre, and instead of\r\nstorms or wind substitute little motions of an air thinner than that on\r\nthe top of the Himalayas, and we shall have a general description of\r\nMartian meteorology.\"\r\n\r\nWhat we know of Mars, then, shows us a planet, icebound every night, but\r\nwith a day temperature somewhat above freezing-point. As we see it, we\r\nlook upon its warmest regions, and the rapidity with which it is cleared\r\nof ice, snow, and cloud shows the atmosphere to be rare and the moisture\r\nlittle in amount and readily evaporated. The seas are probably shallow\r\ndepressions, filled with ice to the bottom, but melted as to their\r\nsurfaces by day. From the variety of tints noted in the seas, and the\r\nrecurrent changes in their outlines, they are composed of congeries of\r\nshallow pools, fed by small sluggish streams; great ocean basins into\r\nwhich great rivers discharge themselves are quite unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ILLUSIONS OF MARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two preceding chapters have led to two opposing, two incompatible\r\nconclusions. In Chapter VI, a summary was given of Prof. Lowell's claim to\r\nhave had ocular demonstration of the handiwork of intelligent organisms on\r\nMars. In Chapter VII, it was shown that the indispensable condition for\r\nliving organisms, water in the liquid state, is only occasionally present\r\nthere, the general temperature being much below freezing-point, so that\r\nliving organisms of high development and more than ephemeral existence are\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nProf. Lowell argues that the appearance of the network of lines and spots\r\nformed by the canals and oases, and its regular behaviour, \"preclude its\r\ncausation on such a scale by any natural process,\" his assumption being\r\nthat he has obtained finality in his seeing of the planet, and that no\r\nimprovement in telescopes, no increase in experience, no better eyesight\r\nwill ever break up the perfect regularity of form and position, which he\r\ngives to the canals, into finer and more complex detail.\r\n\r\nBut the history of our knowledge of the planet's surface teaches us a\r\ndifferent lesson. Two small objects appear repeatedly on the drawings\r\nmade by Beer and Maedler in 1830; these are two similar dark spots, the one\r\nisolated, the other at the end of a gently curved line. Both spots\r\nresemble in form and character the oases of Prof. Lowell, and the curved\r\nline, at the termination of which one of the spots appears, represents\r\nclosely the appearance presented by several of the canals. In the year\r\n1830 no better drawings of Mars had appeared; and in representing these\r\ntwo spots as truly circular and the curved line as narrow, sharp, and\r\nuniform, Beer and Maedler undoubtedly portrayed the planet as actually they\r\nsaw it. The one marking was named by Schiaparelli the Lacus Solis, the\r\nother, the Sinus Sabaeus, and they are two of the best known and most\r\neasily recognized of the planet's features; so that it is easy to trace\r\nthe growth of our knowledge of both of them from 1830 up to the present\r\ntime. They were drawn by Dawes in 1864, by Schiaparelli in 1877 and the\r\nsucceeding years, by Lowell in 1894 and since, and by Antoniadi in 1909\r\nand 1911. But whereas the drawings of Beer and Maedler, made by the aid of\r\na telescope of 4 inches aperture, show the two spots as exactly alike, in\r\nthose of Dawes, made with a telescope of 8 inches, the resemblance between\r\nthe two has entirely vanished, and neither is shown as a plain circular\r\ndot. Since then, observers of greater experience and equipped with more\r\npowerful instruments have directed their attention to these two objects,\r\nand a mass of complicated structure has been brought out in the regions\r\nwhich were so simple in the sight of Beer and Maedler, so that not a trace\r\nof resemblance remains between the two objects that to them appeared\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\nNow the gradation in size, from the Lacus Solis down to the smallest oasis\r\nof Lowell, is a complete one. If a future development in the power of\r\ntelescopes should equal the advance made from the 4-inch of Beer and\r\nMaedler, to the 33-inch which Antoniadi used in 1909, is it reasonable to\r\nsuppose that Prof. Lowell's oases will refuse to yield to such\r\nimprovement, and will all still show themselves as uniform spots,\r\nprecisely circular in outline? It is clear that Beer and Maedler would have\r\nbeen mistaken if they had argued that the apparently perfect circularity\r\nof the two oases which they observed proved them to be artificial, because\r\nthe increase in telescopic power has since shown us that neither is\r\ncircular. The obvious reason why they appeared so round to Beer and Maedler\r\nwas that they were too small to be defined in their instruments; their\r\nminor irregularities were therefore invisible, and their apparent\r\ncircularity covered detail of an altogether different form.\r\n\r\nBeer and Maedler only drew two such spots; Lowell shows about two hundred.\r\nBeer and Maedler's two spots seemed to them exactly alike; these two spots\r\nas we see them to-day have no resemblance to each other. Prof. Lowell's\r\ntwo hundred oases, with few exceptions, seem all of the same character; is\r\nit possible to suppose, if telescopes develop in the future as they have\r\ndone in the past, that the two hundred oases will preserve their\r\nuniformity of appearance any more than the Lacus Solis and the head of the\r\nSinus Sabaeus? If a novice begins to work upon Mars with a small telescope,\r\nhe will draw the Lacus Solis and the Sinus Sabaeus as two round, uniform\r\nspots, and as he gains experience, and his instrumental power is\r\nincreased, he will begin to detect detail in them, and draw them as Dawes\r\nand Schiaparelli and others have shown them later. It is no question of\r\nplanetary change; it is a question of experience and of \"seeing.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a much simpler explanation of the regularity of the canals and\r\noases than to suppose that an industrious population of geometers have dug\r\nthem out or planted them; it is connected with the nature of vision.\r\n\r\nA telegraph wire seen against a background of a bright cloud can be\r\ndiscerned at an amazing distance--in fact, at 200,000 times the breadth of\r\nthe wire; a distance at which the wire subtends a breadth of a second of\r\narc. For average normal sight the perception of the wire will be quite\r\nunmistakable, but at the same time it would be quite untrue to say that\r\nthe perception of the wire was of the nature of defined vision, as would\r\nbe seen at once if small objects of irregular shape were threaded on the\r\nwire; these would have to be many times the breadth of the wire in order\r\nto be detected. Again, if instead of a wire of very great length extending\r\nright across the field of view of both eyes, a short, black line be drawn\r\non a white ground, it will be found that as the length of the line is\r\ndiminished below a certain point so its breadth must be increased. If the\r\nobserver is distant from the line 6000 times its length, then the breadth\r\nmust be increased to be equal to the length, and the object, whatever its\r\nactual shape, can be just recognized as a small circular spot, which will\r\nsubtend about 34 seconds of arc.\r\n\r\nBut though a black spot, 34 seconds in diameter, can be perceived on a\r\nwhite ground, we have not yet attained to defined vision. For if we place\r\ntwo black spots each 34 seconds of arc in diameter, near each other, they\r\nwill not be seen as separate spots unless there is a clear space between\r\nthem of six times that amount. Nearer than that they will give the\r\nimpression that they form one circular spot, or an oval one, or even a\r\nuniform straight line, according to the amount of separation. If two equal\r\nround spots be placed so that the distance between their centres is equal\r\nto two diameters, then the diameter of each spot must be, at least, 70\r\nseconds of arc for them to be distinctly defined; that is to say for the\r\nspots to be seen as two separate objects.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there is a wide range between objects that are large\r\nenough to be quite unmistakably perceived, and objects which are large\r\nenough to have their true outline really defined. It is a question of\r\nseconds of arc in the one case and of minutes of arc in the other. Within\r\nthis range, between the limit at which objects can be just perceived and\r\nthat where they can be just defined, objects must all appear as of one of\r\ntwo forms--the straight line and the circular dot.\r\n\r\nThis depends upon the structure of the eye and of the retina; the eye\r\nbeing essentially a lens with its defining power necessarily limited by\r\nits aperture, and the retina a sensitive screen built up of an immense\r\nnumber of separate elements each of which can only transmit a single\r\nsensation. Different eyes will have different limits, both for the\r\nsmallest objects which can be discerned and for the smallest objects that\r\ncan be defined, but for any sight the range between the two will be of the\r\norder just indicated.\r\n\r\nProf. Lowell has drawn attention to the \"strangely economic character of\r\nboth the canals and oases in the matter of form.\" It is true that straight\r\nlines and circles are economic forms, but they are economic not only in\r\nthe construction of irrigation works but also in vision. \"The circle is\r\nthe figure which encloses the maximum area for the minimum average\r\ndistance from its centre to any point situated within it;\" therefore, if\r\na small spot be perceived by the sight but be too small to have its actual\r\noutline defined, it will be recognized by the eye as being truly circular,\r\non the principle of economy of effort. So, again, a straight line is the\r\nshortest that can be drawn between two points; and a straight line can be\r\nperceived as such when of an angular breadth quite 40 times less than that\r\nof the smallest spot. A straight line is that which gives the least total\r\nexcitement in order to produce an appreciable impression, and therefore\r\nthe smallest appreciable impression produces the effect of a straight\r\nline.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient, then, for us to suppose that the surface of Mars is\r\ndotted over with minute irregular markings, with a tendency to aggregate\r\nin certain directions, such as would naturally arise in the process of the\r\ncooling of a planet when the outer crust was contracting above an\r\nunyielding nucleus. If these markings are fairly near each other it is not\r\nnecessary, in order to produce the effect of \"canals,\" that they should be\r\nindividually large enough to be seen. They may be of any conceivable\r\nshape, provided that they are separately below the limit of defined\r\nvision, and are sufficiently sparsely scattered. In this case the eye\r\ninevitably sums up the details (which it recognizes but cannot resolve)\r\ninto lines essentially \"canal-like\" in character. Wherever there is a\r\nsmall aggregation of these minute markings, an impression will be given\r\nof a circular spot, or, to use Prof. Lowell's nomenclature, an \"oasis.\" If\r\nthe aggregation be greater still and more extended, we shall have a shaded\r\narea--a \"sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe above remarks apply to observation with the unaided eye, but the same\r\nprinciple applies yet more strongly to telescopic vision. No star is near\r\nenough or sufficiently large to give the least impression of a true disc;\r\nits diameter is indistinguishable; it is for us a mathematical point,\r\n\"without parts or magnitude.\" But the image of a star formed by a\r\ntelescope is not a point but a minute disc, surrounded by a series of\r\ndiffraction rings. This disc is \"spurious,\" for the greater the aperture\r\nof the telescope the smaller the apparent disc.\r\n\r\nThat which holds good for a bright point like a star holds good for every\r\nindividual point of a planetary surface when viewed through the telescope;\r\nthat is to say, each point is represented by a minute disc; all lines and\r\noutlines therefore are slightly blurred, so that minute irregularities are\r\ninevitably smoothed out.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to photographs, the process is carried to a third stage. The\r\nimage is formed by the telescope, subject to all the limitations of\r\ntelescopic images, and is received on a plate essentially granular in\r\nstructure, and is finally examined by the eye. The granular structure of\r\nthe plate acts as the third factor in concealing irregularities and\r\nsimplifying details; a third factor in producing the two simplest types of\r\nform--the straight line and the circular dot.\r\n\r\nProf. Lowell describes the canals as like lines drawn with pen, ink and\r\nruler, but not a few of our best observers have advanced much beyond this\r\nstage. Even as far back as 1884, some of the canals were losing their\r\nstrict rectilinear appearance to Schiaparelli, and the observers of the\r\nplanet who have been best favoured by the power of the telescope at their\r\ndisposal, by the atmospheric conditions under which they worked, and by\r\ntheir own skill and experience--such as Antoniadi, Barnard, Cerulli,\r\nDenning, Millochau, Molesworth, Phillips, Stanley Williams and\r\nothers--have found them to show evident signs of resolution. Thus, in\r\n1909, Antoniadi found that of 50 canals, 14 were resolved into\r\ndisconnected knots of diffused shadings, 4 were seen as irregular lines,\r\n10 as more or less dark bands; and he found that, in good seeing, there\r\nwas no trace whatever of the geometrical network.\r\n\r\nThe progress of observation, therefore, has left Prof. Lowell behind, and\r\nhas dispelled the fable which he has defended with so much ingenuity. But,\r\nindeed, there never was any more reason for taking seriously his theory as\r\nto the presence of artificial waterways on Mars than for believing in the\r\nactual existence of the weird creatures described by H. G. Wells in the\r\n_War of the Worlds_.\r\n\r\nThere are too many oversights in the canal theory.\r\n\r\nThus no source is indicated for the moisture supposed to be locked up in\r\nthe winter pole cap. Prof. Lowell holds that there are no large bodies of\r\nwater on the planet; that the so-called seas are really cultivated land.\r\nIn this case there could be little or no evaporation, and so no means by\r\nwhich the polar deposits could be recruited.\r\n\r\nYet it is certain that the supply of the winter pole cap must come from\r\nthe evaporation of water in some region or other. And here is another\r\noversight of the artificial canal theory. The canals are supposed to be\r\nnecessary for the conveyance of water from the pole towards the equator;\r\nalthough, as this was \"uphill,\" vast pumping stations at short intervals\r\nhad to be predicated. But it is not supposed that the water needed to\r\ntravel by way of the canals to the poles. If, however, the moisture is\r\nconveyed as vapour through the atmosphere to the pole as winter\r\napproaches, it cannot be impossible that it should be conveyed in the same\r\nmanner from the pole as summer draws on, and in that case the artificial\r\ncanals would not be needed. If the canals are necessary for conveying the\r\nwater in one direction, they would be necessary for the opposite\r\ndirection. But there would be something too farcical in the idea of the\r\ncareful Martians dispatching their water first to the pole to be frozen\r\nthere, and then, after it had been duly frozen and melted again, fetching\r\nit back along thousands of miles and through numerous pumping stations for\r\nuse in irrigating their fields.\r\n\r\nOf all the many hundreds of canals only a few actually touch the polar\r\ncaps. But on the theory that the entire canal system is fed by the polar\r\ncap in summer, the carrying capacity of the polar canals should be equal\r\nto, if not greater than, that of the entire system outside the polar\r\ncircle. A glance at the charts of the planet shows that the polar canals\r\ncould not supply a twentieth part of the water needed for those in the\r\nequatorial regions. Another oversight is that of the significance of the\r\nalleged uniformity and breadth of the canals. Prof. Lowell repeatedly\r\ninsists that the canals are of even breadth from end to end, and spring\r\ninto existence at once throughout their whole length. This statement is in\r\nitself a proof that the canals cannot be what he supposes them to be. An\r\nirrigation system could not have these characteristics; the region\r\nfertilized would take time to develop; we should see the canal extending\r\nitself gradually across the continent, and its breadth would not be\r\nuniform from end to end, but the region fertilized would grow narrower\r\nwith increase of distance from the fountain head of the canal.\r\n\r\nUnder what conditions can we see straight lines, perfectly uniform from\r\nend to end, spring into existence, in their entirety, without going\r\nthrough any stages of growth? When the lines are not actual images, but\r\nare suggested by markings perceived, but not perfectly defined. In 1902\r\nand 1903, in conjunction with Mr. Evans, the headmaster of Greenwich\r\nHospital School, I tried a number of experiments on this point, with the\r\naid of about two hundred of the boys of the school. They had several\r\nqualifications in respect of these experiments; they were keen-sighted,\r\nwell drilled; accustomed to do what they were told without asking\r\nquestions; and they knew nothing whatsoever of astronomy, certainly\r\nnothing about Mars.\r\n\r\nA diagram was hung up, based upon some drawing or other of the planet made\r\nby Schiaparelli, Lowell or other Martian observer, but the canals were not\r\ninserted; only a few dots or irregular markings were put in here and\r\nthere. And the boys were arranged at different distances from the diagram\r\nand told to draw exactly what they saw. Those nearest the diagram were\r\nable to detect the little irregular markings and represented them under\r\ntheir true forms. Those at the back of the room could not see anything of\r\nthem, and only represented the broadest features of the diagram, the\r\ncontinents and seas. Those in the middle of the room were too far off to\r\ndefine the minute markings, but were near enough for those markings to\r\nproduce some impression upon them; and that impression always was of a\r\nnetwork of straight lines, sometimes with dots at the points of meeting.\r\nAdvancing from a distance toward the diagram the process of development\r\nbecame quite clear. At the back of the room no straight lines were seen;\r\nas the observer came slowly forward, first one straight line would appear\r\ncompletely, then another, and so on, until all the chief canals drawn by\r\nSchiaparelli and Lowell in the region represented had come into evidence\r\nin their proper places. Advancing still further, the canals disappeared,\r\nand the little irregular markings which had given rise to them were\r\nperceived in their true forms.\r\n\r\nThese experiments at the Greenwich Hospital School were merely the\r\nrepetition of similar ones that I had myself made privately twelve years\r\nearlier, leading me to the conclusion, published in 1894, that the canals\r\nof Mars were simply the summation of a complexity of detail too minute to\r\nbe separately discerned.\r\n\r\nA little later, in his work \"_Marte nel 1896-7_,\" Dr. Cerulli\r\nindependently arrived at the same conclusion, and wrote: \"These lines are\r\nformed by the eye ... which utilizes ... the dark elements which it finds\r\nalong certain directions\"; and \"a large number of these elements forms a\r\nbroad band\"; and \"a smaller number of them gives rise to a narrow line.\"\r\nAlso, \"the marvellous appearance of the lines in question has its origin,\r\nnot in the reality of the thing, but in the inability of the present\r\ntelescope to show faithfully such a reality.\" In 1907, Prof. Newcomb made\r\nsome experiments in the same direction and reached the same general\r\nconclusion. More recently still, Prof. W. H. Pickering has worked on the\r\nsame lines and with the same result. The venerable George Pollock,\r\nformerly the Senior Master of the Supreme Court and King's Remembrancer,\r\nsent to me, in his 91st year, the following note as affording an apt\r\nillustration of the true nature of the canaliform markings on Mars:\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday last, journeying in a motor-car, I came into a broad road\r\nbounded by a dark wood. Looking up I was amazed to see distinct,\r\nwell-defined, vertical, parallel white lines, the wood forming the dark\r\nbackground. On getting nearer, these lines resolved themselves into spots,\r\nand they proved to be the white insulators supporting the telegraph\r\nwires.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Lowell has objected that all experiments and illustrations of this\r\nkind are irrelevant; only observations upon the planet itself ought to be\r\ntaken into account.\r\n\r\nBut such observations have been made upon the planet itself with just the\r\nsame result. Observers have seen streaks upon Mars--knotted, broken,\r\nirregular, full of detail--and when the planet has receded to a greater\r\ndistance, the very same marking has shown itself as a narrow straight\r\nline, uniform from end to end, as if drawn with pen, ink and ruler. The\r\ngreater distance has caused the irregularities, seen when nearer at hand,\r\nto disappear. In this, and not in any gigantic engineering works, is the\r\nexplanation of the artificiality of the markings on Mars as Prof. Lowell\r\nsees them. That artificiality has already disappeared under better seeing\r\nwith more powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\nThis chapter is entitled \"The Illusions of Mars.\" Yet the illusions of\r\nMars are not the straight lines and round dots of the canal system, but\r\nthe forced and curious interpretation which has been put upon them. If the\r\nplanet be within a certain range of distance and under examination with a\r\ncertain telescopic power, the straight lines and round dots are\r\ninevitable. Their artificiality is not a function of the actual Martian\r\ndetails themselves, but of the mode in which, under given conditions, we\r\nare obliged to see them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nVENUS, MERCURY AND THE ASTEROIDS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the planets, Venus appears, to the unassisted eye, by far the\r\nloveliest. When seen in the early morning before sunrise--its \"western\r\nelongation\"--or after sundown in the evening--its \"eastern\r\nelongation\"--and still more as it attains its greatest brilliancy, it has\r\nattracted attention everywhere and in all ages. It then shines with\r\nbrilliance ten times as great as Jupiter in opposition, and the brightest\r\nmembers of the heavenly host look pale and dim beside it. It is\r\nemphatically the morning or the evening star, Lucifer, or Vesper, herald\r\nor follower of the Sun; it can even assert itself in the presence of the\r\nLord of Day, for it has often been seen at noonday by watchers who knew\r\nwhere to look; sometimes by the general crowd.\r\n\r\nBut in the telescope Venus appears less satisfying. It is a pretty\r\nspectacle indeed to watch the phases of the gleaming little globe of\r\nsilver, for, like the Moon under varying illumination from the Sun, it\r\nundergoes change of apparent shape. But the surface of the planet yields\r\nlittle detail, and that little is illusive and ill-defined. The clear-cut\r\noutlines and black shadows of the Moon have no place here, nor do the\r\nruddy plains and blue-grey \"seas\" of Mars find any analogues. All that can\r\nbe observed beyond the changes of phase are a few faint, ill-defined\r\npatches, where the molten silver of the general surface is slightly dimmed\r\nand tarnished, and perhaps one or two spots, not less evasive and\r\ndifficult to fix, that exceed the rest of the surface in brightness.\r\n\r\nThis very difficulty in making out the markings on Venus is hopeful for\r\nour search; it points to a veiling over the planet, a veiling by an\r\natmosphere. And the statistics of the Table show that Venus closely\r\nresembles our Earth in size and mass, and therefore probably in\r\natmospheric equipment. If we assume that the atmosphere of any planet is\r\nin direct proportion to its mass--and as Venus is so nearly the twin of\r\nthe Earth there is no reason to expect any great difference between the\r\ntwo in this respect--the atmosphere of Venus would have a pressure of\r\nabout 11.2 lb. on the square inch, and the level of half pressure would be\r\nnearly four miles above the surface. In other words the atmosphere would\r\nbe both thinner and deeper than that of the Earth, but the difference\r\nwould not be important in amount.\r\n\r\nBut Venus is nearer to the Sun than the Earth, and receives nearly double\r\nthe light and heat. Its theoretical equatorial temperature is 368 deg.abs., or\r\n95 deg.C, and its corresponding mean temperature is 69 deg. C. But water under a\r\npressure of 11.2 lb. will boil at 93 deg. C, so that at the equator of Venus\r\nthe upper limit for water as a liquid is just passed, but, for the planet\r\nin general, a fairly safe margin is maintained. Here then is sufficient\r\nexplanation why the topography of Venus is concealed. The atmosphere will\r\nalways be abundantly charged with water-vapour, and an almost unbroken\r\nscreen of clouds be spread throughout its upper regions. Such a screen\r\nwill greatly protect the planet from the full scorching of the Sun, and\r\ntend to equalize the temperature of day and night, of summer and winter,\r\nof equator and poles. The temperature range will be slight, and there will\r\nbe no wide expanses of polar ice. Water that flows will be abundant\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nSo far all the facts connected with Venus are favourable for life, even\r\nthough the picture called up to the mind may not seem inviting to us. For\r\nviews of the heavens must be rare; the Sun must seldom pierce through the\r\ncloud veil; there is no moon and the stars must be almost always hidden.\r\nThe Earth with its Moon might form a beautiful ornament at times in the\r\nmidnight sky if the cloud-shell should occasionally open, but on the\r\nwhole, the planet is shut up to itself in a perpetual vapour-bath, and its\r\ncondition will approach that of some of the most humid countries in the\r\nterrestrial tropics during the height of their rainy seasons.\r\n\r\nBut it would seem that life both of plants and animals, under such\r\nconditions, might flourish and be abundant. The mean temperature would\r\nnot, in general, be high enough to drive off the water as steam, nor low\r\nenough to congeal it into ice; it would remain water--water that flows.\r\n\r\nBut there is still a possible hindrance to life on Venus, a hindrance that\r\nactually exists in the case of Mercury.\r\n\r\nMercury, the \"Twinkler,\" is not an easy object in our Northern latitudes,\r\nbut, in countries near the tropics, is often quite conspicuous, a little\r\nscintillating gem of light in the bright sky, before sunrise or after\r\nsunset. In the telescope it is not so attractive as Venus, partly because\r\nit is smaller, partly because, though it receives more than three times as\r\nmuch light from the Sun, it is duller in hue. Yet it is not quite so\r\nsecretive as its neighbour, and a certain number of markings have been\r\ndetected upon its disc, markings which, like those of the Moon, appear to\r\nbe permanent.\r\n\r\nA glance at the Table will show that this was to be expected. In size,\r\nMercury comes between the Moon and Mars, and the atmospheric veil ought\r\ntherefore to be, as it evidently is, very slight and transparent; offering\r\nlittle or no hindrance to an observer scanning it from another world. The\r\nother necessary consequences of small size and mass will follow; the\r\nfeeble force of gravitation, the languid atmospheric circulation, the\r\nextreme range of temperatures, the low temperature at which water will\r\nboil.\r\n\r\nBut the heat to which Mercury is exposed far transcends our terrestrial\r\nexperience. In the mean it receives nearly seven times as much heat from\r\nthe Sun as the Earth does, but this supply is not maintained uniformly,\r\nfor Mercury moves round the Sun in a very eccentric orbit, so that when in\r\naphelion it receives, surface for surface, only about four times as much\r\nheat as the Earth, but some six weeks later when in perihelion it receives\r\nmore than eleven times. The great range of temperature due to the thinness\r\nof the atmosphere must therefore be further increased by the varying\r\ndistance of the planet from the Sun.\r\n\r\nA reference to Prof. Poynting's figures shows that the mean temperature of\r\nMercury must approximate to 194 deg. C., while water will boil at 40 deg. C. or\r\neven lower. Here, then, is a condition the exact reverse of Mars. Water as\r\na liquid will be rare on Mercury, not because it is congealed, but because\r\nit is evaporated; on the dark side of the planet it may, indeed, pass into\r\nice, but on the side exposed to the Sun it must exist normally as a\r\nconstituent of the atmosphere. Water in a liquid state, water that flows,\r\nmust be almost unknown.\r\n\r\nBut we have good reason to believe that that which is the dark side of\r\nMercury at one time is always dark; that which is exposed to the Sun is\r\nalways exposed to it.\r\n\r\nSince Mercury wears no concealing veil of atmosphere, and displays\r\nmarkings that can be identified and followed, a surprising circumstance\r\nhas come to light. In 1889, Schiaparelli discovered that Mercury, instead\r\nof rotating on its axis in about 24 hours like the Earth and Mars, rotates\r\nin 88 days; that is to say, it always turns the same face towards the Sun,\r\njust as the Moon turns the same face towards the Earth. This fact,\r\nconfirmed theoretically by Prof. G. H. Darwin in his development of the\r\ntheory of tidal friction, puts the condition of Mercury in quite a new\r\nlight. No alternation of day or night refreshes and restores the little\r\nworld; one hemisphere is for ever exposed to the blasting heat of the Sun,\r\nseven times hotter for it than for the Earth; the other hemisphere is for\r\never exposed to the darkness and cold of outer space, a range from\r\nsomething like 390 deg. C. above freezing-point, to 270 deg. C. below. It is true\r\nthat between the two hemispheres there is a \"debatable land,\" for, owing\r\nto the ellipticity of the orbit, the face turned to the Sun is not exactly\r\nthe same at all times, and a region about 47 deg. in width on each side of the\r\nplanet, that is to say, rather more than a quarter of its entire surface,\r\nhas one day and one night in each period of 88 days, but these more\r\nfavoured sections can scarcely be considered more habitable than the rest.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of Mercury are so unfavourable for life that, even if this\r\nremarkable relation of rotation period to revolution did not hold good,\r\nit would still be impossible to regard it as a world for habitation. But\r\nits case shows that a further condition of habitability has to be\r\nsatisfied by a planet. Size and distance from the Sun afford the first two\r\nconditions; a suitable rotation period is now seen to be a third.\r\n\r\nAnd it is possible that in this very particular Venus fails to qualify.\r\nSchiaparelli, the first observer of his time, assisted by the clear\r\nItalian sky, believed that he had demonstrated that Venus, like Mercury,\r\nrotates once in her year; her day being thus equal in length to 225 of\r\nours, and the face that she turns to the Sun being always the same.\r\n\r\nAnd in her case this statement requires practically no qualification, for,\r\nher orbit being nearly circular, there is hardly any libration; a place\r\nthat has the Sun in its zenith has it so for ever; one on the night side\r\nof Venus can never have a sunrise, or gladden in the daylight. The side\r\nexposed to the Sun will wither in a temperature of about 227 deg. C., in which\r\nall moisture will be evaporated; the side remote from it will be bound in\r\neternal ice. In neither hemisphere will water exist in the liquid state;\r\nin neither hemisphere will life be possible.\r\n\r\nBut as yet the evidence is not conclusive that Venus has this long\r\nrotation period. Several observers of high rank believe that our neighbour\r\nrotates in nearly the same time as the Earth, but its markings are so\r\nfaint and elusive that the problem is a difficult one. The spectroscopic\r\nmethod of determining the speed of rotation has been equally indecisive.\r\nUntil, therefore, the rotation period has been decided, the habitability\r\nof Venus must remain in question. If it always turns the same face to the\r\nSun, there can be no more life upon it than upon Mercury; if on the\r\ncontrary it rotates in much the same time as the Earth, then, so far as we\r\nknow, it may well be a habitable world. Whether it is actually inhabited\r\nis a matter at present entirely beyond our knowledge.\r\n\r\nA page or two back we touched lightly on the eccentricity of the orbit of\r\nMercury--lightly, because it was not the chief factor in disabling the\r\nplanet for habitation. But the condition introduced by this eccentricity\r\nis one which of itself would be sufficient to put it out of court. In the\r\nsix weeks in which Mercury moves from aphelion to perihelion, it\r\napproaches the Sun by fourteen millions of miles, and the heat received by\r\nit is increased 2-1/2 times. Then, in the next six weeks, it recedes as\r\nfar, and there is a like diminution. In other words, six weeks makes a\r\ngreater proportional change in this one planet's condition than we should\r\nexperience if our Earth were transported from its own orbit to that of\r\nMars.\r\n\r\nBut there are other members of the solar system whose orbits are so\r\nelongated that that of Mercury seems in comparison almost circular. These\r\nare the comets, some of which all but graze the surface of the Sun at\r\nperihelion, and then recede from him for periods that it takes even\r\nthousands of years to complete. But without dwelling on such extreme\r\ncases, two of the best known of the periodic comets may be taken as\r\nexamples of the rest. Encke's is the comet of shortest period, returning\r\nin about 3.3 years. At perihelion it is 31 millions of miles from the Sun;\r\none-third the distance of the Earth. It receives, therefore, at this part\r\nof its orbit, 9 times as much light and heat as the Earth. But at aphelion\r\nit retreats deep into the region of the asteroids, and is much more than\r\nfour times the mean distance of the Earth. At this part of its orbit it\r\nreceives but 1/17th as much heat as the Earth. By far the most famous of\r\nall the comets is that known by the name of Halley, and its mean period is\r\n76 years. At perihelion it comes within the orbit of Venus; indeed, nearly\r\nhalfway between that and the orbit of Mercury. At aphelion it recedes to\r\nthirty-five times the distance of the Earth, far beyond the orbit of\r\nNeptune. The range in its light and heat from the Sun is from 3 times that\r\nof the Earth to less than 1/1200th; or, in other words, the supply of heat\r\nat one time is nearly 4000 times that at another, and of the 76 years of\r\nits period, only 80 days are spent within the orbit of the Earth.\r\n\r\nComets cannot be homes of life; they are not sufficiently condensed;\r\nindeed, they are probably but loose congeries of small stones. But even if\r\ncomets were of planetary size it is clear that life could not be supported\r\non them; water could not remain in the liquid state on a world that rushed\r\nfrom one such extreme of temperature to another.\r\n\r\nBetween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter there are scattered an untold\r\nnumber of little planets commonly known as asteroids or minor planets.\r\nMinor planets indeed they are, for the one first discovered--Ceres--\r\nprobably outweighs all the rest, known and unknown, put together,\r\nthough something like 700 have already been detected, and the list\r\ngrows at the rate of about one a week.\r\n\r\nAs the Table shows, Ceres is so small that the Earth exceeds it in volume\r\n5000 times; even the Moon is 90 times as large. The mass of Ceres is not\r\nknown; being so small, its density is probably less than that of the Moon,\r\nso that the Earth may easily outweigh it 10,000 times. The unfavourable\r\nconditions resulting from smallness of size that the Moon presents are\r\ntherefore exaggerated exceedingly in the case of Ceres; its atmosphere\r\nmust approach in tenuity what we should regard as a vacuum in a\r\nterrestrial laboratory, and water as a liquid be entirely unknown. Its\r\ndistance from the Sun is another hostile factor; for in consequence it\r\nreceives per unit of surface only 13 per cent of the light and heat that\r\nfalls on the Earth; its maximum temperature under a zenith Sun will fall\r\nfar below freezing-point, the minimum on the dark side will approach the\r\nabsolute zero.\r\n\r\nWith Ceres the whole of the asteroidal family can be dismissed as possible\r\nabodes of life. No astronomer can regard them as such. Yet they have their\r\nlesson to teach. Life can exist on the Earth only on the upper face of its\r\ncrust, and in a very thin film of air and water; but the enormous solid\r\nbulk within, inert though it be, that supports the stage on which the\r\ngreat drama of life is played, is as really essential as air and water\r\nthemselves. If that bulk were much smaller and less massive life could\r\nfind no place upon its surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE MAJOR PLANETS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a striking change to pass from Ceres, the giant of the minor\r\nplanets, to Jupiter, the giant of the major planets. Instead of a world\r\nthat the Earth exceeds in volume 5000 times, we are confronted by one that\r\nexceeds the Earth 1400 times. Ceres, when viewed through a large\r\ntelescope, is just able to present a perceptible disc; Jupiter offers the\r\nlargest shown by any heavenly body after the Sun and Moon.\r\n\r\nAnd that disc is one that never fails to charm the attentive student, for\r\nit abounds in colour, movement and change. The late Prof. James Keeler, an\r\nobserver of the first rank, having the advantage of observing the planet\r\nfrom the summit of Mt. Hamilton and with the great 36-inch telescope of\r\nthe Lick Observatory, thus describes the aspect of the planet in 1889.\r\n\r\n    \"Seen with this instrument on a fine night, the disc of Jupiter was a\r\n    most beautiful object, covered with a wealth of detail which could not\r\n    possibly be accurately represented in a drawing.... Scarcely any\r\n    portion of Jupiter, except the Red Spot and the extreme polar regions,\r\n    was of a uniform tint, the surface being mottled with flocculent and\r\n    more or less irregular cloud masses.... The equatorial zone, occupying\r\n    the space between the red belts, was marked in the centre by a\r\n    salmon-coloured stripe, which was occasionally interrupted by an\r\n    extension of the white clouds on the sides of the zone. The edges were\r\n    brilliant white, and were formed of rounded cloud-like masses, which\r\n    at certain places extended into the red belts as long streamers....\r\n    Near their junction with the equatorial zone, the streamers were white\r\n    and definite in outline, but they became redder in tint toward their\r\n    outer extremities, and more diffuse, until they were lost in the\r\n    general red colour of the background. When the seeing was good they\r\n    were seen to be formed of irregular rounded or feathery clouds, fading\r\n    toward the outer ends, until the structure could no longer be\r\n    distinguished.... The portions of the equatorial zone surrounding the\r\n    roots of well-marked streamers were somewhat brighter than at other\r\n    places, and it is a curious circumstance that they were almost\r\n    invariably suffused with a pale olive-green colour, which seemed to be\r\n    associated with great disturbance, and which was rarely seen\r\n    elsewhere.... The red belts presented on all occasions the appearance\r\n    of a passive medium, in which the phenomena of the streamers and other\r\n    forms ... were manifested. The phenomena would be exactly reproduced\r\n    by streamers of cloudy white matter floating in a semi-transparent\r\n    reddish fluid, sometimes submerged and sometimes rising to the\r\n    surface.... The dark spots frequently seen on the red belts usually\r\n    occupied spaces left by sharp turns in the streamers, and they were of\r\n    the same colour as the belts, but deeper in tint, as if the fluid\r\n    medium could be seen to a greater depth.\"[15]\r\n\r\nIn other words, Jupiter is a striped or banded planet, the bands lying\r\nalong the direction of turning. These bands are coloured in varying tints,\r\nand the planet rotates very rapidly, for the details in the bands pass\r\nquickly from one limb to the other. And not only is the speed of rotation\r\nof the whole very rapid--Jupiter turns about its axis in a little less\r\nthan ten hours, so that a particle at its equator moves through 466 miles\r\nin each minute--but the various items that form the bands rotate in\r\ndifferent times. They may also alter their form and their colour. Jupiter\r\nseems, then, to be a planet with a great and rapidly changing atmosphere\r\nthat extends above a shoreless sea formed of some liquified substance or\r\nsubstances--the whole in a state of flux.\r\n\r\nBut if we turn back to the Table, we see that Jupiter at its mean distance\r\nfrom the Sun is 5.2 times that of the Earth; that is to say, it receives\r\nonly 1/27th of the light and heat that we receive. But in Chapter VIII, we\r\nlearnt from Mars that as this receives only 3/7ths of the Earth's light\r\nand heat, its mean temperature would sink to -30 deg.C.; the Earth's being\r\n16 deg.C. Mars is therefore almost always a frozen planet; frozen except on\r\nits mere surface when this is exposed to the full rays of the Sun. No sea\r\nthere would ever be melted to a depth of more than a few inches, even at\r\nnoonday in midsummer. And yet Mars has at least ten times the advantages\r\nof Jupiter. Jupiter, then, must be a frozen planet through and through; no\r\nliquid of any sort can exist on its surface; no vapour of any substance\r\ncan exist in its atmosphere. It must be icebound even at its summer\r\nnoonday.\r\n\r\nYet, from the description given by Prof. Keeler, it is manifestly not so;\r\nand another item in the Table emphasizes that it cannot be so. The density\r\nof the Sun is 1.4 that of water, Jupiter's is 1.33, showing that but a\r\nvery small proportion (if any) of its bulk can be solid; the rest must be\r\nvaporous, or at least fluid. How then can we reconcile these\r\ninconsistencies?\r\n\r\nIt is in the dimensions of Jupiter that we find the answer. The mass of\r\nthe planet is 317 times that of the Earth; it is indeed nearly three times\r\nas great as that of all the other planets put together. But the\r\naggregation of so vast an amount of material is of itself a source of\r\nheat; the chief source at the present time of the enormous output of heat\r\nfrom the Sun is ascribed to its gradual contraction; the slow falling of\r\nits substance, if we may so express it, a little nearer to its centre. The\r\ngreat mass of Jupiter points to its inherent store of heat being much\r\ngreater than that of any other planet. And of two bodies equally hot, the\r\nlarger must cool more slowly than the smaller. If, therefore, all the\r\nmembers of the solar system had at one and the same moment possessed the\r\nsame surface temperature, that equality would have ceased directly they\r\nbegan to radiate their heat into space; the temperature of the smaller\r\nbodies falling more rapidly than those of the larger. This is another\r\nexample of the principle that has already been noted, that the properties\r\nof a small world are not those of a large world divided by a constant\r\nfactor. It is not possible to conceive a model of the solar system in\r\nwhich all the significant factors should be true to the same scale. If the\r\ndiameters and distances were all made on a one-tenth scale, the surfaces\r\nwould be one-hundredth of reality, the volumes one-thousandth.\r\n\r\nBut a radiating body radiates from its surface, while the store of heat\r\nfrom which that radiation is kept up is supplied by its volume. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that a large and heavy world must differ from a small\r\nlight world, not merely in scale, but also in kind.\r\n\r\nThe surface of a world is all that we see of it; it is, therefore, very\r\ncommonly all that we consider. But unseen, and hence often unconsidered,\r\nbeneath the surface lies its substance or mass, and it is this that\r\ndetermines the state and condition of the surface; it is the underlying\r\npower. Two men may be contending in a financial struggle; to the eye they\r\nmay look alike, equally prosperous; both may have the same amount of money\r\nactually in their pockets; but the one has nothing else, the other has a\r\ngreat banking account and vast investments, and is, in fact, a\r\nmillionaire; and it is his unseen power and resources that will make\r\nthemselves felt.\r\n\r\nJupiter therefore introduces us to a new factor in world-condition; not\r\nall its heat is derived from the Sun; much is inherent to it. And though\r\nit is not possible at present to say that the mass of Jupiter being so\r\nmuch its inherent heat must be this or that quantity as a function of that\r\nmass, yet in general, and neglecting other considerations, we can say that\r\nof two worlds the one with the greater mass will be that with the higher\r\ninherent temperature. This factor of inherent temperature was one that did\r\nnot require to be noticed in dealing with the Moon, or Venus, or Mars, for\r\nthese and all the planets yet noticed are less in size, surface, volume,\r\nand mass than the Earth, and hence possess less inherent heat. It is only\r\nnow that the greater planets are being considered that the question of a\r\nsource of heat, other than the Sun, can arise.\r\n\r\nBut the evidence of such heat on Jupiter is not to be disputed. The albedo\r\nor reflective index of Jupiter has been put by the late Prof. G. Bond, of\r\nHarvard College Observatory, as higher than unity; in other words, that it\r\nemits more light than it receives. This is now generally regarded as an\r\nexcessive estimate, but the albedo of the disc as a whole cannot be put\r\nlower than 0.72, or about that of white paper. But many of the \"belts\" or\r\ndark regions are of a dull copper tint, and the polar caps are dusky, so\r\nthat Bond's estimate must be realized for the most brilliant \"zones,\" as\r\nthe brighter regions are called; certainly for the whitest of the white\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nNo direct evidence of inherent luminosity has been obtained, for the\r\nsatellites disappear entirely in eclipse. But though their shadows in\r\ntransit appear very dark, it is clear that they are not absolutely black,\r\nsince sometimes such a shadow is not distinguishable in darkness from the\r\nsatellite that casts it; a delicate proof that the background on which it\r\nfalls has some intrinsic luminosity.\r\n\r\nUnless there is the counteracting effect of a high temperature, the\r\natmosphere of Jupiter would have a pressure at the surface of 104 lb. to\r\nthe square inch, and the level of half pressure be attained at a mile and\r\na quarter; the reverse condition to that on Mars would obtain, and the\r\natmosphere of Jupiter would be much denser and much shallower than that of\r\nthe Earth. Denser it probably is; shallower it cannot be, for the great\r\nwhite spots, each often five or six thousand miles in diameter, that range\r\nthemselves at times along the equatorial regions till they look like the\r\nportholes of a ship, evidently rise from depths great even as compared\r\nwith their size. But it is only by intense heat that the effect of the\r\ngreat mass of Jupiter in constricting its atmosphere within shallow depths\r\ncan be overcome.\r\n\r\nAgain, the extraordinary lightness of the planet, so little above the\r\ndensity of water, points in the same direction. So, not less unmistakably,\r\ndo the magnitude and rapidity of the atmospheric movements. The clouds and\r\nstorms of our own atmosphere are worked by solar heat; solar heat it is\r\nthat draws up the vapours and provides the chief part of the energy\r\nmanifested in the speed and strength of the air-current. But solar heat\r\ncan only give 1/27th the amount of that energy at the distance of Jupiter,\r\nso that, if they were entirely dependent on solar radiation, the winds of\r\nJupiter should be very feeble.\r\n\r\nFurther, the difference of presentment due to the difference of latitude\r\nis a fruitful cause of inequalities of temperature and pressure in the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere. But as a degree of latitude on Jupiter is eleven\r\ntimes as wide as on the Earth, such inequalities connected with a given\r\ndifference in latitude are spread over eleven times the distance that they\r\nwould be on the Earth, and are, therefore, so much the less pronounced.\r\nYet, across a gulf of 400 millions of miles we can clearly discern the\r\nbright zones of Jupiter now narrowing down and constricting the red belts,\r\nnow thrust apart by them, and can detect changes taking place in an hour\r\nof time over areas equal to that of a terrestrial hemisphere.\r\n\r\nA notable peculiarity of Jupiter is found in the proper motions of its\r\nspots. Many of the white spots are exceedingly swift, giving a rotation\r\nperiod of 9h. 50m. while the equatorial belt in general gives a period 5m.\r\nlonger; so that in 119 rotations (nearly 49 days) a white spot will have\r\npassed entirely round the belt, gaining upon it at a rate of nearly 240\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all the markings in Jupiter is the Great Red Spot,\r\nwhich became conspicuous in 1878, since when the spot itself, or at least\r\nthe nest in which it lay, has always been visible. It has been identified\r\nwith a great red spot observed by Hooke and Cassini in 1664-6, that\r\nappeared and vanished again eight times between 1665 and 1708. It\r\ntherefore has had a history practically as long as our telescopic\r\nknowledge of the planet, and may be looked upon as in some sort a\r\npermanent feature. Yet that it is not in the nature of a portion of a\r\nsolid crust is clear. It occupies on Jupiter much the position and\r\nrelative area of Australia on the Earth, but whereas Australia of\r\nnecessity rotates in one piece with all the other continents, the Great\r\nRed Spot has a rotation period which is neither that of the equatorial\r\nbelt, nor of the quickly moving white spots, and is not itself stable. An\r\n\"Australia on the loose\" is impossible, even unthinkable here, but the\r\nGreat Red Spot, for all its long duration, is mobile and inconstant, and\r\nis therefore no portion of a solid permanent crust.\r\n\r\nThe giant planet Jupiter, therefore, offers us an example of what we may\r\ncall a \"semi-sun\"; a world still bubbling with tremendous energies of its\r\nown, still pulsing with its own inherent heat, still without a solid\r\ncrust; probably without a solid nucleus, liquid or vaporous throughout.\r\nWhatever the future may hold for such an orb, it is clearly no world for\r\nhabitation at present. Full of colour, and movement, and change as it is,\r\nit lacks the Earth's \"gloom of iron substance,\" which is necessary, no\r\nless than its veiling by the plant, as a stage for \"the passion and\r\nperishing of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nBut if Jupiter be a semi-Sun, still a source of heat, perhaps even of\r\nlight, can it yield the means of life to its satellites? For Jupiter is\r\nsun-like, not merely in its own condition, but also in that it is the\r\ncentre and ruler of a system of its own. We know already of eight\r\nsatellites revolving round it.\r\n\r\nOf these eight, only four--the four discovered by Galileo, in the first\r\ndays of his possession of a telescope--need be considered; the other four\r\nare of the same order of size as the asteroids, and are indeed much\r\nsmaller than Ceres.\r\n\r\nBut the Galilean satellites are of a higher rank. Europa, the smallest, is\r\nin size a twin to the Moon; Callisto, the outermost, is almost exactly the\r\nsize of Mercury; Io, the innermost, is midway between the two in its\r\ndimensions. But Ganymede, the largest, is almost comparable with Mars, its\r\ndiameter being 0.45 that of the Earth instead of the 0.53 of Mars.\r\n\r\nBut the Moon, Mercury, and Mars have all been shown, on the ground of\r\ntheir small size, to be worlds unfit for habitation; the satellites of\r\nJupiter are, therefore, all rejected on the same score. Nor can the\r\ngreater nearness of their immediate primary compensate for their\r\nremoteness from the Sun. It is true that Jupiter presents to Ganymede a\r\ndisc with more than 200 times the apparent area that the Sun presents to\r\nthe Earth, but to make up for the falling-off of the solar radiation, each\r\nunit of this area should radiate about 1/250th as much heat as each unit\r\nof the Sun's surface. In other words, the absolute surface temperature of\r\nJupiter should be 1/4th that of the Sun, or about 1550 deg. C., and this is\r\nhigher than can be admitted. The Sun and Jupiter together cannot put\r\nGanymede in as favourable a position as Mars, much less as favourable as\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\nThe case of Jupiter carries with it those of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\r\nAll three, from their high albedoes and low densities, are still in a\r\nvaporous condition; still in some sort, semi-Suns; sources of a certain\r\namount of heat, and not recipients merely. The days are yet far distant\r\nwhen a solid crust can form on any one of them, and the water condense\r\nfrom the steamy atmosphere to form oceans, seas, and rivers. Not till\r\nthen, if at all, when water as a liquid, water that flows, is present, can\r\nlife begin to appear and enter on its long course of change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWHEN THE MAJOR PLANETS COOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question has been asked: \"It is evident that life cannot exist at the\r\npresent time on the outer planets, since they are in a highly heated and\r\nquasi-solar condition; but when they cool down, as cool they must, and a\r\nsolid crust is formed, may not a time come when they will be habitable? It\r\nseems impossible to think that worlds so beautiful to our eyes and so vast\r\nin scale are destined never to be peopled by intelligent beings.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clearly difficult to answer satisfactorily a question that requires\r\nso deep a plunge into the recesses of the unknown future; yet, so far as\r\nour knowledge goes, there is no reason to think that Jupiter will be more\r\nhabitable then than it is now. The difficulty of the small supply of light\r\nand heat received from the Sun would apparently still remain, if indeed,\r\nthe cooling of the Sun itself would not increase it. We do not know of any\r\nmeans by which our Sun could so increase its radiation as to supply to\r\nJupiter from 25 to 30 times as much heat as it now receives, and this\r\nwould be necessary to place it in the same favoured condition as the\r\nEarth. If so great a change were to take place in the Sun, life would be\r\nscorched out of existence on all planets nearer than Jupiter, and,\r\nsimilarly, if the solar emission were increased to meet the necessities of\r\nUranus or Neptune, even Jupiter would fall a victim.\r\n\r\nBut we may consider it as a conceivable case that a planet of the exact\r\ndimensions of Jupiter may be revolving in an annual period of the same\r\nlength as his, round some star that is capable of affording it adequate\r\nnourishment; and so with the three other giant planets. The actual Jupiter\r\nand Saturn of the solar system have, so far as we can tell, neither\r\npresent nor future as habitable worlds, but we can consider what would be\r\nthe case of imaginary bodies of similar dimensions in systems where the\r\nsupply of heat would be sufficient. Or we can neglect the question of\r\ntemperature altogether, as we did at first in the case of Mars.\r\n\r\nAll the four planets must shrink much in volume before their\r\nsolidification will take place. Their average density at present but\r\nlittle exceeds that of water; indeed, Saturn is not so dense as water; yet\r\nwe must suppose that the same elements are in general common to the Earth\r\nand to them all. If we assume, then, that the four planets all cool to the\r\npoint of solidification, their densities must be much increased, and their\r\nvolumes correspondingly diminished. Since all four greatly exceed the\r\nEarth in mass, it is but natural to expect that, when they have assumed\r\nthe terrestrial condition, they will be more closely compacted than the\r\nEarth, and their densities in consequence will be greater. It will,\r\nhowever, be simpler if we assume exactly the same density for them as for\r\nthe Earth. Jupiter will then have shrunk to about one-fourth of its\r\npresent volume, and the statistics for the four planets will run as in the\r\nfollowing Table:\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF THE FOUR OUTER PLANETS IF WITH THE SAME DENSITY AS THE EARTH\r\n\r\n  PROPORTIONS OF THE PLANETS:--\r\n                                       Uranus  Neptune  Saturn  Jupiter\r\n    Diameter in miles                  19300    20400    36000   54000\r\n      do                [Symbol] = 1    2.44     2.57     4.56    6.82\r\n    Surface,            [Symbol] = 1    6.0      6.6     20.8    46.6\r\n    Mass and Volume,    [Symbol] = 1   14.6     17.0     94.8   317.7\r\n    Gravity at surface, [Symbol] = 1    2.44     2.57     4.56    6.82\r\n  Rate of Fall, Feet in\r\n    the First Second                   39.2     41.3     73.3   109.7\r\n\r\n  ATMOSPHERE, assuming the\r\n  total mass of the atmosphere\r\n  to be proportional to\r\n  the mass of the planet:--\r\n\r\n  Pressure at the surface in lb.\r\n    per square inch                    88.2     97.0    305.8   685.0\r\n  Pressure at the surface in\r\n    \"atmospheres\"                       6.0      6.6     20.8    46.6\r\n  Level of half-pressure in miles       1.37     1.30     0.73    0.49\r\n  Boiling point of water at\r\n    surface                            127 deg.C    129 deg.C    148 deg.C   164 deg.C\r\n\r\nJupiter offers two peculiarities. In its shrunken condition, its diameter,\r\ninstead of being eleven times that of the Earth, will be not quite seven,\r\nand the force of gravity at the surface will be greater than that of the\r\nEarth in the same proportion. A man who here weighs 150 lb. will there\r\nweigh over 1000 lb.; and the muscular effort of movement will be increased\r\nin the same ratio. The athlete who here can clear a height 5 ft. 8 in.\r\nwill there, with like pains, surmount 10 inches; and other efforts will be\r\nin the same proportion. The atmosphere, supposing it to be in proportion\r\nto the mass of Jupiter, will exercise a pressure of 46-1/2 \"atmospheres,\"\r\nor more than 680 lb., to the square inch. Following on this enormous\r\npressure at the surface would be the rapidity with which the atmosphere\r\nwould thin out in the upward direction. The level of half-pressure would\r\nbe attained by ascending less than half a mile in height; that is to say,\r\nthere would be a difference of pressure of 340 lb. on the square inch from\r\nthat experienced at the sea-level. We know from the fact that fishes live\r\nat enormous depths in the ocean, that living organisms can be constructed\r\nto endure great pressures, but they are not constructed to endure great\r\nalterations of pressure. The deep-sea fishes are as instantly killed by\r\nbeing brought up to the surface, as the surface fishes or the land animals\r\nwould be if they were plunged into the depths. And it is clear that on\r\nJupiter a low range of hills that on the Earth would be considered only\r\nan easy climb, would be an impassable barrier, not only from the immense\r\nexertion of mounting it, but chiefly from the unendurable change of\r\npressure which the ascent would involve.\r\n\r\nThe sevenfold gravity of Jupiter, taken in connection with this enormous\r\natmospheric pressure, would tend to make the meteorological disturbances\r\nof the planet violent far beyond anything of which the Earth can furnish\r\nan example. The atmosphere would possess a high viscosity, and differences\r\nin condition, pressure and saturation would tend to accumulate, until at\r\nlength the balance would be restored with explosive suddenness and force.\r\nHere our most violent tornadoes may reach a speed of 100 miles an hour; on\r\nJupiter, gales of five or six times that velocity would be common. We\r\ncannot conceive that living organisms would be able to grow, flourish and\r\nmultiply where the conditions were so cataclysmic.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty must always exist where the planet is great in mass, and\r\nthe force of gravity high at the surface. The case of Saturn is not so\r\nextreme as that of Jupiter, though it is probably sufficiently severe to\r\nexclude it from the ranks of worlds that could ever be dwelt in. The\r\natmospheric pressure would be about 21 \"atmospheres,\" or more than 300 lb.\r\non the square inch. The level of half-pressure would be reached at about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile, and the force of gravity be nearly 4-1/2 times\r\nthat of the Earth.\r\n\r\nBut the serious condition for Saturn would come from that feature which\r\nrenders it by far the most attractive of all the planets seen in the\r\ntelescope, the presence of the wonderful Ring system.\r\n\r\nTo us, viewing Saturn from afar, and from practically the same direction\r\nas the Sun, the Rings are seen lit up; but to a dweller on Saturn, the\r\nRings during the day are between his world and the Sun, and hence turn\r\ntheir dark side toward him. More than that, the telescope shows us that\r\nthe Rings cast a shadow on the planet; in other words, they eclipse part\r\nof it; and this shadow changes its position with the progress of the\r\nSaturnian year. Proctor computed that if the Rings were a hundred miles in\r\nthickness, the equator would suffer, in consequence, total eclipse for\r\nnearly ten days at each equinox, and partial eclipse for about forty days\r\nmore. Moving away from the equator, each higher latitude would have a\r\nlonger and longer period of eclipse in the winter half of its year; the\r\nhigher the latitude, the later after the autumnal equinox the eclipse\r\nwould begin, and the longer it would last, until about latitude 40 deg. was\r\nreached. Here the eclipses would begin nearly three terrestrial years\r\nafter the time of the autumnal equinox. At first the Sun would be eclipsed\r\nonly in the morning and evening of each day, but the length of the daily\r\neclipse would increase, until the Sun was hidden the whole day long. This\r\nperiod of total eclipse would last for about 6 years 8 months, terrestrial\r\nreckoning, or with the periods of partial eclipse, 8 years and nearly 10\r\nmonths. Whatever the efficiency of the Sun that afforded light and heat to\r\nsuch a planet, it is clear that such eclipses must be fatal to life in two\r\nways: light and heat would be cut off from wide regions of the planet for\r\nlong periods of time, and terrible meteorological convulsions must follow\r\nin the train. Here on the Earth, though a total eclipse generally lasts\r\nonly two or three minutes, the atmospheric disturbance is perceptible, and\r\nthe fall of temperature very marked, and it does not require much\r\nreflection to see that the analogous disturbance in an atmosphere twenty\r\ntimes as dense must be terrific indeed during an eclipse that lasts not a\r\nfew minutes only, but for more than six of our years.\r\n\r\nThe case of Uranus introduces us to another class of conditions fatal to\r\nhabitability. The equator of Jupiter is inclined only 3 deg. to the plane of\r\nits orbit; the difference in its seasons is, therefore, almost\r\nimperceptible; there is hardly any alteration in the incidence of the\r\nsolar rays; it is, as if on the Earth, the height of the Sun at noon in\r\nmid-winter were what it actually is on the 14th of March, and its height\r\nat midsummer the same as we observe on March 28. The inclination of the\r\nequator of Saturn is considerably greater than that of Mars or the Earth,\r\nso that its seasons are more pronounced, but not to an extent that would\r\nintroduce any radical difference. But for Uranus, the inclination of the\r\nequator to the plane of the orbit is 82 deg. If this were the case for the\r\nEarth, the noonday sun for London would be, at the spring equinox, 38-1/2 deg.\r\nhigh as at present, but its altitude day by day would increase with great\r\nrapidity, and before the end of April, the Sun at noon would be right in\r\nthe zenith, and 13 deg. above the horizon at midnight. At midsummer, indeed,\r\nit would be only 59 deg. high at noonday, but it would be north of the zenith\r\ninstead of south, and at technical midnight, it would still be 44 deg. in\r\naltitude, thus moving round in a very small circle, only 15 deg. in diameter.\r\nFrom about April 18 to August 25--that is to say, for 129 days--the Sun\r\nwould never set, and unlike the summer day of our own polar regions now,\r\nwherein the Sun, though always present, is always low down in the sky, for\r\nmuch of that period it would pass the meridian quite close to the zenith.\r\n\r\nAs the year of Uranus is 84 times the length of our year, the London of\r\nUranus would have to endure not far short of 30 years continuous\r\nscorching.\r\n\r\nAnd the winter would be as long; the perpetual day of summer would be\r\nreplaced by a night as enduring. More than 29 years of unbroken darkness,\r\nof unmitigated cold, cannot possibly ever consist with the conditions\r\nnecessary for life upon a planet. Whatever the brightness of the imagined\r\nsun of Uranus, if for 29 years at a time that sun were below the horizon,\r\nthe water on the planet must be congealed, and during the 29 years of\r\nunbroken day all the water would be as certainly evaporated.\r\n\r\nThus, though Uranus is not burdened by the enormous mass of Jupiter, nor\r\novershadowed, like Saturn, by a system of rings, the extraordinary\r\ninclination of its axis introduces a condition which is as fatal to it, as\r\na world to dwell in, as any of the disabilities of the other planets.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that these four outer planets, that resemble each other so\r\nstrikingly in many of their conditions--in their vast size, high albedo,\r\nlow density, and vaporous envelopes, that show, in their spectra, not\r\nmerely the lines of reflected sunlight, but also special lines due to\r\ntheir own atmospheres (the chief of these being common to all the four\r\nplanets)--should yet, in the inclination of their axes to the plane of\r\ntheir orbits, display every possible variety. The axis of Jupiter is\r\nalmost normal to its orbit, that of Uranus lies almost in the plane of its\r\norbit. The axes of Saturn and Neptune have a mean inclination, but it\r\nwould appear that the rotation of Neptune is in the reverse direction to\r\nthat of planets in general, so that the true inclination is usually taken\r\nas being the complement of the observed angle, as if the axis were turned\r\nright over. It is uncertain whether this would have any important effect\r\nupon the habitability of the planet, but it supplies the fourth possible\r\ncase for the position of the axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn passing in review the various members of the solar system, it has been\r\nseen that there are many conditions that have to be fulfilled before a\r\nplanet can be regarded as the possible abode of life, because there are\r\nmany conditions necessary in order that water may exist on its surface in\r\nthe liquid state. The size and mass of the planet are restricted within\r\nquite narrow limits; and a world much larger or much smaller than our own\r\nis necessarily excluded. The supply of light and heat received from the\r\nSun must not fall much below that received by the Earth, nor greatly\r\nexceed it; in other words, the distance of the planet from its Sun is\r\nsomewhat precisely fixed, since the light and heat vary inversely not as\r\nthe distance, but as its square. Of course, in different systems, with\r\nsuns of different power, the most favourable distance will not be the same\r\nin each; but in any system there will be one most advantageous distance,\r\nand no great departure from it will be possible. This condition further\r\nimplies that the planetary orbits must be nearly circular; pronounced\r\neccentricity, such as the orbits of even our short-period comets display,\r\nwould be fatal to the persistence of water in the liquid state, and hence\r\nto the continuance of life. A wide discordance between the planes of the\r\nplanet's equator and of its orbit, by rendering the seasons extravagantly\r\ndiverse, would act as prejudicially as an eccentric orbit, and a rotation\r\nperiod equal to that of revolution would mean that one hemisphere was\r\neternally frozen while the other was exposed to perpetual heat.\r\n\r\nIt follows that in any given system there can be at most only one or two\r\nplanets upon which life can find a home, and this only where the right\r\nconditions of size and mass, of rotation period, inclination of axis, and\r\nshape of orbit, all co-exist in a globe at the proper distance. But the\r\ntype of system offered by our Sun and his planets is not the only one that\r\nexists. A very large proportion of stars are binaries--two suns revolve\r\nround their common centre of gravity. In many cases the two suns are\r\nseparable in the telescope, and their relative movements can be measured;\r\nin other cases, termed \"spectroscopic binaries,\" we only learn that a star\r\nwhich appears absolutely single has two components from the evidence of\r\nits spectrum; the spectroscope revealing two sets of lines that vibrate to\r\nand fro with respect to each other. Yet, again, a third class of double\r\nstars has made itself known in the \"Algol variables.\" The optical double\r\nstars are cases where the two components are far distant from each other,\r\nand hence can be distinguished in our telescopes as separate points of\r\nlight. The \"spectroscopic binaries\" are cases where the two components are\r\ntoo close to be separately perceived, but where the two are not greatly\r\nunequal in brightness, so that the spectrum of the one does not overpower\r\nthat of the other. The \"Algol variables\" are cases where the two\r\ncomponents are of very unequal brightness, and, being very close to each\r\nother, are so placed with respect to the Earth that the fainter partly\r\neclipses the brighter in its revolution round it, and so causes a\r\ntemporary diminution in its light at regular intervals. All these three\r\nclasses of binary systems are now known to be very numerous. Prof.\r\nCampbell estimates that fully one star in six is a spectroscopic binary.\r\nBut there must be many binary systems that do not reveal\r\nthemselves--double stars where the companion is too faint or too close to\r\nbe detected, Algol systems where the companion does not pass before its\r\nprimary--and it seems almost certain that simple systems, like that of\r\nwhich our Sun is the unchallenged autocrat, must be comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nBut the problem of the movements of a planet attendant upon two or more\r\nsuns is one of amazing complexity, and our greatest mathematicians have as\r\nyet only been able to deal with the approximate solution of a few very\r\nspecial cases. These are, however, sufficient to show that the orbit of a\r\nplanet so placed would be most irregular; the variations in the supplies\r\nof light and heat received would be as great as even comets experience\r\nwithin the solar system, and, what would be more disastrous still, these\r\nvariations would not be periodic but irregular. One year would be unlike\r\nthat which preceded it, and would be followed by changed conditions in the\r\nnext. Plants and animals would never have the chance of acclimatizing\r\nthemselves to these ever-changing vicissitudes. The stability of condition\r\nessential for the maintenance of water in a liquid state would be wanting;\r\nand, in consequence, Life could neither come into existence, nor persist\r\nif it once appeared.\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, our line of thought has led us to recognize that Life\r\ncan exist in comparatively few of the innumerable stellar systems strewn\r\nthrough infinite space, and in any given system it can at best find only\r\none or two homes. The conditions for a Life-bearing planet are thus both\r\nnumerous and stringent--there is no elasticity about them. It is not\r\nsufficient that a planet might fulfil many or even most of these\r\nconditions; failure in one is failure altogether; \"one black ball\r\nexcludes;\" the candidate who fails in a single subject is \"ploughed\"\r\nwithout mercy. And in most cases the failure is final; no opportunity is\r\ngiven to the candidate to \"sit\" again.\r\n\r\nBut Space is not the only horizon along which our thought must be\r\ndirected; there is also the horizon of Time. Every world must have its\r\nPast and its Future, as well as its Present. For some worlds the\r\nconditions are so fixed that, like Jupiter and Saturn, they are not now\r\nworlds that can be dwelt in, they never were in that condition, and they\r\nnever can be; their enormous mass forbids it. Mercury and the Moon at the\r\nother end of the planetary scale are also permanently disabled; their\r\ninsignificant size excludes them. There was also a time when the Earth was\r\nnot a world of habitation; it was \"without form and void\"; hot and\r\nvaporous, even as the four outer planets are now. Now it is inhabited, but\r\nthere may come a time when this phase of its history has run its course,\r\nand either from a falling off in the tribute of light and heat rendered to\r\nit by the Sun, or from the gradual desiccation of the surface, or,\r\nperchance, from the slow loss of its atmosphere, it may approach the\r\ncondition of Mars, and in its turn be no longer an abode of life. Many\r\nplanets are essentially debarred from ever entering on the vital stage;\r\nbut of those to which such a stage is possible, it can only form an\r\nincident in the entire duration of the orb. And if our Earth is any type\r\nor example of the vital stage in general, vast aeons must run their course\r\nfrom the first appearance of the humblest germs of life up to the bringing\r\nforth of Life in conscious Intelligence. One hundred million years are\r\nfreely spoken of in this connection by those who study the crust of the\r\nEarth and those who are occupied with the relations of the varied forms of\r\nlife. Man is the latest arrival on this planet, and however far back we\r\ntry to push the time of his earliest appearance, it is beyond question\r\nthat that time, relatively to the entire duration of the Earth since a\r\nsolid crust began to form, is but as yesterday. If, from some other globe\r\nin the depths of space, this world of ours could have been watched during\r\nthe long aeons that elapsed from its first separation from the solar\r\nnebula down to the time when it first possessed a surface of land and\r\nwater, and from that time, again, throughout the hypothetical one hundred\r\nmillion years that preceded the advent of man, then, during all those\r\naeons, those imagined observers would have had under their scrutiny a\r\nworld as yet without inhabitant. The Earth now is in the inhabited\r\ncondition, but science gives us no clue as to how long that condition will\r\nendure; rather such hints as are afforded us would seem to point to its\r\nlasting but for a brief season as compared with the indefinite duration\r\nwhich preceded it, and the indefinite duration which shall follow.\r\n\r\nIf this thought be sound, it places before us an entirely new and most\r\nserious consideration. The world predestined for habitation must not only\r\nhave its size within certain narrow limits, its distance from its central\r\nsun in a certain narrow zone, its rotation period, the inclination of its\r\naxis, the eccentricity of its orbit, all suitable alike, but even if in\r\nthese and in all other necessaries it is perfectly adapted for habitation,\r\nyet it will be only during a relatively small fraction of its entire\r\nduration that Intelligent Life, clothed in material form, will find a\r\nplace upon it.\r\n\r\nLet us sum shortly what we know and what we conclude. We know that this,\r\nour Earth, is a habitable globe, for we ourselves are living upon it. We\r\nknow what constitutes the physical basis of our life, and under what\r\nconditions on this Earth it flourishes, and under what conditions it is\r\ndestroyed. If we turn our eyes from this, our Earth, and look out upon the\r\nstarry skies, we see the other planets of our system, and the suns which\r\nare the centres of other systems. From the consideration of the planets in\r\nour own system, we have seen how stringent and how many are the conditions\r\nimposed for Life to be possible. Round our Sun there is but a narrow zone\r\nin which a habitable world may circle; in this zone there is room for but\r\nfew worlds, and we actually know of three alone, the Earth, the Moon, and\r\nVenus. We know that the Earth can be and is inhabited; that the Moon is\r\nnot and cannot be inhabited; and that Venus, though of habitable size, may\r\nyet be subject to the fatal disqualification of always turning the same\r\nface to the Sun. Of other planetary systems than our own, we actually know\r\nof none, but we assume that there are such, and as numerous as there are\r\nsuns in the starry depths. But of these planetary systems we can rule out,\r\nas containing no habitable member, all such as circle round double or\r\nmultiple suns or, indeed, round any single star that, from whatever cause,\r\nis largely variable and, therefore, much less stable than our own. Mira\r\nCeti, which in 5 months increases its brightness 1000 times, may stand as\r\nan example. Probably these disqualifications rule out of court the great\r\nproportion of the stellar systems. Of the few, comparatively speaking,\r\nsingle and stable suns that remain in the heavenly abyss, we must\r\nconclude, from what we know of our solar system, that they, too, have but\r\na narrow zone, outside of which no world would be fit to dwell in; whilst\r\nin the zone the few worlds which might exist must violate no one of many\r\nstrict conditions. If we assume that there are a hundred million stars\r\nwithin the ken of our telescopes, we may well believe that not more than\r\none in a hundred of these would fulfil the condition of being a single and\r\nstable sun, such as ours. Of the planets revolving round these million\r\nsuns--stable and efficient suns--can we expect that in more cases than one\r\nin a hundred there will be a planet in the habitable zone fulfilling all\r\nthe other conditions of habitability, of size, mass, inclination of axis,\r\ncircular orbit, and rotation? Of these ten thousand earths which may be\r\nmade fit for the habitation of Man, can we assume that even one in a\r\nhundred is now at that epoch in its history when it is no longer \"without\r\nform and void,\" when a division has been made between the waters under the\r\nfirmament and those that are above the firmament; when the waters under\r\nthe heaven have been gathered into one place, and the dry land has\r\nappeared, and when the earth and the waters have brought forth life\r\nabundantly? Out of a hundred million of planetary systems throughout the\r\ndepths of space, can we suppose that there are even one hundred worlds\r\nthat are actually inhabited at the present moment? These numbers and\r\nproportions certainly are not, and cannot be, based on knowledge; they are\r\ngiven as illustrations only; but, vague as they are, they suggest that our\r\nEarth may be neither one of many inhabited earths, nor yet unique, but one\r\nof a few--indeed of a very few.\r\n\r\nAnd then the objection is raised: \"If our own Earth is but one of,\r\nperhaps, two inhabited worlds in the solar system; and of perhaps one or\r\ntwo hundred inhabited worlds throughout the furthest space that we can\r\nscan; why is all this waste?\" Of all the countless millions of stellar\r\nsystems without living organisms as inhabitants, we cannot tell the\r\npurpose for the simple reason that we do not know it; but of \"waste\" in\r\nthe solar system, there is no question. Relatively speaking, this is quite\r\ninsignificant, for we cannot consider that as \"waste material\" which is\r\nuseful and, indeed, essential to existence. For, consider first the\r\nmaterial in the Earth itself. Its total volume is 260,613,000,000 cubic\r\nmiles, but man only lives _upon_ its surface of less than 200 million\r\nsquare miles in extent, and he can not probe down as far as ten miles\r\nbelow it, through the depths of ocean or by his deepest mine. Thus we are\r\nleft with over 258 thousand million of cubic miles that man, or plant, or\r\nbeast can never make direct use of. But without this 258 thousand million\r\ncubic miles that he can never sow nor reap, the overlying platform on\r\nwhich he dwells would be useless for retaining the air or the water by\r\nwhich he lives. No less essential is the Sun; its vast bulk of\r\n\r\n  2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons\r\n\r\ncan, in no single unit, be counted \"waste,\" for it is from this that the\r\nheat and light necessary for life on the Earth is derived. But the tonnage\r\nof all the planets combined is but 0.13 per cent of the Sun alone; and a\r\nwastage, if such it is, like this is insignificant from a material point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nThere is a type of politician at the present day who is convinced that the\r\nhighest purpose to which land can be put is to build upon it; that being,\r\nin general, the use giving the highest money return per square foot,\r\nthough the return does not always fall to the builder. It has taken not a\r\nlittle agitation and popular pressure to enforce the truth that cultivated\r\nland is also of use. But there are few who realize that land that is\r\nneither built upon nor cultivated is also essential. Our barren moors and\r\nbleak hillsides, \"wastelands\" as we call them, are absolutely necessary as\r\ncollectors of the water by which we live. From them our springs take their\r\nsource; and they supply our cities with the first necessity of life.\r\n\r\nWe find, then, in this universe so far as we can know it, that Space is\r\nlavishly provided, Matter is lavishly scattered, Time is unsparingly drawn\r\nupon, but Life in any form, and especially in its highest form, is,\r\nrelatively speaking, very sparsely given. That very circumstance surely\r\npoints to the overwhelming importance of conscious, intelligent Life, and\r\nthe insignificance of lifeless matter in comparison with it. We have to\r\nexhaust arithmetic in computing the size, the mass, the output of heat and\r\nlight of our Sun, yet it is but the hearth-fire and lamp of terrestrial\r\nlife; and its amazing agglomeration of matter and energy is ungrudgingly\r\ndevoted to this humble purpose. Whatever view we hold as to the scheme of\r\nthe universe; whether with the unthinking we fail to recognize Thought and\r\nPurpose behind its marvellous manifestations, or, with the thoughtful,\r\nrealize that only Infinite Thought could provide so wonderfully for the\r\nbringing forth of thought in living material organisms, the conclusion\r\nstill remains: living intelligences are, by the direct testimony of the\r\nuniverse itself, its noblest and most precious product.\r\n\r\nThe plea is often made that as we find life adapting itself to a great\r\nvariety of conditions on this Earth, we must not set limits to its power\r\nof adaption to the conditions of other worlds. But this plea is an\r\nunthinking one. The range of conditions through which we find life on this\r\nEarth is as nothing to the range given by the varied sizes and positions\r\nof the different planets; and even on our Earth, life in the unfavoured\r\nregions--the tops of mountains, the polar snows, the waterless deserts,\r\nthe ocean depths--is only possible because there are more favoured regions\r\nclose at hand, and there are, as it were, \"crumbs that fall from the rich\r\nman's table.\" A well-known litterateur in setting forth \"a hundred ways of\r\nmaking money\" gave great prominence to the method of living as caretaker\r\nin an empty house. But residing in an empty house does not, in itself,\r\nsupply the means of sustenance; these have to be furnished by the\r\nwealthier man who employs the caretaker.\r\n\r\nAnother plea for vague sentiment in this matter is that we cannot expect\r\nthat intelligent beings on other worlds would have the same form as man,\r\nand if not the same form, then, that the same conditions of existence\r\nwould not hold good for them as for us. Both contentions are unsound.\r\nProtoplasm is the physical basis of all the life that we know, whatever\r\nits form; though these forms are to be counted by the million, and are as\r\ndiverse as they are numerous. And everywhere and always, water is found\r\nessential to protoplasmic life. Of life of any other kind we do not know\r\nany examples; we have no instance; if such exist, then they are beyond our\r\nken.\r\n\r\nAnd neither anthropologist nor biologist would admit that the form of\r\nintelligent life was an unrelated accident. Whether the form brought the\r\nintelligence, or the intelligence the form, or both were evolved together,\r\nthe one reacting on the other, the human form and the human intelligence\r\nare associated, and we feel this to be so of necessity. In 1891, Dr.\r\nEugene Dubois found in Java a molar tooth and a portion of a skull, and\r\nlater the thigh bone of the left leg, and two more teeth. Such as they\r\nwere, these relics appeared nearer in form to the corresponding fragments\r\nof an average Australian than to those of an ape, and on this ground\r\nintelligence was claimed for the creature of which they were the remains,\r\nand it was given the name of Pithecanthropus, or Ape-Man. The discovery\r\naroused much discussion, but on all sides it was unhesitatingly assumed\r\nthat the difference between the form of Pithecanthropus and that of the\r\nmost similar ape was an index of its superior intelligence over the ape,\r\njust in so far as that difference was in the direction of the modern human\r\nform. The same remark applies to the recent discovery of very ancient\r\nhuman remains in Sussex. Never at any time has it been supposed that the\r\nphysical frame has followed any other path in the evolution of\r\nintelligence than that which brought forth man. The flesh-eating animals\r\nhave attained efficiency in hunting and warfare by variation along many\r\ntypes of form; the herbivora have been not less varied in the forms by\r\nwhich as races they secured themselves from destruction; but Thought has\r\nbeen associated with the development of one type or form only, and the\r\nentire future of Thought on this planet rested neither with mammoth nor\r\ncave-bear, but with the possessor of the erect stature, the upward look,\r\nthe differentiation of hand and foot, even in their crudest and earliest\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nSwift, in _Gulliver's Travels_, conceived of a land where the intelligence\r\nand conscience of Man dwelt in the form of the horse, and the human form\r\ntabernacled the instincts of the beast. H. G. Wells, in his _War of the\r\nWorlds_, attributed intelligence to monsters--half-cuttlefish and\r\nhalf-anemone,--and the human form to their helpless, unresisting prey.\r\nBoth conceptions are as scientifically absurd as they are gross and\r\nrevolting; and if it were possible for the skeleton of creatures from\r\nother worlds to be brought to us here, then biologists would as\r\nconfidently pronounce on their intelligence as they do on the extinct\r\nforms of bygone ages--the nearer to the human form, the nearer to the\r\nhuman mind. We have found the figures of reindeer, horse, and mammoth\r\nscratched in outline on a mammoth tusk; but though the artist has left no\r\nother trace, we need no further evidence of his bodily form. Neither\r\nhorse, nor reindeer, nor mammoth made those rough outlines; they were\r\ndrawn by a man. More striking still, France yields us chipped flints by\r\nthe million, flints so slightly shaped that it is in dispute whether they\r\nmay not have been so broken by the action of torrents. But there are only\r\ntwo theories about them; either they were so chipped by natural action, or\r\nthey were designedly so chipped by creatures resembling ourselves in head\r\nand hand.\r\n\r\nThe question that has been dealt with in this volume is a scientific one,\r\nand the attempt has been made to treat it as such, and to argue from known\r\nphysical facts as to the conditions of worlds which we cannot visit. But\r\nby many the question is generally discussed wholly apart from physical\r\nfacts at all, and it becomes one of sentiment and of religious sympathy.\r\nYet, curiously enough, the division between those who think that all\r\nworlds must be inhabited and those who think that our own world stands\r\nalone is not coincident with any line of theological divisions, but rather\r\ncuts across all such. Some believers in Christianity argue that since God\r\nhas filled this world with Life, Life has been His purpose in the world,\r\nand must therefore have been His purpose in all other worlds--they too\r\nmust be filled with Life in like manner. Other believers argue that this\r\nworld was the scene of the Incarnation of Our Lord, and is therefore\r\nunique in that respect; and that this uniqueness sets its stamp upon this\r\nworld in all respects. Opponents to Christianity are divided into the same\r\ntwo classes, the one arguing that wherever there is matter the inevitable\r\ncourse of evolution will produce life, and eventually intelligent life.\r\nThe other class are equally clear that all forms of life are special, the\r\nresult of the particular environment, and that it is unreasonable to\r\nexpect that any other world has had the same history as our own, or that\r\nthe same special conditions have prevailed elsewhere. In other words the\r\nbelief that there are other inhabited worlds has depended chiefly neither\r\non science nor on religious belief, but upon sentiment. There are some who\r\nlike to think themselves, and the race to which they belong, altogether\r\nexceptional; others delight in finding themselves reflected wherever they\r\nlook. So far as Science has progressed and can return an answer to an\r\nenquiry that exceeds so far the bounds of our direct observation, it\r\ndissents from both orders of thought. The conditions of life are indeed\r\nnarrow, special, restricted; intelligent, organic life must, relatively\r\nspeaking, be a rarity in the universe, but we lack the information that\r\nwould enable us to affirm with any confidence that such life is only to be\r\nfound upon this world of ours. Heavy as the odds are against any\r\nparticular world being an inhabited one, yet when the limitless extent of\r\nspace is considered, and the innumerable numbers of stars and systems of\r\nstars, it seems but reasonable to conclude that though inhabited worlds\r\nare relatively rare, the absolute number of them may be considerable;\r\nconsiderable, if not at one particular moment of time, yet when the whole\r\nduration of the universe is admitted.\r\n\r\nBut there is a religious question connected with this enquiry; one that\r\ngoes down to the very roots of man's deepest thoughts and aspirations. As\r\nindividuals our days on the Earth are as a shadow, and there is none\r\nabiding; as individuals we pass and disappear; and though the race\r\nremains, yet as far as science can guide us and enable us to penetrate the\r\nfuture, the same lot awaits the race as well. Slowly but surely the water\r\nof a planet will combine with its substance or disappear into its crust.\r\nThe cooling of the Sun, though it may be long delayed, would seem to be\r\ninevitable in the sequel.\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, life as futile then as frail.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  What hope of answer or redress?\r\n  Behind the veil, behind the veil.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to this veil that we are now brought. It seems impossible to believe\r\nthat Life, so rare a fruit of the universe, intelligent Life, conscious\r\nLife, to which the long course of evolution has been so manifestly leading\r\nup all through the long ages, should have no better destiny than a final\r\nand hopeless extinction; that this Earth and all the efforts and\r\naspirations of the long generations of men should have no worthier end\r\nthan to swing, throughout the eternal ages, an empty, frozen heap of dust,\r\ncircling round the extinct cinder that was once its Sun. If we look\r\nbackward, we seem to discern clear signs of progress; if we look forward,\r\nwe discern nothing but the veil. Science is but organized experience, and\r\nexperience of the future we have none.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when on this world there was no life; a time when life\r\nbegan. How did it begin? Under what conditions?\r\n\r\nOf that great change--when non-living matter first became endowed with\r\nlife, became so endowed not by the action and intervention of other living\r\nmatter, but without it--we have no knowledge, no experience. And so long\r\nas this continues to be the case, that change, the greatest physical\r\nchange that has yet taken place in the history of the universe, the first\r\nchange of the non-living into the living, is outside the reach of science;\r\nit lies beyond its border. We may guess and speculate about it, but\r\nspeculation is not science; we may spin words about it with the utmost\r\nskill of the dialectician, but metaphysics is not science; it can never\r\ncome within the scope of science until it has first come within the scope\r\nof experience.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, a veil behind us as well as the one that encloses us\r\nin front; and as hitherto Science has failed to pierce the veil of the\r\npast, it is even less able to pierce the veil of the future; for of the\r\nfuture we have no experience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere, then, our enquiry must end, for it is an enquiry of physical\r\nscience; the search for living material organisms endowed with\r\nintelligence. How life first came upon this Earth, or when, or where, is\r\nbeyond the power of science to determine. Yet it did come. There was a\r\ntime when there was no life here; none, not even the humblest form of it;\r\nnor was there any hint or foreshadowing of it, still less of all its\r\ninfinities of form, and possibilities of development.\r\n\r\nOnce Life was not, yet Life came, and now, life is abundant, but abundant\r\nonly in worlds quite exceptional in their conditions, and therefore few in\r\nnumber; it is even conceivable that this Earth of ours may be unique. But\r\nlife as we know it, protoplasmic life, life dependent upon water, the life\r\nof intelligence united to the material organism, is under sentence of\r\ndeath. Has it any future beyond that veil? Is there any kind of life not\r\nsubject to these narrow limitations; not under the inexorable decree?\r\n\r\nTo questions such as these Science has no reply to give; it is even more\r\nhelpless to answer them than to determine how life first came; its\r\nexperience does not reach so far. Science can examine the present\r\nconditions of physical life, but whether or no that life can undergo a\r\nchange greater than that which passed upon the old inorganic world, it\r\ncannot determine. It has no experience.\r\n\r\nBut if Science is dumb, if the utmost exertion of human energy and power\r\nof research can throw no light on a future of which we have no experience,\r\nwe are not left without an answer. A voice has been heard, the voice of\r\nthe Son of God Himself:\r\n\r\n\"I am the Resurrection and the Life. He that believeth on Me, though he\r\nwere dead, yet shall he live.\"\r\n\r\nAnd accepting His word, the Church in all ages, and among all nations,\r\npeoples, and tongues, has made reply:\r\n\r\n\"I LOOK FOR THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD AND THE LIFE OF THE WORLD TO\r\nCOME.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbot, C.
