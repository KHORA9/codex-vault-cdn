It describes the nature of the food\r\nused by the domesticated animals, explains the composition of the animal\r\ntissues, and treats generally upon the important subject of nutrition.\r\nThe most recent analyses of all the kinds of food usually consumed by\r\nthe animals of the farm are fully stated; and the nutritive values of\r\nthose substances are in most instances given. Some information is\r\nafforded relative to the breeds and breeding of live stock; and a\r\ndivision of the Work is wholly devoted to the consideration of the\r\neconomic production of \"meat, milk, and butter.\"\r\n\r\nWithin the last twenty years the processes of chemical analysis have\r\nbeen so much improved, that the composition of organic bodies is now\r\ndetermined with great accuracy. The analyses of foods made from twenty\r\nto fifty years ago, possess now but little value. In this Work the\r\nanalyses of vegetables quoted are chiefly those recently performed by the\r\ndistinguished Scotch chemist, Dr. Thomas Anderson, and by Dr. Voelcker.\r\nThe Author believes that in no other Work of moderate size are there so\r\nmany analyses of food substances given, and ventures to hope that the\r\nsuccess of this Work may fully justify the belief that a \"handy\" book\r\ncontaining such information as that above mentioned, is much required\r\nby stock feeders.\r\n\r\n  _102, Lower Baggot Street, Dublin_,\r\n    April, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION: History of Agriculture--Agricultural Statistics--Imports\r\n  of Live Stock\r\n\r\n                                                                      1\r\n\r\nPART I.

In early ages wild beasts abounded in the numerous and\r\nextensive forests of Britain and Ireland; but men were few, for the\r\nconditions under which the maintenance of a dense population is possible\r\ndid not then exist. As civilisation progressed, men rapidly multiplied,\r\nand the demand for food increased. The pursuit of game became merely the\r\npastime of the rich; and tame sheep and oxen furnished meat to the lowly\r\nas well as to the great. Nor were the fruits of the earth neglected; for\r\nduring the latter days of the dominion of the Romans, England raised\r\nlarge quantities of corn. Gradually the food of the people, which at\r\nfirst was almost purely animal, became chiefly vegetable. The shepherds,\r\nwho had supplanted the hunters, became less numerous than the tillers of\r\nland; and the era of tillage husbandry began.\r\n\r\nAt present the great mass of the rural population of these countries\r\nsubsist almost exclusively upon vegetable aliment--a diet which poverty,\r\nand not inclination, prescribes for them. Were the flesh of animals\r\nthe staple food of the British peasantry, their numbers would not be\r\nnearly so large as they now are, for a given area of land is capable of\r\nsustaining a far larger number of vegetarians than of meat eaters. The\r\nChinese are by no means averse to animal food, but they are so numerous,\r\nthat they are in general obliged to content themselves on a purely\r\nvegetable diet.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacturing districts of Great Britain, there are several\r\nmillions of people whose condition in relation to food is somewhat\r\ndifferent from that of the small farmer and agricultural laborer. The\r\nartizans employed in our great industries are comparatively well paid\r\nfor their toil; and the results of their labor place within their reach\r\na fair share of animal food. This section of the population is rapidly\r\nincreasing, and consequently is daily augmenting the demand for meat.\r\nThe rural population is certainly not increasing; rather the reverse.\r\nLess manual labor is now expended in the operations of agriculture, and\r\neven horses are retiring before the advance of the steam plough. The\r\nonly great purely vegetable-feeding class is diminishing, and the upper,\r\nthe middle, and the artizan classes--the beef and mutton eating sections\r\nof society--are rapidly increasing. It is clear, then, that we are\r\nthreatened with a revival of the pastoral age, and that in one way, at\r\nleast, we are returning to the condition of our ancestors, whose staple\r\nfood consisted of beef, mutton, and pork.\r\n\r\nAnd here two questions arise. How long shall we be able to supply the\r\nincreasing demand for meat? How long shall we be able to compete with\r\nthe foreign feeders? These are momentous queries for the British farmer,\r\nand I trust they may be solved in a satisfactory manner. At any time\r\nduring the present century the foreign or colonial grower of wheat could\r\nhave undersold the British producer of that article, were the latter not\r\nprotected by a tariff; but cattle could not, as a general rule, be\r\nimported into Great Britain at a cheaper rate than they could be\r\nproduced at home. Were there no corn imported, it is certain that the\r\nprice of bread would be greater than it is now, even if the grain\r\nharvests had been better than they have been for some years past. A bad\r\ncereal harvest in England raises the price of flour, but only to a small\r\nand strictly limited extent, because, practically, there is no limit\r\nto the amount of bread-stuffs procurable from abroad. When, on the\r\ncontrary, the turnip crop fails, or that excessive drought greatly\r\ncurtails the yield of grass, the price of meat and butter increases\r\ngreatly, and is but slightly modified by the importation of foreign\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nHitherto the difficulty of transit has been so great that we have only\r\nderived supplies of live stock from countries situated at a short\r\ndistance, such as Holstein and Holland. Vast herds of cattle are fed\r\nwith but little expense in America, and myriads of sheep are maintained\r\ncheaply in Australia; but the immense distances which intervene between\r\nour country and those remote and sparsely populated regions have,\r\nhitherto, prevented the superabundant supply of animal food produced\r\ntherein from being available to the teeming population of the British\r\nIsles. Should, however, any cheap mode of conveying live stock, or even\r\ntheir flesh, from those and similarly circumstanced countries be\r\ndevised, it might render the production of meat in Britain a far less\r\nprofitable occupation than it is now. That we are increasing the area\r\nfrom whence we draw our supplies of live stock is evident from the fact,\r\nthat within the last two years enormous numbers of horned stock have\r\nbeen imported from Spain. In that extensive country there are noble\r\nbreeds of the ox; and it would appear that very large numbers of animals\r\ncould be annually exported, without depriving the inhabitants of a due\r\nsupply of bovine meat. As Spain is not very distant, it is likely that\r\nthis traffic will be increased, and that in a short time we shall be as\r\nwell supplied with Spanish beef as we are now provided with French\r\nflour. Meat is at present dear, and is likely to continue so for some\r\ntime; but still it is evident that, sooner or later, the British feeders\r\nwill come into keen competition with the foreign producer of meat, and\r\nthat the price of their commodity will consequently fall. The mere\r\nprobability of such a state of things, were there no other reason,\r\nshould induce the feeder to devote increased attention to the\r\nimprovement of his stock, and to discover more economical methods of\r\nfeeding them. There is still much to be learned relative to the precise\r\nnutritive values of the various feeding stuffs. The proper modes of\r\ncooking, or otherwise preparing, food, are still to be satisfactorily\r\ndetermined; and there are many very important questions in relation to\r\nthe breeding of stock yet unanswered.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to admit that the farmer is earnestly endeavouring to\r\nimprove his art, and that he is willing, nay anxious, to obtain the\r\nco-operation of scientific men, in order to increase his knowledge of\r\nthe theory as well as the practice of his ancient calling. Indeed, he\r\nnot only admits the utility of science in agriculture, but often places\r\nan undue degree of value upon the theories of the chemist, of the\r\nbotanist, and of the geologist. This is encouraging to the men of\r\nscience; but, on the other hand, they must admit that by far the greater\r\nportion of the sum of human knowledge has been derived from the\r\nexperience and observation of men utterly unacquainted with science, in\r\nthe ordinary signification of that term. This portion of our knowledge\r\nis also, in its practical application, the most valuable. In the most\r\nimportant branch of industry--agriculture--the labors of the purely\r\nscientific man have as yet borne but scant fruit; whilst the unaided\r\nefforts of the husbandman have reclaimed from sterility extensive\r\ntracts, and caused them to \"blossom as the rose.\" That practical men\r\nshould have done so much, and scientific men so little, for agriculture,\r\nmay easily be explained. Countless millions of men, during many\r\nthousands of years, have incessantly been occupied in improving the\r\nprocesses of mechanical agriculture, which, as an _art_, has\r\nconsequently been brought to a high degree of perfection: but scientific\r\nagriculture is a creation of almost our own time, and the number of its\r\ncultivators is, and always has been, very small; all its theories cannot,\r\ntherefore, justly claim that degree of confidence which, as a rule, is\r\nonly reposed in the opinions founded on the experience of practical\r\nworkers in the field and in the feeding-house. Still, the farmer has\r\nderived a great amount of useful information from the chemist and\r\nphysiologist; and they alone can explain to him the causes of the\r\nvarious phenomena which the different branches of his art present. There\r\nwas a time when it was the fashion of the man of science to look down\r\nwith contempt, from the lofty pedestal on which he placed himself, upon\r\nthe lessons of practical experience read to him by the cultivator of the\r\nsoil; whilst at the same time the farmer treated as foolish visionaries\r\nthose who applied the teachings of science to the improvement of their\r\nart. But this time has happily passed away. The scientific man no longer\r\ndespises the knowledge of the mere farmers, but turns to good account\r\nthe information derivable from their experience; whilst the farmer, on\r\nthe other side, has ceased to speak in contemptuous terms of mere \"book\r\nlearning.\" It is to this happy combination of the theorist with the\r\npractical man that the recent remarkable advance in agriculture is\r\nchiefly due; and to it we may confidently look for improvement in the\r\neconomic production of meat and butter, and for the enlargement of our\r\nknowledge of the relative value of food substances.\r\n\r\n  STATEMENT OF THE NUMBER OF LIVE STOCK IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.\r\n\r\n  ---------+------------------------------------+\r\n           |         Enumerated, 1866.

========\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nON THE GROWTH AND COMPOSITION OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE.\r\n\r\n_Functions of Plants._--It is the primary function of plants to convert\r\nthe inorganic matter of the soil and air into organised structures\r\nof a highly complex nature. The food of plants is purely mineral, and\r\nconsists chiefly of water, carbonic acid, and ammonia. Water is composed\r\nof the elements oxygen and hydrogen; carbonic acid is a compound of\r\noxygen and carbon; and ammonia is formed of hydrogen and nitrogen. These\r\nfour substances are termed the _organic elements_, because they form by\r\nfar the larger portion--sometimes the whole--of organic bodies. The\r\ncombustible portion of plants and animals is composed of the organic\r\nelements; the incombustible part is made up of potassium, sodium, and\r\nthe various other elements enumerated in another page. The organic\r\nelements are furnished chiefly by the atmosphere, and the incombustible\r\nmatters are supplied by the soil.\r\n\r\nWater in the state of vapor forms, according to the temperature and\r\nother conditions of the atmosphere, from a half per cent. to four and a\r\nhalf per cent. of the weight of that fluid--about 1.25 per cent. being\r\nthe average; carbonic acid exists in it to the extent of 1/2000th; and\r\nammonia forms a minute portion of it--according to Dr. Angus Smith, one\r\ngrain weight in 412.42 cubic feet of air (of a town), or 0.000453 per\r\ncent. It is remarkable that the most abundant constituents of atmospheric\r\nair--oxygen and nitrogen--are not assimilable by plants, although these\r\nelements enter largely into the composition of vegetable substances. In\r\nthe soil, also, the part which ministers to the wants of vegetables is\r\nrelatively quite insignificant in amount.\r\n\r\nPlants are unendowed with organs of locomotion, their food must\r\ntherefore be within easy reach. Every breeze wafts gaseous nutriment to\r\ntheir expanded leaves, and their rootlets ramify throughout the soil in\r\nsearch of appropriate mineral aliment. But no matter how abundant, or\r\nhowever easy of reach may be the food of plants, the vegetable organism\r\nis incapable of partaking of it unless under the influence of light.\r\nExposed to this potent stimulus, the plant collects the gaseous carbonic\r\nacid and the vaporous water, solidifies them, decomposes them, and\r\ncombines their elements into new and organised forms. In effecting these\r\nchanges--in conferring vitality upon the atoms of lifeless matter--the\r\nplant acts merely as the _mechanism_, the light is the _force_. As the\r\nwork performed by the steam-engine is proportionate to the amount of\r\nforce developed by the combustion of the fuel beneath its boiler,\r\nso is the rapidity of the elaboration of organic substances by plants\r\nproportionate to the amount of sunlight to which they are exposed. It is\r\nan axiom that matter is indestructible; we may alter its form as often\r\nas we please, but we cannot destroy a particle of it. It is the same\r\nwith _force_: we may convert one kind of it into another--heat into\r\nlight, or magnetism into electricity--but our power ends there; we can\r\nonly cause force, or _motion_, to pass from one of its conditions to\r\nanother, but its _quantity_ can never be diminished by the power of man.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the Conservation of the Forces gives us a clear\r\nexplanation of the fact that animals can obtain their food only through\r\nthe medium of the vegetable kingdom. Plants are stationary mechanisms;\r\nthey have no need to develop motive power, as animals have, in moving\r\nthemselves from place to place. Their temperature is, we may say, the\r\nsame as that of the medium in which they exist. Such beings as plants\r\ndo not, therefore, require the expenditure of force to maintain their\r\nvitality; on the contrary, their mechanisms are, for a beneficent\r\npurpose, constructed for the _accumulation_ of force. The growing\r\nplant absorbs, together with carbonic acid, water, and ammonia, a\r\nproportionate amount of light, heat, and the various other subtile\r\nforces which have their abiding place in the sun-beam--\r\n\r\n                              \"That golden chain,\r\n  Whose strong embrace holds heaven and earth and main.\"\r\n\r\nCo-incidentally with the conversion of the mineral constituents of the\r\nfood of plants into organised structures--albumen, fibre, and such\r\nlike substances--the light, and the heat, and the various other forces\r\nlikewise suffer a change. Although the precise nature of the new force\r\ninto which they are converted is still a mystery--one, too, which may\r\nnever be revealed to us--still we know sufficient of it to satisfy\r\nus that it can only exist in connection with organic or organised\r\nstructures. It is owing to its presence that the elements of these\r\nstructures (the natural state of which is mineral) are bound together\r\nin what may be aptly designated a constrained state; or, as Liebig\r\naptly expresses it, like the matter in a bent spring. So long as the\r\norganic structure retains its form, it will be a reservoir of latent\r\nforce--which will manifest itself in some form during the recoil of the\r\natoms of the matter forming the structure to their original mineral, or\r\nstatical condition: so the bent spring, when the pressure is removed,\r\nreturns to its original straight form.\r\n\r\n_Animal Life._--The chief manifestation of the life of a plant is the\r\naccumulation of force; very different are the functions of animal life.\r\nIt is only by the continuous _expenditure_ of force that the vitality of\r\nanimals is preserved; the heat of a man's body, his power of locomotion,\r\nthe performance of his daily toil, even his very faculty of thought, are\r\nall dependent upon, and to a great extent proportionate to, the amount\r\nof organised matter disorganised in his body. It is by the conversion\r\nof this organised matter into its original mineral state of water,\r\ncarbonic acid, and ammonia, that the force originally expended in\r\narranging, through the agency of plants, its atoms, is again restored,\r\nchiefly in the form of heat and animal motive power.\r\n\r\nAnimals, as a class, are completely dependent upon vegetables for\r\ntheir existence. There is every reason to believe that the most lowly\r\norganised beings in the scale of animal life, even those of so\r\nsimple a structure as to have been long regarded as vegetables or as\r\nplant-animals, are incapable of organising mineral matter. The so-called\r\nvegetative life of animals--for I believe the term to be exceedingly\r\ninexact--is applied to their growth, that is, to the increase in their\r\nweight. This increase takes place by their power of reorganising, or\r\nof assimilating to the nature of their own organisms, certain of the\r\nsubstances elaborated by plants, and destined to become food for\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF ORGANIC SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n_Elements of Organic Bodies._--The number of distinct kinds of\r\nsubstances--each distinguishable from all the others by the peculiarity\r\nof its properties, taken as a whole--is exceedingly great, yet all\r\nthese substances are resolvable into a very small number of bodies.\r\nAs an illustration, I shall take a well-known substance, common\r\ngreen copperas, or, as the chemists term it, protosulphate of iron.\r\nBy submitting this compound to the process termed chemical analysis,\r\ntwo other kinds of matter may be obtained from it, namely, oxide of iron\r\nand oil of vitrol, or sulphuric acid. If we continued this process--if\r\nwe submitted the acid and the oxide to analysis--we could separate the\r\nformer into sulphur and oxygen, and the latter into iron and oxygen.\r\nNow, by these means we could demonstrate the compound nature of\r\ncopperas; we could prove that it was _proximately_ composed of sulphuric\r\nacid and oxide of iron; and, _ultimately_, of iron, sulphur, and oxygen.\r\n\r\nIron, sulphur, and oxygen, are elementary, or simple bodies. They cannot\r\nbe decomposed; they cannot be analysed. Torture them as we will in our\r\ncrucibles; expose them as we please to the highest temperature of a wind\r\nfurnace, or to the more intense heat evolved by a powerful galvanic\r\nbattery; subject them to the influence of any agent, or force, or\r\nprocess we may choose, and still they will yield nothing but iron,\r\nsulphur, and oxygen: hence these undecomposable bodies are regarded as\r\n_elements_, or simple substances. So far as our knowledge extends, there\r\nare about sixty-six of these undecomposable bodies, of which about one\r\nhalf occurs in but exceedingly minute quantities, and a considerable\r\nnumber of the others exists in comparatively small amounts. As by far\r\nthe greater proportion of compounds is made up of two or more of about\r\na dozen elementary bodies, it would at first sight appear as if the\r\ndistinct kinds of compounds which exist, or which may be called into\r\nexistence by the chemist, must be limited to, at most, a realisable\r\nnumber; but the fact is there is no practical limit to the variety of\r\nsubstances which may be artificially formed. Every difference in the\r\nmode of the arrangement of the constituent atoms of a compound, causes\r\nits metamorphosis into another kind of substance. To prove that the\r\nnumber of these changes is bounded by no narrow limits, I need but refer\r\nto the rules of Permutation, which demonstrate that twelve letters of\r\nthe alphabet may be arranged in no fewer than 479,000,000 different\r\nways.[1] The elements are the letters of Nature's alphabet, their\r\ncompounds are the words of the language of Creation. The combinations\r\nof sounds and of signs which express the ideas and sensations of man may\r\nbe limited to millions; but numberless are the hieroglyphs by which the\r\nDivine wisdom and beneficence is inscribed on the pages of the\r\nmagnificent volume of Nature.\r\n\r\nOf the sixty-six elementary bodies, not more than a dozen occur\r\ncommonly in animal and vegetable substances; these are Oxygen, Hydrogen,\r\nNitrogen, Carbon, Sulphur, Phosphorus, Chlorine, Silicium, Potassium,\r\nSodium, Calcium, Magnesium, and Iron. In addition to these, Iodine, and\r\nsometimes Bromine, are found in plants which grow in or near the sea;\r\nand the former element has also been detected in some of the lower\r\nanimals, and in land plants. Manganese, Lithium, Caesium, Rubidium,\r\nand a few others of the simple bodies, occasionally occur in plants and\r\nanimals, but I believe their presence therein is always accidental.\r\n\r\n_Proximate Composition of Animal Substances._--The differences between\r\nvegetable and animal substances are often more apparent than real.\r\nIndeed many of the more important of these substances are almost\r\nidentical in composition. The albumen which coagulates when the juices\r\nof vegetables are boiled, is identical with the albumen of the white\r\nof eggs; the fibrine of wheat is in no respect chemically different\r\nfrom the fibrine, or clot, of the blood; and, lastly, the legumine,\r\nor _vegetable caseine_, of peas is almost indistinguishable from the\r\ncurd of milk, or _animal caseine_. But not only has chemical research\r\ndemonstrated the identity of the albumen, fibrine, and caseine of\r\nvegetables with three of the more important constituents of animals, it\r\nhas gone a step further, and proved that they differ from each other in\r\nbut a few unimportant respects. They are unquestionably convertible into\r\neach other[2] within the animal organism; and their functions, as elements\r\nof nutrition, are almost, if not quite, identical.\r\n\r\nExclusive of the blood, which contains the elements of every part of\r\nthe body, the animal organism is composed of three distinct classes of\r\nsubstances--namely, _nitrogenous_, _non-nitrogenous_, and _mineral_.\r\nAll of these constituents, or substances capable of being converted\r\ninto them, must exist in the food. Certain articles, for example, milk,\r\ncontains all of them; but in others, for instance, butter, only one of\r\nthese substances is found. The nitrogenous part of the body embraces the\r\nmuscles, or lean flesh, the gelatine of the bones, and the skin and its\r\nappendages--such as hair and horns; the non-nitrogenous constituents are\r\nits fat and oil; and its mineral matter is found chiefly in the bony\r\nframework. These constituents are not, however, isolated: the mineral\r\nmatter, no doubt, accumulates in certain parts, but in small quantities\r\nit is found in every portion of the body; and although the fat forms a\r\ndistinct tissue, the muscles of the leanest animal are never free from\r\na sensible proportion of it.\r\n\r\nAlbumen, fibrine, and caseine are the principal nitrogenous constituents\r\nof food, and as they are employed in the reparation of the nitrogenous\r\ntissues of the animal body, they have been termed _flesh-formers_.\r\n\r\nThe fat and oil of animals are derived either from vegetable oil and\r\nfat, or from some such substance as starch or sugar. The constituents\r\nof food which form fat are termed _fat-formers_, and sometimes\r\n_heat-givers_ or _respiratory elements_, from the notion that their\r\nslow combustion in the animal body is the chief cause of its high\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe mineral elements of the body are furnished principally by the\r\nvarieties of food which contain nitrogen. The whey of milk is rich in\r\nthem; but they do not exist in pure butter, in starch, or in sugar.\r\n\r\nFat is a much more abundant constituent of the animal body than is\r\ngenerally supposed, That this substance should constitute the greater\r\nportion of the weight of an obese pig seems probable enough; but few\r\nare aware that even in a lean sheep there is 50 per cent. more fat than\r\nlean.\r\n\r\nFor a very accurate knowledge of the relative proportions of the fatty,\r\nnitrogenous, and mineral constituents of the carcasses of animals used\r\nas human food, we are indebted to Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert. Before\r\nthese investigators turned their attention to this subject, it had\r\nscarcely attracted the notice of scientific men; but a notion appears to\r\nhave been current, amongst non-scientific people, at least, that in all,\r\nsave the fattest animals, the lean flesh greatly preponderated over the\r\nfat. That this idea was unsustained by a foundation of fact, has been\r\nclearly proved by the results of an investigation[3] undertaken a few\r\nyears ago by Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert--an investigation which I cannot\r\navoid characterising as one of the most laborious and apparently\r\ntrustworthy on record. The mere statement of the results of this inquiry\r\noccupies 187 pages of one of the huge volumes of the Transactions of the\r\nRoyal Society--a fact which best indicates the immensity of the labour\r\nwhich these gentlemen imposed upon themselves, and which, independently\r\nof their other and numerous contributions to scientific agriculture,\r\nentitles their names to most honourable mention in the annals of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nI shall now briefly advert to a few of the more important facts\r\nestablished by Lawes and Gilbert. From a large number of oxen, sheep,\r\nand pigs, on which feeding experiments were being conducted, ten\r\nindividuals were selected. These were, a fat calf, a half-fat ox, a\r\nmoderately fat ox, a fat lamb, a store sheep, a half-fat old sheep, a\r\nfat sheep, a very fat sheep, a store pig, and a fat pig. These animals\r\nwere killed, and the different organs and parts of their bodies were\r\nseparately weighed and analysed. The results were, that, with the\r\nexception of the calf, all the animals contained, respectively, more fat\r\nthan lean. The fat ox and the fat lamb contained each three times as\r\nmuch fat as lean flesh, and the proportion of the fatty matters to the\r\nnitrogenous constituents of the carcass of the very fat sheep was as 4\r\nto 1. In the pig the fat greatly preponderated over the lean; the store\r\npig containing three times as much, and the fat pig five times as much\r\nfat as lean.\r\n\r\nThat part of the animal which is consumed as food by man, is termed the\r\n_carcass_ by the butcher, and contains by far the greater portion of\r\nthe fat of the animal. The _offal_, in the language of the butcher,\r\nconstitutes those parts which are not commonly consumed as human food,\r\nat least by the well-to-do classes. In calves, oxen, lambs, and sheep,\r\nthe offal embraces the skin, the feet, and the head, and all the\r\ninternal organs, excepting the kidneys and their fatty envelope. The\r\noffal of the pig is made up of all the internal organs, excepting the\r\nkidneys and kidney fat. It is the relative proportion of fat in the\r\ncarcasses analysed by Lawes and Gilbert that I have stated; but as the\r\nnitrogenous matters occur in greatest quantity in the offal, it is\r\nnecessary that the relative proportions of the constituents of the body,\r\ntaken as a whole, should be considered. On an average, then, it will be\r\nfound that a fat fully-grown animal will contain 49 per cent. of water,\r\n33 per cent. of dry fat, 13 per cent. of dry nitrogenous matter--muscles\r\nseparated from fat, hide, &c.--and 3 per cent. of mineral matter. In a\r\nlean animal the average proportions of the various constituents will be\r\n54 per cent. of water, 25-1/2 per cent. dry fat, 17 per cent. of dry\r\nnitrogenous substances, and 3-1/2 per cent. of mineral matter. In the\r\nfollowing table these proportions are set forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SUMMARY OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE TEN ANIMALS--SHOWING THE\r\n  PER-CENTAGES OF MINERAL MATTER, DRY NITROGENOUS COMPOUNDS,\r\n  FAT, TOTAL DRY SUBSTANCE, AND WATER.\r\n\r\n  1st.

ANIMAL ECONOMY.\r\n\r\nAs fat forms so large a portion of the body, it is evident that\r\nthe part it plays in the animal economy must be a most important one.\r\nThe general opinion which prevails amongst scientific men as to its\r\nphysiological functions was originated by the celebrated Liebig.\r\nAccording to his theory, the food of animals includes two distinct kinds\r\nof substances--_plastic_[4] and _non-plastic_. The plastic materials are\r\ncomposed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and a little sulphur\r\nand phosphorus. Albumen, fibrine, and casein are plastic elements of\r\nnutrition; they form the lean flesh, or muscles, the membranes, and\r\ncartilages, the gelatine of the bones, the skin, the hair, and, in\r\nshort, every part of the body which contains nitrogen. The _non-plastic_\r\nelements of nutrition include fat, oil, starch, sugar, gum, and certain\r\nconstituents of fruits, such as pectine.\r\n\r\nAll non-plastic substances--and of each kind there are numerous\r\nvarieties--are capable of conversion, in the animal mechanism, into fat\r\nand oil. The non-plastic food substances do not contain nitrogen, hence\r\nthey are commonly termed non-nitrogenous elements. The oily and fatty\r\nmatters contain a large proportion of carbon, their next most abundant\r\ncomponent is hydrogen, and they contain but little oxygen. Unlike the\r\nplastic elements, they are--except the fats of the brain and nervous\r\ntissue--altogether destitute of sulphur and phosphorus. The starchy,\r\nsaccharine, and gummy substances are composed of the same elements as\r\nthe fatty bodies, but they contain a higher proportion of oxygen.\r\nAccording to Liebig, fat is used in the animal economy as a source of\r\ninternal heat. We all know that it is a most combustible body, and that\r\nduring its inflammation the most intense heat is developed. It is less\r\nevident, but not less true, that heat is evolved during its slow\r\noxidation, or decay.\r\n\r\nThe more rapidly a body burns, the greater is the amount of heat evolved\r\nby it in a _given time_; but the total amount of heat developed by a\r\nspecific weight of the body is the same, whether the combustion takes\r\nplace rapidly or slowly. An experiment performed with phosphorus\r\nillustrates the case perfectly. If we burned two pieces of equal weight,\r\nthe one in oxygen, the other in atmospheric air, we should find that the\r\nformer would emit a light five times as brilliant as that evolved by the\r\nlatter, for the simple reason that its combustion would be five times as\r\nrapid. The white, vapor-like matter into which phosphorus is converted\r\nby its combustion, is termed _phosphoric acid_. It is composed of\r\nphosphorus and oxygen. In forming an ounce of this compound, by the\r\ndirect oxidation, or combustion of phosphorus, the amount of force,\r\neither as heat, or as heat and light, evolved is precisely the same,\r\nwhether the time expended in the process be a minute or a month.[5] If,\r\nin the experiment I have described, we were to substitute two pieces of\r\nfat for the fragments of phosphorus, the results would be precisely\r\nsimilar. The fat burned in oxygen gas would emit intense light and heat;\r\nbut the total amount of these forces evolved would be neither greater\r\nnor less than that developed during the slower and therefore less\r\nbrilliant combustion of the fat in ordinary atmospheric air. Now, as we\r\ncan demonstrate that an ounce of fat will emit a certain amount of heat,\r\nif burned within a minute of time, and that neither a larger nor a\r\nsmaller amount will be developed if the combustion of the fat extend\r\nover a period of five minutes, I think we may fairly assume that the\r\namount of heat evolved by the complete oxidation of a specific quantity\r\nof fat is constant under all conditions, except, as I have already\r\nexplained, at high temperatures, when a portion of the heat is converted\r\ninto light.\r\n\r\nIn the animal organism fat is burned. The process of combustion no\r\ndoubt is a very slow one, but still the total amount of heat evolved\r\nis just the same as if the fat were consumed in a furnace. When the\r\nfat constituting a candle is burned, what becomes of it? Its elements,\r\ncarbon and hydrogen (we may disregard its small amount of oxygen)\r\ncombine with the oxygen of the air, and form carbonic acid gas and\r\nwater. What becomes of the fat consumed within the animal body? It also\r\nis converted into carbonic acid gas and water. It is not difficult\r\nto prove these statements to be facts. A candle will not burn in\r\natmospheric air which has been deprived of its oxygen, because there is\r\nno substance present with which the elements of the taper can combine,\r\nconsequently the process of combustion cannot go on. Now, a man may in\r\none respect be compared with this taper. He is partly made up of fat;\r\nthat fat is consumed by the oxygen of the air, and the heat developed\r\nthereby keeps the body warm. In the process of respiration oxygen is\r\nintroduced into the lungs, and from thence, by means of the blood\r\nvessels, is conveyed throughout every part of the body. In some way, at\r\npresent not thoroughly understood, the elements of the fat combine with\r\nthe oxygen, and are converted into carbonic acid gas and water, which\r\nare exhaled from the lungs and from the surface of the body.\r\n\r\nFat is a constituent of both animals and plants. The animal derives a\r\nportion of its fat directly from the vegetable; but it possesses the\r\npower of forming this substance from other organic bodies, such, for\r\nexample, as starch. Plants elaborate fat directly from the\r\nminerals--carbonic acid gas, and water.\r\n\r\nI have already explained that the growth of plants is, _caeteris\r\nparibus_, directly proportionate to the amount of sunlight to which\r\nthey are exposed. Not less certainly is the force which constitutes the\r\nsun-beam expended in grouping mineral atoms into organic forms, than is\r\nthe heat which converts water into steam. But in neither case is the\r\nforce destroyed. When the vaporous steam is condensed into the liquid\r\nwater, all the heat is restored, and becomes palpable. By the ultimate\r\ndecomposition of vegetable substances all the force expended on their\r\nproduction is liberated, and, in some form, becomes manifest.\r\n\r\nWhen the fat formed in the mechanisms of plants is decomposed in\r\nthe animal organism, two results follow:--The atoms of the fat are\r\nre-converted to their original mineral, or statical conditions of\r\ncarbonic acid gas and water; and the force which maintained them in\r\ntheir organic state is set free as heat, and its equivalent, motive\r\npower.\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful instruments which the ingenuity of man has\r\ndevised, is the Thermometer. It is so familiarly known that I need\r\nnot describe it. This instrument does not enable us to estimate the\r\nactual quantity of heat contained in a substance, but it indicates\r\nthe proportion of that subtile element which is _sensible_--that is\r\nrecognisable by the sense of touch. The dusky Hindu, clad in his single\r\ncotton garment, and the Laplander in his suit of fur, are placed under\r\nthe most opposite conditions in relation to the heat of the sun--the\r\nIndian is exposed during the whole year to Sol's most ardent beams,\r\nwhilst but a scant share of its genial rays goes to warm the body of\r\nthe Laplander. Now, if we placed the bulb of a thermometer beneath the\r\ntongue of a Hindu, we would find the mercury to stand at 98 degrees on\r\nFahrenheit's scale, and if we repeated the experiment on a Laplander,\r\nwe would obtain an identical result. Numerous experiments of this\r\nnature have been made on individuals in most parts of the world, and\r\nthe results have proved that the temperature of the blood of man is\r\n98 degrees Fahrenheit, whether he be in India or at Nova Zembla, on\r\nthe _steppes_ of Russia, or the elevated _plateaus_ of America. This\r\ninvariability[6] of the temperature of the bodies of men and of all\r\nother warm-blooded animals, appears the more wonderful when it it is\r\nconsidered that the range of the temperature of the medium in which\r\nthey exist exceeds 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In India, the mercury in the\r\nthermometer has been observed to stand at 145 degrees in the direct\r\nsunlight, and at 120 degrees in the shade. In high latitudes the\r\ntemperature is sometimes so low as 100 degrees below zero. A Russian\r\narmy, in an expedition to China, in 1839, was exposed for several\r\nsuccessive days to a temperature of 42 degrees below zero, and suffered\r\nseverely in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe facts which I have cited clearly prove that the animal body\r\npossesses the power of generating, or, to speak more correctly,\r\nliberating heat, either from portions of its own mechanism or from\r\nsubstances placed within that mechanism.\r\n\r\nAt one time it was the general belief amongst physiologists that one\r\nportion of the food consumed by an animal was employed in repairing\r\nthe waste of its body, and the remaining part was burned as fuel,\r\nevolving heat just in the same way as if it had been consumed in a\r\nfurnace. It was this theory that led to the classification of food into\r\nflesh-formers, and heat-givers. It is now doubted if any portion of the\r\nfood be really burned in this way; and I, for one, think it far more\r\nprobable that, before its conversion into carbonic acid gas and water\r\n(whereby, according to this theory, it develops the heat which keeps the\r\nbody warm), it first becomes assimilated, that is, becomes an integral\r\npart of the animal body--blood, fat, muscle. Perhaps we would be\r\nnearer the truth if we were to assume that heat is evolved during the\r\ndecomposition of both the nitrogenous and fatty constituents of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe constantly recurring contractions of the muscles must alone be a\r\nsource of much heat. The development of animal motive power is said to\r\nbe strictly proportionate to the amount of muscular tissue decomposed.\r\nAs the nitrogen of the latter is almost completely excreted under the\r\nform of urea, the quantity of the latter daily eliminated from the\r\nbody of an animal is a measure of the decomposed muscular tissue, and\r\nconsequently of the amount of muscular power generated in the animal\r\norganism.[7] The correspondence between the amount of the motive power\r\nof an animal, and the quantity of effete nitrogen excreted from the\r\nbody, is limited to laboring men and to the lower animals. Strange as\r\nit may appear, it is an incontrovertible fact that men whose pursuits\r\nrequire the constant exercise of the intellectual faculties--lawyers,\r\nwriters, statesmen, students, scientific men, and other\r\nbrain-workers--excrete more urea than do men engaged in the most\r\nphysically laborious occupations. An activity of thoughts and ideas\r\ninvolves a corresponding destruction of the tissues, and these require,\r\nfor their reparation, the consumption of food. Here, then, we have a\r\nphysical meaning for the common expression--\"food for thought.\"\r\n\r\nThat the amount of heat developed in the animal organism, is\r\nproportionate to the quantity of fatty matters (or of substances capable\r\nof forming them) supplied to it in the shape of food, is a proposition\r\nwhich admits of easy demonstration. The natives of warm regions do not\r\nrequire the generation of much heat within their bodies, because the\r\ntemperature of the medium in which they exist is generally as high as,\r\nor higher than, that of their blood. But as they must consume food for\r\nthe purpose of repairing the waste of their nitrogenous tissues, and as\r\nevery kind of food contains heat-producing elements, an excess of heat\r\nis developed within their bodies, which, if allowed to accumulate, would\r\nspeedily produce fatal results. The means by which nature removes this\r\nsuperabundant heat are admirably simple, as indeed all its contrivances\r\nare. The skin is permeated with millions of pores, and through these\r\nopenings a large quantity of vapor is given off, and carries with it the\r\nsurplus heat. The pores are the orifices of minute convoluted tubes\r\nwhich lie beneath the skin, and when straightened measure each about the\r\ntenth of an inch, or, according to a writer in the _British and Foreign\r\nMedico-Chirurgical Review_ (1859, page 349), the one-fifteenth of an\r\ninch in length. According to Erasmus Wilson, the number of these tubes\r\nwhich open into every square inch of the surface of the body is 2,800.\r\nThe total number of square inches on the surface of an average sized man\r\nis 2,500, consequently the surface of his body is drained by not less\r\nthan twenty-eight miles of tubing, furnished with 7,000,000 openings.\r\nThe cooling of the body, by the evaporation of water from it, admits of\r\nexplanation by well-known natural laws. Water, in the state of vapor,\r\noccupies a space 1,700 fold greater than it does in its liquid\r\ncondition. It is heat which causes its vaporous form, but it ceases to\r\nbe heat when it has accomplished this change in the condition of the\r\nliquid; for, suffering itself an alteration, it passes into another form\r\nof force--mechanical, or motive power. The heat generated within the\r\nbody is absorbed by the liquid water, the conversion of the latter into\r\nvapor follows, and both the heat and the water, in their altered forms,\r\nescape through the pores.\r\n\r\n_Fatty food necessary in cold climates._--As a grave objection against\r\nthe chemical theory of heat, it has been urged that rice--the pabulum of\r\nhundreds of millions of the inhabitants of tropical regions--contains an\r\nexceedingly high proportion of heat-giving substances. I have, however,\r\ngreat doubt as to rice ever forming the exclusive food of those people,\r\nwithout their health being impaired in consequence of the deficiency in\r\nthat substance of the plastic elements of nutrition. Indeed I believe\r\nit is a great mistake to assert that the natives of India live almost\r\nexclusively on rice. This article, no doubt, forms a large proportion of\r\ntheir food, but it is supplemented with pulse (the produce of leguminous\r\nplants), which is rich in flesh-forming materials, also with dried fish,\r\nbutter, and various kinds of vegetable and animal food rich in nitrogen.\r\nThe innutritious nature of rice is clearly shown by its chemical\r\ncomposition, and so large a quantity of it must the Hindu consume in\r\norder to repair the waste of his body, that his stomach sometimes\r\nacquires prodigious dimensions; hence the term \"pot-bellied,\" so often\r\napplied to the Indian ryot. I doubt very much, however, if the stomach\r\nof the Hindu, large as it is, could accommodate a quantity of rice, the\r\ncombustion of which would produce a very excessive development of heat.\r\nThis substance, when cooked, contains a high proportion of water, the\r\nevaporation of which carries off a large amount of the heat generated\r\nby the combustion of its respiratory constituents. The amount of motive\r\npower developed by the Hindu is small as compared with that which the\r\nEuropean is capable of exerting; hence he has less necessity for a\r\nhighly nitrogenous diet. On the whole, then, I am disposed to think\r\nthat the food of the natives of tropical climates contains sufficient\r\nnitrogenous matters to effectually build up and keep in repair their\r\nbodies; it also appears clear to me that the amount of heat developed\r\nin their bodies is not excessive, and that it is readily disposed of\r\nin converting the water, which enters so largely into their diet, into\r\nvapor. The proportion of plastic to non-plastic elements in the diet\r\nof the Hindu and of the well-fed European, is probably as follows:--\r\n\r\n                     Nitrogenous.            Non-nitrogenous\r\n                                         (calculated as starch.)\r\n\r\n  Hindu                   1         to                9\r\n  European                1         to                8\r\n\r\n\r\nThis statement does not quite correspond with Liebig's, who estimates\r\nthe proportion of nitrogenous to non-nitrogenous substances in rice as\r\n10 to 123, in beef as ten to seventeen, and in veal as ten to one. The\r\nresults of Lawes and Gilbert's investigations, already alluded to, have,\r\nhowever, dispelled the illusion that the plastic constituents of flesh\r\nexceed its non-plastic. In the potato, which at one time constituted\r\nmore of the food of the Irish peasantry than rice does that of the\r\nHindu, the proportion of plastic to non-plastic materials is as 10 to\r\n110. The results of some analyses of the food grains consumed in the\r\nPresidency of Madras, made by Professor Mayer, of the University of\r\nMadras, clearly prove that the food of the inhabitants of that part of\r\nIndia is of a far more highly nitrogenous character than is generally\r\nsupposed. That the Hindu, who subsists exclusively on rice, exhibits\r\nall the symptoms of deficient nutrition, is a fact to which numerous\r\ncompetent observers have testified.\r\n\r\nA slight consideration of the facts which I have mentioned leads to the\r\nconclusion that the food of the inhabitants of very cold regions is\r\nrequired to produce a large amount of heat. Melons, rice, and other\r\nwatery vegetable productions, however delicious to the palate of the\r\nHindu, would be rejected with disgust by the Esquimaux, whilst the train\r\noil, blubber, and putrid seal's flesh which the children of the icy\r\nNorth consider highly palatable, would excite the loathing of the East\r\nIndian. On this subject I may appositely quote the following remarks by\r\nDr. Kane, the Arctic explorer:--\"Our journeys have taught us the wisdom\r\nof the Esquimaux appetite, and there are few among us who do not relish\r\na slice of raw blubber, or a chunk of frozen walrus beef. The liver of\r\na walrus (awuktanuk), eaten with little slices of his fat--of a verity\r\nit is a delicious morsel. Fire would seem to spoil the curt, pithy\r\nexpression of vitality which belongs to its uncooked juices. Charles\r\nLamb's roast pig was nothing to awuktanuk. I wonder that raw beef is not\r\neaten at home. Deprived of extraneous fibre, it is neither indigestible\r\nnor difficult to masticate. With acids and condiments, it makes a salad\r\nwhich an educated palate cannot help relishing; and as a powerful and\r\ncondensed heat-making and anti-scorbutic food, it has no rival. I make\r\nthis last broad assertion after carefully considering its truth. The\r\nnatives of South Greenland prepare themselves for a long journey, by a\r\ncourse of frozen seal. At Upper Navik they do the same with the narwhal,\r\nwhich is thought more heat-making than the seal; while the bear, to use\r\ntheir own expression, is 'stronger travel than all.' In Smith's Sound,\r\nwhere the use of raw meat seems almost inevitable from the modes of\r\nliving of the people, walrus holds the first rank. Certainly this\r\npachyderm (Cetacean?) whose finely condensed tissue and delicately\r\npermeating fat (oh! call it not blubber) assimilate it to the ox, is\r\nbeyond all others, and is the best _fuel_ a man can swallow.\" The\r\ngastronomic capabilities of the Esquimaux and of other northern races,\r\nand their fondness for fatty food, are exhibited in a sufficiently\r\nstrong light in the following statements:--\r\n\r\nCaptain Parry weighed and presented to an Esquimaux lad the following\r\narticles:--\r\n\r\n                                                         lb.  oz.\r\n\r\n  Frozen seahorse flesh                                   4    4\r\n  Wild seahorse flesh                                     4    4\r\n  Bread and bread dust                                    1   12\r\n  Rich gravy soup                                         1    4\r\n  Water                                                  10    0\r\n  Strong grog                                         1 tumbler.\r\n  Raw spirits                                    3 wine glasses.\r\n\r\nThis large quantity of food, which the lad did not consider excessive,\r\nwas consumed by him within twenty-four hours. According to Captain\r\nCochrane a reindeer suffices but for one repast for three Yakutis, and\r\nfive of them will devour at a sitting a calf weighing 200 lbs. Mr.\r\nHooper, one of the officers of the _Plover_, in his narrative of their\r\nresidence on the shores of Arctic America, states that \"one of the\r\nladies who visited them was presented, as a jest, with a small tallow\r\ncandle, called a purser's dip. It was, notwithstanding, a very pleasant\r\njoke to the damsel, who deliberately munched it up with evident relish,\r\nand finally drew the wick between her set teeth to clean off any\r\nremaining morsels of fat.\"\r\n\r\nThe partiality for certain kinds of food, and disgust at other\r\nvarieties, which particular races of men exhibit, is an instinct which\r\nthey cannot avoid obeying. Instead of exciting our disgust, as it too\r\nfrequently does, it should exalt our admiration of the infinite wisdom\r\nof the Creator, who by simply adapting man's desire for particular kinds\r\nof food to the external conditions under which he is placed, enables him\r\nto occupy and \"subdue the earth\" from the Equator to the Poles.\r\n\r\nThe food of human beings and of the lower animals who inhabit cold\r\ncountries is nearly exclusively composed of animal substances.\r\nThe flesh, fat, and oil of animals occupy less space than do the\r\ncorresponding elements of vegetables; consequently the nutriment they\r\nafford is more concentrated, and a larger quantity can be stowed away\r\nwithout inconvenience in the stomach. The heat-forming constituents of\r\nthese substances constitute not only the chief part of their bulk, but\r\nthey are also capable of evolving a greater amount of heat than any\r\nother of the respiratory elements. One pound of dry fat will develop as\r\nmuch heat as two and a half pounds of dry starch, and the fattest flesh\r\nincludes four times as much plastic materials as rice. The diet of\r\npeople all over the world, unless under circumstances which prevent the\r\ngratification of the natural appetite, establishes the intimate relation\r\nwhich subsists between cold and food. The appetite of man is at a\r\nminimum at the Equator, and at a maximum within the Arctic circle. The\r\nstatements as to the voracity of Hottentots and Bosjesmans, recorded in\r\nthe narratives of travellers, do not in the slightest degree affect the\r\ngeneral rule that more is eaten in cold climates than in hot regions.\r\nThese are mere records of gluttony, and it would not be difficult to\r\nfind parallel cases in our own country. Gluttony is an abnormal\r\nappetite, and the greater part of the food devoured under its unnatural,\r\nand generally unhealthy stimulus is not applied to the wants of the body.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of animals are heated masses of matter, and are subject to\r\nthe ordinary laws of _radiation_. Every substance radiates its heat, and\r\nreceives in return a portion of that emitted from surrounding bodies. If\r\ntwo bodies of unequal temperature be placed near each other, the warmer\r\nof the two will radiate a portion of its heat to the colder, and will\r\nreceive some of the heat of the latter in return; but as the warmer body\r\nwill emit more heat than it will receive, the result will be, that after\r\na time, the length of which will depend on the nature of the bodies,\r\nboth will acquire the same temperature. In very warm climates the bodies\r\nof animals derive from the sun, and from the heated bodies surrounding\r\nthem, more heat than they give in return; and were it not for their\r\ninternal cooling apparatus, which I have described, the heat so absorbed\r\nwould prove fatal. In every climate, on the contrary, where the\r\ntemperature is lower than 98 deg., or \"blood heat,\" the bodies of animals\r\nlose more heat by radiation than they receive by the same means. The\r\nphilosophy of the _clothing_ of men and the _sheltering_ of the lower\r\nanimals is now evident. It is not only necessary that heat should be\r\ndeveloped within the body, but also that its wasteful expenditure should\r\nbe prevented. The latter is effected by interposing between the warm\r\nbody and the cold air some substances (such as fur or wool) which do not\r\nreadily permit the transmission of heat--_non-conductors_ as they are\r\ntermed. The close down of the eider duck is destined to protect its\r\nbosom from the chilling influence of the icy waters of the North Polar\r\nSea, and the quadrupeds of the dreary Arctic Circle are sheltered by\r\nthick fur coverings from the piercing blasts of its long winter.\r\n\r\n_Fat Equivalents._--Whilst it is quite certain that neither nerves nor\r\nmuscles can be elaborated exclusively out of fat, starch, sugar, or any\r\nother non-nitrogenous substance, it is almost equally clear that fat may\r\nbe formed out of nitrogenous tissue. The quantity of fat, however, which\r\nis produced in the animal mechanism, from purely nitrogenous food\r\nappears to be relatively very small. No animal is capable of subsisting\r\nsolely on muscle-forming materials, no matter how abundantly supplied.\r\nThe food of the Carnivora contains a large proportion of fat, and the\r\nnutriment of the Herbivora is largely made up of starch and other\r\nfat-formers. Dogs, geese, and other animals fed exclusively upon albumen\r\nor white of egg rapidly decreased in weight, and after presenting all\r\nthe symptoms of starvation, died in three or four weeks.[8] The fat of\r\nthe bodies of the Carnivora is almost entirely formed--and probably with\r\nlittle if any alteration--from the fatty constituents of their food.\r\nHerbivorous animals, on the contrary, derive nearly all their fat from\r\nstarch, sugar, gum, cellulose, and other non-nitrogenous, but not fatty,\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nAlthough starch is convertible into fat, it is not to be understood that\r\na pound weight of one of these bodies is equivalent to an equal quantity\r\nof the other. During the conversion of starch into fat, the greater\r\nnumber of its constituent atoms is converted into water and carbonic\r\nacid gas. The greater number of the more important metamorphoses of\r\norganised matter, which take place in the animal organum, is the result\r\nof either oxidation or fermentation: in the conversion of starch or\r\nsugar into fat or oil, both of these processes, it is stated, take\r\nplace; a portion of the hydrogen is converted by oxidation into water,\r\nand by fermentation carbonic acid gas is formed, which removes both\r\noxygen and carbon. Perhaps in the formation of fat fermentation is alone\r\nemployed--a portion of the oxygen being removed as water, and another\r\nportion as carbonic acid. The chief difference between the ultimate\r\ncomposition of starch and fat is, that the latter contains a much larger\r\nproportion of hydrogen and carbon. The knowledge of the exact quantity\r\nof starch required for the formation of a given amount of fat is of\r\nimportance in enabling us to estimate the relative feeding value of both\r\nsubstances. Certain difficulties stand in the way of our acquiring an\r\naccurate knowledge on this point. Not only are there several distinct\r\nkinds of fat, but the precise formula, or atomic constitution of each,\r\nis as yet veiled in doubt. There are three fats which occur in man\r\nand the domesticated animals, and in vegetables. These are stearine,\r\nmargarine, and oleine. The relative proportions of these vary in each\r\nanimal: thus, in man and in the goose margarine is the most abundant\r\nfat, whilst oleine[9] exists in the pig in a greater proportion than in\r\nman, the sheep, or the ox. The composition of the animal fats does not,\r\nhowever, vary much; and this fact, together with other considerations,\r\nhave led chemists to assume that two-and-a-half parts of starch are\r\nrequired for the production of one part of the mixed fats of the\r\ndifferent animals. Grape sugar and the pectine bodies--substances which\r\nform a large proportion of the food of the Herbivora--contain more\r\noxygen and hydrogen than exist in starch, and, consequently, are not\r\ncapable of forming so large an amount of fat as an equal weight of\r\nstarch. We may assume, then, that 2.50 parts of starch, 2.75 parts of\r\nsugar, or 3 parts of the pectine bodies, are equivalent to 1 part of\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nRELATION BETWEEN THE COMPOSITION OF AN ANIMAL AND THAT OF ITS FOOD.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the results of the admirable investigations\r\nof Lawes and Gilbert prove that the non-nitrogenous constituents of the\r\ncarcasses of oxen, sheep, and pigs exceed in weight their nitrogenous\r\nelements. This fact is suggestive of many important questions. What\r\nrelation is there between the composition of an animal and that of\r\nits food? Should an animal whose body contains three times as much\r\nfat as lean flesh, be supplied with food containing three times\r\nas much fat-formers as flesh-formers? To these questions there is\r\nsome difficulty in replying. There _is_ a relationship between the\r\ncomposition of the body of an animal and that of its food; but the\r\nrelationship varies so greatly that it is impossible to determine with\r\nany degree of accuracy the quantity of fat-formers which is required to\r\nproduce a given weight of fat in animals, taken _in globo_. If, however,\r\nwe deal with a particular animal placed under certain conditions, it is\r\nthen possible to ascertain the amount of fat which a given weight of\r\nnon-plastic food will produce. For the greater part of our knowledge\r\non this point, as on so many others, in the feeding of stock, we are\r\nindebted to Lawes and Gilbert. In the case of sheep fed upon fattening\r\nfood these inquirers found that every 100 lbs. of dry[10] non-nitrogenous\r\nsubstances consumed by them produced, on an average, an increase of 10\r\nlbs. in the weight of their fat. In the case of pigs, also, supplied\r\nwith food, the proportion of non-nitrogenous matters appropriated to\r\nthe animal's increase was double that so applied in the bodies of the\r\nsheep. As the food supplied to these animals contained but a very small\r\nproportion of ready-formed fat, it was inferred that four-fifths of the\r\nfat of the increase was derived from the sugar, starch, cellulose, and\r\npectine bodies.\r\n\r\nThese tables exhibit in a condensed form the results of one of the\r\nelaborate series of experiments in relation to this point carried out\r\nby Lawes and Gilbert:--\r\n\r\n  ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF CERTAIN CONSTITUENTS STORED UP IN _INCREASE_,\r\n  FOR 100 PARTS OF EACH CONSUMED IN FOOD BY FATTENING SHEEP.\r\n\r\n

compared with the sheep, must not be attributed solely to\r\nits greater tendency to fatten, but partly to the far more digestible\r\nnature of the food supplied to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nRELATION BETWEEN THE QUANTITY OF FOOD CONSUMED BY AN ANIMAL, AND THE\r\nINCREASE IN ITS WEIGHT, OR OF THE AMOUNT OF ITS WORK.\r\n\r\nThe manifestations of that wondrous and mysterious principle, _life_,\r\nare completely dependent upon the decomposition of organised matter. Not\r\nan effort of the mind, not a motion of the body, can be accomplished\r\nwithout involving the destruction of a portion of the tissues. In a\r\ngeneral sense we may regard the fat of the animal to be its store of\r\nfuel, and its lean flesh to be the source of its motive power. As the\r\nevolution of heat within the body is proportionate to the quantity of\r\nfat consumed, so also is the amount of force developed in the animal\r\nmechanism in a direct ratio to the proportion of flesh decomposed.\r\nThe quantity of fat burned in the body is estimated by the amount of\r\ncarbonic acid gas expired from the lungs and perspired through the skin;\r\nthe proportion of flesh disorganised is ascertained by the quantity of\r\nurea eliminated in the liquid egesta. The amount of urea excreted daily\r\nby a man is influenced by the activity of his mind, as well as by that\r\nof his body. A man engaged in physical labor wears out more of his body\r\nthan one who does no work; and a man occupied in a pursuit involving\r\nintense mental application, consumes a greater proportion of his tissue\r\nthan the man who works only with his body.[13] In each of these cases,\r\nthere is a different amount of tissue disorganised, and consequently a\r\ndemand for different amounts of food, with which to repair the waste.\r\nBut all the food consumed by a man is not devoted to the reparation of\r\nthe tissue worn out in the operations of thinking and working. A human\r\nbeing whose mind is a perfect blank, and who performs no bodily work,\r\nexcretes a large quantity of urea, the representative of an equivalent\r\namount of worn-out flesh. In fact the greater part of the food consumed\r\nby a man serves merely to sustain the functions of the body--the\r\ncirculation of the blood--the action of the heart--the movements of the\r\nmuscles concerned in respiration--in a word, the various motions of the\r\nbody which are independent of the will. According to Professor Haughton,\r\nabout three-fourths of the food of a working man of 150 lbs. weight, are\r\nused in merely keeping him _alive_, the remaining fourth is expended in\r\nthe production of mechanical force, constituting his daily toil.\r\n\r\nIn the nutrition of the lower animals, as in that of man, the amount of\r\nfood made use of by a particular individual depends upon its age, its\r\nweight, the amount of work it performs, and probably its temper. As\r\nthree-fourths of the weight of the food of a laboring man are expended\r\nin merely keeping him alive, it is obvious that the withholding of the\r\nremaining fourth would render him incapable of working. An amount of\r\nfood which adequately maintains the vital and mechanical powers of three\r\nmen, serves merely to keep four alive. It is the same with the horse,\r\nthe ox, and every other animal useful to man: each makes use of a\r\ncertain amount of food, _for its own purposes_; all that is consumed\r\nbeyond that is applied for the benefit of its owner. Let us take the\r\ncase of two of our most useful quadrupeds--the horse and the ox. The\r\nhorse is used as an immediate source of motive power. For this purpose\r\nfood is supplied to it, the greater portion of which is consumed in\r\nkeeping the animal alive, and the rest for the development of its motive\r\npower. Abundance of food is as necessary to the natural mechanism,\r\nthe horse, as fuel is to the artificial mechanism, the steam-engine.\r\nIn each case the amount of force developed is, within certain limits,\r\nproportionate to the quantity of vegetable or altered vegetable matter\r\nconsumed. The greater portion of the ox's food is also consumed in\r\nkeeping its body alive, and the rest, instead of being expended in the\r\ndevelopment of motive power, accumulates as surplus stores of flesh,\r\nwhich in due time are applied to the purpose of repairing the organisms\r\nof men. It is evident then, that the greater sufferer from the deficient\r\nsupply of food to animals is their owner. That they cannot be _taught_\r\nto _fast_ is a fact which does not appear very patent to some minds.\r\nThe man who sought by gradually reducing the daily quantum of his\r\nhorse's provender to accustom it to work without eating, was justly\r\npunished for his ignorant cruelty. The day before the horse's allowance\r\nwas to be reduced to pure water, and when its owner's hope appeared\r\ncertain of speedy realisation, the animal died. There are men who act\r\nalmost as foolishly as the parsimonious horse owner in this fable did;\r\nand who are as properly punished as he was. Such men are to be found in\r\nthe farmers who overstock their sheep pastures, and whose \"lean kine\"\r\nare the _laughing stock_ of their more intelligent neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe weight of a working full-grown horse does not vary from day\r\nto day, as the weight of its egesta is equal to that of its food.\r\nThe desideratum in the case of the working animal is that its food\r\nshould be as thoroughly decomposed as possible, and the force pent\r\nup in it liberated within the animal's body: as an ox, on the contrary,\r\nincreases in weight from day to day, it is desirable that as little as\r\npossible of its food should be disorganised. The wasteful expenditure\r\nof the animal's fat may be obviated by shelter, and the application of\r\nartificial heat: the retardation of the destruction of its flesh is even\r\nmore under our control; for, as active muscular exertion involves the\r\ndecomposition of tissue, we have merely to diminish the activity of\r\nthe motions which cause this waste. This, in practice, is effected by\r\nstall-feeding. Confined within the narrow boundaries of the stall, the\r\nmuscular action of the animal is reduced to a minimum, or limited to\r\nthose uncontrollable actions which are conditions in the maintenance\r\nof animal life.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of the food of oxen, sheep, and pigs, which is\r\nconsumed in maintaining their vital functions, has not been accurately\r\nascertained; probably, as in the case of man, it is strictly\r\nproportionate to the animal's weight. We can determine the amount\r\nof plastic food consumed by an animal during a given period: we can\r\nascertain the increase (if any) in the weight of its body; and finally,\r\nwe can weigh and analyse its egesta. With these data it is comparatively\r\neasy to ascertain the quantity of food which produced the increase in\r\nthe animal's weight; but they do not enable us to determine the amount\r\nexpended in keeping it alive, because the egesta might be largely made\r\nup of unappropriated food--organised matter which had done no work in\r\nthe animal body. When we come to know the precise quantity of nitrogen,\r\nin a purely, or nearly pure, mineral form[14] excreted by an animal,\r\nthen we shall be in a position to estimate the proportion of its food\r\nexpended in sustaining the essential vital processes which continuously\r\ngo on in its body. But although we are in ignorance as to the precise\r\nquantity of flesh-formers expended in keeping the animal alive, we know\r\npretty accurately the amount which is consumed in producing a given\r\nweight of its flesh, or rather in causing a certain increase in its\r\nweight. This knowledge is the result of numerous investigations, of\r\nwhich by far the most valuable are those of Lawes and Gilbert. These\r\nexperimenters found that fattening pigs stored up about 7-1/2 per\r\ncent. of the plastic materials of their food, whilst sheep accumulated\r\nsomewhat less than 5 per cent. That is, 92-1/2 out of every 100 lbs.\r\nweight of the nitrogenous food of the pig, and 95 out of every 100 lbs.\r\nof that of the sheep, are eliminated in the excretions of those animals.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the results of Lawes and Gilbert's experiments, that\r\npigs store up in their _increase_ about 20 per cent., sheep 12 per\r\ncent., and oxen 8 per cent. of their (dry) food. The relative increase\r\nof the fatty, nitrogenous, and mineral constituents whilst fattening,\r\nare shown in this table.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-------------------------------------------------\r\n                       |Estimated per cent. in Increase whilst Fattening.\r\n  CASES.               +--------+-----------+-----------+----------------\r\n                       |Mineral |Nitrogenous|           |\r\n                       | matter |matter     | Fat (dry).| Total dry\r\n                       |(ash).  |(dry).     |           | substance.\r\n  ---------------------+--------+-----------+-----------+----------------\r\n  Average of  98 oxen  | 1.47   |  7.69     |  66.2     |  75.4\r\n  Average of 348 sheep | 1.80   |  7.13     |  70.4     |  79.53\r\n  Average of  80 pigs  | 0.44   |  6.44     |  71.5     |  78.40\r\n  ---------------------+--------+-----------+-----------+----------------\r\n\r\nThe quantity of food consumed daily by an animal is, as might be expected,\r\nproportionate to the weight of its body. The pig consumes, for every 100\r\nlbs. of its weight, from 26 to 30 lbs. of food, the sheep 15 lbs., and\r\nthe ox 12 to 13 lbs. These figures and the statements which I have made\r\nrelative to the proportions of fat and plastic elements in the animals'\r\nbodies, apply to them in their fattening state, and when the food is\r\nof a highly nutritious character. The calf and the young pig will\r\nmake use--to cause their increase--of a larger portion of nitrogenous\r\nmatters. The sheep, however, being early brought to maturity, will, even\r\nwhen very young, store up the plastic and non-plastic constituents of\r\nits food, in nearly the same relative proportions that I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs it is the food taken into the body that produces heat and motion, it\r\nmight at first sight appear an easy matter to determine the amount of\r\nheat or of motion which a given weight of a particular kind of food is\r\ncapable of producing within the animal mechanism. But this performance\r\nis not so easy a task as it appears to be. In the first place, all of\r\nthe food may not be perfectly oxidised, though thoroughly disorganised\r\nwithin the body; secondly, as animals rarely subsist on one kind of\r\nfood, it is difficult, when they are supplied with mixed aliments, to\r\ndetermine which of them is the most perfectly decomposed. But though the\r\ndifficulties which I have mentioned, and many others, render the task\r\nof determining the nutritive values of food substances difficult, the\r\nproblem is by no means insoluble, and, in fact, is in a fair way of\r\nbeing solved. Professor Frankland, in a paper published in the number\r\nof the _Philosophical Magazine_ for September, 1866, determines the\r\nrelative alimental value of foods by ascertaining the quantity of heat\r\nevolved by each when burned in oxygen gas. From the results of these\r\nresearches he has constructed a table, showing the amount of food\r\nnecessary to keep a man alive for twenty-four hours. The following\r\nfigures, which I select from this table, are of interest to the\r\nstock-feeder:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Weight necessary to sustain a\r\n                      man's life for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n  Kinds of Food.                 Ounces.\r\n\r\n  Potatoes                       13.4\r\n  Apples                         20.7\r\n  Oatmeal                         3.4\r\n  Flour                           3.5\r\n  Pea Meal                        3.5\r\n  Bread                           6.4\r\n  Milk                           21.2\r\n  Carrots                        25.6\r\n  Cabbage                        31.8\r\n  Butter                          1.8\r\n  Lump Sugar                      3.9\r\n\r\nThese figures show the relative calefacient, or heat-producing powers of\r\nthe different foods named _outside_ the body; but there is some doubt as\r\nto their having the same relative values when burned _within_ the body.\r\nThe woody fibre of the carrots and cabbages is very combustible in the\r\ncoal furnace, but it is very doubtful if more than 20 or 30 per cent. of\r\nthis substance is ever burned in the _animal furnace_. However, such\r\ninquiries as those carried out by Frankland possess great value; and\r\ntables constructed upon their results cannot fail to be useful in the\r\ndrawing up of dietary scales, whether for man or for the inferior\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nI may here remark, that in my opinion the nutritive value of food admits\r\nof being very accurately determined by the adoption of the following\r\nmethod:--\r\n\r\n1. The animal experimented upon to be supplied daily with a weighed\r\nquantity of food, the composition and calefacient value of which had\r\nbeen accurately determined. 2. The gases, vapors, and liquid and solid\r\negesta thrown off from its body to be collected, analysed, and the\r\ncalefacient[15] value of the combustible portion of them to be determined.\r\n3. The increase (if any) of the weight of the animal to be ascertained.\r\n4. The difference between the amount of heat evolvable by the foods\r\nbefore being consumed, and that actually obtained by the combustion\r\nof the egesta into which they were ultimately converted, would be the\r\namount actually set free and rendered available within the body. The\r\ncalculations would be somewhat affected by an increase in the weight\r\nof the animal's body; but it would not be difficult to keep the weight\r\nstationary, or nearly so, and there are other ways of getting over\r\nsuch a difficulty. An experiment such as this would be a costly one,\r\nand could not be properly conducted unless by the aid of an apparatus\r\nsimilar to that employed by Pettenkofer in his experiments on\r\nrespiration. This apparatus, which was made at the expense of the King\r\nof Bavaria, cost nearly L600.\r\n\r\n_Value of Manure._--It is a complication in the question of the\r\neconomic feeding of the farm animals that the value of their manure\r\nmust be taken into account. Of the three classes of food constituents,\r\ntwo--the mineral and nitrogenous--are recoverable in the animal's body\r\nand manure; the non-nitrogenous is partly recoverable in the fat.\r\nI shall take the case of a sheep, which will consume weekly per 100\r\nlbs. of its weight, 12 lbs. of fat-formers, and 3 lbs. of flesh-formers.\r\nTwelve per cent. of the fat-formers will be retained in the _increase_,\r\nbut the rest will be expended in keeping the animal warm, and the\r\nproducts of its combustion--carbonic acid and water--will be useless to\r\nthe farmer. It is, therefore, desirable to diminish as much as possible\r\nthe combustion of fatty matter in the animal's body; and this is\r\neffected, as I have already explained, by keeping it in a warm place.\r\nOf the flesh-forming substance only five per cent. is retained in the\r\nincrease, the rest is partly consumed in carrying on the movements of\r\nthe animal--partly expelled from its body unaltered, or but slightly\r\naltered, in composition. The solid excrement of the animal contains\r\nall the undigested food; but of this only the mineral and nitrogenous\r\nconstituents are valuable as manure. The nitrogen of the plastic\r\nmaterials which are expended in maintaining the functions of the body is\r\neliminated from the lungs, through the skin, and by the kidneys--perhaps\r\nalso, but certainly only to a small extent, by the rectum.\r\n\r\nThe food consumed by an animal is disposed of in the following way:--A\r\nportion passes unchanged, or but slightly altered, through the body;\r\nanother part is assimilated and subsequently disorganised and ejected;\r\nthe rest is converted into the carcass of the animal at the time of its\r\ndeath. The undigested food and aliment which had undergone conversion\r\ninto flesh and other tissues, and subsequent disorganisation, constitute\r\nthe excrements, or manure, of the animal. The richer in nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid the food is, the more valuable will be the manure; so\r\nthat the money value of a feeding stuff is not determinable merely by\r\nthe amount of flesh which it makes, but also, and to a great extent,\r\nby the value of the manure into which it is ultimately converted.\r\n\r\nCorn and oil-cakes are powerful fertilisers of the soil; but the three\r\nprinciples which constitute their manurial value--namely, nitrogen\r\n(ammonia), phosphoric acid, and potash--are purchasable at far lower\r\nprices in guano and other manures. Nevertheless, many farmers believe\r\nthat the most economical way to produce good manure is to feed their\r\nstock with concentrated aliment, in order to greatly increase the value\r\nof their excreta. They consider that a pound's worth of oil-cake, or of\r\ncorn, will produce at least a pound's worth of meat, and that the manure\r\nwill be had for nothing, or, rather, will be the profit of the business.\r\nThe richer food is in nitrogen and phosphoric acid, the more valuable\r\nwill be the manure it yields. It follows, therefore, that if two kinds\r\nof feeding stuff produce equal amounts of meat, that the preference\r\nshould be given to that which contains the more nitrogen and phosphoric\r\nacid. Mr. Lawes, who has thrown light upon this point, as well as upon\r\nso many others, has made careful estimates of the value of the manure\r\nproduced from different foods.  They are given in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  TABLE\r\n\r\n  Showing the estimated value of the manure obtained on the\r\n  consumption of one ton of different articles of food; each\r\n  supposed to be of good quality of its kind.\r\n\r\n                                               Estimated Money Value\r\n      Description of Food.                     of the Manure from\r\n                                               One Ton of each Food.\r\n\r\n   1.

Reiset\r\nstates that 100 parts of the nitrogen of food given to sheep upon\r\nwhich he experimented, were disposed of as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Recovered in the excreta                                 58.3\r\n  Recovered in the meat, tallow, and skin                  13.7\r\n  Lost in respiration                                      28.0\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nHaughton's experiments, performed upon men, gave results which proved\r\nthat no portion of the nitrogen of their food was lost by perspiration\r\nor by respiration. Barral, on the contrary, asserts that nitrogen\r\nis given off from the bodies of both man and the inferior animals.\r\nBoussingault states that horses, sheep, and pigs exhale nitrogen.\r\nA cow, giving milk, on which he had experimented, lost 15 per cent.\r\nof the nitrogen of its food by perspiration. The amount of nitrogen\r\nwhich Reiset states that sheep exhale is exceedingly great, and it\r\nis difficult to reconcile his results with those obtained by Voit,\r\nBischoff, Regnault, Pettenkofer, and Haughton. Of course, men and sheep\r\nare widely different animals; but still it is unlikely that all the\r\nnitrogen of the food of man should be recoverable in his egesta, whilst\r\nnearly a third of the nitrogen of the food of the sheep should be\r\ndissipated as gas. I think further experiments are necessary before this\r\npoint can be regarded as settled; and it is probable that it will yet be\r\nfound that all, or nearly all, of the nitrogen of the food of animals is\r\nrecoverable in their egesta.\r\n\r\nRegarding, then, an animal as a mechanism by which meat is to be\r\n\"manufactured,\" five economic points in relation to it demand the\r\nfeeder's attention: these are--the first cost of the mechanism, the\r\nexpense of maintaining the mechanism in working order, the price of\r\nthe raw materials intended for conversion into meat, the value of the\r\nmeat, and the value of the manure. In proportion to the attention given\r\nto these points, will be the feeder's profits; but they are, to some\r\nextent, affected by the climatic, geographic, and other conditions under\r\nwhich the farm is placed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: If the elements were only capable of combining with each\r\nother in simple ratios, the number of their combinations would be as\r\nlimited as that of the letters of the alphabet; but as one, two, or\r\nmore atoms of oxygen can combine with one, two, or more atoms of\r\nother elements, we can assign no limits to the number of _possible_\r\ncombinations.

I have been assured by an\r\nextensive manufacturer, that on promoting his workmen to situations of\r\n_greater_ responsibility but _less_ physically laborious than those\r\npreviously filled by them, he found that they required more food and\r\nthat, too, of a better quality.

The improvement\r\nof animals designed as food for man is effected by keeping them on a\r\nliberal dietary, by selecting only the best individuals for sires and\r\ndams, and by combining the excellencies of two or more varieties of a\r\nspecies in one breed. A species consists of a number of animals which\r\nexhibit so many points of resemblance, that they are regarded by the\r\ngreat majority of naturalists to be the descendants of a single pair.\r\nIf we except the believers in the hypotheses relative to the origin\r\nof existing varieties of animals and plants, propounded by Lamarck,\r\nDarwin, and other naturalists of the \"advanced school,\" there is a\r\ngeneral belief in the immutability of species. The individuals of an\r\nexisting species, say dogs, can never acquire the peculiar features\r\nof another species; nor can their descendants, if we except hybrids,\r\never become animals in which the characteristics of the dog tribe are\r\nirrecognisable. By various influences, such as, for example, differences\r\nin food and climate, and domestication, a species may be split into\r\n_varieties_, or _breeds_, all of which, however, retain the more\r\nimportant characteristics of the primordial type. There appears to be\r\nno limit to the varieties of dogs, yet one can perceive by a glance that\r\nthere is no specific difference between the huge Mont St. Bernard dog\r\nand the diminutive poodle, or between the sparse greyhound and the burly\r\nmastiff. All the varieties of our domestic fowl have been traced to\r\na common origin--the wild Indian fowl (_Gallus bankiva_). Even Darwin\r\nadmits that all the existing kinds of horses are, in all probability,\r\nthe descendants of an original stock; and it is generally agreed that\r\nthe scores of varieties of pigeons own a common ancestor in the rock\r\npigeon (_Columba livia_).\r\n\r\nAs certain individuals are grouped by naturalists into species, so\r\nparticular species, which in habits and general appearance resemble each\r\nother, are arranged under the head of genus. The horse, the ass, and the\r\nzebra are formed on nearly the same anatomical plan; they are therefore\r\nclassed together, and designated the genus _Equus_, a term derived from\r\nthe Latin word _equus_, a horse--that animal being regarded as the type,\r\nor perfect member of the group. Thus the horse, in the nomenclature of\r\nthe naturalist, is termed _Equus caballus_; the ass, _Equus asinus_; and\r\nthe zebra, _Equus zebra_. By a further extension of this principle of\r\nclassification, very closely allied genera are united under the term\r\nof _family_.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of the same species breed, as might be\r\nanticipated, freely together; but it frequently happens that two\r\nindividuals of different species pair, and produce an animal which\r\ninherits some of the properties of each of its progenitors. These\r\nhalf-breeds are termed _hybrids_, or _mules_, and we have familiar\r\nexamples of them in the common mule and the jennet. As a general rule,\r\nanimals exhibit a disinclination to breed with other than members of\r\ntheir own species; and although the interference of man may overcome\r\nthis natural repugnance, he can only effect the fruitful congress of\r\nindividuals belonging to closely allied species, being members of the\r\nsame genus. Hybrids in the genus _Equus_ are very common. A cross has\r\nbeen produced between the he-goat and the ewe; the camel and the\r\ndromedary have bred together; and Buffon succeeded in producing a hybrid\r\nin which three animals were represented--namely, the bison, the zebu,\r\nand the ox. On the other hand, attempts to effect a cross between\r\nanimals belonging to different families have generally failed; nor is\r\nit at all probable that a cross will ever be produced between the pig\r\nand the sheep, between the horse and the cow, or, most unlikely of all,\r\nbetween the dog and the cat.\r\n\r\nIt is the general belief that hybrids are sterile, or, at least, that\r\nthey are incapable of propagation _inter se_. This may be true with\r\nrespect to the hybrids of species not very closely allied; but that\r\nthere are exceptions to the rule is quite clear from Roux's experiments\r\nwith hares and rabbits. This gentleman, who is, or was, the president\r\nof a French agricultural society, but who makes no profession of\r\nscientific knowledge, has succeeded, after several failures, in producing\r\na fruitful cross between the rabbit and the hare. This hybrid has\r\nreceived the name of leporide (from the Latin _leporinus_, pertaining to\r\na hare), and it is different from former crosses, in being five parts\r\nhare, and three parts rabbit. M. Roux has bred this hybrid during the\r\nlast eighteen years, and has not observed the slightest appearance\r\nof decay of race manifest itself up to the present, so that, for all\r\npractical purposes, the leporide may be regarded as an addition to the\r\ndistinct species of animals. The leporide fattens rapidly, and with but\r\nlittle expenditure of food. Sold at the age of four months, it realises,\r\nin France, a price four times greater than that commanded by a rabbit of\r\nthe same age; and at a year old it weighs on an average ten pounds, and\r\nsometimes as much as sixteen pounds. It breeds at four months, continues\r\nthirty days in gestation, and yearly produces five or six litters of\r\nfrom five to eight young. To produce this hybrid is by no means\r\ndifficult. A leveret, just old enough to dispense with the maternal\r\nnutriment, should be placed with a few doe rabbits of his own age,\r\napart from other animals. He will soon become familiar with the does,\r\nand when they attain the age of puberty, all the rabbits save one or two\r\nshould be removed. Speedily those left with the hare will become with\r\nyoung, upon which they should be removed, and replaced by others. After\r\nthis the hare should be kept in a hutch by himself, and a doe left with\r\nhim at night only. As the hare is naturally a very shy animal, it will\r\nonly breed when perfect quietness prevails. The half-bred produced in\r\nthe first instance should now be put to the hare, and a cross, three\r\nparts hare, and one part rabbit, obtained. The permanent breed should\r\nthen be obtained by crossing the quadroon doe leporide, if I may use the\r\nterm, with the half-bred buck.\r\n\r\nI have directed attention to the production of the leporide because\r\nI believe that the problems in relation to it, which have been solved\r\nby M. Roux, have an important bearing upon the breeding of animals\r\nof greater importance than hares and rabbits. Here we find a race of\r\nanimals produced by the fusion of two species, which naturally exist in\r\na state of mutual enmity, and which differ in many important respects.\r\nThe hare and the rabbit are respectively of but little value as food, at\r\nleast they are of no importance to the feeder; yet a cross between them\r\nturns out to be an excellent meat-producing animal, which may be reared\r\nwith considerable profit to the feeder. It is thus clearly shown that\r\ntwo kinds of animals, neither of which is of great utility, may give\r\nrise to an excellent cross, if their blood, so to speak, be blended in\r\nproper proportions. A half-bred animal may be less valuable than its\r\nparents, but a quadroon may greatly excel its progenitors. The goat\r\nand sheep are so closely related that they are classed by naturalists\r\nunder one head--_Capridae_. Some kinds of sheep have hair like goats, and\r\ncertain varieties of goats have fleeces that closely resemble those on\r\nthe sheep. There are sheep with horns, and goats without those striking\r\nappendages. The Cape of Good Hope goat might easily be mistaken for a\r\nsheep. It would seem, judging by the results of Roux's experiments, that\r\nthere is no great difficulty in the way of obtaining a cross between the\r\nsheep and the goat. I do not mean an ordinary half-breed, but a prolific\r\nhybrid similar to the leporide. Of course, it is impossible, _a priori_,\r\nto say whether or not such a hybrid race, supposing it produceable,\r\nwould be valuable; but as goats can find a subsistence on mountains\r\nwhere sheep would starve, it is possible that an animal, essentially a\r\nsheep, but with a streak of goat blood in it, could be profitably kept\r\non very poor uplands. Whether a race of what we might term _caprides_ be\r\nformed or not we have derived most suggestive information from M. Roux's\r\nexperiments, which I hope may be turned to account in what is by far the\r\nmost important field of enquiry, the judicious crossing of varieties of\r\nthe same species.\r\n\r\nIt is a _quaestio vexata_ whether or not the parents generally exercise\r\ndifferent influences upon the shape and size of their offspring. Mr.\r\nSpooner supports the supposition--a very popular one--that the sire\r\ngives shape to the external organs, whilst the dam affects the internal\r\norganisation. I have considerable doubt as to the probability of this\r\ntheory. The children who spring from the union of a white man with a\r\nnegress possess physical and intellectual qualities which are nearly if\r\nnot quite the _mean_ of their parents; but the offspring of parents,\r\nboth of the same race--be it Caucasian, Mongolian, or Indian--frequently\r\nconform, intellectually and corporeally, to either of their progenitors.\r\nThus, of the children of a tall, thin, dark man, and a short, fat,\r\nfair woman, some will be like their father, and the others will\r\nresemble their mother, or, perhaps, all may \"take after\" either parent.\r\nSometimes a child appears to be in every respect unlike its parents,\r\nand occasionally the likeness of an ancestor appears in a descendant, in\r\nwhom no resemblance to his immediate progenitors can be detected. It is\r\nhighly probable that both parents exercise, under most circumstances, a\r\njoint influence upon the qualities of their offspring, but that one of\r\nthem may produce so much greater an effect that the influence of the\r\nother is not recognisable, except perhaps to a very close observer. But\r\nI doubt very much that any particular organ of the offspring is, as a\r\nrule, more liable to the influence of the sire than of the dam, or _vice\r\nversa_; and the breeder who believes that the sire alone is concerned in\r\nmoulding the external form of the offspring, and who consequently pays\r\nno attention to this point in the dam, will often find himself out in\r\nhis reckonings. In order to be certain of a satisfactory result, the dam\r\nshould in every respect be equal to the sire. In practice, however, this\r\nis not always the case, for as sires are so few as compared with the\r\nnumber of dams, the greatest efforts have been directed towards the\r\nimprovement of the former.\r\n\r\nThere is, or ought to be, a familiar maxim with breeders, that \"like\r\nbegets like, or the likeness of an ancestor.\" This is a \"wise saw,\" of\r\nwhich there are many \"modern instances:\" the excellencies or defects of\r\nsire or dam are certain to be transmitted through several generations,\r\nthough they may not appear in all. As a general rule, good animals will\r\nproduce a good, and defective animals a defective, offspring, but it\r\nsometimes happens that a bull or cow, of the best blood, is decidedly\r\ninferior, whilst really good animals are occasionally the produce of\r\nparents of \"low degree.\" If the defects or excellencies of animals were\r\nineradicable there would be no need for the science of breeding; but by\r\nthe continual selection of only the most superior animals for breeding\r\npurposes the defects of a species gradually disappear, and the good\r\nqualities are alone transmitted. As, however, animals that are used as\r\nfood for man are to some extent in an abnormal condition, the points\r\nwhich may be excellencies in that state, would not have been such in the\r\noriginal condition of the animal. We find, therefore, that the improved\r\nbreeds of oxen and sheep exhibit some tendency to revert to their\r\noriginal condition, and it is only by close attention to the diet,\r\nbreeding, and general management of these animals that this tendency can\r\nbe successfully resisted. Sometimes, however, an animal of even the best\r\nbreed will \"return to nature,\" or will acquire some undesirable quality;\r\nsuch an animal should be rejected for breeding purposes, for its defects\r\nwould in all probability be transmitted to its descendants, near or\r\nremote. A case, which admirably illustrates this point, is recorded in\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1813, and it is sufficiently\r\ninteresting to be mentioned here:--\r\n\r\n    Seth Wright, who possessed a small farm on the Charles River,\r\n    about sixteen miles from Boston, had a small flock, consisting\r\n    of fifteen ewes and one ram. One of these ewes, in 1791, produced\r\n    a singular-shaped male lamb. Wright was advised to kill his former\r\n    ram and keep this new one in place of it; the consequence was, the\r\n    formation of a new breed of sheep, which gradually spread over a\r\n    considerable part of New England, but the introduction of the Merino\r\n    has nearly destroyed them again. This new variety was called the\r\n    Otter, or \"Ankon\" breed. They are remarkable for the shortness of\r\n    their legs, and the crookedness of their forelegs, like an elbow.\r\n    They are much more feeble and much smaller than the common sheep,\r\n    and less able to break over low fences; and this was the reason\r\n    of their being continued and propagated.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we have an instance of an animal propagating a defect through\r\na great number of descendants, though it had not acquired it from\r\nits own ancestors. It is, however, probable that occasionally a male\r\ndescendant of this short-legged ram possessed considerably longer organs\r\nof locomotion than the founder of his breed; and, consequently, if\r\nselected for breeding purposes might become the founder of a long-legged\r\nvariety, in which, however, a couple of pairs of short-legs would\r\noccasionally present themselves. I have a notion that the higher animals\r\nare in the scale of being, the greater is their tendency to transmit\r\ntheir acquired good or bad habits to their posterity. Dogs are, perhaps,\r\nthe most intelligent of the inferior animals, and it is well known\r\nthat they transmit to their offspring their acquired as well as their\r\nnatural habits. I doubt very much that those most stupid of creatures,\r\nguinea-pigs, possess this property in any sensible degree; or, indeed,\r\nthat like the canine tribe, they can be readily made to acquire\r\nartificial peculiarities: but there once flourished a \"learned pig,\"\r\nand it would be worth inquiring whether or not its descendants, like the\r\ndescendants of the trained setter, and pointer, were at all benefited by\r\nthe education of their ancestor. I shall conclude this part of my subject\r\nin the words of Professor Tanner: \"In all cases where the breed has been\r\ncarefully preserved pure, great benefit will result from doing so. The\r\ncharacter of a breed becomes more and more concentrated and confirmed in\r\na pedigree animal, and this character is rendered more fully hereditary\r\nin proportion to the number of generations through which it has been\r\ntransmitted. By the aid of pedigree, purity of blood may be insured, and\r\na systematic plan adopted by which we can perpetuate distinct families,\r\nand thereby obtain a change of blood without its being a cross. It is\r\nevident that any one adopting a systematic arrangement will be able to\r\ndo this more effectually than another without this aid. This is the more\r\nimportant when the number of families is small, as is the case with\r\nDevons and Herefords, especially the former. The individual animals from\r\nwhich the Devons are descended are very limited in number, and in a few\r\nhands; but, with some honourable exceptions, little attention is given\r\nto this point. The importance is rendered evident by the decreasing size\r\nof the breed, the number of barren heifers, and the increased delicacy\r\nof constitution shown in the stock of many breeders of that district who\r\nare not particular in this respect. The contrast between such herds,\r\nand those in which more care and judgment are exercised, renders the\r\nadvantages of attention to pedigree very evident; for here the strength\r\nof constitution is retained, together with many of the advantages of\r\nthis valuable breed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nTHE BREEDS OF STOCK.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the animal determines, as I have already stated, the\r\nproportion of its food carried off in its increase; but this point is\r\nalso greatly influenced by its _variety_, or _breed_. Certain breeds\r\nwhich have for a long period been kept on bulky food, and obliged\r\nto roam in quest of it, appear to have acquired a normal tendency to\r\n_leanness_. No doubt, if they were supplied with highly nutritious\r\nfood for many successive generations, these breeds might eventually\r\nexhibit as great a tendency to fatten as they now do to remain in a\r\nlean condition. As it is, the horned cattle of Kerry, Wales, and some\r\nother regions, rarely become fat, no matter how abundantly they may be\r\nsupplied with fattening food. On the other hand, the Herefords, but more\r\nespecially the Shorthorns, exhibit a natural disposition to obesity, and\r\nsuch animals alone should be stall-fed. It is noteworthy that animals\r\nwhich are naturally disposed to yield abundance of milk are often the\r\nbest adapted for fattening; but it would appear that the continuous\r\nuse of highly fattening food, and the observance of the various other\r\nconditions in the _forcing_ system, diminish the activity of the lacteal\r\nsecretion, and increase the tendency to fatness in the races of the\r\nbovine tribe. The Shorthorns were at one time famous for their milking\r\ncapabilities, but latterly their galactophoric reputation has greatly\r\ndeclined. Still I am disposed to believe, that if some of those animals\r\nwere placed under conditions favorable to the improvement of dairy\r\nstock, herds of Shorthorn milch cows could be obtained which would vie\r\nin their own line with the famous fat-disposed oxen of the same breed.\r\n\r\nIn sheep the tendency to early maturity and to fatten is greatly\r\ninfluenced by the breed. The Leicester, even when kept on inferior\r\npasture, fattens so rapidly that in eighteen months it is fit for the\r\nbutcher; whilst the Merino, though supplied with excellent herbage, must\r\nbe preserved for nearly four years before it is ready for the shambles.\r\nThe crossing of good herds has resulted in the development of numerous\r\nvarieties, all remarkable for their aptitude to fatten and to arrive\r\nearly at maturity. The Leicester--itself supposed to be a cross--has\r\ngreatly improved the Lincoln, and the Hampshire and Southdown have\r\nproduced an excellent cross. Of course, each breed and cross has its\r\nadmirers; indeed, the differences of opinion which prevail in relation\r\nto the relative merits of the Lincoln and the Leicester--the Southdown\r\nand the Shropshiredown--the Dorset and the Somerset--occasionally\r\nculminate into newspaper controversies of an exceedingly ascerb\r\ncharacter. There is no doubt but that particular breeds of sheep\r\nthrive in localities and under conditions which are inimical to other\r\nvarieties; but still it is equally evident that, _caeteris paribus_, one\r\nkind of sheep will store up in its increase a larger proportion of its\r\nfood than another kind, and will arrive earlier at maturity. It is the\r\nknowledge of this fact which has led to the great estimation in which\r\nare held some half-dozen out of the numerous breeds and cross-breeds\r\nof that animal. In 1861 an interesting experiment was made by the\r\nParlington Farmers' Club with the object of testing the relative merits\r\nof several varieties of sheep. The results are shown in the tables:--\r\n\r\n  TABLE I.\r\n\r\n  ----------------+------------------------------------+-----------------------\r\n                  | Live Weight of Six Wethers

show the aptitude to fatten,\r\nwithout much loss in offal, of the Leicester;[17] and they commend to the\r\nlover of good mutton the Shropshire and South-Downs.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth volume of the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society\r\nof England, Mr. Lawes gives some valuable information relative to the\r\ncomparative fattening qualities of different breeds of sheep. The\r\nfollowing table, on this author's authority, shows the average food\r\nconsumed in producing 100 lbs. increase in live weight:--\r\n\r\n  Breed.                    Oil Cake.     Clover.

Major Rudd states\r\nthat the dam of Hubback, the famous founder of pure improved Shorthorns,\r\nowed her propensity to fatten to an admixture of Kyloe blood, and also\r\nthat the sire of Hubback had a stain of Alderney, or Normandy blood.\r\nAlthough the Rudd account of the ancestry of Hubback is not accepted by\r\nall the historians of this splendid breed of cattle, there is no doubt\r\nbut that the breed owes its origin as much to judicious crossing as to\r\ncareful selection of sires and dams. It must not, however, be imagined\r\nthat there are no good pure races of stock. There is a perfectly pure,\r\nbut now scarce, tribe of Kerry oxen, admirably adapted to poor uplands.\r\nThe excellent Southdown sheep, though in every respect immensely\r\nsuperior to their ancestors in the last century, have not attained to\r\ntheir present superior state by crossing. The high value placed by\r\nbreeders upon good sires and dams in the approved breeds of stock is\r\nshown by the large sums which they frequently realise at sales, or when\r\nthe former are let out for service. Bakewell received in one season for\r\nthe use of a ram 400 guineas each from two breeders, and they did not\r\nretain the animal during the whole season. Several hundred guineas have\r\nlately been more than once paid for a celebrated tup. Colonel Towneley's\r\nShorthorn bull, Master Butterfly, was, not long since, disposed of to an\r\nAustralian buyer for L1,260. At the sale of Mr. Bates's stock in 1850,\r\na stock of Shorthorns, including calves, brought on the average L116 5s.\r\nper head. At the Earl Ducie's sale in 1852, a three year old\r\ncow--Duchess--realised 700 guineas.\r\n\r\nThe color of an animal is, to some extent, a criterion of the purity\r\nof its breed. Roan is a favourite hue with the breeders of Shorthorns.\r\nThere have been celebrated sires and dams of that breed perfectly white;\r\nbut that color, or rather absence of color, is now somewhat unpopular,\r\npartly from the idea that it is a sign of weakness of constitution--a\r\nnotion for which there appears to me to be no foundation in fact.\r\nThe slightest spot of black, or even a very dark shade, is regarded\r\nto be a blemish of the most serious kind when observed on the pelt\r\nof a Shorthorn. The Herefords are partly white, partly red; the Devon\r\npossesses in general a deep red hue; the Suffolks are usually of a dun\r\nor faint reddish tint; the Ayrshires are commonly spotted white and red;\r\nand the Kerrys are seen in every shade between a jet black and a deep\r\nred. Uniformity in color would be most desirable in the case of each\r\nvariety, and this object could easily be attained if breeders devoted\r\nsome attention to it.\r\n\r\n_The Form of Animals._--The functions of an animal are arranged by\r\nBichat, an eminent physiologist, into two classes--those relating to\r\nits nutrition, and those exhibited by its muscular and mental systems.\r\nThe first class of functions comprise the _vegetative_, or organic life\r\nof the animal, and the second class constitute its _relative_ life.\r\nAdopting this arrangement, we may say, then, that those animals in which\r\nthe vegetative life is far more energetic than the relative life are\r\nbest suited for the purposes of the feeder. In tigers, wolves, and dogs\r\nthe relative life predominates over the vegetative; the muscles are\r\nalmost constantly in a high degree of tension, and the processes of\r\nnutrition are in constant requisition to supply the waste of muscle.\r\nOn the other hand, in oxen, sheep, and pigs, at least when in a state\r\nof domesticity, the muscles are not highly developed; they do not\r\nlargely tax the vegetative processes, and, consequently, the substances\r\nelaborated under the influence of the vegetative life rapidly increase.\r\nThe form of an animal is therefore mainly determined by the activity of\r\nits relative life. In a greyhound, the nervous power of which is highly\r\ndeveloped, the muscles are large and well-knit, the stomach, intended\r\nfor the reception of concentrated nutriment only, is small, and the\r\nlungs are exceedingly capacious. In such an animal the arrangements for\r\nthe rapid expenditure of nervous power must be perfect. It is not merely\r\nnecessary that its muscles should be large and powerful, its lungs must\r\nalso admit of deep inspirations of oxygen, whereby the motive power\r\nwielded by these muscles may be rapidly generated. Now, an animal\r\nexactly opposite in organisation to the greyhound would, according\r\nto theory, be just the kind to select for the production of meat.\r\nThe greyhound and the horse expend all their food in the production\r\nof motive power; the ox and the sheep, being endowed with but a feeble\r\nmuscular organisation, use a smaller proportion of their food for\r\ncarrying on the functions of their relative life, consequently, the\r\nweight of their bodies is augmented by the surplus nutriment. It is\r\nclear, then, that an animal of a lymphatic temperament, an indolent\r\ndisposition, a low degree of nervous power, and a tendency to rapid\r\ngrowth, is the _beau ideal_ of a \"meat-manufacturing machine.\" Now, as\r\nthe larger the lungs of an animal are, the greater is its capacity for\r\n\"burning,\" or consuming its tissues, one might suppose that small lungs\r\nwould be a _desideratum_ in an ox, or other animal destined for the\r\nshambles. This appears to be Liebig's opinion, for in one of his\r\nbooks he states that \"a narrow chest (small lungs) is considered by\r\nexperienced agriculturists a sure sign, in pigs, for example, of easy\r\nfattening; and the same remark applies to cows, in reference to the\r\nproduce of milk--that is, of butter.\" On this subject Professor Tanner\r\nmakes the following remarks, in his excellent Essay on Breeding and\r\nRearing Cattle:[18]--\"In our high-bred animals we find a small liver\r\nand a small lung, accompanied with a gentle and peaceful disposition.\r\nNow, these conditions, which are so desirable for producing fat, are\r\nequally favorable for yielding butter. The diminished organs economise\r\nthe consumption of the carbonaceous matters in the blood, hence, more\r\nremains for conversion into fat, but equally prepared for yielding\r\ncream, if the tendency of the animal is equally favorable to the same.\"\r\nOne would imagine, from the foregoing passage, that Mr. Tanner and Baron\r\nLiebig coincided in believing small lungs necessary to rapid fattening;\r\nbut in another part of his essay, Tanner thus describes one of the\r\npoints indicative of a tendency to fatten early:--\"The chest should be\r\nbold and prominent, wide and deep, furnished with a deep but not coarse\r\ndewlap.\" On comparing the two passages which I have quoted from Tanner's\r\nessay, a contradiction is apparent. Mr. Bowly, Major Rudd, and other\r\neminent breeders and feeders, appear to regard a capacious chest as the\r\nbest sign of a fattening property which an animal could show. Lawes and\r\nGilbert have recorded the weights of the viscera of a number of animals\r\nwhich, though supplied with equal quantities of the same kind of food,\r\nattained to different degrees of fatness. On carefully scrutinising\r\nthese records, I failed to perceive any constant relation between the\r\nweight of their lungs and their tendency to fatten rapidly. Some animals\r\nwith large lungs converted a larger proportion of their food into meat\r\nthan others with smaller respiratory organs, and _vice versa_. In a\r\nstate of nature, there is no doubt but that the lungs of the ox and of\r\nthe sheep are moderately large; and it is evident that in their case, as\r\nwell as in that of man, over-feeding and confinement tend to diminish\r\ntheir muscular energy, and, of course, to decrease the capacity of the\r\nlungs. That such a practice does not tend to the improvement of the\r\nhealth of an animal is perfectly evident, but then the perfect ox of\r\nnature is very different from the perfect ox of man. The latter is\r\na wide departure from the original type of its species: any marked\r\ndevelopment of its nervous system is undesirable; and it is valuable\r\nin proportion as its purely vegetative functions are most strongly\r\nmanifested. A young bullock, therefore, of this kind would, no doubt,\r\nbe the most economical kind to rear, provided that it was perfectly\r\nhealthy, and capable of assimilating the liberal amount of food supplied\r\nto it. But it rarely happens that a young animal with a weakly chest\r\nturns out other than a scrofulous or otherwise diseased adult. On the\r\nwhole, then, I am disposed to believe that whilst naturally small-lunged\r\nspecies may be more prone to fatten than large-chested ones, it is not\r\nthe case that small-chested individuals fatten more rapidly than larger\r\nlunged individuals of the same kind.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which oxen, sheep, and pigs have been so long\r\nmaintained in civilised countries, must have diminished the capacity of\r\ntheir chests in relation to other parts of their bodies; and it may be\r\nfairly doubted if any good could result by reducing to still smaller\r\ndimensions those most important organs. Probably the lungs and hearts of\r\nthe improved breeds of stock are already too small, and that it is only\r\nthe individuals which are least affected in this respect that answer to\r\nMr. Bowly's description of a fat-disposed beast. Whether or not small\r\nlungs are desirable in a bullock or milch cow, it is certain that a ram\r\nor a bull should be possessed of a capacious chest, for otherwise he\r\nwill have but little vigour, and will be likely to produce a weakly\r\noffspring. A sire should be a perfectly developed animal in every\r\nrespect--sound lungs and heart, and not over fat. It is sufficient that\r\nit belongs to a good fattening breed; but to produce offspring with a\r\ntendency to fatness and early maturity, it is not necessary that the\r\nsire should himself be obese. It is to be regretted that so many sires\r\nof the Shorthorns and other improved varieties should be used for\r\nbreeding purposes, when their hearts and lungs have become, by\r\nover-feeding the animals, unfitted for the proper discharge of their\r\nfunction. The progeny of such sires must _naturally_ inherit the\r\n_acquired taint_ of their diseased progenitors, and prove weakly and\r\nunhealthy animals.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the general outline structure of a bull, he should have\r\na small, well-set head, rounded ribs, straight legs, small bones, and\r\nsound internal organs. The following are considered to be the best\r\npoints in a Shorthorn bull:--A short and moderately small head, with\r\ntapering muzzle and broad forehead, furnished with short, white,\r\ncurved, graceful looking horns; bright, yet mild, large eyes, placed in\r\nprominent orbits; dilated nostrils, and flesh-colored nose, and long,\r\nthin ears. The neck should be broad, deep, and muscular, sloping in a\r\ngraceful line from the shoulder to the head. The chest should be wide,\r\ndeep, projecting, but level in front. The shoulders should be oblique,\r\nthe blades well set in towards the ribs. The forelegs should be stout,\r\nmuscular above the knee, and slender below it; the hind legs should be\r\nslender to the hock, and from thence increase in thickness to the\r\nbuttocks, which should be well developed. The carcass should be well\r\nrounded at each side, but level on the back and on the belly. There\r\nshould be no hollows between the shoulder and the ribs, the line from\r\nthe highest part of the shoulder to the insertion of the tail should be\r\na perfect level. The flank should be full, the loins broad, and the tail\r\nfinely formed and only partially covered with hair. The skin is a prime\r\npoint: it must be covered with hair of a roan, or other _fashionable_\r\ncolor, and communicate to the hand of the experienced feeler, a peculiar\r\nsensation, which it is impossible to describe. With regard to this\r\npoint, I cannot do better than quote the words of an experienced\r\n\"handler\":--\r\n\r\n\"A nice or good judge of cattle or sheep, with a slight touch of the\r\nfingers upon the fatting points of the animal--viz., the hips, rump,\r\nribs, flanks, breast, twist, shoulder score, &c. will know immediately\r\nwhether it will make fat or not, and in which part it will be the\r\nfattest. I have often wished to convey in language that idea or\r\nsensation we acquire by the touch or feel of our fingers, which enables\r\nus to form a judgment when we are handling an animal intended to be\r\nfatted, but I have as often found myself unequal to that wish. It is\r\nvery easy to know where an animal is fattest which is already made fat,\r\nbecause we can evidently feel a substance or quantity of fat--all those\r\nparts which are denominated the fatting points; but the difficulty is to\r\nexplain how we know or distinguish animals, in a lean state, which will\r\nmake fat and which will not--or rather, which will make fat in such\r\npoints or parts, and not in others--which a person of judgment (_in\r\npractice_) can tell, as it were, instantaneously. I say _in practice_,\r\nbecause I believe that the best judges _out of practice_ are not able to\r\njudge with precision--at least, I am not. We say this beast _touches_\r\nnicely upon its ribs, hips, &c., &c., because we find a mellow, pleasant\r\nfeel on those parts; but we do not say soft, because there are some of\r\nthis same sort of animals which have a soft, loose handle, of which we\r\ndo not approve, because, though soft and loose, have not the mellow feel\r\nabove mentioned. For though they both handle soft and loose, yet we know\r\nthat the one will make fat and the other will not; and in this lies the\r\ndifficulty of the explanation. We clearly find a particular kindliness\r\nor pleasantness in the feel of the one much superior to the other, by\r\nwhich we immediately conclude that this will make fat, and the other not\r\nso fat; and in this a person of judgment, and _in practice_, is very\r\nseldom mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nIn many respects the good points in a Shorthorn cow resemble those in\r\nthe male of that breed, but in others there is considerable difference.\r\nAs I have described in prose the excellencies which a bull should\r\npossess, I will now give a poetical summary of the good points of a cow\r\nof that breed, extracted from the _Journal of Agriculture_, and composed\r\nevidently by an excellent breeder and poet, Mr. Carr:--\r\n\r\n  The following features constitute, I trow,\r\n  The beau ideal of a short-horn cow:--\r\n  Frame massive, round, deep-barrell'd, and straight-back'd;\r\n  Hind quarters level, lengthy, and well pack'd;\r\n  Thighs wide, flesh'd inwards, plumb almost to hock;\r\n  Twist deep, conjoining thighs in one square block;\r\n  Loin broad and flat, thick flesh'd, and free from dip;\r\n  Back ribs \"well home,\" arch'd even with the hip;\r\n  Hips flush with back, soft-cushion'd, not too wide;\r\n  Flanks full and deep, well forward on the side;\r\n  Fore ribs well-flesh'd, and rounded like a drum;\r\n  Fore flanks that even with the elbow come;\r\n  Crop \"barrell'd\" flush with shoulders and with side;\r\n  Girth large and round--not deep alone, but wide;\r\n  Shoulders sloped back, thick cover'd wide at chine;\r\n  Points snug, well-flesh'd, to dew-lap tapering fine;\r\n  Neck vein fill'd up to well-clothed shoulder-point;\r\n  Arm full above, turn'd in at elbow-joint;\r\n  Legs short and straight, fine boned 'neath hock and knee;\r\n  Belly cylindrical, from drooping free;\r\n  Chest wide between the legs, with downward sweep;\r\n  Brisket round, massive, prominent, and deep;\r\n  Neck fine at head, fast thickening towards its base;\r\n  Head small, scope wide, fine muzzle and dish'd face;\r\n  Eyes prominent and bright, yet soft and mild;\r\n  Horns waxy, clear, of medium size, unfiled;\r\n  Tail fine, neat hung, rectangular with back;\r\n  Hide soft, substantial, yielding, but not slack;\r\n  Hair furry, fine, thick set, of colour smart;\r\n  Udder well forward, with teats wide apart.\r\n  These points proportion'd well delight the eye\r\n  Of grazier, dairyman, and passer-by;\r\n  And these to more fastidious minds convey\r\n  Appearance stylish, feminine, and gay.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Breeds of the Ox._--The Shorthorned cattle are now generally regarded\r\nas the most valuable breed in these countries. They are the descendants\r\nof a short-horned breed of cattle which existed for centuries in the\r\nnorth-east of England. They were not held in much estimation, their\r\nflesh being coarse; but the cows of this breed yielded abundance of\r\nmilk. In the eighteenth century this breed, it is said, was greatly\r\nimproved by a large infusion of blood from Dutch Shorthorns: but it is\r\nvery doubtful that any such event took place, for during that period\r\nthe importation of cattle into Great Britain was prohibited by very\r\nstringent laws. The present race of Shorthorns owe most of their\r\nvaluable qualities to the brothers, Charles and Robert Colling, of the\r\ncounty of Durham. The former was the more successful breeder, and\r\nestablished the celebrated breed of Ketton Shorthorns. His whole process\r\nappears to have consisted in the careful selection of parents, and in\r\n\"close\" breeding. He must, however, have been an admirable judge of the\r\ngood points of the ox, for beginning with animals not worth more on an\r\naverage than L10 each, he produced in less than a quarter of a century\r\na stock worth on the average L150 each. The most famous bull of Charles\r\nColling's was Comet. The sale of this animal realised the handsome sum\r\nof 1,000 guineas. The bull Hubback is said by many writers to have been\r\nthe great improver of Shorthorn blood. He was bought by Robert Colling\r\nfor the trifling sum of L8; but although this animal was kept by both\r\nCollings for three years, there is good reason to believe that they made\r\nbut little use of him. It would appear, indeed, that to the cows first\r\nused by the Collings--Lady Maynard, and young Strawberry--many of the\r\ngood qualities of this breed are traceable. Shorthorns are now to be\r\nfound in almost every part of the United Kingdom, capable of maintaining\r\nheavy stock. In Ireland the breed has been greatly improved, and it is\r\ngradually supplanting most of the other varieties.\r\n\r\nShorthorn males have a short, wide head, covered very often with short\r\ncurly hair; the muzzle is taper; the ear rather long and narrow; the eye\r\nlarge, and bright, and mild. The shape is symmetrical, the carcass deep,\r\nthe back level, ribs spreading out widely, and the limbs fine. The color\r\nis a mixture of red and white, sometimes a rich roan. The females are\r\nnot so large in the head, which tapers more, and the neck is much\r\nthinner.\r\n\r\nThe DEVONS are not so large as the Shorthorns. Their shape is\r\nsymmetrical; fine head, horns of medium size, often tapering gracefully;\r\nrich red or orange red color; fore-quarters rather oblique. The meat of\r\nthis breed is much esteemed: they yield excellent milk, but in rather\r\nlimited quantity; and the bullocks answer the plough much better than\r\nmany other kinds do. These animals arrive early at maturity.\r\n\r\nThe HEREFORDS are a rather small-boned breed; their horns are medium\r\nsized, straight or slightly curved upwards; their color is dark red;\r\nneat shoulders, thin thighs, and wide sirloin. They fatten well, but are\r\nnot generally kept on dairy farms. In many respects they resemble the\r\nDevons.\r\n\r\nThe AYRSHIRES have a tapering head, fine neck, and large, bony, but not\r\ncoarse carcass; flat ribs; short and rather ugly horns; their skin is\r\nsoft, and covered with hair, which is usually red and white in spots.\r\nThe Ayrshire cows are invaluable for dairy purposes.\r\n\r\nThe POLLED ANGUS, POLLED ABERDEENS, and POLLED GALLOWAYS are very large\r\ncattle, with big heads, unfurnished with horns. Their color is in\r\ngeneral a decided black, but occasionally it exhibits a mixture of black\r\nand white. Their flesh is in general not of the best quality, but some\r\nof their crosses with Shorthorns yield excellent meat, and at an early\r\nage, too.\r\n\r\nThe KYLOES are a breed peculiar to the Highlands of Scotland. They are\r\nrather rough, but very picturesque animals, covered with long, shaggy\r\nhair. Their horns are rather long, and curve upwards. Their hair is\r\ndifferently colored--red, yellow, dun, and black, the latter being the\r\nprevailing hue. No variety of the ox yields a sweeter meat than the\r\nKyloes, and other mountain breeds of these countries. The animals,\r\nhowever, arrive slowly to maturity, and in this respect there is great\r\nroom for improvement. These mountain-bred animals are now transferred\r\nin large numbers to lowland tillage farms, where the fattening process\r\nis more expeditiously performed. There are excellent crosses between\r\nShorthorn bulls and Highland cows.\r\n\r\nLONGHORNED CATTLE are rapidly advancing towards extinction. At one time\r\nthey were the chief breed kept by most farmers. In general they may be\r\nregarded as an inferior variety, being slow feeders, and producing\r\nrather coarse beef. They are, however, capable of great improvement, as\r\ninstanced in the case of Bakewell's celebrated Longhorn herds.\r\n\r\nThe KERRYS are a diminutive breed, peculiar to Ireland. They have small\r\nheads, fine necks, fine horns of medium length, and curved upwards near\r\ntheir summits. They have a soft skin; the hair is generally black,\r\ninterspersed with a few white streaks; sometimes their color is red, and\r\noccasionally brown. They are a very hardy race, being indigenous to\r\nmountains. Their flesh is very good, more especially if the animals have\r\nbeen kept on fattening food. The Kerrys are good milch cows.\r\n\r\nThe ALDERNEYS are a small race of oxen with deer-like faces. They\r\nexhibit various shades of red, white, brown, and roan. No cows yield\r\nbetter milk, or larger quantities of that fluid.\r\n\r\n_Sheep._--The different breeds of sheep are classified under three\r\nheads--viz., _Long-woolled_, _Short-woolled_, and _Middle-woolled_.\r\n\r\nThe LEICESTER is, perhaps, the most celebrated breed of sheep reared in\r\nthese countries. It was immensely improved by Bakewell about a century\r\nago, and the breed is often termed the Dishley, after the name of\r\nBakewell's residence. This sheep has a wide, clean head, broad forehead,\r\nfine eyes, long, thin ears, thick neck, round body, deep chest,\r\nstraight, broad back, high ribs, and muscular thighs. The wool is long,\r\nvery thick, and fine. At from fifteen to eighteen months old, the\r\nLeicester weighs from 25 to 30 lbs. per quarter; but a fat animal often\r\nweighs from 38 to 40 lbs. per quarter. The fleece weighs from 6 to 8\r\nlbs. This breed is well adapted for Ireland. It is reared on very poor\r\nland: but in order to maintain its good quality, this sheep requires\r\nabundance of food, and also good shelter during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe LINCOLN is distinguished for its large bones and strong muscles.\r\nOriginally a gaunt and ugly animal, it has of late years been much\r\nimproved. Indeed, the prices lately realised by Lincoln sheep are\r\nextremely high. The Lincoln has a long, white face, long body, and thick\r\nlegs. The wool is long, thick, and moderately fine. The flesh of the\r\nLincoln is lean, owing to its great muscular development. At fifteen\r\nmonths old it yields about 30 lbs. weight per quarter. It is said that\r\na Lincoln wether has attained the weight of 304-1/2 lbs. The average\r\nweight of the wool of a hogget is 9-1/2 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe COTSWOLD breed arose in the Cotswold hills, in Gloucestershire.\r\nIn this variety the skeleton is large, the chest capacious, the back\r\nbroad and straight, and the ribs well arched. It has good quarters,\r\nand a finely-arched neck. It is distinguished by a large tuft of\r\nwool--\"fore-top,\" on the forehead. It fattens early, and produces about\r\n25 lbs. per quarter when fifteen months old, and 40 lbs. when two years\r\nold. The wool is rather coarse; its yield is about 8 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe CHEVIOT has a long body, long face, long legs, and long ears. The\r\nchest projects slightly, and is rather narrow. The forehead is bare of\r\nwool; the legs and face are white, sometimes approaching to a dun shade.\r\nWeight from 70 to 80 lbs.; weight of fleece, from 3 to 4 lbs. The wool\r\nis of excellent quality, and is used largely in the manufacture of\r\ntweeds. The Cheviot is a mountain sheep, and, as might be expected, its\r\nflesh is well flavored. There are several crosses of the Cheviot with\r\nthe Leicester, the Southdown, and the Shropshire.\r\n\r\nThe SOUTHDOWN is generally regarded as the best breed for wool reared in\r\nthese countries. It is indigenous to the chalk hills of Kent, Sussex,\r\nHampshire, and Dorsetshire. It has a small head; its back is broad and\r\nstraight; the ribs spring out at nearly right angles from the vertebrae.\r\nIt is rather light in the fore-quarters, and full in the hind quarters.\r\nIts chest is pretty deep; its face and legs are grey or brown. The wool\r\nof the Southdown is short, and extremely fine; the fleece weighs about 3\r\nlbs. This sheep arrives early at maturity. It weighs at 15 months old\r\nabout 80 lbs. The flesh is very well flavored.\r\n\r\nTHE SHROPSHIRE is said to combine in itself the good qualities of the\r\nSouthdown, the Cotswold, and the Leicester. It resembles the Southdown\r\nmore than any other breed, having the same grey, or brownish grey hue,\r\nand a similar shape. It is, however, larger than the Southdown, and\r\nyields a larger quantity of wool. This breed is becoming a great\r\nfavorite in both England and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe BLACK-FACED sheep is peculiar to Scotland. It is equipped with\r\nhorns, has a bold long face, and possesses a tuft of wool on its\r\nforehead; its limbs are strong, and its body is somewhat long. The wool\r\nof this breed is very coarse, the fleece weighs about 3-1/2 lbs. The\r\naverage weight of this sheep is 75 lbs., the quality of the mutton is\r\nexcellent, but it is long before it becomes matured. There are several\r\nother breeds of the sheep, but they are of far less importance than\r\nthose which I have described.\r\n\r\n_Breeds of the Pig._--There are several breeds of this useful animal, of\r\nwhich those known as BERKSHIRE and YORKSHIRE appear to be the greatest\r\nfavorites. The Berkshire is black or dusky brown, very rarely reddish\r\nbrown. It has a very small head. Its sides are extremely deep, and its\r\nlegs very short. There are several sub-varieties of the Yorkshire. This\r\nbreed is white, has a compact body, and very broad sides. The head is\r\nvery small, somewhat like that of the Berkshire. Both Berkshire and\r\nYorkshire pigs attain to the enormous weight of 1,000 lbs. The old Irish\r\n\"racer\" pig is the least profitable kind to keep, but fortunately it is,\r\nas a pure breed, nearly extinct.\r\n\r\n_Breeds of the Horse._--There are a great many breeds of horses. The\r\nShetland pony is so small, that many specimens are no larger than a\r\nNewfoundland dog; on the other hand, Clydesdale horses sometimes attain\r\nto almost elephantine proportions. There is a wide difference between\r\nthe bull-like Suffolk Punch and the greyhound-like _racer_. The English\r\nand Irish racer is said to owe its origin to a cross between the old\r\nEnglish light-legged breed and the Arabian. The most valuable kind of\r\ncarriage horse is the joint product of the draught-horse and the racer.\r\nThe dray-horse of these countries has a large share of Flemish blood in\r\nhim. The best horses for agricultural purposes are unquestionably the\r\nCLYDESDALE and the SUFFOLK PUNCH. The latter is perhaps to be preferred\r\nin most instances, especially on light lands. Very light and feeble\r\nhorses are the most expensive variety on almost any kind of farm; for\r\nwhilst they consume nearly as much food as the most powerful animals,\r\nand are therefore nearly as costly, they are incapable of effectively\r\nperforming their work. A large proportion of the farm horses used by the\r\nsmall farmers of Ireland are totally unsuited for tillage purposes. On\r\nthe other hand, there is no need to employ horses equal in size to the\r\nponderous creatures that draw brewers' carts. Moderate sized horses,\r\nwith well rounded, compact bodies, and muscular but not too heavy limbs,\r\nare the kind best adapted for farm purposes. In Ireland, where there are\r\nnot fewer than 600,000 horses, a considerable infusion of blood from\r\nClydesdales and Suffolk Punches is much required.\r\n\r\n_Hunters and Racers._--There is a strong tendency in the human mind to\r\nlook with a regretful feeling to the past, and to compare it to the\r\ndisadvantage of the present. It is a general belief with most people\r\nthat the old time was the best time; that the seasons were more genial\r\nformerly; that provisions were cheaper and more abundant; that men were\r\ntaller, and stouter, and healthier; that, in a word, everything was\r\nbetter in the days of yore than it is now, and that degeneracy and\r\neffeteness are the prevailing characteristics of our age. Philosophers,\r\nstatists, and political economists tell us that all this regret for the\r\n\"good old time\" is mis-spent sympathy; for that we are in every respect\r\nsuperior--in physique, health, morals, and wealth--to our ancestors. On\r\nthe whole, I rather incline myself to this comfortable philosophy; but\r\nwe must admit that we have not progressed in all things since the times\r\nof our fathers.\r\n\r\nIn a work entitled \"A Comparative View of the Form and Character of the\r\nEnglish Racer and Saddle Horse during the Last and Present Centuries,\"\r\npublished by Hookham, of Old Bond Street, London, it is proved very\r\nclearly that the English race-horse has sadly degenerated. The author\r\nvery properly traces the cause of its decay to the avarice of the\r\nturfites: they look upon the noble animal as a mere gambling machine;\r\nand they sacrifice all its other qualities to the excessive development\r\nof that one which is likely to put money in their pockets. Formerly,\r\ngentlemen kept horses for their own sakes--for their admiration and\r\nenjoyment of one of the most beautiful, docile, and useful of animals.\r\nThey were incessant in their efforts to develop into perfection all the\r\nreally valuable points in the animal; and the result was, that the\r\nEnglish and Irish racer of the last century was unmatched for strength,\r\nspeed, and endurance. Models of this splendid race of horses are seldom\r\nto be found at the present time; but there are, perhaps, sporting men\r\nliving who saw them in the celebrated Mambrino, Sweet Briar, and Sweet\r\nWilliam. Those horses possessed compact bodies, capacious lungs, strong\r\nloins, large joints, and enormous masses of muscular tissue on the\r\nshoulder-blades and arms. They were good weight-carrying hunters as well\r\nas racers, and they could carry eight stones over a six miles heat,\r\nor twelve stones over a four miles one. The Irish horses, at least,\r\nwere capable of safely carrying thirteen stones over what would now be\r\nconsidered a very ugly ditch, and could get over a long steeplechase in\r\na style which would astonish the owners of the modern \"weeds.\" Since the\r\ndistance to be traversed by competing horses has been reduced from the\r\nold-fashioned three heats of four miles each to a single run of a mile\r\nor two, and also since the weight imposed upon the animals has been\r\nreduced to six or seven stones, from ten to twelve, the anatomical\r\nstructure of the race-horse has undergone a remarkable and serious\r\nalteration. The back has become very long, the sides flat, the loins\r\nweak, the limbs long and very thin; and this alteration in structure has\r\nbeen attended by weakness of constitution and a remarkable tendency\r\nto disease. The modern horse has attained to a remarkable degree of\r\nrapidity of locomotion, but it has been at the expense of its vigor,\r\nendurance, and health; it can run with great velocity for a short\r\ndistance, but in a four-mile heat, and mounted by a man of average\r\nweight, a mediocre horse of the style of the middle of the last century\r\nwould come to the post long before the winner of the last St. Leger.\r\n\r\nThe decay of the breed of horses in this country is a serious matter,\r\nand the attention of all who are interested in the preservation of this\r\nanimal should be earnestly and promptly directed towards discovering\r\nthe means of regeneration. My remarks are directed towards racers and\r\nhunters. The quality of speed which they possess has been developed\r\nto an extent which is incompatible with the development of equally\r\nessential properties. Encouragement should be given to the production of\r\nweight-carrying hunters; steeple-chasing should be restored to its old\r\nstate, when only a powerful horse had a chance of success. The quality\r\nof speed should be promoted in the animal up to a certain point; but\r\nwhen the development of this attribute begins to cause a loss of\r\nstrength and endurance, it is high time to check it. There are a few\r\nhorses at present which are strong and moderately fast: why should not\r\nsteeple-chasing be of the kind which would call this style of animal\r\ninto competition? Only a \"weed\" can now enter with any probability of\r\nsuccess at a race of this kind; and when he has won it, of what use\r\nis he as a good hunter? What we want are good, stout, healthy horses,\r\ncapable of carrying, in good style, twelve stones weight over a rough\r\ncountry; and the object of steeple-chasing should be the production of\r\nsuch a race of horses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Improved by Leicester blood.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: The object of the first breeders of the Leicester was\r\nto produce a sheep which would yield a great carcass, and small offal\r\nweight. So far as the results of these experiments go, I think the idea\r\nof the founder of this breed has been realised.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: \"Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of\r\nScotland,\" for July, 1860.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nON THE MANAGEMENT OF LIVE STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nTHE OX.\r\n\r\n_Breeding Cows._--The period of gestation in the cow is about nine\r\nmonths. The earliest time at which it is at all safe to breed from these\r\nanimals is when they are one year and eight months old. Shorthorns breed\r\nearly, whilst the mountain varieties are seldom in calf before they are\r\nthree years old. The practice of very early breeding, though approved of\r\nby some extensive rearers of stock, is not to be commended for sound\r\nphysiological reasons. Cows calve at all times of the year; but the most\r\nfavorable time is near the end of winter, or in early spring. The cows\r\nshould at this time be in fair condition--neither too fat nor too lean.\r\nParturition should take place in a roomy, covered place, provided with\r\nabundance of clean litter. If such a place be not available, a nice\r\npaddock close to the house must answer. After having given birth to\r\nthe calf, the cow should receive an oatmeal drink, or some warm and\r\nnutritious mash, and afterwards be liberally fed. The cow is usually\r\nallowed to run dry four or five weeks before calving: this period should\r\nnot be curtailed; on the contrary, it would be better to extend it to\r\nsix weeks, so as not to allow her condition to become too poor.\r\n\r\n_The Wintering of Young Stock._--There are certain localities wherein\r\nthe rearing of young stock is one of the easiest tasks which devolve\r\nupon the farmer. Well-drained and shady fields, yielding abundance of\r\nsound herbage, and through which streams of _pure_ water unceasingly\r\nflow, are just the proper _locale_ for economically feeding young\r\nanimals. But there are districts in which those favorable conditions do\r\nnot exist; yet they are not better adapted to other uses. It is only the\r\nfeeders of young stock in wet, moory, sandy, or undrained, heavy soils\r\nwho really have cause for anxiety and incessant watchfulness. In rearing\r\na calf the great object is to cause a rapid and uninterrupted increase\r\nin the weight of its body. At first the food of the animal should be\r\nfurnished solely from the maternal founts; but at an early stage of its\r\nexistence--about the third or fourth week--other food may wholly, or in\r\npart, be substituted for the natural aliment. It is important that no\r\ngreat interval should elapse between the hours of feeding. The digestive\r\napparatus of the young animal is small, and its powers of assimilation\r\nare very energetic. The food with which it is supplied should,\r\ntherefore, be given in moderate quantities, and very frequently. This\r\nis, in fact, what takes place when the calf is allowed free access to\r\nits dam; for the instant it feels a desire for aliment, the supply is at\r\nonce available. Of course, there may be objections to this plan on the\r\nscore of economy; but as a general rule, too much liberality cannot be\r\nexercised in feeding growing animals; and there is nothing more certain\r\nthan that the calf which is illiberally fed will never be developed into\r\na valuable, matured animal. When carefully tended from their birth,\r\ncomfortably housed in winter, and abundantly supplied with nutritious\r\nfood, it is sometimes wonderful the rapid progress which young stock\r\nmake. Mr. Wright mentions a remarkable case of early maturity, which\r\noccurred in his own herd. A young steer, one year old, exhibited all the\r\ndevelopment of an animal twice its age. This bullock had been suckled\r\nfor three months, whereby it had not only kept its calf-flesh, but\r\ngained and retained a step in advance. Its weight when only a year old\r\nwas no less than 50 stones; and as the price of beef at the time was 8s.\r\n9d. per stone, live weight, the carcass of the animal was worth L21 17s.\r\n6d. Mr. Wright offers this fact as a suggestive one to \"those farmers who\r\nthink of bringing up their calves on old milk, or who would otherwise\r\nstint their growth.\"\r\n\r\nSupposing, then, that we have young stock which had been liberally\r\ntreated when in their \"baby\" state, how are we to most economically\r\nmaintain them throughout the winter? In the first place, they should be\r\nkept in warm sheds, and well sheltered from both rain and wind. Some\r\nauthorities contend that exercise is necessary to young stock, and deny\r\nthat a proper development of the muscles (lean flesh) can take place if\r\nthey are cooped up like fattening turkeys during the winter. There is\r\nsome truth in this opinion; and if the animals be designed for breeding\r\nor dairy purposes, their freedom of motion should only be partially\r\nrestrained. On the other hand, if they be intended for an early\r\nintroduction to the shambles, the less exercise they get the greater\r\nwill be the profit on their keep. I have known cases where animals were\r\nclosely housed for seven months, and yet their health did not appear\r\nto suffer in the slightest degree. In fact, so predominant are the\r\nvegetative functions of the ruminants over their nervous attributes,\r\nthat the only essential conditions of their existence are adequate\r\nsupplies of good air and food. That the health of these animals does\r\noccasionally suffer when the motions of their bodies are reduced to a\r\n_minimum_ is quite true; but in most of these instances the real cause\r\nis, not the want of exercise, but the want of pure air. The greatest\r\ncare should, therefore, be taken in the ventilation of the places where\r\nstock, whether old or young, are kept; and no economy of space or heat\r\nwill compensate for the want of wholesome air. Under the fallacious idea\r\nthat exposure to cold renders young stock hardy, many farmers turn them\r\nout to eat straw in the open fields in frosty weather. Treatment of this\r\nkind, instead of being productive of good, almost invariably lays the\r\nfoundation of disease, which will manifest itself at some stage of the\r\nanimal's growth. There are a few favored localities, such as those to\r\nwhich I have already alluded, where yearlings may be occasionally allowed\r\na turn through the fields in winter; but on cold clays, wet moors, and\r\nsandy soils the young stock should never be permitted to leave their\r\nsheds or courts from the time they are housed till late in the spring.\r\n\r\nYoung stock are best fed on good meadow hay and turnips, with a moderate\r\nsupplement of oil-cake; this, however, is expensive feeding in many\r\nfarms, and a little filling-in may be done with cheaper or more easily\r\nobtainable stuffs. A mixture of cut chaff, with pulped mangels, is a\r\ngood substitute for the more costly hay; and particularly in the case\r\nof animals intended for breeding or for the dairy. The roots should be\r\npulped, and allowed to remain until, owing to a slight fermentation,\r\nthey become warm. This change takes place in from twenty-four hours to\r\nsixty hours, according to the temperature; but the fermentation should\r\nnot be carried farther than the earliest stage. The heated pulp should\r\nthen be thoroughly mixed with the chaff, and the compound, after an\r\nhour or two, will be ready for use. A little chopped hay--no matter if\r\ninferior or slightly mildewed--may be substituted for the chaff, and\r\nturnips employed instead of the mangels, but the latter are the more\r\ndesirable roots.\r\n\r\nUntil lately, the use of oil-cake was confined to fattening animals,\r\nbut latterly it is freely given to calves, even when they are only\r\na month old; and there is no doubt but that it is a suitable and\r\neconomical food for store stock. It is, however, sometimes given in\r\nexcess: from half a pound to two and a half pounds daily will be\r\nsufficient for animals under one year; and this addition to their food\r\nwill be found to exercise a beneficial influence on them when they\r\nare placed in stalls for finishing. The experience of several eminent\r\nbreeders has proved that fattening beasts, which had in their youth\r\na supply of oil-cake, or its equivalent, invariably store up a larger\r\nportion of their food than those which had been reared on hay and roots\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nMr. George Stodart, of Cultercullen, an Aberdeenshire farmer, describes,\r\nin the _Irish Farmer's Gazette_, his method of rearing calves:--\r\n\r\n    I occupy (says Mr. Stodart) a farm of 380 acres. I usually rear\r\n    twenty-four calves yearly, and buy in sixteen one-year-olds.\r\n    I generally breed from cross cows (the same as mentioned above),\r\n    served by a pure Shorthorn bull. When the calves are dropped I put\r\n    two calves to suck one cow for six months. In autumn, spring calves\r\n    are put into the house upon turnips and straw, with about 1 lb. of\r\n    oil-cake per day to each, until they are put out to grass in spring\r\n    following, at which time they are one year old. Then, of course,\r\n    they have grass in summer, and at the approach of winter they are\r\n    again housed upon turnips and straw, which bring them to be two\r\n    years old in spring. Now they are sent out to the best grass, and\r\n    again brought into the house at the beginning of September, and\r\n    fed on turnips and straw until the end of November or middle of\r\n    December, when they usually fetch from L25 to L32 a-head. This\r\n    year (1864), however, they will average L32. a-head. Before selling\r\n    I give each 3-1/2 lbs. of oil-cake per day for six weeks, and during\r\n    this time they have swede turnips; at other times yellow. We give as\r\n    much turnips at all times as they can eat.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bowick, in his excellent paper on the rearing of calves, published\r\nin the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, gives the following\r\ninformation on this subject:--\r\n\r\n    We consider it desirable to allow the calf to remain with its\r\n    dam for the first three or four days after calving.\r\n\r\n    Not much trouble is generally experienced in getting it to take\r\n    to the pail. We find it better to miss the evening's meal, and\r\n    next morning a very little attention induces the majority of them\r\n    to partake of what is set before them. At most the guidance of the\r\n    fingers may be wanted for the first meal or two.\r\n\r\n    As regards the quantity of milk which is needful to keep a\r\n    moderately bred Shorthorn calf in a thriving condition, we have\r\n    found the following allowance to come pretty near the mark,\r\n    although the appetite of calves varies, both in individuals and\r\n    at different times with the same animal:--\r\n\r\n    1st week with the dam; or 4 quarts per day, at two meals.\r\n\r\n    2nd to 4th week, 5 to 6 quarts per day, at two meals.\r\n\r\n    4th to 6th week, 6 to 7 quarts per day, at two meals.\r\n\r\n    And the quantity need not, during the ensuing six weeks (after\r\n    which it is weaned), exceed a couple of gallons per day. This\r\n    implies that the calf is fed upon new milk only, and that no\r\n    other feeding liquids are employed. But, in addition to the above,\r\n    the calf will, towards the fourth week, begin to eat a little\r\n    green hay; and in a week or two later, some sliced roots, or meal,\r\n    or finely crushed cake, mixed with hay-chaff; and, if really good,\r\n    creditable beasts are wanted--such as will realise L25 a-head from\r\n    the butcher when turned two and a half years old--a little cake\r\n    or meal in their early days will be found a desirable investment.\r\n    In fact, we doubt not but 1 lb. of cake per day to the calf will\r\n    make as much flesh as triple the quantity of cake at any period\r\n    of after life. As regards meal, if that is given with the chaff,\r\n    we prefer oatmeal, or barley-meal, or wheaten flour, but not the\r\n    meal of beans or pease. Others may see it differently, but we\r\n    believe beans to be too heating for any class of young stock. For\r\n    roots, the best we know of is the carrot, grated and mixed with\r\n    the chaff, or sliced thin with a knife and given alone. It is also,\r\n    of all roots, the one which we find them most fond of, and which\r\n    they will most readily take to. As soon as they can eat them\r\n    freely, an immediate reduction in the supply of milk may be made.\r\n\r\n    In most articles it holds good in the end that \"the best is the\r\n    cheapest.\" So with the rearing of calves; the best class of food,\r\n    or that above referred to, is found to give the greatest ultimate\r\n    satisfaction. But practically the question often is, how to rear\r\n    good calves with comparatively little new milk, a condition which\r\n    circumstances often render almost imperative; for where dairy\r\n    produce, in any other form, is the chief object, the calves stand\r\n    in a secondary position, and are treated accordingly. But let us\r\n    ask whether you cannot rear good stock under such circumstances\r\n    also? We believe that this may be, and often is done. We manage to\r\n    turn out from twenty-five to thirty calves annually--such as will\r\n    pass muster anywhere--and never use at any one time more than six\r\n    gallons of new milk daily. For this purpose, as well as to obtain\r\n    a regular supply of milk for other purposes, the calves are allowed\r\n    to come at different periods, extending from October to May. Hence\r\n    the calf-house has generally a succession of occupants throughout\r\n    the season; and as one lot are ready to be removed, and placed loose\r\n    in a small hovel, with yard attached, others fill their places.\r\n    We begin with new milk from the pail, which is continued for a\r\n    fortnight after leaving the cow. Then skim-milk--boiled, and allowed\r\n    to cool to the natural warmth--is substituted to the extent of\r\n    one-third of the allowance. In another week the new milk is reduced\r\n    to half, and at the same time, not before, boiled linseed is added\r\n    to the mess.[20] As soon as they take freely to this food, the new\r\n    milk may be replaced with that from the dairy, and the calf is\r\n    encouraged to indulge in a few sliced carrots and the other dry\r\n    foods named.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Murray, of Overstone, thus states the expense of rearing the calf\r\nuntil it is two years old, when, after the weaning process is completed,\r\nit is turned out to grass:--\r\n\r\n    During the summer they have the run of a grass paddock during\r\n    the day, but return regularly to their yards at night; the\r\n    following winter they are kept in larger yards, and which contain\r\n    a greater number of animals. Their bill of fare for this winter is\r\n    2 lbs. of oil-cake, half a bushel of cut roots, with cut chaff _ad\r\n    libitum_. The chaff has a small quantity of flour or pollard mixed\r\n    with it, is moistened with water, and the whole mass turned over;\r\n    this is done the day previous to using it. By this means they eat\r\n    the chaff with more relish, and moistening it prevents the flour\r\n    being wasted. They are put to grass the following summer, generally\r\n    from the 15th to the 20th of May, or as soon as the pastures are in\r\n    a state to receive them; they remain there on second-rate land till\r\n    about the end of October, when they are brought home and tied up in\r\n    the stalls. The daily allowance is then 4 lbs. linseed-cake, 4 lbs.\r\n    flour--3/4 bean, 1/4 barley--1 bushel of cut roots with cut chaff;\r\n    the flour and chaff is mixed as already described. At about the end\r\n    of December the quantity of cake is increased to 8 lbs., and the\r\n    flour to 6 lbs.; this they continue to receive till they are sold\r\n    to the butcher during the months of March and April, when they\r\n    weigh, on an average, 90 stones of 8 lbs. per bullock, and under\r\n    two years and six months old. At this season of the year beef\r\n    generally makes 5s. per stone--we often make 9s.--but taking that\r\n    as an average would make the value of each beast L22 10s. The cost\r\n    of keeping to this age will be as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                               L  s. d.\r\n\r\n    One calf                                                   2  0  0\r\n    Milk, &c., nine weeks                                      1  5  0\r\n    Cake, grass, &c., forty-three weeks, at 1s. 6d.            3  4  6\r\n    Second year, November till May, cake, flour,\r\n      roots, &c., 2s. 6d. per week, for twenty-six weeks       3  5  0\r\n    May till November, grass, twenty-six weeks, at 2s. 6d.     3  5  0\r\n    Third year, November till April, twenty weeks, at 8s.      8  0  0\r\n                                                             ---------\r\n                                                             L20 19  6\r\n\r\n    Which leaves a gain to each animal of L1 10s. 6d., besides the\r\n    manure.\r\n\r\n_Shelter of Stock._--The great diminution of temperature, and the\r\nfalling off in the supply of herbage, that are coincident with the\r\nclose of the autumn, render it necessary to remove our cattle from the\r\nopen fields, and provide them with some sort of shelter during the\r\nwinter months and early part of the spring.\r\n\r\nThe particular period at which this change of quarters takes place of\r\ncourse varies, and is, in fact, altogether dependent upon the character\r\nof the season. There are some years in which there is, so to speak, a\r\nkind of relapse of the summer, November being bright and warm, instead\r\nof, as is usually the case, cold and foggy. In such a year there is some\r\nherbage to be picked up until the very end of December. On the other\r\nhand, the latter part of October is often very wet, and October frosts\r\nare by no means uncommon. Tempestuous, biting winds in November, or\r\ntorrents of rain, or both, tell severely upon the poor animals in the\r\nfields, even where there is abundance of herbage; and hence, should such\r\nweather take place at the latter part of October, the true economy would\r\nbe to remove the animals at once to sheltered places.\r\n\r\nNothing lowers the temperature of the surface so rapidly as a cold wind.\r\nCaptain Parry, one of the explorers of the Arctic regions, states that\r\nhis men, when well clothed, suffered no inconvenience on exposure to the\r\nlow temperature of 55 degrees below zero, provided the air was perfectly\r\ncalm; but the slightest breeze, when the air was at this temperature,\r\ncaused the painful sensation produced by intense cold. I could adduce\r\nthe experience of many practical men in favor of the plan of affording\r\nshelter to animals, but more especially to those kept in situations\r\nmuch exposed to winds. Mr. Nesbit relates a case bearing on this\r\npoint:--A farmer in Dorsetshire put up twenty or thirty sheep, under\r\nthe protection of a series of upright double hurdles lined with straw,\r\nhaving as a sort of roof, or lean-to, a single hurdle, also lined with\r\nstraw. A like number of sheep, of the same weight, were fed in the open\r\nfield, without shelter of any kind. Each set was fed with turnips _ad\r\nlibitum_. The result was, that those without shelter increased in weight\r\n1 lb. per week for each sheep, whilst those under shelter, although they\r\nconsumed less food, increased respectively 3 lbs. per week.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the latter part of October, or early in November, is\r\nthe time for the removal of live stock from the pastures to the shelter\r\nof the farmstead. In England and Scotland the transference is seldom\r\ndelayed after these dates; but in Ireland it is no uncommon thing to see\r\nthe animals grazing very much later in the year--a circumstance which\r\nthe lateness and mildness of our climate account for. But whatever the\r\ndate may be, the importance of such shelter is universally recognised,\r\neven by those who most neglect it and are least acquainted with the\r\nprinciples upon which its necessity depends. The more important of these\r\nprinciples have already been explained, but they may be here summarised\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n1. A certain amount of warmth is an indispensable condition for the\r\nmaintenance of the life of animals.\r\n\r\n2. The internal heat of the bodies of animals is supplied by the\r\nchemical combination which takes place between the oxygen of the\r\natmospheric air which they inspire and certain of the constituents\r\n(carbon and hydrogen) of the food which they consume, or, to speak more\r\naccurately, of the tissues of their bodies, which are formed out of\r\ntheir food. It is very much in the same way in which our houses are\r\nheated by the burning of coal, turf, or wood in their fire-places, since\r\nthe heat derived in the latter case is obtained from a similar source as\r\nin the former one--namely, by the union of the oxygen of the air with\r\nthe carbon and hydrogen of the fuel. The only real difference between\r\nthe two kinds of combustion is, that in respiration the process is\r\nconducted with an extreme degree of slowness, whilst in the ordinary\r\nfire the combinations take place rapidly, and the heat being evolved\r\nin a much shorter time is proportionately the more intense.\r\n\r\n3. The temperature of the external parts of the animal body varies with\r\nthe nature and quantity of the food supplied to it, and also depends\r\nupon the state of the weather and the character of the protection\r\nafforded to it.\r\n\r\nThe colder the air, the greater will be the quantity of food required,\r\nand the more complete the shelter. In other words, a diminution of\r\ntemperature, no matter how caused, will necessitate an increased amount\r\nof food and more perfect shelter, in order to maintain at the proper\r\ndegree of heat the fluids of the body. It is only the external parts of\r\nthe body that become cold: so long as the animal is in health its blood\r\nalways maintains the same degree of temperature; but in cold weather the\r\nblood is subjected to a greater cooling power than it is in warm\r\nweather, and this cooling power it can only resist by taxing more\r\nextensively the heat-producing resources of the body.\r\n\r\n4. Exposure to wet, even in warm weather, will tend to reduce the\r\ntemperature of the body, since the conversion of water into vapor can\r\nonly be effected at the expense of heat, which heat must be in great\r\npart extracted from the body of the animal itself.\r\n\r\n5. No possible increase of food, however nutritious it may be, can\r\nsuffice to keep up the due warmth and healthy condition of the animal\r\nframe in winter, if shelter from cold and rain be not simultaneously\r\neffected. On the contrary, an animal well protected from the winter\r\nblasts will require much less food than if it were placed in an exposed\r\nposition. The reason of this is, that the amount of food which an animal\r\nexposed to great cold consumes to maintain the temperature of its body\r\nwould, under opposite conditions, be stored up in the form of permanent\r\n\"increase\"--beef or mutton for the butcher, in fact.\r\n\r\nThe fat-forming constituents of the food of stock are in no case\r\nconverted into permanent fat, except when they exceed in quantity the\r\namount required to keep up the internal heat of the animal; but when\r\nthis is constantly reduced by exposure to a wintry temperature, the\r\nfood becomes insufficient for even that purpose, no matter how much\r\naliment is given. What, then, must not be the condition of the\r\nunfortunate animals whose fate it is to be the property of a farmer\r\nwho neither shelters them from the weather nor provides them with a\r\nsufficient quantity of nourishing food!\r\n\r\n_Milch Cows._--When dairy-farming is conducted on pure pastures, the\r\ncows are altogether dependent upon the grasses; and in winter, the\r\nanimals suffer much from scarcity of food. This is the very worst system\r\nof cow-keeping, but it is prevalent amongst many small farmers in\r\nIreland, and is to be met with even in England and Scotland. I am\r\nstrongly of opinion that it would be far more economical to keep cows\r\n(and other cattle) altogether in the house, and feed them with cut\r\ngrass, than to allow them to remain out altogether in the field. There\r\nare several disadvantages resulting from the depasturing of cows. In the\r\nwarm weather, the animals are greatly annoyed by the attacks of flies:\r\nthere is a considerable waste of muscle, caused by the movements of\r\nthe animals whilst in search of their food; and the excrements of the\r\nanimals and their footmarks injure a large portion of the grass. It may\r\nbe somewhat troublesome and expensive to cut the grass, and convey it\r\nfrom the field to the house; but the labor and the cost will be more\r\nthan repaid by the greatly-increased yield of food. A grass-field,\r\nmowed, will produce from 20 to 30 per cent. more food than it would if\r\nit were trampled upon and soiled by cattle. Exercise for an hour or two\r\nin the cool of the evening, or early in the morning (during the hot\r\nweather), will be quite sufficient to keep the animals in health. This\r\nmay be taken in a field, better in a paddock, best of all in a roomy\r\nyard. When cattle are supplied with cut grass, or clover, care should\r\nbe taken not to give it to them when very wet, for otherwise there is\r\ndanger of the excessively moist herbage producing the _hoove_. Neither\r\nshould large quantities of the green food be given to them--the supply\r\nshould be \"little and often.\" Should the food be too succulent, the\r\naddition of a little straw will correct its laxative effects. When\r\nthe stock is about passing from the winter keep to summer food, the\r\ntransition should be gradual; a well-made compound of straw or hay with\r\ngrass (natural or artificial) is much relished by cows. A supply of\r\ngood water is absolutely necessary; but sufficient attention to this\r\nimportant point is seldom given. Cooked food is well adapted for milch\r\ncows. Mangels, kohl-rabi, and cabbages are each of them better food than\r\nturnips, as the latter is apt to impart a disagreeable flavour to the\r\nbutter. Three feeds in the day is a sufficient number for cows. The\r\nfirst meal should be early in the morning, and may consist of roots,\r\nmixed with straw or hay. Some feeders prefer using dry fodder, or cooked\r\nfood of some kind, and not raw roots. The second meal is given at\r\nmid-day, and the third in the evening. The daily allowance of roots\r\nvaries from 2 to 8 stones, depending upon the quantities of other foods\r\nused. Mr. Horsfall's diet is as follows:--Hay, 9 lbs.; rape-cake, 6\r\nlbs.; malt-combs, 1 lb.; bran, 1 lb.; roots, 28 lbs. These substances\r\nare mixed and cooked, and the animals receive them in a warm state.\r\nIn addition to this food, Mr. Horsfall's cows get bean-meal--a cow in\r\nfull milk 2 lbs., others from 1/2 lb. to 1-1/2 lbs.; cost per week per\r\ncow, 8s. 7d.[21] Mr. Alcock, of Skipton, feeds his cows as follows:--Raw\r\nmangels, 20 lbs.; carob beans, 3 lbs.; bran and malt-combs, 1-3/4 lbs.;\r\nbean-meal, 3-1/2 lbs.; rape-cake, 3 lbs.; per diem. A steamed mixture\r\nof wheat and bean straws and shells of oats _ad libitum_. Oats, to the\r\nextent of 2 or 3 lbs. daily, are an excellent food for cows.\r\n\r\nAn important point in dairy economics is the feeding of the cows at\r\n_regular_ intervals. If the usual time for the feed be allowed to pass,\r\nthe animals are almost certain to become very uneasy--to _worry_; and\r\nevery feeder knows, or ought to know, that a fretting beast will neither\r\nfatten nor yield milk satisfactorily. The cow-house ought to be kept as\r\nclean as possible; and the excreta, therefore, should be removed several\r\ntimes a day.\r\n\r\nMr. Harvey, of Glasgow, has probably one of the largest dairies\r\nin the world. His cow byres, 56 yards long, and from 12 to 24 feet\r\nwide--according as one or two rows of cows are to be accommodated--stand\r\nclosely packed, the whole surface of the ground being thus covered by\r\na kind of roof. From 900 to 1,000 cows are constantly in milk. They are\r\nfed during winter partly on steamed turnips (7 tons being steamed daily\r\nin order to give one meal daily to 900 cows), partly on coarse hay, of\r\nwhich, as of straw, they get between 20 and 30 lbs. a day each. They are\r\nalso fed on draff, of which they receive half a bushel daily each; on\r\nIndian corn meal, of which they have 3 lbs. daily each; and on pot-ale,\r\nof which they receive three times a day nearly as much as they will\r\nconsume, _i.e._, from 6 to 10 gallons daily. During the summer they are\r\nlet out, a byreful at a time, for half a day to grass, and on coming\r\nin receive their spent malt and still liquor, and hay in addition. They\r\nare managed, cleaned, and fed by two men to each byre holding about 100\r\ncows. The milking is done three times a day, by women who take charge\r\nof 13 cows in full milk, or double that number in half milk, apiece.\r\nBetween 4 and 5 o'clock a.m. (taking the winter management), the byres\r\nare cleaned out, and the cows receive a \"big shovelful\" of draff\r\napiece, and half their steamed turnips and meal, and a \"half stoupful,\"\r\n(probably 2 gallons) of pot-ale. They are milked very early. At 7 they\r\nreceive their fodder-straw or hay. At 10 they get a \"full stoupful\"\r\n(probably 3 or 4 gallons) of pot-ale. They are milked at noon. At 2\r\np.m., or thereabouts, they are foddered again, and at 4 p.m. receive\r\nthe same food as at the morning meal. They are again milked at 5 to 6,\r\ncleaned out and left till morning. The average produce is stated to be\r\n2 gallons a day per cow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Scott, of Weekston, Peebles, who keeps one of the best managed\r\ndairy farms in the United Kingdom, thus conducts her operations in\r\nthe winter:--At 6 o'clock in the morning the cows are well wiped or\r\nscrubbed, have their bedding removed, and receive each about 4 or 5 lbs.\r\nof straw. At 8 o'clock the cows are milked, and Mrs. Scott examines each\r\nto ascertain whether or not the milk-maid has left any fluid in the\r\nudder--and woe betide the careless maid if her work has been carelessly\r\ndone! At 10 o'clock a barrowful of turnips is divided amongst three\r\ncows, and when these roots are not available, a quantity of peas or bean\r\nmeal, with a pint of cold water, takes their place. At 1 o'clock the\r\ncows are allowed out to be watered, and during their absence from the\r\nbyre it is thoroughly cleansed and ventilated. When the state of the\r\nweather prevents the cows from being turned out, they receive twice a\r\nday a handful of oatmeal diffused throughout three pints of water--a\r\nhandful of salt being given in the first of these drinks. When the cows\r\nreturn to the byre, they receive each about 4 or 5 lbs. of straw, and at\r\n4 or 5 o'clock an evening meal of turnips equal to their morning feed.\r\nAt 8 o'clock a \"windling\" of meadow hay is given to each pair of cows,\r\nthe quantity being always regulated according to the requirements of\r\neach cow. The cows upon calving receive, in addition to this allowance\r\nof hay, half a pailful of boiled turnips, mixed with a quart of peas\r\nor bean-meal. This mess is given in a lukewarm state. Mrs. Scott's\r\nsystem may be thus epitomised: Regularity in feeding; sufficient but\r\nnot excessive food; regularity in milking; and minute attention to\r\ncleanliness and ventilation.\r\n\r\n_Stall-feeding._--What becomes of the 90 per cent. of the weight of\r\nthe non-nitrogenous constituents of the food of the sheep, and of the\r\n80 per cent. of that of the nutriment of the pig, which they consume\r\nbut do not store up? I have already partly answered this question. This\r\nportion of the food is chiefly expended in the production of the heat\r\nwith which the high temperature of the animal's body is maintained. Part\r\nof it, no doubt, passes unchanged through its body, either owing to its\r\nindigestibility, or to its being given in excess. The quantity of\r\nnon-nitrogenous matters consumed by a man is influenced greatly by the\r\ntemperature of the air which he habitually breathes, and by the nature\r\nof the artificial covering of his body; there may be other conditions\r\nat present unknown to us, but these are amongst the chief ones. Now, as\r\nthere is sufficient reason to lead us to believe that the consumption\r\nof carbonaceous food by the lower animals is influenced in the same\r\nway by the temperature of the medium in which they exist, the question\r\nnaturally suggests itself, would it not be cheaper to maintain the heat\r\nof the animal by burning the carbon of cheap coal or turf outside its\r\nbody, than by consuming the carbon of costly fat within it? The answer\r\nto this question is not so simple as at first sight it appears to be. We\r\nmust not consider that, because 10 lbs. weight of carbon, as coal, costs\r\nbut a penny, whilst an equal weight of the same element in starch costs\r\ntwenty pence, heat may be furnished to a fattening animal twenty times\r\ncheaper by the combustion of coal than by that of starch. No doubt the\r\namount of heat evolved by the conversion of a pound-weight of carbon\r\ninto carbonic acid is the same, whether it be a constituent of starch or\r\nof coal; but the application of the heat so produced is less under our\r\ncontrol in the latter case. All the heat evolved during the combustion\r\nof the starch within the animal's body is made use of; whilst a very\r\nlarge proportion of that developed by the combustion of coal in a\r\nfurnace cannot in practice be applied to the purpose of heating the\r\nanimal's body.\r\n\r\nIt is only the handiwork of the Creator which is perfect, and no machine\r\nconstructed by the skill of man, for the direction of force, can rival\r\nthat wondrous heat-producing, force-directing mechanism--the animal\r\norganism. According to Dumas, the combustion of about 2-1/2 lbs. of\r\ncarbon in a steam-engine is required to generate sufficient force to\r\nconvey a man from the level of the sea to the summit of Mont Blanc; but\r\na man will ascend the mountain in two days, and burn in his mechanism\r\nonly half a pound of carbon. There is no machine in which heat and\r\nforce are more completely made available than the animal organism; and\r\nwere it not--thanks to the influence of antediluvian sunshine--that\r\nthe carbon of fuel in these countries is so very much cheaper than the\r\ncarbon of food, there is no doubt but that the cheapest mode of keeping\r\nan animal warm would be to allow it to burn its carbon within its\r\nbody. As the matter stands, however, there is no question as to the\r\nadvisability of keeping fattening animals in a warm place. If the\r\ntemperature of the stall be equal to that of the animal's body there\r\nwill be less food consumed in the increase of its fat; because less of\r\nthe fat-forming materials will be expended in the production of heat.\r\nIn this sense, therefore, heat is an equivalent to food, but only within\r\ncertain limits; because heat is developed in large quantity within the\r\nanimal body independently of the temperature of the air. There is,\r\ntherefore, no object to be attained by having the stalls heated beyond\r\n70 or 80 degrees. Indeed, it is to be questioned whether or not stalls\r\nartificially heated are ever properly ventilated. If they be not, the\r\nhealth of the animal will suffer, and its appetite--so essential a point\r\nin fattening stock--will become impaired. We may conclude--firstly,\r\nthat animals, when fattening, should be kept at a temperature not under\r\n70 degrees nor above 90 degrees Fahrenheit; secondly, that the mode of\r\nheating must be such that there is as little wasteful combustion of fuel\r\nas is possible under the circumstances; and, lastly, that no motives of\r\neconomy of fuel should prevent the feeding places from being thoroughly\r\nventilated.\r\n\r\nStall-feeding is not so extensively carried on in Ireland as it is in\r\nGreat Britain. There is a general impression that it does not pay in the\r\nformer country; but if such be the case, it is simply owing to the want\r\nof skill on the part of the Irish feeders.\r\n\r\nThe cattle intended for stall-feeding should be removed (if out) from\r\nthe field in October, and put into the house, or court, or crib, or\r\nhammel, as the case may be. They are fed upon roots, straw, hay, grain,\r\nand artificial food. The greatest skill is required in their treatment.\r\nIt is a nice point to determine which foods are the most economical,\r\nand also to ascertain in what foods excessive proportions of certain\r\nnutritive elements exist. Sufficient food should be given; but any\r\napproach to waste should be avoided. Three feeds a day are usually\r\ngiven, and should be supplied at the same hours each day. For about two\r\nweeks the animals are furnished with white turnips _ad libitum_; but\r\nafter the expiration of that time they receive Swedish turnips, straw,\r\nand grain, or oil-cake. Late in the season mangels will replace turnips.\r\nAlmost every extensive feeder now uses oil-cakes in large quantities;\r\nbut when oats are low in price, they will in general be found a cheap\r\nequivalent for a large proportion of the oil-cake. Different feeders\r\nhave different dietaries, and the nature of the aliments supplied to\r\nfattening stock depends very much upon the market prices of food-stuffs,\r\nand the locality in which the feeding-house is situated. The following\r\ndietaries are but examples of the methods of feeding adopted in\r\ndifferent districts and by different persons:--\r\n\r\nMr. McCombie, of Tillyfour, fattens from 300 to 400 beasts annually,\r\nand obtained for them in 1861 L35 per head. He never exceeds 4 lbs. of\r\noil-cake per diem, nor 2 lbs. of bruised oats, for each beast. He gives\r\nas much turnip and straw as they can consume. He realises L12 per acre\r\nin feeding on Aberdeen and Swedish turnips.\r\n\r\n\"For fatting cattle,\" says Mr. Edmonds, of Cirencester, \"I should\r\nrecommend two parts hay and one part straw, or in forward animals\r\nthree parts hay and one part straw cut in chaff. Those of average size\r\nwill eat somewhere about five bushels per day, with 4 lbs. to 5 lbs.\r\noil-cake, and half a peck of mixed meal, barley and peas, or beans, and,\r\nif cheap, a proportion of wheat also, to be increased to one peck per\r\nday in a month or six weeks after they have come to stall, the oil-cake\r\nand meal to be boiled in water for half-an-hour or three-quarters, and\r\nthrown in the form of rich soup over the chaff, and well mixed, to which\r\nadd a little salt.\"\r\n\r\nColonel M'Douall, of Logan, Wigtonshire, gives 3 lbs. of bean-meal and\r\n3 lbs. of cut straw cooked together, and 84 lbs. of Swedish turnips.\r\n\r\nAccording to the researches of Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert, an ox weighing\r\n1,400 lbs. ought to gain 20 lbs. weekly when fed under cover with 8 lbs.\r\nof crushed oil-cake, 13 lbs. of chopped clover hay, and 47 lbs. of\r\nturnips. The chemical constituents (in a dried state) of this allowance\r\nare as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                            Ounces.\r\n\r\n  Fat-formers, or heat givers                 232\r\n  Flesh-formers                                55\r\n  Mineral matter                               29\r\n\r\n_Cost of Maintaining Animals._--The animal mechanism, which exhibits\r\nthe least tendency to fatten, is the most costly to keep in repair, in\r\nrelation to the work performed by it. If, for example, a sheep store up\r\nin its increase one-fifth of its food, then the remaining four-fifths\r\nare expended in preserving it alive, and their cost represents, so to\r\nspeak, the expense of preserving the animal's body in repair. If another\r\nsheep store up only one-tenth of its food, then the cost of its\r\nmaintenance may be said to be double that of the animal which retains\r\nthe larger proportion of its nutriment in the form of flesh. Of course\r\nin both cases the value of the manure will to a great extent compensate\r\nfor the cost of the food expended in merely keeping the animal alive;\r\nbut that does not affect the proposition, that the less food expended by\r\nan animal in carrying on its vital functions the more valuable is it as\r\na \"meat-manufacturing machine.\" From the moment it is brought into the\r\nworld until it is \"ripe\" for the shambles, an animal should steadily\r\nincrease in weight: every week that it does not store up a portion of\r\nits food in permanent increase is the loss of a week's food to the\r\nfeeder; for all the fodder consumed during that time by the animal is,\r\nso to speak, devoted to its own private purposes. Sheep overcrowded\r\non pastures, milch cows on \"short commons,\" calves kept on bulky\r\ninnutritious food, are all so many sources of positive loss to the\r\nfeeder--and as many proofs that he who aspires to be a successful\r\nproducer of meat, must, in one respect at least, be a devout believer\r\nin the doctrine of Progressive Development.\r\n\r\n_Cooking and Bruising Food._--The cooking, or the otherwise preparing,\r\nof the food of the domesticated animals is a subject which until\r\nrecently was completely ignored by the vast majority of stock feeders.\r\nIt is now, however, beginning to attract a fair amount of attention; and\r\nno doubt ere long the best modes of treating the food of cattle will be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected from our limited experience of the subject, there\r\nexists considerable difference of opinion relative to the proper method\r\nof cooking cattle food; and there are many very extensive feeders who\r\nobject to the plan altogether, and contend that as the food of the\r\ninferior animals is naturally supplied to them in a raw condition,\r\nit would be quite unnatural to give it to them in a cooked state.\r\n\r\nWhatever difference of opinion there may be with regard to the propriety\r\nof cooking the food of stock, we believe there ought not to be a doubt\r\nas to the desirability of mechanically treating the harder kinds of\r\nfeeding stuff. It is quite evident that a horse fed upon hard grains of\r\noats and wiry fibres of uncut hay or straw must expend no inconsiderable\r\nproportion of his motive power in the process of mastication. After a\r\nhard day's work of eight or ten hours he has before him the laborious\r\ntask of reducing to a pulp from 12 lbs. to 20 lbs. weight of exceedingly\r\nhard and tough vegetable matter; and as this operation is carried on\r\nduring the hours which should be devoted to rest, the repose of the\r\nanimal is to some extent interfered with. Indeed, it not unfrequently\r\nhappens that a horse, after a hard day's work, is too tired to chew his\r\nfood properly; he consequently bolts his oats, a large proportion of\r\nwhich, as a matter of course, passes unchanged through the animal's\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nIn order to render fully effective the motive power of the horse, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to pay attention to the condition, as well as to\r\nthe quantity and quality of his nutriment. The force wasted by a horse\r\nin the comminution of his food, when composed of whole oats and uncut\r\nhay and straw, cannot, at the lowest estimate, be less than that which\r\nhe expends in an hour of ordinary work, such as, for example, in\r\nploughing. The preparation of his food by means of water or steam power,\r\nor even by animal motive power, would economise by at least 50 per cent.\r\nthe labor expended in its mastication; and this would be equivalent to\r\nnearly half a day's work in each week, and, consequently, a clear gain\r\nof so much labor to the owner of the animal. In the present time of\r\nwater-power and steam-power corn-mills, one man is able to grind the\r\nflour necessary for the support of several thousand men; in early ages\r\nthe labor of one person in the grinding of wheat served but to supply\r\nthe wants of twenty others. In both cases machinery was employed\r\nfor reducing the grain to flour; but in the one case, the mechanisms\r\nemployed were more than a hundred times more effective than in the\r\nother. But even the most imperfect flour mill is by far a more\r\neconomical system of comminuting corn than the jaws of animals; and if\r\nevery man were obliged, as the horse is, to grind his corn by means of\r\nhis teeth alone, he would find his powers for the performance of other\r\nkinds of labor considerably lessened.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged as an objection to the use of bruised oats by horses,\r\nthat they exercise in that state a laxative influence upon the animal's\r\nbowels. I doubt very much that such is frequently the case, when the\r\nanimal is fed only upon oats and hay and straw; but even if the oats\r\nproduce such an effect, the addition of a small proportion of beans--the\r\nbinding properties of which are well known--will obviate the\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe desirability of mechanically acting upon soft food is not so\r\napparent as the necessity for the bruising of oats is. Roots are so\r\neasily masticable that if they are rendered more so there is danger of\r\ntheir being so hastily swallowed as to escape thorough insalivation,\r\nwhich is so necessary to ensure perfect digestion. To guard against this\r\ndanger, perhaps the best way would be to give pulped mangels and turnips\r\nmixed with cut straw; a mixture which could not easily be bolted.\r\nMr. Charles Lawrence, of Cirencester, who is a great advocate for the\r\ncooking of food, and has frequently published his experience of the\r\nbenefits derivable therefrom, thus describes his method of combining\r\npulped roots with dry fodder:--\r\n\r\n    We find that, taking a score of bullocks together fattening,\r\n    they consume per head per diem three bushels of chaff, mixed\r\n    with just half a cwt. of pulped roots, exclusive of cakes of\r\n    corn; that is to say, rather more than two bushels of chaff\r\n    are mixed with the roots, and given at two feeds, morning and\r\n    evening, and the remainder is given with the cake, &c., at the\r\n    middle-day feed, thus:--We use the steaming apparatus of Stanley,\r\n    of Peterborough, consisting of a boiler in the centre, in which\r\n    the steam is generated, and which is connected by a pipe on the\r\n    left hand with a large galvanised iron receptacle for steaming\r\n    food for pigs, and on the right with a large wooden tub, lined\r\n    with copper, in which the cake, mixed with water, is made into\r\n    a thick soup. Adjoining this is a slate tank, of sufficient size\r\n    to contain one feed for the entire lot of bullocks feeding. Into\r\n    this tank is laid chaff with a three-grained fork, and pressed\r\n    down firmly; and this process is repeated until the slate tank\r\n    is full, when it is covered down for an hour or two before\r\n    feeding time. The soup is then found entirely absorbed by the\r\n    chaff, which has become softened and prepared for ready digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wright, near Dunbar, gives the following account of an experiment\r\nwith pulped roots and straw and oil-cake. It appears to prove the\r\nsuperiority of mixed foods over the same foods consumed separately:--\r\n\r\n    Two lots of year-old cattle were fed; the one in the usual\r\n    way--sliced turnips and straw, _ad libitum_--the others with\r\n    the minced turnips, mixed with cut straw. The first lot consumed\r\n    daily 84 lbs. sliced turnips, 1 lb. oil-cake, 1 lb. rape-cake,\r\n    1/2 lb. bean-meal, broken small and mixed with a little salt,\r\n    and what straw they liked. The second lot ate, each, daily,\r\n    50 lbs. minced turnips, 1 lb. oil-cake, 1 lb. rape-cake, 1/2 lb.\r\n    bean-meal, and a little salt, the whole being mixed with double\r\n    the bulk of cut straw or wheat chaff. In spring, the lot of\r\n    cattle which had the mixed food were in good condition, and\r\n    equally well grown as others, though they had consumed in five\r\n    months two tons less of roots apiece. The reporter does not\r\n    advise the mincing process to be commenced when cattle are very\r\n    forward in condition, as any change of food requires a certain\r\n    time to accustom the animals to it, and in the meantime fat\r\n    cattle are apt to fall off in condition. It ought to be begun\r\n    when they are young and lean.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Duckham, of Baysham Court, Ross, Herefordshire, says:--\r\n\r\n    The advantages of pulping roots for cattle are--1st, Economy\r\n    of food; for the roots being pulped and mixed with the chaff,\r\n    either from threshing or cut hay or straw, the whole is consumed\r\n    without waste, the animals not being able to separate the chaff\r\n    from the pulped roots, as is the case when the roots are merely\r\n    sliced by the common cutter, neither do they waste the fodder as\r\n    when given without being cut.\r\n\r\n    2. The use of ordinary hay or straw. After being mixed with the\r\n    pulp for about twelve hours, fermentation commences, and this\r\n    soon renders the most mouldy hay palatable, and animals eat with\r\n    avidity that which they would otherwise reject. This fermentation\r\n    softens the straw, makes it more palatable, and puts it in a state\r\n    to assimilate more readily with the other food. In this respect\r\n    I think the pulper of great value, particularly upon corn farms\r\n    where large crops of straw are grown, and where there is a limited\r\n    acreage of pasture, as by its use the pastures may be grazed, the\r\n    expensive process of haymaking reduced, and, consequently, an\r\n    increased number of cattle kept. I keep one-third more, giving\r\n    the young stock a small quantity of oil-cake, which I mix with\r\n    the chaff, &c.\r\n\r\n    3. Choking is utterly impossible, and I have only had one case of\r\n    hoove in three years, and that occurred when the mixture had not\r\n    fermented.\r\n\r\n    4. There is an advantage in mixing the meal with the chaff and\r\n    pulped roots for fattening animals, as thereby they cannot separate\r\n    it, and the moisture from the fermentation softens the meal and\r\n    ensures its thorough digestion, whereas, when given in a dry state\r\n    without any mixture, frequently a great portion passes away in the\r\n    manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the value of the process for a grazing farm with but a small quantity\r\nof plough-land, Mr. Corner, of Woodlands, Holford, Bridgewater, thus\r\nspeaks:--\r\n\r\n    My plan is, first commencing with the grazing beasts, to cut about\r\n    an equal quantity of hay and straw and mix with a sufficient\r\n    quantity of roots (mostly mangel) to well moisten the chaff; and as\r\n    the beasts advance in condition, I lessen the straw and increase\r\n    the hay, and in their further progress I mix--in addition to all\r\n    hay, chaff, and roots--from 6 to 10 lb. per day to each bullock of\r\n    barley and bean-meal, according to its size--and I have them large\r\n    sometimes. I sold last week for the London market a lot of Devon\r\n    oxen of very prime quality, averaging in weight upwards of 100 stone\r\n    imperial each.\r\n\r\n    For my horses, cows, yearlings, and oxen--the latter to be kept in\r\n    a thriving condition, and turned to grass, and kept through the\r\n    summer for Christmas, 1860--I cut nearly all straw, with a very\r\n    small quantity of hay, and this the offal of the rick. These also\r\n    have as many pulped roots as will moisten the chaff, except the\r\n    horses, and to them I give, along with bruised oats, just enough\r\n    roots to keep their bowels in a proper condition. To the two or\r\n    three-year-old beasts I give some long straw and a part chaff,\r\n    and the offal (if any) of the food of the above lots of stock.\r\n\r\n    My farm is but a small one--under 200 acres. My predecessor always\r\n    mowed nearly all the pastures for hay, which is about half the\r\n    farm, and with this scarcely ever grazed any beasts, and kept but\r\n    very few sheep. Since my occupation I scarcely ever exceed ten acres\r\n    of meadow with one field of seeds for hay. I keep from 250 to 300\r\n    large-size Leicester sheep, and graze from 20 to 25 large-size\r\n    beasts a year, with other breeding stock in proportion.\r\n\r\n    I consider the pulping of roots is better for fatting pigs than\r\n    anything else. My plan is to have a large two-hogshead vat as near\r\n    the pulping machine as possible, so as to fill it with a malt\r\n    shovel as it comes from the machine; at the same time I keep a lad\r\n    sprinkling meal (either barley or Indian corn) with the roots; and\r\n    this is all done in fifteen or twenty minutes. It is then ready for\r\n    use, to be carried to the pigs in the stalls alongside the fatting\r\n    beasts. I never could fatten a pig with profit until I used pulped\r\n    roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the practice of cooking food has been advocated by several\r\neminent feeders, it has been condemned by others. Mr. Lawes is not\r\nfavorable to the cooking of food unless when it is scarce. The results\r\nof Colonel M'Douall's experiments go to prove that cattle can be more\r\neconomically kept upon a mixture of raw and cooked foods than upon\r\neither raw or cooked fodder given separately. One meal of cooked food\r\nand two feeds of raw turnips gave better results than three feeds of\r\nraw turnips; whilst two cooked feeds and a raw one resulted in a loss.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation of food, if not the best, is certainly the cheapest\r\nmode of preparing it. If the process be not pushed too far the loss of\r\nnutriment sustained is inconsiderable. When a mixture of straw and roots\r\nis fermented, the hard fibres of the latter are, to a great extent,\r\nbroken up, and the nutrient particles which they envelop are fully\r\nexposed to the action of the solvent juices of the stomach.\r\n\r\nA great advantage in cooking or fermenting food is that the most\r\nrubbishy materials can be used up. Indeed, as a general rule, the better\r\nsoft food is, the less the necessity for cooking it; but washed out hay\r\nand hard, over-ripened straw are of but little value, except when cooked\r\nand given in combination with some agreeably-flavored substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VALUE FOR FEEDING PURPOSES OF VARIOUS FOODS.[22]\r\n\r\n                  +--------------------------------------------------------+\r\n                  | KEY:                                                   |\r\n                  | A.--Starch, Sugar, &c.                                 |\r\n                  | B.--Oil, Starch, &c., computed as Oil.                 |\r\n                  | C.--Weight.                                            |\r\n                  | D.--Value.                                             |\r\n                  | E.--Value of Nitrogen, Phosphoric Acid, and Potash.    |\r\n                  | F.--Deduct Nitrogen for perspiration.                  |\r\n                  | G.--Net Value for Manure.                              |\r\n                  |                                                        |\r\n  +---------------+------------------+-------------------------------------+\r\n  |               |       COST.      | 100 LBS.

If straw must be used\r\nfor litter, let it be employed as economically as possible. Good\r\nsubstitutes, wholly or in part, for straw bedding may be found in\r\nsawdust, ashes, tan and ferns. Leaves of trees if procurable in\r\nquantity constitute an excellent litter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nTHE SHEEP.\r\n\r\nThe management of sheep varies greatly--depending upon the breeds of\r\nthe animal, the localities in which they are reared and fattened, and\r\nvarious economic conditions. The tupping season varies of course with\r\nthe country: in Ireland it commences about the middle of September and\r\nlasts for two months; in England and parts of Scotland, the season is\r\nabout a month earlier. The best kinds of sheep admit of being very early\r\nput to breed. Both ram and ewe are ready for this purpose when about\r\nfifteen months old. One ram is sufficient for about 80 ewes. The\r\nbreeding flock should be in a sound, healthy condition, and the ram\r\nought to be as near perfection as possible. The condition of the sire\r\nought to be good, but at the same time it is not desirable to have him\r\nover fat. The more striking indications of good health in the sheep are\r\ndry eyes, red gums, sound teeth, smooth, oily skin, and regular\r\nrumination. The color of the excreta should be natural.\r\n\r\n_Breeding Ewes._--After the tupping season, which generally lasts for\r\na month, the sheep are usually put on a pasture, which need not be\r\nvery rich. In cold situations ample shelter should be afforded to the\r\nbreeding flocks; and in severe weather they should, if possible, be\r\nremoved to sheds. When snow covers the ground, the animals must be\r\nsupplied with turnips, or cooked food of some kind. At such time a\r\nlittle oil-cake will be found very useful.\r\n\r\n_Yeaning._--In March the yeaning season sets in; and as this time\r\napproaches, the food of the animals should be improved, and the greatest\r\ncare must be taken of them. The shepherd should be unceasing in his\r\nwatchfulness, frequently examining every individual animal. The lambing,\r\nif possible, ought to take place in sheds, or some covered place.\r\n\r\n_Rearing of Lambs._--Delicate lambs require great care. Very weak ones\r\noften require to be hand fed. Should a mother die, her offspring may be\r\nplaced with another ewe; on the other hand, should a lamb perish, its\r\nmother may be appointed to rear one of another ewe's twins (if such\r\nbe available). The ram lambs, not intended for breeding purposes, are\r\nsubjected to a necessary mutilation when they are about three weeks old.\r\nIf this operation be performed later, there is great danger that fatal\r\ninflammatory action may set in; on the other hand, a lamb much younger\r\nthan three weeks is hardly strong enough to bear the pain of the\r\noperation. The tails of the lambs are shortened about the same time;\r\nbut it would be better in the case of the rams not to perform both\r\noperations on the same day. These operations are best performed during\r\nmoist or cloudy weather; if they must be done on frosty or stormy\r\ndays, the lambs should be kept under shelter for two or three days, as\r\notherwise the cold might induce inflammation. The lambs remain with\r\ntheir mothers for about four months, after which they are weaned, and\r\nput upon a good pasture. When the herbage is poor, oil-cake, say 1/4 lb.\r\ndaily, or some other nutritious food, should be used to supplement it.\r\nDuring the summer and part of the autumn the young stock, as a rule,\r\nsubsist upon grass; but many flock-masters give them other kinds of food\r\nin addition. As winter approaches, the young sheep on tillage farms\r\nreceive soft turnips, and sometimes a little hay or straw. The allowance\r\nof oil-cake may be increased to 1/2 lb., or if corn be cheap, it may be\r\nsubstituted for the oil-cake. After Christmas Swedish turnips are used.\r\n\r\nMr. Mechi gives the following information on the subject of rearing\r\nlambs during a season when roots are scarce:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Two hundred lambs, which cost 22s. 6d. each on September 12th,\r\n    were kept on leas and stubble until November 3rd, then on\r\n    turnips until December 19th, when fifty of them were drafted to\r\n    another flock getting a little cotton-cake. On the 3rd of February\r\n    fatting commenced with linseed-cake in addition to cut Swedes. On\r\n    the 7th of April the fifty tegs were put on rye with mangels, and\r\n    they were sold on the 4th of May at 61s. each.\r\n\r\n    The remaining 150 lambs were wintered as stores at little cost,\r\n    on inferior turnips uncut; they were put on rye from March 8th\r\n    till May 4th, when they were valued at 48s. each.\r\n\r\n    The district just referred to became so exhausted of its stock,\r\n    that at some of the later fairs the number of lambs and of ewes\r\n    exhibited was less than one-fourth of the average. But in Essex,\r\n    on six adjoining farms, including that from which I write, the\r\n    number of sheep wintered has been greater than these heavy lands\r\n    ever carried before. This has been effected by the extension of\r\n    a system of management often practised on heavy land, that of\r\n    eking out a scanty supply of green food by a liberal allowance\r\n    of straw, chaff, and grain; which happily were good in quality,\r\n    as well as plentiful and low in price in 1864.\r\n\r\n    By these means we were enabled last winter to keep 1,500 sheep\r\n    on about 650 acres of arable, and 350 acres of dry upland\r\n    pasture--chiefly park surrounding a mansion. The arable land\r\n    does not very well bear folding in winter, as a preparation for\r\n    spring corn. Neither climate nor soil are favorable to turnips,\r\n    and notwithstanding our efforts in assisting Nature, our crops\r\n    of turnips, rape, or Swedes, are never first-rate, and sometimes\r\n    very bad. Strong stubbles, good beans, clover-seed, and mangel,\r\n    are the specialities of the locality, and they indicate heavy\r\n    land, corn-growing, and yard-feeding. Sheep have been generally\r\n    \"conspicuous by their absence,\" though even the heavy-land farmer\r\n    is glad to winter a yard of them instead of cattle, that he may\r\n    keep some, at least, of the stock that pays best.\r\n\r\n    In the autumn of 1864 our root crops consisted of some white\r\n    turnips and rape, eaten by the ewes in September, and of a very\r\n    bad crop of mangel, the whole of which was reserved for the ewes\r\n    at lambing-time. In this predicament we wintered about 1,000\r\n    half-bred lambs, more than 400 ewes, and some fatting sheep.\r\n    All, except the fatting sheep, were folded on the stubbles, and\r\n    allowed a daily run on the park of about an hour for each flock.\r\n    The freshest grass was reserved for the ewes, and a very meagre\r\n    bite remained for the lambs; in fact, except for a few weeks\r\n    in autumn, the parks afforded them little or nothing except\r\n    exercise and water.\r\n\r\n    The flocks were divided between three separate farms, and their\r\n    food was prepared at the respective homesteads. The treatment\r\n    was in every respect similar; we shall therefore only notice in\r\n    detail the management at one farm.\r\n\r\n    The following details are taken from our \"Live Stock Book:\"--\r\n\r\n    EXTRACTS FROM STOCK BOOK.\r\n\r\n    _Lambs._\r\n\r\n    Payments.

When confined to roots, sheep,\r\non an average, consume about 26 lbs. daily, unless when under shelter,\r\nwhich diminishes the quantity by from five to ten per cent. Some sheep\r\non which Dr. Voelcker experimented were fed as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                 lbs.   ounces.\r\n\r\n  Mangel wurtzel                                  19    8\r\n  Chopped clover hay                               1      3/10\r\n  Linseed cake                                     0    4-8/100\r\n                                                  --------------\r\n                                       Total      20   15-38/100\r\n\r\nOn this diet four sheep were maintained from the 22nd of March until\r\nthe 10th of May, a period of forty-seven days. The weights were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                             22nd Mar.     10th May.      Gain.\r\n\r\n  No. 1                         153         170-1/2       17-1/2\r\n  No. 2                         134         151-1/2       17-1/2\r\n  No. 3                         170         187           17-1/2\r\n  No. 4                         136         155           19\r\n\r\nThis experiment shows that the sheep can increase in weight on a daily\r\nallowance of food, much less than is usually given to them; but it will\r\nbe found that growing sheep will usually consume a greater quantity of\r\nfood than that used by Dr. Voelcker's fattening animals.\r\n\r\nSheep washing is performed before the animal is shorn. It is a process\r\nwhich should never be neglected, as dirty wool is certain to bring a\r\nless price than the same quality would if clean. After being washed,\r\nsheep should be kept in dry pasture for about ten days in order to allow\r\nthe loss of yolk removed by the washing to be repaired; they will then\r\nbe in proper condition for the shearer.\r\n\r\n_Sheep Dips_ are used for the purpose of removing parasites from the\r\nanimal's skin. They often contain arsenic, or bichloride of mercury\r\n(corrosive sublimate), which are very objectionable ingredients. The\r\nglycerine sheep dip, prepared by Messrs. Hendrick and Guerin, of London,\r\nis a safe mixture, as it is free from mineral poisons, whilst the tar\r\nsubstances which it includes, act as a powerful cleanser of the skin,\r\nwithout injuriously affecting the yolk of the wool.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nTHE PIG.\r\n\r\nIn the breeding of pigs, as in the breeding of other kinds of stock,\r\ngreat care should be taken in the selection of both sire and dam. A good\r\npig should have a small head, short nose, plump cheek, a compact body,\r\nshort neck, and thin but very hairy skin, and short legs. The black\r\nbreed is considered to be more hardy than the white; and pure--all black\r\nor all white--colors as a rule indicate the purest blood.\r\n\r\nThe sow should not be bred from until she is a year old, and the boar\r\nespecially should not be employed at an earlier age. Although one boar\r\nis sometimes left with forty pigs and even a greater number, he will not\r\nbe able to serve more than a dozen about the same time, if vigorous\r\nprogeny be expected. The sow's regular period of gestation is 113 days;\r\nshe can have two litters a year, and in each there are from five to\r\nfourteen young. Moderate sized litters are the best, the young of very\r\nnumerous ones being often weakly. The best time to rear young pigs is\r\nduring the warm or mild parts of the year.\r\n\r\nDuring gestation the sow should be liberally fed, but not with excessive\r\namounts. The food at this time should rather excel in quality than in\r\nquantity; but so soon as she begins to nurse, her allowance must be\r\nincreased, and may be rendered more stimulating. For a week or so before\r\nfarrowing, the sow ought to be kept alone. Its sty should not be too\r\nsmall--not less than 8 or 10 feet square--for pigs require good air in\r\nabundance as well as other animals.\r\n\r\nThe straw used for litter should neither be too abundant nor too long;\r\nin the latter case some of the young might be covered by it, and\r\nescaping the notice of the sow, might unconsciously be crushed by the\r\nlatter. If the young are very feeble, it may become necessary to\r\nhand-feed them. Some sows eat their young: and when they have this\r\nhabit, the better plan is to cease breeding from them; for it appears to\r\nbe incurable. After parturition some bran and liquid or semi-liquid food\r\nshould be given to the sow.\r\n\r\n_Young Pigs_ subsist exclusively on their mother's milk but for a short\r\ntime. In two or three weeks they may receive skimmed or butter-milk from\r\nthe dairy. At a month old such of them as are not designed for breeding\r\npurposes may be subjected to the usual mutilations; and at from five to\r\nsix weeks old the young are weaned, and converted into _stores_.\r\n\r\n_Store Pigs_, when young, are best fed upon skimmed milk, oatmeal,\r\nand potatoes, in a cooked state. When they are approaching three months\r\nold, they may be supplied with raw food, if the weather be warm;\r\nbut in winter, cooked and warm food will be found the more economical.\r\nCabbages, roots, potatoes, and all kinds of grain that are cheap are\r\nused in pig feeding. The number of meals varies from six or seven in the\r\ncase of very young animals, to three in the case of those nearly ready\r\nfor fattening. Store pigs should be allowed a few hours' exercise daily\r\nin a paddock, or field, or at least in a large yard.\r\n\r\nThe dietaries of store pigs vary greatly, for these animals being\r\nomnivorous readily eat almost every kind of food. Mr. Baldwin, of Bredon\r\nHouse, near Birmingham, an extensive pig breeder, gave (in 1862) stores\r\nthe following allowance:--At three months old, a quart of peas, Egyptian\r\nbeans, or Indian corn. He considered English beans to be too _heating_\r\nfor young pigs. The animals were allowed the _run_ of a grass field.\r\nOn this diet the stores were kept until they were eight months old\r\n(increasing at the average rate of five pounds per week), after which\r\nthey were allowed an extra half-pint of corn. He calculated the weekly\r\ncost as follows:--Dry food, 1s.; grass, 2d.; man's time, 1d.; total, 1s.\r\n3d. These results yielded a profit of 1s. per week per pig, pork being\r\nat the time 6d. per lb. Some feeders give young store pigs half-a-pint\r\nof peas, mixed with pulped mangel, and the quantum of peas is gradually\r\nincreased to one pint per diem. All kinds of food-refuse from the house\r\nare welcomed by the pig. Skins, dripping, damaged potatoes, cabbage,\r\n&c., may be given to them; but they should not be altogether substituted\r\nfor the ordinary food-stuffs. Coal-dust, cinders, mortar rubbish, and\r\nsimilar substances are often swallowed by pigs, and sometimes even\r\ngiven to them by the feeder. In certain cases Lawes and Gilbert found\r\nthat superphosphate of lime was a useful addition to the food of pigs.\r\nA little salt should invariably be given, more especially if mangels\r\n(which are rich in salt) do not enter into the animals' dietary.\r\n\r\n_Fattening Pigs._--For some time before store pigs are put up to be\r\nfattened, the quality and quantity of their food should be increased,\r\nfor it is not economy to put a rather lean animal suddenly upon a very\r\nfattening diet. The sty should be well supplied with clean litter, and\r\nshould be darkened. Three feeds per diem will be a sufficient number,\r\nand the remains (if any) of one should be removed from the trough before\r\nthe fresh feed is put into it. The feeding trough (which should be made\r\nof iron) should be so constructed that the animals cannot place their\r\nfore feet in it. The pig is naturally a clean animal, and therefore\r\nit should be washed occasionally, as there is every reason to believe\r\nthat such a procedure will tend to promote the animal's health. It\r\nshould be supplied with clean water.\r\n\r\nIn Stephen's \"Book of the Farm,\" it is stated that two pecks of\r\nsteamed potatoes, and 9 lbs. of barley-meal, given every day to a pig\r\nweighing from 24 to 28 stones, will fatten it perfectly in nine weeks.\r\nBarley-meal is largely used in England as food for pigs. It is given\r\ngenerally in the form of a thin paste, and in large quantities. Lawes\r\nand Gilbert found that 1 cwt. of barley-meal given to pigs increased\r\ntheir weight by 22-1/2 lbs. Indian meal is fully equal, if it is not\r\nsuperior to barley-meal, as food for pigs; and for this purpose it is\r\nfar more extensively employed in Ireland. Every kind of grain given to\r\npigs should be ground and cooked. In Scotland pigs are often fattened\r\nsolely on from 28 to 35 lbs. of barley-meal weekly, and mangels or\r\nturnips _ad libitum_. Pollard is a good food for pigs, being rich in\r\nmuscle-forming materials; it is a good addition to very fatty or starchy\r\nfood. A mixture of pollard and palm-nut meal is an excellent fattening\r\nfood. Potatoes are now so dear, that they are seldom--unless the very\r\nworst and diseased kinds--used in pig feeding. They should never be\r\ngiven raw. The more inferior feeding-stuffs should be used up first in\r\nthe fattening of pigs, and the more valuable and concentrated kinds\r\nduring the latter part of the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE.\r\n\r\nThe horse is subject to many diseases, not a few of which arise from the\r\ndefective state of his stable. The best kinds of stables are large and\r\nlofty, well ventilated and drained, smoothly paved, and well provided\r\nwith means for admitting the direct sunlight. The walls should be\r\nwhitewashed occasionally, and for disinfecting and general sanitary\r\npurposes, four ounces of chloride of lime (bleaching powder) mixed with\r\neach bucket of whitewash, will be found extremely useful.\r\n\r\nFarm horses are kept in stalls, which should not be less than six feet\r\nwide, and (exclusive of rack and rere passage) 10 feet long. For hunters\r\nand thorough-breds, _loose boxes_ are now generally used.\r\n\r\nThe mare commences to breed at four years, and the period of gestation\r\nis 340 days. She may be worked until within a fortnight of the time at\r\nwhich parturition is expected to occur. After foaling, the mare should\r\nbe turned into a grass field (unless the weather is severe) and kept\r\nthere idly for three or four weeks.\r\n\r\n_Foals_ are kept with their mothers until they are about five or six\r\nmonths old: after weaning, their food must be tender and nutritious--well\r\nbruised oats, cut hay, bean or oatmeal mashes; carrots are very\r\nsuitable.\r\n\r\nWorking horses are fed chiefly upon oats and hay, which undoubtedly are\r\nthe best foods for these animals, both being rich in muscle-forming\r\nmaterials. Bruised oats are far more economical than the whole grains:\r\nand if the animals eat too rapidly, that habit is easily overcome by\r\nmixing chopped straw or hay with the grain.\r\n\r\nAccording to Playfair, a horse not working can subsist and remain in\r\nfair condition on a daily allowance of 12 lbs. of hay and 5 lbs. of\r\noats. According to the same authority, a working horse should receive\r\n14 lbs. of hay, 12 lbs. of oats, and 2 lbs. of beans.\r\n\r\nBeans are a very concentrated food, rich in flesh-formers, and are,\r\ntherefore, well adapted for sustaining hard-working horses. They are\r\nrather _binding_; but this property is easily neutralised by combining\r\nthe beans with some laxative food. Turnips, carrots, furze, and various\r\nother foods are given to the horse, often in large quantities. The\r\nfollowing are some among the many dietaries on which this animal\r\nis kept:--\r\n\r\nProfessor Low's formula is, 30 to 35 lbs. of a mixture of equal parts\r\nof chopped straw, chopped hay, bruised grain, and steamed potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe daily rations of horses of the London Omnibus Company, are 16 lbs.\r\nof bruised oats, 7-1/2 lbs. of cut hay, and 2-1/2 lbs. of chopped straw.\r\n\r\nStage coach-horses in the United States receive daily about 19 lbs. of\r\nIndian meal and 13 lbs. of cut hay.\r\n\r\nMr. Robertson, of Clandeboye, near Belfast, gives the following\r\ninformation on the subject of horse-keeping:--\r\n\r\n    The year we divide into three periods--October, November to\r\n    May inclusive, June to September inclusive. During the first\r\n    period, the horses get about 18 lb. of chaff and 12 lb. of\r\n    crushed oats and beans; \"10-1/2 oats and 1-1/2 beans\" per head\r\n    per day. During the second period they get about 15 lb. of hay\r\n    chaff, 12 lb. of crushed oats and beans, and about 3 gallons\r\n    of boiled turnips per head per day. During the third period\r\n    they were turned out to graze during the night. In the day time,\r\n    whilst in the stable, each animal is allowed about 50 lb. of cut\r\n    clover, and about 12 lb. of crushed oats and beans per day. The\r\n    feeding is all under the charge of one person. He uses his own\r\n    discretion in feeding the animals, though he is not allowed to\r\n    exceed the quantities named. The horses to which I allude are the\r\n    same on which the experiments commenced two years ago--six cart\r\n    horses, one cart pony, and one riding horse. From Sept. 1, 1865,\r\n    to and including August 31, 1866, the cost of maintaining these\r\n    horses in good working condition; keeping the carts, harness,\r\n    &c., in repair; shoeing, c., was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Oats, 14 tons, at 16s. per cwt.

I would only\r\n    add, in conclusion, that the horses are kept in good working\r\n    condition; and, as a proof of their good health under this\r\n    system, I may state that during the past two years we have not\r\n    had occasion to require the services of a veterinary surgeon.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusty hay or straw should not be given to horses. Furze is said to be\r\na heating food; but it is very nutritious, and when young, may be given\r\nas _part_ of the food of the horse.\r\n\r\nBoiled turnips and mangels are often given in winter; but they are\r\nnot sufficiently nutritious to constitute a substantial portion of the\r\nanimal's diet. Oil-cake is occasionally given to horses; but seldom in\r\nlarger quantities than 1-1/2 lbs. per diem. On the whole, experience is\r\nin favor of occasionally giving cooked food to horses; and the practice\r\nmeets with the full approval of the veterinarian. To most kinds of food\r\nfor horses, the addition of one or two ounces of salt is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the _Agricultural Gazette_ for November 25, 1865, the following\r\ninstructive tables are given:--\r\n\r\n  STABLE FEEDING DURING AUTUMN.\r\n\r\n  ---+-------------------------+---------+---------+------+-----------+------\r\n     | Name and Address        |         |         |      | Clover,   |Weekly\r\n  No.| of Authorities.         |  Hay.   |  Oats.  |Beans.|   &c.     | Cost.\r\n  ---+-------------------------+---------+---------+------+-----------+------\r\n     |                         |  lb.    |  lb.    | lb.  |           | s. d.\r\n     |                         |         |         |      |           |\r\n   1 | W.

I begin in September, and continue using\r\n    them all winter and until late in the summer, nearly, if not quite,\r\n    all the year round, beginning, however, with smaller quantities,\r\n    about a peck, and then half a bushel, the first week or two, as too\r\n    many of the young-growing mangel would not suit the stock. I believe\r\n    pulped mangels, with chaff, are the best, cheapest, and most healthy\r\n    food horses can eat. I always find my horses miss them when I have\r\n    none, late in the summer. I give them fresh ground every day. Young\r\n    store beasts, colts, &c., do well with them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Five pounds of linseed will make about seven gallons of\r\ngruel, and suffice for five good-sized calves; considerable allowance\r\nmust, however, be made for differences of quality in the linseed, that\r\nfrom India not being gelatinous enough, and therefore boiling hard,\r\ninstead of \"coming down kindly.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: \"Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society,\" vol. xxxix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: From Mr. Horsfall's Essay on Dairy Management, in \"Journal\r\nof Royal Agricultural Society,\" vol. xviii., part i.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nMEAT, MILK, AND BUTTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nMEAT.\r\n\r\nNo one ought to feel a greater interest in the subject of meat in\r\nall its branches than the stock feeder. Just in proportion as this\r\nkind of food is agreeable to the taste, easily digestible, and rich in\r\nnutriment, will the demand for it increase. The quality of meat is, in\r\nfact, a primary consideration with the producer of that article; and he\r\nwhose beef and mutton are the most tender and the best flavored will\r\nmake the most profit.\r\n\r\n_Quality of Meat._--The flesh of herbivorous animals is composed of\r\nmuscular and adipose (fatty) tissues. The muscles consist of bundles of\r\nelastic fibres (_fibrine_), enclosed in an albuminous tissue formed of\r\nlittle vessels, termed cells, and intimately commingled with water, and\r\na mixture of albuminous, fatty, and saline matters. The leanest flesh\r\n(muscles) contains fat, but the latter accumulates in certain parts of\r\nthe body--often to such an extent as to seriously interfere with the\r\nfunctions of life. The red color of flesh is due to a rather large\r\nproportion of blood, which it contains in minute vessels; and the slight\r\nacidity of its juice is owing to the presence of _inosinic_ acid, and\r\nprobably of several other acids. The agreeable odour of meat, when it\r\nis subjected to the process of cooking, is developed from a complex\r\nsubstance termed _osmazome_.[23] This constituent varies in nature and\r\nquantity in the different animals--hence the variety in flavor and odour\r\nof their flesh--and its amount increases with the age of the animal.\r\nThe albumen of the muscles, and their fatty and saline constituents,\r\nare digestible; but it is generally believed that the elastic fibres,\r\nand the horny cellular tissue which binds them into bundles, are not\r\nassimilable. It is more certain that the crystalline substances found in\r\nflesh, such as, for example, _kreatine_, are incapable of ministering to\r\nthe nutrition of animals.\r\n\r\nThe composition of flesh varies very much--that of a very obese pig\r\ncontaining more than half its weight of fat, whilst in some specimens\r\nof \"jerked beef,\" imported from Monte Video, scarcely 5 per cent. of\r\nthat substance was found. The flesh of a fat ox has on an average the\r\nfollowing composition:--\r\n\r\n                                                 Per cent.\r\n\r\n  Water                                             45\r\n  Fatty substances                                  35\r\n  Lean flesh, or muscle                             15\r\n  Mineral matters                                    5\r\n                                                   ---\r\n            Total                                  100\r\n\r\nI have examined for Dr. Morgan several specimens of the corned beef\r\nrecently prepared in South America, by \"Morgan's process.\" The following\r\nwere the average results of three analyses:--\r\n\r\n                                                 Per cent.\r\n\r\n  Water                                             40\r\n  Fatty matters                                     21\r\n  Lean, or muscular flesh                           27\r\n  Mineral matters (chiefly common salt)             12\r\n                                                   ---\r\n            Total                                  100\r\n\r\nIt may not here be out of place to direct attention to the composition\r\nof a kind of animal food extensively purchased by the poorer classes,\r\nand known under the term of slink veal. It is the flesh of calves that\r\nare killed on the first day of their existence, and also, I have reason\r\nto believe, that of very immature animals--of calves that have never\r\nbreathed. The flesh is of a very loose texture naturally, and is still\r\nfurther puffed out by air, which is usually supplied from the lungs of\r\nthe operator. This kind of meat, though regarded as a delicacy by some\r\npeople, is not held in much estimation, otherwise its price would be\r\nhigher than it is. It is at present sold at about 4d. or 5d. per pound,\r\nsometimes even at a lower rate. Apart from the disgusting process of\r\n\"blowing\" veal, so generally adopted, the use of this food is extremely\r\nobjectionable, owing to its great tendency to produce diarrhoea. To\r\nthe truth of this assertion every physician who has studied the subject\r\nof dietetics can testify. I have analysed a specimen of it (purchased\r\nfrom a person who admitted that it was part of a calf a day old), and\r\nobtained the following results:--\r\n\r\n100 parts contain--\r\n\r\n                                                Per cent.\r\n\r\n  Water                                          72.25\r\n  Fat                                             6.17\r\n  Lean flesh                                     18.46\r\n  Mineral matter                                  3.12\r\n                                                ------\r\n  Total                                         100.00\r\n\r\nI believe that a large portion of the lean flesh is indigestible; and\r\naltogether I may safely say of this kind of meat that it is, especially\r\nduring the prevalence of cholera, an unsafe article of diet. Of course\r\nthese observations do not apply to _fed_ veal, the only kind which\r\nrespectable butchers, as a rule, offer for sale.\r\n\r\nYoung meat is richer in soluble albumen and poorer in fibrine and\r\nfat than the matured flesh of the same animal. The flesh of the goat\r\ncontains _hircic_ acid, which renders it almost uneatable, but this\r\nsubstance is either altogether absent from, or present but in minute\r\nproportion in, the well-flavored meat of the kid. The flesh of game\r\ncontains abundance of osmazome, a substance which is somewhat deficient\r\nin that of the domestic fowl.\r\n\r\nOwing to the marked individuality which man exhibits in the selection of\r\nhis food, and to the intimate relationship subsisting between food and\r\nthe organism it nourishes, it is impossible to arrange the alimental\r\nsubstances in the strict order of their nutritive values. You can bring\r\na horse to the water, but you cannot compel him to drink it; you can\r\nswallow any kind of food you please, but you cannot force your stomach\r\nto digest it. It is, therefore, vain to tell a man that a certain kind\r\nof food is shown by chemical analysis to be nutritious, when his stomach\r\ntells him unmistakeably that it is poisonous, and refuses to digest it.\r\nIn the matter of dietetics Nature is a safer guide than the chemist.\r\nMany substances, when viewed only in the light shed upon them by\r\nchemical analysis, appear to be rich in the elements of nutrition, yet\r\nwhen they are introduced into the stomachs of certain individuals, they\r\ndisarrange the digestive organs, and sometimes cause the whole system to\r\ngo out of order. Every day we see exemplified the truth of the proverb,\r\nthat \"one man's meat is another man's poison.\" There are persons who\r\nrelish and readily digest fat pork, and yet they cannot eat a single\r\negg with impunity; others enjoy and easily assimilate eggs, but their\r\nstomachs cannot tolerate a particle of fat bacon.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely the composition of an aliment and its adaptability to\r\nthe organism which determine its nutritive value--its digestibility\r\nand flavor are points which affect it. There are few people in these\r\ncountries who are disposed to quarrel with beef; but no one would\r\nprefer the leg of an elderly milch cow to the sirloin of a well-fed\r\nthree-year-old bullock: yet if our selection were to be determined by\r\nthe analysis of the two kinds of beef, we would be just as likely to\r\nprefer the one as the other. No doubt the relative tenderness of meats\r\nmay be ascertained by experiments conducted _outside_ the body; but\r\ntenderness is not in every case synonymous with easy digestibility.\r\nVeal contains more soluble albumen, and is, consequently, far more\r\ntender than beef; yet, as every one knows, it is less digestible. It is\r\ncurious that maturity renders the flesh of some animals more digestible,\r\nand that of others less digestible. Flavor has something to do with\r\nthese differences. Beef is richer than veal in the agreeably flavorous\r\nosmazome, and the flesh of the kid is destitute of the disagreeable\r\nodour of the fully-developed goat. The superiority of wild-fowl over the\r\ndomesticated birds is solely owing to the finer flavor of their flesh.\r\n\r\nThe habits of animals, and the nature of their food, affect the\r\nquality of their flesh. Exercise increases the amount of osmazome, and\r\nconsequently renders the meat more savory. The mutton of Wicklow, Wales,\r\nand other mountainous regions is remarkably sweet, because the animals\r\nthat furnish it are almost as nimble as goats, and skip from crag to\r\ncrag in quest of their food. The fatty mutton, with pale muscle, which\r\nis so abundant in our markets, is furnished by very young animals forced\r\nprematurely into full development. Those animals have abundance of food\r\nplaced within easy reach; their muscular activity is next to _nil_,\r\nand the result is, that their flesh contains less than its natural\r\nproportion of savory ingredients. It is the same with all other animals.\r\nThe flesh of the tame rabbit is very insipid, whilst that of the wild\r\nvariety is well flavored. Wild fowls cooped up, and rapidly fattened,\r\nlose their characteristic flavor; and when the domesticated birds become\r\nwild their flesh becomes less fatty, and acquires all the peculiarities\r\nof game. Ducks, whether wild or tame, ordinarily yield goodly meat;\r\nbut the flesh of some of those that feed on fish smacks strongly of\r\ncod-liver oil. Birds which subsist partly on aromatic berries assimilate\r\nthe odour as well as the nutriment of their food. The flesh of grouse\r\nhas very commonly a slight flavor of heather. Foster states that in\r\nTahiti pigs are fed upon fruit, which renders their fat very bland and\r\ntheir flesh like veal. Animals subjected to certain kinds of mutilation\r\nfatten more rapidly than they do in their natural state. Capons increase\r\nin weight more rapidly than cocks, poulards than hens, bullocks than\r\nbulls, and cows deprived of their ovaries than perfect cows. Why it is\r\nthat the flesh of mutilated animals should be fatter and more tender\r\nthan that of whole animals, we know not; we only know that such is the\r\nfact. The hunting of animals renders their flesh more tender; the cause\r\nassigned is, that the great exertion of the muscles liquefies their\r\nfibrine, which is the toughest of their constituents. The meat of\r\nanimals brought very early to maturity is seldom so valuable as the\r\nnaturally developed article. Lawes and Gilbert state that portions of\r\na sheep that had been fattened upon _steeped_ barley and mangels, and\r\nwhich gave a very rapid increase, yielded several per cent. less of\r\ncooked meat, and lost more, both in dripping and by the evaporation of\r\nwater, than the corresponding portions of a sheep which had been fed\r\nupon _dry_ barley and mangels, and which gave only about half the\r\namount of gross increase within the same period of time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the digestibility and flavor of meat (and of every other kind\r\nof food) affect its nutritive value, these points are in general of far\r\nless importance than its composition. Potatoes are not so nutritious as\r\npeas, because they contain a smaller amount of fat and flesh-formers;\r\nbut they are more digestible. Fish contains less solid matter than\r\nflesh, and is less nutritious, yet a cut of turbot will be, in general,\r\nmore easily digested than an equal weight of old beef. The fact is, that\r\ndigestibility and flavor are only of great importance to dyspeptic\r\npersons. In the healthy digestive organs a pound weight of (dry) food\r\nof inferior flavor and slow digestibility will be just as useful as the\r\nsame weight of well-flavored and easily assimilable aliment, provided\r\nall other conditions be alike. If the food be eaten with a relish, and\r\ntolerated by the stomach, its digestibility will not, except in extreme\r\ncases, affect in a very sensible degree its nutritiveness.\r\n\r\nWere one question in animal nutrition satisfactorily answered, it\r\nwould then be comparatively easy to arrange aliments in the order of\r\ntheir nutritive value. That question is--What are the proper relative\r\nproportions of the fat-forming and flesh-forming constituents of our\r\nfood? It is constantly urged, that the food of the Irish peasantry\r\ncontains an excess of the fat-forming materials in relation to the\r\nmuscle-forming substances; and the remedy suggested is, that their\r\nstaple article of food--potatoes--should be supplemented with flesh,\r\npeas, and such like substances, in which, it is supposed, the elements\r\nof nutrition are more fairly balanced. In potatoes, the proportion of\r\nfat-formers (calculated as fat) is about five times as much as that\r\nof the flesh-formers; but these principles exist in the same relative\r\nproportions in the fat bacon with which the potato-eater loves\r\nto supplement his bulky food. In bread we find the proportion of\r\nfat-formers to be only 2-1/2 times as much as that of the flesh-formers,\r\nwhilst, according to Lawes and Gilbert, the edible portion of the\r\ncarcass of a fat sheep contains 6-1/2 times as much fat as nitrogenous\r\n(flesh-forming) compounds. It is evident, then, that meat such as, for\r\nexample, the beef recently imported from Monte Video, from which the\r\nfatty elements of nutrition are almost completely absent, cannot be\r\na suitable adjunct to a farinaceous food.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to prove that in the animal food consumed by the\r\npopulation of these countries, the proportion of fatty to nitrogenous\r\nmatters is greater than in the seeds of cereal and leguminous plants,\r\nand but little less than in potatoes. \"It would appear to be\r\nunquestionable,\" say Lawes and Gilbert, \"therefore, that the influence\r\nof our staple _animal foods_, to supplement our otherwise mainly\r\nfarinaceous diet, is, on the large scale, to _reduce_, and _not to\r\nincrease_, the relation of the _assumed_ flesh-forming material to the\r\nmore peculiarly respiratory and fat-forming capacity, so to speak, of\r\nthe food consumed.\" It must be remembered, too, that the fat _formers_\r\nare ready _formed_ in animal food, whereas they exist chiefly in the\r\nform of starch, gum, sugar, and such-like substances in vegetables.\r\nAccording to theory, 2-1/2 parts of starch are equivalent to, _i.e._,\r\nconvertible into, 1 part of fat; but it is not certain whether the force\r\nwhich effects this change is derivable from the 2-1/2 parts of starch,\r\nor from the destruction of tissue, or of another portion of food. If\r\nthere be a tax on the system in order to convert starch into fat, it\r\nis evident that 2-1/2 parts of starch, though convertible into, are not\r\nequivalent in nutritive value to one part of fat.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that millions of healthy, vigorous men have\r\nsubsisted for years exclusively on potatoes; but it is no less clear\r\nthat a diet of meat and potatoes enables the laborer to work harder\r\nand longer than if his food were composed solely of potatoes. But we\r\nhave seen that the relation between the flesh-forming and fat-forming\r\nelements is nearly the same in both potatoes and meat; so that the\r\nsuperiority of a meat or mixed diet cannot be chiefly owing, contrary to\r\nthe generally received opinion, to a greater abundance of flesh-forming\r\nmaterials. As the proportion of flesh-formers to fat-formers is so much\r\ngreater in wheaten or oaten bread than in potatoes, and as peas and\r\nother vegetables rich in nitrogenous compounds are practically found to\r\nbe an excellent supplement to potatoes, it is probable that the latter\r\nmay be somewhat relatively deficient in flesh-forming capacity. It is,\r\nhowever, in all probability the great bulk of a potato diet, and its\r\ntotal want of ready formed fat, that render the addition to it of animal\r\nfood so very desirable. The concentrated state in which the ingredients\r\nof flesh exist, the intimate way in which they are intermixed, their\r\nagreeable flavor, and their (in general) ready and almost complete\r\ndigestibility, appear to be the principal points in which a meat diet\r\nexcels a vegetable regimen. There may be others, which, though less\r\nevident, are, perhaps, of equal importance. At all events, the general\r\nexperience of mankind testifies to the superiority of a mixed animal\r\nand vegetable diet over a purely vegetable one.\r\n\r\n_Is very Fat Meat wholesome?_--The enormous and rapidly increasing\r\ndemand for meat which characterises the food markets of these days,\r\nhas reacted in a remarkable manner upon the nature of the animals that\r\nsupply it. Formerly the animals that furnished pork, mutton, and beef,\r\nwere allowed to attain the age of three years old and upwards before\r\nthey were considered to be \"ripe\" for the butcher; but now sheep and pigs\r\nare perfectly _matured_ at the early age of one year, and two-year-old\r\noxen furnish a large quota of the \"roast beef of old England.\" The\r\nso-called improvement of stock is simply the forcing of them into an\r\nunnatural degree of fatness at an early age; and this end is attained\r\nby dexterous selection and crossing of breeds, by avoidance of cold, by\r\ndiminishing as much as possible their muscular activity, and lastly,\r\nand chiefly, by over-feeding them with concentrated aliments.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that a man so obese as to be unable to walk cannot be\r\nin a healthy state; yet many feeders of stock look upon the monstrously\r\nfat bulls and cows of cattle show prize celebrity as normal types of the\r\nbovine tribe. It requires but little argument to refute so fallacious\r\na notion. No doubt it is desirable to encourage the breeding of those\r\nvarieties of animals which exhibit the greatest disposition to fatten,\r\nand to arrive early at maturity; but the forcing of individual animals\r\ninto an unnatural state of obesity, except for purely experimental\r\npurposes, is a practice which cannot be too strongly deprecated. If\r\nbreeders contented themselves with handing over to the butcher their\r\nhuge living blocks of fat, the matter would not perhaps be very serious;\r\nbut, unfortunately, it is too often the practice to turn them to account\r\nas sires and dams. Were I a judge at a cattle show, I certainly should\r\ndisqualify every extremely fat animal entered for competition amongst\r\nthe breeding stock. Unless parents are healthy and vigorous, their\r\nprogeny are almost certain to be unhealthy and weakly; and it is\r\ninconceivable that an extremely obese bull and an unnaturally fat cow\r\ncould be the progenitors of healthy offspring. We should by all means\r\nimprove our live stock; but we should be careful not to overdo the\r\nthing. If we must have gaily-decked ponderous bulls and cows at our fat\r\ncattle exhibitions, let us condemn to speedy immolation those unhappy\r\nvictims to a most absurd fashion; but in the name of common sense let\r\nus leave the perpetuation of the species to individuals in a normal\r\nstate, whose muscles are not replaced by fat, whose hearts are not\r\nhypertrophied, and whose lungs are capable of effectively performing\r\nthe function of respiration.\r\n\r\nMr. Gant, in a small volume[24] devoted wholly to the subject, describes\r\nthe serious functional and structural disarrangements which over-feeding\r\nproduces in stock. He found the heart of a one-year old Southdown\r\nwether, fattened according to the _high-pressure system_, to be little\r\nmore than a mass of fat. In several other young, but so-called \"matured\"\r\nsheep, he found more or less fatty degeneration of the heart, and\r\nextensively spread disease of the liver and of the lungs. A four-year\r\nold Devon heifer, exhibited by the late Prince Consort at a Smithfield\r\nshow, was found to be in a highly diseased state. It was slaughtered,\r\nand of course its flesh sold at a high price as \"prize beef,\" but its\r\ninternal organs came into Mr. Gant's possession. The substance of both\r\nventricles of the heart had undergone all but complete conversion into\r\nfat; one of its muscles was broken up, and many of the fibres of the\r\nothers were ruptured. In another animal the muscular fibres of the\r\nheart had given way to so great an extent that if the thin lining\r\nmembrane (_endocardium_) had burst, death would have instantly ensued.\r\nThe slightest exertion was likely to cause this catastrophe; but,\r\nfortunately enough in this case, the animal was not capable of exertion,\r\nfor though under three years of age, it weighed upwards of 200 stones:\r\nthis animal had received for some time before its exhibition, the\r\nliberal allowance of 21 lbs. of oil-cake (besides other food) per diem.\r\n\"A pen of three pigs,\" says Mr. Gant, \"belonging to his Royal Highness\r\nthe Prince Consort, happened to be placed in a favorable light for\r\nobservation, and I particularly noticed their condition. They lay\r\nhelpless on their sides, with their noses propped up against each\r\nother's backs, as if endeavouring to breathe more easily, but their\r\nrespiration was loud, suffocating, and at long intervals. Then you heard\r\na short catching snore, which shook the whole body of the animal, and\r\npassed with the motion of a wave over its fat surface, which, moreover,\r\nfelt cold. I thought how much the heart under such circumstances must\r\nbe laboring to propel the blood through the lungs and throughout the\r\nbody. The gold medal pigs of Mr. Moreland were in a similar condition,\r\nif anything, worse; for they snored and gasped for breath, their mouths\r\nbeing opened, as well as their nostrils dilated, at each inspiration.\r\nFrom a pig we only expect a grunt, but not a snore. These animals,\r\nonly twelve months and ten days old, were marked '_improved_ Chilton\r\nbreed.' They, with their fellows just mentioned, of eleven months and\r\ntwenty-three days, had early come to grief. Three pigs of the black\r\nbreed were in a similar state, at seven months three weeks and five\r\ndays, yet such animals 'the judges highly commended.'\"\r\n\r\nDr. Brinton denies the accuracy of several of Mr. Gant's statements\r\nrelative to the structural changes in the muscles of obese animals;\r\nbut I do not think that he has succeeded in disproving the principal\r\nassertions made by the latter.\r\n\r\nThere is conclusive evidence to prove that one of the effects of the\r\npresent mode of fattening beasts is disease of the internal organs\r\nof the animals; but it is by no means certain that the flesh of those\r\ndiseased animals is as unwholesome food as some writers assert it to\r\nbe. The flesh of an over-fattened animal differs from that of a lean, or\r\nmoderately fat one, in containing an exceedingly high proportion of fat;\r\nbut it has not been proved that the fat of prize animals differs from\r\nthe fat of lean kine, or that it is less wholesome or nutritious. Be the\r\nflesh of those exceedingly fat animals unwholesome or not, there are\r\nthousands, ay, millions of persons, to whom its greasy quality renders\r\nit peculiarly acceptable; and as for those who dislike fat--they do\r\nnot usually invest their money in the flesh of prize sheep or oxen.\r\nAt the same time, it must not be understood that all, or even a large\r\nproportion of fully matured stock is in a diseased state; though in most\r\nof them the vital and muscular powers are undoubtedly exceedingly low.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that sheep and oxen, from three to five years old,\r\nmoderately fat, and fairly exercising their locomotive powers, furnish\r\nthe most savory, and, perhaps, the most nutritious meat: but if such\r\nwere the only kind of meat in demand, it may be fairly doubted that the\r\nsupply would be equal to it. The produce of meat in these countries has\r\nbeen rapidly increasing for many years past; and the weight of meat\r\nannually supplied from a given area of land is now from 80 to 100 per\r\ncent. greater than it furnished thirty or forty years ago. It is chiefly\r\nby means of the so-called forcing system that the produce of meat has\r\nbeen so considerably increased. If this system were abandoned, the\r\nproduction would be greatly diminished, and the consequently high price\r\nof the article would place it beyond the reach of the masses of the\r\npopulation. Besides, it has not been proved that the flesh of the\r\nanimals brought early to maturity is much inferior, except somewhat in\r\nflavor, to the meat of three-year-old beasts. There is, no doubt, plenty\r\nof unwholesome meat offered for sale, but it is that of animals which\r\nwere affected by diseases as likely to attack the young as the old. On\r\nthe whole, then, we may say of the improved system of fattening stock,\r\nthat it produces a maximum amount of meat on a given area of land; that\r\nthe meat so produced is, except in rare cases, perfectly wholesome; that\r\nit is capable of supplying the ingredient--fat--which is almost wholly\r\nabsent from a vegetable diet; and, finally, that it places animal food\r\nwithin the reach of the working classes.\r\n\r\n_Diseased Meat._--The losses occasioned to stockowners by the diseases\r\nof live stock are far greater than is generally supposed. It has been\r\ncalculated that in the six years ending 1860, the value of the horned\r\nstock lost by disease amounted to L25,934,650. Pleuro-pneumonia was the\r\nchief cause of these losses. Exclusive of the enormous losses occasioned\r\nby the ravages of the rinderpest, the annual loss by disease in live\r\nstock in these countries for some years past cannot be much under\r\nL6,000,000 sterling.\r\n\r\nWhether it is owing to the somewhat abnormal condition under which the\r\ndomesticated animals are placed, or to causes which operate upon them\r\nwhen in a state of nature, it is certain that they are remarkably prone\r\nto disease. It is extremely difficult to get a horse six years old that\r\nis not a roarer or a whistler, or \"weak on his pins,\" or in some way or\r\nother unsound. Oxen, sheep, and pigs have almost as many maladies\r\nafflicting them as human flesh is heir to, notwithstanding the short\r\nperiod of life which they are permitted to enjoy.\r\n\r\nIt is a very serious question whether or not the flesh of animals that\r\nhave been killed while they are in a diseased condition is injurious to\r\nhealth. The opinions on this point are conflicting, but the majority of\r\nmedical men believe that the flesh of diseased animals is not wholesome.\r\nThere are certain maladies which obviously render meat unsaleable, by\r\ncausing a sensible alteration in its quality. For example, blackleg\r\nin cattle and measles in the porcine tribe render the flesh of these\r\nanimals, as a general rule, unmarketable, or nearly so. But there are\r\nvery serious diseases--often proving rapidly fatal--which, whilst\r\nseriously affecting certain internal organs, do not palpably deteriorate\r\nthe quality of the flesh. In such cases are we to rely upon the evidence\r\nof our mere senses in judging of the wholesomeness of the meat? If we\r\nfind beef possessing a good color and odour, and firm to the touch, and\r\n_appearing_ to be in every respect healthy flesh, are we under such\r\ncircumstances to take it for granted that it must be healthy? This is a\r\nvery important question, involving as it does the interests of both the\r\nproducers and consumers of animal food. If the flesh of all diseased\r\nanimals be unwholesome, a very large number of oxen now sold whilst\r\nlaboring under pleuro-pneumonia should not be sent into the market.\r\nThis, of course, would be a heavy loss to the stockowner, but a still\r\nheavier one to the meat consumer; because, if there were fewer animals\r\nfor sale, the price of meat would ascend, in obedience to the law of\r\nsupply and demand. The whole question is, then, well worthy of being\r\nconsidered in the most careful, unbiassed, and scientific manner; for\r\nat present it is in a state which is the reverse of being satisfactory.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the animals conducted to the shambles is in a\r\ndiseased condition. Professor Gamgee estimates it at no less than\r\none-fifth. Dr. Letheby, food analyst to the Corporation of London,\r\ncondemns weekly about 2,000 pounds weight of flesh; but as his\r\njurisdiction is limited to the \"City,\" which contains a population of\r\nonly about 114,000, the 2,000 pounds of diseased meat are probably only\r\nabout 1-30th of the quantity exposed for sale within the whole area of\r\nthe metropolis. Making an estimate of the most moderate kind, we may\r\nassume that 30,000 pounds weight of bad meat are weekly offered for\r\nsale in London--_three million pounds weight annually_.\r\n\r\nMany persons have been affected with dysentery and choleraic symptoms\r\nafter partaking of butcher's meat of apparently the most healthy kind.\r\nThe meat has often been subjected to minute chemical and microscopical\r\nexamination, but no poison has been discovered. But these cases are\r\nbecoming so frequent that they are exciting uneasiness, and demand an\r\nexhaustive investigation. The unskilful persons who officiate in the\r\ncapacity of \"clerks of the market\" and inspectors of meat can only judge\r\nof the quality of flesh that is obviously inferior to the eye, nose, or\r\ntouch; but are there not cases where the flesh may appear to be good,\r\nand yet contain some subtle malign principle? It is an ascertained fact\r\nthat young or \"slink\" veal very frequently gives rise to diarrhoea,\r\nmore especially when that disease is epidemic. Dr. Parkes, in his\r\ncelebrated work on Hygiene, page 162 (second edition), states that\r\n\"the flesh of the pig sometimes produced diarrhoea--a fact I have had\r\noccasion to notice in a regiment in India, and which has often been\r\nnoticed by others. The flesh is, probably, affected by the unwholesome\r\ngarbage on which the pig feeds.\" Menschell states that 44 persons were\r\nafflicted with anthrax after eating the flesh of oxen affected with\r\ncarbuncular fever. Dr. Kesteren, in the _Medical Times_ for March, 1864,\r\nmentions a case where twelve persons were affected with choleraic\r\nsymptoms after the use of pork not obviously diseased. At Newtownards,\r\ncounty of Down, several persons died after eating veal in which no\r\npoisonous matter of any kind could be detected. One instance has come\r\nunder my own notice where a man, two dogs, and a pig died after eating\r\nthe flesh of an animal killed whilst suffering from splenic apoplexy.\r\nSeveral butchers have lost their lives in consequence of the blood of\r\ndiseased animals being allowed to come in contact with abrasions or\r\nrecently received wounds on their arms. The flesh of over-driven animals\r\nis stated by Professor Gamgee to produce a most serious skin disease,\r\nalthough the meat appeared to be perfectly healthy. The Belgian Academy\r\nof Medicine has decided that the flesh of animals suffering from\r\ncarbuncular fever is unwholesome, and its sale in that country is\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\nMany persons have died in Germany and a few in England from a disease\r\nproduced by eating pork containing a small internal parasite termed\r\n_trichina spiralis_. I have recently met with a case of _trichiniasis_\r\nin the human subject. The body of the unfortunate person--who had\r\nbeen an inmate of the South Dublin Union Workhouse--was found to\r\ncontain thousands of the trichinae. In Iceland a large proportion of\r\nthe population suffers from a parasitic disease traceable to the use\r\nof the flesh of sheep and cattle in which flukes abound.\r\n\r\nPleuro-pneumonia is in this country the disease which most frequently\r\naffects the ox. It is probable that about 5 per cent. of these animals\r\nsold in Dublin are more or less affected by this malady. There are two\r\nforms of pleuro-pneumonia--the sporadic, or indigenous, and the foreign,\r\nor contagious. It is the latter form which has become the scourge of the\r\nox tribe in this country, though unknown here until the year 1841, when\r\nit appeared as an epizooetic, and carried off vast numbers of animals.\r\n\r\nThe contagious pleuro-pneumonia is an extremely severe inflammatory\r\ndisease, and is produced--not in the same way that common pleuro-pneumonia\r\nis, by exposure to excessive cold, &c.--but by a blood poison received\r\nfrom an infected animal. In the congestive stage of the disease there is\r\nno structural alteration in the organs of the animal, and if well bled\r\nits flesh might (probably) be safely eaten; but when a large portion of\r\nthe lungs becomes solidified, and rendered incapable of purifying the\r\nblood, is it not doubtful, to say the least, that the blood or flesh is\r\nperfectly wholesome? The blood, during the life of the animal, is in a\r\nstate of fermentation; there is extreme fever, and the animal presents\r\nall the characteristic symptoms of acute disease. On being killed, the\r\nflesh, if the disease be of a fortnight's duration, will usually be\r\nextremely dark, but in a less advanced stage of the malady the flesh\r\nwill generally present a healthy appearance. Is it really so? That\r\nis the question which science has to determine. Going upon a broad\r\nprinciple, I can hardly conceive that so serious a disease as\r\npleuro-pneumonia does not injuriously affect the quality of the flesh.\r\nIt is no argument to say that thousands consume such flesh, and yet\r\nenjoy good health. Millions of people drink water and breathe air that\r\nare extremely impure, and yet they do not speedily die. It is one thing\r\nto be poisonous, another to be unwholesome. The flesh of animals killed\r\nwhilst suffering from lung distemper is not directly poisonous, but who\r\ncan prove that it is not, like bad water, unwholesome?\r\n\r\nAs analyst to the city of Dublin, I am almost daily called upon to\r\ninspect meat suspected to be unwholesome; and I have always condemned\r\nas being unfit for human food:--\r\n\r\n    1. Animals slaughtered at the time of bringing forth their young.\r\n\r\n    2. Oxen affected with pleuro-pneumonia, when pus is present in the\r\n       lungs, or the flesh obviously affected; animals suffering from\r\n       murrain, black-quarter, and the different forms of anthrax.\r\n\r\n    3. Animals in an anaemic, or wasted condition.\r\n\r\n    4. Meat in a state of putrefaction.\r\n\r\nDuring the present year about 20,000 pounds weight of meat have been\r\nseized and condemned in the city of Dublin.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nMILK.\r\n\r\nMilk is a peculiar fluid secreted by the females of all animals\r\nbelonging to the class _Mammalia_; and, being designed for the\r\nnourishment of their offspring, contains all the constituents which\r\nenter into the composition of the animal body.\r\n\r\nThe milk of different animals varies very much in color, taste, and\r\nnutritive value. That of the cow is a little heavier than water--its\r\nspecific gravity being, on the average, about 1.030, water being\r\n1.000. It is composed of three constituents--namely, butter, curd, and\r\nwhey--each of which is also composed of a number of substances. These\r\nthree constituents are of unequal weight, or specific gravity, and their\r\nseparation is the chief process carried on in the dairy. The butter is\r\nthe lightest and the curd is the heaviest constituent.\r\n\r\nThe following table represents the composition of the milk of different\r\nanimals:--\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF THE MILK OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n  1,000 PARTS CONTAIN--\r\n\r\n  ------+---------+--------+------------+--------+-------+-------+-------\r\n        | Specific|        |            |        |       |       |\r\n        | Gravity,| Water. |   Solid    | Cheesy | Sugar.|Butter.|Mineral\r\n        |   or    |        |Ingredients.| Matter.|       |       |Matter.\r\n        | Density.|        |            |        |       |       |\r\n  ------+---------+--------+------------+--------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Woman | 1032.67 | 889.08 |   110.92   |  39.30 | 43.68 | 26.66 | 1.30\r\n  Cow   | 1030    | 864.20 |   135.80   |  48.80 | 47.70 | 31.30 | 6.00\r\n  Goat  | 1033.53 | 844.90 |   155.10   |  35.14 | 36.91 | 56.87 | 6.18\r\n  Ewe   | 1040.98 | 832.32 |   167.68   |  69.78 | 39.43 | 51.31 | 7.16\r\n  Mare  | 1033.74 | 904.30 |    95.70   |  33.35 | 32.76 | 24.36 | 5.23\r\n  Ass   | 1034.57 | 890.12 |   109.88   |  35.65 | 50.46 | 18.53 | 5.24\r\n  Bitch | 1041.62 | 772.08 |   227.92   | 116.88 | 15.29 | 87.95 | 7.80\r\n  ------+---------+--------+------------+--------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nMilk examined through a microscope is a colorless fluid, containing a\r\nlarge number of little vesicles, or bags, filled with butter--a mixture\r\nof oily and fatty matters. When the milk stands for some time, the\r\nglobules, being lighter than the other constituents, ascend to the top,\r\nand, mixed with a certain proportion of milk, are removed as cream.\r\nThe curd is termed in scientific parlance _casein_, and is in fresh milk\r\nin a state of solution--that is to say, is dissolved in milk in the same\r\nway that we dissolve sugar in water. When milk becomes sour, either\r\nnaturally or by the addition of rennet, it can no longer hold casein in\r\nsolution, and the curd consequently separates. Casein is the substance\r\nwhich forms the basis of cheese. The substance that remains after the\r\nremoval of the butter and cheese is called _serum_, or whey, and is\r\ncomposed of a sweetish substance termed _sugar of milk_, and certain\r\nsaline bodies, termed the ash, dissolved in water.\r\n\r\nThe butter and the sugar of milk are employed in the animal economy in\r\nthe production of fat, and are what have been styled by physiologists\r\n_heat-producers_ and _fat-formers_. The casein resembles the gluten of\r\nwheat in composition; it belongs to the class of food substances termed\r\n_flesh-formers_. The ash, or mineral part of the milk, is chiefly\r\nemployed in forming the bones of the young animals it is destined to\r\nnourish.\r\n\r\nThe quality of milk is influenced by the quantity and quality of the\r\nfood given to the animal. The milk of cows fed on distillery wash,\r\nturnip, and mangel tops, coarse herbage, and other kinds of inferior\r\nfood, is always of inferior quality. Hence it is of great importance\r\nthat dairy stock be kept in good old pastures in summer, and fed on\r\nSwedish turnips, mangel-wurtzel, and oil-cake during winter. It is true\r\neconomy to supply dairy cows with abundance of nutritious food; and it\r\nshould be constantly borne in mind that the milk from two well-fed cows\r\nwill give more butter than can be obtained from the produce of three\r\nbadly-fed animals.\r\n\r\nThe butter is the constituent of milk which is most affected by the\r\nnature and amount of the animal's food; and butter is precisely the\r\narticle which is of the greatest importance to the Irish dairy farmer,\r\nas the quantity of cheese prepared in this country is inconsiderable.\r\nWhen, therefore, it is found that a cow pastured on inferior land, or\r\nbadly fed in the byre, yields a large supply of milk of a high specific\r\nquantity (which, however, is rarely the case), it must not be concluded\r\nthat the result is satisfactory; for if such milk be tested by the\r\nlactometer it will certainly be found wanting in butter. The average\r\ncomposition of English milk, according to Way, is:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                87.02\r\n  Butter                                3.23\r\n  Casein                                4.48\r\n  Sugar of milk                         4.67\r\n  Ash                                   0.60\r\n                                      ------\r\n                                      100.00\r\n\r\nIn several analyses of milk published by Professor Voelcker, the highest\r\nproportion of butter is stated to be 7.62. In that of cows kept on\r\npoor and over-stocked pastures less than 2 per cent. was found. I have\r\nexamined in my capacity of Food Analyst to the City of Dublin several\r\nhundred samples of milk, in not one of which have I found the proportion\r\nof butter to amount to more than 5.6 per cent. In no sample did I find\r\na higher per-centage of solid matter than 13.15, or (when pure) lower\r\nthan 12.08. The quality of the food of the milch cow exercises a great\r\ninfluence on the quality and yield of her milk. Aliments rich in fat and\r\nsugar favor the production of butter, and augment the supply of milk.\r\nLocust-beans, malt, and molasses are good milk-producing foods; but the\r\nchief condition in the production of milk rich in butter is simply that\r\nthe animals which yield it must be fed with abundance of nutritious\r\nfood. Nor must it be supposed that the richness of milk is due to the\r\nsmallness of the yield, for whenever the quality of the secretion is\r\ninferior, it is almost certain to be deficient in quantity. Those cows\r\nwhich give the richest milk, generally yield the largest quantity.\r\n\r\n_Yield of Milk._--According to Boussingault, a cow daily yields on the\r\naverage 10.4 parts of milk per 1,000 parts of her weight. Morton, in his\r\n\"Cyclopaedia of Agriculture,\" p. 621, states that Mr. Young, a Scotch\r\ndairy keeper, obtained 680 gallons per cow per annum. Voelcker found\r\nthat some common dairy stock gave each of them fifty-two pints of milk\r\nper diem, whilst three pedigree cows yielded respectively forty-nine\r\npints.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wilson gives the following information on this point:--\r\n\r\n    Our principal dairy breeds are the Ayrshire, the Channel Islands,\r\n    the Short-horn, the Suffolk, and the Kerry. Some published returns\r\n    of two dairies of Ayrshire cows give the annual milk produce per\r\n    cow at 650 and 632 gallons respectively. Three returns of dairies,\r\n    consisting wholly of Short-horns, show a produce of 540 gallons,\r\n    630 gallons, and 765 gallons respectively, or an average of 625\r\n    gallons per annum for each cow. In two dairies, where half-bred\r\n    Short-horns were kept, the yield was 810 and 866 gallons\r\n    respectively for each cow. In four dairies in Ireland, where pure\r\n    Kerrys and crosses with Short-horns and Ayrshires were kept, the\r\n    annual produce per cow was returned at 500 gallons, 600 gallons,\r\n    675 gallons, and 740 gallons respectively; or an average, on the\r\n    four dairies, of 630 gallons per annum for each cow. A dairy of\r\n    \"pure Kerrys\" gave an average of 488 gallons per cow, and another\r\n    of the larger Irish breed gave an average of 583 gallons per head\r\n    per annum. In the great London dairies, now well-nigh extinguished\r\n    by the ravages of the cattle disease, these returns are greatly\r\n    exceeded. The cows kept are large framed Short-horns and Yorkshire\r\n    crosses, which, by good feeding, bring the returns to nearly\r\n    1,000 gallons per annum for each cow kept. The custom in these\r\n    establishments is to dispose of a cow directly her milk falls\r\n    below two gallons a-day, and buy another in her place.\r\n\r\n    The following milk return of one of our best managed dairy farms\r\n    (Frocester Court) shows the relative produce of cows in the\r\n    successive years of their milking. The first lot was bought in\r\n    at two-years old; all the others at three years:--\r\n\r\n    No. of Cows.    Year of Milk.    Produce per head.\r\n\r\n        8               1st             317 gals.\r\n       15               1st             472  \"\r\n       14               2nd             353  \"\r\n       15               3rd             616  \"\r\n       20               4th             665  \"\r\n       18               5th             635  \"\r\n        9               6th             708  \"\r\n       15               Old             651  \"\r\n\r\n    The maximum reliable milk produce that we have recorded was that\r\n    of a single cow belonging to the keeper of the gaol at Lewes, the\r\n    details of which were authenticated by the Board of Agriculture.\r\n    In eight consecutive years she gave 9,720 gallons, or at the rate\r\n    of more than 1,210 gallons per annum. In one year she milked 328\r\n    days, and gave 1,230 gallons, which yielded 540 lbs. of butter,\r\n    or at the rate of 1 lb. of butter to 22-3/4 lb. of milk. In the\r\n    early part of the present year (1866) a return was published of\r\n    the produce of a cow in a Vermont (U.S.) dairy, which was stated\r\n    to have given, in the previous year, a butter yield of 504 lbs.,\r\n    at the rate of 1 lb. of butter to 20 lbs. of milk.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preserved Milk._--Various plans have been proposed to render milk more\r\nportable, and to preserve it sweet for days and even months. Mr. Borden\r\nof Connecticut, United States, prepares a concentrated milk by boiling\r\nthe fluid down in vacuo, at a temperature under 140 deg. Fahrenheit, mixing\r\nthe resulting solid with sugar, and rapidly placing the compound in\r\ntins, which are then hermetically sealed. It is said that solidified\r\nmilk prepared by this process remains sweet for many months. In France,\r\nsolidified and concentrated milk are largely prepared; and it is certain\r\nthat London and other large towns will yet be supplied with milk\r\nrendered portable and more stable, by the removal of a large proportion\r\nof its water. In many parts of Ireland pure milk could be bought at from\r\n7d. to 8d. per gallon. I do not despair to see factories established in\r\nsuch places for the manufacture of preserved milk as a substitute for\r\nthe dear and impure fluid sold under the name of milk in London and\r\nother large cities. It is stated that solidified milk prepared in\r\nSwitzerland is now sold in London.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nBUTTER.\r\n\r\n_History of Butter._--The very general use of butter as an article of\r\nfood is demonstrated by the familiar saying--\"We should not quarrel with\r\nour bread and butter\"; yet this article, now so commonly used throughout\r\nthe greater part of Europe, was either unknown or but imperfectly known\r\nto the ancients. In the English translation of the Holy Scriptures the\r\nword butter does certainly frequently occur; but the Hebrew original\r\nis _chamea_, which, according to the most eminent Biblical critics,\r\nsignifies cream, or thick, sour milk. In the 20th chapter of Job the\r\nfollowing passage occurs:--\"He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the\r\nbrooks of honey and butter.\" Now, we can conceive streams of thin cream,\r\nbut we cannot imagine a river of butter. The oldest mention of butter\r\nis found in the works of Herodotus. In the description of the Scythians\r\ngiven by this ancient author, reference is made to their practice of\r\nviolently shaking the milk of their mares, for the purpose of causing a\r\nsolid fatty matter to ascend to its surface, which, when removed from\r\nthe milk, they considered a delicious article of food. Hippocrates, who\r\nwrote a little later than Herodotus, describes, but in clearer language,\r\nthe manufacture of butter by the Scythians; he also alludes to the\r\npreparation of cheese by the same people. The word, butter, does not\r\noccur in any of Aristotle's writings, and although mention is made of it\r\nin the works of Anaxandrides, Plutarch, and AElian, it is evident that\r\nthey considered it only in the light of a curious substance, employed\r\npartly as an article of food, partly as a medicinal salve, by certain\r\nbarbarous nations. About the second or third century, butter was but\r\nlittle known to the Greeks and Romans, and there is no reason to believe\r\nthat it was ever generally used as an article of food by the classic\r\nnations of antiquity; it is noteworthy, that the inhabitants of the\r\nsouth of Europe even at the present time use butter in very small\r\nquantities, which, indeed, is often sold for medicinal purposes in the\r\napothecaries' shops in Italy, Spain, and Portugal. From the foregoing\r\nstatements it is evident that the butter manufacture can lay no claim to\r\na classic origin; but that it took its rise in the countries of savage,\r\nof semi-civilised, and barbarous nations. It is probable that the Greeks\r\nwere made acquainted with butter by the Thracians, Phrygians, and\r\nScythians; and that the knowledge of this substance was conveyed to\r\nRome by visitors from Germany. During the middle ages the practice of\r\nbutter-making spread throughout Northern, Central, and Western Europe;\r\nbut in many parts the commodity was very scarce and highly valued,\r\nnotwithstanding its being almost, if not quite, in a semi-fluid state,\r\ninstead of possessing the firm consistence of the butter of the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n_Irish Butter._--Butter is produced in such large quantities in Ireland\r\nthat, after the home demand has been supplied, there remains a large\r\nexcess--so considerable, indeed, as to constitute one of the more\r\nimportant of our few commercial staples. The precise quantity of butter\r\nwhich, during late years, has been annually exported from Ireland is\r\nunknown. The greater part of the commodity is sent to trans-Channel\r\nports; and, there being no duty on butter in the cross-Channel trade\r\nsince 1826, we have no means of accurately estimating the amount of our\r\nexports to Great Britain. If, however, we refer to the statistics of our\r\ncommerce for the period beginning in 1787, and ending in 1826, we shall\r\nfind that the exportation of butter was enormous, and that a large\r\nproportion of that commodity consumed by the army and navy was supplied\r\nfrom the dairies of Ireland. During the three years ended on the 5th of\r\nJanuary, 1826, the average annual amount of butter exported was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                    cwts.\r\n\r\n  To Great Britain                 441,226\r\n  To foreign countries              51,637\r\n\r\nOf late years the exportation to foreign and colonial countries has\r\nfallen off; still the export trade is very considerable, probably\r\namounting to 450,000 cwts. per annum. During the year 1867, the imports\r\nof foreign butter into Great Britain amounted to 1,142,262 cwts.\r\n\r\nI have quoted the above statistics for the purpose of demonstrating\r\nthe great importance of the butter trade to this country. Not only is a\r\nlarge proportion of the agricultural community pecuniarily interested in\r\nthe production of this article, but the exportation is the chief cause\r\nof the commercial prosperity of a city, which, in point of population,\r\nranks third in the kingdom. If butter, then, be an article of so much\r\nimportance, it is obvious that the greatest care should be taken in its\r\npreparation, and that the efforts of both scientific and practical men\r\nshould be directed towards the best mode of improving its quality. If\r\nthe principles involved in the production of butter were thoroughly\r\nunderstood, and generally known, I believe that such terms as \"seconds,\"\r\n\"thirds,\" and \"fourths,\" would speedily fall into disuse; that there\r\nwould be only one kind of butter sent into the market; and that the\r\narticle would always be of the best quality, in other words, \"firsts.\"\r\n\r\n_Composition of Butter._--The composition and quality of butter depend\r\nto a great extent upon the condition of the milk or cream from which it\r\nis prepared, and on the skill and cleanliness of the dairy-maid. It\r\nconsists essentially of fatty and oily matters, but it is always found\r\nin combination with casein (cheesy matter) and water. The following\r\nanalyses, made by Mr. Way, late consulting chemist to the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society of England, shows its composition:--\r\n\r\n  INGREDIENTS PER CENT.\r\n\r\n                        1.      2.      3.\r\n\r\n  Fatty matters       82.70   79.67   79.12\r\n  Casein               2.45    3.38    3.37\r\n  Water               14.85   16.95   17.51\r\n\r\nNo. 1 analysis shows the composition of a specimen obtained from the\r\nwell-known Mr. Horsfall's dairy. It was made from raw cream. The other\r\nspecimens were the produce of a Devonshire dairy, and were prepared from\r\nscalded cream. In several specimens of well-made and unsalted Irish\r\nbutter which I have analysed, I found the proportion of casein or cheesy\r\nmatter never to exceed 1 per cent., whilst in the analysis above stated\r\nthe centesimal amount is on the average more than 3 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe fatty matter is composed of two substances--one, a solid, termed\r\n_margarin_; the other fluid, and styled by chemists _elaine_. The solid\r\nfat is identical in composition with the solid fat of the human body.\r\nThe elaine is peculiar to milk, but it differs very slightly from\r\n_olein_, or fluid fat. The relative proportions of the fluid and solid\r\nfats vary with the seasons. According to Braconnot, the solid fat forms\r\nin summer 40 per cent. of the butter, but in winter the proportion rises\r\nto 65. This decrease in the proportion of the liquid fat in winter is\r\nthe cause of the greater hardness of the butter in that season, which is\r\noften incorrectly attributed solely to the cold.\r\n\r\nThe cheesy and acid matters contained in butter are by no means\r\nessential; on the contrary, if it were quite free from them, it might\r\nbe retained with little or no salt for a very long period without\r\nbecoming rancid. The cheesy matter contains nitrogen; and nearly all\r\nthe substances into which this element enters as a constituent are\r\nremarkably prone to decomposition. Yeast, and ferments of every\r\nkind--gunpowder, fulminating silver, chloride of nitrogen--and almost\r\nevery explosive compound, contain this element. The cheesy matter is\r\na very nitrogenous body, and in presence of air and moisture not only\r\nrapidly decomposes, or decays, itself, but induces by mere contact a\r\nlike state of decomposition in other substances--such, for instance, as\r\nfat, sugar, and starch, which naturally have no tendency to change their\r\nstate. Bearing the foregoing facts in mind, it is obvious that the chief\r\nprecautions to be observed in the manufacture of butter are:--Firstly,\r\nto separate to as great an extent as practicable the casein from the\r\nbutter; and, secondly, as in practice a small portion of the curd\r\nremains in the butter, to prevent it from undergoing any change--at\r\nleast for a prolonged period. How these desiderata may best be\r\naccomplished I shall now proceed to point out.\r\n\r\n_The Butter Manufacture._--The theory of the process of churning is very\r\nsimple. By violently agitating the milk or cream the little vesicles, or\r\nbags containing the butter, are broken, and, the fatty matter adhering,\r\n_lumps of butter_ are formed. The operation of churning also introduces\r\natmospheric air into the milk, which, aided by the high temperature to\r\nwhich the fluid is raised, converts a portion of the _sweet_ sugar of\r\nmilk into the _sour_ lactic acid. By the alteration produced in this way\r\nin the composition of the milk, it is no longer capable of holding the\r\ncasein in solution, and the curd therefore separates.\r\n\r\nThe churn and other vessels in which the milk is placed cannot be kept\r\ntoo clean. No amount of labor bestowed on the scalding and scrubbing\r\nof the vessels is excessive. When wood is the material used in the\r\nmilk-pans the utmost care should be taken in cleaning them, as the\r\nporous nature of the material favors the retention of small quantities\r\nof the milk. A simple washing will not suffice to clean such vessels.\r\nThey must be thoroughly scrubbed and afterwards well scalded with\r\n_boiling_ water. Tin pans are preferable to wooden ones, as they are\r\nmore easily cleaned, but in their turn they are inferior to glass\r\nvessels, which ought to supersede every other kind. Earthenware, lead,\r\nand zinc pans are in rather frequent use. The last-mentioned material\r\nis easily acted upon by the lactic acid of the sour milk, and is,\r\ntherefore, objectionable. It is a matter of great importance that the\r\ndairy should not be situated near a pig-stye, sewer, or water-closet,\r\nthe effluvia from which would be likely to taint the milk. It is\r\nsurprising how small a quantity of putrescent matter is sufficient\r\nto taint a whole churn of milk; and as it has been demonstrated that\r\nthe almost inappreciable emanations from a cesspool are capable of\r\nconferring a bad flavor on milk, it is in the highest degree important\r\nto remove from the churn and milk-pail every trace of the sour milk. I\r\ngo further, it is even desirable that no one whose hands have a tendency\r\nto perspire should be allowed to manipulate in the dairy; and it should\r\nbe constantly borne in mind that the dairy-maid's fingers and hot water\r\nshould be on the most intimate visiting terms.\r\n\r\nButter is made either from cream--sour and sweet--or from whole milk\r\nwhich has stood sufficiently long to become distinctly sour. It is\r\nasserted by some makers that butter prepared from whole milk, or\r\nfrom scalded cream, contains a large proportion of curd. If this be\r\ntrue--which I greatly doubt--it is a serious matter, for such butter\r\nwould speedily become rancid in consequence of the casein acting as\r\na ferment. I believe that experience points to an exactly opposite\r\nconclusion. From the results of careful inquiries I feel no hesitation\r\nin asserting that the butter should not be made from the cream, but from\r\nthe _whole milk_. When made from the cream alone it is much more likely\r\nto acquire a bad taste, and is generally wanting in keeping qualities.\r\nI have no doubt but that in the process of churning the whole milk there\r\nis a large amount of lactic acid formed, and a much higher temperature\r\nattained, than in the churning of cream; consequently, the separation of\r\ncaseous matter must be more perfectly effected in the former than in the\r\nlatter case. It is a mistake to think that there is very little casein\r\nin cream: out of 7 or 8 lbs. of thick cream only a couple of pounds of\r\nbutter are obtainable; the rest is made up of water, casein, and sugar\r\nof milk. The yield of butter is greater when the whole milk is churned\r\nthan when the cream alone is operated upon, and, what is of great\r\nimportance, the quality of the butter is uniform during the whole year.\r\nThe labor of churning whole milk is, of course, much greater than if the\r\ncream alone were employed, but the increased yield and unvarying quality\r\nof the butter more than compensate for the extra expenditure of labor.\r\n\r\nThe proper temperature of the milk or cream is a point of great\r\npractical importance. If the fluid be too warm or too cold the buttery\r\nparticles will only by great trouble be made to cohere; and the quality\r\nof the butter is almost certain to be inferior. When the whole milk\r\nis operated on, the temperature should be from 55 to 60 degs. of\r\nFahrenheit's thermometer; and if cream be employed the temperature\r\nshould never exceed 55 degs. nor be lower than 50 degs. Hence it follows\r\nthat in summer the dairy should be kept cooler, and in winter warmer,\r\nthan the atmosphere. The temperature of milk is raised or lowered as may\r\nbe found necessary, by the addition of hot or cold water--in performing\r\nwhich operations properly, a good thermometer is indispensable; one\r\nshould always be kept in the dairy, and should be so constructed as to\r\nadmit of being plunged into the milk. In some dairies the water, instead\r\nof being mixed with the milk, is put into a tub in which the churn is\r\nplaced. There is a good kind of churn, which consists of two cylinders,\r\nthe one within the other--the interval between them being intended for\r\nthe reception of hot or cold water. The influence of temperature upon\r\nthe production of butter has been placed beyond all doubt by numerous\r\ncarefully-conducted experiments. Mr. Horsfall, a celebrated dairy\r\nfarmer, in discussing this question, sums up as follows:--\"By a series\r\nof carefully-conducted experiments at varying temperatures, I am of\r\nopinion that a correct scale of the comparative yield of butter at\r\ndifferent temperatures might be arrived at; as thus: From a very low\r\ndegree of temperature little or no butter; from a temperature of about\r\n38 degs., 16 oz. from 16 quarts of milk; ditto, 45 degs., 21 oz. from 16\r\nquarts of milk; ditto, 55 degs., 26 to 27 oz. from 16 quarts of milk.\"\r\nThis is a higher yield of butter than, I suspect, most dairymen get: but\r\nMr. Horsfall's cows being of the best kind for milking, and well fed,\r\nthe milk is, of course, rich in butter; and his experiments prove that\r\neven the richest milk will not throw up its butter unless at a certain\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIn the churning of cream the motion should be slow at first until the\r\ncream is thoroughly broken up. In churning milk the agitation should\r\nneither be violent nor irregular; about 40 or 50 motions of the plunger\r\nor board per minute will be sufficient. In steam-worked churns the\r\nmotion is often excessively rapid, and the separation of the butter\r\nis effected in a few minutes; but the article obtained in this hasty\r\nway very quickly becomes rancid, and must be disposed of at once. An\r\nhour's churning of sour cream appears in general to produce good butter.\r\nSweet cream and whole milk require a longer period--the latter about 3\r\nhours--but in any case prolonged churning is certain, by incorporating\r\ncheesy matter with the butter, to produce an inferior article.\r\n\r\nSweet milk becomes sour, evolves a considerable quantity of gas during\r\nchurning, and its temperature ascends four or five degrees. Oxygen is\r\nunquestionably absorbed, and it is probable that a portion of the sugar\r\nof milk is converted into acid products.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that even the most carefully prepared butter\r\ncontains a small proportion of casein and sugar of milk. This casein\r\nis the good genius of the cheese-maker, but the evil genius of the\r\nbutter manufacturer. How? In this way:--When butter containing a\r\nnotable proportion of casein and sugar of milk is exposed to the air,\r\nthe following changes take place: the casein passes into a state of\r\nfermentation, and acting upon the sugar of milk, converts it, firstly\r\ninto the bad-flavored lactic acid, and secondly into the bad odorous\r\nbutyric, capric, and caproic acids. The first of these compounds in a\r\nstate of purity emits an odor resembling a mixture of vinegar and rancid\r\nbutter; the second possesses an odor resembling that of a goat--hence\r\nthe name _capric_; the third has an odor like that of perspiration. In\r\naddition to these acids, there is another simultaneously generated--the\r\ncaprylic, but it does not unpleasantly affect the olfactory nerve.\r\nThe casein also injuriously affects the fatty constituents of the\r\nbutter; under its influence they absorb oxygen from the air, and become\r\nconverted into strong-smelling compounds. The washing of butter is\r\nintended to free it from the casein and unaltered cream, and the more\r\nperfectly it is freed from those impurities the better will be its\r\nflavor, and the longer it will remain without becoming rancid. Some\r\npeople believe that too much water injures the quality and lessens the\r\nquantity of butter. It cannot do the former, because the essential\r\nconstituents of butter are totally insoluble in water; it may do the\r\nlatter, but, if it do, so much the better, because the loss of weight\r\nrepresents the amount of impurities--milk, sugar of milk, &c.--removed.\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that butter is so susceptible of taint that even\r\na perspiring hand is sufficient to spoil it; naturally cool hands should\r\nalone be allowed to come in contact with this delicate commodity, and\r\nthe hands should be made thoroughly clean by repeated washings with warm\r\nwater and oatmeal--the use of soap in the lavatory of the dairymaid\r\nbeing highly objectionable. Wooden spades are now being commonly made\r\nuse of in manipulating the butter, and there is no good reason why they\r\nshould not come into universal use.\r\n\r\nThe yield of butter per cow is subject to great variation. Some breeds\r\nof the animal are remarkable as milkers; such, for instance, as the\r\nAlderneys and Kerrys--indeed, I may say all the small varieties of the\r\nbovine race. There are instances of cows yielding upwards of twenty\r\npounds of butter per week, but these are extraordinary cases. In Holland\r\na good cow will produce, during the summer months, more than 180 lbs.\r\nof butter. In these countries I think the average annual yield of a\r\ncow is not more than 170 lbs. It sometimes happens that cows yield\r\na large quantity of milk and a small amount of butter, but it far more\r\nfrequently occurs that the cow which gives most milk also yields most\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the amount of butter contained in milk may be made by\r\ndetermining the amount of cream. This may be effected by means of an\r\ninstrument termed a _lactometer_, which is simply a glass tube about\r\nfive inches long, and graduated into a hundred parts. The specimen to be\r\nexamined is poured into this tube up to zero or 0, and allowed to stand\r\nfor twelve hours in summer and sixteen or eighteen in winter. At the end\r\nof that time the cream will have risen to the top, and its per-centage\r\nmay be easily seen. In good milk the cream will generally extend 11 to\r\n15 degrees down from 0. This instrument, although very useful, is not\r\nreliable in every case, especially in detecting the adulteration of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the complete separation of the butter from\r\nthe other constituents of the milk is never accomplished in the dairy.\r\nNow although the proportion of curd in the butter is very small--rarely\r\nmore than two per cent. and often not a fourth of one per cent.--yet it\r\nis more than sufficient, under a certain condition, to cause the butter\r\nto become speedily rancid. That condition is simply contact with the\r\nair. If the curd, before it becomes dry and firm, is subjected to the\r\ninfluence of the air, it rapidly passes into a state of fermentation,\r\nwhich is very soon communicated to the fatty and saccharine constituents\r\nof the butter (substances not spontaneously liable to sudden changes in\r\ncomposition) and those peculiar compounds--such, for example, as butyric\r\nand capric acids, are generated, which confer upon rancid butter its\r\ncharacteristic and very disagreeable odor and flavor. The fermentation\r\nof the curd is prevented by incorporating common salt with the butter,\r\nand by preventing, so far as possible, the access of air to the\r\nvessels in which the article is placed. If fresh butter be placed in\r\nwater--which apparently protects it from the influence of the air--it\r\nwill soon become rancid. The reason of this is, that water always\r\ncontains air, which differs in composition, though derived, from the\r\natmosphere, by being very rich in oxygen. Now, it is precisely this\r\noxygen which effects those undesirable changes in the casein, or curd,\r\nto which I have so repeatedly referred; hence its presence in a\r\nconcentrated state in water causes that fluid to produce an injurious\r\neffect on the butter placed in it. A saturated solution of salt contains\r\nvery little air, and, so long as the curd is immersed therein, it\r\nundergoes no change. The salt, too, acts as a decided preservative; for\r\nalthough it was long considered to be capable of preserving animal\r\nmatters, merely by virtue of its property of absorbing water from them\r\n(the presence of water being a condition in the decomposition of organic\r\nmatter), it has lately been shown to possess very antiseptic properties.\r\n\r\nThe mixing of the salt with the butter is effected in the following\r\nmanner:--The butter, after being well washed, in order to free it from\r\nthe butter-milk, is spread out in a tub, and the salt shaken over it;\r\nthe butter is then turned over on the salt by the lower part of the palm\r\nof the hand, and rubbed down until a uniform mixture is attained. A good\r\nplan in salting is to mix in only one half of the quantity of salt, make\r\nup the butter in lumps, and set them aside until the following day; a\r\nquantity of milk is certain to exude, which is to be poured off, and\r\nthen the rest of the salt may be incorporated with the butter.\r\n\r\nAccording to butter-makers, the quality of the article is greatly\r\ndependent on the quality of the salt used in preserving it. I think\r\nthere is a good deal of truth in this belief, and I therefore recommend\r\nthat only the very best and _driest_ salt should be used in the dairy.\r\nCommon salt is essentially composed of the substance termed by chemists\r\nchloride of sodium, but it often contains other saline matters (chloride\r\nof magnesium, &c.), some of which have a tendency to absorb moisture\r\nfrom the air, and to dissolve in the water so obtained. These salts are\r\ntermed _deliquescent_, from the Latin _deliquere_, to melt down. When,\r\ntherefore, common salt becomes damp by mere exposure to the air, it is\r\nto be inferred that it contains impurities which, as they possess a very\r\nbitter taste, would, if mixed with butter, confer a bad flavor upon it.\r\nThe impurities of salt may be almost completely removed by placing about\r\na stone weight of it in any convenient vessel, pouring over it a quart\r\nof boiling water, and mixing thoroughly the fluid and solid. In an hour\r\nor two the whole is to be thrown upon a filter made of calico, when the\r\nwater will pass through the filter, carrying with it all the impurities,\r\nand the purified salt, in fine crystals, will remain upon the filter.\r\nThe solution need not be thrown away: boiled down to dryness it may be\r\ngiven as salt to cattle; or, if added in solution to the dung-heap, it\r\nwill augment the fertilising power of that manure.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of salt used in preserving butter varies greatly. When\r\nthe butter is intended for immediate use, I believe a quarter of an\r\nounce of salt to the pound is quite sufficient; but when designed for\r\nthe market, about half an ounce of salt to the pound of butter will be\r\nsufficient. Irish butter at one time commanded the highest price in the\r\nhome and foreign markets, but latterly it has fallen greatly in public\r\nestimation; indeed, at the present moment the price of Irish butter at\r\nLondon is nearly twenty shillings per cwt. under that of the Dutch\r\narticle. It is really painful to be obliged to admit that the Irish\r\nfarmer is solely to blame for this remarkable depreciation in the value\r\nof one of our best agricultural staples. In a word, by the stupid (and\r\n_recent_) practice of putting into butter four times the quantity of\r\nsalt necessary to its preservation, the Irish dairy farmers--or at least\r\nthe great majority of them--have completely ruined the reputation of\r\nIrish butter in those very markets in which, at one time, the Cork\r\nbrand on a firkin was sufficient to dispose of its contents at the\r\nvery highest price. It is a great mistake to think that the greater the\r\nquantity of salt which can be incorporated with the butter, the greater\r\nwill be the profit to the producer. No doubt, every pound of salt sold\r\nas a constituent of butter realises a profit of two thousand per cent.;\r\nbut then the addition of every pound of that substance, after a certain\r\nquantity, to the cwt. of butter depreciates the value of the latter to\r\nsuch an extent as to far more than neutralise the gain on the sale of\r\nsalt at the price of butter. In the county of Carlow, less salt is used\r\nin preserving butter than is the case in the county of Cork and the\r\nadjacent counties; the price, therefore, which the Carlow commodity\r\ncommands in the London market is higher than that of the Cork butter:\r\nbut in every part of Ireland the proportion of salt added to the butter\r\nis excessive.\r\n\r\nThe results of the analyses of butter supplied to the London market,\r\nmade by the _Lancet_ Analytical Commission, showed that the proportion\r\nof salt varied from 0.30 to 8.24 per cent. The largest proportion of\r\nsalt found in fresh butter was 2.21 and the least 0.30. In salt butter\r\nthe highest proportion of salt was 8.24 and the lowest 1.53. The butter\r\nwhich contained most salt was also generally largely adulterated with\r\nwater. Indeed, in several samples the amount of this constituent reached\r\nso high as nearly 30 per cent. Nothing is easier than the incorporation\r\nof water with salt butter. The butter is melted, and whilst cooling the\r\nsalt and water are added, and the mixture kept constantly stirred until\r\nquite cold. In this way nearly 50 per cent. of water may be added to\r\nbutter; but of course the quality of the article will be of the very\r\nworst kind.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Lancet_ states that, on awakening about\r\nthree o'clock in the morning at the house in which he was lodging, he\r\nperceived a light below the door of his room; and apprehending a fire,\r\nhe hurried down stairs, and was not a little surprised to discover the\r\nwhole family engaged in manipulating butter. He was informed in a jocose\r\nway that they were making Epping butter! For this purpose they used\r\ninferior Irish butter, which, by repeated washings, was freed from its\r\nexcessive amount of salt; after which it was frequently bathed in sweet\r\nmilk, the addition of a little sugar being the concluding stroke in the\r\nprocess. This \"sweet fresh butter from Epping\" was sold at a profit of\r\n100 per cent. Our dairy farmers might take a hint from this anecdote.\r\nDoes it not prove that the mere removal of the salt added to Irish\r\nbutter doubles the value of the article?\r\n\r\nIt is as necessary to pay attention to the packing of butter as it is\r\nto its salting. If old firkins be employed, great care should be taken\r\nin cleaning them, and if the staves be loose, the firkins should be\r\nsteeped in hot water, in order to cause the wood to swell, and thereby\r\nto bring the edges of the staves into close contact. New firkins often\r\ncommunicate a disagreeable odour to the butter. In order to guard\r\nagainst this, it is the practice in many parts to fill the firkins with\r\nvery moist garden mould, which, after the lapse of a few days, is thrown\r\nout, and the firkin thoroughly scrubbed with hot water, rinsed with the\r\nsame fluid in a cold state, and finally rubbed with salt, just before\r\nbeing used.\r\n\r\nIn packing the butter, the chief object to be kept in view is the\r\nexclusion of air. In order to accomplish this, the lumps of butter\r\nshould be pressed firmly together, and also against the bottom and sides\r\nof the vessel. When the products of several churnings are placed in the\r\nsame firkin, the surface of each churning should be furrowed, so that\r\nthe next layer may be mixed with it. A firkin should never be filled in\r\na single operation. About six inches of butter of each churning will\r\nbe quite sufficient, and in a large dairy two or more firkins can be\r\ngradually but simultaneously filled. I strongly recommend the removal\r\nof the pickle jar from the dairy. When the layers of butter have been\r\ncarried up to within an inch or so of the top of the firkin, the space\r\nbetween the surface of the butter and the edge of the vessel should be\r\nfilled with fine dry salt, instead of pickle. A common mistake made is\r\nthe holding over for too long a time of the butter: the sooner this\r\narticle can be disposed of the better, for _it never improves by age_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: From two Greek words, signifying odour and soup.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: \"A New Inquiry, fully illustrated by coloured engravings\r\nof the heart, lungs, &c., of the Diseased Prize Cattle lately exhibited\r\nat the Smithfield Cattle Club, 1857.\" By Frederick James Gant, M.R.C.S.\r\nLondon, 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Professor John Wilson's Report of the Agricultural\r\nExhibition, Aarhuus, 1867.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nON THE COMPOSITION AND NUTRITIVE VALUE OF VEGETABLE FOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nTHE MONEY VALUE OF FOOD SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nThe flesh-forming principles of food are, as I have already stated,\r\nalmost identical with the principal nitrogenous constituents of animals.\r\nUnlike the non-plastic substances, they are convertible into each other\r\nwith little, if any, loss either of matter or of force. Not many\r\nyears since it was the fashion to estimate the nutritive value of a\r\nfood-substance by its proportion of nitrogen; but this method--not yet\r\nquite abandoned--was based on erroneous views, and yielded results very\r\nfar from the truth. No doubt all the more concentrated and valuable\r\nkinds of food are rich in nitrogenous principles; but there are other\r\nvarieties, the nutritive value of which is very low, and yet their\r\nproportion of nitrogen is very high. This point requires explanation.\r\nBoth the plastic and the non-plastic materials of food exist in two\r\ndistinct states--in one of which they are easily digestible, and in the\r\nother either altogether unassimilable or so nearly so as to be almost\r\nuseless. Thus, for example, the cellular tissue of plants, when newly\r\nformed, is to a great extent digestible, whilst the old woody fibre is\r\nnearly, if not quite, incapable of assimilation. Gelatine, which in raw\r\nbones is easily digested in the stomachs of the carnivora, loses a large\r\nproportion of its nutritive value on being subjected to the action of\r\nsteam. Again, a portion of the nitrogen of young succulent plants is in\r\na form not sufficiently organic to admit of its being assimilated to\r\nthe animal body. But, independently of these strong objections to the\r\nmethod of estimating the nutritive value of food by its per-centage of\r\nflesh-formers, there are many other reasons which as clearly prove the\r\nfallacy of this rule. If we were, for instance, to estimate the value\r\nof albumen according to the tables of food equivalents which were\r\nconstructed some years ago by Boussingault and other chemists, we would\r\nfind one pound weight of it to be equivalent to four pounds weight of\r\noil-cake, or to twelve pounds weight of hay; yet, it is a fact that\r\na horse would speedily die if confined to a purely albuminous diet,\r\nwhereas hay is capable of supporting the animal's life for an indefinite\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, from what I have stated, that neither the amount of\r\nflesh-formers, nor of fat-formers, contained in a given quantity of a\r\nsubstance is a measure of its nutritive value; nevertheless it would\r\nbe incorrect to infer from this that the numerous analyses of feeding\r\nsubstances which have been made are valueless. On the contrary, I am\r\ndisposed to believe that the composition of these substances, when\r\ncorrectly stated by the chemist, enables the physiologist to determine\r\npretty accurately their relative alimentary value. Theory is certainly\r\nagainst the assumption that food is valuable in proportion to its\r\ncontent of nitrogen; nor has practice less strongly disproved its truth.\r\nAn illustration drawn from the nutrition of plants will make this matter\r\nmore apparent. Every intelligent agriculturist knows that guano contains\r\nnitrogen and phosphoric acid; both substances are indispensable to the\r\ndevelopment of plants, and therefore it would be incorrect to estimate\r\nthe manurial value of the guano in proportion to the quantity of\r\nnitrogen it was capable of yielding. If the value of manures were\r\ndetermined only by their per-centage of nitrogen--a mode by which\r\ncertain chemists still estimate the nutritive value of food--then\r\nwoollen rags would be worth more than bones, and bones would be more\r\nvaluable than superphosphate of lime. The truth is, that the analysis of\r\nfeeding stuffs and manures is sometimes of little value if the condition\r\nin which the constituents of these substances exist be undetermined. For\r\nexample, the analysis of one manure may show it to contain 40 per cent.\r\nof phosphate of lime, and three per cent. of ammonia, whilst, according\r\nto analysis, another fertiliser may include 20 per cent. of phosphate of\r\nlime, and two per cent. of ammonia. Viewed by this light solely, the\r\nfirst manure would be considered the more valuable of the two, whereas\r\nit might, in reality, be very much inferior. If the phosphate of lime\r\nin the manure, containing 40 per cent. of that body, were derived from\r\ncoprolites or apatite, and its ammonia from horns, the former would be\r\nworth little or nothing, and the latter, by reason of its exceedingly\r\nslow evolution from the horns, would possess a very low value. If, on\r\nthe contrary, the phosphate of lime, in the manure comparatively poor\r\nin phosphate, were a constituent of bones, and its ammonia ready formed\r\n(say as sulphate of ammonia), then, its value, both commercial and\r\nmanurial, would be far greater than the other.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the money value of an article of food, we should omit\r\nsuch considerations as the relative adjustment of its flesh-formers and\r\nfat-formers, and its suitability to particular kinds of animals, as well\r\nas to animals in a certain stage of development. The manure supplied to\r\nplants contains several elements indispensable to vegetable nutrition;\r\nand, although the agriculturist most commonly purchases all these\r\nelements combined in the one article, still he frequently buys each\r\ningredient separately. Ammonia is one of these principles, and, whether\r\nit be bought _per se_, or as a constituent of a compound manure, the\r\nprice it commands is invariable. This principle should prevail in the\r\npurchase of food: each constituent of which should have a certain value\r\nplaced upon it; and the sums of all the values of the constituents would\r\nthen be the value of the article of food taken as a whole. There are, no\r\ndoubt, practical difficulties in the way which prevent this method of\r\nvaluation from giving more than approximatively correct results; but\r\nare there not precisely similar difficulties in the way of the correct\r\nestimation of the value of a manure according to its analysis? There\r\nare several constituents of food, the money value of which is easily\r\ndeterminable: these are sugar, starch, and fat. No matter what substance\r\nthey are found in, the nutritive value of each varies only within very\r\nnarrow limits. The value of cellulose and woody fibre is not so easily\r\nascertained, as it varies with the age and nature of the vegetable\r\nstructure in which these principles occur. There is little doubt but\r\nthat the cellulose and fibre of young grass, clover, and other succulent\r\nplants, are, for the most part, digestible; and we should not be far\r\nastray if we were to assume that four pounds weight of soft fibre and\r\ncellulose are equivalent to three pounds weight of starch. As to old\r\nhard fibre, we are not in a position to say whether or not it possesses\r\nany nutrimental value worth taking into account. The estimation of the\r\nvalue of the flesh-forming materials is far more difficult than that of\r\nsugar, starch, pectine compounds, and fat. The nitrogenous constituents\r\nof food must be in a highly elaborated state before they are capable\r\nof being assimilated. In seeds--in which vegetable substances attain\r\ntheir highest degree of development--they probably exist in the most\r\ndigestible form, whilst much of the nitrogen found in the stems and\r\nleaves of succulent plants, is either in a purely mineral state, or in\r\nso low a degree of elaboration as to be unavailable for the purpose of\r\nnutrition. But even plastic materials, in a high degree of organisation,\r\npresent many points of difference, which greatly affect their relative\r\nalimental value; for example, many of them are naturally associated with\r\nsubstances possessing a disagreeable flavor: and as their separation\r\nfrom these substances is often practically impossible, the animal that\r\nconsumes both will not assimilate the plastic matters so well as if\r\nthey were endowed with a pleasant flavor. In seeds and other perfectly\r\nmatured vegetable structures, the flesh-formers may exist in different\r\ndegrees of availability. The nitrogen of the _testa_, or covering of\r\nthe seeds, will hardly be so assimilable as that which exists in their\r\ncotyledons. The solubility of the flesh-formers--provided they be\r\nhighly elaborated--is a very good criterion of their nutritive power.\r\nIn linseed the muscle-forming substances are more soluble than in\r\nlinseed-cake--the heat which is generally employed in the extraction of\r\noil from linseed rendering the plastic materials of the resultant _cake_\r\nless soluble, and diminishing thereby their digestibility, as practice\r\nhas proved.\r\n\r\nFrom the considerations which I have now entered into, it is obvious\r\nthat the chemical analysis of food substances as generally performed,\r\nthough of great utility, does not afford strictly accurate information\r\nas to their commercial value, and still less reliable in relation to\r\ntheir nutritive power. At the same time, they as clearly establish\r\nthe feasibility of analyses being _made_ whereby the money value of\r\nfeeding-stuffs may be estimated with tolerable exactitude. Let the\r\nchemist determine the presence and relative amounts of the ingredients\r\nof food-substances, and--if it be possible so to do with a degree of\r\nexactness that would render the results useful--place on each a money\r\nvalue. This done, let the physiologist and the feeder combine the food\r\nin such proportions as they may find best adapted to the nature, age,\r\nand condition of the animal to be fed.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the market price of feeding stuffs is not,\r\nin consequence of our defective knowledge, strictly determined by their\r\nnutritive value, for if such were the case, the feeder would merely have\r\nto adapt each to the nature and condition of his stock. Even amongst\r\npractical men there prevails, unfortunately, great diversity of opinion\r\nas to the relative nutritive value of the greater number of food\r\nsubstances; and I am quite certain that many of these command higher\r\nprices than others which in no respect are inferior. It would lead me\r\ntoo far from my immediate subject were I to enter minutely into the\r\nconsideration of such questions as--whether an acre of grass yields more\r\nor less nutriment than an acre of turnips? I shall merely describe the\r\ncomposition and properties of grass and of turnips, and of the various\r\nother important food substances, and compare their nutritive power, so\r\nfar as comparisons are admissible; but I shall say but little on the\r\nsubject of the various economic and other conditions which affect the\r\nproduction of forage plants. When I shall have described the chemical\r\nnature and physical condition of the various articles of food, and the\r\nresults of actual feeding experiments made with them, the feeder will\r\nthen be in a position to determine which are the most economical to\r\nproduce or to purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nPROXIMATE CONSTITUENTS OF VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\nThe saccharine, or amylaceous substances constitute the most abundant\r\nof the proximate constituents of plants. They are composed of carbon,\r\nhydrogen, and oxygen. I shall briefly describe the more important\r\nmembers of this group of substances, namely, starch, sugar, inulin,\r\ngum, pectin, and cellulose.\r\n\r\n_Starch_, or _fecula_, occurs largely in dicotyledonous seeds, peas,\r\n&c., and still more abundantly in certain monocotyledonous seeds, such\r\nas wheat and barley. It constitutes the great bulk of many tubers and\r\nroots--for example, the potato and tapioca. It consists of flattened\r\novate granules, which vary in size according to the plant. In the\r\nbeetroot they are 1/3500 of an inch in diameter, whilst in _tous les\r\nmois_ they are nearly 1/200 of an inch in diameter. Most of the starch\r\ngranules are marked by a series of concentric rings. Starch is heavier\r\nthan water, and is insoluble in that fluid when cold; neither is it\r\ndissolved by alcohol or ether. When heated in water having a temperature\r\nof at least 140 deg. Fahrenheit, it increases greatly in volume, and\r\nacquires a gelatinous consistence. When the water is allowed to cool,\r\na portion of the starch becomes insoluble, whilst another portion\r\nremains in solution; the latter form of starch is sometimes termed\r\n_amidin_, from the French word for starch, _amidon_. When dry starch\r\nis heated to 400 deg. Fahr., it is converted, without any change in its\r\ncomposition, into a soluble gum-like substance, termed _dextrin_,\r\nor British gum. On being boiled in diluted sulphuric acid it is\r\nconverted into a kind of sugar; and the same effect is produced by\r\nfermentation--for example, in the germination of seeds. Fresh rice\r\ncontains 82, wheat 60, and potatoes 20 per cent. of starch. This\r\nsubstance constitutes a nutritious and easily digestible food, but\r\nalone cannot support life. Arrowroot is only a pure form of starch.\r\n\r\n_Sugar_ occurs less abundantly in plants than starch. There are several\r\nvarieties of this substance, of which the kinds termed cane sugar\r\n(_sucrose_) and grape sugar (_glucose_), are only of importance to\r\nagriculturists. The former enters largely into the composition of the\r\nsugar-cane, the beetroot, the sugar-maple, the sorgho grass, pumpkins,\r\ncarrots, and a great variety of other plants. Grape sugar is found in\r\nfruits, especially when dried--raisins and figs--in malted corn, and\r\nin honey. In the sugar-cane there is 18 per cent., and in the beetroot\r\n10 per cent. of sugar.\r\n\r\n_Cane sugar_, when pure, consists of minute transparent crystals. It is\r\n1-6/10 heavier than water, and is soluble in one-third of its weight\r\nof that fluid. By long-continued boiling in water it is changed into\r\nuncrystallizable sugar, or treacle, by which its flavor is altered, but\r\nits sweetening power increased.\r\n\r\n_Grape sugar_ crystallizes in very small cubes, of inferior color as\r\ncompared with cane sugar crystals. It dissolves in its own weight of\r\nwater, being three times less soluble than sucrose. In sweetening power\r\none part of cane sugar is equal to 2-1/2 parts of grape sugar; but there\r\nis probably little if any difference, between the nutritive power of the\r\ntwo substances.\r\n\r\n_Inulin_ is a substance somewhat resembling starch. It does not occur\r\nin large quantities. It is met with in the roots of the dandelion,\r\nchicory, and many other plants.\r\n\r\n_Gum_ is an abundant constituent of plants. The kind termed gum\r\narabic, so largely employed in the arts, is a very pure variety of this\r\nsubstance. Common gums are said to be essentially composed of a very\r\nweak acid--_gummic_, or _arabic_ acid--united with lime and potash.\r\nThe solution of gum is very slightly acid, and has a mucilaginous,\r\nropy consistence: it is almost tasteless. _Mucilage_, or _bassorin_,\r\nis simply a modified form of gum, which, though insoluble in water,\r\nforms a gelatinous mixture with that fluid. It exudes from certain\r\ntrees--the cherry for example--and exists largely in linseed and other\r\nseeds. Gums are nutritious foods, but it is probable that they are not\r\nequal in alimental power to equal weights of starch or sugar.\r\n\r\n_Vegetable jelly_, or _pectin_, is almost universally diffused\r\nthroughout the vegetable kingdom. It is owing to its presence that the\r\njuices of many fruits and roots possess the property of gelatinizing.\r\nIt is soluble in water, but prolonged boiling destroys its viscous\r\nproperty. _Pectose_ is a modification of pectin; it is insoluble in\r\nwater. According to Fremy, the hardness of green fruits is due to the\r\npresence of pectose; which is also found in the cellular tissue of\r\nturnips, carrots, and various other roots.\r\n\r\n_Cellulose_ is a fibrous or cellular tissue, allied in composition to\r\nstarch. It is the most abundant constituent of plants, and forms the\r\nvery ground-work of the vegetable mechanism. Linen, cotton, and the\r\npith of the elder and other trees are nearly pure forms of cellulose.\r\nLigneous, or woody tissue (_lignin_) is indurated cellulose, hardened\r\nby age. It is almost identical in composition with cellulose. Pure\r\ncellulose is white, colorless, tasteless, insoluble in water, oil,\r\nalcohol, or ether. It is heavier than water. Sulphuric acid is capable\r\nof converting it into grape, or starch sugar. In its fresh and succulent\r\nstate cellulose is digestible and nutritious; but in the form of\r\nligneous tissue it opposes a very great resistance to the action of the\r\ndigestive fluids.  Digestible cellulose is probably equal in nutritive\r\npower to starch.\r\n\r\n_Oils and fats_ occur abundantly in vegetables, more particularly in\r\ntheir seeds. In the seeds of many cruciferous plants the proportion\r\nof fat and oil exceeds 35 per cent. The oils and fats termed _fixed_\r\nare those which possess the greatest interest to agriculturists; the\r\n_volatile oils_ being those which confer on certain plants their\r\nfragrant odour. There are a great variety of vegetable oils, but\r\nthe proximate constituents of most of them are chiefly _stearin_,\r\n_margarin_, _olein_, and _palmitin_.\r\n\r\n_Stearin_ is a white crystalline substance, sparingly soluble in alcohol\r\nand ether, but insoluble in water. There are two or three modifications\r\nof this substance, but they do not essentially differ from each other.\r\nThe melting point varies from 130 deg. to 160 deg. Fahr. Stearin is the most\r\nabundant of the fats.\r\n\r\n_Margarin_ presents the appearance of pearly scales. It is the solid fat\r\npresent in olive oil, and it is also met with in a great variety of fats\r\nand oils. It melts at 116 deg. Fahr.\r\n\r\n_Olein_ is the fluid constituent of oils and fatty substances. It\r\nresists an extreme degree of cold, without solidifying. There are\r\nseveral modifications of this body--the olein of olive oil being\r\nsomewhat different from that of castor oil; the olein of linseed is\r\nsometimes termed _linolien_.\r\n\r\n_Palmitin._--This fat occurs in many plants, but as it makes up the\r\ngreat bulk of palm oil, it has been termed palmitin. It is white, and\r\nmay be obtained in feathery-like masses. Its melting point varies from\r\n114 deg. to 145 deg., there being, according to Duffy, three modifications of\r\nthis substance.\r\n\r\nThe fats and oils are lighter than water. They contain far more carbon\r\nand hydrogen, and less oxygen, than are found in the sugars and\r\nstarches. They all consist of acids (stearic, palmitic, &c.) united with\r\nglycerine. On being boiled with potash or soda, the latter take the\r\nplace of the glycerine, which is set free, and a _soap_ is produced.\r\nThe fatty acids strongly resemble the fats. In nutritive power, one part\r\nof fat is equal to 2-1/2 parts of starch or sugar.\r\n\r\nThe Albuminous substances contain, in addition to the elements found\r\nin starch, nitrogen, sulphur, and phosphorus. _Albumen_, _fibrin_, and\r\n_legumin_ constitute the three important members of the \"Nitrogenous\"\r\nconstituents of plants.\r\n\r\n_Albumen_ is an uncrystallizable substance. It is soluble in water,\r\nunless when heated to 140 deg. Fahr., at which temperature it coagulates,\r\n_i.e._, becomes solid and insoluble. The _gluten_ of wheat is composed\r\nchiefly of albumen, and of bodies closely allied to that substance.\r\n\r\n_Fibrin_, when dried, is a hard, horny, yellow, solid body. It contains\r\na little more oxygen than is found in albumen. This substance is best\r\nknown as a constituent of animals, and it does not appear to be abundant\r\nin plants. The portion of the gluten of wheat-flour, which is insoluble\r\nin boiling alcohol, is considered by Liebig and Dumas to be coagulated\r\nfibrin.\r\n\r\nIn the seeds of leguminous and a few other kinds of plants large\r\nquantities of a substance termed _legumin_ are found. It resembles the\r\ncasein, or cheesy ingredient of milk; indeed, some chemists consider it\r\nto be identical in composition with that substance. When pure, it is\r\npearly white, insoluble in boiling water, but soluble in cold water and\r\nin vinegar. The saline matters found in plants are always associated\r\nwith the albuminous bodies; the latter, therefore, form the bones as\r\nwell as the muscles of animals.\r\n\r\nA great many substances are found in plants, such as wax, mannite,\r\n\"extractive matter,\" citric, malic, and other acids, of the nutritive\r\nvalue of which very little is known. The substances described in this\r\nsection constitute, however, at least 95 per cent. of the weight of the\r\nvegetable matters used as food by live stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nGREEN FOOD.\r\n\r\n_The Grasses._--More than one-half the area of Great Britain and Ireland\r\nis under pasture; the grasses, therefore, constitute the most important\r\nand abundant food used by live stock. The composition of the natural\r\nand artificial grasses is greatly influenced by the nature of the soil\r\non which they are grown, and by the climatic conditions under which\r\nthey are developed. Many of them are almost worthless, whilst others\r\npossess a high nutritive value. Amongst the most useful natural\r\ngrasses may be enumerated Italian rye-grass, Meadow barley, Annual\r\nMeadow-grass, Crested dogstail-grass, Cocksfoot-grass, Timothy or\r\nMeadow catstail-grass, and Sweet vernal-grass. Amongst grasses of medium\r\nquality I may mention common Oatlike-grass, Meadow foxtail grass, Smooth\r\nand rough stalked Meadow-grass, and Waterwhorl-grass. There are very\r\nmany grasses which are almost completely innutritious, and which ought,\r\nunder no circumstances, to be tolerated, although too often they make\r\nup the great bulk of the herbage of badly-managed meadows and pastures.\r\nSuch grasses are, the Meadow soft-grass, Creeping soft-grass, False\r\nbrome-grass, and Upright brome-grass. The rough-stalked Meadow-grass,\r\nthough spoken favorably of by some farmers, is hardly worthy of\r\ncultivation, and the same may be said of many of the grasses which have\r\na place in our meadows and pastures. (See \"Analyses of Natural Grasses\r\nin a Fresh State, by Dr. Voelcker,\" on next page.)\r\n\r\nThe _Schraeder brome_ is a perennial lately introduced into France. It\r\nis described as an exceedingly valuable forage crop, and one which is\r\nadmirably adapted for the feeding of dairy cows. It would be desirable\r\nto give it a trial in these countries. The composition (which is very\r\npeculiar) of this plant is stated to be as follows, when dry:--\r\n\r\n  ANALYSIS OF SCHRAEDER BROME HAY.\r\n\r\n  Water                             16.281\r\n  Nitrogenous matters               23.443\r\n  Fat                                3.338\r\n  Starch gum, &c.                   22.549\r\n  Cellulose (fibre)                 19.843\r\n  Ashes                             14.546\r\n                                   -------\r\n         Total                     100.000\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANALYSES OF NATURAL GRASSES IN A FRESH STATE, BY DR.

The nature of the\r\nsoil influences, to a great extent, the composition of this plant: this\r\nno doubt accounts for the somewhat discrepant result of the analyses of\r\nit made by Way, Voelcker, and Anderson.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the Vetch, Sainfoin, and Lucerne, resembles very\r\nclosely that of the Clover: indeed, it appears to me that all these\r\nleguminous plants are nearly equally valuable as green forage, but that\r\nthe best adapted for hay is the Clover.

The grasses, and more\r\nespecially the so-called artificial grasses, are more nutritious and\r\ndigestible when young. In old clover the proportion of insoluble woody\r\nfibre is often so considerable as to greatly detract from the alimental\r\nvalue of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe _Lentils_, the _Birdsfoot_, the _Trefoil_, and the _Melilot_ are\r\nleguminous plants which occasionally are found as constituents of forage\r\ncrops. Lentils are extensively cultivated on the Continent, and are\r\nthe only kind of these plants the chemistry of which has been at all\r\nstudied. The straw contains 7 per cent. of flesh-formers.\r\n\r\n_The Yellow Lupine_ is cultivated rather extensively in Germany,\r\nFrance, and Belgium, partly for feeding purposes, partly to furnish a\r\ngreen manure. Its seeds constitute a nutritious article of food for man,\r\nand its stems and leaves are given to cattle. An attempt was made a few\r\nyears ago to introduce its cultivation, as a field crop, into England,\r\nand very satisfactory results attended the first trials made with it.\r\nMr. Kimber, who has cultivated this crop, states that it is likely to\r\nprove valuable on light sandy soils, where the ordinary green fodder\r\ncrops are not easily cultivated. The produce per acre obtained in\r\nMr. Kimber's trial was about nineteen tons. Cattle and sheep relish\r\nthe Yellow Lupine, but according to Mr. Kimber, pigs reject it.\r\nProfessor Voelcker examined this plant, and found that it resembled in\r\ncomposition the ordinary artificial grasses, except in one respect,\r\nnamely, a remarkable deficiency in sugar. Altogether, it is not so rich\r\nin nutriment as any of the commonly cultivated leguminous plants; but\r\nas it can be cultivated on a very poor soil, and gives a good return,\r\nit is probable that the Yellow Lupine will yet become a common crop in\r\nBritain. The following table exhibits the results of Dr. Voelcker's\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF YELLOW LUPINES (CUT DOWN IN A GREEN STATE).\r\n\r\n                                      In natural state.

Many persons believe\r\nit to be a useful food. Its composition, which looks favorable, is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                         84.78\r\n  Albuminous matters             2.18\r\n  Fatty matters                  0.56\r\n  Starch, gum, &c.               6.08\r\n  Woody fibre                    5.10\r\n  Mineral matter                 1.30\r\n\r\nThe grasses, natural and artificial, are occasionally affected by a\r\nformidable and well-known fungus, the _ergot_. Italian rye-grass is the\r\nmost liable to the ravages of this pest, and there are on record several\r\ncases in which ergotted rye-grass proved fatal to the animal fed upon\r\nit. Clover and the various leguminous plants appear more liable to the\r\nergot disease than the natural grasses (except rye-grass), but I have\r\non several occasions noticed this fungus on the spikelets of _Hordeum\r\npratense_, _Festuca pratense_, and _Bromus erectus_. It has also been\r\nnoticed that rye-grass rapidly developed under the influence of liquid\r\nmanure is so rank that young animals fed upon it are poisonously\r\naffected. Alderman Mechi states that in July, 1864, ten out of his\r\nthirty Shorthorn calves died in consequence of eating the heads of\r\nItalian rye-grass, and that the survivors' health was seriously injured.\r\nHe was also unfortunate with his lambs, which, during the same month,\r\nwere folded on Italian rye-grass. \"Four days ago,\" writes the Alderman,\r\n\"it was sewaged, having been prior to the former growth also guanoed.\r\nIn four days it had grown from four to five inches, was of an intense\r\ngreen, and pronounced to be, by sharp practical men, just the food for\r\nlambs. Well, we put on our lambs, taking care to do so in the evenings\r\nafter they had been well fed. My bailiff accompanied them, and, within\r\nfive minutes, turning accidentally round, he saw two of the lambs with\r\ntheir heads in the air staggering (stomach staggers it is called) and\r\nfrothing at the mouth. He immediately saw the mischief, removed the\r\nlambs, and on their way back to a bare fold some of them vomited the\r\nItalian rye-grass that they had just eaten, accompanied by frothy slime;\r\nothers brought it up during the night. Some of them trembled, gaped,\r\nand showed all the same symptoms that my calves had done, such as rapid\r\npulse, &c. Two or three of them are rather queer to-day. I hope that\r\nProfessor Simmonds or some capable person will tell us how this is? If\r\nwe mow this grass, bring it home, and cut it into chaff, all which tends\r\nto heat or dry it, it becomes wholesome food. The same remarks apply in\r\ndegree to very succulent tares. If the Italian grass is brought home and\r\ngiven long and quite fresh to the calves, it will kill them. It does not\r\nappear to injure old ewes as it does lambs or shearlings. The dry\r\nweather has something to do with it. In wet weather the evil is much\r\ndiminished, or disappears.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the juice of this poisonous herbage was extremely\r\nrich in matters only semi-organised, and perhaps abounded in the crude\r\nsubstances from which the vegetable tissues are elaborated. Such\r\nrank grass as this was should not be used until it has attained to a\r\ntolerably developed state: in mature plants the juices contain more\r\nhighly organised matters than are found in young vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe _Sorghuo_, _or Holcus Saccharatus_.--This plant, introduced to\r\nthe notice of the British farmer but a few years ago, is only grown\r\nin these countries in small quantities. It is very rich in sugar, and\r\ncattle relish it greatly. Its composition, according to Dr. Voelcker,\r\nis as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                    81.80\r\n  Albuminous matters                                        1.53\r\n  Insoluble ditto                                           0.66\r\n  Sugar                                                     5.85\r\n  Wax and fatty matter                                      2.55\r\n  Mucilage, pectin, and digestible matters                  2.59\r\n  Indigestible woody fibre                                  4.03\r\n  Mineral matter                                            0.99\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nThe plants referred to in the above analysis were cut in September.\r\nIt is found that the composition of the plant is very different at\r\ndifferent seasons.\r\n\r\n_Green Rye_ is employed as a forage crop, for which purpose it is well\r\nadapted. It is about equal in nutritive power to clover. According to\r\nDr. Voelcker its composition is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                   75.423\r\n  Flesh-formers                                            2.705\r\n  Fatty matter                                             0.892\r\n  Gum, pectin, sugar, &c.                                  9.134\r\n  Woody-fibre                                             10.488\r\n  Mineral matter                                           1.358\r\n                                                         -------\r\n                                                         100.000\r\n\r\n_Buckwheat_ is occasionally cut in a green state and used as food for\r\nstock. Its composition, according to Einhof and Crome, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                     82.5\r\n  Nitrogenous compounds                                      0.2\r\n  Extractive matters                                         2.6\r\n  Starch, &c.                                                4.7\r\n  Cellulose                                                 10.0\r\n                                                           -----\r\n                                                           100.0\r\n\r\nRape is one of our most valuable plants for stock feeding. Two varieties\r\nare cultivated in these countries--the summer rape (_Brassica Campestris\r\noleifera_) and winter rape (_Brassica rapus_). The great utility of\r\nrape arises from the circumstance of its being generally obtained as a\r\n_stolen_ crop; for otherwise it is not quite equal to other plants that\r\nmight be substituted for it--cabbages, &c. This plant is very rich in\r\noily matters, and has been found well adapted both for the feeding of\r\ncattle and the fattening of sheep. Its composition, according to\r\nVoelcker, is shown in this table:--\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF GREEN RAPE.\r\n\r\n  Water                                                   87.050\r\n  Flesh-formers                                            3.133\r\n  Fatty matters                                            0.649\r\n  Other respiratory substances                             4.000\r\n  Woody fibre                                              3.560\r\n  Mineral matter (ash)                                     1.608\r\n                                                         -------\r\n                                                         100.000\r\n\r\nWith respect to the value of rape for the feeding of stock in spring,\r\nMr. Rham makes the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n    If the crop is very forward it may be slightly fed off, but in\r\n    general it is best to let it remain untouched till spring. In the\r\n    end of March and the beginning of April it will be a great help\r\n    to the ewes and lambs. It will produce excellent food till it\r\n    begins to be in flower, when it should immediately be ploughed up.\r\n    The ground will be found greatly recruited by this crop, which has\r\n    taken nothing from it, and has added much by the dung and urine of\r\n    the sheep. Whatever be the succeeding crop, it cannot fail to be\r\n    productive; and if the land is not clean, the farmer must have\r\n    neglected the double opportunity of destroying weeds in the\r\n    preceding summer, and in the early part of spring. If the rape is\r\n    fed off in time, it may be succeeded by barley or oats, with clover\r\n    or grass seeds, or potatoes, if the soil is not too wet. Thus no\r\n    crop will be lost, and the rape will have been a clear addition to\r\n    the produce of the land. Any crop which is taken off the land in a\r\n    green state, especially if it be fed off with sheep, may be repeated\r\n    without risk of failure, provided the land be properly tilled; but\r\n    where cole or rape have produced seed, they cannot be profitably\r\n    sown in less than five or six years after on the same land. The\r\n    cultivation of rape or cole for spring food cannot be too strongly\r\n    recommended to the farmers of heavy clay soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mustard Plant_ is occasionally used as food for sheep, for which\r\npurpose its composition shows it to be well adapted. Voelcker's analysis\r\nproves it to be very rich, relatively, in muscle-forming elements and in\r\nmineral matters; it might, therefore be with advantage combined with\r\nfood relatively deficient in these principles.\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF FRESH MUSTARD.\r\n\r\n  Water                                                    86.30\r\n  Albuminous matters                                        2.87\r\n  Non-nitrogenous matters (gum, sugar, oil, &c.)            4.40\r\n  Woody fibre                                               4.39\r\n  Ash                                                       2.04\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\n_The Prickly Comfrey_ has been recommended as a good forage plant.\r\nIt yields an abundant crop--or rather crops, for it may be cut several\r\ntimes in the year. The plant is a handsome one, and it might combine the\r\nuseful with the ornamental if it were cultivated on demesne or villa\r\nfarms. Dr. Voelcker states its composition to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                   88.400\r\n  Flesh-forming substances                                 2.712\r\n  Heat and fat-producing matters                           6.898\r\n  Ash                                                      1.990\r\n                                                         -------\r\n                                                         100.000\r\n\r\n_Chicory_ is used as a forage crop on the Continent, and Professor John\r\nWilson surmises that it may yet be generally cultivated for this purpose\r\nin Great Britain. At present it is rarely grown except for the sake of\r\nits roots, which are used as partial substitutes for, or adulterants of,\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF CHICORY, ACCORDING TO ANDERSON.\r\n\r\n                                      Fresh roots.

It possesses astringent properties. Some writers have\r\nrecommended it as a good crop for warrens and sands. Its composition,\r\naccording to Way, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  DRIED YARROW.\r\n\r\n  Albuminous matter                      10.34\r\n  Fatty matters                           2.51\r\n  Starch, gum, &c.                       45.46\r\n  Woody fibre                            32.69\r\n  Mineral matter                          9.00\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                        100.00\r\n\r\n_Melons_ and _Marrows_ have been used, but to a very limited extent, as\r\nfood for stock. Mr. Blundell advocates their use in seasons of drought.\r\nHe states that he has obtained more than forty tons per acre of both\r\nmelons and marrows. They are relished by horses, oxen, sheep, and pigs.\r\nMr. Blundell's advocacy has not been attended with much success, but it\r\nwould be desirable to give these vegetables a further trial.\r\n\r\nDr. Voelcker's analysis of the cattle melon shows that it contains:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                  92.98\r\n  Albuminous matters                      1.53\r\n  Oil                                      .73\r\n  Sugar, gum, &c.                         2.51\r\n  Fibre                                   1.65\r\n  Ash                                      .60\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                        100.00\r\n\r\n_The Cabbage._--The composition of the Drumhead Cabbage has been studied\r\nby Dr. Anderson. He found a larger proportion of nutriment in the outer\r\nleaves than in the \"heart,\" and ascertained that the young plants were\r\nricher in nutriment than those more advanced in age.

This crop\r\nyields a much greater return than that afforded by the Swedish turnip,\r\nand it is richer in nutritive matter. Cabbages are greedily eaten by\r\nsheep and cattle, and the butter of cows fed upon them is quite free\r\nfrom the disagreeable flavor which it so often possesses when the food\r\nof the animal is chiefly composed of turnips. If the cabbage admitted of\r\nstoring, no more valuable crop could be cultivated as food for stock.\r\n\r\nMr. John M'Laren, of Inchture, Scotland, gives in the \"Transactions of\r\nthe Highland Agricultural Society of Scotland for 1857,\" a report on the\r\nfeeding value of cabbage, which is highly favorable to that plant:--\r\n\r\n    On the 1st December, 1855 (says the reporter), two lots of\r\n    Leicester wethers, bred on the farm, and previously fed alike,\r\n    each lot containing ten sheep, were selected for the trial by\r\n    competent judges, and weighed. Both lots were put into a field\r\n    of well-sheltered old lea, having a division between them. All\r\n    the food was cut and given them in troughs, three times a day.\r\n    They had also a constant supply of hay in racks.\r\n\r\n    At the end of the trial, on the 1st of March, 1856, the sheep\r\n    were all re-weighed, sent to the Edinburgh market, and sold same\r\n    day, but in their separate lots. As I had no opportunity of\r\n    getting the dead weights, I requested Mr. Swan, the salesman, to\r\n    give his opinion on their respective qualities. This was to the\r\n    effect that no difference existed in their market value, but that\r\n    the sheep fed on turnips would turn out the best quality of mutton,\r\n    with most profit for the butcher. Both lots were sold at the same\r\n    price, viz., 52s. 6d. During the three months of trial, we found\r\n    that each lot consumed about the same weight of food--viz., 8 tons\r\n    13 cwt. 47 lb. of cabbage, being at the rate of 21-1/3 lbs. per day\r\n    for each sheep, and 8 tons 10 cwt. 7 lb. Swedes, being at the rate\r\n    of 20-9/10 lb. per day.\r\n\r\n    It will be seen, by referring to the table (see next page), that in\r\n    this trial the Swede has proved of higher value for feeding purposes\r\n    than the cabbage, making 11 st. 4 lb. of gain in weight, whilst the\r\n    cabbage made 10 st. 9 lb. At the same time, 3 cwt. 40 lb. less food\r\n    were consumed; and taking the mutton gained at 6d. per lb., the\r\n    Swedes consumed become worth 9s. 3-1/4d. per ton, while the gain on\r\n    the cabbage, at the same rate, makes them worth 8s. 7d. per ton.\r\n    But from the great additional weight of the one crop grown over the\r\n    other, the balance, at the prices, c., mentioned, is in favor of the\r\n    cabbage by L1 15s. 11-3/4d. per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese results certainly speak strongly in favor of the cabbage; but the\r\nweight of the acreable crop of cabbages stated in the table appears to\r\nbe unusually great. So heavy a crop is rarely obtained.\r\n\r\n_Furze_ (_Gorse, or Whins_).--Notwithstanding the natural historical\r\nknowledge of Goldsmith, his poetical description of the furze is far\r\nfrom accurate. This plant, instead of being \"unprofitably gay,\" deserves\r\nto rank amongst the most valuable vegetables cultivated for the use of\r\nthe domestic animals. It grows and flourishes under conditions which\r\nmost injuriously affect almost every other kind of fodder and green\r\ncrop. Prolonged drought in spring and early summer not unfrequently\r\nrenders the hay crop a scanty one; while autumn and winter frosts change\r\nthe nutriment of the mangels and turnips into decaying and unwholesome\r\nmatter. Under such circumstances as these, the maintenance of cattle in\r\ngood condition is very expensive, unless in places where a supply of\r\nfurze is available. This plant is rather improved than otherwise by\r\nexposure to a temperature which would speedily destroy a mangel or a\r\nturnip; and, although it thrives best when abundantly supplied with\r\nrain, it can survive an exceedingly prolonged drought without sustaining\r\nmuch injury.\r\n\r\n  TABLE\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE DIFFERENCE OF WEIGHT GROWN ON AN ACRE OF CABBAGE AND AN\r\n  ACRE OF SWEDES, AND THE VALUE OF EACH FOR FEEDING.\r\n\r\n  +-----+-------+---------+---------+--------+--------+--------------+--------+\r\n  | No. |       | Weight  | Weight  |        |Value of| Total Weight |        |\r\n  | Of  |       |  of     |   of    |        |  Gain  |   of Food    | Value  |\r\n  |Sheep| Kinds |  Ten    |  Ten    |        | taking |   consumed   | of Food|\r\n  | In  |  of   | Sheep,  | Sheep,  |  Gain. | Mutton |     in       |consumed|\r\n  |Each | Food. |1st Dec.,|1st Mar.,|        | at 6d. | Three Months |  per   |\r\n  |Lot. |       |  1855.  |  1856.  |        |per lb. | by each lot. |  Ton.  |\r\n  +-----+-------+---------+---------+--------+--------+--------------+--------+\r\n  |     |       | st. lb. | st. lb. | st. lb.| L s. d.|tons. cwt. lb.|s. d.   |\r\n  | 10  |Cabbage| 90  10  | 101  5  | 10   9 | 3 14 6 |  8   13   47 |8  7    |\r\n  |     |       |         |         |        |        |              |        |\r\n  | 10  |Swedes | 89   3  | 100  7  | 11   4 | 3 19 0 |  8   10    7 |9  3-1/4|\r\n  +-----+-------+---------+---------+--------+--------+--------------+--------+\r\n\r\n  +-----+-------+----------+------------+----------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | No. |       |  Total   |            |          |             |            |\r\n  | Of  |       |  Weight  |    Value   |   Extra  |    Free     |   Balance  |\r\n  |Sheep| Kinds |   per    |   of each  |  Cost on |    Value    |  in favor  |\r\n  | In  |  of   |  Acre    |     Crop   | each Crop|   of each   |     of     |\r\n  |Each | Food. | of each  |  per Acre. | per Acre.|    Crop     |   Cabbage  |\r\n  |Lot. |       |  Crop.   |            |          |  per Acre.  |  per Acre. |\r\n  +-----+-------+----------+------------+----------+-------------+------------+\r\n  |     |       |tons. cwt.| L  s. d.   | L  s.  d.| L  s. d.    | L s. d.    |\r\n  | 10  |Cabbage| 42   14  | 18 6  6    | 4  10 11 | 13 15 7     |            |\r\n  |     |       |          |            |          |             | 1 15 11-3/4|\r\n  | 10  |Swedes | 26   12  | 12 6  7-1/4| 0   7  0 | 11 19 7-1/4 |            |\r\n  +-----+-------+----------+------------+----------+-------------+------------+\r\n\r\nThe furze is a member of the family _Leguminosae_, which includes so many\r\nuseful plants, such as, for example, the pea, the bean, and the clovers.\r\nThere are three varieties of it met with in this country--namely, the\r\ncommon furze, _Ulex europaeus_, the dwarf furze, _Ulex nanus_, and the\r\nIrish, or upright furze, _Ulex strictus_.\r\n\r\nThe common furze is a hardy shrub, and grows luxuriantly at an elevation\r\nfar higher than the limits of cereal cultivation. It flourishes on any\r\nkind of soil which is moderately dry, and heavy crops may easily be\r\nraised on uplands almost incapable of producing grass. The dwarf furze\r\nis never cultivated, but as it grows at a still greater elevation, and\r\non a poorer soil than the larger varieties, it might be profitably\r\ncultivated on very high uplands. The Irish furze yields a softer and\r\nless prickly food than the other kinds, but as it does not usually bear\r\nseed, and must therefore be propagated by cuttings, its cultivation has\r\nhitherto been limited to but a few localities.\r\n\r\nThe produce of an acre of furze appears to be at least equal to that\r\nof an acre of good meadow. The Rev. Mr. Townsend of Aghada, county of\r\nCork--the most zealous and successful advocate for the cultivation of\r\nthis plant--informed me that he had obtained so much as 14 tons per\r\nacre; a fact which proves that the furze is a plant which is well\r\ndeserving of the attention of the farmer.\r\n\r\nFurze is an excellent food for every kind of stock. Cattle, although\r\nthey may at first appear not to relish its prickly shoots, soon acquire\r\na fondness for it. I have known several instances of herds being fed\r\nalmost if not entirely on the bruised plant, and to keep in good\r\ncondition. The late Professor Murphy, of Cork, stated that on the farm\r\nof Mr. Boulger, near Mallow, thirty-five cows were fed on crushed furze,\r\nwhich they \"devoured voraciously.\" Each animal received daily from four\r\nto six stones of the crushed plant, to which were added a little turnip\r\npulp and a small quantity of oats. The milk and butter yielded by these\r\ncows were considered excellent. In a letter addressed to me by a very\r\nintelligent feeder, Mr. John Walsh,[28] of Stedalt, county of Dublin,\r\nthe following remarks in relation to this subject are made:--\r\n\r\n    I had lately an opportunity of seeing a herd of cattle of about\r\n    sixty head, of which twenty had been fed with furze prepared with\r\n    my machine for about six weeks before being put out to grass. The\r\n    condition of these was so superior that I pointed out every one of\r\n    them, one after the other, out of the herd. The owner of the cattle\r\n    had made the same observation; it was new to him but not to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurze is seldom given to sheep or pigs, but I believe that it might with\r\nadvantage enter into the dietary of those animals. Some of my friends\r\nwho have lately tried it with pigs report favorably as to its effects.\r\nHorses partly fed upon this plant keep in good condition; it is usually\r\ngiven to them cut merely into lengths of half an inch or an inch, but it\r\nwould be better to give it to them finely bruised. A horse during the\r\nnight will eat a much larger quantity of coarsely cut furze than of the\r\nwell bruised article, because he is obliged to expend a great deal of\r\nmuscular power in bruising the furze, and must, consequently, use an\r\nadditional quantity of the food to make up for the corresponding waste\r\nof tissue.\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently, the chemistry of the furze was very little\r\nstudied. The analysis of this plant made many years ago by Sprengel\r\ngave results which, in the present advanced condition of agricultural\r\nchemistry, are quite valueless. The late Professor Johnston merely\r\ndetermined its amount of water, organic matter, and ash. I believe I was\r\nthe first to make a complete investigation into the composition of this\r\nplant according to the methods of modern chemical analysis. I made two\r\nexaminations. The first was of shoots cut on the 25th April, 1860, on\r\nthe lands of Mr. Walsh of Stedalt, near Balbriggan, in the county of\r\nDublin. The shoots were, in great part, composed of that year's growth,\r\nwith a small proportion of the shoots of the previous year. They were\r\nvery moist, and their spines, or thorns, were rather soft.

No doubt, most\r\nfeeders are practically acquainted with the relative value of corn and\r\noil-cake--of Swedish turnips and white turnips; but their knowledge of\r\nthe food equivalents of many other substances is still very defective.\r\nFor example, every farmer is not aware that Indian corn is a more\r\neconomical food than beans for fattening cattle, and less so for beasts\r\nof burthen. Locust-beans, oat-dust, malt-combings, and many other\r\narticles, occasionally consumed by stock, have not, as yet, determinate\r\nplaces assigned to them in the feeder's scale of food equivalents.\r\n\r\nThe points involved in the economic feeding of stock are not quite\r\nso simple as some farmers, more especially those of the amateur\r\nclass, appear to believe. There are many feeders who sell their\r\nhalf-finished cattle at a profit, and yet they cannot, without loss,\r\nconvert their stock into those obese monsters which are so much\r\nadmired at agricultural shows. The complete fattening of cattle is\r\na losing business with some feeders, and a profitable one with others.\r\nStall-feeding is a branch of rural economy which, perhaps more than any\r\nother, requires the combination of \"science with practice;\" yet how few\r\nfeeders are there who have the slightest knowledge of the composition of\r\nfood substances, or who are agreed as to the feeding value, absolute or\r\nrelative, of even such well-known materials as oil-cake, straw, or oats!\r\n\"It is thus seen how inexact are the equivalents which are understood to\r\nbe established for the different foods used for the maintenance of the\r\nanimals. It is equally plain, when we reflect on the different methods\r\npursued for the preservation of the animals, that we are still far\r\nfrom having attained that perfection towards which our efforts tend.\r\nVisit one hundred farms, taken by chance in different parts of the\r\ncountry, and you will find in each, methods directly opposite--a totally\r\npeculiar manner of managing the stalls; you will see, in short, that the\r\nconditions of food, of treatment, and of hygiene, remain not understood\r\nin seven-eighths of rural farms.\"[29]\r\n\r\nThe straws of the cereal and leguminous plants are a striking\r\nillustration of the erroneous opinions and practices which prevail\r\namongst agriculturists with respect to particular branches of their\r\ncalling. The German farmers regard straw as the most valuable\r\nconstituent of home-made fertilisers, and their leases in general\r\nprohibit their selling off the straw produced on their farms. Yet\r\nchemical analysis has clearly proved that the manurial value of straw is\r\nperfectly insignificant, and that, as a constituent of stable manure, it\r\nis chiefly useful as an absorbent of the liquid egesta of the animals\r\nlittered upon it. As food for stock, straw was at one time regarded by\r\nour farmers as almost perfectly innutritious; some even went so far as\r\nto declare that it possessed no nutriment whatever, and even those who\r\nused it, did so more with the view of correcting the too watery nature\r\nof turnips, than with the expectation of its being assimilated to the\r\nanimal body. Within the last few years, however, straw has been largely\r\nemployed by several of the most intelligent and successful feeders in\r\nEngland, who report so favorably upon it as an economical feeding stuff,\r\nthat it has risen considerably in the estimation of a large section\r\nof the agricultural public. Now, even without adopting the very high\r\nopinion which Mechi and Horsfall entertain relative to the nutritive\r\npower of straw, I am altogether disposed to disagree with those who\r\naffirm that its application should be restricted to manurial purposes.\r\nUnless under circumstances where there is an urgent demand for straw as\r\nlitter, that article should be used as food for stock, for which purpose\r\nit will be found, if of good quality, and given in a proper state, a\r\nmost economical kind of dry fodder--equal, if not superior to hay, when\r\nthe prices of both articles are considered.\r\n\r\nThe composition of straw is very different from that of grain.\r\nThe former contains no starch, but it includes an exceedingly high\r\nproportion of woody fibre; the latter is in great part composed of\r\nstarch, and contains but an insignificant amount of woody fibre. Dr.\r\nVoelcker, the consulting chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society of\r\nEngland, and Dr. Anderson, chemist to the Highland and Agricultural\r\nSociety of Scotland, have made a large number of analyses of the straws\r\nof the cereal and leguminous plants, the results of which are of the\r\nhighest interest to the agriculturist. In the following tables the more\r\nimportant results of these investigations are given:--\r\n\r\n  ANALYSES OF STRAW, BY DR.

We learn from them that straw is more\r\nnutritious when it is cut in the ripe state than when it is permitted\r\nto over-ripen, and that _green_ straw contains a far greater amount of\r\nnutriment than is found even in the ripe article. It appears also that\r\nthe least nutritious kind of straw equals the best variety of turnips in\r\nits amount of flesh-forming principles, and greatly exceeds them in its\r\nproportion of fat-forming elements. We further learn that in general the\r\ndifferent kinds of straw will be found to stand in the following order,\r\nthe most nutritious occupying the highest, and the least nutritious the\r\nlowest place:--\r\n\r\n  1. Pea-haulm.\r\n  2. Oat-straw.\r\n  3. Bean-straw with the pods.\r\n  4. Barley-straw.\r\n  5. Wheat-straw.\r\n  6. Bean-stalks without the pods.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter to be regretted that we possess so little accurate\r\nknowledge of the chemical composition of the plants cultivated in\r\nIreland. No doubt the analyses of English grown wheat, beans, mangels,\r\nand other plants, serve to give us a general idea of the nature of those\r\nvegetables when produced in this country. But this kind of information,\r\nthough very important, must necessarily be defective, as differences\r\nin climate modify--often to a considerable extent--the composition of\r\nalmost every vegetable. Thus, the results of Anderson's analyses prove\r\nScotch oats to be superior, as a feeding stuff, to Scotch barley,\r\nwhilst, according to Voelcker and the experience of most English\r\nfeeders, the barley of parts of England is superior to its oats. It\r\nfollows, then, that whilst the results of the analyses of straw, made by\r\nVoelcker and Anderson are of great interest to the Irish farmer, they\r\nwould be still more important to him had the straw to which they relate\r\nbeen the produce of Irish soil. In order, therefore, to enable the Irish\r\nfarmer to form a correct estimate of the value of his straw, we should\r\nput him in possession of a more perfect knowledge of its composition\r\nthan that which is derivable from the investigations to which I have\r\nreferred. The straws of the cereals--which alone are used here to any\r\nextent--should be analysed as carefully and as frequently as those of\r\nGreat Britain have been; and if such were done, I have no doubt but that\r\nthe results would indicate a decided difference in composition between\r\nthe produce of the two countries. Some time ago I entered upon what, at\r\nthe time, I had intended should be a complete investigation into the\r\ncomposition of Irish straws; but which want of time prevented me from\r\nmaking more than a partial one. The results are given in the following\r\ntables:--\r\n\r\n  ANALYSES OF IRISH OAT-STRAW.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------+--------+------------------------------\r\n                                  | No. 1. |Obtained in the Dublin Market.\r\n                                  |From Co.+---------+---------+----------\r\n                                  |Wicklow.|  No. 2. |  No. 3. |  No. 4.\r\n  --------------------------------+--------+---------+---------+----------\r\n  Water                           |  14.00 |  14.00  |  14.00  |  14.00\r\n  Flesh-forming principles--      |        |         |         |\r\n    _a._ Soluble in water         |   4.08 |   2.02  |   2.04  |   1.46\r\n    _b._ Insoluble in water       |   2.09 |   3.16  |   3.00  |   2.23\r\n  Oil                             |   1.84 |   1.40  |   1.26  |   1.00\r\n  Sugar, gum, and other           |        |         |         |\r\n    fat-forming matters           |  13.79 |  12.67  |  10.18  |  11.16\r\n  Woody fibre                     |  59.96 |  61.79  |  65.45  |  65.29\r\n  Mineral matter                  |   4.24 |   4.96  |   4.07  |   4.86\r\n                                  +--------+---------+---------+----------\r\n                                  | 100.00 | 100.00  | 100.00  | 100.00\r\n  --------------------------------+--------+---------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nAll the specimens of oats, the analyses of which are given in the\r\npreceding table, are assumed to contain 14 per cent. of water, in order\r\nthe more correctly to compare their nutritive value.

They show that properly harvested Irish\r\noat and wheat straws are far more valuable than those of Scotland, and\r\nsomewhat less nutritive than those produced in England. They also\r\nshow that wheat-straw is allowed to over-ripen, by which a very large\r\nproportion of its nutritive principles is eliminated and altogether\r\nlost, and a considerable part of the remainder converted into an\r\ninsoluble, and therefore less easily digestible state. Nor is there any\r\nadvantage to the grain gained by allowing it to remain uncut after the\r\nupper portion of the stem has changed from a green to a yellowish color;\r\non the contrary, it also loses a portion--often a very considerable\r\none--of its nitrogenous, or flesh-forming constituents. It has been\r\nclearly proved that wheat cut when green, yields a greater amount of\r\ngrain, and of a better quality too, than when it is allowed to ripen\r\nfully; yet, how often do we not see fields of wheat in this country\r\nallowed to remain unreaped for many days, and even weeks, after the\r\ncrop has attained to its full development!\r\n\r\nThe oat-straw obtained in the Dublin Market proved less valuable than\r\nthe green straw which I selected myself from a field of oats; but the\r\ndiscrepancy between them was far less than between the nearly ripe\r\nwheat-straw and the straw of that plant purchased in Dublin. During\r\nvisits which I have paid in harvest-time to the North of Ireland, I\r\nnoticed that the oats were generally cut whilst green, whereas wheat was\r\nalmost invariably left standing for at least a week after its perfect\r\nmaturation, probably for the following reasons:--Firstly, because\r\noats are more liable to shed their seed; secondly, because there is\r\na greater breadth of that crop to be reaped, which necessitates an\r\nearly beginning; and, lastly, because most farmers know that over-ripe\r\noat-straw is worth but little for feeding purposes, as compared with\r\nthe greenish-yellow article.\r\n\r\nAs compared with white turnips, the nutritive value of oat-straw stands\r\nvery high, for whilst the former contains but little more than 1 per\r\ncent. of flesh-formers, and less than 5 per cent. of fat-formers, the\r\nlatter includes about 4 per cent. of flesh-formers, and 13 per cent. of\r\nfat-formers. Again, whilst the amount of woody fibre in turnips is only\r\nabout 3 per cent., that substance constitutes no less than 60 per cent.\r\nof oat-straw. In comparison with hay--taking into consideration the\r\nprices of both articles--oat-straw also stands high, as will be seen\r\nby comparing the following analyses of common meadow hay with that of\r\nproperly harvested straw:--\r\n\r\n                                       Meadow Hay.

At one time it was the general belief that woody fibre was\r\nincapable of contributing in the slightest degree to the nutrition of\r\nanimals, but the results of recent investigations prove that it is, to a\r\ncertain extent, digestible. In the summer of 1859 two German chemists,\r\nStoeckhardt and Sussdorf, made a series of experiments, with the view\r\nof ascertaining whether or not the cellulose[30] of the food of the\r\nsheep is assimilated by that animal. The results of this inquiry are of\r\nimportance, seeing that they clearly prove that even the hardest kind of\r\ncellulose--_sclerogen_, in fact--is capable of being assimilated by the\r\nRuminants. The animals selected were two wethers, aged respectively five\r\nand six years. They were fed--firstly, upon hay alone; secondly, upon\r\nhay and rye-straw; thirdly upon hay and the sawdust of poplar wood,\r\nwhich had been exhausted with lye (to induce the sheep to eat the\r\nsawdust, it was found necessary to mix through it some rye-bran and a\r\nlittle salt); fourthly, hay and pine-wood sawdust, to which was added\r\nbran and salt; fifthly, spruce sawdust, bran and salt; sixthly, hay,\r\npulp of linen rags (from the paper-maker), and bran. The experiments\r\nwere carried on from July till November, excepting a short time, during\r\nwhich the animals were turned out on pasture-land, to recover from the\r\ninjurious effects of the fifth series of experiments--produced probably\r\nby the resin of the spruce. The animals, together with their food,\r\ndrink, and egesta, were weighed daily. The amount of cellulose in the\r\nfood was determined, and the proportion of that substance in the egesta\r\nwas also ascertained; and as there was a considerable discrepancy\r\nbetween the two amounts, it was evident that the difference represented\r\nthe weight of the cellulose assimilated by the animals. In this way it\r\nwas ascertained that from 60 to 70 per cent. of the cellulose of hay,\r\n40 to 60 per cent. of the cellulose of straw, 45 to 50 per cent. of the\r\ncellulose of the poplar wood, 30 to 40 per cent. of the cellulose of the\r\npine, and 80 per cent. of the cellulose of the paper pulp was digested.\r\n\r\nIn stating the results of his analyses of the straws, Professor Voelcker\r\nsets down as \"digestible\" that portion of the cellulose which he found\r\nto be soluble in dilute acids and alkaline solutions; but he admits that\r\nthe solvents in the stomach might dissolve a larger amount. The results\r\nof the experiments of Stoeckhardt and Sussdorf prove that 80 per cent. of\r\nthe cellulose of paper (the altered fibre of flax) is assimilable, and\r\nit is, therefore, not unreasonable to infer that the cellulose of a more\r\npalatable substance than paper might be altogether digestible.\r\n\r\nThe facts which I have adduced clearly prove that the straws of the\r\ncereals possess a far higher nutritive power than is commonly ascribed\r\nto them; that when properly harvested they contain from 20 to 40 per\r\ncent. of undoubted nutriment; and lastly, that it is highly probable\r\nthat their so-called indigestible woody fibre is to a great extent\r\nassimilable.\r\n\r\nThe composition of cellulose is nearly, if not quite, identical with\r\nthat of starch, and it may therefore be assumed to be equal in nutritive\r\npower to that substance--that is, it will, if assimilated, be converted\r\ninto four-tenths of its weight of fat. Now as cellulose forms from\r\nsix-tenths to eight-tenths of the weight of straws, it is evident that\r\nif the whole of this substance were digestible, straws would be an\r\nexceedingly valuable fattening food. When straw in an unprepared state\r\nis consumed, there is no doubt but that a large proportion of its\r\ncellulose remains unappropriated--nay more, it is equally certain that\r\nthe hard woody fibre protects, by enveloping them, the soluble and\r\neasily digestible constituents of the straw from the action of the\r\n_gastric juice_. I would, therefore, recommend that straw should be\r\neither cooked or fermented before being made use of; in either of these\r\nstates its constituents are far more digestible than when the straw\r\nis merely cut, or even when it is in the form of chaff. An excellent\r\nmode of treating straw is to reduce it to chaff, subject it to the\r\naction of steam, and mix it with roots and oil-cake or corn. Mr.\r\nLawrence, of Cirencester, one of the most intelligent agriculturists\r\nin England, cooks his chaff, which he largely employs, in the following\r\nmanner:--\"We find that, taking a score of bullocks together fattening,\r\nthey consume, per head per diem, 3 bushels of chaff mixed with just half\r\na hundred-weight of pulped roots, exclusive of cake or corn; that is to\r\nsay, rather more than 2 bushels of chaff are mixed with the roots, and\r\ngiven at two feeds, morning and evening, and the remainder is given\r\nwith the cake, &c., at the middle day feed, thus:--We use the steaming\r\napparatus of Stanley, of Peterborough, consisting of a boiler in the\r\ncentre, in which the steam is generated, and which is connected by a\r\npipe on the left hand with a large galvanised iron receptacle for\r\nsteaming food for pigs, and on the right with a large wooden tub lined\r\nwith copper, in which the cake, mixed with water, is made into a thick\r\nsoup. Adjoining this is a slate tank of sufficient size to contain one\r\nfeed for the entire lot of bullocks feeding. Into this tank is laid\r\nchaff, about one foot deep, upon which a few ladles of soup are thrown\r\nin a _boiling state_; this is thoroughly mixed with the chaff with a\r\nthree-grained fork, and pressed down firm; and this process is repeated\r\nuntil the slate tank is full, when it is covered down for an hour or two\r\nbefore feeding time. The soup is then found entirely absorbed by the\r\nchaff, which has become softened, and prepared for ready digestion.\"\r\nA cheap plan is to mix the straw with sliced roots, moisten the mass\r\nwith water, and allow it to remain until a slight fermentation has set\r\nin. This process effectually softens and disintegrates, so to speak, the\r\nwoody fibre, and sets free the stores of nutritious matters which it\r\nenvelopes. Some farmers who hold straw in high estimation, prefer giving\r\nit just as it comes from the field; they base this practice on the\r\nbelief that Ruminants require a bulky and solid food, and that their\r\ndigestive powers are quite sufficient to effect the solution of all the\r\nuseful constituents of the straw. It may be quite true that cattle, as\r\nasserted, can extract more nutriment out of straw than horses can, but\r\nthat merely proves the greater power of their digestive organs. No doubt\r\nthe food of the Ruminants should be bulky; but I am quite sure that\r\ncooked or fermented straw is sufficiently so to satisfy the desire of\r\nthose animals for quantity in their food.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can learn, all the carefully conducted feeding experiments\r\nto test the value of straw which have been made, have yielded results\r\nhighly favorable to that article. Mr. Blundell, in a paper on \"The Use\r\nand Abuse of Straw,\" read before the Botley (Hampshire) Farmer's Club,\r\nstates that in his experience he found straw to be more economical than\r\nits equivalent of roots or oil-cake, in the feeding of all kinds of\r\ncattle:--\r\n\r\n    I find (says Mr. Blundell) that dairy cows, in the winter months,\r\n    if fed on large quantities of roots, particularly mangels and\r\n    carrots, will refuse to eat straw almost entirely, and become\r\n    very lean; but they will always eat a full portion of sweet,\r\n    well-harvested straw, when they get a small and moderate allowance\r\n    of roots, say, for an ordinary-sized cow, 15 lbs. of mangel three\r\n    times per day, the roots being given whole, just in the state they\r\n    come from the store heap. Again, calves and yearlings being fed\r\n    with roots in the same way, will eat a large quantity of straw, and\r\n    when they have been kept under cover I have had them in first-rate\r\n    condition for many years past. Also, in fattening beasts, when they\r\n    get a fair allowance of roots, say 65 to 70 lbs. per day, with\r\n    from 3 to 4 lbs. of cake or meal in admixture, they will eat straw\r\n    with great avidity, and do well upon it, and make a profit. It is,\r\n    however, often the case that bullocks receive 100 lbs., or upwards,\r\n    of roots per day, with a large quantity of cake or meal, often\r\n    10 or 12 lbs. per day; they will not then look at straw, and are\r\n    obliged to be fed with hay. The cost price of these quantities\r\n    and kinds of food stands so high that the animals do not yield a\r\n    profit; for although they may make meat a little faster, yet the\r\n    proportionate increase is nothing compared to the increased cost\r\n    of the feeding materials used.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Blundell gives us also the tabulated results of one of his\r\nexperiments, which prove that by the use of straw there is to be\r\nobtained something more than manure by the feeding of stock:--\r\n\r\n  COST OF FEEDING AN OX PER WEEK WITH STRAW, ETC.,\r\n  ACCORDING TO MR. BLUNDELL.\r\n\r\n                                                       s.  d.\r\n   4 lbs. of oil-cake per day,\r\n          or 38 lbs. per week, at L10 per ton          2   6\r\n  64 lbs. of roots ditto,\r\n          or 4 cwt. ditto, at 13s. 4d. ditto           2   8\r\n  20 lbs. of straw feeding,\r\n          or 1-1/4 cwt. ditto, at 30s. ditto           1  10-1/2\r\n  20 lbs. of straw litter,\r\n          or 1-1/4 cwt. ditto, at 15s. ditto           0  11\r\n\r\n          Attendance, &c., per week                    0   1\r\n                                                      ----------\r\n                                                       8   0-1/2\r\n          Deduct value of manure, per week             1   3-1/2\r\n                                                      ----------\r\n                                                       6   9\r\n          Increased value of ox per week              10   0\r\n          Deduct cost of feeding                       6   9\r\n                                                      ----------\r\n                                                       3   3\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to the study of the composition of straw regarded from\r\nan economic point of view, we shall find that the theoretical deductions\r\ntherefrom harmonise with the results of actual feeding experiments.

We learn from\r\nthem that we pay L11 for 2,000 lbs. of nutriment, when we purchase a\r\nton of linseed-cake, whereas, when we invest 30s. in a ton of straw, we\r\nreceive 1,000 lbs. of digestible aliment. It cannot be said that I have\r\nstrained any points in favour of the straw; on the contrary, I believe\r\nthat when that article is cut in proper season and well harvested,\r\nits composition will be found far superior to that detailed in the\r\ncomparative analysis. It must be borne in mind, too, that I take no\r\naccount of the 30 per cent. of the so-called indigestible woody fibre\r\nwhich straw contains, and which, I believe, is partly assimilable\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, and could be rendered nearly altogether\r\ndigestible by proper treatment; on the other hand, I have assumed that\r\nthe woody fibre of the oil-cake is completely digestible, although\r\nI believe it is in reality less so than the fibre of straw.\r\n\r\nIt is an important point in the composition of oil-cakes, that they\r\ncontain a large proportion of ready-formed fatty matters which can,\r\nwith but little alteration, be at once transmuted into animal fat.\r\nThere are some individuals of the genus _Homo_ to whose stomachs fat,\r\n_per se_, is intolerable; nevertheless, as a general rule, fatty\r\nsubstances exercise a favorable influence in the process of digestion,\r\nand, either in a separate state, or intimately commingled with other\r\naliments, constitute a large proportion of the food of man. Digestion in\r\nthe lower animals is, no doubt, similarly promoted by mixing with the\r\naliments which are to be subjected to that process, a due proportion of\r\noily or fatty matter. Straw is relatively deficient in the flesh-forming\r\nprinciples, and abounds in the fat-forming elements--of which, however,\r\nthe most valuable, oil, is the least abundant. Now, if we add to straw\r\na due proportion of some substance very rich in flesh-formers and oil,\r\nthe compound will possess in nicely adjusted proportions all the\r\nelements of nutrition. Perhaps the best kind of food which we could\r\nemploy for this purpose is linseed meal. It contains about 24 per\r\ncent. of flesh-formers, 35 per cent. of a very bland oil, and 24 per\r\ncent. of gum, sugar, and mucilage. Linseed-cake may be substituted for\r\nlinseed-meal; but the meal, though its cost is 15 per cent. greater, is,\r\nI believe, rather the better article of the two. Its flesh-formers are\r\nmore soluble, and its oil thrice more abundant and far more palatable\r\nthan the same principles in most samples of oil-cake. An important\r\npoint, too, is, that linseed, unlike linseed-cake, is not liable to\r\nadulteration. As linseed possesses laxative properties it cannot be\r\nlargely employed; the addition, however, of bean-meal--the binding\r\ntendency of which is well known--to a diet partly composed of linseed\r\nwill neutralise, so to speak, the relaxing influence of the oily seed.\r\nIf oil-cakes be used as an adjunct to straw, rape-cake will be found\r\nmore economical than linseed-cake. If it be free from mustard, well\r\nsteamed, and flavored with a little treacle, or a small quantity of\r\nlocust-beans, it will be readily consumed, and even relished, by dairy\r\nand fattening stock.\r\n\r\n_Hay._--There is no food substance more variable or more complex than\r\nhay, for under that term are included, not only mixtures of grasses,\r\nbut also of leguminous plants--clover, for example. The herbage of no\r\ntwo meadows is exactly alike; and the composition of the meadow plants\r\nis so greatly modified by differences of climate, soil, and mode of\r\nculture, that we have nothing to excite our wonder in the extreme\r\nvariability of hay.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the hay made from clover, lucerne, and various other\r\nkinds of artificial grasses, is shown in the table--which is based on\r\nthe results of Way's analyses:--\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF THE HAY OF ARTIFICIAL GRASSES.\r\n\r\n                               +-------------------------------------------\r\n                               | KEY:\r\n                               | A.--Flesh-forming Substances.\r\n                               | B.--Fatty Matters.\r\n                               | C.--Respiratory Substances.\r\n                               | D.--Woody Fibre.\r\n                               | E.--Ash.\r\n                               | F.--Water.\r\n  -----------------------------+-------+------+-------+-------+------+-----\r\n                               |   A.  |  B.  |   C.  |   D.  |  E.  |  F.\r\n                               +-------+------+-------+-------+------+-----\r\n  Trifolium pratense--         |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Red clover                 | 18.79 | 3.06 | 37.06 | 16.46 | 7.97 | 16.6\r\n  Trifolium pratense perenne-- |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Purple clover              | 15.98 | 3.41 | 35.35 | 21.63 | 6.96 |   \"\r\n  Trifolium incarnatum--       |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Crimson clover             | 13.83 | 3.11 | 31.25 | 26.99 | 8.15 |   \"\r\n  Trifolium medium--           |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Cowgrass                   | 20.27 | 2.97 | 30.30 | 20.12 | 9.67 |   \"\r\n  Do., second specimen         | 15.64 | 3.98 | 41.38 | 15.70 | 6.64 |   \"\r\n  Trifolium procumbens--       |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Hop trefoil                | 17.07 | 3.89 | 36.55 | 18.88 | 6.94 |   \"\r\n  Trifolium repens--           |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    White trefoil              | 15.63 | 3.65 | 33.37 | 22.11 | 8.57 |   \"\r\n  Vicia sativa--               |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Common Vetch               | 19.68 | 2.55 | 32.87 | 22.82 | 5.42 |   \"\r\n  Vicia sepium--               |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Bush vetch                 | 19.23 | 2.40 | 27.62 | 25.87 | 8.21 |   \"\r\n  Onobrychis sativa--          |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Sainfoin                   | 15.38 | 2.51 | 38.30 | 20.59 | 6.56 |   \"\r\n  Medicago sativa--            |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Lucerne                    | 10.63 | 2.30 | 33.47 | 28.51 | 8.42 |   \"\r\n  Medicago lupulina--          |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Yellow clover              | 20.50 | 3.38 | 27.76 | 22.66 | 9.03 |   \"\r\n  Plantago lanceolata--        |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Rib grass                  | 11.91 | 3.06 | 33.58 | 27.56 | 7.23 |   \"\r\n  Poterium sanguisorba--       |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Burnet                     | 13.96 | 3.34 | 39.50 | 19.89 | 6.64 |   \"\r\n  Achillea millefolium--       |       |      |       |       |      |\r\n    Millefoil                  |  8.62 | 2.09 | 37.88 | 27.24 | 7.50 |   \"\r\n                               +-------+------+-------+-------+------+-----\r\n         Mean                  | 15.81 | 3.18 | 34.42 | 22.47 | 7.59 | 16.6\r\n  -----------------------------+-------+------+-------+-------+------+-----\r\n\r\nVery many analyses of hay have been made by British and Continental\r\nchemists, the results of which are of great interest to the\r\nagriculturist. The composition of the natural and artificial grasses,\r\nwhich is shown in the tables given in pages 158-9 will, if we reduce\r\ntheir per-centage of water to 16, give us an approximation to the\r\ncomposition of hay. If the herbage, too, be sown in the proper time, and\r\nthe hay-making process be skilfully conducted, there will be but little\r\ndifference, except in the amount of water, between the plants in their\r\nfresh and dry state; but owing to inopportune wet weather, and\r\ncarelessness in manipulation, excellent herbage is not unfrequently\r\nconverted into inferior hay.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Voelcker, the average composition of meadow-hay, as\r\ndeduced from the results of twenty-five analyses, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                    14.61\r\n  Flesh-forming constituents                                8.44\r\n  Respiratory and fatty matters                            43.63\r\n  Woody fibre                                              27.16\r\n  Mineral matter (ash)                                      6.16\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nDr. Anderson's analysis of meadow-hay, one year old, and of inferior\r\nquality, gave the following results:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                    13.13\r\n  Flesh-forming matters                                     4.00\r\n  Non-nitrogenous substances                               77.61\r\n  Mineral matter                                            5.26\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nThe results of the investigations of Way prove that the herbage of\r\nwater-grass meadows is more nutritious than that of dry meadows--results\r\nperfectly harmonious with the experience of practical men.\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat general belief, that the aftermath, or second cutting,\r\nis less nutritious than the first cutting; but there appears to be no\r\nchemical difference between the two crops, provided they be saved under\r\nequally favorable conditions. According to Dr. Anderson, the composition\r\nof clover-hay of the second cutting is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                    16.84\r\n  Flesh-forming principles                                 13.52\r\n  Non-nitrogenous matters                                  64.43\r\n  Mineral matter (ash)                                      5.21\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nI have already shown the importance of reaping in proper season--not\r\nless necessary is it to mow before the plants ripen fully, and even\r\nbefore they flower. The results of the experiments of Stoeckhardt,\r\nHellreigel, and Wolff, in relation to this point, are very interesting,\r\nand are well worthy of reproduction here.\r\n\r\n  RESULTS OF STOeCKHARDT'S AND HELLREIGEL'S EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------+-----------------------++-----------------------\r\n                            |         Stem.         ||        Leaves.\r\n                            +-------+---------------||-------+---------------\r\n                            |       |      Hay.     ||       |      Hay.\r\n                            | Water +--------+------|| Water +--------+------\r\n                            |  in   |Flesh-  |      ||  in   |Flesh-  |\r\n                            | Fresh |forming | Ash. || Fresh |forming | Ash.\r\n                            | Plant.|Matters.|      || Plant.|Matters.|\r\n                            +-------+--------+------||-------+--------+------\r\n  Clover cut on the         |       |        |      ||       |        |\r\n    4th June, quite young   | 82.80 | 13.16  | 9.71 || 83.50 | 27.17  |  9.42\r\n    23rd \" ready for cutting| 81.72 | 12.72  | 9.00 || 82.68 | 27.69  |  9.00\r\n    9th July, beginning to  |       |        |      ||       |        |\r\n      flower                | 82.41 | 12.40  | 6.12 || 77.77 | 15.83  | 10.46\r\n    29th July, full flower  | 78.30 |  9.28  | 4.63 || 70.80 | 19.20  |  9.58\r\n  21st August, ripe         | 69.40 |  6.75  | 4.82 || 65.70 | 18.94  | 12.33\r\n  --------------------------+-------+--------+------++-------+--------+------\r\n\r\n  RESULTS OF WOLFF'S EXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\n  -------------+------------------------------++-----------------------------\r\n               |           Red Clover.        ||         Alsike Clover.\r\n               +--------------+---------------++---------------+-------------\r\n               | Beginning    |    Full       ||  Beginning    |    Full\r\n               | to flower,   |   flower,     ||  to flower,   |   flower,\r\n               | 11th June.   |  25th June.   ||  23rd June.   |  29th June.\r\n               +--------------+---------------++-------+-------+------+------\r\n               |Fresh.| Hay.  | Fresh.| Hay.  || Fresh.| Hay.  |Fresh.| Hay.\r\n               +------+-------+-------+-------++-------+-------+------+------\r\n               | pct. | pct.  | pct.  | pct.  || pct.  | pct.  | pct. | pct.\r\n  Water        | 83.07| 16.66 | 76.41 | 10.66 || 86.98 | 16.66 | 82.60| 16.66\r\n  Ash          |  1.43|  7.04 |  1.67 |  5.90 ||  1.12 |  7.17 |  1.45|  6.94\r\n  Woody fibre  |  4.24| 20.87 |  8.88 | 37.37 ||  3.79 | 24.26 |  5.11| 24.47\r\n  Nutritive    |      |       |       |       ||       |       |      |\r\n    substances | 11.26| 55.43 | 13.04 | 46.07 ||  8.11 | 51.91 | 10.84| 51.93\r\n  -------------+------+-------+-------+-------++-------+-------+------+------\r\n\r\nDuring the operation of converting the grass--\"natural\" or\r\n\"artificial\"--into hay, there is more or less loss of nutritive matter\r\nsustained by fermentation, the dispersion of the smaller leaves by the\r\nwind, and other agencies. But this unavoidable loss is trivial when\r\ncompared with the prodigious waste sustained, in Ireland at least, by\r\nallowing the hay to remain too long in cocks in the field. \"Within the\r\nlast three or four years,\" says Mr. Baldwin, of the Glasnevin Albert\r\nModel Farm, \"we have made agricultural tours through twenty-five of\r\nthe thirty-two counties of Ireland; and from careful consideration\r\nof the subject, and having in some instances used a tape-line and\r\nweighing-machine to assist our judgment, we have come to the conclusion\r\nthat one-twentieth of the hay-crop of Ireland is permitted to rot\r\nin field-cocks. The portion on the ground, as well as that on the\r\noutside of the cocks, is too often only fit for manure. And the loss\r\nof aftermath, and of the subsequent year's crop (if hay or pasture),\r\nsuffers to the extent of from sixpence to one shilling per acre. If we\r\nunite all these sources, the loss sustained annually in this country is\r\nsomething serious to contemplate. On an average, for all Ireland, it is\r\nnot under 20 per cent., or a fifth of the actual value of the crop.\"\r\nThis is a startling statement; but I do not believe it to be an\r\nexaggeration of the actual state of things.\r\n\r\n_Damaged Hay and Straw._--Damaged corn and potatoes, so much injured as\r\nto be unfit for human food, are generally given, and with apparently\r\ngood results, to the inferior animals. The \"meat manufacturing\r\nmachines,\" as the edible varieties of the domesticated animals are now\r\ngenerally termed, are not very dainty in their choice of food; and\r\nvegetable substances which would excite the disgust of the lords of the\r\ncreation are rendered nutritious and agreeable by being reorganised in\r\nthe mechanisms of oxen, sheep, and pigs.\r\n\r\nNow, although it is pretty generally known that musty corn and\r\ndiseased potatoes form good feeding stuffs, it is not so patent whether\r\nor not the natural food of stock, such as hay and straw in a diseased\r\nstate, is proper food for those animals. This question is worthy of\r\nconsideration. Firstly, I shall describe the nature of the diseases\r\nwhich most frequently affect fodder; these are, \"mildew\" and \"mould.\"\r\nThese diseases are produced by the ravages of minute and very low forms\r\nof vegetable life, termed by the botanists _epiphytical fungi_. The\r\nmildew (_Puccinia graminis_) generally attacks the grasses when they are\r\ngrowing, and is more frequently met with on rich and heavily manured\r\nsoils. In localities where heavy night-fogs and dews are of common\r\noccurrence, this pest often destroys whole crops. On the other hand, in\r\nlight, sandy, and well-drained soils, and in warm and dry districts,\r\nthe mildew is a rare visitant. The \"blue mould\" (_Aspergillis glaucus_)\r\nattacks hay and straw in the stack or rick, and without any regard to\r\ntheir origin--no matter whether they were the produce of the wettest or\r\nthe dryest, the warmest or the coldest of soils. The chief condition\r\nin the existence of the blue mould is excessive moisture. If the hay or\r\nstraw be too green and succulent when put up, or if rain get at them\r\nin the rick, the mould is very likely to make its appearance, and the\r\nwell-known odor termed _musty_ will speedily be developed.\r\n\r\nNeither the mildew nor the mould can, strictly speaking, be regarded as\r\nparasites, such as, for example, the flax-dodder, which feeds upon the\r\nhealthy juices of the plant to which it is attached. It appears to me\r\nthat the tissues and juices of the fodder-plants decay _first_, and then\r\nthe mould or the mildew appears and feeds upon the decomposing matter.\r\nNow, as these vegetables belong to a poisonous class of fungi, it is\r\nmore than probable that they convert the decomposing substance of the\r\nstraw or hay into unwholesome, if not poisonous matter; and it is not\r\nunlikely but that the disagreeable odor which they evolve is designed by\r\nnature as a sign to the lower animals not to partake of mouldy food.\r\nThere is no doubt but that most animals will instinctively reject fodder\r\nin this state; and the question arises, ought this odour to be destroyed\r\nor disguised, in order to induce the animals to eat the damaged stuff?\r\nThe experience of most feeders who have largely consumed mouldy provender\r\nis, that although cattle may be induced to eat it, they never thrive\r\nupon such stuff if it form a heavy item in their diet. The reason of\r\nthis is obvious. The nitrogenous portion of the straw is that which is\r\nchiefly assimilated by the fungi. And as this constituent is the one\r\nwhich contributes to the formation of muscle, and is naturally extremely\r\ndeficient in straw and hay--more particularly the former--it follows\r\nthat the animals fed upon mouldy fodder cannot elaborate it into lean\r\nflesh (muscle).\r\n\r\nIn the case of young stock, mouldy fodder is altogether inadmissible,\r\nfor these animals require abundance of flesh-forming materials--precisely\r\nthose which the fungi almost completely remove from the diseased fodder.\r\n\r\nAs large quantities of mouldy or mildewed provender are at the present\r\nmoment to be found in many farmsteads, and as they are unsaleable,\r\nand must therefore be made use of in some way at home, it is well to\r\nconsider the best way to dispose of them. In the case of straw, the\r\ngreater portion will be required for litter, and if the whole of the\r\ndamaged article can be disposed of in this way so much the better. If,\r\nhowever, there is more than is necessary for the bedding of the stock,\r\nit may be used in conjunction with sound fodder, but always in a cooked\r\nstate. The greater part, if not the whole, of the diseased nitrogenous\r\npart of the straw is soluble in warm water, so that if the fodder be\r\nwell steamed the poisonous matter will be eliminated to such an extent\r\nas to leave the article almost as wholesome as good straw, but not so\r\nnutritious. The straw cleansed in this way will be very deficient in\r\nflesh-forming, though not in fat-forming power, and this fact should\r\nbe duly considered when the other items of the animal's food are\r\nbeing weighed out. Beans, malt-combs, and linseed-cake are rich in\r\nmuscle-forming principles, and are consequently suitable adjuncts to\r\ndamaged fodder; but the latter should never constitute the staple food,\r\nor be given unmixed with some sweet provender.\r\n\r\nWhen the fodder is considerably damaged it becomes, after steaming,\r\nnearly as tasteless as sawdust. To this kind of stuff the addition of a\r\nsmall amount of some flavorous material is very useful. For damaged hay,\r\nMr. Bowick recommends the following mixture:--\r\n\r\n  Fenugreek (powdered)                                112 parts.\r\n  Pimento                                               4   \"\r\n  Aniseed                                               4   \"\r\n  Caraways                                              4   \"\r\n  Cummin                                                2   \"\r\n\r\nA pinch of this compound will render agreeably-flavored the most insipid\r\nkinds of fodder.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowick states that he had fed large numbers of bullocks on damaged\r\nhay, flavored with this compound, and that their health was not thereby\r\ninjured in the slightest degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nROOTS AND TUBERS.\r\n\r\nThe important part which the so-called root crops play in the modern\r\nsystems of agriculture, has secured for them a large share of the\r\nattention of the chemist, so that our knowledge of their composition\r\nand relative nutritive value is very extensive. As compared with most\r\nother articles of food, the roots, as they are popularly called, of\r\npotatoes, turnips, mangels, carrots, and such like plants, contain a\r\nhigh proportion of water, and are not very nutritious; indeed, with the\r\nexception of the potato, none of them contain 20 per cent. of solid\r\nmatter, and some not more than five per cent. They are, however, easily\r\nproduced in great quantities, which compensates for their low nutritive\r\nvalue. I shall consider each of the more important roots separately.\r\n\r\n_The Turnip._--There are numerous varieties of this plant, which differ\r\nfrom each other in the relative proportions and total amount of their\r\nconstituents, and even in different individuals of the same variety\r\nthere is considerable variation in composition; hence the difficulty\r\nwhich has been felt by those who have endeavored to assign to this plant\r\nits relative nutritive value. From the average results of a great number\r\nof experiments, conducted both in the laboratory and the feeding-house,\r\nit is concluded that turnips are the most inferior roots produced in the\r\nfield. The Swedish turnips are the most valuable kind: they contain a\r\nhigher proportion of solid matter than the other varieties, and they are\r\nfirmer and store better. The average composition of five varieties of\r\nturnips, as deduced from the results of the analyses of Anderson and\r\nVoelcker, is shown in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  ANALYSES OF TURNIPS.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+-------+-------+--------+---------+-------\r\n                              |Swedish| White |Aberdeen|Purpletop|Norfolk\r\n                              |Turnip.| Globe.|Yellows.|Yellows. |Bell.\r\n                              +-------+-------+--------+---------+-------\r\n  Water                       | 89.460| 90.430|  90.578|  91.200 | 92.280\r\n  Albuminous, or              |       |       |        |         |\r\n    flesh-forming substances  |  1.443|  1.143|   1.802|   1.117 |  1.737\r\n  Non-nitrogenous, or         |       |       |        |         |\r\n    fat-forming substances    |       |       |        |         |\r\n    (fat, gum, sugar, &c.)    |  5.932|  5.457|   4.622|   4.436 |  2.962\r\n  Woody fibre                 |  2.542|  2.342|   2.349|   2.607 |  2.000\r\n  Mineral matter (ash)        |  0.623|  0.628|   0.649|   0.640 |  1.021\r\n                              +-------+-------+--------+---------+-------\r\n                              |100.000|100.000| 100.000| 100.000 |100.000\r\n  ----------------------------+-------+-------+--------+---------+-------\r\n\r\nThe _Greystone Turnip_ is a variety which has only quite recently been\r\nintroduced. It is stated to be an uncommonly productive crop, usually\r\nyielding returns from 30 to 50 per cent. greater than those obtained\r\nfrom other varieties of the turnip. The composition of the Greystone\r\nturnip appears to be inferior, so that probably it is not, after all,\r\na more economical plant than the ordinary kinds of turnips.\r\n\r\n  DR.

Many bulbs exceedingly rich in nitrogen are very deficient\r\nin nutritive power--partly from a deficiency in the other elements of\r\nnutrition--partly because most of their nitrogen is in so low a degree\r\nof elaboration as to be incapable of assimilation by animals. The value\r\nof a food-substance does not merely depend upon the amount and the\r\nrelative proportion of its constituents, but also, and to a very great\r\nextent, upon their easy assimilability. There is but little doubt that\r\nthe nutritive matters contained in the Swedish turnip when the bulb is\r\nfresh are very crude. By storing, certain chemical changes take place\r\nin the bulb, which render it more nutritious and palatable. A large\r\nproportion of the non-nitrogenous matters exist in the fresh root as\r\npectin; but this substance, if the bulb be preserved for a couple of\r\nmonths, becomes in great part converted into sugar, which is one of the\r\nmost palatable and fattening ingredients of cattle-food. By storing,\r\ntoo, the bulbs lose a portion of their excessive amount of water, and\r\nbecome less bulky, which is unquestionably a desideratum. These facts\r\nsuggest the necessity for cultivating the earlier varieties of the\r\nturnip, for it may be fairly doubted if a late-grown crop, left\r\nfor consumption in the field, ever, even under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances, attains its perfect development. At the same time it\r\nmust not be forgotten that turnips _fully matured_ in the field rather\r\ndeteriorate than otherwise after a few weeks' storage.\r\n\r\nMany agriculturists consider that there is a strict relation between the\r\nspecific gravity, or comparative weight of the bulb, and its nutritive\r\nvalue; others believe that a very large turnip must necessarily be\r\ninferior in feeding qualities to a small one; whilst not a few maintain\r\nthat neither its size nor its specific gravity is an indication of its\r\nfeeding qualities. Dr. Anderson, who has specially investigated a\r\nportion of this subject, states that \"the specific gravity of the whole\r\nturnip cannot be accepted as indicating its real nutritive value, the\r\nproportion of air in the cells being the determining element in such\r\nresults; that there is no constant relation between the specific gravity\r\nof, and the nitrogen compounds in, the bulb; and that such relation\r\ndoes exist between the specific gravity of the expressed juice and\r\nthe nitrogen compounds and solid constituents.\" Dr. Anderson allows,\r\nhowever, that the best varieties of the turnip have the highest specific\r\ngravity; which admission--coupled with the fact admitted by all\r\nexperimenters that the heavy roots store best--lead me to adopt the\r\nopinions of those who consider great specific gravity as one of the\r\nfavorable indications of its nutritive value. With respect to size,\r\nI prefer bulbs of moderate dimensions; the monsters that win the prizes\r\nat our agricultural shows--and which, in general, are _forced_--are\r\ninferior in feeding qualities, are always _spongy_, and almost\r\ninvariably rot when stored.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the turnip is influenced not only by the nature of\r\nthe soil on which it is grown, but also by that of the manure applied\r\nto it. The most reliable authorities are agreed that turnips raised on\r\nPeruvian guano are watery, and do not keep well; but that with a mixture\r\nof Peruvian guano and superphosphate of lime, with phospho-guano, or\r\nwith farmyard manure supplemented with a moderate amount of guano, the\r\nmost nutritious and firm bulbs are produced.\r\n\r\nTurnip-tops have been analysed by Voelcker, with the following\r\nresults:--\r\n\r\n  ONE HUNDRED PARTS CONTAIN--\r\n\r\n                                                White.

Their high\r\nproportions of nitrogen and mineral matter constitute them, however,\r\na very useful manure--nearly twice as valuable as the bulbs; this\r\nfact should be borne in mind when turnips are sold off the land.\r\n\r\n_The Mangel-wurtzel_ is one of the most valuable of our green crops.\r\nIts root is more nutritious than the turnip, occupying a position in\r\nthe scale of food equivalents midway between that bulb and the parsnip.\r\nMangels, when fresh, possess a somewhat acrid taste, and act as a\r\nlaxative when given to stock; but after a few months' storing they\r\nbecome sweet and palatable, and their _scouring_ property completely\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nAlthough the mangel is one of the most nutritious articles of food\r\nwhich can be given to cattle, yet it is stated on the best authority\r\nthat sheep do not thrive upon it. Voelcker, who has investigated this\r\nsubject, informs us that a lot of sheep which he fed on a limited\r\nquantity of hay and an unlimited quantity of mangels, did not, during a\r\nperiod of four months, increase in weight, whilst another lot of sheep\r\nsupplied with a small quantity of hay, and Swedish turnips _ad libitum_\r\nincreased on an average 2-1/2 lbs. weekly. I believe the experience of\r\nthe greater number of feeders agrees with the results of Dr. Voelcker's\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry of the mangel-wurtzel has been thoroughly studied by Way\r\nand Ogston, Fromberg, Wolff, Anderson, and Voelcker. According to the\r\nlast-named chemist, its average composition is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                    87.78\r\n  Flesh-forming matters                                     1.54\r\n  Sugar                                                     6.10\r\n  Gum, pectin, &c.                                          2.50\r\n  Woody fibre                                               1.12\r\n  Mineral matter (ash)                                      0.96\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to accurately determine by a comparative trial the\r\nrelative feeding properties of mangels and turnips, for the former\r\nare only in a fit state to be given to the animals when the latter\r\nare deteriorating. However, by comparing the composition of the two\r\nsubstances, and the results obtained from numerous feeding experiments,\r\nit would appear, that on the average 75 lbs. weight of mangels are equal\r\nto 100 lbs. weight of turnips. Of the different varieties of the mangel\r\nthe long yellow appears to be the most nutritious, and the long red the\r\nleast so.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the mangel--some of which are occasionally pulled and used\r\nfor feeding purposes, during the growth of the bulb--are an excellent\r\nfeeding substance: their composition indicates a nutritive value but\r\nlittle inferior to that of the root; but as their constituents cannot be\r\nin a highly elaborated condition, it is probable they are not more than\r\nequal to half their weight of the bulbs.\r\n\r\nOne _questio vexata_ of the many which at present occupy the attention\r\nof the agricultural world is, whether or not the leaves of mangels may\r\nbe removed with advantage during the latter part of the development of\r\nthe plants. This practice prevailed rather extensively a few years since,\r\nbut latterly it has fallen somewhat into disuse.\r\n\r\nThose who adopt this plan urge, as its advantages, that a large quantity\r\nof food is obtained at a time when it is urgently needed, and that\r\ninstead of the removal of the leaves exercising an injurious influence\r\non the development of the roots, the latter are actually increased in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 an experimental investigation was carried out at the Glasnevin\r\nModel Farm, with the view of throwing new light on the question. The\r\noutside leaves were very gradually removed on different occasions--from\r\nthe 12th August to the 15th October. In this way five tons of leaves per\r\nstatute acre were removed, and subsequently made use of for feeding\r\npurposes. The experiment was conducted on a field of four acres, of\r\nwhich the produce of 12 drills, each 200 yards in length, was left\r\nuntouched. The result was that the produce of the roots of the untouched\r\nplants was only 40 tons 8 cwt. 6 qrs. per acre, whilst the roots of the\r\nplants which had been partly denuded of their leaves weighed at the rate\r\nof 45 tons 1 cwt. This experiment afforded results which are apparently\r\nfavorable to the practice of stripping the leaves; but it is to be\r\nregretted that it was not rendered more complete by an analysis of the\r\nroots, as a great bulk of roots does not necessarily imply a great\r\nweight of dry food, and it is just possible, though not very probable,\r\nthat the roots of the stripped mangels contained a larger proportion of\r\nwater than those of the untouched plants.\r\n\r\nThe results of the experiments of Buckman, and of Professor Wolff, of\r\nthe Royal Agricultural College at Hohenheim, are at direct variance with\r\nthose obtained at Glasnevin. Both of these experimenters found that the\r\nremoval of the leaves occasioned a diminution in the produce of the\r\nroots to the amount of 20 per cent. Nor was this the only loss, for it\r\nwas found by the German professor that the roots of the untouched plants\r\npossessed a far higher nutritive value than those of the stripped\r\nmangels.\r\n\r\nWhen doctors differ, who is to decide? Here we have high authorities in\r\nthe agricultural world at direct variance on a matter of fact. The names\r\nof Buckman and Wolff are a sufficient guarantee that the experimental\r\nresults which they announce are trustworthy, and I can testify, from\r\nobservation, that no field experiments could be more carefully conducted\r\nthan those carried out at the Albert Model Farm. We can only, then,\r\nunder the circumstances, admit that both Mr. Boyle, on the one side,\r\nand Professors Buckman and Wolff on the other, are correct in their\r\nstatements of fact; but as it is evident both cannot be right in the\r\ngeneral inferences therefrom, it is desirable that the subject should be\r\nstill further investigated, and the truth be placed beyond doubt. It is\r\na question which appears so simple that one is at a loss to account for\r\nthe discrepant opinions in relation to it which prevail. \"Let nothing\r\ninduce the growers,\" says Mr. Paget, in a paper on the cultivation of\r\nthe mangel, \"to strip the leaves from the plant before taking up the\r\nroot. A series of careful experiments has convinced me that by so doing\r\nwe borrow food at a most usurious interest.\" \"Although,\" says Mr. Boyle,\r\n\"the practice of stripping has been followed for many years on the farm\r\nwithout any perceptible injury to the crop, these results, showing so\r\nconsiderable an addition to the crop from taking off the leaves, were\r\nhardly anticipated.\" It certainly does appear somewhat at variance with\r\nour notion of the functions of the leaves of plants, that their partial\r\nremoval could possibly cause an increase in the weight of the roots;\r\nbut granting such to be the fact, it is not altogether _theoretically_\r\ninexplicable. We know that highly nitrogenous manure has a tendency to\r\nincrease the development of the leaves of turnips at the _expense_ of\r\nthe roots. Gardeners, too, not unfrequently remove some of the buds from\r\ntheir fruit trees, lest the excessive development of foliage should\r\nretard or check the _growth_ of the fruit. _Theoretically_ an excessive\r\ndevelopment of the leaves of the mangel may be inimical to the growth\r\nof the root. Probably, too, it may be urged, the outer leaves, which\r\nsoon become partially disorganised and incapable of elaborating mineral\r\nmatter into vegetable products, prevent the access of light to the more\r\nvigorous inner leaves. In conclusion, I may say of this subject that it\r\nis worthy of further elucidation; and I would suggest to my readers,\r\nand more especially to the managers of the various model farms, the\r\ndesirability of fully testing the matter.\r\n\r\nThe _White Beet_ is a congener of the mangel. It is largely grown on the\r\ncontinent as a sugar-producing plant, but is seldom cultivated in these\r\ncountries. It produces about 15 tons of roots per acre, and its roots on\r\nthe average contain--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                     83.0\r\n  Sugar                                                     10.0\r\n  Flesh-formers                                              2.5\r\n  Fat-formers                                                1.5\r\n  Fibre                                                      2.0\r\n  Ash                                                        1.0\r\n                                                           -----\r\n                                                           100.0\r\n\r\nThis plant is deserving of more extensive growth in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe _Parsnip_ is, after the potato, the most valuable of roots. It\r\ndiffers from the turnip and the mangel in containing a high proportion\r\nof starch, and but little sugar; and its flesh-forming constituents are\r\nlargely made up of casein, instead of, as in the case of the turnip,\r\nalbumen.\r\n\r\nThe average composition of the parsnip is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                    82.00\r\n  Flesh-forming principles                                  1.30\r\n  Fat-formers (starch, sugar, &c.)                          7.75\r\n  Woody fibre                                               8.00\r\n  Mineral matter (ash)                                      0.95\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nThe parsnip is extensively grown in many foreign countries, on\r\naccount of its valuable feeding properties. As a field-crop it is but\r\nlittle cultivated in Great Britain, and its use is--if we except the\r\ntable--almost restricted to pigs. Its food equivalent is about double\r\nthat of the turnip; that is, one pound of parsnips is equal to two\r\npounds of turnips.\r\n\r\nThe _Carrot_ bears a close resemblance to the parsnip, from which,\r\nhowever, it differs, containing no starch, and being somewhat inferior\r\nin nutritive value. According to Voelcker, its average composition is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                    88.50\r\n  Flesh-formers                                             0.60\r\n  Fat-formers (including woody fibre)                      10.18\r\n  Mineral matter (ash)                                      0.72\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nAs carrots contain a high proportion of fat-forming matters, and a low\r\nper-centage of flesh-forming substances, they are better adapted for\r\nfattening purposes. Dairy stock greedily eat them; and they are given\r\nwith great advantage to horses out of condition.\r\n\r\n_Kohl-Rabi._--This plant, though early introduced into the agriculture\r\nof these countries, has made but little progress in the estimation\r\nof the farmer. It belongs to the order and genus which include the\r\nturnip, but differs widely from that plant in its mode of growth. Its\r\nbulb--which is formed by an enormous development of the overground\r\nstem--is, according to some authorities, less liable than the turnip\r\nto injury from frost. It is subject to no diseases, save anbury and\r\nclubbing; and, owing to its position above the soil, it can be readily\r\neaten off by sheep. The bulbs store better than Swedes, and, according\r\nto some farmers, keep even better than mangels. With respect to the\r\nflavor of this bulb, there is some difference of opinion. Professor\r\nWilson, of Edinburgh, quotes several eminent feeders to prove that\r\n\"whether in the fold for sheep, in the yard for cattle, or in the\r\nstables for horses, it will generally be preferred to the other\r\ndescriptions of homegrown keep.\" Mr. Baldwin, on the contrary, states\r\nthat although good food for sheep, it is too hard-fleshed for old ewes,\r\nand that carrots are better food for horses, and Swedish turnips for\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nAn accurately conducted comparative trial to test the nutritive value\r\nof the Kohl-rabi, was conducted at the Glasnevin Model Farm, under the\r\ndirection of Mr. Baldwin. The experiment was commenced in January, 1863.\r\nFour oxen were selected, and divided into two lots. Nos. 1 and 2 (Lot 1)\r\nwere fed on Kohl-rabi, oil-cake, and hay, and Nos. 3 and 4 (Lot 2) on\r\nSwedish turnips, oil-cake, and hay. As the animals supplied with the\r\nKohl-rabi did not appear to relish it, and as it was desirable to\r\ngradually accustom them to the change of food, the experiment did not\r\nreally commence till the 12th January. On that date the weights of the\r\nanimals were as follows:--\r\n\r\n                      cwt.  st.    |                   cwt.  st.\r\n                                   |\r\n     Lot 1.  {No. 1.   10    1     |   Lot 2.  {No. 3.   7    5\r\n             {No. 2.    7    4     |           {No. 4.  10    2\r\n                       -------     |                    -------\r\n                       17    5     |                    17    7\r\n\r\nThe lots, therefore, counterpoised each other pretty fairly. From the\r\n12th to the 28th January they received the following quantities of food\r\nper diem:--\r\n\r\n                                   1.      2.      3.      4.\r\n\r\n  Roots                   stones   7-1/2   6       6       7-1/2\r\n  Oil cake                pounds   4-1/2   3       3       4-1/2\r\n  Hay                     pounds  10-1/2  10-1/2  10-1/2  10-1/2\r\n\r\nThe animals fed upon the Kohl-rabi evinced from the first a\r\ndisinclination to it, but they nevertheless ate it before their meal of\r\noil-cake was supplied to them. On the morning of the 28th January they\r\nwere put upon the dietary shown in the table, and which induced them to\r\neat the Kohl-rabi more quickly.\r\n\r\n                                   1.      2.      3.      4.\r\n\r\n  At 6.30 a.m.    {Roots, Stones   3       2-1/2   2-1/2   3-1/2\r\n                  {Cake, lbs.      1-1/2   1       1       1\r\n\r\n  At 12.30 a.m.   {Roots, Stones   3       2-1/2   2-1/2   3-1/2\r\n                  {Cake, lbs.      1-1/2   1       1       1\r\n\r\n  At 6.30 p.m.    {Roots, Stones   3       2-1/2   2-1/2   3-1/2\r\n                  {Cake, lbs.      1-1/2   1       1       1\r\n\r\n  At 9.30 p.m.     Hay, lbs.       7       7       7       7\r\n\r\nOn the 11th February the cattle were again weighed, when their increase\r\nwas found to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n                               Weight on   Weight on  Increase in\r\n                               Jan. 12.

The superiority of the Swedish turnips was\r\nrendered more evident by the results of subsequent experiments. Nos. 1\r\nand 4 were not tried after the 11th February; but Nos. 2 and 3 were kept\r\nunder experiment. No. 2 was put on Swedes, and No. 3 on mangel-wurtzel,\r\nand after an interval of a fortnight No. 2 had increased much more than\r\nthey had done on Kohl-rabi.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the Kohl-rabi and Swedish turnips employed in this\r\nexperiment were submitted to me for analysis by Mr. Baldwin, and yielded\r\nthe following results:--\r\n\r\n                                                          Swedish\r\n                                              Kohl-rabi.

The bulbs, it should however be remarked,\r\nwere grown, no doubt with great care, by Messrs. Lawson and Son, the\r\nwell-known seedsmen:--\r\n\r\n  ANALYSIS OF KOHL-RABI, BY DR.

At\r\none time its leaves were boiled and eaten, but in these latter days they\r\nare subjected to neither of these processes. The root, however, in its\r\nraw state, is, as every one is aware, considered one of the dainties of\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nMany of those who devote themselves to the important study of dietetics,\r\nconsider the use of raw vegetables to be objectionable; but be their\r\nobjections groundless, or the reverse, it is certain that a vegetable\r\nwhich, like the radish, may be eaten raw with apparently good results,\r\ncannot be otherwise than a good article of food when cooked. I once\r\ntried the experiment of eating matured radishes, not as a salad, but\r\ncooked like any other boiled vegetable, and I must say that I found\r\ntheir flavor rather agreeable than otherwise. Boiled radishes--roots and\r\ntops--form excellent feeding for pigs. How could it be otherwise? for\r\nwhat is good for the family of man must surely be a luxury to the swine\r\ntribe. I have known horses to eat radishes greedily, and I am certain\r\nthat they would prove acceptable to all the animals of the farm. But\r\nit may be asked, why it is that I recommend the use of radishes as\r\nfood for stock, when there are already so many more nutritious roots\r\nat our disposal--turnips, mangels, and potatoes. Simply for this\r\nreason:--Between the departure of the roots and the advent of the\r\ngrasses, there is a kind of interregnum.[33] Now we want a good tuberous,\r\nbulbous, or tap-rooted plant to fill up this interregnum. Such a plant\r\nwe have in the radish. The root is certainly a small one, but then it\r\ngrows so rapidly that a good supply can be had within thirty days from\r\nthe sowing of the seed, and a crop can be matured before the time for\r\nsowing turnips. Two crops may be easily obtained from land under\r\npotatoes--one before the tops cover the ground, the other after the\r\ntubers have been dug out. The yield of radishes, judging from the\r\nproduce in the garden, would be at least six tons of roots and three\r\ntons of tops. I would suggest, then, that the radish should at once\r\nget a fair chance as a stolen crop. If it succeed as such, it will\r\nnot be the first gift of the gardener to the husbandman. Was not the\r\nmangel-wurtzel once known only as the produce of the garden?\r\n\r\nThe composition of the radish indicates a nutritive value less than that\r\nof the white turnip. I have analysed both the root and the tops, and\r\nobtained the following results:--\r\n\r\n  ANALYSIS OF THE RADISH.\r\n\r\n                                              Root.

The French term the tuberous root of this plant\r\n_poitre de terre_, or _topin ambour_; and although they expose it for\r\nsale in the markets, it is not much relished by our lively neighbours,\r\nwho are so remarkable for their _cuisiniere_. As food for cattle,\r\nhowever, the French agricultural writers state it to be excellent.\r\nIt is much relished by horses, dairy cows, and pigs; store horned-stock\r\nalso eat it when seasoned with a little salt, and appear to enjoy it\r\namazingly when permitted to pull up the roots from the soil. The green\r\ntops are also given to sheep and cattle, and, it is stated, are readily\r\neaten by those animals.\r\n\r\nThe Jerusalem artichoke (_Helianthus Tuberoses_) differs from its half\r\nnamesake, the common artichoke, and resembles the potato in being\r\nvaluable chiefly for its tubers. It is perennial, and attains on the\r\nContinent a height varying from 7 to 10 feet. In this country its\r\ndimensions are less. The stem is erect, thick, coarse, and covered with\r\nhairs. It is a native of Mexico, and although introduced 200 years ago\r\ninto Europe, it can hardly be said to be acclimatised, since it very\r\nseldom flowers, and never develops seed. The plant is therefore\r\npropagated by cuttings from its tubers, each containing one or two eyes;\r\nor if the tubers be very small, which is often the case, a whole one is\r\nplanted. The tubers possess great vitality, and remain in the ground\r\nduring the most severe frosts, without sustaining the slightest injury.\r\nFor this reason it is usual to devote a corner of the garden to the\r\ncultivation of the Jerusalem artichoke; for, no matter how completely\r\nthe crop may appear to have been removed from the soil, portions of the\r\ntubers will remain and shoot up into plants during the following season.\r\nThis peculiarity of the plant it is likely may prove an obstacle to its\r\nhaving a place assigned to it in the rotation system.\r\n\r\nThe question now presents itself--What are the peculiar advantages which\r\nthe crop possesses which should commend it to the notice of the British\r\nfarmer? I shall try to answer the question.\r\n\r\n1st. No green crop (except furze) can be grown in so great a variety of\r\nsoils; except marshy or wet lands, there is no soil in which it refuses\r\nto grow.\r\n\r\n2nd. It does not suffer from disease, is very little affected by the\r\nravages of insects, is completely beyond the influence of cold, and may\r\nremain either above or below ground for a long time without undergoing\r\nany injurious changes in composition.\r\n\r\n3rd. It gives a good return, when we consider that it requires very\r\nlittle manure, and but little labor in its management.\r\n\r\nAt Bechelbronn, the farm of the celebrated Boussingault, the average\r\nyield is nearly eleven tons per acre, but occasionally over fourteen\r\ntons is obtained. Donoil, a farmer of Bailiere, in the department of\r\nHaut-loire, states that he fed sheep exclusively on the tops and tubers\r\nof this plant, and that he estimated his profits at L23 per hectare\r\n(L9 3s. 4d. per acre). The soil was very inferior. Donoil terms it\r\nthird-rate, and it does not appear to have been manured even once\r\nduring the fifteen years it was under Jerusalem artichoke. I fear our\r\nartificial manure manufacturers will hardly look with a favorable eye\r\non the advent of a crop into our agriculture which can get on so well\r\nwithout the intervention of any fertilising agents. Indeed, several of\r\nthe French writers state that little or no manure is necessary for this\r\nplant. But this can hardly be the case; for it is evident that a crop\r\nwhich, according to Way and Ogston, removes 35 lbs. of mineral matter\r\nper ton from the soil, or three times as much potash as turnips do, must\r\ncertainly be greatly benefited by the application of manure. And I have\r\nno doubt but that the Jerusalem artichoke, if well manured and grown\r\nin moderately fertile soil, would produce a much heavier crop than our\r\nContinental neighbors appear to get from it.\r\n\r\n4th. The Jerusalem artichoke may be cultivated with advantage in places\r\nwhere ordinary root-crops either fail or thrive badly. In such cases\r\nthe ground should be permanently devoted to this crop. Kade gives an\r\ninstance where a piece of indifferent ground had for thirty-three years\r\nproduced heavy crops of this plant, although during that time neither\r\nmanure nor labor had been applied to it. In Ireland the potato has been\r\ngrown under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive constituents of tubers of the Jerusalem artichoke bear\r\na close resemblance in every respect, save one, to those of the\r\npotato. Both contain about 75 per cent. of water, about 2 per cent.\r\nof flesh-forming substances, and 20 per cent. of non-nitrogenous, or\r\nfat-forming and heat-giving elements. In one respect there is a great\r\ndifference--namely, that sugar makes up from 8 to 12 per cent. of the\r\nJerusalem artichoke, whilst there is but a small proportion of that\r\nsubstance in the potato.\r\n\r\nThe large quantity of sugar contained in this root is no doubt the cause\r\nof its remarkable keeping properties in winter, and it also readily\r\naccounts for the avidity with which most of the domesticated animals\r\neat it.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, I think that the facts I have brought forward\r\nrelative to the advantages which the Jerusalem artichoke presents as a\r\nfarm crop, justify the recommendation that it should get a fair trial\r\nfrom the British farmer, who is now so much interested in the production\r\nof suitable forage for stock.\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF (DRY) JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE\r\n\r\n  Albuminous matters                                         4.6\r\n  Fatty matters                                              0.4\r\n  Starch, gum, &c.                                          19.8\r\n  Sugar                                                     69.5\r\n  Fibre and ash                                              5.7\r\n                                                           -----\r\n                                                           100.0\r\n\r\nThe _Potato_, regarded from every point of view, is by far the most\r\nimportant of the plants which are cultivated for the sake of their\r\nroots. Its tubers form the chief--almost sole--pabulum of many millions\r\nof men, enter more or less into the dietary of most civilised peoples,\r\nand constitute a large proportion of the food of the domesticated\r\nanimals. The great importance of this plant, arising from its enormous\r\nconsumption, has caused its composition to be very minutely studied by\r\nmany British, Continental, and American chemists. With respect to its\r\nnutritive properties, the least favorable results were obtained by the\r\nAmerican chemists, Hardy and Henry, and the most by the European\r\nchemists.\r\n\r\nThe flesh-forming principles vary from 1 per cent., as found by Hardy,\r\nto 2.41 per cent., the mean results of the analyses of Krocker and\r\nHorsford. The proportion of starch in different varieties of the potato\r\nalso varies, but not to the same degree as the nitrogenous principles.\r\nIn new potatoes, only 5 per cent. has been found; in ash-leaved kidneys,\r\n9.50 per cent.; and in different kinds of cups, from 15 to 24 per cent.\r\nThe amount of starch is also influenced by the soil, the manure, the\r\nclimate, and the various other conditions under which the plant is\r\ndeveloped. The proportion of starch increases during the growth, and\r\ndiminishes during the storage of the tubers.\r\n\r\nDr. Anderson is the most recent investigator into the composition of the\r\npotato; the chief results of his inquiries are given in the following\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\n  ANALYSIS OF THE POTATO BY DR.

When used as food for\r\nman, it should be supplemented by some more fatty or nitrogenous\r\nsubstance--such, for example, as flesh, oatmeal, or peas. Buttermilk,\r\na fluid which is rich in nitrogen, is an excellent supplement to\r\npotatoes, and compensates to a great extent for the deficiency of those\r\ntubers in muscle-forming matters. If, then, the potato is destined to\r\nretain its place as the \"national esculent\" of the Irish, I trust their\r\nnational beverage may be--so far at least as the masses of the people\r\nare concerned--buttermilk, and _not_ whiskey.\r\n\r\nPotatoes so far diseased as to be unsuited for use as food for man, may\r\nbe given with advantage to stock. They may be used either in a raw or\r\nuncooked state, but the latter is the preferable form. Sheep do not like\r\nthem at first, but on being deprived of turnips they acquire a taste\r\nfor them; on a daily allowance, composed of 1 lb. of oil-cake or corn,\r\nand an unlimited quantity of potatoes, they fatten rapidly. Cattle\r\nthrive well on a diet composed of equal parts of turnips and diseased\r\npotatoes, and do not require oil-cake. The evening feed of horses may\r\nadvantageously be composed of potatoes and turnips. If raw, the potatoes\r\nshould be given in a very limited quantity--four or five pounds; in the\r\ncooked state, however, they may be given in abundance, but the animals\r\nshould not, after their meal, be permitted to drink water for some\r\nhours. As a feeding substance, diseased potatoes, unless they be very\r\nmuch injured, are equal to twice their weight of white turnips; it is\r\ncertain that they do not injure the health or impair the condition of\r\nthe animals which feed upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.\r\n\r\nSEEDS.\r\n\r\nIn seeds the elements of nutrition exist not only in the most highly\r\nelaborated, but also in the most concentrated state; hence their\r\nnutritive value is greater than that of any other class of food\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n_Wheat Grain_ is the most valuable of seeds, as it contains, in admirably\r\nadjusted proportions, the bone, the fat, and the muscle-forming\r\nprinciples. In the form of bread, it has been, not inaptly, termed the\r\n\"staff of life,\" for no other grain is so well adapted, _per se_, for\r\nthe sustenance of man; and many millions of human beings subsist almost\r\nexclusively on it. The lower animals are in general fed upon the grain\r\nof oats, of barley, and of the leguminous plants, and the use of wheat\r\nis almost completely restricted to the human family.\r\n\r\nWheat grain, by the processes of grinding and sifting, is resolvable\r\ninto two distinct parts--bran and flour. In twenty-four analyses made\r\nby Boussingault, the proportion of the bran was from 13.2 to 38.5\r\nper cent. and that of the flour from 61.5 to 86.8 per cent. The floury\r\npart is of very complex structure; it includes starch, gluten, albumen,\r\noil, gum, gummo-gelatinous matter, sugar,[34] and various saline matters.\r\nThe gluten and albumen constitute the nitrogenous, or flesh-forming\r\nprinciples of flour, and make up from 16 to 20 per cent. of that\r\nsubstance; the non-nitrogenous, or fat-forming elements, such as\r\nstarch and gum, form from 74 to 82 per cent. According to Payen, the\r\nproportion of gluten diminishes towards the centre of the seed, from\r\nwhich it follows that the part of the grain nearest the husk is the\r\nmost nutritious--so far at least as muscle-making is concerned. The\r\ndesire on the part of the public for very white bread has led to the\r\n_fine_ dressing of Wheat-grain, and consequently to the separation from\r\nthat substance of a very large proportion of one of its most nutritious\r\nconstituents. Crude gluten may be obtained by kneading the dough of\r\nflour in a muslin bag under a small current of water; the starch, or\r\nfecula, and the gum, are carried away by the water, and the gluten in\r\nan impure form remains as an elastic viscous substance, which on drying\r\nbecomes hard and brittle. It is to the gluten of flour that its property\r\nof panification, or bread-making, is due. On the addition of a ferment,\r\na portion of the starch is converted into sugar and carbonic acid gas,\r\nand the latter causes the gluten to expand into the little cells, or\r\nvesicles, which confer upon baked bread its light, spongy texture.\r\n\r\n  ANALYSES OF WHEAT.\r\n\r\n                              1.        2.         3.        4.\r\n\r\n                            Whole\r\n                            Grain.

The grasses (which include\r\nthe cereals) are _annuals_, or plants which have but a year's existence,\r\nconsequently their development ceases so soon as they have produced\r\ntheir seed. When wheat, oats, and the other cereals, attain to this\r\nfinal point in their growth, the circulation of their sap ceases,\r\ntheir color changes from green to yellow, and they undergo certain\r\nchanges which destroy their power of assimilating mineral matter, and\r\nconsequently render them no longer capable of increasing their weight.\r\n\r\nThe proper time for cutting wheat and the other cereals is immediately\r\nafter their grain has been fully matured. When the green color of the\r\nstraw just below the ears changes to yellow, the grain, be it ripe or\r\nunripe at the time, cannot afterwards be more fully developed. This is\r\nrendered impossible in consequence of the disorganisation of the upper\r\npart of the stem--indicated by, but not the result of, its altered\r\nhue--which cuts off the supply of sap to the ears, and the latter do\r\nnot possess the power of absorbing nutriment from the air.\r\n\r\nWhen the vital processes which are incessantly going on in the growing\r\nplants are brought to a close, the purely chemical forces come into\r\noperation. If the seed be perfectly matured and allowed to remain\r\nungathered, it is attacked in wet weather by the oxygen of the air, a\r\nportion of its carbon is burned off, some of its starch is converted\r\ninto sugar, and in extreme cases it germinates and becomes _malty_.\r\nBut not only is the seed liable to injury from the elements; it is also\r\nexposed to the ravages of the feathered tribe, and no matter how well\r\na field of corn may be watched, or how great the number of _scarecrows_\r\nerected in it, there is always a certain diurnal loss, occasioned by the\r\nravages of birds.\r\n\r\nIt is not only necessary that ripe corn should be cut as soon as\r\npossible, but it is sometimes desirable to reap it before it becomes\r\nfully matured. When the grain is intended for consumption as food, the\r\nless bran it contains the better. Now the bran, as is well known, forms\r\nthe integument, or covering of the vital constituents of the seed; and\r\nit is the last part of the organ to be perfected. The growth of the\r\nseed for several days before its perfect development, is confined to\r\nthe _testa_ or covering. Now as this is the least valuable part of the\r\narticle, its increase is matter of but little moment; and when it is\r\nexcessive it renders the grain less valuable in the eyes of the miller.\r\nThat the cutting of the grain before it is perfectly ripe is attended\r\nwith a good result, is clearly proved by the results of an experiment\r\nrecorded in Johnston's \"Agricultural Chemistry.\" A crop of wheat was\r\nselected; one-third was cut twenty days before it was ripe; another\r\nthird ten days afterwards; and the remaining portion when its grain had\r\nbeen fully matured. The relative produce in grain of the three portions\r\ntaken, as stated above, was as 1, 1.325, and 1.260. The following table\r\nexhibits the relative proportions of their constituents:--\r\n\r\n                                  In 100 parts of the grain cut at\r\n                                  20 days.   10 days.

But this is not the only\r\nadvantage, for the straw of the green, or rather of the greenish-yellow\r\ncorn, is fully twice as valuable for feeding purposes as that of the\r\nover-ripe cereals. There is an extraordinary decrease in the amount\r\nof the albuminous constituents of the stems of the cereals during the\r\nlast two or three weeks of their maturation, and as there is not a\r\ncorresponding increase of those materials in the seed, they must be\r\nevolved in some form or other from the plants.\r\n\r\nThere can be only one object attained by allowing the seed to fully\r\nripen itself, and that is the insurance of its more perfect adaptability\r\nto the purpose of reproduction. When the _testa_ is thick it best\r\nprotects the germ of the future plant enclosed in it from the ordinary\r\natmospheric influences until it is placed under the proper conditions\r\nfor its germination.\r\n\r\n_Wheat, a costly food._--It occasionally happens that the wheat harvest\r\nis so abundant, that many feeders give large quantities of this grain to\r\ntheir stock. Now, as Indian corn is at least 25 per cent. cheaper than\r\nwheat, even when the price of the latter is at its _minimum_, I believe\r\nthat it is always more economical to sell the wheat raised on the farm,\r\nand to purchase with the proceeds of its sale an equivalent of Indian\r\ncorn, which is a more fattening kind of food.\r\n\r\n_Bran_ is, with perhaps the exception of malt-dust, the most nutritious\r\nof the refuse portions of grains. It is usually given to horses, and\r\nowing to its high proportion of nitrogen, is, perhaps, better expended\r\nin the bodies of those hard-working animals, than in those of pigs and\r\ncows--animals that occasionally come in for a share of this valuable\r\nfeeding-stuff. It should be borne in mind that bran commonly acts as\r\na slight laxative, and that it is less digestible than flour, a large\r\nportion of it usually passing through the animal's body unchanged.\r\nThis drawback to the use of bran may be obviated by either cooking or\r\nfermenting the article, or by combining it with beans or some other\r\nkind of binding food.\r\n\r\n  AVERAGE ANALYSES OF GRAIN.\r\n\r\n  --------------+-------+------+-----+--------+------+-----+--------+------\r\n                |       |      |     |        |Indian|     |  Rye   |Buck-\r\n                |Barley.| Bere.|Oats.|Oatmeal.| Corn.|Rice.|(Irish).|wheat.\r\n                +-------+------+-----+--------+------+-----+--------+------\r\n  Water         |  16.0 | 14.25| 14.0|  13.00 | 14.5 | 14.0|   16.0 | 14.19\r\n  Flesh-formers |  10.5 | 10.10| 11.5|  16.00 | 10.0 |  5.3|    9.0 |  8.58\r\n  Fat-formers   |  67.0 | 64.60| 64.5|  68.00 | 69.0 | 78.5|   66.0 | 51.91\r\n  Woody fibre   |   3.5 |  9.03|  7.0|   1.75 |  5.0 |  2.5|    8.0 | 23.12\r\n  Mineral matter|   3.0 |  2.02|  3.0|   1.25 |  1.5 |  0.7|    1.0 |  2.20\r\n                +-------+------+-----+--------+------+-----+--------+------\r\n                | 100.0 |100.00|100.0| 100.00 |100.0 |100.0|  100.0 |100.00\r\n  --------------+-------+------+-----+--------+------+-----+--------+------\r\n\r\n_Barley_ is inferior in composition to wheat. As a feeding stuff, the\r\nEnglish farmers assign to it a higher, and the Scotch farmers a lower,\r\nplace than oats, which, perhaps, merely proves that in Scotland the oat\r\nthrives better than the barley, and in England the barley better than\r\nthe oat. Barley-meal is extensively used by the English feeders, and\r\nwith excellent results. Where _barley-dust_ can be obtained it is a far\r\ncheaper feeding stuff than the meal. Barley husks should never be given\r\nto animals unless in a cooked or fermented state.\r\n\r\n_Oat Grain_ is, perhaps, the most valuable of the concentrated foods\r\nwhich are given to fattening stock. When it is cheap it will be found\r\na more economical feeding stuff than linseed-cake, and, unlike that\r\nsubstance, can be used without the fear of adulteration. Oats are equal\r\nto wheat in their amount of flesh-forming matters; but their very high\r\nproportion of indigestible woody fibre detracts from their nutritive\r\nvalue. Oat-meal is more nutritious than wheat-meal; and oat-flour,\r\nespecially if finely dressed, greatly excels wheat-flour in its\r\nnutrimental properties, because, unlike the latter, the finer it is the\r\ngreater is its amount of flesh-formers. Bread made of oat-flour is very\r\nheavy, and is far less palatable than the bread of wheat. Oat-meal has\r\nbeen found to contain nearly 20 per cent. of nitrogenous matters. The\r\nwhite oat is more nutritious than the black, and the greatest amount of\r\naliment is found in the grain which has not been allowed to over-ripen\r\nin the field. Oat husk is very inferior to the bran of wheat. Toppings\r\nare seldom worth the price at which they are sold.\r\n\r\n_Indian Corn_ has been highly extolled as a fattening food for stock,\r\nand its chemical composition would seem to justify the high opinion\r\nwhich practical men have formed of its relative nutritive value. In the\r\nUnited States, the feeding of horses on Indian corn and hay has been\r\nfound very successful; but in these countries oats will be found a more\r\neconomical food. For fattening purposes Indian corn appears exceedingly\r\nwell adapted, as it contains more ready-formed fat--4.5 per cent.--than\r\nis found in most of the other grains, and, on an average, 70 per cent.\r\nof starch. Pigs thrive well on this grain. The Galatz round yellow grain\r\nis somewhat superior to the American flat yellow seed.\r\n\r\n_Rye_ is not extensively cultivated in this country, but on the\r\nContinent it is raised in large quantities. In the north of Europe\r\nit forms a considerable proportion of the food of both man and the\r\ndomesticated animals. In Holland it is commonly consumed by horses, but\r\nin England there has always been a prejudice against the use of this\r\ngrain as food for the equine tribe. It has been highly recommended for\r\ndairy stock, five pounds of rye-meal, with a sufficiency of cut straw,\r\nconstituting, it is stated, a dietary on which cows yield a maximum\r\nsupply of milk. Irish-grown rye contains less starch, and more\r\nflesh-formers and oil, than the Black Sea grain.\r\n\r\n_Rice_, although it forms the chief pabulum of nearly one-third of\r\nthe human family, is the least nutritious of the common food grains.\r\nRice-dust, an article obtained in cleaning rice for European consumption,\r\nis said to promote the flow of milk when given to cows. It is sold in\r\nlarge quantities in Liverpool, where, according to Voelcker, it often\r\ncommands a higher price than it is worth.\r\n\r\n_Buckwheat_ is chiefly used as a food for game and poultry.\r\n\r\n_Malted Corn._--During a late session of Parliament a Bill was passed to\r\nexempt from duty malt intended to be used as food for cattle. As feeders\r\nmay now become their own maltsters, it may be of some use to them to\r\nhave here a _resume_ of this Bill:--\r\n\r\n    1. Any person giving security and taking out a licence may make\r\n    malt in a malt-house approved by the Excise for the purpose; and\r\n    all malt so made and mixed with linseed-cake or linseed-meal as\r\n    directed, shall be free from duty.\r\n\r\n    2. The security required is a bond to Her Majesty, with sureties\r\n    to the satisfaction of the Excise, not to take from any such\r\n    malt-house any malt except duly mixed with material prescribed\r\n    by the Act.\r\n\r\n    3. The malt-house must be properly named upon its door.\r\n\r\n    4. All malt made in it shall be deposited in a store-room, and\r\n    shall be conveyed to and from the room upon such notice as the\r\n    officer of Excise shall appoint.\r\n\r\n    5. The maltster shall provide secure rooms in his malt-house,\r\n    to be approved in writing by the supervisor, for grinding the\r\n    malt made by him in such malt-house, and mixing and storing the\r\n    same when mixed; and all such rooms shall be properly secured\r\n    and kept locked by the proper officer of Excise.\r\n\r\n    6. All malt before removal from the malt-house shall be ground\r\n    and thoroughly mixed with one-tenth part at least of its weight\r\n    of ground linseed-cake or linseed-meal, and ground to such a\r\n    degree of fineness and in such manner as the commissioners shall\r\n    approve, and mixed together in a quantity not less than forty\r\n    bushels at a time in the presence of an officer of Excise.\r\n\r\n    7. The maltster shall keep account of the quantity of all malt\r\n    mixed as aforesaid which he shall from time to time send out or\r\n    deliver from his malt-house, with the dates and addresses of the\r\n    person for whom such mixed malt shall be so sent or delivered.\r\n\r\n    8.

The gentlemen who verbally, or in writing, refer\r\nso favorably to malt, acknowledge, with one or two exceptions, that\r\ntheir experience of the article is limited. Mr. John Hudson, of\r\nBrandon, states that he made a comparative experiment, the results\r\nof which proved the superiority of malt. But, in fact, the only\r\nproperly-conducted experiments to determine the relative values of malt\r\nand barley were those made some years ago by Dr. Thompson, of Glasgow,\r\nby the direction of the Government, and those recently performed by Mr.\r\nLawes, both producing results unfavorable to the malt. The issue of Dr.\r\nThompson's investigations proved that milch cows fed on barley yielded\r\nmore milk and butter than when supplied with an equal weight of malt.\r\n\r\nI do not deny the probability that malt, owing to its agreeable flavor\r\nand easy solubility, may be a somewhat better feeding stuff than barley;\r\nand that, weight for weight, it may produce a somewhat greater increase\r\nin the weight of the animals fed upon it: but although a pound-weight of\r\nmalt may be better than a pound-weight of barley, I am quite satisfied\r\nthat a pound's worth of barley will put up more flesh than a pound's\r\nworth of malt. Barley-seeds consist of water, starch, nitrogenous\r\nsubstances--such as gluten and albumen--fatty substances, and saline\r\nmatter. The amount of starch is considerable, being sometimes about\r\n70 per cent. In the process of malting (which is simply the germination\r\nof the seed under peculiar conditions), a portion of the starch is\r\nconverted into sugar and gum, the grain increases in size and becomes\r\nfriable when dried, and the internal structure of the seed is completely\r\nbroken up. During these changes a partial decomposition of the solid\r\nmatter of the seeds takes place, and a large amount of nutriment is\r\ndissipated, chiefly in the form of carbonic acid gas. From the results\r\nof the experience of the maltster, and of special experiments made by\r\nscientific men, it would appear that a ton of barley will produce only\r\n16 cwt. of malt. Allowance must, however, be made for the difference\r\nbetween the amount of water contained in barley and in malt, the latter\r\nbeing much drier. According to Mr. E. Holden, the centesimal loss\r\nsustained in malting may be stated thus:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                     6.00\r\n  Organic matter                                           12.52\r\n  Saline matter                                             0.48\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nDr. Thompson[35] sets down the loss of nutriment (exclusive of that\r\noccasioned by kiln-drying), as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Carried off by the steep                                  1.5\r\n  Dissipated on the floor                                   3.0\r\n  Roots separated by cleaning                               3.0\r\n  Waste                                                     0.5\r\n                                                            ---\r\n                                                            8.0\r\n\r\nWe may say, then, that by the malting of barley we lose at least 2-1/2\r\ncwt. of solid nutriment out of every ton of the article, and this loss\r\nfalls heaviest on the nitrogenous, or flesh-forming constituents of\r\nthe grain. When there are added to this loss the expense of carting\r\nthe grain to and from the malt-house, and the maltster's charge for\r\noperating upon it (I presume in this case that the feeder is not his own\r\nmaltster), it will be found that two tons of malt will cost the farmer\r\nnearly as much as three tons of barley; and he will then have to solve\r\nthe problem--_Whether or not malt is 40 or 50 per cent. more valuable\r\nas a feeding-stuff than barley_.\r\n\r\nThe difference in value between barley and malt is generally 14s. per\r\nbarrel; but it is sometimes more or less, according to the supply and\r\ndemand. Barley, well malted, will lose on the average 25 per cent. of\r\nits weight, the loss depending, to some extent, upon the degree to which\r\nthe process is carried, and on the germinating properties of the barley.\r\nBarley malted for roasters ought not to lose more than 21 per cent. of\r\nits original weight--53 lbs. to the barrel. The heavier the barley the\r\nless it loses in malting; a barrel of 224 lbs., and value from 15s. to\r\n16s., ought to produce a barrel of malt of 196 lbs., value 29s. to 30s.\r\n\r\nIf we deduct from the cost of a barrel of malt the amount of duty at\r\npresent levyable upon it, the price of the article will be still nearly\r\n50 per cent. greater than that of an equal weight of barley. The cheaper\r\nbarley is the greater will be the relative cost of malt. The maltster's\r\ncharge for converting a barrel of barley into malt is about 4s.; so\r\nthat if the price of the grain be so low as 12s. per barrel, which it\r\nsometimes is, the cost of malting it would amount to 33 per cent. of its\r\nprice. Then, the diminution in the weight of, and the cost of carting\r\nthe grain, must be taken into account; and when the whole expense\r\nattendant upon the process of malting is ascertained, it will be found\r\nthat I have not exaggerated in stating that a ton of malt costs as much\r\nas a ton and a half of barley.\r\n\r\nIf the consumer of malt germinate the seeds himself, he may probably,\r\nif he require large quantities of the article, produce it at a somewhat\r\ncheaper rate than if he bought it from the maltster; but few persons who\r\nhave the slightest knowledge of the vexatious restrictions of the Inland\r\nRevenue authorities would be likely to place his premises under the\r\n_espionage_ of an excise officer.\r\n\r\nAs the superiority of malt over barley (if such be really the case) must\r\nbe chiefly due to the looseness of its texture, which allows the juices\r\nof the stomach to act readily upon it, barley in a cooked state might be\r\nfound quite as nutritious: It would not be fair to institute comparisons\r\nbetween dense hard barley-seeds and the easily soluble malted grains.\r\nDuring the cooking of barley a portion of the starch is changed into\r\nsugar, but in this case with only an inappreciable waste of nutriment.\r\nWhen the cooking process is continued for a few hours, a considerable\r\namount of sugar is formed, and the barley acquires a very sweet flavor.\r\n\r\nWhen the malt for cattle question was under discussion, I made a little\r\nexperiment in relation to it, the results of which are perhaps of\r\nsufficient interest to mention:--Two pounds weight of barley-meal were\r\nmoistened with warm water; after standing for three hours more water was\r\nadded, and sufficient heat applied to cause the fluid to boil. After\r\nfifteen minutes' ebullition, a few ounces of the pasty-like mass which\r\nwas produced were removed, thoroughly dried, and on being submitted\r\nto analysis yielded six per cent. of sugar. The addition of a small\r\nquantity of malt to barley undergoing the process of cooking will\r\nrapidly convert the starch into sugar.\r\n\r\nBarley is naturally a well-flavored grain, and all kinds of stock eat\r\nit with avidity. It may be rendered still more agreeable if properly\r\ncooked, and this process will, by disintegrating its hard, fibrous\r\nstructure, set free its stores of nutriment. I incline strongly to\r\nthe opinion that barley, when well boiled, is almost, if not quite,\r\nas digestible as malt.\r\n\r\nA serious disadvantage in the use of malt is, that it must be consumed,\r\nit is said, in combination with 10 per cent. of its weight of linseed-meal\r\nor cake. Now, malt is a very laxative food, and so is linseed; and if\r\nthe diet of stock were largely made up of these articles the animals\r\nwould, sooner or later, suffer from diarrhoea. In such case, then,\r\nthe addition of bean-meal, or of some other binding food, would become\r\nnecessary, and the compound of malt, linseed, and bean-meal thereby\r\nformed would certainly prove anything but an economical diet.\r\n\r\n_Malt Combs._--I should mention that a portion of the nutriment which\r\nthe barley loses in malting passes into the radicles, or young roots,\r\nwhich project from the seeds, and are technically known by the term\r\n\"combs,\" \"combings,\" or \"dust.\" At present these combs are separated\r\nfrom the malt, but if the latter be intended for feeding purposes this\r\nseparation is unnecessary, and in such case the barley will not be so\r\nmuch deteriorated. The combs, which constitute about 4 per cent. of the\r\nweight of the malt, are sometimes employed as a feeding stuff. I have\r\nmade an analysis of malt-combings for the County of Kildare Agricultural\r\nSociety, and have obtained the following results:--\r\n\r\n  100 PARTS CONTAINED--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                     8.42\r\n  [*] Flesh-forming (albuminous) substances                21.50\r\n  Digestible fat-forming substances (starch, sugar,\r\n     gum, &c.)                                             53.47\r\n  Indigestible woody fibre                                  8.57\r\n  [+] Saline matter (ash)                                   8.04\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\n  [* Yielding nitrogen                                      3.44]\r\n  [+ Containing potash                                      1.35\r\n     Containing phosphoric acid                             1.74]\r\n\r\nThis article was sold as a manure at L3 6s. per ton--a sum for which it\r\nwas not good value; but as a feeding substance it was probably worth L4\r\nor L5 per ton. Its composition indicates a high nutritive power; but it\r\nis probable that its nitrogenous matters are partly in a low degree of\r\nelaboration, which greatly detracts from its alimental value.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, then, I would urge the following points upon the\r\nattention of the farmer:--\r\n\r\n1st. Before using malt for feeding purposes, wait until you learn the\r\ngeneral results of the experience of other farmers with that article.\r\nThe manufacture of malt for feeding purposes is rapidly on the decline,\r\ninstead of, as had been anticipated, on the increase.\r\n\r\n2nd. Should you experiment with barley and malt, use equal money's worth\r\nof each, and employ the barley in a cooked state.\r\n\r\n3rd. Use malt-combings as a feeding stuff, and not as a manure. They are\r\ngood value for at least L3 10s. per ton.\r\n\r\n4th. Bear in mind that a ton of barley contains more saline matter than\r\nan equal weight of malt; consequently, that stock fed upon barley will\r\nproduce a manure richer in potash and phosphates than those supplied\r\nwith malt.\r\n\r\n_Leguminous Seeds._--The seeds of the bean, of the pea, and of several\r\nother leguminous plants, are largely made use of as food for both man\r\nand the domesticated animals. They all closely resemble each other in\r\ncomposition, but in that respect differ considerably from the grains of\r\nthe _Cerealiae_, for whilst the latter contain on an average 12 per cent.\r\nof flesh-formers, beans and peas contain 24 per cent. The flesh-forming\r\nconstituent of the leguminous seeds is not gluten, as in the grain\r\nof the cereals, but a substance termed _legumin_, which so closely\r\nresembles the cheesy matter of milk that it has also received the name\r\nof _vegetable casein_. Indeed, the Chinese make a factitious cheese out\r\nof peas, which it is difficult to discriminate from the article of\r\nanimal origin.\r\n\r\n_Beans_ are used as fattening food for cattle, for which purpose they\r\nshould be ground into meal, as otherwise a large proportion of their\r\nsubstance would pass through the animal's body unchanged. It is not good\r\neconomy to give a fattening bullock more than 3 or 4 lbs. weight per\r\ndiem; a larger proportion is apt to induce constipation. The very small\r\nproportion of ready-formed fat, the moderate amount of starch, and the\r\nexceedingly high per-centage of flesh-formers which beans contain, prove\r\nthat they are better adapted as food for beasts of burthen than for the\r\nfattening of stock. Oats, Indian corn, or oil-cake, will be found to\r\nproduce a greater increase of meat than equal money's worth of beans\r\nor peas, and I would therefore recommend the restriction of leguminous\r\nseeds, under ordinary circumstances, to horses and bulls. It has been\r\nstated, on good authority, that when oats are given whole to horses,\r\na large proportion passes unchanged through the animal's body, but that\r\non the addition of beans, the oats are thoroughly digested.\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF LEGUMINOUS SEEDS.\r\n\r\n  --------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+----------\r\n                      | Common|Foreign|  Peas.|Lentils.| Winter\r\n                      | Beans.| Beans.|       |        |  Tares\r\n                      |       |       |       |        |(foreign).\r\n  --------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+----------\r\n  Water               |  13.0 |  14.5 |  14.0 |   13.0 |   15.5\r\n  Flesh-formers       |  25.5 |  23.0 |  23.5 |   24.0 |   26.5\r\n  Fat-formers         |  48.5 |  48.7 |  50.0 |   50.5 |   47.5\r\n  Woody fibre         |  10.0 |  10.0 |  10.0 |   10.0 |    9.0\r\n  Mineral matter      |   3.0 |   3.8 |   2.5 |    2.5 |    1.5\r\n  --------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+----------\r\n                      | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 |  100.0 |  100.0\r\n  --------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+----------\r\n\r\n_Oil Seeds._--The seeds of a great variety of plants, such as the flax,\r\nhemp, rape, mustard, cotton, and sunflower, are exceedingly rich in oil,\r\nsome of them containing nearly half their weight of that substance. Of\r\nthese oil-seeds there are many which might with advantage be employed as\r\nfattening, food, although one only--linseed--has come into general use\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\n_Rape-seeds_ closely resemble linseeds in composition, but they are\r\nconsiderably cheaper. They contain an acrid substance, but the large\r\nproportion of oil with which it is associated almost completely\r\ndisguises its unpleasant flavor.\r\n\r\n_Linseed_ is one of the most valuable kinds of food which could be given\r\nto fattening animals. Its exceedingly high proportion of ready-formed\r\nfatty matter, the great comparative solubility of its constituents, and\r\nits mild and agreeable flavor, constitute it an article superior to\r\nlinseed cake. The laxative properties of linseed are very decided; it\r\nshould therefore be given only in moderate quantities. As peas and\r\nbeans exercise, as I have already stated, a relaxing influence upon\r\nthe bowels, a mixture of linseed and peas or beans would be an\r\nexcellent compound, the laxative influence of the one being corrected\r\nby the binding tendency of the other. Linseed being one of the most\r\nconcentrated feeding stuffs in use, it will be found an excellent\r\naddition to bulky food, such as chaff and turnips. Linseed oil has\r\nbeen used as a fattening food, but there is nothing to be gained by\r\nexpressing seeds for the purpose of using their oil as a feeding\r\nmaterial. When hay is scarce, and straw abundant, the latter may be\r\nmade almost as nutritious as the former by mixing it with linseed, and\r\nsteaming the compound. A stone of linseed and two cwt. of oat-straw\r\nchaff, when properly cooked, constitute a most economical and\r\nnutritious food.\r\n\r\nMr. Horne, who experimented with linseed two or three years ago,\r\nobtained results highly favorable to the nutritive value of that\r\narticle. Six bullocks were selected, and each animal placed in a\r\nseparate box. They were fed with cut roots--at first Swedes, then\r\nmangels and Swedes, and lastly, mangels alone: in addition, there were\r\nsupplied to each 6 lbs. rough meadow-hay reduced to chaff, and 5 lbs.\r\noil-cake, or value to that amount. They were divided into three lots,\r\ntwo in each. Lot 1 had 5 lbs. oil-cake for each animal; lot 2, barley\r\nand wheat-meal, equal in value to the 5 lbs. oil-cake; and lot 3, an\r\nequal money's worth of bruised linseed. The oil-cake cost L10 16s. per\r\nton, the mixture of barley and wheat L8 15s. per ton, and the bruised\r\nlinseed L13 per ton. The experiment lasted 112 days, and at its close\r\nthe results, which proved very favorable to the bruised linseed, were\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                    Increase in\r\n                                                    live weight.\r\n\r\n  Lot 1. Oil-cake                                       637 lbs.\r\n  Lot 2. Wheat and barley-meal                          667 lbs.\r\n  Lot 3. Bruised linseed                                718 lbs.\r\n\r\nDuring the 112 days each bullock consumed 5 cwt. oil-cake (or an\r\nequivalent amount of linseed or wheat and barley), 6 cwt. hay, and\r\n90 cwt. of roots. The average increase in each animal's weight was\r\n337 lbs. = 224 lbs. _dead_ weight. The economic features of this\r\nexperiment are best shown in the following figures:--\r\n\r\n  FOOD CONSUMED.\r\n\r\n                                                        L  s.  d.\r\n\r\n   5 cwt. oil-cake, at 10s. 6d. per cwt.                2  12  6\r\n   6 cwt. hay, at 3s. per cwt.                          0  18  0\r\n  16 weeks' attendance, at 6d. per week                 0   8  0\r\n                                                       ---------\r\n                                                       L3  18  6\r\n                                                       ---------\r\n  Gained 16 stones per week, at 8s. per stone           6  8   0\r\n                                                       ---------\r\n  Balance to pay for 90 cwt. of roots                   2  9   6\r\n\r\nThe manure obtained afforded a good profit.\r\n\r\nThe seed-pods, or, as they are termed, the _bolls_ of the flax,\r\nhave been recommended as an excellent feeding stuff. They are not\r\nso nutritious as linseed, but they are cheaper, and when produced\r\non the farm must be an economical food. Mr. Charley, an intelligent\r\nstock-feeder in the county of Antrim, and an eminent authority in every\r\nsubject in relation to flax, strongly recommends the use of flax-bolls.\r\nHe says:--\r\n\r\n    The cost of rippling is considerable; but I believe, for\r\n    every L1 expended, on an average a return is realised of L2,\r\n    particularly on a farmstead where many horses and cattle are\r\n    regularly kept. The flax-bolls contain much more nourishment\r\n    than the linseed-cake from which the oil has, of course, been\r\n    expressed, and they form a most valuable addition to the warm\r\n    food prepared during winter for the animals just named. I believe\r\n    they have also a highly beneficial effect in warding off internal\r\n    disease, owing, no doubt, to the soothing and slightly purgative\r\n    properties of the oil contained in the seed. The change made in\r\n    the appearance of the animals receiving some of the bolls in their\r\n    steamed food is very apparent after a few weeks' trial; and the\r\n    smoothness and sleekness of their shining coats plainly show the\r\n    benefit derived. Is it not surprising, with this fact before our\r\n    eyes, that many agriculturists--indeed, I fear the majority--persist\r\n    in the old-fashioned system of taking the flax to a watering-place\r\n    with its valuable freight of seed unremoved, and plunge the sheaves\r\n    under water, losing thereby, _in the most wanton manner_, rich\r\n    feeding materials, worth from L1 to L3 per statute acre?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the composition of all the more important\r\noil-seeds is given:--\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF OIL-SEEDS, ACCORDING TO DR.

These cakes contain a larger proportion of ready-formed\r\nfatty matter than is found in any other feeding stuff, and an amount\r\nof flesh-forming principles far greater than that yielded by corn,\r\nor even by beans; the manure, too, which is produced by the cattle fed\r\nupon some of them, is often good value for nearly half the sum expended\r\non the food.\r\n\r\nThe principal kinds of oil-cake employed for feeding purposes are the\r\nfollowing:--Linseed-cake, Rape-cake, and cotton-seed cake. Poppy cake is\r\nnot much in use.

This remarkable advance\r\nin the production of meat is in great part due to the cattle being more\r\nliberally supplied with food, and that, too, of a more concentrated\r\nnature. The practice of feeding animals destined for the shambles\r\nexclusively on roots containing 90 and even 95 per cent. of water, which\r\nonce prevailed so generally in this country, is now limited to the\r\nfarmsteads of a few old-fashioned feeders; and the necessity for the\r\nadmixture of highly-nutritious aliment with the bulky substances which\r\nform the staple food of stock is almost universally recognised.\r\n\r\nOf concentrated foods used for fattening stock, none stands higher in\r\nthe estimation of the farmer than linseed-cake, although it appears to\r\nme that the price of the article is somewhat too high in relation to\r\nits amount of nutriment, and that corn, if its price be moderate, is\r\na more economical food. Straw, turnips, and mangels form the bone and\r\nsinew of the animals, and enable them to carry on the vital operations\r\nwhich are essential to their existence. Oil-cake and similar foods are\r\nsupplemental, and contribute directly to the animal's increase, so that\r\ntheir nutritive value appears to be greater than it really is. If an\r\nanimal were fed exclusively upon oil-cake, the greater part of it would\r\nbe appropriated to the reparation of the waste of the body, and the rest\r\nwould be converted into permanent flesh--the animal's \"increase.\" The\r\naddition of straw would produce a still further increase in the animal's\r\nweight--an increase which would be directly proportionate to the amount\r\nof straw consumed. Thus it will be seen that, whatever the staple food\r\nmay be, it will have to sustain the life of the animal, and will be\r\nprincipally expended for that purpose, whereas the supplemental food\r\nwill be chiefly, if not entirely, made use of in increasing the weight\r\nof flesh. To me it appears manifestly incorrect to consider, as feeders\r\npractically do, the value of linseed-cake to be seven or eight times\r\ngreater than that of oat-straw, and twenty times greater than that of\r\nroots. Let us assume the case of an animal fed upon roots, straw, and\r\noil-cake. Seventy-five per cent. of its food, say, is expended in\r\nrepairing the waste of its body, and 25 per cent. is stored up in its\r\nincrease. Now, if the three kinds of food contributed proportionately\r\nto the reparation of the body and to its increase, the roots and straw\r\nwould be found to possess a far higher nutritive value, in relation to\r\nthe oil-cake, than is usually ascribed to them.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked why straw, if it be relatively a much more\r\neconomical feeding stuff than oil-cake, is not employed to the complete\r\nexclusion of the latter. I have already given an answer to such a\r\nquestion, namely, that animals thrive better on a diet composed partly\r\nof bulky, partly of concentrated aliments. This much, however, is\r\ncertain, that animals can be profitably fed upon roots and straw, whilst\r\nit is equally certain that to feed them upon oil-cake alone (assuming\r\nthem to thrive upon such a diet) would entail a very heavy loss upon\r\nthe feeder. At the same time it must be admitted that the oil of the\r\nlinseed-cake exercises in all probability a beneficial influence on the\r\ndigestion of the animal, so that the nutritive value of the article may\r\nbe somewhat higher than its mere composition would indicate.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of oil-cake given to fattening stock varies from 2 lbs. to\r\n14 lbs. per diem. I believe there is no greater mistake made by feeders\r\nthan that of giving excessive quantities of this substance to stock. If\r\ntheir object in so doing be to enrich their manure-heap, they would find\r\nit far more economical to add the cake directly to the manure--or rather\r\nof adding rape-cake to it, for this variety of cake is fully as valuable\r\nfor manurial purposes as the linseed-cake, and is nearly 50 per cent.\r\ncheaper. A larger quantity of oil-cake than 7 lbs. daily should not be\r\ngiven to even the largest-sized milch cows or fattening bullocks. If a\r\nlarger amount be employed, it will pass unchanged through the animal's\r\nbody. Young cattle may with advantage be supplied with from 1 to 3 lbs.,\r\naccording to their size, and from 1/2 to 1 lb. will be a sufficient\r\nquantity for sheep. Intelligent feeders have remarked, that cattle which\r\nhad been always supplied with a moderate allowance of this food fattened\r\nmore readily upon it, during their finishing stage, than did stock which\r\nhad not been accustomed to its use.\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Linseed Cake._--The great drawback to the use of\r\nlinseed-cake is the liability of the article to be adulterated. The\r\nsophistication is sometimes of a harmless nature, if we except its\r\ninjurious effect on the farmer's pocket; but not unfrequently the\r\nsubstances added to the cakes possess properties which completely unfit\r\nthem to be used as food. Amongst the injurious substances found in\r\nlinseed and linseed-cake I may mention the seeds of the purging-flax,\r\ndarnel, spurry, corn-cockle, curcus-beans, and castor-oil beans.\r\nSeveral of these seeds are highly drastic purgatives, and they have\r\nbeen known to cause intense inflammation of the bowels of animals fed\r\nupon oil-cake, of which they composed but a small proportion. Amongst\r\nthe adulterations of linseed-cake, which lower its nutritive value\r\nwithout imparting to it any injurious properties, are the seeds of\r\nthe cereals and the grasses, bran, and flax-straw. Little black seeds\r\nbelonging to various species of _Polygonum_, are very often present\r\nin even good cakes; they are very indigestible, but otherwise are not\r\ninjurious. Rape-cake is stated to be occasionally used as adulterant\r\nof the more costly linseed, but I have never met with an admixture of\r\nthe two articles.\r\n\r\nThe only way in which a correct estimate of the value of linseed-cake\r\ncan be arrived at is by a combined microscopical and chemical analysis;\r\nbut as the feeder is not always disposed to incur the cost of this\r\nprocess, he should make himself acquainted with the characteristic\r\nof the genuine cake, in order to be able to discriminate, as far as\r\npossible, between it and the sophisticated article. I will indicate a\r\nfew of the more prominent features of cake of excellent quality, and\r\npoint out a few simple and easily-performed tests, which may serve\r\nto detect the existence of gross adulteration. Good cake is hard, of\r\na reddish-brown color, uniform in appearance, and possesses a rather\r\npleasant flavor and odour. The adulterated cake is commonly of a greyish\r\nhue, and has a disagreeable odour. A weighed quantity of the cake--say\r\n100 grains--in the state of powder should be formed into a paste with\r\nan ounce of water; if it be good, the paste will be light colored,\r\nmoderately stiff, and endowed with a pleasant odour and flavor. If the\r\npaste be thin, the presence of bran, or of grass seeds, is probable.\r\nThe latter are easily seen through a magnifying-glass; indeed, most\r\nof them are readily recognisable by the unassisted eye: they may,\r\ntherefore, be picked out, and their weight determined. Sand--a frequent\r\nadulterant--may be detected by mixing a small weighed quantity of the\r\npowdered cake with about twelve times its weight of water, allowing the\r\nmixture to stand for half an hour, and collecting and weighing the sand\r\nwhich will be found at the bottom of the vessel employed. If there be\r\nbran present it will be found lying on the sand, and its structure\r\nis sufficiently distinct to admit of its detection by a mere glance.\r\nThere are a great variety of linseed-cakes in the market, of which\r\nthe home-made article is the best. On the Continent the oil-seeds are\r\nsubjected to the action of heat in order to obtain from them a greater\r\nyield of oil. Their cakes, therefore, contain less oil, and their\r\nflesh-forming principles are less soluble, in comparison with British\r\nlinseed-cake. Next to our home-made oil-cakes, the American is the\r\nbest. Indeed, I have met with some American cakes which were equal to\r\nthe best English.\r\n\r\n_Rape Cake._--The use of rape-cake was limited almost completely to the\r\nfertilising of the soil until the late Mr. Pusey, in a paper published\r\nin the tenth volume of the _Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of\r\nEngland_, advocated its employment as a substitute for the more costly\r\nlinseed-cake. The recommendation of this distinguished agriculturist\r\nhas not been disregarded; and since his time the use of this cake as a\r\nfeeding stuff has been steadily on the increase, and at the present time\r\nits annual consumption is not far short of 50,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the nutritive value of rape-cake there exists considerable\r\ndiversity of opinion. Certain feeders assert that animals fed upon it go\r\nout of condition; others, whilst admitting that stock thrive upon it,\r\nmaintain the economic superiority of linseed-cake; whilst a third\r\nset believe rape-cake to be the most economical of feeding-stuffs.\r\nHow are we to account for these great differences of opinion--not\r\namongst _theorists_, be it observed, but amongst practical men?\r\nIt is not difficult to explain them away satisfactorily. Rape-cake\r\nand linseed-cake are about equally rich in muscle and fat-forming\r\nprinciples; and, supposing both to be equally well-flavored, there can\r\nbe no doubt but that one is just as nourishing as the other. But it so\r\nhappens that a large proportion of the rape-cake which comes into the\r\nBritish market possesses a flavor which renders it very disagreeable\r\nto animals. One variety--namely, the East Indian--is almost poisonous,\r\nwhilst the very best kind is slightly inferior to linseed-cake. Now, if\r\nan experiment with a very inferior kind of rape-cake and a good variety\r\nof linseed-cake were tried, who can doubt but that the results would be\r\nvery unfavorable to the former article? Mr. Callan,[36] of Rathfarnham,\r\ncounty Dublin; Mr. Bird,[37] of Renton Barns, and some other feeders,\r\nwho found rape-cake to be worse than useless, experimented, in all\r\nprobability, with an adulterated article, for they do not appear to\r\nhave had the cake analysed. On the other hand, those whose experience\r\nwith rape-cake has proved favorable, must have employed the article\r\nin a genuine state, fresh, and moderately well-flavored. It is\r\nnoteworthy that amongst the advocates for the use of rape-cake as\r\na substitute--partly or entirely--for the more costly linseed-cake,\r\nare to be found the most successful feeders in England and Scotland.\r\nHorsfall, Mechi, Lawrence, Bond, Hope, and many other feeders of equal\r\ncelebrity, have assigned to rape-cake the highest place, in an economic\r\npoint of view, amongst the concentrated feeding stuffs. Mr. Mechi\r\nsays:--\"I invariably give to all my animals as much rape-cake as they\r\nchoose to eat, however abundant their roots or green food may be. It\r\npays in many ways, and not to do this is a great pecuniary mistake.\r\nEven when fed on green rape, they will eat rape-cake abundantly.\r\nMy cattle are now under cover, eating the steamed chaff, rape-cake,\r\nmalt-combs, and bran, all mixed together in strict accordance with\r\nthe proportions named by Mr. Horsfall in the _Journal of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society_, vol. xviii., p. 150,[38] which I find by far\r\nthe most profitable mode of feeding bullocks and cows.\" Mr. Hope, of\r\nEdinburgh, states that rape-cake is the best substitute for turnips,\r\nand that, excepting cases where spurious kinds had been used, he never\r\nknew bullocks or milch cows to refuse it. This gentleman states that\r\nit is best given in combination with locust-beans, or a mixture of\r\nlocust-beans and Indian corn; and suggests the proportions set down\r\nin the tables as the best adapted for lean cattle; but I think about\r\ntwo-thirds of the quantities would be quite sufficient.\r\n\r\n                                      Feed per week.

Two years ago, I took some of my best oats\r\n    (41 lbs. per bushel), and ground them for the cows, and although\r\n    I was at about one-third more expense, I lost fully one-third of\r\n    the produce that I had by using rape-cake. I always dissolve it\r\n    by pouring boiling water on it, and give each cow 6 lbs. daily.\r\n    I have tried a larger quantity, and found I was fully repaid for\r\n    the extra expense. I generally use it the most of the summer,\r\n    but always during the spring months. A number of my neighbours\r\n    who have tried it all agree that it is the best and cheapest\r\n    feed for milch cows they have used.--_North British Agriculturist_,\r\n    Edinburgh, February 29, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best kinds of rape-cake come from Germany and Denmark. When\r\nneither too old nor too fresh, and of a pale-green color, these\r\nforeign cakes are tolerably well-flavored, and are but slightly\r\ninferior to good linseed-cake. Most varieties of this cake, however,\r\ncontain a small proportion of acrid matter, which often renders them\r\nmore or less distasteful to stock, more particularly to cattle. This\r\nsubstance may be rendered quite innocuous by steaming or boiling the\r\ncake; either of these processes will also, according to Mr. Lawrence,\r\ndestroy the disagreeable flavor which mustard-seed--a frequent\r\nadulterant of rape-cake--confers upon that article. Molasses or treacle\r\nis an excellent adjunct to the cake, as it serves in a great measure to\r\ncorrect its somewhat unpleasant flavor. Carob, or locust-beans, answer,\r\nperhaps better, the same purpose. It is better, as a general rule,\r\nto give less rape-cake than linseed-cake, unless the pale-green kind\r\nto which I have referred is obtainable; that variety may be largely\r\nemployed. The animals should be gradually accustomed to its use. At\r\nfirst, in the case of bullocks, they should get only 1 lb. per diem,\r\nand the quantity should be gradually increased to about 4 lbs.; but\r\nI would not advise, under any circumstances, a larger daily allowance\r\nthan 5 lbs. Given in moderate amounts, it will, supposing it to be of\r\nfair quality, be found to give a better return in meat than almost any\r\nother kind of concentrated food; and, what is of great importance, it\r\nwill not injuriously affect the animal's health. \"Our experience of the\r\nuse of rape-cake,\" says Mr. Lawrence, \"thus used (cooked), extends over\r\na period of ten years of feeding from 20 to 24 bullocks annually. We\r\nhave not had a single death during that period, and the animals have\r\nbeen remarkably free from any kind of ailment.\"\r\n\r\nRape-cake of good quality possesses a dark-green color (the greener\r\nthe better), and when broken exhibits a mottled aspect--yellowish and\r\ndark-brown spots. Sometimes a tolerably good specimen has a brownish\r\ncolor; but the German and Danish cakes are always of a greenish hue.\r\nThe odor is stronger than that of linseed-cake, and differs but little\r\nfrom that of rape-oil. The only serious adulteration of rape-cake\r\nis the addition to it of mustard-seed--sometimes accidentally--less\r\nfrequently, as I believe, intentionally. This sophistication admits of\r\neasy detection. Scrape into small particles about half an ounce of the\r\ncake, add six times its weight of water, form the solid and liquid\r\ninto a paste, and allow the mixture to stand for a few hours. If the\r\ncake contain mustard the characteristic odor of that substance will be\r\nevolved, and its intensity will afford a rough indication of the amount\r\nof the adulterant. As some specimens of genuine rape-cake possess a\r\nsomewhat pungent odor, care must be taken not to confound it with that\r\nof mustard; but, indeed, it is not difficult to discriminate the latter.\r\nThe paste of rape-cake which contains an injurious proportion of\r\nmustard, has a very pungent flavor. Rape-cake improves somewhat if kept\r\nfor say six months; but old cake is worse than the fresh article.\r\n\r\n_Cottonseed Cake_ is one of the most valuable feeding stuffs that\r\nhave come into use of late years. Its chemical composition shows it\r\nto be about equal to that of the best linseed-cake, and as its price\r\nis much lower than that of the latter, it may be fairly considered\r\na more economical food. These remarks apply only to the shelled, or\r\ndecorticated seed-cake, for the article prepared from the whole seed is\r\nof very inferior composition, and should never be employed. The use of\r\nthe cake made from the whole seed has proved fatal in many instances,\r\nnot from its possessing any poisonous quality, but in consequence\r\nof its hard, indigestible husk, accumulating in, and inflaming, the\r\nanimal's bowels.\r\n\r\nThe composition of this cake varies somewhat. The following analysis of\r\na sample from one of the Western States of North America, imported by\r\nMessrs. G. Seagrave and Co., of Liverpool, was made by me:--\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF DECORTICATED COTTON-SEED CAKE.\r\n\r\n  Water                                                     8.20\r\n  Oil                                                      10.16\r\n  Albuminous, or flesh-forming principles                  40.25\r\n  Gum, sugar, &c.                                          21.10\r\n  Fibre                                                     9.23\r\n  Ash (mineral matter)                                     11.06\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nIn some specimens so much as 16 per cent. of oil has been found. The\r\npurchaser of cotton-seed cake should be certain that it is not old and\r\nmouldy, which is frequently the case. The recently prepared cake has\r\na very yellow color, which becomes fainter as the cake becomes older.\r\nFreshness is a very desirable quality in nearly every kind of cake.\r\nI have known animals to have a greater relish for, and thrive better\r\nupon, home-made linseed-cake than upon cake of foreign manufacture of\r\nsuperior composition, but of greater age.\r\n\r\n_Palm-nut Meal, or Cake_ is a very valuable fattening food. It is\r\nextremely rich in ready-formed fatty matters, but at the same time it is\r\nnot very deficient in albuminous substances. Its strong flavor is rather\r\na drawback to its use in the case of all the farm animals, except pigs.\r\nThis difficulty may, however, be got over by using the cake in moderate\r\nquantities, and by combining it with other food possessed of a good\r\nflavor. Reports of practical trials made with this food appear to have\r\nalmost uniformly given very favorable results. This food is only three\r\nor four years in use. The first samples that came into my hand were\r\nricher in fatty matters than those which I have recently examined.\r\nThe average results of eight analyses made from 1864 to 1866 were\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  100 PARTS CONTAINED--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                     7.48\r\n  Albuminous matters                                       17.26\r\n  Fatty substances                                         21.59\r\n  Gum, sugar, &c.                                          32.14\r\n  Fibre                                                    17.18\r\n  Mineral matter                                            4.35\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nThis year I have not found more than 17 per cent. of fat in any sample\r\nof palm-nut cake. One specimen which I analysed for Mr. J. G. Alexander,\r\nseed merchant, of Dublin, had the following composition:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                     9.24\r\n  Albuminous matters                                       19.28\r\n  Fatty matters                                             9.36\r\n  Gum, starch, fibre, &c.                                  53.22\r\n  Mineral matters                                           8.90\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\nBut although inferior samples are occasionally met with, I may say\r\nof palm-nut cake that on the whole it is a food which deserves to be\r\nlargely used, and which at its present price is the most economical\r\nsource of fat. To milch-cows and fattening cattle about 3 lbs. per diem\r\nmay be given; 1/4 lb. will be sufficient for young sheep, whilst pigs\r\nmay be very liberally supplied with this food.\r\n\r\nThe _Locust, or Carob Bean_, is now largely used by the stock-feeder.\r\nIt is extremely rich in sugar, and is therefore an excellent fattening\r\nand milk-producing food. It is used largely in the preparation of the\r\nsweet kinds of artificial food for cattle. It is not well adapted for\r\nyoung animals, owing to its deficiency of albuminous matters. The\r\nfollowing analysis shows the average composition of this food:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                       14\r\n  Sugar                                                       50\r\n  Albuminous matters                                           8\r\n  Oil                                                          1\r\n  Gum, &c.                                                    20\r\n  Woody fibre                                                  5\r\n  Ash                                                          2\r\n                                                             ---\r\n                                                             100\r\n\r\n_Dates_ have been used, but only in very small quantities, as cattle\r\nfood. Their composition is not constant, some samples being greatly\r\ninferior in nutritive power to others; they are rich in sugar,\r\nand if they were obtained in sufficient quantities they might, like\r\ncarob-beans, come into general use with the stock-feeder. They contain\r\nabout 2 per cent. of flesh-formers, 10 per cent. of fat-formers (chiefly\r\nsugar), and 2 per cent. of mineral matter.\r\n\r\nDistillery and brewery dregs (or wash) are chiefly used by dairymen.\r\nAccording to Dr. Anderson, an imperial gallon (700,000 grains) of\r\ndistillery wash (from a distillery near Edinburgh) contained 4,130\r\ngrains of organic matter, and 276 grains of mineral substances.\r\nHe considers that 15 gallons of this stuff were equal in nutritive\r\nmaterials to 100 pounds of turnips. The following is the centesimal\r\ncomposition of brewery wash:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                                    75.85\r\n  Albuminous matters                                        0.62\r\n  Gummy matters                                             1.06\r\n  Other organic matter (husks, &c.)                        21.28\r\n  Mineral matters                                           1.19\r\n                                                          ------\r\n                                                          100.00\r\n\r\n_Molasses_ constitute a very fattening food, sometimes, but not\r\noften, given to stock. Treacle and molasses are composed of\r\nnon-crystallisable sugar, cane-sugar, water, and saline and other\r\nimpurities. The composition of average specimens of molasses, as\r\nimported, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cane-sugar                                                  50\r\n  Non-crystallisable sugar and grape-sugar                    25\r\n  Water, saline matter, and organic impurities                25\r\n                                                             ---\r\n                                                             100\r\n\r\nIf admitted duty free, molasses would be a much more economical food\r\nthan it now is, but at its present price it must be regarded as a mere\r\nflavoring food.\r\n\r\nMr. T. Cooke Burroughs, a West Suffolk feeder, who used treacle in 1864,\r\ngives the following mode of mixing it with other food:--\r\n\r\n    My plan has been (and is still carried on) to give to each\r\n    bullock per day (divided into three meals) one pint of treacle\r\n    dissolved in two gallons of water, and sprinkled, by means of\r\n    a garden water-pot, over four bushels of cut chaff (two-thirds\r\n    straw and one-third hay) amongst which a quarter of a peck of\r\n    meal (barley and wheat) is mixed, the animals also having free\r\n    access to water. The cost of the treacle and meal together\r\n    is about 3s. per bullock per week. My bullocks (two-year old\r\n    Shorthorns) have grown and thrived upon the above diet to my\r\n    utmost satisfaction; and even during the present dry and warm\r\n    weather they evince no lingering after roots or grass. I am well\r\n    aware that the use of treacle for neat stock is no new discovery\r\n    of my own, as I learnt the system while on a visit to a friend\r\n    in Norfolk, where some graziers have used it in combination with\r\n    roots during many years past. Perhaps flax-seed (linseed) boiled\r\n    into a jelly and used in a similar way, may be a more profitable\r\n    \"substitute for roots\" than treacle; but the preparation of it is\r\n    attended with more expense and trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION  VIII.\r\n\r\nCONDIMENTAL FOOD.\r\n\r\nAlthough every farmer may not have used, there are few who have not\r\nheard of \"Thorley's Condimental Food for Cattle.\" This nostrum is a\r\ncompound of some of the ordinary foods with certain well-known aromatic\r\nand carminative substances. It possesses a very agreeable flavor, and it\r\nis therefore much relished by horses, and indeed by every kind of stock.\r\nThe price of this compound was at first so much as L60 per ton; but\r\nowing to competition, and perhaps to the attacks made upon the\r\nenormously high price of this article, it is now to be obtained at\r\nprices varying from L12 to L24 per ton.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of condimental food, and the numerous fabricators of that\r\ncompound, claim for it merits of no ordinary nature. Its use, they\r\nassert, not only maintains the animals fed upon it in excellent health,\r\nbut it also exercises so remarkable an action upon the adipose tissues\r\nthat fat accumulates to an immense extent. Moreover, it is said that an\r\nanimal supplied with a very moderate daily modicum of this wonderful\r\ncompound, will consume less of its ordinary food, though rapidly\r\nbecoming fat.\r\n\r\nNow, if these assertions were perfectly, or even approximatively,\r\ntrue, Mr. Thorley would be well deserving of a niche in the temple of\r\nfame, and stock-feeders would ever regard him as a benefactor to his\r\nown and the bovine species; but I fear that Mr. Thorley's imagination\r\noutstripped his reason when he described in such glowing terms the\r\nwonderful virtues of his tonic food.\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Lawes, of Rothamstead, than whom there is no more accurate\r\nexperimenter in agricultural practice, states that he made many careful\r\ntrials with Thorley's food, and that he never found it to exercise\r\nthe slightest influence upon the nutrition of the animals fed upon it.\r\nIn his report upon this subject, Mr. Lawes, after describing the\r\nexperiments which he made, sums up as follows:--\r\n\r\n    There is nothing therefore in the above results to recommend the\r\n    use of Thorley's condiment with inferior fattening food, to those\r\n    who feed pigs for profit. In fact, the following balance-sheet of\r\n    the experiment shows that, in fattening for twelve weeks, there\r\n    was a balance of L1 10s. 11d. in favor of the lot fed without\r\n    Thorley's food, notwithstanding that one of the pigs in that lot\r\n    did badly throughout the experiment, as above stated.\r\n\r\n  LOT 1.--WITH BARLEY-MEAL AND BRAN.\r\n\r\n                                                L  s. d.\r\n\r\n  4 pigs bought in at 41s. 6d. each             8  6  0\r\n  1,860-3/4 lbs. barley, at 37s. 6d. per\r\n    quarter of 416 lbs., including grinding     8  7  8-3/4\r\n  1,024-3/4 lbs. bran at 5s. 6d. per cwt.       2 10  3-3/4\r\n                                               ------------\r\n                                               19  4  0-1/2\r\n  88 stone 5 lbs. of pork sold at 4s. 4d.\r\n    per stone, sinking the offal               19  4  0-1/2\r\n\r\n  LOT 2.--WITH BARLEY-MEAL, BRAN, AND THORLEY'S FOOD.\r\n\r\n                                                L  s. d.\r\n\r\n  4 pigs bought in at 41s. 6d. each             8  6  0\r\n  1,862-3/4 lbs. barley, at 37s. 6d. per\r\n    quarter of 416 lbs., including grinding     8  7 10-1/4\r\n  1,020-3/4 lbs. bran at 5s. 6d. per cwt.       2 10  1-1/2\r\n  105 lbs.

The addition of Thorley's condimental food increased the\r\n    amount of food consumed by a given weight of animal within\r\n    a given time.\r\n\r\n    2. When Thorley's condiment was given it required more food\r\n    to produce a given amount of increase in live-weight.\r\n\r\n    3. In fattening for twelve weeks there was a difference of\r\n    L1 10s. 11d. on the lot of 4 pigs in favor of barley-meal\r\n    and bran alone, over barley-meal, bran, and Thorley's food\r\n    in addition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of\r\nEngland, held some time ago, the subject of the nutrimental value of\r\ncondimental cattle food was discussed. As there is scarcely any kind of\r\nquackery, from spirit manifestations to Holloway's pills, that has not\r\ngot its believers, there were, as might have been anticipated, some\r\nvoices raised at this meeting in favor of Thorley's food; but the\r\n_sense_ of the meeting was decidedly against it. Professor Simonds\r\npronounced it to be worthless.\r\n\r\nAlthough the greater number of equine proprietors and feeders of stock\r\nare too sensible to throw their money away in the purchase of those\r\ncostly foods, still there are by no means an insignificant number who\r\nemploy it, under the idea that it preserves the health of the animals;\r\nthese stuffs are also highly appreciated by many grooms and herds.\r\nNow, for the information of all believers, I may state that there is\r\nno mystery whatever in the nature of condimental cattle foods. They\r\nconsist in substance of such matters as linseed-cake, Indian corn,\r\nrice, bean-meal, locust-beans, and malt-combings. These substances\r\nare flavored by the addition of turmeric-root, ginger, coriander-seed,\r\ncarraway-seed, fenugreek-seed, aniseed, liquorice, and similar\r\nsubstances. In addition to the nutritive and flavorous articles employed\r\nin the manufacture of these foods, purely medicinal substances are also\r\nmade use of with the idea that they would prove useful in maintaining\r\nthe health and stimulating the appetite of the animals. These medicinal\r\ningredients constitute but a small proportion of the compound, although\r\nthey add considerably to the cost of manufacture. The following is a\r\nformula for a condimental food, which in every respect will be found\r\nfully equal, if not superior, to the ordinary high-priced articles.\r\n\r\n                                                cwt.   qrs.   lbs.\r\n\r\n  Linseed-meal, or cake                          7      0      0\r\n  Locust beans (ground)                          8      0      0\r\n  Indian corn                                    4      1      0\r\n  Powdered turmeric                              0      1      4\r\n  Ginger                                         0      0      3\r\n  Fenugreek-seed                                 0      0      2\r\n  Gentian                                        0      0     10\r\n  Cream of tartar                                0      0      2\r\n  Sulphur                                        0      0     20\r\n  Common salt                                    0      0     10\r\n  Coriander-seed                                 0      0      5\r\n                                               -----------------\r\n                                                     One ton.\r\n\r\nA ton of condimental food manufactured according to this formula will\r\ncost only about the same amount as an equal weight of linseed, and will\r\nproduce an effect fully equal to that of the food which at one time was\r\nsold at L60 per ton.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the medicinal virtues of these foods, or however\r\nappropriate the term \"condimental\" which has been applied to them,\r\nit is quite certain that their whilom designation \"concentrated\"\r\nwas a misnomer. Their composition shows that they possess a degree of\r\nnutritive power considerably below that of linseed-cake, and but little,\r\nif at all, superior to that of Indian corn.\r\n\r\nThe following analytical statement, which I published some years ago,\r\nwill give an insight into the nature of these articles:--\r\n\r\n  ANALYSES OF CONDIMENTAL FOOD.\r\n\r\n                                           Thorley's.

Cattle and horses out of condition may be\r\nbenefited by its carminative and tonic properties; but if they are, it\r\nsurely must be a bad practice to feed healthy animals upon a substance\r\nwhich is a remedy in disease. It is asserted, and probably with some\r\ndegree of truth, that when dainty, over-fed stock loathe their food,\r\nthey are induced to eat greedily by mixing the \"condimental\" with their\r\nordinary food. If such really be the case, let the feeder compound the\r\narticle himself, and effect thereby a saving of perhaps 50 or 80 per\r\ncent. in the cost of it. A good condimental food, rich in actual\r\nnutriment, and pleasantly flavored, is no doubt a compound which might\r\nbe used with advantage; but it should be sold at a moderate and fair\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: See Transactions of Highland and Agricultural Society of\r\nScotland for 1852.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Zig-zag clover, or Marl grass?

In many plants--such as\r\ntrees--in a certain stage of development, the substance lining the cells\r\nis very hard, and is termed _lignin_, or _sclerogen_.
