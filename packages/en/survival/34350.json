Even in this short interval some new\r\nfacts of unusual importance in palaeontology have come to light, or have\r\nbeen verified for the first time. Instead of introducing these new\r\ndiscoveries into the body of the work, which would render them inaccessible\r\nto the purchasers of the former edition, I have given them in a postscript\r\nto this Preface (printed and sold separately), and have pointed out at the\r\nsame time their bearing on certain questions of the highest theoretical\r\ninterest.[v-A]\r\n\r\nAs on former occasions, I shall take this opportunity of stating that the\r\n\"Manual\" is not an epitome of the \"Principles of Geology,\" nor intended as\r\nintroductory to that work. So much confusion has arisen on this subject,\r\nthat it is desirable to explain fully the different ground occupied by the\r\ntwo publications. The first five editions of the \"Principles\" comprised a\r\n4th book, in which some account was given of systematic geology, and in\r\nwhich the principal rocks composing the earth's crust and their organic\r\nremains were described. In subsequent editions this book was omitted, it\r\nhaving been expanded, in 1838, into a separate treatise called the\r\n\"Elements of Geology,\" first re-edited in 1842, and again recast and\r\nenlarged in 1851, and entitled \"A Manual of Elementary Geology.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the subjects of both treatises relate to geology, as their titles\r\nimply, their scope is very different; the \"Principles\" containing a view of\r\nthe _modern_ changes of the earth and its inhabitants, while the \"Manual\"\r\nrelates to the monuments of _ancient_ changes. In separating the one from\r\nthe other, I have endeavoured to render each complete in itself, and\r\nindependent; but if asked by a student which he should read first, I would\r\nrecommend him to begin with the \"Principles,\" as he may then proceed from\r\nthe known to the unknown, and be provided beforehand with a key for\r\ninterpreting the ancient phenomena, whether of the organic or inorganic\r\nworld, by reference to changes now in progress.\r\n\r\nOwing to the former incorporation of the two subjects in one work, and the\r\nsupposed identity of their subject matter, it may be useful to give here a\r\nbrief abstract of the contents of the \"Principles,\" for the sake of\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abstract of the \"Principles of Geology,\" Eighth Edition._\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n  1.

The inhabitants of the parish being\r\nperfectly familiar with the track of the amphibious mud-turtles or\r\nterrapins of their country, assured Mr. Abraham that the fossil impressions\r\nclosely resembled those left by the recent species on sand or mud. Having\r\nsatisfied himself of the truth of their report, he was struck with the\r\nnovelty and geological interest of the phenomenon. Imagining the rock to be\r\nthe lowest member of the old red sandstone, he was aware that no traces had\r\nas yet been found of a reptile in strata of such high antiquity.\r\n\r\nHe was soon informed by Mr. Logan, at that time engaged in the geological\r\nsurvey of Canada, that the white sandstone above Montreal was really much\r\nolder than the \"Old Red,\" or Devonian. It had in fact been ascertained many\r\nyears before, by the State surveyors of New York (who called it the\r\n\"Potsdam Sandstone\"), to lie at the base of the whole Silurian series. As\r\nsuch it had been pointed out to me in 1841, in the valley of the Mohawk, by\r\nMr. James Hall[vii-A], and its position was correctly described by Mr.\r\nEmmons, on the borders of Lake Champlain, where I examined it in 1842. It\r\nhas there the character of a shallow-water deposit, ripple-marked\r\nthroughout a considerable thickness, and full of a species of Lingula. The\r\nflat valves of this shell, of a dark colour, are so numerous, and so\r\narranged in horizontal layers, as to play the part of mica, causing the\r\nrock to divide into laminae, as in some micaceous sandstones.\r\n\r\nWhen I mentioned this rock in my Travels[vii-B] as occurring between\r\nKingston and Montreal, (the same in which the Chelonian foot-prints have\r\nsince been found,) I spoke of it as the lowest member of the Lower Silurian\r\nseries; but no traces of any organic being of a higher grade than the\r\nLingula had then been seen in it, and I called attention to the singular\r\nfact, that the oldest fossil form then known in the world, was a marine\r\nshell strictly referable to a genus now existing.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1851, Mr. Logan laid before the Geological Society of\r\nLondon a slab of this sandstone from Beauharnais, containing no less than\r\ntwenty-eight foot-prints of the fore and hind feet of a quadruped, and six\r\ncasts in plaster of Paris, exhibiting a continuation of the same trail.\r\nEach cast contained from twenty-six to twenty-eight impressions with a\r\nmedian channel equidistant from the two parallel rows of foot-prints, the\r\none made by the feet of the right side, the other by those of the left. In\r\nthese specimens a greater number of successive foot-marks belonging to one\r\nand the same series were displayed than had ever before been observed in\r\nany rock ancient or modern. Mr. Abraham has inferred that the breadth of\r\nthe quadruped was from five to seven inches. A detailed account of the\r\ntrail was published by Professor Owen, in April 1851, from which the\r\nfollowing extracts are made.\r\n\r\n\"The foot-prints are in pairs, and the pairs extend in two parallel series,\r\nwith a channel exactly midway between the right and left series. The pairs\r\nof the same side succeed each other at intervals, varying from one inch and\r\na half to two inches and a half, the common distance being about two\r\ninches. The interval between the right and left pairs, measured from the\r\ninner border of the small prints, is three inches and a half, and from the\r\nouter border of the exterior or large prints, is seven inches. The shallow\r\nmedian track is one inch and a quarter in breadth, varying in depth, but\r\nnot in its relative position to the right and left foot prints.\"\r\n\r\n\"The inference to be deduced from these characters is, that the impressions\r\nwere made by a quadruped with the hind feet larger and somewhat wider apart\r\nthan the fore feet, with both hind and fore feet either very short, or\r\nprevented by some other part of the animal's structure from making long\r\nsteps; and with the limbs of the right side wide apart from those of the\r\nleft; consequently, that the quadruped had a broad trunk in proportion to\r\nits length, supported on limbs either short, or capable only of short\r\nsteps, and with rounded and stumpy feet, not provided with long claws.\r\nThere are faint traces of a fine reticulate pattern of the cuticle of the\r\nsole at the bottom of some of the foot-prints on one portion of the\r\nsandstone; and the surface of the sand is generally smoother there than\r\nwhere not impressed, which, with the rising of the sand at the border of\r\nthe prints, indicates the weight of the impressing body. The median groove\r\nmay be interpreted as due either to the abdomen or the tail of the animal;\r\nbut as there is no indication of any bending or movement of a tail from\r\nside to side, it was probably scooped out of the soft sand by a hard\r\nbreast-plate or plastron. If this were so, it may be inferred that\r\nthe species was a freshwater or estuary tortoise rather than\r\na land tortoise.\"[viii-A]\r\n\r\nPreviously to this discovery, the trias was the oldest stratum in which\r\nany remains or signs of a Chelonian had been detected. Numerous other\r\ntrails have since been observed (1850-51) in various localities in Canada,\r\nall in the same very ancient fossiliferous rock; and Mr. Logan, who has\r\nvisited the spots, will shortly publish a description of the phenomena.\r\n\r\n_Chelonian foot-prints in Old Red Sandstone, Morayshire._--Captain Lambart\r\nBrickenden has just communicated to the Geological Society of London a\r\ndrawing and description of a continuous series of no less than thirty-four\r\nfoot-prints of a quadruped observed in the course of last year (1850), on a\r\nslab of sandstone quarried at Cummingstone, near Elgin, in Morayshire, a\r\nrock which has always been considered as an upper member of the Devonian or\r\n\"Old Red.\"[ix-A] A part of the track, the course of which was from A to B,\r\nis represented in the annexed woodcut, fig. 521. The foot-prints are in\r\npairs, forming two parallel rows, which are somewhat less distant from each\r\nother than those of the Lower Silurian tortoise of Canada above mentioned.\r\nThe stride, on the other hand, is four inches, or twice that of the\r\nBeauharnais Chelonian. The hind foot is exactly of the same size,\r\nbeing one inch in diameter, and larger than the fore foot in the\r\nproportion of four to three.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 521. Scale one-sixth the original size.\r\n\r\nPart of the trail of a (Chelonian?) quadruped from the Old Red Sandstone of\r\nCummingstone, near Elgin, Morayshire.--Captain Brickenden.]\r\n\r\n_Skeleton of a reptile, allied to the Batrachians, in the Old Red Sandstone\r\nof Morayshire._--Mr. Patrick Duff, author of a \"Sketch of the Geology of\r\nMorayshire\" (Elgin, 1842), obtained recently (October, 1851), from the rock\r\nabove alluded to, the first example ever seen of the skeleton of a reptile\r\nin the Old Red Sandstone. He has kindly allowed me to give a figure of this\r\nfossil, of which Dr. Mantell has drawn up a detailed osteological account\r\nfor publication in the \"Journal of the Geological Society of London.\" The\r\nbones in this specimen have decomposed, but the natural position of almost\r\nall of them can be seen, and nearly perfect casts of their form taken from\r\nthe hollow moulds which they have left. The matrix is a fine-grained,\r\nwhitish sandstone, with a cement of carbonate of lime. The skeleton\r\nexhibits the general characters of the Lacertians, blended with\r\npeculiarities that are Batrachian. Hence Dr. Mantell infers that this\r\nreptile was either a freshwater Batrachian, resembling the Triton, or a\r\nsmall terrestrial Lizard. Slight indications are visible of very minute\r\nconical teeth. Captain Brickenden, who is well acquainted with the geology\r\nof that part of Scotland, informs me that this fossil was found in the Hill\r\nof Spynie, north of the town of Elgin, in a rock quarried for building, and\r\nthe same in which the Chelonian foot-prints, alluded to in the last page,\r\noccur. The skeleton is about four and a half inches in length, but part of\r\nthe tail is concealed in the rock. Dr. Mantell has proposed for it the\r\ngeneric name of Telerpeton, from +tele+, afar off, and +herpeton+, a\r\nreptile; while the specific name Elginense commemorates the principal place\r\nnear which it was obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 522. Natural size. _Telerpeton Elginense._ (Mantell.)\r\n\r\nReptile of Old Red Sandstone, from near Elgin, Morayshire.]\r\n\r\n_Eggs of Batrachians (?) in the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland._--At page\r\n344. of this work I have given two figures (figs. 397 and 398.) of small\r\ngroups of eggs, very common in the shales and sandstones of the \"Old Red\"\r\nof Kincardineshire, Forfarshire, and Fife. I threw out as a conjecture,\r\nthat they might belong to gasteropodous mollusca, like those represented in\r\nfig. 399. p. 345.; but Dr. Mantell, some years ago, showed me a small\r\nbundle of the dried-up eggs of the common English frog (see fig. 524 _a_.),\r\nblack and carbonaceous, and so identical in appearance with the fossils in\r\nquestion, that he suggested the probability of these last being of\r\nBatrachian origin. The plants by which they are often accompanied (fig.\r\n398. p. 344.), I formerly supposed to be Fuci, but Mr. Bunbury tells me\r\nthat their grass-like form agrees well with the idea of their being\r\nfreshwater, and of the family Fluviales.\r\n\r\nThe absence of all shells, so far as our researches have yet gone, in the\r\nslates and sandstones of Scotland above alluded to, raises a presumption\r\nagainst their marine origin, and a still stronger one against the fossil\r\neggs being those of Gasteropoda. It is well known that a single female of\r\nthe Batrachian tribe ejects annually an astonishing quantity of spawn. Mr.\r\nNewport, author of many accurate researches into the metamorphoses of the\r\nAmphibia, having examined my fossils from Forfarshire, concurs in Dr.\r\nMantell's opinion that the clusters of eggs (figs. 397. 398. p. 344.) may\r\nbe those of frogs; while other larger ones, occurring singly or in pairs in\r\nthe same slates, and often attached to a leaf, may be the ova of a gigantic\r\nTriton or Salamander. (See figs. 523, 524, 525.) I may observe that the\r\nsubdivision of the Old Red Sandstone, in which these plants and ova occur\r\n(No. 4. of the section, fig. 62. p. 48.), is considerably lower in position\r\nthan the rock in which the Telerpeton of Elgin is imbedded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 523.

These researches have since been\r\ncarried farther by Professor H. D. Rogers, in the same region of\r\nanthracitic coal, lying on the eastern flank of the Alleghany Mountains.\r\nBeneath the productive coal-measures of that country occurs a dense mass of\r\nred shales and sandstones, which correspond nearly in position to the\r\nmillstone grit and Mountain Limestone of the south-east of England. In\r\nthese beds foot-prints, referred to three species of quadrupeds, have\r\nlately been detected, all of them five-toed and in double rows, with an\r\nopposite symmetry, as if made by right and left feet, while they likewise\r\ndisplay the alternation of fore foot and hind foot. One species, the\r\nlargest of the three, presents a diameter for each foot-print of about two\r\ninches, and shows the fore and hind feet to be nearly equal in dimensions.\r\nIt exhibits a length of stride of about nine inches, and a breadth between\r\nthe right and left treads of nearly four inches. The impressions of the\r\nhind feet are but little in the rear of the fore feet. The animal which\r\nmade them is supposed to have been allied to a Saurian, rather than to a\r\nBatrachian or Chelonian; but more information is required before so\r\ndifficult a point can be decided. With these foot-marks were seen shrinkage\r\ncracks, such as are caused by the sun's heat in mud, and rain-spots, with\r\nthe signs of the trickling of water on a wet, sandy beach; all confirming\r\nthe conclusion derived from the foot-prints, that the quadrupeds belonged\r\nto air-breathers, and not to aquatic races.[xii-A] The Cheirotherian\r\nfoot-prints, figured by me at p. 338., in which the fore and hind feet are\r\nvery unequal in size, betoken a distinct genus, and occur in the midst of\r\nthe productive coal measures, being consequently less ancient.\r\n\r\n_On Fossil Rain-marks of the Carboniferous Period in North\r\nAmerica._--Having alluded to the spots left by rain on the surface of\r\ncarboniferous strata in the Alleghanies, on which quadrupedal foot-prints\r\nare seen, I may mention that similar rain-prints are conspicuous in the\r\ncoal measures of Cape Breton, in Nova Scotia, in which Mr. Richard Brown\r\nhas described Stigmariae and erect trunks of trees, and where there are\r\nproofs, as stated at p. 324., of many fossil forests ranged one above the\r\nother. In such a region, if anywhere, might we expect to detect evidence of\r\nthe fall of rain on a sea-beach, so repeatedly must the conditions of the\r\nsame area have oscillated between land and sea. The intercalation of\r\ndeposits, containing shells of marine or brackish water, indicate the\r\nconstant proximity of a body of salt water when the clays which supported\r\nthe upright trees were formed. In the course of 1851, Mr. Brown had the\r\nkindness to send me some greenish slates from Sydney, Cape Breton, on which\r\nare imprinted very delicate impressions of rain-drops, with several\r\nworm-tracks (_a_, _b_, fig. 526.), such as usually accompany rain-marks on\r\nthe recent mud of the Bay of Fundy, and other modern beaches.[xii-B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 526. Carboniferous rain-prints with worm-tracks (_a_,\r\n_b_) on green shale, from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 527. Casts of rain-prints on a portion of the\r\nsame slab, No. 526. seen on the under side of an incumbent layer\r\nof arenaceous shale.\r\n\r\nThe arrow represents the direction of the shower.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 528. Casts of carboniferous rain-prints and\r\nshrinkage-cracks, (_a_) on the under side of a layer of sandstone, Cape\r\nBreton, Nova Scotia.]\r\n\r\nThe casts of rain-prints, in figs. 527. and 528., project from the under\r\nside of two layers, occurring at different levels, the one a sandy shale,\r\nresting on the green shale (fig. 526.), the other a sandstone presenting a\r\nsimilar warty or blistered surface, on which are also observable some small\r\nridges as at _a_, which stand out in relief, and afford evidence of cracks\r\nformed by the shrinkage of subjacent clay, on which rain had fallen. Many\r\nof the associated sandstones are described by Mr. Brown as ripple-marked.\r\n\r\nThe great humidity of the climate of the coal period had been previously\r\ninferred from the nature of its vegetation and the continuity of its\r\nforests for hundreds of miles; but it is satisfactory to have at length\r\nobtained such positive proofs of showers of rain, the drops of which\r\nresembled in their average size those which now fall from the clouds. From\r\nsuch data we may presume that the atmosphere of the carboniferous period\r\ncorresponded in density with that now investing the globe, and that\r\ndifferent currents of air varied then as now, in temperature, so as to give\r\nrise, by their mixture, to the condensation of aqueous vapour.\r\n\r\n_Triassic Mammifer (Microlestes antiquus Plieninger.)_--In the year 1847,\r\nProfessor Plieninger, of Stuttgart, published a description of two fossil\r\nmolar teeth, referred by him to a warm-blooded quadruped[xiii-A], which he\r\nobtained from a bone-breccia in Wuertemberg occurring between the lias and\r\nthe keuper. As the announcement of so novel a fact has never met with the\r\nattention it deserved, we are indebted to Dr. Jaeger, of Stuttgart, for\r\nhaving recently reminded us of it in his Memoir on the Fossil Mammalia of\r\nWuertemberg.[xiii-B]\r\n\r\nFig. 529. represents the tooth first found, taken from the plate published\r\nin 1847, by Professor Plieninger; and fig. 530. is a drawing of the same\r\nexecuted from the original by Mr. Hermann von Meyer, which he has been\r\nkind enough to send me.

From the trias of Diegerloch, Stuttgart.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Plieninger inferred in 1847, from the double fangs of this tooth\r\nand their unequal size, and from the form and number of the protuberances\r\nor cusps on the flat crowns, that it was the molar of a Mammifer; and\r\nconsidering it as predaceous, probably insectivorous, he called it\r\nMicrolestes, from +mikros+, little, and +lestes+, a beast of prey. Soon\r\nafterwards, he found the second tooth also, at the same locality,\r\nDiegerloch, about two miles to the south-east of Stuttgart. Some of its\r\ncusps are broken, but there seem to have been six of them originally. From\r\nits agreement in general characters, it is supposed by Professor Plieninger\r\nto be referable to the same animal, but as it is four times as big, it may\r\nperhaps have belonged to another allied species. This molar is attached to\r\nthe matrix consisting of sandstone, whereas the tooth, No. 529., is\r\nisolated. Several fragments of bone, differing in structure from that of\r\nthe associated saurians and fish, and believed to be mammiferous, were\r\nimbedded near them in the same rock.\r\n\r\nMr. Waterhouse, of the British Museum, after studying the annexed figs.\r\n529. 531. and the descriptions of Prof. Plieninger, observes, that not only\r\nthe double roots of the teeth and their crowns presenting several cusps,\r\nresemble those of Mammalia, but the cingulum also, or ridge surrounding the\r\nbase of that part of the body of the tooth which was exposed or above the\r\ngum, is a character distinguishing them from fish and reptiles. \"The\r\narrangement of the six cusps or tubercles in two rows, in fig. 529., with a\r\ngroove or depression between them and the oblong form of the tooth, lead\r\nhim, he says, to regard it as a molar of the lower jaw. Both the teeth\r\ndiffer from those of the Stonesfield Mammalia[xiv-A], but do not supply\r\nsufficient data for determining to what order they belonged. Even in regard\r\nto the Stonesfield jaws, where we possess so much ampler materials, we\r\ncannot safely pronounce on the order.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Plieninger has sent me a cast of the smaller tooth, which\r\nexhibits well the characteristic mammalian test, the double fang; but Mr.\r\nOwen, to whom I have shown it, is not able to recognize its affinity with\r\nany mammalian type, recent or extinct, known to him.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the stratum in which the above-mentioned\r\nfossils occur is intermediate between the lias and the uppermost member of\r\nthe trias. That it is really triassic may be deduced from the following\r\nconsiderations. In Wuertemberg there are two \"bone-beds,\" one of great\r\nextent, and very rich in the remains of fish and reptiles, which intervenes\r\nbetween the muschelkalk and keuper, the other, containing the Microlestes,\r\nless extensive and fossiliferous, which rests on the keuper, or superior\r\nmember of the trias, and is covered by the sandstone of the lias. The\r\nlast-mentioned breccia therefore occupies the same place as the well-known\r\nEnglish \"bone-bed\" of Axmouth and Aust-cliff near Bristol, which is\r\nshown[xv-A] to include characteristic species of muschelkalk fish, of the\r\ngenus Saurichthys, Hybodus, and Gyrolepis. In both the Wuertemberg bone-beds\r\nthese three genera are also found, and one of the _species_, Saurichthys\r\nMougeotii, is common to both the lower and upper breccias, as is also a\r\nremarkable reptile called Nothosaurus mirabilis. The Saurian called Belodon\r\nby H. Von Meyer of the Thecodont family, is another Triassic form,\r\nassociated at Diegerloch with Microlestes.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this discovery of Professor Plieninger, the most ancient of\r\nknown fossil Mammalia were those of the Stonesfield slate, a subdivision of\r\nthe Lower Oolite[xv-B] no representative of this class having as yet been\r\nmet with in the Fuller's earth, or inferior Oolite (see Table, p. 258.),\r\nnor in any member of the lias.\r\n\r\n_Thecodont Saurians._--This family of reptiles is common to the Trias and\r\nPermian groups in Germany, and the geologists employed in the government\r\nsurvey of Great Britain have come to the conclusion, that the rock\r\ncontaining the two species alluded to at p. 306., and of which the teeth\r\nare represented in figs. 348, 349., ought rather to be referred to the\r\nTrias than to the Permian group.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRETACEOUS GASTEROPODA.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the chalk of Faxoe in Denmark (p. 210.) or the highest\r\nmember of the Cretaceous series, I have remarked that it is characterized\r\nby univalve Mollusca, both spiral and patelliform, which are wanting or\r\nrare in the white chalk of Europe. This last statement requires, I find,\r\nsome modification. It holds true in regard to certain forms, such as Cypraea\r\nand Oliva, found at Faxoe; but M. A. d'Orbigny enumerates 24 species of\r\nGasteropoda from the white chalk (Terrain Senonien) of France alone. The\r\nsame author describes 134 French species of Gasteropoda from the chloritic\r\nchalk marl and upper greensand (Turonien), 77 from the gault, and 90 from\r\nthe lower greensand (Neocomien), in all 325 species of Gasteropoda, from\r\nthe cretaceous group below the Maestricht beds. Among these he refers 1 to\r\nthe genus Mitra, 17 to Fusus, 17 to Trochus, 4 to Emarginula, and 36 to\r\nCerithium. Notwithstanding, therefore, the peculiarity of the chambered\r\nunivalves of various genera, so abundant in the chalk, the Mollusca of the\r\nperiod approximate in character to the tertiary and recent Fauna far more\r\nthan was formerly supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDICOTYLEDONOUS LEAVES IN LOWER CRETACEOUS STRATA.\r\n\r\nM. Adolphe Brongniart when founding his classification of the fossiliferous\r\nstrata in reference to their imbedded fossil plants, has placed the\r\ncretaceous group in the same division with the tertiary, that is to say, in\r\nhis \"Age of Angiosperms.\"[xvi-A] This arrangement is based on the fact,\r\nthat the cretaceous plants display a transition character from the\r\nvegetation of the secondary to that of the tertiary periods. Coniferae and\r\nCycadeae still flourished as in the preceding oolitic and triassic epochs;\r\nbut with these fossils, some well-marked leaves of dicotyledonous trees\r\nreferred to several species of the genus Credneria, had been found in\r\nGermany in the Quadersandstein and Plaener-kalk. Still more recently, Dr.\r\nDebey of Aix-la-Chapelle has met with a great variety of other leaves of\r\ndicotyledonous plants in the cretaceous flora[xvi-B], of which he\r\nenumerates no less than 26 species, some of the leaves being from four to\r\nsix inches in length, and in a beautiful state of preservation. In the\r\nabsence of the organs of fructification and of fossil fruits, the number of\r\nspecies may be exaggerated; but we may nevertheless affirm, reasoning from\r\nour present data, that in the lower chalk of Aix-la-Chapelle,\r\nDicotyledonous Angiosperms flourished nearly in equal proportions with\r\nGymnosperms; a fact of great significance, as some geologists had wished to\r\nconnect the rarity of dicotyledonous trees with a peculiarity in the state\r\nof the atmosphere in the earlier ages of the planet, imagining that a\r\ndenser air and noxious gases, especially carbonic acid in excess, were\r\nadverse to the prevalence, not only of the quick-breathing classes of\r\nanimals, (mammalia and birds,) but to a flora like that now existing, while\r\nit favoured the predominance of reptile life, and a cryptogamic and\r\ngymnospermous flora. The co-existence, therefore, of dicotyledonous\r\nangiosperms in abundance with Cycads and Coniferae, and with a rich\r\nreptilian fauna comprising the Iguanodon, Ichthyosaurus, Pliosaurus, and\r\nPterodactyl, in the lower cretaceous series tends, like the oolitic\r\nmammalia of Stonesfield and Stuttgart, and the triassic birds of\r\nConnecticut, to dispel the idea of a meteorological state of things in the\r\nsecondary periods widely distinct from that now prevailing.\r\n\r\n_General remarks._--In the preliminary chapters of \"The Principles of\r\nGeology,\" in the first and subsequent editions, I have considered the\r\nquestion, how far the changes of the earth's crust in past times confirm or\r\ninvalidate the popular hypothesis of a gradual improvement in the\r\nhabitable condition of the planet, accompanied by a contemporaneous\r\ndevelopment and progression in organic life. It had long been a favourite\r\ntheory, that in the earlier ages to which we can carry back our geological\r\nresearches, the earth was shaken by more frequent and terrible earthquakes\r\nthan now, and that there was no certainty nor stability in the order of the\r\nnatural world. A few sea-weeds and zoophytes, or plants and animals of the\r\nsimplest organization, were alone capable of existing in a state of things\r\nso unfixed and unstable. But in proportion as the conditions of existence\r\nimproved, and great convulsions and catastrophes became rarer and more\r\npartial, flowering plants were added to the cryptogamic class, and by the\r\nintroduction of more and more perfect species, a varied and complex flora\r\nwas at last established. In like manner, in the animal kingdom, the\r\nzoophyte, the brachiopod, the cephalopod, the fish, the reptile, the bird,\r\nand the warm-blooded quadruped made their entrance into the earth, one\r\nafter the other, until finally, after the close of the tertiary period,\r\ncame the quadrumanous mammalia, most nearly resembling man in outward form\r\nand internal structure, and followed soon afterwards, if not accompanied at\r\nfirst, by the human race itself.\r\n\r\nThe objections which, in 1830, I urged against this doctrine[xvii-A], in so\r\nfar as relates to the passage of the earth from a chaotic to a more settled\r\ncondition, have since been embraced by a large and steadily increasing\r\nschool of geologists; and in reference to the animate world, it will be\r\nseen, on comparing the present state of our knowledge with that which we\r\npossessed twenty years ago, how fully I was justified in declaring the\r\ninsufficiency of the data on which such bold generalizations, respecting\r\nprogressive development, were based. Speaking of the absence, from the\r\ntertiary formations, of fossil Quadrumana, I observed, in 1830, that \"we\r\nhad no right to expect to have detected any remains of tribes which live in\r\ntrees, until we knew more of those quadrupeds which frequent marshes,\r\nrivers, and the borders of lakes, such being usually first met with in a\r\nfossil state.\"[xvii-B] I also added, \"if we are led to infer, from the\r\npresence of crocodiles and turtles in the London clay, and from the\r\ncocoa-nuts and spices found in the isle of Sheppey, that at the period when\r\nour older tertiary strata were formed, the climate was hot enough for the\r\nQuadrumana, we nevertheless could not hope to discover any of their\r\nskeletons, until we had made considerable progress in ascertaining what\r\nwere the contemporary Pachydermata; and not one of these has been\r\ndiscovered as yet in any strata of this epoch in England.\"\r\n\r\nNine years afterwards, when these fossil Pachyderms had been found in the\r\nLondon clay, and in the sandy strata at its base, the remains of a monkey,\r\nof the genus Macacus, were detected near Woodbridge, in Suffolk; and other\r\nQuadrumana had been met with, a short time previously, in different stages\r\nof the tertiary series, in India, France, and Brazil.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the small area of the earth's surface hitherto examined\r\ngeologically, and our scanty acquaintance with the fossil Vertebrata, even\r\nof the environs of great European capitals, it is truly surprising that any\r\nnaturalist should be rash enough to assume that the Lower Eocene deposits\r\nmark the era of the first creation of Quadrumana. It is, however, still\r\nmore unphilosophical to infer from a single extinct species of this order,\r\nobtained in a latitude far from the tropics, that the Eocene Quadrumana had\r\nnot attained as high a grade of organization as those of our own times,\r\nwhen the naturalist is acquainted with all, or nearly all, the species of\r\nmonkeys, apes and orangs which are contemporary with man.\r\n\r\nTo return to the year 1830, Mammalia had not then been traced to rocks of\r\nhigher antiquity than the Stonesfield Oolite, whereas we have just seen\r\nthat memorials of this class have at length made their appearance in the\r\nTrias of Germany. In 1830 birds had been discovered no lower in the series\r\nthan the Paris gypsum, or Middle Eocene. Their bones have now been found\r\nboth in England and the Swiss Alps in the Lower Eocene, and their existence\r\nhas been established by foot-prints in the triassic epoch in North America\r\n(p. 297.). Reptiles in 1830 had not been detected in rocks older than the\r\nMagnesian limestone, or Permian formation; whereas the skeletons of four\r\nspecies have since been brought to light (see p. 336.) in the\r\ncoal-measures, and one in the Old Red sandstone, of Europe, while the\r\nfootprints of three or four more have been observed in carboniferous rocks\r\nof North America, not to mention the chelonian trail above described, from\r\nthe most ancient of the fossiliferous rocks of Canada, the \"Potsdam\r\nSandstone,\" which lies at the base of the Lower Silurian system.\r\n(See above, p. vii.)\r\n\r\nLastly, the remains of fish, which in 1830 were scarcely recognized in\r\ndeposits older than the coal, have now been found plentifully in the\r\nDevonian, and sparingly in the Silurian, strata; though not in any\r\nformation of such high antiquity as the Chelonian of Montreal.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the discovery last mentioned, it was by no means uncommon for\r\npaleontologists to speak with confidence of fish as having been created\r\nbefore reptiles. It was deemed reasonable to suppose that the introduction\r\nof a particular class or order of beings into the planet coincided, in\r\ndate, with the age of the oldest rock to which the remains of that class or\r\norder happened then to have been traced back. To be consistent with\r\nthemselves, the same naturalists ought now to take for granted that\r\nreptiles were called into existence before fish. This they will not do,\r\nbecause such a conclusion would militate against their favourite hypothesis\r\nof an ascending scale, according to which Nature \"evolved the organic\r\nworld,\" rendering it more and more perfect in the lapse of ages.\r\n\r\nIn our efforts to arrive at sound theoretical views on such a question, it\r\nwould seem most natural to turn to the marine invertebrate animals as to a\r\nclass affording the most complete series of monuments that have come down\r\nto us, and where we can find corresponding terms of comparison, in strata\r\nof every age. If, in this more complete series of her archives, Nature had\r\nreally exhibited a more simple grade of organization in fossils of the\r\nremotest antiquity, we might have suspected that there was some foundation\r\nof facts in the theory of successive development. But what do we find? In\r\nthe Lower Silurian there is a full representation of the Radiata, Mollusca,\r\nand Articulata proper to the sea. The marine Fauna, indeed, in those three\r\nclasses, is so rich as almost to imply a more perfect development than that\r\nwhich now peoples the ocean. Thus, in the great division of the Radiata, we\r\nfind asteroid and helianthoid zoophytes, besides crinoid and cystidean\r\nechinoderms. In the Mollusca of the same most ancient epoch M. Barrande\r\nenumerates, in Bohemia alone, the astonishing number of 253 species of\r\nCephalopoda. In the Articulata we have the crustaceans, represented by more\r\nthan 200 species of Trilobites, not to mention other genera.\r\n\r\nIt is only then, in reference to the Vertebrata, that the argument of\r\ndegeneracy in proportion as we trace fossils back to older formations can\r\nbe maintained; and the dogma rests mainly for its support on negative\r\nevidence, whether deduced from the entire absence of the fossil\r\nrepresentatives of certain classes in particular rocks, or the low grade of\r\nthe first few species of a class which chance has thrown in our way.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of all memorials of birds in strata below the Eocene, has been\r\na subject of surprise to some geologists. The bones formerly referred to\r\nbirds in the Wealden and Chalk, are now admitted to have belonged to flying\r\nreptiles, of various sizes, one of them from the Kentish chalk so large as\r\nto have measured 16 feet 6 inches from tip to tip of its outstretched\r\nwings. Whether some elongated bones of the Stonesfield Oolite should be\r\nreferred to birds, which they seem greatly to resemble in microscopic\r\nstructure or to Pterodactyles, is a point now under investigation. If it\r\nshould be proved that no osseous remains of the class Aves have hitherto\r\nbeen derived from any secondary or primary formation, we must not too\r\nhastily conclude that birds were even scarce in these periods. The rarity\r\nof such fossils in the Eocene marine strata is very striking. In 1846,\r\nProfessor Owen, in his \"History of the Fossil Mammalia and Birds of Great\r\nBritain,\" was unable to obtain more than four or five fragments of bones\r\nand skulls of birds from the London Clay, by the aid of which four species\r\nwere recognized. Even so recently, therefore, as 1846, as much was known of\r\nthe Mammalia of the Stonesfield Oolite, as of the ornithic Fauna of our\r\nEnglish Eocene deposits.\r\n\r\nTo reason correctly on the value of negative facts in this branch of\r\nPaleontology, we must first have ascertained how far the relics of birds\r\nare now becoming preserved in new strata, whether marine, fluviatile, or\r\nlacustrine. I have explained, in the \"Principles of Geology,\" that the\r\nimbedding of the bones of living birds in deposits now in progress in\r\ninland lakes appears to be extremely rare. In the shell-marl of Scotland,\r\nwhich is made up bodily of the shells of the genera Limneus, Planorbis,\r\nSuccinea, and Valvata, and in which the skeletons of deer and oxen abound,\r\nwe find no bones of birds. Yet we know that, before the lakes were drained\r\nwhich yield this marl used in agriculture, the surface of the water and the\r\nbordering swamps were covered with wild ducks, herons, and other fowl. They\r\nleft no memorials behind them, because, if they perished on the land, their\r\nbodies decomposed or became the prey of carnivorous animals; if on the\r\nwater, they were buoyant and floated till they were devoured by predaceous\r\nfish or birds. The same causes of obliteration have no power to efface the\r\nfoot-prints which the same creatures may leave, under favourable\r\ncircumstances, imprinted on an ancient mud-bank or shore, on which new\r\nstrata may be from time to time thrown down. In the red mud of recent\r\norigin spread over wide areas by the high tides of the bay of Fundy,\r\ninnumerable foot-tracks of recent birds (Tringa minuta) are preserved in\r\nsuccessive layers, and hardened by the sun. Yet none of the bones of these\r\nbirds, though diligently searched for, have yet been discovered in digging\r\ntrenches through the red mud. It is true that, in a few spots, the bones of\r\nbirds have been met with plentifully in the older tertiary strata, but\r\nalways in rocks of freshwater origin, such as the Paris gypsum or the\r\nlacustrine limestone of the Limagne d'Auvergne. In strata of the same\r\nage, in Belgium and other European countries, or in the United States,\r\nwhere no less careful search has been made, few, if any, fossil birds\r\nhave come to light.\r\n\r\nWe ought, therefore, most clearly to perceive that it is no part of the\r\nplan of Nature to hand down to after times a complete or systematic record\r\nof the former history of the animate world. The preservation of the relics,\r\neven of aquatic tribes of animals, is an exception to the general rule,\r\nalthough time may so multiply exceptional cases that they may seem to\r\nconstitute the rule; and may thus impose upon the imagination, leading us\r\nto infer the non-existence of creatures of which no monuments are extant.\r\nHitherto our acquaintance with the birds, and even the Mammalia, of the\r\nEocene period has depended, almost everywhere, on single specimens, or on a\r\nfew individuals found in one spot. It has therefore depended on what we\r\ncommonly call chance; and we must not wonder if the casual discovery of a\r\ntertiary, secondary, or primary rock, rich in fossil impressions of the\r\nfoot-prints of birds or quadrupeds, should modify or suddenly overthrow all\r\ntheories based on negative facts.\r\n\r\nThe chief reason why we meet more readily with the remains of every class\r\nin tertiary than in secondary strata, is simply that the older rocks are\r\nmore and more exclusively marine in proportion as we depart farther and\r\nfarther from periods during which the existing continents were built up.\r\nThe secondary and primary formations are, for the most part, marine,--not\r\nbecause the ocean was more universal in past times, but because the epochs\r\nwhich preceded the Eocene were so distant from our own, that entire\r\ncontinents have been since submerged.\r\n\r\nI have alluded at p. 299. to Mr. Darwin's account of the South American\r\nOstriches, seen on the coast of Buenos Ayres, walking at low water over\r\nextensive mud-banks, which are then dry, for the sake of feeding on small\r\nfish. Perhaps no bird of such perfect organization as the eagle or vulture\r\nmay ever accompany these ostriches. Certainly, we cannot expect the condor\r\nof the Andes to leave its trail on such a shore; and no traveller, after\r\nsearching for footprints along the whole eastern coast of South America,\r\nwould venture to speculate, from the results of such an inquiry, on the\r\nextent, variety, or development of the feathered Fauna of the interior\r\nof that continent.\r\n\r\nThe absence of Cetacea from rocks older than the Eocene has been frequently\r\nadduced as lending countenance to the theory of the late appearance of the\r\nhighest class of Vertebrata on the earth. That we have hitherto failed to\r\ndetect them in the Oolite or Trias, does not imply, as we have now seen,\r\nthat Mammalia were not then created. Even in the Eocene strata of Europe,\r\nthe discovery of Cetaceans has never kept pace with that of land\r\nquadrupeds. The only instance cited in Great Britain is a species of\r\nMonodon, from the London clay, of doubtful authenticity as to its\r\ngeological position. On the other hand, the gigantic Zeuglodon of North\r\nAmerica (see p. 207.), occurs abundantly in the Middle Eocene strata\r\nof Georgia and Alabama, from which as yet no bones of land-quadrupeds\r\nhave been obtained.\r\n\r\nProfessor Sedgwick states in a recent work[xxi-A], that he possesses in the\r\nWoodwardian Museum, a mass of anchylosed cervical vertebrae of a whale which\r\nhe found near Ely, and which he believes to have been washed out of the\r\nKimmeridge clay, a member of the Upper Oolite; but its true geological site\r\nis not well determined. It differs, says Professor Owen, from any other\r\nknown fossil or recent whale.\r\n\r\nIn the present imperfect state then of our information, we can scarcely say\r\nmore than that the Cetacea may have been scarce, in the secondary and\r\nprimary periods. It is quite conceivable that when aquatic saurians, some\r\nof them carnivorous, like the Ichthyosaurus, were swarming in the sea, and\r\nwhen there were large herbivorous reptiles, like the Iguanodon, on the\r\nland, such reptiles may, to a certain extent, have superseded the Cetacea,\r\nand discharged their functions in the animal economy.\r\n\r\nThe views which I proposed originally in the Principles of Geology in\r\nopposition to the theory of progressive development may be thus briefly\r\nexplained. From the earliest period at which plants and animals can be\r\nproved to have existed, there has been a continual change going on in the\r\nposition of land and sea, accompanied by great fluctuations of climate. To\r\nthese ever-varying geographical and climatal conditions the state of the\r\nanimate world has been unceasingly adapted. No satisfactory proof has yet\r\nbeen discovered of the gradual passage of the earth from a chaotic to a\r\nmore habitable state, nor of a law of progressive development governing the\r\nextinction and renovation of species, and causing the Fauna and Flora to\r\npass from an embryonic to a more perfect condition, from a simple to a\r\nmore complex organization.\r\n\r\nThe principle of adaptation above alluded to, appears to have been\r\nanalogous to that which now peoples the arctic, temperate, and tropical\r\nregions contemporaneously with distinct assemblages of species and\r\ngenera, or which independently of mere temperature gives rise to a\r\npredominance of the marsupial tribe of quadrupeds in Australia, and\r\nof the placental tribe in Asia and Europe, or to a profusion of reptiles\r\nwithout mammalia in the Galapagos Archipelago, and of mammalia without\r\nreptiles in Greenland.[xxii-A]\r\n\r\nThis theory implies, almost necessarily, a very unequal representation at\r\nsuccessive periods of the principal classes and orders of plants and\r\nanimals, if not in the whole globe, at least throughout very wide areas.\r\nThus, for example, the proportional number of genera, species, and\r\nindividuals in the vertebrate class may differ, in two different and\r\ndistinct epochs, to an extent unparalleled by any two contemporaneous\r\nFaunas, because in the course of millions of ages, the contrast of climate\r\nand geographical conditions may exceed the difference now observable in\r\npolar and equatorial latitudes.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude by observing, that if the doctrine of successive\r\ndevelopment had been paleontologically true, as the new discoveries above\r\nenumerated show that it is not; if the sponge, the cephalopod, the fish,\r\nthe reptile, the bird, and the mammifer had followed each other in regular\r\nchronological order--the creation of each class being separated from the\r\nother by vast intervals of time; and if it were admitted that Man was\r\ncreated last of all, still we should by no means be able to recognize, in\r\nhis entrance upon the earth, the last term of one and the same series of\r\nprogressive developments. For the superiority of Man, as compared to the\r\nirrational mammalia, is one of kind, rather than of degree, consisting in a\r\nrational and moral nature, with an intellect capable of indefinite\r\nprogression, and not in the perfection of his physical organization, or\r\nthose instincts in which he resembles the brutes. He may be considered as a\r\nlink in the same unbroken chain of being, if we regard him simply as a new\r\nspecies--a member of the animal kingdom--subject, like other species, to\r\ncertain fixed and invariable laws, and adapted like them to the state of\r\nthe animate and inanimate world prevailing at the time of his creation.\r\nPhysically considered, he may form part of an indefinite series of\r\nterrestrial changes past, present, and to come; but morally and\r\nintellectually he may belong to another system of things--of things\r\nimmaterial--a system which is not permitted to interrupt or disturb the\r\ncourse of the material world, or the laws which govern its changes.[xxii-B]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[vii-A] Travels in North America by the Author, vol. ii. chap. 22.\r\n\r\n[vii-B] Ibid. 1842.\r\n\r\n[viii-A] Quart.

These are the first inquiries with which Geology is\r\noccupied, a science which derives its name from the Greek +ge+, _ge_, the\r\nearth, and +logos+, _logos_, a discourse. Previously to experience we might\r\nhave imagined that investigations of this kind would relate exclusively to\r\nthe mineral kingdom, and to the various rocks, soils, and metals, which\r\noccur upon the surface of the earth, or at various depths beneath it. But,\r\nin pursuing such researches, we soon find ourselves led on to consider the\r\nsuccessive changes which have taken place in the former state of the\r\nearth's surface and interior, and the causes which have given rise to these\r\nchanges; and, what is still more singular and unexpected, we soon become\r\nengaged in researches into the history of the animate creation, or of the\r\nvarious tribes of animals and plants which have, at different periods of\r\nthe past, inhabited the globe.\r\n\r\nAll are aware that the solid parts of the earth consist of distinct\r\nsubstances, such as clay, chalk, sand, limestone, coal, slate, granite, and\r\nthe like; but previously to observation it is commonly imagined that all\r\nthese had remained from the first in the state in which we now see\r\nthem,--that they were created in their present form, and in their present\r\nposition. The geologist soon comes to a different conclusion, discovering\r\nproofs that the external parts of the earth were not all produced in the\r\nbeginning of things, in the state in which we now behold them, nor in an\r\ninstant of time. On the contrary, he can show that they have acquired their\r\nactual configuration and condition gradually, under a great variety of\r\ncircumstances, and at successive periods, during each of which distinct\r\nraces of living beings have flourished on the land and in the waters, the\r\nremains of these creatures still lying buried in the crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nBy the \"earth's crust,\" is meant that small portion of the exterior of our\r\nplanet which is accessible to human observation, or on which we are enabled\r\nto reason by observations made at or near the surface. These reasonings may\r\nextend to a depth of several miles, perhaps ten miles; and even then it may\r\nbe said, that such a thickness is no more than 1/400 part of the distance\r\nfrom the surface to the centre. The remark is just; but although the\r\ndimensions of such a crust are, in truth, insignificant when compared to\r\nthe entire globe, yet they are vast, and of magnificent extent in relation\r\nto man, and to the organic beings which people our globe. Referring to this\r\nstandard of magnitude, the geologist may admire the ample limits of his\r\ndomain, and admit, at the same time, that not only the exterior of the\r\nplanet, but the entire earth, is but an atom in the midst of the countless\r\nworlds surveyed by the astronomer.\r\n\r\nThe materials of this crust are not thrown together confusedly; but\r\ndistinct mineral masses, called rocks, are found to occupy definite spaces,\r\nand to exhibit a certain order of arrangement. The term _rock_ is applied\r\nindifferently by geologists to all these substances, whether they be soft\r\nor stony, for clay and sand are included in the term, and some have even\r\nbrought peat under this denomination. Our older writers endeavoured to\r\navoid offering such violence to our language, by speaking of the component\r\nmaterials of the earth as consisting of rocks and _soils_. But there is\r\noften so insensible a passage from a soft and incoherent state to that of\r\nstone, that geologists of all countries have found it indispensable to have\r\none technical term to include both, and in this sense we find _roche_\r\napplied in French, _rocca_ in Italian, and _felsart_ in German. The\r\nbeginner, however, must constantly bear in mind, that the term rock by no\r\nmeans implies that a mineral mass is in an indurated or stony condition.\r\n\r\nThe most natural and convenient mode of classifying the various rocks which\r\ncompose the earth's crust, is to refer, in the first place, to their\r\norigin, and in the second to their relative age. I shall therefore begin by\r\nendeavouring briefly to explain to the student how all rocks may be divided\r\ninto four great classes by reference to their different origin, or, in\r\nother words, by reference to the different circumstances and causes by\r\nwhich they have been produced.\r\n\r\nThe first two divisions, which will at once be understood as natural, are\r\nthe aqueous and volcanic, or the products of watery and those of igneous\r\naction at or near the surface.\r\n\r\n_Aqueous rocks._--The aqueous rocks, sometimes called the sedimentary, or\r\nfossiliferous, cover a larger part of the earth's surface than any others.\r\nThese rocks are _stratified_, or divided into distinct layers, or strata.\r\nThe term _stratum_ means simply a bed, or any thing spread out or _strewed_\r\nover a given surface; and we infer that these strata have been generally\r\nspread out by the action of water, from what we daily see taking place near\r\nthe mouths of rivers, or on the land during temporary inundations. For,\r\nwhenever a running stream charged with mud or sand, has its velocity\r\nchecked, as when it enters a lake or sea, or overflows a plain, the\r\nsediment, previously held in suspension by the motion of the water, sinks,\r\nby its own gravity, to the bottom. In this manner layers of mud and sand\r\nare thrown down one upon another.\r\n\r\nIf we drain a lake which has been fed by a small stream, we frequently find\r\nat the bottom a series of deposits, disposed with considerable regularity,\r\none above the other; the uppermost, perhaps, may be a stratum of peat, next\r\nbelow a more dense and solid variety of the same material; still lower a\r\nbed of shell-marl, alternating with peat or sand, and then other beds of\r\nmarl, divided by layers of clay. Now, if a second pit be sunk through the\r\nsame continuous lacustrine _formation_, at some distance from the first,\r\nnearly the same series of beds is commonly met with, yet with slight\r\nvariations; some, for example, of the layers of sand, clay, or marl, may be\r\nwanting, one or more of them having thinned out and given place to others,\r\nor sometimes one of the masses first examined is observed to increase in\r\nthickness to the exclusion of other beds.\r\n\r\nThe term \"_formation_,\" which I have used in the above explanation,\r\nexpresses in geology any assemblage of rocks which have some character in\r\ncommon, whether of origin, age, or composition. Thus we speak of stratified\r\nand unstratified, freshwater and marine, aqueous and volcanic, ancient and\r\nmodern, metalliferous and non-metalliferous formations.\r\n\r\nIn the estuaries of large rivers, such as the Ganges and the Mississippi,\r\nwe may observe, at low water, phenomena analogous to those of the drained\r\nlakes above mentioned, but on a grander scale, and extending over areas\r\nseveral hundred miles in length and breadth. When the periodical\r\ninundations subside, the river hollows out a channel to the depth of many\r\nyards through horizontal beds of clay and sand, the ends of which are seen\r\nexposed in perpendicular cliffs. These beds vary in colour, and are\r\noccasionally characterized by containing drift-wood or shells. The shells\r\nmay belong to species peculiar to the river, but are sometimes those of\r\nmarine testacea, washed into the mouth of the estuary during storms.\r\n\r\nThe annual floods of the Nile in Egypt are well known, and the fertile\r\ndeposits of mud which they leave on the plains. This mud is _stratified_,\r\nthe thin layer thrown down in one season differing slightly in colour from\r\nthat of a previous year, and being separable from it, as has been observed\r\nin excavations at Cairo, and other places.[3-A]\r\n\r\nWhen beds of sand, clay, and marl, containing shells and vegetable matter,\r\nare found arranged in a similar manner in the interior of the earth, we\r\nascribe to them a similar origin; and the more we examine their characters\r\nin minute detail, the more exact do we find the resemblance. Thus, for\r\nexample, at various heights and depths in the earth, and often far from\r\nseas, lakes, and rivers, we meet with layers of rounded pebbles composed\r\nof different rocks mingled together. They are like the shingle of a\r\nsea-beach, or pebbles formed in the beds of torrents and rivers, which are\r\ncarried down into the ocean wherever these descend from high grounds\r\nbordering a coast. There the gravel is spread out by the waves and currents\r\nover a considerable space; but during seasons of drought the torrents and\r\nrivers are nearly dry, and have only power to convey fine sand or mud into\r\nthe sea. Hence, alternate layers of gravel and fine sediment accumulate\r\nunder water, and such alternations are found by geologists in the interior\r\nof every continent.[4-A]\r\n\r\nIf a stratified arrangement, and the rounded forms of pebbles, are alone\r\nsufficient to lead us to the conclusion that certain rocks originated under\r\nwater, this opinion is farther confirmed by the distinct and independent\r\nevidence of _fossils_, so abundantly included in the earth's crust. By a\r\n_fossil_ is meant any body, or the traces of the existence of any body,\r\nwhether animal or vegetable, which has been buried in the earth by natural\r\ncauses. Now the remains of animals, especially of aquatic species, are\r\nfound almost everywhere imbedded in stratified rocks, and sometimes, in the\r\ncase of limestone, they are in such abundance as to constitute the entire\r\nmass of the rock itself. Shells and corals are the most frequent, and with\r\nthem are often associated the bones and teeth of fishes, fragments of wood,\r\nimpressions of leaves, and other organic substances. Fossil shells, of\r\nforms such as now abound in the sea, are met with far inland, both near the\r\nsurface, and at great depths below it. They occur at all heights above the\r\nlevel of the ocean, having been observed at elevations of 8000 feet in the\r\nPyrenees, 10,000 in the Alps, 13,000 in the Andes, and above 16,000 feet\r\nin the Himalayas.[4-B]\r\n\r\nThese shells belong mostly to marine testacea, but in some places\r\nexclusively to forms characteristic of lakes and rivers. Hence it is\r\nconcluded that some ancient strata were deposited at the bottom of the sea,\r\nand others in lakes and estuaries.\r\n\r\nWhen geology was first cultivated, it was a general belief, that these\r\nmarine shells and other fossils were the effects and proofs of the deluge\r\nof Noah; but all who have carefully investigated the phenomena have long\r\nrejected this doctrine. A transient flood might be supposed to leave behind\r\nit, here and there upon the surface, scattered heaps of mud, sand, and\r\nshingle, with shells confusedly intermixed; but the strata containing\r\nfossils are not superficial deposits, and do not simply cover the earth,\r\nbut constitute the entire mass of mountains. Nor are the fossils mingled\r\nwithout reference to the original habits and natures of the creatures of\r\nwhich they are the memorials; those, for example, being found associated\r\ntogether which lived in deep or in shallow water, near the shore or far\r\nfrom it, in brackish or in salt water.\r\n\r\nIt has, moreover, been a favourite notion of some modern writers, who were\r\naware that fossil bodies could not all be referred to the deluge, that\r\nthey, and the strata in which they are entombed, might have been deposited\r\nin the bed of the ocean during the period which intervened between the\r\ncreation of man and the deluge. They have imagined that the antediluvian\r\nbed of the ocean, after having been the receptacle of many stratified\r\ndeposits, became converted, at the time of the flood, into the lands which\r\nwe inhabit, and that the ancient continents were at the same time\r\nsubmerged, and became the bed of the present sea. This hypothesis, although\r\npreferable to the diluvial theory before alluded to, since it admits that\r\nall fossiliferous strata were successively thrown down from water, is yet\r\nwholly inadequate to explain the repeated revolutions which the earth has\r\nundergone, and the signs which the existing continents exhibit, in most\r\nregions, of having emerged from the ocean at an era far more remote than\r\nfour thousand years from the present time. Ample proofs of these reiterated\r\nrevolutions will be given in the sequel, and it will be seen that many\r\ndistinct sets of sedimentary strata, each several hundreds or thousands of\r\nfeet thick, are piled one upon the other in the earth's crust, each\r\ncontaining peculiar fossil animals and plants which are distinguishable\r\nwith few exceptions from species now living. The mass of some of these\r\nstrata consists almost entirely of corals, others are made up of shells,\r\nothers of plants turned into coal, while some are without fossils. In one\r\nset of strata the species of fossils are marine; in another, lying\r\nimmediately above or below, they as clearly prove that the deposit was\r\nformed in a brackish estuary or lake. When the student has more fully\r\nexamined into these appearances, he will become convinced that the time\r\nrequired for the origin of the rocks composing the actual continents must\r\nhave been far greater than that which is conceded by the theory above\r\nalluded to; and likewise that no one universal and sudden conversion of sea\r\ninto land will account for geological appearances.\r\n\r\nWe have now pointed out one great class of rocks, which, however they may\r\nvary in mineral composition, colour, grain, or other characters, external\r\nand internal, may nevertheless be grouped together as having a common\r\norigin. They have all been formed under water, in the same manner as\r\nmodern accumulations of sand, mud, shingle, banks of shells, reefs of\r\ncoral, and the like, and are all characterized by stratification or\r\nfossils, or by both.\r\n\r\n_Volcanic rocks._--The division of rocks which we may next consider are the\r\nvolcanic, or those which have been produced at or near the surface whether\r\nin ancient or modern times, not by water, but by the action of fire or\r\nsubterranean heat. These rocks are for the most part unstratified, and are\r\ndevoid of fossils. They are more partially distributed than aqueous\r\nformations, at least in respect to horizontal extension. Among those parts\r\nof Europe where they exhibit characters not to be mistaken, I may mention\r\nnot only Sicily and the country round Naples, but Auvergne, Velay, and\r\nVivarais, now the departments of Puy de Dome, Haute Loire, and Ardeche,\r\ntowards the centre and south of France, in which are several hundred\r\nconical hills having the forms of modern volcanos, with craters more or\r\nless perfect on many of their summits. These cones are composed moreover\r\nof lava, sand, and ashes, similar to those of active volcanos. Streams of\r\nlava may sometimes be traced from the cones into the adjoining valleys,\r\nwhere they have choked up the ancient channels of rivers with solid rock,\r\nin the same manner as some modern flows of lava in Iceland have been known\r\nto do, the rivers either flowing beneath or cutting out a narrow passage on\r\none side of the lava. Although none of these French volcanos have been in\r\nactivity within the period of history or tradition, their forms are often\r\nvery perfect. Some, however, have been compared to the mere skeletons of\r\nvolcanos, the rains and torrents having washed their sides, and removed all\r\nthe loose sand and scoriae, leaving only the harder and more solid\r\nmaterials. By this erosion, and by earthquakes, their internal structure\r\nhas occasionally been laid open to view, in fissures and ravines; and we\r\nthen behold not only many successive beds and masses of porous lava, sand,\r\nand scoriae, but also perpendicular walls, or _dikes_, as they are called,\r\nof volcanic rock, which have burst through the other materials. Such dikes\r\nare also observed in the structure of Vesuvius, Etna, and other active\r\nvolcanos. They have been formed by the pouring of melted matter, whether\r\nfrom above or below, into open fissures, and they commonly traverse\r\ndeposits of _volcanic tuff_, a substance produced by the showering down\r\nfrom the air, or incumbent waters, of sand and cinders, first shot up from\r\nthe interior of the earth by the explosions of volcanic gases.\r\n\r\nBesides the parts of France above alluded to, there are other countries, as\r\nthe north of Spain, the south of Sicily, the Tuscan territory of Italy, the\r\nlower Rhenish provinces, and Hungary, where spent volcanos may be seen,\r\nstill preserving in many cases a conical form, and having craters and often\r\nlava-streams connected with them.\r\n\r\nThere are also other rocks in England, Scotland, Ireland, and almost every\r\ncountry in Europe, which we infer to be of igneous origin, although they do\r\nnot form hills with cones and craters. Thus, for example, we feel assured\r\nthat the rock of Staffa, and that of the Giant's Causeway, called basalt,\r\nis volcanic, because it agrees in its columnar structure and mineral\r\ncomposition with streams of lava which we know to have flowed from the\r\ncraters of volcanos. We find also similar basaltic and other igneous rocks\r\nassociated with beds of _tuff_ in various parts of the British Isles, and\r\nforming _dikes_, such as have been spoken of; and some of the strata\r\nthrough which these dikes cut are occasionally altered at the point of\r\ncontact, as if they had been exposed to the intense heat of melted matter.\r\n\r\nThe absence of cones and craters, and long narrow streams of superficial\r\nlava, in England and many other countries, is principally to be attributed\r\nto the eruptions having been submarine, just as a considerable proportion\r\nof volcanos in our own times burst out beneath the sea. But this question\r\nmust be enlarged upon more fully in the chapters on Igneous Rocks, in which\r\nit will also be shown, that as different sedimentary formations, containing\r\neach their characteristic fossils, have been deposited at successive\r\nperiods, so also volcanic sand and scoriae have been thrown out, and lavas\r\nhave flowed over the land or bed of the sea, at many different epochs, or\r\nhave been injected into fissures; so that the igneous as well as the\r\naqueous rocks may be classed as a chronological series of monuments,\r\nthrowing light on a succession of events in the history of the earth.\r\n\r\n_Plutonic rocks_ (Granite, &c.).--We have now pointed out the existence of\r\ntwo distinct orders of mineral masses, the aqueous and the volcanic: but if\r\nwe examine a large portion of a continent, especially if it contain within\r\nit a lofty mountain range, we rarely fail to discover two other classes of\r\nrocks, very distinct from either of those above alluded to, and which we\r\ncan neither assimilate to deposits such as are now accumulated in lakes or\r\nseas, nor to those generated by ordinary volcanic action. The members of\r\nboth these divisions of rocks agree in being highly crystalline and\r\ndestitute of organic remains. The rocks of one division have been called\r\nplutonic, comprehending all the granites and certain porphyries, which are\r\nnearly allied in some of their characters to volcanic formations. The\r\nmembers of the other class are stratified and often slaty, and have been\r\ncalled by some the _crystalline schists_, in which group are included\r\ngneiss, micaceous-schist (or mica-slate), hornblende-schist, statuary\r\nmarble, the finer kinds of roofing slate, and other rocks afterwards\r\nto be described.\r\n\r\nAs it is admitted that nothing strictly analogous to these crystalline\r\nproductions can now be seen in the progress of formation on the earth's\r\nsurface, it will naturally be asked, on what data we can find a place for\r\nthem in a system of classification founded on the origin of rocks. I\r\ncannot, in reply to this question, pretend to give the student, in a few\r\nwords, an intelligible account of the long chain of facts and reasonings by\r\nwhich geologists have been led to infer the analogy of the rocks in\r\nquestion to others now in progress at the surface. The result, however, may\r\nbe briefly stated. All the various kinds of granite, which constitute the\r\nplutonic family, are supposed to be of igneous origin, but to have been\r\nformed under great pressure, at considerable depths in the earth, or\r\nsometimes, perhaps, under a certain weight of incumbent water. Like the\r\nlava of volcanos, they have been melted, and have afterwards cooled and\r\ncrystallized, but with extreme slowness, and under conditions very\r\ndifferent from those of bodies cooling in the open air. Hence they differ\r\nfrom the volcanic rocks, not only by their more crystalline texture, but\r\nalso by the absence of tuffs and breccias, which are the products of\r\neruptions at the earth's surface, or beneath seas of inconsiderable depth.\r\nThey differ also by the absence of pores or cellular cavities, to which the\r\nexpansion of the entangled gases gives rise in ordinary lava.\r\n\r\nAlthough granite has often pierced through other strata, it has rarely, if\r\never, been observed to rest upon them, as if it had overflowed. But as this\r\nis continually the case with the volcanic rocks, they have been styled,\r\nfrom this peculiarity, \"overlying\" by Dr. MacCulloch; and Mr. Necker has\r\nproposed the term \"underlying\" for the granites, to designate the opposite\r\nmode in which they almost invariably present themselves.\r\n\r\n_Metamorphic, or stratified crystalline rocks._--The fourth and last great\r\ndivision of rocks are the crystalline strata and slates, or schists, called\r\ngneiss, mica-schist, clay-slate, chlorite-schist, marble, and the like, the\r\norigin of which is more doubtful than that of the other three classes. They\r\ncontain no pebbles, or sand, or scoriae, or angular pieces of imbedded\r\nstone, and no traces of organic bodies, and they are often as crystalline\r\nas granite, yet are divided into beds, corresponding in form and\r\narrangement to those of sedimentary formations, and are therefore said to\r\nbe stratified. The beds sometimes consist of an alternation of substances\r\nvarying in colour, composition, and thickness, precisely as we see in\r\nstratified fossiliferous deposits. According to the Huttonian theory, which\r\nI adopt as most probable, and which will be afterwards more fully\r\nexplained, the materials of these strata were originally deposited from\r\nwater in the usual form of sediment, but they were subsequently so altered\r\nby subterranean heat, as to assume a new texture. It is demonstrable, in\r\nsome cases at least, that such a complete conversion has actually taken\r\nplace, fossiliferous strata having exchanged an earthy for a highly\r\ncrystalline texture for a distance of a quarter of a mile from their\r\ncontact with granite. In some cases, dark limestones, replete with shells\r\nand corals, have been turned into white statuary marble, and hard clays\r\ninto slates called mica-schist and hornblende-schist, all signs of organic\r\nbodies having been obliterated.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are in a great degree ignorant of the precise nature of the\r\ninfluence exerted in these cases, yet it evidently bears some analogy to\r\nthat which volcanic heat and gases are known to produce; and the action may\r\nbe conveniently called plutonic, because it appears to have been developed\r\nin those regions where plutonic rocks are generated, and under similar\r\ncircumstances of pressure and depth in the earth. Whether hot water or\r\nsteam permeating stratified masses, or electricity, or any other causes\r\nhave co-operated to produce the crystalline texture, may be matter of\r\nspeculation, but it is clear that the plutonic influence has sometimes\r\npervaded entire mountain masses of strata.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the hypothesis above alluded to, I proposed in the first\r\nedition of the Principles of Geology (1833), the term \"Metamorphic\" for the\r\naltered strata, a term derived from +meta+, meta, _trans_, and +morphe+,\r\nmorphe, _forma_.\r\n\r\nHence there are four great classes of rocks considered in reference to\r\ntheir origin,--the aqueous, the volcanic, the plutonic, and the\r\nmetamorphic. In the course of this work it will be shown, that portions of\r\neach of these four distinct classes have originated at many successive\r\nperiods. They have all been produced contemporaneously, and may even now be\r\nin the progress of formation. It is not true, as was formerly supposed,\r\nthat all granites, together with the crystalline or metamorphic strata,\r\nwere first formed, and therefore entitled to be called \"primitive,\" and\r\nthat the aqueous and volcanic rocks were afterwards superimposed, and\r\nshould, therefore, rank as secondary in the order of time. This idea was\r\nadopted in the infancy of the science, when all formations, whether\r\nstratified or unstratified, earthy or crystalline, with or without fossils,\r\nwere alike regarded as of aqueous origin. At that period it was naturally\r\nargued, that the foundation must be older than the superstructure; but it\r\nwas afterwards discovered, that this opinion was by no means in every\r\ninstance a legitimate deduction from facts; for the inferior parts of the\r\nearth's crust have often been modified, and even entirely changed, by the\r\ninfluence of volcanic and other subterranean causes, while superimposed\r\nformations have not been in the slightest degree altered. In other words,\r\nthe destroying and renovating processes have given birth to new rocks\r\nbelow, while those above, whether crystalline or fossiliferous, have\r\nremained in their ancient condition. Even in cities, such as Venice and\r\nAmsterdam, it cannot be laid down as universally true, that the upper parts\r\nof each edifice, whether of brick or marble, are more modern than the\r\nfoundations on which they rest, for these often consist of wooden piles,\r\nwhich may have rotted and been replaced one after the other, without the\r\nleast injury to the buildings above; meanwhile, these may have required\r\nscarcely any repair, and may have been constantly inhabited. So it is with\r\nthe habitable surface of our globe, in its relation to large masses of rock\r\nimmediately below: it may continue the same for ages, while subjacent\r\nmaterials, at a great depth, are passing from a solid to a fluid state, and\r\nthen reconsolidating, so as to acquire a new texture.\r\n\r\nAs all the crystalline rocks may, in some respects, be viewed as belonging\r\nto one great family, whether they be stratified or unstratified, plutonic\r\nor metamorphic, it will often be convenient to speak of them by one common\r\nname. It being now ascertained, as above stated, that they are of very\r\ndifferent ages, sometimes newer than the strata called secondary, the term\r\nprimary, which was formerly used for the whole, must be abandoned, as it\r\nwould imply a manifest contradiction. It is indispensable, therefore, to\r\nfind a new name, one which must not be of chronological import, and must\r\nexpress, on the one hand, some peculiarity equally attributable to granite\r\nand gneiss (to the plutonic as well as the _altered_ rocks), and, on the\r\nother, must have reference to characters in which those rocks differ, both\r\nfrom the volcanic and from the _unaltered_ sedimentary strata. I proposed\r\nin the Principles of Geology (first edition, vol. iii.), the term\r\n\"hypogene\" for this purpose, derived from +hypo+, _under_, and +ginomai+,\r\n_to be_, or _to be born_; a word implying the theory that granite, gneiss,\r\nand the other crystalline formations are alike _nether-formed_ rocks, or\r\nrocks which have not assumed their present form and structure at the\r\nsurface. This occurs in the lowest place in the order of superposition.\r\nEven in regions such as the Alps, where some masses of granite and gneiss\r\ncan be shown to be of comparatively modern date, belonging, for example, to\r\nthe period hereafter to be described as tertiary, they are still\r\n_underlying_ rocks. They never repose on the volcanic or trappean\r\nformations, nor on strata containing organic remains. They are _hypogene_,\r\nas \"being under\" all the rest.\r\n\r\nFrom what has now been said, the reader will understand that each of the\r\nfour great classes of rocks may be studied under two distinct points of\r\nview; first, they may be studied simply as mineral masses deriving their\r\norigin from particular causes, and having a certain composition, form, and\r\nposition in the earth's crust, or other characters both positive and\r\nnegative, such as the presence or absence of organic remains. In the second\r\nplace, the rocks of each class may be viewed as a grand chronological\r\nseries of monuments, attesting a succession of events in the former history\r\nof the globe and its living inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI shall accordingly proceed to treat of each family of rocks; first, in\r\nreference to those characters which are not chronological, and then in\r\nparticular relation to the several periods when they were formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3-A] See Principles of Geology, by the Author, Index, \"Nile,\"\r\n\"Rivers,\" &c.\r\n\r\n[4-A] See p. 18.\r\n\r\n[4-B] See Geograph.

We may first study them\r\nwith reference to their mineral composition, external appearance, position,\r\nmode of origin, organic contents, and other characters which belong to them\r\nas aqueous formations, independently of their age, and we may afterwards\r\nconsider them chronologically or with reference to the successive\r\ngeological periods when they originated.\r\n\r\nI have already given an outline of the data which led to the belief that\r\nthe stratified and fossiliferous rocks were originally deposited under\r\nwater; but, before entering into a more detailed investigation, it will be\r\ndesirable to say something of the ordinary materials of which such strata\r\nare composed. These may be said to belong principally to three divisions,\r\nthe arenaceous, the argillaceous, and the calcareous, which are formed\r\nrespectively of sand, clay, and carbonate of lime. Of these, the\r\narenaceous, or sandy masses, are chiefly made up of siliceous or flinty\r\ngrains; the argillaceous, or clayey, of a mixture of siliceous matter,\r\nwith a certain proportion, about a fourth in weight, of aluminous earth;\r\nand, lastly, the calcareous rocks or limestones consist of carbonic\r\nacid and lime.\r\n\r\n_Arenaceous or siliceous rocks._--To speak first of the sandy division:\r\nbeds of loose sand are frequently met with, of which the grains consist\r\nentirely of silex, which term comprehends all purely siliceous minerals, as\r\nquartz and common flint. Quartz is silex in its purest form; flint usually\r\ncontains some admixture of alumine and oxide of iron. The siliceous grains\r\nin sand are usually rounded, as if by the action of running water.\r\nSandstone is an aggregate of such grains, which often cohere together\r\nwithout any visible cement, but more commonly are bound together by a\r\nslight quantity of siliceous or calcareous matter, or by iron or clay.\r\n\r\nPure siliceous rocks may be known by not effervescing when a drop of\r\nnitric, sulphuric, or other acid is applied to them, or by the grains not\r\nbeing readily scratched or broken by ordinary pressure. In nature there is\r\nevery intermediate gradation, from perfectly loose sand, to the hardest\r\nsandstone. In _micaceous sandstones_ mica is very abundant; and the thin\r\nsilvery plates into which that mineral divides, are often arranged in\r\nlayers parallel to the planes of stratification, giving a slaty or\r\nlaminated texture to the rock.\r\n\r\nWhen sandstone is coarse-grained, it is usually called _grit_. If the\r\ngrains are rounded, and large enough to be called pebbles, it becomes a\r\n_conglomerate_, or _pudding-stone_, which may consist of pieces of one or\r\nof many different kinds of rock. A conglomerate, therefore, is simply\r\ngravel bound together by a cement.\r\n\r\n_Argillaceous rocks._--Clay, strictly speaking, is a mixture of silex or\r\nflint with a large proportion, usually about one fourth, of alumine, or\r\nargil; but, in common language, any earth which possesses sufficient\r\nductility, when kneaded up with water, to be fashioned like paste by the\r\nhand, or by the potter's lathe, is called a _clay_; and such clays vary\r\ngreatly in their composition, and are, in general, nothing more than mud\r\nderived from the decomposition or wearing down of various rocks. The purest\r\nclay found in nature is porcelain clay, or kaolin, which results from the\r\ndecomposition of a rock composed of felspar and quartz, and it is almost\r\nalways mixed with quartz.[11-A] _Shale_ has also the property, like clay,\r\nof becoming plastic in water: it is a more solid form of clay, or\r\nargillaceous matter, condensed by pressure. It usually divides into\r\nirregular laminae.\r\n\r\nOne general character of all argillaceous rocks is to give out a peculiar,\r\nearthy odour when breathed upon, which is a test of the presence of\r\nalumine, although it does not belong to pure alumine, but, apparently, to\r\nthe combination of that substance with oxide of iron.[11-B]\r\n\r\n_Calcareous rocks._--This division comprehends those rocks which, like\r\nchalk, are composed chiefly of lime and carbonic acid. Shells and corals\r\nare also formed of the same elements, with the addition of animal matter.\r\nTo obtain pure lime it is necessary to calcine these calcareous substances,\r\nthat is to say, to expose them to heat of sufficient intensity to drive off\r\nthe carbonic acid, and other volatile matter, without vitrifying or melting\r\nthe lime itself. White chalk is often pure carbonate of lime; and this\r\nrock, although usually in a soft and earthy state, is sometimes\r\nsufficiently solid to be used for building, and even passes into a\r\n_compact_ stone, or a stone of which the separate parts are so minute as\r\nnot to be distinguishable from each other by the naked eye.\r\n\r\nMany limestones are made up entirely of minute fragments of shells and\r\ncoral, or of calcareous sand cemented together. These last might be called\r\n\"calcareous sandstones;\" but that term is more properly applied to a rock\r\nin which the grains are partly calcareous and partly siliceous, or to\r\nquartzose sandstones, having a cement of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nThe variety of limestone called \"oolite\" is composed of numerous small\r\negg-like grains, resembling the roe of a fish, each of which has usually a\r\nsmall fragment of sand as a nucleus, around which concentric layers of\r\ncalcareous matter have accumulated.\r\n\r\nAny limestone which is sufficiently hard to take a fine polish is called\r\n_marble_. Many of these are fossiliferous; but statuary marble, which is\r\nalso called saccharine limestone, as having a texture resembling that of\r\nloaf-sugar, is devoid of fossils, and is in many cases a member of the\r\nmetamorphic series.\r\n\r\n_Siliceous limestone_ is an intimate mixture of carbonate of lime and\r\nflint, and is harder in proportion as the flinty matter predominates.\r\n\r\nThe presence of carbonate of lime in a rock may be ascertained by applying\r\nto the surface a small drop of diluted sulphuric, nitric, or muriatic\r\nacids, or strong vinegar; for the lime, having a greater chemical affinity\r\nfor any one of these acids than for the carbonic, unites immediately with\r\nthem to form new compounds, thereby becoming a sulphate, nitrate, or\r\nmuriate of lime. The carbonic acid, when thus liberated from its union with\r\nthe lime, escapes in a gaseous form, and froths up or effervesces as it\r\nmakes its way in small bubbles through the drop of liquid. This\r\neffervescence is brisk or feeble in proportion as the limestone is\r\npure or impure, or, in other words, according to the quantity of foreign\r\nmatter mixed with the carbonate of lime. Without the aid of this test,\r\nthe most experienced eye cannot always detect the presence of carbonate\r\nof lime in rocks.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned three classes of rocks, the siliceous, argillaceous,\r\nand calcareous, pass continually into each other, and rarely occur in a\r\nperfectly separate and pure form. Thus it is an exception to the general\r\nrule to meet with a limestone as pure as ordinary white chalk, or with clay\r\nas aluminous as that used in Cornwall for porcelain, or with sand so\r\nentirely composed of siliceous grains as the white sand of Alum Bay in the\r\nIsle of Wight, or sandstone so pure as the grit of Fontainebleau, used for\r\npavement in France. More commonly we find sand and clay, or clay and marl,\r\nintermixed in the same mass. When the sand and clay are each in\r\nconsiderable quantity, the mixture is called _loam_. If there is much\r\ncalcareous matter in clay it is called _marl_; but this term has\r\nunfortunately been used so vaguely, as often to be very ambiguous. It has\r\nbeen applied to substances in which there is no lime; as, to that red loam\r\nusually called red marl in certain parts of England. Agriculturists were in\r\nthe habit of calling any soil a marl, which, like true marl, fell to pieces\r\nreadily on exposure to the air. Hence arose the confusion of using this\r\nname for soils which, consisting of loam, were easily worked by the plough,\r\nthough devoid of lime.\r\n\r\n_Marl slate_ bears the same relation to marl which shale bears to clay,\r\nbeing a calcareous shale. It is very abundant in some countries, as in the\r\nSwiss Alps. Argillaceous or marly limestone is also of common occurrence.\r\n\r\nThere are few other kinds of rock which enter so largely into the\r\ncomposition of sedimentary strata as to make it necessary to dwell here on\r\ntheir characters. I may, however, mention two others,--magnesian limestone\r\nor dolomite, and gypsum. _Magnesian limestone_ is composed of carbonate of\r\nlime and carbonate of magnesia; the proportion of the latter amounting in\r\nsome cases to nearly one half. It effervesces much more slowly and feebly\r\nwith acids than common limestone. In England this rock is generally of a\r\nyellowish colour; but it varies greatly in mineralogical character, passing\r\nfrom an earthy state to a white compact stone of great hardness.\r\n_Dolomite_, so common in many parts of Germany and France, is also a\r\nvariety of magnesian limestone, usually of a granular texture.\r\n\r\n_Gypsum._--Gypsum is a rock composed of sulphuric acid, lime, and water. It\r\nis usually a soft whitish-yellow rock, with a texture resembling that of\r\nloaf-sugar, but sometimes it is entirely composed of lenticular crystals.\r\nIt is insoluble in acids, and does not effervesce like chalk and dolomite,\r\nbecause it does not contain carbonic acid gas, or fixed air, the lime being\r\nalready combined with sulphuric acid, for which it has a stronger affinity\r\nthan for any other. Anhydrous gypsum is a rare variety, into which water\r\ndoes not enter as a component part. Gypseous marl is a mixture of gypsum\r\nand marl. Alabaster is a granular and compact variety of gypsum found in\r\nmasses large enough to be used in sculpture and architecture. It is\r\nsometimes a pure snow-white substance, as that of Volterra in Tuscany, well\r\nknown as being carved for works of art in Florence and Leghorn. It is a\r\nsofter stone than marble, and more easily wrought.\r\n\r\n_Forms of stratification._--A series of strata sometimes consists of one of\r\nthe above rocks, sometimes of two or more in alternating beds. Thus, in the\r\ncoal districts of England, for example, we often pass through several beds\r\nof sandstone, some of finer, others of coarser grain, some white, others of\r\na dark colour, and below these, layers of shale and sandstone or beds of\r\nshale, divisible into leaf-like laminae, and containing beautiful\r\nimpressions of plants. Then again we meet with beds of pure and impure\r\ncoal, alternating with shales and sandstones, and underneath the whole,\r\nperhaps, are calcareous strata, or beds of limestone, filled with corals\r\nand marine shells, each bed distinguishable from another by certain\r\nfossils, or by the abundance of particular species of shells or zoophytes.\r\n\r\nThis alternation of different kinds of rock produces the most distinct\r\nstratification; and we often find beds of limestone and marl, conglomerate\r\nand sandstone, sand and clay, recurring again and again, in nearly regular\r\norder, throughout a series of many hundred strata. The causes which may\r\nproduce these phenomena are various, and have been fully discussed in my\r\ntreatise on the modern changes of the earth's surface.[14-A] It is there\r\nseen that rivers flowing into lakes and seas are charged with sediment,\r\nvarying in quantity, composition, colour, and grain according to the\r\nseasons; the waters are sometimes flooded and rapid, at other periods low\r\nand feeble; different tributaries, also, draining peculiar countries and\r\nsoils, and therefore charged with peculiar sediment, are swollen at\r\ndistinct periods. It was also shown that the waves of the sea and\r\ncurrents undermine the cliffs during wintry storms, and sweep away\r\nthe materials into the deep, after which a season of tranquillity\r\nsucceeds, when nothing but the finest mud is spread by the movements\r\nof the ocean over the same submarine area.\r\n\r\nIt is not the object of the present work to give a description of these\r\noperations, repeated as they are, year after year, and century after\r\ncentury; but I may suggest an explanation of the manner in which some\r\nmicaceous sandstones have originated, those in which we see innumerable\r\nthin layers of mica dividing layers of fine quartzose sand. I observed the\r\nsame arrangement of materials in recent mud deposited in the estuary of La\r\nRoche St. Bernard in Brittany, at the mouth of the Loire. The surrounding\r\nrocks are of gneiss, which, by its waste, supplies the mud: when this dries\r\nat low water, it is found to consist of brown laminated clay, divided by\r\nthin seams of mica. The separation of the mica in this case, or in that of\r\nmicaceous sandstones, may be thus understood. If we take a handful of\r\nquartzose sand, mixed with mica, and throw it into a clear running stream,\r\nwe see the materials immediately sorted by the water, the grains of quartz\r\nfalling almost directly to the bottom, while the plates of mica take a much\r\nlonger time to reach the bottom, and are carried farther down the stream.\r\nAt the first instant the water is turbid, but immediately after the flat\r\nsurfaces of the plates of mica are seen alone reflecting a silvery light,\r\nas they descend slowly, to form a distinct micaceous lamina. The mica is\r\nthe heavier mineral of the two; but it remains longer suspended, owing to\r\nits great extent of surface. It is easy, therefore, to perceive that where\r\nsuch mud is acted upon by a river or tidal current, the thin plates of mica\r\nwill be carried farther, and not deposited in the same places as the\r\ngrains of quartz; and since the force and velocity of the stream varies\r\nfrom time to time, layers of mica or of sand will be thrown down\r\nsuccessively on the same area.\r\n\r\n_Original horizontality._--It has generally been said that the upper and\r\nunder surfaces of strata, or the planes of stratification, as they are\r\ntermed, are parallel. Although this is not strictly true, they make an\r\napproach to parallelism, for the same reason that sediment is usually\r\ndeposited at first in nearly horizontal layers. The reason of this\r\narrangement can by no means be attributed to an original evenness or\r\nhorizontality in the bed of the sea; for it is ascertained that in those\r\nplaces where no matter has been recently deposited, the bottom of the ocean\r\nis often as uneven as that of the dry land, having in like manner its\r\nhills, valleys, and ravines. Yet if the sea should sink, or the water be\r\nremoved near the mouth of a large river where a delta has been forming, we\r\nshould see extensive plains of mud and sand laid dry, which, to the eye,\r\nwould appear perfectly level, although, in reality, they would slope gently\r\nfrom the land towards the sea.\r\n\r\nThis tendency in newly-formed strata to assume a horizontal position arises\r\nprincipally from the motion of the water, which forces along particles of\r\nsand or mud at the bottom, and causes them to settle in hollows or\r\ndepressions, where they are less exposed to the force of a current than\r\nwhen they are resting on elevated points. The velocity of the current and\r\nthe motion of the superficial waves diminish from the surface downwards,\r\nand are least in those depressions where the water is deepest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nA good illustration of the principle here alluded to may be sometimes seen\r\nin the neighbourhood of a volcano, when a section, whether natural or\r\nartificial, has laid open to view a succession of various-coloured layers\r\nof sand and ashes, which have fallen in showers upon uneven ground. Thus\r\nlet A B (fig. 1.) be two ridges, with an intervening valley. These original\r\ninequalities of the surface have been gradually effaced by beds of sand and\r\nashes _c_, _d_, _e_, the surface at e being quite level. It will be seen\r\nthat although the materials of the first layers have accommodated\r\nthemselves in a great degree to the shape of the ground A B, yet each bed\r\nis thickest at the bottom. At first a great many particles would be carried\r\nby their own gravity down the steep sides of A and B, and others would\r\nafterwards be blown by the wind as they fell off the ridges, and would\r\nsettle in the hollow, which would thus become more and more effaced as the\r\nstrata accumulated from _c_ to _e_. This levelling operation may perhaps be\r\nrendered more clear to the student by supposing a number of parallel\r\ntrenches to be dug in a plain of moving sand, like the African desert, in\r\nwhich case the wind would soon cause all signs of these trenches to\r\ndisappear, and the surface would be as uniform as before. Now, water in\r\nmotion can exert this levelling power on similar materials more easily\r\nthan air, for almost all stones lose in water more than a third of the\r\nweight which they have in air, the specific gravity of rocks being in\r\ngeneral as 2-1/2 when compared to that of water, which is estimated at 1.\r\nBut the buoyancy of sand or mud would be still greater in the sea, as the\r\ndensity of salt water exceeds that of fresh.\r\n\r\nYet, however uniform and horizontal may be the surface of new deposits in\r\ngeneral, there are still many disturbing causes, such as eddies in the\r\nwater, and currents moving first in one and then in another direction,\r\nwhich frequently cause irregularities. We may sometimes follow a bed of\r\nlimestone, shale, or sandstone, for a distance of many hundred yards\r\ncontinuously; but we generally find at length that each individual stratum\r\nthins out, and allows the beds which were previously above and below it to\r\nmeet. If the materials are coarse, as in grits and conglomerates, the same\r\nbeds can rarely be traced many yards without varying in size, and often\r\ncoming to an end abruptly. (See fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Section of strata of sandstone, grit,\r\nand conglomerate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Section of sand at Sandy Hill, near Biggleswade,\r\nBedfordshire. Height 20 feet. (Greensand formation.)]\r\n\r\n_Diagonal or Cross Stratification._--There is also another phenomenon of\r\nfrequent occurrence. We find a series of larger strata, each of which is\r\ncomposed of a number of minor layers placed obliquely to the general planes\r\nof stratification. To this diagonal arrangement the name of \"false or cross\r\nstratification\" has been given. Thus in the annexed section (fig. 3.) we\r\nsee seven or eight large beds of loose sand, yellow and brown, and the\r\nlines _a_, _b_, _c_, mark some of the principal planes of stratification,\r\nwhich are nearly horizontal. But the greater part of the subordinate laminae\r\ndo not conform to these planes, but have often a steep slope, the\r\ninclination being sometimes towards opposite points of the compass. When\r\nthe sand is loose and incoherent, as in the case here represented, the\r\ndeviation from parallelism of the slanting laminae cannot possibly be\r\naccounted for by any re-arrangement of the particles acquired during the\r\nconsolidation of the rock. In what manner then can such irregularities be\r\ndue to original deposition? We must suppose that at the bottom of the sea,\r\nas well as in the beds of rivers, the motions of waves, currents, and\r\neddies often cause mud, sand, and gravel to be thrown down in heaps on\r\nparticular spots, instead of being spread out uniformly over a wide area.\r\nSometimes, when banks are thus formed, currents may cut passages through\r\nthem, just as a river forms its bed. Suppose the bank A (fig. 4.) to be\r\nthus formed with a steep sloping side, and the water being in a tranquil\r\nstate, the layer of sediment No. 1. is thrown down upon it, conforming\r\nnearly to its surface. Afterwards the other layers, 2, 3, 4, may be\r\ndeposited in succession, so that the bank B C D is formed. If the current\r\nthen increases in velocity, it may cut away the upper portion of this mass\r\ndown to the dotted line _e_ (fig. 4.), and deposit the materials thus\r\nremoved farther on, so as to form the layers 5, 6, 7, 8. We have now the\r\nbank B C D E (fig. 5.), of which the surface is almost level, and on which\r\nthe nearly horizontal layers, 9, 10, 11, may then accumulate. It was shown\r\nin fig. 3. that the diagonal layers of successive strata may sometimes have\r\nan opposite slope. This is well seen in some cliffs of loose sand on the\r\nSuffolk coast. A portion of one of these is represented in fig. 6., where\r\nthe layers, of which there are about six in the thickness of an inch, are\r\ncomposed of quartzose grains. This arrangement may have been due to the\r\naltered direction of the tides and currents in the same place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Cross section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.

Dolomite and sandstone. (Greensand formation?)\r\n  _a_, _b_, _d_. Beds of gravel and sand.\r\n  _c._ Fine marl and sand of St. Madeleine, with marine shells.]\r\n\r\nThe description above given of the slanting position of the minor layers\r\nconstituting a single stratum is in certain cases applicable on a much\r\ngrander scale to masses several hundred feet thick, and many miles in\r\nextent. A fine example may be seen at the base of the Maritime Alps near\r\nNice. The mountains here terminate abruptly in the sea, so that a depth of\r\nmany hundred fathoms is often found within a stone's throw of the beach,\r\nand sometimes a depth of 3000 feet within half a mile. But at certain\r\npoints, strata of sand, marl, or conglomerate, intervene between the shore\r\nand the mountains, as in the annexed fig. 7., where a vast succession of\r\nslanting beds of gravel and sand may be traced from the sea to Monte Calvo,\r\na distance of no less than 9 miles in a straight line. The dip of these\r\nbeds is remarkably uniform, being always southward or towards the\r\nMediterranean, at an angle of about 25 deg.. They are exposed to view in nearly\r\nvertical precipices, varying from 200 to 600 feet in height, which bound\r\nthe valley through which the river Magnan flows. Although in a general\r\nview, the strata appear to be parallel and uniform, they are nevertheless\r\nfound, when examined closely, to be wedge-shaped, and to thin out when\r\nfollowed for a few hundred feet or yards, so that we may suppose them to\r\nhave been thrown down originally upon the side of a steep bank, where a\r\nriver or alpine torrent discharged itself into a deep and tranquil sea, and\r\nformed a delta, which advanced gradually from the base of Monte Calvo to a\r\ndistance of 9 miles from the original shore. If subsequently this part of\r\nthe Alps and bed of the sea were raised 700 feet, the coast would acquire\r\nits present configuration, the delta would emerge, and a deep channel might\r\nthen be cut through it by a river.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the torrents and streams, which now descend from the\r\nalpine declivities to the shore, bring down annually, when the snow melts,\r\nvast quantities of shingle and sand, and then, as they subside, fine mud,\r\nwhile in summer they are nearly or entirely dry; so that it may be safely\r\nassumed, that deposits like those of the valley of the Magnan, consisting\r\nof coarse gravel alternating with fine sediment, are still in progress at\r\nmany points, as, for instance, at the mouth of the Var. They must advance\r\nupon the Mediterranean in the form of great shoals terminating in a steep\r\ntalus; such being the original mode of accumulation of all coarse\r\nmaterials conveyed into deep water, especially where they are composed in\r\ngreat part of pebbles, which cannot be transported to indefinite distances\r\nby currents of moderate velocity. By inattention to facts and inferences of\r\nthis kind, a very exaggerated estimate has sometimes been made of the\r\nsupposed depth of the ancient ocean. There can be no doubt, for example,\r\nthat the strata _a_, fig. 7., or those nearest to Monte Calvo, are older\r\nthan those indicated by _b_, and these again were formed before _c_; but\r\nthe vertical depth of gravel and sand in any one place cannot be proved to\r\namount even to 1000 feet, although it may perhaps be much greater, yet\r\nprobably never exceeding at any point 3000 or 4000 feet. But were we to\r\nassume that all the strata were once horizontal, and that their present dip\r\nor inclination was due to subsequent movements, we should then be forced to\r\nconclude, that a sea 9 miles deep had been filled up with alternate layers\r\nof mud and pebbles thrown down one upon another.\r\n\r\nIn the locality now under consideration, situated a few miles to the west\r\nof Nice, there are many geological data, the details of which cannot be\r\ngiven in this place, all leading to the opinion, that when the deposit of\r\nthe Magnan was formed, the shape and outline of the alpine declivities and\r\nthe shore greatly resembled what we now behold at many points in the\r\nneighbourhood. That the beds, a, b, c, d, are of comparatively modern date\r\nis proved by this fact, that in seams of loamy marl intervening between the\r\npebbly beds are fossil shells, half of which belong to species now living\r\nin the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Slab of ripple-marked (new red) sandstone\r\nfrom Cheshire.]\r\n\r\n_Ripple mark._--The ripple mark, so common on the surface of sandstones of\r\nall ages (see fig. 8.), and which is so often seen on the sea-shore at low\r\ntide, seems to originate in the drifting of materials along the bottom of\r\nthe water, in a manner very similar to that which may explain the inclined\r\nlayers above described. This ripple is not entirely confined to the beach\r\nbetween high and low water mark, but is also produced on sands which are\r\nconstantly covered by water. Similar undulating ridges and furrows may also\r\nbe sometimes seen on the surface of drift snow and blown sand. The\r\nfollowing is the manner in which I once observed the motion of the air to\r\nproduce this effect on a large extent of level beach, exposed at low tide\r\nnear Calais. Clouds of fine white sand were blown from the neighbouring\r\ndunes, so as to cover the shore, and whiten a dark level surface of sandy\r\nmud, and this fresh covering of sand was beautifully rippled. On levelling\r\nall the small ridges and furrows of this ripple over an area of several\r\nyards square, I saw them perfectly restored in about ten minutes, the\r\ngeneral direction of the ridges being always at right angles to that of the\r\nwind. The restoration began by the appearance here and there of small\r\ndetached heaps of sand, which soon lengthened and joined together, so as to\r\nform long sinuous ridges with intervening furrows. Each ridge had one side\r\nslightly inclined, and the other steep; the lee-side being always steep, as\r\n_b, c,--d, e_; the windward-side a gentle slope, as _a, b,--c, d_, fig. 9.\r\nWhen a gust of wind blew with sufficient force to drive along a cloud of\r\nsand, all the ridges were seen to be in motion at once, each encroaching on\r\nthe furrow before it, and, in the course of a few minutes, filling the\r\nplace which the furrows had occupied. The mode of advance was by the\r\ncontinual drifting of grains of sand up the slopes _a b_ and _c d_, many of\r\nwhich grains, when they arrived at _b_ and _d_, fell over the scarps _b c_\r\nand _d e_, and were under shelter from the wind; so that they remained\r\nstationary, resting, according to their shape and momentum, on different\r\nparts of the descent, and a few only rolling to the bottom. In this manner\r\neach ridge was distinctly seen to move slowly on as often as the force of\r\nthe wind augmented. Occasionally part of a ridge, advancing more rapidly\r\nthan the rest, overtook the ridge immediately before it, and became\r\nconfounded with it, thus causing those bifurcations and branches which are\r\nso common, and two of which are seen in the slab, fig. 8. We may observe\r\nthis configuration in sandstones of all ages, and in them also, as now on\r\nthe sea-coast, we may often detect two systems of ripples interfering with\r\neach other; one more ancient and half effaced, and a newer one, in which\r\nthe grooves and ridges are more distinct, and in a different direction.\r\nThis crossing of two sets of ripples arises from a change of wind, and the\r\nnew direction in which the waves are thrown on the shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Sketch of ripples.]\r\n\r\nThe ripple mark is usually an indication of a sea-beach, or of water\r\nfrom 6 to 10 feet deep, for the agitation caused by waves even during\r\nstorms extends to a very slight depth. To this rule, however, there are\r\nsome exceptions, and recent ripple marks have been observed at the depth\r\nof 60 or 70 feet. It has also been ascertained that currents or large\r\nbodies of water in motion may disturb mud and sand at the depth of 300\r\nor even 450 feet.[21-A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11-A] The kaolin of China consists of 71.15 parts of silex, 15.86 of\r\nalumine, 1.92 of lime, and 6.73 of water (W.

We should often be unable to detect any signs\r\nof stratification or of successive deposition, if particular kinds of\r\nfossils did not occur here and there at certain depths in the mass. At one\r\nlevel, for example, univalve shells of some one or more species\r\npredominate; at another, bivalve shells; and at a third, corals; while in\r\nsome formations we find layers of vegetable matter, commonly derived from\r\nland plants, separating strata.\r\n\r\nIt may appear inconceivable to a beginner how mountains, several thousand\r\nfeet thick, can have become filled with fossils from top to bottom; but the\r\ndifficulty is removed, when he reflects on the origin of stratification, as\r\nexplained in the last chapter, and allows sufficient time for the\r\naccumulation of sediment. He must never lose sight of the fact that, during\r\nthe process of deposition, each separate layer was once the uppermost, and\r\ncovered immediately by the water in which aquatic animals lived. Each\r\nstratum in fact, however far it may now lie beneath the surface, was once\r\nin the state of shingle, or loose sand or soft mud at the bottom of the\r\nsea, in which shells and other bodies easily became enveloped.\r\n\r\nBy attending to the nature of these remains, we are often enabled to\r\ndetermine whether the deposition was slow or rapid, whether it took\r\nplace in a deep or shallow sea, near the shore or far from land, and\r\nwhether the water was salt, brackish, or fresh. Some limestones consist\r\nalmost exclusively of corals, and in many cases it is evident that the\r\npresent position of each fossil zoophyte has been determined by the\r\nmanner in which it grew originally. The axis of the coral, for example,\r\nif its natural growth is erect, still remains at right angles to the\r\nplane of stratification. If the stratum be now horizontal, the round\r\nspherical heads of certain species continue uppermost, and their points\r\nof attachment are directed downwards. This arrangement is sometimes\r\nrepeated throughout a great succession of strata. From what we know of\r\nthe growth of similar zoophytes in modern reefs, we infer that the rate\r\nof increase was extremely slow, and some of the fossils must have\r\nflourished for ages like forest trees, before they attained so large a\r\nsize. During these ages, the water remained clear and transparent, for\r\nsuch corals cannot live in turbid water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Fossil _Gryphaea_, covered both on the outside and\r\ninside with fossil serpulae.]\r\n\r\nIn like manner, when we see thousands of full-grown shells dispersed every\r\nwhere throughout a long series of strata, we cannot doubt that time was\r\nrequired for the multiplication of successive generations; and the evidence\r\nof slow accumulation is rendered more striking from the proofs, so often\r\ndiscovered, of fossil bodies having lain for a time on the floor of the\r\nocean after death before they were imbedded in sediment. Nothing, for\r\nexample, is more common than to see fossil oysters in clay, with serpulae,\r\nor barnacles (acorn-shells), or corals, and other creatures, attached to\r\nthe inside of the valves, so that the mollusk was certainly not buried in\r\nargillaceous mud the moment it died. There must have been an interval\r\nduring which it was still surrounded with clear water, when the testacea,\r\nnow adhering to it, grew from an embryo state to full maturity. Attached\r\nshells which are merely external, like some of the serpulae (_a_) in the\r\nannexed figure (fig. 10.), may often have grown upon an oyster or other\r\nshell while the animal within was still living; but if they are found on\r\nthe inside, it could only happen after the death of the inhabitant of the\r\nshell which affords the support. Thus, in fig. 10., it will be seen that\r\ntwo serpulae have grown on the interior, one of them exactly on the place\r\nwhere the adductor muscle of the _Gryphaea_ (a kind of oyster) was fixed.\r\n\r\nSome fossil shells, even if simply attached to the _outside_ of others,\r\nbear full testimony to the conclusion above alluded to, namely, that an\r\ninterval elapsed between the death of the creature to whose shell they\r\nadhere, and the burial of the same in mud or sand. The sea-urchins or\r\n_Echini_, so abundant in white chalk, afford a good illustration. It is\r\nwell known that these animals, when living, are invariably covered with\r\nnumerous spines, which serve as organs of motion, and are supported by rows\r\nof tubercles, which last are only seen after the death of the sea-urchin,\r\nwhen the spines have dropped off. In fig. 12. a living species of\r\n_Spatangus_, common on our coast, is represented with one half of its shell\r\nstripped of the spines. In fig. 11. a fossil of the same genus from the\r\nwhite chalk of England shows the naked surface which the individuals of\r\nthis family exhibit when denuded of their bristles. The full-grown\r\n_Serpula_, therefore, which now adheres externally, could not have begun to\r\ngrow till the _Spatangus_ had died, and the spines were detached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. _Serpula_ attached to a fossil _Spatangus_\r\nfrom the chalk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Recent _Spatangus_ with the spines removed\r\nfrom one side.\r\n\r\n  _b._ Spine and tubercles, nat. size.\r\n  _a._ The same magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Echinus_ from the chalk, with lower valve of the _Crania_ attached.\r\n  _b._ Upper valve of the _Crania_ detached.]\r\n\r\nNow the series of events here attested by a single fossil may be carried a\r\nstep farther. Thus, for example, we often meet with a sea-urchin in the\r\nchalk (see fig. 13.), which has fixed to it the lower valve of a\r\n_Crania_, a genus of bivalve mollusca. The upper valve (_b_, fig. 13.)\r\nis almost invariably wanting, though occasionally found in a perfect\r\nstate of preservation in white chalk at some distance. In this case, we\r\nsee clearly that the sea-urchin first lived from youth to age, then died\r\nand lost its spines, which were carried away. Then the young _Crania_\r\nadhered to the bared shell, grew and perished in its turn; after which\r\nthe upper valve was separated from the lower before the _Echinus_ became\r\nenveloped in chalky mud.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to mention one more illustration of the manner in which\r\nsingle fossils may sometimes throw light on a former state of things, both\r\nin the bed of the ocean and on some adjoining land. We meet with many\r\nfragments of wood bored by ship-worms at various depths in the clay on\r\nwhich London is built. Entire branches and stems of trees, several feet in\r\nlength, are sometimes dug out, drilled all over by the holes of these\r\nborers, the tubes and shells of the mollusk still remaining in the\r\ncylindrical hollows. In fig. 15. _e_, a representation is given of a piece\r\nof recent wood pierced by the _Teredo navalis_, or common ship-worm, which\r\ndestroys wooden piles and ships. When the cylindrical tube _d_ has been\r\nextracted from the wood, a shell is seen at the larger extremity, composed\r\nof two pieces, as shown at _c_. In like manner, a piece of fossil wood\r\n(_a_, fig. 14.) has been perforated by an animal of a kindred but extinct\r\ngenus, called _Teredina_ by Lamarck. The calcareous tube of this mollusk\r\nwas united and as it were soldered on to the valves of the shell (_b_),\r\nwhich therefore cannot be detached from the tube, like the valves of the\r\nrecent _Teredo_. The wood in this fossil specimen is now converted into a\r\nstony mass, a mixture of clay and lime; but it must once have been buoyant\r\nand floating in the sea, when the _Teredinae_ lived upon it, perforating it\r\nin all directions. Again, before the infant colony settled upon the drift\r\nwood, the branch of a tree must have been floated down to the sea by a\r\nriver, uprooted, perhaps, by a flood, or torn off and cast into the waves\r\nby the wind: and thus our thoughts are carried back to a prior period, when\r\nthe tree grew for years on dry land, enjoying a fit soil and climate.\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Fossil and recent wood drilled by perforating Mollusca.\r\n\r\nFig. 14. _a_.

Such masses may be compared to modern oyster-beds and coral\r\nreefs; and, like them, the rate of increase must have been extremely\r\ngradual. But there are a variety of stony deposits in the earth's crust,\r\nnow proved to have been derived from plants and animals, of which the\r\norganic origin was not suspected until of late years, even by\r\nnaturalists. Great surprise was therefore created by the recent\r\ndiscovery of Professor Ehrenberg of Berlin, that a certain kind of\r\nsiliceous stone, called tripoli, was entirely composed of millions of\r\nthe remains of organic beings, which the Prussian naturalist refers to\r\nmicroscopic Infusoria, but which most others now believe to be plants.\r\nThey abound in freshwater lakes and ponds in England and other\r\ncountries, and are termed Diatomaceae by those naturalists who believe in\r\ntheir vegetable origin. The substance alluded to has long been well\r\nknown in the arts, being used in the form of powder for polishing stones\r\nand metals. It has been procured, among other places, from Bilin, in\r\nBohemia, where a single stratum, extending over a wide area, is no less\r\nthan 14 feet thick. This stone, when examined with a powerful\r\nmicroscope, is found to consist of the siliceous plates or frustules of\r\nthe above-mentioned Diatomaceae, united together without any visible\r\ncement. It is difficult to convey an idea of their extreme minuteness;\r\nbut Ehrenberg estimates that in the Bilin tripoli there are 41,000\r\nmillions of individuals of the _Gaillonella distans_ (see fig. 17.) in\r\nevery cubic inch, which weighs about 220 grains, or about 187 millions\r\nin a single grain. At every stroke, therefore, that we make with this\r\npolishing powder, several millions, perhaps tens of millions, of perfect\r\nfossils are crushed to atoms.\r\n\r\n[3 Illustrations: These figures are magnified nearly 300 times, except\r\nthe lower figure of _G. ferruginea_ (fig. 18. _a_), which is magnified\r\n2000 times.\r\n\r\nFig. 16. _Bacillaria vulgaris?_\r\n\r\nFig. 17. _Gaillonella distans._\r\n\r\nFig. 18. _Gaillonella ferruginea._]\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Fragment of semi-opal from the great bed of\r\nTripoli, Bilin.\r\n\r\nFig. 19. Natural size.\r\n\r\nFig. 20. The same magnified, showing circular articulations of a species of\r\n_Gaillonella_, and spiculae of _Spongilla_.]\r\n\r\nThe remains of these Diatomaceae are of pure silex, and their forms are\r\nvarious, but very marked and constant in particular genera and species.\r\nThus, in the family _Bacillaria_ (see fig. 16.), the fossils preserved in\r\ntripoli are seen to exhibit the same divisions and transverse lines which\r\ncharacterize the living species of kindred form. With these, also, the\r\nsiliceous spiculae or internal supports of the freshwater sponge, or\r\n_Spongilla_ of Lamarck, are sometimes intermingled (see the needle-shaped\r\nbodies in fig. 20.). These flinty cases and spiculae, although hard, are\r\nvery fragile, breaking like glass, and are therefore admirably adapted,\r\nwhen rubbed, for wearing down into a fine powder fit for polishing the\r\nsurface of metals.\r\n\r\nBesides the tripoli, formed exclusively of the fossils above described,\r\nthere occurs in the upper part of the great stratum at Bilin another\r\nheavier and more compact stone, a kind of semi-opal, in which innumerable\r\nparts of Diatomaceae and spiculae of the _Spongilla_ are filled with, and\r\ncemented together by, siliceous matter. It is supposed that the siliceous\r\nremains of the most delicate Diatomaceae have been dissolved by water, and\r\nhave thus given rise to this opal in which the more durable fossils are\r\npreserved like insects in amber. This opinion is confirmed by the fact that\r\nthe organic bodies decrease in number and sharpness of outline in\r\nproportion as the opaline cement increases in quantity.\r\n\r\nIn the Bohemian tripoli above described, as in that of Planitz in Saxony,\r\nthe species of Diatomaceae (or Infusoria, as termed by Ehrenberg) are\r\nfreshwater; but in other countries, as in the tripoli of the Isle of\r\nFrance, they are of marine species, and they all belong to formations of\r\nthe _tertiary_ period, which will be spoken of hereafter.\r\n\r\nA well-known substance, called bog-iron ore, often met with in peat-mosses,\r\nhas also been shown by Ehrenberg to consist of innumerable articulated\r\nthreads, of a yellow ochre colour, composed partly of flint and partly of\r\noxide of iron. These threads are the cases of a minute microscopic body,\r\ncalled _Gaillonella ferruginea_ (fig. 18.).\r\n\r\n[4 Illustrations: _Cytheridae_ and _Foraminifera_ from the chalk.\r\n\r\nFig. 21. _Cythere_, Muell.\r\n         _Cytherina_, Lam.\r\n\r\nFig. 22. Portion of _Nodosaria_.\r\n\r\nFig. 23. _Cristellaria rotulata._\r\n\r\nFig. 24. _Rosalina._]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that much time must have been required for the accumulation of\r\nstrata to which countless generations of Diatomaceae have contributed their\r\nremains; and these discoveries lead us naturally to suspect that other\r\ndeposits, of which the materials have usually been supposed to be\r\ninorganic, may in reality have been derived from microscopic organic\r\nbodies. That this is the case with the white chalk, has often been\r\nimagined, this rock having been observed to abound in a variety of marine\r\nfossils, such as shells, echini, corals, sponges, crustacea, and fishes.\r\nMr. Lonsdale, on examining, in Oct. 1835, in the museum of the Geological\r\nSociety of London, portions of white chalk from different parts of England,\r\nfound, on carefully pulverizing them in water, that what appear to the eye\r\nsimply as white grains were, in fact, well preserved fossils. He obtained\r\nabove a thousand of these from each pound weight of chalk, some being\r\nfragments of minute corallines, others entire Foraminifera and Cytheridae.\r\nThe annexed drawings will give an idea of the beautiful forms of many of\r\nthese bodies. The figures _a_ _a_ represent their natural size, but, minute\r\nas they seem, the smallest of them, such as _a_, fig. 24., are gigantic in\r\ncomparison with the cases of Diatomaceae before mentioned. It has, moreover,\r\nbeen lately discovered that the chambers into which these Foraminifera are\r\ndivided are actually often filled with thousands of well-preserved organic\r\nbodies, which abound in every minute grain of chalk, and are especially\r\napparent in the white coating of flints, often accompanied by innumerable\r\nneedle-shaped spiculae of sponges. After reflecting on these discoveries, we\r\nare naturally led on to conjecture that, as the formless cement in the\r\nsemi-opal of Bilin has been derived from the decomposition of animal and\r\nvegetable remains, so also even those parts of chalk flints in which no\r\norganic structure can be recognized may nevertheless have constituted a\r\npart of microscopic animalcules.\r\n\r\n  \"The dust we tread upon was once alive!\"--BYRON.\r\n\r\nHow faint an idea does this exclamation of the poet convey of the real\r\nwonders of nature! for here we discover proofs that the calcareous and\r\nsiliceous dust of which hills are composed has not only been once alive,\r\nbut almost every particle, albeit invisible to the naked eye, still retains\r\nthe organic structure which, at periods of time incalculably remote, was\r\nimpressed upon it by the powers of life.\r\n\r\n_Freshwater and marine fossils._--Strata, whether deposited in salt or\r\nfresh water, have the same forms; but the imbedded fossils are very\r\ndifferent in the two cases, because the aquatic animals which frequent\r\nlakes and rivers are distinct from those inhabiting the sea. In the\r\nnorthern part of the Isle of Wight a formation of marl and limestone, more\r\nthan 50 feet thick, occurs, in which the shells are principally, if not\r\nall, of extinct species. Yet we recognize their freshwater origin, because\r\nthey are of the same genera as those now abounding in ponds and lakes,\r\neither in our own country or in warmer latitudes.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of France, as in Auvergne, for example, strata of\r\nlimestone, marl, and sandstone are found, hundreds of feet thick, which\r\ncontain exclusively freshwater and land shells, together with the\r\nremains of terrestrial quadrupeds. The number of land shells scattered\r\nthrough some of these freshwater deposits is exceedingly great; and\r\nthere are districts in Germany where the rocks scarcely contain any\r\nother fossils except snail-shells (_helices_); as, for instance, the\r\nlimestone on the left bank of the Rhine, between Mayence and Worms, at\r\nOppenheim, Findheim, Budenheim, and other places. In order to account\r\nfor this phenomenon, the geologist has only to examine the small deltas\r\nof torrents which enter the Swiss lakes when the waters are low, such as\r\nthe newly-formed plain where the Kander enters the Lake of Thun. He\r\nthere sees sand and mud strewed over with innumerable dead land shells,\r\nwhich have been brought down from valleys in the Alps in the preceding\r\nspring, during the melting of the snows. Again, if we search the sands\r\non the borders of the Rhine, in the lower part of its course, we find\r\ncountless land shells mixed with others of species belonging to lakes,\r\nstagnant pools, and marshes. These individuals have been washed away\r\nfrom the alluvial plains of the great river and its tributaries, some\r\nfrom mountainous regions, others from the low country.\r\n\r\nAlthough freshwater formations are often of great thickness, yet they are\r\nusually very limited in area when compared to marine deposits, just as\r\nlakes and estuaries are of small dimensions in comparison with seas.\r\n\r\nWe may distinguish a freshwater formation, first, by the absence of many\r\nfossils almost invariably met with in marine strata. For example, there\r\nare no sea-urchins, no corals, and scarcely any zoophytes; no chambered\r\nshells, such as the nautilus, nor microscopic Foraminifera. But it is\r\nchiefly by attending to the forms of the mollusca that we are guided in\r\ndetermining the point in question. In a freshwater deposit, the number\r\nof individual shells is often as great, if not greater, than in a marine\r\nstratum; but there is a smaller variety of species and genera. This\r\nmight be anticipated from the fact that the genera and species of recent\r\nfreshwater and land shells are few when contrasted with the marine.\r\nThus, the genera of true mollusca according to Blainville's system,\r\nexcluding those of extinct species and those without shells, amount to\r\nabout 200 in number, of which the terrestrial and freshwater genera\r\nscarcely form more than a sixth.[28-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. _Cyclas obovata_; fossil. Hants.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. _Cyrena consobrina_; fossil. Grays, Essex.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. _Anodonta Cordierii_; fossil. Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. _Anodonta latimarginatus_; recent. Bahia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. _Unio littoralis_; recent. Auvergne.]\r\n\r\nAlmost all bivalve shells, or those of acephalous mollusca, are marine,\r\nabout ten only out of ninety genera being freshwater. Among these last, the\r\nfour most common forms, both recent and fossil, are _Cyclas_, _Cyrena_,\r\n_Unio_, and _Anodonta_ (see figures); the two first and two last of which\r\nare so nearly allied as to pass into each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. _Gryphaea incurva_, Sow. (_G. arcuata_, Lam.) upper\r\nvalve. Lias.]\r\n\r\nLamarck divided the bivalve mollusca into the _Dimyary_, or those having\r\ntwo large muscular impressions in each valve, as _a b_ in the Cyclas, fig.\r\n25., and the _Monomyary_, such as the oyster and scallop, in which there is\r\nonly one of these impressions, as is seen in fig. 30. Now, as none of these\r\nlast, or the unimuscular bivalves, are freshwater, we may at once presume a\r\ndeposit in which we find any of them to be marine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. _Planorbis euomphalus_; fossil. Isle of Wight.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. _Lymnea longiscata_; fossil. Hants.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. _Paludina lenta_; fossil. Hants.]\r\n\r\nThe univalve shells most characteristic of freshwater deposits are,\r\n_Planorbis_, _Lymnea_, and _Paludina_. (See figures.) But to these are\r\noccasionally added _Physa_, _Succinea_, _Ancylus_, _Valvata_, _Melanopsis_,\r\n_Melania_, and _Neritina_. (See figures.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. _Succinea amphibia_; fossil. Loess, Rhine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. _Ancylus elegans_; fossil. Hants.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. _Valvata_; fossil. Grays, Essex.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. _Physa hypnorum_; recent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. _Auricula_; recent.

Asia.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to one of these, the _Ancylus_ (fig. 35.), Mr. Gray observes that\r\nit sometimes differs in no respect from the marine _Siphonaria_, except in\r\nthe animal. The shell, however, of the _Ancylus_ is usually thinner.[29-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. _Neritina globulus._ Paris basin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. _Nerita granulosa._ Paris basin.]\r\n\r\nSome naturalists include _Neritina_ (fig. 42.) and the marine _Nerita_\r\n(fig. 43.) in the same genus, it being scarcely possible to distinguish the\r\ntwo by good generic characters. But, as a general rule, the fluviatile\r\nspecies are smaller, smoother, and more globular than the marine; and they\r\nhave never, like the _Neritae_, the inner margin of the outer lip toothed or\r\ncrenulated. (See fig. 43.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. _Cerithium cinctum._ Paris basin.]\r\n\r\nA few genera, among which _Cerithium_ (fig. 44.) is the most abundant, are\r\ncommon both to rivers and the sea, having species peculiar to each. Other\r\ngenera, like _Auricula_ (fig. 38.), are amphibious, frequenting marshes,\r\nespecially near the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. _Helix Turonensis._ Faluns, Touraine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. _Cyclostoma elegans._ Loess.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47. _Pupa tridens._ Loess.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48. _Clausilia bidens._ Loess.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. _Bulimus lubricus._ Loess, Rhine.]\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial shells are all univalves. The most abundant genera among\r\nthese, both in a recent and fossil state, are _Helix_ (fig. 45.),\r\n_Cyclostoma_ (fig. 46.), _Pupa_ (fig. 47.), _Clausilia_ (fig. 48.),\r\n_Bulimus_ (fig. 49.), and _Achatina_; which two last are nearly allied and\r\npass into each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. _Ampullaria glauca_, from the Jumna.]\r\n\r\nThe _Ampullaria_ (fig. 50.) is another genus of shells, inhabiting\r\nrivers and ponds in hot countries. Many fossil species have been\r\nreferred to this genus, but they have been found chiefly in marine\r\nformations, and are suspected by some conchologists to belong to\r\n_Natica_ and other marine genera.\r\n\r\nAll univalve shells of land and freshwater species, with the exception of\r\n_Melanopsis_ (fig. 41.), and _Achatina_, which has a slight indentation,\r\nhave entire mouths; and this circumstance may often serve as a convenient\r\nrule for distinguishing freshwater from marine strata; since, if any\r\nunivalves occur of which the mouths are not entire, we may presume that the\r\nformation is marine. The aperture is said to be entire in such shells as\r\nthe _Ampullaria_ and the land shells (figs. 45-49.), when its outline is\r\nnot interrupted by an indentation or notch, such as that seen at _b_ in\r\n_Ancillaria_ (fig. 52.); or is not prolonged into a canal, as that seen at\r\n_a_ in _Pleurotoma_ (fig. 51.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51. _Pleurotoma rotata._ Subap. hills, Italy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52. _Ancillaria subulata._ London clay.]\r\n\r\nThe mouths of a large proportion of the marine univalves have these notches\r\nor canals, and almost all such species are carnivorous; whereas nearly all\r\ntestacea having entire mouths, are plant-eaters; whether the species be\r\nmarine, freshwater, or terrestrial.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one genus which affords an occasional exception to one\r\nof the above rules. The _Cerithium_ (fig. 44.), although provided with a\r\nshort canal, comprises some species which inhabit salt, others brackish,\r\nand others fresh water, and they are said to be all plant-eaters.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossils very common in freshwater deposits are the shells of\r\n_Cypris_, a minute crustaceous animal, having a shell much resembling that\r\nof the bivalve mollusca.[31-A] Many minute living species of this genus\r\nswarm in lakes and stagnant pools in Great Britain; but their shells are\r\nnot, if considered separately, conclusive as to the freshwater origin of a\r\ndeposit, because the majority of species in another kindred genus of the\r\nsame order, the _Cytherina_ of Lamarck (see above, fig. 21. p. 26.),\r\ninhabit salt water; and, although the animal differs slightly, the shell is\r\nscarcely distinguishable from that of the _Cypris_.\r\n\r\nThe seed-vessels and stems of _Chara_, a genus of aquatic plants, are very\r\nfrequent in freshwater strata. These seed-vessels were called, before their\r\ntrue nature was known, gyrogonites, and were supposed to be foraminiferous\r\nshells. (See fig. 53. _a._)\r\n\r\nThe _Charae_ inhabit the bottom of lakes and ponds, and flourish mostly\r\nwhere the water is charged with carbonate of lime. Their seed-vessels are\r\ncovered with a very tough integument, capable of resisting decomposition;\r\nto which circumstance we may attribute their abundance in a fossil state.\r\nThe annexed figure (fig. 54.) represents a branch of one of many new\r\nspecies found by Professor Amici in the lakes of northern Italy. The\r\nseed-vessel in this plant is more globular than in the British _Charae_, and\r\ntherefore more nearly resembles in form the extinct fossil species found in\r\nEngland, France, and other countries. The stems, as well as the\r\nseed-vessels, of these plants occur both in modern shell marl and in\r\nancient freshwater formations. They are generally composed of a large tube\r\nsurrounded by smaller tubes; the whole stem being divided at certain\r\nintervals by transverse partitions or joints. (See _b_, fig. 53.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53. _Chara medicaginula_; fossil. Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Seed-vessel. magnified 20 diameters.\r\n  _b._ Stem, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54. _Chara elastica_; recent.

The manner in which such remains are occasionally\r\ncarried by rivers into lakes, especially during floods, has been fully\r\ntreated of in the \"Principles of Geology.\"[32-A]\r\n\r\nThe remains of fish are occasionally useful in determining the freshwater\r\norigin of strata. Certain genera, such as carp, perch, pike, and loach\r\n(_Cyprinus_, _Perca_, _Esox_, and _Cobitis_), as also _Lebias_, being\r\npeculiar to freshwater. Other genera contain some freshwater and some\r\nmarine species, as _Cottus_, _Mugil_, and _Anguilla_, or eel. The rest are\r\neither common to rivers and the sea, as the salmon; or are exclusively\r\ncharacteristic of salt water. The above observations respecting fossil\r\nfishes are applicable only to the more modern or tertiary deposits; for in\r\nthe more ancient rocks the forms depart so widely from those of existing\r\nfishes, that it is very difficult, at least in the present state of\r\nscience, to derive any positive information from ichthyolites respecting\r\nthe element in which strata were deposited.\r\n\r\nThe alternation of marine and freshwater formations, both on a small and\r\nlarge scale, are facts well ascertained in geology. When it occurs on a\r\nsmall scale, it may have arisen from the alternate occupation of certain\r\nspaces by river water and the sea; for in the flood season the river forces\r\nback the ocean and freshens it over a large area, depositing at the same\r\ntime its sediment; after which the salt water again returns, and, on\r\nresuming its former place, brings with it sand, mud, and marine shells.\r\n\r\nThere are also lagoons at the mouths of many rivers, as the Nile and\r\nMississippi, which are divided off by bars of sand from the sea, and\r\nwhich are filled with salt and fresh water by turns. They often\r\ncommunicate exclusively with the river for months, years, or even\r\ncenturies; and then a breach being made in the bar of sand, they are for\r\nlong periods filled with salt water.\r\n\r\nThe Lym-Fiord in Jutland offers an excellent illustration of analogous\r\nchanges; for, in the course of the last thousand years, the western\r\nextremity of this long frith, which is 120 miles in length, including\r\nits windings, has been four times fresh and four times salt, a bar of\r\nsand between it and the ocean having been as often formed and removed.\r\nThe last irruption of salt water happened in 1824, when the North Sea\r\nentered, killing all the freshwater shells, fish, and plants; and from\r\nthat time to the present, the sea-weed _Fucus vesiculosus_, together\r\nwith oysters and other marine mollusca, have succeeded the _Cyclas_,\r\n_Lymnea_, _Paludina_, and _Charae_.[33-A]\r\n\r\nBut changes like these in the Lym-Fiord, and those before mentioned as\r\noccurring at the mouths of great rivers, will only account for some cases\r\nof marine deposits of partial extent resting on freshwater strata. When we\r\nfind, as in the south-east of England, a great series of freshwater beds,\r\n1000 feet in thickness, resting upon marine formations and again covered by\r\nother rocks, such as the cretaceous, more than 1000 feet thick, and of\r\ndeep-sea origin, we shall find it necessary to seek for a different\r\nexplanation of the phenomena.[33-B]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28-A] See Synoptic Table in Blainville's Malacologie.\r\n\r\n[29-A] Gray, Phil.

By the latter name are designated beds of mud, sand, or pebbles\r\nproduced by the action of running water, also accumulations of stones and\r\nscoriae thrown out by a volcano, which have fallen into their present place\r\nby the force of gravitation. But the matter which forms a chemical deposit\r\nhas not been mechanically suspended in water, but in a state of solution\r\nuntil separated by chemical action. In this manner carbonate of lime is\r\noften precipitated upon the bottom of lakes and seas in a solid form, as\r\nmay be well seen in many parts of Italy, where mineral springs abound, and\r\nwhere the calcareous stone, called travertin, is deposited. In these\r\nsprings the lime is usually held in solution by an excess of carbonic acid,\r\nor by heat if it be a hot spring, until the water, on issuing from the\r\nearth, cools or loses part of its acid. The calcareous matter then falls\r\ndown in a solid state, encrusting shells, fragments of wood and leaves, and\r\nbinding them together.[34-A]\r\n\r\nIn coral reefs, large masses of limestone are formed by the stony skeletons\r\nof zoophytes; and these, together with shells, become cemented together by\r\ncarbonate of lime, part of which is probably furnished to the sea-water by\r\nthe decomposition of dead corals. Even shells of which the animals are\r\nstill living, on these reefs, are very commonly found to be encrusted over\r\nwith a hard coating of limestone.[34-B]\r\n\r\nIf sand and pebbles are carried by a river into the sea, and these are\r\nbound together immediately by carbonate of lime, the deposit may be\r\ndescribed as of a mixed origin, partly chemical, and partly mechanical.\r\n\r\nNow, the remarks already made in Chapter II. on the original horizontality\r\nof strata are strictly applicable to mechanical deposits, and only\r\npartially to those of a mixed nature. Such as are purely chemical may be\r\nformed on a very steep slope, or may even encrust the vertical walls of a\r\nfissure, and be of equal thickness throughout; but such deposits are of\r\nsmall extent, and for the most part confined to veinstones.\r\n\r\n_Cementing of particles._--It is chiefly in the case of calcareous rocks\r\nthat solidification takes place at the time of deposition. But there are\r\nmany deposits in which a cementing process comes into operation long\r\nafterwards. We may sometimes observe, where the water of ferruginous or\r\ncalcareous springs has flowed through a bed of sand or gravel, that iron\r\nor carbonate of lime has been deposited in the interstices between the\r\ngrains or pebbles, so that in certain places the whole has been bound\r\ntogether into a stone, the same set of strata remaining in other parts\r\nloose and incoherent.\r\n\r\nProofs of a similar cementing action are seen in a rock at Kelloway in\r\nWiltshire. A peculiar band of sandy strata, belonging to the group called\r\nOolite by geologists, may be traced through several counties, the sand\r\nbeing for the most part loose and unconsolidated, but becoming stony near\r\nKelloway. In this district there are numerous fossil shells which have\r\ndecomposed, having for the most part left only their casts. The calcareous\r\nmatter hence derived has evidently served, at some former period, as a\r\ncement to the siliceous grains of sand, and thus a solid sandstone has been\r\nproduced. If we take fragments of many other argillaceous grits, retaining\r\nthe casts of shells, and plunge them into dilute muriatic or other acid, we\r\nsee them immediately changed into common sand and mud; the cement of lime,\r\nderived from the shells, having been dissolved by the acid.\r\n\r\nTraces of impressions and casts are often extremely faint. In some loose\r\nsands of recent date we meet with shells in so advanced a stage of\r\ndecomposition as to crumble into powder when touched. It is clear that\r\nwater percolating such strata may soon remove the calcareous matter of the\r\nshell; and, unless circumstances cause the carbonate of lime to be again\r\ndeposited, the grains of sand will not be cemented together; in which case\r\nno memorial of the fossil will remain. The absence of organic remains from\r\nmany aqueous rocks may be thus explained; but we may presume that in many\r\nof them no fossils were ever imbedded, as there are extensive tracts on the\r\nbottoms of existing seas even of moderate depth on which no fragment of\r\nshell, coral, or other living creature can be detected by dredging. On the\r\nother hand, there are depths where the zero of animal life has been\r\napproached; as, for example, in the Mediterranean, at the depth of about\r\n230 fathoms, according to the researches of Prof. E. Forbes. In the AEgean\r\nSea a deposit of yellowish mud of a very uniform character, and closely\r\nresembling chalk, is going on in regions below 230 fathoms, and this\r\nformation must be wholly devoid of organic remains.[35-A]\r\n\r\nIn what manner silex and carbonate of lime may become widely diffused in\r\nsmall quantities through the waters which permeate the earth's crust will\r\nbe spoken of presently, when the petrifaction of fossil bodies is\r\nconsidered; but I may remark here that such waters are always passing in\r\nthe case of thermal springs from hotter to colder parts of the interior of\r\nthe earth; and as often as the temperature of the solvent is lowered,\r\nmineral matter has a tendency to separate from it and solidify. Thus a\r\nstony cement is often supplied to any sand, pebbles, or fragmentary\r\nmixture. In some conglomerates, like the pudding-stone of Hertfordshire,\r\npebbles of flint and grains of sand are united by a siliceous cement so\r\nfirmly, that if a block be fractured the rent passes as readily through the\r\npebbles as through the cement.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that many strata became solid at the time when they emerged\r\nfrom the waters in which they were deposited, and when they first formed a\r\npart of the dry land. A well-known fact seems to confirm this idea: by far\r\nthe greater number of the stones used for building and road-making are much\r\nsofter when first taken from the quarry than after they have been long\r\nexposed to the air; and these, when once dried, may afterwards be immersed\r\nfor any length of time in water without becoming soft again. Hence it is\r\nfound desirable to shape the stones which are to be used in architecture\r\nwhile they are yet soft and wet, and while they contain their\r\n\"quarry-water,\" as it is called; also to break up stone intended for roads\r\nwhen soft, and then leave it to dry in the air for months that it may\r\nharden. Such induration may perhaps be accounted for by supposing the\r\nwater, which penetrates the minutest pores of rocks, to deposit, on\r\nevaporation, carbonate of lime, iron, silex, and other minerals previously\r\nheld in solution, and thereby to fill up the pores partially. These\r\nparticles, on crystallizing, would not only be themselves deprived of\r\nfreedom of motion, but would also bind together other portions of the rock\r\nwhich before were loosely aggregated. On the same principle wet sand and\r\nmud become as hard as stone when frozen; because one ingredient of the\r\nmass, namely, the water, has crystallized, so as to hold firmly together\r\nall the separate particles of which the loose mud and sand were composed.\r\n\r\nDr. MacCulloch mentions a sandstone in Skye, which may be moulded like\r\ndough when first found; and some simple minerals, which are rigid and as\r\nhard as glass in our cabinets, are often flexible and soft in their native\r\nbeds; this is the case with asbestos, sahlite, tremolite, and chalcedony,\r\nand it is reported also to happen in the case of the beryl.[36-A]\r\n\r\nThe marl recently deposited at the bottom of Lake Superior, in North\r\nAmerica, is soft, and often filled with freshwater shells; but if a\r\npiece be taken up and dried, it becomes so hard that it can only be\r\nbroken by a smart blow of the hammer. If the lake therefore was drained,\r\nsuch a deposit would be found to consist of strata of marlstone, like\r\nthat observed in many ancient European formations, and like them\r\ncontaining freshwater shells.[36-B]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that some of the heterogeneous materials which rivers\r\ntransport to the sea may at once set under water, like the artificial\r\nmixture called pozzolana, which consists of fine volcanic sand charged\r\nwith about 20 per cent. of oxide of iron, and the addition of a small\r\nquantity of lime. This substance hardens, and becomes a solid stone in\r\nwater, and was used by the Romans in constructing the foundations of\r\nbuildings in the sea.\r\n\r\nConsolidation in these cases is brought about by the action of chemical\r\naffinity on finely comminuted matter previously suspended in water. After\r\ndeposition similar particles seem to exert a mutual attraction on each\r\nother, and congregate together in particular spots, forming lumps, nodules,\r\nand concretions. Thus in many argillaceous deposits there are calcareous\r\nballs, or spherical concretions, ranged in layers parallel to the general\r\nstratification; an arrangement which took place after the shale or marl had\r\nbeen thrown down in successive laminae; for these laminae are often traced\r\nin the concretions, remaining parallel to those of the surrounding\r\nunconsolidated rock. (See fig. 55.) Such nodules of limestone have often a\r\nshell or other foreign body in the centre.[37-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55. Calcareous nodules in Lias.]\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable examples of concretionary structure are those\r\ndescribed by Professor Sedgwick as abounding in the magnesian limestone\r\nof the north of England. The spherical balls are of various sizes, from\r\nthat of a pea to a diameter of several feet, and they have both a\r\nconcentric and radiated structure, while at the same time the laminae of\r\noriginal deposition pass uninterruptedly through them. In some cliffs\r\nthis limestone resembles a great irregular pile of cannon balls. Some of\r\nthe globular masses have their centre in one stratum, while a portion of\r\ntheir exterior passes through to the stratum above or below. Thus the\r\nlarger spheroid in the annexed section (fig. 56.) passes from the\r\nstratum _b_ upwards into _a_. In this instance we must suppose the\r\ndeposition of a series of minor layers, first forming the stratum _b_,\r\nand afterwards the incumbent stratum _a_; then a movement of the\r\nparticles took place, and the carbonates of lime and magnesia separated\r\nfrom the more impure and mixed matter forming the still unconsolidated\r\nparts of the stratum. Crystallization, beginning at the centre, must\r\nhave gone on forming concentric coats, around the original nucleus\r\nwithout interfering with the laminated structure of the rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56. Spheroidal concretions in magnesian limestone.]\r\n\r\nWhen the particles of rocks have been thus re-arranged by chemical forces,\r\nit is sometimes difficult or impossible to ascertain whether certain lines\r\nof division are due to original deposition or to the subsequent aggregation\r\nof similar particles. Thus suppose three strata of grit, A, B, C, are\r\ncharged unequally with calcareous matter, and that B is the most\r\ncalcareous. If consolidation takes place in B, the concretionary action may\r\nspread upwards into a part of A, where the carbonate of lime is more\r\nabundant than in the rest; so that a mass, _d_, _e_, _f_, forming a portion\r\nof the superior stratum, becomes united with B into one solid mass of\r\nstone. The original line of division _d_, _e_, being thus effaced, the line\r\n_d_, _f_, would generally be considered as the surface of the bed B, though\r\nnot strictly a true plane of stratification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. Block section.]\r\n\r\n_Pressure and heat._--When sand and mud sink to the bottom of a deep\r\nsea, the particles are not pressed down by the enormous weight of the\r\nincumbent ocean; for the water, which becomes mingled with the sand and\r\nmud, resists pressure with a force equal to that of the column of fluid\r\nabove. The same happens in regard to organic remains which are filled\r\nwith water under great pressure as they sink, otherwise they would be\r\nimmediately crushed to pieces and flattened. Nevertheless, if the\r\nmaterials of a stratum remain in a yielding state, and do not set or\r\nsolidify, they will be gradually squeezed down by the weight of other\r\nmaterials successively heaped upon them, just as soft clay or loose sand\r\non which a house is built may give way. By such downward pressure\r\nparticles of clay, sand, and marl, may become packed into a smaller\r\nspace, and be made to cohere together permanently.\r\n\r\nAnalogous effects of condensation may arise when the solid parts of the\r\nearth's crust are forced in various directions by those mechanical\r\nmovements afterwards to be described, by which strata have been bent,\r\nbroken, and raised above the level of the sea. Rocks of more yielding\r\nmaterials must often have been forced against others previously\r\nconsolidated, and, thus compressed, may have acquired a new structure. A\r\nrecent discovery may help us to comprehend how fine sediment derived\r\nfrom the detritus of rocks may be solidified by mere pressure. The\r\ngraphite or \"black lead\" of commerce having become very scarce, Mr.\r\nBrockedon contrived a method by which the dust of the purer portions of\r\nthe mineral found in Borrowdale might be recomposed into a mass as dense\r\nand compact as native graphite. The powder of graphite is first\r\ncarefully prepared and freed from air, and placed under a powerful press\r\non a strong steel die, with air-tight fittings. It is then struck\r\nseveral blows, each of a power of 1000 tons; after which operation the\r\npowder is so perfectly solidified that it can be cut for pencils, and\r\nexhibits when broken the same texture as native graphite.\r\n\r\nBut the action of heat at various depths in the earth is probably the most\r\npowerful of all causes in hardening sedimentary strata. To this subject I\r\nshall refer again when treating of the metamorphic rocks, and of the slaty\r\nand jointed structure.\r\n\r\n_Mineralization of organic remains._--The changes which fossil organic\r\nbodies have undergone since they were first imbedded in rocks, throw\r\nmuch light on the consolidation of strata. Fossil shells in some modern\r\ndeposits have been scarcely altered in the course of centuries, having\r\nsimply lost a part of their animal matter. But in other cases the shell\r\nhas disappeared, and left an impression only of its exterior, or a cast\r\nof its interior form, or thirdly, a cast of the shell itself, the\r\noriginal matter of which has been removed. These different forms of\r\nfossilization may easily be understood if we examine the mud recently\r\nthrown out from a pond or canal in which there are shells. If the mud be\r\nargillaceous, it acquires consistency on drying, and on breaking open a\r\nportion of it we find that each shell has left impressions of its\r\nexternal form. If we then remove the shell itself, we find within a\r\nsolid nucleus of clay, having the form of the interior of the shell.\r\nThis form is often very different from that of the outer shell. Thus a\r\ncast such as _a_, fig. 58., commonly called a fossil screw, would never\r\nbe suspected by an inexperienced conchologist to be the internal shape\r\nof the fossil univalve, _b_, fig. 58. Nor should we have imagined at\r\nfirst sight that the shell _a_ and the cast _b_, fig. 59., were\r\ndifferent parts of the same fossil. The reader will observe, in the\r\nlast-mentioned figure (_b_, fig. 59.), that an empty space shaded dark,\r\nwhich the _shell itself_ once occupied, now intervenes between the\r\nenveloping stone and the cast of the smooth interior of the whorls. In\r\nsuch cases the shell has been dissolved and the component particles\r\nremoved by water percolating the rock. If the nucleus were taken out a\r\nhollow mould would remain, on which the external form of the shell with\r\nits tubercles and striae, as seen in _a_, fig. 59., would be seen\r\nembossed. Now if the space alluded to between the nucleus and the\r\nimpression, instead of being left empty, has been filled up with\r\ncalcareous spar, flint, pyrites, or other mineral, we then obtain from\r\nthe mould an exact cast both of the external and internal form of the\r\noriginal shell. In this manner silicified casts of shells have been\r\nformed; and if the mud or sand of the nucleus happen to be incoherent,\r\nor soluble in acid, we can then procure in flint an empty shell, which\r\nin shape is the exact counterpart of the original. This cast may be\r\ncompared to a bronze statue, representing merely the superficial form,\r\nand not the internal organization; but there is another description of\r\npetrifaction by no means uncommon, and of a much more wonderful kind,\r\nwhich may be compared to certain anatomical models in wax, where not\r\nonly the outward forms and features, but the nerves, blood-vessels, and\r\nother internal organs are also shown. Thus we find corals, originally\r\ncalcareous, in which not only the general shape, but also the minute and\r\ncomplicated internal organization are retained in flint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. _Phasianella Heddingtonensis_, and cast of the\r\nsame. Coral Rag.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. _Trochus Anglicus_ and cast. Lias.]\r\n\r\nSuch a process of petrifaction is still more remarkably exhibited in fossil\r\nwood, in which we often perceive not only the rings of annual growth, but\r\nall the minute vessels and medullary rays. Many of the minute pores and\r\nfibres of plants, and even those spiral vessels which in the living\r\nvegetable can only be discovered by the microscope, are preserved. Among\r\nmany instances, I may mention a fossil tree, 72 feet in length, found at\r\nGosforth near Newcastle, in sandstone strata associated with coal. By\r\ncutting a transverse slice so thin as to transmit light, and magnifying it\r\nabout fifty-five times, the texture seen in fig. 60. is exhibited. A\r\ntexture equally minute and complicated has been observed in the wood of\r\nlarge trunks of fossil trees found in the Craigleith quarry near Edinburgh,\r\nwhere the stone was not in the slightest degree siliceous, but consisted\r\nchiefly of carbonate of lime, with oxide of iron, alumina, and carbon. The\r\nparallel rows of vessels here seen are the rings of annual growth, but in\r\none part they are imperfectly preserved, the wood having probably decayed\r\nbefore the mineralizing matter had penetrated to that portion of the tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. Texture of a tree from the coal strata, magnified.\r\n(Witham.) Transverse section.]\r\n\r\nIn attempting to explain the process of petrifaction in such cases, we\r\nmay first assume that strata are very generally permeated by water\r\ncharged with minute portions of calcareous, siliceous, and other earths\r\nin solution. In what manner they become so impregnated will be\r\nafterwards considered. If an organic substance is exposed in the open\r\nair to the action of the sun and rain, it will in time putrefy, or be\r\ndissolved into its component elements, which consist chiefly of oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, and carbon. These will readily be absorbed by the atmosphere\r\nor be washed away by rain, so that all vestiges of the dead animal or\r\nplant disappear. But if the same substances be submerged in water, they\r\ndecompose more gradually; and if buried in earth, still more slowly, as\r\nin the familiar example of wooden piles or other buried timber. Now, if\r\nas fast as each particle is set free by putrefaction in a fluid or\r\ngaseous state, a particle equally minute of carbonate of lime, flint, or\r\nother mineral, is at hand and ready to be precipitated, we may imagine\r\nthis inorganic matter to take the place just before left unoccupied by\r\nthe organic molecule. In this manner a cast of the interior of certain\r\nvessels may first be taken, and afterwards the more solid walls of the\r\nsame may decay and suffer a like transmutation. Yet when the whole is\r\nlapidified, it may not form one homogeneous mass of stone or metal. Some\r\nof the original ligneous, osseous, or other organic elements may remain\r\nmingled in certain parts, or the lapidifying substance itself may be\r\ndifferently coloured at different times, or so crystallized as to\r\nreflect light differently, and thus the texture of the original body may\r\nbe faithfully exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe student may perhaps ask whether, on chemical principles, we have any\r\nground to expect that mineral matter will be thrown down precisely in\r\nthose spots where organic decomposition is in progress? The following\r\ncurious experiments may serve to illustrate this point. Professor\r\nGoeppert of Breslau attempted recently to imitate the natural process of\r\npetrifaction. For this purpose he steeped a variety of animal and\r\nvegetable substances in waters, some holding siliceous, others\r\ncalcareous, others metallic matter in solution. He found that in the\r\nperiod of a few weeks, or even days, the organic bodies thus immersed\r\nwere mineralized to a certain extent. Thus, for example, thin vertical\r\nslices of deal, taken from the Scotch fir (_Pinus sylvestris_), were\r\nimmersed in a moderately strong solution of sulphate of iron. When they\r\nhad been thoroughly soaked in the liquid for several days they were\r\ndried and exposed to a red-heat until the vegetable matter was burnt up\r\nand nothing remained but an oxide of iron, which was found to have\r\ntaken the form of the deal so exactly that casts even of the dotted\r\nvessels peculiar to this family of plants were distinctly visible\r\nunder the microscope.\r\n\r\nAnother accidental experiment has been recorded by Mr. Pepys in the\r\nGeological Transactions.[41-A] An earthen pitcher containing several quarts\r\nof sulphate of iron had remained undisturbed and unnoticed for about a\r\ntwelvemonth in the laboratory. At the end of this time when the liquor was\r\nexamined an oily appearance was observed on the surface, and a yellowish\r\npowder, which proved to be sulphur, together with a quantity of small\r\nhairs. At the bottom were discovered the bones of several mice in a\r\nsediment consisting of small grains of pyrites, others of sulphur, others\r\nof crystallized green sulphate of iron, and a black muddy oxide of iron. It\r\nwas evident that some mice had accidentally been drowned in the fluid, and\r\nby the mutual action of the animal matter and the sulphate of iron on each\r\nother, the metallic sulphate had been deprived of its oxygen; hence the\r\npyrites and the other compounds were thrown down. Although the mice were\r\nnot mineralized, or turned into pyrites, the phenomenon shows how mineral\r\nwaters, charged with sulphate of iron, may be deoxydated on coming in\r\ncontact with animal matter undergoing putrefaction, so that atom after atom\r\nof pyrites may be precipitated, and ready, under favourable circumstances,\r\nto replace the oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon into which the original body\r\nwould be resolved.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Turner observes, that when mineral matter is in a \"nascent\r\nstate,\" that is to say, just liberated from a previous state of chemical\r\ncombination, it is most ready to unite with other matter, and form a new\r\nchemical compound. Probably the particles or atoms just set free are of\r\nextreme minuteness, and therefore move more freely, and are more ready\r\nto obey any impulse of chemical affinity. Whatever be the cause, it\r\nclearly follows, as before stated, that where organic matter newly\r\nimbedded in sediment is decomposing, there will chemical changes take\r\nplace most actively.\r\n\r\nAn analysis was lately made of the water which was flowing off from the\r\nrich mud deposited by the Hooghly river in the Delta of the Ganges after\r\nthe annual inundation. This water was found to be highly charged with\r\ncarbonic acid gas holding lime in solution.[41-B] Now if newly-deposited\r\nmud is thus proved to be permeated by mineral matter in a state of\r\nsolution, it is not difficult to perceive that decomposing organic\r\nbodies, naturally imbedded in sediment, may as readily become petrified\r\nas the substances artificially immersed by Professor Goeppert in various\r\nfluid mixtures.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the water of springs, or that which is continually\r\npercolating the earth's crust, is rarely free from a slight admixture\r\neither of iron, carbonate of lime, sulphur, silica, potash, or some other\r\nearthy, alkaline, or metallic ingredient. Hot springs in particular are\r\ncopiously charged with one or more of these elements; and it is only in\r\ntheir waters that silex is found in abundance. In certain cases, therefore,\r\nespecially in volcanic regions, we may imagine the flint of silicified wood\r\nand corals to have been supplied by the waters of thermal springs. In other\r\ninstances, as in tripoli and chalk-flint, it may have been derived in great\r\npart, if not wholly, from the decomposition of infusoria or diatomaceae,\r\nsponges, and other bodies. But even if this be granted, we have still to\r\ninquire whence a lake or the ocean can be constantly replenished with the\r\ncalcareous and siliceous matter so abundantly withdrawn from it by the\r\nsecretions of these zoophytes.\r\n\r\nIn regard to carbonate of lime there is no difficulty, because not only are\r\ncalcareous springs very numerous, but even rain-water has the power of\r\ndissolving a minute portion of the calcareous rocks over which it flows.\r\nHence marine corals and mollusca may be provided by rivers with the\r\nmaterials of their shells and solid supports. But pure silex, even when\r\nreduced to the finest powder and boiled, is insoluble in water, except at\r\nvery high temperatures. Nevertheless Dr. Turner has well explained, in an\r\nessay on the chemistry of geology[42-A], how the decomposition of felspar\r\nmay be a source of silex in solution. He has remarked that the siliceous\r\nearth, which constitutes more than half the bulk of felspar, is intimately\r\ncombined with alumine, potash, and some other elements. The alkaline matter\r\nof the felspar has a chemical affinity for water, as also for the carbonic\r\nacid which is more or less contained in the waters of most springs. The\r\nwater therefore carries away alkaline matter, and leaves behind a clay\r\nconsisting of alumine and silica. But this residue of the decomposed\r\nmineral, which in its purest state is called porcelain clay, is found to\r\ncontain a part only of the silica which existed in the original felspar.\r\nThe other part, therefore, must have been dissolved and removed; and this\r\ncan be accounted for in two ways; first, because silica when combined with\r\nan alkali is soluble in water; secondly, because silica in what is\r\ntechnically called its nascent state is also soluble in water. Hence an\r\nendless supply of silica is afforded to rivers and the waters of the sea.\r\nFor the felspathic rocks are universally distributed, constituting, as they\r\ndo, so large a proportion of the volcanic, plutonic, and metamorphic\r\nformations. Even where they chance to be absent in mass, they rarely fail\r\nto occur in the superficial gravel or alluvial deposits of the basin of\r\nevery large river.\r\n\r\nThe disintegration of mica also, another mineral which enters largely\r\ninto the composition of granite and various sandstones, may yield\r\nsilica which may be dissolved in water, for nearly half of this mineral\r\nconsists of silica, combined with alumine, potash, and about a tenth\r\npart of iron. The oxidation of this iron in the air is the principal\r\ncause of the waste of mica.\r\n\r\nWe have still, however, much to learn before the conversion of fossil\r\nbodies into stone is fully understood. Some phenomena seem to imply that\r\nthe mineralization must proceed with considerable rapidity, for stems of a\r\nsoft and succulent character, and of a most perishable nature, are\r\npreserved in flint; and there are instances of the complete silicification\r\nof the young leaves of a palm-tree when just about to shoot forth, and in\r\nthat state which in the West Indies is called the cabbage of the\r\npalm.[43-A] It may, however, be questioned whether in such cases there may\r\nnot have been some antiseptic quality in the water which retarded\r\nputrefaction, so that the soft parts of the buried substance may have\r\nremained for a long time without disintegration, like the flesh of bodies\r\nimbedded in peat.\r\n\r\nMr. Stokes has pointed out examples of petrifactions in which the more\r\nperishable, and others where the more durable portions of wood are\r\npreserved. These variations, he suggests, must doubtless have depended on\r\nthe time when the lapidifying mineral was introduced. Thus, in certain\r\nsilicified stems of palm-trees, the cellular tissue, that most destructible\r\npart, is in good condition, while all signs of the hard woody fibre have\r\ndisappeared, the spaces once occupied by it being hollow or filled with\r\nagate. Here, petrifaction must have commenced soon after the wood was\r\nexposed to the action of moisture, and the supply of mineral matter must\r\nthen have failed, or the water must have become too much diluted before the\r\nwoody fibre decayed. But when this fibre is alone discoverable, we must\r\nsuppose that an interval of time elapsed before the commencement of\r\nlapidification, during which the cellular tissue was obliterated. When both\r\nstructures, namely, the cellular and the woody fibre, are preserved, the\r\nprocess must have commenced at an early period, and continued without\r\ninterruption till it was completed throughout.[43-B]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34-A] See Principles, Index, \"Calcareous Springs,\" &c.\r\n\r\n[34-B] Ibid. \"Travertin,\" \"Coral Reefs,\" &c.\r\n\r\n[35-A] Report Brit.

Hence it follows, that what is now dry land was\r\nonce under water. But if we admit this conclusion, we must imagine, either\r\nthat there has been a general lowering of the waters of the ocean, or that\r\nthe solid rocks, once covered by water, have been raised up bodily out of\r\nthe sea, and have thus become dry land. The earlier geologists, finding\r\nthemselves reduced to this alternative, embraced the former opinion,\r\nassuming that the ocean was originally universal, and had gradually sunk\r\ndown to its actual level, so that the present islands and continents were\r\nleft dry. It seemed to them far easier to conceive that the water had gone\r\ndown, than that solid land had risen upwards into its present position. It\r\nwas, however, impossible to invent any satisfactory hypothesis to explain\r\nthe disappearance of so enormous a body of water throughout the globe, it\r\nbeing necessary to infer that the ocean had once stood at whatever height\r\nmarine shells might be detected. It moreover appeared clear, as the science\r\nof Geology advanced, that certain spaces on the globe had been alternately\r\nsea, then land, then estuary, then sea again, and, lastly, once more\r\nhabitable land, having remained in each of these states for considerable\r\nperiods. In order to account for such phenomena, without admitting any\r\nmovement of the land itself, we are required to imagine several retreats\r\nand returns of the ocean; and even then our theory applies merely to cases\r\nwhere the marine strata composing the dry land are horizontal, leaving\r\nunexplained those more common instances where strata are inclined, curved,\r\nor placed on their edges, and evidently not in the position in which they\r\nwere first deposited.\r\n\r\nGeologists, therefore, were at last compelled to have recourse to the other\r\nalternative, namely, the doctrine that the solid land has been repeatedly\r\nmoved upwards or downwards, so as permanently to change its position\r\nrelatively to the sea. There are several distinct grounds for preferring\r\nthis conclusion. First, it will account equally for the position of those\r\nelevated masses of marine origin in which the stratification remains\r\nhorizontal, and for those in which the strata are disturbed, broken,\r\ninclined, or vertical. Secondly, it is consistent with human experience\r\nthat land should rise gradually in some places and be depressed in others.\r\nSuch changes have actually occurred in our own days, and are now in\r\nprogress, having been accompanied in some cases by violent convulsions,\r\nwhile in others they have proceeded so insensibly, as to have been\r\nascertainable only by the most careful scientific observations, made at\r\nconsiderable intervals of time. On the other hand, there is no evidence\r\nfrom human experience of a lowering of the sea's level in any region, and\r\nthe ocean cannot sink in one place without its level being depressed all\r\nover the globe.\r\n\r\nThese preliminary remarks will prepare the reader to understand the great\r\ntheoretical interest attached to all facts connected with the position of\r\nstrata, whether horizontal or inclined, curved or vertical.\r\n\r\nNow the first and most simple appearance is where strata of marine origin\r\noccur above the level of the sea in horizontal position. Such are the\r\nstrata which we meet with in the south of Sicily, filled with shells for\r\nthe most part of the same species as those now living in the Mediterranean.\r\nSome of these rocks rise to the height of more than 2000 feet above the\r\nsea. Other mountain masses might be mentioned, composed of horizontal\r\nstrata of high antiquity, which contain fossil remains of animals wholly\r\ndissimilar from any now known to exist. In the south of Sweden, for\r\nexample, near Lake Wener, the beds of one of the oldest of the\r\nfossiliferous deposits, namely that formerly called Transition, and now\r\nSilurian, by geologists, occur in as level a position as if they had\r\nrecently formed part of the delta of a great river, and been left dry on\r\nthe retiring of the annual floods. Aqueous rocks of about the same age\r\nextend for hundreds of miles over the lake-district of North America, and\r\nexhibit in like manner a stratification nearly undisturbed. The Table\r\nMountain at the Cape of Good Hope is another example of highly elevated yet\r\nperfectly horizontal strata, no less than 3500 feet in thickness, and\r\nconsisting of sandstone of very ancient date.\r\n\r\nInstead of imagining that such fossiliferous rocks were always at their\r\npresent level, and that the sea was once high enough to cover them, we\r\nsuppose them to have constituted the ancient bed of the ocean, and that\r\nthey were gradually uplifted to their present height. This idea, however\r\nstartling it may at first appear, is quite in accordance, as before stated,\r\nwith the analogy of changes now going on in certain regions of the globe.\r\nThus, in parts of Sweden, and the shores and islands of the Gulf of\r\nBothnia, proofs have been obtained that the land is experiencing, and has\r\nexperienced for centuries, a slow upheaving movement. Playfair argued in\r\nfavour of this opinion in 1802; and in 1807, Von Buch, after his travels in\r\nScandinavia, announced his conviction that a rising of the land was in\r\nprogress. Celsius and other Swedish writers had, a century before, declared\r\ntheir belief that a gradual change had, for ages, been taking place in the\r\nrelative level of land and sea. They attributed the change to a fall of the\r\nwaters both of the ocean and the Baltic. This theory, however, has now been\r\nrefuted by abundant evidence; for the alteration of relative level has\r\nneither been universal nor every where uniform in quantity, but has\r\namounted, in some regions, to several feet in a century, in others to a few\r\ninches; while in the southernmost part of Sweden, or the province of\r\nScania, there has been actually a loss instead of a gain of land, buildings\r\nhaving gradually sunk below the level of the sea.[46-A]\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the observations of Mr. Darwin and others, that very\r\nextensive regions of the continent of South America have been undergoing\r\nslow and gradual upheaval, by which the level plains of Patagonia, covered\r\nwith recent marine shells, and the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, have been raised\r\nabove the level of the sea.[46-B] On the other hand, the gradual sinking of\r\nthe west coast of Greenland, for the space of more than 600 miles from\r\nnorth to south, during the last four centuries, has been established by the\r\nobservations of a Danish naturalist, Dr. Pingel. And while these proofs of\r\ncontinental elevation and subsidence, by slow and insensible movements,\r\nhave been recently brought to light, the evidence has been daily\r\nstrengthened of continued changes of level effected by violent convulsions\r\nin countries where earthquakes are frequent. There the rocks are rent from\r\ntime to time, and heaved up or thrown down several feet at once, and\r\ndisturbed in such a manner, that the original position of strata may, in\r\nthe course of centuries, be modified to any amount.\r\n\r\nIt has also been shown by Mr. Darwin, that, in those seas where circular\r\ncoral islands and barrier reefs abound, there is a slow and continued\r\nsinking of the submarine mountains on which the masses of coral are based;\r\nwhile there are other areas of the South Sea, where the land is on the\r\nrise, and where coral has been upheaved far above the sea-level.\r\n\r\nIt would require a volume to explain to the reader the various facts which\r\nestablish the reality of these movements of land, whether of elevation or\r\ndepression, whether accompanied by earthquakes or accomplished slowly and\r\nwithout local disturbance. Having treated fully of these subjects in the\r\nPrinciples of Geology[46-C], I shall assume, in the present work, that such\r\nchanges are part of the actual course of nature; and when admitted, they\r\nwill be found to afford a key to the interpretation of a variety of\r\ngeological appearances, such as the elevation of horizontal, inclined, or\r\ndisturbed marine strata, and the superposition of freshwater to marine\r\ndeposits, afterwards to be described. It will also appear, in the sequel,\r\nhow much light the doctrine of a continued subsidence of land may throw on\r\nthe manner in which a series of strata, formed in shallow water, may have\r\naccumulated to a great thickness. The excavation of valleys also, and other\r\neffects of _denudation_, of which I shall presently treat, can alone be\r\nunderstood when we duly appreciate the proofs, now on record, of the\r\nprolonged rising and sinking of land, throughout wide areas.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this subject, I may remind the reader, that were we to embrace\r\nthe doctrine which ascribes the elevated position of marine formations, and\r\nthe depression of certain freshwater strata, to oscillations in the level\r\nof the waters instead of the land, we should be compelled to admit that the\r\nocean has been sometimes every where much shallower than at present, and at\r\nothers more than three miles deeper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61. Vertical conglomerate and sandstone.]\r\n\r\n_Inclined stratification._--The most unequivocal evidence of a change in\r\nthe original position of strata is afforded by their standing up\r\nperpendicularly on their edges, which is by no means a rare phenomenon,\r\nespecially in mountainous countries. Thus we find in Scotland, on the\r\nsouthern skirts of the Grampians, beds of pudding-stone alternating with\r\nthin layers of fine sand, all placed vertically to the horizon. When\r\nSaussure first observed certain conglomerates in a similar position in the\r\nSwiss Alps, he remarked that the pebbles, being for the most part of an\r\noval shape, had their longer axes parallel to the planes of stratification\r\n(See fig. 61.). From this he inferred, that such strata must, at first,\r\nhave been horizontal, each oval pebble having originally settled at the\r\nbottom of the water, with its flatter side parallel to the horizon, for the\r\nsame reason that an egg will not stand on either end if unsupported. Some\r\nfew, indeed, of the rounded stones in a conglomerate occasionally afford an\r\nexception to the above rule, for the same reason that we see on a shingle\r\nbeach some oval or flat-sided pebbles resting on their ends or edges; these\r\nhaving been forced along the bottom and against each other by a wave or\r\ncurrent so as to settle in this position.\r\n\r\nVertical strata, when they can be traced continuously upwards or downwards\r\nfor some depth, are almost invariably seen to be parts of great curves,\r\nwhich may have a diameter of a few yards, or of several miles. I shall\r\nfirst describe two curves of considerable regularity, which occur in\r\nForfarshire, extending over a country twenty miles in breadth, from the\r\nfoot of the Grampians to the sea near Arbroath.\r\n\r\nThe mass of strata here shown may be nearly 2000 feet in thickness,\r\nconsisting of red and white sandstone, and various coloured shales, the\r\nbeds being distinguishable into four principal groups, namely, No. 1. red\r\nmarl or shale; No. 2. red sandstone, used for building; No. 3.\r\nconglomerate; and No. 4. grey paving-stone, and tile-stone, with green and\r\nreddish shale, containing peculiar organic remains. A glance at the section\r\nwill show that each of the formations 2, 3, 4, are repeated thrice at the\r\nsurface, twice with a southerly, and once with a northerly inclination or\r\n_dip_, and the beds in No. 1., which are nearly horizontal, are still\r\nbrought up twice by a slight curvature to the surface, once on each side of\r\nA. Beginning at the north-west extremity, the tile-stones and conglomerates\r\nNo. 4. and No. 3. are vertical, and they generally form a ridge parallel to\r\nthe southern skirts of the Grampians. The superior strata Nos. 2. and 1.\r\nbecome less and less inclined on descending to the valley of Strathmore,\r\nwhere the strata, having a concave bend, are said by geologists to lie in a\r\n\"trough\" or \"basin.\" Through the centre of this valley runs an imaginary\r\nline A, called technically a \"synclinal line,\" where the beds, which are\r\ntilted in opposite directions, may be supposed to meet. It is most\r\nimportant for the observer to mark such lines, for he will perceive by the\r\ndiagram, that in travelling from the north to the centre of the basin, he\r\nis always passing from older to newer beds; whereas, after crossing the\r\nline A, and pursuing his course in the same southerly direction, he is\r\ncontinually leaving the newer, and advancing upon older strata. All the\r\ndeposits which he had before examined begin then to recur in reversed\r\norder, until he arrives at the central axis of the Sidlaw hills, where the\r\nstrata are seen to form an arch or _saddle_, having an _anticlinal_ line B,\r\nin the centre. On passing this line, and continuing towards the S.E., the\r\nformations 4, 3, and 2, are again repeated, in the same relative order of\r\nsuperposition, but with a northerly dip. At Whiteness (see diagram) it will\r\nbe seen that the inclined strata are covered by a newer deposit, _a_, in\r\nhorizontal beds. These are composed of red conglomerate and sand, and are\r\nnewer than any of the groups, 1, 2, 3, 4, before described, and rest\r\n_unconformably_ upon strata of the sandstone group, No. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. Section of Forfarshire, from N.W. to S.E., from\r\nfoot of the Grampians to the sea at Arbroath (volcanic or trap rocks\r\nomitted). Length of section twenty miles.]\r\n\r\nAn example of curved strata, in which the bends or convolutions of the rock\r\nare sharper and far more numerous within an equal space, has been well\r\ndescribed by Sir James Hall.[48-A] It occurs near St. Abb's Head, on the\r\neast coast of Scotland, where the rocks consist principally of a bluish\r\nslate, having frequently a ripple-marked surface. The undulations of the\r\nbeds reach from the top to the bottom of cliffs from 200 to 300 feet in\r\nheight, and there are sixteen distinct bendings in the course of about six\r\nmiles, the curvatures being alternately concave and convex upwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63. Curved strata of slate near St. Abb's Head,\r\nBerwickshire. (Sir J. Hall.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64. Block section.]\r\n\r\nAn experiment was made by Sir James Hall, with a view of illustrating the\r\nmanner in which such strata, assuming them to have been originally\r\nhorizontal, may have been forced into their present position. A set of\r\nlayers of clay were placed under a weight, and their opposite ends pressed\r\ntowards each other with such force as to cause them to approach more nearly\r\ntogether. On the removal of the weight, the layers of clay were found to be\r\ncurved and folded, so as to bear a miniature resemblance to the strata in\r\nthe cliffs. We must, however, bear in mind, that in the natural section or\r\nsea-cliff we only see the foldings imperfectly, one part being invisible\r\nbeneath the sea, and the other, or upper portion, being supposed to have\r\nbeen carried away by _denudation_, or that action of water which will be\r\nexplained in the next chapter. The dark lines in the accompanying plan\r\n(fig. 64.) represent what is actually seen of the strata in part of the\r\nline of cliff alluded to; the fainter lines, that portion which is\r\nconcealed beneath the sea level, as also that which is supposed to have\r\nonce existed above the present surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65. Experimental set-up.]\r\n\r\nWe may still more easily illustrate the effects which a lateral thrust\r\nmight produce on flexible strata, by placing several pieces of differently\r\ncoloured cloths upon a table, and when they are spread out horizontally,\r\ncover them with a book. Then apply other books to each end, and force them\r\ntowards each other. The folding of the cloths will exactly imitate those of\r\nthe bent strata. (See fig. 65.)\r\n\r\nWhether the analogous flexures in stratified rocks have really been due\r\nto similar sideway movements is a question of considerable difficulty.\r\nIt will appear when the volcanic and granitic rocks are described, that\r\nsome of them have, when melted, been injected forcibly into fissures,\r\nwhile others, already in a solid state, have been protruded upwards\r\nthrough the incumbent crust of the earth, by which a great displacement\r\nof flexible strata must have been caused.\r\n\r\nBut we also know by the study of regions liable to earthquakes, that there\r\nare causes at work in the interior of the earth capable of producing a\r\nsinking in of the ground, sometimes very local, but sometimes extending\r\nover a wide area. The frequent repetition, or continuance throughout long\r\nperiods, of such downward movements seems to imply the formation and\r\nrenewal of cavities at a certain depth below the surface, whether by the\r\nremoval of matter by volcanos and hot springs, or by the contraction of\r\nargillaceous rocks by heat and pressure, or any other combination of\r\ncircumstances. Whatever conjectures we may indulge respecting the causes,\r\nit is certain that pliable beds may, in consequence of unequal degrees of\r\nsubsidence, become folded to any amount, and have all the appearance of\r\nhaving been compressed suddenly by a lateral thrust.\r\n\r\nThe \"Creeps,\" as they are called in coal-mines, afford an excellent\r\nillustration of this fact.--First, it may be stated generally, that the\r\nexcavation of coal at a considerable depth causes the mass of overlying\r\nstrata to sink down bodily, even when props are left to support the roof of\r\nthe mine. \"In Yorkshire,\" says Mr. Buddle, \"three distinct subsidences were\r\nperceptible at the surface, after the clearing out of three seams of coal\r\nbelow, and innumerable vertical cracks were caused in the incumbent mass of\r\nsandstone and shale, which thus settled down.\"[50-A] The exact amount of\r\ndepression in these cases can only be accurately measured where water\r\naccumulates on the surface, or a railway traverses a coal-field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66. Section of carboniferous strata, at Wallsend,\r\nNewcastle, showing \"Creeps.\" (J. Buddle, Esq.) Horizontal length of\r\nsection 174 feet. The upper seam, or main coal, here worked out, was\r\n630 feet below the surface.]\r\n\r\nWhen a bed of coal is worked out, pillars or rectangular masses of coal are\r\nleft at intervals as props to support the roof, and protect the colliers.\r\nThus in fig. 66., representing a section at Wallsend, Newcastle, the\r\ngalleries which have been excavated are represented by the white spaces _a\r\nb_, while the adjoining dark portions are parts of the original coal-seam\r\nleft as props, beds of sandy clay or shale constituting the floor of the\r\nmine. When the props have been reduced in size, they are pressed down by\r\nthe weight of overlying rocks (no less than 630 feet thick) upon the shale\r\nbelow, which is thereby squeezed and forced up into the open spaces.\r\n\r\nNow it might have been expected, that instead of the floor rising up, the\r\nceiling would sink down, and this effect, called a \"Thrust,\" does, in fact,\r\ntake place where the pavement is more solid than the roof. But it usually\r\nhappens, in coal-mines, that the roof is composed of hard shale, or\r\noccasionally of sandstone, more unyielding than the foundation, which often\r\nconsists of clay. Even where the argillaceous substrata are hard at first,\r\nthey soon become softened and reduced to a plastic state when exposed to\r\nthe contact of air and water in the floor of a mine.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of a \"creep,\" says Mr. Buddle, is a slight curvature\r\nat the bottom of each gallery, as at _a_, fig. 66.: then the pavement\r\ncontinuing to rise, begins to open with a longitudinal crack, as at _b_:\r\nthen the points of the fractured ridge reach the roof, as at _c_; and,\r\nlastly, the upraised beds close up the whole gallery, and the broken\r\nportions of the ridge are re-united and flattened at the top, exhibiting\r\nthe flexure seen at _d_. Meanwhile the coal in the props has become\r\ncrushed and cracked by pressure. It is also found, that below the creeps\r\n_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, an inferior stratum, called the \"metal coal,\" which\r\nis 3 feet thick, has been fractured at the points _e_, _f_, _g_, _h_,\r\nand has risen, so as to prove that the upward movement, caused by the\r\nworking out of the \"main coal,\" has been propagated through a thickness\r\nof 54 feet of argillaceous beds, which intervene between the two coal\r\nseams. This same displacement has also been traced downwards more than\r\n150 feet below the metal coal, but it grows continually less and less\r\nuntil it becomes imperceptible.\r\n\r\nNo part of the process above described is more deserving of our notice than\r\nthe slowness with which the change in the arrangement of the beds is\r\nbrought about. Days, months, or even years, will sometimes elapse between\r\nthe first bending of the pavement and the time of its reaching the roof.\r\nWhere the movement has been most rapid, the curvature of the beds is most\r\nregular, and the reunion of the fractured ends most complete; whereas the\r\nsigns of displacement or violence are greatest in those creeps which have\r\nrequired months or years for their entire accomplishment. Hence we may\r\nconclude that similar changes may have been wrought on a larger scale in\r\nthe earth's crust by partial and gradual subsidences, especially where the\r\nground has been undermined throughout long periods of time; and we must be\r\non our guard against inferring sudden violence, simply because the\r\ndistortion of the beds is excessive.\r\n\r\nBetween the layers of shale, accompanying coal, we sometimes see the\r\nleaves of fossil ferns spread out as regularly as dried plants between\r\nsheets of paper in the herbarium of a botanist. These fern-leaves, or\r\nfronds, must have rested horizontally on soft mud, when first deposited.\r\nIf, therefore, they and the layers of shale are now inclined, or\r\nstanding on end, it is obviously the effect of subsequent derangement.\r\nThe proof becomes, if possible, still more striking when these strata,\r\nincluding vegetable remains, are curved again and again, and even folded\r\ninto the form of the letter Z, so that the same continuous layer of coal\r\nis cut through several times in the same perpendicular shaft. Thus, in\r\nthe coal-field near Mons, in Belgium, these zigzag bendings are repeated\r\nfour or five times, in the manner represented in fig. 67., the black\r\nlines representing seams of coal.[53-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67. Zigzag flexures of coal near Mons.]\r\n\r\n_Dip and Strike._--In the above remarks, several technical terms have been\r\nused, such as _dip_, the _unconformable position_ of strata, and the\r\n_anticlinal_ and _synclinal_ lines, which, as well as the _strike_ of the\r\nbeds, I shall now explain. If a stratum or bed of rock, instead of being\r\nquite level, be inclined to one side, it is said to _dip_; the point of the\r\ncompass to which it is inclined is called the _point of dip_, and the\r\ndegree of deviation from a level or horizontal line is called _the amount\r\nof dip_, or _the angle of dip_. Thus, in the annexed diagram (fig. 68.), a\r\nseries of strata are inclined, and they dip to the north at an angle of\r\nforty-five degrees. The _strike_, or _line of bearing_, is the prolongation\r\nor extension of the strata in a direction _at right angles_ to the dip; and\r\nhence it is sometimes called the _direction_ of the strata. Thus, in the\r\nabove instance of strata dipping to the north, their strike must\r\nnecessarily be east and west. We have borrowed the word from the German\r\ngeologists, _streichen_ signifying to extend, to have a certain direction.\r\nDip and strike may be aptly illustrated by a row of houses running east and\r\nwest, the long ridge of the roof representing the strike of the stratum of\r\nslates, which dip on one side to the north, and on the other to the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68. Diagram.]\r\n\r\nA stratum which is horizontal, or quite level in all directions, has\r\nneither dip nor strike.\r\n\r\nIt is always important for the geologist, who is endeavouring to comprehend\r\nthe structure of a country, to learn how the beds dip in every part of the\r\ndistrict; but it requires some practice to avoid being occasionally\r\ndeceived, both as to the point of dip and the amount of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. Apparent horizontality of inclined strata.]\r\n\r\nIf the upper surface of a hard stony stratum be uncovered, whether\r\nartificially in a quarry, or by the waves at the foot of a cliff, it is\r\neasy to determine towards what point of the compass the slope is steepest,\r\nor in what direction water would flow, if poured upon it. This is the true\r\ndip. But the edges of highly inclined strata may give rise to perfectly\r\nhorizontal lines in the face of a vertical cliff, if the observer see the\r\nstrata in the line of their strike, the dip being inwards from the face of\r\nthe cliff. If, however, we come to a break in the cliff, which exhibits a\r\nsection exactly at right angles to the line of the strike, we are then able\r\nto ascertain the true dip. In the annexed drawing (fig. 69.), we may\r\nsuppose a headland, one side of which faces to the north, where the beds\r\nwould appear perfectly horizontal to a person in the boat; while in the\r\nother side facing the west, the true dip would be seen by the person on\r\nshore to be at an angle of 40 deg.. If, therefore, our observations are\r\nconfined to a vertical precipice facing in one direction, we must endeavour\r\nto find a ledge or portion of the plane of one of the beds projecting\r\nbeyond the others, in order to ascertain the true dip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70. Explanatory sketch.]\r\n\r\nIt is rarely important to determine the angle of inclination with such\r\nminuteness as to require the aid of the instrument called a clinometer. We\r\nmay measure the angle within a few degrees by standing exactly opposite to\r\na cliff where the true dip is exhibited, holding the hands immediately\r\nbefore the eyes, and placing the fingers of one in a perpendicular, and of\r\nthe other in a horizontal position, as in fig. 70. It is thus easy to\r\ndiscover whether the lines of the inclined beds bisect the angle of 90 deg.,\r\nformed by the meeting of the hands, so as to give an angle of 45 deg., or\r\nwhether it would divide the space into two equal or unequal portions. The\r\nupper dotted line may express a stratum dipping to the north; but should\r\nthe beds dip precisely to the opposite point of the compass as in the\r\nlower dotted line, it will be seen that the amount of inclination may still\r\nbe measured by the hands with equal facility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. Section illustrating the structure of\r\nthe Swiss Jura.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72. Ground plan of the denuded ridge, fig. 71.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. Transverse section.]\r\n\r\nIt has been already seen, in describing the curved strata on the east coast\r\nof Scotland, in Forfarshire and Berwickshire, that a series of concave and\r\nconvex bendings are occasionally repeated several times. These usually form\r\npart of a series of parallel waves of strata, which are prolonged in the\r\nsame direction throughout a considerable extent of country. Thus, for\r\nexample, in the Swiss Jura, that lofty chain of mountains has been proved\r\nto consist of many parallel ridges, with intervening longitudinal valleys,\r\nas in fig. 71., the ridges being formed by curved fossiliferous strata, of\r\nwhich the nature and dip are occasionally displayed in deep transverse\r\ngorges, called \"cluses,\" caused by fractures at right angles to the\r\ndirection of the chain.[55-A] Now let us suppose these ridges and parallel\r\nvalleys to run north and south, we should then say that the _strike_ of the\r\nbeds is north and south, and the _dip_ east and west. Lines drawn along the\r\nsummits of the ridges, A, B, would be anticlinal lines, and one following\r\nthe bottom of the adjoining valleys a synclinal line. It will be observed\r\nthat some of these ridges, A, B, are unbroken on the summit, whereas one of\r\nthem, C, has been fractured along the line of strike, and a portion of it\r\ncarried away by denudation, so that the ridges of the beds in the\r\nformations _a_, _b_, _c_, come out to the day, or, as the miners say, _crop\r\nout_, on the sides of a valley. The ground plan of such a denuded ridge as\r\nC, as given in a geological map, may be expressed by the diagram fig. 72.,\r\nand the cross section of the same by fig. 73. The line D E, fig. 72., is\r\nthe anticlinal line, on each side of which the dip is in opposite\r\ndirections, as expressed by the arrows. The emergence of strata at the\r\nsurface is called by miners their _outcrop_ or _basset_.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of being folded into parallel ridges, the beds form a boss or\r\ndome-shaped protuberance, and if we suppose the summit of the dome carried\r\noff, the ground plan would exhibit the edges of the strata forming a\r\nsuccession of circles, or ellipses, round a common centre. These circles\r\nare the lines of strike, and the dip being always at right angles is\r\ninclined in the course of the circuit to every point of the compass,\r\nconstituting what is termed a qua-quaversal dip--that is, turning each way.\r\n\r\nThere are endless variations in the figures described by the basset-edges\r\nof the strata, according to the different inclination of the beds, and the\r\nmode in which they happen to have been denuded. One of the simplest rules\r\nwith which every geologist should be acquainted, relates to the V-like form\r\nof the beds as they crop out in an ordinary valley. First, if the strata be\r\nhorizontal, the V-like form will be also on a level, and the newest strata\r\nwill appear at the greatest heights.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if the beds be inclined and intersected by a valley sloping in\r\nthe same direction, and the dip of the beds be less steep than the slope\r\nof the valley, then the V's, as they are often termed by miners, will\r\npoint upwards (see fig. 74.), those formed by the newer beds appearing\r\nin a superior position, and extending highest up the valley, as A\r\nis seen above B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. Slope of valley 40 deg., dip of strata 20 deg..]\r\n\r\nThirdly, if the dip of the beds be steeper than the slope of the valley,\r\nthen the V's will point downwards (see fig. 75.), and those formed of the\r\nolder beds will now appear uppermost, as B appears above A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75. Slope of valley 20 deg., dip of strata 50 deg..]\r\n\r\nFourthly, in every case where the strata dip in a contrary direction to\r\nthe slope of the valley, whatever be the angle of inclination, the newer\r\nbeds will appear the highest, as in the first and second cases. This is\r\nshown by the drawing (fig. 76.), which exhibits strata rising at an\r\nangle of 20 deg., and crossed by a valley, which declines in an opposite\r\ndirection at 20 deg..[57-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76. Slope of valley 20 deg., dip of strata 20 deg.,\r\nin opposite directions.]\r\n\r\nThese rules may often be of great practical utility; for the different\r\ndegrees of dip occurring in the two cases represented in figures 74 and 75.\r\nmay occasionally be encountered in following the same line of flexure at\r\npoints a few miles distant from each other. A miner unacquainted with the\r\nrule, who had first explored the valley (fig. 74.), may have sunk a\r\nvertical shaft below the coal seam A, until he reached the inferior bed B.\r\nHe might then pass to the valley fig. 75., and discovering there also the\r\noutcrop of two coal seams, might begin his workings in the uppermost in the\r\nexpectation of coming down to the other bed A, which would be observed\r\ncropping out lower down the valley. But a glance at the section will\r\ndemonstrate the futility of such hopes.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, an anticlinal axis forms a ridge, and a synclinal\r\naxis a valley, as in A, B, fig. 62. p. 48.; but there are exceptions to\r\nthis rule, the beds sometimes sloping inwards from either side of a\r\nmountain, as in fig. 77.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nOn following one of the anticlinal ridges of the Jura, before mentioned, A,\r\nB, C, fig. 71., we often discover longitudinal cracks and sometimes large\r\nfissures along the line where the flexure was greatest. Some of these, as\r\nabove stated, have been enlarged by denudation into valleys of considerable\r\nwidth, as at C, fig. 71., which follow the line of strike, and which we may\r\nsuppose to have been hollowed out at the time when these rocks were still\r\nbeneath the level of the sea, or perhaps at the period of their gradual\r\nemergence from beneath the waters. The existence of such cracks at the\r\npoint of the sharpest bending of solid strata of limestone is precisely\r\nwhat we should have expected; but the occasional want of all similar signs\r\nof fracture, even where the strain has been greatest, as at _a_, fig. 71.,\r\nis not always easy to explain. We must imagine that many strata of\r\nlimestone, chert, and other rocks which are now brittle, were pliant when\r\nbent into their present position. They may have owed their flexibility in\r\npart to the fluid matter which they contained in their minute pores, as\r\nbefore described (p. 35.), and in part to the permeation of sea-water while\r\nthey were yet submerged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78. Strata of chert, grit, and marl, near St.\r\nJean de Luz.]\r\n\r\nAt the western extremity of the Pyrenees, great curvatures of the strata\r\nare seen in the sea cliffs, where the rocks consist of marl, grit, and\r\nchert. At certain points, as at _a_, fig. 78., some of the bendings of the\r\nflinty chert are so sharp, that specimens might be broken off, well fitted\r\nto serve as ridge-tiles on the roof of a house. Although this chert could\r\nnot have been brittle as now, when first folded into this shape, it\r\npresents, nevertheless, here and there at the points of greatest flexure\r\nsmall cracks, which show that it was solid, and not wholly incapable of\r\nbreaking at the period of its displacement. The numerous rents alluded to\r\nare not empty, but filled with calcedony and quartz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79. Cross section.\r\n\r\n  _g._ gypsum.\r\n  _m._ marl.]\r\n\r\nBetween San Caterina and Castrogiovanni, in Sicily, bent and undulating\r\ngypseous marls occur, with here and there thin beds of solid gypsum\r\ninterstratified. Sometimes these solid layers have been broken into\r\ndetached fragments, still preserving their sharp edges (_g g_, fig.\r\n79.), while the continuity of the more pliable and ductile marls, _m m_,\r\nhas not been interrupted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nI shall conclude my remarks on bent strata by stating, that, in mountainous\r\nregions like the Alps, it is often difficult for an experienced geologist\r\nto determine correctly the relative age of beds by superposition, so often\r\nhave the strata been folded back upon themselves, the upper parts of the\r\ncurve having been removed by denudation. Thus, if we met with the strata\r\nseen in the section fig. 80., we should naturally suppose that there were\r\ntwelve distinct beds, or sets of beds, No. 1. being the newest, and No. 12.\r\nthe oldest of the series. But this section may, perhaps, exhibit merely six\r\nbeds, which have been folded in the manner seen in fig. 81., so that each\r\nof them is twice repeated, the position of one half being reversed, and\r\npart of No. 1., originally the uppermost, having now become the lowest of\r\nthe series. These phenomena are often observable on a magnificent scale in\r\ncertain regions in Switzerland in precipices from 2000 to 3000 feet in\r\nperpendicular height. In the Iselten Alp, in the valley of the Lutschine,\r\nbetween Unterseen and Grindelwald, curves of calcareous shale are seen from\r\n1000 to 1500 feet in height, in which the beds sometimes plunge down\r\nvertically for a depth of 1000 feet and more, before they bend round again.\r\nThere are many flexures not inferior in dimensions in the Pyrenees, as\r\nthose near Gavarnie, at the base of Mont Perdu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81. Cross section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82. Curved strata of the Iselten Alp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83. Unconformable junction of old red sandstone and\r\nSilurian schist at the Siccar Point, near St. Abb's Head, Berwickshire. See\r\nalso Frontispiece.]\r\n\r\n_Unconformable stratification._--Strata are said to be unconformable,\r\nwhen one series is so placed over another, that the planes of the\r\nsuperior repose on the edges of the inferior (see fig. 83.). In this\r\ncase it is evident that a period had elapsed between the production of\r\nthe two sets of strata, and that, during this interval, the older\r\nseries had been tilted and disturbed. Afterwards the upper series was\r\nthrown down in horizontal strata upon it. If these superior beds, as\r\n_d_, _d_, fig. 83., are also inclined, it is plain that the lower\r\nstrata, _a_, _a_, have been twice displaced; first, before the\r\ndeposition of the newer beds, _d_, _d_, and a second time when these\r\nsame strata were thrown out of the horizontal position.\r\n\r\nPlayfair has remarked[60-A] that this kind of junction which we now call\r\nunconformable had been described before the time of Hutton, but that he was\r\nthe first geologist who appreciated its importance, as illustrating the\r\nhigh antiquity and great revolutions of the globe. He had observed that\r\nwhere such contacts occur, the lowest beds of the newer series very\r\ngenerally consist of a breccia or conglomerate consisting of angular and\r\nrounded fragments, derived from the breaking up of the more ancient rocks.\r\nOn one occasion the Scotch geologist took his two distinguished pupils,\r\nPlayfair and Sir James Hall, to the cliffs on the east coast of Scotland,\r\nnear the village of Eyemouth, not far from St. Abb's Head, where the\r\nschists of the Lammermuir range are undermined and dissected by the sea.\r\nHere the curved and vertical strata, now known to be of Silurian age, and\r\nwhich often exhibit a ripple-marked surface[60-B], are well exposed at the\r\nheadland called the Siccar Point, penetrating with their edges into the\r\nincumbent beds of slightly inclined sandstone, in which large pieces of the\r\nschist, some round and others angular, are united by an arenaceous cement.\r\n\"What clearer evidence,\" exclaims Playfair, \"could we have had of the\r\ndifferent formation of these rocks, and of the long interval which\r\nseparated their formation, had we actually seen them emerging from the\r\nbosom of the deep? We felt ourselves necessarily carried back to the time\r\nwhen the schistus on which we stood was yet at the bottom of the sea, and\r\nwhen the sandstone before us was only beginning to be deposited in the\r\nshape of sand or mud, from the waters of a superincumbent ocean. An epoch\r\nstill more remote presented itself, when even the most ancient of these\r\nrocks, instead of standing upright in vertical beds, lay in horizontal\r\nplanes at the bottom of the sea, and was not yet disturbed by that\r\nimmeasurable force which has burst asunder the solid pavement of the globe.\r\nRevolutions still more remote appeared in the distance of this\r\nextraordinary perspective. The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far\r\ninto the abyss of time; and while we listened with earnestness and\r\nadmiration to the philosopher who was now unfolding to us the order and\r\nseries of these wonderful events, we became sensible how much farther\r\nreason may sometimes go than imagination can venture to follow.\"[60-C]\r\n\r\nIn the frontispiece of this volume the reader will see a view of this\r\nclassical spot, reduced from a large picture, faithfully sketched and\r\ncoloured from nature by the youngest son of the late Sir James Hall. It was\r\nimpossible, however, to do justice to the original sketch, in an\r\nengraving, as the contrast of the red sandstone and the light fawn-coloured\r\nvertical schists could not be expressed. From the point of view here\r\nselected, the underlying beds of the perpendicular schist, _a_, are visible\r\nat _b_ through a small opening in the fractured beds of the covering of red\r\nsandstone, _d d_, while on the vertical face of the old schist at _a' a\"_ a\r\nconspicuous ripple-mark is displayed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84. Junction of unconformable strata near\r\nMons, in Belgium.]\r\n\r\nIt often happens that in the interval between the deposition of two sets of\r\nunconformable strata, the inferior rock has not only been denuded, but\r\ndrilled by perforating shells. Thus, for example, at Autreppe and Gusigny,\r\nnear Mons, beds of an ancient (paleozoic) limestone, highly inclined, and\r\noften bent, are covered with horizontal strata of greenish and whitish\r\nmarls of the Cretaceous formation. The lowest and therefore the oldest bed\r\nof the horizontal series is usually the sand and conglomerate, _a_, in\r\nwhich are rounded fragments of stone, from an inch to two feet in diameter.\r\nThese fragments have often adhering shells attached to them, and have been\r\nbored by perforating mollusca. The solid surface of the inferior limestone\r\nhas also been bored, so as to exhibit cylindrical and pear-shaped cavities,\r\nas at _c_, the work of saxicavous mollusca; and many rents, as at _b_,\r\nwhich descend several feet or yards into the limestone, have been filled\r\nwith sand and shells, similar to those in the stratum _a_.\r\n\r\n_Fractures of the strata and faults._--Numerous rents may often be seen in\r\nrocks which appear to have been simply broken, the separated parts\r\nremaining in the same places; but we often find a fissure, several inches\r\nor yards wide, intervening between the disunited portions. These fissures\r\nare usually filled with fine earth and sand, or with angular fragments of\r\nstone, evidently derived from the fracture of the contiguous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe face of each wall of the fissure is often beautifully polished, as if\r\nglazed, and not unfrequently striated or scored with parallel furrows and\r\nridges, such as would be produced by the continued rubbing together of\r\nsurfaces of unequal hardness. These polished surfaces are called by miners\r\n\"slickensides.\" It is supposed that the lines of the striae indicate the\r\ndirection in which the rocks were moved. During one of the minor\r\nearthquakes in Chili, which happened about the year 1840, and was described\r\nto me by an eye-witness, the brick walls of a building were rent vertically\r\nin several places, and made to vibrate for several minutes during each\r\nshock, after which they remained uninjured, and without any opening,\r\nalthough the line of each crack was still visible. When all movement had\r\nceased, there were seen on the floor of the house, at the bottom of each\r\nrent, small heaps of fine brickdust, evidently produced by trituration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85. Faults. A B perpendicular, C D oblique\r\nto the horizon.]\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find the mass of rock, on one side of a fissure,\r\nthrown up above or down below the mass with which it was once in contact on\r\nthe other side. This mode of displacement is called a shift, slip, or\r\nfault. \"The miner,\" says Playfair, describing a fault, \"is often perplexed,\r\nin his subterraneous journey, by a derangement in the strata, which changes\r\nat once all those lines and bearings which had hitherto directed his\r\ncourse. When his mine reaches a certain plane, which is sometimes\r\nperpendicular, as in A B, fig. 85., sometimes oblique to the horizon (as in\r\nC D, ibid.), he finds the beds of rock broken asunder, those on the one\r\nside of the plane having changed their place, by sliding in a particular\r\ndirection along the face of the others. In this motion they have sometimes\r\npreserved their parallelism, as in fig. 85., so that the strata on each\r\nside of the faults A B, C D, continue parallel to one another; in other\r\ncases, the strata on each side are inclined, as in _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ (fig.\r\n86.), though their identity is still to be recognized by their possessing\r\nthe same thickness, and the same internal characters.\"[62-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86. E F, fault or fissure filled with rubbish, on each\r\nside of which the shifted strata are not parallel.]\r\n\r\nIn Coalbrook Dale, says Mr. Prestwich[62-B], deposits of sandstone, shale,\r\nand coal, several thousand feet thick, and occupying an area of many miles,\r\nhave been shivered into fragments, and the broken remnants have been placed\r\nin very discordant positions, often at levels differing several hundred\r\nfeet from each other. The sides of the faults, when perpendicular, are\r\ncommonly separated several yards, but are sometimes as much as 50 yards\r\nasunder, the interval being filled with broken _debris_ of the strata. In\r\nfollowing the course of the same fault it is sometimes found to produce in\r\ndifferent places very unequal changes of level, the amount of shift being\r\nin one place 300, and in another 700 feet, which arises, in some cases,\r\nfrom the union of two or more faults. In other words, the disjointed strata\r\nhave in certain districts been subjected to renewed movements, which they\r\nhave not suffered elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe may occasionally see exact counterparts of these slips, on a small\r\nscale, in pits of fine loose sand and gravel, many of which have doubtless\r\nbeen caused by the drying and shrinking of argillaceous and other beds,\r\nslight subsidences having taken place from failure of support. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, even these small slips may have been produced during earthquakes;\r\nfor land has been moved, and its level, relatively to the sea, considerably\r\naltered, within the period when much of the alluvial sand and gravel now\r\ncovering the surface of continents was deposited.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that a geologist must be on his guard, in a region of\r\ndisturbed strata, against inferring repeated alternations of rocks, when,\r\nin fact, the same strata, once continuous, have been bent round so as to\r\nrecur in the same section, and with the same dip. A similar mistake has\r\noften been occasioned by a series of faults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87. Apparent alternations of strata caused\r\nby vertical faults.]\r\n\r\nIf, for example, the dark line A H (fig. 87.) represent the surface of a\r\ncountry on which the strata _a b c_ frequently crop out, an observer,\r\nwho is proceeding from H to A, might at first imagine that at every step\r\nhe was approaching new strata, whereas the repetition of the same beds\r\nhas been caused by vertical faults, or downthrows. Thus, suppose the\r\noriginal mass, A, B, C, D, to have been a set of uniformly inclined\r\nstrata, and that the different masses under E F, F G, and G D, sank down\r\nsuccessively, so as to leave vacant the spaces marked in the diagram by\r\ndotted lines, and to occupy those marked by the continuous lines, then\r\nlet denudation take place along the line A H, so that the protruding\r\nmasses indicated by the fainter lines are swept away,--a miner, who has\r\nnot discovered the faults, finding the mass _a_, which we will suppose\r\nto be a bed of coal four times repeated, might hope to find four beds,\r\nworkable to an indefinite depth, but first on arriving at the fault G he\r\nis stopped suddenly in his workings, upon reaching the strata of\r\nsandstone _c_, or on arriving at the line of fault F he comes partly\r\nupon the shale _b_, and partly on the sandstone _c_, and on reaching E\r\nhe is again stopped by a wall composed of the rock _d_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nThe very different levels at which the separated parts of the same strata\r\nare found on the different sides of the fissure, in some faults, is truly\r\nastonishing. One of the most celebrated in England is that called the\r\n\"ninety-fathom dike,\" in the coal-field of Newcastle. This name has been\r\ngiven to it, because the same beds are ninety fathoms lower on the northern\r\nthan they are on the southern side. The fissure has been filled by a body\r\nof sand, which is now in the state of sandstone, and is called the dike,\r\nwhich is sometimes very narrow, but in other places more than twenty yards\r\nwide.[64-A] The walls of the fissure are scored by grooves, such as would\r\nhave been produced if the broken ends of the rock had been rubbed along the\r\nplane of the fault.[64-B] In the Tynedale and Craven faults, in the north\r\nof England, the vertical displacement is still greater, and has extended in\r\na horizontal direction for a distance of thirty miles or more. Some\r\ngeologists consider it necessary to imagine that the upward or downward\r\nmovement in these cases was accomplished at a single stroke, and not by a\r\nseries of sudden but interrupted movements. This idea appears to have been\r\nderived from a notion that the grooved walls have merely been rubbed in one\r\ndirection. But this is so far from being a constant phenomenon in faults,\r\nthat it has often been objected to the received theory respecting those\r\npolished surfaces called \"slickensides\" (see above, p. 61.), that the striae\r\nare not always parallel, but often curved and irregular. It has, moreover,\r\nbeen remarked, that not only the walls of the fissure or fault, but its\r\nearthy contents, sometimes present the same polished and striated faces.\r\nNow these facts seem to indicate partial changes in the direction of the\r\nmovement, and some slidings subsequent to the first filling up of the\r\nfissure. Suppose the mass of rock A, B, C, to overlie an extensive chasm _d\r\ne_, formed at the depth of several miles, whether by the gradual\r\ncontraction in bulk of a melted mass passing into a solid or crystalline\r\nstate, or the shrinking of argillaceous strata, baked by a moderate heat,\r\nor by the subtraction of matter by volcanic action, or any other cause.\r\nNow, if this region be convulsed by earthquakes, the fissures _f g_, and\r\nothers at right angles to them, may sever the mass B from A and from C, so\r\nthat it may move freely, and begin to sink into the chasm. A fracture may\r\nbe conceived so clean and perfect as to allow it to subside at once to the\r\nbottom of the subterranean cavity; but it is far more probable that the\r\nsinking will be effected at successive periods during different\r\nearthquakes, the mass always continuing to slide in the same direction\r\nalong the planes of the fissures _f g_, and the edges of the falling mass\r\nbeing continually more broken and triturated at each convulsion. If, as is\r\nnot improbable, the circumstances which have caused the failure of support\r\ncontinue in operation, it may happen that when the mass B has filled the\r\ncavity first formed, its foundations will again give way under it, so that\r\nit will fall again in the same direction. But, if the direction should\r\nchange, the fact could not be discovered by observing the slickensides,\r\nbecause the last scoring would efface the lines of previous friction. In\r\nthe present state of our ignorance of the causes of subsidence, an\r\nhypothesis which can explain the great amount of displacement in some\r\nfaults, on sound mechanical principles, by a succession of movements, is\r\nfar preferable to any theory which assumes each fault to have been\r\naccomplished by a single upcast or downthrow of several thousand feet. For\r\nwe know that there are operations now in progress, at great depths in the\r\ninterior of the earth, by which both large and small tracts of ground are\r\nmade to rise above and sink below their former level, some slowly and\r\ninsensibly, others suddenly and by starts, a few feet or yards at a time;\r\nwhereas there are no grounds for believing that, during the last 3000 years\r\nat least, any regions have been either upheaved or depressed, at a single\r\nstroke, to the amount of several hundred, much less several thousand feet.\r\nWhen some of the ancient marine formations are described in the sequel, it\r\nwill appear that their structure and organic contents point to the\r\nconclusion, that the floor of the ocean was slowly sinking at the time of\r\ntheir origin. The downward movement was very gradual, and in Wales and the\r\ncontiguous parts of England a maximum thickness of 32,000 feet (more than\r\nsix miles) of Carboniferous, Devonian, and Silurian rock was formed, whilst\r\nthe bed of the sea was all the time continuously and tranquilly\r\nsubsiding.[65-A] Whatever may have been the changes which the solid\r\nfoundation underwent, whether accompanied by the melting, consolidation,\r\ncrystallization, or desiccation of subjacent mineral matter, it is clear\r\nfrom the fact of the sea having remained shallow all the while that the\r\nbottom never sank down suddenly to the depth of many hundred feet at once.\r\n\r\nIt is by assuming such reiterated variations of level, each separately of\r\nsmall vertical amount, but multiplied by time till they acquire importance\r\nin the aggregate, that we are able to explain the phenomena of denudation,\r\nwhich will be treated of in the next chapter. By such movements every\r\nportion of the surface of the land becomes in its turn a line of coast, and\r\nis exposed to the action of the waves and tides. A country which is\r\nundergoing such movement is never allowed to settle into a state of\r\nequilibrium, therefore the force of rivers and torrents to remove or\r\nexcavate soil and rocky masses is sustained in undiminished energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46-A] In the first three editions of my Principles of Geology, I expressed\r\nmany doubts as to the validity of the alleged proofs of a gradual rise of\r\nland in Sweden; but after visiting that country, in 1834, I retracted these\r\nobjections, and published a detailed statement of the observations which\r\nled me to alter my opinion in the Phil.

Geologists have perhaps been seldom in the\r\nhabit of reflecting that this operation has exerted an influence on the\r\nstructure of the earth's crust as universal and important as sedimentary\r\ndeposition itself; for denudation is the inseparable accompaniment of the\r\nproduction of all new strata of mechanical origin. The formation of every\r\nnew deposit by the transport of sediment and pebbles necessarily implies\r\nthat there has been, somewhere else, a grinding down of rock into rounded\r\nfragments, sand, or mud, equal in quantity to the new strata. All\r\ndeposition, therefore, except in the case of a shower of volcanic ashes, is\r\nthe sign of superficial waste going on contemporaneously, and to an equal\r\namount elsewhere. The gain at one point is no more than sufficient to\r\nbalance the loss at some other. Here a lake has grown shallower, there a\r\nravine has been deepened. The bed of the sea has in one region been raised\r\nby the accumulation of new matter, in another its depth has been augmented\r\nby the abstraction of an equal quantity.\r\n\r\nWhen we see a stone building, we know that somewhere, far or near, a quarry\r\nhas been opened. The courses of stone in the building may be compared to\r\nsuccessive strata, the quarry to a ravine or valley which has suffered\r\ndenudation. As the strata, like the courses of hewn stone, have been laid\r\none upon another gradually, so the excavation both of the valley and quarry\r\nhave been gradual. To pursue the comparison still farther, the superficial\r\nheaps of mud, sand, and gravel, usually called alluvium, may be likened to\r\nthe rubbish of a quarry which has been rejected as useless by the workmen,\r\nor has fallen upon the road between the quarry and the building, so as to\r\nlie scattered at random over the ground.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the entire mass of stratified deposits in the earth's crust is at\r\nonce the monument and measure of the denudation which has taken place, on\r\nhow stupendous a scale ought we to find the signs of this removal of\r\ntransported materials in past ages! Accordingly, there are different\r\nclasses of phenomena, which attest in a most striking manner the vast\r\nspaces left vacant by the erosive power of water. I may allude, first, to\r\nthose valleys on both sides of which the same strata are seen following\r\neach other in the same order, and having the same mineral composition and\r\nfossil contents. We may observe, for example, several formations, as Nos.\r\n1, 2, 3, 4, in the accompanying diagram (fig. 89.); No. 1. conglomerate,\r\nNo. 2. clay, No. 3. grit, and No. 4. limestone, each repeated in a series\r\nof hills separated by valleys varying in depth. When we examine the\r\nsubordinate parts of these four formations, we find, in like manner,\r\ndistinct beds in each, corresponding, on the opposite sides of the valleys,\r\nboth in composition and order of position. No one can doubt that the strata\r\nwere originally continuous, and that some cause has swept away the portions\r\nwhich once connected the whole series. A torrent on the side of a mountain\r\nproduces similar interruptions; and when we make artificial cuts in\r\nlowering roads, we expose, in like manner, corresponding beds on either\r\nside. But in nature, these appearances occur in mountains several thousand\r\nfeet high, and separated by intervals of many miles or leagues in extent,\r\nof which a grand exemplification is described by Dr. MacCulloch, on the\r\nnorth-western coast of Ross-shire, in Scotland.[67-A] The fundamental rock\r\nof that country is gneiss, in disturbed strata, on which beds of nearly\r\nhorizontal red sandstone rest unconformably. The latter are often very\r\nthin, forming mere flags, with their surfaces, distinctly ripple-marked.\r\nThey end abruptly on the declivities of many insulated mountains, which\r\nrise up at once to the height of about 2000 feet above the gneiss of the\r\nsurrounding plain or table land, and to an average elevation of about 3000\r\nfeet above the sea, which all their summits generally attain. The base of\r\ngneiss varies in height, so that the lower portions of the sandstone occupy\r\ndifferent levels, and the thickness of the mass is various, sometimes\r\nexceeding 3000 feet. It is impossible to compare these scattered and\r\ndetached portions without imagining that the whole country has once been\r\ncovered with a great body of sandstone, and that masses from 1000 to more\r\nthan 3000 feet in thickness have been removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89. Valleys of denudation. _a._ alluvium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90. Denudation of red sandstone on north-west coast of\r\nRoss-shire. (MacCulloch.)]\r\n\r\nIn the \"Survey of Great Britain\" (vol. i.), Professor Ramsay has shown\r\nthat the missing beds, removed from the summit of the Mendips, must have\r\nbeen nearly a mile in thickness; and he has pointed out considerable areas\r\nin South Wales and some of the adjacent counties of England, where a series\r\nof palaeozoic strata, not less than 11,000 feet in thickness, have been\r\nstripped off. All these materials have of course been transported to new\r\nregions, and have entered into the composition of more modern formations.\r\nOn the other hand, it is shown by observations in the same \"Survey,\" that\r\nthe palaeozoic strata are from 20,000 to 30,000 feet thick. It is clear that\r\nsuch rocks, formed of mud and sand, now for the most part consolidated, are\r\nthe monuments of denuding operations, which took place on a grand scale at\r\na very remote period in the earth's history. For, whatever has been given\r\nto one area must always have been borrowed from another; a truth which,\r\nobvious as it may seem when thus stated, must be repeatedly impressed on\r\nthe student's mind, because in many geological speculations it is taken for\r\ngranted that the external crust of the earth has been always growing\r\nthicker, in consequence of the accumulation, period after period, of\r\nsedimentary matter, as if the new strata were not always produced at the\r\nexpense of pre-existing rocks, stratified or unstratified. By duly\r\nreflecting on the fact, that all deposits of mechanical origin imply the\r\ntransportation from some other region, whether contiguous or remote, of an\r\nequal amount of solid matter, we perceive that the stony exterior of the\r\nplanet must always have grown thinner in one place whenever, by accessions\r\nof new strata, it was acquiring density in another. No doubt the vacant\r\nspace left by the missing rocks, after extensive denudation, is less\r\nimposing to the imagination than a vast thickness of conglomerate or\r\nsandstone, or the bodily presence as it were of a mountain-chain, with all\r\nits inclined and curved strata. But the denuded tracts speak a clear and\r\nemphatic language to our reason, and, like repeated layers of fossil\r\nnummulites, corals or shells, or like numerous seams of coal, each based on\r\nits under clay full of the roots of trees, still remaining in their natural\r\nposition, demand an indefinite lapse of time for their elaboration.\r\n\r\nNo one will maintain that the fossils entombed in these rocks did not\r\nbelong to many successive generations of plants and animals. In like\r\nmanner, each sedimentary deposit attests a slow and gradual action, and the\r\nstrata not only serve as a measure of the amount of denudation\r\nsimultaneously effected elsewhere, but are also a correct indication of the\r\nrate at which the denuding operation was carried on.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most convincing evidence of denudation on a magnificent scale\r\nis derived from the levelled surfaces of districts where large faults\r\noccur. I have shown, in fig. 87. p. 63., and in fig. 91., how angular and\r\nprotruding masses of rock might naturally have been looked for on the\r\nsurface immediately above great faults, although in fact they rarely exist.\r\nThis phenomenon may be well studied in those districts where coal has been\r\nextensively worked, for there the former relation of the beds which have\r\nshifted their position may be determined with great accuracy. Thus in the\r\ncoal field of Ashby de la Zouch, in Leicestershire (see fig. 91.), a fault\r\noccurs, on one side of which the coal beds _a b c d_ rise to the height of\r\n500 feet above the corresponding beds on the other side. But the uplifted\r\nstrata do not stand up 500 feet above the general surface; on the contrary,\r\nthe outline of the country, as expressed by the line _z z_, is uniform and\r\nunbroken, and the mass indicated by the dotted outline must have been\r\nwashed away.[69-A] There are proofs of this kind in some level countries,\r\nwhere dense masses of strata have been cleared away from areas several\r\nhundred square miles in extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91. Faults and denuded coal strata, Ashby de\r\nla Zouch. (Mammat.)]\r\n\r\nIn the Newcastle coal district it is ascertained that faults occur in\r\nwhich the upward or downward movement could not have been less than 140\r\nfathoms, which, had they affected equally the configuration of the\r\nsurface to that amount, would produce mountains with precipitous\r\nescarpments nearly 1000 feet high, or chasms of the like depth; yet is\r\nthe actual level of the country absolutely uniform--affording no trace\r\nwhatever of subterranean movements.[69-B]\r\n\r\nThe ground from which these materials have been removed is usually\r\noverspread with heaps of sand and gravel, formed out of the ruins of the\r\nvery rocks which have disappeared. Thus, in the districts above referred\r\nto, they consist of rounded and angular fragments of hard sandstone,\r\nlimestone, and ironstone, with a small quantity of the more destructible\r\nshale, and even rounded pieces of coal.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been already made to the shattered state and discordant\r\nposition of the carboniferous strata in Coalbrook Dale (p. 62.). The\r\ncollier cannot proceed three or four yards without meeting with small\r\nslips, and from time to time he encounters faults of considerable\r\nmagnitude, which have thrown the rocks up or down several hundred feet. Yet\r\nthe superficial inequalities to which these dislocated masses originally\r\ngave rise are no longer discernible, and the comparative flatness of the\r\nexisting surface can only be explained, as Mr. Prestwich has observed, by\r\nsupposing the fractured portions to have been removed by water. It is also\r\nclear that strata of red sandstone, more than 1000 feet thick, which once\r\ncovered the coal, in the same region, have been carried away from large\r\nareas. That water has, in this case, been the denuding agent, we may infer\r\nfrom the fact that the rocks have yielded according to their different\r\ndegrees of hardness; the hard trap of the Wrekin, for example, and other\r\nhills, having resisted more than the softer shale and sandstone, so as now\r\nto stand out in bold relief.[70-A]\r\n\r\n_Origin of valleys._--Many of the earlier geologists, and Dr. Hutton among\r\nthem, taught that \"rivers have in general hollowed out their valleys.\" This\r\nis true only of rivulets and torrents which are the feeders of the larger\r\nstreams, and which, descending over rapid slopes, are most subject to\r\ntemporary increase and diminution in the volume of their waters. The\r\nquantity of mud, sand, and pebbles constituting many a modern delta proves\r\nindisputably that no small part of the inequalities now existing on the\r\nearth's surface are due to fluviatile action; but the principal valleys in\r\nalmost every great hydrographical basin in the world, are of a shape and\r\nmagnitude which imply that they have been due to other causes besides the\r\nmere excavating power of rivers.\r\n\r\nSome geologists have imagined that a deluge, or succession of deluges, may\r\nhave been the chief denuding agency, and they have speculated on a series\r\nof enormous waves raised by the instantaneous upthrow of continents or\r\nmountain chains out of the sea. But even were we disposed to grant such\r\nsudden upheavals of the floor of the ocean, and to assume that great waves\r\nwould be the consequence of each convulsion, it is not easy to explain the\r\nobserved phenomena by the aid of so gratuitous an hypothesis.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a machinery of a totally different kind seems capable of\r\ngiving rise to effects of the required magnitude. It has now been\r\nascertained that the rising and sinking of extensive portions of the\r\nearth's crust, whether insensibly or by a repetition of sudden shocks, is\r\npart of the actual course of nature, and we may easily comprehend how the\r\nland may have been exposed during these movements to abrasion by the waves\r\nof the sea. In the same manner as a mountain mass may, in the course of\r\nages, be formed by sedimentary deposition, layer after layer, so masses\r\nequally voluminous may in time waste away by inches; as, for example, if\r\nbeds of incoherent materials are raised slowly in an open sea where a\r\nstrong current prevails. It is well known that some of these oceanic\r\ncurrents have a breadth of 200 miles, and that they sometimes run for a\r\nthousand miles or more in one direction, retaining a considerable velocity\r\neven at the depth of several hundred feet. Under these circumstances, the\r\nflowing waters may have power to clear away each stratum of incoherent\r\nmaterials as it rises and approaches the surface, where the waves exert the\r\ngreatest force; and in this manner a voluminous deposit may be entirely\r\nswept away, so that, in the absence of faults, no evidence may remain of\r\nthe denuding operation. It may indeed be affirmed that the signs of waste\r\nwill usually be least obvious where the destruction has been most\r\ncomplete; for the annihilation may have proceeded so far, that no ruins are\r\nleft of the dilapidated rocks.\r\n\r\nAlthough denudation has had a levelling influence on some countries of\r\nshattered and disturbed strata (see fig. 87. p. 63. and fig. 91. p. 69.),\r\nit has more commonly been the cause of superficial inequalities, especially\r\nin regions of horizontal stratification. The general outline of these\r\nregions is that of flat and level platforms, interrupted by valleys often\r\nof considerable depth, and ramifying in various directions. These hollows\r\nmay once have formed bays and channels between islands, and the steepest\r\nslope on the sides of each valley may have been a sea-cliff, which was\r\nundermined for ages, as the land emerged gradually from the deep. We may\r\nsuppose the position and course of each valley to have been originally\r\ndetermined by differences in the hardness of the rocks, and by rents and\r\njoints which usually occur even in horizontal strata. In mountain chains,\r\nsuch as the Jura before described (see fig. 71. p. 55.), we perceive at\r\nonce that the principal valleys have not been due to aqueous excavation,\r\nbut to those mechanical movements which have bent the rocks into their\r\npresent form. Yet even in the Jura there are many valleys, such as C (fig.\r\n71.), which have been hollowed out by water; and it may be stated that in\r\nevery part of the globe the unevenness of the surface of the land has been\r\ndue to the combined influence of subterranean movements and denudation.\r\n\r\nI may now recapitulate a few of the conclusions to which we have\r\narrived: first, all the mechanical strata have been accumulated\r\ngradually, and the concomitant denudation has been no less gradual:\r\nsecondly, the dry land consists in great part of strata formed\r\noriginally at the bottom of the sea, and has been made to emerge and\r\nattain its present height by a force acting from beneath: thirdly, no\r\ncombination of causes has yet been conceived so capable of producing\r\nextensive and gradual denudation, as the action of the waves and\r\ncurrents of the ocean upon land slowly rising out of the deep.\r\n\r\nNow, if we adopt these conclusions, we shall naturally be led to look\r\neverywhere for marks of the former residence of the sea upon the land,\r\nespecially near the coasts from which the last retreat of the waters took\r\nplace, and it will be found that such signs are not wanting.\r\n\r\nI shall have occasion to speak of ancient sea-cliffs, now far inland, in\r\nthe south-east of England, when treating in Chapter XIX. of the denudation\r\nof the chalk in Surrey, Kent, and Sussex. Lines of upraised sea-beaches of\r\nmore modern date are traced, at various levels from 20 to 100 feet and\r\nupwards above the present sea-level, for great distances on the east and\r\nwest coasts of Scotland, as well as in Devonshire, and other counties in\r\nEngland. These ancient beach-lines often form terraces of sand and gravel,\r\nincluding littoral shells, some broken, others entire, and corresponding\r\nwith species now living on the adjoining coast. But it would be\r\nunreasonable to expect to meet everywhere with the signs of ancient shores,\r\nsince no geologist can have failed to observe how soon all recent marks of\r\nthe kind above alluded to are obscured or entirely effaced, wherever, in\r\nconsequence of the altered state of the tides and currents, the sea has\r\nreceded for a few centuries. We see the cliffs crumble down in a few years\r\nif composed of sand or clay, and soon reduced to a gentle slope. If there\r\nwere shells on the beach they decompose, and their materials are washed\r\naway, after which the sand and shingle may resemble any other alluviums\r\nscattered over the interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92. Section of inland cliff at Abesse, near Dax.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Sand of the Landes.\r\n  _b._ Limestone.\r\n  _c._ Clay.]\r\n\r\nThe features of an ancient shore may sometimes be concealed by the\r\ngrowth of trees and shrubs, or by a covering of blown sand, a good\r\nexample of which occurs a few miles west from Dax, near Bordeaux, in the\r\nsouth of France. About twelve miles inland, a steep bank may be traced\r\nrunning in a direction nearly north-east and south-west, or parallel to\r\nthe contiguous coast. This sudden fall of about 50 feet conducts us from\r\nthe higher platform of the Landes to a lower plain which extends to the\r\nsea. The outline of the ground suggested to me, as it would do to every\r\ngeologist, the opinion that the bank in question was once a sea-cliff,\r\nwhen the whole country stood at a lower level. But this is no longer\r\nmatter of conjecture, for, in making excavations in 1830 for the\r\nfoundation of a building at Abesse, a quantity of loose sand, which\r\nformed the slope _d e_, was removed; and a perpendicular cliff, about 50\r\nfeet in height, which had hitherto been protected from the agency of the\r\nelements, was exposed. At the bottom appeared the limestone _b_,\r\ncontaining tertiary shells and corals, immediately below it the clay\r\n_c_, and above it the usual tertiary sand _a_, of the department of the\r\nLandes. At the base of the precipice were seen large partially rounded\r\nmasses of rock, evidently detached from the stratum _b_. The face of the\r\nlimestone was hollowed out and weathered into such forms as are seen in\r\nthe calcareous cliffs of the adjoining coast, especially at Biaritz,\r\nnear Bayonne. It is evident that, when the country was at a somewhat\r\nlower level, the sea advanced along the surface of the argillaceous\r\nstratum _c_, which, from its yielding nature, favoured the waste by\r\nallowing the more solid superincumbent stone _b_ to be readily\r\nundermined. Afterwards, when the country had been elevated, part of the\r\nsand, _a_, fell down, or was drifted by the winds, so as to form the\r\ntalus, _d e_, which masked the inland cliff until it was artificially\r\nlaid open to view.\r\n\r\nWhen we are considering the various causes which, in the course of ages,\r\nmay efface the characters of an ancient sea-coast, earthquakes must not be\r\nforgotten. During violent shocks, steep and overhanging cliffs are often\r\nthrown down and become a heap of ruins. Sometimes unequal movements of\r\nupheaval or depression entirely destroy that horizontality of the base-line\r\nwhich constitutes the chief peculiarity of an ancient sea-cliff.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in countries where hard limestone rocks abound, that inland\r\ncliffs retain faithfully the characters which they acquired when they\r\nconstituted the boundary of land and sea. Thus, in the Morea, no less than\r\nthree, or even four, ranges of what were once sea-cliffs are well\r\npreserved. These have been described, by MM. Boblaye and Virlet, as rising\r\none above the other at different distances from the actual shore, the\r\nsummit of the highest and oldest occasionally exceeding 1000 feet in\r\nelevation. At the base of each there is usually a terrace, which is in some\r\nplaces a few yards, in others above 300 yards wide, so that we are\r\nconducted from the high land of the interior to the sea by a succession of\r\ngreat steps. These inland cliffs are most perfect, and most exactly\r\nresemble those now washed by the waves of the Mediterranean, where they are\r\nformed of calcareous rock, especially if the rock be a hard crystalline\r\nmarble. The following are the points of correspondence observed between the\r\nancient coast lines and the borders of the present sea:--1. A range of\r\nvertical precipices, with a terrace at their base. 2. A weathered state of\r\nthe surface of the naked rock, such as the spray of the sea produces. 3. A\r\nline of littoral caverns at the foot of the cliffs. 4. A consolidated beach\r\nor breccia with occasional marine shells, found at the base of the cliffs,\r\nor in the caves. 5. Lithodomous perforations.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first of these, it would be superfluous to dwell on the\r\nevidence afforded of the undermining power of waves and currents by\r\nperpendicular precipices. The littoral caves, also, will be familiar to\r\nthose who have had opportunities of observing the manner in which the waves\r\nof the sea, when they beat against rocks, have power to scoop out caverns.\r\nAs to the breccia, it is composed of pieces of limestone and rolled\r\nfragments of thick solid shell, such as _Strombus_ and _Spondylus_, all\r\nbound together by a crystalline calcareous cement. Similar aggregations are\r\nnow forming on the modern beaches of Greece, and in caverns on the\r\nsea-side; and they are only distinguishable in character from those of more\r\nancient date, by including many pieces of pottery. In regard to the\r\n_lithodomi_ above alluded to, these bivalve mollusks are well known to have\r\nthe power of excavating holes in the hardest limestones, the size of the\r\ncavity keeping pace with the growth of the shell. When living they require\r\nto be always covered by salt water, but similar pear-shaped hollows,\r\ncontaining the dead shells of these creatures, are found at different\r\nheights on the face of the inland cliffs above mentioned. Thus, for\r\nexample, they have been observed near Modon and Navarino on cliffs in the\r\ninterior 125 feet high above the Mediterranean. As to the weathered surface\r\nof the calcareous rocks, all limestones are known to suffer chemical\r\ndecomposition when moistened by the spray of the salt water, and are\r\ncorroded still more deeply at points lower down where they are just reached\r\nby the breakers. By this action the stone acquires a wrinkled and furrowed\r\noutline, and very near the sea it becomes rough and branching, as if\r\ncovered with corals. Such effects are traced not only on the present shore,\r\nbut at the base of the ancient cliffs far in the interior. Lastly, it\r\nremains only to speak of the terraces, which extend with a gentle slope\r\nfrom the base of almost all the inland cliffs, and are for the most part\r\nnarrow where the rock is hard, but sometimes half a mile or more in breadth\r\nwhere it is soft. They are the effects of the encroachment of the ancient\r\nsea upon the shore at those levels at which the land remained for a long\r\ntime stationary. The justness of this view is apparent on examining the\r\nshape of the modern shore wherever the sea is advancing upon the land, and\r\nremoving annually small portions of undermined rock. By this agency a\r\nsubmarine platform is produced on which we may walk for some distance from\r\nthe beach in shallow water, the increase of depth being very gradual, until\r\nwe reach a point where the bottom plunges down suddenly. This platform is\r\nwidened with more or less rapidity according to the hardness of the rocks,\r\nand when upraised it constitutes an inland terrace.\r\n\r\nBut the four principal lines of cliff observed in the Morea do not imply,\r\nas some have imagined, four great eras of sudden upheaval; they simply\r\nindicate the intermittence of the upheaving force. Had the rise of the land\r\nbeen continuous and uninterrupted, there would have been no one prominent\r\nline of cliff; for every portion of the surface having been, in its turn,\r\nand for an equal period of time, a sea-shore, would have presented a nearly\r\nsimilar aspect. But if pauses occur in the process of upheaval, the waves\r\nand currents have time to sap, throw down, and clear away considerable\r\nmasses of rock, and to shape out at certain levels lofty ranges of cliffs\r\nwith broad terraces at their base.\r\n\r\nThere are some levelled spaces, however, both ancient and modern, in the\r\nMorea, which are not due to denudation, although resembling in outline\r\nthe terraces above described. They may be called Terraces of Deposition,\r\nsince they have resulted from the gain of land upon the sea where rivers\r\nand torrents have produced deltas. If the sedimentary matter has filled\r\nup a bay or gulf surrounded by steep mountains, a flat plain is formed\r\nskirting the inland precipices; and if these deposits are upraised,\r\nthey form a feature in the landscape very similar to the areas of\r\ndenudation before described.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Sicily I have examined many inland cliffs like those of\r\nthe Morea; as, for example, near Palermo, where a precipice is seen\r\nconsisting of limestone at the base of which are numerous caves. One of\r\nthese called San Ciro, about 2 miles distant from Palermo, is about 20 feet\r\nhigh, 10 wide, and 180 above the sea. Within it is found an ancient beach\r\n(_b_, fig. 93.), formed of pebbles of various rocks, many of which must\r\nhave come from places far remote. Broken pieces of coral and shell,\r\nespecially of oysters and pectens, are seen intermingled with the pebbles.\r\nImmediately above the level of this beach, _serpulae_ are still found\r\nadhering to the face of the rock, and the limestone is perforated by\r\n_lithodomi_. Within the grotto, also, at the same level, similar\r\nperforations occur; and so numerous are the holes, that the rock is\r\ncompared by Hoffmann to a target pierced by musket balls. But in order to\r\nexpose to view these marks of boring-shells in the interior of the cave, it\r\nwas necessary first to remove a mass of breccia, which consisted of\r\nnumerous fragments of rock and an immense quantity of bones of the mammoth,\r\nhippopotamus, and other quadrupeds, imbedded in a dark brown calcareous\r\nmarl. Many of the bones were rolled as if partially subjected to the action\r\nof the waves. Below this breccia, which is about 20 feet thick, was found a\r\nbed of sand filled with sea-shells of recent species; and underneath the\r\nsand, again, is the secondary limestone of Monte Grifone. The state of the\r\nsurface of the limestone in the cave above the level of the marine sand is\r\nvery different from that below it. _Above_, the rock is jagged and uneven,\r\nas is usual in the roofs and sides of limestone caverns; _below_, the\r\nsurface is smooth and polished, as if by the attrition of the waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93. Cross section.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Monte Grifone.\r\n  _b._ Cave of San Ciro.[75-A]\r\n  _c._ Plain of Palermo, in which are Newer Pliocene strata of\r\n       limestone and sand.\r\n  _d._ Bay of Palermo.]\r\n\r\nThe platform indicated at _c_, fig. 93., is formed by a tertiary deposit\r\ncontaining marine shells almost all of living species, and it affords an\r\nillustration of the terrace of deposition, or the last of the two kinds\r\nbefore mentioned (p. 74.).\r\n\r\nThere are also numerous instances in Sicily of terraces of denudation. One\r\nof these occurs on the east coast to the north of Syracuse, and the same is\r\nresumed to the south beyond the town of Noto, where it may be traced\r\nforming a continuous and lofty precipice, _a b_, fig. 94., facing towards\r\nthe sea, and constituting the abrupt termination of a calcareous formation,\r\nwhich extends in horizontal strata far inland. This precipice varies in\r\nheight from 500 to 700 feet, and between its base and the sea is an\r\ninferior platform, _c b_, consisting of similar white limestone. All the\r\nbeds dip towards the sea, but are usually inclined at a very slight angle:\r\nthey are seen to extend uninterruptedly from the base of the escarpment\r\ninto the platform, showing distinctly that the lofty cliff was not produced\r\nby a fault or vertical shift of the beds, but by the removal of a\r\nconsiderable mass of rock. Hence we may conclude that the sea, which is now\r\nundermining the cliffs of the Sicilian coast, reached at some former\r\nperiod the base of the precipice _a b_, at which time the surface of the\r\nterrace _c b_ must have been covered by the Mediterranean. There was a\r\npause, therefore, in the upward movement, when the waves of the sea had\r\ntime to carve out the platform _c b_; but there may have been many other\r\nstationary periods of minor duration. Suppose, for example, that a series\r\nof escarpments _e_, _f_, _g_, _h_, once existed, and that the sea, during a\r\nlong interval free from subterranean movements, advances along the line _c\r\nb_, all preceding cliffs must have been swept away one after the other, and\r\nreduced to the single precipice _a b_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94. Cross section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95. Valley called Gozzo degli Martiri, below\r\nMelilli, Val di Noto.]\r\n\r\nThat such a series of smaller cliffs, as those represented at _e_, _f_,\r\n_g_, _h_, fig. 94., did really once exist at intermediate heights in place\r\nof the single precipice _a b_, is rendered highly probable by the fact,\r\nthat in certain bays and inland valleys opening towards the east coast of\r\nSicily, and not far from the section given in fig. 94., the solid limestone\r\nis shaped out into a great succession of ledges, separated from each other\r\nby small vertical cliffs. These are sometimes so numerous, one above the\r\nother, that where there is a bend at the head of a valley, they produce an\r\neffect singularly resembling the seats of a Roman amphitheatre. A good\r\nexample of this configuration occurs near the town of Melilli, as seen in\r\nthe annexed view (fig. 95.). In the south of the island, near Spaccaforno,\r\nScicli, and Modica, precipitous rocks of white limestone, ascending to the\r\nheight of 500 feet, have been carved out into similar forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nThis appearance of a range of marble seats circling round the head of a\r\nvalley, or of great flights of steps descending from the top to the bottom,\r\non the opposite sides of a gorge, may be accounted for, as already hinted,\r\nby supposing the sea to have stood successively at many different levels,\r\nas at _a a_, _b b_, _c c_, in the accompanying fig. 96. But the causes of\r\nthe gradual contraction of the valley from above downwards may still be\r\nmatter of speculation. Such contraction may be due to the greater force\r\nexerted by the waves when the land at its first emergence was smaller in\r\nquantity, and more exposed to denudation in an open sea; whereas the wear\r\nand tear of the rocks might diminish in proportion as this action became\r\nconfined within bays or channels closed in on two or three sides. Or,\r\nsecondly, the separate movements of elevation may have followed each other\r\nmore rapidly as the land continued to rise, so that the times of those\r\npauses, during which the greatest denudation was accomplished at certain\r\nlevels, were always growing shorter. It should be remarked, that the cliffs\r\nand small terraces are rarely found on the opposite sides of the Sicilian\r\nvalleys at heights so precisely answering to each other as those given in\r\nfig. 96., and this might have been expected, to whichever of the two\r\nhypotheses above explained we incline; for, according to the direction of\r\nthe prevailing winds and currents, the waves may beat with unequal force on\r\ndifferent parts of the shore, so that while no impression is made on one\r\nside of a bay, the sea may encroach so far on the other as to unite several\r\nsmaller cliffs into one.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject of ancient sea-cliffs, carved out of\r\nlimestone, I shall mention the range of precipitous rocks, composed of a\r\nwhite marble of the Oolitic period, which I have seen near the northern\r\ngate of St. Mihiel in France. They are situated on the right bank of the\r\nMeuse, at a distance of 200 miles from the nearest sea, and they present\r\non the precipice facing the river three or four horizontal grooves, one\r\nabove the other, precisely resembling those which are scooped out by the\r\nundermining waves. The summits of several of these masses are detached\r\nfrom the adjoining hill, in which case the grooves pass all round them,\r\nfacing towards all points of the compass, as if they had once formed\r\nrocky islets near the shore.[78-A]\r\n\r\nCaptain Bayfield, in his survey of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, discovered in\r\nseveral places, especially in the Mingan islands, a counterpart of the\r\ninland cliffs of St. Mihiel, and traced a succession of shingle beaches,\r\none above the other, which agreed in their level with some of the principal\r\ngrooves scooped out of the limestone pillars. These beaches consisted of\r\ncalcareous shingle, with shells of recent species, the farthest from the\r\nshore being 60 feet above the level of the highest tides. In addition to\r\nthe drawings of the pillars called the flower-pots, which he has\r\npublished[78-B], I have been favoured with other views of rocks on the same\r\ncoast, drawn by Lieut. A. Bowen, R. N. (See fig. 97.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97. Limestone columns in Niapisca Island, in the Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence. Height of the second column on the left, 60 feet.]\r\n\r\nIn the North-American beaches above mentioned rounded fragments of\r\nlimestone have been found perforated by _lithodomi_; and holes drilled\r\nby the same mollusks have been detected in the columnar rocks or\r\n\"flower-pots,\" showing that there has been no great amount of\r\natmospheric decomposition on the surface, or the cavities alluded\r\nto would have disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98. The North Rocks, Bermuda, lying outside the\r\ngreat coral reef. A. 16 feet high, and B. 12 feet. _c._ _c._ Hollows\r\nworn by the sea.]\r\n\r\nWe have an opportunity of seeing in the Bermuda islands the manner in\r\nwhich the waves of the Atlantic have worn, and are now wearing out, deep\r\nsmooth hollows on every side of projecting masses of hard limestone. In the\r\nannexed drawing, communicated to me by Lieut. Nelson, the excavations _c_,\r\n_c_, _c_, have been scooped out by the waves in a stone of very modern\r\ndate, which, although extremely hard, is full of recent corals and shells,\r\nsome of which retain their colour.\r\n\r\nWhen the forms of these horizontal grooves, of which the surface is\r\nsometimes smooth and almost polished, and the roofs of which often overhang\r\nto the extent of 5 feet or more, have been carefully studied by geologists,\r\nthey will serve to testify the former action of the waves at innumerable\r\npoints far in the interior of the continents. But we must learn to\r\ndistinguish the indentations due to the original action of the sea, and\r\nthose caused by subsequent chemical decomposition of calcareous rocks, to\r\nwhich they are liable in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the enduring nature of the marks left by littoral action on\r\ncalcareous rocks, we can by no means detect sea-beaches and inland cliffs\r\neverywhere, even in Sicily and the Morea. On the contrary, they are, upon\r\nthe whole, extremely partial, and are often entirely wanting in districts\r\ncomposed of argillaceous and sandy formations, which must, nevertheless,\r\nhave been upheaved at the same time, and by the same intermittent\r\nmovements, as the adjoining calcareous rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[67-A] Western Islands, vol. ii. p. 93. pl. 31. fig. 4.\r\n\r\n[69-A] See Mammat's Geological Facts, &c. p. 90. and plate.\r\n\r\n[69-B] Conybeare's Report to Brit.

The term is\r\nderived from _alluvio_, an inundation, or _alluo_, to wash, because the\r\npebbles and sand commonly resemble those of a river's bed or the mud and\r\ngravel spread over low lands by a flood.\r\n\r\nA partial covering of such alluvium is found alike in all climates, from\r\nthe equatorial to the polar regions; but in the higher latitudes of Europe\r\nand North America it assumes a distinct character, being very frequently\r\ndevoid of stratification, and containing huge fragments of rock, some\r\nangular and others rounded, which have been transported to great distances\r\nfrom their parent mountains. When it presents itself in this form, it has\r\nbeen called \"diluvium,\" \"drift,\" or the \"boulder formation;\" and its\r\nprobable connexion with the agency of floating ice and glaciers will be\r\ntreated of more particularly in the eleventh and twelfth chapters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99. Lavas of Auvergne resting on alluviums of\r\ndifferent ages.]\r\n\r\nThe student will be prepared, by what I have said in the last chapter on\r\ndenudation, to hear that loose gravel and sand are often met with, not\r\nonly on the low grounds bordering rivers, but also at various points on\r\nthe sides or even summits of mountains. For, in the course of those\r\nchanges in physical geography which may take place during the gradual\r\nemergence of the bottom of the sea and its conversion into dry land, any\r\nspot may either have been a sunken reef, or a bay, or estuary, or\r\nsea-shore, or the bed of a river. For this reason it would be\r\nunreasonable to hope that we should ever be able to account for all the\r\nalluvial phenomena of each particular country, seeing that the causes of\r\ntheir origin are so complicated. Moreover, the last operations of water\r\nhave a tendency to disturb and confound together all pre-existing\r\nalluviums. Hence we are always in danger of regarding as the work of a\r\nsingle era, and the effect of one cause, what has in reality been the\r\nresult of a variety of distinct agents, during a long succession of\r\ngeological epochs. Much useful instruction may therefore be gained from\r\nthe exploration of a country like Auvergne, where the superficial gravel\r\nof very different eras happens to have been preserved by sheets of lava,\r\nwhich were poured out one after the other at periods when the\r\ndenudation, and probably the upheaval, of rocks were in progress. That\r\nregion had already acquired in some degree its present configuration\r\nbefore any volcanos were in activity, and before any igneous matter was\r\nsuperimposed upon the granitic and fossiliferous formations. The pebbles\r\ntherefore in the older gravels are exclusively constituted of granite\r\nand other aboriginal rocks; and afterwards, when volcanic vents burst\r\nforth into eruption, those earlier alluviums were covered by streams of\r\nlava, which protected them from intermixture with gravel of subsequent\r\ndate. In the course of ages, a new system of valleys was excavated, so\r\nthat the rivers ran at lower levels than those at which the first\r\nalluviums and sheets of lava were formed. When, therefore, fresh\r\neruptions gave rise to new lava, the melted matter was poured out over\r\nlower grounds; and the gravel of these plains differed from the first\r\nor upland alluvium, by containing in it rounded fragments of various\r\nvolcanic rocks, and often bones belonging to distinct groups of land\r\nanimals which flourished in the country in succession.\r\n\r\nThe annexed drawing will explain the different heights at which beds of\r\nlava and gravel, each distinct from the other in composition and age, are\r\nobserved, some on the flat tops of hills, 700 or 800 feet high, others on\r\nthe slope of the same hills, and the newest of all in the channel of the\r\nexisting river where there is usually gravel alone, but in some cases a\r\nnarrow stripe of solid lava sharing the bottom of the valley with the\r\nriver. In all these accumulations of transported matter of different ages\r\nthe bones of extinct quadrupeds have been found belonging to assemblages of\r\nland mammalia which flourished in the country in succession, and which vary\r\nspecifically, the one from the other, in a greater or less degree, in\r\nproportion as the time which separated their entombment has been more or\r\nless protracted. The streams in the same district are still undermining\r\ntheir banks and grinding down into pebbles or sand, columns of basalt and\r\nfragments of granite and gneiss; but the older alluviums, with the fossil\r\nremains belonging to them, are prevented from being mingled with the gravel\r\nof recent date by the cappings of lava before mentioned. But for the\r\naccidental interference, therefore, of this peculiar cause, all the\r\nalluviums might have passed so insensibly the one into the other, that\r\nthose formed at the remotest era might have appeared of the same date as\r\nthe newest, and the whole formation might have been regarded by some\r\ngeologists as the result of one sudden and violent catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIn almost every country, the alluvium consists in its upper part of\r\ntransported materials, but it often passes downwards into a mass of\r\nbroken and angular fragments derived from the subjacent rock. To this\r\nmass the provincial name of \"rubble,\" or \"brash,\" is given in many\r\nparts of England. It may be referred to the weathering or disintegration\r\nof stone on the spot, the effects of air and water, sun and frost,\r\nand chemical decomposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100. Cross section.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Vegetable soil.\r\n  _b._ Alluvium.\r\n  _c._ Mass of same, apparently detached.]\r\n\r\nThe inferior surface of alluvial deposits is often very irregular,\r\nconforming to all the inequalities of the fundamental rocks (fig. 100.).\r\nOccasionally, a small mass, as at _c_, appears detached, and as if included\r\nin the subjacent formation. Such isolated portions are usually sections of\r\nwinding subterranean hollows filled up with alluvium. They may have been\r\nthe courses of springs or subterranean streamlets, which have flowed\r\nthrough and enlarged natural rents; or, when on a small scale and in soft\r\nstrata, they may be spaces which the roots of large trees have once\r\noccupied, gravel and sand having been introduced after their decay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101. Sand-pipes in the chalk at Eaton, near Norwich.]\r\n\r\nBut there are other deep hollows of a cylindrical form found in England,\r\nFrance, and elsewhere, penetrating the white chalk, and filled with sand\r\nand gravel, which are not so readily explained. They are sometimes called\r\n\"sand-pipes,\" or \"sand-galls,\" and \"puits naturels,\" in France. Those\r\nrepresented in the annexed cut were observed by me in 1839, laid open in a\r\nlarge chalk-pit near Norwich. They were of very symmetrical form, the\r\nlargest more than 12 feet in diameter, and some of them had been traced, by\r\nboring, to the depth of more than 60 feet. The smaller ones varied from a\r\nfew inches to a foot in diameter, and seldom descended more than 12 feet\r\nbelow the surface. Even where three of them occurred, as at _a_, fig. 101.,\r\nvery close together, the parting walls of soft white chalk were not broken\r\nthrough. They all taper downwards and end in a point. As a general rule,\r\nsand and pebbles occupy the central parts of each pipe, while the sides and\r\nbottom are lined with clay.\r\n\r\nMr. Trimmer, in speaking of appearances of the same kind in the Kentish\r\nchalk, attributes the origin of such \"sand-galls\" to the action of the sea\r\non a beach or shoal, where the waves, charged with shingle and sand, not\r\nonly wear out longitudinal furrows, such as may be observed on the surface\r\nof the chalk near Norwich when the incumbent gravel is removed, but also\r\ndrill deep circular hollows by the rotatory motion imparted to sand and\r\npebbles. Such furrows, as well as vertical cavities, are now formed, he\r\nobserves, on the coast where the shores are composed of chalk.[82-A]\r\n\r\nThat the commencement of many of the tubular cavities now under\r\nconsideration has been due to the cause here assigned, I have little doubt.\r\nBut such mechanical action could not have hollowed out the whole of the\r\nsand-pipes _c_ and _d_, fig. 101., because several large chalk-flints seen\r\nprotruding from the walls of the pipes have not been eroded, while sand and\r\ngravel have penetrated many feet below them. In other cases, as at _b b_,\r\nsimilar unrounded nodules of flint, still preserving their irregular form\r\nand white coating, are found at various depths in the midst of the loose\r\nmaterials filling the pipe. These have evidently been detached from regular\r\nlayers of flints occurring above. It is also to be remarked that the course\r\nof the same sand-pipe, _b b_, is traceable above the level of the chalk for\r\nsome distance upwards, through the incumbent gravel and sand, by the\r\nobliteration of all signs of stratification. Occasionally, also, as in the\r\npipe _d_, the overlying beds of gravel bend downwards into the mouth of the\r\npipe, so as to become in part vertical, as would happen if horizontal\r\nlayers had sunk gradually in consequence of a failure of support. All these\r\nphenomena may be accounted for by attributing the enlargement and deepening\r\nof the sand-pipes to the chemical action of water charged with carbonic\r\nacid, derived from the vegetable soil and the decaying roots of trees. Such\r\nacid might corrode the chalk, and deepen indefinitely any previously\r\nexisting hollow, but could not dissolve the flints. The water, after it had\r\nbecome saturated with carbonate of lime, might freely percolate the\r\nsurrounding porous walls of chalk, and escape through them and from the\r\nbottom of the tube, so as to carry away in the course of time large masses\r\nof dissolved calcareous rock[83-A], and leave behind it on the edges of\r\neach tubular hollow a coating of fine clay, which the white chalk contains.\r\n\r\nI have seen tubes precisely similar and from 1 to 5 feet in diameter\r\ntraversing vertically the upper half of the soft calcareous building\r\nstone, or chalk without flints, constituting St. Peter's Mount,\r\nMaestricht. These hollows are filled with pebbles and clay, derived from\r\noverlying beds of gravel, and all terminate downwards like those of\r\nNorfolk. I was informed that, 6 miles from Maestricht, one of these\r\npipes, 2 feet in diameter, was traced downwards to a bed of flattened\r\nflints, forming an almost continuous layer in the chalk. Here it\r\nterminated abruptly, but a few small root-like prolongations of it were\r\ndetected immediately below, probably where the dissolving substance had\r\npenetrated at some points through openings in the siliceous mass.\r\n\r\nIt is not so easy as may at first appear to draw a clear line of\r\ndistinction between the _fixed_ rocks, or regular strata (rocks _in\r\nsitu_ or _in place_), and _alluvium_. If the bed of a torrent or river\r\nbe dried up, we call the gravel, sand, and mud left in their channels,\r\nor whatever, during floods, they may have scattered over the\r\nneighbouring plains, alluvium. The very same materials carried into a\r\nlake, where they become sorted by water and arranged in more distinct\r\nlayers, especially if they inclose the remains of plants, shells, or\r\nother fossils, are termed regular strata.\r\n\r\nIn like manner we may sometimes compare the gravel, sand, and broken\r\nshells, strewed along the path of a rapid marine current, with a deposit\r\nformed contemporaneously by the discharge of similar materials, year after\r\nyear, into a deeper and more tranquil part of the sea. In such cases, when\r\nwe detect marine shells or other organic remains entombed in the strata,\r\nwhich enable us to determine their age and mode of origin, we regard them\r\nas part of the regular series of fossiliferous formations, whereas, if\r\nthere are no fossils, we have frequently no power of separating them from\r\nthe general mass of superficial alluvium.\r\n\r\nThe usual rarity of organic remains in beds of loose gravel and sand is\r\npartly owing to the rapid and turbid water in which they were formed having\r\nbeen in a condition unfavourable to the habitation of aquatic beings, and\r\npartly to their porous nature, which, by allowing the free percolation of\r\nrain-water, has promoted the decomposition and removal of organic matter.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a matter of common observation that most rivers are now\r\ncutting their channels through alluvial deposits of greater depth and\r\nextent than could ever have been formed by the present streams. From this\r\nfact a rash inference has sometimes been drawn, that rivers in general have\r\ngrown smaller, or become less liable to be flooded than formerly. But such\r\nphenomena would be a natural result of any considerable oscillations in the\r\nlevel of the land experienced since the existing valleys originated.\r\n\r\nSuppose part of a continent, comprising within it a large hydrographical\r\nbasin like that of the Mississippi, to subside several inches or feet in\r\na century, as the west coast of Greenland, extending 600 miles north and\r\nsouth, has been sinking for three or four centuries, between the\r\nlatitudes 60 deg. and 69 deg. N.[84-A] There might be no encroachment of the sea\r\nat the river's mouth in consequence of this change of level, but the\r\nfall of the waters flowing from the interior being lessened, the main\r\nriver and its tributaries would have less power to carry down to its\r\ndelta, and to discharge into the ocean, the sedimentary matter with\r\nwhich they are annually loaded. They would all begin to raise their\r\nchannels and alluvial plains by depositing in them the heavier sand and\r\npebbles washed down from the upland country, and this operation would\r\ntake place most effectively if the amount of subsidence in the interior\r\nwas unequal, and especially if, on the whole, it exceeded that of the\r\nregion near the sea. If then the same area of land be again upheaved to\r\nits former height, the fall, and consequently the velocity, of every\r\nriver would begin to augment. Each of them would be less given to\r\noverflow its alluvial plain; and their power of carrying earthy matter\r\nseaward, and of scouring out and deepening their channels, would\r\ncontinue till, after a lapse of many thousand years, each of them would\r\nhave eroded a new channel or valley through a fluviatile formation of\r\nmodern date. The surface of what was once the river-plain at the period\r\nof greatest depression, would remain fringing the valley sides in the\r\nform of a terrace apparently flat, but in reality sloping down with the\r\ngeneral inclination of the river. Everywhere this terrace would present\r\ncliffs of gravel and sand, facing the river. That such a series of\r\nmovements has actually taken place in the main valley of the Mississippi\r\nand in its tributary valleys during oscillations of level, I have\r\nendeavoured to show in my description of that country[85-A]; and the\r\nfreshwater shells of existing species and bones of land quadrupeds,\r\npartly of extinct races preserved in the terraces of fluviatile origin,\r\nattest the exclusion of the sea during the whole process of filling up\r\nand partial re-excavation.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, the alluvium in which rivers are now cutting their channels,\r\noriginated when the land first rose out of the sea. If, for example, the\r\nemergence was caused by a gradual and uniform motion, every bay and\r\nestuary, or the straits between islands, would dry up slowly, and during\r\ntheir conversion into valleys, every part of the upheaved area would in its\r\nturn be a sea-shore, and might be strewed over with littoral sand and\r\npebbles, or each spot might be the point where a delta accumulated during\r\nthe retreat and exclusion of the sea. Materials so accumulated would\r\nconform to the general slope of a valley from its head to the sea-coast.\r\n\r\n_River terraces._--We often observe at a short distance from the present\r\nbed of a river a steep cliff a few feet or yards high, and on a level with\r\nthe top of it a flat terrace corresponding in appearance to the alluvial\r\nplain which immediately borders the river. This terrace is again bounded by\r\nanother cliff, above which a second terrace sometimes occurs: and in this\r\nmanner two or three ranges of cliffs and terraces are occasionally seen on\r\none or both sides of the stream, the number varying, but those on the\r\nopposite sides often corresponding in height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102. River Terraces and Parallel Roads.]\r\n\r\nThese terraces are seldom continuous for great distances, and their\r\nsurface slopes downwards, with an inclination similar to that of the\r\nriver. They are readily explained if we adopt the hypothesis before\r\nsuggested, of a gradual rise of the land; especially if, while rivers\r\nare shaping out their beds, the upheaving movement be intermittent, so\r\nthat long pauses shall occur, during which the stream will have time to\r\nencroach upon one of its banks, so as to clear away and flatten a large\r\nspace. This operation being afterwards repeated at lower levels, there\r\nwill be several successive cliffs and terraces.\r\n\r\n_Parallel roads._--The parallel shelves, or roads, as they have been\r\ncalled, of Lochaber or Glen Roy and other contiguous valleys in Scotland,\r\nare distinct both in character and origin from the terraces above\r\ndescribed; for they have no slope towards the sea like the channel of a\r\nriver, nor are they the effect of denudation. Glen Roy is situated in the\r\nwestern Highlands, about ten miles north of Fort William, near the western\r\nend of the great glen of Scotland, or Caledonian Canal, and near the foot\r\nof the highest of the Grampians, Ben Nevis. Throughout its whole length, a\r\ndistance of more than ten miles, two, and in its lower part three, parallel\r\nroads or shelves are traced along the steep sides of the mountains, as\r\nrepresented in the annexed figure, fig. 102., each maintaining a perfect\r\nhorizontality, and continuing at exactly the same level on the opposite\r\nsides of the glen. Seen at a distance, they appear like ledges or roads,\r\ncut artificially out of the sides of the hills; but when we are upon them\r\nwe can scarcely recognize their existence, so uneven is their surface, and\r\nso covered with boulders. They are from 10 to 60 feet broad, and merely\r\ndiffer from the side of the mountain by being somewhat less steep.\r\n\r\nOn closer inspection, we find that these terraces are stratified in the\r\nordinary manner of alluvial or littoral deposits, as may be seen at those\r\npoints where ravines have been excavated by torrents. The parallel shelves,\r\ntherefore, have not been caused by denudation, but by the deposition of\r\ndetritus, precisely similar to that which is dispersed in smaller\r\nquantities over the declivities of the hills above. These hills consist of\r\nclay-slate, mica-schist, and granite, which rocks have been worn away and\r\nlaid bare at a few points only, in a line just above the parallel roads.\r\nThe highest of these roads is about 1250 feet above the level of the sea,\r\nthe next about 200 feet lower than the uppermost, and the third still lower\r\nby about 50 feet. It is only this last, or the lowest of the three, which\r\nis continued throughout Glen Spean, a large valley with which Glen Roy\r\nunites. As the shelves are always at the same height above the sea, they\r\nbecome continually more elevated above the river in proportion as we\r\ndescend each valley; and they at length terminate very abruptly, without\r\nany obvious cause, either in the shape of the ground, or any change in the\r\ncomposition or hardness of the rocks. I should exceed the limits of this\r\nwork, were I to attempt to give a full description of all the geographical\r\ncircumstances attending these singular terraces, or to discuss the\r\ningenious theories which have been severally proposed to account for them\r\nby Dr. MacCulloch, Sir T. D. Lauder, and Messrs. Darwin, Agassiz, Milne,\r\nand Chambers. There is one point, however, on which all are agreed, namely,\r\nthat these shelves are ancient beaches, or littoral formations accumulated\r\nround the edges of one or more sheets of water which once stood at the\r\nlevel, first of the highest shelf, and successively at the height of the\r\ntwo others. It is well known, that wherever a lake or marine fiord exists\r\nsurrounded by steep mountains subject to disintegration by frost or the\r\naction of torrents, some loose matter is washed down annually, especially\r\nduring the melting of snow, and a check is given to the descent of this\r\ndetritus at the point where it reaches the waters of the lake. The waves\r\nthen spread out the materials along the shore, and throw some of them upon\r\nthe beach; their dispersing power being aided by the ice, which often\r\nadheres to pebbles during the winter months, and gives buoyancy to them.\r\nThe annexed diagram illustrates the manner in which Dr. MacCulloch and Mr.\r\nDarwin suppose \"the roads\" to constitute mere indentations in a superficial\r\nalluvial coating which rests upon the hillside, and consists chiefly of\r\nclay and sharp unrounded stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103. Cross section.\r\n\r\nA B. Supposed original surface of rock.\r\n\r\nC D. Roads or shelves in the outer alluvial covering of the hill.]\r\n\r\nAmong other proofs that the parallel roads have really been formed along\r\nthe margin of a sheet of water, it may be mentioned, that wherever an\r\nisolated hill rises in the middle of the glen above the level of any\r\nparticular shelf, a corresponding shelf is seen at the same level passing\r\nround the hill, as would have happened if it had once formed an island in a\r\nlake or fiord. Another very remarkable peculiarity in these terraces is\r\nthis; each of them comes in some portion of its course to a _col_, or\r\npassage between the heads of glens, the explanation of which will be\r\nconsidered in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThose writers who first advocated the doctrine that the roads were the\r\nancient beaches of freshwater lakes, were unable to offer any probable\r\nhypothesis respecting the formation and subsequent removal of barriers of\r\nsufficient height and solidity to dam up the water. To introduce any\r\nviolent convulsion for their removal was inconsistent with the\r\nuninterrupted horizontality of the roads, and with the undisturbed aspect\r\nof those parts of the glens where the shelves come suddenly to an end. Mr.\r\nAgassiz and Dr. Buckland, desirous, like the defenders of the lake theory,\r\nto account for the limitation of the shelves to certain glens, and their\r\nabsence in contiguous glens, where the rocks are of the same composition,\r\nand the slope and inclination of the ground very similar, started the\r\nconjecture that these valleys were once blocked up by enormous glaciers\r\ndescending from Ben Nevis, giving rise to what are called in Switzerland\r\nand in the Tyrol, glacier-lakes. After a time the icy barrier was broken\r\ndown, or melted, first, to the level of the second, and afterwards to that\r\nof the third road or shelf.\r\n\r\nIn corroboration of this view, they contended that the alluvium of Glen\r\nRoy, as well as of other parts of Scotland, agrees in character with the\r\nmoraines of glaciers seen in the Alpine valleys of Switzerland. Allusion\r\nwill be made in the eleventh chapter to the former existence of glaciers in\r\nthe Grampians: in the mean time it will readily be conceded that this\r\nhypothesis is preferable to any previous lacustrine theory, by accounting\r\nmore easily for the temporary existence and entire disappearance of lofty\r\ntransverse barriers, although the height required for the imaginary dams\r\nof ice may be startling.\r\n\r\nBefore the idea last alluded to had been entertained, Mr. Darwin examined\r\nGlen Roy, and came to the opinion that the shelves were formed when the\r\nglens were still arms of the sea, and, consequently, that there never were\r\nany barriers. According to him, the land emerged during a slow and uniform\r\nupward movement, like that now experienced throughout a large part of\r\nSweden and Finland; but there were certain pauses in the upheaving process,\r\nat which times the waters of the sea remained stationary for so many\r\ncenturies as to allow of the accumulation of an extraordinary quantity of\r\ndetrital matter, and the excavation, at points immediately above, of many\r\ndeep notches and bare cliffs in the hard and solid rock.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena which are most difficult to reconcile with this theory\r\nare, first, the abrupt cessation of the roads at certain points in the\r\ndifferent glens; secondly, their unequal number in different valleys\r\nconnecting with each other, there being three, for example, in Glen Roy\r\nand only one in Glen Spean; thirdly, the precise horizontality of level\r\nmaintained by the same shelf over a space many leagues in length\r\nrequiring us to assume, that during a rise of 1250 feet no one portion\r\nof the land was raised even a few yards above another; fourthly, the\r\ncoincidence of level already alluded to of each shelf with a _col_, or\r\nthe point forming the head of two glens, from which the rain-waters flow\r\nin opposite directions. This last-mentioned feature in the physical\r\ngeography of Lochaber seems to have been explained in a satisfactory\r\nmanner by Mr. Darwin. He calls these _cols_ \"landstraits,\" and regards\r\nthem as having been anciently sounds or channels between islands. He\r\npoints out that there is a tendency in such sounds to be silted up, and\r\nalways the more so in proportion to their narrowness. In a chart of the\r\nFalkland Islands by Capt. Sullivan, R.N., it appears that there are\r\nseveral examples there of straits where the soundings diminish regularly\r\ntowards the narrowest part. One is so nearly dry that it can be walked\r\nover at low water, and another, no longer covered by the sea, is\r\nsupposed to have recently dried up in consequence of a small shift in\r\nthe relative level of sea and land. \"Similar straits,\" observes Mr.\r\nChambers, \"hovering, in character, between sea and land, and which may\r\nbe called fords, are met with in the Hebrides. Such, for example, is the\r\npassage dividing the islands of Lewis and Harris, and that between North\r\nUist and Benbecula, both of which would undoubtedly appear as _cols_,\r\ncoinciding with a terrace or raised beach, all round the islands, if the\r\nsea were to subside.\"[88-A]\r\n\r\nThe precise horizontality of level maintained by the roads or shelves of\r\nLochaber over an area many leagues in length and breadth, is a\r\ndifficulty common in some degree to all the rival hypotheses, whether of\r\nlakes, or glaciers, or of the simple upheaval of the land above the sea.\r\nFor we cannot suppose the roads to be more ancient than the glacial\r\nperiod, or the era of the boulder formation of Scotland, of which I\r\nshall speak in the eleventh and twelfth chapters. Strata of that era of\r\nmarine origin containing northern shells of existing species have been\r\nfound at various heights in Scotland, some on the east, and others on\r\nthe west coast, from 20 to 400 feet high; and in one region in\r\nLanarkshire not less than 524 feet above high-water mark. It seems,\r\ntherefore, in the highest degree improbable that Glen Roy should have\r\nescaped entirely the upward movement experienced in so many surrounding\r\nregions,--a movement implied by the position of these marine deposits,\r\nin which the shells are almost all of known recent species. But if the\r\nmotion has really extended to Glen Roy and the contiguous glens, it must\r\nhave uplifted them bodily, without in the slightest degree affecting\r\ntheir horizontality; and this being admitted, the principal objection to\r\nthe theory of marine beaches, founded on the uniformity of upheaval, is\r\nremoved, or is at least common to every theory hitherto proposed.\r\n\r\nTo assume that the ocean has gone down from the level of the uppermost\r\nshelf, or 1250 feet, simultaneously all over the globe, while the land\r\nremained unmoved, is a view which will find favour with very few\r\ngeologists, for the reasons explained in the fifth chapter.\r\n\r\nThe student will perceive, from the above sketch of the controversy\r\nrespecting the formation of these curious shelves, that this problem, like\r\nmany others in geology, is as yet only solved in part; and that a larger\r\nnumber of facts must be collected and reasoned upon before the question\r\ncan be finally settled.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[82-A] Trimmer, Proceedings of Geol.

The preservation of the\r\nshelves may have required, says Darwin, the quick growth of green turf\r\non a good soil; their abrupt cessation may mark the place where the soil\r\nwas barren, and when a green sward formed slowly. In regard to the\r\naqueous rocks, we have already seen that they are stratified, that some\r\nare calcareous, others argillaceous or siliceous, some made up of sand,\r\nothers of pebbles; that some contain freshwater, others marine fossils,\r\nand so forth; but the student has still to learn which rocks, exhibiting\r\nsome or all of these characters, have originated at one period of the\r\nearth's history, and which at another.\r\n\r\nTo determine this point in reference to the fossiliferous formations is\r\nmore easy than in any other class, and it is therefore the most\r\nconvenient and natural method to begin by establishing a chronology for\r\nthese fossiliferous strata, and then to endeavour to refer to the same\r\ndivisions, the several groups of plutonic, volcanic, and metamorphic\r\nrocks. This system of classification is not only recommended by its\r\ngreater clearness and facility of application, but is also best fitted\r\nto strike the imagination by bringing into one view the past changes of\r\nthe inorganic world, and the contemporaneous revolutions of the organic\r\ncreation. For the sedimentary formations of successive periods are most\r\nreadily distinguished by the different species of fossil animals and\r\nplants which they inclose, and of which one race after another has\r\nflourished and then disappeared from the earth.\r\n\r\nBut before entering specially on the subdivisions of the aqueous rocks\r\narranged according to the order of time, it will be desirable to say a few\r\nwords on the chronology of rocks in general, although in doing so we shall\r\nbe unavoidably led to allude to some classes of phenomena which the\r\nbeginner must not yet expect fully to comprehend.\r\n\r\nIt was for many years a received opinion, that the formation of entire\r\nfamilies of rocks, such as the plutonic and those crystalline schists\r\nspoken of in the first chapter as metamorphic, began and ended before any\r\nmembers of the aqueous and volcanic orders were produced; and although this\r\nidea has long been modified, and is nearly exploded, it will be necessary\r\nto give some account of the ancient doctrine, in order that beginners may\r\nunderstand whence many prevailing opinions, and some part of the\r\nnomenclature of geology, still partially in use, was derived.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the last century, Lehman, a German miner, proposed to\r\ndivide rocks into three classes, the first and oldest to be called\r\nprimitive, comprising the hypogene, or plutonic and metamorphic rocks; the\r\nnext to be termed secondary, comprehending the aqueous or fossiliferous\r\nstrata; and the remainder, or third class, corresponding to our alluvium,\r\nancient and modern, which he referred to \"local floods, and the deluge of\r\nNoah.\" In the primitive class, he said, such as granite and gneiss, there\r\nare no organic remains, nor any signs of materials derived from the ruins\r\nof pre-existing rocks. Their origin, therefore, may have been purely\r\nchemical, antecedent to the creation of living beings, and probably coeval\r\nwith the birth of the world itself. The secondary formations, on the\r\ncontrary, which often contain sand, pebbles, and organic remains, must have\r\nbeen mechanical deposits, produced after the planet had become the\r\nhabitation of animals and plants. This bold generalization, although\r\nanticipated in some measure by Steno, a century before, in Italy, formed at\r\nthe time an important step in the progress of geology, and sketched out\r\ncorrectly some of the leading divisions into which rocks may be separated.\r\nAbout half a century later, Werner, so justly celebrated for his improved\r\nmethods of discriminating the mineralogical characters of rocks, attempted\r\nto improve Lehman's classification, and with this view intercalated a\r\nclass, called by him \"the transition formations,\" between the primitive and\r\nsecondary. Between these last he had discovered, in northern Germany, a\r\nseries of strata, which in their mineral peculiarities were of an\r\nintermediate character, partaking in some degree of the crystalline nature\r\nof micaceous schist and clay-slate, and yet exhibiting here and there signs\r\nof a mechanical origin and organic remains. For this group, therefore,\r\nforming a passage between Lehman's primitive and secondary rocks, the name\r\nof _uebergang_ or transition was proposed. They consisted principally of\r\nclay-slate and an argillaceous sandstone, called grauwacke, and partly of\r\ncalcareous beds. It happened in the district which Werner first\r\ninvestigated, that both the primitive and transition strata were highly\r\ninclined, while the beds of the newer fossiliferous rocks, the secondary of\r\nLehman, were horizontal. To these latter, therefore, he gave the name\r\n_floetz_, or \"a level floor;\" and every deposit more modern than the chalk,\r\nwhich was classed as the uppermost of the floetz series, was designated \"the\r\noverflowed land,\" an expression which may be regarded as equivalent to\r\nalluvium, although under this appellation were confounded all the strata\r\nafterwards called tertiary, of which Werner had scarcely any knowledge. As\r\nthe followers of Werner soon discovered that the inclined position of the\r\n\"transition beds,\" and the horizontality of the floetz, or newer\r\nfossiliferous strata, were mere local accidents, they soon abandoned the\r\nterm floetz; and the four divisions of the Wernerian school were then named\r\nprimitive, transition, secondary, and alluvial.\r\n\r\nAs to the trappean rocks, although their igneous origin had been already\r\ndemonstrated by Arduino, Fortis, Faujas, and others, and especially by\r\nDesmarest, they were all regarded by Werner as aqueous, and as mere\r\nsubordinate members of the secondary series.[91-A]\r\n\r\nThis theory of Werner's was called the \"Neptunian,\" and for many years\r\nenjoyed much popularity. It assumed that the globe had been at first\r\ninvested by an universal chaotic ocean, holding the materials of all rocks\r\nin solution. From the waters of this ocean, granite, gneiss, and other\r\ncrystalline formations, were first precipitated; and afterwards, when the\r\nwaters were purged of these ingredients, and more nearly resembled those of\r\nour actual seas, the transition strata were deposited. These were of a\r\nmixed character, not purely chemical, because the waves and currents had\r\nalready begun to wear down solid land, and to give rise to pebbles, sand,\r\nand mud; nor entirely without fossils, because a few of the first marine\r\nanimals had begun to exist. After this period, the secondary formations\r\nwere accumulated in waters resembling those of the present ocean, except at\r\ncertain intervals, when, from causes wholly unexplained, a partial\r\nrecurrence of the \"chaotic fluid\" took place, during which various trap\r\nrocks, some highly crystalline, were formed. This arbitrary hypothesis\r\nrejected all intervention of igneous agency, volcanos being regarded as\r\nmodern, partial, and superficial accidents, of trifling account among the\r\ngreat causes which have modified the external structure of the globe.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hutton, a contemporary of Werner, began to teach, in Scotland,\r\nthat granite as well as trap was of igneous origin, and had at various\r\nperiods intruded itself in a fluid state into different parts of the\r\nearth's crust. He recognized and faithfully described many of the\r\nphenomena of granitic veins, and the alterations produced by them on the\r\ninvaded strata, which will be treated of in the thirty-second chapter.\r\nHe, moreover, advanced the opinion, that the crystalline strata called\r\nprimitive had not been precipitated from a primaeval ocean, but were\r\nsedimentary strata altered by heat. In his writings, therefore, and in\r\nthose of his illustrator, Playfair, we find the germ of that metamorphic\r\ntheory which has been already hinted at in the first chapter, and\r\nwhich will be more fully expounded in the thirty-fourth and\r\nthirty-fifth chapters.\r\n\r\nAt length, after much controversy, the doctrine of the igneous origin of\r\ntrap and granite made its way into general favour; but although it was, in\r\nconsequence, admitted that both granite and trap had been produced at many\r\nsuccessive periods, the term primitive or primary still continued to be\r\napplied to the crystalline formations in general, whether stratified, like\r\ngneiss, or unstratified, like granite. The pupil was told that granite was\r\na primary rock, but that some granites were newer than certain secondary\r\nformations; and in conformity with the spirit of the ancient language, to\r\nwhich the teacher was still determined to adhere, a desire was naturally\r\nengendered of extenuating the importance of those more modern granites, the\r\ntrue dates of which new observations were continually bringing to light.\r\n\r\nA no less decided inclination was shown to persist in the use of the\r\nterm \"transition,\" after it had been proved to be almost as faulty in\r\nits original application as that of floetz. The name of transition, as\r\nalready stated, was first given by Werner, to designate a mineral\r\ncharacter, intermediate between the highly crystalline or metamorphic\r\nstate and that of an ordinary fossiliferous rock. But the term acquired\r\nalso from the first a chronological import, because it had been\r\nappropriated to sedimentary formations, which, in the Hartz and other\r\nparts of Germany, were more ancient than the oldest of the secondary\r\nseries, and were characterized by peculiar fossil zoophytes and shells.\r\nWhen, therefore, geologists found in other districts stratified rocks\r\noccupying the same position, and inclosing similar fossils, they gave to\r\nthem also the name of _transition_, according to rules which will be\r\nexplained in the next chapter; yet, in many cases, such rocks were found\r\nnot to exhibit the same mineral texture which Werner had called\r\ntransition. On the contrary, many of them were not more crystalline than\r\ndifferent members of the secondary class; while, on the other hand,\r\nthese last were sometimes found to assume a semi-crystalline and almost\r\nmetamorphic aspect, and thus, on lithological grounds, to deserve\r\nequally the name of transition. So remarkably was this the case in the\r\nSwiss Alps, that certain rocks, which had for years been regarded by\r\nsome of the most skilful disciples of Werner to be transition, were at\r\nlast acknowledged, when their relative position and fossils were better\r\nunderstood, to belong to the newest of the secondary groups; nay, some\r\nof them have actually been discovered to be members of the lower\r\ntertiary series! If, under such circumstances, the name of transition\r\nwas retained, it is clear that it ought to have been applied without\r\nreference to the age of strata, and simply as expressive of a mineral\r\npeculiarity. The continued appropriation of the term to formations of a\r\ngiven date, induced geologists to go on believing that the ancient\r\nstrata so designated bore a less resemblance to the secondary than is\r\nreally the case, and to imagine that these last never pass, as they\r\nfrequently do, into metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nThe poet Waller, when lamenting over the antiquated style of Chaucer,\r\ncomplains that--\r\n\r\n  We write in sand, our language grows,\r\n  And, like the tide, our work o'erflows.\r\n\r\nBut the reverse is true in geology; for here it is our work which\r\ncontinually outgrows the language. The tide of observation advances with\r\nsuch speed that improvements in theory outrun the changes of nomenclature;\r\nand the attempt to inculcate new truths by words invented to express a\r\ndifferent or opposite opinion, tends constantly, by the force of\r\nassociation, to perpetuate error; so that dogmas renounced by the reason\r\nstill retain a strong hold upon the imagination.\r\n\r\nIn order to reconcile the old chronological views with the new doctrine of\r\nthe igneous origin of granite, the following hypothesis was substituted for\r\nthat of the Neptunists. Instead of beginning with an aqueous menstruum or\r\nchaotic fluid, the materials of the present crust of the earth were\r\nsupposed to have been at first in a state of igneous fusion, until part of\r\nthe heat having been diffused into surrounding space, the surface of the\r\nfluid consolidated, and formed a crust of granite. This covering of\r\ncrystalline stone, which afterwards grew thicker and thicker as it cooled,\r\nwas so hot, at first, that no water could exist upon it; but as the\r\nrefrigeration proceeded, the aqueous vapour in the atmosphere was\r\ncondensed, and, falling in rain, gave rise to the first _thermal ocean_. So\r\nhigh was the temperature of this boiling sea, that no aquatic beings could\r\ninhabit its waters, and its deposits were not only devoid of fossils, but,\r\nlike those of some hot springs, were highly crystalline. Hence the origin\r\nof the primary or crystalline strata,--gneiss, mica-schist, and the rest.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when the granitic crust had been partially broken up, land\r\nand mountains began to rise above the waters, and rains and torrents\r\nground down rock, so that sediment was spread over the bottom of the\r\nseas. Yet the heat still remaining in the solid supporting substances\r\nwas sufficient to increase the chemical action exerted by the water,\r\nalthough not so intense as to prevent the introduction and increase of\r\nsome living beings. During this state of things some of the residuary\r\nmineral ingredients of the primaeval ocean were precipitated, and formed\r\ndeposits (the transition strata of Werner), half chemical and half\r\nmechanical, and containing a few fossils.\r\n\r\nBy this new theory, which was in part a revival of the doctrine of\r\nLeibnitz, published in 1680, on the igneous origin of the planet, the old\r\nideas respecting the priority of all crystalline rocks to the creation of\r\norganic beings, were still preserved; and the mistaken notion that all the\r\nsemi-crystalline and partially fossiliferous rocks belonged to one period,\r\nwhile all the earthy and uncrystalline formations originated at a\r\nsubsequent epoch, was also perpetuated.\r\n\r\nIt may or may not be true, as the great Leibnitz imagined, that the whole\r\nplanet was once in a state of liquefaction by heat; but there are certainly\r\nno geological proofs that the granite which constitutes the foundation of\r\nso much of the earth's crust was ever at once in a state of universal\r\nfusion. On the contrary, all our evidence tends to show that the formation\r\nof granite, like the deposition of the stratified rocks, has been\r\nsuccessive, and that different portions of granite have been in a melted\r\nstate at distinct and often distant periods. One mass was solid, and had\r\nbeen fractured, before another body of granitic matter was injected into\r\nit, or through it, in the form of veins. Some granites are more ancient\r\nthan any known fossiliferous rocks; others are of secondary; and some, such\r\nas that of Mont Blanc and part of the central axis of the Alps, of tertiary\r\norigin. In short, the universal fluidity of the crystalline foundations of\r\nthe earth's crust, can only be understood in the same sense as the\r\nuniversality of the ancient ocean. All the land has been under water, but\r\nnot all at one time; so all the subterranean unstratified rocks to which\r\nman can obtain access have been melted, but not simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIn the present work the four great classes of rocks, the aqueous, plutonic,\r\nvolcanic, and metamorphic, will form four parallel, or nearly parallel,\r\ncolumns in one chronological table. They will be considered as four sets of\r\nmonuments relating to four contemporaneous, or nearly contemporaneous,\r\nseries of events. I shall endeavour, in a subsequent chapter on the\r\nplutonic rocks, to explain the manner in which certain masses belonging to\r\neach of the four classes of rocks may have originated simultaneously at\r\nevery geological period, and how the earth's crust may have been\r\ncontinually remodelled, above and below, by aqueous and igneous causes,\r\nfrom times indefinitely remote. In the same manner as aqueous and\r\nfossiliferous strata are now formed in certain seas or lakes, while in\r\nother places volcanic rocks break out at the surface, and are connected\r\nwith reservoirs of melted matter at vast depths in the bowels of the\r\nearth,--so, at every era of the past, fossiliferous deposits and\r\nsuperficial igneous rocks were in progress contemporaneously with others of\r\nsubterranean and plutonic origin, and some sedimentary strata were exposed\r\nto heat and made to assume a crystalline or metamorphic structure.\r\n\r\nIt can by no means be taken for granted, that during all these changes the\r\nsolid crust of the earth has been increasing in thickness. It has been\r\nshown, that so far as aqueous action is concerned, the gain by fresh\r\ndeposits, and the loss by denudation, must at each period have been equal\r\n(see above, p. 68.); and in like manner, in the inferior portion of the\r\nearth's crust, the acquisition of new crystalline rocks, at each successive\r\nera, may merely have counter-balanced the loss sustained by the melting of\r\nmaterials previously consolidated. As to the relative antiquity of the\r\ncrystalline foundations of the earth's crust, when compared to the\r\nfossiliferous and volcanic rocks which they support, I have already stated,\r\nin the first chapter, that to pronounce an opinion on this matter is as\r\ndifficult as at once to decide which of the two, whether the foundations or\r\nsuperstructure of an ancient city built on wooden piles, may be the oldest.\r\nWe have seen that, to answer this question, we must first be prepared to\r\nsay whether the work of decay and restoration had gone on most rapidly\r\nabove or below, whether the average duration of the piles has exceeded that\r\nof the stone buildings, or the contrary. So also in regard to the relative\r\nage of the superior and inferior portions of the earth's crust; we cannot\r\nhazard even a conjecture on this point, until we know whether, upon an\r\naverage, the power of water above, or that of heat below, is most\r\nefficacious in giving new forms to solid matter.\r\n\r\nAfter the observations which have now been made, the reader will\r\nperceive that the term primary must either be entirely renounced, or, if\r\nretained, must be differently defined, and not made to designate a set\r\nof crystalline rocks, some of which are already ascertained to be newer\r\nthan all the secondary formations. In this work I shall follow most\r\nnearly the method proposed by Mr. Boue, who has called all\r\n_fossiliferous_ rocks older than the secondary by the name of primary.\r\nTo prevent confusion, however, I shall always speak of these, when they\r\nare of the aqueous class, as the _primary fossiliferous_ formations,\r\nbecause the word primary has hitherto been almost inseparably connected\r\nwith the idea of a non-fossiliferous rock.\r\n\r\nIf we can prove any plutonic, volcanic, or metamorphic rocks to be older\r\nthan the secondary formations, such rocks will also be primary, according\r\nto this system. Mr. Boue having with great propriety excluded the\r\nmetamorphic rocks, _as a class_, from the primary formations, proposed to\r\ncall them all \"crystalline schists.\"\r\n\r\nAs there are secondary fossiliferous strata, so we shall find that there\r\nare plutonic, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks of contemporaneous origin,\r\nwhich I shall also term secondary.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter it will be shown that the strata above the chalk have\r\nbeen called tertiary. If, therefore, we discover any volcanic, plutonic, or\r\nmetamorphic rocks, which have originated since the deposition of the chalk,\r\nthese also will rank as tertiary formations.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be suggested that some metamorphic strata, and some\r\ngranites, may be anterior in date to the oldest of the primary\r\nfossiliferous rocks. This opinion is doubtless true, and will be discussed\r\nin future chapters; but I may here observe, that when we arrange the four\r\nclasses of rocks in four parallel columns in one table of chronology, it is\r\nby no means assumed that these columns are all of equal length; one may\r\nbegin at an earlier period than the rest, and another may come down to a\r\nlater point of time. In the small part of the globe hitherto examined, it\r\nis hardly to be expected that we should have discovered either the oldest\r\nor the newest members of each of the four classes of rocks. Thus, if there\r\nbe primary, secondary, and tertiary rocks of the aqueous or fossiliferous\r\nclass, and in like manner primary, secondary, and tertiary hypogene\r\nformations, we may not be yet acquainted with the most ancient of the\r\nprimary fossiliferous beds, or with the newest of the hypogene.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[91-A] See Principles, vol. i. chap. iv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nON THE DIFFERENT AGES OF THE AQUEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\n   On the three principal tests of relative age--superposition, mineral\r\n   character, and fossils--Change of mineral character and fossils in the\r\n   same continuous formation--Proofs that distinct species of animals and\r\n   plants have lived at successive periods--Distinct provinces of\r\n   indigenous species--Great extent of single provinces--Similar laws\r\n   prevailed at successive geological periods--Relative importance of\r\n   mineral and palaeontological characters--Test of age by included\r\n   fragments--Frequent absence of strata of intervening\r\n   periods--Principal groups of strata in western Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I spoke generally of the chronological relations of the\r\nfour great classes of rocks, and I shall now treat of the aqueous rocks in\r\nparticular, or of the successive periods at which the different\r\nfossiliferous formations have been deposited.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal tests by which we determine the age of a given\r\nset of strata; first, superposition; secondly, mineral character; and,\r\nthirdly, organic remains. Some aid can occasionally be derived from a\r\nfourth kind of proof, namely, the fact of one deposit including in it\r\nfragments of a pre-existing rock, by which the relative ages of the two\r\nmay, even in the absence of all other evidence, be determined.\r\n\r\n_Superposition._--The first and principal test of the age of one aqueous\r\ndeposit, as compared to another, is relative position. It has been already\r\nstated, that where strata are horizontal, the bed which lies uppermost is\r\nthe newest of the whole, and that which lies at the bottom the most\r\nancient. So, of a series of sedimentary formations, they are like volumes\r\nof history, in which each writer has recorded the annals of his own times,\r\nand then laid down the book, with the last written page uppermost, upon the\r\nvolume in which the events of the era immediately preceding were\r\ncommemorated. In this manner a lofty pile of chronicles is at length\r\naccumulated; and they are so arranged as to indicate, by their position\r\nalone, the order in which the events recorded in them have occurred.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the crust of the earth, however, there are some regions where,\r\nas the student has already been informed, the beds have been disturbed, and\r\nsometimes extensively thrown over and turned upside down. (See pp. 58, 59.)\r\nBut an experienced geologist can rarely be deceived by these exceptional\r\ncases. When he finds that the strata are fractured, curved, inclined, or\r\nvertical, he knows that the original order of superposition must be\r\ndoubtful, and he then endeavours to find sections in some neighbouring\r\ndistrict where the strata are horizontal, or only slightly inclined. Here\r\nthe true order of sequence of the entire series of deposits being\r\nascertained, a key is furnished for settling the chronology of those strata\r\nwhere the displacement is extreme.\r\n\r\n_Mineral character._--The same rocks may often be observed to retain for\r\nmiles, or even hundreds of miles, the same mineral peculiarities, if we\r\nfollow the planes of stratification, or trace the beds, if they be\r\nundisturbed, in a horizontal direction. But if we pursue them vertically,\r\nor in any direction transverse to the planes of stratification, this\r\nuniformity ceases almost immediately. In that case we can scarcely ever\r\npenetrate a stratified mass for a few hundred yards without beholding a\r\nsuccession of extremely dissimilar, calcareous, argillaceous, and siliceous\r\nrocks. These phenomena lead to the conclusion, that rivers and currents\r\nhave dispersed the same sediment over wide areas at one period, but at\r\nsuccessive periods have been charged, in the same region, with very\r\ndifferent kinds of matter. The first observers were so astonished at the\r\nvast spaces over which they were able to follow the same homogeneous rocks\r\nin a horizontal direction, that they came hastily to the opinion, that the\r\nwhole globe had been environed by a succession of distinct aqueous\r\nformations, disposed round the nucleus of the planet, like the concentric\r\ncoats of an onion. But although, in fact, some formations may be continuous\r\nover districts as large as half of Europe, or even more, yet most of them\r\neither terminate wholly within narrower limits, or soon change their\r\nlithological character. Sometimes they thin out gradually, as if the supply\r\nof sediment had failed in that direction, or they come abruptly to an end,\r\nas if we had arrived at the borders of the ancient sea or lake which served\r\nas their receptacle. It no less frequently happens that they vary in\r\nmineral aspect and composition, as we pursue them horizontally. For\r\nexample, we trace a limestone for a hundred miles, until it becomes more\r\narenaceous, and finally passes into sand, or sandstone. We may then follow\r\nthis sandstone, already proved by its continuity to be of the same age,\r\nthroughout another district a hundred miles or more in length.\r\n\r\n_Organic remains._--This character must be used as a criterion of the\r\nage of a formation, or of the contemporaneous origin of two deposits\r\nin distant places, under very much the same restrictions as the test\r\nof mineral composition.\r\n\r\nFirst, the same fossils may be traced over wide regions, if we examine\r\nstrata in the direction of their planes, although by no means for\r\nindefinite distances.\r\n\r\nSecondly, while the same fossils prevail in a particular set of strata for\r\nhundreds of miles in a horizontal direction, we seldom meet with the same\r\nremains for many fathoms, and very rarely for several hundred yards, in a\r\nvertical line, or a line transverse to the strata. This fact has now been\r\nverified in almost all parts of the globe, and has led to a conviction,\r\nthat at successive periods of the past, the same area of land and water has\r\nbeen inhabited by species of animals and plants even more distinct than\r\nthose which now people the antipodes, or which now co-exist in the arctic,\r\ntemperate, and tropical zones. It appears, that from the remotest periods\r\nthere has been ever a coming in of new organic forms, and an extinction of\r\nthose which pre-existed on the earth; some species having endured for a\r\nlonger, others for a shorter, time; while none have ever reappeared after\r\nonce dying out. The law which has governed the creation and extinction of\r\nspecies seems to be expressed in the verse of the poet,--\r\n\r\n  Natura il fece, e poi ruppe la stampa.         ARIOSTO.\r\n  Nature made him, and then broke the die.\r\n\r\nAnd this circumstance it is, which confers on fossils their highest value\r\nas chronological tests, giving to each of them, in the eyes of the\r\ngeologist, that authority which belongs to contemporary medals in history.\r\n\r\nThe same cannot be said of each peculiar variety of rock; for some of\r\nthese, as red marl and red sandstone, for example, may occur at once at the\r\ntop, bottom, and middle of the entire sedimentary series; exhibiting in\r\neach position so perfect an identity of mineral aspect as to be\r\nundistinguishable. Such exact repetitions, however, of the same mixtures of\r\nsediment have not often been produced, at distant periods, in precisely the\r\nsame parts of the globe; and even where this has happened, we are seldom in\r\nany danger of confounding together the monuments of remote eras, when we\r\nhave studied their imbedded fossils and relative position.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked that the same species of organic remains cannot be traced\r\nhorizontally, or in the direction of the planes of stratification for\r\nindefinite distances. This might have been expected from analogy; for when\r\nwe inquire into the present distribution of living beings, we find that the\r\nhabitable surface of the sea and land may be divided into a considerable\r\nnumber of distinct provinces, each peopled by a peculiar assemblage of\r\nanimals and plants. In the Principles of Geology, I have endeavoured to\r\npoint out the extent and probable origin of these separate divisions; and\r\nit was shown that climate is only one of many causes on which they depend,\r\nand that difference of longitude as well as latitude is generally\r\naccompanied by a dissimilarity of indigenous species.\r\n\r\nAs different seas, therefore, and lakes are inhabited at the same period,\r\nby different aquatic animals and plants, and as the lands adjoining these\r\nmay be peopled by distinct terrestrial species, it follows that distinct\r\nfossils will be imbedded in contemporaneous deposits. If it were\r\notherwise--if the same species abounded in every climate, or in every part\r\nof the globe where, so far as we can discover, a corresponding temperature\r\nand other conditions favourable to their existence are found--the\r\nidentification of mineral masses of the same age, by means of their\r\nincluded organic contents, would be a matter of still greater certainty.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the extent of some single zoological provinces, especially\r\nthose of marine animals, is very great; and our geological researches have\r\nproved that the same laws prevailed at remote periods; for the fossils are\r\noften identical throughout wide spaces, and in a great number of detached\r\ndeposits, in which the mineral nature of the rocks is variable.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine here laid down will be more readily understood, if we\r\nreflect on what is now going on in the Mediterranean. That entire sea\r\nmay be considered as one zoological province; for, although certain\r\nspecies of testacea and zoophytes may be very local, and each region has\r\nprobably some species peculiar to it, still a considerable number are\r\ncommon to the whole Mediterranean. If, therefore, at some future period,\r\nthe bed of this inland sea should be converted into land, the geologist\r\nmight be enabled, by reference to organic remains, to prove the\r\ncontemporaneous origin of various mineral masses scattered over a space\r\nequal in area to the half of Europe.\r\n\r\nDeposits, for example, are well known to be now in progress in this sea in\r\nthe deltas of the Po, Rhone, Nile, and other rivers, which differ as\r\ngreatly from each other in the nature of their sediment as does the\r\ncomposition of the mountains which they drain. There are also other\r\nquarters of the Mediterranean, as off the coast of Campania, or near the\r\nbase of Etna, in Sicily, or in the Grecian Archipelago, where another class\r\nof rocks is now forming; where showers of volcanic ashes occasionally fall\r\ninto the sea, and streams of lava overflow its bottom; and where, in the\r\nintervals between volcanic eruptions, beds of sand and clay are frequently\r\nderived from the waste of cliffs, or the turbid waters of rivers.\r\nLimestones, moreover, such as the Italian travertins, are here and there\r\nprecipitated from the waters of mineral springs, some of which rise up from\r\nthe bottom of the sea. In all these detached formations, so diversified in\r\ntheir lithological characters, the remains of the same shells, corals,\r\ncrustacea, and fish are becoming inclosed; or, at least, a sufficient\r\nnumber must be common to the different localities to enable the zoologist\r\nto refer them all to one contemporaneous assemblage of species.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain combinations of geographical circumstances\r\nwhich cause distinct provinces of animals and plants to be separated\r\nfrom each other by very narrow limits; and hence it must happen, that\r\nstrata will be sometimes formed in contiguous regions, differing widely\r\nboth in mineral contents and organic remains. Thus, for example, the\r\ntestacea, zoophytes, and fish of the Red Sea are, as a group, extremely\r\ndistinct from those inhabiting the adjoining parts of the Mediterranean,\r\nalthough the two seas are separated only by the narrow isthmus of Suez.\r\nOf the bivalve shells, according to Philippi, not more than a fifth are\r\ncommon to the Red Sea and the sea around Sicily, while the proportion of\r\nunivalves (or Gasteropoda) is still smaller, not exceeding eighteen in a\r\nhundred. Calcareous formations have accumulated on a great scale in the\r\nRed Sea in modern times, and fossil shells of existing species are well\r\npreserved therein; and we know that at the mouth of the Nile large\r\ndeposits of mud are amassed, including the remains of Mediterranean\r\nspecies. It follows, therefore, that if at some future period the bed of\r\nthe Red Sea should be laid dry, the geologist might experience great\r\ndifficulties in endeavouring to ascertain the relative age of these\r\nformations, which, although dissimilar both in organic and mineral\r\ncharacters, were of synchronous origin.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, we must not forget that the north-western shores of\r\nthe Arabian Gulf, the plains of Egypt, and the isthmus of Suez, are all\r\nparts of one province of _terrestrial_ species. Small streams, therefore,\r\noccasional land-floods, and those winds which drift clouds of sand along\r\nthe deserts, might carry down into the Red Sea the same shells of\r\nfluviatile and land testacea which the Nile is sweeping into its delta,\r\ntogether with some remains of terrestrial plants and the bones of\r\nquadrupeds, whereby the groups of strata, before alluded to, might,\r\nnotwithstanding the discrepancy of their mineral composition and _marine_\r\norganic fossils, be shown to have belonged to the same epoch.\r\n\r\nYet while rivers may thus carry down the same fluviatile and terrestrial\r\nspoils into two or more seas inhabited by different marine species, it\r\nwill much more frequently happen, that the co-existence of terrestrial\r\nspecies of distinct zoological and botanical provinces will be proved by\r\nthe identity of the marine beings which inhabited the intervening space.\r\nThus, for example, the land quadrupeds and shells of the south of\r\nEurope, north of Africa, and north-west of Asia, are different, yet\r\ntheir remains are all washed down by rivers flowing from these three\r\ncountries into the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the globe, at the present period, the line of demarcation\r\nbetween distinct provinces of animals and plants is not very strongly\r\nmarked, especially where the change is determined by temperature, as in\r\nseas extending from the temperate to the tropical zone, or from the\r\ntemperate to the arctic regions. Here a gradual passage takes place from\r\none set of species to another. In like manner the geologist, in studying\r\nparticular formations of remote periods, has sometimes been able to trace\r\nthe gradation from one ancient province to another, by observing carefully\r\nthe fossils of all the intermediate places. His success in thus acquiring a\r\nknowledge of the zoological or botanical geography of very distant eras\r\nhas been mainly owing to this circumstance, that the mineral character has\r\nno tendency to be affected by climate. A large river may convey yellow or\r\nred mud into some part of the ocean, where it may be dispersed by a current\r\nover an area several hundred leagues in length, so as to pass from the\r\ntropics into the temperate zone. If the bottom of the sea be afterwards\r\nupraised, the organic remains imbedded in such yellow or red strata may\r\nindicate the different animals or plants which once inhabited at the same\r\ntime the temperate and equatorial regions.\r\n\r\nIt may be true, as a general rule, that groups of the same species of\r\nanimals and plants may extend over wider areas than deposits of homogeneous\r\ncomposition; and if so, palaeontological characters will be of more\r\nimportance in geological classification than mineral composition; but it is\r\nidle to discuss the relative value of these tests, as the aid of both is\r\nindispensable, and it fortunately happens, that where the one criterion\r\nfails, we can often avail ourselves of the other.\r\n\r\n_Test by included fragments of older rocks._--It was stated, that\r\nindependent proof may sometimes be obtained of the relative date of two\r\nformations, by fragments of an older rock being included in a newer one.\r\nThis evidence may sometimes be of great use, where a geologist is at a\r\nloss to determine the relative age of two formations from want of clear\r\nsections exhibiting their true order of position, or because the strata\r\nof each group are vertical. In such cases we sometimes discover that the\r\nmore modern rock has been in part derived from the degradation of the\r\nolder. Thus, for example, we may find in one part of a country chalk\r\nwith flints; and, in another, a distinct formation, consisting of\r\nalternations of clay, sand, and pebbles. If some of these pebbles\r\nconsist of similar flint and fossil shells, sponges, and foraminiferae,\r\nof the same species as those in the chalk, we may confidently infer that\r\nthe chalk is the oldest of the two formations.\r\n\r\n_Chronological groups._--The number of groups into which the\r\nfossiliferous strata may be separated are more or less numerous,\r\naccording to the views of classification which different geologists\r\nentertain; but when we have adopted a certain system of arrangement, we\r\nimmediately find that a few only of the entire series of groups occur\r\none upon the other in any single section or district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104. Block section.]\r\n\r\nThe thinning out of individual strata was before described (p. 16.). But\r\nlet the annexed diagram represent seven fossiliferous groups, instead of\r\nas many strata. It will then be seen that in the middle all the\r\nsuperimposed formations are present; but in consequence of some of them\r\nthinning out, No. 2. and No. 5. are absent at one extremity of the\r\nsection, and No. 4. at the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.

Here at the southern end of the line of section we\r\nmeet with the beds No. 3. (the New Red Sandstone) resting immediately on\r\nNo. 6., while farther north, as at Dundry Hill, we behold six groups\r\nsuperimposed one upon the other, comprising all the strata from the\r\ninferior oolite to the coal and carboniferous limestone. The limited\r\nextension of the groups 1 and 2. is owing to denudation, as these\r\nformations end abruptly, and have left outlying patches to attest the\r\nfact of their having originally covered a much wider area.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, however, the entire absence of one or more formations of\r\nintervening periods between two groups, such as 3. and 5. in the same\r\nsection, arises, not from the destruction of what once existed, but because\r\nno strata of an intermediate age were ever deposited on the inferior rock.\r\nThey were not formed at that place, either because the region was dry land\r\nduring the interval, or because it was part of a sea or lake to which no\r\nsediment was carried.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to establish a chronological succession of\r\nfossiliferous groups, a geologist must begin with a single section, in\r\nwhich several sets of strata lie one upon the other. He must then trace\r\nthese formations, by attention to their mineral character and fossils,\r\ncontinuously, as far as possible, from the starting point. As often as he\r\nmeets with new groups, he must ascertain by superposition their age\r\nrelatively to those first examined, and thus learn how to intercalate them\r\nin a tabular arrangement of the whole.\r\n\r\nBy this means the German, French, and English geologists have determined\r\nthe succession of strata throughout a great part of Europe, and have\r\nadopted pretty generally the following groups, almost all of which have\r\ntheir representatives in the British Islands.\r\n\r\n_Groups of Fossiliferous Strata observed in Western Europe, arranged in\r\nwhat is termed a descending Series, or beginning with the newest._ (_See a\r\nmore detailed Tabular view_, pp. 360. 365.)\r\n\r\n  1.

But we can assert that\r\nthey each relate to successive periods, during which certain animals and\r\nplants, for the most part peculiar to their respective eras, have\r\nflourished, and during which different kinds of sediment were deposited in\r\nthe space now occupied by Europe.\r\n\r\nIf we were disposed, on palaeontological grounds[103-C], to divide the\r\nentire fossiliferous series into a few groups less numerous than those in\r\nthe above table, and more nearly co-ordinate in value than the sections\r\ncalled primary, secondary, and tertiary, we might, perhaps, adopt the six\r\ngroups or periods given in the next table (p. 104.).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I may observe, that, in the present state of the\r\nscience, when we have not yet compared the evidence derivable from all\r\nclasses of fossils, not even those most generally distributed, such as\r\nshells, corals, and fish, such generalizations are premature, and can\r\nonly be regarded as conjectural or provisional schemes for the founding\r\nof large natural groups.\r\n\r\n_Fossiliferous Strata of Western Europe divided into Six Groups._\r\n\r\n  1.

These tertiary strata were at first confounded, as before\r\nstated, p. 91., with the superficial alluviums of Europe; and it was long\r\nbefore their real extent and thickness, and the various ages to which they\r\nbelong, were fully recognized. They were observed to occur in patches, some\r\nof freshwater, others of marine origin, their geographical area being\r\nusually small as compared to the secondary formations, and their position\r\noften suggesting the idea of their having been deposited in different bays,\r\nlakes, estuaries, or inland seas, after a large portion of the space now\r\noccupied by Europe had already been converted into dry land.\r\n\r\nThe first deposits of this class, of which the characters were accurately\r\ndetermined, were those occurring in the neighbourhood of Paris, described\r\nin 1810 by MM. Cuvier and Brongniart. They were ascertained to consist of\r\nsuccessive sets of strata, some of marine, others of freshwater origin,\r\nlying one upon the other. The fossil shells and corals were perceived to be\r\nalmost all of unknown species, and to have in general a near affinity to\r\nthose now inhabiting warmer seas. The bones and skeletons of land animals,\r\nsome of them of large size, and belonging to more than forty distinct\r\nspecies, were examined by Cuvier, and declared by him not to agree\r\nspecifically and for the most part not even generically, with any hitherto\r\nobserved in the living creation.\r\n\r\nStrata were soon afterwards brought to light in the vicinity of London, and\r\nin Hampshire, which, although dissimilar in mineral composition, were\r\njustly inferred by Mr. T. Webster to be of the same age as those of Paris,\r\nbecause the greater number of the fossil shells were specifically\r\nidentical. For the same reason rocks found on the Gironde, in the South of\r\nFrance, and at certain points in the North of Italy, were suspected to be\r\nof contemporaneous origin.\r\n\r\nA variety of deposits were afterwards found in other parts of Europe, all\r\nreposing immediately on rocks as old or older than the chalk, and which\r\nexhibited certain general characters of resemblance in their organic\r\nremains to those previously observed near Paris and London. An attempt was\r\ntherefore made at first to refer the whole to one period; and when at\r\nlength this seemed impracticable, it was contended that as in the Parisian\r\nseries there were many subordinate formations of considerable thickness\r\nwhich must have accumulated one after the other, during a great lapse of\r\ntime, so the various patches of tertiary strata scattered over Europe might\r\ncorrespond in age, some of them to the older, and others to the newer,\r\nsubdivisions of the Parisian series.\r\n\r\nThis error, although most unavoidable on the part of those who made the\r\nfirst generalizations in this branch of geology, retarded seriously for\r\nsome years the progress of classification. A more scrupulous attention to\r\nspecific distinctions, aided by a careful regard to the relative position\r\nof the strata containing them, led at length to the conviction that there\r\nwere formations both marine and freshwater of various ages, and all newer\r\nthan the strata of the neighbourhood of Paris and London.\r\n\r\nOne of the first steps in this chronological reform was made in 1811, by\r\nan English naturalist, Mr. Parkinson, who pointed out the fact that\r\ncertain shelly strata, provincially termed \"Crag\" in Suffolk, lay\r\ndecidedly over a deposit which was the continuation of the blue clay of\r\nLondon. At the same time he remarked that the fossil testacea in these\r\nnewer beds were distinct from those of the blue clay, and that while\r\nsome of them were of unknown species, others were identical with species\r\nnow inhabiting the British seas.\r\n\r\nAnother important discovery was soon afterwards made by Brocchi in Italy,\r\nwho investigated the argillaceous and sandy deposits replete with shells\r\nwhich form a low range of hills, flanking the Apennines on both sides, from\r\nthe plains of the Po to Calabria. These lower hills were called by him the\r\nSubapennines, and were formed of strata of different ages, all newer than\r\nthose of Paris and London.\r\n\r\nAnother tertiary group occurring in the neighbourhood of Bordeaux and Dax,\r\nin the south of France, was examined by M. de Basterot in 1825, who\r\ndescribed and figured several hundred species of shells, which differed for\r\nthe most part both from the Parisian series and those of the Subapennine\r\nhills. It was soon, therefore, suspected that this fauna might belong to a\r\nperiod intermediate between that of the Parisian and Subapennine strata,\r\nand it was not long before the evidence of superposition was brought to\r\nbear in support of this opinion; for other strata, contemporaneous with\r\nthose of Bordeaux, were observed in one district (the Valley of the Loire),\r\nto overlie the Parisian formation, and in another (in Piedmont) to underlie\r\nthe Subapennine beds. The first example of these was pointed out in 1829 by\r\nM. Desnoyers, who ascertained that the sand and marl of marine origin\r\ncalled Faluns, near Tours, in the basin of the Loire, full of sea-shells\r\nand corals, rested upon a lacustrine formation, which constitutes the\r\nuppermost subdivision of the Parisian group, extending continuously\r\nthroughout a great table-land intervening between the basin of the Seine\r\nand that of the Loire. The other example occurs in Italy, where strata,\r\ncontaining many fossils similar to those of Bordeaux, were observed by\r\nBonelli and others in the environs of Turin, subjacent to strata belonging\r\nto the Subapennine group of Brocchi.\r\n\r\nWithout pretending to give a complete sketch of the progress of\r\ndiscovery, I may refer to the facts above enumerated, as illustrating\r\nthe course usually pursued by geologists when they attempt to found new\r\nchronological divisions. The method bears some analogy to that pursued\r\nby the naturalist in the construction of genera, when he selects a\r\ntypical species, and then classes as congeners all other species of\r\nanimals and plants which agree with this standard within certain limits.\r\nThe genera A. and C. having been founded on these principles, a new\r\nspecies is afterwards met with, departing widely both from A. and C.,\r\nbut in many respects of an intermediate character. For this new type it\r\nbecomes necessary to institute the new genus B., in which are included\r\nall species afterwards brought to light, which agree more nearly with B.\r\nthan with the types of A. or C. In like manner a new formation is met\r\nwith in geology, and the characters of its fossil fauna and flora\r\ninvestigated. From that moment it is considered as a record of a certain\r\nperiod of the earth's history, and a standard to which other deposits\r\nmay be compared. If any are found containing the same or nearly the same\r\norganic remains, and occupying the same relative position, they are\r\nregarded in the light of contemporary annals. All such monuments are\r\nsaid to relate to one period, during which certain events occurred, such\r\nas the formation of particular rocks by aqueous or volcanic agency, or\r\nthe continued existence and fossilization of certain tribes of animals\r\nand plants. When several of these periods have had their true places\r\nassigned to them in a chronological series, others are discovered\r\nwhich it becomes necessary to intercalate between those first known;\r\nand the difficulty of assigning clear lines of separation must\r\nunavoidably increase in proportion as chasms in the past history of\r\nthe globe are filled up.\r\n\r\nEvery zoologist and botanist is aware that it is a comparatively easy\r\ntask to establish genera in departments which have been enriched with\r\nonly a small number of species, and where there is as yet no tendency in\r\none set of characters to pass almost insensibly, by a multitude of\r\nconnecting links, into another. They also know that the difficulty of\r\nclassification augments, and that the artificial nature of their\r\ndivisions becomes more apparent, in proportion to the increased number\r\nof objects brought to light. But in separating families and genera, they\r\nhave no other alternative than to avail themselves of such breaks as\r\nstill remain, or of every hiatus in the chain of animated beings which\r\nis not yet filled up. So in geology, we may be eventually compelled to\r\nresort to sections of time as arbitrary, and as purely conventional, as\r\nthose which divide the history of human events into centuries. But in\r\nthe present state of our knowledge, it is more convenient to use the\r\ninterruptions which still occur in the regular sequence of geological\r\nmonuments, as boundary lines between our principal groups or periods,\r\neven though the groups thus established are of very unequal value.\r\n\r\nThe isolated position of distinct tertiary deposits in different parts\r\nof Europe has been already alluded to. In addition to the difficulty\r\npresented by this want of continuity when we endeavour to settle the\r\nchronological relations of these deposits, another arises from the\r\nfrequent dissimilarity in mineral character of strata of contemporaneous\r\ndate, such, for example, as those of London and Paris before mentioned.\r\nThe identity or non-identity of species is also a criterion which often\r\nfails us. For this we might have been prepared, for we have already\r\nseen, that the Mediterranean and Red Sea, although within 70 miles of\r\neach other, on each side of the Isthmus of Suez, have each their\r\npeculiar fauna; and a marked difference is found in the four groups of\r\ntestacea now living in the Baltic, English Channel, Black Sea, and\r\nMediterranean, although all these seas have many species in common. In\r\nlike manner a considerable diversity in the fossils of different\r\ntertiary formations, which have been thrown down in distinct seas,\r\nestuaries, bays, and lakes, does not always imply a distinctness in the\r\ntimes when they were produced, but may have arisen from climate and\r\nconditions of physical geography wholly independent of time. On the\r\nother hand, it is now abundantly clear, as the result of geological\r\ninvestigation, that different sets of tertiary strata, immediately\r\nsuperimposed upon each other, contain distinct imbedded species of\r\nfossils, in consequence of fluctuations which have been going on in the\r\nanimate creation, and by which in the course of ages one state of things\r\nin the organic world has been substituted for another wholly dissimilar.\r\nIt has also been shown that in proportion as the age of a tertiary\r\ndeposit is more modern, so is its fauna more analogous to that now in\r\nbeing in the neighbouring seas. It is this law of a nearer agreement of\r\nthe fossil testacea with the species now living, which may often furnish\r\nus with a clue for the chronological arrangement of scattered deposits,\r\nwhere we cannot avail ourselves of any one of the three ordinary\r\nchronological tests; namely, superposition, mineral character, and the\r\nspecific identity of the fossils.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, on the African border of the Red Sea, at the height\r\nof 40 feet, and sometimes more, above its level, a white calcareous\r\nformation has been observed, containing several hundred species of\r\nshells differing from those found in the clay and volcanic tuff of the\r\ncountry round Naples, and of the contiguous island of Ischia. Another\r\ndeposit has been found at Uddevalla, in Sweden, in which the shells do\r\nnot agree with those found near Naples. But although in these three\r\ncases there may be scarcely a single shell common to the three different\r\ndeposits, we do not hesitate to refer them all to one period (the\r\nPost-Pliocene), because of the very close agreement of the fossil\r\nspecies in every instance with those now living in the contiguous seas.\r\n\r\nTo take another example, where the fossil fauna recedes a few steps farther\r\nback from our own times. We may compare, first, the beds of loam and clay\r\nbordering the Clyde in Scotland (called glacial by some geologists),\r\nsecondly, others of fluvio-marine origin near Norwich, and, lastly, a third\r\nset often rising to considerable heights in Sicily, and we discover that in\r\nevery case more than three-fourths of the shells agree with species still\r\nliving, while the remainder are extinct. Hence we may conclude that all\r\nthese, greatly diversified as are their organic remains, belong to one and\r\nthe same era, or to a period immediately antecedent to the Post-Pliocene,\r\nbecause there has been time in each of the areas alluded to for an equal or\r\nnearly equal amount of change in the marine testaceous fauna.\r\nContemporaneousness of origin is inferred in these cases, in spite of the\r\nmost marked differences of mineral character or organic contents, from a\r\nsimilar degree of divergence in the shells from those now living in the\r\nadjoining seas. The advantage of such a test consists in supplying us with\r\na common point of departure in all countries, however remote.\r\n\r\nBut the farther we recede from the present times, and the smaller the\r\nrelative number of recent as compared with extinct species in the\r\ntertiary deposits, the less confidence can we place in the exact value\r\nof such a test, especially when comparing the strata of very distant\r\nregions; for we cannot presume that the rate of former alterations in\r\nthe animate world, or the continual going out and coming in of species,\r\nhas been every where exactly equal in equal quantities of time. The\r\nform of the land and sea, and the climate, may have changed more in\r\none region than in another; and consequently there may have been a\r\nmore rapid destruction and renovation of species in one part of the\r\nglobe than elsewhere. Considerations of this kind should undoubtedly\r\nput us on our guard against relying too implicitly on the accuracy of\r\nthis test; yet it can never fail to throw great light on the\r\nchronological relations of tertiary groups with each other, and with\r\nthe Post-Pliocene period.\r\n\r\nWe may derive a conviction of this truth not only from a study of\r\ngeological monuments of all ages, but also by reflecting on the tendency\r\nwhich prevails in the present state of nature to a uniform rate of\r\nsimultaneous fluctuation in the flora and fauna of the whole globe. The\r\ngrounds of such a doctrine cannot be discussed here, and I have explained\r\nthem at some length in the third Book of the Principles of Geology, where\r\nthe causes of the successive extinction of species are considered. It will\r\nbe there seen that each local change in climate and physical geography is\r\nattended with the immediate increase of certain species, and the limitation\r\nof the range of others. A revolution thus effected is rarely, if ever,\r\nconfined to a limited space, or to one geographical province of animals or\r\nplants, but affects several other surrounding and contiguous provinces. In\r\neach of these, moreover, analogous alterations of the stations and\r\nhabitations of species are simultaneously in progress, reacting in the\r\nmanner already alluded to on the first province. Hence, long before the\r\ngeography of any particular district can be essentially altered, the flora\r\nand fauna throughout the world will have been materially modified by\r\ncountless disturbances in the mutual relation of the various members of the\r\norganic creation to each other. To assume that in one large area inhabited\r\nexclusively by a single assemblage of species any important revolution in\r\nphysical geography can be brought about, while other areas remain\r\nstationary in regard to the position of land and sea, the height of\r\nmountains, and so forth, is a most improbable hypothesis, wholly opposed to\r\nwhat we know of the laws now governing the aqueous and igneous causes. On\r\nthe other hand, even were this conceivable, the communication of heat and\r\ncold between different parts of the atmosphere and ocean is so free and\r\nrapid, that the temperature of certain zones cannot be materially raised or\r\nlowered without others being immediately affected; and the elevation or\r\ndiminution in height of an important chain of mountains or the submergence\r\nof a wide tract of land would modify the climate even of the antipodes.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in the foregoing allusions to organic remains, the\r\ntestacea or the shell-bearing mollusca are selected as the most useful and\r\nconvenient class for the purposes of general classification. In the first\r\nplace, they are more universally distributed through strata of every age\r\nthan any other organic bodies. Those families of fossils which are of rare\r\nand casual occurrence are absolutely of no avail in establishing a\r\nchronological arrangement. If we have plants alone in one group of strata\r\nand the bones of mammalia in another, we can draw no conclusion respecting\r\nthe affinity or discordance of the organic beings of the two epochs\r\ncompared; and the same may be said if we have plants and vertebrated\r\nanimals in one series and only shells in another. Although corals are more\r\nabundant, in a fossil state, than plants, reptiles, or fish, they are still\r\nrare when contrasted with shells, especially in the European tertiary\r\nformations. The utility of the testacea is, moreover, enhanced by the\r\ncircumstance that some forms are proper to the sea, others to the land, and\r\nothers to freshwater. Rivers scarcely ever fail to carry down into their\r\ndeltas some land shells, together with species which are at once fluviatile\r\nand lacustrine. By this means we learn what terrestrial, freshwater, and\r\nmarine species co-existed at particular eras of the past; and having thus\r\nidentified strata formed in seas with others which originated\r\ncontemporaneously in inland lakes, we are then enabled to advance a step\r\nfarther, and show that certain quadrupeds or aquatic plants, found fossil\r\nin lacustrine formations, inhabited the globe at the same period when\r\ncertain fish, reptiles, and zoophytes lived in the ocean.\r\n\r\nAmong other characters of the molluscous animals, which render them\r\nextremely valuable in settling chronological questions in geology, may be\r\nmentioned, first, the wide geographical range of many species; and,\r\nsecondly, what is probably a consequence of the former, the great duration\r\nof species in this class, for they appear to have surpassed in longevity\r\nthe greater number of the mammalia and fish. Had each species inhabited a\r\nvery limited space, it could never, when imbedded in strata, have enabled\r\nthe geologist to identify deposits at distant points; or had they each\r\nlasted but for a brief period, they could have thrown no light on the\r\nconnection of rocks placed far from each other in the chronological, or, as\r\nit is often termed, vertical series.\r\n\r\nMany authors have divided the European tertiary strata into three\r\ngroups--lower, middle, and upper; the lower comprising the oldest\r\nformations of Paris and London before-mentioned; the middle those of\r\nBordeaux and Touraine; and the upper all those newer than the middle group.\r\n\r\nWhen engaged in 1828 in preparing my work on the Principles of Geology, I\r\nconceived the idea of classing the whole series of tertiary strata in four\r\ngroups, and endeavouring to find characters for each, expressive of their\r\ndifferent degrees of affinity to the living fauna. With this view, I\r\nobtained information respecting the specific identity of many tertiary and\r\nrecent shells from several Italian naturalists, and among others from\r\nProfessors Bonelli, Guidotti, and Costa. Having in 1829 become acquainted\r\nwith M. Deshayes, of Paris, already well known by his conchological works,\r\nI learnt from him that he had arrived, by independent researches, and by\r\nthe study of a large collection of fossil and recent shells, at very\r\nsimilar views respecting the arrangement of tertiary formations. At my\r\nrequest he drew up, in a tabular form, lists of all the shells known to him\r\nto occur both in some tertiary formation and in a living state, for the\r\nexpress purpose of ascertaining the proportional number of fossil species\r\nidentical with the recent which characterized successive groups; and this\r\ntable, planned by us in common, was published by me in 1833.[110-A] The\r\nnumber of tertiary fossil shells examined by M. Deshayes was about 3000;\r\nand the recent species with which they had been compared about 5000. The\r\nresult then arrived at was, that in the lower tertiary strata, or those of\r\nLondon and Paris, there were about 3-1/2 per cent. of species identical\r\nwith recent; in the middle tertiary of the Loire and Gironde about 17 per\r\ncent.; and in the upper tertiary or Subapennine beds, from 35 to 50 per\r\ncent. In formations still more modern, some of which I had particularly\r\nstudied in Sicily, where they attain a vast thickness and elevation above\r\nthe sea, the number of species identical with those now living was believed\r\nto be from 90 to 95 per cent. For the sake of clearness and brevity, I\r\nproposed to give short technical names to these four groups, or the periods\r\nto which they respectively belonged. I called the first or oldest of them\r\nEocene, the second Miocene, the third Older Pliocene, and the last or\r\nfourth Newer Pliocene. The first of the above terms, Eocene, is derived\r\nfrom +eos+, eos, _dawn_, and +kainos+, cainos, _recent_, because the fossil\r\nshells of this period contain an extremely small proportion of living\r\nspecies, which may be looked upon as indicating the dawn of the existing\r\nstate of the testaceous fauna, no recent species having been detected in\r\nthe older or secondary rocks.\r\n\r\nThe term Miocene (from +meion+, meion, _less_, and +kainos+, cainos,\r\n_recent_) is intended to express a minor proportion of recent species (of\r\ntestacea), the term Pliocene (from +pleion+, pleion, _more_, and +kainos+,\r\ncainos, _recent_) a comparative plurality of the same. It may assist the\r\nmemory of students to remind them, that the _Mi_ocene contain a _mi_nor\r\nproportion, and _Pl_iocene a comparative _pl_urality of recent species; and\r\nthat the greater number of recent species always implies the more modern\r\norigin of the strata.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been objected to this nomenclature that certain species of\r\ninfusoria found in the chalk are still existing, and, on the other hand,\r\nthe Miocene and Older Pliocene deposits often contain the remains of\r\nmammalia, reptiles, and fish, exclusively of extinct species. But the\r\nreader must bear in mind that the terms Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene were\r\noriginally invented with reference purely to conchological data, and in\r\nthat sense have always been and are still used by me.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the fossil species from which the results before\r\nmentioned were obtained in 1830 by M. Deshayes was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  In the formations of the Pliocene periods, older and newer  777\r\n  In the Miocene                                             1021\r\n  In the Eocene                                              1238\r\n                                                             ----\r\n                                                             3036\r\n                                                             ----\r\n\r\nSince the year 1830 the progress of conchological science has been most\r\nrapid, and the number of living species obtained from different parts of\r\nthe globe has been raised from about 5000 to more than 10,000. New\r\nfossil species have also been added to our collections in great\r\nabundance; and at the same time a more copious supply of individuals\r\nboth of fossil and recent species, some of which were previously very\r\nrare, have been procured, affording more ample data for determining the\r\nspecific character. Besides the reforms introduced in consequence of\r\nthese new zoological facilities, other errors of a geological nature\r\nhave been in many instances removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-PLIOCENE FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\nI have adopted the term Post-Pliocene for those strata which are sometimes\r\ncalled post-tertiary or modern, and which are characterized by having all\r\nthe imbedded fossil shells identical with species now living, whereas even\r\nthe Newer Pliocene, or newest of the tertiary deposits above alluded to,\r\ncontain always some small proportion of shells of extinct species.\r\n\r\nThese modern formations, thus defined, comprehend not only those strata\r\nwhich can be shown to have originated since the earth was inhabited by man,\r\nbut also deposits of far greater extent and thickness, in which no signs of\r\nman or his works can be detected. In some of these, of a date long anterior\r\nto the times of history and tradition, the bones of extinct quadrupeds have\r\nbeen met with of species which probably never co-existed with the human\r\nrace, as, for example, the mammoth, mastodon, megatherium, and others, and\r\nyet the shells are the same as those now living.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the post-pliocene group which belongs to the human epoch,\r\nand which is sometimes called _Recent_, forms a very unimportant feature in\r\nthe geological structure of the earth's crust. I have shown, however, in\r\n\"The Principles,\" where the recent changes of the earth illustrative of\r\ngeology are described at length, that the deposits accumulated at the\r\nbottom of lakes and seas within the last 4000 or 5000 years can neither be\r\ninsignificant in volume or extent. They lie hidden, for the most part, from\r\nour sight; but we have opportunities of examining them at certain points\r\nwhere newly-gained land in the deltas of rivers has been cut through during\r\nfloods, or where coral reefs are growing rapidly, or where the bed of a sea\r\nor lake has been heaved up by subterranean movements and laid dry. Their\r\nage may be recognized either by our finding in them the bones of man in a\r\nfossil state, that is to say, imbedded in them by natural causes, or by\r\ntheir containing articles fabricated by the hands of man.\r\n\r\nThus at Puzzuoli, near Naples, marine strata are seen containing\r\nfragments of sculpture, pottery, and the remains of buildings, together\r\nwith innumerable shells retaining in part their colour, and of the same\r\nspecies as those now inhabiting the Bay of Baiae. The uppermost of these\r\nbeds is about 20 feet above the level of the sea. Their emergence can be\r\nproved to have taken place since the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.[112-A] Now here, as in almost every instance where any\r\nalterations of level have been going on in historical periods, it is\r\nfound that rocks containing shells, all, or nearly all, of which still\r\ninhabit the neighbouring sea, may be traced for some distance into the\r\ninterior, and often to a considerable elevation above the level of the\r\nsea. Thus, in the country round Naples, the post-pliocene strata,\r\nconsisting of clay and horizontal beds of volcanic tuff, rise at certain\r\npoints to the height of 1500 feet. Although the marine shells are\r\nexclusively of living species, they are not accompanied like those on\r\nthe coast at Puzzuoli by any traces of man or his works. Had any such\r\nbeen discovered, it would have afforded to the antiquary and geologist\r\nmatter of great surprise, since it would have shown that man was an\r\ninhabitant of that part of the globe, while the materials composing\r\nthe present hills and plains of Campania were still in the progress\r\nof deposition at the bottom of the sea; whereas we know that for\r\nnearly 3000 years, or from the times of the earliest Greek colonists,\r\nno material revolution in the physical geography of that part of\r\nItaly has occurred.\r\n\r\nIn Ischia, a small island near Naples, composed in like manner of marine\r\nand volcanic formations, Dr. Philippi collected in the stratified tuff and\r\nclay ninety-two species of shells of existing species. In the centre of\r\nIschia, the lofty hill called Epomeo, or San Nicola, is composed of\r\ngreenish indurated tuff, of a prodigious thickness, interstratified in some\r\nparts with marl, and here and there with great beds of solid lava. Visconti\r\nascertained by trigonometrical measurement that this mountain was 2605 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. Not far from its summit, at the height of about\r\n2000 feet, as also near Moropano, a village only 100 feet lower, on the\r\nsouthern declivity of the mountain, I collected, in 1828, many shells of\r\nspecies now inhabiting the neighbouring gulf. It is clear, therefore, that\r\nthe great mass of Epomeo was not only raised to its present height, but was\r\nalso _formed_ beneath the waters, within the post-pliocene period.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, however, of no small interest, that the fossil shells from\r\nthese modern tuffs of the volcanic region surrounding the Bay of Baiae,\r\nalthough none of them extinct, indicate a slight want of correspondence\r\nbetween the ancient fauna and that now inhabiting the Mediterranean.\r\nPhilippi informs us that when he and M. Scacchi had collected ninety-nine\r\nspecies of them, he found that only one, _Pecten medius_, now living in the\r\nRed Sea, was absent from the Mediterranean. Notwithstanding this, he adds,\r\n\"the condition of the sea when the tufaceous beds were deposited must have\r\nbeen considerably different from its present state; for _Tellina striata_\r\nwas then common, and is now rare; _Lucina spinosa_ was both more abundant\r\nand grew to a larger size; _Lucina fragilis_, now rare, and hardly\r\nmeasuring 6 lines, then attained the enormous dimensions of 14 lines, and\r\nwas extremely abundant; and _Ostrea lamellosa_, Broc., no longer met with\r\nnear Naples, existed at that time, and attained a size so large that one\r\nlower valve has been known to measure 5 inches 9 lines in length, 4 inches\r\nin breadth, 1-1/2 inch in thickness, and weighed 26-1/2 ounces.\"[113-A]\r\n\r\nThere are other parts of Europe where no volcanic action manifests itself\r\nat the surface, as at Naples, whether by the eruption of lava or by\r\nearthquakes, and yet where the land and bed of the adjoining sea are\r\nundergoing upheaval. The motion is so gradual as to be insensible to the\r\ninhabitants, being only ascertainable by careful scientific measurements\r\ncompared after long intervals. Such an upward movement has been proved to\r\nbe in progress in Norway and Sweden throughout an area about 1000 miles N.\r\nand S., and for an unknown distance E. and W., the amount of elevation\r\nalways increasing as we proceed towards the North Cape, where it may equal\r\n5 feet in a century. If we could assume that there had been an average rise\r\nof 2-1/2 feet in each hundred years for the last fifty centuries, this\r\nwould give an elevation of 125 feet in that period. In other words, it\r\nwould follow that the shores, and a considerable area of the former bed of\r\nthe Baltic and North Sea, had been uplifted vertically to that amount, and\r\nconverted into land in the course of the last 5000 years. Accordingly, we\r\nfind near Stockholm, in Sweden, horizontal beds of sand, loam, and marl\r\ncontaining the same peculiar assemblage of testacea which now live in the\r\nbrackish waters of the Baltic. Mingled with these, at different depths,\r\nhave been detected various works of art implying a rude state of\r\ncivilization, and some vessels built before the introduction of iron, the\r\nwhole marine formation having been upraised, so that the upper beds are now\r\n60 feet higher than the surface of the Baltic. In the neighbourhood of\r\nthese recent strata, both to the north-west and south of Stockholm, other\r\ndeposits similar in mineral composition occur, which ascend to greater\r\nheights, in which precisely the same assemblage of fossil shells is met\r\nwith, but without any intermixture of human bones or fabricated articles.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite or western coast of Sweden, at Uddevalla, post-pliocene\r\nstrata, containing recent shells, not of that brackish water character\r\npeculiar to the Baltic, but such as now live in the northern ocean, ascend\r\nto the height of 200 feet; and beds of clay and sand of the same age attain\r\nelevations of 300 and even 700 feet in Norway, where they have been usually\r\ndescribed as \"raised beaches.\" They are, however, thick deposits of\r\nsubmarine origin, spreading far and wide, and filling valleys in the\r\ngranite and gneiss, just as the tertiary formations, in different parts of\r\nEurope, cover or fill depressions in the older rocks.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that although the fossil fauna characterizing these\r\nupraised sands and clays consists exclusively of existing northern species\r\nof testacea, yet, according to Loven (an able living naturalist of Norway),\r\nthe species do not constitute such an assemblage as now inhabits\r\ncorresponding latitudes in the German Ocean. On the contrary, they\r\ndecidedly represent a more arctic fauna.[114-A] In order to find the same\r\nspecies flourishing in equal abundance, or in many cases to find them at\r\nall, we must go northwards to higher latitudes than Uddevalla in Sweden, or\r\neven nearer the pole than Central Norway.\r\n\r\nJudging by the uniformity of climate now prevailing from century to\r\ncentury, and the insensible rate of variation in the organic world in our\r\nown times, we may presume that an extremely lengthened period was required\r\neven for so slight a modification of the molluscous fauna, as that of which\r\nthe evidence is here brought to light. On the other hand, we have every\r\nreason for inferring on independent grounds (namely, the rate of upheaval\r\nof land in modern times) that the antiquity of the deposits in question\r\nmust be very great. For if we assume, as before suggested, that the mean\r\nrate of continuous vertical elevation has amounted to 2-1/2 feet in a\r\ncentury (and this is probably a high average), it would require 27,500\r\nyears for the sea-coast to attain the height of 700 feet, without making\r\nallowance for any pauses such as are now experienced in a large part of\r\nNorway, or for any oscillations of level.\r\n\r\nIn England, buried ships have been found in the ancient and now deserted\r\nchannels of the Rother in Sussex, of the Mersey in Kent, and the Thames\r\nnear London. Canoes and stone hatchets have been dug up, in almost all\r\nparts of the kingdom, from peat and shell-marl; but there is no evidence,\r\nas in Sweden, Italy, and many other parts of the world, of the bed of the\r\nsea, and the adjoining coast, having been uplifted bodily to considerable\r\nheights within the human period. Recent strata have been traced along the\r\ncoasts of Peru and Chili, inclosing shells in abundance, all agreeing\r\nspecifically with those now swarming in the Pacific. In one bed of this\r\nkind, in the island of San Lorenzo, near Lima, Mr. Darwin found, at the\r\naltitude of 85 feet above the sea, pieces of cotton-thread, plaited rush,\r\nand the head of a stalk of Indian corn, the whole of which had evidently\r\nbeen imbedded with the shells. At the same height on the neighbouring\r\nmainland, he found other signs corroborating the opinion that the ancient\r\nbed of the sea had there also been uplifted 85 feet, since the region was\r\nfirst peopled by the Peruvian race.[115-A] But similar shelly masses are\r\nalso met with at much higher elevations, at innumerable points between the\r\nChilian and Peruvian Andes and the sea-coast, in which no human remains\r\nwere ever, or in all probability ever will be, discovered.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies, also, in the island of Guadaloupe, a solid limestone\r\noccurs, at the level of the sea-beach, enveloping human skeletons. The\r\nstone is extremely hard, and chiefly composed of comminuted shell and\r\ncoral, with here and there some entire corals and shells, of species now\r\nliving in the adjacent ocean. With them are included arrow-heads, fragments\r\nof pottery, and other articles of human workmanship. A limestone with\r\nsimilar contents has been formed, and is still forming, in St. Domingo. But\r\nthere are also more ancient rocks in the West Indian Archipelago, as in\r\nCuba, near the Havanna, and in other islands, in which are shells identical\r\nwith those now living in corresponding latitudes; some well-preserved,\r\nothers in the state of casts, all referable to the post-pliocene period.\r\n\r\nI have already described in the seventh chapter, p. 84., what would be\r\nthe effects of oscillations and changes of level in any region drained\r\nby a great river and its tributaries, supposing the area to be first\r\ndepressed several hundred feet, and then re-elevated. I believe that\r\nsuch changes in the relative level of land and sea have actually\r\noccurred in the post-pliocene era in the hydrographical basin of the\r\nMississippi and in that of the Rhine. The accumulation of fluviatile\r\nmatter in a delta during a slow subsidence may raise the newly gained\r\nland superficially at the same rate at which its foundations sink, so\r\nthat these may go down hundreds or thousands of feet perpendicularly,\r\nand yet the sea bordering the delta may always be excluded, the whole\r\ndeposit continuing to be terrestrial or freshwater in character. This\r\nappears to have happened in the deltas both of the Po and Ganges, for\r\nrecent artesian borings, penetrating to the depth of 400 feet, have\r\nthere shown that fluviatile strata, with shells of recent species,\r\ntogether with ancient surfaces of land supporting turf and forests, are\r\ndepressed hundreds of feet below the sea level.[116-A] Should these\r\ncountries be once more slowly upraised, the rivers would carve out\r\nvalleys through the horizontal and unconsolidated strata as they rose,\r\nsweeping away the greater portion of them, and leaving mere fragments in\r\nthe shape of terraces skirting newly-formed alluvial plains, as\r\nmonuments of the former levels at which the rivers ran. Of this nature\r\nare \"the bluffs,\" or river cliffs, now bounding the valley of the\r\nMississippi throughout a large portion of its course. Thus let _a b_,\r\nfig. 106., represent the alluvial plain of the Mississippi, a plain\r\nwhich, at the point alluded to, is more than 30 miles broad, and is\r\ntruly a prolongation of the modern delta of that river. It is bounded by\r\nbluffs, the upper portions of which consist, both on the east and west\r\nside, of shelly loam, No. 2. rising from 100 to 200 feet above the level\r\nof the plain, and containing land and freshwater shells of the genera\r\n_Helix_, _Pupa_, _Succinea_, and _Lymnea_, of the same species as those\r\nnow inhabiting the neighbouring forests and swamps. In the same loam\r\nalso, No. 2., are found the bones of the Mastodon, Elephant, Megalonyx,\r\nand other extinct quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106. Valley of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n  1. Alluvium.\r\n  2. Loess.\r\n  3. _f_. Eocene.\r\n  4. Cretaceous.]\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to show that the deposits forming the delta and alluvial\r\nplain of the Mississippi consist of sedimentary matter, extending over an\r\narea of 30,000 square miles, and known in some parts to be several hundred\r\nfeet deep. Although we cannot estimate correctly how many years it may have\r\nrequired for the river to bring down from the upper country so large a\r\nquantity of earthy matter--the data for such a computation being as yet\r\nincomplete--we may still approximate to a minimum of the time which such an\r\noperation must have taken, by ascertaining experimentally the annual\r\ndischarge of water by the Mississippi, and the mean annual amount of solid\r\nmatter contained in its waters. The lowest estimate of the time required\r\nwould lead us to assign a high antiquity, amounting to many tens of\r\nthousands of years to the existing delta, the origin of which is\r\nnevertheless an event of yesterday when contrasted with those terraces,\r\n_c_, and _d e_, fig. 106., formed of the loam No. 2. above mentioned. These\r\nmaterials of the bluffs _a_ and _d_ were produced, the reader will observe,\r\nduring the first part of that great oscillation of level which depressed to\r\na depth of 200 feet a larger area than the modern delta and plain of the\r\nMississippi, and then restored the region to its former position.[117-A]\r\n\r\n_Loess of the Valley of the Rhine._--A similar succession of geographical\r\nchanges, attended by the production of a fluviatile formation, singularly\r\nresembling that which bounds the great plain of the Mississippi, seems to\r\nhave occurred in the hydrographical basin of the Rhine, since the time when\r\nthat basin had already acquired its present outline of hill and valley. I\r\nallude to the deposit provincially termed _loess_ in part of Germany, or\r\n_lehm_ in Alsace, filled with land and freshwater shells of existing\r\nspecies. It is a finely comminuted sand or pulverulent loam of a yellowish\r\ngrey colour, consisting chiefly of argillaceous matter combined with a\r\nsixth part of carbonate of lime, and a sixth of quartzose and micaceous\r\nsand. It often contains calcareous sandy concretions or nodules, rarely\r\nexceeding the size of a man's head. Its entire thickness amounts, in some\r\nplaces, to between 200 and 300 feet; yet there are often no signs of\r\nstratification in the mass, except here and there at the bottom, where\r\nthere is occasionally a slight intermixture of drifted materials derived\r\nfrom subjacent rocks. Unsolidified as it is, and of so perishable a nature,\r\nthat every streamlet flowing over it cuts out for itself a deep gully, it\r\nusually terminates in a vertical cliff, from the surface of which land\r\nshells are seen here and there to project in relief. In all these features\r\nit presents a precise counterpart to the loess of the Mississippi. It is so\r\nhomogeneous as generally to exhibit no signs of stratification, owing,\r\nprobably, to its materials having been derived from a common source, and\r\nhaving been accumulated by a uniform action. Yet it displays in some few\r\nplaces decided marks of successive deposition, where coarser and finer\r\nmaterials alternate, especially near the bottom. Calcareous concretions,\r\nalso enclosing land-shells, are sometimes arranged in horizontal layers. It\r\nis a remarkable deposit, from its position, wide extent, and thickness, its\r\nhomogeneous mineral composition, and freshwater origin. Its distribution\r\nclearly shows that after the great valley of the Rhine, from Schaffhausen\r\nto Bonn, had acquired its present form, having its bottom strewed over with\r\ncoarse gravel, a period arrived when it became filled up from side to side\r\nwith fine mud, which was also thrown down in the valleys of the principal\r\ntributaries of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, it may be traced far into Wuertemberg, up the valley of\r\nthe Neckar, and from Frankfort, up the valley of the Main, to above\r\nDettelbach. I have also seen it spreading over the country of Mayence,\r\nEppelsheim, and Worms, on the left bank of the Rhine, and on the opposite\r\nside on the table-land above the Bergstrasse, between Wiesloch and\r\nBruchsal, where it attains a thickness of 200 feet. Near Strasburg, large\r\nmasses of it appear at the foot of the Vosges on the left bank, and at the\r\nbase of the mountains of the Black Forest on the right bank. The\r\nKaiserstuhl, a volcanic mountain which stands in the middle of the plain of\r\nthe Rhine near Freiburg, has been covered almost everywhere with this loam,\r\nas have the extinct volcanos between Coblentz and Bonn. Near Andernach, in\r\nthe Kirchweg, the loess containing the usual shells alternates with\r\nvolcanic matter; and over the whole are strewed layers of pumice, lapilli,\r\nand volcanic sand, from 10 to 15 feet thick, very much resembling the\r\nejections under which Pompeii lies buried. There is no passage at this\r\nupper junction from the loess into the pumiceous superstratum; and this\r\nlast follows the slope of the hill, just as it would have done had it\r\nfallen in showers from the air on a declivity partly formed of loess.\r\n\r\nBut, in general, the loess overlies all the volcanic products, even those\r\nbetween Neuwied and Bonn, which have the most modern aspect; and it has\r\nfilled up in part the crater of the Roderberg, an extinct volcano near\r\nBonn. In 1833 a well was sunk at the bottom of this crater, through 70 feet\r\nof loess, in part of which were the usual calcareous concretions.\r\n\r\nThe interstratification above alluded to, of loess with layers of pumice\r\nand volcanic ashes, has led to the opinion that both during and since\r\nits deposition some of the last volcanic eruptions of the Lower Eifel\r\nhave taken place. Should such a conclusion be adopted, we should be\r\ncalled upon to assign a very modern date to these eruptions. This\r\ncurious point, therefore, deserves to be reconsidered; since it may\r\npossibly have happened that the waters of the Rhine, swollen by the\r\nmelting of snow and ice, and flowing at a great height through a valley\r\nchoked up with loess, may have swept away the loose superficial scoriae\r\nand pumice of the Eifel volcanos, and spread them out occasionally over\r\nthe yellow loam. Sometimes, also, the melting of snow on the slope of\r\nsmall volcanic cones may have given rise to local floods, capable of\r\nsweeping down light pumice into the adjacent low grounds.\r\n\r\nThe first idea which has occurred to most geologists, after examining\r\nthe loess between Mayence and Basle, is to imagine that a great lake\r\nonce extended throughout the valley of the Rhine between those two\r\nplaces. Such a lake may have sent off large branches up the course of\r\nthe Main, Neckar, and other tributary valleys, in all of which large\r\npatches of loess are now seen. The barrier of the lake might be placed\r\nsomewhere in the narrow and picturesque gorge of the Rhine between\r\nBingen and Bonn. But this theory fails altogether to explain the\r\nphenomena; when we discover that that gorge itself has once been filled\r\nwith loess, which must have been tranquilly deposited in it, as also in\r\nthe lateral valley of the Lahn, communicating with the gorge. The loess\r\nhas also overspread the high adjoining platform near the village of\r\nPlaidt above Andernach. Nay, on proceeding farther down to the north, we\r\ndiscover that the hills which skirt the great valley between Bonn and\r\nCologne have loess on their flanks, which also covers here and there the\r\ngravel of the plain as far as Cologne, and the nearest rising grounds.\r\n\r\nBesides these objections to the lake theory, the loess is met with near\r\nBasle, capping hills more than 1200 feet above the sea; so that a barrier\r\nof land capable of separating the supposed lake from the ocean would\r\nrequire to be, at least, as high as the mountains called the Siebengebirge,\r\nnear Bonn, the loftiest summit of which, the Oehlberg, is 1209 feet above\r\nthe Rhine and 1369 feet above the sea. It would be necessary, moreover, to\r\nplace this lofty barrier somewhere below Cologne, or precisely where the\r\nlevel of the land is now lowest.\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of supposing one continuous lake of sufficient extent\r\nand depth to allow of the simultaneous accumulation of the loess, at\r\nvarious heights, throughout the whole area where it now occurs, I formerly\r\nsuggested that, subsequently to the period when the countries now drained\r\nby the Rhine and its tributaries had nearly acquired their actual form and\r\ngeographical features, they were again depressed gradually by a movement\r\nlike that now in progress on the west coast of Greenland.[119-A] In\r\nproportion as the whole district was lowered, the general fall of the\r\nwaters between the Alps and the ocean was lessened; and both the main and\r\nlateral valleys, becoming more subject to river inundations, were partially\r\nfilled up with fluviatile silt, containing land and freshwater shells. When\r\na thickness of many hundred feet of loess had been thrown down slowly by\r\nthis operation, the whole region was once more upheaved gradually. During\r\nthis upward movement most of the fine loam would be carried off by the\r\ndenuding power of rains and rivers; and thus the original valleys might\r\nhave been re-excavated, and the country almost restored to its pristine\r\nstate, with the exception of some masses and patches of loess such as still\r\nremain, and which, by their frequency and remarkable homogeneousness of\r\ncomposition and fossils, attest the ancient continuity and common origin of\r\nthe whole. By imagining these oscillations of level, we dispense with the\r\nnecessity of erecting and afterwards removing a mountain barrier\r\nsufficiently high to exclude the ocean from the valley of the Rhine during\r\nthe period of the accumulation of the loess.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of land shells of the genera _Helix_, _Pupa_, and _Bulimus_,\r\nis very large in the loess; but in many places aquatic species of the\r\ngenera _Lymnea_, _Paludina_, and _Planorbis_ are also found. These may have\r\nbeen carried away during floods from shallow pools and marshes bordering\r\nthe river; and the great extent of marshy ground caused by the wide\r\noverflowings of rivers above supposed would favour the multiplication of\r\namphibious mollusks, such as the _Succinea_ (fig. 107.), which is almost\r\neverywhere characteristic of this formation, and is sometimes accompanied,\r\nas near Bonn, by another species, _S. amphibia_ (fig. 34. p. 29.). Among\r\nother abundant fossils are _Helix plebeium_ and _Pupa muscorum_. (See\r\nFigures.) Both the terrestrial and aquatic shells preserved in the loess\r\nare of most fragile and delicate structure, and yet they are almost\r\ninvariably perfect and uninjured. They must have been broken to pieces had\r\nthey been swept along by a violent inundation. Even the colour of some of\r\nthe land shells, as that of _Helix nemoralis_, is occasionally preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107. _Succinea elongata._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108. _Pupa muscorum._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109. _Helix plebeium._]\r\n\r\nBones of vertebrated animals are rare in the loess, but those of the\r\nmammoth, horse, and some other quadrupeds have been met with. At the\r\nvillage of Binningen, and the hills called Bruderholz, near Basle, I found\r\nthe vertebrae of fish, together with the usual shells. These vertebrae,\r\naccording to M. Agassiz, belong decidedly to the Shark family, perhaps to\r\nthe genus _Lamna_. In explanation of their occurrence among land and\r\nfreshwater shells, it may be stated that certain fish of this family ascend\r\nthe Senegal, Amazon, and other great rivers, to the distance of several\r\nhundred miles from the ocean.[120-A]\r\n\r\nAt Cannstadt, near Stuttgart, in a valley also belonging to the\r\nhydrographical basin of the Rhine, I have seen the loess pass downwards\r\ninto beds of calcareous tuff and travertin. Several valleys in northern\r\nGermany, as that of the Ilm at Weimar, and that of the Tonna, north of\r\nGotha, exhibit similar masses of modern limestone filled with recent shells\r\nof the genera _Planorbis_, _Lymnea_, _Paludina_, &c., from 50 to 80 feet\r\nthick, with a bed of loess much resembling that of the Rhine, occasionally\r\nincumbent on them. In these modern limestones used for building, the bones\r\nof _Elephas primigenius_, _Rhinoceros tichorinus_, _Ursus spelaeus_, _Hyaena\r\nspelaea_, with the horse, ox, deer, and other quadrupeds, occur; and in 1850\r\nMr. H. Credner and I obtained in a quarry at Tonna, at the depth of 15\r\nfeet, inclosed in the calcareous rock and surrounded with dicotyledonous\r\nleaves and petrified leaves, four eggs of a snake of the size of the\r\nlargest European Coluber, which, with three others, had been found lying\r\nin a series, or string.\r\n\r\nThey are, I believe, the first reptilian remains which have been met with\r\nin strata of this age.\r\n\r\nThe agreement of the shells in these cases with recent European species\r\nenables us to refer to a very modern period the filling up and\r\nre-excavation of the valleys; an operation which doubtless consumed\r\na long period of time, since which the mammiferous fauna has undergone\r\na considerable change.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[110-A] See Princ. of Geol. vol. iii. 1st ed.\r\n\r\n[112-A] See Principles, Index, \"Serapis.\"\r\n\r\n[113-A] Geol.

I\r\nshall first allude briefly to that portion of it which extends from\r\nFinland and the Scandinavian mountains to the north of Russia, and the\r\nlow countries bordering the Baltic, and which has been traced southwards\r\nas far as the eastern coast of England. This formation consists of mud,\r\nsand, and clay, sometimes stratified, but often wholly devoid of\r\nstratification, for a depth of more than a hundred feet. To this\r\nunstratified form of the deposit, the name of _till_ has been applied in\r\nScotland. It generally contains numerous fragments of rocks, some\r\nangular and others rounded, which have been derived from formations of\r\nall ages, both fossiliferous, volcanic, and hypogene, and which have\r\noften been brought from great distances. Some of the travelled blocks\r\nare of enormous size, several feet or yards in diameter; their average\r\ndimensions increasing as we advance northwards. The till is almost\r\neverywhere devoid of organic remains, unless where these have been\r\nwashed into it from older formations; so that it is chiefly from\r\nrelative position that we must hope to derive a knowledge of its age.\r\n\r\nAlthough a large proportion of the boulder deposit, or \"northern drift,\" as\r\nit has sometimes been called, is made up of fragments brought from a\r\ndistance, and which have sometimes travelled many hundred miles, the bulk\r\nof the mass in each locality consists of the ruins of subjacent or\r\nneighbouring rocks; so that it is red in a region of red sandstone, white\r\nin a chalk country, and grey or black in a district of coal and coal-shale.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rock on which the boulder formation reposes, if it consist\r\nof granite, gneiss, marble, or other hard stone capable of permanently\r\nretaining any superficial markings which may have been imprinted upon it,\r\nis smoothed or polished, and usually exhibits parallel striae and furrows\r\nhaving a determinate direction. This direction, both in Europe and North\r\nAmerica, is evidently connected with the course taken by the erratic blocks\r\nin the same district being north or south, or 20 or 30 degrees to the east\r\nor west of north, according as the large angular and rounded stones have\r\ntravelled. These stones themselves also are often furrowed and scratched\r\non more than one side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110. Limestone polished, furrowed, and scratched by the\r\nglacier of Rosenlaui, in Switzerland. (Agassiz.)\r\n\r\n  _a a._ White streaks or scratches, caused by small grains of flint frozen\r\n         into the ice.\r\n  _b b._ Furrows.]\r\n\r\nIn explanation of such phenomena I may refer the student to what was said\r\nof the action of glaciers and icebergs in the Principles of Geology.[122-A]\r\nIt is ascertained that hard stones, frozen into a moving mass of ice, and\r\npushed along under the pressure of that mass, scoop out long rectilinear\r\nfurrows or grooves parallel to each other on the subjacent solid rock. (See\r\nfig. 110.) Smaller scratches and striae are made on the polished surface by\r\ncrystals or projecting edges of the hardest minerals, just as a diamond\r\ncuts glass. The recent polishing and striation of limestone by coast-ice\r\ncarrying boulders even as far south as the coast of Denmark, has been\r\nobserved by Dr. Forchhammer, and helps us to conceive how large icebergs,\r\nrunning aground on the bed of the sea, may produce similar furrows on a\r\ngrander scale. An account was given so long ago as the year 1822, by\r\nScoresby, of icebergs seen by him drifting along in latitudes 69 deg. and 70 deg.\r\nN., which rose above the surface from 100 to 200 feet, and measured from a\r\nfew yards to a mile in circumference. Many of them were loaded with beds of\r\nearth and rock, of such thickness that the weight was conjectured to be\r\nfrom 50,000 to 100,000 tons.[122-B] A similar transportation of rocks is\r\nknown to be in progress in the southern hemisphere, where boulders included\r\nin ice are far more frequent than in the north. One of these icebergs was\r\nencountered in 1839, in mid-ocean, in the antarctic regions, many hundred\r\nmiles from any known land, sailing northwards, with a large erratic block\r\nfirmly frozen into it. In order to understand in what manner long and\r\nstraight grooves may be cut by such agency, we must remember that these\r\nfloating islands of ice have a singular steadiness of motion, in\r\nconsequence of the larger portion of their bulk being sunk deep under\r\nwater, so that they are not perceptibly moved by the winds and waves even\r\nin the strongest gales. Many had supposed that the magnitude commonly\r\nattributed to icebergs by unscientific navigators was exaggerated, but now\r\nit appears that the popular estimate of their dimensions has rather fallen\r\nwithin than beyond the truth. Many of them, carefully measured by the\r\nofficers of the French exploring expedition of the Astrolabe, were between\r\n100 and 225 feet high above water, and from 2 to 5 miles in length. Captain\r\nd'Urville ascertained one of them which he saw floating in the Southern\r\nOcean to be 13 miles long and 100 feet high, with walls perfectly vertical.\r\nThe submerged portions of such islands must, according to the weight of ice\r\nrelatively to sea-water, be from six to eight times more considerable than\r\nthe part which is visible, so that the mechanical power they might exert\r\nwhen fairly set in motion must be prodigious.[123-A]\r\n\r\nGlaciers formed in mountainous regions become laden with mud and stones,\r\nand if they melt away at their lower extremity before they reach the sea,\r\nthey leave wherever they terminate a confused heap of unstratified rubbish,\r\ncalled \"a moraine,\" composed of mud and pieces of all the rocks with which\r\nthey were loaded. We may expect, therefore, to find a formation of the same\r\nkind, resulting from the liquefaction of icebergs, in tranquil water. But,\r\nshould the action of a current intervene at certain points or at certain\r\nseasons, then the materials will be sorted as they fall, and arranged in\r\nlayers according to their relative weight and size. Hence there will be\r\npassages from _till_, as it is called in Scotland, to stratified clay,\r\ngravel, and sand, and intercalations of one in the other.\r\n\r\nI have yet to mention another appearance connected with the boulder\r\nformation, which has justly attracted much attention in Norway and other\r\nparts of Europe. Abrupt pinnacles and outstanding ridges of rock are often\r\nobserved to be polished and furrowed on the north, or \"strike\" side as it\r\nis called, or on the side facing the region from which the erratics have\r\ncome; while, on the other side, which is usually steeper and often\r\nperpendicular, called the \"lee-side,\" such superficial markings are\r\nwanting. There is usually a collection on this lee-side of boulders and\r\ngravel, or of large angular fragments. In explanation we may suppose that\r\nthe north side was exposed, when still submerged, to the action of\r\nicebergs, and afterwards, when the land was upheaved, of coast-ice, which\r\nran aground upon shoals, or was _packed_ on the beach; so that there would\r\nbe great wear and tear on the seaward slope, while, on the other, gravel\r\nand boulders might be heaped up in a sheltered position.\r\n\r\n_Northern origin of erratics._--That the erratics of northern Europe have\r\nbeen carried southward cannot be doubted; those of granite, for example,\r\nscattered over large districts of Russia and Poland, agree precisely in\r\ncharacter with rocks of the mountains of Lapland and Finland; while the\r\nmasses of gneiss, syenite, porphyry, and trap, strewed over the low sandy\r\ncountries of Pomerania, Holstein, and Denmark, are identical in mineral\r\ncharacters with the mountains of Norway and Sweden.\r\n\r\nIt is found to be a general rule in Russia, that the smaller blocks are\r\ncarried to greater distances from their point of departure than the larger;\r\nthe distance being sometimes 800 and even 1000 miles from the nearest rocks\r\nfrom which they were broken off; the direction having been from N.W. to\r\nS.E., or from the Scandinavian mountains over the seas and low lands to the\r\nsouth-east. That its accumulation throughout this area took place in part\r\nduring the post-pliocene period is proved by its superposition at several\r\npoints to strata containing recent shells. Thus, for example, in European\r\nRussia, MM. Murchison and De Verneuil found in 1840, that the flat country\r\nbetween St. Petersburg and Archangel, for a distance of 600 miles,\r\nconsisted of horizontal strata, full of shells similar to those now\r\ninhabiting the arctic sea, on which rested the boulder formation,\r\ncontaining large erratics.\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, in the immediate neighbourhood of Upsala, I observed, in 1834, a\r\nridge of stratified sand and gravel, in the midst of which is a layer of\r\nmarl, evidently formed originally at the bottom of the Baltic, by the slow\r\ngrowth of the mussel, cockle, and other marine shells, intermixed with some\r\nof freshwater species. The marine shells are all of dwarfish size, like\r\nthose now inhabiting the brackish waters of the Baltic; and the marl, in\r\nwhich myriads of them are imbedded, is now raised more than 100 feet above\r\nthe level of the Gulf of Bothnia. Upon the top of this ridge repose several\r\nhuge erratics, consisting of gneiss for the most part unrounded, from 9 to\r\n16 feet in diameter, and which must have been brought into their present\r\nposition since the time when the neighbouring gulf was already\r\ncharacterized by its peculiar fauna.[124-A] Here, therefore, we have proof\r\nthat the transport of erratics continued to take place, not merely when the\r\nsea was inhabited by the existing testacea, but when the north of Europe\r\nhad already assumed that remarkable feature of its physical geography,\r\nwhich separates the Baltic from the North Sea, and causes the Gulf of\r\nBothnia to have only one fourth of the saltness belonging to the ocean. In\r\nDenmark, also, recent shells have been found in stratified beds, closely\r\nassociated with the boulder clay.\r\n\r\nIt was stated that in Russia the erratics diminished generally in size in\r\nproportion as they are traced farther from their source. The same\r\nobservation holds true in regard to the average bulk of the Scandinavian\r\nboulders, when we pursue them southwards, from the south of Norway and\r\nSweden through Denmark and Westphalia. This phenomenon is in perfect\r\nharmony with the theory of ice-islands floating in a sea of variable depth;\r\nfor the heavier erratics require icebergs of a larger size to buoy them up;\r\nand, even when there are no stones frozen in, more than seven eighths, and\r\noften nine tenths, of a mass of drift ice is under water. The greater,\r\ntherefore, the volume of the iceberg, the sooner would it impinge on some\r\nshallower part of the sea; while the smaller and lighter floes, laden with\r\nfiner mud and gravel, may pass freely over the same banks, and be carried\r\nto much greater distances. In those places, also, where in the course of\r\ncenturies blocks have been carried southwards by coast-ice, having been\r\noften stranded and again set afloat in the direction of a prevailing\r\ncurrent, the blocks will be worn and diminish in size the farther they\r\ntravel from their point of departure.\r\n\r\nThe \"northern drift\" of the most southern latitudes is usually of the\r\nhighest antiquity. In Scotland it rests immediately on the older rocks,\r\nand is covered by stratified sand and clay, usually devoid of fossils,\r\nbut in which, at certain points near the east and west coast, as, for\r\nexample, in the estuaries of the Tay and Clyde, marine shells have been\r\ndiscovered. The same shells have also been met with in the north, at\r\nWick in Caithness, and on the shores of the Moray Frith. The principal\r\ndeposit on the Clyde occurs at the height of about 70 feet, but a few\r\nshells have been traced in it as high as 554 feet above the sea.\r\nAlthough a proportion of between 85 or 90 in 100 of the imbedded shells\r\nare of recent species, the remainder are unknown; and even many which\r\nare recent now inhabit more northern seas, where we may, perhaps,\r\nhereafter find living representatives of some of the unknown fossils.\r\nThe distance to which erratic blocks have been carried southwards in\r\nScotland, and the course they have taken, which is often wholly\r\nindependent of the present position of hill and valley, favours the idea\r\nthat ice-rafts rather than glaciers were in general the transporting\r\nagents. The Grampians in Forfarshire and in Perthshire are from 3000 to\r\n4000 feet high. To the southward lies the broad and deep valley of\r\nStrathmore, and to the south of this again rise the Sidlaw Hills[125-A]\r\nto the height of 1500 feet and upwards. On the highest summits of this\r\nchain, formed of sandstone and shale, and at various elevations, are\r\nfound huge angular fragments of mica schist, some 3 and others 15 feet\r\nin diameter, which have been conveyed for a distance of at least 15\r\nmiles from the nearest Grampian rocks from which they could have been\r\ndetached. Others have been left strewed over the bottom of the large\r\nintervening vale of Strathmore.\r\n\r\nStill farther south on the Pentland Hills, at the height of 1100 feet\r\nabove the sea, Mr. Maclaren has observed a fragment of mica-schist\r\nweighing from 8 to 10 tons, the nearest mountain composed of this\r\nformation being 50 miles distant.[125-B]\r\n\r\nThe testaceous fauna of the boulder period, in Scotland, England, and\r\nIreland, has been shown by Prof. E. Forbes to contain a much smaller\r\nnumber of species than that now belonging to the British seas, and to have\r\nbeen also much less rich in species than the Older Pliocene fauna of the\r\ncrag which preceded it. Yet the species are nearly all of them now living\r\neither in the British or more northern seas, the shells of more arctic\r\nlatitudes being the most abundant and the most wide spread throughout the\r\nentire area of the drift from north to south.\r\n\r\nThis extensive range of the fossils can by no means be explained by\r\nimagining the mollusca of the drift to have been inhabitants of a deep\r\nsea, where a more uniform temperature prevailed. On the contrary, many\r\nspecies were littoral, and others belonged to a shallow sea, not above\r\n100 feet deep, and very few of them lived, according to Prof. E. Forbes,\r\nat greater depths than 300 feet.\r\n\r\nFrom what was before stated it will appear that the boulder formation\r\ndisplays almost everywhere, in its mineral ingredients, a strange\r\nheterogeneous mixture of the ruins of adjacent lands, with stones both\r\nangular and rounded, which have come from points often very remote. Thus we\r\nfind it in our eastern counties, as in Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge,\r\nHuntingdon, Bedford, Hertford, Essex, and Middlesex, containing stones from\r\nthe Silurian and Carboniferous strata, and from the lias, oolite, and\r\nchalk, all with their peculiar fossils, together with trap, syenite,\r\nmica-schist, granite, and other crystalline rocks. A fine example of this\r\nsingular mixture extends to the very suburbs of London, being seen on the\r\nsummit of Muswell Hill, Highgate. But south of London the northern drift is\r\nwanting, as, for example, in the Wealds of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex.\r\n\r\n_Norfolk drift._--The drift can nowhere be studied more advantageously in\r\nEngland than in the cliffs of the Norfolk coast between Happisburgh and\r\nCromer. Vertical sections, having an ordinary height of from 50 to 70 feet,\r\nare there exposed to view for a distance of about 20 miles. The name of\r\ndiluvium was formerly given to it by those who supposed it to have been\r\nproduced by the violent action of a sudden and transient deluge, but the\r\nterm drift has been substituted by those who reject this hypothesis. Here,\r\nas elsewhere, it consists for the most part of clay, loam, and sand, in\r\npart stratified, in part devoid of stratification. Pebbles, together with\r\nsome large boulders of granite, porphyry, greenstone, lias, chalk, and\r\nother transported rocks, are interspersed, especially through the till.\r\nThat some of the granitic and other fragments came from Scandinavia I have\r\nno doubt, after having myself traced the course of the continuous stream of\r\nblocks from Norway and Sweden to Denmark, and across the Elbe, through\r\nWestphalia, to the borders of Holland. We need not be surprised to find\r\nthem reappear on our eastern coast, between the Tweed and the Thames,\r\nregions not half so remote from parts of Norway as are many Russian\r\nerratics from the sources whence they came.\r\n\r\nWhite chalk rubble, unmixed with foreign matter, and even huge fragments\r\nof solid chalk, also occur in many localities in these Norfolk cliffs.\r\nNo fossils have been detected in this drift, which can positively be\r\nreferred to the era of its accumulation; but at some points it overlies\r\na freshwater formation containing recent shells, and at others it is\r\nblended with the same in such a manner as to force us to conclude that\r\nboth were contemporaneously deposited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111. The shaded portion consists of Freshwater\r\nbeds. Intercalation of freshwater beds and of boulder clay and\r\nsand at Mundesley.]\r\n\r\nThis interstratification is expressed in the annexed figure, the dark mass\r\nindicating the position of the freshwater beds, which contain much\r\nvegetable matter, and are divided into thin layers. The imbedded shells\r\nbelong to the genera _Planorbis_, _Lymnea_, _Paludina_, _Unio_, _Cyclas_,\r\nand others, all of British species, except a minute _Paludina_ now\r\ninhabiting France. (See fig. 112.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112. _Paludina marginata_, Michaud. (_P. minuta_,\r\nStrickland.) The middle figure is of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe _Cyclas_ (fig. 113.) is merely a remarkable variety of the common\r\nEnglish species. The scales and teeth of fish of the genera Pike,\r\nPerch, Roach, and others, accompany these shells; but the species\r\nare not considered by M. Agassiz to be identical with known British\r\nor European kinds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113. _Cyclas_ (_Pisidium_) _amnica_, var.? The two\r\nmiddle figures are of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe series of formations in the cliffs of eastern Norfolk, now under\r\nconsideration, beginning with the lowest, is as follows:--First, chalk;\r\nsecondly, patches of a marine tertiary formation, called the Norwich\r\nCrag, hereafter to be described; thirdly, the freshwater beds already\r\nmentioned; and lastly, the drift. Immediately above the chalk, or crag,\r\nwhen that is present, is found here and there a buried forest, or a\r\nstratum in which the stools and roots of trees stand in their natural\r\nposition, the trunks having been broken short off and imbedded with\r\ntheir branches and leaves. It is very remarkable that the strata of the\r\noverlying boulder formation have often undergone great derangement at\r\npoints where the subjacent forest bed and chalk remain undisturbed.\r\nThere are also cases where the upper portion of the boulder deposit has\r\nbeen greatly deranged, while the lower beds of the same have continued\r\nhorizontal. Thus the annexed section (fig. 114.) represents a cliff\r\nabout 50 feet high, at the bottom of which is _till_, or unstratified\r\nclay, containing boulders, having an even horizontal surface, on which\r\nrepose conformably beds of laminated clay and sand about 5 feet thick,\r\nwhich, in their turn, are succeeded by vertical, bent, and contorted\r\nlayers of sand and loam 20 feet thick, the whole being covered by flint\r\ngravel. Now the curves of the variously coloured beds of loose sand,\r\nloam, and pebbles are so complicated that not only may we sometimes\r\nfind portions of them which maintain their verticality to a height\r\nof 10 or 15 feet, but they have also been folded upon themselves in\r\nsuch a manner that continuous layers might be thrice pierced in\r\none perpendicular boring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114. Cliff 50 feet high between Bacton\r\nGap and Mundesley.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115. Folding of the strata between East\r\nand West Runton.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116. Section of concentric beds west of Cromer.\r\n\r\n  1. Blue clay.\r\n  2. White sand.\r\n  3. Yellow Sand.\r\n  4. Striped loam and clay.\r\n  5. Laminated blue clay.]\r\n\r\nAt some points there is an apparent folding of the beds round a central\r\nnucleus, as at _a_, fig. 115., where the strata seem bent round a small\r\nmass of chalk; or, as in fig. 116., where the blue clay, No. 1., is in the\r\ncentre; and where the other strata, 2, 3, 4, 5, are coiled round it; the\r\nentire mass being 20 feet in perpendicular height. This appearance of\r\nconcentric arrangement around a nucleus is, nevertheless, delusive, being\r\nproduced by the intersection of beds bent into a convex shape; and that\r\nwhich seems the nucleus being, in fact, the innermost bed of the series,\r\nwhich has become partially visible by the removal of the protuberant\r\nportions of the outer layers.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Cromer are other fine illustrations of contorted drift\r\nreposing on a floor of chalk horizontally stratified and having a level\r\nsurface. These phenomena, in themselves sufficiently difficult of\r\nexplanation, are rendered still more anomalous by the occasional inclosure\r\nin the drift of huge fragments of chalk many yards in diameter. One\r\nstriking instance occurs west of Sherringham, where an enormous pinnacle of\r\nchalk, between 70 and 80 feet in height, is flanked on both sides by\r\nvertical layers of loam, clay, and gravel. (Fig. 117.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117. Included pinnacle of chalk at Old Hythe point,\r\nwest of Sherringham.\r\n\r\n  _d._ Chalk with regular layers of chalk flints.\r\n  _c._ Layer called \"the pan,\" of loose chalk, flints, and marine shells\r\n       of recent species, cemented by oxide of iron.]\r\n\r\nThis chalky fragment is only one of many detached masses which have been\r\nincluded in the drift, and forced along with it into their present\r\nposition. The level surface of the chalk _in situ_ (_d_) may be traced for\r\nmiles along the coast, where it has escaped the violent movements to which\r\nthe incumbent drift has been exposed.[129-A]\r\n\r\nWe are called upon, then, to explain how any force can have been exerted\r\nagainst the upper masses, so as to produce movements in which the\r\nsubjacent strata have not participated. It may be answered that, if we\r\nconceive the _till_ and its boulders to have been drifted to their\r\npresent place by ice, the lateral pressure may have been supplied by the\r\nstranding of ice-islands. We learn, from the observations of Messrs.\r\nDease and Simpson in the polar regions, that such islands, when they run\r\naground, push before them large mounds of shingle and sand. It is\r\ntherefore probable that they often cause great alterations in the\r\narrangement of pliant and incoherent strata forming the upper part of\r\nshoals or submerged banks, the inferior portions of the same remaining\r\nunmoved. Or many of the complicated curvatures of these layers of loose\r\nsand and gravel may have been due to another cause, the melting on the\r\nspot of icebergs and coast ice in which successive deposits of pebbles,\r\nsand, ice, snow, and mud, together with huge masses of rock fallen from\r\ncliffs, may have become interstratified. Ice-islands so constituted\r\noften capsize when afloat, and gravel once horizontal may have assumed,\r\nbefore the associated ice was melted, an inclined or vertical position.\r\nThe packing of ice forced up on a coast may lead to similar derangement\r\nin a frozen conglomerate of sand or shingle, and, as Mr. Trimmer has\r\nsuggested[130-A], alternate layers of earthy matter may have sunk\r\ndown slowly during the liquefaction of the intercalated ice, so as\r\nto assume the most fantastic and anomalous positions, while the\r\naqueous strata below, and those afterwards thrown down above, may\r\nbe perfectly horizontal.\r\n\r\nA buried forest has been adverted to as underlying the drift on the coast\r\nof Norfolk. At the time when the trees grew there must have been dry land\r\nover a large area, which was afterwards submerged, so as to allow a mass of\r\nstratified and unstratified drift, 200 feet and more in thickness, to be\r\nsuperimposed. The undermining of the cliffs by the sea in modern times has\r\nenabled us to demonstrate, beyond all doubt, the fact of this\r\nsuperposition, and that the forest was not formed along the present\r\ncoast-line. Its situation implies a subsidence of several hundred feet\r\nsince the commencement of the drift period, after which there must have\r\nbeen an upheaval of the same ground; for the forest bed of Norfolk is now\r\nagain so high as to be exposed to view at many points at low water; and\r\nthis same upward movement may explain why the _till_, which is conceived\r\nto have been of submarine origin, is now met with far inland, and on\r\nthe summit of hills.\r\n\r\nThe boulder formation of the west of England, observed in Lancashire,\r\nCheshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, and Worcestershire, contains in some\r\nplaces marine shells of recent species, rising to various heights, from 100\r\nto 350 feet above the sea. The erratics have come partly from the mountains\r\nof Cumberland, and partly from those of Scotland.\r\n\r\nBut it is on the mountains of North Wales that the \"Northern drift,\"\r\nwith its characteristic marine fossils, reaches its greatest altitude.\r\nOn Moel Tryfane, near the Menai Straits, Mr. Trimmer met with shells of\r\nthe species commonly found in the drift at the height of 1392 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that in the same neighbourhood where there is evidence of\r\nso great a submergence of the land during part of the glacial period, we\r\nhave also the most decisive proofs yet discovered in the British Isles of\r\nsubaerial glaciers. Dr. Buckland published in 1842 his reasons for\r\nbelieving that the Snowdonian mountains in Caernarvonshire were formerly\r\ncovered with glaciers, which radiated from the central heights through the\r\nseven principal valleys of that chain, where striae and flutings are seen\r\non the polished rocks directed towards as many different points of the\r\ncompass. He also described the \"moraines\" of the ancient glaciers, and the\r\nrounded \"bosses\" or small flattened domes of polished rock, such as the\r\naction of moving glaciers is known to produce in Switzerland, when gravel,\r\nsand, and boulders, underlying the ice, are forced along over a foundation\r\nof hard stone. Mr. Darwin, and subsequently Prof. Ramsay, have confirmed\r\nDr. Buckland's views in regard to these Welsh glaciers. Nor indeed was it\r\nto be expected that geologists should discover proofs of icebergs having\r\nabounded in the area now occupied by the British Isles in the Pleistocene\r\nperiod without sometimes meeting with the signs of contemporaneous glaciers\r\nwhich covered hills even of moderate elevation between the 50th and 60th\r\ndegrees of latitude.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the \"drift\" exhibits the same general characters and fossil\r\nremains as in Scotland and England; but in the southern part of that\r\nisland, Prof. E. Forbes and Capt. James found in it some shells which show\r\nthat the glacial sea communicated with one inhabited by a more southern\r\nfauna. Among other species in the south, they mention at Wexford and\r\nelsewhere the occurrence of _Nucula Cobboldiae_ (see fig. 120. p. 149.) and\r\n_Turritella incrassata_ (a crag fossil); also a southern form of _Fusus_,\r\nand a _Mitra_ allied to a Spanish species.[131-A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[122-A] Chap. xvi. and the references there given.\r\n\r\n[122-B] Voyage in 1822, p. 233.\r\n\r\n[123-A] T.

The superficial position of \"the drift\" is\r\nin perfect accordance with its imbedded organic remains, leading us to\r\nrefer its origin to a modern period. If, then, we encounter so much\r\ndifficulty in the interpretation of monuments relating to times so near our\r\nown--if in spite of their recent date they are involved in so much\r\nobscurity--the student may ask, not without reasonable alarm, how we can\r\nhope to decipher the records of remote ages.\r\n\r\nTo remove from the mind as far as possible this natural feeling of\r\ndiscouragement, I shall endeavour in this chapter to prove that what seems\r\nmost strikingly anomalous, in the \"erratic formation,\" as some call it, is\r\nreally the result of that glacial action which has already been alluded to.\r\nIf so, it was to be expected that so long as the true origin of so singular\r\na deposit remained undiscovered, erroneous theories and terms would be\r\ninvented in the effort to solve the problem. These inventions would\r\ninevitably retard the reception of more correct views which a wider field\r\nof observation might afterwards suggest.\r\n\r\nThe term \"diluvium\" was for a time the popular name of the boulder\r\nformation, because it was referred by some geologists to the deluge.\r\nOthers retained the name as expressive of their opinion that a series of\r\ndiluvial waves raised by hurricanes and storms, or by earthquakes, or by\r\nthe sudden upheaval of land from the bed of the sea, had swept over the\r\ncontinents, carrying with them vast masses of mud and heavy stones, and\r\nforcing these stones over rocky surfaces so as to polish and imprint\r\nupon them long furrows and striae.\r\n\r\nBut no explanation was offered why such agency should have been\r\ndeveloped more energetically in modern times than at former periods of\r\nthe earth's history, or why it should be displayed in its fullest\r\nintensity in northern latitudes; for it is important to insist on the\r\nfact, that the boulder formation is a _northern_ phenomenon. Even the\r\nsouthern extension of the drift, or the large erratics found in the Alps\r\nand the surrounding lands, especially their occurrence round the highest\r\nparts of the chain, offers such an exception to the general rule as\r\nconfirms the glacial hypothesis; for it shows that the transportation of\r\nstony fragments to great distances, and the striation, polishing, and\r\ngrooving of solid floors of rock, are here again intimately connected\r\nwith accumulations of perennial snow and ice.\r\n\r\nThat there is some intimate connection between a cold or northern climate\r\nand the various geological appearances now commonly called glacial, cannot\r\nbe doubted by any one who has compared the countries bordering the Baltic\r\nwith those surrounding the Mediterranean. The smoothing and striation of\r\nrocks, and the erratics, are traced from the sea-shore to the height of\r\n3000 feet above the level of the Baltic, whereas such phenomena are wholly\r\nwanting in countries bordering the Mediterranean; and their absence is\r\nstill more marked in the equatorial parts of Asia, Africa, and America; but\r\nwhen we cross the southern tropic, and reach Chili and Patagonia, we again\r\nencounter the boulder formation, between the latitude 41 deg. S. and Cape Horn,\r\nwith precisely the same characters which it assumes in Europe. The evidence\r\nas to climate derived from the organic remains of the drift is, as we have\r\nseen, in perfect harmony with the conclusions above alluded to, the former\r\nhabits of the species of mollusca being accurately ascertainable, inasmuch\r\nas they belong to species still living, and known to have at present a wide\r\nrange in northern seas.\r\n\r\nBut if we are correct in assuming that the northern hemisphere was\r\nconsiderably colder than now during the period under consideration, owing\r\nprobably to the greater area and height of arctic lands, and to the\r\nquantity of icebergs which such a geographical state of things would\r\ngenerate, it may be well to reflect before we proceed farther on the entire\r\nmodification which extreme cold would produce in the operation of those\r\ncauses spoken of in the sixth chapter as most active in the formation of\r\nalluvium. A large part of the materials derived from the detritus of rocks,\r\nwhich in warm climates would go to form deltas, or would be regularly\r\nstratified by marine currents, would, under arctic influences, assume a\r\nsuperficial and alluvial character. Instead of mud being carried farther\r\nfrom a coast than sand, and sand farther out than pebbles,--instead of\r\ndense stratified masses being heaped up in limited areas,--nearly the whole\r\nmaterials, whether coarse or fine, would be conveyed by ice to equal\r\ndistances, and huge fragments, which water alone could never move, would be\r\nborne for hundreds of miles without having their edges worn or fractured;\r\nand the earthy and stony masses, when melted out of the frozen rafts, would\r\nbe scattered at random over the submarine bottom, whether on mountain tops\r\nor in low plains, with scarcely any relation to the inequalities of the\r\nground, settling on the crests or ridges of hills in tranquil water as\r\nreadily as in valleys and ravines. Occasionally, in those deep and\r\nuninhabited parts of the ocean, never reached by any but the finest\r\nsediment in a normal state of things, the bottom would become densely\r\noverspread by gravel, mud, and boulders.\r\n\r\nIn the Western Hemisphere, both in Canada and as far south as the 40th and\r\neven 38th parallel of latitude in the United States, we meet with a\r\nrepetition of all the peculiarities which distinguish the European boulder\r\nformation. Fragments of rock have travelled for great distances from north\r\nto south; the surface of the subjacent rock is smoothed, striated, and\r\nfluted; unstratified mud or _till_ containing boulders is associated with\r\nstrata of loam, sand, and clay, usually devoid of fossils. Where shells are\r\npresent, they are of species still living in northern seas, and half of\r\nthem identical with those already enumerated as belonging to European drift\r\n10 degrees of latitude farther north. The fauna also of the glacial epoch\r\nin North America is less rich in species than that now inhabiting the\r\nadjacent sea, whether in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, or off the shores of\r\nMaine, or in the Bay of Massachusetts. At the southern extremity of its\r\ncourse, moreover, it presents an analogy with the drift of the south of\r\nIreland, by blending with a more southern fauna, as for example at Brooklyn\r\nnear New York, in lat. 41 deg. N., where, according to MM. Redfield and Desor,\r\n_Venus mercenaria_ and other southern species of shells begin to occur as\r\nfossils in the drift.\r\n\r\nThe extension on the American continent of the range of erratics during the\r\nPleistocene period to lower latitudes than they reached in Europe, agrees\r\nwell with the present southward deflection of the isothermal lines, or\r\nrather the lines of equal winter temperature. Formerly, as now, a more\r\nextreme climate and a more abundant supply of floating ice prevailed on the\r\nwestern side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAnother resemblance between the distribution of the drift fossils in Europe\r\nand North America has yet to be pointed out. In Norway, Sweden, and\r\nScotland, as in Canada and the United States, the marine shells are\r\nconfined to very moderate elevations above the sea (between 100 and 700\r\nfeet), while the erratic blocks and the grooved and polished surfaces of\r\nrock extend to elevations of several thousand feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.

Valley re-excavated.]\r\n\r\nI described in 1839 the fossil shells collected by Captain Bayfield from\r\nstrata of drift at Beauport near Quebec, in lat. 47 deg., and drew from them\r\nthe inference that they indicated a more northern climate, the shells\r\nagreeing in great part with those of Uddevalla in Sweden.[134-A] The shelly\r\nbeds attain at Beauport and the neighbourhood a height of 200, 300, and\r\nsometimes 400 feet above the sea, and dispersed through some of them are\r\nlarge boulders of granite, which could not have been propelled by a violent\r\ncurrent, because the accompanying fragile shells are almost all entire.\r\nThey seem, therefore, said Captain Bayfield, writing in 1838, to have been\r\ndropped down from melting ice, like similar stones which are now annually\r\ndeposited in the St. Lawrence.[134-B] I visited this locality in 1842, and\r\nmade the annexed section, fig. 118., which will give an idea of the general\r\nposition of the drift in Canada and the United States. I imagine that the\r\nwhole of the valley B was once filled up with the beds _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_,\r\n_f_, which were deposited during a period of subsidence, and that\r\nsubsequently the higher country (_h_) was submerged and overspread with\r\ndrift. The partial re-excavation of B took place when this region was again\r\nuplifted above the sea to its present height. Among the twenty-three\r\nspecies of fossil shells collected by me from these beds at Beauport, all\r\nwere of recent northern species, except one, which is unknown as living,\r\nand may be extinct (see fig. 119.). I also examined the same formation\r\nfarther up the valley of the St. Lawrence, in the suburbs of Montreal,\r\nwhere some of the beds of loam are filled with great numbers of the\r\n_Mytilus edulis_, or our common European mussel, retaining both its valves\r\nand purple colour. This shelly deposit, containing _Saxicava rugosa_ and\r\nother characteristic marine shells, also occurs at an elevated point on\r\nthe mountain of Montreal, 450 feet above the level of the sea.[135-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119. _Astarte Laurentiana._\r\n\r\n  _a._ Outside.\r\n  _b._ Inside of right valve.\r\n  _c._ Inside of left valve.]\r\n\r\nIn my account of Canada and the United States, published in 1845, I\r\nannounced the conclusion to which I had then arrived, that to explain\r\nthe position of the erratics and the polished surfaces of rocks, and\r\ntheir striae and flutings, we must assume first a gradual submergence of\r\nthe land in North America, after it had acquired its present outline of\r\nhill and valley, cliff and ravine, and then its re-emergence from the\r\nocean. When the land was slowly sinking, the sea which bordered it was\r\ncovered with islands of floating ice coming from the north, which, as\r\nthey grounded on the coast and on shoals, pushed along such loose\r\nmaterials of sand and pebbles as lay strewed over the bottom. By this\r\nforce all angular and projecting points were broken off, and fragments\r\nof hard stone, frozen into the lower surface of the ice, had power to\r\nscoop out grooves in the subjacent solid rock. The sloping beach, as\r\nwell as the floor of the ocean, might be polished and scored by this\r\nmachinery; but no flood of water, however violent, or however great the\r\nquantity of detritus or size of the rocky fragments swept along by it,\r\ncould produce such long, perfectly straight and parallel furrows, as are\r\neverywhere visible in the Niagara district, and generally in the region\r\nnorth of the 40th parallel of latitude.[135-B]\r\n\r\nBy the hypothesis of such a slow and gradual subsidence of the land we may\r\naccount for the fact that almost everywhere in N. America and Northern\r\nEurope the boulder formation rests on a polished and furrowed surface of\r\nrock,--a fact by no means obliging us to imagine, as some think, that the\r\npolishing and grooving action was, as a whole, anterior in date to the\r\ntransportation of the erratics. During the successive depression of high\r\nland, varying originally in height from 1000 to 3000 feet above the\r\nsea-level, every portion of the surface would be brought down by turns to\r\nthe level of the ocean, so as to be converted first into a coast-line, and\r\nthen into a shoal; and at length, after being well scored by the stranding\r\nupon it of thousands of icebergs, might be sunk to a depth of several\r\nhundred fathoms. By the constant depression of land, the coast would recede\r\nfarther and farther from the successively formed zones of polished and\r\nstriated rock, each outer zone becoming in its turn so deep under water as\r\nto be no longer grated upon by the heaviest icebergs. Such sunken areas\r\nwould then simply serve as receptacles of mud, sand, and boulders dropped\r\nfrom melting ice, perhaps to a depth scarcely, if at all, inhabited by\r\ntestacea and zoophytes. Meanwhile, during the formation of the unstratified\r\nand unfossiliferous mass in deeper water, the smoothing and furrowing of\r\nshoals and beaches is still going on elsewhere upon and near the coast in\r\nfull activity. If at length the subsidence should cease, and the direction\r\nof the movement of the earth's crust be reversed, the sunken area covered\r\nwith drift would be slowly reconverted into land. The boulder deposit,\r\nbefore emerging, would then for a time be brought within the action of the\r\nwaves, tides, and currents, so that its upper portion, being partially\r\ndisturbed, would have its materials re-arranged and stratified. Streams\r\nalso flowing from the land would in some places throw down layers of\r\nsediment upon the _till_. In that case, the order of superposition will be,\r\nfirst and uppermost, sand, loam, and gravel occasionally fossiliferous;\r\nsecondly, an unstratified and unfossiliferous mass, for the most part of\r\nmuch older date than the preceding, with angular erratics, or with boulders\r\ninterspersed; and, thirdly, beneath the whole, a surface of polished and\r\nfurrowed rock. Such a succession of events seems to have prevailed very\r\nwidely on both sides of the Atlantic, the travelled blocks having been\r\ncarried in general from the North Pole southwards, but mountain chains\r\nhaving in some cases served as independent centres of dispersion, of which\r\nthe Alps present the most conspicuous example.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means rare to meet with boulders imbedded in drift which are\r\nworn flat on one or more of their sides, the surface being at the same time\r\npolished, furrowed, and striated. They may have been so shaped in a glacier\r\nbefore they reached the sea, or when they were fixed in the bottom of an\r\niceberg as it ran aground. We learn from Mr. Charles Martins that the\r\nglaciers of Spitzbergen project from the coast into a sea between 100 and\r\n400 feet deep; and that numbers of striated pebbles or blocks are there\r\nseen to disengage themselves from the overhanging masses of ice as they\r\nmelt, so as to fall at once into deep water.[136-A]\r\n\r\nThat they should retain such markings when again upraised above the sea\r\nought not to surprise us, when we remember that rippled sands, and the\r\ncracks in clay dried between high and low water, and the foot-tracks of\r\nanimals and rain-drops impressed on mud, and other superficial markings,\r\nare all found fossil in rocks of various ages.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not difficult to account for the absence in many\r\ndistricts of striated and scored pebbles and boulders in glacial deposits,\r\nfor they may have been exposed to the action of the waves on a coast while\r\nit was sinking beneath or rising above the sea. No shingle on an ordinary\r\nsea-beach exhibits such striae, and at a very short distance from the\r\ntermination of a glacier every stone in the bed of the torrent which gushes\r\nout from the melting ice is found to have lost its glacial markings by\r\nbeing rolled for a distance even of a few hundred yards.\r\n\r\nThe usual dearth of fossil shells in glacial clays well fitted to preserve\r\norganic remains may, perhaps, be owing, as already hinted, to the absence\r\nof testacea in the deep sea, where the undisturbed accumulation of boulders\r\nmelted out of very large bergs may take place. In the AEgean and other parts\r\nof the Mediterranean, the zero of animal life, according to Prof. E.\r\nForbes, is approached at a depth of about 300 fathoms. In tropical seas it\r\nwould descend farther down, just as vegetation ascends higher on the\r\nmountains of hot countries. Near the pole, on the other hand, the same zero\r\nwould be reached much sooner both on the hills and in the sea. If the ocean\r\nwas filled with floating bergs, and a low temperature prevailed in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere during the glacial period, even the shallow part of the\r\nsea might have been uninhabitable, or very thinly peopled with living\r\nbeings. It may also be remarked that the melting of ice in some fiords in\r\nNorway freshens the water so as to destroy marine life, and famines have\r\nbeen caused in Iceland by the stranding of icebergs drifted from the\r\nGreenland coast, which have required several years to melt, and have not\r\nonly injured the hay harvest by cooling the atmosphere, but have driven\r\naway the fish from the shore by chilling and freshening the sea.\r\n\r\nIf the cold of the glacial epoch came on slowly, if it was long before it\r\nreached its greatest intensity, and again if it abated gradually, we may\r\nexpect to find the earliest and latest formed drift less barren of organic\r\nremains than that deposited during the coldest period. We may also expect\r\nthat along the southern limits of the drift during the whole glacial epoch,\r\nthere would be an intimate association of transported matter of northern\r\norigin with fossil-bearing sediment, whether marine or freshwater,\r\nbelonging to more southern seas, rivers, and continents.\r\n\r\nThat in the United States, the _Mastodon giganteus_ was very abundant after\r\nthe drift period is evident from the fact that entire skeletons of this\r\nanimal are met with in bogs and lacustrine deposits occupying hollows in\r\nthe drift. They sometimes occur in the bottom even of small ponds recently\r\ndrained by the agriculturist for the sake of the shell marl. I examined one\r\nof these spots at Geneseo in the state of New York, from which the bones,\r\nskull, and tusk of a Mastodon had been procured in the marl below a layer\r\nof black peaty earth, and ascertained that all the associated freshwater\r\nand land shells were of a species now common in the same district. They\r\nconsisted of several species of _Lymnea_, of _Planorbis bicarinatus_,\r\n_Physa heterostropha_, &c.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 no less than six skeletons of the same species of Mastodon were\r\nfound in Warren County, New Jersey, 6 feet below the surface, by a farmer\r\nwho was digging out the rich mud from a small pond which he had drained.\r\nFive of these skeletons were lying together, and a large part of the bones\r\ncrumbled to pieces as soon as they were exposed to the air. But nearly the\r\nwhole of the other skeleton, which lay about 10 feet apart from the rest,\r\nwas preserved entire, and proved the correctness of Cuvier's conjecture\r\nrespecting this extinct animal, namely, that it had twenty ribs like the\r\nliving elephant. From the clay in the interior within the ribs, just where\r\nthe contents of the stomach might naturally have been looked for, seven\r\nbushels of vegetable matter were extracted. I submitted some of this matter\r\nto Mr. A. Henfrey of London for microscopic examination, and he informs me\r\nthat it consists of pieces of small twigs of a coniferous tree of the\r\nCypress family, probably the young shoots of the white cedar, _Thuja\r\noccidentalis_, still a native of North America, on which therefore we may\r\nconclude that this extinct Mastodon once fed.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of the same quadruped, the most complete and probably the\r\nlargest ever found, was exhumed in 1845 in the town of Newburg, New York,\r\nthe length of the skeleton being 25 feet, and its height 12 feet. The\r\nanchylosing of the last two ribs on the right side afforded Dr. John C.\r\nWarren a true gauge for the space occupied by the intervertebrate\r\nsubstance, so as to enable him to form a correct estimate of the entire\r\nlength. The tusks when discovered were 10 feet long, but a part only could\r\nbe preserved. The large proportion of animal matter in the tusk, teeth, and\r\nbones of some of these fossil mammalia is truly astonishing. It amounts in\r\nsome cases, as Dr. C. T. Jackson has ascertained by analysis, to 27 per\r\ncent., so that when all the earthy ingredients are removed by acids, the\r\nform of the bone remains as perfect, and the mass of animal matter is\r\nalmost as firm, as in a recent bone subjected to similar treatment.\r\n\r\nIt would be rash, however, to infer from such data that these quadrupeds\r\nwere mired in _modern_ times, unless we use that term strictly in a\r\ngeological sense. I have shown that there is a fluviatile deposit in the\r\nvalley of the Niagara, containing shells of the genera _Melania_,\r\n_Lymnea_, _Planorbis_, _Valvata_, _Cyclas_, _Unio_, and _Helix_, &c.,\r\nall of recent species, from which the bones of the great Mastodon have\r\nbeen taken in a very perfect state. Yet the whole excavation of the\r\nravine, for many miles below the Falls, has been slowly effected since\r\nthat fluviatile deposit was thrown down.\r\n\r\nWhether or not, in assigning a period of more than 30,000 years for the\r\nrecession of the Falls from Queenstown to their present site, I have over\r\nor under estimated the time required for that operation, no one can doubt\r\nthat a vast number of centuries must have elapsed before so great a series\r\nof geographical changes were brought about as have occurred since the\r\nentombment of this elephantine quadruped. The freshwater gravel which\r\nincloses it is decidedly of much more modern origin than the drift or\r\nboulder clay of the same region.[138-A]\r\n\r\nOther extinct animals accompany the _Mastodon giganteus_ in the\r\npost-glacial deposits of the United States, among which the _Castoroides\r\nohioensis_, Foster and Wyman, a huge rodent allied to the beaver, and\r\nthe _Capybara_ may be mentioned. But whether the \"loess,\" and other\r\nfreshwater and marine strata of the Southern States, in which skeletons\r\nof the same Mastodon are mingled with the bones of the Megatherium,\r\nMylodon, and Megalonyx, were contemporaneous with the drift, or were of\r\nsubsequent date, is a chronological question still open to discussion.\r\nIt appears clear, however, from what we know of the tertiary fossils of\r\nEurope--and I believe the same will hold true in North America--that\r\nmany species of testacea and some mammalia, which existed prior to the\r\nglacial epoch, survived that era. As European examples among the\r\nwarm-blooded quadrupeds, the _Elephas primigenius_ and _Rhinoceros\r\ntichorinus_ may be mentioned. As to the shells, whether fresh water,\r\nterrestrial, or marine, they need not be enumerated here, as allusion\r\nwill be made to them in the sequel, when the pliocene tertiary fossils\r\nof Suffolk are described. The fact is important, as refuting the\r\nhypothesis that the cold of the glacial period was so intense and\r\nuniversal as to annihilate all living creatures throughout the globe.\r\n\r\nThat the cold was greater for a time than it is now in certain parts of\r\nSiberia, Europe, and North America, will not be disputed; but, before we\r\ncan infer the universality of a colder climate, we must ascertain what was\r\nthe condition of other parts of the northern, and of the whole southern,\r\nhemisphere at the time when the Scandinavian, British, and Alpine erratics\r\nwere transported into their present position. It must not be forgotten that\r\na great deposit of drift and erratic blocks is now in full progress of\r\nformation in the southern hemisphere, in a zone corresponding in latitude\r\nto the Baltic, and to Northern Italy, Switzerland, France, and England.\r\nShould the uneven bed of the southern ocean be hereafter converted by\r\nupheaval into land, the hills and valleys will be strewed over with\r\ntransported fragments, some derived from the antarctic continent, others\r\nfrom islands covered with glaciers, like South Georgia, which must now be\r\ncentres of the dispersion of drift, although situated in a latitude,\r\nagreeing with that of the Cumberland mountains in England.\r\n\r\nNot only are these operations going on between the 45th and 60th parallels\r\nof latitude south of the line, while the corresponding zone of Europe is\r\nfree from ice; but, what is still more worthy of remark, we find in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere itself, only 900 miles distant from South Georgia,\r\nwhere the perpetual snow reaches to the sea-beach, lands covered with\r\nforests, as in Terra del Fuego. There is here no difference of latitude to\r\naccount for the luxuriance of vegetation in one spot, and the absolute want\r\nof it in the other; but among other refrigerating causes in South Georgia\r\nmay be enumerated the countless icebergs which float from the antarctic\r\nzone, and which chill, as they melt, the waters of the ocean, and the\r\nsurrounding air, which they fill with dense fogs.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured in the \"Principles of Geology,\" chapters 7. and 8., to\r\npoint out the intimate connexion of climate and the physical geography of\r\nthe globe, and the dependence of the mean annual temperature, not only on\r\nthe height of the dry land, but on its distribution in high or low\r\nlatitudes at particular epochs. If, for example, at certain periods of the\r\npast, the antarctic land was less elevated and less extensive than now,\r\nwhile that at the north pole was higher and more continuous, the conditions\r\nof the northern and southern hemispheres might have been the reverse of\r\nwhat we now witness in regard to climate, although the mountains of\r\nScandinavia, Scotland, and Switzerland, may have been less elevated than at\r\npresent. But if in both of the polar regions a considerable area of\r\nelevated dry land existed, such a concurrence of refrigerating conditions\r\nin both hemispheres might have created for a time an intensity of cold\r\nnever experienced since; and such probably was the state of things during\r\nthat period of submergence to which I have alluded in this chapter.\r\n\r\n_Alpine erratics._--Although the arctic regions constitute the great centre\r\nfrom which erratics have travelled southwards in all directions in Europe\r\nand North America, yet there are some mountains, as I have already stated,\r\nlike those of North Wales and the Alps, which have served as separate and\r\nindependent centres for the dispersion of blocks. In illustration of this\r\nfact, the Alps deserve particular attention, not only from their magnitude,\r\nbut because they lie beyond the ordinary limits of the \"northern drift\" of\r\nEurope, being situated between the 44th and 47th degrees of north latitude.\r\nOn the flanks of these mountains, and on the Subalpine ranges of hills or\r\nplains adjoining them, those appearances which have been so often alluded\r\nto, as distinguishing or accompanying the drift, between the 50th and 70th\r\nparallels of north latitude, suddenly reappear, to assume in a more\r\nsouthern country their most exaggerated form. Where the Alps are highest,\r\nthe largest erratic blocks have been sent forth, as, for example, from the\r\nregions of Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa, into the adjoining parts of France,\r\nSwitzerland, Austria, and Italy, while in districts where the great chain\r\nsinks in altitude, as in Carinthia, Carniola, and elsewhere, no such rocky\r\nfragments, or a few only and of smaller bulk, have been detached and\r\ntransported to a distance.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1821, M. Venetz first announced his opinion that the Alpine\r\nglaciers must formerly have extended far beyond their present limits, and\r\nthe proofs appealed to by him in confirmation of this doctrine were\r\nafterwards acknowledged by M. Charpentier, who strengthened them by new\r\nobservations and arguments, and declared, in 1836, his conviction that the\r\nglaciers of the Alps must once have reached as far as the Jura, and have\r\ncarried thither their moraines across the great valley of Switzerland. M.\r\nAgassiz, after several excursions in the Alps with M. Charpentier, and\r\nafter devoting himself some years to the study of glaciers, published, in\r\n1840, an admirable description of them, and of the marks which attest the\r\nformer action of great masses of ice over the entire surface of the Alps\r\nand the surrounding country.[140-A] He pointed out that the surface of\r\nevery large glacier is strewed over with gravel and stones detached from\r\nthe surrounding precipices by frost, rain, lightning, or avalanches. And he\r\ndescribed more carefully than preceding writers the long lines of these\r\nstones, which settle on the sides of the glacier, and are called the\r\nlateral moraines; those found at the lower end of the ice being called\r\nterminal moraines. Such heaps of earth and boulders every glacier pushes\r\nbefore it when advancing, and leaves behind it when retreating. When the\r\nAlpine glacier reaches a lower and warmer situation, about 3000 or 4000\r\nfeet above the sea, it melts so rapidly that, in spite of the downward\r\nmovement of the mass, it can advance no farther. Its precise limits are\r\nvariable from year to year, and still more so from century to century; one\r\nexample being on record of a recession of half a mile in a single year. We\r\nalso learn from M. Venetz, that whereas, between the eleventh and fifteenth\r\ncenturies, all the Alpine glaciers were less advanced than now, they began\r\nin the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to push forward so as to cover\r\nroads formerly open, and to overwhelm forests of ancient growth.\r\n\r\nThese oscillations enable the geologist to note the marks which they leave\r\nbehind them as they retrograde, and among these the most prominent, as\r\nbefore stated, are the terminal moraines, or mounds of unstratified earth\r\nand stones, often divided by subsequent floods into hillocks, which cross\r\nthe valley like ancient earth-works, or embankments made to dam up the\r\nriver. Some of these transverse barriers were formerly pointed out by\r\nSaussure below the glacier of the Rhone, as proving how far it had once\r\ntransgressed its present boundaries. On these moraines we see many large\r\nangular fragments, which, having been carried along on the surface of the\r\nice, have not had their edges worn off by friction; but the greater number\r\nof the boulders, even those of large size, have been well rounded, not by\r\nthe power of water, but by the mechanical force of the ice, which has\r\npushed them against each other, or against the rocks flanking the valley.\r\nOthers have fallen down the numerous fissures which intersect the glacier,\r\nwhere, being subject to the pressure of the whole mass of ice, they have\r\nbeen forced along, and either well rounded or ground down into sand, or\r\neven the finest mud, of which the moraine is largely constituted.\r\n\r\nAs the terminal moraines are the most prominent of all the monuments left\r\nby a receding glacier, so are they the most liable to obliteration; for\r\nviolent floods or debacles are often occasioned in the Alps by the sudden\r\nbursting of what are called glacier-lakes. These temporary sheets of water\r\nare caused by the damming up of a river by a glacier which has increased\r\nduring a succession of cold seasons, and, descending from a tributary into\r\nthe main valley, has crossed it from side to side. On the failure of this\r\nicy barrier, the accumulated waters are let loose, which sweep away and\r\nlevel all transverse mounds of gravel and loose boulder below, and spread\r\ntheir materials in confused and irregular beds over the river-plain.\r\n\r\nAnother mark of the former action of glaciers, in situations where they\r\nexist no longer, is the polished, striated, and grooved surfaces of rocks\r\nalready alluded to. Stones which lie underneath the glacier and are pushed\r\nalong by it, sometimes adhere to the ice, and as the mass glides slowly\r\nalong at the rate of a few inches, or at the utmost two or three feet, per\r\nday, abrade, groove, and polish the rock, and the larger blocks are\r\nreciprocally grooved and polished by the rock on their lower sides. As the\r\nforces both of pressure and propulsion are enormous, the sand, acting like\r\nemery, polishes the surface; the pebbles, like coarse gravers, scratch and\r\nfurrow it; and the large stones scoop out grooves in it. Another effect\r\nalso of this action, not yet adverted to, is called \"roches moutonnees.\"\r\nProjecting eminences of rock are smoothed and worn into the shape of\r\nflattened domes, where the glaciers have passed over them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the surface of almost every kind of rock, when exposed in the open\r\nair, wastes away by decomposition, yet some retain for ages their polished\r\nand furrowed exterior; and, if they are well protected by a covering of\r\nclay or turf, these marks of abrasion seem capable of enduring for ever.\r\nThey have been traced in the Alps to great heights above the present\r\nglaciers, and to great horizontal distances beyond them.\r\n\r\nThere are also found, on the sides of the Swiss valleys, round and deep\r\nholes, with polished sides, such holes as waterfalls make in the solid\r\nrock, but in places remote from running waters, and where the form of the\r\nsurface will not permit us to suppose that any cascade could ever have\r\nexisted. Similar cavities are common in hard rocks, such as gneiss, in\r\nSweden, where they are called _giant caldrons_, and are sometimes 10 feet\r\nand more in depth; but in the Alps and Jura they often pass into\r\nspoon-shaped excavations and prolonged gutters. We learn from M. Agassiz\r\nthat hollows of this form are now cut out by streams of water, which flow\r\nalong the surface of glaciers, and then fall into fissures which are open\r\nto the bottom. Here, forming a cascade, the stream cuts a round cavity in\r\nthe rock with the gravel and sand, which it either finds there or carries\r\ndown with it, and causes to rotate; and, as it usually happens that the\r\nglacier is advancing, a locomotive cascade is produced, which converts the\r\nfirst circular hole into a deep groove.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of a glacier is to lodge a ring of stones round the summit\r\nof a conical peak which may happen to project through the ice. If the\r\nglacier is lowered greatly by melting, these circles of large angular\r\nfragments, which are called \"perched blocks,\" are left in a singular\r\nsituation near the top of a steep hill or pinnacle, the lower parts of\r\nwhich may be destitute of boulders.\r\n\r\n_Alpine blocks on the Jura._--Now some or all the marks above\r\nenumerated,--the moraines, erratics, polished surfaces, domes, striae,\r\ncaldrons, and perched rocks, are observed in the Alps at great heights\r\nabove the present glaciers, and far below their actual extremities; also\r\nin the great valley of Switzerland, 50 miles broad; and almost\r\neverywhere on the Jura, a chain which lies to the north of this valley.\r\nThe average height of the Jura is about one third that of the Alps, and\r\nis now entirely destitute of glaciers, yet it presents almost everywhere\r\nsimilar moraines, and the same polished and grooved surfaces, and\r\nwater-worn cavities. The erratics, moreover, which cover it, present a\r\nphenomenon which has astonished and perplexed the geologist for more\r\nthan half a century. No conclusion can be more incontestible than that\r\nthese angular blocks of granite, gneiss, and other crystalline\r\nformations, came from the Alps, and that they have been brought for a\r\ndistance of 50 miles and upwards across one of the widest and deepest\r\nvalleys of the world, so that they are now lodged on the hills and\r\nvalleys of a chain composed of limestone and other formations,\r\naltogether distinct from those of the Alps. Their great size and\r\nangularity, after a journey of so many leagues, has justly excited\r\nwonder; for hundreds of them are as large as cottages; and one in\r\nparticular, celebrated under the name of Pierre a Bot, rests on the side\r\nof a hill about 900 feet above the lake of Neufchatel, and is no less\r\nthan 40 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that these blocks on the Jura offer an exception to the\r\nrule before laid down, as applicable in general to erratics, since they\r\nhave gone from south to north. Some of the largest masses of granite and\r\ngneiss have been found to contain 50,000 and 60,000 cubic feet of stone,\r\nand one limestone block near Devens, which has travelled 30 miles, contains\r\n161,000 cubic feet, its angles being sharp and unworn.[143-A]\r\n\r\nVon Buch, Escher, and Studer have shown, from an examination of the\r\nmineral composition of the boulders, that those on the western Jura,\r\nnear Neufchatel, have come from the region of Mont Blanc and the Valais;\r\nthose on the middle parts of the Jura from the Bernese Oberland; and\r\nthose on the eastern Jura from the Alps of the small cantons, Glaris,\r\nSchwytz, Uri, and Zug. The blocks, therefore, of these three great\r\ndistricts have been derived from parts of the Alps nearest to the\r\nlocalities in the Jura where we now find them, as if they had crossed\r\nthe great valley in a direction at right angles to its length: the most\r\nwestern stream having followed the course of the Rhone; the central,\r\nthat of the Aar; and the eastern, that of the two great rivers, Reuss\r\nand Limmat. The non-intermixture of these groups of travelled fragments,\r\nexcept near their confines, was always regarded as most enigmatical by\r\nthose who adopted the opinion of Saussure, that they were all whirled\r\nalong by a rapid current of muddy water rushing from the Alps.\r\n\r\nM. Charpentier first suggested, as before mentioned, that the Swiss\r\nglaciers once reached continuously to the Jura, and conveyed to them\r\nthese erratics; but at the same time he conceived that the Alps were\r\nformerly higher than now. M. Agassiz, on the other hand, instead of\r\nintroducing distinct and separate glaciers, imagines that the whole\r\nvalley of Switzerland was filled with ice, and that one great sheet of\r\nit extended from the Alps to the Jura, when the two chains were of the\r\nsame height as now relatively to each other. Such an hypothesis labours\r\nunder this difficulty, that the difference of altitude, when distributed\r\nover a space of 50 miles, gives an inclination of no more than two\r\ndegrees, or far less than that of any known glaciers. It has, however,\r\nsince received the able support of Professor James Forbes, in his\r\nexcellent work on the Alps, published in 1843.\r\n\r\nIn the theory which I formerly advanced, jointly with Mr. Darwin[143-B],\r\nit was suggested that the erratics may have been transferred by floating\r\nice to the Jura, at the time when the greater part of that chain, and the\r\nwhole of the Swiss valley to the south, was under the sea. At that period\r\nthe Alps may have attained only half their present altitude, and may yet\r\nhave constituted a chain as lofty as the Chilian Andes, which, in a\r\nlatitude corresponding to Switzerland, now send down glaciers to the head\r\nof every sound, from which icebergs, covered with blocks of granite, are\r\nfloated seaward.[144-A] Opposite that part of Chili where the glaciers\r\nabound is situated the island of Chiloe, 100 miles in length, with a\r\nbreadth of 30 miles, running parallel to the continent. The channel which\r\nseparates it from the main land is of considerable depth, and 25 miles\r\nbroad. Parts of its surface, like the adjacent coast of Chili, are\r\noverspread with recent marine shells, showing an upheaval of the land\r\nduring a very modern period; and beneath these shells is a boulder deposit,\r\nin which Mr. Darwin found large travelled blocks. One group of fragments\r\nwere of granite, which had evidently come from the Andes, while in another\r\nplace angular blocks of syenite were met with. Their arrangement may have\r\nbeen due to successive crops of icebergs issuing from different sounds, to\r\nthe heads of which glaciers descend from the Andes. These icebergs, taking\r\ntheir departure year after year from distinct points, may have been\r\nstranded repeatedly, in equally distinct groups, in bays or creeks of\r\nChiloe, and on islets off the coast, so as afterwards to appear, some on\r\nhills and others in valleys, when that country and the bed of the adjacent\r\nsea had been upheaved. A continuance in future of the elevatory movement,\r\nin the region of the Andes and of Chiloe, might cause the former chain to\r\nrival the Alps in altitude, and give to Chiloe a height equal to that of\r\nthe Jura. The same rise might dry up the channel between Chiloe and the\r\nmain land, so that it would then represent the great valley of Switzerland.\r\nIn the course of these changes, all parts of Chiloe and the intervening\r\nstrait, having in their turn been a sea-shore, may have been polished and\r\nscratched by coast-ice, and by innumerable icebergs running aground and\r\ngrating on the bottom.\r\n\r\nIf we apply this hypothesis to Switzerland and the Jura, we are by no means\r\nprecluded from the supposition that, in proportion as the land acquired\r\nadditional height, and the bed of the sea emerged, the Jura itself may have\r\nhad its glaciers; and those existing in the Alps, which had at first\r\nextended to the sea, may, during some part of the period of upheaval, have\r\nbeen prolonged much farther into the valleys than now. At a later period,\r\nwhen the climate grew milder, these glaciers may have entirely disappeared\r\nfrom the Jura, and may have receded in the Alps to their present limits,\r\nleaving behind them in both districts those moraines which now attest the\r\nformer extension of the ice.[144-B]\r\n\r\n_Meteorites in drift._--Before concluding my remarks on the northern drift\r\nof the Old World, I shall refer to a fact recently announced, the discovery\r\nof a meteoric stone at a great depth in the alluvium of Northern Asia.\r\n\r\nErman, in his Archives of Russia for 1841 (p. 314.), cites a very\r\ncircumstantial account drawn up by a Russian miner of the finding of a mass\r\nof meteoric iron in the auriferous alluvium of the Altai. Some small\r\nfragments of native iron were first met with in the gold-washings of\r\nPetropawlowsker in the Mrassker Circle; but though they attracted\r\nattention, it was supposed that they must have been broken off from the\r\ntools of the workmen. At length, at the depth of 31 feet 5 inches from the\r\nsurface, they dug out a piece of iron weighing 17-1/2 pounds, of a\r\nsteel-grey colour, somewhat harder than ordinary iron, and, on analysing\r\nit, found it to consist of native iron, with a small proportion of nickel,\r\nas usual in meteoric stones. It was buried in the bottom of the deposit\r\nwhere the gravel rested on a flaggy limestone. Much brown iron ore, as well\r\nas gold, occurs in the same gravel, which appears to be part of that\r\nextensive auriferous formation in which the bones of the mammoth, the\r\n_Rhinoceros tichorhinus_, and other extinct quadrupeds abound. No\r\nsufficient data are supplied to enable us to determine whether it be of\r\nPost-Pliocene or Newer Pliocene date.\r\n\r\nWe ought not, I think, to feel surprise that we have not hitherto succeeded\r\nin detecting the signs of such aerolites in older rocks, for, besides their\r\nrarity in our own days, those which fell into the sea (and it is with\r\nmarine strata that geologists have usually to deal), being chiefly composed\r\nof native iron, would rapidly enter into new chemical combinations, the\r\nwater and mud being charged with chloride of sodium and other salts. We\r\nfind that anchors, cannon, and other cast-iron implements which have been\r\nburied for a few hundred years off our English coast have decomposed in\r\npart or entirely, turning the sand and gravel which enclosed them into a\r\nconglomerate, cemented together by oxide of iron. In like manner meteoric\r\niron, although its rusting would be somewhat checked by the alloy of\r\nnickel, could scarcely ever fail to decompose in the course of thousands of\r\nyears, becoming oxide, sulphuret or carbonate of iron, and its origin being\r\nthen no longer distinguishable. The greater the antiquity of rocks,--the\r\noftener they have been heated and cooled, permeated by gases or by the\r\nwaters of the sea, the atmosphere or mineral springs,--the smaller must be\r\nthe chance of meeting with a mass of native iron unaltered; but the\r\npreservation of the ancient meteorite of the Altai, and the presence of\r\nnickel in these curious bodies, renders the recognition of them in deposits\r\nof remote periods less hopeless than we might have anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[134-A] Geol.

It should, however, be stated that it is\r\ndifficult to draw the line of separation between these modern formations,\r\nespecially when we are called upon to compare deposits of marine and\r\nfreshwater origin, or these again with the ossiferous contents of caverns.\r\n\r\nIf as often as the carcasses of quadrupeds were buried in alluvium during\r\nfloods, or mired in swamps, or imbedded in lacustrine strata, a stream of\r\nlava had descended and preserved the alluvial or freshwater deposits, as\r\nfrequently happened in Auvergne (see above, p. 80,), keeping them free from\r\nintermixture with strata subsequently formed, then indeed the task of\r\narranging chronologically the whole series of mammaliferous formations\r\nmight have been easy, even though many species were common to several\r\nsuccessive groups. But when there have been oscillations in the levels of\r\nthe land, accompanied by the widening and deepening of valleys at more than\r\none period,--when the same surface has sometimes been submerged beneath the\r\nsea, after supporting forests and land quadrupeds, and then raised again,\r\nand subject during each change of level to sedimentary deposition and\r\npartial denudation,--and when the drifting of ice by marine currents or by\r\nrivers, during an epoch of intense cold, has for a season interfered with\r\nthe ordinary mode of transport, or with the geographical range of species,\r\nwe cannot hope speedily to extricate ourselves from the confusion in which\r\nthe classification of these Pleistocene formations is involved.\r\n\r\nAt several points in the valley of the Thames, remnants of ancient\r\nfluviatile deposits occur, which may differ considerably in age,\r\nalthough the imbedded land and freshwater shells in each are of recent\r\nspecies. At Brentford, for example, the bones of the Siberian Mammoth,\r\nor _Elephas primigenius_, and the _Rhinoceros tichorhinus_, both of\r\nthem quadrupeds of which the flesh and hair have been found preserved in\r\nthe frozen soil of Siberia, occur abundantly, with the bones of an\r\nhippopotamus, aurochs, short-horned ox, red deer, rein-deer, and great\r\ncave-tiger or lion.[147-A] A similar group has been found fossil at\r\nMaidstone, in Kent, and other places, agreeing in general specifically\r\nwith the fossil bones detected in the caverns of England. When we see\r\nthe existing rein-deer and an extinct hippopotamus in the same\r\nfluviatile loam, we are tempted to indulge our imaginations in\r\nspeculating on the climatal conditions which could have enabled these\r\ngenera to co-exist in the same region. Wherever there is a continuity of\r\nland from polar to temperate and equatorial regions, there will always\r\nbe points where the southern limit of an arctic species meets the\r\nnorthern range of a southern species; and if one or both have migratory\r\nhabits, like the Bengal tiger, the American bison, the musk ox, and\r\nothers, they may each penetrate mutually far into the respective\r\nprovinces of the other. There may also have been several oscillations of\r\ntemperature during the periods which immediately preceded and followed\r\nthe more intense cold of the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nThe strata bordering the left bank of the Thames at Grays Thurrock, in\r\nEssex, are probably of older date than those of Brentford, although the\r\nassociated land and freshwater shells are nearly all, if not all,\r\nidentical with species now living. Three of the shells, however, are no\r\nlonger inhabitants of Great Britain; namely, _Paludina marginata_ (fig.\r\n112. p. 127.), now living in France; _Unio littoralis_ (fig. 29. p.\r\n28.), now inhabiting the Loire; and _Cyrena consobrina_ (fig. 26. p.\r\n28.). The last-mentioned fossil (a recent Egyptian shell of the Nile) is\r\nvery abundant at Grays, and deserves notice, because the genus _Cyrena_\r\nis now no longer European.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceros occurring in the same beds (_R. leptorhinus_, see fig. 131.\r\np. 160.) is of a different species from that of Brentford above mentioned,\r\nand the accompanying elephant belongs to the variety called _Elephas\r\nmeridionalis_, which, according to MM. Owen and H. von Meyer, two high\r\nauthorities, is the same species as the Siberian mammoth, although some\r\nnaturalists regard it as distinct. With the above mammalia is also found\r\nthe _Hippopotamus major_, and what is most remarkable in so modern and\r\nnorthern a deposit, a monkey, called by Owen, _Macacus pliocenus_.\r\n\r\nThe submerged forest already alluded to (p. 130.) as underlying the drift\r\nat the base of the cliffs of Norfolk is associated with a bed of lignite\r\nand loam, in which a great number of fossil bones occur, apparently of the\r\nsame group as that of Grays, just mentioned. It has sometimes been called\r\n\"the Elephant bed.\" One portion of it, which stretches out under the sea at\r\nHappisburgh, was overgrown in 1820 by a bank of recent oysters, and there\r\nthe fishermen dredged up, according to Woodward, in the course of thirteen\r\nyears, together with the oysters, above 2000 mammoths' grinders.[147-B]\r\nAnother portion of the same continuous stratum has yielded at Bacton,\r\nCromer, and other places on the coast, the bones of a gigantic beaver\r\n(_Trogontherium Cuvierii_, Fischer), as well as the ox, horse, and deer,\r\nand both species of rhinoceros, _R. tichorhinus_ and _R. leptorhinus_.\r\n\r\nIn studying these and various other similar assemblages of fossils, we have\r\na good exemplification of the more rapid rate at which the mammiferous\r\nfauna, as compared to the testaceous, diverges when traced backwards in\r\ntime from the recent type. I have before hinted, that the longevity of\r\nspecies in the class of warm-blooded quadrupeds is less great than in that\r\nof the mollusca, the latter having probably more capacity for enduring\r\nthose changes of climate and other external circumstances which take place\r\nin the course of ages on the earth's surface. This phenomenon is by no\r\nmeans confined to Europe, for Mr. Darwin found at Bahia Blanca, in South\r\nAmerica, lat. 39 deg. S., near the northern confines of Patagonia, fossil\r\nremains of the extinct mammiferous genera Megatherium, Megalonyx, Toxodon,\r\nand others, associated with shells, almost all of species already\r\nascertained to be still living in the contiguous sea[148-A]; the marine\r\nmollusca, as well as those of rivers, lakes, or the land, having died out\r\nmore slowly than the terrestrial mammalia.\r\n\r\nI alluded before (p. 125.) to certain marine strata overlying till near\r\nGlasgow, and at other points on the Clyde, in which the shells are for the\r\nmost part British, with an intermixture of some arctic species; while\r\nothers, about a tenth of the whole, are supposed to be extinct. This\r\nformation may also be called Newer Pliocene.\r\n\r\n_Fluvio-marine crag of Norwich._--At several places within five miles of\r\nNorwich, on both banks of the Yare, beds of sand, loam, and gravel,\r\nprovincially termed \"crag,\" occur, in which there is a mixture of marine,\r\nland, and freshwater shells, with ichthyolites and bones of mammalia. It is\r\nclear that these beds have been accumulated at the bottom of the sea near\r\nthe mouth of a river. They form patches of variable thickness, resting on\r\nwhite chalk, and are covered by a dense mass of stratified flint gravel.\r\nThe surface of the chalk is often perforated to the depth of several inches\r\nby the _Pholas crispata_, each fossil shell still remaining at the bottom\r\nof its cylindrical cavity, now filled up with loose sand which has fallen\r\nfrom the incumbent crag. This species of Pholas still exists and drills the\r\nrocks between high and low water on the British coast. The most common\r\nshells of these strata, such as _Fusus striatus_, _Turritella terebra_,\r\n_Cardium edule_, and _Cyprina islandica_, are now abundant in the British\r\nseas; but with them are some extinct species, such as _Nucula Cobboldiae_\r\n(fig. 120.) and _Tellina obliqua_ (fig. 121.). _Natica helicoides_ (fig.\r\n122.) is an example of a species formerly known only as fossil, but which\r\nhas now been found living in our seas.\r\n\r\nAmong the accompanying bones of mammalia is the _Mastodon_\r\n_angustidens_[149-A] (see fig. 130.), a portion of the upper jawbone with a\r\ntooth having been found by Mr. Wigham at Postwick, near Norwich. As this\r\nspecies has also been found in the Red Crag, both at Sutton and at\r\nFelixstow, and had hitherto been regarded as characteristic of formations\r\nolder than the Pleistocene, it may possibly have been washed out of the Red\r\ninto the Norwich Crag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120. _Nucula Cobboldiae._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121. _Tellina obliqua._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122. _Natica helicoides_, Johnston.]\r\n\r\nAmong the bones, however, respecting the authenticity of which there\r\nseems no doubt, may be mentioned those of the elephant, horse, pig,\r\ndeer, and the jaws and teeth of field mice (fig. 141.). I have seen the\r\ntusk of an elephant from Bramerton near Norwich, to which, many serpulae\r\nwere attached, showing that it had lain for some time at the bottom of\r\nthe sea of the Norwich Crag.\r\n\r\nAt Thorpe, near Aldborough, and at Southwold, in Suffolk, this\r\nfluvio-marine formation is well exposed in the sea-cliffs, consisting of\r\nsand, shingle, loam, and laminated clay. Some of the strata there bear\r\nthe marks of tranquil deposition, and in one section a thickness of 40\r\nfeet is sometimes exposed to view. Some of the lamellibranchiate shells\r\nhave both valves united, although mixed with land and freshwater\r\ntestacea, and with the bones and teeth of elephant, rhinoceros, horse,\r\nand deer. Captain Alexander, with whom I examined these strata in 1835,\r\nshowed me a bed rich in marine shells, in which he had found a large\r\nspecimen of the _Fusus striatus_, filled with sand, and in the interior\r\nof which was the tooth of a horse.\r\n\r\nAmong the freshwater shells I obtained the _Cyrena consobrina_ (fig. 26.\r\np. 28.), before mentioned, supposed to agree with a species now\r\nliving in the Nile.\r\n\r\nI formerly classed the Norwich Crag as older Pliocene, conceiving that more\r\nthan a third of the fossil testacea were extinct; but there now seems good\r\nreason for believing that several of the rarer shells obtained from these\r\nstrata do not really belong to a contemporary fauna, but have been washed\r\nout of the older beds of the \"Red Crag;\" while other species, once supposed\r\nto have died out, have lately been met with living in the British seas.\r\nAccording to Mr. Searles Wood, the total number of marine species does not\r\nexceed seventy-six, of which one tenth only are extinct. Of the fourteen\r\nassociated freshwater shells, all the species appear to be living. Strata\r\ncontaining the same shells as those near Norwich have been found by Mr.\r\nBean, at Bridlington, in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n_Newer Pliocene strata of Sicily._--In no part of Europe are the Newer\r\nPliocene formations seen to enter so largely into the structure of the\r\nearth's crust, or to rise to such heights above the level of the sea, as in\r\nSicily. They cover nearly half the island, and near its centre, at\r\nCastrogiovanni, they reach an elevation of 3000 feet. They consist\r\nprincipally of two divisions, the upper calcareous, the lower argillaceous,\r\nboth of which may be seen at Syracuse, Girgenti, and Castrogiovanni.\r\n\r\nAccording to Philippi, to whom we are indebted for the best account of the\r\ntertiary shells of this island, thirty-five species out of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-four obtained from the beds in central Sicily are extinct. Of the\r\nremainder, which still live, five species are no longer inhabitants of the\r\nMediterranean. When I visited Sicily in 1828 I estimated the proportion of\r\nliving species as somewhat greater, partly because I confounded with the\r\ntertiary formation of central Sicily the strata at the base of Etna, and\r\nsome other localities, where the fossils are now proved to agree entirely\r\nwith the present Mediterranean fauna.\r\n\r\nPhilippi came to the conclusion, that in Sicily there is a gradual\r\npassage from beds containing 70 per cent. of recent shells, to those in\r\nwhich the whole of the fossils are identical with recent species; but\r\nhis tables appear scarcely to bear out so important a generalization,\r\nseveral of the places cited by him in confirmation having as yet\r\nfurnished no more than twenty or thirty species of testacea. The\r\nSicilian beds in question probably belong to about the same period as\r\nthe Norwich Crag, although a geologist, accustomed to see nearly all the\r\nPleistocene formations in the north of Europe occupying low grounds and\r\nvery incoherent in texture, is naturally surprised to behold formations\r\nof the same age so solid and stony, of such thickness, and attaining so\r\ngreat an elevation above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe upper or calcareous member of this group in Sicily consists in some\r\nplaces of a yellowish-white stone, like the calcaire grossier of Paris, in\r\nothers, of a rock nearly as compact as marble. Its aggregate thickness\r\namounts sometimes to 700 or 800 feet. It usually occurs in regular\r\nhorizontal beds, and is occasionally intersected by deep valleys, such as\r\nthose of Sortino and Pentalica, in which are numerous caverns. The fossils\r\nare in every stage of preservation, from shells retaining portions of their\r\nanimal matter and colour, to others which are mere casts.\r\n\r\nThe limestone passes downwards into a sandstone and conglomerate, below\r\nwhich is clay and blue marl, like that of the Subapennine hills, from\r\nwhich perfect shells and corals may be disengaged. The clay sometimes\r\nalternates with yellow sand.\r\n\r\nSouth of the plain of Catania is a region in which the tertiary beds are\r\nintermixed with volcanic matter, which has been for the most part the\r\nproduct of submarine eruptions. It appears that, while the clay, sand,\r\nand yellow limestone before mentioned were in course of deposition at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, volcanos burst out beneath the waters, like that\r\nof Graham Island, in 1831, and these explosions recurred again and again\r\nat distant intervals of time. Volcanic ashes and sand were showered down\r\nand spread by the waves and currents so as to form strata of tuff,\r\nwhich are found intercalated between beds of limestone and clay\r\ncontaining marine shells, the thickness of the whole mass exceeding 2000\r\nfeet. The fissures through which the lava rose may be seen in many\r\nplaces forming what are called _dikes_.\r\n\r\nIn part of the region above alluded to, as, for example, near Lentini, a\r\nconglomerate occurs in which I observed many pebbles of volcanic rocks\r\ncovered by full grown _serpulae_. We may explain the origin of these by\r\nsupposing that there were some small volcanic islands which may have been\r\ndestroyed from time to time by the waves, as Graham Island has been swept\r\naway since 1831. The rounded blocks and pebbles of solid volcanic matter,\r\nafter being rolled for a time on the beach of such temporary islands, were\r\ncarried at length into some tranquil part of the sea, where they lay for\r\nyears, while the marine _serpulae_ adhered to them, their shells growing and\r\ncovering their surface, as they are seen adhering to the shell figured in\r\np. 22. Finally, the bed of pebbles was itself covered with strata of shelly\r\nlimestone. At Vizzini, a town not many miles distant to the S.W., I\r\nremarked another striking proof of the gradual manner in which these modern\r\nrocks were formed, and the long intervals of time which elapsed between the\r\npouring out of distinct sheets of lava. A bed of oysters no less than 20\r\nfeet in thickness rests upon a current of basaltic lava. The oysters are\r\nperfectly identifiable with our common eatable species. Upon the oyster\r\nbed, again, is superimposed a second mass of lava, together with tuff or\r\npeperino. In the midst of the same alternating igneous and aqueous\r\nformations is seen near Galieri, not far from Vizzini, a horizontal bed,\r\nabout a foot and a half in thickness, composed entirely of a common\r\nMediterranean coral (_Caryophyllia caespitosa_, Lam.). These corals stand\r\nerect as they grew; and, after being traced for hundreds of yards, are\r\nagain found at a corresponding height on the opposite side of the valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123. _Caryophyllia caespitosa_, Lam.\r\n(_Cladocora caespitosa_, Ehr.)\r\n\r\n  _a._  Stem with young stem growing from its side.\r\n  _a*._ Young stem of same twice magnified.\r\n  _b._  Portion of branch, twice magnified, with the base of a lateral\r\n        branch; the exterior ridges of the main branch appearing through\r\n        the lamellae of the lateral one.\r\n  _c._  Transverse section of same, proving, by the integrity of the main\r\n        branch, that the lateral one did not originate in a subdivision\r\n        of the animal.\r\n  _d._  A branch, having at its base another laterally united to it, and\r\n        two young corals at its upper part.\r\n  _e._  A main branch, with a full grown lateral one.\r\n  _f._  A perfect terminal star.]\r\n\r\nThe corals are usually branched, but not by the division of the animals as\r\nsome have supposed, but by the attachment of young individuals to the sides\r\nof the older ones; and we must understand this mode of increase, in order\r\nto appreciate the time which was required for the building up of the whole\r\nbed of coral during the growth of many successive generations.[152-A]\r\n\r\nAmong the other fossil shells met with in these Sicilian strata, which\r\nstill continue to abound in the Mediterranean, no shell is more\r\nconspicuous, from its size and frequent occurrence, than the great\r\nscallop, _Pecten jacobaeus_ (see fig. 124.), now so common in the\r\nneighbouring seas. We see this shell in the calcareous beds at Palermo\r\nin great numbers, in the limestone at Girgenti, and in that which\r\nalternates with volcanic rocks in the country between Syracuse and\r\nVizzini, often at great heights above the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124. _Pecten jacobaeus_; half natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe more we reflect on the preponderating number of these recent shells,\r\nthe more we are surprised at the great thickness, solidity, and height\r\nabove the sea of the rocky masses in which they are entombed, and the vast\r\namount of geographical change which has taken place since their origin. It\r\nmust be remembered that, before they began to emerge, the uppermost strata\r\nof the whole must have been deposited under water. In order, therefore, to\r\nform a just conception of their antiquity, we must first examine singly the\r\ninnumerable minute parts of which the whole is made up, the successive beds\r\nof shells, corals, volcanic ashes, conglomerates, and sheets of lava; and\r\nwe must afterwards contemplate the time required for the gradual upheaval\r\nof the rocks, and the excavation of the valleys. The historical period\r\nseems scarcely to form an appreciable unit in this computation, for we\r\nfind ancient Greek temples, like those of Girgenti (Agrigentum), built of\r\nthe modern limestone of which we are speaking, and resting on a hill\r\ncomposed of the same; the site having remained to all appearance unaltered\r\nsince the Greeks first colonised the island.\r\n\r\nThe modern geological date of the rocks in this region leads to another\r\nsingular and unexpected conclusion, namely, that the fauna and flora of a\r\nlarge part of Sicily are of higher antiquity than the country itself,\r\nhaving not only flourished before the lands were raised from the deep, but\r\neven before their materials were brought together beneath the waters. The\r\nchain of reasoning which conducts us to this opinion may be stated in a few\r\nwords. The larger part of the island has been converted from sea into land\r\nsince the Mediterranean was peopled with nearly all the living species of\r\ntestacea and zoophytes. We may therefore presume that, before this region\r\nemerged, the same land and river shells, and almost all the same animals\r\nand plants, were in existence which now people Sicily; for the terrestrial\r\nfauna and flora of this island are precisely the same as that of other\r\nlands surrounding the Mediterranean. There appear to be no peculiar or\r\nindigenous species, and those which are now established there must be\r\nsupposed to have migrated from pre-existing lands, just as the plants and\r\nanimals of the Neapolitan territory have colonised Monte Nuovo, since that\r\nvolcanic cone was thrown up in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nSuch conclusions throw a new light on the adaptation of the attributes\r\nand migratory habits of animals and plants to the changes which are\r\nunceasingly in progress in the physical geography of the globe. It is\r\nclear that the duration of species is so great, that they are destined\r\nto outlive many important revolutions in the configuration of the\r\nearth's surface; and hence those innumerable contrivances for enabling\r\nthe subjects of the animal and vegetable creation to extend their range;\r\nthe inhabitants of the land being often carried across the ocean, and\r\nthe aquatic tribes over great continental spaces. It is obviously\r\nexpedient that the terrestrial and fluviatile species should not only be\r\nfitted for the rivers, valleys, plains, and mountains which exist at the\r\nera of their creation, but for others that are destined to be formed\r\nbefore the species shall become extinct; and, in like manner, the marine\r\nspecies are not only made for the deep and shallow regions of the ocean\r\nexisting at the time when they are called into being, but for tracts\r\nthat may be submerged or variously altered in depth during the time that\r\nis allotted for their continuance on the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSSEOUS BRECCIAS AND DEPOSITS IN CAVES OF THE PLIOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_Sicily._--Caverns filled with marine breccias, at the base of ancient\r\nsea-cliffs, have been already mentioned in the sixth chapter; and it was\r\nnoticed, respecting the cave of San Ciro, near Palermo (p. 75.), that upon\r\na bed of sand filled with sea-shells, almost all of recent species, rests\r\na breccia (_b_, fig. 93.), composed of fragments of calcareous rock, and\r\nthe bones of animals. In the sand at the bottom of that cave, Dr. Philippi\r\nfound about forty-five marine shells, all clearly identical with recent\r\nspecies, except two or three. The bones in the incumbent breccia are\r\nchiefly those of the mammoth (_E. primigenius_), with some belonging to an\r\nhippopotamus, distinct from the recent species, and smaller than that\r\nusually found fossil. (See fig. 132.) Several species of deer also, and,\r\naccording to some accounts, the remains of a bear, were discovered. These\r\nmammalia are probably referable to the Post-Pliocene period.\r\n\r\nThe Newer Pliocene tertiary limestone of the south of Sicily, already\r\ndescribed, is sometimes full of caverns; and the student will at once\r\nperceive that all the quadrupeds of which the remains are found in the\r\nstalactite of these caverns, being of later origin than the rocks, must be\r\nreferable to the close of the tertiary epoch, if not of still later date.\r\nThe situation of one of these caves, in the valley of Sortino, is\r\nrepresented in the annexed section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125. Cross section.\r\n\r\n  _a_. Alluvium,                 } containing the remains of quadrupeds\r\n  _b_, _b_. Deposits in caves,   } for the most part extinct.\r\n\r\n  C. Limestone, containing the remains of shells, of which between 70 and\r\n                80 per cent. are recent.]\r\n\r\n_England._--In a cave at Kirkdale, about twenty-five miles N.N.E. of York,\r\nthe remains of about 300 hyaenas, belonging to individuals of every age,\r\nhave been detected. The species (_Hyaena spelaea_) is extinct, and was larger\r\nthan the fierce _Hyaena crocuta_ of South Africa, which it most resembled.\r\nDr. Buckland, after carefully examining the spot, proved that the Hyaenas\r\nmust have lived there; a fact attested by the quantity of their dung,\r\nwhich, as in the case of the living hyaena, is of nearly the same\r\ncomposition as bone, and almost as durable. In the cave were found the\r\nremains of the ox, young elephant, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, horse, bear,\r\nwolf, hare, water-rat, and several birds. All the bones have the appearance\r\nof having been broken and gnawed by the teeth of the hyaenas; and they occur\r\nconfusedly mixed in loam or mud, or dispersed through a crust of stalagmite\r\nwhich covers it. In these and many other cases it is supposed that portions\r\nof herbivorous quadrupeds have been dragged into caverns by beasts of prey,\r\nand have served as their food, an opinion quite consistent with the known\r\nhabits of the living hyaena.\r\n\r\nNo less than thirty-seven species of mammalia are enumerated by Professor\r\nOwen as having been discovered in the caves of the British islands, of\r\nwhich eighteen appear to be extinct, while the others still survive in\r\nEurope. They were not washed to the spots where the fossils now occur by a\r\ngreat flood; but lived and died, one generation after another, in the\r\nplaces where they lie buried. Among other arguments in favour of this\r\nconclusion may be mentioned the great numbers of the shed antlers of deer\r\ndiscovered in caves and in freshwater strata throughout England.[155-A]\r\n\r\nExamples also occur of fissures into which animals have fallen from time to\r\ntime, or have been washed in from above, together with alluvial matter and\r\nfragments of rock detached by frost, forming a mass which may be united\r\ninto a bony breccia by stalagmitic infiltrations. Frequently we discover a\r\nlong suite of caverns connected by narrow and irregular galleries, which\r\nhold a tortuous course through the interior of mountains, and seem to have\r\nserved as the subterranean channels of springs and engulphed rivers. Many\r\nstreams in the Morea are now carrying bones, pebbles, and mud into\r\nunderground passages of this kind.[155-B] If, at some future period, the\r\nform of that country should be wholly altered by subterranean movements and\r\nnew valleys shaped out by denudation, many portions of the former channels\r\nof these engulphed streams may communicate with the surface, and become the\r\ndens of wild beasts, or the recesses to which quadrupeds retreat to die.\r\nCertain caves of France, Germany, and Belgium, may have passed successively\r\nthrough these different conditions, and in their last state may have\r\nremained open to the day for several tertiary periods. It is nevertheless\r\nremarkable, that on the continent of Europe, as in England, the fossil\r\nremains of mammalia belong almost exclusively to those of the Newer\r\nPliocene and Post-Pliocene periods, and not to the Miocene or Eocene\r\nepochs, and when they are accompanied by land or river shells, these agree\r\nin great part, or entirely, with recent species.\r\n\r\nAs the preservation of the fossil bones is due to a slow and constant\r\nsupply of stalactite, brought into the caverns by water dropping from the\r\nroof, the source and origin of this deposit has been a subject of curious\r\ninquiry. The following explanation of the phenomenon has been recently\r\nsuggested by the eminent chemist Liebig. On the surface of Franconia, where\r\nthe limestone abounds in caverns, is a fertile soil, in which vegetable\r\nmatter is continually decaying. This mould or humus, being acted on by\r\nmoisture and air, evolves carbonic acid which is dissolved by rain. The\r\nrain water, thus impregnated, permeates the porous limestone, dissolves a\r\nportion of it, and afterwards, when the excess of carbonic acid evaporates\r\nin the caverns, parts with the calcareous matter, and forms stalactite.\r\n\r\n_Australian cave-breccias._--Ossiferous breccias are not confined to\r\nEurope, but occur in all parts of the globe; and those lately discovered\r\nin fissures and caverns in Australia correspond closely in character\r\nwith what has been called the bony breccia of the Mediterranean, in\r\nwhich the fragments of bone and rock are firmly bound together by a\r\nred ochreous cement.\r\n\r\nSome of these caves have been examined by Sir T. Mitchell in the Wellington\r\nValley, about 210 miles west of Sidney, on the river Bell, one of the\r\nprincipal sources of the Macquarie, and on the Macquarie itself. The\r\ncaverns often branch off in different directions through the rock, widening\r\nand contracting their dimensions, and the roofs and floors are covered with\r\nstalactite. The bones are often broken, but do not seem to be water-worn.\r\nIn some places they lie imbedded in loose earth, but they are usually\r\nincluded in a breccia.\r\n\r\nThe remains found most abundantly are those of the kangaroo, of which there\r\nare four species, besides which the genera _Hypsiprymnus_, _Phalangista_,\r\n_Phascolomys_, and _Dasyurus_, occur. There are also bones, formerly\r\nconjectured by some osteologists to belong to the hippopotamus, and by\r\nothers to the dugong, but which are now referred by Mr. Owen to a marsupial\r\ngenus, allied to the _Wombat_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126. _Macropus atlas_, Owen.\r\n\r\n_a._ permanent false molar, in the alveolus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127. Lowest jaw of largest living species of kangaroo.\r\n(_Macropus major._)]\r\n\r\nIn the fossils above enumerated, several species are larger than the\r\nlargest living ones of the same genera now known in Australia. The annexed\r\nfigure of the right side of a lower jaw of a kangaroo (_Macropus atlas_,\r\nOwen) will at once be seen to exceed in magnitude the corresponding part of\r\nthe largest living kangaroo, which is represented in fig. 127. In both\r\nthese specimens part of the substance of the jaw has been broken open, so\r\nas to show the permanent false molar (_a._ fig. 126.) concealed in the\r\nsocket. From the fact of this molar not having been cut, we learn that the\r\nindividual was young, and had not shed its first teeth. In fig. 128. a\r\nfront tooth of the same species of kangaroo is represented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128. Incisor of _Macropus_.]\r\n\r\nWhether the breccias, above alluded to, of the Wellington Valley, appertain\r\nstrictly to the Pliocene period cannot be affirmed with certainty, until we\r\nare more thoroughly acquainted with the recent quadrupeds of the same\r\ndistrict, and until we learn what species of fossil land shells, if any,\r\nare buried in the deposits of the same caves.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that all these extinct quadrupeds of Australia\r\nbelong to the marsupial family, or, in other words, that they are referable\r\nto the same peculiar type of organization which now distinguishes the\r\nAustralian mammalia from those of other parts of the globe. This fact is\r\none of many pointing to a general law deducible from the fossil vertebrate\r\nand invertebrate animals of the eras immediately antecedent to the human,\r\nnamely, that the present geographical distribution of organic _forms_ dates\r\nback to a period anterior to the creation of existing _species_; in other\r\nwords, the limitation of particular genera or families of quadrupeds,\r\nmollusca, &c., to certain existing provinces of land and sea, began before\r\nthe species now contemporary with man had been introduced into the earth.\r\n\r\nMr. Owen, in his excellent \"History of British Fossil Mammals,\" has called\r\nattention to this law, remarking that the fossil quadrupeds of Europe and\r\nAsia differ from those of Australia or South America. We do not find, for\r\nexample, in the Europaeo-Asiatic province fossil kangaroos or armadillos,\r\nbut the elephant, rhinoceros, horse, bear, hyaena, beaver, hare, mole, and\r\nothers, which still characterize the same continent.\r\n\r\nIn like manner in the Pampas of South America the skeletons of Megatherium,\r\nMegalonyx, Glyptodon, Mylodon, Toxodon, Macrauchenia, and other extinct\r\nforms, are analogous to the living sloth, armadillo, cavy, capybara, and\r\nllama. The fossil quadrumana, also associated with some of these forms in\r\nthe Brazilian caves, belong to the Platyrrhine family of monkeys, now\r\npeculiar to South America. That the extinct fauna of Buenos Ayres and\r\nBrazil was very modern has been shown by its relation to deposits of marine\r\nshells, agreeing with those now inhabiting the Atlantic; and when in\r\nGeorgia in 1845, I ascertained that the Megatherium, Mylodon, _Harlanus\r\namericanus_ (Owen), _Equus curvidens_, and other quadrupeds allied to the\r\nPampean type were posterior in date to beds containing marine shells\r\nbelonging to forty-five recent species of the neighbouring sea.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed some cosmopolite genera, such as the Mastodon (a genus of\r\nthe elephant family), and the horse, which were simultaneously represented\r\nby different fossil species in Europe, North America, and South America;\r\nbut these few exceptions can by no means invalidate the rule which has been\r\nthus expressed by Professor Owen, \"that in the highest organized class of\r\nanimals the same forms were restricted to the same great provinces at the\r\nPliocene periods as they are at the present day.\"\r\n\r\nHowever modern, in a geological point of view, we may consider the\r\nPleistocene epoch, it is evident that causes more general and powerful\r\nthan the intervention of man have occasioned the disappearance of the\r\nancient fauna from so many extensive regions. Not a few of the species\r\nhad a wide range; the same Megatherium, for instance, extended from\r\nPatagonia and the river Plata in South America, between latitudes 31 deg.\r\nand 39 deg. south, to corresponding latitudes in North America, the same\r\nanimal being also an inhabitant of the intermediate country of Brazil,\r\nwhere its fossil remains have been met with in caves. The extinct\r\nelephant, likewise, of Georgia (_Elephas primigenius_) has been traced\r\nin a fossil state northward from the river Alatamaha, in lat. 33 deg. 50' N.\r\nto the polar regions, and then again in the eastern hemisphere from\r\nSiberia to the south of Europe. If it be objected that, notwithstanding\r\nthe adaptation of such quadrupeds to a variety of climates and\r\ngeographical conditions, their great size exposed them to extermination\r\nby the first hunter tribes, we may observe that the investigations of\r\nLund and Clausen in the ossiferous limestone caves of Brazil have\r\ndemonstrated that these large mammalia were associated with a great many\r\nsmaller quadrupeds, some of them as diminutive as field mice, which have\r\nall died out together, while the land shells formerly their\r\ncontemporaries still continue to exist in the same countries. As we may\r\nfeel assured that these minute quadrupeds could never have been\r\nextirpated by man, so we may conclude that all the species, small and\r\ngreat, have been annihilated one after the other, in the course of\r\nindefinite ages, by those changes of circumstances in the organic and\r\ninorganic world which are always in progress, and are capable in the\r\ncourse of time of greatly modifying the physical geography, climate, and\r\nall other conditions on which the continuance upon the earth of any\r\nliving being must depend.[158-A]\r\n\r\nThe law of geographical relationship above alluded to, between the\r\nliving vertebrata of every great zoological province and the fossils of\r\nthe period immediately antecedent, even where the fossil species are\r\nextinct, is by no means confined to the mammalia. New Zealand, when\r\nfirst examined by Europeans, was found to contain no indigenous land\r\nquadrupeds, no kangaroos, or opossums, like Australia; but a wingless\r\nbird abounded there, the smallest living representative of the ostrich\r\nfamily, called the Xivi, by the natives (_Apteryx_). In the fossils of\r\nthe Post-Pliocene and Pleistocene period in this same island, there is\r\nthe like absence of kangaroos, opossums, wombats, and the rest; but in\r\ntheir place a prodigious number of well preserved specimens of gigantic\r\nbirds of the struthious order, called by Owen Dinornis and Palapteryx,\r\nwhich are entombed in superficial deposits. These genera comprehended\r\nmany species, some of which were 4, some 7, others 9, and others 11 feet\r\nin height! It seems doubtful whether any contemporary mammalia shared\r\nthe land with this population of gigantic feathered bipeds.\r\n\r\nTo those who have never studied comparative anatomy it may seem scarcely\r\ncredible, that a single bone taken from any part of the skeleton may enable\r\na skilful osteologist to distinguish, in many cases, the genus, and\r\nsometimes the species, of quadruped to which it belonged. Although few\r\ngeologists can aspire to such knowledge, which must be the result of long\r\npractice and study, they will nevertheless derive great advantage from\r\nlearning what is comparatively an easy task, to distinguish the principal\r\ndivisions of the mammalia by the forms and characters of their teeth. The\r\nannexed figures, all taken from original specimens, may be useful in\r\nassisting the student to recognize the teeth of many genera most frequently\r\nfound fossil in Europe:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129. _Elephas primigenius_ (or Mammoth); molar of upper\r\njaw, right side; one third of nat. size.\r\n\r\n  _a._ grinding surface.\r\n  _b._ side view.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130. _Mastodon angustidens_ (Norwich Crag, Postwick,\r\nalso found in Red Crag, see p. 149.); second true molar, left side, upper\r\njaw; grinding surface, nat. size.

The relative position of the \"red crag\" in\r\nEssex to the London clay, may be understood by reference to the\r\naccompanying diagram (fig. 142.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nThese deposits, judging by the shells which they contain, appear, according\r\nto Professor Edward Forbes, to have been formed in a sea of moderate depth,\r\ngenerally from 15 to 25 fathoms deep, although in some few spots perhaps\r\ndeeper. But they may, nevertheless, have been accumulated at the distance\r\nof 40 or 50 miles from land.\r\n\r\nThe Suffolk crag is divisible into two masses, the upper of which has been\r\ntermed the Red, and the lower the Coralline Crag.[162-A] The upper deposit\r\nconsists chiefly of quartzose sand, with an occasional intermixture of\r\nshells, for the most part rolled, and sometimes comminuted. The lower or\r\nCoralline crag is of very limited extent, ranging over an area about 20\r\nmiles in length, and 3 or 4 in breadth, between the rivers Alde and Stour.\r\nIt is generally calcareous and marly--a mass of shells and small corals,\r\npassing occasionally into a soft building stone. At Sudbourn, near Orford,\r\nwhere it assumes this character, are large quarries, in which the bottom of\r\nit has not been reached at the depth of 50 feet. At some places in the\r\nneighbourhood, the softer mass is divided by thin flags of hard limestone,\r\nand corals placed in the upright position in which they grew.\r\n\r\nThe Red crag is distinguished by the deep ferruginous or ochreous colour of\r\nits sands and fossils, the Coralline by its white colour. Both formations\r\nare of moderate thickness; the red crag rarely exceeding 40, and the\r\ncoralline seldom amounting to 20, feet. But their importance is not to be\r\nestimated by the density of the mass of strata or its geographical extent,\r\nbut by the extraordinary richness of its organic remains, belonging to a\r\nvery peculiar type, which seems to characterize the state of the living\r\ncreation in the north of Europe during the older Pliocene era.\r\n\r\nFor a large collection of the fish, echinoderms, shells, and corals of the\r\ndeposits in Suffolk, we are indebted to the labours of Mr. Searles Wood. Of\r\ntestacea alone he has obtained from 230 species from the Red, and 345 from\r\nthe Coralline crag, about 150 being common to each. The proportion of\r\nrecent species in the new group is considered by Mr. Wood to be about\r\n70[162-B] per cent., and that in the older or coralline about 60. When I\r\nexamined these shells of Suffolk in 1835, with the assistance of Dr. Beck,\r\nMr. George Sowerby, Mr. Searles Wood, and other eminent conchologists, I\r\ncame to the opinion that the extinct species predominated very decidedly in\r\nnumber over the living. Recent investigations, however, have thrown much\r\nnew light on the conchology of the Arctic, Scandinavian, British, and\r\nMediterranean Seas. Many of the species formerly known only as fossils of\r\nthe Crag, and supposed to have died out, have been dredged up in a living\r\nstate from depths not previously explored. Other recent species, before\r\nregarded as distinct from the nearest allied Crag fossils, have been\r\nobserved, when numerous individuals were procured, to be liable to much\r\ngreater variation, both in size and form, than had been suspected, and thus\r\nhave been identified. Consequently, the Crag fauna has been found to\r\napproach much more nearly to the recent fauna of the Northern, British, and\r\nMediterranean Seas than had been imagined. The analogy of the whole group\r\nof testacea to the European type is very marked, whether we refer to the\r\nlarge development of certain genera in number of species or to their size,\r\nor to the suppression or feeble representation of others. The indication\r\nalso afforded by the entire fauna of a climate not much warmer than that\r\nnow prevailing in corresponding latitudes, prepares us to believe that they\r\nare not of higher antiquity than the Older Pliocene era.[163-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143. Section near Ipswich, in Suffolk.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Red crag.\r\n  _b._ Coralline crag.\r\n  _c._ London clay.]\r\n\r\nThe position of the red crag in Essex to the subjacent London clay and\r\nchalk has been already pointed out (fig. 142.). Whenever the two\r\ndivisions are met with in the same district, the red crag lies\r\nuppermost; and, in some cases, as in the section represented in fig.\r\n143., it is observed that the older or coralline mass _b_ had suffered\r\ndenudation before the newer formation _a_ was thrown down upon it. At D\r\nthere is not only a distinct cliff, 8 or 10 feet high, of coralline\r\ncrag, running in a direction N.E. and S.W., against which the red crag\r\nabuts with its horizontal layers; but this cliff occasionally overhangs.\r\nThe rock composing it is drilled everywhere by _Pholades_, the holes\r\nwhich they perforated having been afterwards filled with sand and\r\ncovered over when the newer beds were thrown down. As the older\r\nformation is shown by its fossils to have accumulated in a deeper sea\r\n(15, and sometimes 25, fathoms deep or more), there must no doubt have\r\nbeen an upheaval of the sea-bottom before the cliff here alluded to was\r\nshaped out. We may also conclude that so great an amount of denudation\r\ncould scarcely take place, in such incoherent materials, without many of\r\nthe fossils of the inferior beds becoming mixed up with the overlying\r\ncrag, so that considerable difficulty must be occasionally experienced\r\nby the palaeontologist in deciding which species belong severally to each\r\ngroup. The red crag being formed in a shallower sea, often resembles in\r\nstructure a shifting sand bank, its layers being inclined diagonally,\r\nand the planes of stratification being sometimes directed in the same\r\nquarry to the four cardinal points of the compass, as at Butley. That\r\nin this and many other localities, such a structure is not deceptive or\r\ndue to any subsequent concretionary re-arrangement of particles, or to\r\nmere lines of colour, is proved by each bed being made up of flat pieces\r\nof shell which lie parallel to the planes of the smaller strata.\r\n\r\nSome fossils, which are very abundant in the red crag, have never been\r\nfound in the white or coralline division; as, for example, the _Fusus\r\ncontrarius_ (fig. 144.), and several species of _Buccinum_ (or _Nassa_)\r\nand _Murex_ (see figs. 145, 146.), which two genera seem wanting in\r\nthe lower crag.\r\n\r\n[4 Illustrations: Fossils characteristic of the Red Crag.\r\n\r\nFig. 144. _Fusus contrarius._\r\n\r\nFig. 145. _Murex alveolatus._\r\n\r\nFig. 146. _Nassa granulata._\r\n\r\nFig. 147. _Cypraea coccinelloides._\r\n\r\nFig. 144. half nat. size; the others nat. size.]\r\n\r\nAmong the bones and teeth of fishes are those of large sharks\r\n(_Carcharias_), and a gigantic skate of the extinct genus _Myliobates_, and\r\nmany other forms, some common to our seas, and many foreign to them.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness of the fossils of the coralline crag arises in part from\r\nhigher antiquity, and, in some degree, from a difference in the\r\ngeographical conditions of the submarine bottom. The prolific growth of\r\ncorals, echini, and a prodigious variety of testacea, implies a region of\r\ndeeper and more tranquil water; whereas, the red crag may have formed\r\nafterwards on the same spot, when the water was shallower. In the mean time\r\nthe climate may have become somewhat cooler, and some of the zoophytes\r\nwhich flourished in the first period may have disappeared, so that the\r\nfauna of the red crag acquired a character somewhat more nearly resembling\r\nthat of our northern seas, as is implied by the large development of\r\ncertain sections of the genera _Fusus_, _Buccinum_, _Purpura_, and\r\n_Trochus_, proper to higher latitudes, and which are wanting or feebly\r\nrepresented in the inferior crag.\r\n\r\nSome of the corals of the lower crag of Suffolk belong to genera unknown in\r\nthe living creation, and of a very peculiar structure; as, for example,\r\nthat represented in the annexed fig. (148.), which is one of several\r\nspecies having a globular form. The great number and variety of these\r\nzoophytes probably indicate an equable climate, free from intense cold in\r\nwinter. On the other hand, that the heat was never excessive is confirmed\r\nby the prevalence of northern forms among the testacea, such as the\r\n_Glycimeris_, _Cyprina_, and _Astarte_. Of the genus last mentioned (see\r\nfig. 149.) there are about fourteen species, many of them being rich in\r\nindividuals; and there is an absence of genera peculiar to hot climates,\r\nsuch as _Conus_, _Oliva_, _Mitra_, _Fasciolaria_, _Crassatella_, and\r\nothers. The cowries (_Cypraea_, fig. 147.), also, are small, and belong to a\r\nsection (_Trivia_) now inhabiting the colder regions. A large volute,\r\ncalled _Voluta Lamberti_ (fig. 150.), may seem an exception; but it differs\r\nin form from the volutes of the torrid zone, and may, like the living\r\n_Voluta Magellanica_, have been fitted for an extra-tropical climate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148. _Fascicularia aurantium_, Milne Edwards.

Whether, therefore, we may incline to the\r\nbelief that the mean annual temperature was higher or lower than now,\r\nwe may at least infer that the climate and geographical conditions were\r\nby no means the same at the period of the Suffolk crag as those now\r\nprevailing in the same region.\r\n\r\nOf the echinoderms of the coralline crag about eleven species are known,\r\nbut some of these are in too fragmentary a condition to admit of exact\r\ncomparison. Of six which are the most perfect, Prof. E. Forbes has been\r\nable to identify three with recent species: one of which, of the genus\r\n_Echinus_, is British; a second, _Echinocyamus_, British and Mediterranean;\r\nand a third, _Echinus monilis_, a Mediterranean species, also found fossil\r\nin the faluns of Touraine.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting conclusions deduced from a careful comparison\r\nof the shells of these British Older Pliocene strata and those now\r\ninhabiting our seas, has been pointed out by Prof. E. Forbes. It appears\r\nthat, during the glacial period, a period intermediate, as we have seen,\r\nbetween that of the crag and our own times, many shells, previously\r\nestablished in the temperate zone, retreated southwards to avoid an\r\nuncongenial climate. The Professor has given a list of fifty shells which\r\ninhabited the British seas while the coralline and red crag were forming,\r\nand which are wanting in the Pleistocene or glacial deposits. They must,\r\ntherefore, after their migration to the south, have made their way\r\nnorthwards again. In corroboration of these views, it is stated that all\r\nthese fifty species occur fossil in the Newer Pliocene strata of Sicily,\r\nSouthern Italy, and the Grecian Archipelago, where they may have enjoyed,\r\nduring the era of floating icebergs, a climate resembling that now\r\nprevailing in higher European latitudes.[166-A]\r\n\r\nIn the red crag at Felixstow, in Suffolk, Professor Henslow has found the\r\near-bones of no less than four species of cetacea, which, according to Mr.\r\nOwen, are the remains of true whales of the family _Balaenidae_. Mr. Wood is\r\nof opinion that these cetacea may be of the age of the red crag, or if not\r\nthat they may be derived from the destruction of beds of coralline crag. I\r\nagree with him that the supposition of their having been washed out of the\r\nLondon clay, in which no _Balaenidae_ have yet been met with, is improbable.\r\n\r\nStrata containing fossil shells, like those of the Suffolk crag, above\r\ndescribed, have been found at Antwerp, and on the banks of the Scheldt\r\nbelow that city. In 1840 I observed a small patch of them near Valognes, in\r\nNormandy; and there is also a deposit containing similar fossils at St.\r\nGeorge Bohon, and several places a few leagues to the S. of Carentan, in\r\nNormandy; but they have never been traced farther southwards.\r\n\r\n_Subapennine strata._--The Apennines, it is well known, are composed\r\nchiefly of secondary rocks, forming a chain which branches off from the\r\nLigurian Alps and passes down the middle of the Italian peninsula. At the\r\nfoot of these mountains, on the side both of the Adriatic and the\r\nMediterranean, are found a series of tertiary strata, which form, for the\r\nmost part, a line of low hills occupying the space between the older chain\r\nand the sea. Brocchi, as we have seen (p. 105.), was the first Italian\r\ngeologist who described this newer group in detail, giving it the name of\r\nthe Subapennines; and he classed all the tertiary strata of Italy, from\r\nPiedmont to Calabria, as parts of the same system. Certain mineral\r\ncharacters, he observed, were common to the whole; for the strata consist\r\ngenerally of light brown or blue marl, covered by yellow calcareous sand\r\nand gravel. There are also, he added, some species of fossil shells which\r\nare found in these deposits throughout the whole of Italy.\r\n\r\nWe have now, however, satisfactory evidence that the Subapennine beds of\r\nBrocchi belong, at least, to three periods. To the Miocene we can refer a\r\nportion of the strata of Piedmont, those of the hill of the Superga, for\r\nexample; to the Older Pliocene, part of the strata of northern Italy, of\r\nTuscany, and of Rome; while the tufaceous formations of Naples, of Ischia,\r\nand the calcareous strata of Otranto, are referable to the Newer Pliocene,\r\nand in great part to the Post-Pliocene period.\r\n\r\nThat there is a considerable correspondence in the mineral composition of\r\nthese different Italian groups is undeniable; but not that exact\r\nresemblance which should lead us to assume a precise identity of age,\r\nunless the fossil remains agreed very closely. It is now indispensable that\r\na new scrutiny should be made in each particular district, of the fossils\r\nderived from the upper and lower beds--especially such localities as Asti\r\nand Parma, where the formation attains a great thickness; and at Sienna,\r\nwhere the shells of the incumbent yellow sand are generally believed to\r\napproach much more nearly, as a whole, to the recent fauna of the\r\nMediterranean than those in the subjacent blue marl.\r\n\r\nThe greyish brown or blue marl of the Subapennine formation is very\r\naluminous, and usually contains much calcareous matter and scales of mica.\r\nNear Parma it attains a thickness of 2000 feet, and is charged throughout\r\nwith marine shells, some of which lived in deep, others in shallow water,\r\nwhile a few belong to freshwater genera, and must have been washed in by\r\nrivers. Among these last I have seen the common _Limnea palustris_ in the\r\nblue marl, filled with small marine shells. The wood and leaves, which\r\noccasionally form beds of lignite in the same deposit, may have been\r\ncarried into the sea by similar causes. The shells, in general, are soft\r\nwhen first taken from the marl, but they become hard when dried. The\r\nsuperficial enamel is often well preserved, and many shells retain their\r\npearly lustre, part of their external colour, and even the ligament which\r\nunites the valves. No shells are more usually perfect than the microscopic\r\nforaminifera, which abound near Sienna, where more than a thousand\r\nfull-grown individuals may be sometimes poured out of the interior of a\r\nsingle univalve of moderate dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe other member of the Subapennine group, the yellow sand and\r\nconglomerate, constitutes, in most places, a border formation near the\r\njunction of the tertiary and secondary rocks. In some cases, as near the\r\ntown of Sienna, we see sand and calcareous gravel resting immediately on\r\nthe Apennine limestone, without the intervention of any blue marl.\r\nAlternations are there seen of beds containing fluviatile shells, with\r\nothers filled exclusively with marine species; and I observed oysters\r\nattached to many limestone pebbles. This appears to have been a point\r\nwhere a river, flowing from the Apennines, entered the sea when the\r\ntertiary strata were formed.\r\n\r\nThe sand passes in some districts into a calcareous sandstone, as at San\r\nVignone. Its general superposition to the marl, even in parts of Italy and\r\nSicily where the date of its origin is very distinct, may be explained if\r\nwe consider that it may represent the deltas of rivers and torrents, which\r\ngained upon the bed of the sea where blue marl had previously been\r\ndeposited. The latter, being composed of the finer and more transportable\r\nmud, would be conveyed to a distance, and first occupy the bottom, over\r\nwhich sand and pebbles would afterwards be spread, in proportion as rivers\r\npushed their deltas farther outwards. In some large tracts of yellow sand\r\nit is impossible to detect a single fossil, while in other places they\r\noccur in profusion. Occasionally the shells are silicified, as at San\r\nVitale, near Parma, from whence I saw two individuals of recent species,\r\none freshwater and the other marine (_Limnea palustris_, and _Cytherea\r\nconcentrica_, Lam.), both perfectly converted into flint.\r\n\r\n_Rome._--The seven hills of Rome are composed partly of marine tertiary\r\nstrata, those of Monte Mario, for example, of the Older Pliocene period,\r\nand partly of superimposed volcanic tuff, on the top of which are usually\r\ncappings of a fluviatile and lacustrine deposit. Thus, on Mount Aventine,\r\nthe Vatican, and the Capitol, we find beds of calcareous tufa with\r\nincrusted reeds, and recent terrestrial shells, at the height of about 200\r\nfeet above the alluvial plain of the Tiber. The tusk of the mammoth has\r\nbeen procured from this formation, but the shells appear to be all of\r\nliving species, and must have been embedded when the summit of the Capitol\r\nwas a marsh, and constituted one of the lowest hollows of the country as it\r\nthen existed. It is not without interest that we thus discover the\r\nextremely recent date of a geological event which preceded an historical\r\nera so remote as the building of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIOCENE FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\n_Faluns of Touraine._--The Miocene strata, corresponding with those named\r\nby many geologists \"Middle Tertiary,\" will next claim our attention. Near\r\nthe towns of Dinan and Rennes, in Brittany, and again in the provinces\r\nbordering the Loire, a tertiary formation, containing another assemblage of\r\nfossils, is met with, to which the name of _Faluns_ has been long given by\r\nthe French agriculturists, who spread the shelly sand and marl over the\r\nland, in the same manner as the crag was formerly much used in Suffolk.\r\nIsolated masses of these faluns occur from near the mouth of the Loire,\r\nnear Nantes, as far as a district south of Tours. They are also found at\r\nPontlevoy, on the Cher, about 70 miles above the junction of that river\r\nwith the Loire, and 30 miles S.E. of Tours. I have visited all the\r\nlocalities above mentioned, and found the beds to consist principally of\r\nsand and marl, in which are shells and corals, some entire, some rolled,\r\nand others in minute fragments. In certain districts, as at Doue, in the\r\ndepartment of Maine and Loire, 10 miles S.W. of Saumur, they form a soft\r\nbuilding-stone, chiefly composed of an aggregate of broken shells, corals,\r\nand echinoderms, united by a calcareous cement; the whole mass being very\r\nlike the coralline crag near Aldborough and Sudbourn in Suffolk. The\r\nscattered patches of faluns are of slight thickness, rarely exceeding 50\r\nfeet; and between the district called Sologne and the sea they repose on a\r\ngreat variety of older rocks; being seen to rest successively upon gneiss,\r\nclay-slate, and various secondary formations, including the chalk; and,\r\nlastly, upon the upper freshwater limestone of the Parisian tertiary\r\nseries, which, as before mentioned (p. 106.), stretches continuously from\r\nthe basin of the Seine to that of the Loire.\r\n\r\nAt some points, as at Louans, south of Tours, the shells are stained of a\r\nferruginous colour, not unlike that of the red crag of Suffolk. The species\r\nare, for the most part, marine, but a few of them belong to land and\r\nfluviatile genera. Among the former, _Helix turonensis_ (fig. 45. p. 30.)\r\nis the most abundant. Remains of terrestrial quadrupeds are here and there\r\nintermixed, belonging to the genera Deinotherium, Mastodon, Rhinoceros,\r\nHippopotamus, Chaeropotamus, Dichobune, Deer, and others, and these are\r\naccompanied by cetacea, such as the Lamantine, Morse, Sea-calf, and\r\nDolphin, all of extinct species.\r\n\r\nProfessor E. Forbes, after studying the fossil testacea which I obtained\r\nfrom these beds; informs me that he has no doubt they were formed partly on\r\nthe shore itself at the level of low water, and partly at very moderate\r\ndepths, not exceeding 10 fathoms below that level. The molluscous fauna of\r\nthe \"faluns\" is on the whole much more littoral than that of the red and\r\ncoralline crag of Suffolk, and implies a shallower sea. It is, moreover,\r\ncontrasted with the Suffolk crag by the indications it affords of an\r\nextra-European climate. Thus it contains seven species of _Cypraea_, some\r\nlarger than any existing cowry of the Mediterranean, several species of\r\n_Oliva_, _Ancillaria_, _Mitra_, _Terebra_, _Pyrula_, _Fasciolaria_, and\r\n_Conus_. Of the cones there are no less than eight species, some very\r\nlarge, whereas the only European cone is of diminutive size. The genus\r\n_Nerita_, and many others, are also represented by individuals of a type\r\nnow characteristic of equatorial seas, and wholly unlike any Mediterranean\r\nforms. These proofs of a more elevated temperature seem to imply the higher\r\nantiquity of the faluns as compared with the Suffolk crag, and are in\r\nperfect accordance with the fact of the smaller proportion of testacea of\r\nrecent species found in the faluns.\r\n\r\nOut of 290 species of shells, collected by myself, in 1840, at\r\nPontlevoy, Louans, Bossee, and other villages 20 miles south of Tours;\r\nand at Savigne, about 15 miles north-west of that place; 72 only could\r\nbe identified with recent species, which is in the proportion of 25 per\r\ncent. A large number of the 290 species are common to all the\r\nlocalities, those peculiar to each not being more numerous than we might\r\nexpect to find in different bays of the same sea.\r\n\r\nThe total number of mollusca from the faluns, in my possession, is 302,\r\nof which 45 only were found by Mr. Wood to be common to the Suffolk\r\ncrag. The number of corals obtained by me at Doue, and other localities\r\nbefore adverted to, amounts to 43, as determined by Mr. Lonsdale, of\r\nwhich 7 agree specifically with those of the Suffolk crag. Only one has,\r\nas yet, been identified with a living species. But it is difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, to institute at present a satisfactory comparison\r\nbetween fossil and recent _Polyparia_, from the deficiency of our\r\nknowledge of the living species. Some of the genera occurring fossil in\r\nTouraine, as the _Astrea_, _Lunulites_, and _Dendrophyllia_, have not\r\nbeen found in European seas north of the Mediterranean; nevertheless the\r\n_Polyparia_ of the faluns do not seem to indicate on the whole so warm a\r\nclimate as would be inferred from the shells.\r\n\r\nIt was stated that, on comparing about 300 species of Touraine shells\r\nwith about 450 from the Suffolk crag, 45 only were found to be common to\r\nboth, which is in the proportion of only 15 per cent. The same small\r\namount of agreement is found in the corals also. I formerly endeavoured\r\nto reconcile this marked difference in species with the supposed\r\nco-existence of the two faunas, by imagining them to have severally\r\nbelonged to distinct zoological provinces or two seas, the one opening\r\nto the north, and the other to the south, with a barrier of land between\r\nthem, like the Isthmus of Suez, separating the Red Sea and the\r\nMediterranean. But I now abandon that idea for several reasons;\r\namong others, because I succeeded in 1841 in tracing the Crag fauna\r\nsouthwards in Normandy to within 70 miles of the Falunian type, near\r\nDinan, yet found that both assemblages of fossils retained their\r\ndistinctive characters, showing no signs of any blending of species\r\nor transition of climate.\r\n\r\nOn a comparison of 280 Mediterranean shells with 600 British species, made\r\nfor me by an experienced conchologist in 1841, 160 were found to be common\r\nto both collections, which is in the proportion of 57 per cent., a fourfold\r\ngreater specific resemblance than between the seas of the crag and the\r\nfaluns, notwithstanding the greater geographical distance between England\r\nand the Mediterranean than between Suffolk and the Loire. The principal\r\ngrounds, however, for referring the English crag to the older Pliocene and\r\nthe French faluns to the Miocene epochs, consist in the predominance of\r\nfossil shells in the British strata identifiable with species, not only\r\nstill living, but which are now inhabitants of neighbouring seas, while the\r\naccompanying extinct species are of genera such as characterize Europe. In\r\nthe faluns, on the contrary, the recent species are in a decided minority,\r\nand many of them, like the associated extinct testacea, are much less\r\nEuropean in character, and point to the prevalence of a warmer climate,--in\r\nother words, to a state of things receding farther from the present\r\ncondition of Europe, geographically and climatologically, and doubtless,\r\ntherefore, receding farther in time.\r\n\r\n_Bordeaux._--A great extent of country between the Pyrenees and the Gironde\r\nis overspread by tertiary deposits, which have been more particularly\r\nstudied in the environs of Bordeaux and Dax, from whence about 700 species\r\nof shells have been obtained. A large proportion of these shells belong to\r\nthe same zoological type as those of Touraine; but many are peculiar, and\r\nthe whole may possibly constitute a somewhat older division of the Miocene\r\nperiod than the faluns of the Loire. We must wait, however, for farther\r\ninvestigations, in order to decide this question with accuracy.\r\n\r\n_Piedmont._--Many of the shells peculiar to the hill of the Superga, near\r\nTurin, agree with those found at Bordeaux and Dax; but the proportion of\r\nrecent species is much less. The strata of the Superga consist of a bright\r\ngreen sand and marl, and a conglomerate with pebbles, chiefly of green\r\nserpentine, and are inclined at an angle of more than 70 deg.. This formation,\r\nwhich attains a great thickness in the valley of the Bormida, is probably\r\none of the oldest Miocene groups hitherto discovered.\r\n\r\n_Molasse of Switzerland._--If we cross the Alps, and pass from Piedmont\r\nto Savoy, we find there, at the northern base of the great chain, and\r\nthroughout the lower country of Switzerland, a soft green sandstone much\r\nresembling some of the beds of the basin of the Bormida, above\r\ndescribed, and associated in a similar manner with marls and\r\nconglomerate. This formation is called in Switzerland \"molasse,\" said to\r\nbe derived from \"mol,\" \"_soft_\" because the stone is easily cut in the\r\nquarry. It is of vast thickness, and probably divisible into several\r\nformations. How large a portion of these belong to the Miocene period\r\ncannot yet be determined, as fossil shells are often entirely wanting.\r\nIn some places a decided agreement of the fossil fishes of the molasse\r\nand faluns has been observed. Among those common to both, M. Agassiz\r\npointed out to me _Lamna contortidens_, _Myliobates Studeri_, _Spherodus\r\ncinctus_, _Notidanus primigenius_, and others.\r\n\r\n_Lisbon._--Marine tertiary strata near Lisbon contain shells which agree\r\nvery closely with those of Bordeaux, and are therefore referred to the\r\nMiocene era. Thus, out of 112 species collected by Mr. Smith of Jordanhill,\r\nbetween 60 and 70 were found to be common to the strata of Bordeaux and\r\nDax, the recent species being in the proportion of 21 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Older Pliocene and Miocene formations in the United States._--Between the\r\nAlleghany mountains, formed of older rocks, and the Atlantic, there\r\nintervenes, in the United States, a low region occupied principally by beds\r\nof marl, clay, and sand, consisting of the cretaceous and tertiary\r\nformations, and chiefly of the latter. The general elevation of this plain\r\nbordering the Atlantic does not exceed 100 feet, although it is sometimes\r\nseveral hundred feet high. Its width in the middle and southern states is\r\nvery commonly from 100 to 150 miles. It consists, in the South, as in\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, and South Carolina, almost exclusively of Eocene\r\ndeposits; but in North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, more\r\nmodern strata predominate, which I have assimilated in age to the English\r\ncrag and Faluns of Touraine.[172-A] If, chronologically speaking, they can\r\nbe truly said to be the representatives of these two European formations,\r\nthey may range in age from the Older Pliocene to the Miocene epoch,\r\naccording to the classification of European strata adopted in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of fossil shells agreeing with recent, out of 147 species\r\ncollected by me, amounted to about 17 per cent., or one-sixth of the\r\nwhole; but as the fossils so assimilated were almost always the same as\r\nspecies now living in the neighbouring Atlantic, the number may\r\nhereafter be augmented, when the recent fauna of that ocean is better\r\nknown. In different localities, also, the proportion of recent\r\nspecies varied considerably.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151. _Fulgur canaliculatus._ Maryland.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152. _Fusus quadricostatus_, Say. Maryland.]\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the James River, in Virginia, about 20 miles below\r\nRichmond, in a cliff about 30 feet high, I observed yellow and white sands\r\noverlying an Eocene marl, just as the yellow sands of the crag lie on the\r\nblue London clay in Suffolk and Essex in England. In the Virginian sands,\r\nwe find a profusion of an Astarte (_A. undulata_, Conrad), which resembles\r\nclosely, and may possibly be a variety of, one of the commonest fossils of\r\nthe Suffolk crag (_A. bipartita_); the other shells also, of the genera\r\n_Natica_, _Fissurella_, _Artemis_, _Lucina_, _Chama_, _Pectunculus_, and\r\n_Pecten_, are analogous to shells both of the English crag and French\r\nfaluns, although the species are almost all distinct. Out of 147 of these\r\nAmerican fossils I could only find 13 species common to Europe, and these\r\noccur partly in the Suffolk crag, and partly in the faluns of Touraine; but\r\nit is an important characteristic of the American group, that it not only\r\ncontains many peculiar extinct forms, such as _Fusus quadricostatus_, Say\r\n(see fig. 152.), and _Venus tridacnoides_, abundant in these same\r\nformations, but also some shells which, like _Fulgur carica_ of Say, and\r\n_F. canaliculatus_ (see fig. 151.), _Calyptraea costata_, _Venus\r\nmercenaria_, Lam., _Modiola glandula_, Totten, and _Pecten magellanicus_,\r\nLam., are recent species, yet of forms now confined to the western side of\r\nthe Atlantic, a fact implying that the beginning of the present\r\ngeographical distribution of mollusca dates back to a period as remote as\r\nthat of the Miocene strata.\r\n\r\nOf ten species of zoophytes which I procured on the banks of the James\r\nRiver, two were identical with species of the Faluns of Touraine. With\r\nrespect to climate, Mr. Lonsdale regards these corals as indicating a\r\ntemperature exceeding that of the Mediterranean, and the shells would\r\nlead to similar conclusions. Those occurring on the James River are in\r\nthe 37th degree of N. latitude, while the French faluns are in the 47th;\r\nyet the forms of the American fossils would scarcely imply so warm a\r\nclimate as must have prevailed in France, when the Miocene strata\r\nof Touraine originated.\r\n\r\nAmong the remains of fish in these Post-Eocene strata of the United\r\nStates are several large teeth of the shark family, not distinguishable\r\nspecifically from fossils of the faluns of Touraine, and the\r\nMaltese tertiaries.\r\n\r\n_India._--The freshwater deposits of the Sub-Himalayan or Sewalik Hills,\r\ndescribed by Dr. Falconer and Captain Cautley, may perhaps be regarded as\r\nMiocene. Like the faluns of Touraine, they contain the Deinotherium and\r\nMastodon. Whether any of the associated freshwater and land shells are of\r\nrecent species is not yet determined. The occurrence in them of a fossil\r\ngiraffe and hippopotamus, genera now only living in Africa, as well as of a\r\ncamel, implies a geographical state of things very different from that now\r\nestablished in the same parts of India. The huge Sivatherium of the same\r\nera appears to have been a ruminating quadruped bigger than the rhinoceros,\r\nand provided with a large upper lip, or probably a short proboscis, and\r\nhaving two pair of horns, resembling those of antelopes. Several species of\r\nmonkey belonged to the same fauna; and among the reptiles, several\r\ncrocodiles, larger than any now living, and an enormous tortoise, _Testudo\r\nAtlas_, the curved shell of which measured 20 feet across.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[162-A] See paper by E.

Map of the principal tertiary basins of\r\nthe Eocene period.\r\n\r\nN. B. The space left blank is occupied by secondary formations from the\r\nDevonian or old red sandstone to the chalk inclusive.]\r\n\r\nThe tertiary strata described in the preceding chapters are all of them\r\ncharacterized by fossil shells, of which a considerable proportion are\r\nspecifically identical with the living mollusca; and the greater the\r\nnumber, the more nearly does the entire fauna approach in species and\r\ngenera to that now inhabiting the adjoining seas. But in the Eocene\r\nformations next to be considered, the proportion of recent species is very\r\nsmall, and sometimes scarcely appreciable, and those agreeing with the\r\nfossil testacea often belong to remote parts of the globe, and to various\r\nzoological provinces. This difference in conchological character implies a\r\nconsiderable interval of time between the Eocene and Miocene periods,\r\nduring which the whole fauna and flora underwent other changes as great,\r\nand often greater, than those exhibited by the mollusca. In the\r\naccompanying map, the position of several Eocene areas is pointed out, such\r\nas the basin of the Thames, part of Hampshire, part of the Netherlands,\r\nand the country round Paris. The deposits, however, occupying these spaces\r\ncomprise a great succession of marine and freshwater formations, which,\r\nalthough they may all be termed Eocene, as being newer than the chalk, and\r\nolder than the faluns, are nevertheless divisible into separate groups, of\r\nhigh geological importance.\r\n\r\nThe newest of these, like the Faluns of the Loire, have no true\r\nrepresentatives, or exact chronological equivalents, in the British Isles.\r\nTheir place in the series will best be understood by referring to the order\r\nof superposition of the successive deposits found in the neighbourhood of\r\nParis. The area which has been called the Paris basin is about 180 miles in\r\nits greatest length from north-east to south-west, and about 90 miles from\r\neast to west. This space may be described as a depression in the chalk,\r\nwhich has been filled up by alternating groups of marine and freshwater\r\nstrata. MM. Cuvier and Brongniart attempted, in 1810, to distinguish five\r\ndifferent formations, comprising three freshwater and two marine, which\r\nalternated with each other. It was imagined that the waters of the ocean\r\nhad been by turns admitted and excluded from the same region; but the\r\nsubsequent investigations of several geologists, especially of M. Constant\r\nPrevost,[175-A] have led to great modifications in these theoretical views;\r\nand now that the true order of succession is better understood, it appears\r\nthat several of the deposits, which were supposed to have originated one\r\nafter the other, were, in fact, in progress at the same time by the joint\r\naction of the sea and rivers.\r\n\r\nThe whole series of strata may be divided into three groups, as expressed\r\nin the following table:--\r\n\r\n                   { _a._ Upper freshwater limestone, marls, and siliceous\r\n  1. Upper Eocene  {      millstone.\r\n                   { _b._ Upper marine sands, or Fontainebleau sandstone\r\n                   {      and sand.\r\n\r\n                   { _a._ Lower freshwater limestone and marl, or\r\n                   {      gypseous series.\r\n                   { _b._ Sandstone and sands with marine shells (_Sables_\r\n  2.

Lower Eocene  {      _inferieurs et lits coquilliers_).\r\n                   { _b._ Lower sands, with lignite and plastic clay\r\n                   {      (_Sables inferieurs et argiles plastiques_).\r\n\r\nPostponing to the next chapter the consideration of the Middle and Lower\r\nEocene groups, I shall now speak of the Upper Eocene of Paris, and\r\nits foreign equivalents.\r\n\r\nThe upper freshwater marls and limestone (1. _a_) seem to have been formed\r\nin a great number of marshes and shallow lakes, such as frequently\r\noverspread the newest parts of great deltas. It appears that many layers of\r\nmarl, tufaceous limestone, and travertin, with beds of flint, continuous\r\nor in nodules, accumulated in these lakes. _Charae_, aquatic plants, already\r\nalluded to (see p. 32.) left their stems and seed-vessels imbedded both in\r\nthe marl and flint, together with freshwater and land shells. Some of the\r\nsiliceous rocks of this formation are used extensively for millstones. The\r\nflat summits or platforms of the hills round Paris, large areas in the\r\nforest of Fontainebleau, and the Plateau de la Beauce, between the Seine\r\nand the Loire, are chiefly composed of these upper freshwater strata.\r\n\r\nThe upper marine sands (1. _b_), consist chiefly of micaceous and quartzose\r\nsands, 80 feet thick. As they succeed throughout an extensive area deposit\r\nof a purely freshwater origin (2 _a_.), they appear to mark a subsidence of\r\nthe subjacent soil, whether it had formed the bottom of an estuary or a\r\nlake. The sea, which afterwards took possession of the same space, was\r\ninhabited by testacea, almost all of them differing from those found in the\r\nlower formations (2. _b_ and 2. _c_) and equally or still more distinct\r\nfrom the Miocene Faluns of subsequent date. One of these upper Eocene\r\nstrata in the neighbourhood of Paris has been called the oyster bed,\r\n\"couche a _Ostrea cyathula_, Lamk.,\" which is spread over a remarkably wide\r\narea. From the manner in which the oysters lie, it is inferred that they\r\ndid not grow on the spot, but that some current swept them away from a bed\r\nof oysters formed in some other part of the bay. The strata of sand which\r\nimmediately repose on the oyster-bed are quite destitute of organic\r\nremains; and nothing is more common in the Paris basin, and in other\r\nformations, than alternations of shelly beds with others entirely devoid of\r\nthem. The temporary extinction and renewal of animal life at successive\r\nperiods have been rashly inferred from such phenomena, which may\r\nnevertheless be explained, as M. Prevost justly remarks, without appealing\r\nto any such extraordinary revolutions in the state of the animate creation.\r\nA current one day scoops out a channel in a bed of shelly sand and mud, and\r\nthe next day, by a slight alteration of its course, ceases to prey upon the\r\nsame bank. It may then become charged with sand unmixed with shells,\r\nderived from some dune, or brought down by a river. In the course of ages\r\nan indefinite number of transitions from shelly strata to those without\r\nshells may thus be caused.\r\n\r\nBesides these oysters, M. Deshayes has described 29 species of shells,\r\nin his work (Coquilles fossiles de Paris), as belonging to this\r\nformation, all save one regarded by him as differing from fossils of the\r\ncalcaire grossier. Since that time the railway cuttings near Etampes\r\nhave enabled M. Hebert to raise the number to 90. I have myself\r\ncollected fossils in that district, where the shells are very entire,\r\nand detachable from the yellow sandy matrix. M. Hebert first pointed out\r\nthat most of them agree specifically with those of Kleyn Spauwen, Boom,\r\nand other localities of Limburg in Flanders, where they have been\r\nstudied by MM. Nyst and De Koninck.[176-A]\r\n\r\nThe position in Belgium of this formation above the older Eocene group is\r\nwell seen in the small hill of Pellenberg, rising abruptly from the great\r\nplain, half a mile south-east of the city of Louvain, where I examined it\r\nin company with M. Nyst in 1850. At the top of the hill, a thin bed of dark\r\ngreyish green tile-clay is seen 1-1/2 foot thick, with casts of _Nucula\r\nDeshaysiana_. This clay rests on 12 feet of yellow sand, separated, by a\r\nband of flint and quartz pebbles, from a mass of subjacent white sand 15\r\nfeet thick, in which casts of the Kleyn Spauwen fossils have been met with.\r\nUnder this is a bed of yellow sand 12 feet thick, and, at a lower level,\r\nthe railway cuttings have passed through calcareous sands like those of\r\nBrussels, in which the _Nautilus Burtini_, and various shells common to the\r\nolder Eocene strata of the neighbourhood of London, have been obtained.\r\nEvery new fact which throws light on the true paleontological relations of\r\nthe strata now under consideration, (the Upper Marine or Fontainebleau beds\r\nof the Paris basin, 1. _b_, p. 175.), deserves more particular attention,\r\nbecause geologists of high authority differ in opinion as to whether they\r\nshould be classed as Eocene or Miocene.\r\n\r\nProfessor Beyrich has lately described a formation of the same age,\r\noccurring within 7 miles of the gates of Berlin, near the village of\r\nHermsdorf, where, in the midst of the sands of which that country\r\nchiefly consists, a mass of tile-clay, more than 40 feet thick, and of a\r\ndark blueish grey colour, is found, full of shells, among which the\r\ngenera _Fusus_ and _Pleurotoma_ predominate, and among the bivalves,\r\n_Nucula Deshaysiana_, Nyst, an extremely common shell in the Belgian\r\nbeds above-mentioned. M. Beyrich has identified eighteen out of\r\nforty-five species of the Hermsdorf fossils with the Belgian species;\r\nand I believe that a much larger proportion agree with the Upper Eocene\r\nof Belgium, France, and the Rhine. On the other hand, eight of the\r\nforty-five species are supposed by him to agree with English Eocene\r\nshells. Messrs. Morris, Edwards, and S. Wood have compared a small\r\ncollection, which I obtained of these Berlin shells, with the Eocene\r\nfossils of their museums, and confirmed the result of M. Beyrich, the\r\nspecies common to the English fossils belonging not simply to the\r\nuppermost of our marine beds, or those of Barton, but some of them to\r\nlower parts of the series, such as Bracklesham and Highgate. On the\r\nother hand, while these testacea, like those of Kleyn Spauwen and\r\nEtampes, present many analogies to the Middle and Lower Eocene group,\r\nthey differ widely from the Falun shells,--a fact the more important in\r\nreference to Etampes, as that locality approaches within 70 miles of\r\nPontlevoy, near Blois, and within 100 miles of Savigne, near Tours,\r\nwhere Falun shells are found. It is evident that the discordance of\r\nspecies cannot be attributed to distance or geographical causes, but\r\nmust be referred to time, or the different epoch at which the upper\r\nmarine beds of the Paris basin and the Faluns of the Loire originated.\r\n\r\n_Mayence._--The true chronological relation of many tertiary strata on\r\nthe banks of the Rhine has always presented a problem of considerable\r\ndifficulty. They occupy a tract from 5 to 12 miles in breadth, extending\r\nalong the left bank of the Rhine from Mayence to the neighbourhood of\r\nManheim, and are again found to the east, north, and south-west of\r\nFrankfort. In some places they have the appearance of a freshwater\r\nformation; but in others, as at Alzey, the shells are for the most part\r\nmarine. _Cerithia_ are in great profusion, which indicates that the sea\r\nwhere the deposit was formed was fed by rivers; and the great quantity\r\nof fossil land shells, chiefly of the genus _Helix_, confirm the same\r\nopinion. The variety in the species of shells is small, while the\r\nindividuals are exceedingly numerous; a fact which accords perfectly\r\nwith the idea that the formation may have originated in a gulf or sea\r\nwhich, like the Baltic, was brackish in some parts, and almost fresh in\r\nothers. A species of _Paludina_ (fig. 154.), very nearly resembling the\r\nrecent _Littorina ulva_, is found throughout this basin. These shells\r\nare like grains of rice in size, and are often in such quantity as to\r\nform entire beds of marl and limestone. They are as thick as grains of\r\nsand, in stratified masses from 15 to 30 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154. _Paludina._ Mayence.]\r\n\r\nThat these Rhenish tertiary formations agree more nearly with the Upper\r\nEocene deposits above enumerated, than with any others, I have no doubt,\r\nsince I had the advantage of comparing (August, 1850), with the\r\nassistance of M. De Koninck of Liege, the fossils from Kleyn Spauwen,\r\nBoom, and other Limburg localities, with those from Mayence, Alzey,\r\nWeinheim, and other Rhenish strata. Among the common Belgian and Rhenish\r\nshells which are identical, I may mention _Cassidaria depressa_,\r\n_Tritonium flandricum_ De Koninck, _Cerithium tricinctum_ Nyst,\r\n_Tornatella simulata_, _Rostellaria Sowerbyi_, _Nucula Deshaysiana_,\r\n_Corbula pisum_, and _Pectunculus terebratularis_.\r\n\r\nFrom these Upper Eocene deposits of the Rhine M. H. von Meyer has\r\nobtained a great number of characteristic fossil mammalia, such as\r\n_Palaeomaeryx medius_, _Hyotherium Meissneri_, _Tapirus Helveticus_,\r\n_Anthracotherium Alsaticum_, and others. The three first of these are\r\nspecies common to some of the lignite, or brown coal beds in\r\nSwitzerland, commonly classed with the molasse, but of which the true\r\nage has not yet been distinctly made out.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of the sandy beds of Eppelsheim, comprising bones of the\r\nDeinotherium, Mastodon, and other quadrupeds, are regarded by H. von Meyer\r\nas belonging to a mammiferous fauna quite distinct from that of the Mayence\r\nbasin, and they are probably referable to the Miocene period.\r\n\r\nThe upper freshwater strata (1. _a_, p. 175.), of the neighbourhood of\r\nParis, stretch southwards from the valley of the Seine to that of the\r\nLoire, and in the last-mentioned region are seen to be older than the\r\nmarine faluns, so that the perforating shells of the Miocene sea have\r\nsometimes bored the hard compact freshwater limestones; and fragments of\r\nthe Upper Eocene rocks are found at Pontlevoy and elsewhere, which have\r\nbeen rolled in the bed of the Miocene sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155. Simplified geological map south of Paris.]\r\n\r\n_Central France._--Lacustrine strata belonging, for the most part, to\r\nthe same Upper Eocene series, are again met with in Auvergne, Cantal,\r\nand Velay, the sites of which may be seen in the annexed map. They\r\nappear to be the monuments of ancient lakes, which, like some of those\r\nnow existing in Switzerland, once occupied the depressions in a\r\nmountainous region, and have been each fed by one or more rivers and\r\ntorrents. The country where they occur is almost entirely composed of\r\ngranite and different varieties of granitic schist, with here and there\r\na few patches of secondary strata, much dislocated, and which have\r\nprobably suffered great denudation. There are also some vast piles\r\nof volcanic matter (see the map), the greater part of which is newer\r\nthan the freshwater strata, and is sometimes seen to rest upon them,\r\nwhile a small part has evidently been of contemporaneous origin.\r\nOf these igneous rocks I shall treat more particularly in another\r\npart of this work.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon any details, I may observe, that the study of these\r\nregions possesses a peculiar interest, very distinct in kind from that\r\nderivable from the investigation either of the Parisian or English tertiary\r\nstrata. For we are presented in Auvergne with the evidence of a series of\r\nevents of astonishing magnitude and grandeur, by which the original form\r\nand features of the country have been greatly changed, yet never so far\r\nobliterated but that they may still, in part at least, be restored in\r\nimagination. Great lakes have disappeared,--lofty mountains have been\r\nformed, by the reiterated emission of lava, preceded and followed by\r\nshowers of sand and scoriae,--deep valleys have been subsequently furrowed\r\nout through masses of lacustrine and volcanic origin,--at a still later\r\ndate, new cones have been thrown up in these valleys,--new lakes have been\r\nformed by the damming up of rivers,--and more than one creation of\r\nquadrupeds, birds, and plants, Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene, have followed\r\nin succession; yet the region has preserved from first to last its\r\ngeographical identity; and we can still recall to our thoughts its external\r\ncondition and physical structure before these wonderful vicissitudes began,\r\nor while a part only of the whole had been completed. There was first a\r\nperiod when the spacious lakes, of which we still may trace the boundaries,\r\nlay at the foot of mountains of moderate elevation, unbroken by the bold\r\npeaks and precipices of Mont Dor, and unadorned by the picturesque outline\r\nof the Puy de Dome, or of the volcanic cones and craters now covering the\r\ngranitic platform. During this earlier scene of repose deltas were slowly\r\nformed; beds of marl and sand, several hundred feet thick, deposited;\r\nsiliceous and calcareous rocks precipitated from the waters of mineral\r\nsprings; shells and insects imbedded, together with the remains of the\r\ncrocodile and tortoise, the eggs and bones of water birds, and the\r\nskeletons of quadrupeds, some of them belonging to the same genera as those\r\nentombed in the Eocene gypsum of Paris. To this tranquil condition of the\r\nsurface succeeded the era of volcanic eruptions, when the lakes were\r\ndrained, and when the fertility of the mountainous district was probably\r\nenhanced by the igneous matter ejected from below, and poured down upon the\r\nmore sterile granite. During these eruptions, which appear to have taken\r\nplace after the disappearance of the Eocene fauna, and in the Miocene\r\nepoch, the mastodon, rhinoceros, elephant, tapir, hippopotamus, together\r\nwith the ox, various kinds of deer, the bear, hyaena, and many beasts of\r\nprey, ranged the forest, or pastured on the plain, and were occasionally\r\novertaken by a fall of burning cinders, or buried in flows of mud, such as\r\naccompany volcanic eruptions. Lastly, these quadrupeds became extinct, and\r\ngave place to Pliocene mammalia, and these, in their turn, to species now\r\nexisting. There are no signs, during the whole time required for this\r\nseries of events, of the sea having intervened, nor of any denudation which\r\nmay not have been accomplished by currents in the different lakes, or by\r\nrivers and floods accompanying repeated earthquakes, during which the\r\nlevels of the district have in some places been materially modified, and\r\nperhaps the whole upraised relatively to the surrounding parts of France.\r\n\r\n_Auvergne._--The most northern of the freshwater groups is situated in the\r\nvalley-plain of the Allier, which lies within the department of the Puy de\r\nDome, being the tract which went formerly by the name of the Limagne\r\nd'Auvergne. It is inclosed by two parallel mountain ranges,--that of the\r\nForez, which divides the waters of the Loire and Allier, on the east; and\r\nthat of the Monts Domes, which separates the Allier from the Sioule, on the\r\nwest.[181-A] The average breadth of this tract is about 20 miles; and it is\r\nfor the most part composed of nearly horizontal strata of sand, sandstone,\r\ncalcareous marl, clay, and limestone, none of which observe a fixed and\r\ninvariable order of superposition. The ancient borders of the lake, wherein\r\nthe freshwater strata were accumulated, may generally be traced with\r\nprecision, the granite and other ancient rocks rising up boldly from the\r\nlevel country. The actual junction, however, of the lacustrine and granitic\r\nbeds is rarely seen, as a small valley usually intervenes between them. The\r\nfreshwater strata may sometimes be seen to retain their horizontality\r\nwithin a very slight distance of the border-rocks, while in some places\r\nthey are inclined, and in few instances vertical. The principal divisions\r\ninto which the lacustrine series may be separated are the following:--1st,\r\nSandstone, grit, and conglomerate, including red marl and red sandstone.\r\n2dly, Green and white foliated marls. 3dly, Limestone or travertin, often\r\noolitic. 4thly, Gypseous marls.\r\n\r\n1. _a_. _Sandstone and conglomerate._--Strata of sand and gravel, sometimes\r\nbound together into a solid rock, are found in great abundance around the\r\nconfines of the lacustrine basin, containing, in different places, pebbles\r\nof all the ancient rocks of the adjoining elevated country; namely,\r\ngranite, gneiss, mica-schist, clay-slate, porphyry, and others. But these\r\nstrata do not form one continuous band around the margin of the basin,\r\nbeing rather disposed like the independent deltas which grow at the mouths\r\nof torrents along the borders of existing lakes.\r\n\r\nAt Chamalieres, near Clermont, we have an example of one of these deltas,\r\nor littoral deposits, of local extent, where the pebbly beds slope away\r\nfrom the granite, as if they had formed a talus beneath the waters of the\r\nlake near the steep shore. A section of about 50 feet in vertical height\r\nhas been laid open by a torrent, and the pebbles are seen to consist\r\nthroughout of rounded and angular fragments of granite, quartz, primary\r\nslate, and red sandstone; but without any intermixture of those volcanic\r\nrocks which now abound in the neighbourhood, and which could not have been\r\nthere when the conglomerate was formed. Partial layers of lignite and\r\npieces of wood are found in these beds.\r\n\r\nAt some localities on the margin of the basin quartzose grits are found;\r\nand, where these rest on granite, they are sometimes formed of separate\r\ncrystals of quartz, mica, and felspar, derived from the disintegrated\r\ngranite, the crystals having been subsequently bound together by a\r\nsiliceous cement. In these cases the granite seems regenerated in a new and\r\nmore solid form; and so gradual a passage takes place between the rock of\r\ncrystalline and that of mechanical origin, that we can scarcely distinguish\r\nwhere one ends and the other begins.\r\n\r\nIn the hills called the Puy de Jussat and La Roche, we have the advantage\r\nof seeing a section continuously exposed for about 700 feet in thickness.\r\nAt the bottom are foliated marls, white and green, about 400 feet thick;\r\nand above, resting on the marls, are the quartzose grits, cemented by\r\ncalcareous matter, which is sometimes so abundant as to form imbedded\r\nnodules. These sometimes constitute spheroidal concretions 6 feet in\r\ndiameter, and pass into beds of solid limestone, resembling the Italian\r\ntravertins, or the deposits of mineral springs. This section is close to\r\nthe confines of the basin; so that the lake must here have been filled up\r\nnear the shore with fine mud, before the coarse superincumbent sand was\r\nintroduced. There are other cases where sand is seen below the marl.\r\n\r\n1. _b._ _Red marl and sandstone_.--But the most remarkable of the\r\narenaceous groups is one of red sandstone and red marl, which are identical\r\nin all their mineral characters with the secondary _New Red sandstone_ and\r\nmarl of England. In these secondary rocks the red ground is sometimes\r\nvariegated with light greenish spots, and the same may be seen in the\r\ntertiary formation of freshwater origin at Coudes, on the Allier. The marls\r\nare sometimes of a purplish-red colour, as at Champheix, and are\r\naccompanied by a reddish limestone, like the well-known \"cornstone,\" which\r\nis associated with the Old Red sandstone of English geologists. The red\r\nsandstone and marl of Auvergne have evidently been derived from the\r\ndegradation of gneiss and mica-schist, which are seen _in situ_ on the\r\nadjoining hills, decomposing into a soil very similar to the tertiary red\r\nsand and marl. We also find pebbles of gneiss, mica-schist, and quartz in\r\nthe coarser sandstones of this group, clearly pointing to the parent rocks\r\nfrom which the sand and marl are derived. The red beds, although destitute\r\nthemselves of organic remains, pass upwards into strata containing Eocene\r\nfossils, and are certainly an integral part of the lacustrine formation.\r\nFrom this example the student will learn how small is the value of mineral\r\ncharacter alone, as a test of the relative age of rocks.\r\n\r\n2. _Green and white foliated marls._--The same primary rocks of Auvergne,\r\nwhich, by the partial degradation of their harder parts, gave rise to the\r\nquartzose grits and conglomerates before mentioned, would, by the reduction\r\nof the same materials into powder, and by the decomposition of their\r\nfelspar, mica, and hornblende, produce aluminous clay, and, if a sufficient\r\nquantity of carbonate of lime was present, calcareous marl. This fine\r\nsediment would naturally be carried out to a greater distance from the\r\nshore, as are the various finer marls now deposited in Lake Superior. And,\r\nas in the American lake, shingle and sand are annually amassed near the\r\nnorthern shores, so in Auvergne the grits and conglomerates before\r\nmentioned were evidently formed near the borders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156. _Cypris unifasciata_, a living species,\r\ngreatly magnified.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Upper part.\r\n  _b._ Side view of the same.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157. _Cypris vidua_, a living species,\r\ngreatly magnified.[183-A]]\r\n\r\nThe entire thickness of these marls is unknown; but it certainly exceeds,\r\nin some places, 700 feet. They are, for the most part, either light-green\r\nor white, and usually calcareous. They are thinly foliated,--a character\r\nwhich frequently arises from the innumerable thin shells, or\r\ncarapace-valves, of that small animal called _Cypris_; a genus which\r\ncomprises several species, of which some are recent, and may be seen\r\nswimming swiftly through the waters of our stagnant pools and ditches. The\r\nantennae, at the end of which are fine pencils of hair, are the principal\r\norgans of motion, and are seen to vibrate with great rapidity. This animal\r\nresides within two small valves, not unlike those of a bivalve shell, and\r\nmoults its integuments periodically, which the conchiferous mollusks do\r\nnot. This circumstance may partly explain the countless myriads of the\r\nshells of _Cypris_ which were shed in the ancient lakes of Auvergne, so as\r\nto give rise to divisions in the marl as thin as paper, and that, too, in\r\nstratified masses several hundred feet thick. A more convincing proof of\r\nthe tranquillity and clearness of the waters, and of the slow and gradual\r\nprocess by which the lake was filled up with fine mud, cannot be desired.\r\nBut we may easily suppose that, while this fine sediment was thrown down in\r\nthe deep and central parts of the basin, gravel, sand, and rocky fragments\r\nwere hurried into the lake, and deposited near the shore, forming the group\r\ndescribed in the preceding section.\r\n\r\nNot far from Clermont, the green marls, containing the _Cypris_ in\r\nabundance, approach to within a few yards of the granite which forms the\r\nborders of the basin. The occurrence of these marls so near the ancient\r\nmargin may be explained by considering that, at the bottom of the\r\nancient lake, no coarse ingredients were deposited in spaces\r\nintermediate between the points where rivers and torrents entered, but\r\nfiner mud only was drifted there by currents. The _verticality_ of some\r\nof the beds in the above section bears testimony to considerable local\r\ndisturbance subsequent to the deposition of the marls; but such inclined\r\nand vertical strata are very rare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158. Vertical strata of marl, at Champradelle,\r\nnear Clermont.\r\n\r\n  A. Granite.\r\n  B. Space of 60 feet, in which no section is seen.\r\n  C. Green marl, vertical and inclined.\r\n  D. White marl.]\r\n\r\n3. _Limestone, travertin, oolite._--Both the preceding members of the\r\nlacustrine deposit, the marls and grits, pass occasionally into\r\nlimestone. Sometimes only concretionary nodules abound in them; but\r\nthese, where there is an increase in the quantity of calcareous matter,\r\nunite into regular beds.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the basin of the Limagne, both on the west at Gannat, and\r\non the east at Vichy, a white oolitic limestone is quarried. At Vichy, the\r\noolite resembles our Bath stone in appearance and beauty; and, like it, is\r\nsoft when first taken from the quarry, but soon hardens on exposure to the\r\nair. At Gannat, the stone contains land-shells and bones of quadrupeds,\r\nresembling those of the Paris gypsum. At Chadrat, in the hill of La Serre,\r\nthe limestone is pisolitic, the small spheroids combining both the radiated\r\nand concentric structure.\r\n\r\n_Indusial limestone._--There is another remarkable form of freshwater\r\nlimestone in Auvergne, called \"indusial,\" from the cases, or _indusiae_,\r\nof caddis-worms (the larvae of _Phryganea_); great heaps of which have\r\nbeen incrusted, as they lay, by carbonate of lime, and formed into a\r\nhard travertin. The rock is sometimes purely calcareous, but there is\r\noccasionally an intermixture of siliceous matter. Several beds of it are\r\nfrequently seen, either in continuous masses, or in concretionary\r\nnodules, one upon another, with layers of marl interposed. The annexed\r\ndrawing (fig. 159.) will show the manner in which one of these indusial\r\nbeds (_a_) is laid open at the surface, between the marls (_b b_), near\r\nthe base of the hill of Gergovia; and affords, at the same time, an\r\nexample of the extent to which the lacustrine strata, which must once\r\nhave filled a hollow, have been denuded, and shaped out into hills and\r\nvalleys, on the site of the ancient lakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159. Bed of indusial limestone, interstratified with\r\nfreshwater marl, near Clermont (Kleinschrod.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160. Larva of recent Phryganea.[185-A]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.\r\n\r\n  _a_. Indusial limestone of Auvergne.\r\n  _b_. Fossil _Paludina_ magnified.]\r\n\r\nWe may often observe in our ponds the _Phryganea_ (or Caddis-fly), in its\r\ncaterpillar state, covered with small freshwater shells, which they have\r\nthe power of fixing to the outside of their tubular cases, in order,\r\nprobably, to give them weight and strength. The individual figured in the\r\nannexed cut, which belongs to a species very abundant in England, has\r\ncovered its case with shells of a small _Planorbis_. In the same manner a\r\nlarge species of caddis-worm, which swarmed in the Eocene lakes of\r\nAuvergne, was accustomed to attach to its dwelling the shells of a small\r\nspiral univalve of the genus _Paludina_. A hundred of these minute shells\r\nare sometimes seen arranged around one tube, part of the central cavity of\r\nwhich is often empty, the rest being filled up with thin concentric layers\r\nof travertin. The cases have been thrown together confusedly, and often\r\nlie, as in fig. 161., at right angles one to the other. When we consider\r\nthat ten or twelve tubes are packed within the compass of a cubic inch, and\r\nthat some single strata of this limestone are 6 feet thick, and may be\r\ntraced over a considerable area, we may form some idea of the countless\r\nnumber of insects and mollusca which contributed their integuments and\r\nshells to compose this singularly constructed rock. It is unnecessary to\r\nsuppose that the _Phryganeae_ lived on the spots where their cases are now\r\nfound; they may have multiplied in the shallows near the margin of the\r\nlake, or in the streams by which it was fed, and their cases may have been\r\ndrifted by a current far into the deep water.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1837, when examining, in company with Dr. Beck, a small\r\nlake near Copenhagen, I had an opportunity of witnessing a beautiful\r\nexemplification of the manner in which the tubular cases of Auvergne were\r\nprobably accumulated. This lake, called the Fuure-Soe, occurring in the\r\ninterior of Seeland, is about twenty English miles in circumference, and in\r\nsome parts 200 feet in depth. Round the shallow borders an abundant crop of\r\nreeds and rushes may be observed, covered with the indusiae of the\r\n_Phryganea grandis_ and other species, to which shells are attached. The\r\nplants which support them are the bullrush, _Scirpus lacustris_, and common\r\nreed, _Arundo phragmitis_, but chiefly the former. In summer, especially in\r\nthe month of June, a violent gust of wind sometimes causes a current by\r\nwhich these plants are torn up by the roots, washed away, and floated off\r\nin long bands, more than a mile in length, into deep water. The _Cypris_\r\nswarms in the same lake; and calcareous springs alone are wanting to form\r\nextensive beds of indusial limestone, like those of Auvergne.\r\n\r\n4. _Gypseous marls._--More than 50 feet of thinly laminated gypseous marls,\r\nexactly resembling those in the hill of Montmartre, at Paris, are worked\r\nfor gypsum at St. Romain, on the right bank of the Allier. They rest on a\r\nseries of green cypriferous marls which alternate with grit, the united\r\nthickness of this inferior group being seen, in a vertical section on the\r\nbanks of the river, to exceed 250 feet.\r\n\r\n_General arrangement, origin, and age of the freshwater formations of\r\nAuvergne._--The relations of the different groups above described cannot be\r\nlearnt by the study of any one section; and the geologist who sets out with\r\nthe expectation of finding a fixed order of succession may perhaps complain\r\nthat the different parts of the basin give contradictory results. The\r\narenaceous division, the marls, and the limestone, may all be seen in some\r\nplaces to alternate with each other; yet it can, by no means, be affirmed\r\nthat there is no order of arrangement. The sands, sandstone, and\r\nconglomerate, constitute in general a littoral group; the foliated white\r\nand green marls, a contemporaneous central deposit; and the limestone is\r\nfor the most part subordinate to the newer portions of both. The uppermost\r\nmarls and sands are more calcareous than the lower; and we never meet with\r\ncalcareous rocks covered by a considerable thickness of quartzose sand or\r\ngreen marl. From the resemblance of the limestones to the Italian\r\ntravertins, we may conclude that they were derived from the waters of\r\nmineral springs,--such springs as even now exist in Auvergne, and which may\r\nbe seen rising up through the granite, and precipitating travertin. They\r\nare sometimes thermal, but this character is by no means constant.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, when the ancient lake of the Limagne first began to be\r\nfilled with sediment, no volcanic action had yet produced lava and\r\nscoriae on any part of the surface of Auvergne. No pebbles, therefore, of\r\nlava were transported into the lake,--no fragments of volcanic rocks\r\nembedded in the conglomerate. But at a later period, when a considerable\r\nthickness of sandstone and marl had accumulated, eruptions broke out,\r\nand lava and tuff were deposited, at some spots, alternately with the\r\nlacustrine strata. It is not improbable that cold and thermal springs,\r\nholding different mineral ingredients in solution, became more numerous\r\nduring the successive convulsions attending this development of volcanic\r\nagency, and thus deposits of carbonate and sulphate of lime, silex, and\r\nother minerals were produced. Hence these minerals predominate in the\r\nuppermost strata. The subterranean movements may then have continued\r\nuntil they altered the relative levels of the country, and caused the\r\nwaters of the lakes to be drained off, and the farther accumulation of\r\nregular freshwater strata to cease.\r\n\r\nWe may easily conceive a similar series of events to give rise to\r\nanalogous results in any modern basin, such as that of Lake Superior,\r\nfor example, where numerous rivers and torrents are carrying down the\r\ndetritus of a chain of mountains into the lake. The transported\r\nmaterials must be arranged according to their size and weight, the\r\ncoarser near the shore, the finer at a greater distance from land; but\r\nin the gravelly and sandy beds of Lake Superior no pebbles of modern\r\nvolcanic rocks can be included, since there are none of these at present\r\nin the district. If igneous action should break out in that country, and\r\nproduce lava, scoriae, and thermal springs, the deposition of gravel,\r\nsand, and marl might still continue as before; but, in addition, there\r\nwould then be an intermixture of volcanic gravel and tuff, and of rocks\r\nprecipitated from the waters of mineral springs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the freshwater strata of the Limagne approach generally to a\r\nhorizontal position, the proofs of local disturbance are sufficiently\r\nnumerous and violent to allow us to suppose great changes of level since\r\nthe lacustrine period. We are unable to assign a northern barrier to the\r\nancient lake, although we can still trace its limits to the east, west,\r\nand south, where they were formed of bold granite eminences. Nor need we\r\nbe surprised at our inability to restore entirely the physical geography\r\nof the country after so great a series of volcanic eruptions; for it is\r\nby no means improbable that one part of it, the southern, for example,\r\nmay have been moved upwards bodily, while others remained at rest, or\r\neven suffered a movement of depression.\r\n\r\nWhether all the freshwater formations of the Limagne d'Auvergne belong to\r\none period, I cannot pretend to decide, as large masses both of the\r\narenaceous and marly groups are often devoid of fossils. Much light has\r\nbeen thrown on the mammiferous fauna by the labours of MM. Bravard and\r\nCroizet, and by those of M. Pomel. The last-mentioned naturalist has\r\npointed out the specific distinction of all, or nearly all, the species of\r\nmammalia, from those of the gypseous series near Paris. Nevertheless, many\r\nof the forms are analogous to those of Eocene quadrupeds. The\r\n_Cainotherium_, for example, is not far removed from the _Anoplotherium_,\r\nand is, according to Waterhouse, the same as the genus _Microtherium_ of\r\nthe Germans. There are two species of marsupial animals allied to\r\n_Didelphys_, a genus also found in the Paris gypsum. The _Amphitragulus\r\nelegans_ of Pomel, has been identified with a Rhenish species from\r\nWeissenau near Mayence, called by Kaup _Dorcatherium nanum_; and other\r\nAuvergne fossils, e.g., _Microtherium Reuggeri_, and a small rodent,\r\n_Titanomys_, are specifically the same with mammalia of the Mayence basin.\r\n\r\n_Cantal._--A freshwater formation, very analogous to that of Auvergne,\r\nis situated in the department of Haute Loire, near the town of Le Puy,\r\nin Velay, and another occurs near Aurillac, in Cantal. The leading\r\nfeature of the formation last mentioned, as distinguished from those of\r\nAuvergne and Velay, is the immense abundance of silex associated with\r\ncalcareous marls and limestone.\r\n\r\nThe whole series may be separated into two divisions; the lower, composed\r\nof gravel, sand, and clay, such as might have been derived from the wearing\r\ndown and decomposition of the granitic schists of the surrounding country;\r\nthe upper system, consisting of siliceous and calcareous marls, contains\r\nsubordinately gypsum, silex, and limestone.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of the freshwater limestone of the Cantal, and its\r\naccompanying flint, to the upper chalk of England, is very instructive, and\r\nwell calculated to put the student upon his guard against relying too\r\nimplicitly on mineral character alone as a safe criterion of relative age.\r\n\r\nWhen we approach Aurillac from the west, we pass over great heathy plains,\r\nwhere the sterile mica-schist is barely covered with vegetation. Near\r\nYtrac, and between La Capelle and Viscamp, the surface is strewed over with\r\nloose broken flints, some of them black in the interior, but with a white\r\nexternal coating; others stained with tints of yellow and red, and in\r\nappearance precisely like the flint gravel of our chalk districts. When\r\nheaps of this gravel have thus announced our approach to a new formation,\r\nwe arrive at length at the escarpment of the lacustrine beds. At the bottom\r\nof the hill which rises before us, we see strata of clay and sand, resting\r\non mica-schist; and above, in the quarries of Belbet, Leybros, and Bruel, a\r\nwhite limestone, in horizontal strata, the surface of which has been\r\nhollowed out into irregular furrows, since filled up with broken flint,\r\nmarl, and dark vegetable mound. In these cavities we recognize an exact\r\ncounterpart to those which are so numerous on the furrowed surface of our\r\nown white chalk. Advancing from these quarries along a road made of the\r\nwhite limestone, which reflects as glaring a light in the sun, as do our\r\nroads composed of chalk, we reach, at length, in the neighbourhood of\r\nAurillac, hills of limestone and calcareous marl, in horizontal strata,\r\nseparated in some places by regular layers of flint in nodules, the coating\r\nof each nodule being of an opaque white colour, like the exterior of the\r\nflinty nodules of our chalk.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the siliceous stone of Bilin, called _tripoli_,\r\nis a freshwater deposit, and has been shown, by Ehrenberg, to be of\r\ninfusorial origin (see p. 24.). What is true of the Bohemian flint and\r\nopal, where the beds attain a thickness of 14 feet, may also, perhaps, be\r\nfound to hold good respecting the silex of Aurillac, which may also have\r\nbeen immediately derived from the minute cases of microscopic animalcules.\r\nBut even if this conclusion be established, the abundant supply both of\r\nsiliceous, calcareous, and gypseous matter, which the ancient lakes of\r\nFrance received, may have been connected with the subterranean volcanic\r\nagency of which those regions were so long the theatre, and which may have\r\nimpregnated the springs with mineral matter, even before the great outbreak\r\nof lava. It is well known that the hot springs of Iceland, and many other\r\ncountries, contain silex in solution; and it has been lately affirmed, that\r\nsteam at a high temperature is capable of dissolving quartzose rocks\r\nwithout the aid of any alkaline or other flux.[189-A]\r\n\r\nTravellers not unfrequently mention, in their accounts of India, Australia,\r\nand other distant lands, that they have seen chalk with flints, which they\r\nhave assumed to be of the same age as the Cretaceous system of Europe. A\r\nhasty observation of the white limestone and flint of Aurillac might convey\r\nthe same idea; but when we turn from the mineral aspect and composition to\r\nthe organic remains, we find in the flints of the Cantal the seed-vessels\r\nof the freshwater _Chara_, instead of the marine zoophytes so abundantly\r\nimbedded in chalk flints; and in the limestone we meet with shells of\r\n_Limnea_, _Planorbis_, and other lacustrine genera, instead of the oyster,\r\nterebratula, and echinus of the Cretaceous period.\r\n\r\n_Proofs of gradual deposition_.--Some sections of the foliated marls in the\r\nvalley of the Cer, near Aurillac, attest, in the most unequivocal manner,\r\nthe extreme slowness with which the materials of the lacustrine series were\r\namassed. In the hill of Barrat, for example, we find an assemblage of\r\ncalcareous and siliceous marls; in which, for a depth of at least 60 feet,\r\nthe layers are so thin, that thirty are sometimes contained in the\r\nthickness of an inch; and when they are separated, we see preserved in\r\nevery one of them the flattened stems of _Charae_, or other plants, or\r\nsometimes myriads of small _Paludinae_ and other freshwater shells. These\r\nminute foliations of the marl resemble precisely some of the recent\r\nlaminated beds of the Scotch marl lakes, and may be compared to the pages\r\nof a book, each containing a history of a certain period of the past. The\r\ndifferent layers may be grouped together in beds from a foot to a foot and\r\na half in thickness, which are distinguished by differences of composition\r\nand colour, the tints being white, green, and brown. Occasionally there is\r\na parting layer of pure flint, or of black carbonaceous vegetable matter,\r\nabout an inch thick, or of white pulverulent marl. We find several hills in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Aurillac composed of such materials, for the height of\r\nmore than 200 feet from their base, the whole sometimes covered by rocky\r\ncurrents of trachytic or basaltic lava.[190-A]\r\n\r\nThus wonderfully minute are the separate parts of which some of the most\r\nmassive geological monuments are made up! When we desire to classify, it\r\nis necessary to contemplate entire groups of strata in the aggregate;\r\nbut if we wish to understand the mode of their formation, and to explain\r\ntheir origin, we must think only of the minute subdivisions of which\r\neach mass is composed. We must bear in mind how many thin leaf-like\r\nseams of matter, each containing the remains of myriads of testacea and\r\nplants, frequently enter into the composition of a single stratum, and\r\nhow vast a succession of these strata unite to form a single group! We\r\nmust remember, also, that piles of volcanic matter, like the Plomb du\r\nCantal, which rises in the immediate neighbourhood of Aurillac, are\r\nthemselves equally the result of successive accumulation, consisting of\r\nreiterated sheets of lava, showers of scoriae, and ejected fragments of\r\nrock.--Lastly, we must not forget that continents and mountain-chains,\r\ncolossal as are their dimensions, are nothing more than an assemblage of\r\nmany such igneous and aqueous groups, formed in succession during an\r\nindefinite lapse of ages, and superimposed upon each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[175-A] Bulletin des Sci. de la Soc.

But, when we descend to the middle and\r\ninferior divisions of the Eocene system of France, we find that they\r\nhave their equivalents in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDDLE EOCENE.--FRANCE.\r\n\r\n_Gypseous series_ (2. _a_, Table, p. 175.).--Next below the upper marine\r\nsands of the neighbourhood of Paris, we find a series of white and green\r\nmarls, with subordinate beds of gypsum. These are most largely developed in\r\nthe central parts of the Paris basin, and, among other places, in the Hill\r\nof Montmartre, where its fossils were first studied by M. Cuvier.\r\n\r\nThe gypsum quarried there for the manufacture of plaster of Paris occurs as\r\na granular crystalline rock, and, together with the associated marls,\r\ncontains land and fluviatile shells, together with the bones and skeletons\r\nof birds and quadrupeds. Several land plants are also met with, among which\r\nare fine specimens of the fan palm or palmetto tribe (_Flabellaria_). The\r\nremains also of freshwater fish and of crocodiles and other reptiles, occur\r\nin the gypsum. The skeletons of mammalia are usually isolated, often\r\nentire, the most delicate extremities being preserved; as if the carcasses,\r\nclothed with their flesh and skin, had been floated down soon after death,\r\nand while they were still swoln by the gases generated by their first\r\ndecomposition. The few accompanying shells are of those light kinds which\r\nfrequently float on the surface of rivers, together with wood.\r\n\r\nM. Prevost has therefore suggested that a river may have swept away the\r\nbodies of animals, and the plants which lived on its borders, or in the\r\nlakes which it traversed, and may have carried them down into the centre\r\nof the gulf into which flowed the waters impregnated with sulphate of\r\nlime. We know that the Fiume Salso in Sicily enters the sea so charged\r\nwith various salts that the thirsty cattle refuse to drink of it. A\r\nstream of sulphureous water, as white as milk, descends into the sea\r\nfrom the volcanic mountain of Idienne on the east of Java; and a great\r\nbody of hot water, charged with sulphuric acid, rushed down from the\r\nsame volcano on one occasion, and inundated a large tract of country,\r\ndestroying, by its noxious properties, all the vegetation.[191-A] In\r\nlike manner the Pusanibio, or \"Vinegar River,\" of Colombia, which rises\r\nat the foot of Purace, an extinct volcano, 7,500 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, is strongly impregnated with sulphuric and muriatic acids and\r\nwith oxide of iron. We may easily suppose the waters of such streams to\r\nhave properties noxious to marine animals, and in this manner the entire\r\nabsence of marine remains in the ossiferous gypsum may be\r\nexplained.[191-B] There are no pebbles or coarse sand in the gypsum; a\r\ncircumstance which agrees well with the hypothesis that these beds were\r\nprecipitated from water holding sulphate of lime in solution, and\r\nfloating the remains of different animals.\r\n\r\nIn this formation the relics of about fifty species of quadrupeds,\r\nincluding the genera _Paleotherium_, _Anoplotherium_, and others, have been\r\nfound, all extinct, and nearly four-fifths of them belonging to a division\r\nof the order _Pachydermata_, which is now represented by only four living\r\nspecies; namely three tapirs and the daman of the Cape. With them a few\r\ncarnivorous animals are associated, among which are a species of fox and\r\ngennet. Of the _Rodentia_, a dormouse and a squirrel; of the _Insectivora_,\r\na bat; and of the _Marsupialia_ (an order now confined to America,\r\nAustralia, and some contiguous islands), an opossum, have been discovered.\r\n\r\nOf birds, about ten species have been ascertained, the skeletons of some of\r\nwhich are entire. None of them are referable to existing species.[192-A]\r\nThe same remark applies to the fish, according to MM. Cuvier, and Agassiz,\r\nas also to the reptiles. Among the last are crocodiles and tortoises of the\r\ngenera _Emys_ and _Trionyx_.\r\n\r\nThe tribe of land quadrupeds most abundant in this formation is such as\r\nnow inhabits alluvial plains and marshes, and the banks of rivers and\r\nlakes, a class most exposed to suffer by river inundations. Whether the\r\ndisproportion of carnivorous animals can be ascribed to this cause, or\r\nwhether they were comparatively small in number and dimensions, as in\r\nthe indigenous fauna of Australia, when first known to Europeans, is a\r\npoint on which it would be rash, perhaps, to offer an opinion in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162. _Paleotherium magnum._]\r\n\r\nThe Paleothere, above alluded to, resembled the living tapir in the form of\r\nthe head, and in having a short proboscis, but its molar teeth were more\r\nlike those of the rhinoceros (see fig. 163.). _Paleotherium magnum_ was of\r\nthe size of a horse, 3 or 4 feet high. The annexed woodcut, fig. 162., is\r\none of the restorations which Cuvier attempted of the outline of the living\r\nanimal, derived from the study of the entire skeleton. When the French\r\nosteologist declared in the early part of the present century, that all the\r\nfossil quadrupeds of the gypsum of Paris were extinct, the announcement of\r\nso startling a fact, on such high authority, created a powerful sensation,\r\nand from that time a new impulse was given throughout Europe to the\r\nprogress of geological investigation. Eminent naturalists, it is true, had\r\nlong before maintained that the shells and zoophytes, met with in many\r\nancient European rocks, had ceased to be inhabitants of the earth, but the\r\nmajority even of the educated classes continued to believe that the species\r\nof animals and plants now contemporary with man, were the same as those\r\nwhich had been called into being when the planet itself was created. It was\r\neasy to throw discredit upon the new doctrine by asking whether corals,\r\nshells, and other creatures previously unknown, were not annually\r\ndiscovered? and whether living forms corresponding with the fossils might\r\nnot yet be dredged up from seas hitherto unexamined? But from the era of\r\nthe publication of Cuvier's Ossements Fossiles, and still more his popular\r\nTreatise called \"A Theory of the Earth,\" sounder views began to prevail. It\r\nwas clearly demonstrated that most of the mammalia found in the gypsum of\r\nMontmartre differed even generically from any now existing, and the extreme\r\nimprobability that any of them, especially the larger ones, would ever be\r\nfound surviving in continents yet unexplored, was made manifest. Moreover,\r\nthe non-admixture of a single living species in the midst of so rich a\r\nfossil fauna was a striking proof that there had existed a state of the\r\nearth's surface zoologically unconnected with the present order of things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163. Upper molar tooth of _Paleotherium magnum_ from\r\nIsle of Wight. (Owen's Brit. Foss. p. 317.)\r\n\r\nReduced one-third.]\r\n\r\n_Gres de Beauchamp_ (2. _b_, Table, p. 175.).--In some parts of the Paris\r\nbasin, sands and marls, called the Gres de Beauchamp, or Sables Moyens,\r\ndivide the gypseous beds from the underlying Calcaire grossier. These sands\r\ncontain more than 300 species of marine shells, many of them peculiar, but\r\nothers common to the underlying marine deposit (No. 2. _c_.).\r\n\r\n_Calcaire grossier_ (2. _c_, Table, p. 175.).--The formation called\r\nCalcaire grossier consists of a coarse limestone, often passing into sand.\r\nIt contains the greater number of the fossil shells which characterize the\r\nParis basin. No less than 400 distinct species have been procured from a\r\nsingle spot near Grignon, where they are embedded in a calcareous sand,\r\nchiefly formed of comminuted shells, in which, nevertheless, individuals in\r\na perfect state of preservation, both of marine, terrestrial, and\r\nfreshwater species, are mingled together. Some of the marine shells may\r\nhave lived on the spot; but the _Cyclostoma_ and _Limnea_ must have been\r\nbrought thither by rivers and currents, and the quantity of triturated\r\nshells implies considerable movement in the waters.\r\n\r\nNothing is more striking in this assemblage of fossil testacea than the\r\ngreat proportion of species referable to the genus _Cerithium_ (see fig.\r\n164.). There occur no less than 137 species of this genus in the Paris\r\nbasin, and almost all of them in the calcaire grossier. Now the living\r\n_Cerithia_ inhabit the sea near the mouths of rivers, where the waters\r\nare brackish; so that their abundance in the marine strata now under\r\nconsideration is in harmony with the hypothesis, that the Paris basin\r\nformed a gulf into which several rivers flowed, the sediment of some of\r\nwhich gave rise to the beds of clay and lignite before mentioned; while\r\na distinct freshwater limestone, called calcaire siliceux, which will\r\npresently be described, was precipitated from the waters of others\r\nsituated farther to the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164. Cerithium cinctum.[194-A]]\r\n\r\n[4 Illustrations: EOCENE FORAMINIFERA.\r\n\r\nFig. 165. _Calcarina rarispina_, Desh.\r\n         _b_. natural size.\r\n         _a_, _c_. same magnified.\r\n\r\nFig. 166. _Spirolina stenostoma_, Desh.\r\n         B. natural size.\r\n         A, C, D. same magnified.\r\n\r\nFig. 167. _Triloculina inflata_, Desh.\r\n         _b_. natural size.\r\n         _a_, _c_, _d_, same magnified.\r\n\r\nFig. 168. _Clavulina corrugata_, Desh.\r\n          _a_. natural size.\r\n          _b_, _c_. same magnified.]\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the calcaire grossier round Paris, certain beds occur of a\r\nstone used in building, and called by the French geologists \"Miliolite\r\nlimestone.\" It is almost entirely made up of millions of microscopic\r\nshells, of the size of minute grains of sand, which all belong to the class\r\nForaminifera. Figures of some of these are given in the annexed woodcut. As\r\nthis miliolitic stone never occurs in the Faluns, or Miocene strata of\r\nBrittany and Touraine, it often furnishes the geologist with a useful\r\ncriterion for distinguishing the detached Eocene and Miocene formations,\r\nscattered over those and other adjoining provinces. The discovery of the\r\nremains of Paleotherium and other mammalia in some of the upper beds of the\r\ncalcaire grossier shows that these land animals began to exist before the\r\ndeposition of the overlying gypseous series had commenced.\r\n\r\n_Calcaire siliceux_.--This compact siliceous limestone extends over\r\na wide area. It resembles a precipitate from the waters of mineral\r\nsprings, and is often traversed by small empty sinuous cavities.\r\nIt is, for the most part, devoid of organic remains, but in some\r\nplaces contains freshwater and land species, and never any marine\r\nfossils. The siliceous limestone and the calcaire grossier occupy\r\ndistinct parts of the Paris basin, the one attaining its fullest\r\ndevelopment in those places where the other is of slight thickness.\r\nThey also alternate with each other towards the centre of the basin,\r\nas at Sergy and Osny; and there are even points where the two rocks are\r\nso blended together that portions of each may be seen in hand specimens.\r\nThus, in the same bed, at Triel, we have the compact freshwater\r\nlimestone, characterized by its _Limneae_, mingled with the coarse marine\r\nlimestone, with its small multilocular shells, or \"miliolites,\"\r\ndispersed through it in countless numbers. These microscopic testacea\r\nare also accompanied by _Cerithia_ and other shells of the calcaire\r\ngrossier. It is very extraordinary that in this instance both kinds of\r\nsediment must have been thrown down together on the same spot, yet each\r\nretains its own peculiar organic remains.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts we may conclude, that while to the north, where the bay\r\nwas probably open to the sea, a marine limestone was formed, another\r\ndeposit of freshwater origin was introduced to the southward, or at the\r\nhead of the bay; for it appears that during the Eocene period, as now, the\r\nocean was to the north, and the continent, where the great lakes existed,\r\nto the south. From that southern region we may suppose a body of fresh\r\nwater to have descended, charged with carbonate of lime and silica, the\r\nwater being perhaps in sufficient volume to freshen the upper end of the\r\nbay. The gypseous series (2. _a_, Table, p. 175.), before described, was\r\nonce supposed to be entirely subsequent in origin to the two groups, called\r\ncalcaire grossier and calcaire siliceux. But M. Prevost has pointed out\r\nthat in some localities they alternate repeatedly with both.\r\n\r\nThe gypsum, with its associated marl and limestone, is in greatest force\r\ntowards the centre of the basin, where the calcaire grossier and calcaire\r\nsiliceux are less fully developed. Hence M. Prevost infers, that while\r\nthose two principal deposits were gradually in progress, the one towards\r\nthe north, and the other towards the south, a river descending from the\r\neast may have brought down the gypseous and marly sediment.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, as highly probable, that a bay or narrow sea, 180\r\nmiles in length, would receive, at more points than one, the waters of the\r\nadjoining continent. At the same time, we must be prepared to find that\r\nthe simultaneous deposition of two or more sets of strata in one basin,\r\nsome freshwater and others marine, must have produced very complex results.\r\nBut, in proportion as it is more difficult in these cases to discover any\r\nfixed order of superposition in the associated mineral masses, so also is\r\nit more easy to explain the manner of their origin, and to reconcile their\r\nrelations to the agency of known causes. Instead of the successive\r\nirruptions and retreats of the sea, and changes in the chemical nature of\r\nthe fluid, and other speculations of the earlier geologists, we are now\r\nsimply called upon to imagine a gulf, into one extremity of which the sea\r\nentered, and at the other a large river, while other streams may have\r\nflowed in at different points, whereby an indefinite number of alternations\r\nof marine and freshwater beds would be occasioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER EOCENE, FRANCE.\r\n\r\n_Lits coquilliers_ (3. _a_, Table, p. 175.).--Below the calcaire grossier\r\nare extensive deposits of sand, in the upper parts of which some marine\r\nbeds, called \"lits coquilliers,\" occur, in which M. d'Archiac has\r\ndiscovered 200 species of shells. Many of these are peculiar, but the\r\nlarger portion appear to agree with species of the calcaire grossier, so\r\nthat the line of demarcation usually adopted between the French Lower and\r\nMiddle Eocene formations, seems not to be very strongly drawn. _Sands and\r\nplastic clay_ (3. _b_, Table, p. 175.)--At the base of the tertiary system\r\nin France are extensive deposits of sands, with occasional beds of clay\r\nused for pottery, and called \"argile plastique.\" Fossil oysters (_Ostrea\r\nbellovacina_) abound in some places, and in others there is a mixture of\r\nfluviatile shells, such as _Cyrena cuneiformis_ (fig. 187. p. 204.),\r\n_Melania inquinata_ (fig. 188.), and others, frequently met with in beds\r\noccupying the same position in the valley of the Thames. Layers of lignite\r\nalso accompany the inferior clays and sands.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the chalk at the bottom of all the tertiary strata\r\nthere is often a conglomerate or breccia of rolled and angular chalk\r\nflints, cemented by siliceous sand. These beds appear to be of littoral\r\norigin, and imply the previous emergence of some portions of the chalk,\r\nand its waste by denudation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169. _Cardium porulosum_. Paris and London basins.]\r\n\r\nThe lower sandy beds of the Paris basin are often called the sands of the\r\nSoissonais, from a district so named 50 miles N.E. of Paris. One of the\r\nshells of the formation is adduced by M. Deshayes as an example of the\r\nchanges which certain species underwent in the successive stages of their\r\nexistence. It seems that different varieties of the _Cardium porulosum_ are\r\ncharacteristic of different formations. In the Lower Eocene of the\r\nSoissonais this shell acquires but a small volume, and has many\r\npeculiarities, which disappear in the lowest beds of the calcaire grossier.\r\nIn these the shell attains its full size, and many distinctive characters,\r\nwhich are again modified in the uppermost beds of the calcaire grossier;\r\nand these last modifications of form are preserved throughout the whole of\r\nthe \"upper marine\" (or Upper Eocene) series.[197-A]\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH EOCENE FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Eocene areas of Hampshire and London are delineated in the map\r\n(fig. 153. p. 174.).\r\n\r\nThe following table will show the succession of the principal deposits\r\nfound in our island. The true place of the Bagshot sands, in this\r\nseries, was never accurately ascertained till Mr. Prestwich published,\r\nin 1847, his classification of the English Eocene strata, dividing them\r\ninto three principal formations, in which the Bagshot sands occupied\r\nthe central place.[197-B]\r\n\r\n                                                     Localities.\r\n  1.

Gyrogonites, also, or seed-vessels of _Chara_, exhibiting a\r\nsimilar specific identity, occur. At Headon Hill, on the western side of\r\nthe island, where these beds are seen in the sea-cliffs, some of the strata\r\ncontain a few marine and estuary shells, such as _Cytheraea_, _Corbula_,\r\n&c., showing a temporary occupation of the area by brackish or salt water,\r\nafter which the river or a lake seems again to have prevailed. A species\r\nof fan-palm, _Flabellaria Lamanonis_, Brong., like one which characterizes\r\nthe Parisian Eocene beds, has been recently detected by Dr. Mantell in this\r\nformation, in Whitecliff Bay, at the eastern end of the island.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the species of extinct quadrupeds already alluded to as\r\ncharacterizing the gypsum of Montmartre have been discovered by Messrs.\r\nPratt and Fox, in the Isle of Wight, chiefly at Binstead, near Ryde, as\r\n_Palaeotherium magnum_, _P. medium_, _P. minus_, _P. minimum_, _P. curtum_,\r\n_P. crassum_, also _Anoplotherium commune_, _A. secundarium_, _Dichobune\r\ncervinum_, and _Chaeropotamus Cuvieri_. In Hordwell cliff, also on the\r\nHampshire coast, several of these species, with other quadrupeds of new\r\ngenera, such as _Paloplotherium_, Owen, have been met with; and remains of\r\na remarkable carnivorous genus, _Hyaenodon_. These fossils are accompanied\r\nby the bones of _Trionyx_, and other tortoises, and by two land snakes of\r\nthe genus _Paleryx_, Owen, from 3 to 4 feet long, also a species of\r\ncrocodile, and an alligator. Among other fossils collected by Lady\r\nHastings, Sir Philip Egerton has recognized the well-known gar or bony pike\r\nof the American rivers, a ganoid fish of the genus _Lepidotus_, with its\r\nhard shining scales. The shells of Hordwell are similar to those of the\r\nfreshwater beds of the Isle of Wight, and among them are a few specifically\r\nundistinguishable from recent testacea, as _Paludina lenta_ and _Helix\r\nlabyrinthica_, the latter discovered by Mr. S. Wood, and identified with an\r\nexisting N. American helix.\r\n\r\nThe white and green marls of this freshwater series in Hampshire, and some\r\nof the accompanying limestones, often resemble those of France in mineral\r\ncharacter and colour in so striking a manner, as to suggest the idea that\r\nthe sediment was derived from the same region, or produced\r\ncontemporaneously under very similar geographical circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Barton beds._--Both in the cliffs of Headon Hill and Hordwell, already\r\nmentioned, the freshwater series rests on a mass of pure white sand without\r\nfossils, and this is seen in Barton Cliff to overlie a marine deposit, in\r\nwhich 209 species of testacea have been found. More than half of these are\r\npeculiar; and, according to Mr. Prestwich, only 11 of them common to the\r\nLondon Clay proper, being in the proportion of only 5 per cent. On the\r\nother hand, 70 of them agree with the _calcaire grossier_ shells. As this\r\nis the newest purely marine bed of the Eocene series known in England, we\r\nmight have expected that some of its peculiar fossils would be found to\r\nagree with the upper Eocene strata described in the last chapter, and\r\naccordingly some identifications have been cited with testacea, both of the\r\nBerlin and Belgian strata. It is nearly a century since Brander published,\r\nin 1766, an account of the organic remains collected from these cliffs, and\r\nhis excellent figures of the shells then deposited in the British Museum\r\nare justly admired by conchologists for their accuracy.\r\n\r\n_Bagshot Sands_ (2. _c_, Table, p. 197.).--These beds, consisting\r\nchiefly of siliceous sand, occupy extensive tracts round Bagshot, in\r\nSurrey, and in the New Forest, Hampshire. They succeed next in\r\nchronological order, and may be separated into three divisions, the\r\nupper and lower consisting of light yellow sands, and the central of\r\ndark green sands and brown clays, the whole reposing on the London clay\r\nproper.[199-A] Although the Bagshot beds are usually devoid of fossils,\r\nthey contain marine shells in some places, among which _Venericardia\r\nplanicosta_ (see fig. 171.) is abundant, with _Turritella sulcifera_ and\r\n_Nummulites laevigatus_. (See fig. 174. p. 200.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171. _Venericardia planicosta_, Lamck.\r\n\r\n_Cardita planicosta_, Deshayes.]\r\n\r\nAt Bracklesham Bay, near Chichester, in Sussex, the characteristic shells\r\nof this member of the Eocene series are best seen; among others, the huge\r\n_Cerithium giganteum_, so conspicuous in the calcaire grossier of Paris,\r\nwhere it is sometimes 2 feet in length. The volutes and cowries of this\r\nformation, as well as the lunulites and other corals, seem to favour the\r\nidea of a warm climate having prevailed, which is borne out by the\r\ndiscovery of a serpent _Palaeophis typhaeus_, exceeding, according to Mr.\r\nOwen, 20 feet in length, and allied to the Boa, Python, Coluber, and\r\nHydrus. The compressed form and diminutive size of certain caudal vertebrae\r\nindicate so much analogy with Hydrus as to induce the Hunterian professor\r\nto pronounce the extinct ophidian to have been marine.[199-B] He had\r\npreviously combated with so much success the evidence advanced, to prove\r\nthe existence in the Northern Ocean of sea-serpents in our own times, that\r\nhe will not be suspected of any undue bias in contending for their former\r\nexistence in the British Eocene seas. The climate, however, of the Middle\r\nEocene period was evidently far more genial; and amongst the companions of\r\nthe sea-serpent of Bracklesham was an extinct Gavial (_Gavialis Dixoni_,\r\nOwen), and numerous fish, such as now frequent the seas of warm latitudes,\r\nas the sword-fish (see fig. 172. p. 200.) and gigantic rays of the genus\r\nMiliobates. (See fig. 173.)\r\n\r\nOut of 193 species of testacea procured from the Bagshot and Bracklesham\r\nbeds in England, 126 occur in the French calcaire grossier. It was\r\nclearly, therefore, coeval with that part of the Parisian series more\r\nnearly than with any other. The _Nummulites laevigatus_ (see fig. 174.),\r\na fossil characteristic of the lower beds of the calcaire grossier,\r\nis abundant at Bracklesham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.

The\r\nprincipal localities of fossils in the London clay are Highgate Hill, near\r\nLondon, the island of Sheppey, and Bognor in Hampshire. Out of 133 fossil\r\nshells, Mr. Prestwich found only 20 to be common to the calcaire grossier\r\n(from which 600 species have been obtained), while 33 are common to the\r\nlits coquilliers (p. 196.), in which only 200 species are known in France.\r\nWe may presume, therefore, that the London clay proper is older than the\r\ncalcaire grossier. This may perhaps remove a difficulty which M. Adolphe\r\nBrongniart has experienced when comparing the Eocene Flora of the\r\nneighbourhoods of London and Paris. The fossil species of the island of\r\nSheppey, he observes, indicate a much more tropical climate than the Eocene\r\nFlora of France, which has been derived principally from the \"gypseous\r\nseries.\" The latter resembles the vegetation of the borders of the\r\nMediterranean rather than that of an equatorial region.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowerbank, in a valuable publication on the fossil fruits and seeds of\r\nthe island of Sheppey, near London, has described no less than thirteen\r\nfruits of palms of the recent type _Nipa_, now only found in the Molucca\r\nand Philippine islands. (See fig. 175.) These plants are allied to the\r\ncocoa-nut tribe on the one side, and on the other to the _Pandanus_, or\r\nscrew-pine. Species of cocoa-nuts are also met with, and other kinds of\r\npalms; also three species of _Anona_, or custard-apple; cucurbitaceous\r\nfruits, also (the gourd and melon family), are in considerable abundance.\r\nFruits of various species of _Acacia_ are in profusion; and, although less\r\ndecidedly tropical, imply a warm climate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175. _Nipadites ellipticus._ Bow. Fossil\r\npalm of Sheppey.]\r\n\r\nThe contiguity of land may be inferred not only from these vegetable\r\nproductions, but also from the teeth and bones of crocodiles and turtles,\r\nsince these creatures, as Mr. Conybeare has remarked, must have resorted to\r\nsome shore to lay their eggs. Of turtles there were numerous species\r\nreferred to extinct genera, and, for the most part, not equal in size to\r\nthe largest living tropical turtles. A snake, which must have been 13 feet\r\nlong, of the genus _Palaeophis_ before mentioned, has also been described by\r\nMr. Owen from Sheppey, of a different species from that of Bracklesham. A\r\ntrue crocodile, also, _Crocodilus toliapicus_, and another Saurian more\r\nnearly allied to the gravial, accompany the above fossils. A bird allied to\r\nthe vultures, and a quadruped of the new genus _Hyracotherium_, allied to\r\nthe Hyrax, Hog, and Chaeropotamus, are also among the additions made of late\r\nyears to the palaeontology of this division.\r\n\r\n[3 Illustrations: FOSSIL SHELLS OF THE LONDON CLAY.\r\n\r\nFig. 176. _Mitra scabra_.\r\n\r\nFig. 177. _Rostellaria macroptera_, Sow. One-third of nat. size.\r\n\r\nFig. 178. _Crassatella sulcata._]\r\n\r\nThe marine shells of the London clay confirm the inference derivable from\r\nthe plants and reptiles of a high temperature. Thus, many species of\r\n_Conus_, _Mitra_, and _Voluta_ occur, a large _Cypraea_, a very large\r\n_Rostellaria_, and shells of the genera _Terebellum_, _Cancellaria_,\r\n_Crassatella_, and others, with four or more species of _Nautilus_ (see\r\nfig. 182.) and other cephalopoda of extinct genera, one of the most\r\nremarkable of which is the _Belosepia_.[202-A] (See fig. 183.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179. _Nautilus centralis._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180. _Voluta athleta._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181. _Terebellum fusiforme._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182. _Aturia zigzag._ Bronn.

Sheppey.]\r\n\r\nThe above shells are accompanied by a sword-fish (_Tetrapterus priscus_,\r\nAgassiz), about 8 feet long, and a saw-fish (_Pristis bisulcatus_, Ag.),\r\nabout 10 feet in length; genera now foreign to the British seas. On the\r\nwhole, no less than 50 species of fish have been described by\r\nM. Agassiz from these beds in Sheppey, and they indicate, in his\r\nopinion, a warm climate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184. Molar of monkey (_Macacus_).]\r\n\r\n_Strata of Kyson in Suffolk._--At Kyson, a few miles east of Woodbridge, a\r\nbed of Eocene clay, 12 feet thick, underlies the red crag. Beneath it is a\r\ndeposit of yellow and white sand, of considerable interest, in consequence\r\nof many peculiar fossils contained in it. Its geological position is\r\nprobably the lowest part of the London clay proper. In this sand has been\r\nfound the first example of a fossil quadrumanous animal discovered in Great\r\nBritain, namely, the teeth and part of a jaw, shown by Mr. Owen to belong\r\nto a monkey of the genus _Macacus_ (see fig. 184.). The mammiferous\r\nfossils, first met with in the same bed, were those of an opossum\r\n(_Didelphys_) (see fig. 185.), and an insectivorous bat (fig. 186.),\r\ntogether with many teeth of fishes of the shark family. Mr. Colchester in\r\n1840 obtained other mammalian relics from Kyson, among which Mr. Owen has\r\nrecognized several teeth of the genus _Hyracotherium_, and the vertebrae of\r\na large serpent, probably a _Palaeophis_. As the remains both of the\r\n_Hyracotherium_ and _Palaeophis_ were afterwards met with in the London\r\nclay, as before remarked, these fossils confirmed the opinion previously\r\nentertained, that the Kyson sand belongs to the Eocene period. The\r\n_Macacus_, therefore, constitutes the first example of any quadrumanous\r\nanimal found in strata as old as the Eocene, or so far from the equator as\r\nlat. 52 deg. N. It was not until after the year 1836 that the existence of any\r\nfossil quadrumana was brought to light. Since that period they have been\r\nfound in France, India, and Brazil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185. Molar tooth and part of jaw of opossum.\r\nFrom Kyson.[203-A]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186. Molars of insectivorous bats, twice nat. size.\r\nFrom Kyson, Suffolk.]\r\n\r\n_Mottled or Plastic Clays_, _&c._ (3. _b_, Table, p. 197.).--No\r\nformations can be more dissimilar on the whole in mineral character than\r\nthe Eocene deposits of England and Paris; those of our own island being\r\nalmost exclusively of mechanical origin,--accumulations of mud, sand,\r\nand pebbles; while in the neighbourhood of Paris we find a great\r\nsuccession of strata composed of a coarse white limestone, and compact\r\nsiliceous limestone with beds of crystalline gypsum and siliceous\r\nsandstone, and sometimes pure flint used for millstones. Hence it is by\r\nno means an easy task to institute an exact comparison between the\r\nvarious members of the English and French series, and to settle their\r\nrespective ages. It is clear that a continual change was going on in the\r\nfauna and flora by the coming in of new species and the dying out of\r\nothers; and contemporaneous changes of geographical conditions were also\r\nin progress in consequence of the rising and sinking of the land and\r\nbottom of the sea. A particular subdivision, therefore, of time was\r\noccasionally represented in one area by land, in another by an estuary,\r\nin a third by the sea, and even where the conditions were in both\r\nareas of a marine character, there was often shallow water in one,\r\nand deep sea in another, producing a want of agreement in the state\r\nof animal life.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement, however, of the Eocene formations in France and\r\nEngland, we find an exception to this rule, for a marked similarity of\r\nmineral character reigns in the lowest division, whether in the basins\r\nof Paris, Hampshire, or London. This uniformity of aspect must be seen\r\nin order to be fully appreciated, since the beds consist simply of sand,\r\nmottled clays, and well-rolled flint pebbles, derived from the chalk,\r\nand varying in size from that of a pea to an egg. These strata may be\r\nseen at Reading, at Blackheath, near London, and at Woolwich. In some\r\nof the lowest of them, banks of oysters are observed, consisting of\r\n_Ostrea bellovicina_, so common in France in the same relative position,\r\nand _Ostrea edulina_, scarcely distinguishable from the living eatable\r\nspecies. In this formation at Bromley, Dr. Buckland found one large\r\npebble to which five full-grown oysters were affixed, in such a manner\r\nas to show that they had commenced their first growth upon it, and\r\nremained attached to it through life.\r\n\r\nIn several places, as at Woolwich on the Thames, at Newhaven in Sussex, and\r\nelsewhere, a mixture of marine and freshwater testacea distinguishes this\r\nmember of the series. Among the latter, _Melania inquinata_ (see fig. 188.)\r\nand _Cyrena cuneiformis_ are very common. They probably indicate points\r\nwhere rivers entered the Eocene sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187. _Cyrena cuneiformis_, Min. Con. Natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188. _Melania inquinata_, Des. Nat. size.\r\n\r\nSyn. _Cerithium melanoides_, Min. Con.]\r\n\r\nWith us as in France, clay of this formation is used in some places, as\r\nnear Poole in Dorsetshire, for pottery; and hence the name of plastic clay\r\nwas adopted for the group by Mr. T. Webster. Lignite also is associated\r\nwith it in some spots, as in the Paris basin.\r\n\r\nBefore the minds of geologists had become familiar with the theory of the\r\ngradual sinking of the land, and its conversion into sea at different\r\nperiods, and the consequent change from shallow to deep water, the\r\nfreshwater and littoral character of this inferior group appeared strange\r\nand anomalous. After passing through many hundred feet of London clay,\r\nproved by its fossils to have been deposited in salt water of considerable\r\ndepth, we arrive at beds of fluviatile origin. Thick masses, also, of\r\nshingle indicate the proximity of land, where the flints of the chalk were\r\nrolled into sand and pebbles, and spread continuously over wide spaces, as\r\nin the Isle of Wight, in the south of Hampshire, and near London, always\r\nappearing at the bottom of the Eocene series. It may be asked why they did\r\nnot constitute simply a narrow littoral zone, such as we might look for in\r\nstrata formed at a moderate distance from the shore. In answer to this\r\ninquiry, the student must be reminded, that wherever a gently-sloping land\r\nis gradually sinking and becoming submerged, shingle may be heaped up\r\nsuccessively over a wide area, although marine currents have no power of\r\ndispersing it simultaneously over a large space. In such cases it is not\r\nthe shingle which recedes from the coast, but the coast which recedes from\r\nthe shingle, which is formed one mass after another as often as successive\r\nportions of the land are converted into sea and others into a sea beach.\r\n\r\nThe London area appears to have been upraised before that of Hampshire, so\r\nthat it never became the receptacle of the Barton clays, nor of the\r\noverlying fluvio-marine and freshwater beds of Hordwell and the north part\r\nof the Isle of Wight. On the other hand, the Hampshire Eocene area seems to\r\nhave emerged before that of Paris, so that no marine beds of the Upper\r\nEocene era were ever thrown down in Hampshire.\r\n\r\n_Nummulitic formation of the Alps and Pyrenees._--It has long been\r\nmatter of controversy, whether the nummulitic rocks of the Alps and\r\nPyrenees should be regarded as Eocene or Cretaceous; but the number of\r\ngeologists of high authority who regard this important group as\r\nbelonging to the lowest tertiary system of Europe has for many years\r\nbeen steadily increasing. The late M. Alex. Brongniart first declared\r\nthe specific identity of many of the shells of this formation with those\r\nof the marine strata near Paris, although he obtained them from the\r\nsummit of the Diablerets, one of the loftiest of the Swiss Alps, which\r\nrises more than 10,000 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nDeposits of the same age, found on the flanks of the Pyrenees, contain also\r\na great number of shells common to the Paris and London areas, and three or\r\nfour species only which are common to the cretaceous formation.\r\n\r\nThe calcareous division consists often of a compact crystalline marble,\r\nfull of nummulites (see fig. 189.), shells of the class _Foraminifera_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189. _Nummulites_. Peyrehorade, Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n  _a._ external surface of one of the nummulites, of which longitudinal\r\n       sections are seen in the limestone.\r\n  _b._ transverse section of same.]\r\n\r\nThe nummulitic limestone of the Alps is often of great thickness, and is\r\nimmediately covered by another series of strata of dark-coloured slates,\r\nmarls, and fucoidal sandstones, to the whole of which the provincial name\r\nof \"flysch\" has been given in parts of Switzerland. The researches of Sir\r\nRoderick Murchison in the Alps in 1847 enable us to refer the whole of\r\nthese beds to the Eocene period, and it seems probable that they most\r\nnearly coincide in age with the Lower Eocene. They enter into the disturbed\r\nand loftiest portions of the Alpine chain, to the elevation of which they\r\nenable us therefore to assign a comparatively modern date.\r\n\r\nThe nummulitic formation, with its characteristic fossils, plays a far more\r\nconspicuous part than any other tertiary group in the solid framework of\r\nthe earth's crust, whether in Europe, Asia, or Africa. It often attains a\r\nthickness of many thousand feet, and extends from the Alps to the\r\nApennines. It is found in the Carpathians, and in full force in the north\r\nof Africa, as, for example, in Algeria and Morocco. It has also been traced\r\nfrom Egypt into Asia Minor, and across Persia by Bagdad to the mouths of\r\nthe Indus. It occurs not only in Cutch, but in the mountain ranges which\r\nseparate Scinde from Persia, and which form the passes leading to Caboul;\r\nand it has been followed still farther eastward into India.\r\n\r\nSome members of this lower tertiary formation in the central Alps,\r\nincluding even the superior strata called _flysch_, have been converted\r\ninto crystalline rocks, and changed into saccharoid marble, quartz,\r\nrock, and mica-schist.[206-A]\r\n\r\n\r\nEOCENE STRATA IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nIn North America the Eocene formations occupy a large area bordering the\r\nAtlantic, which increases in breadth and importance as it is traced\r\nsouthwards from Delaware and Maryland to Georgia and Alabama. They also\r\noccur in Louisiana and other states both east and west of the valley of the\r\nMississippi. At Claiborne in Alabama no less than four hundred species of\r\nmarine shells, with many echinoderms and teeth of fish, characterize one\r\nmember of this system. Among the shells the _Cardita planicosta_, before\r\nmentioned (fig. 171. p. 199.), is in abundance; and this fossil, and some\r\nothers identical with European species, or very nearly allied to them, make\r\nit highly probable that the Claiborne beds agree in age with the central or\r\nBracklesham group of England, and the calcaire grossier of Paris.[206-B]\r\n\r\nHigher in the series is a remarkable calcareous rock, formerly called \"the\r\nnummulite limestone,\" from the great number of discoid bodies resembling\r\nnummulites which it contains, fossils now referred by A. d'Orbigny to the\r\ngenus _Orbitoides_, which has been demonstrated by Dr. Carpenter to belong\r\nto the Foraminifera.[206-C] The following section will enable the reader to\r\nunderstand the position of the three subdivisions of the series, Nos. 1,\r\n2, and 3., the relations of which I ascertained in Clarke County, between\r\nthe rivers Alabama and Tombeckbee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.

Age unknown.]\r\n\r\nThe lowest set of strata, No. 1., having a thickness of more than 100\r\nfeet, comprise marly beds, in which the _Ostrea sellaeformis_ occurs, a\r\nshell ranging from Alabama to Virginia, and being a representative form\r\nof the _Ostrea flabellula_ of the Eocene group of Europe. In others beds\r\nof No. 1., two European shells, _Cardita planicosta_, before mentioned,\r\nand _Solarium canaliculatum_ are found, with a great many other species\r\npeculiar to America. Numerous corals, also, and the remains of placoid\r\nfish and of rays occur, and the \"swords,\" as they are called, of sword\r\nfishes, all bearing a great generic likeness to those of the Eocene\r\nstrata of England and France.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. (fig. 190.) is a white limestone, sometimes soft and argillaceous,\r\nbut in parts very compact and calcareous. It contains several peculiar\r\ncorals, and a large Nautilus allied to _N. zigzag_, also in its upper bed a\r\ngigantic cetacean, called _Zeuglodon_ by Owen.[207-A]\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: _Zeuglodon cetoides_, Owen. _Basilosaurus_, Harlan.]\r\n\r\nFig. 191. Molar tooth, natural size.]\r\n\r\nFig. 192. Vertebra, reduced.]\r\n\r\nThe colossal bones of this cetacean are so plentiful in the interior of\r\nClarke County as to be characteristic of the formation. The vertebral\r\ncolumn of one skeleton found by Dr. Buckley at a spot visited by me,\r\nextended to the length of nearly 70 feet, and not far off part of another\r\nbackbone nearly 50 feet long was dug up. I obtained evidence, during a\r\nshort excursion, of so many localities of this fossil animal within a\r\ndistance of 10 miles, as to lead me to conclude that they must have\r\nbelonged to at least forty distinct individuals.\r\n\r\nMr. Owen first pointed out that the huge animal was not reptilian, since\r\neach tooth was furnished with double roots (see fig. 191.), implanted in\r\ncorresponding double sockets; and his opinion of the cetacean nature of\r\nthe fossil was afterwards confirmed by Dr. Wyman and Professor R. W.\r\nGibbes. That it was an extinct species of the whale tribe has since been\r\nplaced beyond all doubt by the discovery of the entire skull of another\r\nfossil of the same family, found to have the double occipital condyles\r\nonly met with in mammals, and the convoluted tympanic bones which are\r\ncharacteristic of cetaceans.\r\n\r\nNear the junction of No. 2. and the incumbent limestone, No. 3., next to be\r\nmentioned, are strata characterized by the following shells: Spondylus\r\ndumosus (_Plagiostoma dumosum_, Morton), _Pecten Poulsoni_, _Pecten\r\nperplanus_, and _Ostrea cretacea_.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. (fig. 190.) is a white limestone, for the most part made up of the\r\n_Orbitoides_ of d'Orbigny before mentioned (p. 206.), formerly supposed to\r\nbe a nummulite, and called _N. Mantelli_, mixed with a few lunulites and\r\nsmall corals and shells.[208-A] The origin of this cream-coloured soft\r\nstone, like that of our white chalk, which it much resembles, is, I\r\nbelieve, due to the decomposition of the orbitoides. The surface of the\r\ncountry where it prevails is sometimes marked by the absence of wood, like\r\nour chalk downs, or is covered exclusively by the _Juniperus Virginiana_,\r\nas certain chalk districts in England by yew trees and juniper.\r\n\r\nSome of the shells of this limestone are common to the Claiborne beds, but\r\nmany of them are peculiar.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen in the section (fig. 190. p. 155.) that the strata, Nos. 1,\r\n2, 3., are, for the most part, overlaid by a dense formation of sand or\r\nclay without fossils. In some points of the bluff or cliff of the Alabama\r\nriver, at Claiborne, the beds Nos. 1, 2., are exposed nearly from top to\r\nbottom, whereas at other points the newer formation, No. 4., occupies the\r\nface of nearly the whole cliff. The age of this overlying mass has not yet\r\nbeen determined, as it has hitherto proved destitute of organic remains.\r\n\r\nThe burr-stone strata of the Southern States contain so many fossils\r\nagreeing with those of Claiborne, that it doubtless belongs to the same\r\npart of the Eocene group, though I was not fortunate enough to see the\r\nrelations of the two deposits in a continuous section. Mr. Tuomey considers\r\nit as the lower portion of the series. It may, perhaps, be a form of the\r\nClaiborne beds in places where lime was wanting, and where silex, derived\r\nfrom the decomposition of felspar, predominated. It consists chiefly of\r\nslaty clays, quartzose sands, and loam, of a brick red colour, with layers\r\nof chert or burr-stone, used in some places for millstones.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[191-A] Leyde Magaz. voor Wetensch Konst en Lett., partie v. cahier i. p.\r\n71.

Table, p. 103.), because in those parts of Europe\r\nwhere it was first studied its upper members are formed of that\r\nremarkable white earthy limestone, termed chalk (_creta_). The inferior\r\ndivision consists, for the most part, of clays and sands, called\r\nGreensand, because some of the sands derive a bright green colour from\r\nintermixed grains of chloritic matter. The cretaceous strata in the\r\nnorth-west of Europe may be thus divided[209-A]:\r\n\r\n                       _Upper Cretaceous._\r\n\r\n  1. Maestricht beds and Faxoe limestone.\r\n  2. Upper white chalk, with flints.\r\n  3. Lower white chalk, without flints, passing downwards into chalk marl,\r\n     which is slightly argillaceous.\r\n  4. Upper greensand.\r\n  5. Gault.\r\n\r\n                       _Lower Cretaceous._\r\n\r\n  6. Lower greensand--Ironsand, clay, and occasional beds of limestone\r\n    (Kentish rag).\r\n\r\n_Maestricht Beds._--On the banks of the Meuse, at Maestricht, reposing on\r\nordinary white chalk with flints, we find an upper calcareous formation\r\nabout 100 feet thick, the fossils of which are, on the whole, very\r\npeculiar, and all distinct from tertiary species. Some few are of species\r\ncommon to the inferior white chalk, among which may be mentioned\r\n_Belemnites mucronatus_ (see fig. 197.) and _Pecten quadricostatus_.\r\nBesides the Belemnite there are other _genera_, such as Ammonite, Baculite,\r\nand Hamite, never found in strata newer than the cretaceous, but frequently\r\nmet with in these Maestricht beds. On the other hand, Volutes and other\r\ngenera of univalve shells, usually met with only in tertiary strata, occur.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the rock, about 20 feet thick, as seen in St. Peter's\r\nMount, in the suburbs of Maestricht, abounds in corals, often detachable\r\nfrom the matrix; and these beds are succeeded by a soft yellowish\r\nlimestone 50 feet thick, extensively quarried from time immemorial for\r\nbuilding. The stone below is whiter, and contains occasional nodules of\r\ngrey chert or chalcedony.\r\n\r\nM. Bosquet, with whom I lately examined this formation (August, 1850),\r\npointed out to me a layer of chalk from 2 to 4 inches thick, containing\r\ngreen earth and numerous encrinital stems, which forms the line of\r\ndemarcation between the strata containing the fossils peculiar to\r\nMaestricht and the white chalk below. The latter is distinguished by\r\nregular layers of black flint in nodules, and by several shells, such as\r\n_Terebratula carnea_ (see fig. 201.), wholly wanting in beds higher than\r\nthe green band. Some of the organic remains, however, for which St. Peter's\r\nMount is celebrated, occur both above and below that parting layer, and,\r\namong others, the great marine reptile, called _Mosasaurus_, a saurian\r\nsupposed to have been 24 feet in length, of which the entire skull and a\r\ngreat part of the skeleton have been found. Such remains are chiefly met\r\nwith in the soft freestone, the principal member of the Maestricht beds.\r\n\r\n_Chalk of Faxoe._--In the island of Seeland, in Denmark, the newest member\r\nof the chalk series, seen in the sea-cliffs at Stevens Klint resting on\r\nwhite chalk with flints, is a yellow limestone, a portion of which, at\r\nFaxoe, where it is used as a building-stone, is composed of corals, even\r\nmore conspicuously than is usually observed in recent coral reefs. It has\r\nbeen quarried to the depth of more than 40 feet, but its thickness is\r\nunknown. The imbedded shells are chiefly casts, many of them of univalve\r\nmollusca, which, as they strictly belong to the Cretaceous era, are worthy\r\nof notice, since such forms, whether spiral or patelliform, are wanting in\r\nthe white chalk of Europe generally. Thus, there are two species of\r\n_Cypraea_, one of _Oliva_, two of _Mitra_, four of the genus _Cerithium_,\r\nsix of _Fusus_, two of _Trochus_, one _Patella_, one _Emarginula_, &c., on\r\nthe whole, more than thirty univalves, spiral or patelliform, not one of\r\nwhich is common to the white chalk. At the same time, a large proportion of\r\nthe accompanying bivalve shells, echinoderms, and zoophytes, are\r\nspecifically identical with fossils of older parts of the Cretaceous\r\nseries. Among the cephalopoda of Faxoe, may be mentioned _Baculites\r\nFaujasii_ and _Belemnites mucronatus_, shells of the white chalk.\r\n\r\nThe claws and entire shell of a small crab, _Brachyurus rugosus_\r\n(Schlotheim), are scattered through the Faxoe stone, reminding us of\r\nsimilar crustaceans enclosed in the rocks of many modern coral\r\nreefs.[211-A] Some small portions of this coralline formation consist of\r\nwhite earthy chalk; it is, therefore, clear that this substance must\r\nhave been produced simultaneously, a fact of some importance, as bearing\r\non the theory of the origin of white chalk; for the decomposition of\r\nsuch corals as we see at Faxoe is capable, we know, of forming white\r\nmud, undistinguishable from chalk, and which we may suppose to have\r\nbeen dispersed far and wide through the ocean, in which such reefs as\r\nthat of Faxoe grew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193. Section from Hertfordshire, in England, to\r\nSena, in France.]\r\n\r\n_White Chalk_ (2. and 3. Tab. p. 209.).--The highest beds of chalk in\r\nEngland and France consist of a pure, white, calcareous mass, usually\r\ntoo soft for a building stone, but sometimes passing into a more solid\r\nstate. It consists, almost purely, of carbonate of lime; the\r\nstratification is often obscure, except where rendered distinct by\r\ninterstratified layers of flint, a few inches thick, occasionally in\r\ncontinuous beds, but oftener in nodules, and recurring at intervals from\r\n2 to 4 feet distant from each other.\r\n\r\nThis upper chalk is usually succeeded, in the descending order, by a great\r\nmass of white chalk without flints, below which comes the chalk marl, in\r\nwhich there is a slight admixture of argillaceous matter. The united\r\nthickness of the three divisions in the south of England equals, in some\r\nplaces, 1000 feet.[211-B]\r\n\r\nThe annexed section, fig. 193., will show the manner in which the white\r\nchalk extends from England into France, covered by the tertiary strata\r\ndescribed in former chapters, and reposing on lower cretaceous beds.\r\n\r\nAmong the conspicuous forms of mollusca wholly foreign to the tertiary and\r\nrecent periods, and which we meet with in the white chalk, are the\r\nBelemnite, Ammonite, Baculite, and Turrilite, all genera of _Cephalopoda_,\r\na family to which the living cuttle-fish and nautilus belong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194. Portion of _Baculites Faujasii_. Maestricht and\r\nFaxoe beds and white chalk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195. Portion of _Baculites anceps_.

These shells are known to live at the bottom of the sea, where\r\nthe water is tranquil and of some depth (see figs. 198, 199, 200, 201.).\r\nWith these are associated some forms of oyster (see figs. 202. and 204.),\r\nand other bivalves (figs. 203, 205, 206, 207, 208.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198. _Terebratula plicatilis_, dorsal view.\r\nUpper white chalk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199. _Terebratula plicatilis_, side view.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200. _Terebratula pumilus._ (_Magas pumilus_, Sow.)\r\nUpper white chalk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201. _Terebratula carnea._ Upper white chalk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202. _Ostrea vesicularis._ _Gryphaea globosa_, Min.

Upper white chalk.]\r\n\r\nAmong the rest, no form marks the cretaceous era in Europe, America, and\r\nIndia, in a more striking manner than the extinct genus _Inoceramus_\r\n(_Catillus_ of Lamk.), the shells of which are distinguished by a\r\nfibrous texture, and are often met with in fragments, having, probably,\r\nbeen extremely friable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208. _Inoceramus Lamarckii._\r\n\r\nSyn. _Catillus Lamarckii_.\r\n\r\nWhite Chalk (Dixon's Geol.

A branching sponge in a flint, from\r\nthe white chalk. From the collection of Mr. Bowerbank.]\r\n\r\nWith these mollusca are many corals (figs. 209, 210, 211.) and sea urchins\r\n(fig. 212.), which are alike marine, and, for the most part, indicative of\r\na deep sea. They are dispersed indifferently through the soft chalk, and\r\nhard flint, and some of the flinty nodules owe their irregular forms to\r\ninclosed zoophytes, as in the specimen represented in fig. 211., where the\r\nhollows in the exterior are caused by the branches of a sponge seen on\r\nbreaking open the flint, fig. 210.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212. _Ananchytes ovata_.

This species has been referred to\r\n_Hippurites_, but does not, I believe, fully agree in character with that\r\ngenus. I have never seen the opercular piece, or _valve_, as it is called\r\nby those conchologists who regard the _Rudistes_ as bivalve mollusca. The\r\nspecimen above figured was discovered by the late Mr. Dixon.]\r\n\r\nThe remains of fishes of the Upper Cretaceous formations consist chiefly\r\nof teeth of the shark family of genera, in part common to the tertiary,\r\nand partly distinct. But we meet with no bones of land animals, nor any\r\nterrestrial or fluviatile shells, nor any plants, except sea weeds, and\r\nhere and there a piece of drift wood. All the appearances concur in\r\nleading us to conclude that the white chalk was the product of an open\r\nsea of considerable depth.\r\n\r\nThe existence of turtles and oviparous saurians, and of a Pterodactyl or\r\nwinged-lizard, found in the white chalk of Maidstone, implies, no doubt,\r\nsome neighbouring land; but a few small islets in mid-ocean, like\r\nAscension, so much frequented by migratory droves of turtles, might perhaps\r\nhave afforded the required retreat where these creatures might lay their\r\neggs in the sand, or from which the flying species may have been blown out\r\nto sea. Of the vegetation of such islands we have scarcely any indication,\r\nbut it consisted partly of cycadeous plants; for a fragment of one of these\r\nwas found by Capt. Ibbetson in the chalk marl of the Isle of Wight, and is\r\nreferred by A. Brongniart to _Clathraria Lyellii_, Mantell, a species\r\ncommon to the antecedent Wealden period.\r\n\r\n_Geographical extent and origin of the While Chalk._--The area over\r\nwhich the white chalk preserves a nearly homogeneous aspect is so vast,\r\nthat the earlier geologists despaired of discovering any analogous\r\ndeposits of recent date. Pure chalk, of nearly uniform aspect and\r\ncomposition, is met with in a north-west and south-east direction, from\r\nthe north of Ireland to the Crimea, a distance of about 1140\r\ngeographical miles; and in an opposite direction it extends from the\r\nsouth of Sweden to the south of Bordeaux, a distance of about 840\r\ngeographical miles. In Southern Russia, according to Sir R. Murchison,\r\nit is sometimes 600 feet thick, and retains the same mineral character\r\nas in France and England, with the same fossils, including _Inoceramus\r\nCuvieri_, _Belemnites mucronatus_, and _Ostrea vesicularis_.\r\n\r\nBut it would be an error to imagine, that the chalk was ever spread out\r\ncontinuously over the whole of the space comprised within these limits,\r\nalthough it prevailed in greater or less thickness over large portions of\r\nthat area. On turning to those regions of the Pacific where coral reefs\r\nabound, we find some archipelagoes of lagoon islands, such as that of the\r\nDangerous Archipelago, for instance, and that of Radack, with several\r\nadjoining groups, which are from 1100 to 1200 miles in length, and 300 or\r\n400 miles broad; and the space to which Flinders proposed to give the name\r\nof the Corralline Sea is still larger; for it is bounded on the east by the\r\nAustralian barrier--all formed of coral rock,--on the west by New\r\nCaledonia, and on the north by the reefs of Louisiade. Although the islands\r\nin these areas may be thinly sown, the mud of the decomposing zoophytes may\r\nbe scattered far and wide by oceanic currents. That this mud would resemble\r\nchalk I have already hinted when speaking of the Faxoe limestone, p. 211.;\r\nand it was also remarked in an early part of this volume, that some even of\r\nthat chalk which appears to an ordinary observer quite destitute of organic\r\nremains, is nevertheless, when seen under the microscope, full of fragments\r\nof corals and sponges; together with the valves of entomostraca, the shells\r\nof foraminifera, and still more minute infusoria.[215-A] (See p. 26.)\r\n\r\nNow it had been often suspected, before these discoveries, that white\r\nchalk might be of animal origin, even where every trace of organic\r\nstructure has vanished. This bold idea was partly founded on the fact,\r\nthat the chalk consisted of pure carbonate of lime, such as would result\r\nfrom the decomposition of testacea, echini, and corals; and partly on\r\nthe passage observable between these fossils when half decomposed and\r\nchalk. But this conjecture seemed to many naturalists quite vague and\r\nvisionary, until its probability was strengthened by new evidence\r\nbrought to light by modern geologists.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Lieutenant Nelson, that, in the Bermuda Islands, there are\r\nseveral basins or lagoons almost surrounded and enclosed by reefs of\r\ncoral. At the bottom of these lagoons a soft white calcareous mud is\r\nformed by the decomposition of _Eschara_, _Flustra_, _Cellepora_, and\r\nother corallines. This mud, when dried, is undistinguishable from common\r\nwhite earthy chalk; and some portions of it, presented to the Museum of\r\nthe Geological Society of London, might, after full examination, be\r\nmistaken for ancient chalk, but for the labels attached to them. About\r\nthe same time Mr. C. Darwin observed similar facts in the coral islands\r\nof the Pacific; and came also to the opinion, that much of the soft\r\nwhite mud found at the bottom of the sea near coral reefs has passed\r\nthrough the bodies of worms, by which the stony masses of coral are\r\neverywhere bored; and other portions through the intestines of fishes;\r\nfor certain gregarious fishes of the genus _Sparus_ are visible through\r\nthe clear water, browsing quietly, in great numbers, on living corals,\r\nlike grazing herds of graminivorous quadrupeds. On opening their bodies,\r\nMr. Darwin found their intestines filled with impure chalk. This\r\ncircumstance is the more in point, when we recollect how the fossilist\r\nwas formerly puzzled by meeting, in chalk, with certain bodies, called\r\ncones of the larch, which were afterwards recognized by Dr. Buckland to\r\nbe the excrement of fish.[216-A] These spiral coprolites (see figures),\r\nlike the scales and bones of fossil fish in the chalk, are composed\r\nchiefly of phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Fig. 217. Fig. 218. Coprolites of fish called\r\n_Iulo-eido-copri_, from the chalk.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dana, when describing the elevated coral reef of Oahu, in the Sandwich\r\nIslands, says, that some varieties of the rock consist of aggregated\r\nshells, imbedded in a compact calcareous base as firm in texture as any\r\nsecondary limestone; while others are like chalk, having its colour, its\r\nearthy fracture, its soft homogeneous texture, and being an equally good\r\nwriting material. The same author describes, in many growing coral reefs, a\r\nsimilar formation of modern chalk, undistinguishable from the\r\nancient.[216-B] The extension over a wide submarine area of the calcareous\r\nmatrix of the chalk, as well as of the imbedded fossils, would take place\r\nthe more readily, in consequence of the low specific gravity of the shells\r\nof mollusca and zoophytes, when compared with ordinary sand and mineral\r\nmatter. The mud also derived from their decomposition would be much lighter\r\nthan argillaceous and other inorganic mud, and very easily transported by\r\ncurrents, especially in salt water.\r\n\r\n_Single pebbles in chalk._--The general absence of sand and pebbles in\r\nthe white chalk has been already mentioned; but the occurrence here and\r\nthere, in the south-east of England, of a few isolated pebbles of quartz\r\nand green schist, some of them 2 or 3 inches in diameter, has justly\r\nexcited much wonder. If these had been carried to the spots where we now\r\nfind them by waves or currents from the lands once bordering the\r\ncretaceous sea, how happened it that no sand or mud were transported\r\nthither at the same time? We cannot conceive such rounded stones to have\r\nbeen drifted like erratic blocks by ice[217-A], for that would imply a\r\ncold climate in the Cretaceous period; a supposition inconsistent with\r\nthe luxuriant growth of large chambered univalves, numerous corals, and\r\nmany fish, and other fossils of tropical forms.\r\n\r\nNow in Keeling Island, one of those detached masses of coral which rise up\r\nin the wide Pacific, Captain Ross found a single fragment of greenstone,\r\nwhere every other particle of matter was calcareous; and Mr. Darwin\r\nconcludes that it must have come there entangled in the roots of a large\r\ntree. He reminds us that Chamisso, the distinguished naturalist who\r\naccompanied Kotzebue, affirms, that the inhabitants of the Radack\r\narchipelago, a group of lagoon islands, in the midst of the Pacific,\r\nobtained stones for sharpening their instruments by searching the roots of\r\ntrees which are cast up on the beach.[217-B]\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be objected, that a similar mode of transport cannot have\r\nhappened in the cretaceous sea, because fossil wood is very rare in the\r\nchalk. Nevertheless wood is sometimes met with, and in the same parts of\r\nthe chalk where the pebbles are found, both in soft stone and in a\r\nsilicified state in flints. In these cases it has often every appearance of\r\nhaving been floated from a distance, being usually perforated by\r\nboring-shells, such as the _Teredo_ and _Fistulana_.[217-C]\r\n\r\nThe only other mode of transport which suggests itself is sea-weed. Dr.\r\nBeck informs me, that in the Lym-Fiord, in Jutland, the _Fucus\r\nvesiculosus_, often called kelp, sometimes grows to the height of 10\r\nfeet, and the branches rising from a single root form a cluster several\r\nfeet in diameter. When the bladders are distended, the plant becomes so\r\nbuoyant as to float up loose stones several inches in diameter, and\r\nthese are often thrown by the waves high up on the beach. The _Fucus\r\ngiganteus_ of Solander, so common in Terra del Fuego, is said by Captain\r\nCook to attain the length of 360 feet, although the stem is not much\r\nthicker than a man's thumb. It is often met with floating at sea, with\r\nshells attached, several hundred miles from the spots where it grew.\r\nSome of these plants, says Mr. Darwin, were found adhering to large\r\nloose stones in the inland channels of Terra del Fuego, during the\r\nvoyage of the Beagle in 1834; and that so firmly, that the stones were\r\ndrawn up from the bottom into the boat, although so heavy that they\r\ncould scarcely be lifted in by one person. Some fossil sea-weeds have\r\nbeen found in the Cretaceous formation, but none, as yet, of large size.\r\n\r\nBut we must not imagine that because pebbles are so rare in the white\r\nchalk of England and France there are no proofs of sand, shingle, and\r\nclay having been accumulated contemporaneously even in the European\r\nseas. The siliceous sandstone, called \"upper quader\" by the Germans,\r\noverlies white argillaceous chalk, or \"plaener-kalk,\" a deposit\r\nresembling in composition and organic remains the chalk marl of the\r\nEnglish series. This sandstone contains as many fossil shells common to\r\nour white chalk as could be expected in a sea-bottom formed of such\r\ndifferent materials. It sometimes attains a thickness of 600 feet, and\r\nby its jointed structure and vertical precipices, plays a conspicuous\r\npart in the picturesque scenery of Saxon Switzerland, near Dresden.\r\n\r\n_Upper greensand_ (4. Tab. p. 209.).--The lower chalk without flints passes\r\ngradually downwards, in the south of England, into an argillaceous\r\nlimestone, \"the chalk marl,\" already alluded to, in which ammonites and\r\nother cephalopoda, so rare in the higher parts of the series, appear. This\r\nmarly deposit passes in its turn into beds containing green particles of a\r\nchloritic mineral, called the upper greensand. In parts of Surrey\r\ncalcareous matter is largely intermixed, forming a stone called\r\n_firestone_. In the cliffs of the southern coast of the Isle of Wight, this\r\nupper greensand is 100 feet thick, and contains bands of siliceous\r\nlimestone and calcareous sandstone with nodules of chert.\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Fossils of the Upper Greensand.\r\n\r\nFig. 219.\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Terebratula lyra._       } Upper greensand.\r\n  _b._ Same, seen in profile.    } France.\r\n\r\nFig. 220. _Ammonites Rhotomagensis._ Upper greensand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221. _Hamites spiniger_ (Fitton);\r\nnear Folkstone. Gault.]\r\n\r\n_Gault._--The lowest member of the upper Cretaceous group, usually about\r\n100 feet thick in the S.E. of England, is provincially termed Gault. It\r\nconsists of a dark blue marl, sometimes intermixed with greensand. Many\r\npeculiar forms of cephalopoda, such as the _Hamite_ (fig. 221.) and\r\n_Scaphite_, with other fossils, characterize this formation, which, small\r\nas is its thickness, can be traced by its organic remains to distant parts\r\nof Europe, as, for example, to the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe phosphate of lime, found lately near Farnham, in Surrey, in such\r\nabundance as to be used largely by the agriculturist for fertilizing soils,\r\noccurs exclusively, according to Mr. R. A. C. Austen, in the upper\r\ngreensand and gault. It is doubtless of animal origin, and partly\r\ncoprolitic, probably derived from the excrement of fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER CRETACEOUS DIVISION. (No. 6. Tab. p. 209.)\r\n\r\nThat part of the Cretaceous series which is older than the Gault has been\r\ncommonly called the Lower Greensand. The greater number of its fossils are\r\nspecifically distinct from those of the upper cretaceous system. Dr.\r\nFitton, to whom we are indebted for an excellent monograph on this\r\nformation as developed in England, gives the following as the succession of\r\nrocks seen in parts of Kent.\r\n\r\n  No. 1. Sand, white, yellowish, or ferruginous, with\r\n         concretions of limestone and chert                70 feet.\r\n      2. Sand with green matter                            70 to 100 feet.\r\n      3. Calcareous stone, called Kentish rag              60 to 80 feet.\r\n\r\nIn his detailed description of the fine section displayed at Atherfield,\r\nin the south of the Isle of Wight, we find the limestone wholly wanting;\r\nin fact, the variations in the mineral composition of this group, even\r\nin contiguous districts, is very great; and on comparing the Atherfield\r\nbeds with corresponding strata at Hythe in Kent, distant 95 miles,\r\nthe whole series has lost half its thickness, and presents a very\r\ndissimilar aspect.[219-A]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Professor E. Forbes has shown that when the sixty-three\r\nstrata at Atherfield are severally examined, the total thickness of which\r\nhe gives as 843 feet, there are some fossils which range through the whole\r\nseries, others which are peculiar to particular divisions. As a proof that\r\nall belong chronologically to one system, he states that whenever similar\r\nconditions are repeated in overlying strata the same species reappear.\r\nChanges of depth, or of the mineral nature of the bottom, the presence or\r\nabsence of lime or of peroxide of iron, the occurrence of a muddy, or a\r\nsandy, or a gravelly bottom, are marked by the banishment of certain\r\nspecies and the predominance of others. But these differences of conditions\r\nbeing mineral, chemical, and local in their nature, have nothing to do with\r\nthe extinction, throughout a large area, of certain animals or plants. The\r\nrule laid down by this eminent naturalist for enabling us to test the\r\narrival of a new state of things in the animate world, is the\r\nrepresentation by new and different species of corresponding genera of\r\nmollusca or other beings. When the forms proper to loose sand or soft clay,\r\nor a stony or calcareous bottom, or a moderate or a great depth of water,\r\nrecur with all the same species, the interval of time has been,\r\ngeologically speaking, small, however dense the mass of matter accumulated.\r\nBut if, the genera remaining the same, the species are changed, we have\r\nentered upon a new period; and no similarity of climate, or of geographical\r\nand local conditions, can then recall the old species which a long series\r\nof destructive causes in the animate and inanimate world has gradually\r\nannihilated. On passing from the lower greensand to the gault, we suddenly\r\nreach one of these new epochs, scarcely any of the fossil species being\r\ncommon to the lower and upper cretaceous systems, a break in the chain\r\nimplying no doubt many missing links in the series of geological monuments\r\nwhich we may some day be able to supply.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest and most abundant shells in the lowest strata of the\r\nlower greensand, as displayed in the Atherfield section, is the large\r\n_Perna mulleti_ of which a reduced figure is here given (fig. 222.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222. _Perna mulleti._ Desh. in Leym.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Exterior.\r\n  _b._ Hinge of upper valve.]\r\n\r\nIn the south of England, during the accumulation of the lower greensand\r\nabove described, the bed of the sea appears to have been continually\r\nsinking, from the commencement of the period, when the freshwater\r\nWealden beds were submerged, to the deposition of those strata on which\r\nthe gault immediately reposes.\r\n\r\nPebbles of quartzose sandstone, jasper, and flinty slate, together with\r\ngrains of chlorite and mica, speak plainly of the nature of the\r\npre-existing rocks, from the wearing down of which the greensand beds\r\nwere derived. The land, consisting of such rocks, was doubtless\r\nsubmerged before the origin of the white chalk, as corals can only\r\nmultiply in the clear waters of the sea in spaces to which no mud or\r\nsand are conveyed by currents.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIPPURITE LIMESTONE.\r\n\r\n_Difference between the chalk of the north and south of Europe._--By the\r\naid of the three tests of relative age, namely, superposition, mineral\r\ncharacter, and fossils, the geologist has been enabled to refer to the same\r\nCretaceous period certain rocks in the north and south of Europe, which\r\ndiffer greatly, both in their fossil contents and in their mineral\r\ncomposition and structure.\r\n\r\nIf we attempt to trace the cretaceous deposits from England and France to\r\nthe countries bordering the Mediterranean, we perceive, in the first place,\r\nthat the chalk and Greensand in the neighbourhood of London and Paris form\r\none great continuous mass, the Straits of Dover being a trifling\r\ninterruption, a mere valley with chalk cliffs on both sides. We then\r\nobserve that the main body of the chalk which surrounds Paris stretches\r\nfrom Tours to near Poitiers (see the annexed map, fig. 223., in which the\r\nshaded part represents chalk).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223. Map of south-western France.]\r\n\r\nBetween Poitiers and La Rochelle, the space marked A on the map separates\r\ntwo regions of chalk. This space is occupied by the Oolite and certain\r\nother formations older than the Chalk, and has been supposed by M. E. de\r\nBeaumont to have formed an island in the cretaceous sea. South of this\r\nspace we again meet with a formation which we at once recognize by its\r\nmineral character to be chalk, although there are some places where the\r\nrock becomes oolitic. The fossils are, upon the whole, very similar;\r\nespecially certain species of the genera _Spatangus_, _Ananchytes_,\r\n_Cidarites_, _Nucula_, _Ostrea_, _Gryphaea_ (_Exogyra_), _Pecten_,\r\n_Plagiostoma_ (_Lima_), _Trigonia_, _Catillus_, (_Inoceramus_), and\r\n_Terebratula_.[221-A] But _Ammonites_, as M. d'Archiac observes, of which\r\nso many species are met with in the chalk of the north of France, are\r\nscarcely ever found in the southern region; while the genera _Hamite_,\r\n_Turrilite_, and _Scaphite_, and perhaps _Belemnite_, are entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, certain forms are common in the south which are rare or\r\nwholly unknown in the north of France. Among these may be mentioned many\r\n_Hippurites_, _Sphaerulites_, and other members of that great family of\r\nmollusca called _Rudistes_ by Lamarck, to which nothing analogous has been\r\ndiscovered in the living creation, but which is quite characteristic of\r\nrocks of the Cretaceous era in the south of France, Spain, Sicily, Greece,\r\nand other countries bordering the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224.\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Radiolites radiosus_, D'Orb.

The flutings, or smooth, rounded,\r\nlongitudinal ribs, representing the form of the interior, are wholly\r\nunlike the hippurite itself, and in some individuals, which attain a great\r\nsize and length, are very conspicuous.\r\n\r\nBetween the region of chalk last mentioned in which Perigueux is situated,\r\nand the Pyrenees, the space B intervenes. (See Map, p. 221.) Here the\r\ntertiary strata cover, and for the most part conceal, the cretaceous rocks,\r\nexcept in some spots where they have been laid open by the denudation of\r\nnewer formations. In these places they are seen still preserving the form\r\nof a white chalky rock, which is charged in part with grains of green sand.\r\nEven as far south as Tercis, on the Adour, near Dax, where I examined them\r\nin 1828, the cretaceous rocks retain this character. In that region M.\r\nGrateloup has found in them _Ananchytes ovata_ (fig. 212.), and other\r\nfossils of the English chalk, together with _Hippurites_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORA OF THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fossil plants of the Cretaceous era at present known are\r\nfew in number, the rocks being principally marine, they suffice,\r\naccording to M. Ad. Brongniart, to show a transition character between\r\nthe vegetation of the secondary and that of the tertiary formations. The\r\ntertiary strata, when compared to the older rocks, are marked by the\r\npredominance of _Exogens_, which now constitute three-fourths of the\r\nliving plants of the globe.[223-A]\r\n\r\nThese exogens are wanting in the secondary strata generally, but in the\r\nCretaceous period they equal in number the _Gymnogens_ (_Coniferae_ and\r\n_Cycadeae_) which abounded so much in the preceding Oolitic period, and\r\ndisappeared before the Eocene rocks were formed.[223-B] The discovery of a\r\ntree-fern in the ferruginous sands of the Lower Cretaceous group of the\r\ndepartment of Ardennes in France is one of many signs of the contrast of\r\nthe flora, and doubtless of the climate, of this era with that of the\r\nPliocene and Modern periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRETACEOUS ROCKS IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nIf we pass to the American continent, we find in the state of New Jersey a\r\nseries of sandy and argillaceous beds wholly unlike our Upper Cretaceous\r\nsystem; which we can, nevertheless, recognize as referable,\r\npaleontologically, to the same division.\r\n\r\nThat they were about the same age generally as the European chalk and\r\ngreensand, was the conclusion to which Dr. Morton and Mr. Conrad came after\r\ntheir investigation of the fossils in 1834. The strata consist chiefly of\r\ngreensand and green marl, with an overlying coralline limestone of a pale\r\nyellow colour, and the fossils, on the whole, agree most nearly with those\r\nof the upper European series, from the Maestricht beds to the gault\r\ninclusive. I collected sixty shells from the New Jersey deposits in 1841;\r\nfive of which were identical with European species--_Ostrea larva_, _O.\r\nvesicularis_, _Gryphaea costata_, _Pecten quinque-costatus_, _Belemnites\r\nmucronatus_. As some of these have the greatest vertical range in Europe,\r\nthey might be expected more than any others to recur in distant parts of\r\nthe globe. Even where the species are different, the generic forms, such as\r\nthe Baculite and certain sections of Ammonites, as also the Inoceramus (see\r\nabove, fig. 208.) and other bivalves, have a decidedly cretaceous aspect.\r\nFifteen out of the sixty shells above alluded to, were regarded by\r\nProfessor Forbes as good geographical representatives of well-known\r\ncretaceous fossils of Europe. The correspondence, therefore, is not small,\r\nwhen we reflect that the part of the United States where these strata occur\r\nis between 3000 and 4000 miles distant from the chalk of Central and\r\nNorthern Europe, and that there is a difference of ten degrees in the\r\nlatitude of the places compared on opposite sides of the Atlantic.[224-A]\r\n\r\nFish of the genera _Lamna_, _Galeus_, and _Carcharias_ are common to New\r\nJersey and the European cretaceous rocks. So also is the genus _Mosasaurus_\r\namong reptiles, and _Pliosaurus_ (Owen), another saurian likewise obtained\r\nfrom the English chalk. From New Jersey the cretaceous formation extends\r\nsouthwards to North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, cropping out at\r\nintervals from beneath the tertiary strata, between the Appalachian\r\nMountains and the Atlantic. They then sweep round the southern extremity of\r\nthat chain, and stretch northwards again to Tennessee and Kentucky. They\r\nhave also been traced far up the valley of the Missouri 275 English miles\r\nabove its mouth, to the neighbourhood of Fort Leavenworth; and southwards\r\nto Texas, according to the observations of Ferdinand Roemer; so that already\r\nthe area which they are ascertained to occupy in North America may perhaps\r\nequal their extent in Europe. So little do they resemble mineralogically\r\nthe European white chalk, that limestone in North America is, upon the\r\nwhole, an exception to the rule; and, even in Alabama, where I saw a\r\ncalcareous member of this group, the marlstones are much more like the\r\nEnglish and French Lias than any other secondary deposit of the Old World.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the system in Alabama I found dense masses of shingle,\r\nperfectly loose and unconsolidated, derived from the waste of paleozoic\r\n(or carboniferous) rocks, a mass in no way distinguishable, except\r\nby its position, from ordinary alluvium, but covered with marls\r\nabounding in Inocerami.\r\n\r\nIn Texas, according to F. Roemer, the chalk assumes a new lithological type,\r\na large portion of it consisting of hard siliceous limestone, but the\r\norganic remains leaving no doubt in regard to its age.\r\n\r\nIn South America the cretaceous strata have been discovered in Columbia, as\r\nat Bogota and elsewhere, containing Ammonites, Hamites, Inocerami, and\r\nother characteristic shells.[225-A]\r\n\r\nIn the South of India, also, at Pondicherry, Verdachellum, and\r\nTrinconopoly, Messrs. Kaye and Egerton have collected fossils belonging to\r\nthe cretaceous system. Taken in connection with those from the United\r\nStates they prove, says Prof. E. Forbes, that those powerful causes which\r\nstamped a peculiar character on the forms of marine animal life at this\r\nperiod, exerted their full intensity through the Indian, European, and\r\nAmerican seas.[225-B] Here, as in North and South America, the cretaceous\r\ncharacter can be recognized even where there is no specific identity in the\r\nfossils; and the same may be said of the organic type of those rocks in\r\nEurope and India which succeed next in the ascending and descending order,\r\nthe Eocene and the Oolitic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[209-A] M. Alcide d'Orbigny, in his valuable work entitled Paleontologie\r\nFrancaise, has adopted new terms for the French subdivisions of the\r\nCretaceous Series, which, so far as they can be made to tally with English\r\nequivalents, seem explicable thus:\r\n\r\n  Danien.

Map, p. 242.), which,\r\nalthough it occupies a small horizontal area in Europe, as compared to the\r\nchalk, is nevertheless of great geological interest, not only from its\r\nposition, as being interpolated between two great marine formations (Nos.\r\n7. and 9. Table, p. 103.), but also because the imbedded fossils indicate a\r\ngrand succession of changes in organic life, effected during its\r\naccumulation. It is composed of three minor divisions, the Weald Clay, the\r\nHastings, and the Purbeck Beds, of which the aggregate thickness in some\r\ndistricts may be 700 or 800 feet; but which would be much more considerable\r\n(perhaps 2000 feet), were we to add together the extreme thickness acquired\r\nby each of them in their fullest development.\r\n\r\nThe common name of Wealden was given to the whole, because it was first\r\nstudied in parts of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, called the Weald, (see Map,\r\np. 242.), and we are indebted to Dr. Mantell for having shown in 1822, in\r\nhis Geology of Sussex, that the whole group was of fluviatile origin. In\r\nproof of this he called attention to the entire absence of Ammonites,\r\nBelemnites, Terebratulae, Echinites, Corals, and other marine fossils, so\r\ncharacteristic of the cretaceous rocks above, and of the Oolitic strata\r\nbelow, and to the presence of Paludinae, Melaniae, and various fluviatile\r\nshells, as well as the bones of terrestrial reptiles and the trunks and\r\nleaves of land plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227. Position of the Wealden between two\r\nmarine formations.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence of so unexpected a fact as the infra-position of a dense mass\r\nof purely freshwater origin to a deep-sea deposit (a phenomenon with which\r\nwe have since become familiar, in other chapters of the earth's\r\nautobiography), was received, at first, with no small doubt and\r\nincredulity. But the relative position of the beds is unequivocal; the\r\nWeald Clay being distinctly seen to pass beneath the Greensand in various\r\nparts of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex; and if we proceed from Sussex westward\r\nto the Vale of Wardour, we there again observe the same formation, or, at\r\nleast, the lower division of it, the Purbeck, occupying the same relative\r\nposition, and resting on the Oolite (see fig. 228.). Or if we pass from the\r\nbase of the South Downs in Sussex, and cross to the Isle of Wight, we there\r\nagain meet with the Wealden series reappearing beneath the Greensand, and\r\ncannot doubt that the beds are prolonged subterraneously, as indicated by\r\nthe dotted lines in fig. 229.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228. Cross section.\r\n\r\n  O, Oolite.\r\n  G S, Greensand, or Lower Cretaceous.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 229. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nThe minor groups into which the Wealden has been commonly divided in\r\nEngland are, as before stated, three, and they succeed each other in the\r\nfollowing descending order[227-A]:--\r\n\r\n                                                            Thickness.\r\n  1st. Weald Clay, sometimes including thin beds of\r\n       sand and shelly limestone                            140 to 280 ft.\r\n  2d.  Hastings Sand, in which occur some clays and\r\n       calcareous grits                                     400 to 500 ft.\r\n  3d.  Purbeck Beds, consisting of various kinds of\r\n       limestones and marls                                 150 to 200 ft.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weald Clay._\r\n\r\nThe first division, or Weald Clay, is of purely freshwater origin. The\r\nuppermost beds are not only conformable, as Dr. Fitton observes, to the\r\ninferior strata of the Lower Greensand, but of similar mineral composition.\r\nTo explain this, we may suppose, that as the delta of a great river was\r\ntranquilly subsiding, so as to allow the sea to encroach upon the space\r\npreviously occupied by freshwater, the river still continued to carry down\r\nthe same sediment into the sea. In confirmation of this view it may be\r\nstated, that the remains of the _Iguanodon Mantelli_, a gigantic\r\nterrestrial reptile, very characteristic of the Wealden, has been\r\ndiscovered near Maidstone, in the overlying Kentish rag, or marine\r\nlimestone of the Lower Greensand. Hence we may infer that some of the\r\nsaurians which inhabited the country of the great river continued to live\r\nwhen part of the country had become submerged beneath the sea. Thus, in our\r\nown times, we may suppose the bones of large alligators to be frequently\r\nentombed in recent freshwater strata in the delta of the Ganges. But if\r\npart of that delta should sink down so as to be covered by the sea, marine\r\nformations might begin to accumulate in the same space where freshwater\r\nbeds had previously been formed; and yet the Ganges might still pour down\r\nits turbid waters in the same direction, and carry seaward the carcasses of\r\nthe same species of alligator, in which case their bones might be included\r\nin marine as well as in subjacent freshwater strata.\r\n\r\nThe Iguanodon, first discovered by Dr. Mantell, has left more of its\r\nremains in the Wealden strata of the south-eastern counties, and Isle of\r\nWight, than any other genus of associated saurians. It was an\r\nherbivorous reptile, and regarded by Cuvier as more extraordinary than\r\nany with which he was acquainted; for the teeth, though bearing a great\r\nanalogy to the modern Iguanas which now frequent the tropical woods of\r\nAmerica and the West Indies, exhibit many striking and important\r\ndifferences (see fig. 230.). It appears that they have been worn by\r\nmastication; whereas the existing herbivorous reptiles clip and gnaw off\r\nthe vegetable productions on which they feed, but do not chew them.\r\nTheir teeth, when worn, present an appearance of having been chipped\r\noff, and never, like the fossil teeth of the Iguanodon, have a flat\r\nground surface (see fig. 231.), resembling the grinders of herbivorous\r\nmammalia. Dr. Mantell computes that the teeth and bones of this animal\r\nwhich have passed under his examination during the last twenty years,\r\nmust have belonged to no less than seventy-one distinct individuals;\r\nvarying in age and magnitude from the reptile just burst from the egg,\r\nto one of which the femur measured 24 inches in circumference. Yet\r\nnotwithstanding that the teeth were more numerous than any other bones,\r\nit is remarkable that it was not till the relics of all these\r\nindividuals had been found, that a solitary example of part of a\r\njaw-bone was obtained. More recently remains both of the upper and lower\r\njaw have been met with in the Hastings Beds in Tilgate Forest. Their\r\nsize was somewhat greater than had been anticipated, and even allowing\r\nthat the tail was short, which Professor Owen infers from the short\r\nbodies of the caudal vertebrae, Dr. Mantell estimates the probable length\r\nof some of these saurians at between 30 and 40 feet. The largest femur\r\nyet found measures 4 feet 8 inches in length, the circumference of the\r\nshaft being 25 inches, and round the condyles 42 inches.\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Teeth of Iguanodon.\r\n\r\nFig. 230. Partially worn tooth of a young animal. (Mantell.)\r\n\r\nFig. 231. Crown of tooth in adult, worn down. (Mantell.)]\r\n\r\nOccasionally bands of limestone, called Sussex Marble, occur in the Weald\r\nClay, almost entirely composed of a species of _Paludina_, closely\r\nresembling the common _P. vivipara_ of English rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232. _Cypris spinigera_, Fitton.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233. _Cypris Valdensis_, Fitton. (_C. faba_,\r\nMin. Con. 485.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234. _Cypris tuberculata_, Fitton.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235. Sample with lamination.]\r\n\r\nShells of the _Cypris_, an animal belonging to the Crustacea, and before\r\nmentioned (p. 31.) as abounding in lakes and ponds, are also plentifully\r\nscattered through the clays of the Wealden, sometimes producing, like\r\nthe plates of mica, a thin lamination (see fig. 235.). Similar\r\ncypriferous marls are found in the lacustrine tertiary beds of\r\nAuvergne (see above, p. 183.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hastings Sands._\r\n\r\nThis middle division of the Wealden consists of sand, calciferous grit,\r\nclay, and shale; the argillaceous strata, notwithstanding the name,\r\nbeing nearly in the same proportion as the arenaceous. The calcareous\r\nsandstone and grit of Tilgate Forest, near Cuckfield, in which the\r\nremains of the Iguanodon and Hyleosaurus were first found, constitute an\r\nupper member of this formation. The white \"sand-rock\" of the Hastings\r\ncliffs, about 100 feet thick, is one of the lower members of the same.\r\nThe reptiles, which are very abundant in it, consist partly of saurians,\r\nalready referred by Owen and Mantell to eight genera, among which,\r\nbesides those already enumerated, we find the Megalosaurus and\r\nPlesiosaurus. The Pterodactyl, also a flying reptile, is met with in the\r\nsame strata, and many remains of Testudinata of the genera _Trionyx_ and\r\n_Emys_, now confined to tropical regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236. _Lepidotus Mantelli_, Agass. Wealden.\r\n\r\n  _a._ palate and teeth.\r\n  _b._ side view of teeth.\r\n  _c._ scale.]\r\n\r\nThe fishes of the Wealden belong partly to the genera _Pycnodus_ and\r\n_Hybodus_ (see figure of genus in Chap. XXI.), forms common to the Wealden\r\nand Oolite; but the teeth and scales of a species of _Lepidotus_ are most\r\nwidely diffused (see fig. 236.). The general form of these fish was that of\r\nthe carp tribe, although perfectly distinct in anatomical character, and\r\nmore allied to the pike. The whole body was covered with large rhomboidal\r\nscales, very thick, and having the exposed part covered with enamel. Most\r\nof the species of this genus are supposed to have been either river fish,\r\nor inhabitants of the coasts, having not sufficient powers of swimming to\r\nadvance into the deep sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237. _Corbula alata_, Fitton. Magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe shells of the Hastings beds belong to the genera _Melanopsis_,\r\n_Melania_, _Paludina_, _Cyrena_, _Cyclas_, _Unio_, and others, which\r\ninhabit rivers or lakes; but one band has been found in Dorsetshire\r\nindicating a brackish state of the water, and, in some places, even a\r\nsaltness, like that of the sea, where the genera _Corbula_ (see fig. 237.),\r\n_Mytilus_, and _Ostrea_ occur. At different heights in the Hastings Sand,\r\nin the middle of the Wealden, we find again and again slabs of sandstone\r\nwith a strong ripple-mark, and between these slabs beds of clay many yards\r\nthick. In some places, as at Stammerham, near Horsham, there are\r\nindications of this clay having been exposed so as to dry and crack before\r\nthe next layer was thrown down upon it. The open cracks in the clay have\r\nserved as moulds, of which casts have been taken in relief, and which are,\r\ntherefore, seen on the lower surface of the sandstone (see fig. 238.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 238. Underside of slab of sandstone about one yard in\r\ndiameter. Stammerham, Sussex.]\r\n\r\nNear the same place a reddish sandstone occurs in which are innumerable\r\ntraces of a fossil vegetable, apparently _Sphenopteris_, the stems and\r\nbranches of which are disposed as if the plants were standing erect on the\r\nspot where they originally grew, the sand having been gently deposited upon\r\nand around them; and similar appearances have been remarked in other places\r\nin this formation.[230-A] In the same division also of the Wealden, at\r\nCuckfield, is a bed of gravel or conglomerate, consisting of water-worn\r\npebbles of quartz and jasper, with rolled bones of reptiles. These must\r\nhave been drifted by a current, probably in water of no great depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239. _Sphenopteris gracilis_ (Fitton), from\r\nnear Tunbridge Wells.\r\n\r\n_a._ portion of the same magnified.]\r\n\r\nFrom such facts we may infer that, notwithstanding the great thickness of\r\nthis division of the Wealden (and the same observation applies to the Weald\r\nClay and Purbeck Beds), the whole of it was a deposit in water of a\r\nmoderate depth, and often extremely shallow. This idea may seem startling\r\nat first, yet such would be the natural consequence of a gradual and\r\ncontinuous sinking of the ground in an estuary or bay, into which a great\r\nriver discharged its turbid waters. By each foot of subsidence, the\r\nfundamental rock, such as the Portland Oolite, would be depressed one foot\r\nfarther from the surface; but the bay would not be deepened, if newly\r\ndeposited mud and sand should raise the bottom one foot. On the contrary,\r\nsuch new strata of sand and mud might be frequently laid dry at low water,\r\nor overgrown for a season by a vegetation proper to marshes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Purbeck Beds._\r\n\r\nImmediately below the Hastings Sands we find a series of calcareous\r\nslates, marls, and limestones, called the Purbeck Beds, because well\r\nexposed to view in the sea-cliffs of the Peninsula of Purbeck,\r\nespecially in Durlestone Bay, near Swanage. They may also be\r\nadvantageously studied at Lulworth Cove and the neighbouring bays\r\nbetween Weymouth and Dorchester. At Meup's Bay in particular, Prof. E.\r\nForbes has recently examined minutely the organic remains of the three\r\nmembers of the Purbeck group, displayed there in a vertical section 155\r\nfeet thick. To the information previously supplied in the works of\r\nMessrs. Webster, Fitton, De la Beche, Buckland, and Mantell, he has made\r\nmost ample and important additions, so that it will be desirable to give\r\nthem at some length, it appearing that the Upper, Middle, and Lower\r\nPurbecks are each marked by peculiar species of organic remains, these\r\nagain being different, so far as a comparison has yet been instituted,\r\nfrom the fossils of the overlying Hastings Sands and Weald Clay. This\r\nresult cannot fail to excite much wonder, and it leads us to suspect\r\nthat the Wealden period, which many geologists have scarcely deigned\r\nto notice in their classification, may comprehend the history of a\r\nlapse of time as great as that of the Oolitic or Cretaceous\r\neras respectively.[231-A]\r\n\r\n_Upper Purbeck._--The highest of the three divisions is purely freshwater,\r\nthe strata, about 50 feet in thickness, containing shells of the genera\r\n_Paludina_, _Physa_, _Lymnea_, _Planorbis_, _Valvata_, _Cyclas_, and\r\n_Unio_, with cyprides, and fish.\r\n\r\n_Middle Purbeck._--To these succeed the Middle Purbeck, about 30 feet\r\nthick, the uppermost part of which consists of freshwater limestone, with\r\ncyprides, turtles, and fish of different species from those in the\r\npreceding strata. Below the limestone are brackish-water beds full of\r\n_Cyrena_, and traversed by bands abounding in _Corvulae_ and _Melaniae_.\r\nThese are based on a purely marine deposit, with _Pecten_, _Modiola_,\r\n_Avicula_, and _Thracia_, all undescribed shells. Below this, again, come\r\nlimestones and shales, partly of brackish and partly of freshwater origin,\r\nin which many fish, especially species of _Lepidotus_ and _Microdon\r\nradiatus_, are found, and a reptile named _Macrorhyncus_. Among the\r\nmollusks, a remarkable ribbed _Melania_, of the section _Chilira_, occurs.\r\n\r\nImmediately below is the great and conspicuous stratum, 12 feet thick, long\r\nfamiliar to geologists under the local name of \"Cinder-bed,\" formed of a\r\nvast accumulation of shells of _Ostrea distorta_ (fig. 240.). In the\r\nuppermost part of this bed Mr. Forbes discovered the first echinoderm as\r\nyet known in the Purbeck series, a species of _Hemicidaris_, a genus\r\ncharacteristic of the Oolitic period. It was accompanied by a species of\r\n_Perna_. Below the Cinder-bed freshwater strata are again seen, filled in\r\nmany places with species of _Cypris_, _Valvata_, _Paludina_, _Planorbis_,\r\n_Lymnea_, _Physa_, and _Cyclas_, all different from any we had previously\r\nseen above. Thick siliceous beds of chert, filled with these fossils, occur\r\nin a beautiful state of preservation, often converted into chalcedony.\r\nAmong these Mr. Forbes met with gyrogonites (the spore vesicles of\r\n_Charae_), plants never before discovered in rocks older than the Eocene.\r\nAgain, beneath these freshwater strata, a very thin band of greenish\r\nshales, with marine shells and impressions of leaves, like those of a large\r\n_Zostera_, succeeds, forming the base of the Middle Purbeck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240. Ostrea distorta. Cinder-bed.]\r\n\r\n_Lower Purbeck._--Beneath the thin marine band last mentioned, purely\r\nfreshwater marls occur, containing species of _Cypris_, _Valvata_, and\r\n_Lymnea_, different from those of the Middle Purbeck. This is the beginning\r\nof the Inferior division, which is about 80 feet thick. Below the marls are\r\nseen more than 30 feet of brackish-water beds, at Meup's Bay, abounding in\r\na species of _Serpula_, allied to, if not identical with, _Serpula\r\ncoacervites_, found in the Wealden of Hanover. There are also shells of the\r\ngenus _Rissoa_ (of the subgenus _Hydrobia_), and a little _Cardium_ of the\r\nsubgenus _Protocardium_, in the same beds, together with _Cypris_. Some of\r\nthe cypris-bearing shales are strangely contorted and broken up, at the\r\nwest end of the Isle of Purbeck. The great dirt-bed or vegetable soil\r\ncontaining the roots and stools of _Cycadeae_, which I shall presently\r\ndescribe, underlies these marls, resting upon the lowest freshwater\r\nlimestone, a rock about 8 feet thick, containing _Cyclades_, _Valvata_, and\r\n_Lymnea_, of the same species as those of the uppermost part of the Lower\r\nPurbeck. This rock rests upon the top beds of the Portland stone, which is\r\npurely marine, and between which and the Purbecks there is no passage.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of all the varied successions of beds enumerated in the\r\nabove list, is that called by the quarrymen \"the dirt,\" or \"black dirt,\"\r\nwhich was evidently an ancient vegetable soil. It is from 12 to 18 inches\r\nthick, is of a dark brown or black colour, and contains a large proportion\r\nof earthy lignite. Through it are dispersed rounded fragments of stone,\r\nfrom 3 to 9 inches in diameter, in such numbers that it almost deserves the\r\nname of gravel. Many silicified trunks of coniferous trees, and the remains\r\nof plants allied to _Zamia_ and _Cycas_, are buried in this dirt-bed (see\r\nfigure of living _Zamia_, fig. 241.).\r\n\r\nThese plants must have become fossil on the spots where they grew. The\r\nstumps of the trees stand erect for a height of from 1 to 3 feet, and even\r\nin one instance to 6 feet, with their roots attached to the soil at about\r\nthe same distances from one another as the trees in a modern\r\nforest.[233-A] The carbonaceous matter is most abundant immediately around\r\nthe stumps, and round the remains of fossil _Cycadeae_.[233-B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241. Zamia spiralis; Southern Australia.[233-C]]\r\n\r\nBesides the upright stumps above mentioned, the dirt-bed contains the stems\r\nof silicified trees laid prostrate. These are partly sunk into the black\r\nearth, and partly enveloped by a calcareous slate which covers the\r\ndirt-bed. The fragments of the prostrate trees are rarely more than 3 or 4\r\nfeet in length; but by joining many of them together, trunks have been\r\nrestored, having a length from the root to the branches of from 20 to 23\r\nfeet, the stems being undivided for 17 or 20 feet, and then forked. The\r\ndiameter of these near the roots is about 1 foot.[233-D] Root-shaped\r\ncavities were observed by Professor Henslow to descend from the bottom of\r\nthe dirt-bed into the subjacent freshwater stone, which, though now solid,\r\nmust have been in a soft and penetrable state when the trees grew.[233-E]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242. Section in Isle of Portland, Dorset.\r\n(Buckland and De la Beche.)]\r\n\r\nThe thin layers of calcareous slate (fig. 242.) were evidently deposited\r\ntranquilly, and would have been horizontal but for the protrusion of the\r\nstumps of the trees, around the top of each of which they form\r\nhemispherical concretions.\r\n\r\nThe dirt-bed is by no means confined to the island of Portland, where it\r\nhas been most carefully studied, but is seen in the same relative position\r\nin the cliffs east of Lulworth Cove, in Dorsetshire, where, as the strata\r\nhave been disturbed, and are now inclined at an angle of 45 deg., the stumps of\r\nthe trees are also inclined at the same angle in an opposite direction--a\r\nbeautiful illustration of a change in the position of beds originally\r\nhorizontal (see fig. 243.). Traces of the dirt-bed have also been observed\r\nby Dr. Buckland, about two miles north of Thame, in Oxfordshire; and by Dr.\r\nFitton, in the cliffs of the Boulonnois, on the French coast; but, as might\r\nbe expected, this freshwater deposit is of limited extent when compared to\r\nmost marine formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243. Section in cliff east of Lulworth Cove.\r\n(Buckland and De la Beche.)]\r\n\r\nFrom the facts above described, we may infer, first, that the superior\r\nbeds of the Oolite, called \"the Portland,\" which are full of marine\r\nshells, were overspread with fluviatile mud, which became dry land, and\r\ncovered by a forest, throughout a portion of the space now occupied by\r\nthe south of England, the climate being such as to admit the growth of\r\nthe _Zamia_ and _Cycas_. 2dly. This land at length sank down and was\r\nsubmerged with its forests beneath a body of fresh water, from which\r\nsediment was thrown down enveloping fluviatile shells. 3dly. The regular\r\nand uniform preservation of this thin bed of black earth over a distance\r\nof many miles, shows that the change from dry land to the state of a\r\nfreshwater lake or estuary, was not accompanied by any violent\r\ndenudation, or rush of water, since the loose black earth, together with\r\nthe trees which lay prostrate on its surface, must inevitably have been\r\nswept away had any such violent catastrophe then taken place.\r\n\r\nThe dirt-bed has been described above in its most simple form, but in some\r\nsections the appearances are more complicated. The forest of the dirt-bed\r\nwas not everywhere the first vegetation which grew in this region. Two\r\nother beds of carbonaceous clay, one of them containing _Cycadeae_, in an\r\nupright position, have been found below it, and one above it[234-A], which\r\nimplies other oscillations in the level of the same ground, and its\r\nalternate occupation by land and water more than once.\r\n\r\n_Table showing the changes of medium in which the strata were formed,\r\nfrom the Lower Greensand to the Portland Stone inclusive, in the\r\nsouth-east of England._\r\n\r\n  1.

That there have been at least\r\nfour changes in the species of testacea during the deposition of the\r\nWealden, seems to follow from the observations recently made by Professor\r\nE. Forbes, so that, should we hereafter find the signs of many more\r\nalternate occupations of the same area by different elements, it is no more\r\nthan we might expect. Even during a small part of a zoological period, not\r\nsufficient to allow time for many species to die out, we find that the same\r\narea has been laid dry, and then submerged, and then again laid dry, as in\r\nthe deltas of the Po and Ganges, the history of which has been brought to\r\nlight by Artesian borings.[235-A] We also know that similar revolutions\r\nhave occurred within the present century (1819) in the delta of the Indus\r\nin Cutch[235-B], where land has been laid permanently under the waters both\r\nof the river and sea, without its soil or shrubs having been swept away.\r\nEven, independently of any vertical movements of the ground, we see in the\r\nprincipal deltas, such as that of the Mississippi, that the sea extends its\r\nsalt waters annually for many months over considerable spaces, which, at\r\nother seasons, are occupied by the river during its inundations.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the division of the Purbecks into upper, middle,\r\nand lower, has been made by Professor E. Forbes, strictly on the principle\r\nof the entire distinctness of the species of organic remains which they\r\ninclude. The lines of demarcation are not lines of disturbance, nor\r\nindicated by any striking physical characters or mineral changes. The\r\nfeatures which attract the eye in the Purbecks, such as the dirt-beds, the\r\ndislocated strata at Lulworth, and the Cinder-bed, do not indicate any\r\nbreaks in the distribution of organized beings. \"The causes which led to a\r\ncomplete change of life three times during the deposition of the freshwater\r\nand brackish strata must,\" says this naturalist, \"be sought for, not simply\r\nin either a rapid or a sudden change of their area into land or sea, but\r\nin the great lapse of time which intervened between the epochs of\r\ndeposition at certain periods during their formation.\"\r\n\r\nEach dirt-bed may, no doubt, be the memorial of many thousand years or\r\ncenturies, because we find that 2 or 3 feet of vegetable soil is the only\r\nmonument which many a tropical forest has left of its existence ever since\r\nthe ground on which it now stands was first covered with its shade. Yet,\r\neven if we imagined the fossil soils of the Lower Purbeck to represent as\r\nmany ages, we need not expect on that account to find them constituting the\r\nlines of separation between successive strata characterized by different\r\nzoological types. The preservation of a layer of vegetable soil, when in\r\nthe act of being submerged, must be regarded as a rare exception to a\r\ngeneral rule. It is of so perishable a nature, that it must usually be\r\ncarried away by the denuding waves or currents of the sea or by a river;\r\nand many dirt-beds were probably formed in succession, and annihilated in\r\nthe Wealden, besides those few which now remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244. Cone from the Isle of Purbeck, resembling the\r\n_Dammara_ of the Moluccas. (Fitton.)]\r\n\r\nThe plants of the Wealden, so far as our knowledge extends at present,\r\nconsist chiefly of Ferns, Coniferae (see fig. 244.), and Cycadeae, without\r\nany exogens; the whole more allied to the Oolitic than to the Cretaceous\r\nvegetation, although some of the species seem to be common to the chalk.\r\nBut the vertebrate and invertebrate animals indicate, in like manner, a\r\nrelationship to both these periods, though a nearer affinity to the\r\nOolitic. Mr. Brodie has found the remains of beetles and several insects of\r\nthe homopterous and trichopterous orders, some of which now live on plants,\r\nlike those of the Wealden, while others hover over the surface of our\r\npresent rivers. But no bones of mammalia have been met with among those of\r\nland-reptiles. Yet, as the reader will learn, in Chapter XX., that the\r\nrelics of marsupial quadrupeds have been detected in still older beds, and,\r\nas it was so long before a single portion of the jaw of an iguanodon was\r\nmet with in the Tilgate quarries (see p. 228.), we need by no means despair\r\nof discovering hereafter some evidence of the existence of warm-blooded\r\nquadrupeds at this era. It is, at least, too soon to infer, on mere\r\nnegative evidence, that the mammalia were foreign to this fauna.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the geographical extent of the Wealden, it cannot be\r\naccurately laid down; because so much of it is concealed beneath the newer\r\nmarine formations. It has been traced about 200 English miles from west to\r\neast, from Lulworth Cove to near Boulogne, in France; and about 220 miles\r\nfrom north-west to south-east, from Whitchurch, in Buckinghamshire, to\r\nBeauvais, in France. If the formation be continuous throughout this space,\r\nwhich is very doubtful, it does not follow that the whole was\r\ncontemporaneous; because, in all likelihood, the physical geography of the\r\nregion underwent frequent change throughout the whole period, and the\r\nestuary may have altered its form, and even shifted its place. Dr. Dunker,\r\nof Cassel, and H. Von Meyer, in an excellent monograph on the Wealdens of\r\nHanover and Westphalia, have shown that they correspond so closely, not\r\nonly in their fossils, but also in their mineral characters, with the\r\nEnglish series, that we can scarcely hesitate to refer the whole to one\r\ngreat delta. Even then, the magnitude of the deposit may not exceed that of\r\nmany modern rivers. Thus, the delta of the Quorra or Niger, in Africa,\r\nstretches into the interior for more than 170 miles, and occupies, it is\r\nsupposed, a space of more than 300 miles along the coast, thus forming a\r\nsurface of more than 25,000 square miles, or equal to about one half of\r\nEngland.[237-A] Besides, we know not, in such cases, how far the fluviatile\r\nsediment and organic remains of the river and the land may be carried out\r\nfrom the coast, and spread over the bed of the sea. I have shown, when\r\ntreating of the Mississippi, that a more ancient delta, including species\r\nof shells, such as now inhabit Louisiana, has been upraised, and made to\r\noccupy a wide geographical area, while a newer delta is forming[237-B]; and\r\nthe possibility of such movements, and their effects, must not be lost\r\nsight of when we speculate on the origin of the Wealden.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked where the continent was placed from the ruins of which\r\nthe Wealden strata were derived, and by the drainage of which a great\r\nriver was fed, we are half tempted to speculate on the former existence\r\nof the Atlantis of Plato. The story of the submergence of an ancient\r\ncontinent, however fabulous in history, must have been true again and\r\nagain as a geological event.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty consists in the persistence of a large hydrographical\r\nbasin, from whence a great body of fresh water was poured into the sea,\r\nprecisely at a period when the neighbouring area of the Wealden was\r\ngradually going downwards 1000 feet or more perpendicularly. If the\r\nadjoining land participated in the movement, how could it escape being\r\nsubmerged, or how could it retain its size and altitude so as to continue\r\nto be the source of such an inexhaustible supply of fresh water and\r\nsediment? In answer to this question, we are fairly entitled to suggest\r\nthat the neighbouring land may have been stationary, or may even have\r\nundergone a contemporaneous slow upheaval. There may have been an ascending\r\nmovement in one region, and a descending one in a contiguous parallel zone\r\nof country; just as the northern part of Scandinavia is now rising, while\r\nthe middle portion (that south of Stockholm) is unmoved, and the southern\r\nextremity in Scania is sinking, or at least has sunk within the historical\r\nperiod.[237-C] We must, nevertheless, conclude, if we adopt the above\r\nhypothesis, that the depression of the land became general throughout a\r\nlarge part of Europe at the close of the Wealden period, a subsidence which\r\nbrought in the cretaceous ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[227-A] Dr. Fitton, Geol.

Some account has already been given on the first head of the\r\nTertiary, the Cretaceous, and Wealden strata; and we may now proceed to\r\nconsider certain features in the physical geography of these groups as they\r\noccur in parts of England and France.\r\n\r\nThe hills composed of white chalk in the S.E. of England have a smooth\r\nrounded outline, and being usually in the state of sheep pastures, are free\r\nfrom trees or hedgerows; so that we have an opportunity of observing how\r\nthe valleys by which they are drained ramify in all directions, and become\r\nwider and deeper as they descend. Although these valleys are now for the\r\nmost part dry, except during heavy rains and the melting of snow, they may\r\nhave been due to aqueous denudation, as explained in the sixth chapter;\r\nhaving been excavated when the chalk emerged gradually from the sea. This\r\nopinion is confirmed by the occasional occurrence of long lines of inland\r\ncliffs, in which the strata are cut off abruptly in steep and often\r\nvertical precipices. The true nature of such escarpments is nowhere more\r\nobvious than in parts of Normandy, where the river Seine and its\r\ntributaries flow through deep winding valleys, hollowed out of chalk\r\nhorizontally stratified. Thus, for example, if we follow the Seine for a\r\ndistance of about 30 miles from Andelys to Elboeuf, we find the valley\r\nflanked on both sides by a deep slope of chalk, with numerous beds of\r\nflint, the formation being laid open for a thickness of about 250 and 300\r\nfeet. Above the chalk is an overlying mass of sand, gravel, and clay, from\r\n30 to 100 feet thick. The two opposite slopes of the hills _a_ and _b_,\r\nwhere the chalk appears at the surface, are from 2 to 4 miles apart, and\r\nthey are often perfectly smooth and even, like the steepest of our downs in\r\nEngland; but at many points they are broken by one, two, or more ranges of\r\nvertical and even overhanging cliffs of bare white chalk with flints. At\r\nsome points detached needles and pinnacles stand in the line of the cliffs,\r\nor in front of them, as at _c_, fig. 245. On the right bank of the Seine,\r\nat Andelys, one range, about 2 miles long, is seen varying from 50 to 100\r\nfeet in perpendicular height, and having its continuity broken by a number\r\nof dry valleys or coombs, in one of which occurs a detached rock or needle,\r\ncalled the Tete d'Homme (see figs. 246, 247.). The top of this rock\r\npresents a precipitous face towards every point of the compass; its\r\nvertical height being more than 20 feet on the side of the downs, and 40\r\ntowards the Seine, the average diameter of the pillar being 36 feet. Its\r\ncomposition is the same as that of the larger cliffs in its neighbourhood,\r\nnamely, white chalk, having occasionally a crystalline texture like marble,\r\nwith layers of flint in nodules and tabular masses. The flinty beds often\r\nproject in relief 4 or 5 feet beyond the white chalk, which is generally in\r\na state of slow decomposition, either exfoliating or being covered with\r\nwhite powder, like the chalk cliffs on the English coast; and, as in them,\r\nthis superficial powder contains in some places common salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245. Section across Valley of Seine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246. View of the Tete d'Homme, Andelys,\r\nseen from above.]\r\n\r\nOther cliffs are situated on the right bank of the Seine, opposite\r\nTournedos, between Andelys and Pont de l'Arche, where the precipices are\r\nfrom 50 to 80 feet high: several of their summits terminate in pinnacles;\r\nand one of them, in particular, is so completely detached as to present a\r\nperpendicular face 50 feet high towards the sloping down. On these cliffs\r\nseveral ledges are seen, which mark so many levels at which the waves of\r\nthe sea may be supposed to have encroached for a long period. At a still\r\ngreater height, immediately above the top of this range, are three much\r\nsmaller cliffs, each about 4 feet high, with as many intervening terraces,\r\nwhich are continued so as to sweep in a semicircular form round an\r\nadjoining coomb, like those in Sicily before described (p. 76.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247. Side view of the Tete d'Homme.\r\nWhite chalk with flints.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248. Chalk pinnacle at Senneville.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249. Roches d'Orival, Elboeuf.]\r\n\r\nIf we then descend the river from Vatteville to a place called Senneville,\r\nwe meet with a singular needle about 50 feet high, perfectly isolated on\r\nthe escarpment of chalk on the right bank of the Seine (see fig. 248.).\r\nAnother conspicuous range of inland cliffs is situated about 12 miles below\r\non the left bank of the Seine, beginning at Elboeuf, and comprehending the\r\nRoches d'Orival (see fig. 249.). Like those before described, it has an\r\nirregular surface, often overhanging, and with beds of flint projecting\r\nseveral feet. Like them, also, it exhibits a white powdery surface, and\r\nconsists entirely of horizontal chalk with flints. It is 40 miles inland,\r\nits height, in some parts, exceeding 200 feet, and its base only a few feet\r\nabove the level of the Seine. It is broken, in one place, by a pyramidal\r\nmass or needle, 200 feet high, called the Roche de Pignon, which stands out\r\nabout 25 feet in front of the upper portion of the main cliffs, with which\r\nit is united by a narrow ridge about 40 feet lower than its summit (see\r\nfig. 250.). Like the detached rocks before mentioned at Senneville,\r\nVatteville, and Andelys, it may be compared to those needles of chalk which\r\noccur on the coast of Normandy, as well as in the Isle of Wight and in\r\nPurbeck[241-A] (see fig. 251.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250. View of the Roche de Pignon, seen from the south.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251. Needle and Arch of Etretat, in the chalk cliffs of\r\nNormandy. Height of Arch 100 feet. (Passy.)[241-B]]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing description and drawings will show, that the evidence of\r\ncertain escarpments of the chalk having been originally sea-cliffs, is far\r\nmore full and satisfactory in France than in England. If it be asked why,\r\nin the interior of our own country, we meet with no ranges of precipices\r\nequally vertical and overhanging, and no isolated pillars or needles, we\r\nmay reply that the greater hardness of the chalk in Normandy may, no doubt,\r\nbe the chief cause of this difference. But the frequent absence of all\r\nsigns of littoral denudation in the valley of the Seine itself is a\r\nnegative fact of a far more striking and perplexing character. The cliffs,\r\nafter being almost continuous for miles, are then wholly wanting for much\r\ngreater distances, being replaced by a green sloping down, although the\r\nbeds remain of the same composition, and are equally horizontal; and\r\nalthough we may feel assured that the manner of the upheaval of the land,\r\nwhether intermittent or not, must have been the same at those intermediate\r\npoints where no cliffs exist, as at others where they are so fully\r\ndeveloped. But, in order to explain such apparent anomalies, the reader\r\nmust refer again to the theory of denudation, as expounded in the 6th\r\nchapter; where it was shown, first, that the undermining force of the waves\r\nand marine currents varies greatly at different parts of every coast;\r\nsecondly, that precipitous rocks have often decomposed and crumbled down;\r\nand thirdly, that many terraces and small cliffs may now lie concealed\r\nbeneath a talus of detrital matter.\r\n\r\n_Denudation of the Weald Valley._--No district is better fitted to\r\nillustrate the manner in which a great series of strata may have been\r\nupheaved and gradually denuded than the country intervening between the\r\nNorth and South Downs. This region, of which a ground plan is given in the\r\naccompanying map (fig. 252.), comprises within it the whole of Sussex, and\r\nparts of the counties of Kent, Surrey, and Hampshire. The space in which\r\nthe formations older than the White Chalk, or those from the Gault to the\r\nHastings sand inclusive, crop out, is bounded everywhere by a great\r\nescarpment of chalk, which is continued on the opposite side of the channel\r\nin the Bas Boulonnais in France, where it forms the semicircular boundary\r\nof a tract in which older strata also appear at the surface. The whole of\r\nthis district may therefore be considered geologically as one and the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 252.

Crowborough Hill, 804 feet.\r\n\r\nHighest point of North Downs, 880 feet.[243-A]\r\n\r\nSection of the country from the confines of the basin of London to\r\nthat of Hants, with the principal heights above the level of the sea\r\non a true scale.[243-B]]\r\n\r\nThe space here inclosed within the escarpment of the chalk affords an\r\nexample of what has been sometimes called a \"valley of elevation\" (more\r\nproperly \"of denudation\"); where the strata, partially removed by\r\naqueous excavation, dip away on all sides from a central axis. Thus, it\r\nis supposed that the area now occupied by the Hastings sand (No. 6.) was\r\nonce covered by the Weald clay (No. 5.), and this again by the Greensand\r\n(No. 4.), and this by the Gault (No. 3.); and, lastly, that the Chalk\r\n(No. 2.) extended originally over the whole space between the North and\r\nthe South Downs. This theory will be better understood by consulting the\r\nannexed diagram (fig. 253.), where the dark lines represent what now\r\nremains, and the fainter ones those portions of rock which are believed\r\nto have been carried away.\r\n\r\nAt each end of the diagram the tertiary strata (No. 1.) are exhibited\r\nreposing on the chalk. In the middle are seen the Hastings sands (No. 6.)\r\nforming an anticlinal axis, on each side of which the other formations are\r\narranged with an opposite dip. It has been necessary, however, in order to\r\ngive a clear view of the different formations, to exaggerate the\r\nproportional height of each in comparison to its horizontal extent; and a\r\ntrue scale is therefore subjoined in another diagram (fig. 254.), in order\r\nto correct the erroneous impression which might otherwise be made on the\r\nreader's mind. In this section the distance between the North and South\r\nDowns is represented to exceed forty miles; for the Valley of the Weald is\r\nhere intersected in its longest diameter, in the direction of a line\r\nbetween Lewes and Maidstone.\r\n\r\nThrough the central portion, then, of the district supposed to be denuded\r\nruns a great anticlinal line, having a direction nearly east and west, on\r\nboth sides of which the beds 5, 4, 3, and 2, crop out in succession. But,\r\nalthough, for the sake of rendering the physical structure of this region\r\nmore intelligible, the central line of elevation has alone been introduced,\r\nas in the diagrams of Smith, Mantell, Conybeare, and others, geologists\r\nhave always been well aware that numerous minor lines of dislocation and\r\nflexure run parallel to the great central axis.\r\n\r\nIn the central area of the Hastings sand the strata have undergone the\r\ngreatest displacement; one fault being known, where the vertical shift\r\nof a bed of calcareous grit is no less than 60 fathoms.[244-A] Much of\r\nthe picturesque scenery of this district arises from the depth of the\r\nnarrow valleys and ridges to which the sharp bends and fractures of\r\nthe strata have given rise; but it is also in part to be attributed\r\nto the excavating power exerted by water, especially on the\r\ninterstratified argillaceous beds.\r\n\r\nBesides the series of longitudinal valleys and ridges in the Weald, there\r\nare valleys which run in a transverse direction, passing through the chalk\r\nto the basin of the Thames on the one side, and to the English Channel on\r\nthe other. In this manner the chain of the North Downs is broken by the\r\nrivers Wey, Mole, Darent, Medway, and Stour; the South Downs by the Arun,\r\nAdur, Ouse, and Cuckmere.[244-B] If these transverse hollows could be\r\nfilled up, all the rivers, observes Mr. Conybeare, would be forced to take\r\nan easterly course, and to empty themselves into the sea by Romney Marsh\r\nand Pevensey Levels.[245-A]\r\n\r\nMr. Martin has suggested that the great cross fractures of the chalk, which\r\nhave become river channels, have a remarkable correspondence on each side\r\nof the valley of the Weald; in several instances the gorges in the North\r\nand South Downs appearing to be directly opposed to each other. Thus, for\r\nexample, the defiles of the Wey in the North Downs, and of the Arun in the\r\nSouth, seemed to coincide in direction; and, in like manner, the Ouse\r\ncorresponds to the Darent, and the Cuckmere to the Medway.[245-B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255. View of the chalk escarpment of the South Downs.\r\nTaken from the Devil's Dike, looking towards the west and south-west.\r\n\r\n  _a._ The town of Steyning is hidden by this point.\r\n  _b._ Edburton church.\r\n  _c._ Road.\r\n  _d._ River Adur.]\r\n\r\nAlthough these coincidences may, perhaps, be accidental, it is by no means\r\nimprobable, as hinted by the author above mentioned, that great amount of\r\nelevation towards the centre of the Weald district gave rise to transverse\r\nfissures. And as the longitudinal valleys were connected with that linear\r\nmovement which caused the anticlinal lines running east and west, so the\r\ncross fissures might have been occasioned by the intensity of the upheaving\r\nforce towards the centre of the line.\r\n\r\nBut before treating of the manner in which the upheaving movement may\r\nhave acted, I shall endeavour to make the reader more intimately\r\nacquainted with the leading geographical features of the district, so\r\nfar as they are of geological interest.\r\n\r\nIn whatever direction we travel from the tertiary strata of the basins of\r\nLondon and Hampshire towards the valley of the Weald, we first ascend a\r\nslope of white chalk, with flints, and then find ourselves on the summit of\r\na declivity consisting, for the most part, of different members of the\r\nchalk formation; below which the upper greensand, and sometimes, also, the\r\ngault, crop out. This steep declivity is the great escarpment of the chalk\r\nbefore mentioned, which overhangs a valley excavated chiefly out of the\r\nargillaceous or marly bed, termed Gault (No. 3.). The escarpment is\r\ncontinuous along the southern termination of the North Downs, and may be\r\ntraced from the sea, at Folkestone, westward to Guildford and the\r\nneighbourhood of Petersfield, and from thence to the termination of the\r\nSouth Downs at Beachy Head. In this precipice or steep slope the strata are\r\ncut off abruptly, and it is evident that they must originally have extended\r\nfarther. In the woodcut (fig. 255. p. 245.), part of the escarpment of the\r\nSouth Downs is faithfully represented, where the denudation at the base of\r\nthe declivity has been somewhat more extensive than usual, in consequence\r\nof the upper and lower greensand being formed of very incoherent materials,\r\nthe upper, indeed, being extremely thin and almost wanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 256. Chalk escarpment, as seen from the hill above\r\nSteyning, Sussex. The castle and village of Bramber in the foreground.]\r\n\r\nThe geologist cannot fail to recognize in this view the exact likeness of a\r\nsea cliff; and if he turns and looks in an opposite direction, or eastward,\r\ntowards Beachy Head (see fig. 256.), he will see the same line of heights\r\nprolonged. Even those who are not accustomed to speculate on the former\r\nchanges which the surface has undergone may fancy the broad and level plain\r\nto resemble the flat sands which were laid dry by the receding tide, and\r\nthe different projecting masses of chalk to be the headlands of a coast\r\nwhich separated the different bays from each other.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the transverse valleys before mentioned, as intersecting the\r\nchalk hills, some idea of them may be derived from the subjoined sketch\r\n(fig. 257.), of the gorge of the river Adur, taken from the summit of the\r\nchalk downs, at a point in the bridle-way leading from the towns of Bramber\r\nand Steyning to Shoreham. If the reader will refer again to the view given\r\nin a former woodcut (fig. 255. p. 245.), he will there see the exact point\r\nwhere the gorge of which I am now speaking interrupts the chalk escarpment.\r\nA projecting hill, at the point _a_, hides the town of Steyning, near which\r\nthe valley commences where the Adur passes directly to the sea at Old\r\nShoreham. The river flows through a nearly level plain, as do most of the\r\nothers which intersect the hills of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex; and it is\r\nevident that these openings, so far at least as they are due to aqueous\r\nerosion, have not been produced by the rivers, many of which, like the Ouse\r\nnear Lewes, have filled up arms of the sea, instead of deepening the\r\nhollows which they traverse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257. Transverse Valley of the Adur in the South Downs.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Town of Steyning.\r\n  _b._ River Adur.\r\n  _c._ Old Shoreham.]\r\n\r\nNow, in order to account for the manner in which the five groups of\r\nstrata, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, represented in the map, fig. 252. and in the\r\nsection fig. 253., may have been brought into their present position,\r\nthe following hypothesis has been very generally adopted:--Suppose the\r\nfive formations to lie in horizontal stratification at the bottom of the\r\nsea; then let a movement from below press them upwards into the form of\r\na flattened dome, and let the crown of this dome be afterwards cut off,\r\nso that the incision should penetrate to the lowest of the five groups.\r\nThe different beds would then be exposed on the surface, in the manner\r\nexhibited in the map, fig. 252.[247-A]\r\n\r\nThe quantity of denudation or removal by water of stratified masses assumed\r\nto have once reached continuously from the North to the South Downs is so\r\nenormous, that the reader may at first be startled by the boldness of the\r\nhypothesis. But the difficulty vanishes when once sufficient time is\r\nallowed for the gradual and successive rise of the strata, during which the\r\nwaves and currents of the ocean might slowly accomplish an operation, which\r\nno sudden diluvial rush of waters could possibly have effected.\r\n\r\nAmong other proofs of the action of water, it may be stated that the great\r\nlongitudinal valleys follow the outcrop of the softer and more incoherent\r\nbeds, while ridges or lines of cliff usually occur at those points where\r\nthe strata are composed of harder stone. Thus, for example, the chalk with\r\nflints, together with the subjacent upper greensand, which is often used\r\nfor building, under the provincial name of \"firestone,\" has been cut into a\r\nsteep cliff on that side on which the sea encroached. This escarpment\r\nbounds a deep valley, excavated chiefly out of the soft argillaceous or\r\nmarly bed, termed gault (No. 3.). In some places the upper greensand is in\r\na loose and incoherent state, and there it has been as much denuded as the\r\ngault; as, for example, near Beachy Head; but farther to the westward it is\r\nof great thickness, and contains hard beds of blue chert and calcareous\r\nsandstone or firestone. Here, accordingly, we find that it produces a\r\ncorresponding influence on the scenery of the country; for it runs out like\r\na step beyond the foot of the chalk-hills, and constitutes a lower terrace,\r\nvarying in breadth from a quarter of a mile to three miles, and following\r\nthe sinuosities of the chalk escarpment.[248-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258. Cross section.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Chalk with flints.\r\n  _b._ Chalk without flints.\r\n  _c._ Upper greensand, or firestone.\r\n  _d._ Gault.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to desire a more satisfactory proof that the escarpment\r\nis due to the excavating power of water during the rise of the strata;\r\nfor I have shown, in my account of the coast of Sicily, in what manner\r\nthe encroachments of the sea tend to efface that succession of terraces\r\nwhich must otherwise result from the intermittent upheaval of a coast\r\npreyed upon by the waves.[248-B] During the interval between two\r\nelevatory movements, the lower terrace will usually be destroyed,\r\nwherever it is composed of incoherent materials; whereas the sea will\r\nnot have time entirely to sweep away another part of the same terrace,\r\nor lower platform, which happens to be composed of rocks of a harder\r\ntexture, and capable of offering a firmer resistance to the erosive\r\naction of water. As the yielding clay termed gault would be readily\r\nwashed away, we find its outcrop marked everywhere by a valley which\r\nskirts the base of the chalk hills, and which is usually bounded on the\r\nopposite side by the lower greensand; but as the upper beds of this last\r\nformation are most commonly loose and incoherent, they also have usually\r\ndisappeared and increased the breadth of the valley. But in those\r\ndistricts where chert, limestone, and other solid materials enter\r\nlargely into the composition of this formation (No. 4.), they give rise\r\nto a range of hills parallel to the chalk, which sometimes rival the\r\nescarpment of the chalk itself in height, or even surpass it, as in\r\nLeith Hill, near Dorking. This ridge often presents a steep escarpment\r\ntowards the soft argillaceous deposit called the Weald clay (No. 5.;\r\nsee the strong lines in fig. 253. p. 243.), which usually forms a broad\r\nvalley, separating the lower greensand from the Hastings sands or Forest\r\nridge; but where subordinate beds of sandstone of a firmer texture\r\noccur, the uniformity of the plain of No. 5. is broken by waving\r\nirregularities and hillocks.\r\n\r\nIt will be easy to show how closely the superficial inequalities agree with\r\nthose which we might naturally expect to originate during the gradual rise\r\nof the Wealden district. Suppose the line of the most energetic movement to\r\nhave coincided with what is now the central ridge of the Weald valley; in\r\nthat case the first land which emerged must have been situated where the\r\nForest ridge is now placed. Here many shoals and reefs may first have\r\nexisted, and islands of chalk devoured in the course of ages by the ocean\r\n(see fig. 253.); so that the top of the shattered dome which first appeared\r\nabove water may have been utterly destroyed, and the masses represented by\r\nthe fainter lines (fig. 253.) removed.\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Fig. 259., Fig. 260.\r\n\r\nThe dotted lines represent the sea-level.]\r\n\r\nThe upper greensand is represented (fig. 259.) as forming on the left\r\nhand a single precipice with the chalk; while on the right there are two\r\ncliffs, with an intervening terrace, as before described in fig. 258.\r\nTwo strips of land would then remain on each side of a channel,\r\npresenting ranges of white cliffs facing each other. A powerful current\r\nmight then scoop out a channel in the gault (No. 2.). This softer bed\r\nwould yield with ease in proportion as parts of it were brought up from\r\ntime to time and exposed to the fury of the waves, so that large spaces\r\noccupied by the harder formation or greensand (No. 3.) would be laid\r\nbare. This last rock, opposing a more effectual resistance, would next\r\nemerge; while the chalk cliffs, at the base of which the gault is\r\nrapidly undermined, would recede farther from each other, after which\r\nfour parallel strips of land, or rows of islands, would be caused, which\r\nare represented by the masses which in fig. 260. rise above the dotted\r\nline indicating the sea-level. In this diagram, however, the inclination\r\nof the upper surface of the formations (Nos. 1. and 3.), is exaggerated.\r\nOriginally this surface must have been level, like the submarine\r\nterraces produced by denudation, and described before (p. 74. and 77.);\r\nbut they were afterwards more and more tilted by that general movement\r\nto which the region of the Weald owes its structure. At length, by the\r\nfarther elevation of the dome-shaped mass, the clay (No. 4.) would be\r\nbrought within reach of the waves, which would probably gain the more\r\neasy access to the subjacent deposit by the rents which would be caused\r\nin No. 3., and in the central part of the ridge where the uplifting\r\nforce had been exerted with the greatest energy. The opposite cliffs, in\r\nwhich the greensand (No. 3.) terminates, would now begin to recede from\r\neach other, having at their base a yielding stratum of clay (No. 4.).\r\nLastly, the sea would penetrate to the sand (No. 5.), and then the\r\nstate of things indicated in the dark lines of the upper section\r\n(fig. 253.), would be consummated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261. The Coomb, near Lewes.]\r\n\r\nIt was stated that there are many lines of flexure and dislocation, running\r\neast and west, or parallel to the central axis of the Wealden. They are\r\nnumerous in the district of the Hastings sand, and sometimes occur in the\r\nchalk itself. One of the latter kind has given rise to the ravine called\r\nthe Coomb, near Lewes, and was first traced out by Dr. Mantell, in whose\r\ncompany I examined it. This coomb is seen on the eastern side of the valley\r\nof the Ouse, in the suburbs of the town of Lewes. The steep declivities on\r\neach side are covered with green turf, as is the bottom, which is perfectly\r\ndry. No outward signs of disturbance are visible; and the connection of the\r\nhollow with subterranean movements would not have been suspected by the\r\ngeologist, had not the evidence of great convulsions been clearly exposed\r\nin the escarpment of the valley of the Ouse, and the numerous chalk pits\r\nworked at the termination of the Coomb. By the aid of these we discover\r\nthat the ravine coincides precisely with a line of fault, on one side of\r\nwhich the chalk with flints (_a_, fig. 262.), appears at the summit of the\r\nhill, while it is thrown down to the bottom on the other.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin, in his work on the geology of Western Sussex, published in\r\n1828, threw much light on the structure of the Wealden by tracing out\r\ncontinuously for miles the direction of many anticlinal lines and cross\r\nfractures; and the same course of investigation has since been followed\r\nout in greater detail by Mr. Hopkins. The mathematician last-mentioned\r\nhas shown that the observed direction of the lines of flexure and\r\ndislocation in the Weald district coincide with those which might have\r\nbeen anticipated theoretically on mechanical principles, if we assume\r\ncertain simple conditions under which the strata were lifted up by an\r\nexpansive subterranean force. He finds by calculation that if this force\r\nwas applied so as to act uniformly upwards within an elliptic area, the\r\nlongitudinal fissures thereby produced would nearly coincide with the\r\noutlines of the ellipse, forming cracks, which are portions of smaller\r\nconcentric ellipses, parallel to the margin of the larger one. These\r\nlongitudinal fissures would also be intercepted by others running at\r\nright angles to them, and both lines of fracture may have been produced\r\nat the same time.[251-A] In this illustration it is supposed that the\r\nexpansive force acted simultaneously and with equal intensity at every\r\npoint within the upheaved area, and not with greater energy along the\r\ncentral axis or region of principal elevation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262. Fault in the cliff hills near Lewes. Mantell.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Chalk with flints.\r\n  _b._ Lower chalk.[251-B]]\r\n\r\nThe geologist cannot fail to derive great advantage in his speculations\r\nfrom the mathematical investigation of a problem of this kind, where\r\nresults free from all uncertainty are obtained on the assumption of certain\r\nsimple conditions. Such results, when once ascertained by mathematical\r\nmethods, may serve as standard cases, to which others occurring in nature\r\nof a more complicated kind may be referred. In order that a uniform force\r\nshould cause the strata to attain in the centre of the ellipse a height so\r\nfar exceeding that which they have reached round the margin, it is\r\nnecessary to assume that the mass of upheaved strata offered originally a\r\nvery unequal degree of resistance to the subterranean force. This may have\r\nhappened either from their being more fractured in one place than in\r\nanother, or from being pressed down by a less weight of incumbent strata;\r\nas if we suppose, what is far from improbable, that great denudation had\r\ntaken place in the middle of the Wealden before the final and principal\r\nupheaval occurred. It is suggested that the beds may have been acted upon\r\nsomewhat in the manner of a carpet spread out loosely on a floor, and\r\nnailed down round the edges, which would swell into the shape of a dome if\r\npressed up equally at every point by air admitted from beneath. But when we\r\nare reasoning on the particular phenomena of the Weald, we have no\r\ngeological data for determining whether it be more probable that originally\r\nthe resistance to be overcome was so extremely unequal in different\r\nplaces, or whether the subterranean force, instead of being everywhere\r\nuniform, was not applied with very different degrees of intensity beneath\r\ndistinct portions of the upraised area.\r\n\r\nThe opinion that both the longitudinal and transverse lines of fracture\r\nmay have been produced simultaneously, accords well with that expressed\r\nby M. Thurmann, in his work on the anticlinal ridges and valleys of\r\nelevation of the Bernese Jura.[252-A] For the accuracy of his map and\r\nsections I can vouch, from personal examination, in 1835, of part of the\r\nregion surveyed by him. Among other results, at which this author\r\narrived, it appears that the breadth of all the numerous anticlinal\r\nridges and dome-shaped masses in the Jura is invariably great in\r\nproportion to the number of the formations exposed to view; or, in other\r\nwords, to the depth to which the superimposed groups of secondary strata\r\nhave been laid open. (See fig. 71. p. 55. for structure of Jura.) He\r\nalso remarks, that the anticlinal lines are occasionally oblique and\r\ncross each other, in which case the greatest dislocation of the beds\r\ntakes place. Some of the cross fractures are imagined by him to have\r\nbeen contemporaneous, others subsequent to the longitudinal ones.\r\n\r\nI have assumed, in the former part of this chapter, that the rise of the\r\nWeald was gradual, whereas many geologists have attributed its elevation to\r\na single effort of subterranean violence. There appears to them such a\r\nunity of effect in this and other lines of deranged strata in the\r\nsouth-east of England, such as that of the Isle of Wight, as is\r\ninconsistent with the supposition of a great number of separate movements\r\nrecurring after long intervals of time. But we know that earthquakes are\r\nrepeated throughout a long series of ages in the same spots, like volcanic\r\neruptions. The oldest lavas of Etna were poured out many thousands, perhaps\r\nmyriads of years before the newest, and yet they, and the movements\r\naccompanying their emission, have produced a symmetrical mountain; and if\r\nrivers of melted matter thus continue to flow in the same direction, and\r\ntowards the same point, for an indefinite lapse of ages, what difficulty is\r\nthere in conceiving that the subterranean volcanic force, occasioning the\r\nrise or fall of certain parts of the earth's crust, may, by reiterated\r\nmovements, produce the most perfect unity of result?\r\n\r\n_Alluvium of the Weald._--Our next inquiry may be directed to the alluvium\r\nstrewed over the surface of the supposed area of denudation. Has any wreck\r\nbeen left behind of the strata removed? To this we may answer, that the\r\nchalk downs even on their summits are covered every where with gravel\r\ncomposed of unrounded and partially rounded chalk flints, such as might\r\nremain after masses of white chalk had been softened and removed by water.\r\nThis superficial accumulation of the hard or siliceous materials of the\r\ndisintegrated strata may be due in some degree to pluvial action; for\r\nduring extraordinary rains a rush of water charged with calcareous matter,\r\nof a milk-white colour, may be seen to descend even gently sloping hills of\r\nchalk. If a layer no thicker than the tenth of an inch be removed once in a\r\ncentury, a considerable mass may in the course of indefinite ages melt\r\naway, leaving nothing save a layer of flinty nodules to attest its former\r\nexistence. These unrolled flints may remain mixed with others more or less\r\nrounded, which the waves left originally on the surface of the chalk, when\r\nit first emerged from the sea. A stratum of fine clay sometimes covers the\r\nsurface of slight depressions and the bottom of valleys in the white chalk,\r\nwhich may represent the aluminous residue of the rock, after the pure\r\ncarbonate of lime has been dissolved by rain water, charged with excess of\r\ncarbonic acid derived from decayed vegetable matter.[253-A]\r\n\r\nAlthough flint gravel is so abundant on the chalk itself, it is usually\r\nwanting in the deep longitudinal valleys at the foot of the chalk\r\nescarpment, although, in some few instances, the detritus of the chalk has\r\nbeen traced in patches over the gault, and even the lower greensand, for a\r\ndistance of several miles from the escarpment of the North and South Downs.\r\nBut no vestige of the chalk and its flints has been seen on the central\r\nridge of the Weald or the Hastings sands, but merely gravel derived from\r\nthe rocks immediately subjacent. This distribution of alluvium, and\r\nespecially the absence of chalk detritus in the central district, agrees\r\nwell with the theory of denudation before set forth; for to return to fig.\r\n259., if the chalk (No. 1.) were once continuous and covered every where\r\nwith flint gravel, this superficial covering would be the first to be\r\ncarried away from the highest part of the dome long before any of the gault\r\n(No. 2.) was laid bare. Now if some ruins of the chalk remain at first on\r\nthe gault, these would be, in a great degree, cleared away before any part\r\nof the lower greensand (No. 3.) is denuded. Thus in proportion to the\r\nnumber and thickness of the groups removed in succession, is the\r\nprobability lessened of our finding any remnants of the highest group\r\nstrewed over the bared surface of the lowest.\r\n\r\nAs an exception to the general rule of the small distance to which any\r\nwreck of the chalk can be traced from the escarpments of the North and\r\nSouth Downs, I may mention a thick bed of chalk flints which occurs near\r\nBarcombe, about three miles to the north of Lewes (see fig. 263.), a place\r\nwhich I visited with Dr. Mantell, to whom I am indebted for the\r\naccompanying section. Even here it will be seen that the gravel reaches no\r\nfarther than the Weald Clay. The same section shows one of the minor east\r\nand west anticlinal lines before alluded to (p. 244.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263.

Weald clay.]\r\n\r\n_At what period the Weald Valley was denuded._--If we inquire at what\r\ngeological period the denudation of the Weald was effected, we shall\r\nimmediately perceive that the question is limited to this point, whether it\r\ntook place during or subsequent to the deposition of the Eocene strata of\r\nthe south of England. For in the basins of London and Hampshire the Eocene\r\nstrata are conformable to the chalk, being horizontal where the beds of\r\nchalk are horizontal, and vertical where they are vertical, so that both\r\nseries of rocks appear to have participated in nearly the same movements.\r\nAt the eastern extremity of the Isle of Wight, some beds even of the\r\nfreshwater series have been thrown on their edges, like those of the London\r\nclay. Nevertheless we can by no means infer that all the tertiary deposits\r\nof the London and Hampshire basins once extended like the chalk over the\r\nentire valley of the Weald, because the denudation of the chalk and\r\ngreensand may have been going on in the centre of that area, while\r\ncontiguous parts of the sea were sufficiently deep to receive and retain\r\nthe matter derived from that waste. Thus while the waves and currents were\r\nexcavating the longitudinal valleys D and C (fig. 264.), the deposits _a_\r\nmay have been thrown down to the bottom of the contiguous deep water E, the\r\nsediment being drifted through transverse fissures, as before explained. In\r\nthis case, the rise of the formations Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, may have been\r\ngoing on contemporaneously with the excavation of the valleys C and D, and\r\nwith the accumulation of the tertiary strata _a_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nThis idea receives some countenance from the fact of the tertiary strata,\r\nnear their junction with the chalk of the London and Hampshire basins,\r\noften consisting of dense beds of sand and shingle, as at Blackheath and in\r\nthe Addington Hills near Croydon. They also contain occasionally freshwater\r\nshells and the remains of land animals and plants, which indicate the\r\nformer presence of land at no great distance, some part of which may have\r\noccupied the centre of the Weald.\r\n\r\nSuch masses of well-rolled pebbles occurring in the lowest Eocene\r\nstrata, or those called \"the plastic clay and sands\" before described\r\n(No. 3. _b_, Tab. p. 197.), imply the neighbourhood of an ancient shore.\r\nThey also indicate the destruction of pre-existing chalk with flints. At\r\nthe same time fossil shells of the genera _Melania_, _Cyclas_, and\r\n_Unio_, appearing here and there in beds of the same age, together with\r\nplants and the bones of land animals, bear testimony to contiguous land,\r\nwhich probably constituted islands scattered over the space now occupied\r\nby the tertiary basins of the Seine and Thames. The stage of denudation\r\nrepresented in fig. 259., p. 249., may explain the state of things\r\nprevailing at points where such islands existed. By the alternate rising\r\nand sinking of the white chalk and older beds, a large area may have\r\nbecome overspread with gravelly sandy, and clayey beds of fluvio-marine\r\nand shallow-water origin, before any of the London clay proper (or\r\nCalcaire grossier in France) were superimposed. This may account for the\r\nfact that patches of \"plastic clay and sand\" (No. 3. _b_, Tab. p. 197.),\r\nare scattered over the surface of the chalk, reaching in some places to\r\ngreat heights, and approaching even the edges of the escarpments. We\r\nmust suppose that subsequently a gradual subsidence took place in\r\ncertain areas, which allowed the London clay proper to accumulate over\r\nthe Lower Eocene sands and clays, in a deep sea. During this sinking\r\ndown (the vertical amount of which equalled 800, and in parts of the\r\nIsle of Wight, according to Mr. Prestwich, 1800 feet), the work of\r\ndenudation would be unceasing, being always however confined to those\r\nareas where land or islands existed. At length, when the Bagshot sand\r\nhad been in its turn thrown down on the London clay, the space covered\r\nby these two formations was again upraised from the sea to about the\r\nheight which it has since retained. During this upheaval, the waves\r\nwould again exert their power, not only on the white chalk and lower\r\ncretaceous and Wealden strata, but also on the Eocene formations of\r\nthe London basin, excavating valleys and undermining cliffs as the\r\nstrata emerged from the deep.\r\n\r\nThere are grounds, as before stated (p. 205.), for presuming that the\r\ntertiary area of London was converted into land before that of\r\nHampshire, and for this reason it contains no marine Eocene deposits so\r\nmodern as those of Barton Cliff, or the still newer freshwater and\r\nfluvio-marine beds of Hordwell and the Isle of Wight. These last seem\r\nunequivocally to demonstrate the local inequality of the upheaving and\r\ndepressing movements of the period alluded to; for we find, in spite of\r\nthe evidence afforded in Alum and White Cliff Bays, of continued\r\ndepression to the extent of 1800 or 2000 feet, that at the close of the\r\nEocene period a dense formation of freshwater strata was produced. The\r\nfossils of these strata bear testimony to rivers draining adjacent\r\nlands, and the existence of numerous quadrupeds on those lands.\r\nInstead of such phenomena, the signs of an open sea might naturally\r\nhave been expected as the consequence of so much subsidence, had\r\nnot the depression been accompanied or followed by upheaval in a\r\nregion immediately adjoining.\r\n\r\nWhen we attempt to speculate on the geographical changes which took place\r\nin the earlier part of the Eocene epoch, and to restore in imagination the\r\nformer state of the physical geography of the south-east of England, we\r\nshall do well to bear in mind that wherever there are proofs of great\r\ndenudation, there also the greatest area of land has probably existed. In\r\nthe same space, moreover, the oscillations of level, and the alternate\r\nsubmergence and emergence of coasts, may be presumed to have been most\r\nfrequent; for these fluctuations facilitate the wasting and removing power\r\nof waves, currents, and rivers.\r\n\r\nWe should also remember that there is always a tendency in the last\r\ndenuding operations, to efface all signs of preceding denudation, or at\r\nleast all those marks of waste from which alone a geologist can ascertain\r\nthe date of the removal of the missing strata within the denuded area. It\r\nmay often be difficult to settle the chronology even of the last of a\r\nseries of such acts of removal, but it must be, in the nature of things,\r\nalmost always impossible to assign a date to each of the antecedent\r\ndenudations. If we wish to determine the times of the destruction of rocks,\r\nwe must look any where rather than to the spaces once occupied by the\r\nmissing rocks. We must inquire to what regions the ruins of the white\r\nchalk, greensand, Wealden, and other strata which have disappeared were\r\ntransported. We are then led at once to the examination of all the deposits\r\nnewer than the chalk, and first to the oldest of these, the Lower Eocene,\r\nand its sand, shingle, and clay. In them, so largely developed in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the denuded area, we discover the wreck we are\r\nin search of, regularly stratified, and inclosing, in some of its layers,\r\norganic remains of a littoral, and sometimes fluviatile character. What\r\nmore can we desire? The shores must have consisted of chalk, greensand, and\r\nWealden, since these were the only superficial rocks in the south-east of\r\nEngland, at the commencement of the Eocene epoch. The waves of the sea,\r\ntherefore, and the rivers were grinding down chalk-flints and chert from\r\nthe greensand into shingle and sand, or were washing away calcareous and\r\nargillaceous matter from the cretaceous and Wealden beds, during the whole\r\nof the Eocene period. Thus we obtain the date of a great part at least of\r\nthat enormous amount of denudation of which we have such striking monuments\r\nin the space intervening between the North and South Downs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265. Cross section.\r\n\r\n   A.  Chalk with layers of flint dipping slightly to the south.\r\n  _b._ Ancient beach, consisting of fine sand, from one to four feet thick,\r\n       covered by shingle from five to eight feet thick of pebbles of\r\n       chalk-flint, granite, and other rocks, with broken shells of recent\r\n       marine species, and bones of cetacea.\r\n  _c._ Elephant bed, about fifty feet thick, consisting of layers of white\r\n       chalk rubble, with broken chalk-flints, in which deposit are found\r\n       bones of ox, deer, horse, and mammoth.\r\n  _d._ Sand and shingle of modern beach.]\r\n\r\nThere have been some movements of land on a smaller scale since the Eocene\r\nperiod in the south-east of England. One of the latest of these happened in\r\nthe Pleistocene, or even perhaps as late as the Post-Pliocene period. The\r\nformation called by Dr. Mantell the Elephant Bed, at the foot of the chalk\r\ncliffs at Brighton, is not merely a talus of calcareous rubble collected at\r\nthe base of an inland cliff, but exhibits every appearance of having been\r\nspread out in successive horizontal layers by water in motion.\r\n\r\nThe deposit alluded to skirts the shores between Brighton and Rottingdean,\r\nand another mass apparently of the same age occurs at Dover. The phenomena\r\nappear to me to suggest the following conclusions:--First, the\r\nsouth-eastern part of England had acquired its actual configuration when\r\nthe ancient chalk cliff A _a_ was formed, the beach of sand and shingle _b_\r\nhaving then been thrown up at the base of the cliff. Afterwards the whole\r\ncoast, or at least that part of it where the elephant bed now extends,\r\nsubsided to the depth of 50 or 60 feet; and during the period of\r\nsubmergence successive layers of white calcareous rubble _c_ were\r\naccumulated, so as to cover the ancient beach _b_. Subsequently, the coast\r\nwas again raised, so that the ancient shore was elevated to a level\r\nsomewhat higher than its original position.[257-A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[241-A] An account of these cliffs was read by the author to the British\r\nAssoc. at Glasgow, Sept. 1840.\r\n\r\n[241-B] Seine-Inferieure, p. 142. and pl. 6. fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[243-A] Botley Hill, near Godstone, in Surrey, was found by\r\ntrigonometrical measurement to be 880 feet above the level of the sea;\r\nand Wrotham Hill, near Maidstone, which appears to be next in height of\r\nthe North Downs, 795 feet.\r\n\r\n[243-B] My friend Dr. Mantell has kindly drawn up this scale at my request.\r\n\r\n[244-A] Fitton, Geol. of Hastings, p. 55.\r\n\r\n[244-B] Conybeare, Outlines of Geol., p. 81.\r\n\r\n[245-A] Ibid., p. 145.\r\n\r\n[245-B] Geol. of Western Sussex, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[247-A] See illustrations of this theory by Dr. Fitton, Geol.\r\nSketch of Hastings.\r\n\r\n[248-A] Sir E.

This group has been so\r\nnamed, because, in the countries where it was first examined, the\r\nlimestones belonging to it had an oolitic structure (see p. 12.). These\r\nrocks occupy in England a zone which is nearly 30 miles in average breadth,\r\nand extends across the island, from Yorkshire in the north-east, to\r\nDorsetshire in the south-west. Their mineral characters are not uniform\r\nthroughout this region; but the following are the names of the principal\r\nsubdivisions observed in the central and south-eastern parts of England:--\r\n\r\n                 OOLITE.\r\n\r\n  Upper  { _a._ Portland stone and sand.\r\n         { _b._ Kimmeridge clay.\r\n\r\n  Middle { _c._ Coral rag.\r\n         { _d._ Oxford clay.\r\n\r\n  Lower  { _e._ Cornbrash and Forest marble.\r\n         { _f._ Great Oolite and Stonesfield slate.\r\n         { _g._ Fuller's earth.\r\n         { _h._ Inferior Oolite.\r\n\r\n     The Lias then succeeds to the Inferior Oolite.\r\n\r\nThe Upper oolitic system of the above table has usually the Kimmeridge\r\nclay for its base; the Middle oolitic system, the Oxford clay. The Lower\r\nsystem reposes on the Lias, an argillo-calcareous formation, which some\r\ninclude in the Lower Oolite, but which will be treated of separately in\r\nthe next chapter. Many of these subdivisions are distinguished by\r\npeculiar organic remains; and though varying in thickness, may be traced\r\nin certain directions for great distances, especially if we compare the\r\npart of England to which the above-mentioned type refers with the\r\nnorth-east of France, and the Jura mountains adjoining. In that country,\r\ndistant above 400 geographical miles, the analogy to the English type,\r\nnotwithstanding the thinness, or occasional absence of the clays, is\r\nmore perfect than in Yorkshire or Normandy.\r\n\r\n_Physical geography._--The alternation, on a grand scale, of distinct\r\nformations of clay and limestone, has caused the oolitic and liassic series\r\nto give rise to some marked features in the physical outline of parts of\r\nEngland and France. Wide valleys can usually be traced throughout the long\r\nbounds of country where the argillaceous strata crop out; and between these\r\nvalleys the limestones are observed, composing ranges of hills, or more\r\nelevated grounds. These ranges terminate abruptly on the side on which the\r\nseveral clays rise up from beneath the calcareous strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed diagram will give the reader an idea of the configuration of\r\nthe surface now alluded to, such as may be seen in passing from London to\r\nCheltenham, or in other parallel lines, from east to west, in the southern\r\npart of England. It has been necessary, however, in this drawing, greatly\r\nto exaggerate the inclination of the beds, and the height of the several\r\nformations, as compared to their horizontal extent. It will be remarked,\r\nthat the lines of cliff, or escarpment, face towards the west in the great\r\ncalcareous eminences formed by the Chalk and the Upper, Middle, and Lower\r\nOolites; and at the base of which we have respectively the Gault,\r\nKimmeridge clay, Oxford clay, and Lias. This last forms, generally, a broad\r\nvale at the foot of the escarpment of inferior oolite, but where it\r\nacquires considerable thickness, and contains solid beds of marlstone, it\r\noccupies the lower part of the escarpment.\r\n\r\nThe external outline of the country which the geologist observes in\r\ntravelling eastward from Paris to Metz is precisely analogous, and is\r\ncaused by a similar succession of rocks intervening between the tertiary\r\nstrata and the Lias; with this difference, however, that the escarpments\r\nof Chalk, Upper, Middle, and Lower Oolites, face towards the east\r\ninstead of the west.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk crops out from beneath the tertiary sands and clays of the Paris\r\nbasin, near Epernay, and the Gault from beneath the Chalk and Upper\r\nGreensand at Clermont-en-Argonne; and passing from this place by Verdun and\r\nEtain to Metz, we find two limestone ranges, with intervening vales of\r\nclay, precisely resembling those of southern and central England, until we\r\nreach the great plain of Lias at the base of the Inferior Oolite at Metz.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the denuding causes have acted similarly\r\nover an area several hundred miles in diameter, sweeping away the softer\r\nclays more extensively than the limestones, and undermining these last so\r\nas to cause them to form steep cliffs wherever the harder calcareous rock\r\nwas based upon a more yielding and destructible clay. This denudation\r\nprobably occurred while the land was slowly rising out of the sea.[259-A]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Upper Oolite._\r\n\r\nThe Portland stone has already been mentioned as forming in Dorsetshire\r\nthe foundation on which the freshwater limestone of the Lower Purbeck\r\nreposes (see p. 232.). It supplies the well-known building stone of\r\nwhich St. Paul's and so many of the principal edifices of London are\r\nconstructed. This upper member, characterized by peculiar marine\r\nfossils, rests on a dense bed of sand, called the Portland sand, below\r\nwhich is the Kimmeridge clay. In England these Upper Oolite formations\r\nare almost wholly confined to the southern counties. Corals are rare in\r\nthem, although one species is found plentifully at Tisbury, in\r\nWiltshire, in the Portland sand converted into flint and chert, the\r\noriginal calcareous matter being replaced by silex (fig. 267.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267. _Columnaria oblonga_, Blainv.\r\n\r\nAs seen on a polished slab of chert from the sand of the\r\nUpper Oolite, Tisbury.]\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristic fossils of the Upper Oolite, may be mentioned\r\nthe _Ostrea deltoidea_ (fig. 269.), found in the Kimmeridge clay\r\nthroughout England and the north of France, and also in Scotland, near\r\nBrora. The _Gryphaea virgula_ (fig. 268.), also met with in the same clay\r\nnear Oxford, is so abundant in the Upper Oolite of parts of France as to\r\nhave caused the deposit to be termed \"marnes a gryphees virgules.\" Near\r\nClermont, in Argonne, a few leagues from St. Menehould, where these\r\nindurated marls crop out from beneath the gault, I have seen them, on\r\ndecomposing, leave the surface of every ploughed field literally strewed\r\nover with this fossil oyster.\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Upper Oolite: Kimmeridge clay. 1/4 nat. size.\r\n\r\nFig. 268. _Gryphaea virgula._\r\n\r\nFig. 269. _Ostrea deltoidea._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 270. _Trigonia gibbosa._ 1/2 nat. size. _a._ the hinge.\r\n\r\nPortland Oolite, Tisbury.]\r\n\r\nThe Kimmeridge clay consists, in great part, of a bituminous shale,\r\nsometimes forming an impure coal several hundred feet in thickness. In\r\nsome places in Wiltshire it much resembles peat; and the bituminous\r\nmatter may have been, in part at least, derived from the decomposition\r\nof vegetables. But as impressions of plants are rare in these shales,\r\nwhich contain ammonites, oysters, and other marine shells, the bitumen\r\nmay perhaps be of animal origin.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated lithographic stone of Solenhofen, in Bavaria, belongs to one\r\nof the upper divisions of the oolite, and affords a remarkable example of\r\nthe variety of fossils which may be preserved under favourable\r\ncircumstances, and what delicate impressions of the tender parts of certain\r\nanimals and plants may be retained where the sediment is of extreme\r\nfineness. Although the number of testacea in this slate is small, and the\r\nplants few, and those all marine, Count Munster had determined no less than\r\n237 species of fossils when I saw his collection in 1833; and among them no\r\nless than seven _species_ of flying lizards, or pterodactyls, six saurians,\r\nthree tortoises, sixty species of fish, forty-six of crustacea, and\r\ntwenty-six of insects. These insects, among which is a libellula, or\r\ndragon-fly, must have been blown out to sea, probably from the same land to\r\nwhich the flying lizards, and other contemporaneous reptiles, resorted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Middle Oolite._\r\n\r\n_Coral Rag._--One of the limestones of the Middle Oolite has been called\r\nthe \"Coral Rag,\" because it consists, in part, of continuous beds of\r\npetrified corals, for the most part retaining the position in which they\r\ngrew at the bottom of the sea. They belong chiefly to the genera\r\n_Caryophyllia_ (fig. 271.), _Agaricia_, and _Astrea_, and sometimes form\r\nmasses of coral 15 feet thick. In the annexed figure of an _Astrea_, from\r\nthis formation, it will be seen that the cup-shaped cavities are deepest on\r\nthe right-hand side, and that they grow more and more shallow, till those\r\non the left side are nearly filled up. The last-named stars are supposed to\r\nbe Polyparia of advanced age. These coralline strata extend through the\r\ncalcareous hills of the N.W. of Berkshire, and north of Wilts, and again\r\nrecur in Yorkshire, near Scarborough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271. _Caryophyllia annularis_, Parkin. Coral\r\nrag, Steeple Ashton.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 272. _Astrea._ Coral rag.]\r\n\r\nOne of the limestones of the Jura, referred to the age of the English\r\ncoral rag, has been called \"Nerinaean limestone\" (Calcaire a Nerinees) by\r\nM. Thirria; _Nerinaea_ being an extinct genus of univalve shells, much\r\nresembling the _Cerithium_ in external form. The annexed section (fig.\r\n273.) shows the curious form of the hollow part of each whorl, and also\r\nthe perforation which passes up the middle of the columella. _N.\r\nGoodhallii_ (fig. 274.) is another English species of the same genus,\r\nfrom a formation which seems to form a passage from the Kimmeridge clay\r\nto the coral rag.[261-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 273. _Nerinaea hieroglyphica._ Coral rag.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 274. _Nerinaea Goodhallii_, Fitton. Coral rag,\r\nWeymouth. 1/4 nat. size.]\r\n\r\nA division of the oolite in the Alps, regarded by most geologists as coeval\r\nwith the English coral rag, has been often named \"Calcaire a Dicerates,\" or\r\n\"Diceras limestone,\" from its containing abundantly a bivalve shell (see\r\nfig. 275.) of a genus allied to the _Chama_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 275. Cast of _Diceras arietina_. Coral rag, France.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 276. _Cidaris coronata._ Coral rag.]\r\n\r\n_Oxford Clay._--The coralline limestone, or \"coral rag,\" above described,\r\nand the accompanying sandy beds, called \"calcareous grits\" of the Middle\r\nOolite, rests on a thick bed of clay, called the Oxford clay, sometimes not\r\nless than 500 feet thick. In this there are no corals, but great abundance\r\nof cephalopoda of the genera Ammonite and Belemnite. (See fig. 277.) In\r\nsome of the clay of very fine texture ammonites are very perfect, although\r\nsomewhat compressed, and are seen to be furnished on each side of the\r\naperture with a single horn-like projection (see fig. 278.). These were\r\ndiscovered in the cuttings of the Great Western Railway, near Chippenham,\r\nin 1841, and have been described by Mr. Pratt.[262-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 277. _Belemnites hastatus._ Oxford Clay.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 278. _Ammonites Jason_, Reinecke. Syn. _A. Elizabethae_,\r\nPratt. Oxford clay, Christian Malford, Wiltshire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279. _Belemnites Puzosianus_, D'Orb.

It\r\nconsists of clays and calcareous sandstones, which pass downwards into\r\nthe Forest marble, an argillaceous limestone, abounding in marine\r\nfossils. In some places, as at Bradford, this limestone is replaced by a\r\nmass of clay. The sandstones of the Forest Marble of Wiltshire are often\r\nripple-marked and filled with fragments of broken shells and pieces of\r\ndrift-wood, having evidently been formed on a coast. Rippled slabs of\r\nfissile oolite are used for roofing, and have been traced over a broad\r\nband of country from Bradford, in Wilts, to Tetbury, in Gloucestershire.\r\nThese calcareous tile-stones are separated from each other by thin seams\r\nof clay, which have been deposited upon them, and have taken their form,\r\npreserving the undulating ridges and furrows of the sand in such\r\ncomplete integrity, that the impressions of small footsteps, apparently\r\nof crabs, which walked over the soft wet sands, are still visible. In\r\nthe same stone the claws of crabs, fragments of echini, and other signs\r\nof a neighbouring beach are observed.[263-B]\r\n\r\n_Great Oolite._--Although the name of coral-rag has been appropriated,\r\nas we have seen, to a member of the Upper Oolite before described,\r\nsome portions of the Lower Oolite are equally intitled in many places\r\nto be called coralline limestones. Thus the Great Oolite near Bath\r\ncontains various corals, among which the _Eunomia radiata_ (fig. 280.)\r\nis very conspicuous, single individuals forming masses several feet\r\nin diameter; and having probably required, like the large existing\r\nbrain-coral (_Meandrina_) of the tropics, many centuries before\r\ntheir growth was completed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280. _Eunomia radiata_, Lamouroux.\r\n\r\n  _a._ section transverse to the tubes.\r\n  _b._ vertical section, showing the radiation of the tubes.\r\n  _c._ portion of interior of tubes magnified, showing striated surface.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281. _Apiocrinites rotundus_, or Pear Encrinite;\r\nMiller. Fossil at Bradford, Wilts.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Stem of _Apiocrinites_, and one of the articulations, natural size.\r\n  _b._ Section at Bradford of great oolite and overlying clay, containing\r\n       the fossil encrinites. See text.\r\n  _c._ Three perfect individuals of Apiocrinites, represented as they grew\r\n       on the surface of the Great Oolite.\r\n  _d._ Body of the _Apiocrinites rotundus_.]\r\n\r\nDifferent species of _Crinoideans_, or stone-lilies, are also common in the\r\nsame rocks with corals; and, like them, must have enjoyed a firm bottom,\r\nwhere their root, or base of attachment, remained undisturbed for years\r\n(_c_, fig. 281.). Such fossils, therefore, are almost confined to the\r\nlimestones; but an exception occurs at Bradford, near Bath, where they are\r\nenveloped in clay. In this case, however, it appears that the solid upper\r\nsurface of the \"Great Oolite\" had supported, for a time, a thick submarine\r\nforest of these beautiful zoophytes, until the clear and still water was\r\ninvaded by a current charged with mud, which threw down the stone-lilies,\r\nand broke most of their stems short off near the point of attachment. The\r\nstumps still remain in their original position; but the numerous\r\narticulations once composing the stem, arms, and body of the zoophyte, were\r\nscattered at random through the argillaceous deposit in which some now lie\r\nprostrate. These appearances are represented in the section _b_, fig. 281.,\r\nwhere the darker strata represent the Bradford clay, which some geologists\r\nclass with the Forest marble, others with the Great Oolite. The upper\r\nsurface of the calcareous stone below is completely incrusted over with a\r\ncontinuous pavement, formed by the stony roots or attachments of the\r\nCrinoidea; and besides this evidence of the length of time they had lived\r\non the spot, we find great numbers of single joints, or circular plates of\r\nthe stem and body of the encrinite, covered over with _serpulae_. Now these\r\n_serpulae_ could only have begun to grow after the death of some of the\r\nstone-lilies, parts of whose skeletons had been strewed over the floor of\r\nthe ocean before the irruption of argillaceous mud. In some instances we\r\nfind that, after the parasitic _serpulae_ were full grown, they had become\r\nincrusted over with a coral, called _Berenicea diluviana_; and many\r\ngenerations of these polyps had succeeded each other in the pure water\r\nbefore they became fossil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Single plate or articulation of an Encrinite overgrown with\r\n       _serpulae_ and corals. Natural size Bradford clay.\r\n  _b._ Portion of the same magnified, showing the coral _Berenicea_\r\n       _diluviana_ covering one of the _serpulae_.]\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, perceive distinctly that, as the pines and cycadeous\r\nplants of the ancient \"dirt bed,\" or fossil forest, of the Lower Purbeck\r\nwere killed by submergence under fresh water, and soon buried beneath\r\nmuddy sediment, so an invasion of argillaceous matter put a sudden stop\r\nto the growth of the Bradford Encrinites, and led to their preservation\r\nin marine strata.[265-A]\r\n\r\nSuch differences in the fossils as distinguish the calcareous and\r\nargillaceous deposits from each other, would be described by naturalists\r\nas arising out of a difference in the _stations_ of species; but besides\r\nthese, there are variations in the fossils of the higher, middle, and\r\nlower part of the oolitic series, which must be ascribed to that great\r\nlaw of change in organic life by which distinct assemblages of species\r\nhave been adapted, at successive geological periods, to the varying\r\nconditions of the habitable surface. In a single district it is\r\ndifficult to decide how far the limitation of species to certain minor\r\nformations has been due to the local influence of _stations_, or how\r\nfar it has been caused by time or the creative and destroying law above\r\nalluded to. But we recognize the reality of the last-mentioned\r\ninfluence, when we contrast the whole oolitic series of England with\r\nthat of parts of the Jura, Alps, and other distant regions, where there\r\nis scarcely any lithological resemblance; and yet some of the same\r\nfossils remain peculiar in each country to the Upper, Middle, and Lower\r\nOolite formations respectively. Mr. Thurmann has shown how remarkably\r\nthis fact holds true in the Bernese Jura, although the argillaceous\r\ndivisions, so conspicuous in England, are feebly represented there,\r\nand some entirely wanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283. _Terebratula digona._ Bradford clay. Nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThe Bradford clay above alluded to is sometimes 60 feet thick, but, in many\r\nplaces, it is wanting; and, in others, where there are no limestones, it\r\ncannot easily be separated from the clays of the overlying \"forest marble\"\r\nand underlying \"fuller's earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe calcareous portion of the Great Oolite consists of several shelly\r\nlimestones, one of which, called the Bath Oolite, is much celebrated as\r\na building stone. In parts of Gloucestershire, especially near\r\nMinchinhampton, the Great Oolite, says Mr. Lycett, \"must have been\r\ndeposited in a shallow sea, where strong currents prevailed, for there\r\nare frequent changes in the mineral character of the deposit, and some\r\nbeds exhibit false stratification. In others, heaps of broken shells are\r\nmingled with pebbles of rocks foreign to the neighbourhood, and with\r\nfragments of abraded madrepores, dicotyledonous wood, and crabs' claws.\r\nThe shelly strata, also, have occasionally suffered denudation, and the\r\nremoved portions have been replaced by clay.\"[266-A] In such\r\nshallow-water beds cephalopoda are rare, and, instead of ammonites and\r\nbelemnites, numerous genera of carnivorous trachelipods appear. Out of\r\none hundred and forty-two species of univalves obtained from the\r\nMinchinhampton beds, Mr. Lycett found no less than forty-one to be\r\ncarnivorous. They belong principally to the genera _Buccinum_,\r\n_Pleurotoma_, _Rostellaria_, _Murex_, and _Fusus_, and exhibit a\r\nproportion of zoophagous species not very different from that which\r\nobtains in warm seas of the recent period. These conchological results\r\nare curious and unexpected, since it was imagined that we might look\r\nin vain for the carnivorous trachelipods in rocks of such high\r\nantiquity as the Great Oolite, and it was a received doctrine that\r\nthey did not begin to appear in considerable numbers till the Eocene\r\nperiod when those two great families of cephalopoda, the ammonites\r\nand belemnites, had become extinct.\r\n\r\n_Stonesfield slate._--The slate of Stonesfield has been shown by Mr.\r\nLonsdale to lie at the base of the Great Oolite.[266-B] It is a slightly\r\noolitic shelly limestone, forming large spheroidal masses imbedded in\r\nsand, only 6 feet thick, but very rich in organic remains. It contains some\r\npebbles of a rock very similar to itself, and which may be portions of the\r\ndeposit, broken up on a shore at low water or during storms, and\r\nredeposited. The remains of belemnites, trigoniae, and other marine shells,\r\nwith fragments of wood, are common, and impressions of ferns, cycadeae, and\r\nother plants. Several insects, also, and, among the rest, the wing-covers\r\nof beetles, are perfectly preserved (see fig. 284.), some of them\r\napproaching nearly to the genus _Buprestis_.[267-A] The remains, also, of\r\nmany genera of reptiles, such as _Plesiosaur_, _Crocodile_, and\r\n_Pterodactyl_, have been discovered in the same limestone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284. Elytron of _Buprestis_? Stonesfield.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 285. Bone of a reptile, formerly supposed to be the\r\nulna of a Cetacean; from the Great Oolite of Enstone, near Woodstock.]\r\n\r\nBut the remarkable fossils for which the Stonesfield slate is most\r\ncelebrated, are those referred to the mammiferous class. The student should\r\nbe reminded that in all the rocks described in the preceding chapters as\r\nolder than the Eocene, no bones of any land quadruped, or of any cetacean,\r\nhave been discovered. Yet we have seen that terrestrial plants were not\r\nrare in the lower cretaceous formation, and that in the Wealden there was\r\nevidence of freshwater sediment on a large scale, containing various\r\nplants, and even ancient vegetable soils with the roots and erect stumps of\r\ntrees. We had also in the same Wealden many land-reptiles and\r\nwinged-insects, which renders the absence of terrestrial quadrupeds the\r\nmore striking. The want, however, of any bones of whales, seals, dolphins,\r\nand other aquatic mammalia, whether in the chalk or in the upper or middle\r\noolite, is certainly still more remarkable. Formerly, indeed, a bone from\r\nthe great oolite of Enstone, near Woodstock, in Oxfordshire, was cited, on\r\nthe authority of Cuvier, as referable to this class. Dr. Buckland, who\r\nstated this in his Bridgewater Treatise[267-B], had the kindness to send me\r\nthe supposed ulna of a whale, that Mr. Owen might examine into its claims\r\nto be considered as cetaceous. It is the opinion of that eminent\r\ncomparative anatomist that it cannot have belonged to the cetacea, because\r\nthe fore-arm in these marine mammalia is invariably much flatter, and\r\ndevoid of all muscular depressions and ridges, one of which is so prominent\r\nin the middle of this bone, represented in the above cut (fig. 285.). In\r\nsaurians, on the contrary, such ridges exist for the attachment of muscles;\r\nand to some animal of that class the bone is probably referable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286. _Amphitherium Prevostii_. Stonesfield\r\nSlate. Natural size.\r\n\r\n  _a_. coronoid process.\r\n  _b_. condyle.\r\n  _c_. angle of jaw.\r\n  _d_. double-fanged molars.]\r\n\r\nThese observations are made to prepare the reader to appreciate more justly\r\nthe interest felt by every geologist in the discovery in the Stonesfield\r\nslate of no less than seven specimens of lower jaws of mammiferous\r\nquadrupeds, belonging to three different species and to two distinct\r\ngenera, for which the names of _Amphitherium_ and _Phascolotherium_ have\r\nbeen adopted. When Cuvier was first shown one of these fossils in 1818, he\r\npronounced it to belong to a small ferine mammal, with a jaw much\r\nresembling that of an opossum, but differing from all known ferine genera,\r\nin the great number of the molar teeth, of which it had at least ten in a\r\nrow. Since that period, a much more perfect specimen of the same fossil,\r\nobtained by Dr. Buckland (see fig. 286.), has been examined by Mr. Owen,\r\nwho finds that the jaw contained on the whole twelve molar teeth, with the\r\nsocket of a small canine, and three small incisors, which are _in situ_,\r\naltogether amounting to sixteen teeth on each side of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287. _Amphitherium Broderipii_. Natural size.\r\nStonesfield Slate.]\r\n\r\nThe only question which could be raised respecting the nature of these\r\nfossils was, whether they belonged to a mammifer, a reptile, or a fish. Now\r\non this head the osteologist observes that each of the seven half jaws is\r\ncomposed of but one single piece, and not of two or more separate bones, as\r\nin fishes and most reptiles, or of two bones, united by a suture, as in\r\nsome few species belonging to those classes. The condyle, moreover (_b_,\r\nfig. 286.), or articular surface, by which the lower jaw unites with the\r\nupper, is convex in the Stonesfield specimens, and not concave as in fishes\r\nand reptiles. The coronoid process (_a_, fig. 286.) is well developed,\r\nwhereas it is wanting or very small, in the inferior classes of vertebrata.\r\nLastly, the molar teeth in the _Amphitherium_ and _Phascolotherium_ have\r\ncomplicated crowns, and two roots (see _d_, fig. 286.), instead of being\r\nsimple and with single fangs.[269-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288. _Tupaia Tana._ Right ramus of lower jaw, natural\r\nsize. A recent insectivorous mammal from Sumatra.]\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Part of lower jaw of _Tupaia Tana_; twice natural size.\r\n\r\nFig. 289. End view seen from behind, showing the very slight inflection of\r\nthe angle at _c_.\r\n\r\nFig. 290.

End view seen from behind, showing the inflection of the angle of\r\nthe jaw, _c. d._\r\n\r\nFig. 292. Side view of same.]\r\n\r\nThe only question, therefore, which could fairly admit of controversy\r\nwas limited to this point, whether the fossil mammalia found in the\r\nlower oolite of Oxfordshire ought to be referred to the marsupial\r\nquadrupeds, or to the ordinary placental series. Cuvier had long ago\r\npointed out a peculiarity in the form of the angular process (_c_, figs.\r\n291. and 292.) of the lower jaw, as a character of the genus\r\n_Didelphys_; and Mr. Owen has since established its generality in the\r\nentire marsupial series. In all these pouched quadrupeds, this process\r\nis turned inwards, as at _c d_, fig. 291. in the Brazilian opossum,\r\nwhereas in the placental series, as at _c_, figs. 290. and 289. there is\r\nan almost entire absence of such inflection. The _Tupaia Tana_ of\r\nSumatra has been selected by my friend Mr. Waterhouse, for this\r\nillustration, because that small insectivorous quadruped bears a great\r\nresemblance to those of the Stonesfield _Amphitherium_. By clearing away\r\nthe matrix from the specimen of _Amphitherium Prevostii_ above\r\nrepresented (fig. 286.), Mr. Owen ascertained that the angular process\r\n(_c_) bent inwards in a slighter degree than in any of the known\r\nmarsupialia; in short, the inflection does not exceed that of the mole\r\nor hedgehog. This fact turns the scale in favour of its affinities to\r\nthe placental insectivora. Nevertheless, the _Amphitherium_ offers some\r\npoints of approximation in its osteology to the marsupials, especially\r\nto the _Myrmecobius_, a small insectivorous quadruped of Australia,\r\nwhich has nine molars on each side of the lower jaw, besides a canine\r\nand three incisors.[269-B]\r\n\r\nAnother species of _Amphitherium_ has been found at Stonesfield (fig.\r\n287. p. 268.), which differs from the former (fig. 286.) principally\r\nin being larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 293. _Phascolotherium Bucklandi_, Owen.\r\n\r\n  _a._ natural size.\r\n  _b._ molar of same magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe second mammiferous genus discovered in the same slates was named\r\noriginally by Mr. Broderip _Didelphys Bucklandi_ (see fig. 293.), and\r\nhas since been called _Phascolotherium_ by Owen. It manifests a much\r\nstronger likeness to the marsupials in the general form of the jaw, and\r\nin the extent and position of its inflected angle, while the agreement\r\nwith the living genus _Didelphys_ in the number of the premolar and\r\nmolar teeth, is complete.[270-A]\r\n\r\nOn reviewing, therefore, the whole of the osteological evidence, it will be\r\nseen that we have every reason to presume that the _Amphitherium_ and\r\n_Phascolotherium_ of Stonesfield represent both the placental and marsupial\r\nclasses of mammalia; and if so, they warn us in a most emphatic manner, not\r\nto found rash generalizations respecting the non-existence of certain\r\nclasses of animals at particular periods of the past, on mere negative\r\nevidence. The singular accident of our having as yet found nothing but the\r\nlower jaws of seven individuals, and no other bones of their skeletons, is\r\nalone sufficient to demonstrate the fragmentary manner in which the\r\nmemorials of an ancient terrestrial fauna are handed down to us. We can\r\nscarcely avoid suspecting that the two genera above described, may have\r\nborne a like insignificant proportion to the entire assemblage of\r\nwarm-blooded quadrupeds which flourished in the islands of the oolitic sea.\r\n\r\nMr. Owen has remarked that as the marsupial genera, to which the\r\n_Phascolotherium_ is most nearly allied, are now confined to New South\r\nWales and Van Diemen's Land, so also is it in the Australian seas, that we\r\nfind the _Cestracion_, a cartilaginous fish which has a bony palate, allied\r\nto those called _Acrodus_ and _Psammodus_ (see figs. 307, 308. p. 275.), so\r\ncommon in the oolite and lias. In the same Australian seas, also, near the\r\nshore, we find the living _Trigonia_, a genus of mollusca so frequently met\r\nwith in the Stonesfield slate. So, also, the Araucarian pines are now\r\nabundant, together with ferns, in Australia and its islands, as they were\r\nin Europe in the oolitic period. Many botanists incline to the opinion,\r\nthat the _Thuja_, _Pine_, _Cycas_, _Zamia_, in short, all the gymnogens,\r\nbelong to a less highly developed type of flowering plants than do the\r\nexogens; but even if this be admitted, no naturalist can ascribe a low\r\nstandard of organization to the oolitic flora, since we meet with endogens\r\nof the most perfect structure in oolitic rocks, both above and below the\r\nStonesfield slate, as, for example, the _Podocarya_ of Buckland, a fruit\r\nallied to the _Pandanus_, found in the Inferior Oolite (see fig. 294.), and\r\nthe _Carpolithes conica_ of the Coral rag. The doctrine, therefore, of a\r\nregular series of progressive development at successive eras in the animal\r\nand vegetable kingdoms, from beings of a more simple to those of a more\r\ncomplex organization, receives a check, if not a refutation, from the facts\r\nrevealed to us by the study of the Lower Oolites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 294. Portion of a fossil fruit of _Podocarya_\r\nmagnified. (Buckland's Bridgew. Treat. Pl. 63.) Inferior Oolite,\r\nCharmouth, Dorset.]\r\n\r\nThe Stonesfield slate, in its range from Oxfordshire to the north-east,\r\nis represented by flaggy and fissile sandstones, as at Collyweston in\r\nNorthamptonshire, where, according to the researches of Messrs. Ibbetson\r\nand Morris, it contains many shells, such as _Trigonia angulata_, also\r\nfound at Stonesfield. But the Northamptonshire strata of this age assume\r\na more marine character, or appear at least to have been formed farther\r\nfrom land. They inclose, however, some fossil ferns, such as _Pecopteris\r\npolypodioides_, of species common to the oolites of the Yorkshire\r\ncoast[271-A], where rocks of this age put on all the aspect of a true\r\ncoal-field; thin seams of coal having actually been worked in them\r\nfor more than a century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295. _Pterophyllum comptum._ (Syn. _Cycadites\r\ncomptus_.) Upper sandstone and shale, Gristhorpe, near Scarborough.]\r\n\r\nIn the north-west of Yorkshire, the formation alluded to consists of an\r\nupper and a lower carbonaceous shale, abounding in impressions of\r\nplants, divided by a limestone considered by many geologists as the\r\nrepresentative of the Great Oolite; but the scarcity of marine fossils\r\nmakes all comparisons with the subdivisions adopted in the south\r\nextremely difficult. A rich harvest of fossil ferns has been obtained\r\nfrom the upper carbonaceous shales and sandstones at Gristhorpe, near\r\nScarborough (see figs. 295, 296.). The lower shales are well exposed in\r\nthe sea-cliffs at Whitby, and are chiefly characterized by ferns and\r\ncycadeae. They contain, also, a species of calamite, and a fossil called\r\n_Equisetum columnare_, which maintains an upright position in sandstone\r\nstrata over a wide area. Shells of the genus _Cypris_ and _Unio_,\r\ncollected by Mr. Bean from these Yorkshire coal-bearing beds, point to\r\nthe estuary or fluviatile origin of the deposit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296. _Hemitelites Brownii_, Goepp. Syn.\r\n_Phlebopteris contigua_, Lind. & Hutt. Upper carbonaceous strata, Lower\r\nOolite, Gristhorpe, Yorkshire.]\r\n\r\nAt Brora, in Sutherlandshire, a coal formation, probably coeval with the\r\nabove, or belonging to some of the lower divisions of the Oolitic period,\r\nhas been mined extensively for a century or more. It affords the thickest\r\nstratum of pure vegetable matter hitherto detected in any secondary rock in\r\nEngland. One seam of coal of good quality has been worked 3-1/2 feet thick,\r\nand there are several feet more of pyritous coal resting upon it.\r\n\r\n_Inferior Oolite._--Between the Great and Inferior Oolite, near Bath, an\r\nargillaceous deposit called \"the fuller's earth,\" occurs, but is wanting in\r\nthe north of England. The Inferior Oolite is a calcareous freestone,\r\nusually of small thickness, which sometimes rests upon, or is replaced by,\r\nyellow sands, called the sands of the Inferior Oolite. These last, in their\r\nturn, repose upon the lias in the south and west of England.\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristic shells of the Inferior Oolite, I may instance\r\n_Terebratula spinosa_ (fig. 297.), and _Pholadomya fidicula_ (fig. 298.).\r\nThe extinct genus _Pleurotomaria_ is also a form very common in this\r\ndivision as well as in the Oolitic system generally. It resembles the\r\n_Trochus_ in form, but is marked by a singular cleft (_a_, fig. 299.) on\r\nthe right side of the mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297. _Terebratula spinosa._ Inferior Oolite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298.\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Pholadomya fidicula_, 1/3 nat. size.

Inferior Oolite, England.]\r\n\r\nAs illustrations of shells having a great vertical range, I may allude to\r\n_Trigonia clavellata_, found in the Upper and Inferior Oolite, and _T.\r\ncostata_, common to the Upper, Middle, and Lower Oolite; also _Ostrea\r\nMarshii_ (fig. 300.), common to the Cornbrash of Wilts and the Inferior\r\nOolite of Yorkshire; and _Ammonites striatulus_ (fig. 301.) common to the\r\nInferior Oolite and Lias.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300. _Ostrea Marshii._ 1/2 nat. size. Middle\r\nand Lower Oolite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301. _Ammonites striatulus_, Sow. 1/3 nat. size.\r\nInferior Oolite and Lias.]\r\n\r\nSuch facts by no means invalidate the general rule, that certain fossils\r\nare good chronological tests of geological periods; but they serve to\r\ncaution us against attaching too much importance to single species, some\r\nof which may have a wider, others a more confined vertical range. We\r\nhave before seen that, in the successive tertiary formations, there are\r\nspecies common to older and newer groups, yet these groups are\r\ndistinguishable from one another by a comparison of the whole assemblage\r\nof fossil shells proper to each.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[259-A] See Chapters VI. and XIX.\r\n\r\n[261-A] Fitton, Geol.

They pass, indeed, into each other in some places, as near\r\nBath, a sandy marl called the marlstone of the Lias being interposed, and\r\npartaking of the mineral characters of the upper lias and inferior oolite.\r\nThese last-mentioned divisions have also some fossils in common, such as\r\nthe _Avicula inaequivalvis_ (fig. 302.). Nevertheless the Lias may be traced\r\nthroughout a great part of Europe as a separate and independent group, of\r\nconsiderable thickness, varying from 500 to 1000 feet, containing many\r\npeculiar fossils, and having a very uniform lithological aspect. Although\r\nusually conformable to the oolite, it is sometimes, as in the Jura,\r\nunconformable. In the environs of Lons-le-Saulnier, for instance, in the\r\ndepartment of Jura, the strata of lias are inclined at an angle of about\r\n45 deg., while the incumbent oolitic marls are horizontal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302. _Avicula inaequivalvis_, Sow.]\r\n\r\nThe peculiar aspect which is most characteristic of the Lias in England,\r\nFrance, and Germany, is an alternation of thin beds of blue or grey\r\nlimestone with a surface becoming light-brown when weathered, these beds\r\nbeing separated by dark-coloured narrow argillaceous partings, so that\r\nthe quarries of this rock, at a distance, assume a striped and\r\nriband-like appearance.[274-A]\r\n\r\nAlthough the prevailing colour of the limestone of this formation is blue,\r\nyet some beds of the lower lias are of a yellowish white colour, and have\r\nbeen called white lias. In some parts of France, near the Vosges mountains,\r\nand in Luxembourg, M. E. de Beaumont has shown that the lias containing\r\n_Gryphaea arcuata_, _Plagiostoma giganteum_ (see fig. 303.), and other\r\ncharacteristic fossils, becomes arenaceous; and around the Hartz, in\r\nWestphalia and Bavaria, the inferior parts of the lias are sandy, and\r\nsometimes afford a building stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 303. _Plagiostoma giganteum._ Lias.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304. _Gryphaea incurva_, Sow. (_G. arcuata_, Lam.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 305. _Nautilus truncatus._ Lias.]\r\n\r\nThe name of Gryphite limestone has sometimes been applied to the lias, in\r\nconsequence of the great number of shells which it contains of a species of\r\noyster, or _Gryphaea_ (fig. 304., see also fig. 30. p. 29.). Many\r\ncephalopoda, also, such as _Ammonite_, _Belemnite_, and _Nautilus_ (fig.\r\n305.), prove the marine origin of the formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306. Scales of _Lepidotus gigas_, Agas.\r\n\r\n_a._ two of the scales detached.]\r\n\r\nThe fossil fish resemble generically those of the oolite, belonging all,\r\naccording to M. Agassiz, to extinct genera, and differing remarkably from\r\nthe ichthyolites of the Cretaceous period. Among them is a species of\r\n_Lepidotus_ (_L. gigas_, Agas.) (fig. 306.), which is found in the lias of\r\nEngland, France, and Germany.[275-A] This genus was before mentioned (p.\r\n229.) as occurring in the Wealden, and is supposed to have frequented both\r\nrivers and coasts. The teeth of a species of _Acrodus_, also, are very\r\nabundant in the lias (fig. 307.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 307. _Acrodus nobilis_, Agas. (tooth); commonly called\r\nfossil leach. Lias, Lyme Regis, and Germany.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 308. _Hybodus reticulatus_, Agas. Lias, Lyme Regis.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Part of fin, commonly called Ichthyodorulite.\r\n  _b._ Tooth.]\r\n\r\nBut the remains of fish which have excited more attention than any others,\r\nare those large bony spines called _ichthyodorulites_ (_a_, fig. 308.),\r\nwhich were once supposed by some naturalists to be jaws, and by others\r\nweapons, resembling those of the living _Balistes_ and _Silurus_; but which\r\nM. Agassiz has shown to be neither the one nor the other. The spines, in\r\nthe genera last mentioned, articulate with the backbone, whereas there are\r\nno signs of any such articulation in the ichthyodorulites. These last\r\nappear to have been bony spines which formed the anterior part of the\r\ndorsal fin, like that of the living genera _Cestracion_ and _Chimaera_ (see\r\n_a_, fig. 309.). In both of these genera, the posterior concave face is\r\narmed with small spines like that of the fossil _Hybodus_ (fig. 308.), one\r\nof the shark family found fossil at Lyme Regis. Such spines are simply\r\nimbedded in the flesh, and attached to strong muscles. \"They serve,\" says\r\nDr. Buckland, \"as in the _Chimaera_ (fig. 309.), to raise and depress the\r\nfin, their action resembling that of a moveable mast, raising and lowering\r\nbackwards the sail of a barge.\"[276-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309. _Chimaera monstrosa._[276-B]\r\n\r\n_a._ Spine forming anterior part of the dorsal fin.]\r\n\r\n_Reptiles of the Lias._--It is not, however, the fossil fish which form the\r\nmost striking feature in the organic remains of the Lias; but the reptiles,\r\nwhich are extraordinary for their number, size, and structure. Among the\r\nmost singular of these are several species of _Ichthyosaurus_ and\r\n_Plesiosaurus_. The genus _Ichthyosaurus_, or fish-lizard, is not confined\r\nto this formation, but has been found in strata as high as the chalk-marl\r\nand gault of England, and as low as the muschelkalk of Germany, a formation\r\nwhich immediately succeeds the lias in the descending order.[276-C] It is\r\nevident from their fish-like vertebrae, their paddles, resembling those of a\r\nporpoise or whale, the length of their tail, and other parts of their\r\nstructure, that the habits of the Ichthyosaurs were aquatic. Their jaws and\r\nteeth show that they were carnivorous; and the half-digested remains of\r\nfishes and reptiles, found within their skeletons, indicate the precise\r\nnature of their food.[276-D]\r\n\r\nA specimen of the hinder fin or paddle of _Ichthyosaurus communis_ was\r\ndiscovered in 1840 at Barrow-on-Soar, by Sir P. Egerton, which\r\ndistinctly exhibits on its posterior margin the remains of cartilaginous\r\nrays that bifurcate as they approach the edge, like those in the fin of\r\na fish (see _a_, fig. 312.). It had previously been supposed, says Mr.\r\nOwen, that the locomotive organs of the Ichthyosaurus were enveloped,\r\nwhile living, in a smooth integument, like that of the turtle and\r\nporpoise, which has no other support than is afforded by the bones and\r\nligaments within; but it now appears that the fin was much larger,\r\nexpanding far beyond its osseous framework, and deviating widely in its\r\nfish-like rays from the ordinary reptilian type. In fig. 312. the\r\nposterior bones, or digital ossicles of the paddle, are seen near _b_;\r\nand beyond these is the dark carbonized integument of the terminal half\r\nof the fin, the outline of which is beautifully defined.[277-A] Mr. Owen\r\nbelieves that, besides the fore-paddles, these short-and stiff-necked\r\nsaurians were furnished with a tail-fin without bones and purely\r\ntegumentary, expanding in a vertical direction; an organ of motion which\r\nenabled them to turn their heads rapidly.[277-B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310. _Ichthyosaurus communis_, restored by\r\nConybeare and Cuvier.\r\n\r\n_a._ costal vertebrae.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311. _Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus_, restored by\r\nRev. W. D. Conybeare.\r\n\r\n_a._ cervical vertebra.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 312. Posterior part of hind fin or paddle of\r\n_Ichthyosaurus communis_.]\r\n\r\nMr. Conybeare was enabled, in 1824, after examining many skeletons nearly\r\nperfect, to give an ideal restoration of the osteology of this genus, and\r\nof that of the _Plesiosaurus_.[278-A] (See figs. 310, 311.) The latter\r\nanimal had an extremely long neck and small head, with teeth like those of\r\nthe crocodile, and paddles analogous to those of the _Ichthyosaurus_, but\r\nlarger. It is supposed to have lived in shallow seas and estuaries, and to\r\nhave breathed air like the Ichthyosaur, and our modern cetacea.[278-B] Some\r\nof the reptiles above mentioned were of formidable dimensions. One specimen\r\nof _Ichthyosaurus platyodon_, from the lias at Lyme, now in the British\r\nMuseum, must have belonged to an animal more than 24 feet in length; and\r\nanother of the _Plesiosaurus_, in the same collection, is 11 feet long. The\r\nform of the _Ichthyosaurus_ may have fitted it to cut through the waves\r\nlike the porpoise; but it is supposed that the _Plesiosaurus_, at least the\r\nlong-necked species (fig. 311.), was better suited to fish in shallow\r\ncreeks and bays defended from heavy breakers.\r\n\r\nIn many specimens both of Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur the bones of the head,\r\nneck, and tail, are in their natural position, while those of the rest of\r\nthe skeleton are detached and in confusion. Mr. Stutchburg has suggested\r\nthat their bodies after death became inflated with gases, and, while the\r\nabdominal viscera were decomposing, the bones, though disunited, were\r\nretained within the tough dermal covering as in a bag, until the whole,\r\nbecoming water-logged, sank to the bottom.[278-C] As they belonged to\r\nindividuals of all ages they are supposed, by Dr. Buckland, to have\r\nexperienced a violent death; and the same conclusion might also be drawn\r\nfrom their having escaped the attacks of their own predaceous race, or of\r\nfishes, found fossil in the same beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 313. _Amblyrhynchus cristatus_, Bell. Length varying\r\nfrom 3 to 4 feet. The only existing marine lizard now known.\r\n\r\n_a._ Tooth, natural size and magnified.]\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty years, anatomists have agreed that these extinct\r\nsaurians must have inhabited the sea; and it was argued that, as there\r\nare now chelonians, like the tortoise, living in fresh water, and\r\nothers, as the turtle, frequenting the ocean, so there may have been\r\nformerly some saurians proper to salt, others to fresh water. The common\r\ncrocodile of the Ganges is well known to frequent equally that river and\r\nthe brackish and salt water near its mouth; and crocodiles are said in\r\nlike manner to be abundant both in the rivers of the Isla de Pinos (or\r\nIsle of Pines), south of Cuba, and in the open sea round the coast. More\r\nrecently a saurian has been discovered of aquatic habits and exclusively\r\nmarine. This creature was found in the Galapagos Islands, during the\r\nvisit of H. M. S. Beagle to that archipelago, in 1835, and its habits\r\nwere then observed by Mr. Darwin. The islands alluded to are situated\r\nunder the equator, nearly 600 miles to the westward of the coast of\r\nSouth America. They are volcanic, some of them being 3000 or 4000 feet\r\nhigh; and one of them, Albemarle Island, 75 miles long. The climate is\r\nmild; very little rain falls; and, in the whole archipelago, there is\r\nonly one rill of fresh water that reaches the coast. The soil is for the\r\nmost part dry and harsh, and the vegetation scanty. The birds, reptiles,\r\nplants, and insects are, with very few exceptions, of species found no\r\nwhere else in the world, although all partake, in their general form, of\r\na South American type. Of the mammalia, says Mr. Darwin, one species\r\nalone appears to be indigenous, namely, a large and peculiar kind of\r\nmouse; but the number of lizards, tortoises, and snakes is so great,\r\nthat it may be called a land of reptiles. The variety, indeed, of\r\nspecies is small; but the individuals of each are in wonderful\r\nabundance. There is a turtle, a large tortoise (_Testudo Indicus_), four\r\nlizards, and about the same number of snakes, but no frogs or toads. Two\r\nof the lizards belong to the family _Iguanidae_ of Bell, and to a\r\npeculiar genus (_Amblyrhynchus_) established by that naturalist, and so\r\nnamed from their obtusely truncated head and short snout.[279-A] Of\r\nthese lizards one is terrestrial in its habits, and burrows in the\r\nground, swarming everywhere on the land, having a round tail, and a\r\nmouth somewhat resembling in form that of the tortoise. The other is\r\naquatic, and has its tail flattened laterally for swimming (see fig.\r\n313.). \"This marine saurian,\" says Mr. Darwin, \"is extremely common on\r\nall the islands throughout the archipelago. It lives exclusively on the\r\nrocky sea-beaches, and I never saw one even ten yards inshore. The usual\r\nlength is about a yard, but there are some even 4 feet long. It is of a\r\ndirty black colour, sluggish in its movements on the land; but, when in\r\nthe water, it swims with perfect ease and quickness by a serpentine\r\nmovement of its body and flattened tail, the legs during this time being\r\nmotionless, and closely collapsed on its sides. Their limbs and strong\r\nclaws are admirably adapted for crawling over the rugged and fissured\r\nmasses of lava which everywhere form the coast. In such situations, a\r\ngroup of six or seven of these hideous reptiles may oftentimes be seen\r\non the black rocks, a few feet above the surf, basking in the sun with\r\noutstretched legs. Their stomachs, on being opened, were found to be\r\nlargely distended with minced sea-weed, of a kind which grows at the\r\nbottom of the sea at some little distance from the coast. To obtain\r\nthis, the lizards go out to sea in shoals. One of these animals was sunk\r\nin salt water, from the ship, with a heavy weight attached to it, and\r\non being drawn up again after an hour it was quite active and unharmed.\r\nIt is not yet known by the inhabitants where this animal lays its eggs;\r\na singular fact, considering its abundance, and that the natives are\r\nwell acquainted with the eggs of the terrestrial _Amblyrhynchus_,\r\nwhich is also herbivorous.\"[280-A]\r\n\r\nIn those deposits now forming by the sediment washed away from the\r\nwasting shores of the Galapagos Islands the remains of saurians, both of\r\nthe land and sea, as well as of chelonians and fish, may be mingled with\r\nmarine shells, without any bones of land quadrupeds or batrachian\r\nreptiles; yet even here we should expect the remains of marine mammalia\r\nto be imbedded in the new strata, for there are seals, besides several\r\nkinds of cetacea, on the Galapagian shores; and, in this respect, the\r\nparallel between the modern fauna, above described, and the ancient one\r\nof the lias, would not hold good.\r\n\r\n_Sudden destruction of saurians._--It has been remarked, and truly, that\r\nmany of the fish and saurians, found fossil in the lias, must have met with\r\nsudden death and immediate burial; and that the destructive operation,\r\nwhatever may have been its nature, was often repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes,\" says Dr. Buckland, \"scarcely a single bone or scale has been\r\nremoved from the place it occupied during life; which could not have\r\nhappened had the uncovered bodies of these saurians been left, even for a\r\nfew hours, exposed to putrefaction, and to the attacks of fishes, and other\r\nsmaller animals at the bottom of the sea.\"[280-B] Not only are the\r\nskeletons of the Ichthyosaurs entire, but sometimes the contents of their\r\nstomachs still remain between their ribs, as before remarked, so that we\r\ncan discover the particular species of fish on which they lived, and the\r\nform of their excrements. Not unfrequently there are layers of these\r\ncoprolites, at different depths in the lias, at a distance from any entire\r\nskeletons of the marine lizards from which they were derived; \"as if,\" says\r\nSir H. De la Beche, \"the muddy bottom of the sea received small sudden\r\naccessions of matter from time to time, covering up the coprolites and\r\nother exuviae which had accumulated during the intervals.\"[281-A] It is\r\nfarther stated that, at Lyme Regis, those surfaces only of the coprolites\r\nwhich lay uppermost at the bottom of the sea have suffered partial decay,\r\nfrom the action of water before they were covered and protected by the\r\nmuddy sediment that has afterwards permanently enveloped them.[281-B]\r\n\r\nNumerous specimens of the pen-and-ink fish (_Sepia loligo_, Lin.; _Loligo\r\nvulgaris_, Lam.) have also been met with in the lias at Lyme, with the\r\nink-bags still distended, containing the ink in a dried state, chiefly\r\ncomposed of carbon, and but slightly impregnated with carbonate of lime.\r\nThese cephalopoda, therefore, must, like the saurians, have been soon\r\nburied in sediment; for, if long exposed after death, the membrane\r\ncontaining the ink would have decayed.[281-C]\r\n\r\nAs we know that river fish are sometimes stifled, even in their own\r\nelement, by muddy water during floods, it cannot be doubted that the\r\nperiodical discharge of large bodies of turbid fresh water into the sea may\r\nbe still more fatal to marine tribes. In the Principles of Geology I have\r\nshown that large quantities of mud and drowned animals have been swept down\r\ninto the sea by rivers during earthquakes, as in Java, in 1699; and that\r\nundescribable multitudes of dead fishes have been seen floating on the sea\r\nafter a discharge of noxious vapours during similar convulsions.[281-D]\r\nBut, in the intervals between such catastrophes, strata may have\r\naccumulated slowly in the sea of the lias, some being formed chiefly of one\r\ndescription of shell, such as ammonites, others of gryphites.\r\n\r\nFrom the above remarks the reader will infer that the lias is for the most\r\npart a marine deposit. Some members, however, of the series, especially in\r\nthe lowest part of it, have an estuary character, and must have been formed\r\nwithin the influence of rivers. In Gloucestershire, where there is a good\r\ntype of the lias of the West of England, it may be divided into an upper\r\nmass of shale with a base of marlstone, and a lower series of shales with\r\nunderlying limestones and shales. We learn from the researches of the Rev.\r\nP. B. Brodie[281-E], that in the superior of these two divisions numerous\r\nremains of insects and plants have been detected in several places, mingled\r\nwith marine shells; but in the inferior division similar fossils are still\r\nmore plentiful. One band, rarely exceeding a foot in thickness, has been\r\nnamed the \"insect limestone.\" It passes upwards into a shale containing\r\n_Cypris_ and _Estheria_, and is charged with the wing-cases of several\r\ngenera of coleoptera, and with some nearly entire beetles, of which the\r\neyes are preserved. The nervures of the wings of neuropterous insects\r\n(fig. 314.) are beautifully perfect in this bed. Ferns, with leaves of\r\nmonocotyledonous plants, and freshwater shells, such as _Cyclas_ and\r\n_Unio_, accompany the insects in some places, while in others marine shells\r\npredominate, the fossils varying apparently as we examine the bed nearer or\r\nfarther from the ancient land, or the source whence the fresh water was\r\nderived. There are two, or even three, bands of \"insect limestone\" in\r\nseveral sections, and they have been ascertained by Mr. Brodie to retain\r\nthe same lithological and zoological characters when traced from the centre\r\nof Warwickshire to the borders of the southern part of Wales. After\r\nstudying 300 specimens of these insects from the lias, Mr. Westwood\r\ndeclares that they comprise both wood-eating and herb-devouring beetles of\r\nthe Linnean genera _Elater_, _Carabus_, &c., besides grasshoppers\r\n(_Gryllus_), and detached wings of dragon-flies and may-flies, or insects\r\nreferable to the Linnean genera _Libellula_, _Ephemera_, _Hemerobius_, and\r\n_Panorpa_, in all belonging to no less than twenty-four families. The size\r\nof the species is usually small, and such as taken alone would imply a\r\ntemperate climate; but many of the associated organic remains of other\r\nclasses must lead to a different conclusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314. Wing of a neuropterous insect, from the Lower\r\nLias, Gloucestershire. (Rev. B. Brodie.)]\r\n\r\n_Fossil plants._--Among the vegetable remains of the Lias, several species\r\nof _Zamia_ have been found at Lyme Regis, and the remains of coniferous\r\nplants at Whitby. Fragments of wood are common, and often converted into\r\nlimestone. That some of this wood, though now petrified, was soft when it\r\nfirst lay at the bottom of the sea, is shown by a specimen now in the\r\nmuseum of the Geological Society (see fig. 315.), which has the form of an\r\n_ammonite_ indented on its surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315. Petrified wood.]\r\n\r\nM. Ad. Brongniart enumerates forty-seven liassic acrogens, most of them\r\nferns; and fifty gymnogens, of which thirty-nine are cycads, and eleven\r\nconifers. Among the cycads the predominance of _Zamites_ and _Nilsonia_,\r\nand among the ferns the numerous genera with leaves having reticulated\r\nveins (as in fig. 296. p. 272.), are mentioned as botanical\r\ncharacteristics of this era.[282-A]\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Oolite and Lias._--If we now endeavour to restore, in\r\nimagination, the ancient condition of the European area at the period of\r\nthe Oolite and Lias, we must conceive a sea in which the growth of coral\r\nreefs and shelly limestones, after proceeding without interruption for\r\nages, was liable to be stopped suddenly by the deposition of clayey\r\nsediment. Then, again, the argillaceous matter, devoid of corals, was\r\ndeposited for ages, and attained a thickness of hundreds of feet, until\r\nanother period arrived when the same space was again occupied by\r\ncalcareous sand, or solid rocks of shell and coral, to be again succeeded\r\nby the recurrence of another period of argillaceous deposition. Mr.\r\nConybeare has remarked of the entire group of Oolite and Lias, that it\r\nconsists of repeated alternations of clay, sandstone, and limestone,\r\nfollowing each other in the same order. Thus the clays of the lias are\r\nfollowed by the sands of the inferior oolite, and these again by shelly and\r\ncoralline limestone (Bath oolite, &c.); so, in the middle oolite, the\r\nOxford clay is followed by calcareous grit and \"coral rag;\" lastly, in the\r\nupper oolite, the Kimmeridge clay is followed by the Portland sand and\r\nlimestone.[283-A] The clay beds, however, as Sir H. De la Beche remarks,\r\ncan be followed over larger areas than the sands or sandstones.[283-B] It\r\nshould also be remembered that while the oolitic system becomes arenaceous,\r\nand resembles a coal-field in Yorkshire, it assumes, in the Alps, an almost\r\npurely calcareous form, the sands and clays being omitted; and even in the\r\nintervening tracts, it is more complicated and variable than appears in\r\nordinary descriptions. Nevertheless, some of the clays and intervening\r\nlimestones do, in reality, retain a pretty uniform character, for distances\r\nof from 400 to 600 miles from east to west and north to south.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Thirria, the entire oolitic group in the department of the\r\nHaute-Saone, in France, may be equal in thickness to that of England; but\r\nthe importance of the argillaceous divisions is in the inverse ratio to\r\nthat which they exhibit in England, where they are about equal to twice the\r\nthickness of the limestones, whereas, in the part of France alluded to,\r\nthey reach only about a third of that thickness.[283-C] In the Jura the\r\nclays are still thinner; and in the Alps they thin out and almost vanish.\r\n\r\nIn order to account for such a succession of events, we may imagine,\r\nfirst, the bed of the ocean to be the receptacle for ages of fine\r\nargillaceous sediment, brought by oceanic currents, which may have\r\ncommunicated with rivers, or with part of the sea near a wasting coast.\r\nThis mud ceases, at length, to be conveyed to the same region, either\r\nbecause the land which had previously suffered denudation is depressed\r\nand submerged, or because the current is deflected in another direction\r\nby the altered shape of the bed of the ocean and neighbouring dry land.\r\nBy such changes the water becomes once more clear and fit for the growth\r\nof stony zoophytes. Calcareous sand is then formed from comminuted shell\r\nand coral, or, in some cases, arenaceous matter replaces the clay;\r\nbecause it commonly happens that the finer sediment, being first drifted\r\nfarthest from coasts, is subsequently overspread by coarse sand, after\r\nthe sea has grown shallower, or when the land, increasing in extent,\r\nwhether by upheaval or by sediment filling up parts of the sea, has\r\napproached nearer to the spots first occupied by fine mud.\r\n\r\nIn order to account for another great formation, like the Oxford clay,\r\nagain covering one of coral limestone, we must suppose a sinking down\r\nlike that which is now taking place in some existing regions of coral\r\nbetween Australia and South America. The occurrence of subsidences, on\r\nso vast a scale, may have caused the bed of the ocean and the adjoining\r\nland, throughout great parts of the European area, to assume a shape\r\nfavourable to the deposition of another set of clayey strata; and this\r\nchange may have been succeeded by a series of events analogous to that\r\nalready explained, and these again by a third series in similar order.\r\nBoth the ascending and descending movements may have been extremely\r\nslow, like those now going on in the Pacific; and the growth of every\r\nstratum of coral, a few feet of thickness, may have required centuries\r\nfor its completion, during which certain species of organic beings\r\ndisappeared from the earth, and others were introduced in their place;\r\nso that, in each set of strata, from the Upper Oolite to the Lias, some\r\npeculiar and characteristic fossils were embedded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oolite and Lias of the United States._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 316. Section showing the geological position of the\r\nJames River, or East Virginian Coal-field.\r\n\r\n  A. Granite, gneiss, &c.\r\n  B. Coal-measures.\r\n  C. Tertiary strata.\r\n  D. Drift or _ancient alluvium_.]\r\n\r\nThere are large tracts on the globe, as in Russia and the United States,\r\nwhere all the members of the oolitic series are unrepresented. In the state\r\nof Virginia, however, at the distance of about 13 miles eastward of\r\nRichmond, the capital of that State, there is a regular coal-field\r\noccurring in a depression of the granite rocks (see section, fig. 316.),\r\nwhich Professor W. B. Rogers first correctly referred to the age of the\r\nlower part of the Jurassic group. This opinion I was enabled to confirm\r\nafter collecting a large number of fossil plants, fish, and shells, and\r\nexamining the coal-field throughout its whole area. It extends 26 miles\r\nfrom north to south, and from 4 to 12, from east to west. The plants\r\nconsist chiefly of zamites, calamites, and equisetums, and these last are\r\nvery commonly met with in a vertical position more or less compressed\r\nperpendicularly. It is clear that they grew in the places where they now\r\nlie buried in strata of hardened sand and mud. I found them maintaining\r\ntheir erect attitude, at points many miles distant from others, in beds\r\nboth above and between the seams of coal. In order to explain this fact we\r\nmust suppose such shales and sandstones to have been gradually accumulated\r\nduring the slow and repeated subsidence of the whole region.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the _Equisetum columnare_ of these Virginian\r\nrocks appears to be undistinguishable from the species found in the\r\noolitic sandstones near Whitby in Yorkshire, where it also is met with\r\nin an upright position. One of the American ferns, _Pecopteris\r\nWhitbyensis_, is also a species common to the Yorkshire oolites.[285-A]\r\nThese Virginian coal-measures are composed of grits, sandstones, and\r\nshales, exactly resembling those of older or primary date in America and\r\nEurope, and they rival or even surpass the latter in the richness and\r\nthickness of the seams. One of these, the main seam, is in some places\r\nfrom 30 to 40 feet thick, composed of pure bituminous coal. On\r\ndescending a shaft 800 feet deep, in the Blackheath mines in\r\nChesterfield county, I found myself in a chamber more than 40 feet high,\r\ncaused by the removal of this coal. Timber props of great strength\r\nsupported the roof, but they were seen to bend under the incumbent\r\nweight. The coal is like the finest kinds shipped at Newcastle, and when\r\nanalysed yields the same proportions of carbon and hydrogen, a fact\r\nworthy of notice when we consider that this fuel has been derived from\r\nan assemblage of plants very distinct specifically, and in part\r\ngenerically, from those which have contributed to the formation of\r\nthe ancient or paleozoic coal.\r\n\r\nThe fossil fish of these Richmond strata belong to the liassic genus\r\n_Tetragonolepis_, and to a new genus which I have called _Dictyopyge_.\r\nShells are very rare, as usually in all coal-bearing deposits, but a\r\nspecies of _Posidonomya_ is in such profusion in some shaley beds as to\r\ndivide them like the plates of mica in micaceous shales (see fig. 317.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 317. Oolitic coal-shale, Richmond, Virginia.\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Posidonomya._\r\n  _b._ young of same.]\r\n\r\nIn India, especially in Cutch, a formation occurs clearly referable to the\r\noolitic and liassic type, as shown by the shells, corals, and plants; and\r\nthere also coal has been procured from one member of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[274-A] Conyb. and Phil. p. 261.\r\n\r\n[275-A] Agassiz, Pois.

Cross section.\r\n\r\n  _a._ New red sandstone.\r\n  _b._ Coal.\r\n  _c._ Old red.]\r\n\r\nThe name of \"Red Marl\" has been incorrectly applied to the red clays of\r\nthis formation, as before explained (p. 13.), for they are remarkably free\r\nfrom calcareous matter. The absence, indeed, of carbonate of lime, as well\r\nas the scarcity of organic remains, together with the bright red colour of\r\nmost of the rocks of this group, causes a strong contrast between it and\r\nthe Jurassic formations before described.\r\n\r\nBefore the distinctness of the fossil remains characterizing the upper and\r\nlower part of the English New Red had been clearly recognized, it was found\r\nconvenient to have a common name for all the strata intermediate in\r\nposition between the Lias and Coal; and the term \"Poikilitic\" was proposed\r\nby Messrs. Conybeare and Buckland[286-A], from +poikilos+, poikilos,\r\n_variegated_, some of the most characteristic strata of this group having\r\nbeen called _variegated_ by Werner, from their exhibiting spots and streaks\r\nof light-blue, green, and buff colour, in a red base.\r\n\r\nA single term, thus comprehending both Upper and Lower New Red, or the\r\nTriassic and Permian groups of modern classifications, may still be useful\r\nin describing districts where we have to speak of masses of red sandstone\r\nand shale, referable, in part, to both these eras, but which, in the\r\nabsence of fossils, it is impossible to divide.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trias or Upper New Red Sandstone Group._\r\n\r\nThe accompanying table will explain the subdivisions generally adopted for\r\nthe uppermost of the two systems above alluded to, and the names given to\r\nthem in England and on the Continent.\r\n\r\n                                                       Synonyms.\r\n                                                  German.

It has been called the Trias by German writers, or the Triple\r\nGroup, because it is separable into three distinct formations, called the\r\n\"Keuper,\" the \"Muschelkalk,\" and the \"Bunter-sandstein.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 319. _Equisetites columnaris._ (Syn. _Equisetum\r\ncolumnare_.) Fragment of stem, and small portion of same\r\nmagnified. Keuper.]\r\n\r\n_The Keuper_, the first or newest of these, is 1000 feet thick in\r\nWuertemberg, and is divided by Alberti into sandstone, gypsum, and\r\ncarbonaceous slate-clay.[287-A] Remains of Reptiles, called _Nothosaurus_\r\nand _Phytosaurus_, have been found in it with _Labyrinthodon_; the detached\r\nteeth, also, of placoid fish and of rays, and of the genera _Saurichthys_\r\nand _Gyrolepis_ (figs. 325, 326, p. 289.). The plants of the Keuper are\r\ngenerically very analogous to those of the lias and oolite, consisting of\r\nferns, equisetaceous plants, cycads, and conifers, with a few doubtful\r\nmonocotyledons. A few species, such as _Equisetites columnaris_, are common\r\nto this group, and the oolite.\r\n\r\n_The Muschelkalk_ consists chiefly of a compact, greyish limestone, but\r\nincludes beds of dolomite in many places, together with gypsum and\r\nrock-salt. This limestone, a rock wholly unrepresented in England, abounds\r\nin fossil shells, as the name implies. Among the cephalopoda there are no\r\nbelemnites, and no ammonites with foliated sutures, as in the incumbent\r\nlias and oolite, but a genus allied to the Ammonite, called _Ceratite_ by\r\nDe Haan, in which the descending lobes (see _a_, _b_, _c_, fig. 320.)\r\nterminate in a few small denticulations pointing inwards. Among the\r\nbivalve shells, the _Posidonia minuta_, Goldf. (_Posidonomya minuta_,\r\nBronn) (see fig. 321.), is abundant, ranging through the Keuper,\r\nMuschelkalk, and Bunter-sandstein; and _Avicula socialis_, fig. 322.,\r\nhaving a similar range, is very characteristic of the Muschelkalk in\r\nGermany, France, and Poland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 320. _Ceratites nodosus._ Muschelkalk.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Side view.\r\n  _b._ Front view.\r\n  _c._ Partially denticulated outline of the septa dividing the chambers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 321. _Posidonia minuta_, Goldf.

Characteristic of the Muschelkalk.\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Avicula socialis._\r\n  _b._ Side view of same.]\r\n\r\nThe abundance of the heads and stems of lily encrinites, _Encrinus\r\nliliiformis_ (or _Encrinites moniliformis_), show the slow manner in which\r\nsome beds of this limestone have been formed in clear sea-water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 323. Voltzia. Bunter-sandstein.\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Voltzia heterophylla._ (Syn. _Voltzia brevifolia_.)\r\n  _b._  portion of same magnified to show fructification. Sulzbad.]\r\n\r\n_The Bunter-sandstein_ consists of various coloured sandstones,\r\ndolomites, and red-clays, with some beds, especially in the Hartz, of\r\ncalcareous pisolite or roe-stone, the whole sometimes attaining a\r\nthickness of more than 1000 feet. The sandstone of the Vosges, according\r\nto Von Meyer, is proved, by the presence of _Labyrinthodon_, to belong\r\nto this lowest member of the Triassic group. At Sulzbad (or\r\nSoultz-les-bains), near Strasburg, on the flanks of the Vosges, many\r\nplants have been obtained from the \"bunter,\" especially conifers of the\r\nextinct genus _Voltzia_, peculiar to this period, in which even the\r\nfructification has been preserved. (See fig. 323.)\r\n\r\nOut of thirty species of ferns, cycads, conifers, and other plants,\r\nenumerated by M. Ad. Brongniart, in 1849, as coming from the \"gres\r\nbigarre,\" or Bunter, not one is common to the Keuper.[288-A]\r\n\r\nThe footprints of a reptile (_Labyrinthodon_) have been observed on the\r\nclays of this member of the Trias, near Hildburghausen, in Saxony,\r\nimpressed on the upper surface of the beds, and standing out as casts in\r\nrelief from the under sides of incumbent slabs of sandstone. To these I\r\nshall again allude in the sequel; they attest, as well as the accompanying\r\nripple-marks, and the cracks which traverse the clays, the gradual\r\nformation in shallow water, and sometimes between high and low water, of\r\nthe beds of this formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Triassic group in England._\r\n\r\nIn England the Lias is succeeded by conformable strata of red and green\r\nmarl, or clay. There intervenes, however, both in the neighbourhood of\r\nAxmouth, in Devonshire, and in the cliffs of Westbury and Aust, in\r\nGloucestershire, on the banks of the Severn, a dark-coloured stratum, well\r\nknown by the name of the \"bone-bed.\" It abounds in the remains of saurians\r\nand fish, and was formerly classed as the lowest bed of the Lias; but Sir\r\nP. Egerton has shown that it should be referred to the Upper New Red\r\nSandstone, for it contains an assemblage of fossil fish which are either\r\npeculiar to this stratum, or belong to species well known in the\r\nMuschelkalk of Germany. These fish belong to the genera _Acrodus_,\r\n_Hybodus_, _Gyrolepis_, and _Saurichthys_.\r\n\r\nAmong those common to the English bone-bed and the Muschelkalk of Germany\r\nare _Hybodus plicatilis_ (fig. 324.), _Saurichthys apicalis_ (fig. 325.),\r\n_Gyrolepis tenuistriatus_ (fig. 326.), and _G. Albertii_. Remains of\r\nsaurians have also been found in the bone-bed, and plates of an _Encrinus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 324. _Hybodus plicatilis._ Teeth. Bone-bed,\r\nAust and Axmouth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 325. _Saurichthys apicalis._ Tooth; nat. size,\r\nand magnified. Axmouth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 326. _Gyrolepis tenuistriatus._ Scale; nat. size,\r\nand magnified. Axmouth.]\r\n\r\nThe strata of red and green marl, which follow the bone-bed in the\r\ndescending order at Axmouth and Aust, are destitute of organic remains;\r\nas is the case, for the most part, in the corresponding beds in almost\r\nevery part of England. But fossils have lately been found at a few\r\nlocalities in sandstones of this formation, in Worcestershire and\r\nWarwickshire, and among them the bivalve shell called _Posidonia\r\nminuta_, Goldf., before mentioned (fig. 321. p. 288.).\r\n\r\nThe upper member of the English \"New Red\" containing this shell, in\r\nthose parts of England, is, according to Messrs. Murchison and\r\nStrickland, 600 feet thick, and consists chiefly of red marl or\r\nslate, with a band of sandstone. Spines of _Hybodus_, called\r\n_ichthyodorulites_, teeth of fishes, and footprints of reptiles, with\r\nremains of a saurian called _Rhyncosaurus_, were observed by the same\r\ngeologists in these strata.[290-A]\r\n\r\nIn Cheshire and Lancashire the gypseous and saliferous red shales and loams\r\nof the Trias are between 1000 and 1500 feet thick. In some places\r\nlenticular masses of rock-salt are interpolated between the argillaceous\r\nbeds, the origin of which will be spoken of in the sequel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 327. Single footstep of _Chirotherium_. Bunter\r\nSandstein, Saxony; one eighth of nat. size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 328. Line of footsteps on slab of sandstone.\r\nHildburghausen, in Saxony.]\r\n\r\nThe lower division or English representative of the \"Bunter\" attains a\r\nthickness of 600 feet in the counties last mentioned. Besides red and green\r\nshales and red sandstones, it comprises much soft white quartzose\r\nsandstone, in which the trunks of silicified trees have been met with at\r\nAllesley Hill, near Coventry. Several of them were a foot and a half in\r\ndiameter, and some yards in length, decidedly of coniferous wood, and\r\nshowing rings of annual growth.[290-B] Impressions, also, of the footsteps\r\nof animals have been detected in Lancashire and Cheshire in this formation.\r\nSome of the most remarkable occur a few miles from Liverpool, in the\r\nwhitish quartzose sandstone of Storton Hill, on the west side of the\r\nMersey. They bear a close resemblance to tracks first observed in a member\r\nof the Upper New Red Sandstone, at the village of Hesseberg, near\r\nHildburghausen, in Saxony, to which I have already alluded. For many years\r\nthese footprints have been referred to a large unknown quadruped,\r\nprovisionally named _Chirotherium_ by Professor Kaup, because the marks\r\nboth of the fore and hind feet resembled impressions made by a human hand.\r\n(See fig. 327.) The footmarks at Hesseberg are partly concave and partly in\r\nrelief; the former, or the depressions, are seen upon the upper surface of\r\nthe sandstone slabs, but those in relief are only upon the lower surfaces,\r\nbeing in fact natural casts, formed in the subjacent footprints as in\r\nmoulds. The larger impressions, which seem to be those of the hind foot,\r\nare generally 8 inches in length, and 5 in width, and one was 12 inches\r\nlong. Near each large footstep, and at a regular distance (about an inch\r\nand a half), before it, a smaller print of a fore foot, 4 inches long and\r\n3 inches wide, occurs. The footsteps follow each other in pairs, each pair\r\nin the same line, at intervals of 14 inches from pair to pair. The large as\r\nwell as the small steps show the great toes alternately on the right and\r\nleft side; each step makes the print of five toes, the first or great toe\r\nbeing bent inwards like a thumb. Though the fore and hind foot differ so\r\nmuch in size, they are nearly similar in form.\r\n\r\nThe similar footmarks afterwards observed in a rock of corresponding age at\r\nStorton Hill, were imprinted on five thin beds of clay, superimposed one\r\nupon the other in the same quarry, and separated by beds of sandstone. On\r\nthe lower surface of the sandstone strata, the solid casts of each\r\nimpression are salient, in high relief, and afford models of the feet,\r\ntoes, and claws of the animals which trod on the clay.\r\n\r\nAs neither in Germany nor in England any bones or teeth had been met with\r\nin the same identical strata as the footsteps, anatomists indulged, for\r\nseveral years, in various conjectures respecting the mysterious animals\r\nfrom which they might have been derived. Professor Kaup suggested that the\r\nunknown quadruped might have been allied to the _Marsupialia_; for in the\r\nkangaroo the first toe of the fore foot is in a similar manner set\r\nobliquely to the others, like a thumb, and the disproportion between the\r\nfore and hind feet is also very great. But M. Link conceived that some of\r\nthe four species of animals of which the tracks had been found in Saxony\r\nmight have been gigantic _Batrachians_; and Dr. Buckland designated some of\r\nthe footsteps as those of a small web-footed animal, probably crocodilean.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these discussions several naturalists of Liverpool, in\r\ntheir report on the Storton quarries, declared their opinion that each of\r\nthe thin seams of clay in which the sandstone casts were moulded had formed\r\nsuccessively a surface above water, over which the _Chirotherium_ and other\r\nanimals walked, leaving impressions of their footsteps, and that each layer\r\nhad been afterwards submerged by a sinking down of the surface, so that a\r\nnew beach was formed at low water above the former, on which other tracks\r\nwere then made. The repeated occurrence of ripple-marks at various heights\r\nand depths in the red sandstone of Cheshire had been explained in the same\r\nmanner. It was also remarked that impressions of such depth and clearness\r\ncould only have been made by animals walking on the land, as their weight\r\nwould have been insufficient to make them sink so deeply in yielding clay\r\nunder water. They must therefore have been air-breathers.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquiry had been brought to this point, the reptilian remains\r\ndiscovered in the Trias, both of Germany and England, were carefully\r\nexamined by Mr. Owen. He found, after a microscopic investigation of the\r\nteeth from the German sandstone called Keuper, and from the sandstone of\r\nWarwick and Leamington, that neither of them could be referred to true\r\nsaurians, although they had been named _Mastodonsaurus_ and _Phytosaurus_\r\nby Jaeger (fig. 329.). It appeared that they were of the _Batrachian_ order,\r\nand attested the former existence of frogs of gigantic dimensions in\r\ncomparison with any now living. Both the Continental and English fossil\r\nteeth exhibited a most complicated texture, differing from that previously\r\nobserved in any reptile, whether recent or extinct, but most nearly\r\nanalogous to the _Ichthyosaurus_. A section of one of these teeth exhibits\r\na series of irregular folds, resembling the labyrinthic windings of the\r\nsurface of the brain; and from this character Mr. Owen has proposed the\r\nname _Labyrinthodon_ for the new genus. By his permission, the annexed\r\nrepresentation (fig. 330.) of part of one is given from his \"Odontography,\"\r\nplate 64. A. The entire length of this tooth is supposed to have been about\r\nthree inches and a half, and the breadth at the base one inch and a half.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 329. Tooth of _Labyrinthodon_; nat. size.\r\nWarwick sandstone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 330. Transverse section of tooth of _Labyrinthodon\r\nJaegeri_, Owen (_Mastodonsaurus Jaegeri_, Meyer); nat. size, and\r\na segment magnified.\r\n\r\n_a._ Pulp cavity, from which the processes of pulp and dentine radiate.]\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Owen had satisfied himself, from an inspection of the cranium,\r\njaws, and teeth, that a gigantic _Batrachian_ had existed at the period of\r\nthe Trias or Upper New Red Sandstone, he soon found, from the examination\r\nof various bones derived from the same formation, that he could define\r\nthree species of _Labyrinthodon_, and that in this genus the hind\r\nextremities were much larger than the anterior ones. This circumstance,\r\ncoupled with the fact of the _Labyrinthodon_ having existed at the period\r\nwhen the _Chirotherian_ footsteps were made, was the first step towards the\r\nidentification of those tracks with the newly discovered _Batrachian_. It\r\nwas at the same time observed that the footmarks of _Chirotherium_ were\r\nmore like those of toads than of any other living animal; and, lastly,\r\nthat the size of the three species of _Labyrinthodon_ corresponded with the\r\nsize of three different kinds of footprints which had already been supposed\r\nto belong to three distinct _Chirotheria_. It was moreover inferred, with\r\nconfidence, that the _Labyrinthodon_ was an _air-breathing_ reptile from\r\nthe structure of the nasal cavity, in which the posterior outlets were at\r\nthe back part of the mouth, instead of being directly under the anterior or\r\nexternal nostrils. It must have respired air after the manner of saurians,\r\nand may therefore have imprinted on the shore those footsteps, which, as we\r\nhave seen, could not have originated from an animal walking under water.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the structure of the foot is still wanting, and that a\r\nmore connected and complete skeleton is required for demonstration; but\r\nthe circumstantial evidence above stated is strong enough to produce\r\nthe conviction that the _Chirotherium_ and _Labyrinthodon_ are one\r\nand the same.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the manner in which one of these formidable _Batrachians_\r\nmay have impressed the mark of its feet upon the shore, Mr. Owen has\r\nattempted a restoration, of which a reduced copy is annexed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331. _Labyrinthodon pachygnathus_, Owen.]\r\n\r\nThe only bones of this species at present known are those of the head, the\r\npelvis, and part of the scapula, which are shown by stronger lines in the\r\nabove figure. There is reason for believing that the head was not smooth\r\nexternally, but protected by bony scutella.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin of Red Sandstone and Rock Salt._\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, in various parts of the world, red and mottled clays,\r\nand sandstones, of several distinct geological epochs, are found associated\r\nwith salt, gypsum, magnesian limestone, or with one or all of these\r\nsubstances. There is, therefore, in all likelihood, a general cause for\r\nsuch a coincidence. Nevertheless, we must not forget that there are dense\r\nmasses of red and variegated sandstones and clays, thousands of feet in\r\nthickness, and of vast horizontal extent, wholly devoid of saliferous or\r\ngypseous matter. There are also deposits of gypsum and of muriate of soda,\r\nas in the blue clay formation of Sicily, without any accompanying red\r\nsandstone or red clay.\r\n\r\nTo account for deposits of red mud and red sand, we have simply to suppose\r\nthe disintegration of ordinary crystalline or metamorphic schists. Thus, in\r\nthe eastern Grampians of Scotland, as, for example, in the north of\r\nForfarshire, the mountains of gneiss, mica-schist, and clay-slate, are\r\noverspread with alluvium, derived from the disintegration of those rocks;\r\nand the mass of detritus is stained by oxide of iron, of precisely the same\r\ncolour as the Old Red Sandstone of the adjoining Lowlands. Now this\r\nalluvium merely requires to be swept down to the sea, or into a lake, to\r\nform strata of red sandstone and red marl, precisely like the mass of the\r\n\"Old Red\" or New Red systems of England, or those tertiary deposits of\r\nAuvergne (see p. 182.), before described, which are in lithological\r\ncharacters quite undistinguishable. The pebbles of gneiss in the Eocene red\r\nsandstone of Auvergne point clearly to the rocks from which it has been\r\nderived. The red colouring matter may, as in the Grampians, have been\r\nfurnished by the decomposition of hornblende, or mica, which contain oxide\r\nof iron in large quantity.\r\n\r\nIt is a general fact, and one not yet accounted for, that scarcely any\r\nfossil remains are preserved in stratified rocks in which this oxide of\r\niron abounds; and when we find fossils in the New or Old Red Sandstone in\r\nEngland, it is in the grey, and usually calcareous beds, that they occur.\r\n\r\nThe gypsum and saline matter, occasionally interstratified with such red\r\nclays and sandstones of various ages, primary, secondary, and tertiary,\r\nhave been thought by some geologists to be of volcanic origin. Submarine\r\nand subaerial exhalations often occur in regions of earthquakes and\r\nvolcanos far from points of actual eruption, and charged with sulphur,\r\nsulphuric salts, and with common salt or muriate of soda. In a word, they\r\nare vents by which all the products which issue in a state of sublimation\r\nfrom the craters of active volcanos, obtain a passage from the interior of\r\nthe earth to the surface. That such gaseous emanations and mineral springs,\r\nimpregnated with the ingredients before enumerated, and often intensely\r\nheated, continue to flow out unaltered in composition and temperature for\r\nages, is well known. But before we can decide on their real instrumentality\r\nin producing in the course of ages beds of gypsum, salt, and dolomite, we\r\nrequire to know what are the chemical changes actually in progress in seas\r\nwhere this volcanic agency is at work.\r\n\r\nYet the origin of rock-salt is a problem of so much interest in\r\ntheoretical geology as to demand a full discussion of another hypothesis\r\nadvanced on the subject; namely, that which attributes the precipitation\r\nof the salt to evaporation, whether of inland lakes or of lagoons\r\ncommunicating with the ocean.\r\n\r\nAt Northwich, in Cheshire, two beds of salt, in great part unmixed with\r\nearthy matter, attain the extraordinary thickness of 90 and even 100 feet.\r\nThe upper surface of the highest bed is very uneven, forming cones and\r\nirregular figures. Between the two masses there intervenes a bed of\r\nindurated clay, traversed with veins of salt. The highest bed thins off\r\ntowards the south-west, losing 15 feet in thickness in the course of a\r\nmile.[295-A] The horizontal extent of these particular masses in Cheshire\r\nand Lancashire is not exactly known; but the area, containing saliferous\r\nclays and sandstones, is supposed to exceed 150 miles in diameter, while\r\nthe total thickness of the trias in the same region is estimated by Mr.\r\nOrmerod at more than 1700 feet. Ripple-marked sandstones, and the\r\nfootprints of animals, before described, are observed at so many levels\r\nthat we may safely assume the whole area to have undergone a slow and\r\ngradual depression during the formation of the Red Sandstone. The evidence\r\nof such a movement, wholly independent of the presence of salt itself, is\r\nvery important in reference to the theory under consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Principles of Geology\" (chap. 28.), I published a map, furnished to\r\nme by the late Sir Alexander Burnes, of that singular flat region called\r\nthe Runn of Cutch, near the delta of the Indus, which is 7000 square miles\r\nin area, or equal in extent to about one-fourth of Ireland. It is neither\r\nland nor sea, but is dry during a part of every year, and again covered by\r\nsalt water during the monsoons. Some parts of it are liable, after long\r\nintervals, to be overflowed by river-water. Its surface supports no grass,\r\nbut is encrusted over, here and there, by a layer of salt, about an inch in\r\ndepth, caused by the evaporation of sea-water. Certain tracts have been\r\nconverted into dry land by upheaval during earthquakes since the\r\ncommencement of the present century, and, in other directions, the\r\nboundaries of the Runn have been enlarged by subsidence. That successive\r\nlayers of salt might be thrown down, one upon the other, over thousands of\r\nsquare miles, in such a region, is undeniable. The supply of brine from the\r\nocean would be as inexhaustible as the supply of heat from the sun to cause\r\nevaporation. The only assumption required to enable us to explain a great\r\nthickness of salt in such as area is, the continuance, for an indefinite\r\nperiod, of a subsiding movement, the country preserving all the time a\r\ngeneral approach to horizontality. Pure salt could only be formed in the\r\ncentral parts of basins, where no sand could be drifted by the wind, or\r\nsediment be brought by currents. Should the sinking of the ground be\r\naccelerated, so as to let in the sea freely, and deepen the water, a\r\ntemporary suspension of the precipitation of salt would be the only result.\r\nOn the other hand, if the area should dry up, ripple-marked sands and the\r\nfootprints of animals might be formed, where salt had previously\r\naccumulated. According to this view the thickness of the salt, as well as\r\nof the accompanying beds of mud and sand, becomes a mere question of time,\r\nor requires simply a repetition of similar operations.\r\n\r\nMr. Hugh Miller, in an able discussion of this question, refers to Dr.\r\nFrederick Parrot's account, in his journey to Ararat (1836), of the salt\r\nlakes of Asia. In several of these lakes west of the river Manech, \"the\r\nwater, during the hottest season of the year, is covered on its surface\r\nwith a crust of salt nearly an inch thick, which is collected with shovels\r\ninto boats. The crystallization of the salt is effected by rapid\r\nevaporation from the sun's heat and the supersaturation of the water with\r\nmuriate of soda; the lake being so shallow that the little boats trail on\r\nthe bottom and leave a furrow behind them, so that the lake must be\r\nregarded as a wide pan of enormous superficial extent, in which the brine\r\ncan easily reach the degree of concentration required.\"\r\n\r\nAnother traveller, Major Harris, in his \"Highlands of Ethiopia,\" describes\r\na salt lake, called the Bahr Assal, near the Abyssinian frontier, which\r\nonce formed the prolongation of the Gulf of Tadjara, but was afterwards cut\r\noff from the gulf by a broad bar of lava or of land upraised by an\r\nearthquake. \"Fed by no rivers, and exposed in a burning climate to the\r\nunmitigated rays of the sun, it has shrunk into an elliptical basin, seven\r\nmiles in its transverse axis, half filled with smooth water of the deepest\r\ncaerulian hue, and half with a solid sheet of glittering snow-white salt,\r\nthe offspring of evaporation.\" \"If,\" says Mr. Hugh Miller, \"we suppose,\r\ninstead of a barrier of lava, that sand-bars were raised by the surf on a\r\nflat arenaceous coast during a slow and equable sinking of the surface, the\r\nwaters of the outer gulf might occasionally topple over the bar, and supply\r\nfresh brine when the first stock had been exhausted by evaporation.[296-A]\r\n\r\nWe may add that the permanent impregnation of the waters of a large shallow\r\nbasin with salt, beyond the proportion which is usual in the ocean, would\r\ncause it to be uninhabitable by mollusca or fish, as is the case in the\r\nDead Sea, and the muriate of soda might remain in excess, even though it\r\nwere occasionally replenished by irruptions of the sea. Should the saline\r\ndeposit be eventually submerged, it might, as we have seen from the example\r\nof the Runn of Cutch, be covered by a freshwater formation containing\r\nfluviatile organic remains; and in this way the apparent anomaly of beds of\r\nsea-salt and clays devoid of marine fossils, alternating with others of\r\nfreshwater origin, may be explained.\r\n\r\nDr. G. Buist, in a recent communication to the Bombay Geographical Society\r\n(vol. ix.), has asked how it happens that the Red Sea should not exceed the\r\nopen ocean in saltness, by more than 1/10th per cent. The Red Sea receives\r\nno supply of water from any quarter save through the Straits of\r\nBabelmandeb; and there is not a single river or rivulet flowing into it\r\nfrom a circuit of 4000 miles of shore. The countries around are all\r\nexcessively sterile and arid, and composed, for the most part, of burning\r\ndeserts. From the ascertained evaporation in the sea itself, Dr. Buist\r\ncomputes that nearly 8 feet of pure water must be carried off from the\r\nwhole of its surface annually, this being probably equivalent to 1/100th\r\npart of its whole volume. The Red Sea, therefore, ought to have 1 per cent.\r\nadded annually to its saline contents; and as these constitute 4 per cent.\r\nby weight, or 2-1/2 per cent. in volume of its entire mass, it ought,\r\nassuming the average depth to be 800 feet, which is supposed to be far\r\nbeyond the truth, to have been converted into one solid salt formation in\r\nless than 3000 years.[297-A] Does the Red Sea receive a supply of water\r\nfrom the ocean, through the narrow Straits of Babelmandeb, sufficient to\r\nbalance the loss by evaporation? And is there an undercurrent of heavier\r\nsaline water annually flowing outwards? If not, in what manner is the\r\nexcess of salt disposed of? An investigation of this subject by our\r\nnautical surveyors may perhaps aid the geologist in framing a true theory\r\nof the origin of rock-salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the New Red Sandstone of the valley of the Connecticut River\r\nin the United States._\r\n\r\nIn a depression of the granitic or hypogene rocks in the States of\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut, strata of red sandstone, shale, and\r\nconglomerate are found occupying an area more than 150 miles in length from\r\nnorth to south, and about 5 to 10 miles in breadth, the beds dipping to the\r\neastward at angles varying from 5 to 50 degrees. The extreme inclination of\r\n50 degrees is rare, and only observed in the neighbourhood of masses of\r\ntrap which have been intruded into the red sandstone while it was forming,\r\nor before the newer parts of the deposit had been completed. Having\r\nexamined this series of rocks in many places, I feel satisfied that they\r\nwere formed in shallow water, and for the most part near the shore, and\r\nthat some of the beds were from time to time raised above the level of the\r\nwater, and laid dry, while a newer series, composed of similar sediment,\r\nwas forming. The red flags of thin-bedded sandstone are often\r\nripple-marked, and exhibit on their under sides casts of cracks formed in\r\nthe underlying red and green shales. These last must have shrunk by drying\r\nbefore the sand was spread over them. On some shales of the finest texture\r\nimpressions of rain drops may be seen, and casts of them in the incumbent\r\nargillaceous sandstones. Having observed similar markings produced by\r\nshowers, of which the precise date was known, on the recent red mud of the\r\nBay of Fundy, and casts in relief of the same, on layers of dried mud\r\nthrown down by subsequent tides, I feel no doubt in regard to the origin of\r\nsome of the ancient Connecticut impressions. I have also seen on the\r\nmud-flats of the Bay of Fundy the footmarks of birds (_Tringa minuta_),\r\nwhich daily run along the borders of that estuary at low water, and which I\r\nhave described in my Travels.[297-B] Similar layers of red mud, now\r\nhardened and compressed into shale, are laid open on the banks of the\r\nConnecticut, and retain faithfully the impressions and casts of the feet of\r\nnumerous birds and reptiles which walked over them at the time when they\r\nwere deposited, probably in the Triassic Period.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Hitchcock, the footprints of no less than thirty-two\r\nspecies of bipeds, and twelve of quadrupeds, have been already detected in\r\nthese rocks. Thirty of these are believed to be those of birds, four of\r\nlizards, two of chelonians, and six of batrachians. The tracks have been\r\nfound in more than twenty places, scattered through an extent of nearly 80\r\nmiles from north to south, and they are repeated through a succession of\r\nbeds attaining at some points a thickness of more than 1000 feet, which may\r\nhave been thousands of years in forming.[298-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 332. Footprints of a bird. Turner's Falls, Valley of\r\nthe Connecticut. (See Dr. Deane, Mem. of Amer. Acad. vol. iv. 1849.)]\r\n\r\nAs considerable scepticism is naturally entertained in regard to the nature\r\nof the evidence derived from footprints, it may be well to enumerate some\r\nfacts respecting them on which the faith of the geologist may rest. When I\r\nvisited the United States in 1842, more than 2000 impressions had been\r\nobserved by Professor Hitchcock, in the district alluded to, and all of\r\nthem were indented on the upper surface of the layers, while the\r\ncorresponding casts, standing out in relief, were always on the lower\r\nsurfaces or planes of the strata. If we follow a single line of marks we\r\nfind them uniform in size, and nearly uniform in distance from each other,\r\nthe toes of two successive footprints, turning alternately right and left\r\n(see fig. 332.). Such single lines indicate a biped; and there is generally\r\nsuch a deviation from a straight line, in any three successive prints, as\r\nwe remark in the tracks left by birds. There is also a striking relation\r\nbetween the distance separating two footprints in one series and the size\r\nof the impressions; in other words, an obvious proportion between the\r\nlength of the stride and the dimension of the creature which walked over\r\nthe mud. If the marks are small, they may be half an inch asunder; if\r\ngigantic, as, for example, where the toes are 20 inches long, they are\r\noccasionally 4 feet and a half apart. The bipedal impressions are for the\r\nmost part trifid, and show the same number of joints as exist in the feet\r\nof living tridactylous birds. Now such birds have three phalangeal bones\r\nfor the inner toe, four for the middle and five for the outer one (see fig.\r\n332.); but the impression of the terminal joint is that of the nail only.\r\nThe fossil footprints exhibit regularly, where the joints are seen, the\r\nsame number; and we see in each continuous line of tracks the three-jointed\r\nand five-jointed toes placed alternately outwards, first on the one side\r\nand then on the other. It is not often that the matrix has been fine enough\r\nto retain impressions of the integument or skin of the foot; but in one\r\nfine specimen found at Turner's Falls on the Connecticut, by Dr. Deane,\r\nthese markings are well preserved, and have been recognized by Mr. Owen as\r\nresembling the skin of the ostrich, and not that of reptiles.[298-B] Much\r\ncare is required to ascertain the precise layer of a laminated rock on\r\nwhich an animal has walked, because the impression usually extends\r\ndownwards through several laminae; and if the upper layer originally trodden\r\nupon is wanting, one or more joints, or even in some cases an entire toe,\r\nwhich sank less deep into the soft ground, may disappear, and yet the\r\nremainder of the footprint be well defined.\r\n\r\nThe size of several of the fossil impressions of the Connecticut red\r\nsandstone so far exceeds that of any living ostrich, that naturalists at\r\nfirst were extremely adverse to the opinion of their having been made by\r\nbirds, until the bones and almost entire skeleton of the _Dinornis_ and of\r\nother feathered giants of New Zealand were discovered. Their dimensions\r\nhave at least destroyed the force of this particular objection. The\r\nmagnitude of the impressions of the feet of a heavy animal, which has\r\nwalked on soft mud, increases for some distance below the surface\r\noriginally trodden upon. In order, therefore, to guard against\r\nexaggeration, the casts rather than the mould are relied on. These casts\r\nshow that some of the fossil birds had feet four times as large as the\r\nostrich, but not perhaps larger than the _Dinornis_.\r\n\r\nSome of the quadrupedal footprints which accompany those of birds are\r\nanalogous to European _Chirotheria_, and with a similar disproportion\r\nbetween the hind and fore feet. Others resemble that remarkable reptile,\r\nthe _Rhyncosaurus_ of the English Trias, a creature having some relation\r\nin its osteology both to chelonians and birds. Other imprints, again,\r\nare like those of turtles.\r\n\r\nAmong the supposed bipedal tracks, a single distinct example only has been\r\nobserved of feet in which there are four toes directed forwards. In this\r\ncase a series of four footprints is seen, each 22 inches long and 12 wide,\r\nwith joints much resembling those in the toes of birds. Professor Agassiz\r\nhas suggested that it might have belonged to a gigantic bipedal batrachian;\r\nbut the evidence on this subject is too defective to warrant such a bold\r\nconjecture, and if we were to give the reins to our imagination, we might\r\nas well conceive a bird having four toes projecting forwards as a huge\r\ntwo-legged frog. Nor should we forget that some quadrupeds place the hind\r\nfoot so precisely on the spot just quitted by the fore foot, as to produce\r\na single line of imprints like a biped.\r\n\r\nNo bones have as yet been met with, whether of reptiles or birds, in the\r\nrocks of the Connecticut, but there are numerous coprolites; and an\r\ningenious argument has been derived by Mr. Dana, from the analysis of these\r\nbodies, and the proportion they contain of uric acid, phosphate of lime,\r\ncarbonate of lime, and organic matter, to show that, like guano, they are\r\nthe droppings of birds, rather than of reptiles.[299-A]\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, in his \"Journal of a Voyage in the Beagle,\" informs us that the\r\n\"South American ostriches, although they live on vegetable matter, such as\r\nroots and grass, are repeatedly seen at Bahia Blanca (lat. 39 deg. S.), on the\r\ncoast of Buenos Ayres, coming down at low water to the extensive mud-banks\r\nwhich are then dry, for the sake, as the Gauchos say, of feeding on small\r\nfish.\" They readily take to the water, and have been seen at the bay of San\r\nBlas, and at Port Valdez, in Patagonia, swimming from island to\r\nisland.[300-A] It is therefore evident, that in our times a South American\r\nmud-bank might be trodden simultaneously by ostriches, alligators,\r\ntortoises, and frogs; and the impressions left, in the nineteenth century,\r\nby the feet of these various tribes of animals, would not differ from each\r\nother more entirely than do those attributed to birds, saurians,\r\nchelonians, and batrachians, in the rocks of the Connecticut.\r\n\r\nTo determine the exact age of the red sandstone and shale containing these\r\nancient footprints in the United States, is not possible at present. No\r\nfossil shells have yet been found in the deposit, nor plants in a\r\ndeterminable state. The fossil fish are numerous and very perfect; but they\r\nare of a peculiar type, which was originally referred to the genus\r\n_Palaeoniscus_, but has since, with propriety, been ascribed, by Sir Philip\r\nEgerton, to a new genus. To this he has given the name of _Ischypterus_,\r\nfrom the great size and strength of the fulcral rays of the dorsal fin\r\n(from +ischys+; strength, and +pteron+, a fin). They differ from\r\n_Palaeoniscus_, as Mr. Redfield first pointed out, by having the vertebral\r\ncolumn prolonged to a more limited extent into the upper lobe of the tail,\r\nor, in the language of M. Agassiz, they are less heterocercal. The teeth\r\nalso, according to Sir P. Egerton, who, in 1844, examined for me a fine\r\nseries of specimens which I procured at Durham, Connecticut, differ from\r\nthose of _Palaeoniscus_ in being strong and conical.\r\n\r\nThat the sandstones containing these fish are of older date than the\r\nstrata containing coal, before described (p. 284.) as occurring near\r\nRichmond in Virginia, is highly probable. These were shown to be as old\r\nat least as the oolite and lias. The higher antiquity of the Connecticut\r\nbeds cannot be proved by direct superposition, but may be presumed from\r\nthe general structure of the country. That structure proves them to be\r\nnewer than the movements to which the Appalachian or Alleghany chain\r\nowes its flexures, and this chain includes the ancient coal formation\r\namong its contorted rocks. The unconformable position of this _New Red_\r\nwith ornithichnites on the edges of the inclined primary or paleozoic\r\nrocks of the Appalachians is seen at 4. of the section, fig. 379. p.\r\n327. The absence of fish with decidedly heterocercal tails may afford an\r\nargument against the Permian age of the formation; and the opinion that\r\nthe red sandstone is triassic, seems, on the whole, the best that we can\r\nembrace in the present state of our knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[286-A] Buckland, Bridgew.

Nevertheless, the progress of\r\ninvestigation, and a careful comparison of English rocks between the lias\r\nand the coal with those occupying a similar geological position in Germany\r\nand Russia, has enabled geologists to divide the Poikilitic formation; and\r\nhas even shown that the lowermost of the two divisions is more closely\r\nconnected, by its fossil remains, with the carboniferous group than with\r\nthe trias. If, therefore, we are to draw a line between the secondary and\r\nprimary fossiliferous strata, as between the tertiary and secondary, it\r\nmust run through the middle of what was once called the \"New Red,\" or\r\nPoikilitic group. The inferior half of this group will rank as Primary or\r\nPaleozoic, while its upper member will form the base of the Secondary\r\nseries. For the lower, or Magnesian Limestone division of English\r\ngeologists, Sir R. Murchison has proposed the name of Permian, from Perm, a\r\nRussian government where these strata are more extensively developed than\r\nelsewhere, occupying an area twice the size of France, and containing an\r\nabundant and varied suite of fossils.\r\n\r\nMr. King, in his valuable monograph, recently published, of the Permian\r\nfossils of England, has given a table of the following six members of the\r\nPermian system of the north of England, with what he conceives to be the\r\ncorresponding formations in Thuringia.[301-A]\r\n\r\n          North of England.

Syn. _Axinus\r\nobscurus_, Sow. Crystalline limestone, Permian.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334. _Schizodus truncatus_, King; to show\r\nhinge. Permian.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 335. _Mytilus septifer_, King. Syn. _Modiola\r\nacuminata_, James Sow. Permian crystalline limestone.]\r\n\r\nThese shells occur at Hartlepool and Sunderland, where the rock assumes an\r\noolitic and botryoidal character. Some of the beds in this division are\r\nripple-marked; and Mr. King imagines that the absence of corals and the\r\ncharacter of the shells indicate shallow water. In some parts of the coast\r\nof Durham, where the rock is not crystalline, it contains as much as\r\nforty-four per cent. of carbonate of magnesia, mixed with carbonate of\r\nlime. In other places,--for it is extremely variable in structure,--it\r\nconsists chiefly of carbonate of lime, and has concreted into globular and\r\nhemispherical masses, varying from the size of a marble to that of a\r\ncannon-ball, and radiating from the centre. Occasionally earthy and\r\npulverulent beds pass into compact limestone or hard granular dolomite. The\r\nstratification is very irregular, in some places well-defined, in others\r\nobliterated by the concretionary action which has re-arranged the materials\r\nof the rocks subsequently to their original deposition. Examples of this\r\nare seen at Pontefract and Ripon in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n_The brecciated limestone_ (No. 2.) contains no fragments of foreign\r\nrocks, but seems composed of the breaking-up of the Permian limestone\r\nitself, about the time of its consolidation. Some of the angular masses\r\nin Tynemouth Cliff are 2 feet in diameter. This breccia is considered by\r\nProfessor Sedgwick as one of the forms of the preceding limestone, No.\r\n1., rather than as regularly underlying it. The fragments are angular\r\nand never water-worn, and appear to have been re-cemented on the spot\r\nwhere they were formed. It is, therefore, suggested that they may have\r\nbeen due to those internal movements of the mass which produced the\r\nconcretionary structure; but the subject is very obscure, and after\r\nstudying the phenomenon in the Marston Rocks, on the coast of Durham, I\r\nfound it impossible to form any positive opinion on the subject. The\r\nwell-known brecciated limestones of the Pyrenees appeared to me to\r\npresent the nearest analogy, but on a much smaller scale.\r\n\r\n_The fossiliferous limestone_ (No. 3.) is regarded by Mr. King as a\r\ndeep-water formation, from the numerous delicate corals which it includes.\r\nOne of these, _Fenestella retiformis_ (fig. 336.), is a very variable\r\nspecies, and has received many different names. It sometimes attains a\r\nlarge size, measuring 8 inches in width. The same zoophyte is also found\r\nabundantly in the Permian of Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 336.

(See figs. 337, 338.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 337. _Productus calvus_, Sow. Min. Con.

Syn.\r\n_Triogonotreta undulata_, King's Monogr.\r\n\r\nMagnesian Limestone.]\r\n\r\n_The compact limestone_ (No. 4.) also contains organic remains,\r\nespecially corallines, and is intimately connected with the preceding.\r\nBeneath it lies the _marl-slate_ (No. 5.), which consists of hard,\r\ncalcareous shales, marl-slate, and thin-bedded limestones. At East\r\nThickley, in Durham, where it is thirty feet thick, this slate has\r\nyielded many fine specimens of fossil fish of the genera _Palaeoniscus_,\r\n_Pygopterus_, _Coelacanthus_, and _Platysomus_, genera which are all\r\nfound in the coal-measures of the carboniferous epoch, and which\r\ntherefore, says Mr. King, probably lived at no great distance from\r\nthe shore. But the Permian species are peculiar, and, for the\r\nmost part, identical with those found in the marl-slate or\r\ncopper-slate of Thuringia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 339. Restored outline of a fish of the genus\r\n_Palaeoniscus_, Agass. _Palaeothrissum_, Blainville.]\r\n\r\nThe _Palaeoniscus_ above mentioned belongs to that division of fishes\r\nwhich M. Agassiz has called \"Heterocercal,\" which have their tails\r\nunequally bilobate, like the recent shark and sturgeon, and the\r\nvertebral column running along the upper caudal lobe. (See fig. 340.)\r\nThe \"Homocercal\" fish, which comprise almost all the 8000 species at\r\npresent known in the living creation, have the tail-fin either single or\r\nequally divided; and the vertebral column stops short, and is not\r\nprolonged into either lobe. (See fig. 341.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 340. Shark.\r\n\r\n_Heterocercal._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 341. Shad. (_Clupea_, Herring tribe.)\r\n\r\n_Homocercal._]\r\n\r\nNow it is a singular fact, first pointed out by Agassiz, that the\r\nheterocercal form, which is confined to a small number of genera in the\r\nexisting creation, is universal in the Magnesian limestone, and all the\r\nmore ancient formations. It characterizes the earlier periods of the\r\nearth's history, when the organization of fishes made a greater approach to\r\nthat of saurian reptiles than at later epochs. In all the strata above the\r\nMagnesian limestone the homocercal tail predominates.\r\n\r\nA full description has been given by Sir Philip Egerton of the species of\r\nfish characteristic of the marl-slate in Mr. King's monograph before\r\nreferred to, where figures of the ichthyolites which are very entire and\r\nwell preserved, will be found. Even a single scale is usually so\r\ncharacteristically marked as to indicate the genus, and sometimes even the\r\nparticular species. They are often scattered through the beds singly, and\r\nmaybe useful to a geologist in determining the age of the rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 342. _Palaeoniscus comtus_, Agassiz.

Tab. p. 301.), which lie beneath the\r\nmarl-slate, consist of sandstone and sand, separating the magnesian\r\nlimestone from the coal, in Yorkshire and Durham. In some instances, red\r\nmarl and gypsum have been found associated with these beds. They have been\r\nclassed with the magnesian limestone by Professor Sedgwick, as being nearly\r\nco-extensive with it in geographical range, though their relations are very\r\nobscure. In some regions we find it stated that the imbedded plants are all\r\nspecifically identical with those of the carboniferous series; and, if so,\r\nthey probably belong to that epoch; for the true Permian flora appears,\r\nfrom the researches of MM. Murchison and de Verneuil in Russia, and of\r\nColonel von Gutbier in Saxony, to be, with few exceptions, distinct from\r\nthat of the coal (see p. 307.).\r\n\r\n_Dolomitic conglomerate of Bristol._--Near Bristol, in Somersetshire,\r\nand in other counties bordering the Severn, the unconformable beds of\r\nthe Lower New Red, resting immediately upon the Coal, consist of a\r\nconglomerate called \"dolomitic,\" because the pebbles of older rocks are\r\ncemented together by a red or yellow base of dolomite or magnesian\r\nlimestone. This conglomerate or breccia, for the imbedded fragments are\r\nsometimes angular, occurs in patches over the whole of the downs near\r\nBristol, filling up the hollows and irregularities in the mountain\r\nlimestone, and being principally composed at every spot of the debris of\r\nthose rocks on which it immediately rests. At one point we find pieces\r\nof coal shale, in another of mountain limestone, recognizable by its\r\npeculiar shells and zoophytes. Fractured bones, also, and teeth of\r\nsaurians, are dispersed through some parts of the breccia.\r\n\r\nThese saurians (which until the discovery of the _Archegosaurus_ in the\r\ncoal were the most ancient examples of fossil reptiles) are all\r\ndistinguished by having the teeth implanted deeply in the jaw-bone, and\r\nin distinct sockets, instead of being soldered, as in frogs, to a simple\r\nalveolar parapet. In the dolomitic conglomerate near Bristol the remains\r\nof species of two distinct genera have been found, called\r\n_Thecodontosaurus_ and _Palaeosaurus_ by Dr. Riley and Mr.\r\nStutchbury[306-A]; the teeth of which are conical, compressed, and with\r\nfinely serrated edges (figs. 348 and 349.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 348. Tooth of _Palaeosaurus_ platyodon, nat. size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 349. Tooth of _Thecodontosaurus_, 3 times magnified.]\r\n\r\nIn Russia, also, Thecodont saurians occur, in beds of the Permian age, of\r\nseveral genera, while others named _Protorosaurus_ are met with in the\r\nZechstein of Thuringia. This family of reptiles is allied to the living\r\nmonitor, and its appearance in a primary or paleozoic formation, observes\r\nMr. Owen, is opposed to the doctrine of the progressive development of\r\nreptiles from fish, or from simpler to more complex forms; for, if they\r\nexisted at the present day, these monitors would take rank at the head of\r\nthe Lacertian order.[306-B]\r\n\r\nIn Russia the Permian rocks are composed of white limestone, with gypsum\r\nand white salt; and of red and green grits, with occasionally copper ore;\r\nalso magnesian limestones, marlstones, and conglomerates.\r\n\r\nThe country of Mansfeld, in Thuringia, may be called the classic ground of\r\nthe Lower New Red, or Magnesian Limestone, or Permian formation, on the\r\nContinent. It consists there principally of, first, the Zechstein,\r\ncorresponding to the upper portion of our English series; and, secondly,\r\nthe marl-slate, with fish of species identical with those of the bed so\r\ncalled in Durham. This slaty marlstone is richly impregnated with copper\r\npyrites, for which it is extensively worked. Magnesian limestone, gypsum,\r\nand rock-salt, occur among the superior strata of this group. At its base\r\nlies the Rothliegendes, supposed to correspond with the Inferior or Lower\r\nNew Red Sandstone above mentioned, which occupies a similar place in\r\nEngland between the marl-slate and coal. Its local name of Rothliegendes,\r\n_red-lyer_, or \"Roth-todt-liegendes,\" _red-dead-lyer_, was given by the\r\nworkmen in the German mines from its red colour, and because the copper has\r\n_died out_ when they reach this rock, which is not metalliferous. It is, in\r\nfact, a great deposit of red sandstone and conglomerate, with associated\r\nporphyry, basaltic trap, and amygdaloid.\r\n\r\n_Permian Flora._--We learn from the recent investigation of Colonel von\r\nGutbier, that in the Permian rocks of Saxony no less than sixty species of\r\nfossil plants have been met with, forty of which have not yet been found\r\nelsewhere. Two or three of these, as _Calamites gigas_, _Sphenopteris\r\nerosa_, and _S. lobata_, are also met with in the government of Perm in\r\nRussia. Seven others, and among them _Neuropteris Loshii_, _Pecopteris\r\narborescens_, and _P. similis_, with several species of _Walchia_\r\n(Lycopodites), are common to the coal-measures.\r\n\r\nAmong the genera also enumerated by Colonel Gutbier are _Asterophyllites_\r\nand _Annularia_, so characteristic of the carboniferous period; also\r\n_Lepidodendron_, which is common to the Permian of Saxony, Thuringia, and\r\nRussia, although not abundant. _Noeggerathia_ (see fig. 350.), supposed by\r\nA. Brongniart to be allied to _Cycas_, is another link between the Permian\r\nand carboniferous vegetation. Coniferae, of the Araucarian division, also\r\noccur; but these are likewise met with both in older and newer rocks. The\r\nplants called _Sigillaria_ and _Stigmaria_, so marked a feature in the\r\ncarboniferous period, are as yet wanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 350. _Noeggerathia cuneifolia._ Ad. Brongniart.[307-A]]\r\n\r\nAmong the remarkable fossils of the rothliegendes, or lowest part of the\r\nPermian in Saxony and Bohemia, are the silicified trunks of tree-ferns\r\ncalled generically _Psaronius_. Their bark was surrounded by a dense\r\nmass of air-roots, which often constituted a great addition to the\r\noriginal stem, so as to double or quadruple its diameter. The same\r\nremark holds good in regard to certain living extra-tropical arborescent\r\nferns, particularly those of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nPsaronites are also found in the uppermost coal of Autun in France, and in\r\nthe upper coal-measures of the State of Ohio in the United States, but\r\nspecifically different from those of the rothliegendes. They serve to\r\nconnect the Permian flora with the more modern portion of the preceding or\r\ncarboniferous group. Upon the whole, it is evident that the Permian plants\r\napproach nearer to the carboniferous ones than to the triassic; and the\r\nsame may be said of the Permian fauna.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[301-A] Palaeontographical Society, 1848, London.\r\n\r\n[302-A] Trans.

The coal itself, even in Great\r\nBritain and Belgium, where it is most abundant, constitutes but an\r\ninsignificant portion of the whole mass. In the north of England, for\r\nexample, the thickness of the coal-bearing strata has been estimated at\r\n3000 feet, while the various coal-seams, 20 or 30 in number, do not in\r\nthe aggregate exceed 60 feet.[308-A]\r\n\r\nThe carboniferous formation comprises two very distinct members: 1st, that\r\nusually called the Coal-measures, of mixed freshwater, terrestrial, and\r\nmarine origin, often including seams of coal; 2dly, that named in England\r\nthe Mountain or Carboniferous limestone, of purely marine origin, and\r\ncontaining corals, shells, and encrinites.\r\n\r\nIn the south-western part of our island, in Somersetshire and South Wales,\r\nthe three divisions usually spoken of by English geologists are:\r\n\r\n  1. Coal-measures   { Strata of shale, sandstone, and grit, with\r\n                     {   occasional seams of coal, from 600 to 12,000\r\n                     {   feet thick.\r\n\r\n  2. Millstone grit  { A coarse quartzose sandstone passing into a\r\n                     {   conglomerate, sometimes used for millstones, with\r\n                     {   beds of shale; usually devoid of coal;\r\n                     {   occasionally above 600 feet thick.\r\n\r\n  3. Mountain or     } A calcareous rock containing marine shells and\r\n     Carboniferous   }   corals; devoid of coal; thickness variable,\r\n     limestone       }   sometimes 900 feet.\r\n\r\nThe millstone grit may be considered as one of the coal sandstones of\r\ncoarser texture than usual, with some accompanying shales, in which coal\r\nplants are occasionally found. In the north of England some bands of\r\nlimestone, with pectens, oysters, and other marine shells, occur in this\r\ngrit, just as in the regular coal-measures, and even a few seams of coal. I\r\nshall treat, therefore, of the whole group, as consisting of two divisions\r\nonly, the Coal-measures and Mountain Limestone. The latter is found in the\r\nsouthern British coal-fields, at the base of the system, or immediately in\r\ncontact with the subjacent Old Red Sandstone; but as we proceed northwards\r\nto Yorkshire and Northumberland it begins to alternate with true\r\ncoal-measures, the two deposits forming together a series of strata about\r\n1000 feet in thickness. To this mixed formation succeeds the great mass of\r\ngenuine mountain limestone.[309-A] Farther north, in the Fifeshire\r\ncoal-field in Scotland, we observe a still wider departure from the type of\r\nthe south of England, or a more complete intercalation of dense masses of\r\nmarine limestones with sandstones, and shales containing coal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL-MEASURES.\r\n\r\nIn South Wales the coal-measures have been ascertained by actual\r\nmeasurement to attain the extraordinary thickness of 12,000 feet, the beds\r\nthroughout, with the exception of the coal itself, appearing to have been\r\nformed in water of moderate depth, during a slow but perhaps intermittent\r\ndepression of the ground, in a region to which rivers were bringing a\r\nnever-failing supply of muddy sediment and sand. The same area was\r\nsometimes covered with vast forests, such as we see in the deltas of great\r\nrivers in warm climates, which are liable to be submerged beneath fresh or\r\nsalt water should the ground sink vertically a few feet.\r\n\r\nIn one section near Swansea, in South Wales, where the total thickness of\r\nstrata is 3246 feet, we learn from Sir H. De la Beche that there are ten\r\nprincipal masses of sandstone. One of these is 500 feet thick, and the\r\nwhole of them make together a thickness of 2125 feet. They are separated by\r\nmasses of shale, varying in thickness from 10 to 50 feet. The intercalated\r\ncoal-beds, sixteen in number, are generally from 1 to 5 feet thick, one of\r\nthem, which has two or three layers of clay interposed, attaining 9\r\nfeet.[309-B] At other points in the same coal-field the shales predominate\r\nover the sandstones. The horizontal extent of some seams of coal is much\r\ngreater than that of others, but they all present one characteristic\r\nfeature, in having, each of them, what is called its _underclay_. These\r\nunderclays, co-extensive with every layer of coal, consist of arenaceous\r\nshale, sometimes called firestone, because it can be made into bricks which\r\nstand the fire of a furnace. They vary in thickness from 6 inches to more\r\nthan 10 feet; and Mr. Logan first announced to the scientific world in 1841\r\nthat they were regarded by the colliers in South Wales as an essential\r\naccompaniment of each of the one hundred seams of coal met with in their\r\ncoal-field. They are said to form the _floor_ on which the coal rests; and\r\nsome of them have a slight admixture of carbonaceous matter, while others\r\nare quite blackened by it.\r\n\r\nAll of them, as Mr. Logan pointed out, are characterized by inclosing a\r\npeculiar species of fossil vegetable called _Stigmaria_, to the exclusion\r\nof other plants. It was also observed that, while in the overlying shales\r\nor \"roof\" of the coal, ferns and trunks of trees abound without any\r\n_Stigmariae_, and are flattened and compressed, those singular plants in the\r\nunderclays always retain their natural forms, branching freely, and sending\r\nout their slender leaves, as they were formerly styled, through the mud in\r\nall directions. Several species of _Stigmaria_ had long been known to\r\nbotanists, and described by them, before their position under each seam of\r\ncoal was pointed out. It was conjectured that they might be aquatic,\r\nperhaps floating plants, which sometimes extended their branches and leaves\r\nfreely in fluid mud, and which were finally enveloped in the same mud.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIFEROUS FLORA.\r\n\r\nThese statements will suffice to convince the reader that we cannot arrive\r\nat a satisfactory theory of the origin of coal till we understand the true\r\nnature of _Stigmaria_; and in order to explain what is now known of this\r\nplant, and of others which have contributed by their decay to produce coal,\r\nit will be necessary to offer a brief preliminary sketch of the whole\r\ncarboniferous flora, an assemblage of fossil plants, with which we are\r\nbetter acquainted than with any other which flourished antecedently to the\r\ntertiary epoch. It should also be remarked that Goeppert has ascertained\r\nthat the remains of every family of plants scattered through the\r\ncoal-measures are sometimes met with in the pure coal itself, a fact which\r\nadds greatly to the geological interest attached to this flora.\r\n\r\n_Ferns._--The number of species of carboniferous plants hitherto\r\ndescribed amounts, according to M. Ad. Brongniart, to about 500. These\r\nmay perhaps be a fragment only of the entire flora, but they are enough\r\nto show that the state of the vegetable world was then extremely\r\ndifferent from that now established. We are struck at the first glance\r\nwith the similarity of many of the ferns to those now living, and the\r\ndissimilarity of almost all the other fossils except the coniferae. Among\r\nthe ferns, as in the case of _Pecopteris_ for example (fig. 351.), it is\r\nnot always easy to decide whether they should be referred to different\r\ngenera from those established for the classification of living species;\r\nwhereas, in regard to most of the other contemporary tribes, with the\r\nexception of the coniferae, it is often difficult to guess the family,\r\nor even the class, to which they belong. The ferns of the carboniferous\r\nperiod are generally without organs of fructification, but in some\r\nspecimens these are well preserved. In the general absence of such\r\ncharacters, they have been divided into genera, distinguished chiefly\r\nby the branching of the fronds, and the way in which the veins of\r\nthe leaves are disposed. The larger portion are supposed to have been\r\nof the size of ordinary European ferns, but some were decidedly\r\narborescent, especially the group called _Caulopteris_, by Lindley,\r\nand the _Psaronius_ of the upper or newest coal-measures, before\r\nalluded to (p. 307.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 351. _Pecopteris lonchitica._ (Foss. Flo. 153.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 352. Sphenopteris. (Foss. Flo. 101.)\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Sphenopteris crenata._\r\n  _b._ The same, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 353. _Caulopteris primaeva_, Lindley.]\r\n\r\nAll the recent tree-ferns belong to one tribe (_Polypodiaceae_), and to a\r\nsmall number only of genera in that tribe, in which the surface of the\r\ntrunk is marked with scars, or cicatrices, left after the fall of the\r\nfronds. These scars resemble those of _Caulopteris_ (see fig. 353.). No\r\nless than 250 ferns have already been obtained from the coal strata; and\r\neven if we make some reduction on the ground of varieties which have been\r\nmistaken, in the absence of their fructification, for species, still the\r\nresult is singular, because the whole of Europe affords at present no more\r\nthan 50 indigenous species.\r\n\r\n[3 Illustrations: Living tree-ferns of different genera.

(Ibid.)]\r\n\r\n_Lepidodendra._--These fossils belong to the family of _Lycopodiums_, yet\r\nmost of them grew to the size of large trees. The annexed figures represent\r\na large fossil _Lepidodendron_, 49 feet long, found in Jarrow Colliery,\r\nnear Newcastle, lying in shale parallel to the planes of stratification.\r\nFragments of others, found in the same shale, indicate, by the size of the\r\nrhomboidal scars which cover them, a still greater magnitude. The living\r\nclub-mosses, of which there are about 200 species, are abundant in tropical\r\nclimates, where one species is sometimes met with attaining a height of 3\r\nfeet. They usually creep on the ground, but some stand erect, as the _L.\r\ndensum_, from New Zealand (fig. 360.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 360. Lycopodium.\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Lycopodium densum_; banks of R. Thames, New Zealand.\r\n  _b._ branch, natural size.\r\n  _c._ part of same, magnified.]\r\n\r\nIn the carboniferous strata of Coalbrook Dale, and in many other\r\ncoal-fields, elongated cylindrical bodies, called fossil cones, named by\r\nM. Adolphe Brongniart _Lepidostrobus_, are met with. (See fig. 361.)\r\nThey often form the nucleus of concretionary balls of clay-iron-stone,\r\nand are well preserved, exhibiting a conical axis, around which a great\r\nquantity of scales were compactly imbricated. The opinion of M.\r\nBrongniart is now generally adopted, that the _Lepidostrobus_ is\r\nthe fruit of _Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 361. _Lepidostrobus ornatus_, Brong.; half\r\nnat. size.

Flo. 79.)\r\nLower end with rootlets.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 363. _Calamites Suckowii_, Brong.; natural size. Common\r\nin coal throughout Europe.]\r\n\r\n_Equisetaceae._--To this family belong two species of the genus\r\n_Equisetites_, allied to the living \"horse-tail\" which now grows in marshy\r\ngrounds. Other species, which have jointed stems, depart more widely from\r\n_Equisetum_, but are yet of analogous organization. They differed from it\r\nprincipally in being furnished with a thin bark, which is represented in\r\nthe stem of _C. Suckowii_ (fig. 363.), in which it will be seen that the\r\nstriped external pattern does not agree with that left on the stone where\r\nthe bark is stripped off; so that if the two impressions were seen\r\nseparately, they might be mistaken for two distinct species.\r\n\r\nThe tallest living \"horse-tails\" are only 2 or 3 feet high in Europe, and\r\neven in tropical climates only attain, as in the case of _Equisetum\r\ngiganteum_, discovered by Humboldt and Bonpland, in South America, a height\r\nof about 5 feet, the stem being an inch in diameter. Several of the\r\nCalamites of the coal acquired the height and dimensions of small trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 364. _Asterophyllites foliosa._ (Foss. Flo. 25.)\r\nCoal-measures, Newcastle.]\r\n\r\n_Asterophyllites._--In this family, M. Brongniart includes several genera,\r\nand among them _Calamodendron_, _Asterophyllites_, and _Annularia_. The\r\ngraceful plant, represented in the annexed figure, is supposed to be the\r\nbranch of a shrub called _Calamodendron_, a new genus, divided off by\r\nBrongniart from the _Calamites_ of former authors. Its pith and medullary\r\nrays seem to show that it was dicotyledonous, and it appears to have been\r\nallied, by the nature of its tissue, to the gymnogens, or, still more, to\r\nthe _Sigillaria_, which will next be mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Sigillaria._--A large portion of the trees of the carboniferous period\r\nbelonged to this genus, of which about thirty-five species are known. The\r\nstructure, both internal and external, was very peculiar, and, with\r\nreference to existing types, very anomalous. They were formerly referred,\r\nby M. Ad. Brongniart, to ferns, which they resemble in the scalariform\r\ntexture of their vessels, and, in some degree, in the form of the\r\ncicatrices left by the base of the leafstalks which have fallen off (see\r\nfig. 365.). But with these points of analogy to cryptogamia, they combine\r\nan internal organization much resembling that of cycads, and some of them\r\nare ascertained to have had long linear leaves, quite unlike those of\r\nferns. They grew to a great height, from 30 to 60, or even 70 feet, with\r\nregular cylindrical stems, and without branches, although some species were\r\ndichotomous towards the top. Their fluted trunks, from 1 to 5 feet in\r\ndiameter, appear to have decayed rapidly in the interior, so as to become\r\nhollow, when standing; when, therefore, they were thrown prostrate on the\r\nmud, they were squeezed down and flattened. Hence, we find the bark of the\r\ntwo opposite sides (now converted into bright shining coal) to constitute\r\ntwo horizontal layers, one upon the other, half an inch, or an inch, in\r\nthickness. These same trunks, when they are placed obliquely or vertically\r\nto the planes of stratification, retain their original rounded form, and\r\nare uncompressed, the cylinder of bark having been filled with sand, which\r\nnow affords a cast of the interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 365. _Sigillaria laevigata_, Brong.]\r\n\r\n_Stigmaria._--This fossil, the importance of which has already been pointed\r\nout, was formerly conjectured to be an aquatic plant. It is now ascertained\r\nto be the root of _Sigillaria_. The connection of the roots with the stem,\r\npreviously suspected, on botanical grounds, by Brongniart, was first\r\nproved, by actual contact, in the Lancashire coal-field, by Mr. Binney. The\r\nfact has lately been shown, even more distinctly, by Mr. Richard Brown, in\r\nhis description of the _Stigmariae_ occurring in the underclays of the\r\ncoal-seams of the Island of Cape Breton, in Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 366. Stigmaria attached to a trunk of\r\n_Sigillaria_.[315-A]]\r\n\r\nIn a specimen of one of these, represented in the annexed figure (fig.\r\n366.), the spread of the roots was 16 feet, and some of them sent out\r\nrootlets, in all directions, into the surrounding clay.\r\n\r\nThe manner of attachment of the fibres to the stem resembles that of a ball\r\nand socket joint, the base of each rootlet being concave, and fitting on to\r\na tubercle (see figs. 367 and 368.). Rows of these tubercles are arranged\r\nspirally round each root, which have always a medullary cavity and woody\r\ntexture, much resembling that of _Sigillaria_, the structure of the\r\nvessels being, like it, scalariform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 367. Surface of another individual of same species,\r\nshowing form of tubercles. (Foss. Flo. 34.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 368. _Stigmaria ficoides_, Brong. One fourth of\r\nnat. size. (Foss. Flo. 32.)]\r\n\r\n_Conifers._--The coniferous trees of this period are referred to five\r\ngenera; the woody structure of some of them showing that they were allied\r\nto the Araucarian division of pines, more than to any of our common\r\nEuropean firs. Some of their trunks exceeded 44 feet in height.\r\n\r\n_Endogens._--Hitherto but few monocotyledonous plants have been\r\ndiscovered in the coal-strata. Most of these consist of fruits referred\r\nby some botanists to palms. The three-sided nuts, called\r\n_Trigonocarpum_, seven species of which are known, appear to have the\r\nbest claim to rank as palms, although M. Ad. Brongniart entertains some\r\ndoubt even as to their being monocotyledons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exogens._\r\n\r\nThe entire absence, so far as our paleontological investigations have\r\nhitherto gone, of ordinary dicotyledons or exogens in the coal measures, is\r\nmost remarkable. Hence, M. Adolphe Brongniart has called this period the\r\nage of acrogens, in consequence of the vast preponderance of ferns and\r\n_Lepidodendra_.[316-A] Nevertheless, a forest of the period, now under\r\nconsideration, may have borne a considerable resemblance to those woody\r\nregions of New Zealand, in which ferns, arborescent and herbaceous, and\r\nlycopodiums, with many coniferae, abound.\r\n\r\nThe comparative proportion of living ferns and _Araucariae_, in Norfolk\r\nIsland, to all the other plants, appears to be very similar to that\r\nformerly borne by these tribes respectively in a forest of the coal-period.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that Professor Goeppert, after examining the fossil\r\nvegetables of the coal-fields of Germany, has detected, in beds of pure\r\ncoal, remains of plants of every family hitherto known to occur fossil in\r\nthe coal. Many seams, he remarks, are rich in _Sigillaria_,\r\n_Lepidodendron_, and _Stigmaria_, the latter in such abundance, as to\r\nappear to form the bulk of the coal. In some places, almost all the plants\r\nare calamites, in others ferns.[316-B]\r\n\r\n_Coal, how formed--Erect trees._--I shall now consider the manner in\r\nwhich the above-mentioned plants are imbedded in the strata, and how\r\nthey may have contributed to produce coal. \"Some of the plants of our\r\ncoal,\" says Dr. Buckland, \"grew on the identical banks of sand, silt,\r\nand mud, which, being now indurated to stone and shale, form the strata\r\nthat accompany the coal; whilst other portions of these plants have been\r\ndrifted to various distances from the swamps, savannahs, and forests\r\nthat gave them birth, particularly those that are dispersed through the\r\nsandstones, or mixed with fishes in the shale beds.\" \"At Balgray, three\r\nmiles north of Glasgow,\" says the same author, \"I saw in the year 1824,\r\nas there still may be seen, an unequivocal example of the stumps of\r\nseveral stems of large trees, standing close together in their native\r\nplace, in a quarry of sandstone of the coal formation.\"[317-A]\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1837 and 1840, six fossil trees were discovered in the\r\ncoal-field of Lancashire, where it is intersected by the Bolton railway.\r\nThey were all in a vertical position, with respect to the plane of the\r\nbed, which dips about 15 deg. to the south. The distance between the first\r\nand the last was more than 100 feet, and the roots of all were imbedded\r\nin a soft argillaceous shale. In the same plane with the roots is a bed\r\nof coal, eight or ten inches thick, which has been ascertained to extend\r\nacross the railway, or to the distance of at least ten yards. Just above\r\nthe covering of the roots, yet beneath the coal seam, so large a\r\nquantity of the _Lepidostrobus variabilis_ was discovered inclosed in\r\nnodules of hard clay, that more than a bushel was collected from the\r\nsmall openings around the base of the trees (see figure of this genus,\r\np. 313.). The exterior trunk of each was marked by a coating of friable\r\ncoal, varying from one quarter to three quarters of an inch in\r\nthickness; but it crumbled away on removing the matrix. The dimensions\r\nof one of the trees is 15-1/2 feet in circumference at the base, 7-1/2\r\nfeet at the top, its height being 11 feet. All the trees have large\r\nspreading roots, solid and strong, sometimes branching, and traced to a\r\ndistance of several feet, and presumed to extend much farther. Mr.\r\nHawkshaw, who has described these fossils, thinks that, although they\r\nwere hollow when submerged, they may have consisted originally of hard\r\nwood throughout; for solid dicotyledonous trees, when prostrated in\r\ntropical forests, as in Venezuela, on the shore of the Caribbean Sea,\r\nwere observed by him to be destroyed in the interior, so that little\r\nmore is left than an outer shell, consisting chiefly of the bark. This\r\ndecay, he says, goes on most rapidly in low and flat tracks, in which\r\nthere is a deep rich soil and excessive moisture, supporting tall\r\nforest-trees and large palms, below which bamboos, canes, and minor\r\npalms flourish luxuriantly. Such tracts, from their lowness, would be\r\nmost easily submerged, and their dense vegetation might then give rise\r\nto a seam of coal.[317-B]\r\n\r\nIn a deep valley near Capel-Coelbren, branching from the higher part of the\r\nSwansea valley, four stems of upright _Sigillariae_ were seen, in 1838,\r\npiercing through the coal-measures of S. Wales; one of them was 2 feet in\r\ndiameter, and one 13 feet and a half high, and they were all found to\r\nterminate downwards in a bed of coal. \"They appear,\" says Sir H. De la\r\nBeche, \"to have constituted a portion of a subterranean forest at the epoch\r\nwhen the lower carboniferous strata were formed.[318-A]\r\n\r\nIn a colliery near Newcastle, say the authors of the Fossil Flora, a great\r\nnumber of _Sigillariae_ were placed in the rock as if they had retained the\r\nposition in which they grew. Not less than thirty, some of them 4 or 5 feet\r\nin diameter, were visible within an area of 50 yards square, the interior\r\nbeing sandstone, and the bark having been converted into coal. The roots of\r\none individual were found imbedded in shale; and the trunk, after\r\nmaintaining a perpendicular course and circular form for the height of\r\nabout 10 feet, was then bent over so as to become horizontal. Here it was\r\ndistended laterally, and flattened so as to be only one inch thick, the\r\nflutings being comparatively distinct.[318-B] Such vertical stems are\r\nfamiliar to our miners, under the name of coal-pipes. One of them, 72 feet\r\nin length, was discovered, in 1829, near Gosforth, about five miles from\r\nNewcastle, in coal-grit, the strata of which it penetrated. The exterior of\r\nthe trunk was marked at intervals with knots, indicating the points at\r\nwhich branches had shot off. The wood of the interior had been converted\r\ninto carbonate of lime; and its structure was beautifully shown by cutting\r\ntransverse slices, so thin as to be transparent. (See p. 40.)\r\n\r\nThese \"coal-pipes\" are much dreaded by our miners, for almost every year in\r\nthe Bristol, Newcastle, and other coal-fields, they are the cause of fatal\r\naccidents. Each cylindrical cast of a tree, formed of solid sandstone, and\r\nincreasing gradually in size towards the base, and being without branches,\r\nhas its whole weight thrown downwards, and receives no support from the\r\ncoating of friable coal which has replaced the bark. As soon, therefore, as\r\nthe cohesion of this external layer is overcome, the heavy column falls\r\nsuddenly in a perpendicular or oblique direction from the roof of the\r\ngallery whence coal has been extracted, wounding or killing the workman who\r\nstands below. It is strange to reflect how many thousands of these trees\r\nfell originally in their native forests in obedience to the law of gravity;\r\nand how the few which continued to stand erect, obeying, after myriads of\r\nages, the same force, are cast down to immolate their human victims.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked, that if, instead of working in the dark, the miner\r\nwas accustomed to remove the upper covering of rock from each seam of coal,\r\nand to expose to the day the soils on which ancient forests grew, the\r\nevidence of their former growth would be obvious. Thus in South\r\nStaffordshire a seam of coal was laid bare in the year 1844, in what is\r\ncalled an open work at Parkfield Colliery, near Wolverhampton. In the\r\nspace of about a quarter of an acre the stumps of no less than 73 trees\r\nwith their roots attached appeared, as shown in the annexed plan (fig.\r\n369.), some of them more than 8 feet in circumference. The trunks, broken\r\noff close to the root, were lying prostrate in every direction, often\r\ncrossing each other. One of them measured 15, another 30 feet in length,\r\nand others less. They were invariably flattened to the thickness of one or\r\ntwo inches, and converted into coal. Their roots formed part of a stratum\r\nof coal 10 inches thick, which rested on a layer of clay 2 inches thick,\r\nbelow which was a second forest, resting on a 2-foot seam of coal. Five\r\nfeet below this again was a third forest with large stumps of\r\n_Lepidodendra_, _Calamites_, and other trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 369. Ground-plan of a fossil forest, Parkfield\r\nColliery, near Wolverhampton, showing the position of 73 trees in a\r\nquarter of an acre.[319-A]]\r\n\r\nIn the account given, in 1821, by M. Alex. Brongniart of the coal-mine\r\nof Treuil, at St. Etienne, near Lyons, he states, that distinct\r\nhorizontal strata of micaceous sandstone are traversed by vertical\r\ntrunks of monocotyledonous vegetables, resembling bamboos or large\r\n_Equiseta_.[319-B] Since the consolidation of the stone, there has been\r\nhere and there a sliding movement, which has broken the continuity of\r\nthe stems, throwing the upper parts of them on one side, so that they\r\nare often not continuous with the lower.\r\n\r\nFrom these appearances it was inferred that we have here the monuments\r\nof a submerged forest. I formerly objected to this conclusion,\r\nsuggesting that, in that case, all the roots ought to have been found at\r\none and the same level, and not scattered irregularly through the mass.\r\nI also imagined that the soil to which the roots were attached should\r\nhave been different from the sandstone in which the trunks are enclosed.\r\nHaving, however, seen calamites near Pictou, in Nova Scotia, buried at\r\nvarious heights in sandstone and in similar erect attitudes, I have now\r\nlittle doubt that M. Brongniart's view was correct. These plants seem\r\nto have grown on a sandy soil, liable to be flooded from time to time,\r\nand raised by new accessions of sediment, as may happen in swamps near\r\nthe banks of a large river in its delta. Trees which delight in marshy\r\ngrounds are not injured by being buried several feet deep at their base;\r\nand other trees are continually rising up from new soils, several feet\r\nabove the level of the original foundation of the morass. In the banks\r\nof the Mississippi, when the water has fallen, I have seen sections of a\r\nsimilar deposit in which portions of the stumps of trees with their\r\nroots _in situ_ appeared at many different heights.[320-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 370. Section showing the erect position of fossil trees\r\nin coal sandstone at St. Etienne. (Alex. Brongniart.)]\r\n\r\nWhen I visited, in 1843, the quarries of Treuil above-mentioned, the fossil\r\ntrees seen in fig. 370. were removed, but I obtained proofs of other\r\nforests of erect trees in the same coal-field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 371. Inclined position of a fossil tree, cutting\r\nthrough horizontal beds of sandstone, Craigleith quarry, Edinburgh. Angle\r\nof inclination from _a_ to _b_ 27 deg..]\r\n\r\n_Snags._--In 1830, a slanting trunk was exposed in Craigleith quarry,\r\nnear Edinburgh, the total length of which exceeded 60 feet. Its diameter\r\nat the top was about 7 inches, and near the base it measured 5 feet in\r\nits greater, and 2 feet in its lesser width. The bark was converted into\r\na thin coating of the purest and finest coal, forming a striking\r\ncontrast in colour with the white quartzose sandstone in which it lay.\r\nThe annexed figure represents a portion of this tree, about 15 feet\r\nlong, which I saw exposed in 1830, when all the strata had been removed\r\nfrom one side. The beds which remained were so unaltered and undisturbed\r\nat the point of junction, as clearly to show that they had been\r\ntranquilly deposited round the tree, and that the tree had not\r\nsubsequently pierced through them, while they were yet in a soft state.\r\nThey were composed chiefly of siliceous sandstone, for the most part\r\nwhite; and divided into laminae so thin, that from six to fourteen of\r\nthem might be reckoned in the thickness of an inch. Some of these thin\r\nlayers were dark, and contained coaly matter; but the lowest of the\r\nintersected beds were calcareous. The tree could not have been hollow\r\nwhen imbedded, for the interior still preserved the woody texture in a\r\nperfect state, the petrifying matter being, for the most part,\r\ncalcareous.[321-A] It is also clear, that the lapidifying matter was not\r\nintroduced laterally from the strata through which the fossil passes, as\r\nmost of these were not calcareous. It is well known that, in the\r\nMississippi and other great American rivers, where thousands of trees\r\nfloat annually down the stream, some sink with their roots downwards,\r\nand become fixed in the mud. Thus placed, they have been compared to a\r\nlance in rest; and so often do they pierce through the bows of vessels\r\nwhich run against them, that they render the navigation extremely\r\ndangerous. Mr. Hugh Miller mentions four other huge trunks exposed in\r\nquarries near Edinburgh, which lay diagonally across the strata at an\r\nangle of about 30 deg., with their lower or heavier portions downwards, the\r\nroots of all, save one, rubbed off by attrition. One of these was 60 and\r\nanother 70 feet in length, and from 4 to 6 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 372. Section of the cliffs of the South Joggins,\r\nnear Minudie, Nova Scotia.]\r\n\r\nThe number of years for which the trunks of trees, when constantly\r\nsubmerged, can resist decomposition, is very great; as we might suppose\r\nfrom the durability of wood, in artificial piles, permanently covered by\r\nwater. Hence these fossil snags may not imply a rapid accumulation of beds\r\nof sand, although the channel of a river or part of a lagoon is often\r\nfilled up in a very few years.\r\n\r\n_Nova Scotia._--One of the finest examples in the world of a succession of\r\nfossil forests of the carboniferous period, laid open to view in a natural\r\nsection, is that seen in the lofty cliffs bordering the Chignecto Channel,\r\na branch of the Bay of Fundy, in Nova Scotia.[321-B]\r\n\r\nIn the annexed section (fig. 372.), which I examined in July, 1842, the\r\nbeds from _c_ to _i_ are seen all dipping the same way, their average\r\ninclination being at an angle of 24 deg. S.S.W. The vertical height of the\r\ncliffs is from 150 to 200 feet; and between _d_ and _g_, in which space I\r\nobserved seventeen trees in an upright position, or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, at right angles to the planes of stratification, I counted\r\nnineteen seams of coal, varying in thickness from 2 inches to 4 feet. At\r\nlow tide a fine horizontal section of the same beds is exposed to view on\r\nthe beach. The thickness of the beds alluded to, between _d_ and _g_, is\r\nabout 2,500 feet, the erect trees consisting chiefly of large _Sigillariae_,\r\noccurring at ten distinct levels, one above the other; but Mr. Logan, who\r\nafterwards made a more detailed survey of the same line of cliffs, found\r\nerect trees at seventeen levels, extending through a vertical thickness of\r\n4,515 feet of strata; and he estimated the total thickness of the\r\ncarboniferous formation, with and without coal, at no less than 14,570\r\nfeet, every where devoid of marine organic remains.[322-A] The usual height\r\nof the buried trees seen by me was from 6 to 8 feet; but one trunk was\r\nabout 25 feet high and 4 feet in diameter, with a considerable bulge at the\r\nbase. In no instance could I detect any trunk intersecting a layer of coal,\r\nhowever thin; and most of the trees terminated downwards in seams of coal.\r\nSome few only were based in clay and shale, none of them in sandstone. The\r\nerect trees, therefore, appeared in general to have grown on beds of coal.\r\nIn some of the underclays I observed _Stigmaria_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 373. Fossil tree at right angles to planes of\r\nstratification. Coal measures, Nova Scotia.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the plants, they belonged to the same genera, and most of them\r\nto the same species, as those met with in the distant coal-fields of\r\nEurope. In the sandstone, which filled their interiors, I frequently\r\nobserved fern leaves, and sometimes fragments of _Stigmaria_, which had\r\nevidently entered together with sediment after the trunk had decayed and\r\nbecome hollow, and while it was still standing under water. Thus the tree,\r\n_a b_, fig. 373., the same which is represented at _a_, fig. 374., or in\r\nthe bed _e_ in the larger section, fig. 372., is a hollow trunk 5 feet 8\r\ninches in length, traversing various strata, and cut off at the top by a\r\nlayer of clay 2 feet thick on which rests a seam of coal (_b_, fig. 374.)\r\n1 foot thick. On this coal again stood two large trees (_c_ and _d_), while\r\nat a greater height the trees _f_ and _g_ rest upon a thin seam of coal\r\n(_e_), and above them is an underclay, supporting the 4-foot coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 374. Erect fossil trees. Coal-measures, Nova Scotia.]\r\n\r\nIf we now return to the tree first mentioned (fig. 373.), we find the\r\ndiameter (_a b_) 14 inches at the top and 16 inches at the bottom, the\r\nlength of the trunk 5 feet 8 inches. The strata in the interior\r\nconsisted of a series entirely different from those on the outside. The\r\nlowest of the three outer beds which it traversed consisted of purplish\r\nand blue shale (_c_, fig. 373.), 2 feet thick, above which was sandstone\r\n(_d_) 1 foot thick, and, above this, clay (_e_) 2 feet 8 inches. But, in\r\nthe interior, were nine distinct layers of different composition: at the\r\nbottom, first, shale 4 inches, then sandstone 1 foot, then shale 4\r\ninches, then sandstone 4 inches, then shale 11 inches, then clay (_f_)\r\nwith nodules of ironstone 2 inches, then pure clay 2 feet, then\r\nsandstone 3 inches, and, lastly, clay 4 inches. Owing to the outward\r\nslope of the face of the cliff, the section (fig. 373.) was not exactly\r\nperpendicular to the axis of the tree; and hence, probably, the apparent\r\nsudden termination at the base without a stump and roots.\r\n\r\nIn this example the layers of matter in the inside of the tree are more\r\nnumerous than those without; but it is more common in the coal-measures\r\nof all countries to find a cylinder of pure sandstone,--the cast of the\r\ninterior of a tree, intersecting a great many alternating beds of shale\r\nand sandstone, which originally enveloped the trunk as it stood erect in\r\nthe water. Such a want of correspondence in the materials outside and\r\ninside, is just what we might expect if we reflect on the difference of\r\ntime at which the deposition of sediment will take place in the two\r\ncases; the imbedding of the tree having gone on for many years before\r\nits decay had made much progress.\r\n\r\nThe high tides of the Bay of Fundy, rising more than 60 feet, are so\r\ndestructive as to undermine and sweep away continually the whole face of\r\nthe cliffs, and thus a new crop of erect trees is brought into view\r\nevery three or four years. They are known to extend over a space between\r\ntwo and three miles from north to south, and more than twice that\r\ndistance from east to west, being seen in the banks of streams\r\nintersecting the coal-field.\r\n\r\nIn Cape Breton, Mr. Richard Brown has observed in the Sydney coal-field a\r\ntotal thickness of coal-measures, without including the underlying\r\nmillstone grit, of 1843 feet, dipping at an angle of 8 deg.. He has published\r\nminute details of the whole series, showing at how many different levels\r\nerect trees occur, consisting of _Sigillaria_, _Lepidodendron_, _Calamite_,\r\nand other genera. In one place eight erect trunks, with roots and rootlets\r\nattached to them, were seen at the same level, within a horizontal space 80\r\nfeet in length. Beds of coal of various thickness are interstratified. Some\r\nof the associated strata are ripple-marked, with impressions of rain-drops.\r\nTaking into account forty-one clays filled with roots of _Stigmaria_ in\r\ntheir natural position, and eighteen layers of upright trees at other\r\nlevels, there is, on the whole, clear evidence of at least fifty-nine\r\nfossil forests, ranged one above the other, in this coal-field, in the\r\nabove-mentioned thickness of strata.[324-A]\r\n\r\nThe fossil shells in Cape Breton and in the Nova Scotia section (fig.\r\n372.), consisting of _Cypris_, _Unio_ (?), _Modiola_, _Microconchus\r\ncarbonarius_ (see fig. 375.), and _Spirorbis_, seem to indicate brackish\r\nwater; but we ought never to be surprised if, in pursuing the same stratum,\r\nwe come to a fresh or purely marine deposit; for this will depend upon our\r\ntaking a direction higher up or lower down the ancient river or delta\r\ndeposit. When the Purbeck beds of the Wealden were described in Chap.\r\nXVIII., I endeavoured to explain the intimate connection of strata formed\r\nat a river's mouth, or in the tranquil lagoons of the delta, or in the sea,\r\nafter a slight submergence of the land, with its dirt-beds.\r\n\r\nIn the English coal-fields the same association of fresh, or rather\r\nbrackish water with marine strata, in close connection with beds of coal of\r\nterrestrial origin, has been frequently recognized. Thus, for example, a\r\ndeposit near Shrewsbury, probably formed in brackish water, has been\r\ndescribed by Sir R. Murchison as the youngest member of the carboniferous\r\nseries of that district, at the point where the coal-measures are in\r\ncontact with the Permian or \"Lower New Red.\" It consists of shales and\r\nsandstones about 150 feet thick, with coal and traces of plants; including\r\na bed of limestone, varying from 2 to 9 feet in thickness, which is\r\ncellular, and resembles some lacustrine limestones of France and Germany.\r\nIt has been traced for 30 miles in a straight line, and can be recognized\r\nat still more distant points. The characteristic fossils are a small\r\nbivalve, having the form of a _Cyclas_, a small _Cypris_ (fig. 376.), and\r\nthe microscopic shell of an annelid of an extinct genus called\r\n_Microconchus_ (fig. 375.), allied to _Serpula_ or _Spirorbis_.\r\n\r\nIn the lower coal-measures of Coalbrook Dale, the strata, according to Mr.\r\nPrestwich, often change completely within very short distances, beds of\r\nsandstone passing horizontally into clay, and clay into sandstone. The\r\ncoal-seams often wedge out or disappear; and sections, at places nearly\r\ncontiguous, present marked lithological distinctions. In this single field,\r\nin which the strata are from 700 to 800 feet thick, between forty and\r\nfifty species of terrestrial plants have been discovered, besides several\r\nfishes and trilobites of forms distinct from those occurring in the\r\nSilurian strata. Also upwards of forty species of mollusca, among which are\r\ntwo or three referred to the freshwater genus _Unio_, and others of marine\r\nforms, such as _Nautilus_, _Orthoceras_, _Spirifer_, and _Productus_. Mr.\r\nPrestwich suggests that the intermixture of beds containing freshwater\r\nshells with others full of marine remains, and the alternation of coarse\r\nsandstone and conglomerate with beds of fine clay or shale containing the\r\nremains of plants, may be explained by supposing the deposit of Coalbrook\r\nDale to have originated in a bay of the sea or estuary into which flowed a\r\nconsiderable river subject to occasional freshes.[325-A]\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Freshwater Fossils--Coal.\r\n\r\nFig. 375.\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Microconchus carbonarius_.\r\n  _b._ var. of same; nat. size, and magnified.\r\n\r\nFig. 376. _Cypris inflata_, natural size, and magnified. Murchison.[325-B]]\r\n\r\nIn the Edinburgh coal-field, at Burdiehouse, fossil fishes, mollusca,\r\nand cypris, very similar to those in Shropshire and Staffordshire, have\r\nbeen found by Dr. Hibbert.[325-C] In the coal-field also of Yorkshire\r\nthere are freshwater strata, some of which contain shells referred to\r\nthe genus _Unio_; but in the midst of the series there is one thin but\r\nvery widely spread stratum, abounding in fishes and marine shells, such\r\nas _Ammonites Listeri_ (fig. 377.), _Orthoceras_, and _Avicula\r\npapyracea_, Goldf. (fig. 378.)[325-D]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 377. _Ammonites Listeri_, Sow.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 378. _Avicula papyracea_, Goldf. (_Pecten\r\npapyraceus_, Sow.)]\r\n\r\nNo similarly intercalated layer of marine shells has been noticed in the\r\nneighbouring coal-field of Newcastle, where, as in South Wales and\r\nSomersetshire, the marine deposits are entirely below those containing\r\nterrestrial and freshwater remains.[326-A]\r\n\r\n_Clay-iron-stone._--Bands and nodules of clay-iron-stone are common in\r\ncoal-measures, and are formed, says Sir H. De la Beche, of carbonate of\r\niron, mingled mechanically with earthy matter, like that constituting the\r\nshales. Mr. Hunt, of the Museum of Practical Geology, instituted a series\r\nof experiments to illustrate the production of this substance, and found\r\nthat decomposing vegetable matter, such as would be distributed through all\r\ncoal strata, prevented the farther oxidation of the proto-salts of iron,\r\nand converted the peroxide into protoxide by taking a portion of its oxygen\r\nto form carbonic acid. Such carbonic acid, meeting with the protoxide of\r\niron in solution, would unite with it and form a carbonate of iron; and\r\nthis mingling with fine mud, when the excess of carbonic acid was removed,\r\nmight form beds or nodules of argillaceous iron-stone.[326-B]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[308-A] Phillips; art. \"Geology,\" Encyc.

Hence the former existence at the remote period\r\nunder consideration (the carboniferous) of a continent or chain of islands\r\nwhere the Atlantic now rolls its waves seems a fair inference. Nor are\r\nthere wanting other and independent proofs of such an ancient land situated\r\nto the eastward of the present Atlantic coast of North America; for the\r\ngeologist deduces the same conclusion from the mineral composition of the\r\ncarboniferous and some older groups of rocks as they are developed on the\r\neastern flanks of the Alleghanies, contrasted with their character in the\r\nlow country to the westward of those mountains.\r\n\r\nThe annexed diagram (fig. 379.) will assist the reader in understanding\r\nthe phenomena now alluded to, although I must guard him against\r\nsupposing that it is a true section.

It is occupied by tertiary and\r\ncretaceous strata, before described (pp. 171. 206. and 224.), which are\r\nnearly horizontal. The next belt, from B to C, consists of granitic rocks\r\n(hypogene), chiefly gneiss and mica-schist, covered occasionally with\r\nunconformable red sandstone, No. 4. (New Red or Trias?), remarkable for its\r\nornithichnites (see p. 327.). Sometimes, also, this sandstone rests on the\r\nedges of the disturbed paleozoic rocks (as seen in the section). The region\r\n(B C), sometimes called the \"Atlantic Slope,\" corresponds nearly in average\r\nwidth with the low and flat plain (A, B), and is characterized by hills of\r\nmoderate height, contrasting strongly, in their rounded shape and altitude,\r\nwith the long, steep, and lofty parallel ridges of the Alleghany mountains.\r\nThe outcrop of the strata in these ridges, like the two belts of hypogene\r\nand newer rocks (A B, and B C), above alluded to, when laid down on a\r\ngeological map, exhibit long stripes of different colours, running in a\r\nN.E. and S.W. direction, in the same way as the lias, chalk, and other\r\nsecondary formations in the middle and eastern half of England.\r\n\r\nThe narrow and parallel zones of the Appalachians here mentioned, consist\r\nof strata, folded into a succession of convex and concave flexures,\r\nsubsequently laid open by denudation. The component rocks are of great\r\nthickness, all referable to the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous\r\nformations. There is no principal or central axis, as in the Pyrenees and\r\nmany other chains--no nucleus to which all the minor ridges conform; but\r\nthe chain consists of many nearly equal and parallel foldings, having what\r\nis termed an anticlinal and synclinal arrangement (see above, p. 48.). This\r\nsystem of hills extends, geologically considered, from Vermont to Alabama,\r\nbeing more than 1000 miles long, from 50 to 150 miles broad, and varying in\r\nheight from 2000 to 6000 feet. Sometimes the whole assemblage of ridges\r\nruns perfectly straight for a distance of more than 50 miles, after which\r\nall of them wheel round together, and take a new direction, at an angle of\r\n20 or 30 degrees to the first.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the state surveyors of Virginia and Pennsylvania, Prof.\r\nW. B. Rogers and his brother Prof. H. D. Rogers, for the important\r\ndiscovery of a clue to the general law of structure prevailing throughout\r\nthis range of mountains, which, however simple it may appear when once made\r\nout and clearly explained, might long have been overlooked; amidst so great\r\na mass of complicated details. It appears that the bending and fracture of\r\nthe beds is greatest on the south-eastern or Atlantic side of the chain,\r\nand the strata become less and less disturbed as we go westward, until at\r\nlength they regain their original or horizontal position. By reference to\r\nthe section (fig. 379.), it will be seen that on the eastern side, or in\r\nthe ridges and troughs nearest the Atlantic, south-eastern dips\r\npredominate, in consequence of the beds having been folded back upon\r\nthemselves, as in _i_, those on the north-western side of each arch having\r\nbeen inverted. The next set of arches (such as _k_) are more open, each\r\nhaving its western side steepest; the next (_l_) opens out still more\r\nwidely, the next (_m_) still more, and this continues until we arrive at\r\nthe low and level part of the Appalachian coal-field (D E).\r\n\r\nIn nature or in a true section, the number of bendings or parallel folds is\r\nso much greater that they could not be expressed in a diagram without\r\nconfusion. It is also clear that large quantities of rock have been removed\r\nby aqueous action or denudation, as will appear if we attempt to complete\r\nall the curves in the manner indicated by the dotted lines at _i_ and _k_.\r\n\r\nThe movements which imparted so uniform an order of arrangement to this\r\nvast system of rocks must have been, if not contemporaneous, at least\r\nparts of one and the same series, depending on some common cause. Their\r\ngeological date is well defined, at least within certain limits, for\r\nthey must have taken place after the deposition of the carboniferous\r\nstrata (No. 5.), and before the formation of the red sandstone (No. 4.).\r\nThe greatest disturbing and denuding forces have evidently been exerted\r\non the south-eastern side of the chain; and it is here that igneous or\r\nplutonic rocks are observed to have invaded the strata, forming dykes,\r\nsome of which run for miles in lines parallel to the main direction of\r\nthe Appalachians, or N.N.E. and S.S.W.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the carboniferous rocks in the region C is very great, and\r\ndiminishes rapidly as we proceed to the westward. The surveys of\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia show that the south-east was the quarter whence\r\nthe coarser materials of these strata were derived, so that the ancient\r\nland lay in that direction. The conglomerate which forms the general base\r\nof the coal-measures is 1500 feet thick in the Sharp Mountain, where I saw\r\nit (at C) near Pottsville; whereas it has only a thickness of 500 feet,\r\nabout thirty miles to the north-west, and dwindles gradually away when\r\nfollowed still farther in the same direction, till its thickness is reduced\r\nto 30 feet.[329-A] The limestones, on the other hand, of the coal-measures,\r\naugment as we trace them westward. Similar observations have been made in\r\nregard to the Silurian and Devonian formations in New York; the sandstones\r\nand all the mechanically-formed rocks thinning out as they go westward, and\r\nthe limestones thickening, as it were, at their expense. It is, therefore,\r\nclear that the ancient land was to the east, where the Atlantic now is; the\r\ndeep sea, with its banks of coral and shells to the west, or where the\r\nhydrographical basin of the Mississippi is now situated.\r\n\r\nIn that region, near Pottsville, where the thickness of the coal-measures\r\nis greatest, there are thirteen seams of anthracitic coal, several of them\r\nmore than 2 yards thick. Some of the lowest of these alternate with beds of\r\nwhite grit and conglomerate of coarser grain than I ever saw elsewhere,\r\nassociated with pure coal. The pebbles of quartz are often of the size of a\r\nhen's egg. On following these pudding-stones and grits for several miles\r\nfrom Pottsville, by Tamaqua, to the Lehigh Summit Mine, in company with Mr.\r\nH. D. Rogers, in 1841, he pointed out to me that the coarse-grained strata\r\nand their accompanying shales gradually thin out, until seven seams of\r\ncoal, at first widely separated, are brought nearer and nearer together,\r\nuntil they successively unite; so that at last they form one mass, between\r\n40 and 50 feet thick. I saw this enormous bed of anthracitic coal quarried\r\nin the open air at Mauch Chunk (or the Bear Mountain), the overlying\r\nsandstone, 40 feet thick, having been removed bodily from the top of the\r\nhill, which, to use the miner's expression, had been \"scalped.\" The\r\naccumulation of vegetable matter now constituting this vast bed of\r\nanthracite, may perhaps, before it was condensed by pressure and the\r\ndischarge of its hydrogen, oxygen, and other volatile ingredients, have\r\nbeen between 200 and 300 feet thick. The origin of such a vast thickness of\r\nvegetable remains, so unmixed with earthy ingredients, can, I think, be\r\naccounted for in no other way, than by the growth, during thousands of\r\nyears, of trees and ferns, in the manner of peat,--a theory which the\r\npresence of the Stigmaria _in situ_ under each of the seven layers of\r\nanthracite, fully bears out. The rival hypothesis, of the drifting of\r\nplants into a sea or estuary, leaves the absence of sediment, or, in this\r\ncase, of sand and pebbles, wholly unexplained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 380. Cross section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 381. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nBut the student will naturally ask, what can have caused so many seams of\r\ncoal, after they had been persistent for miles, to come together and blend\r\ninto one single seam, and that one equal in the aggregate to the thickness\r\nof the several separate seams? Often had the same question been put by\r\nEnglish miners before a satisfactory answer was given to it by the late Mr.\r\nBowman. The following is his solution of the problem. Let _a a'_, fig.\r\n380., be a mass of vegetable matter, capable, when condensed, of forming a\r\n3-foot seam of coal. It rests on the underclay _b b'_, filled with roots of\r\ntrees _in situ_, and it supports a growing forest (C D). Suppose that part\r\nof the same forest D E had become submerged by the ground sinking down 25\r\nfeet, so that the trees have been partly thrown down and partly remain\r\nerect in water, slowly decaying, their stumps and the lower parts of their\r\ntrunks being enveloped in layers of sand and mud, which are gradually\r\nfilling up the lake D F. When this lake or lagoon has at length been\r\nentirely silted up and converted into land, say, in the course of a\r\ncentury, the forest C D will extend once more continuously over the whole\r\narea C F, as in fig. 381., and another mass of vegetable matter (_g g'_),\r\nforming 3 feet more of coal, may accumulate from C to F. We then find in\r\nthe region F, two seams of coal (_a'_ and _g'_) each 3 feet thick, and\r\nseparated by 25 feet of sandstone and shale, with erect trees based upon\r\nthe lower coal, while, between D and C, we find these two seams united into\r\na 2-yard coal. It may be objected that the uninterrupted growth of plants\r\nduring the interval of a century will have caused the vegetable matter in\r\nthe region C D to be thicker than the two distinct seams _a'_ and _g'_ at\r\nF; and no doubt there would actually be a slight excess representing one\r\ngeneration of trees with the remains of other plants, forming half an inch\r\nor an inch of coal; but this would not prevent the miner from affirming\r\nthat the seam _a g_, throughout the area C D, was equal to the two seams\r\n_a'_ and _g'_ at F.\r\n\r\nThe reader has seen, by reference to the section (fig. 379. p. 327.), that\r\nthe strata of the Appalachian coal-field assume an horizontal position west\r\nof the mountains. In that less elevated country, the coal-measures are\r\nintersected by three great navigable rivers, and are capable of supplying\r\nfor ages, to the inhabitants of a densely peopled region, an inexhaustible\r\nsupply of fuel. These rivers are the Monongahela, the Alleghany, and the\r\nOhio, all of which lay open on their banks the level seams of coal. Looking\r\ndown the first of these at Brownsville, we have a fine view of the main\r\nseam of bituminous coal 10 feet thick, commonly called the Pittsburg seam,\r\nbreaking out in the steep cliff at the water's edge; and I made the\r\naccompanying sketch of its appearance from the bridge over the river (see\r\nfig. 382.). Here the coal, 10 feet thick, is covered by carbonaceous shale\r\n(_b_), and this again by micaceous sandstone (_c_). Horizontal galleries\r\nmay be driven everywhere at very slight expense, and so worked as to drain\r\nthemselves, while the cars, laden with coal and attached to each other,\r\nglide down on a railway, so as to deliver their burden into barges moored\r\nto the river's bank. The same seam is seen at a distance, on the right bank\r\n(at _a_), and may be followed the whole way to Pittsburg, fifty miles\r\ndistant. As it is nearly horizontal, while the river descends it crops out\r\nat a continually increasing, but never at an inconvenient, height above the\r\nMonongahela. Below the great bed of coal at Brownsville is a fire-clay 18\r\ninches thick, and below this, several beds of limestone, below which again\r\nare other coal seams. I have also shown in my sketch another layer of\r\nworkable coal (at _d d_), which breaks out on the slope of the hills at a\r\ngreater height. Here almost every proprietor can open a coal-pit on his own\r\nland, and the stratification being very regular, he may calculate with\r\nprecision the depth at which coal may be won.\r\n\r\nThe Appalachian coal-field, of which these strata form a part (from C\r\nto E, section, fig. 379., p. 327.), is remarkable for its vast area;\r\nfor, according to Professor H. D. Rogers, it stretches continuously from\r\nN.E. to S.W., for a distance of 720 miles, its greatest width being\r\nabout 180 miles. On a moderate estimate, its superficial area amounts to\r\n63,000 square miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 382. View of the great Coal Seam on the Monongahela at\r\nBrownsville, Pennsylvania, U. S.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Ten-foot seam of coal.\r\n  _b._ Black bituminous or carbonaceous shale, 10 feet thick.\r\n  _c._ Micaceous sandstone.\r\n  _d d._ Upper seam of coal, 6 feet thick.]\r\n\r\nThis coal formation, before its original limits were reduced by\r\ndenudation, must have measured 900 miles in length, and in some places more\r\nthan 200 miles in breadth. By again referring to the section (fig. 379., p.\r\n327.), it will be seen that the strata of coal are horizontal to the\r\nwestward of the mountains in the region D E, and become more and more\r\ninclined and folded as we proceed eastward. Now it is invariably found, as\r\nProfessor H. D. Rogers has shown by chemical analysis, that the coal is\r\nmost bituminous towards its western limit, where it remains level and\r\nunbroken, and that it becomes progressively debituminized as we travel\r\nsouth-eastward towards the more bent and distorted rocks. Thus, on the\r\nOhio, the proportion of hydrogen, oxygen, and other volatile matters,\r\nranges from forty to fifty per cent. Eastward of this line, on the\r\nMonongahela, it still approaches forty per cent., where the strata begin to\r\nexperience some gentle flexures. On entering the Alleghany Mountains, where\r\nthe distinct anticlinal axes begin to show themselves, but before the\r\ndislocations are considerable, the volatile matter is generally in the\r\nproportion of eighteen or twenty per cent. At length, when we arrive at\r\nsome insulated coal-fields (5', fig. 379.) associated with the boldest\r\nflexures of the Appalachian chain, where the strata have been actually\r\nturned over, as near Pottsville, we find the coal to contain only from six\r\nto twelve per cent. of bitumen, thus becoming a genuine anthracite.[333-A]\r\n\r\nIt appears from the researches of Liebig and other eminent chemists, that\r\nwhen wood and vegetable matter are buried in the earth, exposed to\r\nmoisture, and partially or entirely excluded from the air, they decompose\r\nslowly and evolve carbonic acid gas, thus parting with a portion of their\r\noriginal oxygen. By this means, they become gradually converted into\r\nlignite or wood-coal, which contains a larger proportion of hydrogen than\r\nwood does. A continuance of decomposition changes this lignite into common\r\nor bituminous coal, chiefly by the discharge of carburetted hydrogen, or\r\nthe gas by which we illuminate our streets and houses. According to\r\nBischoff, the inflammable gases which are always escaping from mineral\r\ncoal, and are so often the cause of fatal accidents in mines, always\r\ncontain carbonic acid, carburetted hydrogen, nitrogen, and olefiant gas.\r\nThe disengagement of all these gradually transforms ordinary or bituminous\r\ncoal into anthracite, to which the various names of splint coal, glance\r\ncoal, culm, and many others, have been given.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, in the Appalachian coal-field, there is an intimate\r\nconnection between the extent to which the coal has parted with its\r\ngaseous contents, and the amount of disturbance which the strata have\r\nundergone. The coincidence of these phenomena may be attributed partly\r\nto the greater facility afforded for the escape of volatile matter,\r\nwhere the fracturing of the rocks had produced an infinite number of\r\ncracks and crevices, and also to the heat of the gases and water\r\npenetrating these cracks, when the great movements took place, which\r\nhave rent and folded the Appalachian strata. It is well known that, at\r\nthe present period, thermal waters and hot vapours burst out from the\r\nearth during earthquakes, and these would not fail to promote the\r\ndisengagement of volatile matter from the carboniferous rocks.\r\n\r\n_Continuity of seams of coal._--As single seams of coal are continuous over\r\nvery wide areas, it has been asked, how forests could have prevailed\r\nuninterruptedly over such wide spaces, without being oftener flooded by\r\nturbid rivers, or, when submerged, denuded by marine currents. It appears,\r\nfrom the description of the Cape Breton coal-field, by Mr. Richard Brown,\r\nthat false stratification is common in the beds of sand, and some partial\r\ndenudation of these, at least, must often have taken place during the\r\naccumulation of the carboniferous series.\r\n\r\nIn the Forest of Dean, ancient river-channels are found, which pass through\r\nbeds of coal, and in which rounded pebbles of coal occur. They are of older\r\ndate than the overlying and undisturbed coal-measures. The late Mr. Buddle,\r\nwho described them to me, told me he had seen similar phenomena in the\r\nNewcastle coal-field. Nevertheless, instances of these channels are much\r\nmore rare than we might have anticipated, especially when we remember how\r\noften the roots of trees (_Stigmariae_) have been torn up, and drifted in\r\nbroken fragments into the grits and sandstones. The prevalence of a\r\ndownward movement is, no doubt, the principal cause which has saved so many\r\nextensive seams of coal from destruction by fluviatile action.\r\n\r\nThe purity of the coal, or its non-intermixture with earthy matter,\r\npresents another theoretical difficulty to many geologists, who are\r\ninclined to believe that the trees and smaller plants of the\r\ncarboniferous period grew in extensive swamps, rather than on land not\r\nliable to be inundated. It appears, however, that in the alluvial plain\r\nand delta of the Mississippi, extensive \"cypress swamps,\" as they are\r\ncalled, densely covered with various trees, occur, into which no matter\r\nheld in mechanical suspension is ever introduced during the greatest\r\ninundations, inasmuch as they are all surrounded by a dense marginal\r\nbelt of reeds, canes, and brushwood. Through this thick barrier the\r\nriver-water must pass, so that it is invariably well filtered before it\r\ncan reach the interior of the forest-covered area, within which,\r\nvegetable matter is continually accumulating from the decay of trees and\r\nsemi-aquatic plants. In proof of this, I may observe, that whenever any\r\npart of a swamp is dried up, during an unusually hot season, and the\r\nwood set on fire, pits are burnt into the ground many feet deep, or as\r\nfar down as the fire can descend without meeting with water, and it is\r\nthen found that scarcely any residuum or earthy matter is left.[334-A]\r\nAt the bottom of these \"cypress swamps\" of the Mississippi, a bed of\r\nclay is found, with roots of the tall cypress (_Taxodium distichum_),\r\njust as the underclays of the coal are filled with _Stigmaria_.\r\n\r\n_Climate of Coal Period._--So long as the botanist taught that a tropical\r\nclimate was implied by the carboniferous flora, geologists might well be at\r\na loss to reconcile the preservation of so much vegetable matter with a\r\nhigh temperature; for heat hastens the decomposition of fallen leaves and\r\ntrunks of trees, whether in the atmosphere or in water.[335-A] It is well\r\nknown that peat, so abundant in the bogs of high latitudes, ceases to grow\r\nin the swamps of warmer regions. It seems, however, to have become a more\r\nand more received opinion, that the coal-plants do not, on the whole,\r\nindicate a climate resembling that now enjoyed in the equatorial zone.\r\nTree-ferns range as far south as the southern part of New Zealand, and\r\nAraucarian pines occur in Norfolk Island. A great predominance of ferns and\r\nlycopodiums indicates warmth, moisture, equability of temperature, and\r\nfreedom from frost, rather than intense heat; and we know too little of the\r\nsigillariae, calamites, asterophyllites, and other peculiar forms of the\r\ncarboniferous period, to be able to speculate with confidence on the kind\r\nof climate they may have required.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, we are entitled to presume, from the corals and cephalopoda of\r\nthe mountain limestone, that a warm temperature characterized the northern\r\nseas in the carboniferous era; but the absence of cold may have given rise\r\n(as at present in the seas of the Bermudas, under the influence of the gulf\r\nstream) to a very wide geographical range of stone-building corals and\r\nshell-bearing cuttle-fish, without its being necessary to call in the aid\r\nof tropical heat.[335-B]\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIFEROUS REPTILES.\r\n\r\nWhere we have evidence in a single coal-field, as in that of Nova Scotia,\r\nor South Wales, of fifty or even a hundred ancient forests buried one above\r\nthe other, with the roots of trees still in their original position, and\r\nwith some of the trunks still remaining erect, we are apt to wonder that\r\nuntil the year 1844 no remains of contemporaneous air-breathing creatures,\r\nexcept a few insects, had been discovered. No vertebrated animals more\r\nhighly organized than fish, no mammalia or birds, no saurians, frogs,\r\ntortoises, or snakes, were yet known in rocks of such high antiquity. In\r\nthe coal-field of Coalbrook Dale mention had been made of two species of\r\nbeetles of the family _Curculionidae_, and of a neuropterous insect\r\nresembling the genus _Corydalis_, with another related to the\r\n_Phasmidae_.[335-C] In other coal-measures in Europe we find notice of a\r\nscorpion and of a moth allied to _Tinea_, also of one air-breathing\r\ncrustacean, or land-crab. Yet Agassiz had already described in his great\r\nwork on fossil fishes more than one hundred and fifty species of\r\nichthyolites from the coal strata, ninety-four belonging to the families of\r\nshark and ray, and fifty-eight to the class of ganoids. Some of these fish\r\nare very remote in their organization from any now living, especially\r\nthose of the family called _Sauroid_ by Agassiz; as _Megalichthys_,\r\n_Holoptychius_, and others, which are often of great size, and all\r\npredaceous. Their osteology, says M. Agassiz, reminds us in many respects\r\nof the skeletons of saurian reptiles, both by the close sutures of the\r\nbones of the skull, their large conical teeth striated longitudinally (see\r\nfig. 383.), the articulations of the spinous processes with the vertebrae,\r\nand other characters. Yet they do not form a family intermediate between\r\nfish and reptiles, but are true _fish_, though doubtless more highly\r\norganized than any living fish.[336-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 383. _Holoptychius Hibberti_, Ag. Fifeshire\r\ncoal-field; natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed figure represents a large tooth of the _Megalichthys_,\r\nfound by Mr. Horner in the Cannel coal of Fifeshire. It probably\r\ninhabited an estuary, like many of its contemporaries, and frequented\r\nboth rivers and the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 384. _Archegosaurus minor_, Goldfuss. Fossil reptile\r\nfrom the coal-measures, Saarbrueck.]\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1844, the first skeleton of a true reptile was announced from\r\nthe coal of Muenster-Appel in Rhenish Bavaria, by H. von Meyer, under the\r\nname of _Apateon pedestris_, the animal being supposed to be nearly related\r\nto the salamanders. Three years later, in 1847, Prof. von Dechen found in\r\nthe coal-field of Saarbrueck, at the village of Lebach, between Strasburg\r\nand Treves, the skeletons of no less than three distinct species of\r\nair-breathing reptiles, which were described by the late Prof. Goldfuss\r\nunder the generic name of _Archegosaurus_. The ichthyolites and plants\r\nfound in the same strata, left no doubt that these remains belonged to the\r\ntrue coal period. The skulls, teeth, and the greater portions of the\r\nskeleton, nay, even a large part of the skin, of two of these reptiles have\r\nbeen faithfully preserved in the centre of spheroidal concretions of\r\nclay-iron-stone. The largest of these lizards, _Archegosaurus Decheni_,\r\nmust have been 3 feet 6 inches long. The annexed drawing represents the\r\nsmallest of the three of the natural size. They were considered by Goldfuss\r\nas saurians, but by Herman von Meyer as most nearly allied to the\r\n_Labyrinthodon_, and therefore connected with the batrachians, as well as\r\nthe lizards. The remains of the extremities leave no doubt that they were\r\nquadrupeds, \"provided,\" says Von Meyer, \"with hands and feet terminating in\r\ndistinct toes; but these limbs were weak, serving only for swimming or\r\ncreeping.\" The same anatomist has pointed out certain points of analogy\r\nbetween their bones and those of the _Proteus anguinus_; and Mr. Owen has\r\nobserved to me that they make an approach to the _Proteus_ in the shortness\r\nof their ribs. Two of these ancient reptiles retain a large part of the\r\nouter skin, which consisted of long, narrow, wedge-shaped, tile-like, and\r\nhorny scales, arranged in rows (see fig. 385.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 385. Imbricated covering of skin of _Archegosaurus\r\nmedius_, Goldf.; magnified.[337-A]]\r\n\r\n_Cheirotherian footprints in coal measures, United States._--In 1844,\r\nthe very year when the Apateon or Salamander of the coal was first met\r\nwith in the country between the Moselle and the Rhine, Dr. King\r\npublished an account of the footprints of a large reptile discovered by\r\nhim in North America. These occur in the coal strata of Greensburg, in\r\nWestmoreland County, Pennsylvania; and I had an opportunity of examining\r\nthem in 1846. I was at once convinced of their genuineness, and declared\r\nmy conviction on that point, on which doubts had been entertained both\r\nin Europe and the United States. The footmarks were first observed\r\nstanding out in relief from the lower surface of slabs of sandstone,\r\nresting on thin layers of fine unctuous clay. I brought away one of\r\nthese masses, which is represented in the accompanying drawing (fig.\r\n386.). It displays, together with footprints, the casts of cracks (_a_,\r\n_a'_) of various sizes. The origin of such cracks in clay, and casts of\r\nthe same, has before been explained, and referred to the drying and\r\nshrinking of mud, and the subsequent pouring of sand into open crevices.\r\nIt will be seen that some of the cracks, as at _b_, _c_, traverse the\r\nfootprints, and produce distortion in them, as might have been expected,\r\nfor the mud must have been soft when the animal walked over it and left\r\nthe impressions; whereas, when it afterwards dried up and shrank, it\r\nwould be too hard to receive such indentations.\r\n\r\nNo less than twenty-three footsteps were observed by Dr. King in the\r\nsame quarry before it was abandoned, the greater part of them so\r\narranged (see fig. 387.) on the surface of one stratum as to imply that\r\nthey were made successively by the same animal. Everywhere there was a\r\ndouble row of tracks, and in each row they occur in pairs, each pair\r\nconsisting of a hind and fore foot, and each being at nearly equal\r\ndistances from the next pair. In each parallel row the toes turn the one\r\nset to the right, the other to the left. In the European\r\n_Cheirotherium_, before mentioned (p. 290.), both the hind and fore feet\r\nhave each five toes, and the size of the hind foot is about five times\r\nas large as the fore foot. In the American fossil the posterior\r\nfootprint is not even twice as large as the anterior, and the number of\r\ntoes is unequal, being five in the hinder and four in the anterior foot.\r\nIn this, as in the European _Cheirotherium_, one toe stands out like a\r\nthumb, and these thumb-like toes turn the one set to the right, and the\r\nother to the left. The American _Cheirotherium_ was evidently a broader\r\nanimal, and belonged to a distinct genus from that of the triassic\r\nage in Europe.[338-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 386. _Scale one-sixth the original._ Slab of sandstone\r\nfrom the coal-measures of Pennsylvania, with footprints of air-breathing\r\nreptile and casts of cracks.]\r\n\r\nWe may assume that the reptile which left these prints on the ancient\r\nsands of the coal-measures was an air-breather, because its weight would\r\nnot have been sufficient under water to have made impressions so deep and\r\ndistinct. The same conclusion is also borne out by the casts of the cracks\r\nabove described, for they show that the clay had been exposed to the air\r\nand sun, so as to have dried and shrunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 387. Series of reptilian footprints in the coal-strata\r\nof Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n_a._ Mark of nail?]\r\n\r\nThe geological position of the sandstone of Greensburg is perfectly clear,\r\nbeing situated in the midst of the Appalachian coal-field, having the main\r\nbed of coal, called the Pittsburg seam, above mentioned (p. 331.), 3 yards\r\nthick, 100 feet above it, and worked in the neighbourhood, with several\r\nother seams of coal at lower levels. The impressions of _Lepidodendron_,\r\n_Sigillaria_, _Stigmaria_, and other characteristic carboniferous plants,\r\nare found both above and below the level of the reptilian footsteps.\r\n\r\nAnalogous footprints of a large reptile of still older date have since\r\nbeen found (1849), by Mr. Isaac Lea, in the lowest beds of the coal\r\nformation at Pottsville, near Philadelphia, so that we may now be said\r\nto have the footmarks of two reptilians of the coal period, and the\r\nskeletons of four.[340-A]\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIFEROUS OR MOUNTAIN LIMESTONE.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that this rock lies sometimes entirely beneath the\r\ncoal-measures, while, in other districts, it alternates with the shales and\r\nsandstone of the coal. In both cases it is destitute of land plants, and\r\nusually charged with corals, which are often of large size; and several\r\nspecies belong to the lamelliferous class of Lamarck, which enter largely\r\ninto the structure of coral reefs now growing. There are also a great\r\nnumber of _Crinoidea_ (see fig. 388.), and a few _Echinoderms_, associated\r\nwith the zoophytes above mentioned. The _Brachiopoda_ constitute a large\r\nproportion of the Mollusca, many species being referable to two extinct\r\ngenera, _Spirifer_ (or _Spirifera_) (fig. 389.), and _Productus_\r\n(_Leptaena_) (fig. 390.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 388. _Cyathocrinites planus_, Miller.\r\nMountain limestone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 389. _Spirifer glaber_, Sow. Mountain limestone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 390. _Productus Martini_, Sow. (_P. semireticulatus_,\r\nFlem.) Mountain limestone.]\r\n\r\nAmong the spiral univalve shells the extinct genus _Euomphalus_ (see fig.\r\n391.) is one of the commonest fossils of the Mountain limestone. In the\r\ninterior it is often divided into chambers (see fig. 391. _d_); the septa\r\nor partitions not being perforated, as in foraminiferous shells, or in\r\nthose having siphuncles, like the Nautilus. The animal appears, like the\r\nrecent _Bulimus decollatus_, to have retreated at different periods of its\r\ngrowth, from the internal cavity previously formed, and to have closed all\r\ncommunication with it by a septum. The number of chambers is irregular, and\r\nthey are generally wanting in the innermost whorl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 391. _Euomphalus pentagulatus_, Min. Con.\r\nMountain limestone.\r\n\r\n_a._ Upper side; _b._ lower, or umbilical side; _c._ view showing mouth\r\nwhich is less pentagonal in older individuals; _d._ view of polished\r\nsection, showing internal chambers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 392. Portion of _Orthoceras laterale_,\r\nPhillips. Mountain limestone.]\r\n\r\nThere are also many univalve and bivalve shells of existing genera in the\r\nMountain limestone, such as _Turritella_, _Buccinum_, _Patella_,\r\n_Isocardia_, _Nucula_, and _Pecten_.[341-A] But the _Cephalopoda_ depart,\r\nin general, more widely from living forms, some being generically distinct\r\nfrom all those found in strata newer than the coal. In this number may be\r\nmentioned _Orthoceras_, a siphuncled and chambered shell, like a _Nautilus_\r\nuncoiled and straightened. Some species of this genus are several feet long\r\n(fig. 392.). The _Goniatite_ is another genus, nearly allied to the\r\n_Ammonite_, from which it differs in having the lobes of the septa free\r\nfrom lateral denticulations, or crenatures; so that the outline of these is\r\ncontinuous and uninterrupted (see _a_, fig. 393.). Their siphon is small,\r\nand in the form of the striae of growth they resemble _Nautili_. Another\r\nextinct generic form of Cephalopod, abounding in the Mountain limestone,\r\nand not found in strata of later date, is the _Bellerophon_ (fig. 394.), of\r\nwhich the shell, like the living Argonaut, was without chambers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 393. _Goniatites evolutus_, Phillips.[342-A]\r\nMountain limestone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 394. _Bellerophon costatus_, Sow.[342-B]\r\nMountain limestone.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[329-A] H.

XXII. that the Carboniferous formation is\r\nsurmounted by one called the \"New Red,\" and underlaid by another called\r\nthe \"Old Red Sandstone.\"[342-C] The British strata of the last mentioned\r\nseries were first recognized in Herefordshire and Scotland as of great\r\nthickness, and immediately subjacent to the coal; but they were in\r\ngeneral so barren of organic remains, that it was difficult to find\r\npaleontological characters of sufficient importance to distinguish them\r\nas an independent group. In Scotland, and on the borders of Wales, the\r\n\"Old Red\" consists chiefly of red sandstone, conglomerate, and shale,\r\nwith few fossils; but limestones of the same age, peculiarly rich in\r\norganic remains, were at length found in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nI shall first advert to the characters of the group as developed in\r\nHerefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire, and South Wales. Its thickness\r\nhas been estimated at 8000 feet, and it has been subdivided into--\r\n\r\n  1st. A quartzose conglomerate passing downwards into chocolate-red and\r\n  green sandstone and marl.\r\n\r\n  2d. Cornstone and marl--red and green argillaceous spotted marls, with\r\n  irregular courses of impure concretionary limestone, provincially\r\n  called Cornstone.\r\n\r\nHere, as usual, fossils are extremely rare in the clays and sandstones in\r\nwhich the red oxide of iron prevails; but remains of fishes of the genera\r\n_Cephalaspis_ and _Onchus_ have been discovered in the Cornstone.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the northern part of Scotland, from Cape Wrath to the\r\nsouthern flank of the Grampians, has been well described by Mr. Miller\r\nas consisting of a nucleus of granite, gneiss, and other hypogene rocks,\r\nwhich seem as if set in a sandstone frame.[343-A] The beds of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone constituting this frame, may once perhaps have extended\r\ncontinuously over the entire Grampians before the upheaval of that\r\nmountain range; for one band of the sandstone follows the course of the\r\nMoray Frith far into the interior of the great Caledonian valley; and\r\ndetached hills and island-like patches occur in several parts of the\r\ninterior, capping some of the higher summits in Sutherlandshire, and\r\nappearing in Morayshire like oases among the granite rocks of\r\nStrathspey. On the western coast of Ross-shire, the Old Red forms those\r\nthree immense insulated hills before described (p. 67.), where beds of\r\nhorizontal sandstone, 3000 feet high, rest unconformably on a base of\r\ngneiss, attesting the vast denudation which has taken place.\r\n\r\nBut in order to observe the uppermost part of the Old Red, we must travel\r\nsouth of the Grampians, and examine its junction with the bottom of the\r\nCarboniferous series in Fifeshire. This upper member may be seen in Dura\r\nDen, south of Cupar, to consist of a belt of yellow sandstone, in which Dr.\r\nFleming first discovered scales of _Holoptychius_, and in which species of\r\nfish of the genera _Pterichthys_, _Pamphractus_, and others, have been met\r\nwith. (For genus _Pterichthys_, see fig. 400. p. 345.)\r\n\r\nThe beds next below the yellow sandstone are well seen in the large zone of\r\nOld Red which skirts the southern flank of the Grampians from Stonehaven to\r\nthe Frith of Clyde. It there forms, together with trap, the Sidlaw Hills\r\nand the strata of the valley of Strathmore. A section of this region has\r\nbeen already given (p. 48.), extending from the foot of the Grampians in\r\nForfarshire to the sea at Arbroath, a distance of about 20 miles, where the\r\nentire series of strata is several thousand feet thick, and may be divided\r\ninto three principal masses: 1st, and uppermost, red and mottled marls,\r\ncornstone, and sandstone (Nos. 1. and 2. of the section); 2d, Conglomerate,\r\noften of vast thickness (No. 3. ibid.); 3d, Roofing and paving stone,\r\nhighly micaceous, and containing a slight admixture of carbonate of lime\r\n(No. 4. ibid.). In the first of these divisions, which may be considered as\r\nsucceeding the yellow sandstone of Fifeshire before mentioned, a gigantic\r\nspecies of fish of the genus _Holoptychius_ has been found at Clashbinnie\r\nnear Perth. Some scales (see fig. 395.) have been seen which measured 3\r\ninches in length by 2-1/2 in breadth.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the next division, or immediately under the conglomerate\r\n(No. 3. p. 48.), there have been found in Forfarshire some remarkable\r\ncrustaceans, with several fish of the genus named by Agassiz _Cephalaspis_,\r\nor \"buckler-headed,\" from the extraordinary shield which covers the head\r\n(see fig. 396.), and which has often been mistaken for that of a trilobite,\r\nof the division _Asaphus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 395. Scale of _Holoptychius nobilissimus_, Agas.\r\nClashbinnie. Nat. size.]\r\n\r\nSpecies of the same genus are considered in England as characteristic of\r\nthe second or Cornstone division (p. 343.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396. _Cephalaspis Lyellii_, Agass.

These scales are generally removed, as in the specimen\r\n       above figured.\r\n  _b, c._ Scales from different parts of the body and tail.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 397. _Eggs of gasteropodous mollusk?_ Lower beds of\r\nOld Red, Ley's Mill, Forfarshire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 398. _Fucoids and eggs of gasteropodous mollusk?_\r\nLower Old Red, Fife.]\r\n\r\nIn the same grey paving-stones and coarse roofing-slates, in which the\r\n_Cephalaspis_ occurs, in Forfarshire and Kincardineshire, the remains of\r\nmarine plants or fucoids abound. They are frequently accompanied by groups\r\nof hexagonal, or nearly hexagonal markings, which consist of small\r\nflattened carbonaceous bodies, placed in a slight depression of the\r\nsandstone or shale. (See figs. 397 and 398.) They much resemble in form the\r\nspawn of the recent Natica (see fig. 399.), in which the eggs are arranged\r\nin a thin layer of sand, and seem to have acquired a polygonal form by\r\npressing against each other. The substance of the egg, if fossilized, might\r\ngive rise to small pellicles of carbonaceous matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 399. Fragment of spawn of British species of _Natica_.]\r\n\r\nThese fossils I have met with, both to the north of Strathmore, in the\r\nvertical shale beneath the conglomerate, and in the same beds in the Sidlaw\r\nhills, at all the points where fig. 4. is introduced in the section, p. 48.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 400. _Pterichthys_, Agassiz; upper side, showing mouth;\r\nas restored by H. Miller.[345-A]]\r\n\r\nBeds of red shale and red sandstone, sometimes associated with\r\npudding-stone (older than No. 3., fig. 62. p. 48.), and destitute of\r\norganic remains, separate, in the region of Strathmore, the above-described\r\nfossiliferous strata from the older crystalline rocks of the Grampians.\r\nBut, in the north of Scotland, we find, at the base of the Old Red, other\r\ngrey slaty sandstones, in the counties of Banff, Nairn, Moray, Cromarty,\r\nCaithness, and in Orkney, rich in ichthyolites of peculiar forms, belonging\r\nto the genera _Pterichthys_ (fig. 400.), _Coccosteus_, _Diplopterus_,\r\n_Dipterus_, _Cheiracanthus_, and others of Agassiz.\r\n\r\nFive species of _Pterichthys_ have been found in this lowest division of\r\nthe Old Red. The wing-like appendages, whence the genus is named, were\r\nfirst supposed by Mr. Miller to be paddles, like those of the turtle;\r\nbut Agassiz regards them as weapons of defence, like the occipital\r\nspines of the River Bull-head (_Cottus gobio_, Linn.); and considers the\r\ntail to have been the only organ of motion. The genera _Dipterus_ and\r\n_Diplopterus_ are so named, because their two dorsal fins are so placed\r\nas to front the anal and ventral fins, so as to appear like two pairs of\r\nwings. They have bony enamelled scales.\r\n\r\n_South Devon and Cornwall._--A great step was made in the classification of\r\nthe slaty and calciferous strata of South Devon and Cornwall in 1837, when\r\na large portion of the beds, previously referred to the \"transition\" or\r\nmost ancient fossiliferous series, were found to belong in reality to the\r\nperiod of the Old Red Sandstone. For this reform we are indebted to the\r\nlabours of Professor Sedgwick and Sir R. Murchison, assisted by a\r\nsuggestion of Mr. Lonsdale, who, in 1837, after examining the South\r\nDevonshire fossils, perceived that some of them agreed with those of the\r\nCarboniferous group, others with those of the Silurian, while many could\r\nnot be assigned to either system, the whole taken together exhibiting a\r\npeculiar and intermediate character. But these paleontological observations\r\nalone would not have enabled us to assign, with accuracy, the true place in\r\nthe geological series of these slate-rocks and limestones of South Devon,\r\nhad not Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison, in 1836 and 1837, discovered that\r\nthe culmiferous or anthracitic shales of North Devon belonged to the Coal,\r\nand not, as preceding observers had imagined, to the transition period.\r\n\r\nAs the strata of South Devon here alluded to are far richer in organic\r\nremains than the red sandstones of contemporaneous date in Herefordshire\r\nand Scotland, the new name of the \"Devonian system\" was proposed as a\r\nsubstitute for that of Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of this group in South Devon consist, in great part, of green\r\nchloritic slates, alternating with hard quartzose slates and sandstones.\r\nHere and there calcareous slates are interstratified with blue crystalline\r\nlimestone, and in some divisions conglomerates, passing into red sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe link supplied by the whole assemblage of imbedded fossils, connecting\r\nas it does the paleontology of the Silurian and Carboniferous groups, is\r\none of the highest interest, and equally striking, whether we regard the\r\n_genera_ of corals or of shells. The _species_ are almost all distinct.\r\n\r\nAmong the more abundant corals, we find the genera _Favosites_ and\r\n_Cyathophyllum_, common on the one hand to the Mountain limestone, and on\r\nthe other to the Silurian system. Some few even of the _species_ are common\r\nto the Devonian and Silurian groups, as, for example, _Favosites\r\npolymorpha_ (fig. 401.), very abundant in South Devon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 401. _Favosites polymorpha_, Goldf., S. Devon.\r\nFrom a polished specimen.\r\n\r\n_a._ portion of the same, magnified to show the pores.]\r\n\r\nThe _Cyathophyllum caespitosum_ (fig. 402.) and _Porites pyriformis_ (fig.\r\n424. p. 356.) are more peculiarly characteristic of the Devonian rocks.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the shells, all the brachiopodous genera, such as\r\n_Terebratula_, _Orthis_, _Spirifer_, _Atrypa_, and _Productus_, which are\r\nfound in the Mountain limestone, occur, together with those of the Silurian\r\nsystem, except the _Pentamerus_. Some forms, however, seem exclusively\r\nDevonian, as for example, _Calceola sandalina_ (fig. 403.) and\r\n_Strygocephalus Burtini_ (fig. 404.), which have been met with both in the\r\nEifel, in Germany, and in Devonshire, in the very lowest Devonian beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 402. Cyathophyllum.\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Cyathophyllum caespitosum_, Goldf., Plymouth.\r\n  _b._ a terminal star.\r\n  _c._ vertical section exhibiting transverse plates, and part of\r\n       another branch.]\r\n\r\nAmong the peculiar lamellibranchiate bivalves, also common to Devonshire\r\nand the Eifel, we find _Megalodon cucullatus_ (fig. 405.). Several spiral\r\nunivalves are abundant, among which are many species of _Pleurotomaria_ and\r\n_Euomphalus_. Among the Cephalopoda we find _Bellerophon_ and _Orthoceras_,\r\nas in the Silurian and Carboniferous groups, and _Goniatite_ and\r\n_Cyrtoceras_, as in the Carboniferous. In some of the upper Devonian beds,\r\na shell, resembling a flattened _Goniatite_, occurs, called _Clymenia_, by\r\nMunster (_Endosiphonites_, Ansted.[347-A]).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 403. _Calceola sandalina_, Lam.

(_Endosiphonites\r\ncarinatus_, Ansted.) Cornwall.]\r\n\r\nA peculiar species of trilobite, called _Brontes flabellifer_ (fig. 407.),\r\nis found in the Devonian strata of the Eifel and in South Devon. It should\r\nbe observed, however, that the head in the specimen here figured by\r\nGoldfuss, the most perfect which could be obtained, is incomplete, and a\r\nrestoration has been attempted by Mr. Salter in fig. 408., from data\r\nsupplied by other species of the same genus occurring in older rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 407. _Brontes flabellifer_, Goldf. Eifel;\r\nalso S. Devon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 408. Restored outline of head of\r\n_Brontes flabellifer_.]\r\n\r\nFor determining the true equivalents of the Devonian group in the Rhenish\r\nprovinces and adjacent parts of Germany, we are indebted to the labours of\r\nMessrs. Sedgwick and Murchison, in 1839, from which it appears that rocks\r\nof that age emerge from beneath the coal-field of Westphalia, and are also\r\nfound in troughs among the Silurian rocks in Nassau. Many of the\r\nlimestones, particularly those on the river Lahn, are identical, both in\r\nstructure and in coralline remains, with the beautiful marbles of\r\nBabbacombe, Torquay, and Plymouth.\r\n\r\nThe limestones of the Eifel, long ago celebrated for their fossils, and\r\nwhich lie in a basin supported by Silurian rocks, are found to be referable\r\nto the lower part of the Devonian system.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, also, Messrs. Murchison and De Verneuil have shown (1840) that\r\nthe \"Old Red\" group occupies a wide area south from St. Petersburg. It was\r\nformerly supposed to be the New Red Sandstone, on account of its saliferous\r\nand gypseous beds; but it is now proved to be the Old Red by containing\r\nichthyolites of genera which characterize this group in the British Isles,\r\nas, for example, _Holoptychius_, _Coccosteus_, _Diplopterus_, &c.[349-A],\r\nassociated with mollusca found in the Devonian of Western Europe. Among the\r\nfish are also many species of sharks of the Cestraciont division, a fact\r\nworthy of notice, because the squaloid fishes of the present day offer the\r\nhighest organization of the brain and of the generative organs, and make,\r\nin these respects, the nearest approach to the higher vertebrate classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Devonian Strata in the United States._\r\n\r\nThe position of this formation between the carboniferous rocks of\r\nPennsylvania and Ohio, is pointed out in the section, fig. 379. p. 327.,\r\nand it is a remark of M. de Verneuil that in no European country is\r\nthere so complete and uninterrupted a development of the Devonian system\r\nas in North America. At the falls of the Ohio, at Louisville, in\r\nKentucky, there is a grand display of one of the limestones of this\r\nperiod, resembling a modern coral reef. A wide extent of surface is\r\nexposed in a series of horizontal ledges, at all seasons, when the water\r\nis not high; and the softer parts of the stone having decomposed and\r\nwasted away, the harder calcareous corals stand out in relief, and many\r\nof them send out branches from their erect stems precisely as if they\r\nwere living. Among other species I observed large masses, not less than\r\n5 feet in diameter, of _Favosites gothlandica_, with its beautiful\r\nhoneycomb structure well displayed, and, by the side of it, the\r\n_Favistella_, combining a similar honeycombed form with the star of the\r\n_Astrea_. There was also the cup-shaped _Cyathophyllum_, and the\r\ndelicate network of the _Fenestella_, and that elegant and well-known\r\nEuropean species of fossil, called \"the chain coral,\" _Catenipora\r\nescharoides_, with a profusion of others (see fig. 423. p. 355.). These\r\ncoralline forms were mingled with the joints, stems, and occasionally\r\nthe heads, of lily encrinites. Although hundreds of fine specimens have\r\nbeen detached from these rocks, to enrich the museums of Europe and\r\nAmerica, another crop is constantly working its way out, under the\r\naction of the stream, and of the sun and rain, in the warm season when\r\nthe channel is laid dry. The waters of the Ohio, when I visited the\r\nspot in April, 1846, were more than 40 feet below their highest level,\r\nand 20 feet above their lowest, so that large spaces of bare rock were\r\nexposed to view.[349-B]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Devonian Flora._\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the fucoids above mentioned (p. 344.), but little\r\nis known with certainty of the plants of the Devonian group. Those found\r\nin the department of La Sarthe in France, and in various parts of\r\nBrittany, formerly referred to the Devonian era, have been shown (in\r\n1850), by M. de Verneuil, to belong to the carboniferous series. The\r\nsame may be said of the species of _Lepidodendron_, _Knorria_,\r\n_Calamite_, _Sagenaria_, and other genera recently figured (1850), by\r\nMr. F. A. Roemer, from the formation called \"Greywacke a Posodonomyes\" in\r\nthe Hartz.[350-A] They are accompanied by _Goniatites reticulatus_\r\nPhillips, _G. intercostatus_ Phil., and other mountain limestone\r\nspecies, and had been previously assigned to the oldest part of the\r\ncarboniferous series by Messrs. Murchison and Sedgwick.\r\n\r\nIf hereafter we should become well acquainted with the land plants of the\r\nDevonian era, we may confidently expect that nearly all of them will agree\r\ngenerically with those of the carboniferous period, but the species will be\r\nas different as are the Devonian vertebrate and invertebrate animals from\r\nthe fossil species of the Coal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[342-C] See section, fig. 318. p. 287.\r\n\r\n[343-A] The Old Red Sandstone, by Hugh Miller, 1841.\r\n\r\n[345-A] Old Red Sandstone.

VIII., pp. 91 and 92. Geologists have also applied to these older\r\nstrata the general name of \"grauwacke,\" by which the German miners\r\ndesignate a particular variety of sandstone, usually an aggregate of small\r\nfragments of quartz, flinty slate (or Lydian stone), and clay-slate\r\ncemented together by argillaceous matter. Far too much importance has been\r\nattached to this kind of rock, as if it belonged to a certain epoch in the\r\nearth's history, whereas a similar sandstone or grit is found sometimes in\r\nthe Old Red, and in the Millstone Grit of the Coal, and sometimes in\r\ncertain Cretaceous and even Eocene formations in the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe name of _Silurian_ was first proposed by Sir Roderick Murchison, for a\r\nseries of fossiliferous strata lying below the Old Red Sandstone, and\r\noccupying that part of Wales and some contiguous counties of England, which\r\nonce constituted the kingdom of the _Silures_, a tribe of ancient Britons.\r\nThe strata have been divided into Upper and Lower Silurian, and these\r\nagain in the region alluded to admit of several well-marked subdivisions,\r\nall of them explained in the following table.\r\n\r\n                         UPPER SILURIAN ROCKS.\r\n\r\n                               Prevailing         Thickness   Organic\r\n                               Lithological       in Feet.

Each of these may be distinguished near\r\nthe town of Ludlow, and at other places in Shropshire and Herefordshire,\r\nby peculiar organic remains.\r\n\r\n1. _Tilestones._--This uppermost division was originally classed by\r\nSir R. Murchison with the Old Red Sandstone, because they decompose\r\ninto a red soil throughout the Silurian region. At the same time he\r\nregarded the tilestones as a transition group forming a passage from\r\nSilurian to Old Red. It is now ascertained that the fossils agree in\r\ngreat part specifically, and in general character entirely, with those\r\nof the succeeding formation.\r\n\r\n2. _Upper Ludlow._--The next division, called the Upper Ludlow, consists of\r\ngrey calcareous sandstone, decomposing into soft mud, and contains, among\r\nother shells, the _Lingula cornea_, which is common to it and the lowest,\r\nor tilestone beds of the Old Red. But the _Orthis orbicularis_ is peculiar\r\nto the Upper Ludlow, and very common; and the lowest or mudstone beds, are\r\nloaded for a thickness of 30 feet with _Terebratula navicula_ (fig. 410.),\r\nin vast numbers. Among the cephalopodous mollusca occur the genera\r\n_Bellerophon_ and _Orthoceras_, and among the crustacea the _Homalonotus_\r\n(fig. 418. p. 354.). A coral called _Favosites polymorpha_, Goldf. (fig.\r\n401. p. 346.) is found both in this subdivision and in the Devonian system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 409. _Orthis orbicularis_, J. Sow. Delbury.\r\nUpper Ludlow.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 410. _Terebratula navicula_, J. Sow. Aymestry\r\nlimestone; also in Upper and Lower Ludlow.]\r\n\r\nAmong the fossil shells are species of _Leptaena_, _Orthis_, _Terebratula_,\r\n_Avicula_, _Trochus_, _Orthoceras_, _Bellerophon_, and others.[352-A]\r\n\r\nSome of the Upper Ludlow sandstones are ripple-marked, thus affording\r\nevidence of gradual deposition; and the same may be said of the\r\naccompanying fine argillaceous shales which are of great thickness, and\r\nhave been provincially named \"mudstones.\" In these shales many zoophytes\r\nare found enveloped in an erect position, having evidently become fossil on\r\nthe spots where they grew at the bottom of the sea. The facility with which\r\nthese rocks, when exposed to the weather, are resolved into mud, proves\r\nthat, notwithstanding their antiquity, they are nearly in the state in\r\nwhich they were first thrown down.\r\n\r\nThe scales, spines (_ichthyodorulites_), jaws, and teeth of fish of the\r\ngenera _Onchus_, _Plectrodus_, and others of the same family, have been met\r\nwith in the Upper Ludlow rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 411. _Pentamerus Knightii_, Sow. Aymestry.\r\n\r\n  _a._ view of both valves united.\r\n  _b._ longitudinal section through both valves, showing the central plate\r\n       or septum; half nat. size.]\r\n\r\n3. _Aymestry limestone._--The next group is a subcrystalline and\r\nargillaceous limestone, which is in some places 50 feet thick, and\r\ndistinguished around Aymestry by the abundance of _Pentamerus Knightii_,\r\nSow. (fig. 411.), also found in the Lower Ludlow. This genus of\r\nbrachiopoda has only been found in the Silurian strata. The name was\r\nderived from +pente+, _pente_, five, and +meros+, _meros_, a part, because\r\nboth valves are divided by a central septum, making four chambers, and in\r\none valve the septum itself contains a small chamber, making five; but\r\nneither the structure of this shell, nor the connection of the animal with\r\nits several parts, are as yet understood. Messrs. Murchison and De Verneuil\r\ndiscovered this species dispersed in myriads through a white limestone\r\nof upper Silurian age, on the banks of the Is, on the eastern flank of\r\nthe Urals in Russia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 412. _Lingula Lewisii_, J. Sow. Abberley Hills.]\r\n\r\nThree other abundant shells in the Aymestry limestone are, 1st, _Lingula\r\nLewisii_ (fig. 412.); 2d, _Terebratula Wilsoni_, Sow. (fig. 413.), which is\r\nalso common to the Lower Ludlow and Wenlock limestone; 3d, _Atrypa\r\nreticularis_, Lin. (fig. 414.), which has a very wide range, being found in\r\nevery part of the Silurian system, except the Llandeilo flags.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 413. _Terebratula Wilsoni_, Sow.

The latter\r\nis partly straight and partly convoluted, nearly as in _Spirula_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 415. _Phragmoceras ventricosum_, J. Sow. (_Orthoceras\r\nventricosum_, Stein.)

Fragments of Orthoceras.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Fragment of _Orthoceras Ludense_, J. Sow.\r\n  _b._ Polished section, showing siphuncle. Ludlow.]\r\n\r\nThe _Orthoceras Ludense_ (fig. 417.), as well as the shell last mentioned,\r\nis peculiar to this member of the series. The _Homalonotus\r\ndelphinocephalus_ (fig. 418.) is common to this division and to the Wenlock\r\nlimestone. This crustacean belongs to a group of trilobites which has been\r\nmet with in the Silurian rocks only, and in which the tripartite character\r\nof the dorsal crust is almost lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 418. _Homalonotus delphinocephalus_, Koenig.[354-A]\r\nDudley Castle; 1/2 nat. size.]\r\n\r\nA species of Graptolite, _G. Ludensis_, Murch. (fig. 419.), a form of\r\nzoophyte which has not yet been met with in strata newer than the Silurian,\r\noccurs in the Lower Ludlow.\r\n\r\n_Wenlock formation._--We next come to the Wenlock formation, which has been\r\ndivided (see Table, p. 351.) into\r\n\r\n1. Wenlock limestone, formerly well known to collectors by the name of the\r\nDudley limestone, which forms a continuous ridge, ranging for about 20\r\nmiles from S.W. to N.E., about a mile distant from the nearly parallel\r\nescarpment of the Aymestry limestone. The prominence of this rock in\r\nShropshire, like that of Aymestry, is due to its solidity, and to the\r\nsoftness of the shales above and below. It is divided into large\r\nconcretional masses of pure limestone, and abounds in trilobites, among\r\nwhich the prevailing species are _Phacops caudatus_ (fig. 422.) and\r\n_Calymene Blumenbachii_, commonly called the Dudley trilobite. The latter\r\nis often found coiled up like a wood-louse (see fig. 420.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 419. _Graptolithus Ludensis_, Murchison. Lower Ludlow.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 420. _Calymene Blumenbachii_, Brong. Wenlock, L.\r\nLudlow, and Aym. limest.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 421. _Leptaena depressa._ Wenlock.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 422. _Phacops caudatus_, Brong. Wenlock, Aym.\r\nlimest., and L. Ludlow.]\r\n\r\n_Leptaena depressa_, Sow., is common in this rock, but also ranges through\r\nthe Lower Ludlow, Wenlock shale, and Caradoc Sandstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 423. _Catenipora escharoides._]\r\n\r\nAmong the corals in which this formation is very rich, the _Catenipora\r\nescharoides_, Lam. (fig. 423.), or chain coral, may be pointed out as\r\none very easily recognized, and widely spread in Europe, ranging\r\nthrough all parts of the Silurian group, from the Aymestry limestone\r\nto the bottom of the series.\r\n\r\nAnother coral, the _Porites pyriformis_, is also met with in profusion; a\r\nspecies common to the Devonian rocks.\r\n\r\n_Cystiphyllum Siluriense_ (fig. 425.) is a species peculiar to the Wenlock\r\nlimestone. This new genus, the name of which is derived from +kystis+, a\r\n_bladder_, and +phyllon+, a _leaf_, was instituted by Mr. Lonsdale for\r\ncorals of the Silurian and Devonian groups. It is composed of small\r\nbladder-like cells (see fig. 425. _b._).\r\n\r\n2. The Wenlock Shale, which exceeds 700 feet in thickness, contains\r\nmany species of brachiopoda, such as a small variety of the _Lingula\r\nLewisii_ (fig. 412.), and the _Atrypa reticularis_ (fig. 414.) before\r\nmentioned, and it will be seen that several other fossils before\r\nenumerated range into this shale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 424. _Porites pyriformis_, Ehren.

The Caradoc sandstone, which abuts against the trappean chain called the\r\nCaradoc Hills, in Shropshire. Its thickness is estimated at 2500 feet, and\r\nthe larger proportion of its fossils are specifically distinct from those\r\nof the Upper Silurian rocks. Among them we find many trilobites and shells\r\nof the genera _Orthoceras_, _Nautilus_, and _Bellerophon_; and among the\r\nBrachiopoda the _Pentamerus oblongus_ and _P. laevis_ (fig. 426.), which are\r\nvery abundant and peculiar to this bed; also _Orthis grandis_ (fig. 427.),\r\nand a fossil of well-defined form, _Tentaculites annulatus_, Schlot. (fig.\r\n428.), which Mr. Salter has shown to be referable to the Annelids and to\r\nthe same tribe as _Serpula_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 426. _Pentamerus laevis_, Sow.

Eastnor Park;\r\nnat. size, and magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe most ancient bony remains of fish yet discovered in Great Britain are\r\nthose obtained from the Wenlock limestones; but coprolites referred to fish\r\noccur still lower in the Silurian series in Wales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 429. _Ogygia Buchii_, Burmeister. Syn. _Asaphus\r\nBuchii_, Brong. 1/4 nat. size. Radnorshire.]\r\n\r\n2. The _Llandeilo flags_, so named from a town in Caermarthenshire, form\r\nthe base of the Silurian system, consisting of dark-coloured micaceous\r\ngrit, frequently calcareous, and distinguished by containing the large\r\ntrilobites _Asaphus Buchii_ and _A. tyrannus_, Murch., both of which are\r\npeculiar to these rocks. Several species of Graptolites (fig. 430.)\r\noccur in these beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 430. _a_, _b_. _Graptolithus Murchisonii_,\r\nBeck. Llandeilo flags.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 431. _G. foliaceus_, _Murchison_. Llandeilo flags.]\r\n\r\nIn the fine shales of this formation Graptolites are very abundant. I\r\ncollected these same bodies in great numbers in Sweden and Norway in\r\n1835-6, both in the higher and lower shales of the Silurian system; and\r\nwas informed by Dr. Beck of Copenhagen, that they were fossil zoophytes\r\nrelated to the genera _Pennatula_ and _Virgularia_, of which the living\r\nspecies now inhabit mud and slimy sediment. The most eminent naturalists\r\nstill hold to this opinion.\r\n\r\nA species of _Lingula_ is met with in the lowest part of the Llandeilo\r\nbeds; and it is remarkable that this brachiopod is among the earliest, if\r\nnot the most ancient animal form detected in the lowest Silurian of North\r\nAmerica. These inhabitants of the seas, of so remote an epoch, belonged so\r\nstrictly to the living genus _Lingula_, as to demonstrate, like the\r\npteriform ferns of the coal, through what incalculable periods of time the\r\nsame plan and type of organization has sometimes prevailed.\r\n\r\nAmong the forms of trilobite extremely characteristic of the Lower Silurian\r\nthroughout Europe and North America, the _Trinucleus_ may be mentioned.\r\nThis family of crustaceans appears to have swarmed in the Silurian seas,\r\njust as crabs, shrimps, and other genera of crustaceans abound in our own.\r\nBurmeister, in his work on the organization of trilobites, supposes them to\r\nhave swum at the surface of the water in the open sea and near coasts,\r\nfeeding on smaller marine animals, and to have had the power of rolling\r\nthemselves into a ball as a defence against injury. They underwent various\r\ntransformations analogous to those of living crustaceans. M. Barrande,\r\nauthor of a work on the Silurian rocks of Bohemia, has traced the same\r\nspecies from the young state just after its escape from the egg to the\r\nadult form, through various metamorphoses, each having the appearance of a\r\ndistinct species. Yet, notwithstanding the numerous species of preceding\r\nnaturalists which he has thus succeeded in uniting into one, he announces a\r\nforthcoming work in which descriptions and figures of 250 species of\r\nTrilobite will be given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 432. _Trinucleus ornatus_, Burm.]\r\n\r\n_Cystideae._--Among the additions which recent research has made to the\r\npaleontology of the oldest Silurian rocks, none are more remarkable than\r\nthe radiated animals called _Cystideae_. Their structure and relations were\r\nfirst elucidated in an essay published by Von Buch at Berlin in 1845. They\r\nare usually met with as spheroidal bodies covered with polygonal plates,\r\nwith a mouth on the upper side, and a point of attachment for a stem _b_\r\n(which is almost always broken off) on the lower. (See fig. 433.) They are\r\nconsidered by Professor E. Forbes as intermediate between the crinoids and\r\nechinoderms. The _Sphaeronites_ here represented (fig. 433.) occurs in the\r\nLlandeilo beds in Wales.[358-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 433. _Sphaeronites balticus_, Eichwald. (Of the\r\nfamily _Cystideae_.)\r\n\r\n  _a._ mouth.\r\n  _b._ point of attachment of stem.\r\n\r\nLower Silurian, Shole's Hook and Bala.]\r\n\r\n_Thickness and unconformability of Silurian strata._--According to the\r\nobservation of our government surveyors in North Wales, the Lower Silurian\r\nstrata of that region attain, in conjunction with the contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic rocks, the extraordinary thickness of 27,000 feet. One of the\r\ngroups, called the trappean, consisting of slates and associated volcanic\r\nash and greenstone, is 15,000 feet thick. Another series, called the Bala\r\ngroup, composed of slates and grits with an impure limestone rich in\r\norganic remains, is 9,000 feet thick.[359-A]\r\n\r\nThroughout North Wales the Wenlock shales rest unconformably upon the\r\nCaradoc sandstones; and the Caradoc is in its turn unconformable to the\r\nLlandeilo beds, showing a considerable interval of time between the\r\ndeposition of this group and that of the formations next above and below\r\nit. The Caradoc sandstone in the neighbourhood of the Longmynd Hills in\r\nShropshire, appears to Professor E. Forbes to have been a deep-sea deposit\r\nformed around the margin of high and steep land. That land consisted partly\r\nof upraised Llandeilo flags and partly of rocks of still older date.[359-B]\r\n\r\nSuch evidence of the successive disturbance of strata during the Silurian\r\nperiod in Great Britain is what we might look for when we have discovered\r\nthe signs of so grand a series of volcanic eruptions as the contemporaneous\r\ngreenstones and tuffs of the Welsh mountains afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Silurian Strata of the United States._\r\n\r\nThe position of some of these strata, where they are bent and highly\r\ninclined in the Appalachian chain, or where they are nearly horizontal\r\nto the west of that chain, is shown in the section, fig. 379. p. 327.\r\nBut these formations can be studied still more advantageously north of\r\nthe same line of section, in the states of New York, Ohio, and other\r\nregions north and south of the great Canadian lakes. Here they are\r\nfound, as in Russia, in horizontal position, and are more rich in\r\nwell-preserved fossils than in almost any spot in Europe. The American\r\nstrata may readily be divided into Upper and Lower Silurian,\r\ncorresponding in age and fossils to the European divisions bearing the\r\nsame names. The subordinate members of the New York series, founded on\r\nlithological and geographical considerations, are most useful in the\r\nUnited States, but even there are only of local importance. Some few of\r\nthem, however, tally very exactly with English divisions, as for example\r\nthe limestone, over which the Niagara is precipitated at the great\r\ncataract, which, with its underlying shales, agrees paleontologically\r\nwith the Wenlock limestone and shale of Siluria. There is also a marked\r\ngeneral correspondence in the succession of fossil forms, and even\r\nspecies, as we trace the organic remains downwards from the highest\r\nto the lowest beds.\r\n\r\nMr. D. Sharpe, in his report on the mollusca collected by me from these\r\nstrata in North America[359-C], has concluded that the number of species\r\ncommon to the Silurian rocks, on both sides of the Atlantic, is between 30\r\nand 40 per cent.; a result which, although no doubt liable to future\r\nmodification, when a larger comparison shall have been made, proves,\r\nnevertheless, that many of the species had a wide geographical range. It\r\nseems that comparatively few of the gasteropods and lamellibranchiate\r\nbivalves of North America can be identified specifically with European\r\nfossils, while no less than two-fifths of the brachiopoda are the same. In\r\nexplanation of these facts, it is suggested, that most of the recent\r\nbrachiopoda (especially the orthidiform ones) are inhabitants of deep\r\nwater, and may have had a wider geographical range than shells living near\r\nshore. The predominance of bivalve mollusca of this peculiar class has\r\ncaused the Silurian period to be sometimes styled the age of brachiopods.\r\n\r\n_Whether the Silurian rocks are of deep-water origin._--The grounds relied\r\nupon by Professor E. Forbes, for inferring that the larger part of the\r\nSilurian Fauna is indicative of a sea more than 70 fathoms deep, are the\r\nfollowing: first, the small size of the greater number of conchifera;\r\nsecondly, the paucity of pectinibranchiata (or spiral univalves); thirdly,\r\nthe great number of floaters, such as _Bellerophon_, _Orthoceras_, &c.;\r\nfourthly, the abundance of orthidiform brachiopoda; fifthly, the absence or\r\ngreat rarity of fossil fish.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true that some living _Terebratulae_, on the coast of\r\nAustralia, inhabit shallow water; but all the known species, allied in\r\nform to the extinct _Orthis_, inhabit the depths of the sea. It should\r\nalso be remarked that Mr. Forbes, in advocating these views, was well\r\naware of the existence of shores, bounding the Silurian sea in\r\nShropshire, and of the occurrence of littoral species of this early date\r\nin the northern hemisphere. Such facts are not inconsistent with his\r\ntheory; for he has shown, in another work, how, on the coast of Lycia,\r\ndeep-sea strata are at present forming in the Mediterranean, in the\r\nvicinity of high and steep land.\r\n\r\nHad we discovered the ancient delta of some large Silurian river, we should\r\ndoubtless have known more of the shallow, and brackish water, and\r\nfluviatile animals, and of the terrestrial flora of the period under\r\nconsideration. To assume that there were no such deltas in the Silurian\r\nworld, would be almost as gratuitous an hypothesis, as for the inhabitants\r\nof the coral islands of the Pacific to indulge in a similar generalization\r\nrespecting the actual condition of the globe.[360-A]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mineral Character of Silurian Strata._\r\n\r\nIn lithological character, the Silurian strata vary greatly when we\r\ntrace them through Europe and North America. The shales called\r\nmudstones are as little altered from some deposits, found in recent\r\nsubmarine banks, as are those of many tertiary formations. We meet\r\nwith red sandstone and red marl, with gypsum and salt, of Upper\r\nSilurian date, in the Niagara district, which might be mistaken for\r\ntrias. The whitish granular sandstone at the base of the Silurian series\r\nin Sweden resembles the tertiary siliceous grit of Fontainebleau. The\r\nCalcareous Grit, oolite, and pisolite of Upper Silurian age in\r\nGothland, are described by Sir R. Murchison as singularly like rocks\r\nof the oolitic period near Cheltenham; and, not to cite more examples,\r\nthe Wenlock or Dudley limestone often resembles a modern coral-reef. If,\r\ntherefore, uniformity of aspect has been thought characteristic of rocks\r\nof this age, the idea must have arisen from the similarity of feature\r\nacquired by strata subject to metamorphic action. This influence, seeing\r\nthat the causes of change are always shifting the theatre of their\r\nprincipal development, must be multiplied throughout a wider\r\ngeographical area by time, and become more general in any given system\r\nof rocks in proportion to their antiquity. We are now acquainted with\r\ndense groups of Eocene slates in the Alps, which were once mistaken by\r\nexperienced geologists for Transition or Silurian formations. The error\r\narose from attaching too great importance to mineral character as a\r\ntest of age, for the tertiary slates in question having acquired that\r\ncrystalline texture which is in reality most prevalent in the most\r\nancient sedimentary formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIAN GROUP.\r\n\r\nBelow the Silurian strata in North Wales, and in the region of the\r\nCumberland lakes, there are some slaty rocks, devoid of organic remains, or\r\nin which a few obscure traces only of fossils have been detected (for which\r\nthe names of Cambrian and Cumbrian have been proposed). Whether these will\r\never be entitled by the specific distinctness of their fossils to rank as\r\nindependent groups, we have not yet sufficient data to determine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTABULAR VIEW OF FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA,\r\n\r\n_Showing the Order of Superposition or Chronological Succession of the\r\nprincipal European Groups_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         I.

Suppose _a a_ in the annexed diagram, to represent the\r\ncrystalline formations, such as the granitic and metamorphic; _b b_ the\r\nfossiliferous strata; and _c c_ the volcanic rocks. These last are\r\nsometimes found, as was explained in the first chapter, breaking through\r\n_a_ and _b_, sometimes overlying both, and occasionally alternating with\r\nthe strata _b b_. They also are seen, in some instances, to pass insensibly\r\ninto the unstratified division of _a_, or the Plutonic rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 434. Cross section.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Hypogene formations, stratified and unstratified.\r\n  _b._ Aqueous formations.\r\n  _c._ Volcanic rocks.]\r\n\r\nWhen geologists first began to examine attentively the structure of the\r\nnorthern and western parts of Europe, they were almost entirely ignorant of\r\nthe phenomena of existing volcanos. They also found certain rocks, for the\r\nmost part without stratification, and of a peculiar mineral composition, to\r\nwhich they gave different names, such as basalt, greenstone, porphyry, and\r\namygdaloid. All these, which were recognized as belonging to one family,\r\nwere called \"trap\" by Bergmann, from _trappa_, Swedish for a flight of\r\nsteps--a name since adopted very generally into the nomenclature of the\r\nscience; for it was observed that many rocks of this class occurred in\r\ngreat tabular masses of unequal extent, so as to form a succession of\r\nterraces or steps on the sides of hills. This configuration appears to be\r\nderived from two causes. First, the abrupt original terminations of sheets\r\nof melted matter, which have spread, whether on the land or bottom of the\r\nsea, over a level surface. For we know, in the case of lava flowing from a\r\nvolcano, that a stream, when it has ceased to flow, and grown solid, very\r\ncommonly ends in a steep slope, as at _a_, fig. 435. But, secondly, the\r\nstep-like appearance arises more frequently from the mode in which\r\nhorizontal masses of igneous rock, such as _b c_, intercalated between\r\naqueous strata, have, subsequently to their origin, been exposed, at\r\ndifferent heights, by denudation. Such an outline, it is true, is not\r\npeculiar to trap rocks; great beds of limestone, and other hard kinds of\r\nstone, often presenting similar terraces and precipices: but these are\r\nusually on a smaller scale, or less numerous, than the volcanic _steps_, or\r\nform less decided features in the landscape, as being less distinct in\r\nstructure and composition from the associated rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 435. Step-like appearance of trap.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the characters of trap rocks are greatly diversified, the\r\nbeginner will easily learn to distinguish them as a class from the\r\naqueous formations. Sometimes they present themselves, as already\r\nstated, in tabular masses, which are not divided into strata: sometimes\r\nin shapeless lumps and irregular cones, forming chains of small hills.\r\nOften they are seen in dikes and wall-like masses, intersecting\r\nfossiliferous beds. The rock is occasionally found divided into columns,\r\noften decomposing into balls of various sizes, from a few inches to\r\nseveral feet in diameter. The decomposing surface very commonly assumes\r\na coating of a rusty iron colour, from the oxidation of ferruginous\r\nmatter, so abundant in the traps in which augite or hornblende occur;\r\nor, in the felspathic varieties of trap, it acquires a white opaque\r\ncoating, from the bleaching of the mineral called felspar. On examining\r\nany of these volcanic rocks, where they have not suffered\r\ndisintegration, we rarely fail to detect a crystalline arrangement in\r\none or more of the component minerals. Sometimes the texture of the mass\r\nis cellular or porous, or we perceive that it has once been full of\r\npores and cells, which have afterwards become filled with carbonate of\r\nlime, or other infiltrated mineral.\r\n\r\nMost of the volcanic rocks produce a fertile soil by their disintegration.\r\nIt seems that their component ingredients, silica, alumina, lime, potash,\r\niron, and the rest, are in proportions well fitted for vegetation. As they\r\ndo not effervesce with acids, a deficiency of calcareous matter might at\r\nfirst be suspected; but although _the carbonate_ of lime is rare, except in\r\nthe nodules of amygdaloids, yet it will be seen that lime sometimes enters\r\nlargely into the composition of augite and hornblende. (See Table, p. 377.)\r\n\r\n_Cones and Craters._--In regions where the eruption of volcanic matter\r\nhas taken place in the open air, and where the surface has never since\r\nbeen subjected to great aqueous denudation, cones and craters constitute\r\nthe most striking peculiarity of this class of formations. Many hundreds\r\nof these cones are seen in central France, in the ancient provinces of\r\nAuvergne, Velay, and Vivarais, where they observe, for the most part, a\r\nlinear arrangement, and form chains of hills. Although none of the\r\neruptions have happened within the historical era, the streams of lava\r\nmay still be traced distinctly descending from many of the craters, and\r\nfollowing the lowest levels of the existing valleys. The origin of the\r\ncone and crater-shaped hill is well understood, the growth of many\r\nhaving been watched during volcanic eruptions. A chasm or fissure first\r\nopens in the earth, from which great volumes of steam and other gases\r\nare evolved. The explosions are so violent as to hurl up into the air\r\nfragments of broken stone, parts of which are shivered into minute\r\natoms. At the same time melted stone or _lava_ usually ascends through\r\nthe chimney or vent by which the gases make their escape. Although\r\nextremely heavy, this lava is forced up by the expansive power of\r\nentangled gaseous fluids, chiefly steam or aqueous vapour, exactly in\r\nthe same manner as water is made to boil over the edge of a vessel when\r\nsteam has been generated at the bottom by heat. Large quantities of the\r\nlava are also shot up into the air, where it separates into fragments,\r\nand acquires a spongy texture by the sudden enlargement of the included\r\ngases, and thus forms _scoriae_, other portions being reduced to an\r\nimpalpable powder or dust. The showering down of the various ejected\r\nmaterials round the orifice of eruption gives rise to a conical mound,\r\nin which the successive envelopes of sand and scoriae form layers,\r\ndipping on all sides from a central axis. In the mean time a hollow,\r\ncalled a _crater_, has been kept open in the middle of the mound by the\r\ncontinued passage upwards of steam and other gaseous fluids. The lava\r\nsometimes flows over the edge of the crater, and thus thickens and\r\nstrengthens the sides of the cone; but sometimes it breaks it down on\r\none side, and often it flows out from a fissure at the base of the\r\nhill (see fig. 436.).[368-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 436. Part of the chain of extinct volcanos called the\r\nMonts Dome, Auvergne. (Scrope.)]\r\n\r\n_Composition and nomenclature._--Before speaking of the connection between\r\nthe products of modern volcanos and the rocks usually styled trappean, and\r\nbefore describing the external forms of both, and the manner and position\r\nin which they occur in the earth's crust, it will be desirable to treat of\r\ntheir mineral composition and names. The varieties most frequently spoken\r\nof are basalt, greenstone, syenitic greenstone, clinkstone, claystone, and\r\ntrachyte; while those founded chiefly on peculiarities of texture, are\r\nporphyry, amygdaloid, lava, tuff, scoriae, and pumice. It may be stated\r\ngenerally, that all these are mainly composed of two minerals, or families\r\nof simple minerals, _felspar_ and _hornblende_; some almost entirely of\r\nhornblende, others of felspar.\r\n\r\nThese two minerals may be regarded as two groups, rather than species.\r\nFelspar, for example, may be, first, common felspar, that is to say,\r\npotash-felspar, in which the alkali is potash (see table, p. 377.); or,\r\nsecondly, albite, that is to say, soda-felspar, where the alkali is soda\r\ninstead of potash; or, thirdly, Labrador-felspar (Labradorite), which\r\ndiffers not only in its iridescent hues, but also in its angle of\r\nfracture or cleavage, and its composition. We also read much of two\r\nother kinds, called glassy felspar and compact felspar, which, however,\r\ncannot rank as varieties of equal importance, for both the albitic and\r\ncommon felspar appear sometimes in transparent or _glassy_ crystals; and\r\nas to compact felspar, it is a compound of a less definite nature,\r\nsometimes containing both soda and potash; and which might be called a\r\nfelspathic paste, being the residuary matter after portions of the\r\noriginal matrix have crystallized.\r\n\r\nThe other group, or _hornblende_, consists principally of two varieties;\r\nfirst, hornblende, and, secondly, augite, which were once regarded as very\r\ndistinct, although now some eminent mineralogists are in doubt whether they\r\nare not one and the same mineral, differing only as one crystalline form of\r\nnative sulphur differs from another.\r\n\r\nThe history of the changes of opinion on this point is curious and\r\ninstructive. Werner first distinguished augite from hornblende; and his\r\nproposal to separate them obtained afterwards the sanction of Hauey,\r\nMohs, and other celebrated mineralogists. It was agreed that the form of\r\nthe crystals of the two species were different, and their structure, as\r\nshown by _cleavage_, that is to say, by breaking or cleaving the mineral\r\nwith a chisel, or a blow of the hammer, in the direction in which it\r\nyields most readily. It was also found by analysis that augite usually\r\ncontained more lime, less alumina, and no fluoric acid; which last,\r\nthough not always found in hornblende, often enters into its composition\r\nin minute quantity. In addition to these characters, it was remarked as\r\na geological fact, that augite and hornblende are very rarely associated\r\ntogether in the same rock; and that when this happened, as in some lavas\r\nof modern date, the hornblende occurs in the mass of the rock, where\r\ncrystallization may have taken place more slowly, while the augite\r\nmerely lines cavities where the crystals may have been produced rapidly.\r\nIt was also remarked, that in the crystalline slags of furnaces, augitic\r\nforms were frequent, the hornblendic entirely absent; hence it was\r\nconjectured that hornblende might be the result of slow, and augite of\r\nrapid cooling. This view was confirmed by the fact, that Mitscherlich\r\nand Berthier were able to make augite artificially, but could never\r\nsucceed in forming hornblende. Lastly, Gustavus Rose fused a mass of\r\nhornblende in a porcelain furnace, and found that it did not, on\r\ncooling, assume its previous shape, but invariably took that of\r\naugite. The same mineralogist observed certain crystals in rocks from\r\nSiberia which presented a hornblende _cleavage_, while they had the\r\nexternal form of augite.\r\n\r\nIf, from these data, it is inferred that the same substance may assume\r\nthe crystalline forms of hornblende or augite indifferently, according\r\nto the more or less rapid cooling of the melted mass, it is\r\nnevertheless certain that the variety commonly called augite, and\r\nrecognized by a peculiar crystalline form, has usually more lime in it,\r\nand less alumina, than that called hornblende, although the quantities\r\nof these elements do not seem to be always the same. Unquestionably the\r\nfacts and experiments above mentioned show the very near affinity of\r\nhornblende and augite; but even the convertibility of one into the other\r\nby melting and recrystallizing, does not perhaps demonstrate their\r\nabsolute identity. For there is often some portion of the materials in\r\na crystal which are not in perfect chemical combination with the rest.\r\nCarbonate of lime, for example, sometimes carries with it a considerable\r\nquantity of silex into its own form of crystal, the silex being\r\nmechanically mixed as sand, and yet not preventing the carbonate of\r\nlime from assuming the form proper to it. This is an extreme case,\r\nbut in many others some one or more of the ingredients in a crystal\r\nmay be excluded from perfect chemical union; and, after fusion, when\r\nthe mass recrystallizes, the same elements may combine perfectly or\r\nin new proportions, and thus a new mineral may be produced. Or some\r\none of the gaseous elements of the atmosphere, the oxygen for example,\r\nmay, when the melted matter reconsolidates, combine with some one of\r\nthe component elements.\r\n\r\nThe different quantity of the impurities or refuse above alluded to, which\r\nmay occur in all but the most transparent and perfect crystals, may partly\r\nexplain the discordant results at which experienced chemists have arrived\r\nin their analysis of the same mineral. For the reader will find that a\r\nmineral determined to be the same by its physical characters, crystalline\r\nform, and optical properties, has often been declared by skilful analyzers\r\nto be composed of distinct elements. (See the table at p. 377.) This\r\ndisagreement seemed at first subversive of the atomic theory, or the\r\ndoctrine that there is a fixed and constant relation between the\r\ncrystalline form and structure of a mineral, and its chemical composition.\r\nThe apparent anomaly, however, which threatened to throw the whole science\r\nof mineralogy into confusion, was in a great degree reconciled to fixed\r\nprinciples by the discoveries of Professor Mitscherlich at Berlin, who\r\nascertained that the composition of the minerals which had appeared so\r\nvariable, was governed by a general law, to which he gave the name of\r\n_isomorphism_ (from +isos+, _isos_, equal, and +morphe+, _morphe_, form).\r\nAccording to this law, the ingredients of a given species of mineral are\r\nnot absolutely fixed as to their kind and quality; but one ingredient may\r\nbe replaced by an equivalent portion of some analogous ingredient. Thus, in\r\naugite, the lime may be in part replaced by portions of protoxide of iron,\r\nor of manganese, while the form of the crystal, and the angle of its\r\ncleavage planes, remain the same. These vicarious substitutions, however,\r\nof particular elements cannot exceed certain defined limits.\r\n\r\nHaving been led into this digression on the recent progress of mineralogy,\r\nI may here observe that the geological student must endeavour as soon as\r\npossible to familiarize himself with the characters of five at least of\r\nthe most abundant simple minerals of which rocks are composed. These are,\r\nfelspar, quartz, mica, hornblende, and carbonate of lime. This knowledge\r\ncannot be acquired from books, but requires personal inspection, and the\r\naid of a teacher. It is well to accustom the eye to know the appearance of\r\nrocks under the lens. To learn to distinguish felspar from quartz is the\r\nmost important step to be first aimed at. In general we may know the\r\nfelspar because it can be scratched with the point of a knife, whereas the\r\nquartz, from its extreme hardness, receives no impression. But when these\r\ntwo minerals occur in a granular and uncrystallized state, the young\r\ngeologist must not be discouraged if, after considerable practice, he often\r\nfails to distinguish them by the eye alone. If the felspar is in crystals,\r\nit is easily recognized by its cleavage: but when in grains the blow-pipe\r\nmust be used, for the edges of the grains can be rounded in the flame,\r\nwhereas those of _quartz_ are infusible. If the geologist is desirous of\r\ndistinguishing the three varieties of felspar above enumerated, or\r\nhornblende from augite, it will often be necessary to use the reflecting\r\ngoniometer as a test of the angle of cleavage, and shape of the crystal.\r\nThe use of this instrument will not be found difficult.\r\n\r\nThe external characters and composition of the felspars are extremely\r\ndifferent from those of augite or hornblende; so that the volcanic rocks in\r\nwhich either of these minerals decidedly predominates, are easily\r\nrecognized. But there are mixtures of the two elements in every possible\r\nproportion, the mass being sometimes exclusively composed of felspar, at\r\nother times solely of augite, or, again, of both in equal quantities.\r\nOccasionally, the two extremes, and all the intermediate gradations, may be\r\ndetected in one continuous mass. Nevertheless there are certain varieties\r\nor compounds which prevail so largely in nature, and preserve so much\r\nuniformity of aspect and composition, that it is useful in geology to\r\nregard them as distinct rocks, and to assign names to them, such as basalt,\r\ngreenstone, trachyte, and others, already mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Basalt._--As an example of rocks in which augite greatly prevails, basalt\r\nmay first be mentioned. Although we are more familiar with this term than\r\nwith that of any other kind of trap, it is difficult to define it, the name\r\nhaving been used so vaguely. It has been very generally applied to any trap\r\nrock of a black, bluish, or leaden-grey colour, having a uniform and\r\ncompact texture. Most strictly, it consists of an intimate mixture of\r\naugite, felspar, and iron, to which a mineral of an olive green colour,\r\ncalled olivine, is often superadded, in distinct grains or nodular masses.\r\nThe iron is usually magnetic, and is often accompanied by another metal,\r\ntitanium. Augite is the predominant mineral, the felspar being in much\r\nsmaller proportions. There is no doubt that many of the fine-grained and\r\ndark-coloured trap rocks, called basalt, contained hornblende in the place\r\nof augite; but this will be deemed of small importance after the remarks\r\nabove made. Other minerals are occasionally found in basalt; and this rock\r\nmay pass insensibly into almost every variety of trap, especially into\r\ngreenstone, clinkstone, and wacke, which will be presently described.\r\n\r\n_Greenstone_, or _Dolerite_, is usually defined as a granular rock, the\r\nconstituent parts of which are hornblende and imperfectly crystallized\r\nfelspar; the felspar being more abundant than in basalt; and the grains or\r\ncrystals of the two minerals more distinct from each other. This name may\r\nalso be extended to those rocks in which augite is substituted for\r\nhornblende (the dolorite of some authors), or to those in which albite\r\nreplaces common felspar, forming the rock sometimes called Andesite.\r\n\r\n_Syenitic greenstone._--The highly crystalline compounds of the same two\r\nminerals, felspar and hornblende, having a granitiform texture, and\r\nwith occasionally some quartz accompanying, may be called Syenitic\r\ngreenstone, a rock which frequently passes into ordinary trap, and\r\nas frequently into granite.\r\n\r\n_Trachyte._--A porphyritic rock of a whitish or greyish colour, composed\r\nprincipally of glassy felspar, with crystals of the same, generally with\r\nsome hornblende and some titaniferous iron. In composition it is extremely\r\ndifferent from basalt, this being a felspathic, as the other is an augitic,\r\nrock. It has a peculiar rough feel, whence the name +trachys+, _trachus_,\r\nrough. Some varieties of trachyte contain crystals of quartz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 437. Porphyry.\r\n\r\nWhite crystals of felspar in a dark base of hornblende and felspar.]\r\n\r\n_Porphyry_ is merely a certain form of rock, very characteristic of the\r\nvolcanic formations. When distinct crystals of one or more minerals are\r\nscattered through an earthy or compact base, the rock is termed a porphyry\r\n(see fig. 437.). Thus trachyte is porphyritic; for in it, as in many modern\r\nlavas, there are crystals of felspar; but in some porphyries the crystals\r\nare of augite, olivine, or other minerals. If the base be greenstone,\r\nbasalt, or pitchstone, the rock may be denominated greenstone-porphyry,\r\npitchstone-porphyry, and so forth.\r\n\r\n_Amygdaloid._--This is also another form of igneous rock, admitting of\r\nevery variety of composition. It comprehends any rock in which round or\r\nalmond-shaped nodules of some mineral, such as agate, calcedony, calcareous\r\nspar, or zeolite, are scattered through a base of wacke, basalt,\r\ngreenstone, or other kind of trap. It derives its name from the Greek word\r\n_amygdala_, an almond. The origin of this structure cannot be doubted, for\r\nwe may trace the process of its formation in modern lavas. Small pores or\r\ncells are caused by bubbles of steam and gas confined in the melted matter.\r\nAfter or during consolidation, these empty spaces are gradually filled up\r\nby matter separating from the mass, or infiltered by water permeating the\r\nrock. As these bubbles have been sometimes lengthened by the flow of the\r\nlava before it finally cooled, the contents of such cavities have the form\r\nof almonds. In some of the amygdaloidal traps of Scotland, where the\r\nnodules have decomposed, the empty cells are seen to have a glazed or\r\nvitreous coating, and in this respect exactly resemble scoriaceous lavas,\r\nor the slags of furnaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 438. Scoriaceous lava in part converted into\r\nan amygdaloid.\r\n\r\nMontagne de la Veille, Department of Puy de Dome, France.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed figure represents a fragment of stone taken from the upper part\r\nof a sheet of basaltic lava in Auvergne. One half is scoriaceous, the pores\r\nbeing perfectly empty; the other part is amygdaloidal, the pores or cells\r\nbeing mostly filled up with carbonate of lime, forming white kernels.\r\n\r\n_Scoriae_ and _Pumice_ may next be mentioned as porous rocks, produced by\r\nthe action of gases on materials melted by volcanic heat. _Scoriae_ are\r\nusually of a reddish-brown and black colour, and are the cinders and slags\r\nof basaltic or augitic lavas. _Pumice_ is a light, spongy, fibrous\r\nsubstance, produced by the action of gases on trachytic and other lavas;\r\nthe relation, however, of its origin to the composition of lava is not yet\r\nwell understood. Von Buch says that it never occurs where only\r\nLabrador-felspar is present.\r\n\r\n_Lava._--This term has a somewhat vague signification, having been applied\r\nto all melted matter observed to flow in streams from volcanic vents. When\r\nthis matter consolidates in the open air, the upper part is usually\r\nscoriaceous, and the mass becomes more and more stony as we descend, or in\r\nproportion as it has consolidated more slowly and under greater pressure.\r\nAt the bottom, however, of a stream of lava, a small portion of scoriaceous\r\nrock very frequently occurs, formed by the first thin sheet of liquid\r\nmatter, which often precedes the main current, or in consequence of the\r\ncontact with water in or upon the damp soil.\r\n\r\nThe more compact lavas are often porphyritic, but even the scoriaceous part\r\nsometimes contains imperfect crystals, which have been derived from some\r\nolder rocks, in which the crystals pre-existed, but were not melted, as\r\nbeing more infusible in their nature.\r\n\r\nAlthough melted matter rising in a crater, and even that which enters rents\r\non the side of a crater, is called lava, yet this term belongs more\r\nproperly to that which has flowed either in the open air or on the bed of a\r\nlake or sea. If the same fluid has not reached the surface, but has been\r\nmerely injected into fissures below ground, it is called trap.\r\n\r\nThere is every variety of composition in lavas; some are trachytic, as in\r\nthe Peak of Teneriffe; a great number are basaltic, as in Vesuvius and\r\nAuvergne; others are andesitic, as those of Chili; some of the most modern\r\nin Vesuvius consist of green augite, and many of those of Etna of augite\r\nand Labrador-felspar.[374-A]\r\n\r\n_Trap tuff, volcanic tuff._--Small angular fragments of the scoriae and\r\npumice, above mentioned, and the dust of the same, produced by volcanic\r\nexplosions, form the tuffs which abound in all regions of active\r\nvolcanos, where showers of these materials, together with small pieces\r\nof other rocks ejected from the crater, fall down upon the land or into\r\nthe sea. Here they often become mingled with shells, and are stratified.\r\nSuch tuffs are sometimes bound together by a calcareous cement, and form\r\na stone susceptible of a beautiful polish. But even when little or no\r\nlime is present, there is a great tendency in the materials of ordinary\r\ntuffs to cohere together.\r\n\r\nBesides the peculiarity of their composition, some tuffs, or _volcanic\r\ngrits_, as they have been termed, differ from ordinary sandstones by\r\nthe angularity of their grains. When the fragments are coarse, the\r\nrock is styled a volcanic _breccia_. _Tufaceous conglomerates_ result\r\nfrom the intermixture of rolled fragments or pebbles of volcanic and\r\nother rocks with tuff.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Scrope, the Italian geologists confine the term\r\n_tuff_, or tufa, to felspathose mixtures, and those composed\r\nprincipally of pumice, using the term _peperino_ for the basaltic\r\ntuffs.[374-B] The peperinos thus distinguished are usually brown,\r\nand the tuffs grey or white.\r\n\r\nWe meet occasionally with extremely compact beds of volcanic materials,\r\ninterstratified with fossiliferous rocks. These may sometimes be tuffs,\r\nalthough their density or compactness is such as to cause them to resemble\r\nmany of those kinds of trap which are found in ordinary dikes. The\r\nchocolate-coloured mud, which was poured for weeks out of the crater of\r\nGraham's Island, in the Mediterranean, in 1831, must, when unmixed with\r\nother materials, have constituted a stone heavier than granite. Each cubic\r\ninch of the impalpable powder which has fallen for days through the\r\natmosphere, during some modern eruptions, has been found to weigh, without\r\nbeing compressed, as much as ordinary trap rocks, and to be often identical\r\nwith these in mineral composition.\r\n\r\nThe fusibility of the igneous rocks generally exceeds that of other rocks,\r\nfor there is much alkaline matter and lime in their composition, which\r\nserves as a flux to the large quantity of silica, which would be otherwise\r\nso refractory an ingredient.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, notwithstanding the abundance of this silica,\r\nquartz, that is, crystalline silica, is usually wanting in the volcanic\r\nrocks, or is present only as an occasional mineral, like mica. The elements\r\nof mica, as of quartz, occur in lava and trap; but the circumstances under\r\nwhich these rocks are formed are evidently unfavourable to the development\r\nof mica and quartz, minerals so characteristic of the hypogene formations.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to enumerate all the varieties of trap and lava which\r\nhave been regarded by different observers as sufficiently abundant to\r\ndeserve distinct names, especially as each investigator is too apt to\r\nexaggerate the importance of local varieties which happen to prevail in\r\ndistricts best known to him. It will be useful, however, to subjoin here,\r\nin the form of a glossary, an alphabetical list of the names and synonyms\r\nmost commonly in use, with brief explanations, to which I have added a\r\ntable of the analysis of the simple minerals most abundant in the volcanic\r\nand hypogene rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the names, synonyms, and mineral composition of the more\r\nabundant volcanic rocks._\r\n\r\nAMPHIBOLITE. _See_ Hornblende rock, amphibole being Hauey's name\r\nfor hornblende.\r\n\r\nAMYGDALOID.

The yellowish green mineral\r\ncalled olivine, can easily be distinguished from yellowish felspar by\r\nits infusibility, and having no cleavage. The edges turn brown in the\r\nflame of the blow-pipe.\r\n\r\nBASANITE. Name given by Alex. Brongniart to a rock, having a base of\r\nbasalt, with more or less distinct crystals of augite disseminated\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nCLAYSTONE and CLAYSTONE-PORPHYRY. An earthy and compact stone, usually of a\r\npurplish colour, like an indurated clay; passes into hornstone; generally\r\ncontains scattered crystals of felspar and sometimes of quartz.\r\n\r\nCLINKSTONE. _Syn._ Phonolite, fissile Petrosilex; a greenish or greyish\r\nrock, having a tendency to divide into slabs and columns; hard, with clean\r\nfracture, ringing under the hammer; principally composed of compact\r\nfelspar, and, according to Gmelin, of felspar and mesotype. (_Leonhard_,\r\n_Mineralreich_, p. 102.) A rock much resembling clinkstone, and called by\r\nsome Petrosilex, contains a considerable percentage of quartz and felspar.\r\nAs both trachyte and basalt pass into clinkstone, the rock so called must\r\nbe very various in composition.\r\n\r\nCOMPACT FELSPAR, which has also been called Petrosilex; the rock so called\r\nincludes the hornstone of some mineralogists, is allied to clinkstone, but\r\nis harder, more compact, and translucent. It is a varying rock, of which\r\nthe chemical composition is not well defined, and is perhaps the same as\r\nthat of clay. (_MacCulloch's Classification of Rocks_, p. 481.) Dr.\r\nMacCulloch says, that it contains both potash and soda.\r\n\r\nCORNEAN. A variety of claystone allied to hornstone. A fine homogeneous\r\npaste, supposed to consist of an aggregate of felspar, quartz, and\r\nhornblende, with occasionally epidote, and perhaps chlorite; it passes into\r\ncompact felspar and hornstone.

Formerly defined as a synonym of greenstone, which see. But,\r\naccording to Rose (_ibid._ p. 32.), its composition is black augite and\r\nLabrador-felspar; according to Leonhard (_Mineralreich_, &c. p. 77.),\r\naugite, Labrador-felspar, and magnetic iron.\r\n\r\nDOMITE. An earthy _trachyte_, found in the Puy de Dome, in Auvergne.\r\n\r\nEUPHOTIDE. A mixture of grains of Labrador-felspar and diallage. (_Rose_,\r\n_ibid._ p. 19.) According to some, this rock is defined to be a mixture of\r\naugite or hornblende, and saussurite, a mineral allied to jade.

Now the leading\r\nvarieties, such as basalt, greenstone, trachyte, porphyry, and the rest,\r\nare found sometimes in dikes penetrating stratified and unstratified\r\nformations, sometimes in shapeless masses protruding through or overlying\r\nthem, or in horizontal sheets intercalated between strata.\r\n\r\n_Volcanic dikes._--Fissures have already been spoken of as occurring in\r\nall kinds of rocks, some a few feet, others many yards in width, and\r\noften filled up with earth or angular pieces of stone, or with sand and\r\npebbles. Instead of such materials, suppose a quantity of melted stone\r\nto be driven or injected into an open rent, and there consolidated, we\r\nhave then a tabular mass resembling a wall, and called a trap dike. It\r\nis not uncommon to find such dikes passing through strata of soft\r\nmaterials, such as tuff or shale, which, being more perishable than the\r\ntrap, are often washed away by the sea, rivers, or rain, in which case\r\nthe dike stands prominently out in the face of precipices, or on the\r\nlevel surface of a country. (See the annexed figure.[378-A])\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 439. Dike in inland valley, near the Brazen\r\nHead, Madeira.]\r\n\r\nIn the islands of Arran, Skye, and other parts of Scotland, where\r\nsandstone, conglomerate, and other hard rocks are traversed by dikes of\r\ntrap, the converse of the above phenomenon is seen. The dike having\r\ndecomposed more rapidly than the containing rock, has once more left open\r\nthe original fissure, often for a distance of many yards inland from the\r\nsea-coast, as represented in the annexed view (fig. 440.). In these\r\ninstances, the greenstone of the dike is usually more tough and hard than\r\nthe sandstone; but chemical action, and chiefly the oxidation of the iron,\r\nhas given rise to the more rapid decay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 440. Fissures left vacant by decomposed trap.\r\nStrathaird, Skye. (MacCulloch.)]\r\n\r\nThere is yet another case, by no means uncommon in Arran and other parts of\r\nScotland, where the strata in contact with the dike, and for a certain\r\ndistance from it, have been hardened, so as to resist the action of the\r\nweather more than the dike itself, or the surrounding rocks. When this\r\nhappens, two parallel walls of indurated strata are seen protruding above\r\nthe general level of the country, and following the course of the dike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 441. Trap veins in Airdnamurchan.]\r\n\r\nAs fissures sometimes send off branches, or divide into two or more\r\nfissures of equal size, so also we find trap dikes bifurcating and\r\nramifying, and sometimes they are so tortuous as to be called veins, though\r\nthis is more common in granite than in trap. The accompanying sketch (fig.\r\n441.) by Dr. MacCulloch represents part of a sea-cliff in Argyleshire,\r\nwhere an overlying mass of trap, _b_, sends out some veins which terminate\r\ndownwards. Another trap vein, _a a_, cuts through both the limestone, _c_,\r\nand the trap, _b_.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 442., a ground plan is given of a ramifying dike of greenstone,\r\nwhich I observed cutting through sandstone on the beach near Kildonan\r\nCastle, in Arran. The larger branch varies from 5 to 7 feet in width, which\r\nwill afford a scale of measurement for the whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 442. Ground plan of greenstone dike traversing\r\nsandstone. Arran.]\r\n\r\nIn the Hebrides and other countries, the same masses of trap which\r\noccupy the surface of the country far and wide, concealing the subjacent\r\nstratified rocks, are seen also in the sea cliffs, prolonged downwards\r\nin veins or dikes, which probably unite with other masses of igneous\r\nrock at a greater depth. The largest of the dikes represented in the\r\nannexed diagram, and which are seen in part of the coast of Skye, is no\r\nless than 100 feet in width.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 443. Trap dividing and covering sandstone near\r\nSuishnish in Skye. (MacCulloch.)]\r\n\r\nEvery variety of trap-rock is sometimes found in these dikes, as basalt,\r\ngreenstone, felspar-porphyry, and more rarely trachyte. The amygdaloidal\r\ntraps also occur, and even tuff and breccia, for the materials of these\r\nlast may be washed down into open fissures at the bottom of the sea, or\r\nduring eruptions on the land may be showered into them from the air.\r\n\r\nSome dikes of trap may be followed for leagues uninterruptedly in nearly a\r\nstraight direction, as in the north of England, showing that the fissures\r\nwhich they fill must have been of extraordinary length.\r\n\r\n_Dikes more crystalline in the centre._--In many cases trap at the edges or\r\nsides of a dike is less crystalline or more earthy than in the centre, in\r\nconsequence of the melted matter having cooled more rapidly by coming in\r\ncontact with the cold sides of the fissure; whereas, in the centre, the\r\nmatter of the dike being kept long in a fluid or soft state, the crystals\r\nare slowly formed. In the ancient part of Vesuvius, called Somma, a thin\r\nband of half-vitreous lava is found at the edge of some dikes. At the\r\njunction of greenstone dikes with limestone, a _sahlband_, or selvage, of\r\nserpentine is occasionally observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 444. Syenitic greenstone dike of Naesodden, Christiania.\r\n\r\n_b._ imbedded fragment of crystalline schist surrounded by a band\r\nof greenstone.]\r\n\r\nOn the left shore of the fiord of Christiania, in Norway, I examined, in\r\ncompany with Professor Keilhau, a remarkable dike of syenitic greenstone,\r\nwhich is traced through Silurian strata, until at length, in the promontory\r\nof Naesodden, it enters mica-schist. Fig. 444. represents a ground plan,\r\nwhere the dike appears 8 paces in width. In the middle it is highly\r\ncrystalline and granitiform, of a purplish colour, and containing a few\r\ncrystals of mica, and strongly contrasted with the whitish mica-schist,\r\nbetween which and the syenitic rock there is usually on each side a\r\ndistinct black band, 18 inches wide, of dark greenstone. When first seen,\r\nthese bands have the appearance of two accompanying dikes; yet they are, in\r\nfact, only the different form which the syenitic materials have assumed\r\nwhere near to or in contact with the mica-schist. At one point, _a_, one\r\nof the sahlbands terminates for a space; but near this there is a large\r\ndetached block, _b_, having a gneiss-like structure, consisting of\r\nhornblende and felspar, which is included in the midst of the dike. Round\r\nthis a smaller encircling zone is seen, of dark basalt, or fine-grained\r\ngreenstone, nearly corresponding to the larger ones which border the dike,\r\nbut only 1 inch wide.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, evident that the fragment, _b_, has acted on the\r\nmatter of the dike, probably by causing it to cool more rapidly, in the\r\nsame manner as the walls of the fissure have acted on a larger scale. The\r\nfacts, also, illustrate the facility with which a granitiform syenite may\r\npass into ordinary rocks of the volcanic family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 445. Greenstone dike, with fragments of gneiss.\r\nSorgenfri, Christiania.]\r\n\r\nThe fact above alluded to, of a foreign fragment, such as _b_, fig.\r\n444., included in the midst of the trap, as if torn off from some\r\nsubjacent rock or the walls of a fissure, is by no means uncommon. A\r\nfine example is seen in another dike of greenstone, 10 feet wide, in the\r\nnorthern suburbs of Christiania, in Norway, of which the annexed figure\r\nis a ground plan. The dike passes through shale, known by its fossils to\r\nbelong to the Silurian series. In the black base of greenstone are\r\nangular and roundish pieces of gneiss, some white, others of a light\r\nflesh-colour, some without lamination, like granite, others with laminae,\r\nwhich, by their various and often opposite directions, show that they\r\nhave been scattered at random through the matrix. These imbedded pieces\r\nof gneiss measure from 1 to about 8 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n_Rocks altered by volcanic dikes._--After these remarks on the form and\r\ncomposition of dikes themselves, I shall describe the alterations which\r\nthey sometimes produce in the rocks in contact with them. The changes are\r\nusually such as the intense heat of melted matter and the entangled gases\r\nmight be expected to cause.\r\n\r\n_Plas-Newydd._--A striking example, near Plas-Newydd, in Anglesea, has\r\nbeen described by Professor Henslow.[381-A] The dike is 134 feet wide,\r\nand consists of a rock which is a compound of felspar and augite\r\n(dolerite of some authors). Strata of shale and argillaceous limestone,\r\nthrough which it cuts perpendicularly, are altered to a distance of 30,\r\nor even, in some places, to 35 feet from the edge of the dike. The\r\nshale, as it approaches the trap, becomes gradually more compact, and is\r\nmost indurated where nearest the junction. Here it loses part of its\r\nschistose structure, but the separation into parallel layers is still\r\ndiscernible. In several places the shale is converted into hard\r\nporcellanous jasper. In the most hardened part of the mass the fossil\r\nshells, principally _Producti_, are nearly obliterated; yet even here\r\ntheir impressions may frequently be traced. The argillaceous limestone\r\nundergoes analogous mutations, losing its earthy texture as it\r\napproaches the dike, and becoming granular and crystalline. But the most\r\nextraordinary phenomenon is the appearance in the shale of numerous\r\ncrystals of analcime and garnet, which are distinctly confined to those\r\nportions of the rock affected by the dike.[382-A] Some garnets contain\r\nas much as 20 per cent. of lime, which they may have derived from the\r\ndecomposition of the fossil shells or Producti. The same mineral has\r\nbeen observed, under very analogous circumstances, in High Teesdale,\r\nby Professor Sedgwick, where it also occurs in shale and limestone,\r\naltered by basalt.[382-B]\r\n\r\n_Antrim._--In several parts of the county of Antrim, in the north of\r\nIreland, chalk with flints is traversed by basaltic dikes. The chalk is\r\nthere converted into granular marble near the basalt, the change sometimes\r\nextending 8 or 10 feet from the wall of the dike, being greatest near the\r\npoint of contact, and thence gradually decreasing till it becomes\r\nevanescent. \"The extreme effect,\" says Dr. Berger, \"presents a dark brown\r\ncrystalline limestone, the crystals running in flakes as large as those of\r\ncoarse primitive (_metamorphic_) limestone; the next state is saccharine,\r\nthen fine grained and arenaceous; a compact variety, having a porcellanous\r\naspect and a bluish-grey colour, succeeds: this, towards the outer edge,\r\nbecomes yellowish-white, and insensibly graduates into the unaltered chalk.\r\nThe flints in the altered chalk usually assume a grey yellowish\r\ncolour.\"[382-C] All traces of organic remains are effaced in that part of\r\nthe limestone which is most crystalline.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 446. Basaltic dikes in chalk in island of\r\nRathlin, Antrim. Ground plan, as seen on the beach. (Conybeare\r\nand Buckland.[382-D])]\r\n\r\nThe annexed drawing (fig. 446.) represents three basaltic dikes\r\ntraversing the chalk, all within the distance of 90 feet. The chalk\r\ncontiguous to the two outer dikes is converted into a finely granular\r\nmarble, _m m_, as are the whole of the masses between the outer dikes\r\nand the central one. The entire contrast in the composition and colour\r\nof the intrusive and invaded rocks, in these cases, renders the\r\nphenomena peculiarly clear and interesting.\r\n\r\nAnother of the dikes of the north-east of Ireland has converted a mass\r\nof red sandstone into hornstone.[382-E] By another, the slate clay of\r\nthe coal measures has been indurated, and has assumed the character of\r\nflinty slate[383-A]; and in another place the slate clay of the lias\r\nhas been changed into flinty slate, which still retains numerous\r\nimpressions of ammonites.[383-B]\r\n\r\nIt might have been anticipated that beds of coal would, from their\r\ncombustible nature, be effected in an extraordinary degree by the\r\ncontact of melted rock. Accordingly, one of the greenstone dikes of\r\nAntrim, on passing through a bed of coal, reduces it to a cinder for the\r\nspace of 9 feet on each side.[383-C]\r\n\r\nAt Cockfield Fell, in the north of England, a similar change is observed.\r\nSpecimens taken at the distance of about 30 yards from the trap are not\r\ndistinguishable from ordinary pit coal; those nearer the dike are like\r\ncinders, and have all the character of coke; while those close to it are\r\nconverted into a substance resembling soot.[383-D]\r\n\r\nAs examples might be multiplied without end, I shall merely select one\r\nor two others, and then conclude. The rock of Stirling Castle is a\r\ncalcareous sandstone, fractured and forcibly displaced by a mass of\r\ngreenstone which has evidently invaded the strata in a melted state. The\r\nsandstone has been indurated, and has assumed a texture approaching to\r\nhornstone near the junction. In Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Craig, near\r\nEdinburgh, a sandstone which comes in contact with greenstone is\r\nconverted into a jaspideous rock.[383-E]\r\n\r\nThe secondary sandstones in Skye are converted into solid quartz in\r\nseveral places, where they come in contact with veins or masses of trap;\r\nand a bed of quartz, says Dr. MacCulloch, found near a mass of trap,\r\namong the coal strata of Fife, was in all probability a stratum of\r\nordinary sandstone, having been subsequently indurated and turned into\r\nquartzite by the action of heat.[383-F]\r\n\r\nBut although strata in the neighbourhood of dikes are thus altered in a\r\nvariety of cases, shale being turned into flinty slate or jasper, limestone\r\ninto crystalline marble, sandstone into quartz, coal into coke, and the\r\nfossil remains of all such strata wholly and in part obliterated, it is by\r\nno means uncommon to meet with the same rocks, even in the same districts,\r\nabsolutely unchanged in the proximity of volcanic dikes.\r\n\r\nThis great inequality in the effects of the igneous rocks may often arise\r\nfrom an original difference in their temperature, and in that of the\r\nentangled gases, such as is ascertained to prevail in different lavas, or\r\nin the same lava near its source and at a distance from it. The power also\r\nof the invaded rocks to conduct heat may vary, according to their\r\ncomposition, structure, and the fractures which they may have experienced,\r\nand perhaps, also, according to the quantity of water (so capable of being\r\nheated) which they contain. It must happen in some cases that the component\r\nmaterials are mixed in such proportions as prepare them readily to enter\r\ninto chemical union, and form new minerals; while in other cases the mass\r\nmay be more homogeneous, or the proportions less adapted for such union.\r\n\r\nWe must also take into consideration, that one fissure may be simply filled\r\nwith lava, which may begin to cool from the first; whereas in other cases\r\nthe fissure may give passage to a current of melted matter, which may\r\nascend for days or months, feeding streams which are overflowing the\r\ncountry above, or are ejected in the shape of scoriae from some crater. If\r\nthe walls of a rent, moreover, are heated by hot vapour before the lava\r\nrises, as we know may happen on the flanks of a volcano, the additional\r\ncaloric supplied by the dike and its gases will act more powerfully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 447. Trap interposed between displaced beds\r\nof limestone and shale, at White Force, High Teesdale, Durham.\r\n(Sedgwick.[384-A])]\r\n\r\n_Intrusion of trap between strata._--In proof of the mechanical force\r\nwhich the fluid trap has sometimes exerted on the rocks into which it\r\nhas intruded itself, I may refer to the Whin-Sill, where a mass of\r\nbasalt, from 60 to 80 feet in height, represented by _a_, fig. 447., is\r\nin part wedged in between the rocks of limestone, _b_, and shale, _c_,\r\nwhich have been separated from the great mass of limestone and shale,\r\n_d_, with which they were united.\r\n\r\nThe shale in this place is indurated; and the limestone, which at a\r\ndistance from the trap is blue, and contains fossil corals, is here\r\nconverted into granular marble without fossils.\r\n\r\nMasses of trap are not unfrequently met with intercalated between strata,\r\nand maintaining their parallelism to the planes of stratification\r\nthroughout large areas. They must in some places have forced their way\r\nlaterally between the divisions of the strata, a direction in which there\r\nwould be the least resistance to an advancing fluid, if no vertical rents\r\ncommunicated with the surface, and a powerful hydrostatic pressure was\r\ncaused by gases propelling the lava upwards.\r\n\r\n_Columnar and globular structure._--One of the characteristic forms of\r\nvolcanic rocks, especially of basalt, is the columnar, where large masses\r\nare divided into regular prisms, sometimes easily separable, but in other\r\ncases adhering firmly together. The columns vary in the number of angles,\r\nfrom three to twelve; but they have most commonly from five to seven sides.\r\nThey are often divided transversely, at nearly equal distances, like the\r\njoints in a vertebral column, as in the Giant's Causeway, in Ireland. They\r\nvary exceedingly in respect to length and diameter. Dr. MacCulloch\r\nmentions some in Skye which are about 400 feet long; others, in Morven, not\r\nexceeding an inch. In regard to diameter, those of Ailsa measure 9 feet,\r\nand those of Morven an inch or less.[385-A] They are usually straight, but\r\nsometimes curved; and examples of both these occur in the island of Staffa.\r\nIn a horizontal bed or sheet of trap the columns are vertical; in a\r\nvertical dike they are horizontal. Among other examples of the\r\nlast-mentioned phenomenon is the mass of basalt, called the Chimney, in St.\r\nHelena (see fig. 448.), a pile of hexagonal prisms, 64 feet high, evidently\r\nthe remainder of a narrow dike, the walls of rock which the dike originally\r\ntraversed having been removed down to the level of the sea. In fig. 449. a\r\nsmall portion of this dike is represented on a less reduced scale.[385-B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 448. Volcanic dike composed of horizontal prisms.\r\nSt. Helena.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 449. Small portion of the dyke in Fig. 448.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 450. Lava of La Coupe d'Ayzac, near Antraigue, in the\r\nprovince of Ardeche.]\r\n\r\nIt being assumed that columnar trap has consolidated from a fluid state,\r\nthe prisms are said to be always at right angles to the _cooling surfaces_.\r\nIf these surfaces, therefore, instead of being either perpendicular, or\r\nhorizontal, are curved, the columns ought to be inclined at every angle to\r\nthe horizon; and there is a beautiful exemplification of this phenomenon in\r\none of the valleys of the Vivarais, a mountainous district in the South of\r\nFrance, where, in the midst of a region of gneiss, a geologist encounters\r\nunexpectedly several volcanic cones of loose sand and scoriae. From the\r\ncrater of one of these cones called La Coupe d'Ayzac, a stream of lava\r\ndescends and occupies the bottom of a narrow valley, except at those points\r\nwhere the river Volant, or the torrents which join it, have cut away\r\nportions of the solid lava. The accompanying sketch (fig. 450.) represents\r\nthe remnant of the lava at one of the points where a lateral torrent joins\r\nthe main valley of the Volant. It is clear that the lava once filled the\r\nwhole valley up to the dotted line _d a_; but the river has gradually swept\r\naway all below that line, while the tributary torrent has laid open a\r\ntransverse section; by which we perceive, in the first place, that the lava\r\nis composed, as usual in this country, of three parts: the uppermost, at\r\n_a_, being scoriaceous; the second, _b_, presenting irregular prisms; and\r\nthe third, _c_, with regular columns, which are vertical on the banks of\r\nthe Volant, where they rest on a horizontal base of gneiss, but which are\r\ninclined at an angle of 45 deg. at _g_, and then horizontal at _f_, their\r\nposition having been every where determined, according to the law before\r\nmentioned, by the concave form of the original valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 451. Columnar basalt in the Vicentin. (Fortis.)]\r\n\r\nIn the annexed figure (451.) a view is given of some of the inclined and\r\ncurved columns which present themselves on the sides of the valleys in the\r\nhilly region north of Vicenza, in Italy, and at the foot of the higher\r\nAlps.[386-A] Unlike those of the Vivarais, last mentioned, the basalt of\r\nthis country was evidently submarine, and the present valleys have since\r\nbeen hollowed out by denudation.\r\n\r\nThe columnar structure is by no means peculiar to the trap rocks in which\r\nhornblende or augite predominate; it is also observed in clinkstone,\r\ntrachyte, and other felspathic rocks of the igneous class, although in\r\nthese it is rarely exhibited in such regular polygonal forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 452. Basaltic pillars of the Kaesegrotte,\r\nBertrich-Baden, half way between Treves and Coblentz. Height of\r\ngrotto, from 7 to 8 feet.]\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that basaltic columns are often divided by\r\ncross joints. Sometimes each segment, instead of an angular, assumes a\r\nspheroidal form, so that a pillar is made up of a pile of balls, usually\r\nflattened, as in the Cheese-grotto at Bertrich-Baden, in the Eifel, near\r\nthe Moselle (fig. 452.). The basalt, there, is part of a small stream of\r\nlava, from 30 to 40 feet thick, which has proceeded from one of several\r\nvolcanic craters, still extant, on the neighbouring heights. The position\r\nof the lava bordering the river in this valley might be represented by a\r\nsection like that already given at fig. 450. p. 385., if we merely supposed\r\ninclined strata of slate and the argillaceous sandstone called greywacke to\r\nbe substituted for gneiss.\r\n\r\nIn some masses of decomposing greenstone, basalt, and other trap rocks, the\r\nglobular structure is so conspicuous that the rock has the appearance of a\r\nheap of large cannon balls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 453. Globiform pitchstone. Chiaja di Luna, Isle\r\nof Ponza. (Scrope.)]\r\n\r\nA striking example of this structure occurs in a resinous trachyte or\r\npitchstone-porphyry in one of the Ponza islands, which rise from the\r\nMediterranean, off the coast of Terracina and Gaeta. The globes vary from a\r\nfew inches to three feet in diameter, and are of an ellipsoidal form (see\r\nfig. 453.). The whole rock is in a state of decomposition, \"and when the\r\nballs,\" says Mr. Scrope, \"have been exposed a short time to the weather,\r\nthey scale off at a touch into numerous concentric coats, like those of a\r\nbulbous root, inclosing a compact nucleus. The laminae of this nucleus have\r\nnot been so much loosened by decomposition; but the application of a ruder\r\nblow will produce a still further exfoliation.\"[387-A]\r\n\r\nA fissile texture is occasionally assumed by clinkstone and other trap\r\nrocks, so that they have been used for roofing houses. Sometimes the\r\nprismatic and slaty structure is found in the same mass. The causes which\r\ngive rise to such arrangements are very obscure, but are supposed to be\r\nconnected with changes of temperature during the cooling of the mass, as\r\nwill be pointed out in the sequel. (See Chaps. XXXV. and XXXVI.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of Trappean Rocks to the products of active Volcanos._\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the changes above described in the strata near their\r\ncontact with trap dikes, and consider how great is the analogy in\r\ncomposition and structure of the rocks called trappean and the lavas of\r\nactive volcanos, it seems difficult at first to understand how so much\r\ndoubt could have prevailed for half a century as to whether trap was of\r\nigneous or aqueous origin. To a certain extent, however, there was a real\r\ndistinction between the trappean formations and those to which the term\r\nvolcanic was almost exclusively confined. The trappean rocks first studied\r\nin the north of Germany, and in Norway, France, Scotland, and other\r\ncountries, were either such as had been formed entirely under deep water,\r\nor had been injected into fissures and intruded between strata, and which\r\nhad never flowed out in the air, or over the bottom of a shallow sea. When\r\nthese products, therefore, of submarine or subterranean igneous action were\r\ncontrasted with loose cones of scoriae, tuff, and lava, or with narrow\r\nstreams of lava in great part scoriaceous and porous, such as were observed\r\nto have proceeded from Vesuvius and Etna, the resemblance seemed remote and\r\nequivocal. It was, in truth, like comparing the roots of a tree with its\r\nleaves and branches, which, although they belong to the same plant, differ\r\nin form, texture, colour, mode of growth, and position. The external cone,\r\nwith its loose ashes and porous lava, may be likened to the light foliage\r\nand branches, and the rocks concealed far below, to the roots. But it is\r\nnot enough to say of the volcano,\r\n\r\n  \"quantum vertice in auras\r\n  AEtherias, tantum radice in Tartara tendit,\"\r\n\r\nfor its roots do literally reach downwards to Tartarus, or to the regions\r\nof subterranean fire; and what is concealed far below, is probably always\r\nmore important in volume and extent than what is visible above ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 454. Strata intersected by a trap dike, and\r\ncovered with alluvium.]\r\n\r\nWe have already stated how frequently dense masses of strata have been\r\nremoved by denudation from wide areas (see Chap. VI.); and this fact\r\nprepares us to expect a similar destruction of whatever may once have\r\nformed the uppermost part of ancient submarine or subaerial volcanos, more\r\nespecially as those superficial parts are always of the lightest and most\r\nperishable materials. The abrupt manner in which dikes of trap usually\r\nterminate at the surface (see fig. 454.), and the water-worn pebbles of\r\ntrap in the alluvium which covers the dike, prove incontestably that\r\nwhatever was uppermost in these formations has been swept away. It is easy,\r\ntherefore, to conceive that what is gone in regions of trap may have\r\ncorresponded to what is now visible in active volcanos.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen in the following chapters, that in the earth's crust there\r\nare volcanic tuffs of all ages, containing marine shells, which bear\r\nwitness to eruptions at many successive geological periods. These tuffs,\r\nand the associated trappean rocks, must not be compared to lava and scoriae\r\nwhich had cooled in the open air. Their counterparts must be sought in the\r\nproducts of modern submarine volcanic eruptions. If it be objected that we\r\nhave no opportunity of studying these last, it may be answered, that\r\nsubterranean movements have caused, almost everywhere in regions of active\r\nvolcanos, great changes in the relative level of land and sea, in times\r\ncomparatively modern, so as to expose to view the effects of volcanic\r\noperations at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, the recent examination of the igneous rocks of Sicily,\r\nespecially those of the Val di Noto, has proved that all the more ordinary\r\nvarieties of European trap have been there produced under the waters of the\r\nsea, at a modern period; that is to say, since the Mediterranean has been\r\ninhabited by a great proportion of the existing species of testacea.\r\n\r\nThese igneous rocks of the Val di Noto, and the more ancient trappean rocks\r\nof Scotland and other countries, differ from subaerial volcanic formations\r\nin being more compact and heavy, and in forming sometimes extensive sheets\r\nof matter intercalated between marine strata, and sometimes stratified\r\nconglomerates, of which the rounded pebbles are all trap. They differ also\r\nin the absence of regular cones and craters, and in the want of conformity\r\nof the lava to the lowest levels of existing valleys.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable, however, that insular cones did exist in some\r\nparts of the Val di Noto: and that they were removed by the waves, in\r\nthe same manner as the cone of Graham island, in the Mediterranean, was\r\nswept away in 1831, and that of Nyoee, off Iceland, in 1783.[389-A] All\r\nthat would remain in such cases, after the bed of the sea has been\r\nupheaved and laid dry, would be dikes and shapeless masses of igneous\r\nrock, cutting through sheets of lava which may have spread over the\r\nlevel bottom of the sea, and strata of tuff, formed of materials first\r\nscattered far and wide by the winds and waves, and then deposited. Trap\r\nconglomerates also, to which the action of the waves must give rise\r\nduring the denudation of such volcanic islands, will emerge from the\r\ndeep whenever the bottom of the sea becomes land.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of volcanic matter which is originally submarine must\r\nalways be very great, as those volcanic vents which are not entirely\r\nbeneath the sea, are almost all of them in islands, or, if on\r\ncontinents, near the shore. This may explain why extended sheets of trap\r\nso often occur, instead of narrow threads, like lava streams. For, a\r\nmultitude of causes tend, near the land, to reduce the bottom of the sea\r\nto a nearly uniform level,--the sediment of rivers,--materials\r\ntransported by the waves and currents of the sea from wasting\r\ncliffs,--showers of sand and scoriae ejected by volcanos, and scattered\r\nby the wind and waves. When, therefore, lava is poured out on such a\r\nsurface, it will spread far and wide in every direction in a liquid\r\nsheet, which may afterwards, when raised up, form the tabular capping\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nAs to the absence of porosity in the trappean formations, the appearances\r\nare in a great degree deceptive, for all amygdaloids are, as already\r\nexplained, porous rocks, into the cells of which mineral matter, such as\r\nsilex, carbonate of lime, and other ingredients, have been subsequently\r\nintroduced (see p. 373.); sometimes, perhaps, by secretion during the\r\ncooling and consolidation of lavas.\r\n\r\nIn the Little Cumbray, one of the Western Islands, near Arran, the\r\namygdaloid sometimes contains elongated cavities filled with brown spar;\r\nand when the nodules have been washed out, the interior of the cavities is\r\nglazed with the vitreous varnish so characteristic of the pores of slaggy\r\nlavas. Even in some parts of this rock which are excluded from air and\r\nwater, the cells are empty, and seem to have always remained in this state,\r\nand are therefore undistinguishable from some modern lavas.[390-A]\r\n\r\nDr. MacCulloch, after examining with great attention these and the other\r\nigneous rocks of Scotland, observes, \"that it is a mere dispute about\r\nterms, to refuse to the ancient eruptions of trap the name of submarine\r\nvolcanos; for they are such in every essential point, although they no\r\nlonger eject fire and smoke.\"[390-B] The same author also considers it not\r\nimprobable that some of the volcanic rocks of the same country may have\r\nbeen poured out in the open air.[390-C]\r\n\r\nAlthough the principal component minerals of subaerial lavas are the same\r\nas those of intrusive trap, and both the columnar and globular structure\r\nare common to both, there are, nevertheless, some volcanic rocks which\r\nnever occur as lava, such as greenstone, clinkstone, the more crystalline\r\nporphyries, and those traps in which quartz and mica appear as constituent\r\nparts. In short, the intrusive trap rocks, forming the intermediate step\r\nbetween lava and the plutonic rocks, depart in their characters from lava\r\nin proportion as they approximate to granite.\r\n\r\nThese views respecting the relations of the volcanic and trap rocks will be\r\nbetter understood when the reader has studied, in the 33d chapter, what is\r\nsaid of the plutonic formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORM, STRUCTURE, AND ORIGIN OF VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nThe origin of volcanic cones with crater-shaped summits has been alluded to\r\nin the last chapter (p. 368.), and more fully explained in the \"Principles\r\nof Geology\" (chaps. xxiv. to xxvii.), where Vesuvius, Etna, Santorin, and\r\nBarren Island were described. The more ancient portions of those mountains\r\nor islands, formed long before the times of history, exhibit the same\r\nexternal features and internal structure which belong to most of the\r\nextinct volcanos of still higher antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe island of Palma, for example, one of the Canaries, offers an excellent\r\nillustration of what, in common with many others, I regard as the ruins of\r\na large dome-shaped mass formed by a series of eruptions proceeding from a\r\ncrater at the summit, this crater having been since replaced by a larger\r\ncavity, the origin of which has afforded geologists an ample field for\r\ndiscussion and speculation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 455. View of the Isle of Palma, and of the entrance\r\ninto the central cavity or Caldera. From Von Buch's \"Canary Islands.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 456. Map of the Caldera of Palma and the great\r\nravine, called \"Barranco de las Angustias.\" From Survey of Capt.\r\nVidal, R.N., 1837.]\r\n\r\nVon Buch, in his excellent account of the Canaries, has given us a\r\ngraphic picture of this island, which consists chiefly of a single\r\nmountain (fig. 455.). This mountain has the general form of a great\r\ntruncated cone, with a huge and deep cavity in the middle, about six\r\nmiles in diameter, called by the inhabitants \"the Caldera,\" or cauldron.\r\nThe range of precipices surrounding the Caldera are no less than 4000\r\nfeet in their average height; at one point, where they are highest, they\r\nare 7730 feet above the level of the sea. The external flanks of the\r\ncone incline gently in every direction towards the base of the island,\r\nand are in part cultivated; but the walls and bottom of the Caldera\r\npresent on all sides rugged and uncultivated rocks, almost completely\r\ndevoid of vegetation. So steep are these walls, that there is no part by\r\nwhich they can be descended, and the only entrance is by a great ravine,\r\nor Barranco, as it is called (see _b b'_, map, fig. 456.), which extends\r\nfrom the sea to the interior of the great cavity, and by its jagged,\r\nbroken, and precipitous sides, exhibits to the geologist a transverse\r\nsection of the rocks of which the whole mountain is composed. By this\r\nmeans, we learn that the cone is made up of a great number of sloping\r\nbeds, which dip outwards in every direction from the centre of the void\r\nspace, or from the hollow axis of the cone. The beds consist chiefly of\r\nsheets of basalt, alternating with conglomerates; the materials of the\r\nlatter being in part rounded, as if rolled by water in motion. The\r\ninclination of all the beds corresponds to that of the external slope of\r\nthe island, being greatest towards the Caldera, and least steep when\r\nthey are nearest the sea. There are a great number of tortuous veins,\r\nand many dikes of lava or trap, chiefly basaltic, and most of them\r\nvertical, which cut through the sloping beds laid open to view in the\r\ngreat gorge or Barranco. These dikes and veins are more and more\r\nabundant as we approach the Caldera, being therefore most numerous where\r\nthe slope of the beds is greatest.\r\n\r\nAssuming the cone to be a pile of volcanic materials ejected by a long\r\nsuccession of eruptions (a point on which all geologists are agreed), we\r\nhave to account for the Caldera and the great Barranco. I conceive that the\r\ncone itself may be explained, in accordance with what we know of the\r\nordinary growth of volcanos[392-A], by supposing most of the eruptions to\r\nhave taken place from one or more central vents, at or near the summit of\r\nthe cone, before it was truncated. From this culminating point, sheets of\r\nlava flowed down one after the other, and showers of ashes or ejected\r\nstones. The volcano may, in the earlier stages of its growth, have been in\r\ngreat part submerged, like Stromboli, in the sea; and, therefore, some of\r\nthe fragments of rock cast out of its crater may not only have been rolled\r\nby torrents sweeping down the mountain's side, but have also been rounded\r\nby the waves of the sea, as we see happen on the beach near Catania, on\r\nwhich the modern lavas of Etna are broken up. The increased number of\r\ndykes, as we approach the axis of the cone, agrees well with the hypothesis\r\nof the eruptions having been most frequent towards the centre.\r\n\r\nThere are three known causes or modes of operation, which may have\r\nconduced towards the vast size of the Caldera. First, the summit of a\r\nconical mountain may have fallen in, as happened in the case of\r\nCapacurcu, one of the Andes, according to tradition, in the year 1462,\r\nand of many other volcanic mountains.[393-A] Sections seem wanting, to\r\nsupply us with all the data required for judging fairly of the\r\ntenability of this hypothesis. It appears, however, from Captain Vidal's\r\nsurvey (see fig. 456.), that a hill of considerable height rises up from\r\nthe bottom of the Caldera, the structure of which, if it be any where\r\nlaid open, might doubtless throw much light on this subject. Secondly,\r\nan original crater may have been enlarged by a vast gaseous explosion,\r\nnever followed by any subsequent eruption. A serious objection to this\r\ntheory arises from our not finding that the exterior of the cone\r\nsupports a mass of ruins, such as ought to cover it, had so enormous a\r\nvolume of matter, partly made up of the solid contents of the dikes,\r\nbeen blown out into the air. In that case, an extensive bed of angular\r\nfragments of stone, and of fine dust, might be looked for, enveloping\r\nthe entire exterior of the mountain up to the very rim of the Caldera,\r\nand ought nowhere to be intersected by a dike. The absence of such a\r\nformation has induced Von Buch to suppose that the missing portion\r\nof the cone was engulphed. It should, however, be remembered, that\r\nin existing volcanos, large craters, two or three miles in diameter,\r\nare sometimes formed by explosions, or by the discharge of great\r\nvolumes of steam.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another cause to which the extraordinary dimensions of the\r\nCaldera may, in part at least, be owing; namely, aqueous denudation. Von\r\nBuch has observed, that the existence of a single deep ravine, like the\r\nGreat Barranco, is a phenomenon common to many extinct volcanos, as well as\r\nto some active ones. Now, it will be seen by Captain Vidal's map (fig. 456.\r\np. 391.), that the sea-cliff at Point Juan Graje, 780 feet high, now\r\nconstituting the coast at the entrance of the great ravine, is continuous\r\nwith an inland cliff which bounds the same ravine on its north-western\r\nside. No one will dispute that the precipice, at the base of which the\r\nwaves are now beating, owes its origin to the undermining power of the sea.\r\nIt is natural, therefore, to attribute the extension of the same cliff to\r\nthe former action of the waves, exerted at a time when the relative level\r\nof the island and the ocean were different from what they are now. But if\r\nthe waves and tides had power to remove the rocks once filling a great\r\ngorge which is 7 miles long, and, in its upper part, 2000 feet deep, can we\r\ndoubt that the same power may have cleared out much of the solid mass now\r\nmissing in the Great Caldera?\r\n\r\nThe theory advanced to account for the configuration of Palma, commonly\r\ncalled the \"elevation crater theory,\" is this. All the alternating masses\r\nof basalt and conglomerate, intersected in the Barranco, or abruptly cut\r\noff in the escarpment or walls of the Caldera, were at first disposed in\r\nhorizontal masses on the level floor of the ocean, and traversed, when in\r\nthat position, by all the basaltic dikes which now cut through them. At\r\nlength they were suddenly uplifted by the explosive force of elastic\r\nvapours, which raised the mass bodily, so as to tilt the beds on all sides\r\naway from the centre of elevation, causing at the same time an opening at\r\nthe culminating point. Besides many other objections which may be urged\r\nagainst this hypothesis, it leaves unexplained the unbroken continuity of\r\nthe rim of the Caldera, which is uninterrupted in all places save\r\none[394-A], namely, that where the great gorge or Barranco occurs.\r\n\r\nAs a more natural way of explaining the phenomenon, the following series of\r\nevents may be imagined. The principal vent, from which a large part of the\r\nmaterials of the cone were poured or thrown out, was left empty after the\r\nlast escape of vapour, when the volcano became extinct. We learn from Mr.\r\nDana's valuable work on the geology of the United States' Exploring\r\nExpedition, published in 1849, that two of the principal volcanos of the\r\nSandwich Islands, Mounts Loa and Kea in Owyhee, are huge flattened volcanic\r\ncones, 15,000 feet high (see fig. 457.), each equalling two and a half\r\nEtnas in their dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 457. Mount Loa, in the Sandwich Islands. (Dana)\r\n\r\n  _a._ Crater at the summit.\r\n  _b._ The lateral crater of Kilauea.\r\n\r\nThe dotted lines indicate a supposed column of solid rock caused by the\r\nlava consolidating after eruptions.]\r\n\r\nFrom the summits of these lofty though featureless hills, and from vents\r\nnot far below their summits, successive streams of lava, often 2 miles or\r\nmore in width, and sometimes 26 miles long, have flowed. They have been\r\npoured out one after the other, some of them in recent times, in every\r\ndirection from the apex of the cone, down slopes varying on an average from\r\n4 degrees to 8 degrees; but at some places considerably steeper.[394-B]\r\nSometimes deep rents open on the sides of these cones, which are filled by\r\nstreams of lava passing over them, the liquid matter in such cases probably\r\nuniting in the fissure with other lava melted in subterranean reservoirs\r\nbelow, and thus explaining the origin of one great class of lateral dikes,\r\non Etna, Palma, and other cones.\r\n\r\nIf the flattened domes, such as those here alluded to in the Sandwich\r\nIslands, instead of being inland, and above water, were situated in\r\nmid-ocean, like the Island of St. Paul, and for the most part submerged\r\n(see figs. 458, 459, 460.), and if a gradual upheaval of such a dome should\r\nthen take place, the denuding power of the sea could scarcely fail to play\r\nan important part in modifying the form of the volcanic mountain as it\r\nrose. The crater will almost invariably have one side much lower than all\r\nthe others, namely, that side towards which the prevailing winds never\r\nblow, and to which, therefore, showers of dust and scoriae are rarely\r\ncarried during eruptions. There will also be one point on this windward or\r\nlowest side more depressed than all the rest, by which the sea may enter as\r\noften as the tide rises, or as often as the wind blows from that quarter.\r\nFor the same reason that the sea continues to keep open a single entrance\r\ninto the lagoon of an atoll or annular coral reef, it will not allow this\r\npassage into the crater to be stopped up, but scour it out, at low tide, or\r\nas often as the wind changes. The channel, therefore, will always be\r\ndeepened in proportion as the island rises above the level of the sea, at\r\nthe rate perhaps of a few feet or yards in a century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 458. Map of the Island of St. Paul, in the Indian\r\nOcean, lat. 38 deg. 44' S., long. 77 deg. 37' E., surveyed by Capt. Blackwood,\r\nR.N., 1842.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 459. View of the Crater of the Island of St. Paul.]\r\n\r\nThe island of St. Paul may perhaps be motionless; but if, like many\r\nother parts of the earth's crust, it should begin to undergo a gradual\r\nupheaval, or if, as has happened to the shores of the Bay of Baiae, its\r\nlevel should oscillate, with a tendency upon the whole to increased\r\nelevation, the same power which has cut away part of the cone, and\r\ncaused the cliffs now seen on the north-east side of the island, would\r\nhave power to undermine the walls of the crater, and enlarge its\r\ndiameter, keeping open the channel, by which it enters into it. This\r\nravine might be excavated to the depth of 180 feet (the present depth of\r\nthe crater), and its length might be extended to many miles according to\r\nthe size of the submerged part of the cone. The crater is only a mile in\r\ndiameter, and the surrounding cliffs, where loftiest, only 800 feet\r\nhigh, so that the size of this cone and crater is insignificant when\r\ncompared to those in the Sandwich Islands, and I have merely selected\r\nit because it affords an example of a class of insular volcanos, into\r\nthe craters of which the sea now enters by a single passage. The crater\r\nof Vesuvius in 1822 was 2000 feet deep; and if it were a half submerged\r\ncone, like St. Paul, the excavating power of the ocean might in\r\nconjunction with gaseous explosions and co-operating with a gradual\r\nupheaving force, give rise to a caldera on as grand a scale as\r\nthat exhibited by Palma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 460. Side view of the Island of St. Paul (N.E. side).\r\nNine-pin rocks two miles distant. (Captain Blackwood.)]\r\n\r\nIf, after the geographical changes above supposed, the volcanic fires\r\nlong dormant should recover their energy, they might, as in the case of\r\nTeneriffe, Vesuvius, Santorin, and Barren Island, discharge from the old\r\ncentral vent, long sealed up at the bottom of the caldera, new floods of\r\nlava and clouds of elastic vapours. Should this happen, a new cone will\r\nbe built up in the middle of the cavity or circular bay, formed, partly\r\nby explosion, partly perhaps by engulphment, and partly by aqueous\r\ndenudation. In the island of Palma this last phase of volcanic activity\r\nhas never occurred; but the subterranean heat is still in full operation\r\nbeneath the Canary Islands, so that we know not what future changes it\r\nmay be destined to undergo.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[378-A] I have been favoured with this drawing by Captain B.

The tests of relative age in this\r\nclass of rocks are four:--1st, superposition and intrusion, with or without\r\nalteration of the rocks in contact; 2d, organic remains; 3d, mineral\r\ncharacter; 4th, included fragments of older rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 461. Cross section.]\r\n\r\n_Tests by superposition, &c._--If a volcanic rock rests upon an aqueous\r\ndeposit, the former must be the newest of the two, but the like rule does\r\nnot hold good where the aqueous formation rests upon the volcanic, for\r\nmelted matter, rising from below, may penetrate a sedimentary mass without\r\nreaching the surface, or may be forced in conformably between two strata,\r\nas _b_ at D in the annexed figure (fig. 461.), after which it may cool down\r\nand consolidate. Superposition, therefore, is not of the same value as a\r\ntest of age in the unstratified volcanic rocks as in fossiliferous\r\nformations. We can only rely implicitly on this test where the volcanic\r\nrocks are contemporaneous, not where they are intrusive. Now they are said\r\nto be contemporaneous if produced by volcanic action, which was going on\r\nsimultaneously with the deposition of the strata with which they are\r\nassociated. Thus in the section at D (fig. 461.), we may perhaps ascertain\r\nthat the trap _b_ flowed over the fossiliferous bed _c_, and that, after\r\nits consolidation, _a_ was deposited upon it, _a_ and _c_ both belonging to\r\nthe same geological period. But if the stratum _a_ be altered by _b_ at the\r\npoint of contact, we must then conclude the trap to have been intrusive, or\r\nif, in pursuing _b_ for some distance, we find at length that it cuts\r\nthrough the stratum _a_, and then overlies it as at E.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, be easily deceived in supposing a volcanic rock to be\r\nintrusive, when in reality it is contemporaneous; for a sheet of lava, as\r\nit spreads over the bottom of the sea, cannot rest everywhere upon the\r\nsame stratum, either because these have been denuded, or because, if newly\r\nthrown down, they thin out in certain places, thus allowing the lava to\r\ncross their edges. Besides, the heavy igneous fluid will often, as it moves\r\nalong, cut a channel into beds of soft mud and sand. Suppose the submarine\r\nlava F to have come in contact in this manner with the strata _a_, _b_,\r\n_c_, and that after its consolidation, the strata _d_, _e_, are thrown down\r\nin a nearly horizontal position, yet so as to lie unconformably to F, the\r\nappearance of subsequent intrusion will here be complete, although the trap\r\nis in fact contemporaneous. We must not, therefore, hastily infer that the\r\nrock F is intrusive, unless we find the strata _d_ or _e_ to have been\r\naltered at their junction, as if by heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 462. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nWhen trap dikes were described in the preceding chapter, they were shown to\r\nbe more modern than all the strata which they traverse. A basaltic dike at\r\nQuarrington Hill, near Durham, passes through coal-measures, the strata of\r\nwhich are inclined, and shifted so that those on the north side of the dike\r\nare 24 feet above the level of the corresponding beds on the south side\r\n(see section, fig. 463.). But the horizontal beds of overlying Red\r\nSandstone and Magnesian Limestone are not cut through by the dike. Now here\r\nthe coal-measures were not only deposited, but had subsequently been\r\ndisturbed, fissured, and shifted, before the fluid trap now forming the\r\ndike was introduced into a rent. It is also clear that some of the upper\r\nedges of the coal strata, together with the upper part of the dike, had\r\nbeen subsequently removed by denudation before the lower New Red Sandstone\r\nand Magnesian Limestone were superimposed. Even in this case, however,\r\nalthough the date of the volcanic eruption is brought within narrow limits,\r\nit cannot be defined with precision; it may have happened either at the\r\nclose of the Carboniferous period, or early in that of the Lower New Red\r\nSandstone, or between these two periods, when the state of the animate\r\ncreation and the physical geography of Europe were gradually changing from\r\nthe type of the Carboniferous era to that of the Permian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 463. Section at Quarrington Hill, east of\r\nDurham. (Sedgwick.)\r\n\r\n  _a._ Magnesian Limestone (Permian).\r\n  _b._ Lower New Red Sandstone.\r\n  _c._ Coal strata.]\r\n\r\nThe test of age by superposition is strictly applicable to all stratified\r\nvolcanic tuffs, according to the rules already explained in the case of\r\nother sedimentary deposits. (See p. 96.)\r\n\r\n_Test of age by organic remains._--We have seen how, in the vicinity of\r\nactive volcanos, scoriae, pumice, fine sand, and fragments of rock are\r\nthrown up into the air, and then showered down upon the land, or into\r\nneighbouring lakes or seas. In the tuffs so formed shells, corals, or\r\nany other durable organic bodies which may happen to be strewed over the\r\nbottom of a lake or sea will be imbedded, and thus continue as permanent\r\nmemorials of the geological period when the volcanic eruption occurred.\r\nTufaceous strata thus formed in the neighbourhood of Vesuvius, Etna,\r\nStromboli, and other volcanos now active in islands or near the sea, may\r\ngive information of the relative age of these tuffs at some remote\r\nfuture period when the fires of these mountains are extinguished. By\r\nsuch evidence we can distinctly establish the coincidence in age of\r\nvolcanic rocks, and the different primary, secondary, and tertiary\r\nfossiliferous strata already considered.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs now alluded to are not exclusively marine, but include, in some\r\nplaces, freshwater shells; in others, the bones of terrestrial quadrupeds.\r\nThe diversity of organic remains in formations of this nature is perfectly\r\nintelligible, if we reflect on the wide dispersion of ejected matter during\r\nlate eruptions, such as that of the volcano of Coseguina, in the province\r\nof Nicaragua, January 19. 1835. Hot cinders and fine scoriae were then cast\r\nup to a vast height, and covered the ground as they fell to the depth of\r\nmore than 10 feet, and for a distance of 8 leagues from the crater in a\r\nsoutherly direction. Birds, cattle, and wild animals were scorched to death\r\nin great numbers, and buried in these ashes. Some volcanic dust fell at\r\nChiapa, upwards of 1200 miles to windward of the volcano, a striking proof\r\nof a counter current in the upper region of the atmosphere; and some on\r\nJamaica, about 700 miles distant to the north-east. In the sea, also, at\r\nthe distance of 1100 miles from the point of eruption, Captain Eden of the\r\nConway sailed 40 miles through floating pumice, among which were some\r\npieces of considerable size.[399-A]\r\n\r\n_Test of age by mineral composition._--As sediment of homogeneous\r\ncomposition, when discharged from the mouth of a large river, is often\r\ndeposited simultaneously over a wide space, so a particular kind of lava,\r\nflowing from a crater during one eruption, may spread over an extensive\r\narea; as in Iceland in 1783, when the melted matter, pouring from Skaptar\r\nJokul, flowed in streams in opposite directions, and caused a continuous\r\nmass, the extreme points of which were 90 miles distant from each other.\r\nThis enormous current of lava varied in thickness from 100 feet to 600\r\nfeet, and in breadth from that of a narrow river gorge to 15 miles.[399-B]\r\nNow, if such a mass should afterwards be divided into separate fragments by\r\ndenudation, we might still perhaps identify the detached portions by their\r\nsimilarity in mineral composition. Nevertheless, this test will not always\r\navail the geologist; for, although there is usually a prevailing character\r\nin lava emitted during the same eruption, and even in the successive\r\ncurrents flowing from the same volcano, still, in many cases, the different\r\nparts even of one lava-stream, or, as before stated, of one continuous mass\r\nof trap, vary so much in mineral composition and texture as to render these\r\ncharacters of minor importance when compared to their value in the\r\nchronology of the fossiliferous rocks.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, be seen in the description which follows, of the European\r\ntrap rocks of different ages, that they had often a peculiar lithological\r\ncharacter, resembling the differences before remarked as existing between\r\nthe modern lavas of Vesuvius, Etna, and Chili. (See p. 378.)\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that in Auvergne, the Eifel, and other countries where\r\ntrachyte and basalt are both present, the trachytic rocks are for the most\r\npart older than the basaltic. These rocks do, indeed, sometimes alternate\r\npartially, as in the volcano of Mont Dor, in Auvergne; but the great mass\r\nof trachyte occupies in general an inferior position, and is cut through\r\nand overflowed by basalt. It can by no means be inferred that trachyte\r\npredominated greatly at one period of the earth's history and basalt at\r\nanother, for we know that trachytic lavas have been formed at many\r\nsuccessive periods, and are still emitted from many active craters; but it\r\nseems that in each region, where a long series of eruptions have occurred,\r\nthe more felspathic lavas have been first emitted, and the escape of the\r\nmore augitic kinds has followed. The hypothesis suggested by Mr. Scrope\r\nmay, perhaps, afford a solution of this problem. The minerals, he observes,\r\nwhich abound in basalt are of greater specific gravity than those composing\r\nthe felspathic lavas; thus, for example, hornblende, augite, and olivine\r\nare each more than three times the weight of water; whereas common felspar,\r\nalbite, and Labrador felspar, have each scarcely more than 2-1/2 times the\r\nspecific gravity of water; and the difference is increased in consequence\r\nof there being much more iron in a metallic state in basalt and greenstone\r\nthan in trachyte and other felspathic lavas and traps. If, therefore, a\r\nlarge quantity of rock be melted up in the bowels of the earth by volcanic\r\nheat, the denser ingredients of the boiling fluid may sink to the bottom,\r\nand the lighter remaining above would in that case be first propelled\r\nupwards to the surface by the expansive power of gases. Those materials,\r\ntherefore, which occupied the lowest place in the subterranean reservoir\r\nwill always be emitted last, and take the uppermost place on the exterior\r\nof the earth's crust.\r\n\r\n_Test by included fragments._--We may sometimes discover the relative age\r\nof two trap rocks, or of an aqueous deposit and the trap on which it rests,\r\nby finding fragments of one included in the other, in cases such as those\r\nbefore alluded to, where the evidence of superposition alone would be\r\ninsufficient. It is also not uncommon to find conglomerates almost\r\nexclusively composed of rolled pebbles of trap, associated with stratified\r\nrocks in the neighbourhood of masses of intrusive trap. If the pebbles\r\nagree generally in mineral character with the latter, we are then enabled\r\nto determine the age of the intrusive rock by knowing that of the\r\nfossiliferous strata associated with the conglomerate. The origin of such\r\nconglomerates is explained by observing the shingle beaches composed of\r\ntrap pebbles in modern volcanic islands, or at the base of Etna.\r\n\r\n_Post-Pliocene Period (including the Recent)._--I shall now select examples\r\nof contemporaneous volcanic rocks of successive geological periods, to show\r\nthat igneous causes have been in activity in all past ages of the world,\r\nand that they have been ever shifting the places where they have broken out\r\nat the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nOne portion of the lavas, tuffs, and trap dikes of Etna, Vesuvius, and\r\nthe Island of Ischia, has been produced within the historical era;\r\nanother, and a far more considerable part, originated at times\r\nimmediately antecedent, when the waters of the Mediterranean were\r\nalready inhabited by the existing species of testacea. The southern and\r\neastern flanks of Etna are skirted by a fringe of alternating\r\nsedimentary and volcanic deposits, of submarine origin, as at Aderno,\r\nTrezza, and other places. Of sixty-five species of fossil shells which I\r\nprocured in 1828 from this formation, near Trezza, it was impossible to\r\ndistinguish any from species now living in the neighbouring sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 464. View of the Isle of Cyclops in the Bay\r\nof Trezza.[401-A]]\r\n\r\nThe Cyclopian Islands, called by the Sicilians Dei Faraglioni, in the\r\nsea cliffs of which these beds of clay, tuff, and associated lava are\r\nlaid open to view, are situated in the Bay of Trezza, and may be\r\nregarded as the extremity of a promontory severed from the main land.\r\nHere numerous proofs are seen of submarine eruptions, by which the\r\nargillaceous and sandy strata were invaded and cut through, and\r\ntufaceous breccias formed. Inclosed in these breccias are many angular\r\nand hardened fragments of laminated clay in different states of\r\nalteration by heat, and intermixed with volcanic sands.\r\n\r\nThe loftiest of the Cyclopian islets, or rather rocks, is about 200 feet in\r\nheight, the summit being formed of a mass of stratified clay, the laminae of\r\nwhich are occasionally subdivided by thin arenaceous layers. These strata\r\ndip to the N.W., and rest on a mass of columnar lava (see fig. 464.) in\r\nwhich the tops of the pillars are weathered, and so rounded as to be often\r\nhemispherical. In some places in the adjoining and largest islet of the\r\ngroup, which lies to the north-eastward of that represented in the drawing\r\n(fig. 464.), the overlying clay has been greatly altered, and hardened by\r\nthe igneous rock, and occasionally contorted in the most extraordinary\r\nmanner; yet the lamination has not been obliterated, but, on the contrary,\r\nrendered much more conspicuous, by the indurating process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 465. Contortions of strata in the largest of\r\nthe Cyclopian Islands.]\r\n\r\nIn the annexed woodcut (fig. 465.) I have represented a portion of the\r\naltered rock, a few feet square, where the alternating thin laminae of sand\r\nand clay have put on the appearance which we often observe in some of the\r\nmost contorted of the metamorphic schists.\r\n\r\nA great fissure, running from east to west, nearly divides this larger\r\nisland into two parts, and lays open its internal structure. In the section\r\nthus exhibited, a dike of lava is seen, first cutting through an older mass\r\nof lava, and then penetrating the superincumbent tertiary strata. In one\r\nplace the lava ramifies and terminates in thin veins, from a few feet to a\r\nfew inches in thickness. (See fig. 466.)\r\n\r\nThe arenaceous laminae are much hardened at the point of contact, and the\r\nclays are converted into siliceous schist. In this island the altered rocks\r\nassume a honeycombed structure on their weathered surface, singularly\r\ncontrasted with the smooth and even outline which the same beds present in\r\ntheir usual soft and yielding state.\r\n\r\nThe pores of the lava are sometimes coated, or entirely filled, with\r\ncarbonate of lime, and with a zeolite resembling analcime, which has been\r\ncalled cyclopite. The latter mineral has also been found in small fissures\r\ntraversing the altered marl, showing that the same cause which introduced\r\nthe minerals into the cavities of the lava, whether we suppose sublimation\r\nor aqueous infiltration, conveyed it also into the open rents of the\r\ncontiguous sedimentary strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 466. Post-Pliocene strata invaded by lava, Isle of\r\nCyclops (horizontal section).\r\n\r\n  _a._ Lava.\r\n  _b._ Laminated clay and sand.\r\n  _c._ The same altered.]\r\n\r\n_Post-Pliocene formations near Naples._--I have traced in the \"Principles\r\nof Geology\" the history of the changes which the volcanic region of\r\nCampania is known to have undergone during the last 2000 years. The\r\naggregate effect of igneous operations during that period is far from\r\ninsignificant, comprising as it does the formation of the modern cone of\r\nVesuvius since the year 79, and the production of several minor cones in\r\nIschia, together with that of Monte Nuovo in the year 1538. Lava-currents\r\nhave also flowed upon the land and along the bottom of the sea--volcanic\r\nsand, pumice, and scoriae have been showered down so abundantly, that whole\r\ncities were buried--tracts of the sea have been filled up or converted into\r\nshoals--and tufaceous sediment has been transported by rivers and\r\nland-floods to the sea. There are also proofs, during the same recent\r\nperiod, of a permanent alteration of the relative levels of the land and\r\nsea in several places, and of the same tract having, near Puzzuoli, been\r\nalternately upheaved and depressed to the amount of more than 20 feet. In\r\nconnection with these convulsions, there are found, on the shores of the\r\nBay of Baiae, recent tufaceous strata, filled with articles fabricated by\r\nthe hands of man, and mingled with marine shells.\r\n\r\nIt was also stated in this work (p. 113.), that when we examine this same\r\nregion, it is found to consist largely of tufaceous strata, of a date\r\nanterior to human history or tradition, which are of such thickness as to\r\nconstitute hills from 500 to more than 2000 feet in height. These\r\npost-pliocene strata, containing recent marine shells, alternate with\r\ndistinct currents and sheets of lava which were of contemporaneous origin;\r\nand we find that in Vesuvius itself, the ancient cone called Somma is of\r\nfar greater volume than the modern cone, and is intersected by a far\r\ngreater number of dikes. In contrasting this ancient part of the mountain\r\nwith that of modern date, one principal point of difference is observed;\r\nnamely, the greater frequency in the older cone of fragments of altered\r\nsedimentary rocks ejected during eruptions. We may easily conceive that the\r\nfirst explosions would act with the greatest violence, rending and\r\nshattering whatever solid masses obstructed the escape of lava and the\r\naccompanying gases, so that great heaps of ejected pieces of rock would\r\nnaturally occur in the tufaceous breccias formed by the earliest eruptions.\r\nBut when a passage had once been opened, and an habitual vent established,\r\nthe materials thrown out would consist of liquid lava, which would take the\r\nform of sand and scoriae, or of angular fragments of such solid lavas as may\r\nhave choked up the vent.\r\n\r\nAmong the fragments which abound in the tufaceous breccias of Somma, none\r\nare more common than a saccharoid dolomite, supposed to have been derived\r\nfrom an ordinary limestone altered by heat and volcanic vapours.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime enters into the composition of so many of the simple\r\nminerals found in Somma, that M. Mitscherlich, with much probability,\r\nascribes their great variety to the action of the volcanic heat on\r\nsubjacent masses of limestone.\r\n\r\n_Dikes of Somma._--The dikes seen in the great escarpment which Somma\r\npresents towards the modern cone of Vesuvius are very numerous. They are\r\nfor the most part vertical, and traverse at right angles the beds of\r\nlava, scoriae, volcanic breccia, and sand, of which the ancient cone is\r\ncomposed. They project in relief several inches, or sometimes feet, from\r\nthe face of the cliff, being extremely compact, and less destructible\r\nthan the intersected tuffs and porous lavas. In vertical extent they\r\nvary from a few yards to 500 feet, and in breadth from 1 to 12 feet.\r\nMany of them cut all the inclined beds in the escarpment of Somma from\r\ntop to bottom, others stop short before they ascend above half way, and\r\na few terminate at both ends, either in a point or abruptly. In mineral\r\ncomposition they scarcely differ from the lavas of Somma, the rock\r\nconsisting of a base of leucite and augite, through which large crystals\r\nof augite and some of leucite are scattered.[404-A] Examples are not\r\nrare of one dike cutting through another, and in one instance a shift or\r\nfault is seen at the point of intersection.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, the rents seem to have been filled laterally, when\r\nthe walls of the crater had been broken by star-shaped cracks, as seen in\r\nthe accompanying woodcut (fig. 467.). But the shape of these rents is an\r\nexception to the general rule; for nothing is more remarkable than the\r\nusual parallelism of the opposite sides of the dikes, which correspond\r\nalmost as regularly as the two opposite faces of a wall of masonry. This\r\ncharacter appears at first the more inexplicable, when we consider how\r\njagged and uneven are the rents caused by earthquakes in masses of\r\nheterogeneous composition, like those composing the cone of Somma. In\r\nexplanation of this phenomenon, M. Necker refers us to Sir W. Hamilton's\r\naccount of an eruption of Vesuvius in the year 1779, who records the\r\nfollowing facts:--\"The lavas, when they either boiled over the crater, or\r\nbroke out from the conical parts of the volcano, constantly formed channels\r\nas regular as if they had been cut by art down the steep part of the\r\nmountain; and, whilst in a state of perfect fusion, continued their course\r\nin those channels, which were sometimes full to the brim, and at other\r\ntimes more or less so, according to the quantity of matter in motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 467. Dikes or veins at the Punta del Nasone on\r\nSomma. (Necker.[405-A])]\r\n\r\n\"These channels, upon examination after an eruption, I have found to be in\r\ngeneral from two to five or six feet wide, and seven or eight feet deep.\r\nThey were often hid from the sight by a quantity of scoriae that had formed\r\na crust over them; and the lava, having been conveyed in a covered way for\r\nsome yards, came out fresh again into an open channel. After an eruption, I\r\nhave walked in some of those subterraneous or covered galleries, which were\r\nexceedingly curious, the sides, top, and bottom _being worn perfectly\r\nsmooth and even_ in most parts, by the violence of the currents of the\r\nred-hot lavas which they had conveyed for many weeks successively.\"[405-B]\r\n\r\nNow, the walls of a vertical fissure, through which lava has ascended in\r\nits way to a volcanic vent, must have been exposed to the same erosion as\r\nthe sides of the channels before adverted to. The prolonged and uniform\r\nfriction of the heavy fluid, as it is forced and made to flow upwards,\r\ncannot fail to wear and smooth down the surfaces on which it rubs, and the\r\nintense heat must melt all such masses as project and obstruct the passage\r\nof the incandescent fluid.\r\n\r\nThe texture of the Vesuvian dikes is different at the edges and in the\r\nmiddle. Towards the centre, observes M. Necker, the rock is larger\r\ngrained, the component elements being in a far more crystalline state;\r\nwhile at the edge the lava is sometimes vitreous, and always finer\r\ngrained. A thin parting band, approaching in its character to\r\npitchstone, occasionally intervenes, on the contact of the vertical dike\r\nand intersected beds. M. Necker mentions one of these at the place\r\ncalled Primo Monte, in the Atrio del Cavallo; and when on Somma, in\r\n1828, I saw three or four others in different parts of the great\r\nescarpment. These phenomena are in perfect harmony with the results of\r\nthe experiments of Sir James Hall and Mr. Gregory Watt, which have shown\r\nthat a glassy texture is the effect of sudden cooling, and that, on the\r\ncontrary, a crystalline grain is produced where fused minerals are\r\nallowed to consolidate slowly and tranquilly under high pressure.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the central portion of the lava in a fissure would,\r\nduring consolidation, part with its heat more slowly than the sides,\r\nalthough the contrast of circumstances would not be so great as when we\r\ncompare the lava at the bottom and at the surface of a current flowing in\r\nthe open air. In this case the uppermost part, where it has been in contact\r\nwith the atmosphere, and where refrigeration has been most rapid, is always\r\nfound to consist of scoriform, vitreous, and porous lava; while at a\r\ngreater depth the mass assumes a more lithoidal structure, and then becomes\r\nmore and more stony as we descend, until at length we are able to recognize\r\nwith a magnifying glass the simple minerals of which the rock is composed.\r\nOn penetrating still deeper, we can detect the constituent parts by the\r\nnaked eye, and in the Vesuvian currents distinct crystals of augite and\r\nleucite become apparent.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon, observes M. Necker, may readily be exhibited on a\r\nsmaller scale, if we detach a piece of liquid lava from a moving current.\r\nThe fragment cools instantly, and we find the surface covered with a\r\nvitreous coat; while the interior, although extremely fine-grained, has a\r\nmore stony appearance.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be observed, that although the lateral portions of the\r\ndikes are finer grained than the central, yet the vitreous parting layer\r\nbefore alluded to is rare in Vesuvius. This may, perhaps, be accounted for,\r\nas the above-mentioned author suggests, by the great heat which the walls\r\nof a fissure may acquire before the fluid mass begins to consolidate, in\r\nwhich case the lava, even at the sides, would cool very slowly. Some\r\nfissures, also, may be filled from above, as frequently happens in the\r\nvolcanos of the Sandwich Islands, according to the observations of Mr.\r\nDana; and in this case the refrigeration at the sides would be more rapid\r\nthan when the melted matter flowed upwards from the volcanic foci, in an\r\nintensely heated state. Mr. Darwin informs me that in St. Helena almost\r\nevery dike has a vitreous selvage.\r\n\r\nThe rock composing the dikes both in the modern and ancient part of\r\nVesuvius is far more compact than that of ordinary lava, for the pressure\r\nof a column of melted matter in a fissure greatly exceeds that in an\r\nordinary stream of lava; and pressure checks the expansion of those gases\r\nwhich give rise to vesicles in lava.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency in almost all the Vesuvian dikes to divide into\r\nhorizontal prisms, a phenomenon in accordance with the formation of\r\nvertical columns in horizontal beds of lava; for in both cases the\r\ndivisions which give rise to the prismatic structure are at right angles to\r\nthe cooling surfaces.\r\n\r\n_Newer Pliocene Period--Val di Noto._--I have already alluded (see p. 150.)\r\nto the igneous rocks which are associated with a great marine formation of\r\nlimestone, sand, and marl, in the southern part of Sicily, as at Vizzini\r\nand other places. In this formation, which was shown to belong to the Newer\r\nPliocene period, large beds of oysters and corals repose upon lava, and are\r\nunaltered at the point of contact. In other places we find dikes of igneous\r\nrock intersecting the fossiliferous beds, and converting the clays into\r\nsiliceous schist, the laminae being contorted and shivered into innumerable\r\nfragments at the junction, as near the town of Vizzini.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic formations of the Val di Noto usually consist of the most\r\nordinary variety of basalt, with or without olivine. The rock is sometimes\r\ncompact, often very vesicular. The vesicles are occasionally empty, both in\r\ndikes and currents, and are in some localities filled with calcareous spar,\r\narragonite, and zeolites. The structure is, in some places, spheroidal; in\r\nothers, though rarely, columnar. I found dikes of amygdaloid, wacke, and\r\nprismatic basalt, intersecting the limestone at the bottom of the hollow\r\ncalled Gozzo degli Martiri, below Melilli.\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Fig. 468. Fig. 469. Ground-plan of dikes near Palagonia.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Lava.\r\n  _b._ Peperino, consisting of volcanic sand, mixed with fragments of lava\r\n       and limestone.]\r\n\r\n_Dikes._--Dikes of vesicular and amygdaloidal lava are also seen traversing\r\nmarine tuff or peperino, west of Palagonia, some of the pores of the lava\r\nbeing empty, while others are filled with carbonate of lime. In such cases,\r\nwe may suppose the peperino to have resulted from showers of volcanic sand\r\nand scoriae, together with fragments of limestone, thrown out by a submarine\r\nexplosion, similar to that which gave rise to Graham Island in 1831. When\r\nthe mass was, to a certain degree, consolidated, it may have been rent\r\nopen, so that the lava ascended through fissures, the walls of which were\r\nperfectly even and parallel. After the melted matter that filled the rent\r\nin fig. 468. had cooled down, it must have been fractured and shifted\r\nhorizontally by a lateral movement.\r\n\r\nIn the second figure (fig. 469.), the lava has more the appearance of a\r\nvein which forced its way through the peperino. It is highly probable that\r\nsimilar appearances would be seen, if we could examine the floor of the sea\r\nin that part of the Mediterranean where the waves have recently washed away\r\nthe new volcanic island; for when a superincumbent mass of ejected\r\nfragments has been removed by denudation, we may expect to see sections of\r\ndikes traversing tuff, or, in other words, sections of the channels of\r\ncommunication by which the subterranean lavas reached the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[399-A] Caldcleugh, Phil.

The vents of eruption range entirely within a narrow\r\nband running north and south; and the branches, which are represented as\r\nextending eastward in the map, are formed simply of two lava-streams--those\r\nof Castell Follit and Cellent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 470. Volcanic district of Catalonia.]\r\n\r\nDr. Maclure, the American geologist, was the first who made known the\r\nexistence of these volcanos[409-A]; and, according to his description, the\r\nvolcanic region extended over twenty square leagues, from Amer to Massanet.\r\nI searched in vain in the environs of Massanet, in the Pyrenees, for traces\r\nof a lava-current; and I can say, with confidence, that the adjoining map\r\ngives a correct view of the true area of the volcanic action.\r\n\r\n_Geological structure of the district._--The eruptions have burst entirely\r\nthrough fossiliferous rocks, composed in great part of grey and greenish\r\nsandstone and conglomerate, with some thick beds of nummulitic limestone.\r\nThe conglomerate contains pebbles of quartz, limestone, and Lydian stone.\r\nThis system of rocks is very extensively spread throughout Catalonia; one\r\nof its members being a red sandstone, to which the celebrated salt-rock of\r\nCardona, usually considered as of the cretaceous era, is subordinate.\r\n\r\nNear Amer, in the Valley of the Ter, on the southern borders of the region\r\ndelineated in the map, primary rocks are seen, consisting of gneiss,\r\nmica-schist, and clay-slate. They run in a line nearly parallel to the\r\nPyrenees, and throw off the fossiliferous strata from their flanks, causing\r\nthem to dip to the north and north-west. This dip, which is towards the\r\nPyrenees, is connected with a distinct axis of elevation, and prevails\r\nthrough the whole area described in the map, the inclination of the beds\r\nbeing sometimes at an angle of between 40 and 50 degrees.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the physical geography of the country has undergone\r\nno material change since the commencement of the era of the volcanic\r\neruptions, except such as has resulted from the introduction of new\r\nhills of scoriae, and currents of lava upon the surface. If the lavas\r\ncould be remelted and poured out again from their respective craters,\r\nthey would descend the same valleys in which they are now seen, and\r\nre-occupy the spaces which they at present fill. The only difference in\r\nthe external configuration of the fresh lavas would consist in this,\r\nthat they would nowhere be intersected by ravines, or exhibit marks of\r\nerosion by running water.\r\n\r\n_Volcanic cones and lavas._--There are about fourteen distinct cones with\r\ncraters in this part of Spain, besides several points whence lavas may have\r\nissued; all of them arranged along a narrow line running north and south,\r\nas will be seen in the map. The greatest number of perfect cones are in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of Olot, some of which (Nos. 2, 3. and 5.) are\r\nrepresented in the annexed woodcut; and the level plain on which that town\r\nstands has clearly been produced by the flowing down of many lava-streams\r\nfrom those hills into the bottom of a valley, probably once of considerable\r\ndepth, like those of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 471. View of the Volcanos around Olot in Catalonia.]\r\n\r\nIn this drawing an attempt is made to represent, by the shading of the\r\nlandscape, the different geological formations of which the country is\r\ncomposed.[410-A] The white line of mountains (No. 1.) in the distance is\r\nthe Pyrenees, which are to the north of the spectator, and consist of\r\nhypogene and ancient fossiliferous rocks. In front of these are the\r\nfossiliferous formations (No. 4.) which are in shade. The hills 2, 3. 5.\r\nare volcanic cones, and the rest of the ground on which the sunshine falls\r\nis strewed over with volcanic ashes and lava.\r\n\r\nThe Fluvia, which flows near the town of Olot, has cut to the depth of only\r\n40 feet through the lavas of the plain before mentioned. The bed of the\r\nriver is hard basalt; and at the bridge of Santa Madalena are seen two\r\ndistinct lava-currents, one above the other, separated by a horizontal bed\r\nof scoriae 8 feet thick.\r\n\r\nIn one place, to the south of Olot, the even surface of the plain is\r\nbroken by a mound of lava, called the \"Bosque de Tosca,\" the upper part\r\nof which is scoriaceous, and covered with enormous heaps of fragments of\r\nbasalt, more or less porous. Between the numerous hummocks thus formed\r\nare deep cavities, having the appearance of small craters. The whole\r\nprecisely resembles some of the modern currents of Etna, or that of\r\nCome, near Clermont; the last of which, like the Bosque de Tosca,\r\nsupports only a scanty vegetation.\r\n\r\nMost of the Catalonian volcanos are as entire as those in the neighbourhood\r\nof Naples, or on the flanks of Etna. One of these, called Montsacopa (No.\r\n3. fig. 471.), is of a very regular form, and has a circular depression or\r\ncrater at the summit. It is chiefly made up of red scoriae,\r\nundistinguishable from that of the minor cones of Etna. The neighbouring\r\nhills of Olivet (No. 2.) and Garrinada (No. 5.) are of similar composition\r\nand shape. The largest crater of the whole district occurs farther to the\r\neast of Olot, and is called Santa Margarita. It is 455 feet deep, and about\r\na mile in circumference. Like Astroni, near Naples, it is richly covered\r\nwith wood, wherein game of various kinds abounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 472. Cross section.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Secondary conglomerate.\r\n  _b._ Thin seams of volcanic sand and scoriae.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the volcanos of Catalonia have broken out through sandstone,\r\nshale, and limestone, as have those of the Eifel, in Germany, to be\r\ndescribed in the sequel, there is a remarkable difference in the nature of\r\nthe ejections composing the cones in these two regions. In the Eifel, the\r\nquantity of pieces of sandstone and shale thrown out from the vents is\r\noften so immense as far to exceed in volume the scoriae, pumice, and lava;\r\nbut I sought in vain in the cones near Olot for a single fragment of any\r\nextraneous rock; and Don Francisco Bolos, an eminent botanist of Olot,\r\ninformed me that he had never been able to detect any. Volcanic sand and\r\nashes are not confined to the cones, but have been sometimes scattered by\r\nthe wind over the country, and drifted into narrow valleys, as is seen\r\nbetween Olot and Cellent, where the annexed section (fig. 472.) is exposed.\r\nThe light cindery volcanic matter rests in thin regular layers, just as it\r\nalighted on the slope formed by the solid conglomerate. No flood could have\r\npassed through the valley since the scoriae fell, or these would have been\r\nfor the most part removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 473. Section above the bridge of Cellent.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Scoriaceous lava.\r\n  _b._ Schistose basalt.\r\n  _c._ Columnar basalt.\r\n  _d._ Scoria, vegetable soil, and alluvium.\r\n  _e._ Nummulitic limestone.\r\n  _.f_ Micaceous grey sandstone.]\r\n\r\nThe currents of lava in Catalonia, like those of Auvergne, the Vivarais,\r\nIceland, and all mountainous countries, are of considerable depth in narrow\r\ndefiles, but spread out into comparatively thin sheets in places where the\r\nvalleys widen. If a river has flowed on nearly level ground, as in the\r\ngreat plain near Olot, the water has only excavated a channel of slight\r\ndepth; but where the declivity is great, the stream has cut a deep section,\r\nsometimes by penetrating directly through the central part of a\r\nlava-current, but more frequently by passing between the lava and the\r\nsecondary rock which bounds the valley. Thus, in the accompanying section,\r\nat the bridge of Cellent, six miles east of Olot, we see the lava on one\r\nside of the small stream; while the inclined stratified rocks constitute\r\nthe channel and opposite bank. The upper part of the lava at that place, as\r\nis usual in the currents of Etna and Vesuvius, is scoriaceous; farther down\r\nit becomes less porous, and assumes a spheroidal structure; still lower it\r\ndivides in horizontal plates, each about 2 inches in thickness, and is more\r\ncompact. Lastly, at the bottom is a mass of prismatic basalt about 5 feet\r\nthick. The vertical columns often rest immediately on the subjacent\r\nsecondary rocks; but there is sometimes an intervention of such sand and\r\nscoriae as cover the country during volcanic eruptions, and which when\r\nunprotected, as here, by superincumbent lava, is washed away from the\r\nsurface of the land. Sometimes, the bed _d_ contains a few pebbles and\r\nangular fragments of rock; in other places fine earth, which may have\r\nconstituted an ancient vegetable soil.\r\n\r\nIn several localities, beds of sand and ashes are interposed between the\r\nlava and subjacent stratified rock, as may be seen if we follow the course\r\nof the lava-current which descends from Las Planas towards Amer, and stops\r\ntwo miles short of that town. The river there has often cut through the\r\nlava, and through 18 feet of underlying limestone. Occasionally an\r\nalluvium, several feet thick, is interspersed between the igneous and\r\nmarine formation; and it is interesting to remark that in this, as in other\r\nbeds of pebbles occupying a similar position, there are no rounded\r\nfragments of lava; whereas in the most modern gravel-beds of rivers of this\r\ncountry, volcanic pebbles are abundant.\r\n\r\nThe deepest excavation made by a river through lava, which I observed in\r\nthis part of Spain, is that seen in the bottom of a valley near San Feliu\r\nde Pallerols, opposite the Castell de Stolles. The lava there has filled up\r\nthe bottom of a valley, and a narrow ravine has been cut through it to the\r\ndepth of 100 feet. In the lower part the lava has a columnar structure. A\r\ngreat number of ages were probably required for the erosion of so deep a\r\nravine; but we have no reason to infer that this current is of higher\r\nantiquity than those of the plain near Olot. The fall of the ground, and\r\nconsequent velocity of the stream, being in this case greater, a more\r\nconsiderable volume of rock may have been removed in the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 474. Section at Castell Follit.\r\n\r\n  A. Church and town of Castell Follit, overlooking precipices of basalt.\r\n  B. Small island, on each side of which branches of the river Teronel flow\r\n     to meet the Fluvia.\r\n  _c._ Precipice of basaltic lava, chiefly columnar, about 130 feet\r\n     in height.\r\n  _d._ Ancient alluvium, underlying the lava-current.\r\n  _e._ Inclined strata of secondary sandstone.]\r\n\r\nI shall describe one more section to elucidate the phenomena of this\r\ndistrict. A lava-stream, flowing from a ridge of hills on the east of\r\nOlot, descends a considerable slope, until it reaches the valley of the\r\nriver Fluvia. Here, for the first time, it comes in contact with running\r\nwater, which has removed a portion, and laid open its internal structure\r\nin a precipice about 130 feet in height, at the edge of which stands the\r\ntown of Castell Follit.\r\n\r\nBy the junction of the rivers Fluvia and Teronel, the mass of lava has been\r\ncut away on two sides; and the insular rock B (fig. 474.) has been left,\r\nwhich was probably never so high as the cliff A, as it may have constituted\r\nthe lower part of the sloping side of the original current.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of the vertical cliffs, it appears that the upper part\r\nof the lava on which the town is built is scoriaceous, passing downwards\r\ninto a spheroidal basalt; some of the huge spheroids being no less than 6\r\nfeet in diameter. Below this is a more compact basalt, with crystals of\r\nolivine. There are in all five distinct ranges of basalt, the uppermost\r\nspheroidal, and the rest prismatic, separated by thinner beds not columnar,\r\nand some of which are schistose. These were probably formed by successive\r\nflows of lava, whether during the same eruption or at different periods.\r\nThe whole mass rests on alluvium, ten or twelve feet in thickness, composed\r\nof pebbles of limestone and quartz, but without any intermixture of igneous\r\nrocks; in which circumstance alone it appears to differ from the modern\r\ngravel of the Fluvia.\r\n\r\n_Bufadors._--The volcanic rocks near Olot have often a cavernous structure,\r\nlike some of the lavas of Etna; and in many parts of the hill of Batet, in\r\nthe environs of the town, the sound returned by the earth, when struck, is\r\nlike that of an archway. At the base of the same hill are the mouths of\r\nseveral subterranean caverns, about twelve in number, which are called in\r\nthe country \"bufadors,\" from which a current of cold air issues during\r\nsummer, but which in winter is said to be scarcely perceptible. I visited\r\none of these bufadors in the beginning of August, 1830, when the heat of\r\nthe season was unusually intense, and found a cold wind blowing from it,\r\nwhich may easily be explained; for as the external air, when rarefied by\r\nheat, ascends, the pressure of the colder and heavier air of the caverns in\r\nthe interior of the mountain causes it to rush out to supply its place.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the age of these Spanish volcanos, attempts have been made\r\nto prove, that in this country, as well as in Auvergne and the Eifel,\r\nthe earliest inhabitants were eye-witnesses to the volcanic action. In\r\nthe year 1421, it is said, when Olot was destroyed by an earthquake, an\r\neruption broke out near Amer, and consumed the town. The researches of\r\nDon Francisco Bolos have, I think, shown, in the most satisfactory\r\nmanner, that there is no good historical foundation for the latter part\r\nof this story; and any geologist who has visited Amer must be convinced\r\nthat there never was any eruption on that spot. It is true that, in the\r\nyear above mentioned, the whole of Olot, with the exception of a single\r\nhouse, was cast down by an earthquake; one of those shocks which, at\r\ndistant intervals during the last five centuries, have shaken the\r\nPyrenees, and particularly the country between Perpignan and Olot, where\r\nthe movements, at the period alluded to, were most violent.\r\n\r\nThe annihilation of the town may, perhaps, have been due to the cavernous\r\nnature of the subjacent rocks; for Catalonia is beyond the line of those\r\nEuropean earthquakes which have, within the period of history, destroyed\r\ntowns throughout extensive areas.\r\n\r\nAs we have no historical records, then, to guide us in regard to the\r\nextinct volcanos, we must appeal to geological monuments. The annexed\r\ndiagram will present to the reader, in a synoptical form, the results\r\nobtained from numerous sections.\r\n\r\nThe more modern alluvium (_d_) is partial, and has been formed by the\r\naction of rivers and floods upon the lava; whereas the older gravel (_b_)\r\nwas strewed over the country before the volcanic eruptions. In neither have\r\nany organic remains been discovered; so that we can merely affirm, as yet,\r\nthat the volcanos broke out after the elevation of some of the newest rocks\r\nof the nummulitic (Eocene?) series of Catalonia, and before the formation\r\nof an alluvium (_d_) of unknown date. The integrity of the cones merely\r\nshows that the country has not been agitated by violent earthquakes, or\r\nsubjected to the action of any great transient flood since their origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 475. Superposition of rocks in the volcanic\r\ndistrict of Catalonia.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Sandstone and nummulitic limestone.\r\n  _b._ Older alluvium without volcanic pebbles.\r\n  _c._ Cones of scoriae and lava.\r\n  _d._ Newer alluvium.]\r\n\r\nEast of Olot, on the Catalonian coast, marine tertiary strata occur, which,\r\nnear Barcelona, attain the height of about 500 feet. From the shells which\r\nI collected, these strata appear to correspond in age with the Subapennine\r\nbeds; and it is not improbable that their upheaval from beneath the sea\r\ntook place during the period of volcanic eruption round Olot. In that case\r\nthese eruptions may have occurred at the close of the Older Pliocene era,\r\nbut perhaps subsequently, for their age is at present quite uncertain.\r\n\r\n_Miocene period--Volcanic rocks of the Eifel._--The chronological relations\r\nof the volcanic rocks of the Lower Rhine and the Eifel are also involved in\r\na considerable degree of ambiguity; but we know that some portion of them\r\nwere coeval with the deposition of a tertiary formation, called\r\n\"Brown-Coal\" by the Germans, which probably belongs to the Miocene, if not\r\nreferable to the Upper Eocene, epoch.\r\n\r\nThis Brown-Coal is seen on both sides of the Rhine, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Bonn, resting unconformably on highly inclined and vertical strata of\r\nSilurian and Devonian rocks. Its position, and the space occupied by the\r\nvolcanic rocks, both of the Westerwald and Eifel, will be seen by\r\nreferring to the map in the next page (fig. 476.), for which I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Horner, whose residence in the country has enabled him\r\nto verify the maps of MM. Noeggerath and Von Oeynhausen, from which that\r\nnow given has been principally compiled.\r\n\r\nThe Brown-Coal formation consists of beds of loose sand, sandstone, and\r\nconglomerate, clay with nodules of clay-ironstone, and occasionally silex.\r\nLayers of light brown, and sometimes black lignite, are interstratified\r\nwith the clays and sands, and often irregularly diffused through them. They\r\ncontain numerous impressions of leaves and stems of trees, and are\r\nextensively worked for fuel, whence the name of the formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 476. Map of the volcanic region of the Upper\r\nand Lower Eifel.\r\n\r\n  ____1____2____3____4____5 English Miles.\r\n\r\n  Volcanic District {A. of the Upper Eifel.\r\n                    {B. of the Lower Eifel.\r\n  Trachyte.\r\n  Points of eruption, with craters and scoriae.\r\n  Basalt.\r\n  Brown-coal.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ The country in that part of the map which is left blank is composed\r\nof inclined Silurian and Devonian rocks.]\r\n\r\nIn several places, layers of trachytic tuff are interstratified, and in\r\nthese tuffs are leaves of plants identical with those found in the\r\nbrown-coal, showing that, during the period of the accumulation of the\r\nlatter, some volcanic products were ejected.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of wood in the lignite are said to belong entirely to\r\ndicotyledonous trees; but among the impressions of leaves, collected by Mr.\r\nHorner, some were referred by Mr. Lindley to a palm, perhaps of the genus\r\n_Chamaerops_, and others resembled the _Cinnamomum dulce_, and _Podocarpus\r\nmacrophylla_, which would also indicate a warm climate.[416-A]\r\n\r\nThe other organic remains of the brown-coal are principally fishes; they\r\nare found in a bituminous shale, called paper-coal, from being divisible\r\ninto extremely thin leaves. The individuals are very numerous; but they\r\nappear to belong to about five species, which M. Agassiz informs me are all\r\nextinct, and hitherto peculiar to this brown-coal. They belong to the\r\nfreshwater genera _Leuciscus_, _Aspius_, and _Perca_. The remains of frogs\r\nalso, of an extinct species, have been discovered in the paper-coal; and a\r\ncomplete series may be seen in the museum at Bonn, from the most imperfect\r\nstate of the tadpole to that of the full-grown animal. With these a\r\nsalamander, scarcely distinguishable from the recent species, has been\r\nfound, and several remains of insects.\r\n\r\nThe brown-coal was evidently a freshwater formation; but fossil shells have\r\nbeen scarcely ever found in it; although near Marienforst, in the vicinity\r\nof Bonn, large blocks have been met with of a white opaque chert,\r\ncontaining numerous casts of freshwater shells, which appear to belong to\r\n_Planorbis rotundatus_ and _Limnea longiscata_, two species common both to\r\nthe Middle and Upper Eocene periods. It is very probable that the\r\nbrown-coal may be connected in age with those fluvio-marine formations\r\nwhich are found in higher parts of the valley of the Rhine, as at Mayence\r\nbefore mentioned (p. 177.).\r\n\r\nA vast deposit of gravel, chiefly composed of pebbles of white quartz, but\r\ncontaining also a few fragments of other rocks, lies over the brown-coal\r\nformation, forming sometimes only a thin covering, at others attaining a\r\nthickness of more than 100 feet. This gravel is very distinct in character\r\nfrom that now forming the bed of the Rhine. It is called \"Kiesel gerolle\"\r\nby the Germans, often reaches great elevations, and is covered in several\r\nplaces with volcanic ejections. It is evident that the country has\r\nundergone great changes in its physical geography since this gravel was\r\nformed; for its position has scarcely any relation to the existing drainage\r\nof the country, and all the more modern volcanic rocks of the same region\r\nare posterior to it in date.\r\n\r\nSome of the newest beds of volcanic sand, pumice, and scoriae are\r\ninterstratified near Andernach and elsewhere with the loam called loess,\r\nwhich was before described as being full of land and freshwater shells of\r\nrecent species, and referable to the Post-Pliocene period. I have before\r\nhinted (see p. 118.) that this intercalation of volcanic matter between\r\nbeds of loess may possibly be explained without supposing the last\r\neruptions of the Lower Eifel to have taken place so recently as the era of\r\nthe deposition of the loess; but farther researches should be directed to\r\nthe investigation of this curious point.\r\n\r\nThe igneous rocks of the Westerwald, and of the mountains called the\r\nSiebengebirge, consist partly of basaltic and partly of trachytic lavas,\r\nthe latter being in general the more ancient of the two. There are many\r\nvarieties of trachyte, some of which are highly crystalline, resembling a\r\ncoarse-grained granite, with large separate crystals of felspar. Trachytic\r\ntuff is also very abundant. These formations, some of which were certainly\r\ncontemporaneous with the origin of the brown-coal, were the first of a long\r\nseries of eruptions, the more recent of which happened when the country\r\nhad acquired nearly all its present geographical features.\r\n\r\n_Newer volcanos of the Eifel.--Lake-craters._--As I recognized in the\r\nmore modern volcanos of the Eifel characters distinct from any\r\npreviously observed by me in those of France, Italy, or Spain, I shall\r\nbriefly describe them. The fundamental rocks of the district are grey\r\nand red sandstones and shales, with some associated limestones, replete\r\nwith fossils of the Devonian or Old Red Sandstone group. The volcanos\r\nbroke out in the midst of these inclined strata, and when the present\r\nsystems of hills and valleys had already been formed. The eruptions\r\noccurred sometimes at the bottom of deep valleys, sometimes on the\r\nsummit of hills, and frequently on intervening platforms. In travelling\r\nthrough this district we often fall upon them most unexpectedly, and may\r\nfind ourselves on the very edge of a crater before we had been led to\r\nsuspect that we were approaching the site of any igneous outburst. Thus,\r\nfor example, on arriving at the village of Gemund, immediately south of\r\nDaun, we leave the stream, which flows at the bottom of a deep valley in\r\nwhich strata of sandstone and shale crop out. We then climb a steep\r\nhill, on the surface of which we see the edges of the same strata\r\ndipping inwards towards the mountain. When we have ascended to a\r\nconsiderable height, we see fragments of scoriae sparingly scattered over\r\nthe surface; till, at length, on reaching the summit, we find ourselves\r\nsuddenly on the edge of a _tarn_, or deep circular lake-basin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 477. The Gemunder Maar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 478. Cross section.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Village of Gemund.\r\n  _b._ Gemunder Maar.\r\n  _c._ Weinfelder Maar.\r\n  _d._ Schalkenmehren Maar.]\r\n\r\nThis, which is called the Gemunder Maar, is the first of three lakes which\r\nare in immediate contact, the same ridge forming the barrier of two\r\nneighbouring cavities (see fig. 477.). On viewing the first of these, we\r\nrecognize the ordinary form of a crater, for which we have been prepared\r\nby the occurrence of scoriae scattered over the surface of the soil. But on\r\nexamining the walls of the crater we find precipices of sandstone and shale\r\nwhich exhibit no signs of the action of heat; and we look in vain for those\r\nbeds of lava and scoriae, dipping in opposite directions on every side,\r\nwhich we have been accustomed to consider as characteristic of volcanic\r\ncraters. As we proceed, however, to the opposite side of the lake, and\r\nafterwards visit the craters _c_ and _d_ (fig. 478.), we find a\r\nconsiderable quantity of scoriae and some lava, and see the whole surface of\r\nthe soil sparkling with volcanic sand, and strewed with ejected fragments\r\nof half-fused shale, which preserves its laminated texture in the interior,\r\nwhile it has a vitrified or scoriform coating.\r\n\r\nA few miles to the south of the lakes above mentioned occurs the Pulvermaar\r\nof Gillenfeld, an oval lake of very regular form, and surrounded by an\r\nunbroken ridge of fragmentary materials, consisting of ejected shale and\r\nsandstone, and preserving a uniform height of about 150 feet above the\r\nwater. The side slope in the interior is at an angle of about 45 degrees;\r\non the exterior, of 35 degrees. Volcanic substances are intermixed very\r\nsparingly with the ejections, which in this place entirely conceal from\r\nview the stratified rocks of the country.[419-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 479. Outline of Mosenberg, Upper Eifel.]\r\n\r\nThe Meerfelder Maar is a cavity of far greater size and depth, hollowed\r\nout of similar strata; the sides presenting some abrupt sections of\r\ninclined secondary rocks, which in other places are buried under vast\r\nheaps of pulverized shale. I could discover no scoriae amongst the\r\nejected materials, but balls of olivine and other volcanic substances\r\nare mentioned as having been found.[419-B] This cavity, which we must\r\nsuppose to have discharged an immense volume of gas, is nearly a mile in\r\ndiameter, and is said to be more than one hundred fathoms deep. In the\r\nneighbourhood is a mountain called the Mosenberg, which consists of red\r\nsandstone and shale in its lower parts, but supports on its summit a\r\ntriple volcanic cone, while a distinct current of lava is seen\r\ndescending the flanks of the mountain. The edge of the crater of the\r\nlargest cone reminded me much of the form and characters of that of\r\nVesuvius; but I was much struck with the precipitous and almost\r\noverhanging wall or parapet which the scoriae presented towards the\r\nexterior, as at _a b_ (fig. 479.); which I can only explain by supposing\r\nthat fragments of red-hot lava, as they fell round the vent, were\r\ncemented together into one compact mass, in consequence of continuing to\r\nbe in a half-melted state.\r\n\r\nIf we pass from the Upper to the Lower Eifel, from A to B (see map, p.\r\n416.), we find the celebrated lake-crater of Laach, which has a greater\r\nresemblance than any of those before mentioned to the Lago di Bolsena, and\r\nothers in Italy--being surrounded by a ridge of gently sloping hills,\r\ncomposed of loose tuffs, scoriae, and blocks of a variety of lavas.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting volcanos on the left bank of the Rhine is\r\ncalled the Roderberg. It forms a circular crater nearly a quarter of a mile\r\nin diameter, and 100 feet deep, now covered with fields of corn. The highly\r\ninclined strata of ancient sandstone and shale rise even to the rim of one\r\nside of the crater; but they are overspread by quartzose gravel, and this\r\nagain is covered by volcanic scoriae and tufaceous sand. The opposite wall\r\nof the crater is composed of cinders and scorified rock, like that at the\r\nsummit of Vesuvius. It is quite evident that the eruption in this case\r\nburst through the sandstone and alluvium which immediately overlies it; and\r\nI observed some of the quartz pebbles mixed with scoriae on the flanks of\r\nthe mountain, as if they had been cast up into the air, and had fallen\r\nagain with the volcanic ashes. I have already observed, that a large part\r\nof this crater has been filled up with loess (p. 118.).\r\n\r\nThe most striking peculiarity of a great many of the craters above\r\ndescribed, is the absence of any signs of alteration or torrefaction in\r\ntheir walls, when these are composed of regular strata of ancient sandstone\r\nand shale. It is evident that the summits of hills formed of the\r\nabove-mentioned stratified rocks have, in some cases, been carried away by\r\ngaseous explosions, while at the same time no lava, and often a very small\r\nquantity only of scoriae, has escaped from the newly formed cavity. There\r\nis, indeed, no feature in the Eifel volcanos more worthy of note, than the\r\nproofs they afford of very copious aeriform discharges, unaccompanied by\r\nthe pouring out of melted matter, except, here and there, in very\r\ninsignificant volume. I know of no other extinct volcanos where gaseous\r\nexplosions of such magnitude have been attended by the emission of so small\r\na quantity of lava. Yet I looked in vain in the Eifel for any appearances\r\nwhich could lend support to the hypothesis, that the sudden rushing out of\r\nsuch enormous volumes of gas had ever lifted up the stratified rocks\r\nimmediately around the vent, so as to form conical masses, having their\r\nstrata dipping outwards on all sides from a central axis, as is assumed in\r\nthe theory of elevation craters, alluded to at the end of Chap. XXIX.\r\n\r\n_Trass._--In the Lower Eifel, eruptions of trachytic lava preceded the\r\nemission of currents of basalt, and immense quantities of pumice were\r\nthrown out wherever trachyte issued. The tufaceous alluvium called\r\n_trass_, which has covered large areas in this region and choked up some\r\nvalleys now partially re-excavated, is unstratified. Its base consists\r\nalmost entirely of pumice, in which are included fragments of basalt and\r\nother lavas, pieces of burnt shale, slate, and sandstone, and numerous\r\ntrunks and branches of trees. If this trass was formed during the period\r\nof volcanic eruptions it may perhaps have originated in the manner of\r\nthe moya of the Andes.\r\n\r\nWe may easily conceive that a similar mass might now be produced, if a\r\ncopious evolution of gases should occur in one of the lake basins. The\r\nwater might remain for weeks in a state of violent ebullition, until it\r\nbecame of the consistency of mud, just as the sea continued to be charged\r\nwith red mud round Graham's Island, in the Mediterranean, in the year 1831.\r\nIf a breach should then be made in the side of the cone, the flood would\r\nsweep away great heaps of ejected fragments of shale and sandstone, which\r\nwould be borne down into the adjoining valleys. Forests might be torn up by\r\nsuch a flood, and thus the occurrence of the numerous trunks of trees\r\ndispersed irregularly through the trass, can be explained.\r\n\r\n_Hungary._--M. Beudant, in his elaborate work on Hungary, describes five\r\ndistinct groups of volcanic rocks, which although nowhere of great\r\nextent, form striking features in the physical geography of that\r\ncountry, rising as they do abruptly from extensive plains composed of\r\ntertiary strata. They may have constituted islands in the ancient sea,\r\nas Santorin and Milo now do in the Grecian Archipelago; and M. Beudant\r\nhas remarked that the mineral products of the last-mentioned islands\r\nresemble remarkably those of the Hungarian extinct volcanos, where many\r\nof the same minerals as opal, calcedony, resinous silex (_silex\r\nresinite_), pearlite, obsidian, and pitchstone abound.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian lavas are chiefly felspathic, consisting of different\r\nvarieties of trachyte; many are cellular, and used as millstones; some so\r\nporous and even scoriform as to resemble those which have issued in the\r\nopen air. Pumice occurs in great quantity; and there are conglomerates, or\r\nrather breccias, wherein fragments of trachyte are bound together by\r\npumiceous tuff, or sometimes by silex.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these rocks were permeated by the waters of hot\r\nsprings, impregnated, like the Geysers, with silica; or in some instances,\r\nperhaps, by aqueous vapours, which, like those of Lancerote, may have\r\nprecipitated hydrate of silica.\r\n\r\nBy the influence of such springs or vapours the trunks and branches of\r\ntrees washed down during floods, and buried in tuffs on the flanks of the\r\nmountains, are supposed to have become silicified. It is scarcely possible,\r\nsays M. Beudant, to dig into any of the pumiceous deposits of these\r\nmountains without meeting with opalized wood, and sometimes entire\r\nsilicified trunks of trees of great size and weight.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the species of shells collected principally by M. Boue,\r\nand examined by M. Deshayes, that the fossil remains imbedded in the\r\nvolcanic tuffs, and in strata alternating with them in Hungary, are of\r\nthe Miocene type, and not identical, as was formerly supposed, with the\r\nfossils of the Paris basin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[409-A] Maclure, Journ. de Phys., vol. lxvi. p. 219., 1808; cited by\r\nDaubeny, Description of Volcanos, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[410-A] This view is taken from a sketch which I made on the spot in 1830.\r\n\r\n[416-A] Trans. of Geol.

I have already alluded to the grand succession of\r\nevents, of which there is evidence in Auvergne since the last retreat of\r\nthe sea (see p. 178.).\r\n\r\nThe earliest monuments of the tertiary period in that region are\r\nlacustrine deposits of great thickness (2. fig. 480. p. 424.), in the\r\nlowest conglomerates of which are rounded pebbles of quartz,\r\nmica-schist, granite, and other non-volcanic rocks, without the\r\nslightest intermixture of igneous products. To these conglomerates\r\nsucceed argillaceous and calcareous marls and limestones (3. fig. 480.)\r\ncontaining Upper Eocene shells and bones of mammalia, the higher beds\r\nof which sometimes alternate with volcanic tuff of contemporaneous\r\norigin. After the filling up or drainage of the ancient lakes, huge\r\npiles of trachytic and basaltic rocks, with volcanic breccias,\r\naccumulated to a thickness of several thousand feet, and were\r\nsuperimposed upon granite, or the contiguous lacustrine strata. The\r\ngreater portion of these igneous rocks appear to have originated during\r\nthe Miocene and Pliocene periods; and extinct quadrupeds of those eras,\r\nbelonging to the genera Mastodon, Rhinoceros, and others, were buried\r\nin ashes and beds of alluvial sand and gravel, which owe their\r\npreservation to overspreading sheets of lava.\r\n\r\nIn Auvergne the most ancient and conspicuous of the volcanic masses is\r\nMont Dor, which rests immediately on the granitic rocks standing apart\r\nfrom the freshwater strata.[422-A] This great mountain rises suddenly to\r\nthe height of several thousand feet above the surrounding platform, and\r\nretains the shape of a flattened and somewhat irregular cone, all the\r\nsides sloping more or less rapidly, until their inclination is gradually\r\nlost in the high plain around. This cone is composed of layers of\r\nscoriae, pumice-stones, and their fine detritus, with interposed beds of\r\ntrachyte and basalt, which descend often in uninterrupted sheets, till\r\nthey reach and spread themselves round the base of the mountain.[423-A]\r\nConglomerates, also, composed of angular and rounded fragments of\r\nigneous rocks, are observed to alternate with the above; and the various\r\nmasses are seen to dip off from the central axis, and to lie parallel to\r\nthe sloping flanks of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe summit of Mont Dor terminates in seven or eight rocky peaks, where no\r\nregular crater can now be traced, but where we may easily imagine one to\r\nhave existed, which may have been shattered by earthquakes, and have\r\nsuffered degradation by aqueous agents. Originally, perhaps, like the\r\nhighest crater of Etna, it may have formed an insignificant feature in the\r\ngreat pile, and may frequently have been destroyed and renovated.\r\n\r\nAccording to some geologists, this mountain, as well as Vesuvius, Etna, and\r\nall large volcanos, has derived its dome-like form not from the\r\npreponderance of eruptions from one or more central points, but from the\r\nupheaval of horizontal beds of lava and scoriae. I have explained my reasons\r\nfor objecting to this view at the close of Chap. XXIX., when speaking of\r\nPalma, and in the Principles of Geology.[423-B] The average inclination of\r\nthe dome-shaped mass of Mont Dor is 8 deg. 6', whereas in Mounts Loa and Kea,\r\nbefore mentioned, in the Sandwich Islands (see fig. 457. p. 394.), the\r\nflanks of which have been raised by recent lavas, we find from Mr. Dana's\r\ndescription that the one has a slope of 6 deg. 30', the other of 7 deg. 46'. We\r\nmay, therefore, reasonably question whether there is any absolute necessity\r\nfor supposing that the basaltic currents of the ancient French volcano were\r\nat first more horizontal than they are now. Nevertheless it is highly\r\nprobable that during the long series of eruptions required to give rise to\r\nso vast a pile of volcanic matter, which is thickest at the summit or\r\ncentre of the dome, some dislocation and upheaval took place; and during\r\nthe distension of the mass, beds of lava and scoriae may, in some places,\r\nhave acquired a greater, in others a less inclination, than that which at\r\nfirst belonged to them.\r\n\r\nRespecting the age of the great mass of Mont Dor, we cannot come at present\r\nto any positive decision, because no organic remains have yet been found in\r\nthe tuffs, except impressions of the leaves of trees of species not yet\r\ndetermined. We may certainly conclude, that the earliest eruptions were\r\nposterior in origin to those grits, and conglomerates of the freshwater\r\nformation of the Limagne, which contain no pebbles of volcanic rocks;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, some eruptions took place before the great lakes\r\nwere drained; and others occurred after the desiccation of those lakes, and\r\nwhen deep valleys had already been excavated through freshwater strata.\r\n\r\nIn the annexed section, I have endeavoured to explain the geological\r\nstructure of a portion of Auvergne, which I re-examined in 1843.[423-C] It\r\nmay convey some idea to the reader of the long and complicated series of\r\nevents, which have occurred in that country, since the first lacustrine\r\nstrata (No. 2.) were deposited on the granite (No. 1.). The changes of\r\nwhich we have evidence are the more striking, because they imply great\r\ndenudation, without there being any proofs of the intervention of the sea\r\nduring the whole period. It will be seen that the upper freshwater beds\r\n(No. 3.), once formed in a lake, must have suffered great destruction\r\nbefore the excavation of the valleys of the Couze and Allier had begun. In\r\nthese freshwater beds, Upper Eocene fossils, as described in Chap. XV.,\r\nhave been found. The basaltic dike 4' is one of many examples of the\r\nintrusion of volcanic matter through the Eocene freshwater beds, and may\r\nhave been of Upper Eocene or Miocene date, giving rise, when it reached the\r\nsurface and overflowed, to such platforms of basalt, as often cap the\r\ntertiary hills in Auvergne, and one of which (4) is seen on Mont Perrier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 480.

Granite.]\r\n\r\nIt not unfrequently happens that beds of gravel containing bones of extinct\r\nmammalia are detected under these very ancient sheets of basalt, as between\r\nNo. 4. and the freshwater strata, No. 3., at A, from which it is clear that\r\nthe surface of 3 formed at that period the lowest level at which the waters\r\nthen draining the country flowed. Next in age to this basaltic platform\r\ncomes a patch of ochreous sand and gravel (No. 5.), containing many bones\r\nof quadrupeds. Upon this rests a pumiceous breccia and conglomerate, with\r\nangular masses of trachyte, and some quartz pebbles. This deposit is\r\nfollowed by 5 _b_, which is similar to 5, and 5 _c_ similar to the\r\ntrachytic breccia 5 _a_. These two breccias are supposed, from their\r\nsimilarity to others found on Mount Dor, to have descended from the flanks\r\nof that mountain during eruptions; and the interstratified alluvial\r\ndeposits contain the remains of mastodon, rhinoceros, tapir, deer, beaver,\r\nand quadrupeds of other genera referable to about forty species, all of\r\nwhich are extinct. I formerly supposed them to belong to the same era as\r\nthe Miocene faluns of Touraine; but, whether they may not rather be\r\nascribed to the older Pliocene epoch is a question which farther inquiries\r\nand comparisons must determine.\r\n\r\nWhatever be their date in the tertiary series, they are quadrupeds which\r\ninhabited the country when the formations 5 and 5 _c_ originated.\r\nProbably they were drowned during floods, such as rush down the flanks\r\nof volcanos during eruptions, when great bodies of steam are emitted\r\nfrom the crater, or when, as we have seen, both on Etna and in Iceland\r\nin modern times, large masses of snow are suddenly melted by lava,\r\ncausing a deluge of water to bear down fragments of igneous rocks mixed\r\nwith mud, to the valleys and plains below.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the valley of the Issoire, down which these ancient\r\ninundations swept, was first excavated at the expense of the formations\r\n2, 3, and 4, and then filled up by the masses 5 and 5 _c_, after which\r\nit was re-excavated before the more modern alluviums (Nos. 6. and 7.)\r\nwere formed. In these again other fossil mammalia of distinct species\r\nhave been detected by M. Bravard, the bones of an hippopotamus having\r\nbeen found among the rest.\r\n\r\nAt length, when the valley of the Allier was eroded at Issoire down to its\r\nlowest level, a talus of angular fragments of basalt and freshwater\r\nlimestone (No. 8.) was formed, called the bone-bed of the Tour de Boulade,\r\nfrom which a great many other mammalia have been collected by MM. Bravard\r\nand Pomel. In this assemblage the _Elephas primigenius_, _Rhinoceros\r\ntichorinus_, _Deer_ (including rein-deer), _Equus_, _Bos_, _Antelope_,\r\n_Felis_, and _Canis_, were included. Even this deposit seems hardly to be\r\nthe newest in the neighbourhood, for if we cross from the town of Issoire\r\n(see fig. 480.) over Mont Perrier to the adjoining valley of the Couze, we\r\nfind another bone-bed (No. 9.), overlaid by a current of lava (No. 10.).\r\n\r\nThe history of this lava-current, which terminates a few hundred yards\r\nbelow the point No. 10., in the suburbs of the village of Nechers, is\r\ninteresting. It forms a long narrow stripe more than 13 miles in length, at\r\nthe bottom of the valley of the Couze, which flows out of a lake at the\r\nfoot of Mont Dor. This lake is caused by a barrier thrown across the\r\nancient channel of the Couze, consisting partly of the volcanic cone called\r\nthe Puy de Tartaret, formed of loose scoriae, from the base of which has\r\nissued the lava-current before mentioned. The materials of the dam which\r\nblocked up the river, and caused the Lac de Chambon, are also, in part,\r\nderived from a land-slip which may have happened at the time of the great\r\neruption which formed the cone.\r\n\r\nThis cone of Tartaret affords an impressive monument of the very different\r\ndates at which the igneous eruptions of Auvergne have happened; for it was\r\nevidently thrown up at the bottom of the existing valley, which is bounded\r\nby lofty precipices composed of sheets of ancient columnar trachyte and\r\nbasalt, which once flowed at very high levels from Mont Dor.[425-A]\r\n\r\nWhen we follow the course of the river Couze, from its source in the\r\nlake of Chambon, to the termination of the lava-current at Nechers, a\r\ndistance of thirteen miles, we find that the torrent has in most places\r\ncut a deep channel through the lava, the lower portion of which is\r\ncolumnar. In some narrow gorges it has even had power to remove the\r\nentire mass of basaltic rock, though the work of erosion must have been\r\nvery slow, as the basalt is tough and hard, and one column after another\r\nmust have been undermined and reduced to pebbles, and then to sand.\r\nDuring the time required for this operation, the perishable cone of\r\nTartaret, composed of sand and ashes, has stood uninjured, proving that\r\nno great flood or deluge can have passed over this region in the\r\ninterval between the eruption of Tartaret and our own times.\r\n\r\nIf we now return to the section (fig. 480.), I may observe that the\r\nlava-current of Tartaret, which has diminished greatly in height and\r\nvolume near its termination, presents here a steep and perpendicular\r\nface 25 feet in height towards the river. Beneath it is the alluvium No.\r\n9., consisting of a red sandy clay, which must have covered the bottom\r\nof the valley when the current of melted rock flowed down. The bones\r\nfound in this alluvium, which I obtained myself, consisted of a species\r\nof field-mouse, _Arvicola_, and the molar tooth of an extinct horse,\r\n_Equus fossilis_. The other species, obtained from the same bed, are\r\nreferable to the genera _Sus_, _Bos_, _Cervus_, _Felis_, _Canis_,\r\n_Martes_, _Talpa_, _Sorex_, _Lepus_, _Sciurus_, _Mus_, and _Lagomys_, in\r\nall no less than forty-three species, all closely allied to recent\r\nanimals, yet nearly all of them, according to M. Bravard, showing some\r\npoints of difference, like those which Mr. Owen discovered in the case\r\nof the horse above alluded to. The bones, also, of a frog, snake, and\r\nlizard, and of several birds, were associated with the fossils before\r\nenumerated, and several recent land shells, such as _Cyclostoma\r\nelegans_, _Helix hortensis_, _H. nemoralis_, _H. lapicida_, and\r\n_Clausilia rugosa_. If the animals were drowned by floods, which\r\naccompanied the eruptions of the Puy de Tartaret, they would give an\r\nexceedingly modern geological date to that event, which must, in that\r\ncase, have belonged to the Newer-Pliocene, or, perhaps, the\r\nPost-Pliocene period. That the current, which has issued from the Puy de\r\nTartaret, may nevertheless be very ancient in reference to the events of\r\nhuman history, we may conclude, not only from the divergence of the\r\nmammiferous fauna from that of our day, but from the fact that a Roman\r\nbridge of such form and construction as continued in use down to the\r\nfifth century, but which may be older, is now seen at a place about a\r\nmile and a half from St. Nectaire. This ancient bridge spans the river\r\nCouze with two arches, each about 14 feet wide. These arches spring from\r\nthe lava of Tartaret, on both banks, showing that a ravine precisely\r\nlike that now existing, had already been excavated by the river through\r\nthat lava thirteen or fourteen centuries ago.\r\n\r\nIn Central France there are several hundred minor cones, like that of\r\nTartaret, a great number of which, like Monte Nuovo, near Naples, may have\r\nbeen principally due to a single eruption. Most of these cones range in a\r\nlinear direction from Auvergne to the Vivarais, and they were faithfully\r\ndescribed so early as the year 1802, by M. de Montlosier. They have given\r\nrise chiefly to currents of basaltic lava. Those of Auvergne called the\r\nMonts Dome, placed on a granitic platform, form an irregular ridge (see\r\nfig. 436.), about 18 miles in length, and 2 in breadth. They are usually\r\ntruncated at the summit, where the crater is often preserved entire, the\r\nlava having issued from the base of the hill. But frequently the crater is\r\nbroken down on one side, where the lava has flowed out. The hills are\r\ncomposed of loose scoriae, blocks of lava, lapilli, and pozzuolana, with\r\nfragments of trachyte and granite.\r\n\r\n_Puy de Come._--The Puy de Come and its lava-current, near Clermont, may\r\nbe mentioned as one of these minor volcanos. This conical hill rises\r\nfrom the granitic platform, at an angle of about 40 deg., to the height of\r\nmore than 900 feet. Its summit presents two distinct craters, one of\r\nthem with a vertical depth of 250 feet. A stream of lava takes its rise\r\nat the western base of the hill, instead of issuing from either crater,\r\nand descends the granitic slope towards the present site of the town of\r\nPont Gibaud. Thence it pours in a broad sheet down a steep declivity\r\ninto the valley of the Sioule, filling the ancient river-channel for the\r\ndistance of more than a mile. The Sioule, thus dispossessed of its bed,\r\nhas worked out a fresh one between the lava and the granite of its\r\nwestern bank; and the excavation has disclosed, in one spot, a wall of\r\ncolumnar basalt about 50 feet high.[427-A]\r\n\r\nThe excavation of the ravine is still in progress, every winter some\r\ncolumns of basalt being undermined and carried down the channel of the\r\nriver, and in the course of a few miles rolled to sand and pebbles.\r\nMeanwhile the cone of Come remains stationary, its loose materials being\r\nprotected by a dense vegetation, and the hill standing on a ridge not\r\ncommanded by any higher ground whence floods of rain-water may descend.\r\n\r\n_Puy Rouge._--At another point, farther down the course of the Sioule,\r\nwe find a second illustration of the same phenomenon in the Puy Rouge, a\r\nconical hill to the north of the village of Pranal. The cone is composed\r\nentirely of red and black scoriae, tuff, and volcanic bombs. On its\r\nwestern side there is a worn-down crater, whence a powerful stream of\r\nlava has issued, and flowed into the valley of the Sioule. The river has\r\nsince excavated a ravine through the lava and subjacent gneiss, to the\r\ndepth of 400 feet.\r\n\r\nOn the upper part of the precipice forming the left side of this ravine,\r\nwe see a great mass of black and red scoriaceous lava; below this a thin\r\nbed of gravel, evidently an ancient river-bed, now at an elevation of 50\r\nfeet above the channel of the Sioule. The gravel again rests upon\r\ngneiss, which has been eroded to the depth of 50 feet. It is quite\r\nevident in this case, that, while the basalt was gradually undermined\r\nand carried away by the force of running water, the cone whence the lava\r\nissued escaped destruction, because it stood upon a platform of gneiss\r\nseveral hundred feet above the level of the valley in which the force of\r\nrunning water was exerted.\r\n\r\n_Puy de Pariou._--The brim of the crater of the Puy de Pariou, near\r\nClermont, is so sharp, and has been so little blunted by time, that it\r\nscarcely affords room to stand upon. This and other cones in an equally\r\nremarkable state of integrity have stood, I conceive uninjured, not _in\r\nspite_ of their loose porous nature, as might at first be naturally\r\nsupposed, but in consequence of it. No rills can collect where all the rain\r\nis instantly absorbed by the sand and scoriae, as is remarkably the case on\r\nEtna; and nothing but a waterspout breaking directly upon the Puy de Pariou\r\ncould carry away a portion of the hill, so long as it is not rent or\r\nengulphed by earthquakes.\r\n\r\nHence it is conceivable that even those cones which have the freshest\r\naspect, and most perfect shape, may lay claim to very high antiquity. Dr.\r\nDaubeny has justly observed, that had any of these volcanos been in a state\r\nof activity in the age of Julius Caesar, that general, who encamped upon the\r\nplains of Auvergne, and laid siege to its principal city (Gergovia, near\r\nClermont), could hardly have failed to notice them. Had there been any\r\nrecord of their eruptions in the time of Pliny or Sidonius Apollinaris, the\r\none would scarcely have omitted to make mention of it in his Natural\r\nHistory, nor the other to introduce some allusion to it among the\r\ndescriptions of this his native province. This poet's residence was on the\r\nborders of the Lake Aidat, which owed its very existence to the damming up\r\nof a river by one of the most modern lava-currents.[428-A]\r\n\r\n_Velay._--The observations of M. Bertrand de Doue have not yet established\r\nthat any of the most ancient volcanos of Velay were in action during the\r\nEocene period. There are beds of gravel in Velay, as in Auvergne, covered\r\nby lava at different heights above the channels of the existing rivers. In\r\nthe highest and most ancient of these alluviums the pebbles are exclusively\r\nof granitic rocks; but in the newer, which are found at lower levels, and\r\nwhich originated when the valleys had been cut to a greater depth, an\r\nintermixture of volcanic rocks has been observed.\r\n\r\nAt St. Privat d'Allier a bed of volcanic scoriae and tuff was discovered\r\nby Dr. Hibbert, inclosed between two sheets of basaltic lava; and in\r\nthis tuff were found the bones of several quadrupeds, some of them\r\nadhering to masses of slaggy lava. Among other animals were _Rhinoceros\r\nleptorhinus_, _Hyaena spelaea_, and a species allied to the spotted hyaena\r\nof the Cape, together with four undetermined species of deer.[428-B] The\r\nmanner of the occurrence of these bones reminds us of the published\r\naccounts of an eruption of Coseguina, 1835, in Central America (see p.\r\n399.), during which hot cinders and scoriae fell and scorched to death\r\ngreat numbers of wild and domestic animals and birds.\r\n\r\n_Plomb du Cantal._--In regard to the age of the igneous rocks of the\r\nCantal, we can at present merely affirm, that they overlie the Eocene\r\nlacustrine strata of that country (see Map, p. 179.). They form a great\r\ndome-shaped mass, having an average slope of only 4 deg., which has evidently\r\nbeen accumulated, like the cone of Etna, during a long series of eruptions.\r\nIt is composed of trachytic, phonolitic, and basaltic lavas, tuffs, and\r\nconglomerates, or breccias, forming a mountain several thousand feet in\r\nheight. Dikes also of phonolite, trachyte, and basalt are numerous,\r\nespecially in the neighbourhood of the large cavity, probably once a\r\ncrater, around which the loftiest summits of the Cantal are ranged\r\ncircularly, few of them, except the Plomb du Cantal, rising far above the\r\nborder or ridge of this supposed crater. A pyramidal hill, called the Puy\r\nGriou, occupies the middle of the cavity.[429-A] It is clear that the\r\nvolcano of the Cantal broke out precisely on the site of the lacustrine\r\ndeposit before described (p. 188.), which had accumulated in a depression\r\nof a tract composed of micaceous schist. In the breccias, even to the very\r\nsummit of the mountain, we find ejected masses of the freshwater beds, and\r\nsometimes fragments of flint, containing Eocene shells. Valleys radiate in\r\nall directions from the central heights of the mountain, increasing in size\r\nas they recede from those heights. Those of the Cer and Jourdanne, which\r\nare more than 20 miles in length, are of great depth, and lay open the\r\ngeological structure of the mountain. No alternation of lavas with\r\nundisturbed Eocene strata has been observed, nor any tuffs containing\r\nfreshwater shells, although some of these tuffs include fossil remains of\r\nterrestrial plants, said to imply several distinct restorations of the\r\nvegetation of the mountain in the intervals between great eruptions. On the\r\nnorthern side of the Plomb du Cantal, at La Vissiere, near Murat, is a\r\nspot, pointed out on the Map (p. 179.), where freshwater limestone and marl\r\nare seen covered by a thickness of about 800 feet of volcanic rock. Shifts\r\nare here seen in the strata of limestone and marl.[429-B]\r\n\r\n_Eocene period._--In treating of the lacustrine deposits of Central\r\nFrance, in the fifteenth chapter, it was stated that, in the arenaceous\r\nand pebbly group of the lacustrine basins of Auvergne, Cantal, and\r\nVelay, no volcanic pebbles had ever been detected, although massive\r\npiles of igneous rocks are now found in the immediate vicinity. As this\r\nobservation has been confirmed by minute research, we are warranted in\r\ninferring that the volcanic eruptions had not commenced when the older\r\nsubdivisions of the freshwater groups originated.\r\n\r\nIn Cantal and Velay no decisive proofs have yet been brought to light that\r\nany of the igneous outbursts happened during the deposition of the\r\nfreshwater strata; but there can be no doubt that in Auvergne some volcanic\r\nexplosions took place before the drainage of the lakes, and at a time when\r\nthe Upper Eocene species of animals and plants still flourished. Thus, for\r\nexample, at Pont du Chateau, near Clermont, a section is seen in a\r\nprecipice on the right bank of the river Allier, in which beds of volcanic\r\ntuff alternate with a freshwater limestone, which is in some places pure,\r\nbut in others spotted with fragments of volcanic matter, as if it were\r\ndeposited while showers of sand and scoriae were projected from a\r\nneighbouring vent.[430-A]\r\n\r\nAnother example occurs in the Puy de Marmont, near Veyres, where a\r\nfreshwater marl alternates with volcanic tuff containing Eocene shells. The\r\ntuff or breccia in this locality is precisely such as is known to result\r\nfrom volcanic ashes falling into water, and subsiding together with ejected\r\nfragments of marl and other stratified rocks. These tuffs and marls are\r\nhighly inclined, and traversed by a thick vein of basalt, which, as it\r\nrises in the hill, divides into two branches.\r\n\r\n_Gergovia._--The hill of Gergovia, near Clermont, affords a third example.\r\nI agree with MM. Dufrenoy and Jobert that there is no alternation here of a\r\ncontemporaneous sheet of lava with freshwater strata, in the manner\r\nsupposed by some other observers[430-B]; but the position and contents of\r\nsome of the associated tuffs, prove them to have been derived from volcanic\r\neruptions which occurred during the deposition of the lacustrine strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 481. Hill of Gergovia.]\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the hill consists of slightly inclined beds of white and\r\ngreenish marls, more than 300 feet in thickness, intersected by a dike of\r\nbasalt, which may be studied in the ravine above the village of Merdogne.\r\nThe dike here cuts through the marly strata at a considerable angle,\r\nproducing, in general, great alteration and confusion in them for some\r\ndistance from the point of contact. Above the white and green marls, a\r\nseries of beds of limestone and marl, containing freshwater shells, are\r\nseen to alternate with volcanic tuff. In the lowest part of this division,\r\nbeds of pure marl alternate with compact fissile tuff, resembling some of\r\nthe subaqueous tuffs of Italy and Sicily called _peperinos_. Occasionally\r\nfragments of scoriae are visible in this rock. Still higher is seen another\r\ngroup of some thickness, consisting exclusively of tuff, upon which lie\r\nother marly strata intermixed with volcanic matter. Among the species of\r\nfossil shells which I found in these strata were _Melania inquinata_, a\r\n_Unio_, and a _Melanopsis_, but they were not sufficient to enable me to\r\ndetermine with precision the age of the formation.\r\n\r\nThere are many points in Auvergne where igneous rocks have been forced by\r\nsubsequent injection through clays and marly limestones, in such a manner\r\nthat the whole has become blended in one confused and brecciated mass,\r\nbetween which and the basalt there is sometimes no very distinct line of\r\ndemarcation. In the cavities of such mixed rocks we often find calcedony,\r\nand crystals of mesotype, stilbite, and arragonite. To formations of this\r\nclass may belong some of the breccias immediately adjoining the dike in the\r\nhill of Gergovia; but it cannot be contended that the volcanic sand and\r\nscoriae interstratified with the marls and limestones in the upper part of\r\nthat hill were introduced, like the dike, subsequently, by intrusion from\r\nbelow. They must have been thrown down like sediment from water, and can\r\nonly have resulted from igneous action, which was going on\r\ncontemporaneously with the deposition of the lacustrine strata.\r\n\r\nThe reader will bear in mind that this conclusion agrees well with the\r\nproofs, adverted to in the fifteenth chapter, of the abundance of silex,\r\ntravertin, and gypsum precipitated when the upper lacustrine strata were\r\nformed; for these rocks are such as the waters of mineral and thermal\r\nsprings might generate.\r\n\r\n_Cretaceous period._--Although we have no proof of volcanic rocks\r\nerupted in England during the deposition of the chalk and greensand, it\r\nwould be an error to suppose that no theatres of igneous action existed\r\nin the cretaceous period. M. Virlet, in his account of the geology of\r\nthe Morea, p. 205., has clearly shown that certain traps in Greece,\r\ncalled by him ophiolites, are of this date; as those, for example, which\r\nalternate conformably with cretaceous limestone and greensand between\r\nKastri and Damala in the Morea. They consist in great part of diallage\r\nrocks and serpentine, and of an amygdaloid with calcareous kernels,\r\nand a base of serpentine.\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the Morea, the age of these volcanic rocks is\r\nestablished by the following proofs: first, the lithographic limestones\r\nof the Cretaceous era are cut through by trap, and then a conglomerate\r\noccurs, at Nauplia and other places, containing in its calcareous cement\r\nmany well-known fossils of the chalk and greensand, together with\r\npebbles formed of rolled pieces of the same ophiolite, which appear in\r\nthe dikes above alluded to.\r\n\r\n_Period of Oolite and Lias._--Although the green and serpentinous trap\r\nrocks of the Morea belong chiefly to the Cretaceous era, as before\r\nmentioned, yet it seems that some eruptions of similar rocks began during\r\nthe Oolitic period[431-A]; and it is probable, that a large part of the\r\ntrappean masses, called ophiolites in the Apennines, and associated with\r\nthe limestone of that chain, are of corresponding age.\r\n\r\nThat part of the volcanic rocks of the Hebrides, in our own country,\r\noriginated contemporaneously with the Oolite which they traverse and\r\noverlie, has been ascertained by Prof. E. Forbes, in 1850.\r\n\r\n_Trap of the New Red Sandstone period._--In the southern part of\r\nDevonshire, trappean rocks are associated with New Red Sandstone, and,\r\naccording to Sir H. De la Beche, have not been intruded subsequently into\r\nthe sandstone, but were produced by contemporaneous volcanic action. Some\r\nbeds of grit, mingled with ordinary red marl, resemble sands ejected from a\r\ncrater; and in the stratified conglomerates occurring near Tiverton are\r\nmany angular fragments of trap porphyry, some of them one or two tons in\r\nweight, intermingled with pebbles of other rocks. These angular fragments\r\nwere probably thrown out from volcanic vents, and fell upon sedimentary\r\nmatter then in the course of deposition.[432-A]\r\n\r\n_Carboniferous period._--Two classes of contemporaneous trap rocks have\r\nbeen ascertained by Dr. Fleming to occur in the coal-field of the Forth in\r\nScotland. The newest of these, connected with the higher series of\r\ncoal-measures, is well exhibited along the shores of the Forth, in\r\nFifeshire, where they consist of basalt with olivine, amygdaloid,\r\ngreenstone, wacke, and tuff. They appear to have been erupted while the\r\nsedimentary strata were in a horizontal position, and to have suffered the\r\nsame dislocations which those strata have subsequently undergone. In the\r\nvolcanic tuffs of this age are found not only fragments of limestone,\r\nshale, flinty slate, and sandstone, but also pieces of coal.\r\n\r\nThe other or older class of carboniferous traps are traced along the\r\nsouth margin of Stratheden, and constitute a ridge parallel with the\r\nOchils, and extending from Stirling to near St. Andrews. They consist\r\nalmost exclusively of greenstone, becoming, in a few instances, earthy\r\nand amygdaloidal. They are regularly interstratified with the sandstone,\r\nshale, and ironstone of the lower Coal-measures, and, on the East\r\nLomond, with Mountain Limestone.\r\n\r\nI examined these trap rocks in 1838, in the cliffs south of St. Andrews,\r\nwhere they consist in great part of stratified tuffs, which are curved,\r\nvertical, and contorted, like the associated coal-measures. In the tuff I\r\nfound fragments of carboniferous shale and limestone, and intersecting\r\nveins of greenstone. At one spot, about two miles from St. Andrews, the\r\nencroachment of the sea on the cliffs has isolated several masses of trap,\r\none of which (fig. 482.) is aptly called the \"rock and spindle,\"[432-B] for\r\nit consists of a pinnacle of tuff, which may be compared to a distaff, and\r\nnear the base is a mass of columnar greenstone, in which the pillars\r\nradiate from a centre, and appear at a distance like the spokes of a wheel.\r\nThe largest diameter of this wheel is about twelve feet, and the polygonal\r\nterminations of the columns are seen round the circumference (or tire, as\r\nit were, of the wheel), as in the accompanying figure. I conceive this mass\r\nto be the extremity of a string or vein of greenstone, which penetrated the\r\ntuff. The prisms point in every direction, because they were surrounded on\r\nall sides by cooling surfaces, to which they always, arrange themselves at\r\nright angles, as before explained (p. 385.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 482. Rock and Spindle, St. Andrews.\r\n\r\n  _a._ Unstratified tuff.\r\n  _b._ Columnar greenstone.\r\n  _c._ Stratified tuff.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 483. Columns of Greenstone, seen endwise.]\r\n\r\nA trap dike was pointed out to me by Dr. Fleming, in the parish of Flisk,\r\nin the northern part of Fifeshire, which cuts through the grey sandstone\r\nand shale, forming the lowest part of the Old Red Sandstone. It may be\r\ntraced for many miles, passing through the amygdaloidal and other traps of\r\nthe hill called Normans Law. In its course it affords a good\r\nexemplification of the passage from the trappean into the plutonic, or\r\nhighly crystalline texture. Professor Gustavus Rose, to whom I submitted\r\nspecimens of this dike, finds the rock, which he calls dolerite, to consist\r\nof greenish black augite and Labrador felspar, the latter being the most\r\nabundant ingredient. A small quantity of magnetic iron, perhaps\r\ntitaniferous, is also present. The result of this analysis is interesting,\r\nbecause both the ancient and modern lavas of Etna consist in like manner of\r\naugite, Labradorite, and titaniferous iron.\r\n\r\n_Trap of the Old Red sandstone period._--By referring to the section\r\nexplanatory of the structure of Forfarshire, already given (p. 48.), the\r\nreader will perceive that beds of conglomerate, No. 3., occur in the\r\nmiddle of the Old Red sandstone system, 1, 2, 3, 4. The pebbles in these\r\nconglomerates are sometimes composed of granitic and quartz rocks,\r\nsometimes exclusively of different varieties of trap, which, although\r\npurposely omitted in the above section, are often found either intruding\r\nthemselves in amorphous masses and dikes into the old fossiliferous\r\ntilestones, No. 4., or alternating with them in conformable beds. All\r\nthe different divisions of the red sandstone, 1, 2, 3, 4, are\r\noccasionally intersected by dikes, but they are very rare in Nos. 1. and\r\n2., the upper members of the group consisting of red shale and red\r\nsandstone. These phenomena, which occur at the foot of the Grampians,\r\nare repeated in the Sidlaw Hills; and it appears that in this part of\r\nScotland, volcanic eruptions were most frequent in the earlier part of\r\nthe Old Red sandstone period.\r\n\r\nThe trap rocks alluded to consist chiefly of felspathic porphyry and\r\namygdaloid, the kernels of the latter being sometimes calcareous, often\r\ncalcedonic, and forming beautiful agates. We meet also with claystone,\r\nclinkstone, greenstone, compact felspar, and tuff. Some of these rocks\r\nflowed as lavas over the bottom of the sea, and enveloped quartz pebbles\r\nwhich were lying there, so as to form conglomerates with a base of\r\ngreenstone, as is seen in Lumley Den, in the Sidlaw Hills. On either\r\nside of the axis of this chain of hills (see section, p. 48.), the beds\r\nof massive trap, and the tuffs composed of volcanic sand and ashes,\r\ndip regularly to the south-east or north-west, conformably with the\r\nshales and sandstones.\r\n\r\n_Silurian period._--It appears from the investigations of Sir R.\r\nMurchison in Shropshire, that when the lower Silurian strata of that\r\ncounty were accumulating, there were frequent volcanic eruptions beneath\r\nthe sea; and the ashes and scoriae then ejected gave rise to a peculiar\r\nkind of tufaceous sandstone or grit, dissimilar to the other rocks of\r\nthe Silurian series, and only observable in places where syenitic and\r\nother trap rocks protrude. These tuffs occur on the flanks of the Wrekin\r\nand Caer Caradoc, and contain Silurian fossils, such as casts of\r\nencrinites, trilobites, and mollusca. Although fossiliferous, the stone\r\nresembles a sandy claystone of the trap family.[435-A]\r\n\r\nThin layers of trap, only a few inches thick, alternate, in some parts of\r\nShropshire and Montgomeryshire, with sedimentary strata of the lower\r\nSilurian system. This trap consists of slaty porphyry and granular felspar\r\nrock, the beds being traversed by joints like those in the associated\r\nsandstone, limestone, and shale, and having the same strike and dip.[435-B]\r\n\r\nIn Radnorshire there is an example of twelve bands of stratified trap,\r\nalternating with Silurian schists and flagstones, in a thickness of 350\r\nfeet. The bedded traps consist of felspar-porphyry, clinkstone, and other\r\nvarieties; and the interposed Llandeilo flags are of sandstone and shale,\r\nwith trilobites and graptolites.[435-C]\r\n\r\nThe vast thickness of contemporaneous trappean rocks of lower Silurian\r\ndate in North Wales, explored by our government surveyors, has been\r\nalready alluded to.[435-D]\r\n\r\n_Cambrian volcanic rocks._--Professor Sedgwick, in his account of the\r\ngeology of Cumberland, has described various trap rocks which accompany the\r\ngreen slates of the Cambrian system, beneath all the rocks containing\r\norganic remains. Different felspathic and porphyritic rocks and greenstones\r\noccur, not only in dikes, but in conformable beds; and there is\r\noccasionally a passage from these igneous rocks to some of the green\r\nquartzose slates. Professor Sedgwick supposes these porphyries to have\r\noriginated contemporaneously with the stratified chloritic slates, the\r\nmaterials of the slates having been supplied, in part at least, by\r\nsubmarine eruptions oftentimes repeated.[435-E]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[422-A] See the map, p. 179.\r\n\r\n[423-A] Scrope's Central France, p. 98.\r\n\r\n[423-B] See chaps. xxiv., xxv., and xxvi., 7th and 8th editions.\r\n\r\n[423-C] See Quarterly Geol.

I have described, in the\r\nfirst chapter, these plutonic rocks as the unstratified division of the\r\ncrystalline or hypogene formations, and have stated that they differ from\r\nthe volcanic rocks, not only by their more crystalline texture, but also by\r\nthe absence of tuffs and breccias, which are the products of eruptions at\r\nthe earth's surface, or beneath seas of inconsiderable depth. They differ\r\nalso by the absence of pores or cellular cavities, to which the expansion\r\nof the entangled gases gives rise in ordinary lava. From these and other\r\npeculiarities it has been inferred, that the granites have been formed at\r\nconsiderable depths in the earth, and have cooled and crystallized slowly\r\nunder great pressure, where the contained gases could not expand. The\r\nvolcanic rocks, on the contrary, although they also have risen up from\r\nbelow, have cooled from a melted state more rapidly upon or near the\r\nsurface. From this hypothesis of the great depth at which the granites\r\noriginated, has been derived the name of \"Plutonic rocks.\" The beginner\r\nwill easily conceive that the influence of subterranean heat may extend\r\ndownwards from the crater of every active volcano to a great depth below,\r\nperhaps several miles or leagues, and the effects which are produced deep\r\nin the bowels of the earth may, or rather must be, distinct; so that\r\nvolcanic and plutonic rocks, each different in texture, and sometimes even\r\nin composition, may originate simultaneously, the one at the surface, the\r\nother far beneath it.\r\n\r\nBy some writers, all the rocks now under consideration have been\r\ncomprehended under the name of granite, which is, then, understood to\r\nembrace a large family of crystalline and compound rocks, usually found\r\nunderlying all other formations; whereas we have seen that trap very\r\ncommonly overlies strata of different ages. Granite often preserves a very\r\nuniform character throughout a wide range of territory, forming hills of a\r\npeculiar rounded form, usually clad with a scanty vegetation. The surface\r\nof the rock is for the most part in a crumbling state, and the hills are\r\noften surmounted by piles of stones like the remains of a stratified mass,\r\nas in the annexed figure, and sometimes like heaps of boulders, for which\r\nthey have been mistaken. The exterior of these stones, originally\r\nquadrangular, acquires a rounded form by the action of air and water, for\r\nthe edges and angles waste away more rapidly than the sides. A similar\r\nspherical structure has already been described as characteristic of basalt\r\nand other volcanic formations, and it must be referred to analogous causes,\r\nas yet but imperfectly understood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 484. Mass of granite near the Sharp Tor, Cornwall.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it is the general peculiarity of granite to assume no definite\r\nshapes, it is nevertheless occasionally subdivided by fissures, so as to\r\nassume a cuboidal, and even a columnar, structure. Examples of these\r\nappearances may be seen near the Land's End, in Cornwall. (See figure.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 485. Granite having a cuboidal and rude columnar\r\nstructure, Land's End, Cornwall.]\r\n\r\nThe plutonic formations also agree with the volcanic, in having veins or\r\nramifications proceeding from central masses into the adjoining rocks, and\r\ncausing alterations in these last, which will be presently described. They\r\nalso resemble trap in containing no organic remains; but they differ in\r\nbeing more uniform in texture, whole mountain masses of indefinite extent\r\nappearing to have originated under conditions precisely similar. They also\r\ndiffer in never being scoriaceous or amygdaloidal, and never forming a\r\nporphyry with an uncrystalline base, or alternating with tuffs. Nor do they\r\nform conglomerates, although there is sometimes an insensible passage from\r\na fine to a coarse-grained granite, and occasionally patches of a fine\r\ntexture are imbedded in a coarser variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 486. Gneiss. (See description, p. 464.)]\r\n\r\nFelspar, quartz, and mica are usually considered as the minerals essential\r\nto granite, the felspar being most abundant in quantity, and the proportion\r\nof quartz exceeding that of mica. These minerals are united in what is\r\ntermed a confused crystallization; that is to say, there is no regular\r\narrangement of the crystals in granite, as in gneiss (see fig. 486.),\r\nexcept in the variety termed graphic granite, which occurs mostly in\r\ngranitic veins. This variety is a compound of felspar and quartz, so\r\narranged as to produce an imperfect laminar structure. The crystals of\r\nfelspar appear to have been first formed, leaving between them the space\r\nnow occupied by the darker-coloured quartz. This mineral, when a section is\r\nmade at right angles to the alternate plates of felspar and quartz,\r\npresents broken lines, which have been compared to Hebrew characters.\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Graphic granite.\r\n\r\nFig. 487. Section parallel to the laminae.\r\n\r\nFig. 488. Section transverse to the laminae.]\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, quartz, in a compact or amorphous state, forms a\r\nvitreous mass, serving as the base in which felspar and mica have\r\ncrystallized; for although these minerals are much more fusible than silex,\r\nthey have often imprinted their shapes upon the quartz. This fact,\r\napparently so paradoxical, has given rise to much ingenious speculation. We\r\nshould naturally have anticipated that, during the cooling of the mass, the\r\nflinty portion would be the first to consolidate; and that the different\r\nvarieties of felspar, as well as garnets and tourmalines, being more easily\r\nliquefied by heat, would be the last. Precisely the reverse has taken place\r\nin the passage of most granitic aggregates from a fluid to a solid state,\r\ncrystals of the more fusible minerals being found enveloped in hard,\r\ntransparent, glassy quartz, which has often taken very faithful casts of\r\neach, so as to preserve even the microscopically minute striations on the\r\nsurface of prisms of tourmaline. Various explanations of this phenomenon\r\nhave been proposed by MM. de Beaumont, Fournet, and Durocher. They refer to\r\nM. Gaudin's experiments on the fusion of quartz, which show that silex, as\r\nit cools, has the property of remaining in a viscous state, whereas alumina\r\nnever does. This \"gelatinous flint\" is supposed to retain a considerable\r\ndegree of plasticity long after the granitic mixture has acquired a low\r\ntemperature; and M. E. de Beaumont suggests, that electric action may\r\nprolong the duration of the viscosity of silex. Occasionally, however, we\r\nfind the quartz and felspar mutually imprinting their forms on each other,\r\naffording evidence of the simultaneous crystallization of both.[439-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 489. Porphyritic granite. Land's End, Cornwall.]\r\n\r\n_Porphyritic granite._--This name has been sometimes given to that variety\r\nin which large crystals of felspar, sometimes more than 3 inches in length,\r\nare scattered through an ordinary base of granite. An example of this\r\ntexture may be seen in the granite of the Land's End, in Cornwall (fig.\r\n489.). The two larger prismatic crystals in this drawing represent felspar,\r\nsmaller crystals of which are also seen, similar in form, scattered through\r\nthe base. In this base also appear black specks of mica, the crystals of\r\nwhich have a more or less perfect hexagonal outline. The remainder of the\r\nmass is quartz, the translucency of which is strongly contrasted to the\r\nopaqueness of the white felspar and black mica. But neither the\r\ntransparency of the quartz, nor the silvery lustre of the mica, can be\r\nexpressed in the engraving.\r\n\r\nThe uniform mineral character of large masses of granite seems to indicate\r\nthat large quantities of the component elements were thoroughly mixed up\r\ntogether, and then crystallized under precisely similar conditions. There\r\nare, however, many accidental, or \"occasional,\" minerals, as they are\r\ntermed, which belong to granite. Among these black schorl or tourmaline,\r\nactinolite, zircon, garnet, and fluor spar, are not uncommon; but they are\r\ntoo sparingly dispersed to modify the general aspect of the rock. They\r\nshow, nevertheless, that the ingredients were not everywhere exactly the\r\nsame; and a still greater variation may be traced in the ever-varying\r\nproportions of the felspar, quartz, and mica.\r\n\r\n_Syenite._--When hornblende is the substitute for mica, which is very\r\ncommonly the case, the rock becomes Syenite: so called from the celebrated\r\nancient quarries of Syene in Egypt. It has all the appearance of ordinary\r\ngranite, except when mineralogically examined in hand specimens, and is\r\nfully entitled to rank as a geological member of the same plutonic family\r\nas granite. Syenite, however, after maintaining the granitic character\r\nthroughout extensive regions, is not uncommonly found to lose its quartz,\r\nand to pass insensibly into syenitic greenstone, a rock of the trap family.\r\nWerner considered syenite as a binary compound of felspar and hornblende,\r\nand regarded quartz as merely one of its occasional minerals.\r\n\r\n_Syenitic-granite._--The quadruple compound of quartz, felspar, mica, and\r\nhornblende, may be so termed. This rock occurs in Scotland and in Guernsey.\r\n\r\n_Talcose granite_, or Protogine of the French, is a mixture of felspar,\r\nquartz, and talc. It abounds in the Alps, and in some parts of Cornwall,\r\nproducing by its decomposition the china clay, more than 12,000 tons of\r\nwhich are annually exported from that country for the potteries.[440-A]\r\n\r\n_Schorl rock, and schorly granite._--The former of these is an aggregate\r\nof schorl, or tourmaline, and quartz. When felspar and mica are also\r\npresent, it may be called schorly granite. This kind of granite is\r\ncomparatively rare.\r\n\r\n_Eurite._--A rock in which all the ingredients of granite are blended into\r\na finely granular mass. Crystals of quartz and mica are sometimes scattered\r\nthrough the base of Eurite.\r\n\r\n_Pegmatite._--A name given by French writers to a variety of granite; a\r\ngranular mixture of quartz and felspar; frequent in granite veins; passes\r\ninto graphic granite.\r\n\r\nAll these granites pass into certain kinds of trap, a circumstance which\r\naffords one of many arguments in favour of what is now the prevailing\r\nopinion, that the granites are also of igneous origin. The contrast of the\r\nmost crystalline form of granite, to that of the most common and earthy\r\ntrap, is undoubtedly great; but each member of the volcanic class is\r\ncapable of becoming porphyritic, and the base of the porphyry may be more\r\nand more crystalline, until the mass passes to the kind of granite most\r\nnearly allied in mineral composition.\r\n\r\nThe minerals which constitute alike the granitic and volcanic rocks\r\nconsist, almost exclusively, of seven elements, namely, silica, alumina,\r\nmagnesia, lime, soda, potash, and iron; and these may sometimes exist in\r\nabout the same proportions in a porous lava, a compact trap, or a\r\ncrystalline granite. It may perhaps be found, on farther examination--for\r\non this subject we have yet much to learn--that the presence of these\r\nelements in certain proportions is more favourable than in others to their\r\nassuming a crystalline or true granitic structure; but it is also\r\nascertained by experiment, that the same materials may, under different\r\ncircumstances, form very different rocks. The same lava, for example, may\r\nbe glassy, or scoriaceous, or stony, or porphyritic, according to the more\r\nor less rapid rate at which it cools; and some trachytes and\r\nsyenitic-greenstones may doubtless form granite and syenite, if the\r\ncrystallization take place slowly.\r\n\r\nIt has also been suggested that the peculiar nature and structure of\r\ngranite may be due to its retaining in it that water which is seen to\r\nescape from lavas when they cool slowly, and consolidate in the atmosphere.\r\nBoutigny's experiments have shown that melted matter, at a white heat,\r\nrequires to have its temperature lowered before it can vapourize water; and\r\nsuch discoveries, if they fail to explain the manner in which granites have\r\nbeen formed, serve at least to remind us of the entire distinctness of the\r\nconditions under which plutonic and volcanic rocks must be produced.[441-A]\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to multiply examples and authorities to prove the\r\ngradation of the granitic into the trap rocks. On the western side of the\r\nfiord of Christiania, in Norway, there is a large district of trap, chiefly\r\ngreenstone-porphyry, and syenitic-greenstone, resting on fossiliferous\r\nstrata. To this, on its southern limit, succeeds a region equally extensive\r\nof syenite, the passage from the volcanic to the plutonic rock being so\r\ngradual that it is impossible to draw a line of demarcation between them.\r\n\r\n\"The ordinary granite of Aberdeenshire,\" says Dr. MacCulloch, \"is the usual\r\nternary compound of quartz, felspar, and mica; but sometimes hornblende is\r\nsubstituted for the mica. But in many places a variety occurs which is\r\ncomposed simply of felspar and hornblende; and in examining more minutely\r\nthis duplicate compound, it is observed in some places to assume a fine\r\ngrain, and at length to become undistinguishable from the greenstones of\r\nthe trap family. It also passes in the same uninterrupted manner into a\r\nbasalt, and at length into a soft claystone, with a schistose tendency on\r\nexposure, in no respect differing from those of the trap islands of the\r\nwestern coast.\"[441-B] The same author mentions, that in Shetland, a\r\ngranite composed of hornblende, mica, felspar, and quartz, graduates in an\r\nequally perfect manner into basalt.[441-C]\r\n\r\nIn Hungary there are varieties of trachyte, which, geologically speaking,\r\nare of modern origin, in which crystals, not only of mica, but of quartz,\r\nare common, together with felspar and hornblende. It is easy to conceive\r\nhow such volcanic masses may, at a certain depth from the surface, pass\r\ndownwards into granite.\r\n\r\n[2 Illustrations: Fig. 490. Fig. 491.\r\n\r\nJunction of granite and argillaceous schist in Glen Tilt.\r\n(MacCulloch.)[442-A]]\r\n\r\nI have already hinted at the close analogy in the forms of certain granitic\r\nand trappean veins; and it will be found that strata penetrated by plutonic\r\nrocks have suffered changes very similar to those exhibited near the\r\ncontact of volcanic dikes. Thus, in Glen Tilt, in Scotland, alternating\r\nstrata of limestone and argillaceous schist come in contact with a mass of\r\ngranite. The contact does not take place as might have been looked for, if\r\nthe granite had been formed there before the strata were deposited, in\r\nwhich case the section would have appeared as in fig. 490.; but the union\r\nis as represented in fig. 491., the undulating outline of the granite\r\nintersecting different strata, and occasionally intruding itself in\r\ntortuous veins into the beds of clay-slate and limestone, from which it\r\ndiffers so remarkably in composition. The limestone is sometimes changed in\r\ncharacter by the proximity of the granitic mass or its veins, and acquires\r\na more compact texture, like that of hornstone or chert, with a splintery\r\nfracture, effervescing feebly with acids.\r\n\r\nThe annexed diagram (fig. 492.) represents another junction, in the same\r\ndistrict, where the granite sends forth so many veins as to reticulate the\r\nlimestone and schist, the veins diminishing towards their termination to\r\nthe thickness of a leaf of paper or a thread. In some places fragments of\r\ngranite appear entangled, as it were, in the limestone, and are not visibly\r\nconnected with any larger mass; while sometimes, on the other hand, a lump\r\nof the limestone is found in the midst of the granite. The ordinary colour\r\nof the limestone of Glen Tilt is lead blue, and its texture large-grained\r\nand highly crystalline; but where it approximates to the granite,\r\nparticularly where it is penetrated by the smaller veins, the crystalline\r\ntexture disappears, and it assumes an appearance exactly resembling that of\r\nhornstone. The associated argillaceous schist often passes into hornblende\r\nslate, where it approaches very near to the granite.[442-B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 492. Junction of granite and limestone in Glen\r\nTilt. (MacCulloch.)\r\n\r\n  _a._ Granite. _b._ Limestone.\r\n  _c._ Blue argillaceous schist.]\r\n\r\nThe conversion of the limestone in these and many other instances into a\r\nsiliceous rock, effervescing slowly with acids, would be difficult of\r\nexplanation, were it not ascertained that such limestones are always\r\nimpure, containing grains of quartz, mica, or felspar disseminated\r\nthrough them. The elements of these minerals, when the rock has been\r\nsubjected to great heat, may have been fused, and so spread more\r\nuniformly through the whole mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 493. Granite veins traversing clay slate. Table\r\nMountain, Cape of Good Hope.[443-A]]\r\n\r\nIn the plutonic, as in the volcanic rocks, there is every gradation from\r\na tortuous vein to the most regular form of a dike, such as intersect\r\nthe tuffs and lavas of Vesuvius and Etna. Dikes of granite may be seen,\r\namong other places, on the southern flank of Mount Battock, one of the\r\nGrampians, the opposite walls sometimes preserving an exact parallelism\r\nfor a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, however, granite veins in all quarters of the globe are\r\nmore sinuous in their course than those of trap. They present similar\r\nshapes at the most northern point of Scotland, and the southernmost\r\nextremity of Africa, as the annexed drawings will show.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for one set of granite veins to intersect another; and\r\nsometimes there are three sets, as in the environs of Heidelberg, where the\r\ngranite on the banks of the river Necker is seen to consist of three\r\nvarieties, differing in colour, grain, and various peculiarities of mineral\r\ncomposition. One of these, which is evidently the second in age, is seen to\r\ncut through an older granite; and another, still newer, traverses both the\r\nsecond and the first.\r\n\r\nIn Shetland there are two kinds of granite. One of them, composed of\r\nhornblende, mica, felspar, and quartz, is of a dark colour, and is seen\r\nunderlying gneiss. The other is a red granite, which penetrates the dark\r\nvariety everywhere in veins.[444-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 494. Granite veins traversing gneiss, Cape Wrath.\r\n(MacCulloch.)[444-B]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 495. Granite veins traversing gneiss at Cape Wrath, in\r\nScotland. (MacCulloch.)]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketches will explain the manner in which granite veins\r\noften ramify and cut each other (figs. 494. and 495.). They represent\r\nthe manner in which the gneiss at Cape Wrath, in Sutherlandshire, is\r\nintersected by veins. Their light colour, strongly contrasted with that\r\nof the hornblende-schist, here associated with the gneiss, renders them\r\nvery conspicuous.\r\n\r\nGranite very generally assumes a finer grain, and undergoes a change in\r\nmineral composition, in the veins which it sends into contiguous rocks.\r\nThus, according to Professor Sedgwick, the main body of the Cornish granite\r\nis an aggregate of mica, quartz, and felspar; but the veins are sometimes\r\nwithout mica, being a granular aggregate of quartz and felspar. In other\r\nvarieties quartz prevails to the almost entire exclusion both of felspar\r\nand mica; in others, the mica and quartz both disappear, and the vein is\r\nsimply composed of white granular felspar.[444-C]\r\n\r\nFig. 496. is a sketch of a group of granite veins in Cornwall, given by\r\nMessrs. Von Oeynhausen and Von Dechen.[445-A] The main body of the granite\r\nhere is of a porphyritic appearance, with large crystals of felspar; but in\r\nthe veins it is fine-grained, and without these large crystals. The general\r\nheight of the veins is from 16 to 20 feet, but some are much higher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 496. Granite veins passing through hornblende slate,\r\nCarnsilver Cove, Cornwall.]\r\n\r\nIn the Valorsine, a valley not far from Mont Blanc in Switzerland, an\r\nordinary granite, consisting of felspar, quartz, and mica, sends forth\r\nveins into a talcose gneiss (or stratified protogine), and in some places\r\nlateral ramifications are thrown off from the principal veins at right\r\nangles (see fig. 497.), the veins, especially the minute ones, being finer\r\ngrained than the granite in mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 497. Veins of granite in talcose gneiss.\r\n(L. A. Necker.)]\r\n\r\nIt is here remarked, that the schist and granite, as they approach, seem to\r\nexercise a reciprocal influence on each other, for both undergo a\r\nmodification of mineral character. The granite, still remaining\r\nunstratified, becomes charged with green particles; and the talcose gneiss\r\nassumes a granitiform structure without losing its stratification.[445-B]\r\n\r\nProfessor Keilhau drew my attention to several localities in the country\r\nnear Christiania, where the mineral character of gneiss appears to have\r\nbeen affected by a granite of much newer origin, for some distance from the\r\npoint of contact. The gneiss, without losing its laminated structure, seems\r\nto have become charged with a larger quantity of felspar, and that of a\r\nredder colour, than the felspar usually belonging to the gneiss of Norway.\r\n\r\nGranite, syenite, and those porphyries which have a granitiform\r\nstructure, in short all plutonic rocks, are frequently observed to\r\ncontain metals, at or near their junction with stratified formations. On\r\nthe other hand, the veins which traverse stratified rocks are, as a\r\ngeneral law, more metalliferous near such junctions than in other\r\npositions. Hence it has been inferred that these metals may have been\r\nspread in a gaseous form through the fused mass, and that the contact of\r\nanother rock, in a different state of temperature, or sometimes the\r\nexistence of rents in other rocks in the vicinity, may have caused the\r\nsublimation of the metals.[446-A]\r\n\r\nThere are many instances, as at Markerud, near Christiania, in Norway,\r\nwhere the strike of the beds has not been deranged throughout a large area\r\nby the intrusion of granite, both in large masses and in veins. This fact\r\nis considered by some geologists to militate against the theory of the\r\nforcible injection of granite in a fluid state. But it may be stated in\r\nreply, that ramifying dikes of trap, which almost all now admit to have\r\nbeen once fluid, pass through the same fossiliferous strata, near\r\nChristiania, without deranging their strike or dip.[446-B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 498. General view of junction of granite and schist of\r\nthe Valorsine. (L. A. Necker.)]\r\n\r\nThe real or apparent isolation of large or small masses of granite detached\r\nfrom the main body, as at _a b_, fig. 498., and above, fig. 492., and _a_,\r\nfig. 497., has been thought by some writers to be irreconcilable with the\r\ndoctrine usually taught respecting veins; but many of them may, in fact, be\r\nsections of root-shaped prolongations of granite; while, in other cases,\r\nthey may in reality be detached portions of rock having the plutonic\r\nstructure. For there may have been spots in the midst of the invaded\r\nstrata, in which there was an assemblage of materials more fusible than the\r\nrest, or more fitted to combine readily into some form of granite.\r\n\r\nVeins of pure quartz are often found in granite, as in many stratified\r\nrocks, but they are not traceable, like veins of granite or trap, to\r\nlarge bodies of rock of similar composition. They appear to have been\r\ncracks, into which siliceous matter was infiltered. Such segregation, as\r\nit is called, can sometimes be shown to have clearly taken place long\r\nsubsequently to the original consolidation of the containing rock. Thus,\r\nfor example, in the gneiss of Tronstad Strand, near Drammen, in Norway,\r\nthe annexed section is seen on the beach. It appears that the\r\nalternating strata of whitish granitiform gneiss, and black\r\nhornblende-schist, were first cut through by a greenstone dike, about\r\n2-1/2 feet wide; then the crack _a b_ passed through all these rocks,\r\nand was filled up with quartz. The opposite walls of the vein are in\r\nsome parts incrusted with transparent crystals of quartz, the middle of\r\nthe vein being filled up with common opaque white quartz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 499. _a, b._ Quartz vein passing through gneiss and\r\ngreenstone, Tronstad Strand, near Christiania.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 500. Euritic porphyry alternating with primary\r\nfossiliferous strata, near Christiania.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the volcanic formations have been called overlying,\r\nbecause they not only penetrate others, but spread over them. Mr. Necker\r\nhas proposed to call the granites the underlying igneous rocks, and the\r\ndistinction here indicated is highly characteristic. It was indeed\r\nsupposed by some of the earlier observers, that the granite of\r\nChristiania, in Norway, was intercalated in mountain masses between the\r\nprimary or paleozoic strata of that country, so as to overlie\r\nfossiliferous shale and limestone. But although the granite sends veins\r\ninto these fossiliferous rocks, and is decidedly posterior in origin,\r\nits actual superposition in mass has been disproved by Professor\r\nKeilhau, whose observations on this controverted point I had\r\nopportunities in 1837 of verifying. There are, however, on a smaller\r\nscale, certain beds of euritic porphyry, some a few feet, others many\r\nyards in thickness, which pass into granite, and deserve perhaps to be\r\nclassed as plutonic rather than trappean rocks, which may truly be\r\ndescribed as interposed conformably between fossiliferous strata, as the\r\nporphyries (_a c_, fig. 500.), which divide the bituminous shales and\r\nargillaceous limestones, _f f_. But some of these same porphyries are\r\npartially unconformable, as _b_, and may lead us to suspect that the\r\nothers also, notwithstanding their appearance of interstratification,\r\nhave been forcibly injected. Some of the porphyritic rocks above\r\nmentioned are highly quartzose, others very felspathic. In proportion as\r\nthe masses are more voluminous, they become more granitic in their\r\ntexture, less conformable, and even begin to send forth veins into\r\ncontiguous strata. In a word, we have here a beautiful illustration of\r\nthe intermediate gradations between volcanic and plutonic rocks, not\r\nonly in their mineralogical composition and structure, but also in their\r\nrelations of position to associated formations. If the term overlying\r\ncan in this instance be applied to a plutonic rock, it is only in\r\nproportion as that rock begins to acquire a trappean aspect.\r\n\r\nIt has been already hinted that the heat, which in every active volcano\r\nextends downwards to indefinite depths, must produce simultaneously very\r\ndifferent effects near the surface, and far below it; and we cannot suppose\r\nthat rocks resulting from the crystallizing of fused matter under a\r\npressure of several thousand feet, much less miles, of the earth's crust\r\ncan resemble those formed at or near the surface. Hence the production at\r\ngreat depths of a class of rocks analogous to the volcanic, and yet\r\ndiffering in many particulars, might almost have been predicted, even had\r\nwe no plutonic formations to account for. How well these agree, both in\r\ntheir positive and negative characters, with the theory of their deep\r\nsubterranean origin, the student will be able to judge by considering the\r\ndescriptions already given.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been objected, that if the granitic and volcanic rocks\r\nwere simply different parts of one great series, we ought to find in\r\nmountain chains volcanic dikes passing upwards into lava, and downwards\r\ninto granite. But we may answer, that our vertical sections are usually of\r\nsmall extent; and if we find in certain places a transition from trap to\r\nporous lava, and in others a passage from granite to trap, it is as much as\r\ncould be expected of this evidence.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious extent of denudation which has been already demonstrated to\r\nhave occurred at former periods, will reconcile the student to the belief\r\nthat crystalline rocks of high antiquity, although deep in the earth's\r\ncrust when originally formed, may have become uncovered and exposed at the\r\nsurface. Their actual elevation above the sea may be referred to the same\r\ncauses to which we have attributed the upheaval of marine strata, even to\r\nthe summits of some mountain chains. But to these and other topics, I shall\r\nrevert when speaking, in the next chapter, of the relative ages of\r\ndifferent masses of granite.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[439-A] Bulletin, 2d serie, iv. 1304.; and Archiac, Hist. des Progres\r\nde Geol., i. 38.\r\n\r\n[440-A] Boase on Primary Geology, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[441-A] Bulletin, vol. iv., 2d ser., pp. 1318. and 1320.\r\n\r\n[441-B] Syst. of Geol., vol. i. p. 157.\r\n\r\n[441-C] Ibid., p. 158.\r\n\r\n[442-A] Geol.

We must\r\nbear in mind, that the evidence of the age of each contemporaneous volcanic\r\nrock was derived, either from lavas poured out upon the ancient surface,\r\nwhether in the sea or in the atmosphere, or from tuffs and conglomerates,\r\nalso deposited at the surface, and either containing organic remains\r\nthemselves, or intercalated between strata containing fossils. But all\r\nthese tests fail when we endeavour to fix the chronology of a rock which\r\nhas crystallized from a state of fusion in the bowels of the earth. In that\r\ncase, we are reduced to the following tests; 1st, relative position; 2dly,\r\nintrusion, and alteration of the rocks in contact; 3dly, mineral\r\ncharacters; 4thly, included fragments.\r\n\r\n_Test of age by relative position._--Unaltered fossiliferous strata of\r\nevery age are met with reposing immediately on plutonic rocks; as at\r\nChristiania, in Norway, where the Newer Pliocene deposits rest on granite;\r\nin Auvergne, where the freshwater Eocene strata, and at Heidelberg, on the\r\nRhine, where the New Red sandstone, occupy a similar place. In all these,\r\nand similar instances, inferiority in position is connected with the\r\nsuperior antiquity of granite. The crystalline rock was solid before the\r\nsedimentary beds were superimposed, and the latter usually contain in them\r\nrounded pebbles of the subjacent granite.\r\n\r\n_Test by intrusion and alteration._--But when plutonic rocks send veins\r\ninto strata, and alter them near the point of contact, in the manner before\r\ndescribed (p. 442.), it is clear that, like intrusive traps, they are newer\r\nthan the strata which they invade and alter. Examples of the application of\r\nthis test will be given in the sequel.\r\n\r\n_Test by mineral composition._--Notwithstanding a general uniformity in the\r\naspect of plutonic rocks, we have seen in the last chapter that there are\r\nmany varieties, such as Syenite, Talcose granite, and others. One of these\r\nvarieties is sometimes found exclusively prevailing throughout an extensive\r\nregion, where it preserves a homogeneous character; so that having\r\nascertained its relative age in one place, we can easily recognize its\r\nidentity in others, and thus determine from a single section the\r\nchronological relations of large mountain masses. Having observed, for\r\nexample, that the syenitic granite of Norway, in which the mineral called\r\nzircon abounds, has altered the Silurian strata wherever it is in contact,\r\nwe do not hesitate to refer other masses of the same zircon-syenite in the\r\nsouth of Norway to the same era.\r\n\r\nSome have imagined that the age of different granites might, to a great\r\nextent, be determined by their mineral characters alone; syenite, for\r\ninstance, or granite with hornblende, being more modern than common or\r\nmicaceous granite. But modern investigations have proved these\r\ngeneralizations to have been premature. The syenitic granite of Norway\r\nalready alluded to may be of the same age as the Silurian strata, which it\r\ntraverses and alters, or may belong to the Old Red sandstone period;\r\nwhereas the granite of Dartmoor, although consisting of mica, quartz, and\r\nfelspar, is newer than the coal. (See p. 456.)\r\n\r\n_Test by included fragments._--This criterion can rarely be of much\r\nimportance, because the fragments involved in granite are usually so\r\nmuch altered, that they cannot be referred with certainty to the rocks\r\nwhence they were derived. In the White Mountains, in North America,\r\naccording to Professor Hubbard, a granite vein traversing granite,\r\ncontains fragments of slate and trap, which must have fallen into the\r\nfissure when the fused materials of the vein were injected from\r\nbelow[450-A], and thus the granite is shown to be newer than certain\r\nsuperficial slaty and trappean formations.\r\n\r\n_Recent and Pliocene plutonic rocks, why invisible._--The explanation\r\nalready given in the 29th and in the last chapter, of the probable relation\r\nof the plutonic to the volcanic formations, will naturally lead the reader\r\nto infer, that rocks of the one class can never be produced at or near the\r\nsurface without some members of the other being formed below\r\nsimultaneously, or soon afterwards. It is not uncommon for lava-streams to\r\nrequire more than ten years to cool in the open air; and where they are of\r\ngreat depth, a much longer period. The melted matter poured from Jorullo,\r\nin Mexico, in the year 1759, which accumulated in some places to the height\r\nof 550 feet, was found to retain a high temperature half a century after\r\nthe eruption.[450-B] We may conceive, therefore, that great masses of\r\nsubterranean lava may remain in a red-hot or incandescent state in the\r\nvolcanic foci for immense periods, and the process of refrigeration may be\r\nextremely gradual. Sometimes, indeed, this process may be retarded for an\r\nindefinite period, by the accession of fresh supplies of heat; for we find\r\nthat the lava in the crater of Stromboli, one of the Lipari Islands, has\r\nbeen in a state of constant ebullition for the last two thousand years; and\r\nwe may suppose this fluid mass to communicate with some caldron or\r\nreservoir of fused matter below. In the Isle of Bourbon, also, where there\r\nhas been an emission of lava once in every two years for a long period, the\r\nlava below can scarcely fail to have been permanently in a state of\r\nliquefaction. If then it be a reasonable conjecture, that about 2000\r\nvolcanic eruptions occur in the course of every century, either above the\r\nwaters of the sea or beneath them[451-A], it will follow, that the quantity\r\nof plutonic rock generated, or in progress during the Recent epoch, must\r\nalready have been considerable.\r\n\r\nBut as the plutonic rocks originate at some depth in the earth's crust,\r\nthey can only be rendered accessible to human observation, by subsequent\r\nupheaval and denudation. Between the period when a plutonic rock\r\ncrystallizes in the subterranean regions, and the era of its protrusion at\r\nany single point of the surface, one or two geological periods must usually\r\nintervene. Hence, we must not expect to find the Recent or Newer Pliocene\r\ngranites laid open to view, unless we are prepared to assume that\r\nsufficient time has elapsed since the commencement of the Newer Pliocene\r\nperiod for great upheaval and denudation. A plutonic rock, therefore, must,\r\nin general, be of considerable antiquity relatively to the fossiliferous\r\nand volcanic formations, before it becomes extensively visible. As we know\r\nthat the upheaval of land has been sometimes accompanied in South America\r\nby volcanic eruptions and the emission of lava, we may conceive the more\r\nancient plutonic rocks to be forced upwards to the surface by the newer\r\nrocks of the same class formed successively below,--subterposition in the\r\nplutonic, like superposition in the sedimentary rocks, being usually\r\ncharacteristic of a newer origin.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying diagram (fig. 501.), an attempt is made to show the\r\ninverted order in which sedimentary and plutonic formations may occur\r\nin the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nThe oldest plutonic rock, No. I., has been upheaved at successive periods\r\nuntil it has become exposed to view in a mountain-chain. This protrusion of\r\nNo. I. has been caused by the igneous agency which produced the newer\r\nplutonic rocks Nos. II. III. and IV. Part of the primary fossiliferous\r\nstrata, No. 1., have also been raised to the surface by the same gradual\r\nprocess. It will be observed that the Recent _strata_ No. 4., and the\r\nRecent _granite_ or plutonic rock No. IV., are the most remote from each\r\nother in position, although of contemporaneous date. According to this\r\nhypothesis, the convulsions of many periods will be required before\r\n_Recent_ granite will be upraised so as to form the highest ridges and\r\ncentral axes of mountain-chains. During that time the _Recent_ strata No.\r\n4. might be covered by a great many newer sedimentary formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 501.

Primary fossiliferous strata.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphic rocks are not indicated in this diagram; but the student\r\nwill infer, from what has been said in Chap. XXXII., that some portions\r\nof the stratified formations Nos. 1. and 2. invaded by granite will\r\nhave become metamorphic.]\r\n\r\n_Eocene granite and plutonic rocks._--In a former part of this volume (p.\r\n205.), the great nummulitic formation of the Alps and Pyrenees was\r\nreferred to the Eocene period, and it follows that those vast movements\r\nwhich have raised fossiliferous rocks from the level of the sea to the\r\nheight of more than 10,000 feet above its level have taken place since the\r\ncommencement of the tertiary epoch. Here, therefore, if anywhere, we might\r\nexpect to find hypogene formations of Eocene date breaking out in the\r\ncentral axis or most disturbed region of the loftiest chain in Europe.\r\nAccordingly, in the Swiss Alps, even the _flysch_, or upper portion of the\r\nnummulitic series, has been occasionally invaded by plutonic rocks, and\r\nconverted into crystalline schists of the hypogene class. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that even the talcose granite of Mont Blanc itself has been in\r\na fused or pasty state since the _flysch_ was deposited at the bottom of\r\nthe sea; and the question as to its age is not so much whether it be a\r\nsecondary or tertiary granite, as whether it should be assigned to the\r\nEocene or Miocene epoch.\r\n\r\nGreat upheaving movements have been experienced in the region of the\r\nAndes, during the Post-Pliocene period. In some part, therefore, of this\r\nchain, we may expect to discover tertiary plutonic rocks laid open to\r\nview. What we already know of the structure of the Chilian Andes seems\r\nto realize this expectation. In a transverse section, examined by Mr.\r\nDarwin, between Valparaiso and Mendoza, the Cordillera was found to\r\nconsist of two separate and parallel chains, formed of sedimentary rocks\r\nof different ages, the strata in both resting on plutonic rocks, by\r\nwhich they have been altered. In the western or oldest range, called the\r\nPeuquenes, are black calcareous clay-slates, rising to the height of\r\nnearly 14,000 feet above the sea, in which are shells of the genera\r\n_Gryphaea_, _Turritella_, _Terebratula_, and _Ammonite_. These rocks are\r\nsupposed to be of the age of the central parts of the secondary series\r\nof Europe. They are penetrated and altered by dikes and mountain masses\r\nof a plutonic rock, which has the texture of ordinary granite, but\r\nrarely contains quartz, being a compound of albite and hornblende.\r\n\r\nThe second or eastern chain consists chiefly of sandstones and\r\nconglomerates, of vast thickness, the materials of which are derived\r\nfrom the ruins of the western chain. The pebbles of the conglomerates\r\nare, for the most part, rounded fragments of the fossiliferous slates\r\nbefore mentioned. The resemblance of the whole series to certain\r\ntertiary deposits on the shores of the Pacific, not only in mineral\r\ncharacter, but in the imbedded lignite and silicified woods, leads to\r\nthe conjecture that they also are tertiary. Yet these strata are not\r\nonly associated with trap rocks and volcanic tuffs, but are also altered\r\nby a granite consisting of quartz, felspar, and talc. They are\r\ntraversed, moreover, by dikes of the same granite, and by numerous veins\r\nof iron, copper, arsenic, silver, and gold; all of which can be traced\r\nto the underlying granite.[453-A] We have, therefore, strong ground to\r\npresume that the plutonic rock, here exposed on a large scale in the\r\nChilian Andes, is of later date than certain tertiary formations.\r\n\r\nBut the theory adopted in this work of the subterranean origin of the\r\nhypogene formations would be untenable, if the supposed fact here alluded\r\nto, of the appearance of tertiary granite at the surface was not a rare\r\nexception to the general rule. A considerable lapse of time must intervene\r\nbetween the formation in the nether regions of plutonic and metamorphic\r\nrocks, and their emergence at the surface. For a long series of\r\nsubterranean movements must occur before such rocks can be uplifted into\r\nthe atmosphere or the ocean; and, before they can be rendered visible to\r\nman, some strata which previously covered them must usually have been\r\nstripped off by denudation.\r\n\r\nWe know that in the Bay of Baiae, in 1538, in Cutch in 1819, and on several\r\noccasions in Peru and Chili, since the commencement of the present century,\r\nthe permanent upheaval or subsidence of land has been accompanied by the\r\nsimultaneous emission of lava at one or more points in the same volcanic\r\nregion. From these and other examples it may be inferred that the rising or\r\nsinking of the earth's crust, operations by which sea is converted into\r\nland, and land into sea, are a part only of the consequences of\r\nsubterranean igneous action. It can scarcely be doubted that this action\r\nconsists, in a great degree, of the baking, and occasionally the\r\nliquefaction, of rocks, causing them to assume, in some cases a larger, in\r\nothers a smaller volume than before the application of heat. It consists\r\nalso in the generation of gases, and their expansion by heat, and the\r\ninjection of liquid matter into rents formed in superincumbent rocks. The\r\nprodigious scale on which these subterranean causes have operated in Sicily\r\nsince the deposition of the Newer Pliocene strata will be appreciated, when\r\nwe remember that throughout half the surface of that island such strata are\r\nmet with, raised to the height of from 50 to that of 2000 and even 3000\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. In the same island also the older rocks\r\nwhich are contiguous to these marine tertiary strata must have undergone,\r\nwithin the same period, a similar amount of upheaval.\r\n\r\nThe like observations may be extended to nearly the whole of Europe, for,\r\nsince the commencement of the Eocene period, the entire European area,\r\nincluding some of the central and very lofty portions of the Alps\r\nthemselves, as I have elsewhere shown[454-A], has, with the exception of a\r\nfew districts, emerged from the deep to its present altitude; and even\r\nthose tracts, which were already dry land before the Eocene era, have\r\nalmost everywhere acquired additional height. A large amount of subsidence\r\nhas also occurred during the same period, so that the extent of the\r\nsubterranean spaces which have either become the receptacles of sunken\r\nfragments of the earth's crust, or have been rendered capable of supporting\r\nother fragments at a much greater height than before, must be so great that\r\nthey probably equal, if not exceed in volume, the entire continent of\r\nEurope. We are entitled, therefore, to ask what amount of change of\r\nequivalent importance can be proved to have occurred in the earth's crust\r\nwithin an equal quantity of time anterior to the Eocene epoch. They who\r\ncontend for the more intense energy of subterranean causes in the remoter\r\neras of the earth's history, may find it more difficult to give an answer\r\nto this question than they anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe principal effect of volcanic action in the nether regions, during\r\nthe tertiary period, seems to have consisted in the upheaval to the\r\nsurface of hypogene formations of an age anterior to the carboniferous.\r\nThe repetition of another series of movements, of equal violence, might\r\nupraise the plutonic and metamorphic rocks of many secondary periods;\r\nand if the same force should still continue to act, the next convulsions\r\nmight bring up to the day the _tertiary_ and _recent_ hypogene rocks. In\r\nthe course of such changes many of the existing sedimentary strata would\r\nsuffer greatly by denudation, others might assume a metamorphic\r\nstructure, or become melted down into plutonic and volcanic rocks.\r\nMeanwhile the deposition of a vast thickness of new strata would not\r\nfail to take place during the upheaval and partial destruction of the\r\nolder rocks. But I must refer the reader to the last chapter but one of\r\nthis volume for a fuller explanation of these views.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 502. Block section.]\r\n\r\n_Cretaceous period._--It will be shown in the next chapter that chalk, as\r\nwell as lias, has been altered by granite in the eastern Pyrenees. Whether\r\nsuch granite be cretaceous or tertiary cannot easily be decided. Suppose\r\n_b, c, d_, to be three members of the Cretaceous series, the lowest of\r\nwhich, _b_, has been altered by the granite A, the modifying influence not\r\nhaving extended so far as _c_, or having but slightly affected its lowest\r\nbeds. Now it can rarely be possible for the geologist to decide whether the\r\nbeds d existed at the time of the intrusion of A, and alteration of _b_ and\r\n_c_, or whether they were subsequently thrown down upon _c_.\r\n\r\nAs some Cretaceous rocks, however, have been raised to the height of more\r\nthan 9000 feet in the Pyrenees, we must not assume that plutonic formations\r\nof the same age may not have been brought up and exposed by denudation, at\r\nthe height of 2000 or 3000 feet on the flanks of that chain.\r\n\r\n_Period of Oolite and Lias._--In the department of the Hautes Alpes, in\r\nFrance, near Vizille, M. Elie de Beaumont traced a black argillaceous\r\nlimestone, charged with belemnites, to within a few yards of a mass of\r\ngranite. Here the limestone begins to put on a granular texture, but is\r\nextremely fine-grained. When nearer the junction it becomes grey, and\r\nhas a saccharoid structure. In another locality, near Champoleon, a\r\ngranite composed of quartz, black mica, and rose-coloured felspar, is\r\nobserved partly to overlie the secondary rocks, producing an alteration\r\nwhich extends for about 30 feet downwards, diminishing in the beds which\r\nlie farthest from the granite. (See fig. 503.) In the altered mass the\r\nargillaceous beds are hardened, the limestone is saccharoid, the grits\r\nquartzose, and in the midst of them is a thin layer of an imperfect\r\ngranite. It is also an important circumstance that near the point of\r\ncontact, both the granite and the secondary rocks become metalliferous,\r\nand contain nests and small veins of blende, galena, iron, and copper\r\npyrites. The stratified rocks become harder and more crystalline, but\r\nthe granite, on the contrary, softer and less perfectly crystallized\r\nnear the junction.[456-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 503. Junction of granite with Jurassic or Oolite strata\r\nin the Alps, near Champoleon.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the granite is incumbent in the above section (fig. 503.), we\r\ncannot assume that it overflowed the strata, for the disturbances of the\r\nrocks are so great in this part of the Alps that they seldom retain the\r\nposition which they must originally have occupied.\r\n\r\nA considerable mass of syenite, in the Isle of Skye, is described by Dr.\r\nMacCulloch as intersecting limestone and shale, which are of the age of the\r\nlias.[456-B] The limestone, which, at a greater distance from the granite,\r\ncontains shells, exhibits no traces of them near its junction, where it has\r\nbeen converted into a pure crystalline marble.[456-C]\r\n\r\nAt Predazzo, in the Tyrol, secondary strata, some of which are limestones\r\nof the Oolitic period, have been traversed and altered by plutonic rocks,\r\none portion of which is an augitic porphyry, which passes insensibly into\r\ngranite. The limestone is changed into granular marble, with a band of\r\nserpentine at the junction.[456-D]\r\n\r\n_Carboniferous period._--The granite of Dartmoor, in Devonshire, was\r\nformerly supposed to be one of the most ancient of the plutonic rocks, but\r\nis now ascertained to be posterior in date to the culm-measures of that\r\ncounty, which, from their position, and as containing true coal-plants, are\r\nregarded by Professor Sedgwick and Sir R. Murchison as members of the true\r\ncarboniferous series. This granite, like the syenitic granite of\r\nChristiania, has broken through the stratified formations without much\r\nchanging their strike. Hence, on the north-west side of Dartmoor, the\r\nsuccessive members of the culm-measures abut against the granite, and\r\nbecome metamorphic as they approach. These strata are also penetrated by\r\ngranite veins, and plutonic dikes, called \"elvans.\"[457-A] The granite of\r\nCornwall is probably of the same date, and, therefore, as modern as the\r\nCarboniferous strata, if not much newer.\r\n\r\n_Silurian period._--It has long been known that the granite near\r\nChristiania, in Norway, is of newer origin than the Silurian strata\r\nof that region. Von Buch first announced, in 1813, the discovery\r\nof its posteriority in date to limestones containing orthocerata\r\nand trilobites. The proofs consist in the penetration of granite\r\nveins into the shale and limestone, and the alteration of the strata,\r\nfor a considerable distance from the point of contact, both of these\r\nveins and the central mass from which they emanate. (See p. 447.)\r\nVon Buch supposed that the plutonic rock alternated with the\r\nfossiliferous strata, and that large masses of granite were sometimes\r\nincumbent upon the strata; but this idea was erroneous, and arose from\r\nthe fact that the beds of shale and limestone often dip towards the\r\ngranite up to the point of contact, appearing as if they would pass\r\nunder it in mass, as at _a_, fig. 504., and then again on the opposite\r\nside of the same mountain, as at _b_, dip away from the same granite.\r\nWhen the junctions, however, are carefully examined, it is found that\r\nthe plutonic rock intrudes itself in veins, and nowhere covers the\r\nfossiliferous strata in large overlying masses, as is so commonly the\r\ncase with trappean formations.[457-B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 504. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nNow this granite, which is more modern than the Silurian strata of Norway,\r\nalso sends veins in the same country into an ancient formation of gneiss;\r\nand the relations of the plutonic rock and the gneiss, at their junction,\r\nare full of interest when we duly consider the wide difference of epoch\r\nwhich must have separated their origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 505. Granite sending veins into Silurian strata and\r\nGneiss,--Christiania, Norway.]\r\n\r\nThe length of this interval of time is attested by the following\r\nfacts:--The fossiliferous, or Silurian beds, rest unconformably upon the\r\ntruncated edges of the gneiss, the inclined strata of which had been\r\ndisturbed and denuded before the sedimentary beds were superimposed (see\r\nfig. 505.). The signs of denudation are twofold; first, the surface of the\r\ngneiss is seen occasionally, on the removal of the newer beds, containing\r\norganic remains, to be worn and smoothed; secondly, pebbles of gneiss have\r\nbeen found in some of the transition strata. Between the origin, therefore,\r\nof the gneiss and the granite there intervened, first, the period when the\r\nstrata of gneiss were inclined; secondly, the period when they were\r\ndenuded; thirdly, the period of the deposition of the transition deposits.\r\nYet the granite produced, after this long interval, is often so intimately\r\nblended with the ancient gneiss, at the point of junction, that it is\r\nimpossible to draw any other than an arbitrary line of separation between\r\nthem; and where this is not the case, tortuous veins of granite pass freely\r\nthrough gneiss, ending sometimes in threads, as if the older rock had\r\noffered no resistance to their passage. It seems necessary, therefore, to\r\nconceive that the gneiss was softened and more or less melted when\r\npenetrated by the granite. But had such junctions alone been visible, and\r\nhad we not learnt, from other sections, how long a period elapsed between\r\nthe consolidation of the gneiss and the injection of this granite, we might\r\nhave suspected that the gneiss was scarcely solidified, or had not yet\r\nassumed its complete metamorphic character, when invaded by the plutonic\r\nrock. From this example we may learn how impossible it is to conjecture\r\nwhether certain granites in Scotland, and other countries, which send veins\r\ninto gneiss and other metamorphic rocks, are primary, or whether they may\r\nnot belong to some secondary or tertiary period.\r\n\r\n_Oldest granites._--It is not half a century since the doctrine was very\r\ngeneral that all granitic rocks were _primitive_, that is to say, that they\r\noriginated before the deposition of the first sedimentary strata, and\r\nbefore the creation of organic beings (see above, p. 9.). But so greatly\r\nare our views now changed, that we find it no easy task to point out a\r\nsingle mass of granite demonstrably more ancient than all the known\r\nfossiliferous deposits. Could we discover some Lower Cambrian strata\r\nresting immediately on granite, there being no alterations at the point of\r\ncontact, nor any intersecting granitic veins, we might then affirm the\r\nplutonic rock to have originated before the oldest known fossiliferous\r\nstrata. Still it would be presumptuous to suppose that when a small part\r\nonly of the globe has been investigated, we are acquainted with the oldest\r\nfossiliferous strata in the crust of our planet. Even when these are found,\r\nwe cannot assume that there never were any antecedent strata containing\r\norganic remains, which may have become metamorphic. If we find pebbles of\r\ngranite in a conglomerate of the Lower Cambrian system, we may then feel\r\nassured that the parent granite was formed before the Lower Cambrian\r\nformation. But if the incumbent strata be merely Silurian or Upper\r\nCambrian, the fundamental granite, although of high antiquity, may be\r\nposterior in date to _known_ fossiliferous formations.\r\n\r\n_Protrusion of solid granite._--In part of Sutherlandshire, near Brora,\r\ncommon granite, composed of felspar, quartz, and mica, is in immediate\r\ncontact with Oolitic strata, and has clearly been elevated to the surface\r\nat a period subsequent to the deposition of those strata.[459-A] Professor\r\nSedgwick and Sir R. Murchison conceive that this granite has been upheaved\r\nin a solid form; and that in breaking through the submarine deposits, with\r\nwhich it was not perhaps originally in contact, it has fractured them so as\r\nto form a breccia along the line of junction. This breccia consists of\r\nfragments of shale, sandstone, and limestone, with fossils of the oolite,\r\nall united together by a calcareous cement. The secondary strata, at some\r\ndistance from the granite, are but slightly disturbed, but in proportion to\r\ntheir proximity the amount of dislocation becomes greater.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that solid hypogene rocks, whether stratified or\r\nunstratified, have in such cases been driven upwards so as to pierce\r\nthrough yielding sedimentary deposits, we shall be enabled to account\r\nfor many geological appearances otherwise inexplicable. Thus, for\r\nexample, at Weinboehla and Hohnstein, near Meissen, in Saxony, a mass of\r\ngranite has been observed covering strata of the Cretaceous and Oolitic\r\nperiods for the space of between 300 and 400 yards square. It appears\r\nclearly from a recent Memoir of Dr. B. Cotta on this subject[459-B],\r\nthat the granite was thrust into its actual position when solid. There\r\nare no intersecting veins at the junction--no alteration as if by heat,\r\nbut evident signs of rubbing, and a breccia in some places, in which\r\npieces of granite are mingled with broken fragments of the secondary\r\nrocks. As the granite overhangs both the lias and chalk, so the lias is\r\nin some places bent over strata of the cretaceous era.\r\n\r\n_Relative age of the granites of Arran._--In this island, the largest in\r\nthe Firth of Clyde, being twenty miles in length from north to south, the\r\nfour great classes of rocks, the fossiliferous, volcanic, plutonic, and\r\nmetamorphic, are all conspicuously displayed within a very small area, and\r\nwith their peculiar characters strongly contrasted. In the north of the\r\nisland the granite rises to the height of nearly 3000 feet above the sea,\r\nterminating in mountainous peaks. (See section, fig. 506.) On the flanks of\r\nthe same mountains are chloritic-schists, blue roofing-slate, and other\r\nrocks of the metamorphic order (No. 1.), into which the granite (No. 2.)\r\nsends veins. This granite, therefore, is newer than the hypogene schists\r\n(No. 1.), which it penetrates.\r\n\r\nThese schists are highly inclined. Upon them rest beds of conglomerate\r\nand sandstone (No. 3.), which are referable to the Old Red formation, to\r\nwhich succeed various shales and limestones (No. 4.) containing the\r\nfossils of the Carboniferous period, upon which are other strata of\r\nsandstone and conglomerate (upper part of No. 4.), in which no fossils\r\nhave been met with, which it is conjectured may belong to the New Red\r\nsandstone period. All the preceding formations are cut through by the\r\nvolcanic rocks (No. 5.), which consist of greenstone, basalt,\r\npitchstone, claystone-porphyry, and other varieties. These appear either\r\nin the form of dikes, or in dense masses from 50 to 700 feet in\r\nthickness, overlying the strata (No. 4.). They sometimes pass into\r\nsyenite of so crystalline a form, that it may rank as a plutonic\r\nformation; and in one region, at Ploverfield, in Glen Cloy, a\r\nfine-grained granite (6. _a_) is seen associated with the trap\r\nformation, and sending veins into the sandstone or into the upper strata\r\nof No. 4. This interesting discovery of granite in the southern region\r\nof Arran, at a point where it is separated from the northern mass of\r\ngranite by a great thickness of secondary strata and overlying trap, was\r\nmade by Mr. L. A. Necker of Geneva, during his survey of Arran in 1839.\r\nWe also learn from the recent investigations of Prof. A. C. Ramsay, that\r\na similar fine-grained granite (No. 6. _b_) appears in the interior of\r\nthe northern granitic district, forming the nucleus of it, and sending\r\nveins into the older coarse-grained granite (No. 2.). The trap dikes\r\nwhich penetrate the older granite are cut off, according to Mr. Ramsay,\r\nat the junction of the fine grained.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the granite (No. 6. _b_) may be of the same age\r\nas that of Ploverfield (No. 6. _a_), and this again may belong to the same\r\ngeological epoch as the trap formations (No. 5.). If there be any\r\ndifference of date, it would seem that the fine-grained granite must be\r\nnewer than the trappean rocks. But, on the other hand, the coarser granite\r\n(No. 2.) may be the oldest rock in Arran, with the exception of the\r\nhypogene slates (No. 1.), into which it sends veins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 506.

As a general rule, all\r\nsuch aggregates of pebbles and sand are mainly composed of the wreck of\r\npre-existing rocks occurring in the immediate vicinity. The total absence\r\ntherefore of granitic pebbles has justly been a theme of wonder to those\r\ngeologists who have successively visited Arran, and they have carefully\r\nsearched there, as I have done myself, to find an exception, but in vain.\r\nThe rounded masses consist exclusively of quartz, chlorite-schist, and\r\nother members of the metamorphic series; nor in the newer conglomerates of\r\nNo. 4. have any granitic fragments been discovered. Are we then entitled to\r\naffirm that the coarse-grained granite (No. 2.), like the fine-grained\r\nvariety (No. 6. _a_), is more modern than all the other rocks of the\r\nisland? This we cannot assume at present, but we may confidently infer that\r\nwhen the various beds of sandstone and conglomerate were formed, no granite\r\nhad reached the surface, or had been exposed to denudation in Arran. It is\r\nclear that the crystalline schists were ground into sand and shingle when\r\nthe strata No. 3. were deposited, and at that time the waves had never\r\nacted upon the granite, which now sends its veins into the schist. May we\r\nthen conclude, that the schists suffered denudation before they were\r\ninvaded by granite? This opinion, although not inadmissible, is by no\r\nmeans fully borne out by the evidence. For at the time when the Old Red\r\nsandstone originated, the metamorphic strata may have formed islands in the\r\nsea, as in fig. 507., over which the breakers rolled, or from which\r\ntorrents and rivers descended, carrying down gravel and sand. The plutonic\r\nrock or granite (B) may even then have been previously injected at a\r\ncertain depth below, and yet may never have been exposed to denudation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 507. Cross section.]\r\n\r\nAs to the time and manner of the subsequent protrusion of the\r\ncoarse-grained granite (No. 2.), this rock may have been thrust up\r\nbodily, in a solid form, during that long series of igneous operations\r\nwhich produced the trappean and plutonic formations (Nos. 5., 6.\r\n_a_, and 6. _b_).\r\n\r\nWe have shown that these eruptions, whatever their date, were posterior to\r\nthe deposition of all the fossiliferous strata of Arran. We can also prove\r\nthat subsequently both the granitic and trappean rocks underwent great\r\naqueous denudation, which they probably suffered during their emergence\r\nfrom the sea. The fact is demonstrated by the abrupt truncation of numerous\r\ndikes, such as those at _c_, _d_, _e_, which are cut off on the surface of\r\nthe granite and trap. The overlying trap also ceases very abruptly on\r\napproaching the boundary of the great hypogene region, and terminates in a\r\nsteep escarpment facing towards it as at _f_, fig. 506. When in its\r\noriginal fluid state it could not have come thus suddenly to an end, but\r\nmust have filled up the hollow now separating it from the hypogene rocks,\r\nhad such a hollow then existed. This necessity of supposing that both the\r\ntrap and the conglomerate once extended farther, and that veins such as\r\n_c_, _d_, fig. 506., were once prolonged farther upwards, prepares us to\r\nbelieve that the whole of the northern granite may at one time have been\r\ncovered by newer formations, under the pressure of which, before its\r\nprotrusion, it assumed its highly crystalline texture.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the protrusion in a solid form of the northern nucleus of\r\ngranite is confirmed by the manner in which the hypogene slates (No. 1.)\r\nand the beds of conglomerate (No. 3.) dip away from it on all sides. In\r\nsome places indeed the slates are inclined towards the granite, but this\r\nexception might have been looked for, because these hypogene strata have\r\nundergone disturbances at more than one geological epoch, and may at some\r\npoints, perhaps, have their original order of position inverted. The high\r\ninclination, therefore, and the quaquaversal dip of the beds around the\r\nborders of the granitic boss, and the comparative horizontality of the\r\nfossiliferous strata in the southern part of the island, are facts which\r\nall accord with the hypothesis of a great amount of movement at that point\r\nwhere the granite is supposed to have been thrust up bodily, and where we\r\nmay conceive it to have been distended laterally by the repeated injection\r\nof fresh supplies of melted materials.[463-A]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[450-A] Silliman's Journ., No. 69. p. 123.\r\n\r\n[450-B] See \"Principles,\" _Index_, \"Jorullo.\"\r\n\r\n[451-A] \"Principles,\" _Index_, \"Volcanic Eruptions.\"\r\n\r\n[453-A] Darwin, pp. 390. 406.; second edition, p. 319.\r\n\r\n[454-A] See map of Europe and explanation, in Principles, book i.\r\n\r\n[456-A] Elie de Beaumont, sur les Montagnes de l'Oisans, &c.

The\r\nlast-mentioned term expresses, as before explained, a theoretical opinion\r\nthat such strata, after having been deposited from water, acquired, by the\r\ninfluence of heat and other causes, a highly crystalline texture. They who\r\nstill question this opinion may call the rocks under consideration the\r\nstratified hypogene, or schistose hypogene formations.\r\n\r\nThese rocks, when in their most characteristic or normal state, are\r\nwholly devoid of organic remains, and contain no distinct fragments of\r\nother rocks, whether rounded or angular. They sometimes break out in the\r\ncentral parts of narrow mountain chains, but in other cases extend over\r\nareas of vast dimensions, occupying, for example, nearly the whole of\r\nNorway and Sweden, where, as in Brazil, they appear alike in the lower\r\nand higher grounds. In Great Britain, those members of the series which\r\napproach most nearly to granite in their composition, as gneiss,\r\nmica-schist, and hornblende-schist, are confined to the country north of\r\nthe rivers Forth and Clyde.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to trace a general order of succession or\r\nsuperposition in the members of this family; gneiss, for example, having\r\nbeen often supposed to hold invariably a lower geological position than\r\nmica-schist. But although such an order may prevail throughout limited\r\ndistricts, it is by no means universal, nor even general, throughout the\r\nglobe. To this subject, however, I shall again revert, in the last\r\nchapter of this volume, when the chronological relations of the\r\nmetamorphic rocks are pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe following may be enumerated as the principal members of the metamorphic\r\nclass:--gneiss, mica-schist, hornblende-schist, clay-slate,\r\nchlorite-schist, hypogene or metamorphic limestone, and certain kinds of\r\nquartz-rock or quartzite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 508. Fragment of gneiss, natural size; section at right\r\nangles to planes of stratification.]\r\n\r\n_Gneiss._--The first of these, gneiss, may be called stratified granite,\r\nbeing formed of the same materials as granite, namely, felspar, quartz,\r\nand mica. In the specimen here figured, the white layers consist almost\r\nexclusively of granular felspar, with here and there a speck of mica and\r\ngrain of quartz. The dark layers are composed of grey quartz and black\r\nmica, with occasionally a grain of felspar intermixed. The rock splits\r\nmost easily in the plane of these darker layers, and the surface thus\r\nexposed is almost entirely covered with shining spangles of mica. The\r\naccompanying quartz, however, greatly predominates in quantity, but the\r\nmost ready cleavage is determined by the abundance of mica in certain\r\nparts of the dark layer.\r\n\r\nInstead of these thin laminae, gneiss is sometimes simply divided into thick\r\nbeds, in which the mica has only a slight degree of parallelism to the\r\nplanes of stratification.\r\n\r\nThe term \"gneiss,\" however, in geology is commonly used in a wider sense,\r\nto designate a formation in which the above-mentioned rock prevails, but\r\nwith which any one of the other metamorphic rocks, and more especially\r\nhornblende-schist, may alternate. These other members of the metamorphic\r\nseries are, in this case, considered as subordinate to the true gneiss.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of rock allied to gneiss, into which felspar\r\nenters as an essential ingredient, will be understood by referring to\r\nwhat was said of granite. Thus, for example, hornblende may be\r\nsuperadded to mica, quartz, and felspar, forming a syenitic gneiss; or\r\ntalc may be substituted for mica, constituting talcose gneiss, a rock\r\ncomposed of felspar, quartz, and talc, in distinct crystals or grains\r\n(stratified protogine of the French).\r\n\r\n_Hornblende-schist_ is usually black, and composed principally of\r\nhornblende, with a variable quantity of felspar, and sometimes grains of\r\nquartz. When the hornblende and felspar are nearly in equal quantities,\r\nand the rock is not slaty, it corresponds in character with the\r\ngreenstones of the trap family, and has been called \"primitive\r\ngreenstone.\" It may be termed hornblende rock. Some of these hornblendic\r\nmasses may really have been volcanic rocks, which have since assumed a\r\nmore crystalline or metamorphic texture.\r\n\r\n_Mica-schist_, or _Micaceous schist_, is, next to gneiss, one of the most\r\nabundant rocks of the metamorphic series. It is slaty, essentially composed\r\nof mica and quartz, the mica sometimes appearing to constitute the whole\r\nmass. Beds of pure quartz also occur in this formation. In some districts,\r\ngarnets in regular twelve-sided crystals form an integrant part of\r\nmica-schist. This rock passes by insensible gradations into clay-slate.\r\n\r\n_Clay-slate_, or _Argillaceous schist_.--This rock resembles an\r\nindurated clay or shale, is for the most part extremely fissile, often\r\naffording good roofing slate. It may consist of the ingredients of\r\ngneiss, or of an extremely fine mixture of mica and quartz, or talc and\r\nquartz. Occasionally it derives a shining and silky lustre from the\r\nminute particles of mica or talc which it contains. It varies from\r\ngreenish or bluish-grey to a lead colour. It may be said of this, more\r\nthan of any other schist, that it is common to the metamorphic and\r\nfossiliferous series, for some clay-slates taken from each division\r\nwould not be distinguishable by mineralogical characters.\r\n\r\n_Quartzite_, or _Quartz rock_, is an aggregate of grains of quartz,\r\nwhich are either in minute crystals, or in many cases slightly rounded,\r\noccurring in regular strata, associated with gneiss or other metamorphic\r\nrocks. Compact quartz, like that so frequently found in veins, is also\r\nfound together with granular quartzite. Both of these alternate with\r\ngneiss or mica-schist, or pass into those rocks by the addition of mica,\r\nor of felspar and mica.\r\n\r\n_Chlorite-schist_ is a green slaty rock, in which chlorite is abundant\r\nin foliated plates, usually blended with minute grains of quartz, or\r\nsometimes with felspar or mica. Often associated with, and graduating\r\ninto, gneiss and clay-slate.\r\n\r\n_Hypogene_, or _Metamorphic limestone_.--This rock, commonly called\r\n_primary limestone_, is sometimes a thick bedded white crystalline\r\ngranular marble used in sculpture; but more frequently it occurs in thin\r\nbeds, forming a foliated schist much resembling in colour and appearance\r\ncertain varieties of gneiss and mica-schist. It alternates with both\r\nthese rocks, and in like manner with argillaceous schist. It then\r\nusually contains some crystals of mica, and occasionally quartz,\r\nfelspar, hornblende, and talc. This member of the metamorphic series\r\nenters sparingly into the structure of the hypogene districts of Norway,\r\nSweden, and Scotland, but is largely developed in the Alps.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore offering any farther observations on the probable origin of the\r\nmetamorphic rocks, I subjoin, in the form of a glossary, a brief\r\nexplanation of some of the principal varieties and their synonymies.\r\n\r\nACTINOLITE-SCHIST. A slaty foliated rock, composed chiefly of actinolite,\r\n(an emerald-green mineral, allied to hornblende,) with some admixture of\r\nfelspar, or quartz, or mica.\r\n\r\nAMPELITE. Aluminous slate (Brongniart); occurs both in the metamorphic\r\nand fossiliferous series.\r\n\r\nAMPHIBOLITE. Hornblende rock, which see.\r\n\r\nARGILLACEOUS-SCHIST, or CLAY-SLATE. _See_ p. 465.\r\n\r\nARKOSE. Term used by Brongniart for granular Quartzite, which see.\r\n\r\nCHIASTOLITE-SLATE scarcely differs from clay-slate, but includes numerous\r\ncrystals of Chiastolite; in considerable thickness in Cumberland.\r\nChiastolite occurs in long slender rhomboidal crystals. For composition,\r\nsee Table, p. 377.\r\n\r\nCHLORITE-SCHIST. A green slaty rock, in which chlorite, a green scaly\r\nmineral, is abundant. _See_ p. 465.\r\n\r\nCLAY-SLATE, or ARGILLACEOUS-SCHIST. _See_ p. 465.\r\n\r\nEURITE and EURITIC PORPHYRY. A base of compact felspar, with grains of\r\nlaminar felspar, and often mica and other minerals disseminated\r\n(Brongniart). M. D'Aubuisson regards eurite as an extremely fine-grained\r\ngranite, in which felspar predominates, the whole forming an apparently\r\nhomogeneous rock. Eurite has been already mentioned as a plutonic rock, but\r\noccurs also in beds subordinate to gneiss or mica-slate.\r\n\r\nGNEISS. A stratified or laminated rock, same composition as granite.\r\n_See_ p. 464.\r\n\r\nHORNBLENDE ROCK, or AMPHIBOLITE. Composed of hornblende and felspar.\r\nThe same composition as hornblende-schist, stratified, but not fissile.\r\n_See_ p. 376.\r\n\r\nHORNBLENDE-SCHIST, or SLATE. Composed chiefly of hornblende, with\r\noccasionally some felspar. _See_ p. 464.\r\n\r\nHORNBLENDIC or SYENITIC-GNEISS. Composed of felspar, quartz,\r\nand hornblende.\r\n\r\nHYPOGENE LIMESTONE. _See_ p. 465.\r\n\r\nMARBLE. _See_ p. 465.\r\n\r\nMICA-SCHIST, or MICACEOUS-SCHIST. A slaty rock, composed of mica and quartz\r\nin variable proportions. _See_ p. 465.\r\n\r\nMICA-SLATE. _See_ MICA-SCHIST, p. 465.\r\n\r\nPHYLLADE.

A stratified rock; an aggregate of grains of\r\nquartz. _See_ p. 465.\r\n\r\nSERPENTINE occurs in both divisions of the hypogene series, as a stratified\r\nor unstratified rock; contains much magnesia; is chiefly composed of the\r\nmineral called serpentine, mixed with diallage, talc, and steatite. The\r\npure varieties of this rock, called noble serpentine, consist of a hydrated\r\nsilicate of magnesia, generally of a greenish colour: this base is commonly\r\nmixed with oxide of iron.\r\n\r\nTALCOSE-GNEISS. Same composition as talcose-granite or protogine, but\r\neither stratified or laminated. _See_ p. 464.\r\n\r\nTALCOSE-SCHIST consists chiefly of talc, or of talc and quartz, or of talc\r\nand felspar, and has a texture something like that of clay-slate.\r\n\r\nWHITESTONE. Same as Eurite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Metamorphic Strata._\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much of the mineral composition of the metamorphic\r\nrocks, I may combine what remains to be said of their structure and\r\nhistory with an account of the opinions entertained of their probable\r\norigin. At the same time, it may be well to forewarn the reader that we\r\nare here entering upon ground of controversy, and soon reach the limits\r\nwhere positive induction ends, and beyond which we can only indulge in\r\nspeculations. It was once a favourite doctrine, and is still maintained\r\nby many, that these rocks owe their crystalline texture, their want of\r\nall signs of a mechanical origin, or of fossil contents, to a peculiar\r\nand nascent condition of the planet at the period of their formation.\r\nThe arguments in refutation of this hypothesis will be more fully\r\nconsidered when I show, in the last chapter of this volume, to how many\r\ndifferent ages the metamorphic formations are referable, and how gneiss,\r\nmica-schist, clay-slate, and hypogene limestone (that of Carrara for\r\nexample), have been formed, not only since the first introduction of\r\norganic beings into this planet, but even long after many distinct races\r\nof plants and animals had passed away in succession.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine respecting the crystalline strata, implied in the name\r\nmetamorphic, may properly be treated of in this place; and we must first\r\ninquire whether these rocks are really entitled to be called stratified\r\nin the strict sense of having been originally deposited as sediment from\r\nwater. The general adoption by geologists of the term stratified, as\r\napplied to these rocks, sufficiently attests their division into beds\r\nvery analogous, at least in form, to ordinary fossiliferous strata. This\r\nresemblance is by no means confined to the existence in both of an\r\noccasional slaty structure, but extends to every kind of arrangement\r\nwhich is compatible with the absence of fossils, and of sand, pebbles,\r\nripple-mark, and other characters which the metamorphic theory supposes\r\nto have been obliterated by plutonic action. Thus, for example, we\r\nbehold alike in the crystalline and fossiliferous formations an\r\nalternation of beds varying greatly in composition, colour, and\r\nthickness. We observe, for instance, gneiss alternating with layers of\r\nblack hornblende-schist, or with granular quartz, or limestone; and the\r\ninterchange of these different strata may be repeated for an indefinite\r\nnumber of times. In the like manner, mica-schist alternates with\r\nchlorite-schist, and with granular limestone in thin layers.\r\n\r\nAs in fossiliferous formations strata of pure siliceous sand alternate with\r\nmicaceous sand and with layers of clay, so in the crystalline or\r\nmetamorphic rocks we have beds of pure quartzite alternating with\r\nmica-schist and clay-slate. As in the secondary and tertiary series we meet\r\nwith limestone alternating again and again with micaceous or argillaceous\r\nsand, so we find in the hypogene, gneiss and mica-schist alternating with\r\npure and impure granular limestones.\r\n\r\nIt has also been shown that the ripple-mark is very commonly repeated\r\nthroughout a considerable thickness of fossiliferous strata; so in\r\nmica-schist and gneiss, there is sometimes an undulation of the laminae on a\r\nminute scale, which may, perhaps, be a modification of similar inequalities\r\nin the original deposit.\r\n\r\nIn the crystalline formations also, as in many of the sedimentary before\r\ndescribed, single strata are sometimes made up of laminae placed diagonally,\r\nsuch laminae not being regularly parallel to the planes of cleavage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 509. Lamination of clay-slate, Montagne de Seguinat,\r\nnear Gavarnie, in the Pyrenees.]\r\n\r\nThis disposition of the layers is illustrated in the accompanying diagram,\r\nin which I have represented carefully the stratification of a coarse\r\nargillaceous schist, which I examined in the Pyrenees, part of which\r\napproaches in character to a green and blue roofing slate, while part is\r\nextremely quartzose, the whole mass passing downwards into micaceous\r\nschist. The vertical section here exhibited is about 3 feet in height, and\r\nthe layers are sometimes so thin that fifty may be counted in the thickness\r\nof an inch. Some of them consist of pure quartz.\r\n\r\nThe inference drawn from the phenomena above described in favour of the\r\naqueous origin of clay-slate and other crystalline strata, is greatly\r\nstrengthened by the fact that many of these metamorphic rocks occasionally\r\nalternate with, and sometimes pass by intermediate gradations into, rocks\r\nof a decidedly mechanical origin, and exhibiting traces of organic remains.\r\nThe fossiliferous formations, moreover, into which this passage is\r\neffected, are by no means invariably of the same age nor of the highest\r\nantiquity, as will be afterwards explained.\r\n\r\n_Stratification of the metamorphic rocks distinct from cleavage._--The beds\r\ninto which gneiss, mica-schist, and hypogene limestone divide, exhibit most\r\ncommonly, like ordinary strata, a want of perfect geometrical parallelism.\r\nFor this reason, therefore, in addition to the alternate recurrence of\r\nlayers of distinct materials, the stratified arrangement of the crystalline\r\nrocks cannot be explained away by supposing it to be simply a divisional\r\nstructure like that to which we owe some of the slates used for writing and\r\nroofing. _Slaty cleavage_, as it has been called, has in many cases been\r\nproduced by the regular deposition of thin plates of fine sediment one upon\r\nanother; but there are many instances where it is decidedly unconnected\r\nwith such a mode of origin, and where it is not even confined to the\r\naqueous formations. Some kinds of trap, for example, as clinkstone, split\r\ninto laminae, and are used for roofing.\r\n\r\nThere are, says Professor Sedgwick, three distinct forms of structure\r\nexhibited in certain rocks throughout large districts: viz.--First,\r\nstratification; secondly, joints; and thirdly, slaty cleavage; the two\r\nlast having no connection with true bedding, and having been superinduced\r\nby causes absolutely independent of gravitation. All these different\r\nstructures must have different names, even though there be some cases where\r\nit is impossible, after carefully studying the appearances, to decide upon\r\nthe class to which they belong.[469-A]\r\n\r\n_Joints._--Now, in regard to the second of these forms of structure or\r\njoints, they are natural fissures which often traverse rocks in straight\r\nand well-determined lines. They afford to the quarryman, as Sir R.\r\nMurchison observes, when speaking of the phenomena, as exhibited in\r\nShropshire and the neighbouring counties, the greatest aid in the\r\nextraction of blocks of stone; and, if a sufficient number cross each\r\nother, the whole mass of rock is split into symmetrical blocks.[469-B] The\r\nfaces of the joints are for the most part smoother and more regular than\r\nthe surfaces of true strata. The joints are straight-cut chinks, often\r\nslightly open, often passing, not only through layers of successive\r\ndeposition, but also through balls of limestone or other matter which have\r\nbeen formed by concretionary action, since the original accumulation of the\r\nstrata. Such joints, therefore, must often have resulted from one of the\r\nlast changes superinduced upon sedimentary deposits.[469-C]\r\n\r\nIn the annexed diagram the flat surfaces of rock A, B, C, represent exposed\r\nfaces of joints, to which the walls of other joints, J J, are parallel. S S\r\nare the lines of stratification; D D are lines of slaty cleavage, which\r\nintersect the rock at a considerable angle to the planes of stratification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 510. Stratification, joints, and cleavage.]\r\n\r\nJoints, according to Professor Sedgwick, are distinguishable from lines of\r\nslaty cleavage in this, that the rock intervening between two joints has no\r\ntendency to cleave in a direction parallel to the planes of the joints,\r\nwhereas a rock is capable of indefinite subdivision in the direction of its\r\nslaty cleavage. In some cases where the strata are curved, the planes of\r\ncleavage are still perfectly parallel. This has been observed in the slate\r\nrocks of part of Wales (see fig. 511.), which consist of a hard greenish\r\nslate. The true bedding is there indicated by a number of parallel stripes,\r\nsome of a lighter and some of a darker colour than the general mass. Such\r\nstripes are found to be parallel to the true planes of stratification,\r\nwherever these are manifested by ripple-mark, or by beds containing\r\npeculiar organic remains. Some of the contorted strata are of a coarse\r\nmechanical structure, alternating with fine-grained crystalline chloritic\r\nslates, in which case the same slaty cleavage extends through the coarser\r\nand finer beds, though it is brought out in greater perfection in\r\nproportion as the materials of the rock are fine and homogeneous. It is\r\nonly when these are very coarse that the cleavage planes entirely vanish.\r\nThese planes are usually inclined at a very considerable angle to the\r\nplanes of the strata. In the Welsh chains, for example, the average angle\r\nis as much as from 30 deg. to 40 deg.. Sometimes the cleavage planes dip towards\r\nthe same point of the compass as those of stratification, but more\r\nfrequently to opposite points. It may be stated as a general rule, that\r\nwhen beds of coarser materials alternate with those composed of finer\r\nparticles, the slaty cleavage is either entirely confined to the\r\nfine-grained rock, or is very imperfectly exhibited in that of coarser\r\ntexture. This rule holds, whether the cleavage is parallel to the planes of\r\nstratification or not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 511. Parallel planes of cleavage intersecting\r\ncurved strata. (Sedgwick.)]\r\n\r\nIn the Swiss and Savoy Alps, as Mr. Bakewell has remarked, enormous masses\r\nof limestone are cut through so regularly by nearly vertical partings, and\r\nthese are often so much more conspicuous than the seams of stratification,\r\nthat an inexperienced observer will almost inevitably confound them, and\r\nsuppose the strata to be perpendicular in places where in fact they are\r\nalmost horizontal.[470-A]\r\n\r\nNow these joints are supposed to be analogous to those partings which have\r\nbeen already observed to separate volcanic and plutonic rocks into cuboidal\r\nand prismatic masses. On a small scale we see clay and starch when dry\r\nsplit into similar shapes, which is often caused by simple contraction,\r\nwhether the shrinking be due to the evaporation of water, or to a change of\r\ntemperature. It is well known that many sandstones and other rocks expand\r\nby the application of moderate degrees of heat, and then contract again on\r\ncooling; and there can be no doubt that large portions of the earth's crust\r\nhave, in the course of past ages, been subjected again and again to very\r\ndifferent degrees of heat and cold. These alternations of temperature have\r\nprobably contributed largely to the production of joints in rocks.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, as in Saxony, where masses of basalt rest on sandstone,\r\nthe aqueous rock has for the distance of several feet from the point of\r\njunction assumed a columnar structure similar to that of the trap. In like\r\nmanner some hearthstones, after exposure to the heat of a furnace without\r\nbeing melted, have become prismatic. Certain crystals also acquire by the\r\napplication of heat a new internal arrangement, so as to break in a new\r\ndirection, their external form remaining unaltered.\r\n\r\nSir R. Murchison observes, that in referring both joints and slaty cleavage\r\nto crystalline action, we are borne out by a well-known analogy in which\r\ncrystallization has in like manner given rise to two distinct kinds of\r\nstructure in the same body. Thus, for example, in a six-sided prism of\r\nquartz, the planes of cleavage are distinct from those of the prism. It is\r\nimpossible to cleave the crystals parallel to the plane of the prism, just\r\nas slaty rocks cannot be cleaved parallel to the joints; but the quartz\r\ncrystal, like the older schists, may be cleaved _ad infinitum_ in the\r\ndirection of the cleavage planes.[471-A]\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, that the fissures called joints may have been the\r\nresult of different causes, as of some modification of crystalline action,\r\nor simple contraction during consolidation, or during a change of\r\ntemperature. And there are cases where joints may have been due to\r\nmechanical violence, and the strain exerted on strata during their\r\nupheaval, or when they have sunk down below their former level. Professor\r\nPhillips has suggested that the previous existence of divisional planes may\r\noften have determined, and must greatly have modified, the lines and points\r\nof fracture caused in rocks by those forces to which they owe their\r\nelevation or dislocations. These lines and points being those of least\r\nresistance, cannot fail to have influenced the direction in which the solid\r\nmass would give way on the application of external force.\r\n\r\nProfessor Phillips has also remarked that in some slaty rocks the form of\r\nthe outline of fossil shells and trilobites has been much changed by\r\ndistortion, which has taken place in a longitudinal, transverse, or oblique\r\ndirection. This change, he adds, seems to be the result of a \"creeping\r\nmovement\" of the particles of the rock along the planes of cleavage, its\r\ndirection being always uniform over the same tract of country, and its\r\namount in space being sometimes measurable, and being as much as a quarter\r\nor even half an inch. The hard shells are not affected, but only those\r\nwhich are thin.[471-B] Mr. D. Sharpe, following up the same line of\r\ninquiry, came to the conclusion, that the present distorted forms of the\r\nshells in certain British slate rocks may be accounted for by supposing\r\nthat the rocks in which they are imbedded have undergone compression in a\r\ndirection perpendicular to the planes of cleavage, and a corresponding\r\nexpansion in the direction of the dip of the cleavage.[471-C]\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin infers from his observations, that in South America the\r\nstrike of the cleavage planes is very uniform over wide regions, and\r\nthat it corresponds with the strike of the planes of foliation in the\r\ngneiss and mica-schists of the same parts of Chili, Tierra del Fuego,\r\n&c. The explanation which he suggests, is based upon a combination of\r\nmechanical and crystalline forces. The planes, he says, of cleavage, and\r\neven the foliation of mica-schist and gneiss, may be intimately\r\nconnected with the planes of different tension to which the area was\r\nlong subjected, _after_ the main fissures or axis of upheavement had\r\nbeen formed, but _before_ the final consolidation of the mass and the\r\ntotal cessation of all molecular movement.[472-A]\r\n\r\nI have already stated that some extremely fine slates are perfectly\r\nparallel to the planes of stratification, as those of the Niesen, for\r\nexample, near the Lake of Thun, in Switzerland, which contain fucoids, and\r\nare no doubt due to successive aqueous deposition. Even where the slates\r\nare oblique to the general planes of the strata, it by no means follows as\r\na matter of course that they have been caused by crystalline action, for\r\nthey may be the result of that diagonal lamination which I have before\r\ndescribed (p. 17.). In this case, however, there is usually much\r\nirregularity, whereas cleavage planes oblique to the true stratification,\r\nwhich are referred to a crystalline action, are often perfectly\r\nsymmetrical, and observe a strict geometrical parallelism, even when the\r\nstrata are contorted, as already described (p. 470.).\r\n\r\nProfessor Sedgwick, speaking of the planes of slaty cleavage, where they\r\nare decidedly distinct from those of sedimentary deposition, declares\r\nhis opinion that no retreat of parts, no contraction in the dimensions\r\nof rocks in passing to a solid state, can account for the phenomenon. It\r\nmust be referred to crystalline or polar forces acting simultaneously,\r\nand somewhat uniformly, in given directions, on large masses having\r\na homogeneous composition.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, in allusion to slaty cleavage, has suggested, \"that\r\nif rocks have been so heated as to allow a commencement of\r\ncrystallization; that is to say, if they have been heated to a point\r\nat which the particles can begin to move amongst themselves, or at\r\nleast on their own axes, some general law must then determine the\r\nposition in which these particles will rest on cooling. Probably that\r\nposition will have some relation to the direction in which the heat\r\nescapes. Now, when all, or a majority of particles of the same nature,\r\nhave a general tendency to one position, that must of course determine\r\na cleavage plane. Thus we see the infinitesimal crystals of fresh\r\nprecipitated sulphate of barytes, and some other such bodies, arrange\r\nthemselves alike in the fluid in which they float; so as, when stirred,\r\nall to glance with one light, and give the appearance of silky\r\nfilaments. Some sorts of soap, in which insoluble margarates[472-B]\r\nexist, exhibit the same phenomenon when mixed with water; and what\r\noccurs in our experiments on a minute scale may occur in nature on\r\na great one.\"[472-C]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[469-A] Geol.

That the structure of\r\nfossiliferous strata has often been modified by some general cause since\r\ntheir original deposition, and even subsequently to their consolidation and\r\ndislocation, is undeniable. These facts prepare us to believe that still\r\ngreater changes may have been worked out by a greater intensity, or more\r\nprolonged development of the same agency, combined, perhaps, with other\r\ncauses. Now we have seen that, near the immediate contact of granitic veins\r\nand volcanic dikes, very extraordinary alterations in rocks have taken\r\nplace, more especially in the neighbourhood of granite. It will be useful\r\nhere to add other illustrations, showing that a texture undistinguishable\r\nfrom that which characterizes the more crystalline metamorphic formations,\r\nhas actually been superinduced in strata once fossiliferous.\r\n\r\nIn the southern extremity of Norway there is a large district, on the west\r\nside of the fiord of Christiania, in which granite or syenite protrudes in\r\nmountain masses through fossiliferous strata, and usually sends veins into\r\nthem at the point of contact. The stratified rocks, replete with shells and\r\nzoophytes, consist chiefly of shale, limestone, and some sandstone, and all\r\nthese are invariably altered near the granite for a distance of from 50 to\r\n400 yards. The aluminous shales are hardened and have become flinty.\r\nSometimes they resemble jasper. Ribboned jasper is produced by the\r\nhardening of alternate layers of green and chocolate-coloured schist, each\r\nstripe faithfully representing the original lines of stratification. Nearer\r\nthe granite the schist often contains crystals of hornblende, which are\r\neven met with in some places for a distance of several hundred yards from\r\nthe junction; and this black hornblende is so abundant that eminent\r\ngeologists, when passing through the country, have confounded it with the\r\nancient hornblende-schist, subordinate to the great gneiss formation of\r\nNorway. Frequently, between the granite and the hornblende slate, above\r\nmentioned, grains of mica and crystalline felspar appear in the schist, so\r\nthat rocks resembling gneiss and mica-schist are produced. Fossils can\r\nrarely be detected in these schists, and they are more completely effaced\r\nin proportion to the more crystalline texture of the beds, and their\r\nvicinity to the granite. In some places the siliceous matter of the schist\r\nbecomes a granular quartz; and when hornblende and mica are added, the\r\naltered rock loses its stratification, and passes into a kind of granite.\r\nThe limestone, which at points remote from the granite is of an earthy\r\ntexture, blue colour, and often abounds in corals, becomes a white granular\r\nmarble near the granite, sometimes siliceous, the granular structure\r\nextending occasionally upwards of 400 yards from the junction; and the\r\ncorals being for the most part obliterated, though sometimes preserved,\r\neven in the white marble. Both the altered limestone and hardened slate\r\ncontain garnets in many places, also ores of iron, lead, and copper, with\r\nsome silver. These alterations occur equally, whether the granite invades\r\nthe strata in a line parallel to the general strike of the fossiliferous\r\nbeds, or in a line at right angles to their strike, as will be seen by the\r\naccompanying ground plan.[474-A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 512. Altered zone of fossiliferous slate and limestone\r\nnear granite. Christiania.\r\n\r\n_The arrows indicate the dip, and the straight lines the strike,\r\nof the beds._]\r\n\r\nThe indurated and ribboned schists above mentioned bear a strong\r\nresemblance to certain shales of the coal found at Russell's Hall, near\r\nDudley, where coal-mines have been on fire for ages. Beds of shale of\r\nconsiderable thickness, lying over the burning coal, have been baked and\r\nhardened so as to acquire a flinty fracture, the layers being alternately\r\ngreen and brick-coloured.\r\n\r\nThe granite of Cornwall, in like manner, sends forth veins into a coarse\r\nargillaceous-schist, provincially termed killas. This killas is converted\r\ninto hornblende-schist near the contact with the veins. These appearances\r\nare well seen at the junction of the granite and killas, in St. Michael's\r\nMount, a small island nearly 300 feet high, situated in the bay, at a\r\ndistance of about three miles from Penzance.\r\n\r\nThe granite of Dartmoor, in Devonshire, says Sir H. De la Beche, has\r\nintruded itself into the slate and slaty sandstone called greywacke,\r\ntwisting and contorting the strata, and sending veins into them. Hence some\r\nof the slate rocks have become \"micaceous; others more indurated, and with\r\nthe characters of mica-slate and gneiss; while others again appear\r\nconverted into a hard-zoned rock strongly impregnated with felspar.\"[475-A]\r\n\r\nWe learn from the investigations of M. Dufrenoy, that in the eastern\r\nPyrenees there are mountain masses of granite posterior in date to the\r\nformations called lias and chalk of that district, and that these\r\nfossiliferous rocks are greatly altered in texture, and often charged with\r\niron-ore, in the neighbourhood of the granite. Thus in the environs of St.\r\nMartin, near St. Paul de Fenouillet, the chalky limestone becomes more\r\ncrystalline and saccharoid as it approaches the granite, and loses all\r\ntrace of the fossils which it previously contained in abundance. At some\r\npoints, also, it becomes dolomitic, and filled with small veins of\r\ncarbonate of iron, and spots of red iron-ore. At Rancie the lias nearest\r\nthe granite is not only filled with iron-ore, but charged with pyrites,\r\ntremolite, garnet, and a new mineral somewhat allied to felspar, called,\r\nfrom the place in the Pyrenees where it occurs, \"couzeranite.\"\r\n\r\nNow the alterations above described as superinduced in rocks by volcanic\r\ndikes and granite veins, prove incontestably that powers exist in nature\r\ncapable of transforming fossiliferous into crystalline strata--powers\r\ncapable of generating in them a new mineral character, similar, nay, often\r\nabsolutely identical, with that of gneiss, mica-schist, and other\r\nstratified members of the hypogene series. The precise nature of these\r\naltering causes, which may provisionally be termed plutonic, is in a great\r\ndegree obscure and doubtful; but their reality is no less clear, and we\r\nmust suppose the influence of heat to be in some way connected with the\r\ntransmutation, if, for reasons before explained, we concede the igneous\r\norigin of granite.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Gregory Watt, in fusing rocks in the laboratory, and\r\nallowing them to consolidate by slow cooling, prove distinctly that a rock\r\nneed not be perfectly melted in order that a re-arrangement of its\r\ncomponent particles should take place, and a partial crystallization\r\nensue.[475-B] We may easily suppose, therefore, that all traces of shells\r\nand other organic remains may be destroyed; and that new chemical\r\ncombinations may arise, without the mass being so fused as that the lines\r\nof stratification should be wholly obliterated.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, imagine that heat alone, such as may be applied to\r\na stone in the open air, can constitute all that is comprised in\r\nplutonic action. We know that volcanos in eruption not only emit fluid\r\nlava, but give off steam and other heated gases, which rush out in\r\nenormous volume, for days, weeks, or years continuously, and are even\r\ndisengaged from lava during its consolidation. When the materials of\r\ngranite, therefore, came in contact with the fossiliferous stratum in\r\nthe bowels of the earth under great pressure, the contained gases might\r\nbe unable to escape; yet when brought into contact with rocks, might\r\npass through their pores with greater facility than water is known to do\r\n(p. 35.). These aeriform fluids, such as sulphuretted hydrogen, muriatic\r\nacid, and carbonic acid, issue in many places from rents in rocks, which\r\nthey have discoloured and corroded, softening some and hardening others.\r\nIf the rocks are charged with water, they would pass through more\r\nreadily; for, according to the experiments of Henry, water, under an\r\nhydrostatic pressure of 96 feet, will absorb three times as much\r\ncarbonic acid gas as it can under the ordinary pressure of the\r\natmosphere. Although this increased power of absorption would be\r\ndiminished, in consequence of the higher temperature found to exist as\r\nwe descend in the earth, yet Professor Bischoff has shown that the heat\r\nby no means augments in such a proportion as to counteract the effect of\r\naugmented pressure.[476-A] There are other gases, as well as the\r\ncarbonic acid, which water absorbs, and more rapidly in proportion to\r\nthe amount of pressure. Now even the most compact rocks may be regarded,\r\nbefore they have been exposed to the air and dried, in the light of\r\nsponges filled with water; and it is conceivable that heated gases\r\nbrought into contact with them, at great depths, may be absorbed\r\nreadily, and transfused through their pores. Although the gaseous matter\r\nfirst observed would soon be condensed, and part with its heat, yet the\r\ncontinual arrival of fresh supplies from below might, in the course of\r\nages, cause the temperature of the water, and with it that of the\r\ncontaining rock, to be materially raised.\r\n\r\nM. Fournet, in his description of the metalliferous gneiss near Clermont,\r\nin Auvergne, states that all the minute fissures of the rock are quite\r\nsaturated with free carbonic acid gas, which rises plentifully from the\r\nsoil there and in many parts of the surrounding country. The various\r\nelements of the gneiss, with the exception of the quartz, are all softened;\r\nand new combinations of the acid, with lime, iron, and manganese, are\r\ncontinually in progress.[476-B]\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the power of subterranean gases is afforded by the\r\nstufas of St. Calogero, situated in the largest of the Lipari Islands.\r\nHere, according to the description published by Hoffmann, horizontal strata\r\nof tuff, extending for 4 miles along the coast, and forming cliffs more\r\nthan 200 feet high, have been discoloured in various places, and strangely\r\naltered by the \"all-penetrating vapours.\" Dark clays have become yellow, or\r\noften snow-white; or have assumed a chequered or brecciated appearance,\r\nbeing crossed with ferruginous red stripes. In some places the fumaroles\r\nhave been found by analysis to consist partly of sublimations of oxide of\r\niron; but it also appears that veins of chalcedony and opal, and others of\r\nfibrous gypsum, have resulted from these volcanic exhalations.[476-C]\r\n\r\nThe reader may also refer to M. Virlet's account of the corrosion of hard,\r\nflinty, and jaspideous rocks near Corinth, by the prolonged agency of\r\nsubterranean gases[477-A]; and to Dr. Daubeny's description of the\r\ndecomposition of trachytic rocks in the Solfatara, near Naples, by\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen and muriatic acid gases.[477-B]\r\n\r\nAlthough in all these instances we can only study the phenomena as\r\nexhibited at the surface, it is clear that the gaseous fluids must have\r\nmade their way through the whole thickness of porous or fissured rocks,\r\nwhich intervene between the subterranean reservoirs of gas and the external\r\nair. The extent, therefore, of the earth's crust, which the vapours have\r\npermeated and are now permeating, may be thousands of fathoms in thickness,\r\nand their heating and modifying influence may be spread throughout the\r\nwhole of this solid mass.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Professor Bischoff that the steam of a hot spring at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, although its temperature is only from 133 deg. to 167 deg. F., has\r\nconverted the surface of some blocks of black marble into a doughy mass. He\r\nconceives, therefore, that steam in the bowels of the earth having a\r\ntemperature equal or even greater than the melting point of lava, and\r\nhaving an elasticity of which even Papin's digester can give but a faint\r\nidea, may convert rocks into liquid matter.[477-C]\r\n\r\nThe above observations are calculated to meet some of the objections which\r\nhave been urged against the metamorphic theory on the ground of the small\r\npower of rocks to conduct heat; for it is well known that rocks, when dry\r\nand in the air, differ remarkably from metals in this respect. It has been\r\nasked how the changes which extend merely for a few feet from the contact\r\nof a dike could have penetrated through mountain masses of crystalline\r\nstrata several miles in thickness. Now it has been stated that the plutonic\r\ninfluence of the syenite of Norway has sometimes altered fossiliferous\r\nstrata for a distance of a quarter of a mile, both in the direction of\r\ntheir dip and of their strike. (See fig. 512. p. 474.) This is undoubtedly\r\nan extreme case; but is it not far more philosophical to suppose that this\r\ninfluence may, under favourable circumstances, affect denser masses, than\r\nto invent an entirely new cause to account for effects merely differing in\r\nquantity, and not in kind? The metamorphic theory does not require us to\r\naffirm that some contiguous mass of granite has been the altering power;\r\nbut merely that an action, existing in the interior of the earth at an\r\nunknown depth, whether thermal, electrical, or other, analogous to that\r\nexerted near intruding masses of granite, has, in the course of vast and\r\nindefinite periods, and when rising perhaps from a large heated surface,\r\nreduced strata thousands of yards thick to a state of semi-fusion, so that\r\non cooling they have become crystalline, like gneiss. Granite may have been\r\nanother result of the same action in a higher state of intensity, by which\r\na thorough fusion has been produced; and in this manner the passage from\r\ngranite into gneiss may be explained.\r\n\r\nSome geologists are of opinion, that the alternate layers of mica and\r\nquartz, or mica and felspar, or lime and felspar, are so much more\r\ndistinct, in certain metamorphic rocks, than the ingredients composing\r\nalternate layers in many sedimentary deposits, that the similar particles\r\nmust be supposed to have exerted a molecular attraction for each other, and\r\nto have thus congregated together in layers more distinct in mineral\r\ncomposition than before they were crystallized.\r\n\r\nIn considering, then, the various data already enumerated, the forms of\r\nstratification in metamorphic rocks, their passage on the one hand into the\r\nfossiliferous, and on the other into the plutonic formations, and the\r\nconversions which can be ascertained to have occurred in the vicinity of\r\ngranite, we may conclude that gneiss and mica-schist may be nothing more\r\nthan altered micaceous and argillaceous sandstones that granular quartz may\r\nhave been derived from siliceous sandstone, and compact quartz from the\r\nsame materials. Clay-slate may be altered shale, and granular marble may\r\nhave originated in the form of ordinary limestone, replete with shells and\r\ncorals, which have since been obliterated; and, lastly, calcareous sands\r\nand marls may have been changed into impure crystalline limestones.\r\n\r\n\"Hornblende-schist,\" says Dr. MacCulloch, \"may at first have been mere\r\nclay; for clay or shale is found altered by trap into Lydian stone, a\r\nsubstance differing from hornblende-schist almost solely in compactness and\r\nuniformity of texture.\"[478-A] \"In Shetland,\" remarks the same author,\r\n\"argillaceous-schist (or clay-slate), when in contact with granite, is\r\nsometimes converted into hornblende-schist, the schist becoming first\r\nsiliceous, and ultimately, at the contact, hornblende-schist.\"[478-B]\r\n\r\nThe anthracite and plumbago associated with hypogene rocks may have been\r\ncoal; for not only is coal converted into anthracite in the vicinity of\r\nsome trap dikes, but we have seen that a like change has taken place\r\ngenerally even far from the contact of igneous rocks, in the disturbed\r\nregion of the Appalachians.[478-C] At Worcester, in the state of\r\nMassachusetts, 45 miles due west of Boston, a bed of plumbago and impure\r\nanthracite occurs, interstratified with mica-schist. It is about 2 feet in\r\nthickness, and has been made use of both as fuel, and in the manufacture of\r\nlead pencils. At the distance of 30 miles from the plumbago, there occurs,\r\non the borders of Rhode Island, an impure anthracite in slates, containing\r\nimpressions of coal-plants of the genera _Pecopteris_, _Neuropteris_,\r\n_Calamites_, &c. This anthracite is intermediate in character between that\r\nof Pennsylvania and the plumbago of Worcester, in which last the gaseous or\r\nvolatile matter (hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen) is to the carbon only in\r\nthe proportion of 3 per cent. After traversing the country in various\r\ndirections, I came to the conclusion that the carboniferous shales or\r\nslates with anthracite and plants, which in Rhode Island often pass into\r\nmica-schist, have at Worcester assumed a perfectly crystalline and\r\nmetamorphic texture; the anthracite having been nearly transmuted into that\r\nstate of pure carbon which is called plumbago or graphite.[479-A]\r\n\r\nThe total absence of any trace of fossils has inclined many geologists to\r\nattribute the origin of crystalline strata to a period antecedent to the\r\nexistence of organic beings. Admitting, they say, the obliteration, in some\r\ncases, of fossils by plutonic action, we might still expect that traces of\r\nthem would oftener occur in certain ancient systems of slate, in which, as\r\nin Cumberland, some conglomerates occur. But in urging this argument, it\r\nseems to have been forgotten that there are stratified formations of\r\nenormous thickness, and of various ages, and some of them very modern, all\r\nformed after the earth had become the abode of living creatures, which are,\r\nnevertheless, in certain districts, entirely destitute of all vestiges of\r\norganic bodies. In some, the traces of fossils may have been effaced by\r\nwater and acids, at many successive periods; and it is clear, that, the\r\nolder the stratum, the greater is the chance of its being\r\nnon-fossiliferous, even if it has escaped all metamorphic action.\r\n\r\nIt has been also objected to the metamorphic theory, that the chemical\r\ncomposition of the secondary strata differs essentially from that of the\r\ncrystalline schists, into which they are supposed to be convertible.[479-B]\r\nThe \"primary\" schists, it is said, usually contain a considerable\r\nproportion of potash or of soda, which the secondary clays, shales, and\r\nslates do not, these last being the result of the decomposition of\r\nfelspathic rocks, from which the alkaline matter has been abstracted during\r\nthe process of decomposition. But this reasoning proceeds on insufficient\r\nand apparently mistaken data; for a large portion of what is usually called\r\nclay, marl, shale, and slate does actually contain a certain, and often a\r\nconsiderable, proportion of alkali; so that it is difficult, in many\r\ncountries, to obtain clay or shale sufficiently free from alkaline\r\ningredients to allow of their being burnt into bricks or used for pottery.\r\n\r\nThus the argillaceous shales and slates of the Old Red sandstone, in\r\nForfarshire and other parts of Scotland, are so much charged with\r\nalkali, derived from triturated felspar, that, instead of hardening when\r\nexposed to fire, they sometimes melt into a glass. They contain no lime,\r\nbut appear to consist of extremely minute grains of the various\r\ningredients of granite, which are distinctly visible in the\r\ncoarser-grained varieties, and in almost all the interposed sandstones.\r\nThese laminated clays and shales might certainly, if crystallized,\r\nresemble in composition many of the primary strata.\r\n\r\nThere is also potash in fossil vegetable remains, and soda in the salts by\r\nwhich strata are sometimes so largely impregnated, as in Patagonia.\r\n\r\nAnother objection has been derived from the alternation of highly\r\ncrystalline strata with others having a less crystalline texture. The heat,\r\nit is said, in its ascent from below, must have traversed the less altered\r\nschists before it reached a higher and more crystalline bed. In answer to\r\nthis, it may be observed, that if a number of strata differing greatly in\r\ncomposition from each other be subjected to equal quantities of heat, there\r\nis every probability that some will be more fusible than others. Some, for\r\nexample, will contain soda, potash, lime, or some other ingredient capable\r\nof acting as a flux; while others may be destitute of the same elements,\r\nand so refractory as to be very slightly affected by a degree of heat\r\ncapable of reducing others to semi-fusion. Nor should it be forgotten that,\r\nas a general rule, the less crystalline rocks do really occur in the upper,\r\nand the more crystalline in the lower part of each metamorphic series.\r\n\r\nThere are geologists, however, of high authority, who admit the\r\nmetamorphic origin of gneiss and mica-schist even on a grand scale in\r\nsome mountain-chains, and who nevertheless believe that gneiss has in\r\nsome instances been an eruptive rock, deriving its lamination from\r\nmotion when in a fluid or viscous state. Mr. Scrope, in his description\r\nof the Ponza Islands, ascribes \"the zoned structure of the Hungarian\r\nperlite (a semi-vitreous trachyte) to its having subsided, in obedience\r\nto the impulse of its own gravity, down a slightly inclined plane, while\r\npossessed of an imperfect fluidity. In the islands of Ponza and\r\nPalmarola, the direction of the zones is more frequently vertical than\r\nhorizontal, because the mass was impelled from below upwards.\"[480-A] In\r\nlike manner, Mr. Darwin attributes the lamination and fissile structure\r\nof volcanic rocks of the trachytic series, including some obsidians in\r\nAscension, Mexico, and elsewhere, to their having moved when liquid in\r\nthe direction of the laminae. The zones consist sometimes of layers of\r\nair-cells drawn out and lengthened in the supposed direction of the\r\nmoving mass. He compares this division into parallel zones, thus caused\r\nby the stretching of a pasty mass as it flowed slowly onwards, to the\r\nzoned or ribboned structure of ice, which Professor James Forbes has\r\nso ably explained, showing that it is due to the fissuring of a\r\nviscous body in motion.[480-B] Mr. Darwin also imagines the lamination\r\nor _foliation_, as he terms it, of gneiss and mica-schist in South\r\nAmerica to be the extreme result of that process of which cleavage\r\nis the first effect.[480-C]\r\n\r\nM. Elie de Beaumont, while he regards the greater part of the gneiss and\r\nmica-schist of the Alps as sedimentary strata altered by plutonic action,\r\nstill conceives that some of the Alpine gneiss may have been erupted, or,\r\nin other words, may be granite drawn out into parallel laminae in the manner\r\nof trachyte as above alluded to.[480-D]\r\n\r\nOpinions such as these, and others which might be cited, prove the\r\ndifficulty of arriving at clear theoretical views on this subject. I may\r\nalso add another difficulty. In many extensive regions experienced\r\ngeologists have been at a loss to decide which of two sets of divisional\r\nplanes were referable to cleavage and which to stratification; and that,\r\ntoo, where the rocks are of undisputed aqueous origin. After much doubt,\r\nthey have sometimes discovered that they had at first mistaken the lines of\r\ncleavage for those of deposition, because the former were by far the most\r\nmarked of the two. Now if such slaty masses should become highly\r\ncrystalline, and be converted into gneiss, hornblende-schist, or any other\r\nmember of the hypogene class, the cleavage planes would be more likely to\r\nremain visible than those of stratification.\r\n\r\nBut although the cause last-mentioned may, in some instances, be a \"vera\r\ncausa,\" as applied to gneiss and mica-schist, I believe it to be an\r\nexception to the general rule. Nor would it, I conceive, produce that kind\r\nof irregular parallelism in the laminae which belongs to so many of the\r\nhypogene rocks of the Grampians, Pyrenees, and the White mountains of North\r\nAmerica, where I have chiefly studied them.\r\n\r\nBut it will be impossible for the reader duly to appreciate the propriety\r\nof the term metamorphic, as applied to the strata formerly called\r\nprimitive, until I have shown, in the next chapter, at how many distinct\r\nperiods these crystalline strata have been formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[474-A] Keilhau, Gaea Norvegica, pp. 61-63.\r\n\r\n[475-A] Geol.

We can rarely hope to define with\r\nexactness the date of both these periods, the fossils having been destroyed\r\nby plutonic action, and the mineral characters being the same, whatever the\r\nage. Superposition itself is an ambiguous test, especially when we desire\r\nto determine the period of crystallization. Suppose, for example, we are\r\nconvinced that certain metamorphic strata in the Alps, which are covered by\r\ncretaceous beds, are altered lias; this lias may have assumed its\r\ncrystalline texture in the cretaceous or in some tertiary period, the\r\nEocene for example. If in the latter, it should be called Eocene when\r\nregarded as a metamorphic rock, although it be liassic when considered in\r\nreference to the era of its deposition. According to this view, the\r\nsuperposition of chalk does not prevent the subjacent _metamorphic_ rock\r\nfrom being Eocene. If, however, in the progress of science, we should\r\nsucceed in ascertaining the twofold chronological relations of the\r\nmetamorphic formations, it might be useful to adopt a twofold terminology.\r\nWe might call the strata above alluded to Liassic-Eocene, or\r\nLiassic-Cretaceous strata of the Hypogene class; the first term referring\r\nto the era of deposition, the second to that of crystallization.\r\n\r\nWhen discussing the ages of the plutonic rocks, we have seen that examples\r\noccur of various primary, secondary, and tertiary deposits converted into\r\nmetamorphic strata, near their contact with granite. There can be no doubt\r\nin these cases that strata, once composed of mud, sand, and gravel, or of\r\nclay, marl, and shelly limestone, have for the distance of several yards,\r\nand in some instances several hundred feet, been turned into gneiss,\r\nmica-schist, hornblende-schist, chlorite-schist, quartz rock, statuary\r\nmarble, and the rest. (See the two preceding Chapters.)\r\n\r\nBut when the metamorphic action has operated on a grander scale, it tends\r\nentirely to destroy all monuments of the date of its development. It may be\r\neasy to prove the identity of two different parts of the same stratum; one,\r\nwhere the rock has been in contact with a volcanic or plutonic mass, and\r\nhas been changed into marble or hornblende-schist, and another not far\r\ndistant, where the same bed remains unaltered and fossiliferous; but when\r\nwe have to compare two portions of a mountain chain--the one metamorphic,\r\nand the other unaltered--all the labour and skill of the most practised\r\nobservers are required. I shall mention one or two examples of alteration\r\non a grand scale, in order to explain to the student the kind of reasoning\r\nby which we are led to infer that dense masses of fossiliferous strata have\r\nbeen converted into crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\n_Northern Apennines--Carrara._--The celebrated marble of Carrara, used in\r\nsculpture, was once regarded as a type of primitive limestone. It abounds\r\nin the mountains of Massa Carrara, or the \"Apuan Alps,\" as they have been\r\ncalled, the highest peaks of which are nearly 6000 feet high. Its great\r\nantiquity was inferred from its mineral texture, from the absence of\r\nfossils, and its passage downwards into talc-schist and garnetiferous\r\nmica-schist; these rocks again graduating downwards into gneiss, which is\r\npenetrated, at Forno, by granite veins. Now the researches of MM. Savi,\r\nBoue, Pareto, Guidoni, De la Beche, Hoffmann, and Pilla, have demonstrated\r\nthat this marble, once supposed to be formed before the existence of\r\norganic beings, is, in fact, an altered limestone of the Oolitic period,\r\nand the underlying crystalline schists are secondary sandstones and shales,\r\nmodified by plutonic action. In order to establish these conclusions it was\r\nfirst pointed out, that the calcareous rocks bordering the Gulf of Spezia,\r\nand abounding in Oolitic fossils, assume a texture like that of Carrara\r\nmarble, in proportion as they are more and more invaded by certain trappean\r\nand plutonic rocks, such as diorite, euphotide, serpentine, and granite,\r\noccurring in the same country.\r\n\r\nIt was then observed that, in places where the secondary formations are\r\nunaltered, the uppermost consist of common Apennine limestone with\r\nnodules of flint, below which are shales, and at the base of all,\r\nargillaceous and siliceous sandstones. In the limestone, fossils are\r\nfrequent, but very rare in the underlying shale and sandstone. Then a\r\ngradation was traced laterally from these rocks into another and\r\ncorresponding series, which is completely metamorphic; for at the top of\r\nthis we find a white granular marble, wholly devoid of fossils, and\r\nalmost without stratification, in which there are no nodules of flint,\r\nbut in its place siliceous matter disseminated through the mass in the\r\nform of prisms of quartz. Below this, and in place of the shales, are\r\ntalc-schists, jasper, and hornstone; and at the bottom, instead of the\r\nsiliceous and argillaceous sandstones, are quartzite and gneiss.[483-A]\r\nHad these secondary strata of the Apennines undergone universally as\r\ngreat an amount of transmutation, it would have been impossible to form\r\na conjecture respecting their true age; and then, according to the\r\ncommon method of geological classification, they would have ranked as\r\nprimary rocks. In that case the date of their origin would have been\r\nthrown back to an era antecedent to the deposition of the Lower Silurian\r\nor Cambrian strata, although in reality they were formed in the Oolitic\r\nperiod, and altered at some subsequent and perhaps much later epoch.\r\n\r\n_Alps of Switzerland._--In the Alps, analogous conclusions have been drawn\r\nrespecting the alteration of strata on a still more extended scale. In the\r\neastern part of that chain, some of the primary fossiliferous strata, as\r\nwell as the older secondary formations, together with the oolitic and\r\ncretaceous rocks, are distinctly recognizable. Tertiary deposits also\r\nappear in a less elevated position on the flanks of the Eastern Alps; but\r\nin the Central or Swiss Alps, the primary fossiliferous and older secondary\r\nformations disappear, and the Cretaceous, Oolitic, Liassic, and at some\r\npoints even the Eocene strata, graduate insensibly into metamorphic rocks,\r\nconsisting of granular limestone, talc-schist, talcose-gneiss, micaceous\r\nschist, and other varieties. In regard to the age of this vast assemblage\r\nof crystalline strata, we can merely affirm that some of the upper portions\r\nare altered newer secondary, and some of them even Eocene deposits; but we\r\ncannot avoid suspecting that the disappearance both of the older secondary\r\nand primary fossiliferous rocks may be owing to their having been all\r\nconverted in this region into crystalline schist.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey to those who have never visited the Alps a just\r\nidea of the various proofs which concur to produce this conviction. In the\r\nfirst place, there are certain regions where Oolitic, Cretaceous, and\r\nEocene strata have been turned into granular marble, gneiss, and other\r\nmetamorphic schists, near their contact with granite. This fact shows\r\nundeniably that plutonic causes continued to be in operation in the Alps\r\ndown to a late period, even after the deposition of some of the nummulitic\r\nor older Eocene formations. Having established this point, we are the more\r\nwilling to believe that many inferior fossiliferous rocks, probably exposed\r\nfor longer periods to a similar action, may have become metamorphic to a\r\nstill greater extent.\r\n\r\nWe also discover in parts of the Swiss Alps dense masses of secondary\r\nand even tertiary strata, which have assumed that semi-crystalline\r\ntexture which Werner called transition, and which naturally led his\r\nfollowers, who attached great importance to mineral characters taken\r\nalone, to class them as transition formations, or as groups older than\r\nthe lowest secondary rocks. (See p. 92.) Now, it is probable that these\r\nstrata have been affected, although in a less intense degree, by that\r\nsame plutonic action which has entirely altered and rendered metamorphic\r\nso many of the subjacent formations; for in the Alps, this action has by\r\nno means been confined to the immediate vicinity of granite. Granite,\r\nindeed, and other plutonic rocks, rarely make their appearance at the\r\nsurface, notwithstanding the deep ravines which lay open to view the\r\ninternal structure of these mountains. That they exist below at no great\r\ndepth we cannot doubt, and we have already seen (p. 445.) that at some\r\npoints, as in the Valorsine, near Mont Blanc, granite and granitic veins\r\nare observable, piercing through talcose gneiss, which passes insensibly\r\nupwards into secondary strata.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly in the Alps of Switzerland and Savoy, more than in any\r\nother district in Europe, that the geologist is prepared to meet with the\r\nsigns of an intense development of plutonic action; for here we find the\r\nmost stupendous monuments of mechanical violence, by which strata thousands\r\nof feet thick have been bent, folded, and overturned. (See p. 58.) It is\r\nhere that marine secondary formations of a comparatively modern date, such\r\nas the Oolitic and Cretaceous, have been upheaved to the height of 12,000,\r\nand some Eocene strata to elevations of 10,000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea; and even deposits of the Miocene era have been raised 4000 or 5000\r\nfeet, so as to rival in height the loftiest mountains in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will consult the works of many eminent geologists who have\r\nexplored the Alps, especially those of MM. De Beaumont, Studer, Necker,\r\nBoue, and Murchison, he will learn that they all share, more or less fully,\r\nin the opinions above expressed. It has, indeed, been stated by MM. Studer\r\nand Hugi, that there are complete alternations on a large scale of\r\nsecondary strata, containing fossils, with gneiss and other rocks, of a\r\nperfectly metamorphic structure. I have visited some of the most remarkable\r\nlocalities referred to by these authors; but although agreeing with them\r\nthat there are passages from the fossiliferous to the metamorphic series\r\nfar from the contact of granite or other plutonic rocks, I was unable to\r\nconvince myself that the distinct alternations of highly crystalline, with\r\nunaltered strata above alluded to, might not admit of a different\r\nexplanation. In one of the sections described by M. Studer in the highest\r\nof the Bernese Alps, namely in the Roththal, a valley bordering the line of\r\nperpetual snow on the northern side of the Jungfrau, there occurs a mass\r\nof gneiss 1000 feet thick, and 15,000 feet long, which I examined, not only\r\nresting upon, but also again covered by strata containing oolitic fossils.\r\nThese anomalous appearances may partly be explained by supposing great\r\nsolid wedges of intrusive gneiss to have been forced in laterally between\r\nstrata to which I found them to be in many sections unconformable. The\r\nsuperposition, also, of the gneiss to the oolite may, in some cases, be due\r\nto a reversal of the original position of the beds in a region where the\r\nconvulsions have been on so stupendous a scale.\r\n\r\nOn the Sattel also, at the base of the Gestellihorn, above Enzen, in the\r\nvalley of Urbach, near Meyringen, some of the intercalations of gneiss\r\nbetween fossiliferous strata may, I conceive, be ascribed to mechanical\r\nderangement. Almost any hypothesis of repeated changes of position may be\r\nresorted to in a region of such extraordinary confusion. The secondary\r\nstrata may first have been vertical, and then certain portions may have\r\nbecome metamorphic (the plutonic influence ascending from below), while\r\nintervening strata remained unchanged. The whole series of beds may then\r\nagain have been thrown into a nearly horizontal position, giving rise to\r\nthe superposition of crystalline upon fossiliferous formations.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked, in Chap. XXXIV., that as the hypogene rocks, both\r\nstratified and unstratified, crystallize originally at a certain depth\r\nbeneath the surface, they must always, before they are upraised and exposed\r\nat the surface, be of considerable antiquity, relatively to a large portion\r\nof the fossiliferous and volcanic rocks. They may be forming at all\r\nperiods; but before any of them can become visible, they must be raised\r\nabove the level of the sea, and some of the rocks which previously\r\nconcealed them must have been removed by denudation.\r\n\r\n_Order of succession in metamorphic rocks._--There is no universal and\r\ninvariable order of superposition in metamorphic rocks, although a\r\nparticular arrangement may prevail throughout countries of great extent,\r\nfor the same reason that it is traceable in those sedimentary formations\r\nfrom which crystalline strata are derived. Thus, for example, we have seen\r\nthat in the Apennines, near Carrara, the descending series, where it is\r\nmetamorphic, consists of, 1st, saccharine marble; 2dly, talcose-schist; and\r\n3dly, of quartz-rock and gneiss; where unaltered, of, 1st, fossiliferous\r\nlimestone; 2dly, shale; and 3dly, sandstone.\r\n\r\nBut if we investigate different mountain chains, we find gneiss,\r\nmica-schist, hornblende-schist, chlorite-schist, hypogene, limestone,\r\nand other rocks, succeeding each other, and alternating with each other,\r\nin every possible order. It is, indeed, more common to meet with some\r\nvariety of clay-slate forming the uppermost member of a metamorphic\r\nseries than any other rock; but this fact by no means implies, as some\r\nhave imagined, that all clay-slates were formed at the close of an\r\nimaginary period, when the deposition of the crystalline strata gave way\r\nto that of ordinary sedimentary deposits. Such clay-slates, in fact, are\r\nvariable in composition, and sometimes alternate with fossiliferous\r\nstrata, so that they may be said to belong almost equally to the\r\nsedimentary and metamorphic order of rocks. It is probable that had they\r\nbeen subjected to more intense plutonic action, they would have been\r\ntransformed into hornblende-schist, foliated chlorite-schist, scaly\r\ntalcose-schist, mica-schist, or other more perfectly crystalline rocks,\r\nsuch as are usually associated with gneiss.\r\n\r\n_Uniformity of mineral character in Hypogene rocks._--Humboldt has\r\nemphatically remarked, that when we pass to another hemisphere, we see\r\nnew forms of animals and plants, and even new constellations in the\r\nheavens; but in the rocks we still recognize our old acquaintances,--the\r\nsame granite, the same gneiss, the same micaceous schist, quartz-rock,\r\nand the rest. It is certainly true that there is a great and striking\r\ngeneral resemblance in the principal kinds of hypogene rocks, although\r\nof very different ages and countries; but it has been shown that each of\r\nthese are, in fact, geological families of rocks, and not definite\r\nmineral compounds. They are much more uniform in aspect than sedimentary\r\nstrata, because these last are often composed of fragments varying\r\ngreatly in form, size, and colour, and contain fossils of different\r\nshapes and mineral composition, and acquire a variety of tints from the\r\nmixture of various kinds of sediment. The materials of such strata, if\r\nmelted and made to crystallize, would be subject to chemical laws,\r\nsimple and uniform in their action, the same in every climate, and\r\nwholly undisturbed by mechanical and organic causes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it would be a great error to assume that the hypogene rocks,\r\nconsidered as aggregates of simple minerals, are really more homogeneous in\r\ntheir composition than the several members of the sedimentary series. In\r\nthe first place, different assemblages of hypogene rocks occur in different\r\ncountries; and, secondly, in any one district, the rocks which pass under\r\nthe same name are often extremely variable in their component ingredients,\r\nor at least in the proportions in which each of these are present. Thus,\r\nfor example, gneiss and mica-schist, so abundant in the Grampians, are\r\nwanting in Cumberland, Wales, and Cornwall; in parts of the Swiss and\r\nItalian Alps, the gneiss and granite are talcose, and not micaceous, as in\r\nScotland; hornblende prevails in the granite of Scotland--schorl in that of\r\nCornwall--albite in the plutonic rocks of the Andes--common felspar in\r\nthose of Europe. In one part of Scotland, the mica-schist is full of\r\ngarnets; in another it is wholly devoid of them: while in South America,\r\naccording to Mr. Darwin, it is the gneiss, and not the mica-schist, which\r\nis most commonly garnetiferous. And not only do the proportional quantities\r\nof felspar, quartz, mica, hornblende, and other minerals, vary in hypogene\r\nrocks bearing the same name; but what is still more important, the\r\ningredients, as we have seen, of the same simple mineral are not always\r\nconstant (p. 369., and table, p. 377.).\r\n\r\n_The Metamorphic strata, why less calcareous than the fossiliferous._--It\r\nhas been remarked, that the quantity of calcareous matter in metamorphic\r\nstrata, or, indeed, in the hypogene formations generally, is far less than\r\nin fossiliferous deposits. Thus the crystalline schists of the Grampians in\r\nScotland, consisting of gneiss, mica-schist, hornblende-schist, and other\r\nrocks, many thousands of yards in thickness, contain an exceedingly small\r\nproportion of interstratified calcareous beds, although these have been the\r\nobjects of careful search for economical purposes. Yet limestone is not\r\nwanting in the Grampians, and it is associated sometimes with gneiss,\r\nsometimes with mica-schist, and in other places with other members of the\r\nmetamorphic series. But where limestone occurs abundantly, as at Carrara,\r\nand in parts of the Alps, in connection with hypogene rocks, it usually\r\nforms one of the superior members of the crystalline group.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity, then, of carbonate of lime in the plutonic and metamorphic\r\nrocks generally, seems to be the result of some general cause. So long as\r\nthe hypogene rocks were believed to have originated antecedently to the\r\ncreation of organic beings, it was easy to impute the absence of lime to\r\nthe non-existence of those mollusca and zoophytes by which shells and\r\ncorals are secreted; but when we ascribe the crystalline formations to\r\nplutonic action, it is natural to inquire whether this action itself may\r\nnot tend to expel carbonic acid and lime from the materials which it\r\nreduces to fusion or semi-fusion. Although we cannot descend into the\r\nsubterranean regions where volcanic heat is developed, we can observe in\r\nregions of spent volcanos, such as Auvergne and Tuscany, hundreds of\r\nsprings, both cold and thermal, flowing out from granite and other rocks,\r\nand having their waters plentifully charged with carbonate of lime. The\r\nquantity of calcareous matter which these springs transfer, in the course\r\nof ages, from the lower parts of the earth's crust to the superior or newly\r\nformed parts of the same, must be considerable.[487-A]\r\n\r\nIf the quantity of siliceous and aluminous ingredients brought up by\r\nsuch springs were great, instead of being utterly insignificant, it\r\nmight be contended that the mineral matter thus expelled implies simply\r\nthe decomposition of ordinary subterranean rocks; but the prodigious\r\nexcess of carbonate of lime over every other element must, in the course\r\nof time, cause the crust of the earth below to be almost entirely\r\ndeprived of its calcareous constituents, while we know that the same\r\naction imparts to newer deposits, ever forming in seas and lakes, an\r\nexcess of carbonate of lime. Calcareous matter is poured into these\r\nlakes, and the ocean, by a thousand springs and rivers; so that part of\r\nalmost every new calcareous rock chemically precipitated, and of many\r\nreefs of shelly and coralline stone, must be derived from mineral matter\r\nsubtracted by plutonic agency, and driven up by gas and steam from fused\r\nand heated rocks in the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nNot only carbonate of lime, but also free carbonic acid gas is given off\r\nplentifully from the soil and crevices of rocks in regions of active and\r\nspent volcanos, as near Naples, and in Auvergne. By this process, fossil\r\nshells or corals may often lose their carbonic acid, and the residual lime\r\nmay enter into the composition of augite, hornblende, garnet, and other\r\nhypogene minerals. That the removal of the calcareous matter of fossil\r\nshells is of frequent occurrence, is proved by the fact of such organic\r\nremains being often replaced by silex or other minerals, and sometimes by\r\nthe space once occupied by the fossil being left empty, or only marked by a\r\nfaint impression. We ought not indeed to marvel at the general absence of\r\norganic remains from the crystalline strata, when we bear in mind how often\r\nfossils are obliterated, wholly or in part, even in tertiary\r\nformations--how often vast masses of sandstone and shale, of different\r\nages, and thousands of feet thick, are devoid of fossils--how certain\r\nstrata may first have been deprived of a portion of their fossils when they\r\nbecame semi-crystalline, or assumed the _transition_ state of Werner--and\r\nhow the remaining organic remains have been effaced when they were rendered\r\nmetamorphic. Some rocks of the last-mentioned class, moreover, must have\r\nbeen exposed again and again to renewed plutonic action.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[483-A] See notices of Savi, Hoffmann, and others, referred to by Boue,\r\nBull. de la Soc.

He\r\ntaught that mineral veins had originally been open fissures which were\r\ngradually filled up with crystalline and metallic matter, and that many of\r\nthem, after being once filled, had been again enlarged or re-opened. He\r\nalso pointed out that veins thus formed are not all referable to one era,\r\nbut are of various geological dates.\r\n\r\nSuch opinions, although slightly hinted at by earlier writers, had never\r\nbefore been generally received, and their announcement by one of high\r\nauthority and great experience constituted an era in the science.\r\nNevertheless, I have shown, when tracing, in another work, the history and\r\nprogress of geology, that Werner was far behind some of his predecessors in\r\nhis theory of the volcanic rocks, and less enlightened than his\r\ncontemporary, Dr. Hutton, in his speculations as to the origin of\r\ngranite.[489-A] According to him, the plutonic formations, as well as the\r\ncrystalline schists, were substances precipitated from a chaotic fluid in\r\nsome primeval or nascent condition of the planet; and the metals,\r\ntherefore, being closely connected with them, had partaken, according to\r\nhim, of a like mysterious origin. He also held that the trap rocks were\r\naqueous deposits, and that dikes of porphyry, greenstone, and basalt, were\r\nfissures filled with their several contents from above. Hence he naturally\r\ninferred that mineral veins had derived their component materials from an\r\nincumbent ocean, rather than from a subterranean source; that these\r\nmaterials had been first dissolved in the waters above, instead of having\r\nrisen up by sublimation from lakes and seas of igneous matter below.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the hypothesis of a primeval fluid, or \"chaotic\r\nmenstruum,\" was abandoned, in reference to the plutonic formations, and\r\nwhen all geologists had come to be of one mind as to the true relation of\r\nthe volcanic and trappean rocks, reasonable hopes began to be entertained\r\nthat the phenomena of mineral veins might be explained by known causes, or\r\nby chemical, thermal, and electrical agency still at work in the interior\r\nof the earth. The grounds of this conclusion will be better understood when\r\nthe geological facts brought to light by mining operations have been\r\ndescribed and explained.\r\n\r\n_On different kinds of mineral veins._--Every geologist is familiarly\r\nacquainted with those veins of quartz which abound in hypogene strata,\r\nforming lenticular masses of limited extent. They are sometimes observed,\r\nalso, in sandstones and shales. Veins of carbonate of lime are equally\r\ncommon in fossiliferous rocks, especially in limestones. Such veins appear\r\nto have once been chinks or small cavities, caused, like cracks in clay, by\r\nthe shrinking of the mass, which has consolidated from a fluid state, or\r\nhas simply contracted its dimensions in passing from a higher to a lower\r\ntemperature. Siliceous, calcareous, and occasionally metallic matters, have\r\nsometimes found their way simultaneously into such empty spaces, by\r\ninfiltration from the surrounding rocks, or by segregation, as it is often\r\ntermed. Mixed with hot water and steam, metallic ores may have permeated a\r\npasty matrix until they reached those receptacles formed by shrinkage, and\r\nthus gave rise to that irregular assemblage of veins, called by the Germans\r\na \"stockwerk,\" in allusion to the different floors on which the mining\r\noperations are in such cases carried on.\r\n\r\nThe more ordinary or regular veins are usually worked in vertical shafts,\r\nand have evidently been fissures produced by mechanical violence. They\r\ntraverse all kinds of rocks, both hypogene and fossiliferous, and extend\r\ndownwards to indefinite or unknown depths. We may assume that they\r\ncorrespond with such rents as we see caused from time to time by the shock\r\nof an earthquake. Metalliferous veins, referable to such agency, are\r\noccasionally a few inches wide, but more commonly 3 or 4 feet. They hold\r\ntheir course continuously in a certain prevailing direction for miles or\r\nleagues, passing through rocks varying in mineral composition.\r\n\r\n[3 Illustrations: Fig. 513. Fig. 514. Fig. 515. Vertical sections of the\r\nmine of Huel Peever, Redruth, Cornwall.]\r\n\r\n_That metalliferous veins were fissures._--As some intelligent miners,\r\nafter an attentive study of metalliferous veins, have been unable to\r\nreconcile many of their characteristics with the hypothesis of fissures, I\r\nshall begin by stating the evidence in its favour. The most striking fact\r\nperhaps which can be adduced in its support is, the coincidence of a\r\nconsiderable proportion of mineral veins with _faults_, or those\r\ndislocations of rocks which are indisputably due to mechanical force, as\r\nabove explained (p. 62.). There are even proofs in almost every mining\r\ndistrict of a succession of faults, by which the opposite walls of rents,\r\nnow the receptacles of metallic substances, have suffered displacement.\r\nThus, for example, suppose _a a_, fig. 513., to be a tin lode in Cornwall,\r\nthe term _lode_ being applied to veins containing metallic ores. This lode,\r\nrunning east and west, is a yard wide, and is shifted by a copper lode (_b\r\nb_), of similar width.\r\n\r\nThe first fissure (_a a_) has been filled with various materials, partly\r\nof chemical origin, such as quartz, fluor-spar, peroxide of tin,\r\nsulphuret of copper, arsenical pyrites, bismuth, and sulphuret of\r\nnickel, and partly of mechanical origin, comprising clay and angular\r\nfragments or detritus of the intersected rocks. The plates of quartz and\r\nthe ores are, in some places, parallel to the vertical sides or walls of\r\nthe vein, being divided from each other by alternating layers of clay,\r\nor other earthy matter. Occasionally the metallic ores are disseminated\r\nin detached masses among the veinstones.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that, after the gradual introduction of the tin and other\r\nsubstances, the second rent (_b b_) was produced by another fracture\r\naccompanied by a displacement of the rocks along the plane of _b b_. This\r\nnew opening was then filled with minerals, some of them resembling those in\r\n_a a_, as fluor-spar (or fluate of lime) and quartz; others different, the\r\ncopper being plentiful and the tin wanting or very scarce.\r\n\r\nWe must next suppose the shock of a third earthquake to occur, breaking\r\nasunder all the rocks along the line c _c_, fig. 514.; the fissure in this\r\ninstance, being only 6 inches wide, and simply filled with clay, derived,\r\nprobably, from the friction of the walls of the rent, or partly, perhaps,\r\nwashed in from above. This new movement has heaved the rock in such a\r\nmanner as to interrupt the continuity of the copper vein (_b b_), and, at\r\nthe same time, to shift or heave laterally in the same direction a portion\r\nof the tin vein which had not previously been broken.\r\n\r\nAgain, in fig. 515. we see evidence of a fourth fissure (_d d_), also\r\nfilled with clay, which has cut through the tin vein (_a a_), and has\r\nlifted it slightly upwards towards the south. The various changes here\r\nrepresented are not ideal, but are exhibited in a section obtained in\r\nworking an old Cornish mine, long since abandoned, in the parish of\r\nRedruth, called Huel Peever, and described both by Mr. Williams and Mr.\r\nCarne.[491-A] The principal movement here referred to, or that of _c c_,\r\nfig. 515., extends through a space of no less than 84 feet; but in this, as\r\nin the case of the other three, it will be seen that the outline of the\r\ncountry above, or the geographical features of Cornwall, are not affected\r\nby any of the dislocations, a powerful denuding force having clearly been\r\nexerted subsequently to all the faults. (See above, p. 69.) It is commonly\r\nsaid in Cornwall, that there are eight distinct systems of veins which can\r\nin like manner be referred to as many successive movements or fractures;\r\nand the German miners of the Hartz Mountains speak also of eight systems of\r\nveins, referable to as many periods.\r\n\r\nBesides the proofs of mechanical action already explained, the opposite\r\nwalls of veins are frequently polished and striated, as if they had\r\nundergone great friction, and this even in cases where there has been no\r\nshift. We may attribute such rubbing to a vibratory motion known to\r\naccompany earthquakes, and to produce trituration on the opposite walls of\r\nrents. Similar movements have sometimes occurred in mineral veins which\r\nhad been wholly or partially filled up; for included pieces of rock,\r\ndetached from the sides, are found to be rounded, polished, and striated.\r\n\r\nThat a great many veins communicated originally with the surface of the\r\ncountry above, or with the bed of the sea, is proved by the occurrence\r\nin them of well rounded pebbles, agreeing with those in superficial\r\nalluviums, as in Auvergne and Saxony. In Bohemia, such pebbles have been\r\nmet with at the depth of 180 fathoms. In Cornwall, Mr. Carne mentions\r\ntrue pebbles of quartz and slate in a tin lode of the Relistran Mine, at\r\nthe depth of 600 feet below the surface. They were cemented by oxide of\r\ntin and bisulphuret of copper, and were traced over a space more than 12\r\nfeet long and as many wide.[492-A] Marine fossil shells, also, have been\r\nfound at great depths, having probably been engulphed during submarine\r\nearthquakes. Thus, a gryphaea is stated by M. Virlet to have been met\r\nwith in a lead-mine near Semur, in France, and a madrepore in a compact\r\nvein of cinnabar in Hungary.[492-B]\r\n\r\nWhen different sets or systems of veins occur in the same country, those\r\nwhich are supposed to be of contemporaneous origin, and which are filled\r\nwith the same kind of metals, often maintain a general parallelism of\r\ndirection. Thus, for example, both the tin and copper veins in Cornwall run\r\nnearly east and west, while the lead-veins run north and south; but there\r\nis no general law of direction common to different mining districts. The\r\nparallelism of the veins is another reason for regarding them as ordinary\r\nfissures, for we observe that contemporaneous trap dikes, admitted by all\r\nto be masses of melted matter which have filled rents, are often parallel.\r\nAssuming, then, that veins are simply fissures in which chemical and\r\nmechanical deposits have accumulated, we may next consider the proofs of\r\ntheir having been filled gradually and often during successive\r\nenlargements. I have already spoken of parallel layers of clay, quartz, and\r\nore. Werner himself observed, in a vein near Gersdorff, in Saxony, no less\r\nthan thirteen beds of different minerals, arranged with the utmost\r\nregularity on each side of the central layer. This layer was formed of two\r\nbeds of calcareous spar, which had evidently lined the opposite walls of a\r\nvertical cavity. The thirteen beds followed each other in corresponding\r\norder, consisting of fluor-spar, heavy spar, galena, &c. In these cases,\r\nthe central mass has been last formed, and the two plates which coat the\r\nouter walls of the rent on each side are the oldest of all. If they consist\r\nof crystalline precipitates, they may be explained by supposing the fissure\r\nto have remained unaltered in its dimensions, while a series of changes\r\noccurred in the nature of the solutions which rose up from below; but such\r\na mode of deposition, in the case of many successive and parallel layers,\r\nappears to be exceptional.\r\n\r\nIf a veinstone consist of crystalline matter, the points of the crystals\r\nare always turned inwards, or towards the centre of the vein; in other\r\nwords, they point in that direction where there was most space for the\r\ndevelopment of the crystals. Thus each new layer receives the impression of\r\nthe crystals of the preceding layer, and imprints its crystals on the one\r\nwhich follows, until at length the whole of the vein is filled: the two\r\nlayers which meet dovetail the points of their crystals the one into the\r\nother. But in Cornwall, some lodes occur where the vertical plates, or\r\n_combs_, as they are there called, exhibit crystals so dovetailed as to\r\nprove that the same fissure has been often enlarged. Sir H. De la Beche\r\ngives the following curious and instructive example (fig. 516.) from a\r\ncopper-mine in granite, near Redruth.[493-A] Each of the plates or combs\r\n(_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_) are double, having the points of their\r\ncrystals turned inwards along the axis of the comb. The sides or walls (2,\r\n3, 4, 5, and 6) are parted by a thin covering of ochreous clay, so that\r\neach comb is readily separable from another by a moderate blow of the\r\nhammer. The breadth of each represents the whole width of the fissure at\r\nsix successive periods, and the outer walls of the vein, where the first\r\nnarrow rent was formed, consisted of the granitic surfaces 1 and 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 516. Copper lode, near Redruth, enlarged at\r\nsix successive periods.]\r\n\r\nA somewhat analogous interpretation is applicable to numbers of other\r\ncases, where clay, sand, or angular detritus, alternate with ores and\r\nveinstones. Thus, we may imagine the sides of a fissure to be encrusted\r\nwith siliceous matter, as Von Buch observed, in Lancerote, the walls of\r\na volcanic crater formed in 1731 to be traversed by an open rent in\r\nwhich hot vapours had deposited hydrate of silica, the incrustation\r\nnearly extending to the middle.[493-B] Such a vein may then be filled\r\nwith clay or sand, and afterwards re-opened, the new rent dividing the\r\nargillaceous deposit, and allowing a quantity of rubbish to fall down.\r\nVarious metals and spars may then be precipitated from aqueous solutions\r\namong the interstices of this heterogeneous mass.\r\n\r\nThat such changes have repeatedly occurred, is demonstrated by\r\noccasional cross-veins, implying the oblique fracture of previously\r\nformed chemical and mechanical deposits. Thus, for example, M. Fournet,\r\nin his description of some mines in Auvergne worked under his\r\nsuperintendence, observes, that the granite of that country was first\r\npenetrated by veins of granite, and then dislocated, so that open rents\r\ncrossed both the granite and the granitic veins. Into such openings,\r\nquartz, accompanied by sulphurets of iron and arsenical pyrites, was\r\nintroduced. Another convulsion then burst open the rocks along the old\r\nline of fracture, and the first set of deposits were cracked and often\r\nshattered, so that the new rent was filled, not only with angular\r\nfragments of the adjoining rocks, but with pieces of the older\r\nveinstones. Polished and striated surfaces on the sides or in the\r\ncontents of the vein also attest the reality of these movements. A new\r\nperiod of repose then ensued, during which various sulphurets were\r\nintroduced, together with hornstone quartz, by which angular fragments\r\nof the older quartz before mentioned were cemented into a breccia. This\r\nperiod was followed by other dilatations of the same veins, and other\r\nsets of mineral deposits, until, at last, pebbles of the basaltic lavas\r\nof Auvergne, derived from superficial alluviums, probably of Miocene or\r\nolder Pliocene date, were swept into the veins. I have not space to\r\nenumerate all the changes minutely detailed by M. Fournet, but they are\r\nvaluable, both to the miner and geologist, as showing how the supposed\r\nsigns of violent catastrophes may be the monuments, not of one\r\nparoxysmal shock, but of reiterated movements.\r\n\r\nSuch repeated enlargement and re-opening of veins might have been\r\nanticipated, if we adopt the theory of fissures, and reflect how few of\r\nthem have ever been sealed up entirely, and that a country with fissures\r\nonly partially filled must naturally offer much feebler resistance along\r\nthe old lines of fracture than any where else. It is quite otherwise in the\r\ncase of dikes, where each opening has been the receptacle of one continuous\r\nand homogeneous mass of melted matter, the consolidation of which has taken\r\nplace under considerable pressure. Trappean dikes can rarely fail to\r\nstrengthen the rocks at the points where before they were weakest; and if\r\nthe upheaving force is again exerted in the same direction, the crust of\r\nthe earth will give way anywhere rather than at the precise points where\r\nthe first rents were produced.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of metalliferous veins have their opposite walls nearly\r\nparallel, and sometimes over a wide extent of country. There is a fine\r\nexample of this in the celebrated vein of Andreasberg in the Hartz, which\r\nhas been worked for a depth of 500 yards perpendicularly, and 200\r\nhorizontally, retaining almost every where a width of 3 feet. But many\r\nlodes in Cornwall and elsewhere are extremely variable in size, being 1 or\r\n2 inches in one part, and then 8 or 10 feet in another, at the distance of\r\na few fathoms, and then again narrowing as before. Such alternate swelling\r\nand contraction is so often characteristic as to require explanation. The\r\nwalls of fissures in general, observes Sir H. De la Beche, are rarely\r\nperfect planes throughout their entire course, nor could we well expect\r\nthem to be so, since they commonly pass through rocks of unequal hardness\r\nand different mineral composition. If, therefore, the opposite sides of\r\nsuch irregular fissures slide upon each other, that is to say, if there be\r\na fault, as in the case of so many mineral veins, the parallelism of the\r\nopposite walls is at once entirely destroyed, as will be readily seen by\r\nstudying the annexed diagrams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 517. Schematic sketch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 518. Schematic sketch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 519. Schematic sketch.]\r\n\r\nLet _a b_, fig. 517., be a line of fracture traversing a rock, and let _a\r\nb_, fig. 518., represent the same line. Now, if we cut a piece of paper\r\nrepresenting this line, and then move the lower portion of this cut paper\r\nsideways from _a_ to _a'_, taking care that the two pieces of paper still\r\ntouch each other at the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we obtain an irregular\r\naperture at _c_, and isolated cavities at _d d d_, and when we compare such\r\nfigures with nature we find that, with certain modifications, they\r\nrepresent the interior of faults and mineral veins. If, instead of sliding\r\nthe cut paper to the right hand, we move the lower part towards the left,\r\nabout the same distance that it was previously slid to the right, we obtain\r\nconsiderable variation in the cavities so produced, two long irregular open\r\nspaces, _f f_, fig. 519., being then formed. This will serve to show to\r\nwhat slight circumstances considerable variations in the character of the\r\nopenings between unevenly fractured surfaces may be due, such surfaces\r\nbeing moved upon each other, so as to have numerous points of contact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 520. Schematic sketch.]\r\n\r\nMost lodes are perpendicular to the horizon, or nearly so; but some of\r\nthem have a considerable inclination or \"hade,\" as it is termed, the\r\nangles of dip varying from 15 deg. to 45 deg.. The course of a vein is\r\nfrequently very straight; but if tortuous, it is found to be choked up\r\nwith clay, stones, and pebbles, at points where it departs most widely\r\nfrom verticality. Hence at places, such as _a_, fig. 520., the miner\r\ncomplains that the ores are \"nipped,\" or greatly reduced in quantity,\r\nthe space for their free deposition having been interfered with in\r\nconsequence of the pre-occupancy of the lode by earthy materials. When\r\nlodes are many fathoms wide, they are usually filled for the most part\r\nwith earthy matter, and fragments of rock, through which the ores are\r\nmuch disseminated. The metallic substances frequently coat or encircle\r\ndetached pieces of rock, which our miners call \"horses\" or \"riders.\"\r\nThat we should find some mineral veins which split into branches is also\r\nnatural, for we observe the same in regard to open fissures.\r\n\r\n_Chemical deposits in veins._--If we now turn from the mechanical to the\r\nchemical agencies which have been instrumental in the production of mineral\r\nveins, it may be remarked that those parts of fissures which were not\r\nchoked up with the ruins of fractured rocks must always have been filled\r\nwith water; and almost every vein has probably been the channel by which\r\nhot springs, so common in countries of volcanos and earthquakes, have made\r\ntheir way to the surface. For we know that the rents in which ores abound\r\nextend downwards to vast depths, where the temperature of the interior of\r\nthe earth is more elevated. We also know that mineral veins are most\r\nmetalliferous near the contact of plutonic and stratified formations,\r\nespecially where the former send veins into the latter, a circumstance\r\nwhich indicates an original proximity of veins at their inferior extremity\r\nto igneous and heated rocks. It is moreover acknowledged that even those\r\nmineral and thermal springs which, in the present state of the globe, are\r\nfar from volcanos, are nevertheless observed to burst out along great lines\r\nof upheaval and dislocation of rocks.[496-A] It is also ascertained that\r\nall the substances with which hot springs are impregnated agree with those\r\ndischarged in a gaseous form from volcanos. Many of these bodies occur as\r\nveinstones; such as silex, carbonate of lime, sulphur, fluor-spar, sulphate\r\nof barytes, magnesia, oxide of iron, and others. I may add that, if veins\r\nhave been filled with gaseous emanations from masses of melted matter,\r\nslowly cooling in the subterranean regions, the contraction of such masses\r\nas they pass from a plastic to a solid state would, according to the\r\nexperiments of Deville on granite (a rock which may be taken as a\r\nstandard), produce a reduction in volume amounting to 10 per cent. The slow\r\ncrystallization, therefore, of such plutonic rocks supplies us with a force\r\nnot only capable of rending open the incumbent rocks by causing a failure\r\nof support, but also of giving rise to faults whenever one portion of the\r\nearth's crust subsides slowly while another contiguous to it happens to\r\nrest on a different foundation, so as to remain unmoved.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are led to infer, from the foregoing reasoning, that there has\r\noften been an intimate connection between metalliferous veins and hot\r\nsprings holding mineral matter in solution, yet we must not on that account\r\nexpect that the contents of hot springs and mineral veins would be\r\nidentical. On the contrary, M. E. de Beaumont has judiciously observed that\r\nwe ought to find in veins those substances which, being least soluble, are\r\nnot discharged by hot springs,--or that class of simple and compound bodies\r\nwhich the thermal waters ascending from below would first precipitate on\r\nthe walls of a fissure, as soon as their temperature began slightly to\r\ndiminish. The higher they mount towards the surface, the more will they\r\ncool, till they acquire the average temperature of springs, being in that\r\ncase chiefly charged with the most soluble substances, such as the alkalis,\r\nsoda and potash. These are not met with in veins, although they enter so\r\nlargely into the composition of granitic rocks.[496-B]\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, therefore, the arrangement and distribution of\r\nmetallic matter in veins may be referred to ordinary chemical action, or\r\nto those variations in temperature, which waters holding the ores in\r\nsolution must undergo, as they rise upwards from great depths in the earth.\r\nBut there are other phenomena which do not admit of the same simple\r\nexplanation. Thus, for example, in Derbyshire, veins containing ores of\r\nlead, zinc, and copper, but chiefly lead, traverse alternate beds of\r\nlimestone and greenstone. The ore is plentiful where the walls of the rent\r\nconsist of limestone, but is reduced to a mere string when they are formed\r\nof greenstone, or \"toadstone,\" as it is called provincially. Not that the\r\noriginal fissure is narrower where the greenstone occurs, but because more\r\nof the space is there filled with veinstones, and the waters at such points\r\nhave not parted so freely with their metallic contents.\r\n\r\n\"Lodes in Cornwall,\" says Mr. Robert W. Fox, \"are very much influenced\r\nin their metallic riches by the nature of the rock which they traverse,\r\nand they often change in this respect very suddenly, in passing from one\r\nrock to another. Thus many lodes which yield abundance of ore in\r\ngranite, are unproductive in clay-slate, or killas, and _vice versa_.\r\nThe same observation applies to killas and the granitic porphyry called\r\nelvan. Sometimes, in the same continuous vein, the granite will contain\r\ncopper, and the killas tin, or _vice versa_.\"[497-A] Mr. Fox, after\r\nascertaining the existence at present of electric currents in some of\r\nthe metalliferous veins in Cornwall, has speculated on the probability\r\nof the same cause having acted originally on the sulphurets and muriates\r\nof copper, tin, iron, and zinc, dissolved in the hot water of fissures,\r\nso as to determine the peculiar mode of their distribution. After\r\ninstituting experiments on this subject, he even endeavoured to account\r\nfor the prevalence of an east and west direction in the principal\r\nCornish lodes by their position at right angles to the earth's\r\nmagnetism; but Mr. Henwood and other experienced miners have pointed out\r\nobjections to the theory; and it must be owned that the direction of\r\nveins in different mining districts varies so entirely that it seems to\r\ndepend on lines of fracture, rather than on the laws of voltaic\r\nelectricity. Nevertheless, as different kinds of rock would be often in\r\ndifferent electrical conditions, we may readily believe that electricity\r\nmust often govern the arrangement of metallic precipitates in a rent.\r\n\r\n\"I have observed,\" says Mr. R. Fox, \"that when the chloride of tin in\r\nsolution is placed in the voltaic circuit, part of the tin is deposited in\r\na metallic state at the negative pole, and part at the positive one, in the\r\nstate of a peroxide, such as it occurs in our Cornish mines. This\r\nexperiment may serve to explain why tin is found contiguous to, and\r\nintermixed with, copper ore, and likewise separated from it, in other parts\r\nof the same lode.\"[497-B]\r\n\r\n_Relative age of the different metals._--After duly reflecting on the facts\r\nabove described, we cannot doubt that mineral veins, like eruptions of\r\ngranite or trap, are referable to many distinct periods of the earth's\r\nhistory, although it may be more difficult to determine the precise age of\r\nveins; because they have often remained open for ages, and because, as we\r\nhave seen, the same fissure, after having been once filled, has frequently\r\nbeen re-opened or enlarged. But besides this diversity of age, it has been\r\nsupposed by some geologists that certain metals have been produced\r\nexclusively in earlier, others in more modern times,--that tin, for\r\nexample, is of higher antiquity than copper, copper than lead or silver,\r\nand all of them more ancient than gold. I shall first point out that the\r\nfacts once relied upon in support of some of these views are contradicted\r\nby later experience, and then consider how far any chronological order of\r\narrangement can be recognized in the position of the precious and other\r\nmetals in the earth's crust. In the first place, it is not true that veins\r\nin which tin abounds are the oldest lodes worked in Great Britain. The\r\ngovernment survey of Ireland has demonstrated, that in Wexford veins of\r\ncopper and lead (the latter as usual being argentiferous) are much older\r\nthan the tin of Cornwall. In each of the two countries a very similar\r\nseries of geological changes has occurred at two distinct epochs,--in\r\nWexford, before the Devonian strata were deposited; in Cornwall, after the\r\ncarboniferous epoch. To begin with the Irish mining district: We have\r\ngranite in Wexford, traversed by granite veins, which veins also intrude\r\nthemselves into the Silurian strata, the same Silurian rocks as well as the\r\nveins having been denuded before the Devonian beds were superimposed. Next\r\nwe find, in the same county, that elvans, or straight dikes of porphyritic\r\ngranite, have cut through the granite and the veins before mentioned, but\r\nhave not penetrated the Devonian rocks. Subsequently to these elvans, veins\r\nof copper and lead were produced, being of a date certainly posterior to\r\nthe Silurian, and anterior to the Devonian; for they do not enter the\r\nlatter, and, what is still more decisive, streaks or layers of derivative\r\ncopper have been found near Wexford in the Devonian, not far from points\r\nwhere mines of copper are worked in the Silurian strata.[498-A]\r\n\r\nAlthough the precise age of such copper lodes cannot be defined, we may\r\nsafely affirm that they were either filled at the close of the Silurian or\r\ncommencement of the Devonian period. Besides copper, lead, and silver,\r\nthere is some gold in these ancient or primary metalliferous veins. A few\r\nfragments also of tin found in Wicklow in the drift are supposed to have\r\nbeen derived from veins of the same age.[498-B]\r\n\r\nNext, if we turn to Cornwall, we find there also the monuments of a very\r\nanalogous sequence of events. First the granite was formed; then, about\r\nthe same period, veins of fine-grained granite, often tortuous (see fig.\r\n496., p. 445.), penetrating both the outer crust of granite and the\r\nadjoining fossiliferous or primary rocks, including the coal-measures;\r\nthirdly, elvans, holding their course straight through granite, granitic\r\nveins, and fossiliferous slates; fourthly, veins of tin also containing\r\ncopper, the first of those eight systems of fissures of different ages\r\nalready alluded to, p. 491. Here, then, the tin lodes are newer than the\r\nelvans. It has indeed been stated by some Cornish miners that the elvans\r\nare in some few instances posterior to the oldest tin-bearing lodes, but\r\nthe observations of Sir H. De la Beche during the survey led him to an\r\nopposite conclusion, and he has shown how the cases referred to in\r\ncorroboration can be otherwise interpreted.[499-A] We may, therefore,\r\nassert that the most ancient Cornish lodes are younger than the\r\ncoal-measures of that part of England, and it follows that they are of a\r\nmuch later date than the Irish copper and lead of Wexford and some\r\nadjoining counties. How much later it is not so easy to declare,\r\nalthough probably they are not newer than the beginning of the Permian\r\nperiod, as no tin lodes have been discovered in any red sandstone of the\r\nPoikilitic group, which overlies the coal in the south-west of England.\r\n\r\nThere are lead veins in the Mendip hills which extend through the mountain\r\nlimestone into the Permian or Dolomitic conglomerate, and others in\r\nGlamorganshire which enter the lias. Those worked near Frome, in\r\nSomersetshire, have been traced into the Inferior Oolite. In Bohemia, the\r\nrich veins of silver of Joachimsthal cut through basalt containing olivine,\r\nwhich overlies tertiary lignite, in which are leaves of dicotyledonous\r\ntrees. This silver, therefore, is decidedly a tertiary formation. In regard\r\nto the age of the gold of the Ural Mountains, in Russia, which, like that\r\nof California, is obtained chiefly from auriferous alluvium, we can merely\r\naffirm that it occurs in veins of quartz in the schistose and granitic\r\nrocks of that chain. Sir R. Murchison observes, that no gold has yet been\r\nfound in the Permian conglomerates which lie at the base of the Ural\r\nMountains, although large quantities of iron and copper detritus are mixed\r\nwith the rolled pebbles of these same Permian strata. Hence it seems that\r\nthe Uralian quartz veins, containing gold and platinum, were not exposed to\r\naqueous denudation during the Permian era. But we cannot feel sure, from\r\nany data yet before us, that such auriferous veins of quartz may not be as\r\nold as the tin lodes of Cornwall, in which, as well as the more ancient\r\ncopper lodes of Ireland, some gold has been detected. We are also unable at\r\npresent to assign to the gold veins of Brazil, Peru, or California, their\r\nrespective geological dates. But, although enough is known to show that\r\nOvid's line about the \"Age of Gold,\" \"Aurea prima sata est aetas,\" would, by\r\nno means, be an apt motto for a treatise on mining, it would be equally\r\nrash in the present state of our inquiries to affirm, as some have done,\r\nthat gold was the last-formed of metals.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked by M. de Beaumont, that lead and some other metals are\r\nfound in dikes of basalt and greenstone, as well as in mineral veins\r\nconnected with trap rocks, whereas tin is met with in granite and in veins\r\nassociated with the granitic series. If this rule hold true generally, the\r\ngeological position of tin in localities accessible to the miners will\r\nbelong, for the most part, to rocks older than those bearing lead. The tin\r\nveins will be of higher relative antiquity for the same reason that the\r\n\"underlying\" igneous formations or granites which are visible to man are\r\nolder, on the whole, than the overlying or trappean formations.\r\n\r\nIf different sets of fissures, originating simultaneously at different\r\nlevels in the earth's crust, and communicating, some of them, with\r\nvolcanic, others with heated plutonic masses, be filled with different\r\nmetals, it will follow that those formed farthest from the surface will\r\nusually require the longest time before they can be exposed superficially.\r\nIn order to bring them into view, or within reach of the miner, a greater\r\namount of upheaval and denudation must take place in proportion as they\r\nhave lain deeper when first formed. A considerable series of geological\r\nrevolutions must intervene before any part of the fissure, which has been\r\nfor ages in the proximity of the plutonic rocks, so as to receive the gases\r\ndischarged from it when it was cooling, can emerge into the atmosphere. But\r\nI need not enlarge on this subject, as the reader will remember what was\r\nsaid in the 30th, 34th, and 37th chapters, on the chronology of the\r\nvolcanic and hypogene formations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._--The theory of the origin of the hypogene rocks, at a\r\nvariety of successive periods, as expounded in two of the chapters just\r\ncited, and still more the doctrine that such rocks may be now in the daily\r\ncourse of formation, has made and still makes its way, but slowly, into\r\nfavour. The disinclination to embrace it has arisen partly from an inherent\r\nobscurity in the very nature of the evidence of plutonic action when\r\ndeveloped on a great scale, at particular periods. It has also sprung, in\r\nsome degree, from extrinsic considerations; many geologists having been\r\nunwilling to believe the doctrine of the transmutation of fossiliferous\r\ninto crystalline rocks, because they were desirous of finding proofs of a\r\nbeginning, and of tracing back the history of our terraqueous system to\r\ntimes anterior to the creation of organic beings. But if these expectations\r\nhave been disappointed, if we have found it impossible to assign a limit to\r\nthat time throughout which it has pleased an Omnipotent and Eternal Being\r\nto manifest his creative power, we have at least succeeded beyond all hope\r\nin carrying back our researches to times antecedent to the existence of\r\nman. We can prove that man had a beginning, and that, all the species now\r\ncontemporary with man, and many others which preceded, had also a\r\nbeginning, and that, consequently, the present state of the organic world\r\nhas not gone on from all eternity, as some philosophers have maintained.\r\n\r\nIt can be shown that the earth's surface has been remodelled again and\r\nagain; mountain chains have been raised or sunk; valleys formed, filled\r\nup, and then re-excavated; sea and land have changed places; yet\r\nthroughout all these revolutions, and the consequent alterations of\r\nlocal and general climate, animal and vegetable life has been sustained.\r\nThis has been accomplished without violation of the laws now governing\r\nthe organic creation, by which limits are assigned to the variability of\r\nspecies. The succession of living beings appears to have been continued\r\nnot by the transmutation of species, but by the introduction into the\r\nearth from time to time of new plants and animals, and each assemblage\r\nof new species must have been admirably fitted for the new states of the\r\nglobe as they arose, or they would not have increased and multiplied and\r\nendured for indefinite periods.[501-A]\r\n\r\nAstronomy had been unable to establish the plurality of habitable worlds\r\nthroughout space, however favourite a subject of conjecture and\r\nspeculation; but geology, although it cannot prove that other planets\r\nare peopled with appropriate races of living beings, has demonstrated\r\nthe truth of conclusions scarcely less wonderful,--the existence on our\r\nown planet of so many habitable surfaces, or worlds as they have been\r\ncalled, each distinct in time, and peopled with its peculiar races of\r\naquatic and terrestrial beings.\r\n\r\nThe proofs now accumulated of the close analogy between extinct and recent\r\nspecies are such as to leave no doubt on the mind that the same harmony of\r\nparts and beauty of contrivance which we admire in the living creation, has\r\nequally characterized the organic world at remote periods. Thus as we\r\nincrease our knowledge of the inexhaustible variety displayed in living\r\nnature, and admire the infinite wisdom and power which it displays, our\r\nadmiration is multiplied by the reflection, that it is only the last of a\r\ngreat series of pre-existing creations, of which we cannot estimate the\r\nnumber or limit in times past.[501-B]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[489-A] Principles, &c. chap. iv. 8th ed. p. 49.\r\n\r\n[491-A] Geol.

We are indebted for the publication of\r\nthe present valuable work to the liberality of the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland, whose warm and generous support of literature and art\r\ndeserves our grateful acknowledgments.\"\r\n\r\n                                                     _Literary Gazette._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LAVENGRO;\r\n           THE SCHOLAR--THE GIPSY--AND THE PRIEST.\r\n\r\n                  BY GEORGE BORROW, ESQ.\r\n\r\n  Author of \"The Bible in Spain,\" \"The Gipsies of Spain,\" &c. &c.\r\n           With a Portrait. 3 Vols. Post 8vo. 30_s._\r\n\r\n\"We trust our extracts have exhibited enough of one at least of the many\r\naspects of 'Lavengro' to convince the reader that neither is it a work to\r\nbe read cursorily, nor to be handled easily, by any of the silver-fork\r\nschool of critics. These volumes are indeed replete with life, with earnest\r\nsympathy for all genuine workers, with profound insight into the wants and\r\nwishes of the poor and uneducated, and a lofty disdain of the conventional\r\n'shams' and pretensions which fetter the spirits or impede the energies of\r\nmankind. Nor is a feeling for the beautiful less conspicuous in its pages.\r\nA quiet market-town, environed by green meadows or bosomed in tufted trees;\r\nan old mercantile and ecclesiastical city, with a history stretching from\r\nthe times of the Caesars to the times of George III.; the treeless plain,\r\nthe broad river, the holt, the dingle, the blacksmith's forge, are all in\r\ntheir turn sketched freely and vividly by Mr. Borrow's pencil. In his\r\nportraitures of ruder life he is unsurpassed; a dog-fight, a prize-fight,\r\nan ale-house kitchen, Greenwich Fair, a savage group of wandering tinkers,\r\nare delineated in words as Wilkie or Hogarth might have depicted them in\r\ncolours. We are embarrassed by the riches spread before us.\r\n\r\n\"We have not touched upon the gipsy scenes in 'Lavengro' because in any\r\nwork of Mr. Borrow's these will naturally be the first to draw the reader's\r\nattention. Neither have we aimed at abridging or forestalling any portions\r\nof a book which has a panoramic unity of its own, and of which scarcely a\r\npage is without its proper interest. If we have succeeded in persuading our\r\nreaders to regard Mr. Borrow as partly an historian and partly as a poet,\r\nas well as to look for more in his volumes than mere excitement or\r\namusement, our purpose is attained, and we may securely commend him to the\r\ngoodly company he will find therein. 'Lavengro,' however, is not concluded;\r\na fourth volume will explain and gather up much of what is now somewhat\r\nobscure and fragmentary, and impart a more definite character to the\r\nphilological and physiological hints comprised in those now before us.\r\nEnough, indeed, and more than enough, is written to prove that the author\r\npossesses, in no ordinary measure, 'the vision and the faculty divine' for\r\ndiscerning and discriminating what is noble in man and what is beautiful in\r\nnature. We trust Mr. Borrow will speedily bring forth the remaining acts of\r\nhis 'dream of adventure,' and with good heart and hope pursue his way\r\nrejoicing, regardless of the misconceptions or misrepresentations of\r\ncritics who judge through a mist of conventionalities, and who themselves,\r\nwhether travelled or untravelled, have not, like Lavengro, grappled with\r\nthe deeper thoughts and veracities of human life.\"--_Tait's Magazine._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n              ENGLAND IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY:\r\n\r\n              POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND INDUSTRIAL.\r\n\r\n                  BY WILLIAM JOHNSTON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                  2 Vols.

The incidents of that unfortunate invasion from first to last,\r\nfrom the landing of Charles (July 25th) in Borrodale, with the 'seven men\r\nof Moidart,' to the fatal battle of Culloden (16th April, 1746), are\r\nminutely and faithfully recorded; but we have no doubt the reader will be\r\nmost and mainly interested in the personal history and adventures of the\r\nPretender himself. The character of the Prince is admirably drawn, and\r\ngenerously vindicated from the calumnies heaped upon him by his adversaries\r\nafter his fall. It will perhaps surprise some to learn, that he was so\r\nilliterate as scarcely to be master of the most common elements of\r\neducation. 'His letters,' says Lord Mahon, 'which I have seen among the\r\nStuart papers, are written in a large, rude, rambling hand, like a\r\nschoolboy's. In spelling they are still more deficient.'
