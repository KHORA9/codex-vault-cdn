THE RESCUE-CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nAN APPEAL FOR AID\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Swift stepped from the door of the machine shop, where he was at\r\nwork making some adjustments to the motor of his airship, and\r\nglanced down the road. He saw a cloud of dust, which effectually\r\nconcealed whatever was causing it.\r\n\r\n\"Some one must be in a hurry this morning,\" the lad remarked, \"Looks\r\nlike a motor speeding along. MY! but we certainly do need rain,\" he\r\nadded, as he looked up toward the sky. \"It's very dusty. Well, I may\r\nas well get back to work. I'll take the airship out for a flight\r\nthis afternoon, if the wind dies down a bit.\"\r\n\r\nThe young inventor, for Tom Swift himself had built the airship, as\r\nwell as several other crafts for swift locomotion, turned to\r\nre-enter the shop.\r\n\r\nSomething about the approaching cloud of dust, however, held his\r\nattention. He glanced more intently at it.\r\n\r\n\"If it's an automobile coming along,\" he murmured, \"it's moving very\r\nslowly, to make so much fuss. And I never saw a motor-cycle that\r\nwould kick up as much sand, and not speed along more. It ought to be\r\nhere by now. I wonder what it can be?\"\r\n\r\nThe cloud of highway dirt rolled along, making some progress toward\r\nTom's house and the group of shops and other buildings surrounding\r\nit. But, as the lad had said, the dust did not move at all quickly\r\nin comparison to any of the speedy machines that might be causing\r\nit. And the cloud seemed momentarily to grow thicker and thicker.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if it could be a miniature tornado, or a cyclone or\r\nwhirlwind?\" and Tom spoke aloud, a habit of his when he was\r\nthinking, and had no one to talk to. \"Yet it can hardly be that.\" he\r\nwent on. \"Guess I'll watch and see what it is.\"\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer came the dust cloud. Tom peered anxiously ahead, a\r\npuzzled look on his face. A few seconds later there came from the\r\nmidst of the obscuring cloud a voice, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"G'lang there now, Boomerang! Keep to' feet a-movin' an' we sho'\r\nwill make a record. 'Tain't laik we was a autermobiler, er a\r\nelectricity car, but we sho' hab been goin' sence we started. Yo'\r\nsho' done yo'se'f proud t'day, Boomerang, an' I'se gwine t' keep mah\r\npromise an' gib yo' de bestest oats I kin find. Ah reckon Massa Tom\r\nSwift will done say we brought dis yeah message t' him as quick as\r\nanybody could.\"\r\n\r\nThen there followed the sound of hoofbeats on the dusty road, and\r\nthe rattle of some many-jointed vehicle, with loose springs and\r\nlooser wheels.\r\n\r\n\"Eradicate Sampson!\" exclaimed Tom. \"But who would ever think that\r\nthe colored man's mule could get up such speed as that cloud of dust\r\nindicates. His mule's feet must be working overtime, but he goes\r\nbackward about as often as he moves forward. That accounts for it.\r\nThere's lots of dust, but not much motion.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more, from the midst of the ball-like cloud of dirt came the\r\nvoice of the colored man:\r\n\r\n\"Now behave yo'se'f, Boomerang. We'm almost dere an' den yo' kin sit\r\ndown an' rest if yo' laik. Jest keep it up a little longer, an'\r\nwe'll gib Massa Tom his telephone. G'lang now, Boomerang.\"\r\n\r\nThe tattoo of hoofbeats was slowing up now, and the cloud of dust\r\nwas not so heavy. It was gradually blowing away. Tom Swift walked\r\ndown to the fence that separated the house, grounds and shops from\r\nthe road. As he got there the sounds of the mule's progress, and the\r\nrattle of the wagon, suddenly ceased.\r\n\r\n\"G'lang! G'lang! Don't yo' dare t' stop now, when we am most dere!\"\r\ncried Eradicate Sampson. \"Keep a-movin', Boomerang!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, Eradicate. I'm here,\" called Tom, and when the last\r\nof the dust had blown away, the lad waved his hand to an aged\r\ncolored man, who sat upon the seat of perhaps the most dilapidated\r\nwagon that was ever dignified by such a name. It was held together\r\nwith bits of wire, rope and strings, and each of the four wheels\r\nleaned out at a different angle. It was drawn by a big mule, whose\r\nbones seemed protruding through his skin, but that fact evidently\r\nworried him but little, for now the animal was placidly sleeping,\r\nwhile standing up, his long ears moving slowly to and fro.\r\n\r\n\"Am dat yo', Massa Tom?\" asked Eradicate, ceasing his task of\r\njerking on the lines, to which operation the mule paid not the least\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm here, Rad,\" replied Tom, smiling. \"I came out of my shop\r\nto see what all the excitement was about. How did you ever get your\r\nmule to make so much dust?\"\r\n\r\n\"I done promise him an extra helpin' ob oats ef he make good time,\"\r\nsaid the colored man. \"An' he done it, too. Did yo' see de dust we\r\nmade?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sure did, but you didn't do much else. And you didn't make very\r\ngood time. I watched you, and you came along like an ice wagon after\r\na day's work on the Fourth of July. You were going fast, but moving\r\nslow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I 'spects we was, Massa Tom,\" was the colored man's answer. \"But\r\nBoomerang done better dan I 'spected he would. I done tole him yo'd\r\nbe in a hurry t' git yo' telephone, an' he sho' did trot along.\"\r\n\r\n\"My telephone?\" repeated Tom, wonderingly. \"What have you and your\r\nmule Boomerang to do with my telephone? That's up in the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it ain't! it's right yeah in mah pocket,\" chuckled Eradicate,\r\nopening a ragged coat, and reaching for something. \"I got yo'\r\ntelephone right yeah.\" he went on. \"De agent at de station see me\r\ndribin' ober dis way, an' he done ast he t' deliber it. He said as\r\nhow he ain't got no messenger boy now, 'cause de one he done hab\r\nwent on a strike fo' five cents mo' a day. So I done took de\r\ntelephone,\" and with that the colored man pulled out a crumpled\r\nyellow envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you mean a telegram,\" said Tom, with a laugh, as he took the\r\nmessage from the odd colored man.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe it's telegraf, but I done understood de agent t' say\r\ntelephone. Anyhow, dere it is. An' I s'pects we'd better git along,\r\nBoomerang.\"\r\n\r\nThe mule never moved, though Eradicate yanked on the reins, and used\r\na splintered whip with energy.\r\n\r\n\"I said as how we'd better git along, Boomerang,\" went on the\r\ndarkey, raising his voice, \"Dinnah am mos' ready, an' I'm goin' t'\r\ngiv yo' an extra helpin' ob oats.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of these words seemed magical. The mule suddenly came to\r\nlife, and was about to start off.\r\n\r\n\"I done thought dat would cotch yo', Boomerang,\" chuckled Eradicate.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, Rad,\" called Tom, who was tearing open the envelope\r\nof the telegram. \"I might want to send an answer back by you. I\r\nwonder who is wiring me now?\"\r\n\r\nHe read the message slowly, and Eradicate remarked:\r\n\r\n\"'Taint no kind ob use, Massa Tom, fo' t' send a message back wif\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked the young inventor, looking up from the sheet of\r\nyellow paper.\r\n\r\n\"'Case as how I done promised Boomerang his airman, an' he won't do\r\nnothin' till he has it. Ef I started him back t' town now he would\r\njest lay down in de road. I'll take de answer back fo' you dis\r\narternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, perhaps that will do,\" assented Tom. \"I haven't quite\r\ngot the hang of this yet. Drop around this afternoon, Rad,\" and as\r\nthe colored man, who, with his mule Boomerang, did odd jobs around\r\nthe village, started off down the highway, in another cloud of dust,\r\nTom Swift resumed the reading of the message.\r\n\r\n\"Hum, this is rather queer,\" he mused, when having read it once, he\r\nbegan at it again. \"It must have cost him something to send all this\r\nover the wire. He could just as well have written it. So he wants my\r\nhelp, eh? Well, I never heard of him, and he may be all right, but I\r\nhad other plans, and I don't know whether I can spare the time to go\r\nto Philadelphia or not. I'll have to think it over. An electric\r\nairship, eh? He's sort of following along the lines of my\r\ninventions. Wants my aid--hum--well, I don't know--\"\r\n\r\nTom's musings were suddenly cut short by the approach of an elderly\r\ngentleman, who was walking slowly down the path that led from the\r\nhouse to the country highway which ran in front of it.\r\n\r\n\"A telegram, Tom?\" asked the newcomer.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dad,\" was the reply. \"I was just coming in to ask your advice\r\nabout it. Eradicate brought it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, with his mule, Boomerang?\" and the gentleman seemed much\r\namused. \"How did he ever get up speed enough to deliver a telegram?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Eradicate has some special means he uses on his mule when he's\r\nin a hurry. But listen to this message, dad. It's from a Mr. Hosmer\r\nFenwick, of Philadelphia. He says:\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tom Swift--Can you come on to Philadelphia at once and aid me in\r\nperfecting my new electric airship? I want to get it ready for a\r\nflight before some government experts who have promised to purchase\r\nseveral if it works well. I am in trouble, and I can't get it to\r\nrise off the ground. I need help. I have heard about your airship,\r\nand the other inventions you and your father have perfected, and I\r\nam sure you can aid me. I am stuck. Can you hurry to the Quaker\r\nCity? I will pay you well. Answer at once!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" remarked Mr. Swift, questioningly, as his son finished\r\nreading the telegram. \"What are you going to do about it, Tom?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't exactly know, dad. I was going to ask your advice. What\r\nwould you do? Who is this Mr. Fenwick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he is an inventor of some note, but he has had many failures.\r\nI have not heard of him in some years until now. He is a gentleman\r\nof wealth, and can be relied upon to do just as he says. We are\r\nslightly acquainted. Perhaps it would be well to aid him, if you can\r\nspare the time. Not that you need the money, but inventors should be\r\nmutually helpful. If you feel like going to Philadelphia, and aiding\r\nhim in getting his electric airship in shape, you have my\r\npermission.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Tom, doubtfully. \"I was just getting my\r\nmonoplane in shape for a little flight. It was nothing particular,\r\nthough. Dad, I think I WILL take a run to Philadelphia, and see if I\r\ncan help Mr. Fenwick. I'll wire him that I am coming, to-morrow or\r\nnext day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" assented Mr. Swift, and then he and his son went into\r\none of the shops, talking of a new invention which they were about\r\nto patent.\r\n\r\nTom little knew what a strange series of adventures were to follow\r\nhis decision to go to the Quaker City, nor the danger involved in\r\naiding Mr. Fenwick to operate his electric airship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMISS NESTOR'S NEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When do you think you will go to Philadelphia, Tom?\" asked Mr.\r\nSwift, a little later, as the aged inventor and his son were looking\r\nover some blueprints which Garret Jackson, an engineer employed by\r\nthem, had spread out on a table.\r\n\r\n\"I don't exactly know,\" was the answer. \"It's quite a little run\r\nfrom Shopton, because I can't get a through train. But I think I'll\r\nstart tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you go by train?\" asked Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"Why--er--because--\" was Tom's rather hesitating reply. \"How else\r\nwould I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your monoplane would be a good deal quicker, and you wouldn't have\r\nto change cars,\" said the engineer. \"That is if you don't want to\r\ntake out the big airship. Why don't you go in the monoplane?\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove! I believe I will!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I never thought of\r\nthat, though it's a wonder I didn't. I'll not take the RED CLOUD, as\r\nshe's too hard to handle alone. But the BUTTERFLY will be just the\r\nthing,\" and Tom looked over to where a new monoplane rested on the\r\nthree bicycle wheels which formed part of its landing frame. \"I\r\nhaven't had it out since I mended the left wing tip,\" he went on,\r\n\"and it will also be a good chance to test my new rudder. I believe\r\nI WILL go to Philadelphia by the BUTTERFLY.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as long as that's settled, suppose you give us your views on\r\nthis new form of storage battery,\" suggested Mr. Swift, with a fond\r\nglance at his son, for Tom's opinion was considered valuable in\r\nmatters electrical, as those of you, who have read the previous\r\nbooks in this series, well know.\r\n\r\nThe little group in the machine shop was soon deep in the discussion\r\nof ohms, amperes, volts and currents, and, for a time, Tom almost\r\nforgot the message calling him to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the momentary lull in the activities of the\r\nyoung inventor, I will tell my readers something about him, so that\r\nthose who have no previous introduction to him may feel that he is a\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nTom Swift lived with his father, Barton Swift, a widower, in the\r\nvillage of Shopton, New York. There was also in the household Mrs.\r\nBaggert, the aged housekeeper, who looked after Tom almost like a\r\nmother. Garret Jackson, an engineer and general helper, also lived\r\nwith the Swifts.\r\n\r\nEradicate Sampson might also be called a retainer of the family, for\r\nthough the aged colored man and his mule Boomerang did odd work\r\nabout the village, they were more often employed by Tom and his\r\nfather than by any one else. Eradicate was so called because, as he\r\nsaid, he \"eradicated\" the dirt. He did whitewashing, made gardens,\r\nand did anything else that was needed. Boomerang was thus named by\r\nhis owner, because, as Eradicate said, \"yo' nebber know jest what\r\ndat mule am goin' t' do next. He may go forward or he may go\r\nbackward, jest laik them Australian boomerangs.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another valued friend of the family, Wakefield Damon by\r\nname, to whom the reader will be introduced in due course. And then\r\nthere was Mary Nestor, about whom I prefer to let Tom tell you\r\nhimself, for he might be jealous if I talked too much about her.\r\n\r\nIn the first book of this series, called \"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle,\"\r\nthere was told how he became possessed of the machine, after\r\nit had nearly killed Mr. Damon, who was learning to ride it. Mr.\r\nDamon, who had a habit of \"blessing\" everything from his collar\r\nbutton to his shoe laces, did not \"bless\" the motor-cycle after it\r\ntried to climb a tree with him; and he sold it to Tom very cheaply.\r\nTom repaired it, invented some new attachments for it, and had a\r\nnumber of adventures on it. Not the least of these was trailing\r\nafter a gang of scoundrels who tried to get possession of a valuable\r\npatent model belonging to Mr. Swift.\r\n\r\nOur second book, called \"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat,\" related some\r\nexciting times following the acquisition by the young inventor of a\r\nspeedy craft which the thieves of the patent model had stolen. In\r\nthe boat Tom raced with Andy Foger, a town bully, and beat him. Tom\r\nalso took out on pleasure trips his chum, Ned Newton, who worked in\r\na Shopton bank, and the two had fine times together. Need I also say\r\nthat Mary Nestor also had trips in the motor-boat? Besides some other\r\nstirring adventures in his speedy craft Tom rescued, from a burning\r\nballoon that fell into the lake, the aeronaut, John Sharp. Later Mr.\r\nSharp and Tom built an airship, called the RED CLOUD, in which they\r\nhad some strenuous times.\r\n\r\nTheir adventures in this craft of the air form the basis for the\r\nthird book of the series, entitled \"Tom Swift and His Airship.\" In\r\nthe RED CLOUD, Tom and his friends, including Mr. Damon, started to\r\nmake a record flight. They left Shopton the night when the bank\r\nvault was blown open, and seventy-five thousand dollars stolen.\r\n\r\nBecause of evidence given by Andy Foger, and his father, suspicion\r\npointed to Tom and his friends as the robbers, and they were\r\npursued. But they turned the tables by capturing the real burglars,\r\nand defeating the mean plans of the Fogers.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with having mastered the air Tom and his father turned\r\ntheir attention to the water. Mr. Swift perfected a new type of\r\ncraft, and in the fourth book of the series, called \"Tom Swift and\r\nHis Submarine,\" you may read how he went after a sunken treasure.\r\nThe party had many adventures, and were in no little danger from\r\ntheir enemies before they reached the wreck with its store of gold.\r\n\r\nThe fifth book of the series, named \"Tom Swift and His Electrical\r\nRunabout,\" told how Tom built the speediest car on the road, and won\r\na prize with it, and also saved a bank from ruin.\r\n\r\nTom had to struggle against odds, not only in his inventive work,\r\nbut because of the meanness of jealous enemies, including Andy\r\nFoger, who seemed to bear our hero a grudge of long standing. Even\r\nthough Tom had, more than once, thrashed Andy well, the bully was\r\nalways seeking a chance to play some mean trick on the young\r\ninventor. Sometimes he succeeded, but more often the tables were\r\neffectually turned.\r\n\r\nIt was now some time since Tom had won the prize in his electric car\r\nand, in the meanwhile he had built himself a smaller airship, or,\r\nrather, monoplane, named the BUTTERFLY. In it he made several\r\nsuccessful trips about the country, and gave exhibitions at numerous\r\naviation meets; once winning a valuable prize for an altitude\r\nflight. In one trip he had met with a slight accident, and the\r\nmonoplane had only just been repaired after this when he received\r\nthe message summoning him to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Tom,\" remarked his father that afternoon, \"if you are going\r\nto the Quaker City, to see Mr. Fenwick to-morrow, you'd better be\r\ngetting ready. Have you wired him that you will come?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't, dad,\" was the reply. \"I'll get a message ready at\r\nonce, and when Eradicate comes back I'll have him take it to the\r\ntelegraph office.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't do that, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust it to Eradicate. He means all right, but there's no telling\r\nwhen that mule of his may lie down in the road, and go to sleep.\r\nThen your message won't get off, and Mr. Fenwick may be anxiously\r\nwaiting for it. I wouldn't like to offend him, for, though he and I\r\nhave not met in some years, yet I would be glad if you could do him\r\na favor. Why not take the message yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess I will, dad. I'll run over to Mansburg in my electric car,\r\nand send the message from there. It will go quicker, and, besides, I\r\nwant to get some piano wire to strengthen the wings of my\r\nmonoplane.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Tom, and when you telegraph to Mr. Fenwick, give him my\r\nregards, and say that I hope his airship will be a success. So it's\r\nan electric one, eh? I wonder how it works? But you can tell me when\r\nyou come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, dad. Mr. Jackson, will you help me charge the batteries of\r\nmy car? I think they need replenishing. Then I'll get right along to\r\nMansburg.\"\r\n\r\nMansburg was a good-sized city some miles from the village of\r\nShopton, and Tom and his father had frequent business there.\r\n\r\nThe young inventor and the engineer soon had the electric car in\r\nreadiness for a swift run, for the charging of the batteries could\r\nbe done in much less than the time usual for such an operation,\r\nowing to a new system perfected by Tom. The latter was soon speeding\r\nalong the road, wondering what sort of an airship Mr. Fenwick would\r\nprove to have, and whether or not it could be made to fly.\r\n\r\n\"It's easy enough to build an airship,\" mused Tom, \"but the\r\ndifficulty is to get them off the ground, and keep them there.\" He\r\nknew, for there had been several failures with his monoplane before\r\nit rose like a bird and sailed over the tree-tops.\r\n\r\nThe lad was just entering the town, and had turned around a corner,\r\ntwisting about to pass a milk wagon, when he suddenly saw, darting\r\nout directly in the path of his car, a young lady.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" yelled Tom, ringing his electric gong, at the same time\r\nshutting off the current, and jamming on the powerful brakes.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary scream of terror from the girl, and then, as\r\nshe looked at Tom, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Why, Tom Swift! What are you trying to do? Run me down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary--Miss Nestor!\" ejaculated our hero, in some confusion.\r\n\r\nHe had brought his car to a stop, and had thrown open the door,\r\nalighting on the crossing, while a little knot of curious people\r\ngathered about.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't see you,\" went on the lad. \"I came from behind the milk\r\nwagon, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"It was my fault,\" Miss Nestor hastened to add. \"I, too, was waiting\r\nfor the milk wagon to pass, and when it got out of my way, I darted\r\naround the end of it, without looking to see if anything else was\r\ncoming. I should have been more careful, but I'm so excited that I\r\nhardly know what I'm doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excited? What's the matter?\" asked Tom, for he saw that his friend\r\nwas not her usual calm self. \"Has anything happened, Mary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've such news to tell you!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Then get in here, and we'll go on.\" advised Tom. \"We are collecting\r\na crowd. Come and take a ride; that is if you have time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I have,\" the girl said, with a little blush, which Tom\r\nthought made her look all the prettier. \"Then we can talk. But where\r\nare you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To send a message to a gentleman in Philadelphia, saying that I\r\nwill help him out of some difficulties with his new electric\r\nairship. I'm going to take a run down there in my monoplane,\r\nBUTTERFLY, to-morrow, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"My! to hear you tell it, one would think it wasn't any more to make\r\nan airship flight than it was to go shopping,\" interrupted Mary, as\r\nshe entered the electric car, followed by Tom, who quickly sent the\r\nvehicle down the street.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm getting used to the upper air,\" he said. \"But what is the\r\nnews you were to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know mamma and papa had gone to the West Indies?\" asked the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"No! I should say that WAS news. When did they go? I didn't know\r\nthey intended to make a trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither did they; nor I, either. It was very sudden. They sailed\r\nfrom New York yesterday. Mr. George Hosbrook, a business friend of\r\npapa's, offered to take them on his steam yacht, RESOLUTE. He is\r\nmaking a little pleasure trip, with a party of friends, and he\r\nthought papa and mamma might like to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wired to them, they got ready in a rush, caught the express to\r\nNew York, and went off in such a hurry that I can hardly realize it\r\nyet. I'm left all alone, and I'm in such trouble!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I should say that was news,\" spoke Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you haven't heard the worst yet,\" went on Mary. \"I don't call\r\nthe fact that papa and mamma went off so suddenly much news. But the\r\ncook just left unexpectedly, and I have invited a lot of girl\r\nfriends to come and stay with me, while mamma and papa are away; and\r\nnow what shall I do without a cook? I was on my way down to an\r\nintelligence office, to get another servant, when you nearly ran me\r\ndown! Now, isn't that news?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say it was--two kinds,\" admitted Tom, with a smile. \"Well,\r\nI'll help you all I can. I'll take you to the intelligence office,\r\nand if you can get a cook, by hook or by crook, I'll bundle her into\r\nthis car, and get her to your house before she can change her mind.\r\nAnd so your people have gone to the West Indies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I wish I had the chance to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" spoke Tom, little realizing how soon his wish might be\r\ngranted. \"But is there any particular intelligence office you wish\r\nto visit?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's not much choice,\" replied Mary Nestor, with a smile, \"as\r\nthere's only one in town. Oh. I do hope I can get a cook! It would\r\nbe dreadful to have nothing to eat, after I'd asked the girls to\r\nspend a month with me; wouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\nTom agreed that it certainly would, and they soon after arrived at\r\nthe intelligence office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTOM KNOCKS OUT ANDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you want me to come in and help you?\" asked the young inventor,\r\nof Miss Nestor.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything about hiring a cook?\" she inquired, with an\r\narch smile.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't,\" the lad was obliged to confess.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm a little doubtful of your ability to help me. But I'm ever\r\nso much obliged to you. I'll see if I can engage one. The cook who\r\njust left went away because I asked her to make some apple\r\nturnovers. Some of the girls who are coming are very fond of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I,\" spoke Tom, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Are you, indeed? Then, if the cook I hope to get now will make\r\nthem, I'll invite you over to have some, and--also meet my friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather come when just you, and the turnovers and the cook are\r\nthere,\" declared Tom, boldly, and Mary, with a blush, made ready to\r\nleave the electric car.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"If I can't help you select a cook,\" went on Tom, \"at least let me\r\ncall and take you home when you have engaged one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it will be too much trouble,\" protested Miss Nestor.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I have only to send a message, and get some piano wire,\r\nand then I'll call back here for you. I'll take you and the new cook\r\nback home flying.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, but don't fly so fast. The cook may get frightened, and\r\nleave before she has a chance to make an apple turnover.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go slower. I'll be back in fifteen minutes,\" called Tom, as he\r\nswung the car out away from the curb, while Mary Nestor went into\r\nthe intelligence office.\r\n\r\nTom wrote and sent this message to Mr. Hostner Fenwick, of\r\nPhiladelphia:\r\n\r\n\"Will come on to-morrow in my aeroplane, and aid you all I can. Will\r\nnot promise to make your electric airship fly, though. Father sends\r\nregards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just rush that, please,\" he said to the telegraph agent, and the\r\nlatter, after reading it over, remarked:\r\n\r\n\"It'll rush itself, I reckon, being all about airships, and things\r\nlike that,\" and he laughed as Tom paid him.\r\n\r\nSelecting several sizes of piano wire of great strength, to use as\r\nextra guy-braces on the Butterfly, Tom re-entered his electric car,\r\nand hastened back to the intelligence office, where he had left his\r\nfriend. He saw her standing at the front door, and before he could\r\nalight, and go to her, Miss Nestor came out to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom!\" she exclaimed, with a little tragic gesture, \"what do you\r\nthink?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he answered good-naturedly. \"Does the new cook\r\nrefuse to come unless you do away with apple turnovers?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't that. I have engaged a real treasure, I'm sure, but as\r\nsoon as I mentioned that you would take us home in the electric\r\nautomobile, she flatly refused to come. She said walking was the\r\nonly way she would go. She hasn't been in this country long. But the\r\nworst of it is that a rich woman has just telephoned in for a cook,\r\nand if I don't get this one away, the rich lady may induce her to\r\ncome to her house, and I'll be without one! Oh, what shall I do?\"\r\nand poor Mary looked quite distressed.\r\n\r\n\"Humph! So she's afraid of electric autos; eh?\" mused Tom. \"That's\r\nqueer. Leave it to me, Mary, and perhaps I can fix it. You want to\r\nget her away from here in a hurry; don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, because servants are so scarce, that they are engaged almost\r\nas soon as they register at the intelligence office. I know the one\r\nI have hired is suspicious of me, since I have mentioned your car,\r\nand she'll surely go with Mrs. Duy Puyster when she comes. I'm sorry\r\nI spoke of the automobile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't worry. It's partly my fault, and perhaps I can make\r\namends. I'll talk to the new cook,\" decided the young inventor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom, I don't believe it will do any good. She won't come, and\r\nall my girl friends will arrive shortly.\" Miss Nestor was quite\r\ndistressed.\r\n\r\n\"Leave it to me,\" suggested the lad, with an assumed confidence he\r\ndid not feel. He left the car, and walked toward the office.\r\nEntering it, with Miss Nestor in his wake, he saw a pleasant-faced\r\nIrish girl, sitting on a bench, with a bundle beside her.\r\n\r\n\"And so you don't want to ride in an auto?\" began Tom.\r\n\r\n\"No, an' it's no use of the likes of you askin' me, either,\"\r\nanswered the girl, but not impudently. \"I am afeered of thim things,\r\nan' I won't work in a family that owns one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we don't own one,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\nThe girl only sniffed.\r\n\r\n\"It is the very latest means of traveling,\" Tom went on, \"and there\r\nis absolutely no danger. I will drive slowly.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" snapped the new cook.\r\n\r\nTom was rather at his wits' ends. At that moment the telephone rang,\r\nand Tom and Mary, listening, could hear the proprietress of the\r\nintelligence office talking to Mrs. Duy Puyster over the wire.\r\n\r\n\"We must get her away soon,\" whispered Mary, with a nod at the Irish\r\ngirl, \"or we'll lose her.\"\r\n\r\nTom was thinking rapidly, but no plan seemed to come to him. A\r\nmoment later one of the assistants of the office led out from a rear\r\nroom another Irish girl,--who, it seems, had just engaged herself to\r\nwork in the country.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Bridget,\" said this girl, to the one Mary Nestor had\r\nhired. \"I'm off now. The carriage has just come for me. I'm goin'\r\naway in style.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good luck, Sarah,\" wished Bridget.\r\n\r\nTom looked out of the window. A dilapidated farm wagon, drawn by two\r\nrusty-looking horses, just drawing up at the curb.\r\n\r\n\"There is your employer, Sarah,\" said the proprietress of the\r\noffice. \"You will have a nice ride to the country and I hope you\r\nwill like the place.\"\r\n\r\nA typical country farmer alighted from the wagon, leaving a woman,\r\nevidently his wife, or the seat. He called out:\r\n\r\n\"I'll git th' servant-gal, 'Mandy, an' we'll drive right out hum.\r\nThen you won't have such hard work any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' so that's the style you was tellin' me of; eh, Sarah?\" asked\r\nthe cook whom Miss Nestor had engaged. \"That's queer style, Sarah.\"\r\n\r\nSarah was blushing from shame and mortification. Tom was quick to\r\nseize the advantage thus offered.\r\n\r\n\"Bridget, if YOU appreciate style,\" he said, \"you will come in the\r\nautomobile. I have one of the very latest models, and it is very\r\nsafe. But perhaps you prefer a farm wagon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indade an' I don't!\" was the ready response. \"I'll go wid you now\r\nif only to show Sarah Malloy thot I have more style than her! She\r\nwas boastin' of the fine place she had, an' th' illigant carriage\r\nthat was comin' t' take her to the counthry. If that's it I want\r\nnone of it! I'll go wid you an' th' young gintleman. Style indade!\"\r\nand, gathering up her bundle she followed Tom and Mary to the\r\nwaiting auto.\r\n\r\nThey entered it and started off, just as Mrs. Duy Puyster drove up\r\nin her elegantly appointed carriage, while Sarah, with tears of\r\nmortification in her eyes, climbed up beside the farmer and his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\"You saved the day for me, Tom,\" whispered Miss Nestor, as the young\r\ninventor increased the speed of his car. \"It was only just in time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't forget the apple turnovers,\" he whispered back.\r\n\r\nOnce she had made the plunge, the new cook seemed to lose her fears\r\nof the auto, and enjoyed the ride. In a short time she had been\r\nsafely delivered at Miss Nestor's home, while that young lady\r\nrepeated her thanks to Tom, and renewed her invitation for him to\r\ncome and sample the apple turnovers, which Tom promised faithfully\r\nto do, saying he would call on his return from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMusing on the amusing feature of his trip, Tom was urging his auto\r\nalong at moderate speed, when, as he turned down a country road,\r\nleading to his home, he saw, coming toward him, a carriage, drawn by\r\na slow-moving, white horse, and containing a solitary figure.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that looks like Andy Foger,\" spoke Tom, half aloud. \"I wonder\r\nwhat he's doing out driving? His auto must be out of commission. But\r\nthat's not strange, considering the way he abuses the machine. It's\r\nin the repair shop half the time.\"\r\n\r\nHe slowed down still more, for he did not know but that Andy's horse\r\nmight be skittish. He need have no fears, however, for the animal\r\ndid not seem to have much more life than did Eradicate's mule,\r\nBoomerang.\r\n\r\nAs Tom came nearer the carriage, he was surprised to see Andy\r\ndeliberately swing his horse across the road, blocking the highway\r\nby means of the carriage and steed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Andy Foger, what does that mean?\" cried Tom, indignantly, as\r\nhe brought his car to a sudden stop. \"Why do you block the road?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I want to,\" snarled the bully, taking out a notebook and\r\npencil, and pretending to make some notes about the property in\r\nfront of which he had halted. \"I'm in the real estate business now,\"\r\nwent on Andy, \"and I'm getting descriptions of the property I'm\r\ngoing to sell. Guess I've got a right to stop in the road if I want\r\nto!\"\r\n\r\n\"But not to block it up,\" retorted Tom. \"That's against the law.\r\nPull over and let me pass!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I don't do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll make you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh! I'd like to see you try it!\" snapped Andy. \"If you make\r\ntrouble for me, it will be the worse for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you pull to one side, so I can pass, there'll be no trouble,\"\r\nsaid Tom, seeing that Andy wished to pick a quarrel.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to pull aside until I finish putting down this\r\ndescription,\" and the bully continued to write with tantalizing\r\nslowness.\r\n\r\n\"Look here!\" exclaimed Tom Swift, with sudden energy. \"I'm not going\r\nto stand for this! Either you pull to one side and let me pass, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what will you do?\" demanded the bully.\r\n\r\n\"I'll shove you to one side, and you can take the consequences!\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't dare to!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't, eh? Just you watch.\"\r\n\r\nTom threw forward the lever of his car. There was a hum of the\r\nmotor, and the electric moved ahead. Andy had continued to write in\r\nthe book, but at this sound he glanced up.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you dare to bunk into me!\" yelled Andy. \"If you do I'll sue\r\nyou for damages!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out of the way, or I'll shove you off the road!\" threatened\r\nTom, calmly.\r\n\r\n\"I'll not go until I get ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes you will,\" responded our hero quietly. He sent his car\r\nahead slowly but surely. It was within a few feet of the carriage\r\ncontaining Andy. The bully had dropped his notebook, and was shaking\r\nhis fist at Tom.\r\n\r\nAs for the young inventor he had his plans made. He saw that the\r\nhorse was a quiet, sleepy one, that would not run away, no matter\r\nwhat happened, and Tom only intended to gently push the carriage to\r\none side, and pass on.\r\n\r\nThe front of his auto came up against the other vehicle.\r\n\r\n\"Here, you stop!\" cried Andy, savagely.\r\n\r\n\"It's too late now,\" answered Tom, grimly.\r\n\r\nAndy reached for the horsewhip. Tom put on a little more power, and\r\nthe carriage began to slide across the road, but the old horse never\r\nopened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Take that!\" cried Andy, raising his whip, with the intention of\r\nslashing Tom across the face, for the front of the auto was open.\r\nBut the blow never fell, for, the next instant, the carriage gave a\r\nlurch as one of the wheels slid against a stone, and, as Andy was\r\nstanding up, and leaning forward, he was pitched head first out into\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove! I hope I haven't hurt him!\" gasped Tom, as he leaped from\r\nhis auto, which he had brought to a stop.\r\n\r\nThe young inventor bent over the bully. There was a little cut on\r\nAndy's forehead, and his face was white. He had been most\r\neffectually knocked out entirely by his own meanness and fault, but,\r\nnone the less, Tom was frightened. He raised up Andy's head on his\r\narm, and brushed back his hair. Andy was unconscious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMR. DAMON WILL GO ALONG\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first Tom was greatly frightened at the sight of Andy's pale\r\nface. He feared lest the bully might be seriously hurt. But when he\r\nrealized that the fall from the carriage, which was a low one, was\r\nnot hard, and that Andy had landed on his outstretched hands before\r\nhis head came in contact with the earth, our hero was somewhat\r\nreassured.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had some water, with which to bathe his head,\" Tom\r\nmurmured, and he looked about in vain for some. But it was not\r\nneeded, for, a moment later, Andy opened his eyes, and, when he saw\r\nTom bending over, and holding him, the bully exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Here! You let me go! Don't you hit me again, Tom Swift, or I'll\r\npunch you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't hit you,\" declared Tom, while Andy tore himself away, and\r\nstruggled to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you did, too, hit me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not! You tried to strike me with your whip, as I was shoving\r\nyour carriage out of the way, which I had a perfect right to do, as\r\nyou were blockading the highway. You lost your balance and fell. It\r\nwas your own fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you'll suffer for it, just the same, snarled Andy, and then,\r\nputting his hand to his head, and bringing it away, with some drops\r\nof blood on it, he cried out:\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm hurt! I'm injured! Get a doctor, or maybe I'll bleed to\r\ndeath!\" He began blubbering, for Andy, like all bullies, was a\r\ncoward.\r\n\r\n\"You're not hurt,\" asserted Tom, trying not to laugh. \"It's only a\r\nscratch. Next time don't try to blockade the whole street, and you\r\nwon't get into trouble. Are you able to drive home; or shall I take\r\nyou in my car?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't ride in your car!\" snapped the ugly lad. \"You go on, and\r\nmind your business now, and I'll pay you back for this, some day. I\r\ncould have you arrested!\"\r\n\r\n\"And so could I have you locked up for obstructing traffic. But I'll\r\nnot. Your rig isn't damaged, and you'd better drive home.\"\r\n\r\nThe old white horse had not moved, and was evidently glad of the\r\nrest. A glance satisfied Tom that the carriage had not been damaged,\r\nand, getting into his car, while Andy was brushing the dust from his\r\nclothes, our hero started the motor.\r\n\r\nThere was now room enough to pass around the obstructing carriage,\r\nand soon Tom was humming down the road, leaving a much discomfited\r\nbully behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Tom Swift is too smart--thinking he can run everybody, and\r\neverything, to suit himself,\" growled Andy, as he finished dusting\r\noff his clothes, and wiping the blood from his face. As Tom had\r\nsaid, the wound was but a scratch, though the bully's head ached,\r\nand he felt a little dizzy. \"I wish I'd hit him with the horsewhip,\"\r\nhe went on, vindictively. \"I'll get square with him some day.\"\r\n\r\nAndy had said this many times, but he had never yet succeeded in\r\npermanently getting the best of Tom. Pondering on some scheme of\r\nrevenge the rich lad--for Mr. Foger, his father, was quite\r\nwealthy--drove on.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tom, rather wishing the little encounter had not taken\r\nplace, but refusing to blame himself for what had occurred, was\r\nspeeding toward home.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see,\" he murmured, as he drove along in his powerful car.\r\n\"I've got quite a lot to do if I make an early start for\r\nPhiladelphia, in my airship, to-morrow. I want to tighten the\r\npropeller on the shaft a trifle, and give the engine a good try-out.\r\nThen, too, I think I'd better make the landing springs a little\r\nstiffer. The last time I made a descent the frame was pretty well\r\njarred up. Yes, if I make that air trip to-morrow I'll have to do\r\nsome tall hustling when I get home.\"\r\n\r\nThe electric runabout swung into the yard of the Swift house, and\r\nTom brought it to a stop opposite the side door. He looked about for\r\na sight of his father, Mrs. Baggert or Garret Jackson. The only\r\nperson visible was Eradicate Sampson, working in the garden.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Rad,\" called Tom. \"Anybody home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yais, Massa Tom,\" answered the colored man. \"Yo' dad an' anodder\r\ngen'mans hab jest gone in de house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's the other gentleman, Rad?\" asked Tom, and the negro, glad of\r\nan excuse to cease the weeding of the onion bed, came shuffling\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\"It's de gen'mans what is allers saying his prayers,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Saying his prayers?\" repeated Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yep. Yo' knows what I means, Massa Tom. He's allers askin' a\r\nblessin' on his shoes, or his rubbers, or his necktie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you mean Mr. Wakefield Damon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yais, sah, dat's who I done means. Mr. Wakefull Lemon--dat's sho'\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment there sounded, within the house, the voices of Mr.\r\nSwift, and some one else in conversation.\r\n\r\n\"And so Tom has decided to make a run to the Quaker City in the\r\nBUTTERFLY, to-morrow,\" Mr. Swift was saying, \"and he's going to see\r\nif he can be of any service to this Mr. Fenwick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my watch chain!\" exclaimed the other voice. \"You don't say\r\nso! Why I know Mr. Fenwick very well--he and I used to go to school\r\ntogether, but bless my multiplication tables--I never thought he'd\r\namount to anything! And so he's built an airship; and Tom is going\r\nto help him with it? Why, bless my collar button, I've a good notion\r\nto go along and see what happens. Bless my very existence, but I\r\nthink I will!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's Mr. Damon all right,\" observed Tom, with a smile, as he\r\nadvanced toward the dining-room, whence the voices proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"Dat's what I done tole you!\" said Eradicate, and, with slow and\r\nlagging steps he went back to weed the onion bed.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Mr. Damon,\" called our hero, as he mounted the steps\r\nof the porch.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Tom--he's back!\" exclaimed the eccentric man. \"Why, bless\r\nmy shoe laces, Tom! how are you? I'm real glad to see you. Bless my\r\neyeglasses, but I am! I just returned from a little western trip,\r\nand I thought I'd rUn over and see how you are. I came in my car--had\r\ntwo blowouts on the way, too. Bless my spark plug, but the kind\r\nof tires one gets now-a-days are a disgrace! However, I'm here, and\r\nyour father has just told me about you going to Philadelphia in your\r\nmonoplane, to help a fellow-inventor with his airship. It's real\r\nkind of you. Bless my topknot if it isn't! Do you know what I was\r\njust saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard you mention that you knew Mr. Fenwick,\" replied Tom, with a\r\nsmile, as he shook hands with Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"So I do, and, what's more, I'd like to see his airship. Will your\r\nBUTTERFLY carry two passengers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easily, Mr. Damon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll tell you what I'm going to do. If you'll let me I'll take\r\nthat run to Philadelphia with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad to have you come along,\" responded Tom, heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll go, and, what's more, if Fenwick's ship will rise, I'll\r\ngo with you in that--bless my deflection rudder if I don't, Tom!\"\r\nand puffing up his cheeks, as he exploded these words, Mr. Damon\r\nfairly raised himself on his tiptoes, and shook Tom's hand again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nVOL-PLANING TO EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment after Mr. Damon's announcement Tom did not reply. Mr.\r\nSwift, too, seemed a little at a loss for something to say. They did\r\nnot quite know how to take their eccentric friend at times.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I'll be glad of your company, Mr. Damon,\" said Tom: \"but\r\nyou must remember that my BUTTERFLY is not like the RED CLOUD. There\r\nis more danger riding in the monoplane than there is in the airship.\r\nIn the latter, if the engine happens to stop, the sustaining gas\r\nwill prevent us from falling. But it isn't so in an aeroplane. When\r\nyour engine stops there--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what happens?\" asked Mr. Damon, impatiently, for Tom\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\"You have to vol-plane back to earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vol-plane?\" and there was a questioning note in Mr. Damon's voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, glide down from whatever height you are at when the engine\r\nstalls. Come down in a series of dips from the upper currents.\r\nVol-planing, the French call it, and I guess it's as good a word as\r\nany.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever done it?\" asked the odd character.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, several times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, bless my fur overcoat! I can do it, too, Tom. When will you\r\nbe ready to start?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow morning. Now you are sure you won't get nervous and want\r\nto jump, if the engine happens to break down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it. I'll vol-plane whenever you are ready,\" and Mr.\r\nDamon laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll hope we won't have to,\" went on Tom. \"And I'll be very\r\nglad of your company. Mr. Fenwick will, no doubt, be pleased to see\r\nyou. I've never met him, and it will be nice to have some one to\r\nintroduce me. Suppose you come out and see what sort of a craft you\r\nare doomed to travel in to-morrow, Mr. Damon. I believe you never\r\nsaw my new monoplane.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, I haven't, but I'd be glad to. I declare, I'm getting\r\nto be quite an aviator,\" and Mr. Damon chuckled. A little later,\r\nTom, having informed his father of the sending of the message, took\r\nhis eccentric friend out to the shop, and exhibited the BUTTERFLY.\r\n\r\nAs many of you have seen the ordinary monoplane, either on\r\nexhibition or in flight, I will not take much space to describe\r\nTom's. Sufficient to say it was modeled after the one in which\r\nBleriot made his first flight across the English channel.\r\n\r\nThe body was not unlike that of a butterfly or dragon fly, long and\r\nslender, consisting of a rectangular frame with canvas stretched\r\nover it, and a seat for two just aft of the engine and controlling\r\nlevers. Back of the seat stretched out a long framework, and at the\r\nend was a curved plane, set at right angles to it. The ends of the\r\nplane terminated in flexible wings, to permit of their being bent up\r\nor down, so as to preserve the horizontal equilibrium of the craft.\r\n\r\nAt the extreme end was the vertical rudder, which sent the monoplane\r\nto left or right.\r\n\r\nForward, almost exactly like the front set of wings of the dragon\r\nfly, was the large, main plane, with the concave turn toward the\r\nground. There was the usual propeller in front, operated by a four\r\ncylinder motor, the cylinders being air cooled, and set like the\r\nspokes of a wheel around the motor box. The big gasolene tank, and\r\nother mechanism was in front of the right-hand operator's seat,\r\nwhere Tom always rode. He had seldom taken a passenger up with him,\r\nthough the machine would easily carry two, and he was a little\r\nnervous about the outcome of the trip with Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"How do you like the looks of it?\" asked the young inventor, as he\r\nwheeled the BUTTERFLY out of the shed, and began pumping up the\r\ntires of the bicycle wheels on which it ran over the ground, to get\r\nimpetus enough with which to rise.\r\n\r\n\"It looks a little frail, compared to the big RED CLOUD, Tom,\"\r\nanswered the eccentric man, \"but I'm going up in her just the same;\r\nbless my buttons if I'm not.\"\r\n\r\nTom could not but admire the grit of his friend.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was busily spent making various adjustments to\r\nthe monoplane, putting on new wire stays, changing the rudder\r\ncables, and tuning up the motor. The propeller was tightened on the\r\nshaft, and toward evening Tom announced that all was in readiness\r\nfor a trial flight.\r\n\r\n\"Want to come, Mr. Damon?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'll wait, and see how it acts with you aboard,\" was the answer.\r\n\"Not that I'm afraid, for I'm going to make the trip in the morning,\r\nbut perhaps it won't work just right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I guess it will,\" ventured Tom, and in order to be able to know\r\njust how his BUTTERFLY was going to behave, with a passenger of Mr.\r\nDamon's weight, the young inventor placed a bag of sand on the extra\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThe monoplane was then wheeled to the end of the starting ground.\r\nTom took his place in the seat, and Mr. Jackson started the\r\npropeller. At first the engine failed to respond, but suddenly with\r\na burst of smoke, and a spluttering of fire the cylinders began\r\nexploding. The hat of Mr. Damon, who was standing back of the\r\nmachine, was blown off by the wind created by the propeller.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my gaiters!\" he exclaimed, \"I never thought it was as strong\r\nas that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let go!\" cried Tom to Mr. Jackson and Eradicate, who were holding\r\nback the monoplane from gliding over the ground.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered the engineer.\r\n\r\nAn instant later the explosions almost doubled, for Tom turned on\r\nmore gasolene. Then, like some live thing, the BUTTERFLY rushed\r\nacross the starting ground. Faster and faster it went, until the\r\nyoung inventor, knowing that he had motion enough, tilted his planes\r\nto catch the wind.\r\n\r\nUp he went from earth, like some graceful bird, higher and higher,\r\nand then, in a big spiral, he began ascending until he was five\r\nhundred feet in the air. Up there he traveled back and forth, in\r\ncircles, and in figure eights, desiring to test the machine in\r\nvarious capacities.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the engine stopped, and to those below, anxiously watching,\r\nthe silence became almost oppressive, for Tom had somewhat\r\ndescended, and the explosions had been plainly heard by those\r\nobserving him. But now they ceased!\r\n\r\n\"His engine's stalled!\" cried Garret Jackson.\r\n\r\nMr. Swift heard the words, and looked anxiously up at his son.\r\n\r\n\"Is he in any danger?\" gasped Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\nNo one answered him. Like some great bird, disabled in mid flight,\r\nthe monoplane swooped downward. A moment later a hearty shout from\r\nTom reassured them.\r\n\r\n\"He shut off the engine on purpose,\" said Mr. Jackson. \"He is\r\nvol-planing back to earth!\"\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer came the BUTTERFLY. It would shoot downward, and\r\nthen, as Tom tilted the planes, would rise a bit, losing some of the\r\ngreat momentum. In a series of maneuvers like this, the young\r\ninventor reached the earth, not far from where his father and the\r\nothers stood. Down came the BUTTERFLY, the springs of the wheel\r\nframe taking the shock wonderfully well.\r\n\r\n\"She's all right--regular bird!\" cried Tom, in enthusiasm, when the\r\nmachine had come to a stop after rolling over the ground, and he had\r\nleaped out. \"We'll make a good flight to-morrow, Mr. Damon, if the\r\nweather holds out this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried the eccentric man. \"I shall be delighted.\"\r\n\r\nThey made the start early the next morning, there being hardly a\r\nbreath of wind. There was not a trace of nervousness noticeable\r\nabout Mr. Damon, as he took his place in the seat beside Tom. The\r\nlad had gone carefully over the entire apparatus, and had seen to it\r\nthat, as far as he could tell, it was in perfect running order.\r\n\r\n\"When will you be back, Tom?\" asked his father.\r\n\r\n\"To-night, perhaps, or to-morrow morning. I don't know just what Mr.\r\nFenwick wants me to do. But if it is anything that requires a long\r\nstay, I'll come back, and let you know, and then run down to\r\nPhiladelphia again. I may need some of my special tools to work\r\nwith. I'll be back to-night perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I keep supper for you?\" asked Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Tom, with a laugh. \"Perhaps I'll drop down\r\nat Miss Nestor's, and have some apple turnovers,\" for he had told\r\nthem or the incident of hiring the new cook. \"Well,\" he went on to\r\nMr. Damon, \"are you all ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"As ready as I ever shall be. Do you think we'll have to do any\r\nvol-planing, Tom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hard to say, but it's not dangerous when there's no wind. All\r\nright, Garret. Start her off.\"\r\n\r\nThe engineer whirled the big wooden, built-up propeller, and with a\r\nrattle and roar of the motor, effectually drowning any but the\r\nloudest shouts, the BUTTERFLY was ready for her flight. Tom let the\r\nengine warm up a bit before calling to his friends to let go, and\r\nthen, when he had thrown the gasolene lever forward, he shouted a\r\ngood-by and cried:\r\n\r\n\"All right! Let go!\"\r\n\r\nForward, like a hound from the leash, sprang the little monoplane.\r\nIt ran perhaps for five hundred feet, and then, with a tilting of\r\nthe wings, to set the air currents against them, it sprang into the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\"We're off!\" cried Mr. Damon, waving his hand to those on the ground\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we're off,\" murmured Tom. \"Now for the Quaker City!\"\r\n\r\nHe had mapped out a route for himself the night before, and now,\r\npicking out the land-marks, he laid as straight a course as possible\r\nfor Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of flying along, two thousand feet high, in a machine\r\nalmost as frail as a canoe, was not new to Tom. It was, in a degree,\r\nto Mr. Damon, for, though the latter had made frequent trips in the\r\nlarge airship, this mode of locomotion, as if he was on the back of\r\nsome bird, was much different. Still, after the first surprise, he\r\ngot used to it.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my finger ring!\" he exclaimed, \"I like it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would,\" said Tom, in a shout, and he adjusted the oil\r\nfeed to send more lubricant into the cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe earth stretched out below them, like some vari-colored relief\r\nmap, but they could not stop to admire any particular spot long, for\r\nthey were flying fast, and were beyond a scene almost as quickly as\r\nthey had a glimpse of it.\r\n\r\n\"How long will it take us?\" yelled Mr. Damon into Tom's ear.\r\n\r\n\"I hope to do it in three hours,\" shouted back the young inventor.\r\n\r\n\"What! Why it takes the train over five hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know, but we're going direct, and it's only about two\r\nhundred and fifty miles. That's only about eighty an hour. We're\r\ndoing seventy-five now, and I haven't let her out yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"She goes faster than the RED CLOUD,\" cried Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\nTom nodded. It was hard work to talk in that rush of air. For an\r\nhour they shot along, their speed gradually increasing. Tom called\r\nout the names of the larger places they passed over. He was now\r\ndoing better than eighty an hour as the gage showed. The trip was a\r\nglorious one, and the eyes of the young inventor and his friend\r\nsparkled in delight as they rushed forward. Two hours passed.\r\n\r\n\"Going to make it?\" fairly howled Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\nTom nodded again.\r\n\r\n\"Be there in time for dinner,\" he announced in a shout.\r\n\r\nIt lacked forty minutes of the three hours when Tom, pointing with\r\none hand down below, while with the other he gripped the lever of\r\nthe rudder, called:\r\n\r\n\"North Philadelphia!\"\r\n\r\n\"So soon?\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"Well, we certainly made speed! Where\r\nare you going to land?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered the young inventor, \"I'll have to pick out\r\nthe best place I see. It's no fun landing in a city. No room to run\r\nalong, after you're down.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with Franklin Field?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Out where\r\nthey play football.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! The very thing!\" shouted Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fenwick lives near there,\" went on Mr. Damon, and Tom nodded\r\ncomprehendingly.\r\n\r\nThey were now over North Philadelphia, and, in a few minutes more\r\nwere above the Quaker City itself. They were flying rather low, and\r\nas the people in the streets became aware of their presence there\r\nwas intense excitement. Tom steered for the big athletic field, and\r\nsoon saw it in the distance.\r\n\r\nWith a suddenness that was startling the motor ceased its terrific\r\nracket. The monoplane gave a sickening dip, and Tom had to adjust\r\nthe wing tips and rudder quickly to prevent it slewing around at a\r\ndangerous angle.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" cried Mr. Damon, \"Did you shut it off on\r\npurpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" shouted Tom, \"Something's gone wrong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone wrong! Bless my overshoes! Is there any danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to vol-plane to earth,\" answered Tom, and there was a\r\ngrim look on his face. He had never executed this feat with a\r\npassenger aboard. He was wondering how the BUTTERFLY would behave.\r\nBut he would know very soon, for already the tiny monoplane was\r\nshooting rapidly toward the big field, which was now swarming with a\r\ncurious crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE NEW AIRSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a brief instant after the stopping of the motor, and the\r\nconsequent sudden dropping toward the earth of the monoplane, Tom\r\nglanced at Mr. Damon. The latter's face was rather pale, but he\r\nseemed calm and collected. His lips moved slightly, and Tom, even in\r\nthose tense moments, wondered if the odd gentleman was blessing\r\nanything in particular, or everything in general.\r\n\r\nTom threw up the tilting plane, to catch more air beneath it, and\r\nbring the BUTTERFLY in a more parallel position to the earth. This,\r\nin a manner, checked the downward flight, and they glided along\r\nhorizontally for a hundred feet or more.\r\n\r\n\"Is--is there any great danger, Tom?\" asked Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" answered the young inventor, confidently. \"I have\r\ndone this same thing before, and from greater heights. The only\r\nthing that bothers me is that there are several cross-currents of\r\nair up here, which make it difficult to manage the planes and wing\r\ntips. But I think we'll make a good landing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my overcoat!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon \"I certainly hope so.\"\r\n\r\nConversation was more easily carried on now, as the motor was not\r\nspitting fire and throbbing like a battery of Gatling guns. Tom\r\nthought perhaps it might start on the spark, as the propeller was\r\nslowly swinging from the force of air against it. He tried, but\r\nthere was no explosion. He had scarcely hoped for it, as he realized\r\nthat some part of the mechanism must have broken.\r\n\r\nDown they glided, coming nearer and nearer to the earth. The crowd\r\nin the big athletic field grew larger. Shouts of wonder and fear\r\ncould be heard, and people could be seen running excitedly about. To\r\nTom and Mr. Damon they looked like dolls.\r\n\r\nReaching the limit of the parallel glide the monoplane once more\r\nshot down on an incline toward the earth with terrible speed. The\r\nground seemed to rush up to meet Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" he cried to Tom. \"We're going to hit something!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" was the calm answer \"I'm going to try a new stunt. Hold\r\nfast!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some spirals. I think that will let us down easier, but the craft\r\nis likely to tilt a bit, so hold on.\"\r\n\r\nThe young inventor shifted the movable planes and rudder, and, a\r\nmoment later, the BUTTERFLY swung violently around, like a polo pony\r\ntaking a sudden turn after the ball. Mr. Damon slid to one side of\r\nhis seat, and made a frantic grab for one of the upright supports.\r\n\r\n\"I made too short a turn!\" cried Tom, easing off the craft, which\r\nrighted itself in an instant. \"The air currents fooled me.\"\r\n\r\nUnder his skillful guidance, the monoplane was soon slowly\r\napproaching the earth in a series of graceful curves. It was under\r\nperfect control, and a smile of relief came on the face of the young\r\ninventor. Seeing it Mr. Damon took courage, and his hands, which had\r\ngrasped the uprights with such firmness that his knuckles showed\r\nwhite with the strain, were now removed. He sat easily in his seat.\r\n\r\n\"We're all right now,\" declared Tom. \"I'll take a couple of forward\r\nglides now, and we'll land.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent the machine straight ahead. It gathered speed in an instant.\r\nThen, with an upward tilt it was slackened, almost as if brakes had\r\nbeen applied. Once more it shot toward the earth, and once more it\r\nwas checked by an up-tilted plane.\r\n\r\nThen with a thud which shook up the occupants of the two seats, the\r\nBUTTERFLY came to the ground, and ran along on the three bicycle\r\nwheels. Swiftly it slid over the level ground. A more ideal landing\r\nplace would have been hard to find. Scores of willing hands reached\r\nout, and checked the momentum of the little monoplane, and Tom and\r\nMr. Damon climbed from their seats.\r\n\r\nThe crowd set up a cheer, and hundreds pressed around the aviators.\r\nSeveral sought to reach, and touch the machine, for they had\r\nprobably never been so close to one before, though airship flights\r\nare getting more and more common.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you trying for a record?\"\r\n\r\n\"How high did you get?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you fall, or come down on purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you start your motor in mid-air?\"\r\n\r\nThese, and scores of other questions were fairly volleyed at Tom and\r\nMr. Damon. The young inventor good-naturedly answered them as best\r\nhe could.\r\n\r\n\"We were coming down anyhow,\" he explained, \"but we did not\r\ncalculate on vol-planing. The motor was stalled, and I had to glide.\r\nPlease keep away from the machine. You might damage it.\"\r\n\r\nThe arrival of several policemen, who were attracted by the crowd,\r\nserved to keep the curious ones back away from the BUTTERFLY, or the\r\nmen, boys and women (for there were a number of the latter in the\r\nthrong) might have caused serious trouble.\r\n\r\nTom made a hasty examination of the motor, and, having satisfied\r\nhimself that only a minor difficulty had caused it to stop, he\r\ndecided to put the monoplane in some safe place, and proceed to Mr.\r\nFenwick's house.\r\n\r\nThe lad was just asking one of the officers if the air craft could\r\nnot be put in one of the grandstands which surrounded the field,\r\nwhen a voice on the outskirts of the crowd excitedly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Let me pass, please. I want to see that airship. I'm building one\r\nmyself, and I need all the experience I can get. Let me in, please.\"\r\n\r\nA man pushed his way into the crowd, and wormed his way to where Tom\r\nand Mr. Damon stood. At the sight of him, the eccentric individual\r\ncried out:\r\n\r\n\"Why bless my pocket-knife! If it isn't Mr. Fenwick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fenwick?\" gasped Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The inventor we came to see!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the newcomer cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Wakefield Damon!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's who I am,\" answered Tom's friend, \"and let me introduce you\r\nto Mr. Swift, the inventor of more machines than I can count. He and\r\nI were coming to see you, when we had a slight accident, and we\r\nlanded here. But that didn't matter, for we intended to land here\r\nanyhow, as I knew it was near your house. Only we had to vol-plane\r\nback to earth, and I can't say that I'd care for that, as a steady\r\ndiet. Bless my radiator, but I'm glad we've arrived safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you come all the way from your home in that?\" asked Mr. Fenwick\r\nof Tom, as he shook hands with him, and nodded at the monoplane.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. It's not much of a trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope my airship will do as well. But something seems to be\r\nwrong with it, and I have hopes that you can help me discover what\r\nit is, I know your father, and I have heard much of your ability.\r\nThat is why I requested your aid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I've been much overrated,\" spoke Tom, modestly, \"but\r\nI'll do all I can for you. I must now leave my monoplane in a safe\r\nplace, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll attend to that,\" Mr. Fenwick hastened to assure him. \"Leave it\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time a lieutenant of police, in charge of several reserve\r\nofficers, had arrived on the scene, for the crowd was now very\r\nlarge, and, as Mr. Fenwick knew this official, he requested that\r\nTom's machine be protected from damage. It was arranged that it\r\ncould be stored in a large, empty shed, and a policeman would be\r\nleft on guard. Then, seeing that it was all right, Tom, Mr. Damon\r\nand Mr. Fenwick started for the latter's house.\r\n\r\n\"I am very anxious to show you the WHIZZER,\" said Mr. Fenwick, as\r\nthey walked along.\r\n\r\n\"The WHIZZER?\" repeated Tom, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's what I call my electric airship. It hasn't 'whizzed'\r\nany to speak of yet, but I have hopes that it will, now that you are\r\nhere to help me. We will take one of these taxicabs, and soon be at\r\nmy house. I was out for a stroll, when I saw your monoplane coming\r\ndown, and I hastened to Franklin Field to see it.\"\r\n\r\nThe three entered an automobile, and were soon being driven to the\r\ninventor's home. A little later he led them out to a big shed which\r\noccupied nearly all of a large lot, in back of Mr. Fenwick's house.\r\n\r\n\"Does it take up all that room?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, the WHIZZER is pretty good size. There she is!\" cried Mr.\r\nFenwick proudly, as he threw open the doors of the shed, and Tom and\r\nMr. Damon, looking in, saw a large triplane, with a good-sized gas\r\nbag hovering over it, and a strange collection of rudders, wings and\r\nplanes sticking out from either side. Amidships was an enclosed car,\r\nor cabin, and a glimpse into it served to disclose to the young\r\ninventor a mass of machinery.\r\n\r\n\"There she is! That's the WHIZZER!\" cried Mr. Fenwick, with pride in\r\nhis voice. \"What do you think of her, Tom Swift?\"\r\n\r\nTom did not immediately answer. He looked dubiously at the electric\r\nairship and shrugged his shoulders. It seemed to him, at first\r\nglance, that, it would never sail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMAKING SOME CHANGES\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think of it?\" asked Mr. Fenwick again, as Tom\r\nwalked all about the electric airship, still without speaking.\r\n\r\n\"It's big, certainly,\" remarked the lad.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my shoe horn! I should say it was!\" burst out Mr. Damon.\r\n\"It's larger than your RED CLOUD, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will it go? That's what I want to know,\" insisted the inventor.\r\n\"Do you think it will fly, Tom? I haven't dared to try it yet,\r\nthough a small model which I made floated in the air for some time.\r\nBut it wouldn't move, except as the wind blew it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be hard to say, without a careful examination, whether\r\nthis large one will fly or not,\" answered Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Then give it a careful examination,\" suggested Mr. Fenwick. \"I'll\r\npay you well for your time and trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh if I can help a fellow inventor, and assist in making a new\r\nmodel of airship fly, I'm only too glad to do it without pay,\"\r\nretorted Tom, quickly. \"I didn't come here for that. Suppose we go\r\nin the cabin, and look at the motor. That's the most important\r\npoint, if your airship is to navigate.\"\r\n\r\nThere was certainly plenty of machinery in the cabin of the WHIZZER.\r\nMost of it was electrical, for on that power Mr. Fenwick intended to\r\ndepend to sail through space. There was a new type of gasolene\r\nengine, small but very powerful, and this served to operate a\r\ndynamo. In turn, the dynamo operated an electrical motor, as Mr.\r\nFenwick had an idea that better, and more uniform, power could be\r\nobtained in this way, than from a gasolene motor direct. One\r\nadvantage which Tom noticed at once, was that the WHIZZER had a\r\nlarge electric storage battery.\r\n\r\nThis was intended to operate the electric motor in case of a break\r\nto the main machinery, and it seemed a good idea. There were various\r\nother apparatuses, machines, and appliances, the nature of which Tom\r\ncould not readily gather from a mere casual view.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's your opinion, now that you have seen the motor?\" asked\r\nMr. Fenwick, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I'd have to see it in operation,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"And you shall, right after dinner,\" declared the inventor. \"I'd\r\nlike to start it now, and hear what you have to say, but I'm not so\r\nselfish as that. I know you must be hungry after your trip from\r\nShopton, as they say aeroplaning gives one an appetite.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether it's that or not,\" answered Tom with a laugh,\r\n\"but I am certainly hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll postpone the trial until after dinner. It must be ready\r\nby this time, I think,\" said Mr. Fenwick, as he led the way back to\r\nthe house. It was magnificently furnished, for the inventor was a\r\nman of wealth, and only took up aeroplaning as a \"fad.\" An excellent\r\ndinner was served, and then the three returned once more to the shed\r\nwhere the WHIZZER was kept.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I start the motor in here?\" asked Mr. Fenwick, when he had\r\nsummoned several of the machinists whom he employed, to aid himself\r\nand the young inventor.\r\n\r\n\"It would be better if we could take it outside,\" suggested Tom,\r\n\"yet a crowd is sure to gather, and I don't like to work in a mob of\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we can easily get around that,\" said Mr. Fenwick. \"I have two\r\nopenings to my aeroplane shed. We can take the WHIZZER out of the\r\nrear door, into a field enclosed by a high fence. That is where I\r\nmade all my trials, and the crowd couldn't get in, though some boys\r\ndid find knot-holes and use them. But I don't mind that. The only\r\nthing that bothers me is that I can't make the WHIZZER go up, and if\r\nit won't go up, it certainly won't sail. That's my difficulty, and I\r\nhope you can remedy it, Tom Swift.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do the best I can. But let's get the airship outside.\"\r\n\r\nThis was soon accomplished, and in the open lot Tom made a thorough\r\nand careful examination of the mechanism. The motor was started, and\r\nthe propellers, for there were two, whirled around at rapid speed.\r\n\r\nTom made some tests and calculations, at which he was an expert, and\r\napplied the brake test, to see how much horse power the motor would\r\ndeliver.\r\n\r\n\"I think there is one trouble that we will have to get over,\" he\r\nfinally said to Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The motor is not quite powerful enough because of the way in which\r\nyou have it geared up. I think by changing some of the cogs, and\r\ngetting rid of the off-set shaft, also by increasing the number of\r\nrevolutions, and perhaps by using a new style of carburetor, we can\r\nget more speed and power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll do it!\" cried Mr. Fenwick, with enthusiasm. \"I knew I\r\nhadn't got everything just right. Do you think it will work after\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked Tom, hesitatingly, \"I think the arrangement of the\r\nplanes will also have to be changed. It will take quite some work,\r\nbut perhaps, after a bit, we can get the WHIZZER up in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you begin work at once?\" asked the inventor, eagerly.\r\n\r\nTom shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I can't stay long enough on this trip,\" he said. \"I promised father\r\nI would be back by to-morrow at the latest, but I will come over\r\nhere again, and arrange to stay until I have done all I can. I need\r\nto get some of my special tools, and then, too, you will require\r\nsome other supplies, of which I will give you a list. I hope you\r\ndon't mind me speaking in this way, Mr. Fenwick, as though I knew\r\nmore about it than you do,\" added Tom, modestly.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it!\" cried the inventor heartily. \"I want the benefit\r\nof your advice and experience, and I'll do just as you say. I hope\r\nyou can come back soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll return the first of the week,\" promised Tom, \"and then we'll\r\nsee what can be done. Now I'll go over the whole ship once more, and\r\nsee what I need. I also want to test the lifting capacity of your\r\ngas bag.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was a busy one for our hero. With the aid of Mr.\r\nDamon and the owner of the WHIZZER, he went over every point\r\ncarefully. Then, as it was too late to attempt the return flight to\r\nShopton, he telegraphed his father, and he and Mr. Damon remained\r\nover night with Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, having written out a list of the things that would\r\nbe needed, Tom went out to Franklin Field, and repaired his own\r\nmonoplane. It was found that one of the electric wires connected\r\nwith the motor had broken, thus cutting off the spark. It was soon\r\nrepaired, and, in the presence of a large crowd, Tom and Mr. Damon\r\nstarted on their return flight.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you can make the WHIZZER work, Tom?\" asked Mr. Damon,\r\nas they were flying high over Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a little dubious about it,\" was the reply. \"But after I make some\r\nchanges I may have a different opinion. The whole affair is too big\r\nand clumsy, that's the trouble; though the electrical part of it is\r\nvery good.\"\r\n\r\nShopton was reached without incident, in about three hours, and\r\nthere was no necessity, this time, of vol-planing back to earth.\r\nAfter a short rest, Tom began getting together a number of special\r\ntools and appliances, which he proposed taking back to Philadelphia\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nThe young inventor made another trip to Mr. Fenwick's house the\r\nfirst of the following week. He went by train this time, as he had\r\nto ship his tools, and Mr. Damon did not accompany him. Then, with\r\nthe assistance of the inventor of the WHIZZER, and several of his\r\nmechanics, Tom began making the changes on the airship.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you can make it fly?\" asked Mr. Fenwick, anxiously,\r\nafter several days of labor.\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" replied our hero, and there was more confidence in his\r\ntone than there had been before. As the work progressed, he began to\r\nbe more hopeful. \"I'll make a trial flight, anyhow, in a few days,\"\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\n\"Then I must send word to Mr. Damon,\" decided Mr. Fenwick. \"He wants\r\nto be on hand to see it, and, if possible, go up; so he told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" assented Tom. \"I only hope it does go up,\" he\r\nconcluded, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nANDY FOGER'S REVENGE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the following week, Tom was kept busy over the airship. He\r\nmade many important changes, and one of these was to use a new kind\r\nof gas in the balloon bag. He wanted a gas with a greater lifting\r\npower than that of the ordinary illuminating vapor which Mr. Fenwick\r\nhad used.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked Tom, as he came from the airship shed one\r\nafternoon, \"I think we can give it a try-out, Mr. Fenwick, in a few\r\ndays more. I shall have to go back to Shopton to get some articles I\r\nneed, and when I come back I will bring Mr. Damon with me, and we\r\nwill see what the WHIZZER can do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean we will make a trial flight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"For how long a distance?\"\r\n\r\n\"It all depends on how she behaves,\" answered Tom, with a smile. \"If\r\npossible, we'll make a long flight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll tell you what I'm going to do,\" went on the inventor,\r\n\"I'm going to put aboard a stock of provisions, and some other\r\nsupplies and stores, in case we are two or three days in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might not be a bad plan,\" agreed Tom, \"though I hardly think we\r\nwill be gone as long as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, being out in the air always makes me hungry,\" proceeded Mr.\r\nFenwick, \"so I'm going to take plenty of food along.\"\r\n\r\nThe time was to come, and that very soon, when this decision of the\r\ninventor of the WHIZZER stood the adventurers in good stead.\r\n\r\nTom returned to Shopton the next day, and sent word to have Mr.\r\nDamon join him in time to go back to the Quaker City two days later.\r\n\r\n\"But why don't you start right back to Philadelphia to-morrow,\"\r\nasked Mr. Swift of his son.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" answered Tom, and that was all the reason he would give,\r\nthough had any one seen him reading a certain note a few minutes\r\nbefore that, which note was awaiting him on his arrival from the\r\nQuaker City, they would not have wondered at his decision.\r\n\r\nThe note was brief. It merely said:\r\n\r\n\"Won't you come, and have some apple turnovers? The new cook is a\r\ntreasure, and the girls are anxious to meet you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was signed: Mary Nestor.\r\n\r\n\"I think I could enjoy some apple turnovers,\" remarked Tom, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nHaving gotten ready the few special appliances he wished to take\r\nback to Philadelphia with him, Tom went, that evening, to call on\r\nMiss Nestor. True to her promise, the girl had a big plate full of\r\napple turnovers, which she gaily offered our hero on his arrival,\r\nand, on his laughing declination to partake of so many, she ushered\r\nhim into a room full of pretty girls, saying:\r\n\r\n\"They'll help you eat them, Tom. Girls, here is Mr. Swift, who\r\ndoesn't mind going up in the air or under the ocean, or even\r\ncatching runaway horses,\" by which last she referred to the time Tom\r\nsaved her life, and first made her acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAs for the young inventor, he gave a gasp, almost as if he had\r\nplunged into a bath of icy water, at the sight of so many pretty\r\nfaces staring at him. He said afterward that he would rather have\r\nvol-planed back to earth from a seven-mile height, than again face\r\nsuch a battery of sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\nBut our hero soon recovered himself, and entered into the merriment\r\nof the evening, and, before he knew it he was telling Miss Nestor\r\nand her attractive guests something of his exploits.\r\n\r\n\"But I'm talking altogether too much about myself.\" he said,\r\nfinally. \"How is the new cook Miss Nestor; and have you heard from\r\nyour father and mother since they sailed on the RESOLUTE for the\r\nWest Indies?\"\r\n\r\n\"As to the new cook, she is a jewel of the first water,\" answered\r\nMiss Nestor. \"We all like her, and she is anxious for another ride\r\nin a taxicab, as she calls your auto.\"\r\n\r\n\"She shall have it,\" declared Tom, \"for those are the best apple\r\nturnovers I ever ate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell her so,\" declared Mary. \"She'll appreciate it coming from\r\nan inventor of your ability.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard from your parents?\" asked Tom, anxious to change the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. I had a wire to-day. They stopped at St. Augustine to let\r\nme know they were having a glorious time aboard the yacht. Mr.\r\nHosbrook, the owner, is an ideal host, mamma said. They are\r\nproceeding directly to the West Indies, now. I do hope they will\r\narrive safely. They say there are bad storms down there at this time\r\nof year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, if they are shipwrecked, Mr. Swift will go to their rescue\r\nin one of his airships, or a submarine,\" suggested Mabel Jackson,\r\none of the several pretty girls.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I hope he doesn't have to!\" exclaimed Mary. \"Don't speak of\r\nshipwrecks! It makes me shudder,\" and she seemed unduly alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Of course they won't have any trouble,\" asserted Tom, confidently,\r\nmore to reassure Miss Nestor, than from any knowledge he possessed;\r\n\"but if they do get cast away on a desert island, I'll certainly go\r\nto their rescue,\" he added.\r\n\r\nIt was late when Tom started for home that night, for the society of\r\nMiss Nestor and her friends made the time pass quickly. He promised\r\nto call again, and try some more samples of the new cook's culinary\r\nart, as soon as he had gotten Mr. Fenwick's airship in shape for\r\nflying.\r\n\r\nAs, later that night, the young inventor came in sight of his home,\r\nand the various buildings and shops surrounding it, his first glance\r\nwas toward the shed which contained his monoplane, BUTTERFLY. That\r\nlittle craft was Tom's pet. It had not cost him anything like as\r\nmuch as had his other inventions, either in time or money, but he\r\ncared more for it than for his big airship, RED CLOUD. This was\r\nprincipally because the BUTTERFLY was so light and airy, and could\r\nbe gotten ready so quickly for a flight across country. It was\r\ncapable of long endurance, too, for an extra large supply of\r\ngasolene and oil was carried aboard.\r\n\r\nSo it was with rather a start of surprise that Tom saw a light in\r\nthe structure where the BUTTERFLY was housed.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if dad or Mr. Jackson can be out there?\" he mused. \"Yet, I\r\ndon't see why they should be. They wouldn't be going for a flight at\r\nnight. Or perhaps Mr. Damon arrived, and is out looking it over.\"\r\n\r\nA moment's reflection, however, told Tom that this last surmise\r\ncould not be true, since the eccentric man had telegraphed, saying\r\nhe would not arrive until the next day.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody's out there, however,\" went on Tom, \"and I'm going to see\r\nwho it is. I hope it isn't Eradicate monkeying with the monoplane.\r\nHe's very curious, and he might get it out of order.\"\r\n\r\nTom increased his pace, and moved swiftly but softly toward the\r\nshed. If there was an intruder inside he wanted to surprise him.\r\nThere were large windows to the place, and they would give a good\r\nview of the interior. As Tom approached, the light within flickered,\r\nand moved to and fro.\r\n\r\nTom reached one of the casements, and peered in. He caught a glimpse\r\nof a moving figure, and he heard a peculiar ripping sound. Then, as\r\nhe sprang toward the front door, the light suddenly went out, and\r\nthe young inventor could hear some one running from the shop.\r\n\r\n\"They've seen me, and are trying to get away,\" thought the lad. \"I\r\nmust catch them!\"\r\n\r\nHe fairly leaped toward the portal, and, just as he reached it, a\r\nfigure sprang out. So close was Tom that the unknown collided with\r\nhim, and our hero went over on his back. The other person was tossed\r\nback by the force of the impact, but quickly recovered himself, and\r\ndashed away.\r\n\r\nNot before, however, Tom had had a chance to glance at his face,\r\nand, to the chagrin of the young inventor, he recognized, by the dim\r\nlight of a crescent moon, the countenance of Andy Foger! If\r\nadditional evidence was needed Tom fully recognized the form as that\r\nof the town bully.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on there, Andy Foger!\" shouted the young inventor. \"What are\r\nyou doing in my shed? What right have you in there? What did you\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\nBack came the answer through the night:\r\n\r\n\"I told you I'd get square with you, and I've done it,\" and then\r\nAndy's footsteps died away, while a mocking laugh floated back to\r\nTom. What was Andy's revenge?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE WHIZZER FLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Tom gazed after the fleeting figure of the cowardly\r\nbully. He was half-minded to give pursuit, and then, realizing that\r\nhe could find Andy later if he wanted him, the young inventor\r\ndecided his best plan would be to see what damage had been done. For\r\nthat damage would follow Andy's secret visit to the shop, Tom was\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nNor was his surmise wrong. Stepping into the building, the lad\r\nswitched on the lights, and he could not repress an exclamation of\r\nchagrin as he looked toward his trim little monoplane, the\r\nBUTTERFLY.\r\n\r\nNow it was a BUTTERFLY with broken wings, for Andy had slashed the\r\ncanvas of the planes in a score of places.\r\n\r\n\"The scoundrel!\" growled Tom. \"I'll make him suffer for this! He's\r\nall but ruined my aeroplane.\"\r\n\r\nTom walked around his pet machine. As he came in front, and saw the\r\npropeller, he gave another exclamation. The fine wooden blades of\r\nseveral layers, gracefully curved, which had cost him so much in\r\ntime and labor to build up, and then fashion to the right shape, had\r\nbeen hacked, and cut with an axe. The propeller was useless!\r\n\r\n\"More of Andy's work,\" murmured Tom. \"This is about the worst yet!\"\r\n\r\nThere came over him a feeling of great despondency, which was\r\nsucceeded by a justifiable rage. He wanted to take after the bully,\r\nand give him a merciless beating. Then a calmer mood came over Tom.\r\n\r\n\"After all, what's the use?\" he reasoned. \"Whipping Andy wouldn't\r\nmend the BUTTERFLY. She's in bad shape, but I can repair her, when I\r\nget time. Luckily, he didn't meddle with the engine. That's all\r\nright.\" A hasty examination had shown this. \"I guess I won't do\r\nanything now,\" went on Tom. \"I'll have my hands full getting Mr.\r\nFenwick's airship to run. After that I can come back here and fix up\r\nmy own. It's a good thing I don't have to depend on her for making\r\nthe trip to Philadelphia. Poor BUTTERFLY! you sure are in a bad\r\nway,\" and Tom felt almost as if he was talking to some living\r\ncreature, so wrapped up was he in his trim little monoplane.\r\n\r\nAfter another disheartening look at his air craft, the young\r\ninventor started to leave the shop. He looked at a door, the\r\nfastening of which Andy had broken to gain admittance.\r\n\r\n\"I should have had the burglar alarm working, and this would never\r\nhave happened,\" reasoned Tom. All the buildings were arranged so\r\nthat if any one entered them after a certain hour, an alarm would\r\nring in the house. But of late, the alarm had not been set, as Tom\r\nand his father were not working on any special inventions that\r\nneeded guarding. It was due to this oversight that Andy was able to\r\nget in undetected.\r\n\r\n\"But it won't happen again,\" declared Tom, and he at once began\r\nconnecting the burglar-apparatus. He went into the house, and told\r\nhis father and the engineer what had occurred. They were both\r\nindignant, and the engineer declared that he would sleep with one\r\neye open all night, ready to respond to the first alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there's no danger of Andy coming back right away,\" said Tom.\r\n\"He's too frightened. I wouldn't be surprised if he disappeared for\r\na time. He'll be thinking that I'm after him.\"\r\n\r\nThis proved true, as Andy had left town next morning, and to all\r\ninquiries his mother said he had gone to visit relatives. She was\r\nnot aware of her son's meanness, and Tom did not tell her.\r\n\r\nMr. Damon arrived from his home in Waterfield that day, and, with\r\nmany \"blessings,\" wanted to know if Tom was ready for the trial of\r\nthe electrical airship.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we'll leave for Philadelphia to-morrow,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Are we going in the BUTTERFLY? Bless my watch chain, but I like\r\nthat little machine!\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be some time before you again have a flight in her,\" said\r\nTom, sorrowfully, as he told of Andy's act of vandalism.\r\n\r\n\"Why, bless my individuality!\" cried Mr. Damon, indignantly. \"I\r\nnever heard of such a thing! Never!\"\r\n\r\nIt did little good to talk of it, however, and Tom wanted to forget\r\nabout it. He wished he had time to repair the monoplane before he\r\nleft home, but there was much to do to get ready for the trial of\r\nthe WHIZZER.\r\n\r\n\"When will you be back, Tom?\" asked Mr. Swift, as his son and Mr.\r\nDamon departed for the Quaker City the following morning.\r\n\r\n\"Hard to say, dad. If I can make a long flight in the WHIZZER I'll\r\ndo so. I may even drop down here and pay you a visit. But if I find\r\nthere are many more changes to make in her construction, which is\r\nmore than likely, I can't say when I'll return. I'll keep you\r\nposted, however, by writing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you arrange to send me some wireless messages?\" asked the\r\nolder inventor, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I could, if I had thought to rig up the apparatus on Mr. Fenwick's\r\nairship,\" was the reply. \"I'll hardly have time to do it now,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Send wireless messages from an aeroplane?\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"Bless\r\nmy gizzard! I never heard of such a thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it can be done,\" Tom assured him. And this was a fact. Tom had\r\ninstalled a wireless apparatus on his RED CLOUD recently, and it is\r\nwell known that several of the modern biplanes can send wireless\r\nmessages. The crossing and bracing wires of the frame are used for\r\nsending wires, and in place of ground conductors there are trailers\r\nwhich hang below the aeroplane. The current is derived directly from\r\nthe engine, and the remaining things needed are a small step-up\r\ntransformer, a key and a few other small parts. Tom had gone a step\r\nfarther than this, and had also arranged to receive wireless\r\nmessages, though few modern aeroplanes are thus equipped as yet.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, there was no time now to install a wireless\r\napparatus on Mr. Fenwick's craft. Tom thought he would be lucky if\r\nhe got the WHIZZER to make even a short flight.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let me hear from you when you can,\" requested Mr. Swift, and\r\nTom promised. It was some time after that, and many strange things\r\nhappened before Tom Swift again communicated with his father, at any\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe young inventor had bidden farewell to Miss Nestor the night\r\nprevious. She stated that she had a message that day from her\r\nparents aboard the RESOLUTE, which spoke a passing steamer. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Nestor, and the other guests of Mr. Hosbrook were well, and\r\nanticipated a fine time on reaching the West Indies.\r\n\r\nTom now said good-by to his father, the housekeeper and Mr. Jackson,\r\nnot forgetting, of course, Eradicate Sampson.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let Andy Foger come sneaking around here, Rad,\" cautioned the\r\nyoung inventor.\r\n\r\n\"'Deed an' I won't!\" exclaimed the colored man. \"Ef he do, I'll hab\r\nBoomerang kick him t' pieces, an' den I'll whitewash him so his own\r\nfolks won't know him! Oh, don't you worry, Massa Tom. Dat Andy won't\r\ndo no funny business when I'm around!\"\r\n\r\nTom laughed, and started for the station with Mr. Damon. They\r\narrived in Philadelphia that afternoon, the trip being very slow, as\r\ncompared with the one made by the monoplane. They found Mr. Fenwick\r\nanxiously awaiting them, and Tom at once started work on the\r\nairship.\r\n\r\nHe kept at it until late that night, and resumed early the next\r\nmorning. Many more changes and adjustments were made, and that\r\nafternoon, the young inventor said:\r\n\r\n\"I think we'll give it a try-out, Mr. Fenwick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean make a flight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if she'll take it; but only a short one. I want to get her up\r\nin the air, and see how she behaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you find out, after you're up, that she does well, you may\r\nwant to take a long flight,\" suggested Mr. Fenwick. \"If you do, why\r\nI have everything aboard necessary for a long voyage. The WHIZZER is\r\nwell stocked with provisions.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the big electric machine was wheeled out into the\r\nyard, for, in spite of her size, four men could easily move the\r\ncraft about, so well was she balanced. Aside from a few personal\r\nfriends of the inventor, himself, his machinists, Tom and Mr. Damon,\r\nno one was present at the try-out.\r\n\r\nTom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick climbed into the car which was\r\nsuspended below the gas bag, and between the wing-like planes on\r\neither side. The young inventor had decided to make the WHIZZER rise\r\nby scudding her across the ground on the bicycle wheels, with which\r\nshe was equipped, and then by using the tilting planes to endeavor\r\nto lift her off the earth. He wanted to see if she would go up that\r\nway, without the use of the gas bag.\r\n\r\nAll was in readiness. The motor was started and the machinery began\r\nto hum and throb. The propellers gained speed with every revolution.\r\nThe airship had been made fast by a rope, to which was attached a\r\nstrong spring balance, as it was desired to see how much pull the\r\nengine would give.\r\n\r\n\"Eight hundred pounds,\" announced one of the machinists.\r\n\r\n\"A thousand would be better, but we'll try it,\" murmured Tom. \"Cast\r\noff!\"\r\n\r\nThe rope was loosened, and, increasing the speed of the engine, Tom\r\nsignalled to the men to give a little momentum to the craft. She\r\nbegan running over the smooth ground. There was a cheer from the few\r\nspectators. Certainly the WHIZZER made good time on the earth.\r\n\r\nTom was anxiously watching the gages and other instruments. He\r\nwanted a little more speed, but could not seem to get it. He ran the\r\nmotor to the utmost, and then, seeing the necessity of making an\r\nattempt to get up into the air, before the end of the speeding\r\nground was reached, he pulled the elevating plane lever.\r\n\r\nThe front of the WHIZZER rose, and then settled down. Tom quickly\r\nshut off the power, and jammed on the brake, an arrangement of\r\nspikes that dug into the earth, for the high board fence loomed up\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" cried Mr. Fenwick, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't get up speed enough,\" answered the young inventor. \"We\r\nmust have more momentum to make her rise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can it be gotten?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so. I'll gear the motor higher.\"\r\n\r\nIt took an hour to do this. Once more the scale test was applied. It\r\nregistered a pull of fifteen hundred pounds now.\r\n\r\n\"We'll go up,\" said Tom, grimly.\r\n\r\nOnce more the motors spit out fire, and the propellers whirled so\r\nthat they looked like mere circles of light. Once more the WHIZZER\r\nshot over the ground, but this time, as she neared the fence, she\r\nrose up like a bird, cleared it like a trick horse, and soared off\r\ninto the air!\r\n\r\nThe WHIZZER was flying!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nOVER THE OCEAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Mr. Fenwick in delight. \"My machine is really flying\r\nat last!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Tom, as he adjusted various levers and gears, \"she\r\nis going. It's not as high as I'd like, but it is doing very well,\r\nconsidering the weight of the craft, and the fact that we have not\r\nused the gas bag. I'm going to let that fill now, and we'll go up.\r\nDon't you want to steer, Mr. Fenwick?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you manage it, Tom, until it's in good running shape. I don't\r\nwant to 'hoodoo' it. I worked as hard as I could, and never got more\r\nthan two feet off the ground. Now I'm really sailing. It's great!\"\r\n\r\nHe was very enthusiastic, and Tom himself was not a little pleased\r\nat his own success, for certainly the airship had looked to be a\r\nvery dubious proposition at first.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my gaiters! But we are doing pretty well,\" remarked Mr.\r\nDamon, looking down on the field where Mr. Fenwick's friends and the\r\nmachinists were gathered, cheering and waving their hands.\r\n\r\n\"We'll do better,\" declared Tom.\r\n\r\nHe had already set the gas machine in operation, and was now looking\r\nover the electric apparatus, to see that it was working well. It\r\nneeded some adjustments, which he made.\r\n\r\nAll this while the WHIZZER was moving about in a big circle, for the\r\nrudder had been automatically set to so swing the craft. It was\r\nabout two hundred feet high, but soon after the gas began to enter\r\nthe bag it rose until it was nearly five thousand feet high. This\r\nsatisfied Tom that the airship could do better than he expected, and\r\nhe decided to return nearer earth.\r\n\r\nIn going down, he put the craft through a number of evolutions\r\ndesigned to test her ability to answer the rudders promptly. The lad\r\nsaw opportunity for making a number of changes, and suggested them\r\nto Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going any farther?\" asked the owner of the WHIZZER, as he\r\nsaw that his craft was slowly settling.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think we've done enough for the first day,\" said Tom, \"But\r\nI'd like you to handle her now, Mr. Fenwick. You can make the\r\nlanding, while I watch the motor and other machines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I guess I can make a landing all right,\" assented the\r\ninventor. \"I'm better at coming down than going up.\"\r\n\r\nHe did make a good descent, and received the congratulation of his\r\nfriends as he stepped from the airship. Tom was also given much\r\npraise for his success in making the craft go at all, for Mr.\r\nFenwick and his acquaintances had about given up hope that she ever\r\nwould rise.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think of her?\" Mr. Fenwick wanted to know of the\r\nyoung inventor, who replied that, as soon as some further changes\r\nhad been made, they would attempt a long flight.\r\n\r\nThis promise was kept two days later. They were busy days for Tom,\r\nMr. Fenwick and the latter's assistants. Tom sent a short note to\r\nhis father telling of the proposed long flight, and intimated that\r\nhe might make a call in Shopton if all went well. He also sent a\r\nwire to Miss Nestor, hinting that she might have some apple\r\nturnovers ready for him.\r\n\r\nBut Tom never called for that particular pastry, though it was\r\ngotten ready for him when the girl received his message.\r\n\r\nAll was in readiness for the long flight, and a preliminary test had\r\ndemonstrated that the WHIZZER had been wonderfully improved by the\r\nchanges Tom made. The young inventor looked over the supply of food\r\nMr. Fenwick had placed aboard, glanced at the other stores, and\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"How long do you expect to be gone, Mr. Fenwick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you think we can stay out a week?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's quite a while,\" responded Tom. \"We may be glad to return in\r\ntwo days, or less. But I think we're all ready to start. Are any of\r\nyour friends going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've tried to pursuade some of them to accompany me, but they are a\r\nbit timid,\" said the inventor. \"I guess we three will make up the\r\nparty this time, though if our trip is a successful one I'll be\r\noverwhelmed with requests for rides, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nAs before, a little crowd gathered to see the start. The day was\r\nwarm, but there was a slight haziness which Tom did not like. He\r\nhoped, though, that it would pass over before they had gone far.\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to head for any particular spot, Mr. Fenwick?\" asked\r\nTom, as they were entering the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I would like to go down and circle Cape May, New Jersey, if we\r\ncould. I have a friend who has a summer cottage there, and he was\r\nalways laughing at my airship. I'd just like to drop down in front\r\nof his place now, and pay him a call.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll try it,\" assented Tom, with a smile.\r\n\r\nAn auspicious start was made, the WHIZZER taking the air after a\r\nshort flight across the ground, and then, with the lifting gas\r\naiding in pulling the craft upward, the airship started to sail high\r\nover the city of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nSo swiftly did it rise that the cheers of the little crowd of Mr.\r\nFenwick's friends were scarcely heard. Up and up it went, and then a\r\nlittle later, to the astonishment of the crowds in the streets, Tom\r\nput the airship twice in a circle around the statue of William Penn,\r\non the top of the City Hall.\r\n\r\n\"Now you steer,\" the lad invited Mr. Fenwick. \"Take her straight\r\nacross the Delaware River, and over Camden, New Jersey, and then\r\nhead south, for Cape May. We ought to make it in an hour, for we are\r\ngetting up good speed.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the owner in charge of his craft, to that gentleman's no\r\nsmall delight, Tom and Mr. Damon began an inspection of the\r\nelectrical and other machinery. There was much that needed\r\nattention, but Tom soon had the automatic apparatus in working\r\norder, and then less attention need be given to it.\r\n\r\nSeveral times the young investor looked out of the windows with\r\nwhich the cabin was fitted. Mr. Damon noticed this.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my shoe laces, Tom,\" he said. \"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like the looks of the weather,\" was the answer. \"I think\r\nwe're in for a storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's put back.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it would be too bad to disappoint Mr. Fenwick, now that we have\r\nmade such a good start. He wants to make a long flight, and I can't\r\nblame him,\" spoke Tom, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"But if there's danger--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, we can soon be at Cape May, and start back. The wind is\r\nfreshening rather suddenly, though,\" and Tom looked at the\r\nanemometer, which showed a speed of twenty miles an hour. However,\r\nit was in their favor, aiding them to make faster time.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the WHIZZER was now about forty miles an hour, not fast\r\nfor an air craft, but sufficiently speedy in trying out a new\r\nmachine. Tom looked at the barograph, and noted that they had\r\nattained an altitude of seven thousand five hundred feet.\r\n\r\n\"That's better than millionaire Daxtel's distance of seven thousand\r\none hundred and five feet,\" remarked the lad, with a smile, \"and it\r\nbreaks Jackson's climb of seven thousand three hundred and three\r\nfeet, which is pretty good for your machine, Mr. Fenwick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think so?\" asked the pleased inventor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And we'll do better than that in time, but it's best to go\r\nslow at first, until we see how she is standing the strain. This is\r\nhigh and fast enough for the present.\"\r\n\r\nThey kept on, and as Tom saw that the machinery was working well, he\r\nlet it out a little, The WHIZZER at once leaped forward, and, a\r\nlittle later they came within sight of Cape May, the Jersey coast\r\nresort.\r\n\r\n\"Now to drop down and visit my friend,\" said Mr. Fenwick, with a\r\nsmile. \"Won't he be surprised!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think we'd better do it,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the wind is getting stronger every minute and it will be\r\nagainst us on the way back. If we descend, and try to make another\r\nascension we may fail. We're up in the air now, and it may be easy\r\nto turn around and go back. Then, again, it may not, but it\r\ncertainly will be easier to shift around up here than down on the\r\nground. So I'd rather not descend--that is, not entirely to the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, just as you say, though I wanted my friend to know I could\r\nbuild a successful airship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we can get around that. I'll take her down as low as is safe,\r\nand fly over his house, if you'll point it out, and you can drop him\r\na message in one of the pasteboard tubes we carry for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" assented Mr. Fenwick. \"I'll do it.\"\r\n\r\nTom sent the WHIZZER down until the hotels and cottages could be\r\nmade out quite plainly. After looking with a pair of opera glasses,\r\nMr. Fenwick picked out the residence of his friend, and Tom prepared\r\nto circle about the roof.\r\n\r\nBy this time the presence of the airship had become known to\r\nhundreds, and crowds were eagerly watching it.\r\n\r\n\"There he is! There's my friend who didn't believe I would ever\r\nsucceed!\" exclaimed Mr. Fenwick, pointing to a man who stood in the\r\nstreet in front of a large, white house. \"I'll drop him a message!\"\r\n\r\nOne was in readiness in a weighted pasteboard cylinder, and soon it\r\nwas falling downward. The airship was moving slowly, as it was\r\nbeating against the wind.\r\n\r\nLeaning out of the cabin window, Mr. Fenwick shouted to his friend:\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Will! I thought you said my airship would never go! I'll come\r\nand give you a ride, some day!\"\r\n\r\nWhether the gentleman understood what Mr. Fenwick shouted at him is\r\ndoubtful, but he saw the inventor waving his hand, and he saw the\r\nfalling cylinder, and a look of astonishment spread over his face,\r\nas he ran to pick up the message.\r\n\r\n\"We're going up now, and will try to head for home,\" said Tom, a\r\nmoment later, as he shifted the rudder.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my storage battery!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"But we have had a fine\r\ntrip.\"\r\n\r\n\"A much better one than we'll have going back,\" observed Tom, in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n\"Why; what's the matter?\" asked the eccentric man.\r\n\r\n\"The wind has increased to a gale, and will be dead against us,\"\r\nanswered Tom.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenwick was busy writing another message to drop, and he paid\r\nlittle attention to the young inventor. Tom sent the craft well up\r\ninto the air, and then tried to turn it about, and head back for\r\nPhiladelphia. No sooner had he done so than the airship was met by\r\nthe full force of the wind, which was now almost a hurricane. It had\r\nsteadily increased, but, as long as they were moving with it, they\r\ndid not notice it so much. Once they attempted to stem its fury they\r\nfound themselves almost helpless.\r\n\r\nTom quickly realized this, and, giving up his intention of beating\r\nup against the wind, he turned the craft around, and let it fly\r\nbefore the gale, the propellers aiding to get up a speed of seventy\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenwick, who had dropped the last of his messages, came from his\r\nsmall private cabin, to where Mr. Damon and Tom were in a low-voiced\r\nconversation near the engines. The owner of the WHIZZER, happened to\r\nlook down through a plate-glass window in the floor of car. What he\r\nsaw caused him to give a gasp of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Why--why!\" he exclaimed. \"We--we're over the ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Tom, quietly, as he gazed down on the tumbling\r\nbillows below them. They had quickly passed over Cape May, across\r\nthe sandy beach, and were now well out over the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\"Why--why are we out here?\" asked Mr. Fenwick. \"Isn't it dangerous--in\r\nan airship that hasn't been thoroughly tried yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dangerous? Yes, somewhat,\" replied Tom, slowly. \"But we can't help\r\nourselves, Mr. Fenwick. We can't turn around and go back in this\r\ngale, and we can't descend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what's to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, except to keep on until the gale blows itself out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how long will that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--a week, maybe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my coffee pot, I'm glad we've got plenty on board to eat!\"\r\nexclaimed Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA NIGHT OF TERROR\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the first shock of Tom's announcement, the two men, who were\r\ntraveling with him in the airship, showed no signs of fear. Yet it\r\nwas alarming to know that one was speeding over the mighty ocean,\r\nbefore a terrific gale, with nothing more substantial under one that\r\na comparatively frail airship.\r\n\r\nStill Mr. Damon knew Tom of old, and had confidence in his ability,\r\nand, while Mr. Fenwick was not so well acquainted with our hero, he\r\nhad heard much about him, and put faith in his skill to carry them\r\nout of their present difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you can't turn around and go back?\" asked Mr. Fenwick.\r\nHis knowledge of air-currents was rather limited.\r\n\r\n\"It is out of the question,\" replied Tom, simply. \"We would surely\r\nrip this craft to pieces if we attempted to buffet this storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it so bad, then?\" asked Mr. Damon, forgetting to bless anything\r\nin the tense excitement of the moment.\r\n\r\n\"It might be worse,\" was the reply of the young inventor. \"The wind\r\nis blowing about eighty miles an hour at times, and to try to turn\r\nnow would mean that we would tear the planes loose from the ship.\r\nTrue, we could still keep up by means of the gas bag, but even that\r\nmight be injured. Going as we are, in the same direction as that in\r\nwhich the wind is blowing, we do not feel the full effect of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, perhaps, if we went lower down, or higher up, we could get in\r\na different current of air,\" suggested Mr. Fenwick, who had made\r\nsome study of aeronautics.\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" assented Tom, simply. He shifted the elevating rudder,\r\nand the WHIZZER began to go up, slowly, for there was great lateral\r\npressure on her large surface. But Tom knew his business, and urged\r\nthe craft steadily. The powerful electric engines, which were the\r\ninvention of Mr. Fenwick, stood them in good stead, and the\r\nbarograph soon showed that they were steadily mounting.\r\n\r\n\"Is the wind pressure any less?\" inquired Mr. Damon, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, it seems to be increasing,\" replied Tom, with a\r\nglance at the anemometer. \"It's nearly ninety miles an hour now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, aided by the propellers, we must be making over a hundred\r\nmiles an hour.\" said the inventor.\r\n\r\n\"We are,--a hundred and thirty,\" assented Tom.\r\n\r\n\"We'll be blown across the ocean at this rate,\" exclaimed Mr. Damon.\r\n\"Bless my soul! I didn't count on that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we had better go down,\" suggested Mr. Fenwick. \"I don't\r\nbelieve we can get above the gale.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not,\" came from Tom. \"It may be a bit better down\r\nbelow.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the rudder was changed, and the WHIZZER pointed her\r\nnose downward. None of the lifting gas was let out, as it was\r\ndesired to save that for emergencies.\r\n\r\nDown, down, down, went the great airship, until the adventurers\r\nwithin, by gazing through the plate glass window in the floor of the\r\ncabin, could see the heaving, white-capped billows, tossing and\r\ntumbling below them.\r\n\r\n\"Look out, or we'll be into them!\" shouted Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we may as well go back to the level where we were,\"\r\ndeclared Tom. \"The wind, both above and below that particular strata\r\nis stronger, and we will be safer up above. Our only chance is to\r\nscud before it, until it has blown itself out. And I hope it will be\r\nsoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Mr. Damon, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Because we may be blown so far that we can not get back while our\r\npower holds out, and then--\" Tom did not finish, but Mr. Damon knew\r\nwhat he meant--death in the tossing ocean, far from land, when the\r\nWHIZZER, unable to float in the air any longer, should drop into the\r\nstorm-enraged Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThey were again on a level, where the gale blew less furiously than\r\neither above or below, but this was not much relief. It seemed as if\r\nthe airship would go to pieces, so much was it swayed and tossed\r\nabout. But Mr. Fenwick, if he had done nothing else, had made a\r\nstaunch craft, which stood the travelers in good stead.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of that day they swept on, at about the same speed.\r\nThere was nothing for them to do, save watch the machinery,\r\noccasionally replenishing the oil tanks, or making minor\r\nadjustments.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" finally remarked Mr. Damon, when the afternoon was waning\r\naway, \"if there's nothing else to do, suppose we eat. Bless my\r\nappetite, but I'm hungry! and I believe you said, Mr. Fenwick, that\r\nyou had plenty of food aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we have, but the excitement of being blown out to sea on our\r\nfirst real trip, made me forget all about it. I'll get dinner at\r\nonce, if you can put up with an amateur's cooking.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll help,\" offered Mr. Damon. \"Tom can attend to the airship,\r\nand we'll serve the meals. It will take our minds off our troubles.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a well equipped kitchen aboard the WHIZZER and soon savory\r\nodors were coming from it. In spite of the terror of their\r\nsituation, and it was not to be denied that they were in peril, they\r\nall made a good meal, though it was difficult to drink coffee and\r\nother liquids, owing to the sudden lurches which the airship gave\r\nfrom time to time as the gale tossed her to and fro.\r\n\r\nNight came, and, as the blackness settled down, the gale seemed to\r\nincrease in fury. It howled through the slender wire rigging of the\r\nWHIZZER, and sent the craft careening from side to side, and\r\nsometimes thrust her down into a cavern of the air, only to lift her\r\nhigh again, almost like a ship on the heaving ocean below them.\r\n\r\nAs darkness settled in blacker and blacker, Tom had a glimpse below\r\nhim, of tossing lights on the water.\r\n\r\n\"We just passed over some vessel,\" he announced. \"I hope they are in\r\nno worse plight than we are.\" Then, there suddenly came to him a\r\nthought of the parents of Mary Nestor, who were somewhere on the\r\nocean, in the yacht RESOLUTE bound for the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if they're out in this storm, too?\" mused Tom. \"If they\r\nare, unless the vessel is a staunch one, they may be in danger.\"\r\n\r\nThe thought of the parents of the girl he cared so much for being in\r\nperil, was not reassuring to Tom, and he began to busy himself about\r\nthe machinery of the airship, to take his mind from the presentiment\r\nthat something might happen to the RESOLUTE.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have our own troubles before morning,\" the lad mused, \"if\r\nthis wind doesn't die down.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no indication that this was going to be the case, for the\r\ngale increased rather than diminished. Tom looked at their speed\r\ngage. They were making a good ninety miles an hour, for it had been\r\ndecided that it was best to keep the engine and propellers going, as\r\nthey steadied the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Ninety miles an hour,\" murmured Tom. \"And we've been going at that\r\nrate for ten hours now. That's nearly a thousand miles. We are quite\r\na distance out to sea.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at a compass, and noted that, instead of being headed\r\ndirectly across the Atlantic they were bearing in a southerly\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"At this rate, we won't come far from getting to the West Indies\r\nourselves,\" reasoned the young inventor. \"But I think the gale will\r\ndie away before morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm did not, however. More fiercely it blew through the hours\r\nof darkness. It was a night of terror, for they dared not go to\r\nsleep, not knowing at what moment the ship might turn turtle, or\r\neven rend apart, and plunge with them into the depths of the sea.\r\n\r\nSo they sat up, occasionally attending to the machinery, and noting\r\nthe various gages. Mr. Damon made hot coffee, which they drank from\r\ntime to time, and it served to refresh them.\r\n\r\nThere came a sudden burst of fury from the storm, and the airship\r\nrocked as if she was going over.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my heart!\" cried Mr. Damon, springing up. \"That was a close\r\ncall!\"\r\n\r\nTom said nothing. Mr. Fenwick looked pale and alarmed.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed. They were swept ever onward, at about the same\r\nspeed, sometimes being whirled downward, and again tossed upward at\r\nthe will of the wind. The airship was well-nigh helpless, and Tom,\r\nas he realized their position, could not repress a fear in his heart\r\nas he thought of the parents of the girl he loved being tossed about\r\non the swirling ocean, in a frail pleasure yacht.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA DOWNWARD GLIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThey sat in the cabin of the airship, staring helplessly at each\r\nother. Occasionally Tom rose to attend to one of the machines, or\r\nMr. Fenwick did the same. Occasionally, Mr. Damon uttered a remark.\r\nThen there was silence, broken only by the howl of the gale.\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible for the WHIZZER to travel any faster, yet when\r\nTom glanced at the speed gage he noted, with a feeling of surprise,\r\nakin to horror, that they were making close to one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles an hour. Only an aeroplane could have done it, and then only\r\nwhen urged on by a terrific wind which added to the speed produced\r\nby the propellers.\r\n\r\nThe whole craft swayed and trembled, partly from the vibration of\r\nthe electrical machinery, and partly from the awful wind. Mr.\r\nFenwick came close to Tom, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it would be any use to try once more to go above or\r\nbelow the path of the storm?\"\r\n\r\nTom's first impulse was to say that it would be useless, but he\r\nrecollected that the craft belonged to Fenwick, and surely that\r\ngentleman had a right to make a suggestion. The young inventor\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\n\"We'll try to go up,\" he said. \"If that doesn't work, I'll see if I\r\ncan force her down. It will be hard work, though. The wind is too\r\nstiff.\"\r\n\r\nTom shifted the levers and rudders. His eyes were on the barograph--that\r\ndelicate instrument, the trembling hand of which registered\r\ntheir height. Tom had tilted the deflection rudder to send them up,\r\nbut as he watched the needle he saw it stationary. They were not\r\nascending, though the great airship was straining to mount to an\r\nupper current where there might be calm.\r\n\r\nIt was useless, however, and Tom, seeing the futility of it, shifted\r\nthe rudder to send them downward. This was more easily accomplished,\r\nbut it was a change for the worse, since, the nearer to the ocean\r\nthey went, the fiercer blew the wind.\r\n\r\n\"Back! Go back up higher!\" cried Mr. Damon,\r\n\r\n\"We can't!\" yelled Tom. \"We've got to stay here now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but this is awful!\" exclaimed Mr. Fenwick. \"We can never stand\r\nthis!\"\r\n\r\nThe airship swaged more than ever, and the occupants were tossed\r\nabout in the cabin, from side to side. Indeed, it did seem that\r\nhuman beings never could come alive out of that fearful ordeal.\r\n\r\nAs Tom looked from one of the windows of the cabin, he noted a pale,\r\ngrayish sort of light outside. At first he could not understand what\r\nit was, then, as he observed the sickly gleams of the incandescent\r\nelectric lamps, he knew that the hour of dawn was at hand.\r\n\r\n\"See!\" he exclaimed to his companions, pointing to the window.\r\n\"Morning is coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Morning!\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"Is the night over? Now, perhaps we\r\nshall get rid of the storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not,\" answered Tom, as he noted the anemometer and felt\r\nthe shudderings of the WHIZZER as she careened on through the gale.\r\n\"It hasn't blown out yet!\"\r\n\r\nThe pale light increased. The electrics seemed to dim and fade. Tom\r\nlooked to the engines. Some of the apparatus was in need of oil, and\r\nhe supplied it. When he came back to the main cabin, where stood Mr.\r\nDamon and Mr. Fenwick, it was much lighter outside.\r\n\r\n\"Less than a day since we left Philadelphia,\" murmured the owner of\r\nthe WHIZZER, as he glanced at a distance indicator, \"yet we have\r\ncome nearly sixteen hundred miles. We certainly did travel top\r\nspeed. I wonder where we are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still over the ocean,\" replied Mr. Damon, as he looked down at the\r\nheaving billows rolling amid crests of foam far below them. \"Though\r\nwhat part of it would be hard to say. We'll have to reckon out our\r\nposition when it gets calmer.\"\r\n\r\nTom came from the engine room. His face wore a troubled look, and he\r\nsaid, addressing the older inventor:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fenwick, I wish you'd come and look at the gas generating\r\napparatus. It doesn't seem to be working properly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything wrong?\" asked Mr. Damon, suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" replied Tom, with all the confidence he could muster.\r\n\"It may need adjusting. I am not so familiar with it as I am with\r\nthe one on the RED CLOUD. The gas seems to be escaping from the bag,\r\nand we may have to descend, for some distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the aeroplanes will keep us up,\" said Mr. Daman.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--they will,\" and Tom hesitated. \"That is, unless something\r\nhappens to them. They are rather frail to stand alone the brunt of\r\nthe gale, and I wish--\"\r\n\r\nTom did not complete the sentence. Instead, he paused suddenly and\r\nseemed to be intently listening.\r\n\r\nFrom without there came a rending, tearing, crashing sound. The\r\nairship quivered from end to end, and seemed to make a sudden dive\r\ndownward. Then it appeared to recover, and once more glided forward.\r\n\r\nTom, followed by Mr. Fenwick, made a rush for the compartment where\r\nthe machine was installed. They had no sooner reached it than there\r\nsounded an explosion, and the airship recoiled as if it had hit a\r\nstone wall.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my shaving brush! What's that?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Has\r\nanything happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm rather afraid there has,\" answered Tom, solemnly. \"It sounded\r\nas though the gas bag went up. And I'm worried over the strength of\r\nthe planes. We must make an investigation!\"\r\n\r\n\"We're falling!\" almost screamed Mr. Fenwick, as he glanced at the\r\nbarograph, the delicate needle of which was swinging to and fro,\r\nregistering different altitudes.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my feather bed! So we are!\" shouted Mr. Damon. \"Let's jump,\r\nand avoid being caught under the airship!\"\r\n\r\nHe darted for a large window, opening from the main cabin, and was\r\nendeavoring to raise it when Tom caught his hand.\r\n\r\n\"What are you trying to do,\" asked the lad, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"Save my life! I want to get out of this as soon as I can. I'm going\r\nto jump!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't think of it! You'd be instantly killed. We're too high for a\r\njump, even into the ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ocean! Oh, is that still below us? Is there any chance of being\r\nsaved? What can be done?\" Mr. Damon hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"We must first find out how badly we are damaged,\" said Tom,\r\nquietly. \"We must keep our heads, and be calm, no matter what\r\nhappens. I need your help, Mr. Damon.\"\r\n\r\nThis served to recall the rather excited man to his senses. He came\r\nback to the centre of the cabin, which was no easy task, for the\r\nfloor of it was tilted at first one angle, and then another. He\r\nstood at Tom's side.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do to help you?\" he asked. Mr. Fenwick was darting here\r\nand there, examining the different machines. None of them seemed to\r\nbe damaged.\r\n\r\n\"If you will look and see what has happened to our main wing planes,\r\nI will see how much gas we have left in the bag,\" suggested Tom.\r\n\"Then we can decide what is best to be done. We are still quite\r\nhigh, and it will take some time to complete our fall, as, even if\r\neverything is gone, the material of the bag will act as a sort of\r\nparachute.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Damon darted to a window in the rear of the cabin, where he\r\ncould obtain a glimpse of the main wing planes. He gave a cry of\r\nterror and astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Two of the planes are gone!\" he reported. \"They are torn and are\r\nhanging loose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feared as much,\" retorted Tom, quietly, \"The gale was too much\r\nfor them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of the lifting gas?\" asked Mr. Fenwick, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"It has nearly all flowed out of the retaining bag.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must make more at once. I will start the generating\r\nmachine.\"\r\n\r\nHe darted toward it.\r\n\r\n\"It will be useless,\" spoke Tom, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because there is no bag left to hold it. The silk and rubber\r\nenvelope has been torn to pieces by the gale. The wind is even\r\nstronger than it was last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what's to be done?\" demanded Mr. Damon, with a return of his\r\nalarmed and nervous manner. \"Bless my fingernails! What's to be\r\ndone?\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant Tom did not answer. It was constantly getting\r\nlighter, though there was no sun, for it was obscured by scudding\r\nclouds. The young inventor looked critically at the various gages\r\nand indicators.\r\n\r\n\"Is--is there any chance for us?\" asked Mr. Fenwick, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" answered Tom, with a hopeful smile. \"We have about two\r\nthousand feet to descend, for we have fallen nearly that distance\r\nsince the accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two thousand feet to fall!\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"We can never do it\r\nand live!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" spoke Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my gizzard! How?\" fairly exploded Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"By vol-planing down!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, even if we do, we will fall into the ocean!\" cried Mr.\r\nFenwick. \"We will be drowned!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" and Tom spoke more quietly than before. \"We are over a large\r\nisland.\" he went on, \"and I propose to let the disabled airship\r\nvol-plane down to it. That is our only chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Over an island!\" cried Mr. Damon. He looked down through the floor\r\nobservation window. Tom had spoken truly. At that moment they were\r\nover a large island, which had suddenly loomed up in the wild and\r\ndesolate waste of the ocean. They had reached its vicinity just in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTom stepped to the steering and rudder levers, and took charge. He\r\nwas going to attempt a most difficult feat--that of guiding a\r\ndisabled airship back to earth in the midst of a hurricane, and\r\nlanding her on an unknown island. Could he do it?\r\n\r\nThere was but one answer. He must try. It was the only chance of\r\nsaving their lives, and a slim one at best.\r\n\r\nDown shot the damaged WHIZZER like some giant bird with broken\r\nwings, but Tom Swift was in charge, and it seemed as if the craft\r\nknew it, as she began that earthward glide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nMingled feelings possessed the three adventurers within the airship.\r\nMr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick had crowded to the window, as Tom spoke,\r\nto get a glimpse of the unknown island toward which they were\r\nshooting. They could see it more plainly now, from the forward\r\ncasement, as well as from the one in the bottom of the craft. A\r\nlong, narrow, rugged piece of land it was, in the midst of the\r\nheaving ocean, for the storm still raged and lashed the waves to\r\nfoam.\r\n\r\n\"Can you make it?\" asked Mr. Damon, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" answered Tom, more cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I shut down the motor?\" inquired the older inventor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you might as well. We don't need the propellers now, and I may\r\nbe better able to make the glide without them.\"\r\n\r\nThe buzzing and purring electrical apparatus was shut down. Silence\r\nreigned in the airship, but the wind still howled outside. As Tom\r\nhad hoped, the ship became a little more steady with the stopping of\r\nthe big curved blades, though had the craft been undamaged they\r\nwould have served to keep her on an even keel.\r\n\r\nWith skillful hand he so tilted the elevating planes that, after a\r\nswift downward glide, the head of the WHIZZER would be thrown up, so\r\nto speak, and she would sail along in a plane parallel to the\r\nisland. This had the effect of checking her momentum, just as the\r\naviator checks the downward rush of his monoplane or biplane when he\r\nis making a landing.\r\n\r\nTom repeated this maneuver several times, until a glance at his\r\nbarograph showed that they had but a scant sixty feet to go. There\r\nwas time but for one more upward throwing of the WHIZZER's nose, and\r\nTom held to that position as long as possible. They could now make\r\nout the topography of the island plainly, for it was much lighter.\r\nTom saw a stretch of sandy beach, and steered for that.\r\n\r\nDownward shot the airship, inert and lifeless. It was not like\r\ngliding his little BUTTERFLY to earth after a flight, but Tom hoped\r\nhe could make it. They were now within ten feet of the earth,\r\nskimming forward. Tom tried another upward tilt, but the forward\r\nplanes would not respond. They could get no grip on the air.\r\n\r\nWith a crash that could have been heard some distance the WHIZZER\r\nsettled to the sand. It ran along a slight distance, and then, as\r\nthe bicycle wheels collapsed under the pressure, the airship seemed\r\nto go together in a shapeless mass.\r\n\r\nAt the first impact with the earth, Tom had leaped away from the\r\nsteering wheel and levers, for he did not want to be crushed against\r\nthem. Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick, in pursuance of a plan adopted when\r\nthey found that they were falling, had piled a lot of seat cushions\r\naround them. They had also provided some as buffers for Tom, and our\r\nhero, at the instant of the crash, had thrown himself behind and\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the whole ship went to pieces. The top of the main\r\ncabin crashed down, as the side supports gave way, but, fortunately,\r\nthere were strong main braces, and the roof did not fall completely\r\nupon our friends.\r\n\r\nThe whole bottom of the craft was forced upward and had it not been\r\nfor the protecting cushions, there might have been serious injuries\r\nfor all concerned. As it was they were badly bruised and shaken up.\r\n\r\nAfter the first crash, and succeeding it an instant later, there\r\ncame a second smash, followed by a slight explosion, and a shower of\r\nsparks could be seen in the engine room.\r\n\r\n\"That's the electrical apparatus smashing through the floor!\" called\r\nTom. \"Come, let's get out of here before the gasolene sets anything\r\non fire. Are you all right, Mr. Damon, and you, Mr. Fenwick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess so,\" answered the inventor. \"Oh, what a terrible\r\ncrash! My airship is ruined!\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be glad we are alive,\" said Mr. Damon. \"Bless my top knot,\r\nI feel--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence. At that moment a piece of wood,\r\nbroken from the ceiling, where it had hung by a strip of canvas came\r\ncrashing down, and hit Mr. Damon on the head.\r\n\r\nThe eccentric man toppled over on his pile of cushions, from which\r\nhe was arising when he was struck.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is he killed?\" gasped Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"I hope not!\" cried Tom. \"We must get him out of here, at all\r\nevents. There may be a fire.\"\r\n\r\nThey both sprang to Mr. Damon's aid, and succeeded in lifting him\r\nout. There was no difficulty in emerging from the airship as there\r\nwere big, broken gaps, on all sides of what was left of the cabin.\r\nOnce in the outer air Mr. Damon revived, and opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Much hurt?\" asked Tom, feeling of his friend's head.\r\n\r\n\"No--no, I--I guess not,\" was the slow answer. \"I was stunned for a\r\nmoment. I'm all right now. Nothing broken, I guess,\" and his hand\r\nwent to his head.\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing broken,\" added Tom, cheerfully, \"but you've got a lump\r\nthere as big as an ostrich egg. Can you walk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm all right. Bless my stars, what a wreck!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Damon looked at the remains of the airship. It certainly was a\r\nwreck! The bent and twisted planes were wrapped about the afterpart,\r\nthe gas bag was but a shred, the frame was splintered and twisted,\r\nand the under part, where the starting wheels were placed, resembled\r\na lot of broken bicycles. The cabin looked like a shack that had\r\nsustained an explosion of dynamite.\r\n\r\n\"It's a wonder we came out alive,\" said Mr. Fenwick, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed it is,\" agreed Tom, as he came back with a tin can full of\r\nsea water, with which to bathe Mr. Damon's head. The lad had picked\r\nup the can from where it had rolled from the wreck, and they had\r\nlanded right on the beach.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't seem to blow so hard,\" observed Mr. Damon, as he was\r\ntenderly sopping his head with a handkerchief wet in the salt water.\r\n\r\n\"No, the wind is dying out, but it happened too late to do us any\r\ngood,\" remarked Tom, sorrowfully. \"Though if it hadn't blown us this\r\nfar, we might have come to grief over the ocean, and be floundering\r\nin that, instead of on dry land.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" agreed Mr. Fenwick, who was carefully feeling of some\r\nbruises on his legs. \"I wonder where we are, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the least idea,\" responded Tom. \"It's an island, but\r\nwhich one, or where it is I don't know. We were blown nearly two\r\nthousand miles, I judge.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked over and surveyed the wreck. Now that the excitement was\r\nover he was beginning to be aware of numerous bruises and\r\ncontusions, His legs felt rather queer, and on rolling up his\r\ntrousers he found there was a deep cut in the right shin, just below\r\nhis knee. It was bleeding, but he bandaged it with a spare\r\nhandkerchief, and walked on.\r\n\r\nPeering about, he saw that nearly the whole of the machinery in the\r\nengine room, including most of the electrical apparatus, had fallen\r\nbodily through the floor, and now rested on the sand.\r\n\r\n\"That looks to be in pretty good shape.\" mused Tom, \"but it's a\r\nquestion whether it will ever be any good to us. We can't rebuild\r\nthe airship here, that's certain.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked about the wreck, and then returned to his friends. Mr.\r\nDamon was more like himself, and Mr. Fenwick had discovered that he\r\nhad only minor bruises.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my coffee cup!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"I declare, I feel\r\nhungry. I wonder if there's anything left to eat in the wreck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty,\" spoke Tom, cheerfully. \"I'll get it out. I can eat a\r\nsandwich or too myself, and perhaps I can set up the gasolene stove,\r\nand cook something.\"\r\n\r\nAs the young inventor was returning to the wreck, he was halted\r\nhalfway by a curious trembling feeling. At first he thought it was a\r\nweakness of his legs, caused by his cut, but a moment later he\r\nrealized with a curious, sickening sensation that it was the ground--the\r\nisland itself--that was shaking and trembling.\r\n\r\nThe lad turned back. Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick were staring after\r\nhim with fear showing on their faces.\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\" cried the inventor.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my gizzard! Did you feel that, Tom?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"The\r\nwhole place is shaking!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was a stronger tremor now, and it was accompanied by a\r\nlow, rumbling sound, like distant thunder. The adventurers were\r\nswaying to and fro.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they were tossed to the ground by a swaying motion, and not\r\nfar off a great crack opened in the earth. The roaring, rumbling\r\nsound increased in volume.\r\n\r\n\"An earthquake! It's an earthquake!\" cried Tom. \"We're in the midst\r\nof an earthquake!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA NIGHT IN CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rumbling and roaring continued for perhaps two minutes, during\r\nwhich time the castaways found it impossible to stand, for the\r\nisland was shaking under their feet with a sickening motion. Off to\r\none side there was a great fissure in the earth, and, frightened as\r\nhe was, Tom looked to see if it was extending in their direction.\r\n\r\nIf it was, or if a crack opened near them, they might be\r\nprecipitated into some bottomless abyss, or into the depths of the\r\nsea. But the fissure did not increase in length or breadth, and,\r\npresently the rumbling, roaring sound subsided. The island grew\r\nquiet and the airship travelers rose to their feet.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my very existence! What happened?\" cried Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"It was an earthquake; wasn't it, Tom?\" asked Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"It sure was,\" agreed the young inventor. \"Rather a hard one, too. I\r\nhope we don't have any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think there is any likelihood of it?\" demanded Mr. Damon.\r\n\"Bless my pocketbook! If I thought so I'd leave at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where would you go?\" inquired Tom, looking out across the tumbling\r\nocean, which had hardly had a chance to subside from the gale, ere\r\nit was again set in a turmoil by the earth-tremor.\r\n\r\n\"That's so--there isn't a place to escape to,\" went on the eccentric\r\nman, with something like a groan. \"We are in a bad place--do you\r\nthink there'll be more quakes, Tom?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's hard to say. I don't know where we are, and this island may be\r\nsomething like Japan, subject to quakes, or it may be that this one\r\nis merely a spasmodic tremor. Perhaps the great storm which brought\r\nus here was part of the disturbance of nature which ended up with\r\nthe earthquake. We may have no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there may be one at any time,\" added Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" assented Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Then let's get ready for it,\" proposed Mr. Damon. \"Let's take all\r\nthe precautions possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"There aren't any to take,\" declared Tom. \"All we can do is to wait\r\nuntil the shocks come--if any more do come, which I hope won't\r\nhappen, and then we must do the best we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear me! Bless my fingernails!\" cried Mr. Damon, wringing his\r\nhands. \"This is worse than falling in an airship! There you do have\r\nSOME chance. Here you haven't any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it may not be so bad,\" Tom cried to reassure him. \"This may\r\nhave been the first shock in a hundred years, and there may never be\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as he looked around on the island, he noted evidences that it\r\nwas of volcanic origin, and his heart misgave him, for he knew that\r\nsuch islands, created suddenly by a submarine upheaval, might just\r\nas suddenly be destroyed by an earthquake, or by sinking into the\r\nocean. It was not a pleasant thought--it was like living over a\r\nmine, that might explode at any moment. But there was no help for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTom tried to assume a cheerfulness he did not feel. He realized\r\nthat, in spite of his youth, both Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick rather\r\ndepended on him, for Tom was a lad of no ordinary attainments, and\r\nhad a fund of scientific knowledge. He resolved to do his best to\r\navoid making his two companions worry.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get it off our minds,\" suggested the lad, after a while. \"We\r\nwere going to get something to eat. Suppose we carry out that\r\nprogram. My appetite wasn't spoiled by the shock.\"\r\n\r\n\"I declare mine wasn't either,\" said Mr. Damon, \"but I can't forget\r\nit easily. It's the first earthquake I was ever in.\"\r\n\r\nHe watched Tom as the latter advanced once more toward the wreck of\r\nthe airship, and noticed that the lad limped, for his right leg had\r\nbeen cut when the WHIZZER had fallen to earth.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Tom; were you hurt in the quake?\" asked the\r\neccentric man.\r\n\r\n\"No--no,\" Tom hastened to assure him. \"I just got a bump in the\r\nfall--that's all. It isn't anything. If you and Mr. Fenwick want to\r\nget out some food from the wrecked store room I'll see if I can haul\r\nout the gasolene stove from the airship. Perhaps we can use it to\r\nmake some coffee.\"\r\n\r\nBy delving in about the wreck, Tom was able to get out the gasolene\r\nstove. It was broken, but two of the five burners were in\r\ncommission, and could be used. Water, and gasolene for use in the\r\nairship, was carried in steel tanks. Some of these had been split\r\nopen by the crash, but there was one cask of water left, and three\r\nof gasolene, insuring plenty of the liquid fuel. As for the water,\r\nTom hoped to be able to find a spring on the island.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick had been investigating\r\nthe contents of the storeroom. There was a large supply of food,\r\nmuch larger than would have been needed, even on a two weeks' trip\r\nin the air, and the inventor of the WHIZZER hardly knew why he had\r\nput so much aboard.\r\n\r\n\"But if we have to stay here long, it may come in handy,\" observed\r\nTom, with a grim smile.\r\n\r\n\"Why; do you think we WILL be here long?\" asked Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\nThe young inventor shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"There is no telling,\" he said. \"If a passing steamer happens to see\r\nus, we may be taken off to-day or to-morrow. If not we may be here a\r\nweek, or--\" Tom did not finish. He stood in a listening attitude.\r\n\r\nThere was a rumbling sound, and the earth seemed again to tremble.\r\nThen there came a great splash in the water at the foot of a tall,\r\nrugged cliff about a quarter of a mile away. A great piece of the\r\nprecipice had fallen into the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"I thought that was another earthquake coming,\" said Mr. Damon, with\r\nan air of relief.\r\n\r\n\"So did I,\" admitted Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"It was probably loosened by the shock, and so fell into the sea,\"\r\nspoke Tom.\r\n\r\nTheir momentary fright over, the castaways proceeded to get their\r\nbreakfast. Tom soon had water boiling on the gasolene stove, for he\r\nhad rescued a tea-kettle and a coffee pot from the wreck of the\r\nkitchen of the airship. Shortly afterward, the aroma of coffee\r\nfilled the air, and a little later there was mingled with it the\r\nappetizing odor of sizzling bacon and eggs, for Mr. Fenwick, who was\r\nvery fond of the latter, had brought along a supply, carefully\r\npacked in sawdust carriers, so that the shock had broken only a few\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I call this a fine breakfast,\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, munching\r\nhis bacon and eggs, and dipping into his coffee the hard pilot\r\nbiscuit, which they had instead of bread. \"We're mighty lucky to be\r\neating at all, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed we are,\" chimed in Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"I'm awfully sorry the airship is wrecked, though,\" spoke Tom. \"I\r\nsuppose it's my fault. I should have turned back before we got over\r\nthe ocean, and while the storm was not at its height. I saw that the\r\nwind was freshening, but I never supposed it would grow to a gale so\r\nsuddenly. The poor old WHIZZER--there's not much left of her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't distress yourself in the least,\" insisted Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\"I'm proud to have built a ship that could navigate at all. I see\r\nwhere I made lots of mistakes, and as soon as I get back to\r\nPhiladelphia, I'm going to build a better one, if you'll help me,\r\nTom Swift.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly will,\" promised the young inventor.\r\n\r\n\"And I'll take a voyage with you!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Bless my\r\nteaspoon, Tom, but will you kindly pass the bacon and eggs again!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a jolly laugh at the eccentric man, in which he himself\r\njoined, and the little party felt better. They were seated on bits\r\nof broken boxes taken from the wreck, forming a little circle about\r\nthe gasolene stove, which Tom had set up on the beach. The wind had\r\nalmost entirely died away, though the sea was still heaving in great\r\nbillows, and masses of surf.\r\n\r\nThey had no exact idea of the time, for all their watches had\r\nstopped when the shock of the wreck came, but presently the sun\r\npeeped out from the clouds, and, from knowing the time when they had\r\nbegun to fall, they judged it was about ten o'clock, and accordingly\r\nset their timepieces.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" observed Tom, as he collected the dishes, which they had\r\nalso secured from the wreck, \"we must begin to think about a place\r\nto spend the night. I think we can rig up a shelter from some of the\r\ncanvas of the wing-planes, and from what is left of the cabin. It\r\ndoesn't need to be very heavy, for from the warmth of the\r\natmosphere, I should say we were pretty well south.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite warm, now that the storm was over, and, as they looked\r\nat the vegetation of the island, they saw that it was almost wholly\r\ntropical.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't be surprised if we were on one of the smaller of the\r\nWest Indian islands,\" said Tom. \"We certainly came far enough,\r\nflying a hundred miles or more an hour, to have reached them. But\r\nthis one doesn't appear to be inhabited.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't been all over it yet,\" said Mr. Damon. \"We may find\r\ncannibals on the other side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cannibals don't live in this part of the world,\" Tom assured him.\r\n\"No, I think this island is practically unknown. The storm brought\r\nus here, and it might have landed us in a worse place.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he thought of the yacht RESOLUTE, and he wondered how\r\nher passengers, including the parents of Mary Nestor, had fared\r\nduring the terrible blow.\r\n\r\n\"I hope they weren't wrecked, as we were,\" mused Tom.\r\n\r\nBut there was little time for idle thoughts. If they were going to\r\nbuild a shelter, they knew that they must speedily get at it.\r\nAccordingly, with a feeling of thankfulness that their lives had\r\nbeen spared, they set to work taking apart such of the wreck as\r\ncould the more easily be got at.\r\n\r\nBoards, sticks, and planks were scattered about, and, with the\r\npieces of canvas from the wing-planes, and some spare material which\r\nwas carried on board, they soon had a fairly good shack, which would\r\nbe protection enough in that warm climate.\r\n\r\nNext they got out the food and supplies, their spare clothing and\r\nother belongings, few of which had been harmed in the fall from the\r\nclouds. These things were piled under another rude shelter which\r\nthey constructed.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was three o'clock, and they ate again. Then they\r\nprepared to spend the night in their hastily made camp. They\r\ncollected driftwood, with which to make a fire, and, after supper,\r\nwhich was prepared on the gasolene stove, they sat about the\r\ncheerful blaze, discussing their adventures.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow we will explore the island,\" said Tom, as he rolled\r\nhimself up in his blankets and turned over to sleep. The others\r\nfollowed his example, for it was decided that no watch need be kept.\r\nThus passed several hours in comparative quiet.\r\n\r\nIt must have been about midnight that Tom was suddenly awakened by a\r\nfeeling as if someone was shaking him. He sat up quickly and called\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh? What's that? Bless my soul! What's going on?\" shouted Mr.\r\nDamon.\r\n\r\n\"Did you shake me?\" inquired Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I? No. What--?\"\r\n\r\nThen they realized that another earth-tremor was making the whole\r\nisland tremble.\r\n\r\nTom leaped from his blankets, followed by Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick,\r\nand rushed outside the shack. They felt the earth shaking, but it\r\nwas over in a few seconds. The shock was a slight one, nothing like\r\nas severe as the one in the morning. But it set their nerves on\r\nedge.\r\n\r\n\"Another earthquake!\" groaned Mr. Damon. \"How often are we to have\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Tom, soberly.\r\n\r\nThey passed the remainder of the night sleeping in blankets on the\r\nwarm sands, near the fire, for they feared lest a shock might bring\r\nthe shack down about their heads. However, the night passed with no\r\nmore terrors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE OTHER CASTAWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're all alive, at any rate,\" announced Tom, when the bright\r\nsun, shining into his eyes, had awakened him. He sat up, tossed\r\naside his blankets, and stood up. The day was a fine one, and the\r\nviolence of the sea had greatly subsided during the night, their\r\nshack had suffered not at all from the slight shock in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Now for a dip in old Briney,\" the lad added, as he walked down to\r\nthe surf, \"I think it will make me feel better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm with you,\" added Mr. Fenwick, and Mr. Damon also joined the\r\nbathers. They came up from the waves, tingling with health, and\r\ntheir bruises and bumps, including Tom's cut leg, felt much better.\r\n\r\n\"You did get quite a gash; didn't you,\" observed Mr. Fenwick, as he\r\nnoticed Tom's leg. \"Better put something on it. I have antiseptic\r\ndressings and bandages in the airship, if we can find them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll look for them, after breakfast,\" Tom promised, and following a\r\nfairly substantial meal, considering the exigencies under which it\r\nwas prepared, he got out the medicine chest, of which part remained\r\nin the wreck of the WHIZZER, and dressed his wound. He felt much\r\nbetter after that.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's our program for to-day?\" Mr. Damon wanted to know, as\r\nthey sat about, after they had washed up what few dishes they used.\r\n\r\n\"Let's make a better house to stay in,\" proposed Mr. Fenwick. \"We\r\nmay have to remain here for some time, and I'd like a more\r\nsubstantial residence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the one we now have will do,\" suggested Tom. \"I was going\r\nto propose making it even less substantial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, in the event of an earthquake, while we are sleeping in\r\nit, we will not be injured. Made of light pieces of wood and canvas\r\nit can't harm us very much if it falls on us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" agreed Mr. Damon. \"In earthquake countries all the\r\nhouses are low, and built of light materials.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! So I recollect now,\" spoke Mr. Fenwick. \"I used to read that in\r\nmy geography, but I never thought it would apply to me. But do you\r\nthink we will be subject to the quakes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so,\" was Tom's reply. \"We've had two, now, within a\r\nshort time, and there is no way of telling when the next will come.\r\nWe will hope there won't be any more, but--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not finish his sentence, but the others knew what he meant.\r\nThereupon they fell to work, and soon had made a shelter that, while\r\nvery light and frail, would afford them all the protection needed in\r\nthat mild climate, and, at the same time, there would be no danger\r\nshould an earthquake collapse it, and bring it down about their\r\nheads while they were sleeping in it.\r\n\r\nFor they decided that they needed some shelter from the night dews,\r\nas it was exceedingly uncomfortable to rest on the sands even\r\nwrapped in blankets, and with a driftwood fire burning nearby.\r\n\r\nIt was noon when they had their shack rebuilt to their liking, and\r\nthey stopped for dinner. There was quite a variety of stores in the\r\nairship, enough for a much larger party than that of our three\r\nfriends, and they varied their meals as much as possible. Of course\r\nall the stuff they had was canned, though there are some salted and\r\nsmoked meats. But canned food can be had in a variety of forms\r\nnow-a-days, so the castaways did not lack much.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say to an exploring expedition this afternoon?\" asked\r\nTom, as they sat about after dinner. \"We ought to find out what kind\r\nof an island we're on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you,\" came from Mr. Fenwick. \"Perhaps on the other\r\nside we will stand a much better chance of speaking some passing\r\nvessel. I have been watching the horizon for some time, now, but I\r\nhaven't seen the sign of a ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then we'll explore, and see what sort of an island we\r\nhave taken possession of,\" went on Tom.\r\n\r\n\"And see if it isn't already in possession of natives--or\r\ncannibals,\" suggested Mr. Damon. \"Bless my frying pan! but I should\r\nhate to be captured by cannibals at my time of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry; there are none here,\" Tom assured him again.\r\n\r\nThey set out on their journey around the island. They agreed that it\r\nwould be best to follow the beach around, as it was easier walking\r\nthat way, since the interior of the place consisted of rugged rocks\r\nin a sort of miniature mountain chain.\r\n\r\n\"We will make a circuit of the place,\" proposed Tom, \"and then, if\r\nwe can discover nothing, we'll go inland. The centre of the island\r\nis quite high, and we ought to be able to see in any direction for a\r\ngreat distance from the topmost peak. We may be able to signal a\r\nvessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I want to send word home that I am\r\nall right. My wife will worry when she learns that the airship, in\r\nwhich I set out, has disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy we all would like to send word home,\" added Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\"My wife never wanted me to build this airship, and, now that I have\r\nsailed in it, and have been wrecked, I know she'll say 'I told you\r\nso,' as soon as I get back to Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\nTom said nothing, but he thought to himself that it might be some\r\ntime before Mrs. Fenwick would have a chance to utter those\r\nsignificant words to her husband.\r\n\r\nFollowing the beach line, they walked for several miles. The island\r\nwas larger than they had supposed, and it soon became evident that\r\nit would take at least a day to get all around it.\r\n\r\n\"In which case we will need some lunch with us.\" said Tom. \"I think\r\nthe best thing we can do now is to return to camp, and get ready for\r\na longer expedition to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fenwick was of the same mind, but Mr. Damon called out:\r\n\r\n\"Let's go just beyond that cliff, and see what sort of a view is to\r\nbe had from there. Then we'll turn back.\"\r\n\r\nTo oblige him they followed. They had not gone more than a hundred\r\nyards toward the cliff, than there came the preliminary rumbling and\r\nroaring that they had come to associate with an earthquake. At the\r\nsame time, the ground began to shiver and shake.\r\n\r\n\"Here comes another one!\" cried Tom, reeling about. He saw Mr. Damon\r\nand Mr. Fenwick topple to the beach. The roaring increased, and the\r\nrumbling was like thunder, close at hand. The island seemed to rock\r\nto its very centre.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the whole cliff toward which they had been walking,\r\nappeared to shake itself loose. In another instant it was flung\r\noutward and into the sea, a great mass of rock and stone.\r\n\r\nThe island ceased trembling, and the roaring stopped. Tom rose to\r\nhis feet, followed by his companions. He looked toward the place\r\nwhere the cliff had been. Its removal by the earthquake gave them a\r\nview of a part of the beach that had hitherto been hidden from them.\r\n\r\nAnd what Tom saw caused him to cry out in astonishment. For he\r\nbeheld, gathered around a little fire on the sand, a party of men\r\nand women. Some were standing, clinging to one another in terror.\r\nSome were prostrate on the ground. Others were running to and fro in\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"More castaways!\" cried Tom. \"More castaways,\" and, he added under\r\nhis breath, \"more unfortunates on earthquake island!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nAN ALARMING THEORY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds, following Tom's announcement to his two\r\ncompanions, neither Mr. Damon nor Mr. Fenwick spoke. They had arisen\r\nfrom the beach, where the shock of the earthquake had thrown them,\r\nand were now staring toward the other band of castaways, who, in\r\nturn were gazing toward our three friends. There was a violent\r\nagitation in the sea, caused by the fall of the great cliff, and\r\nimmense waves rushed up on shore, but all the islanders were beyond\r\nthe reach of the rollers.\r\n\r\n\"Is it--do I really--am I dreaming or not?\" at length gasped Mr.\r\nDamon.\r\n\r\n\"Is this a mirage, or do we really see people, Tom?\" inquired Mr.\r\nFenwick.\r\n\r\n\"They are real enough people,\" replied the lad, himself somewhat\r\ndazed by the unexpected appearance of the other castaways.\r\n\r\n\"But how--why--how did they get here?\" went on the inventor of the\r\nWHIZZER.\r\n\r\n\"As long as they're not cannibals, we're all right,\" murmured Mr.\r\nDamon. \"They seem to be persons like ourselves, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are,\" agreed the lad, \"and they appear to be in the same sort\r\nof trouble as ourselves. Let's go forward, and meet them.\"\r\n\r\nThe tremor of the earthquake had now subsided, and the little band\r\nthat was gathered about a big fire of driftwood was calmer. Those\r\nwho had fallen, or who had thrown themselves on the sand, arose, and\r\nbegan feeling of their arms and legs to see if they had sustained\r\nany injuries. Others advanced toward our friends.\r\n\r\n\"Nine of them,\" murmured Tom, as he counted the little band of\r\ncastaways, \"and they don't seem to have been able to save much from\r\nthe wreck of their craft, whatever it was.\" The beach all about them\r\nwas bare, save for a boat drawn up out of reach of high water.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose they are a party from some disabled airship, Tom,\"\r\nasked Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"Not from an airship,\" answered the lad. \"Probably from some vessel\r\nthat was wrecked in the gale. But we will soon find out who they\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\nTom led the way for his two friends. The fall of the cliff had made\r\na rugged path around the base of it, over rocks, to where the other\r\npeople stood. Tom scrambled in and out among the boulders, in spite\r\nof the pain it caused his wounded leg. He was anxious to know who\r\nthe other castaways were, and how they had come there.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the larger party were now advancing to meet the lad and\r\nhis friends. Tom could see two women and seven men.\r\n\r\nA moment later, when the lad had a good view of one of the ladies\r\nand a gentleman, he could not repress a cry of astonishment. Then he\r\nrubbed his eyes to make sure it was not some blur or defect of\r\nvision. No, his first impression had been correct.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Nestor!\" cried Tom, recognizing the father of his girl friend.\r\n\"And Mrs. Nestor!\" he added a moment later.\r\n\r\n\"Why--of all things--look--Amos--it's--it can't be possible--and\r\nyet--why, it's Tom Swift!\" cried the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Tom--Tom Swift--here?\" ejaculated the man at her side.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--Tom Swift--the young inventor--of Shopton--don't you know--the\r\nlad who saved Mary's life in the runaway--Tom Swift!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom Swift!\" murmured Mr. Nestor. \"Is it possible!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm Tom Swift, all right,\" answered the owner of that name, \"but\r\nhow in the world did you get on this island, Mr. Nestor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I might ask you the same thing, Tom. The yacht RESOLUTE, on which\r\nwe were making a voyage to the West Indies, as guests of Mr. George\r\nHosbrook, was wrecked in the awful gale. We took to the boats and\r\nmanaged to reach this island. The yacht sunk, and we only had a\r\nlittle food. We are almost starved! But how came you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fenwick's airship was wrecked, and we dropped down here. What a\r\ncoincidence! To think that I should meet you here! But if you're\r\nhungry, it's the best thing in the world that we met you, for,\r\nthough our airship was wrecked, we have a large supply of food. Come\r\nover to our camp, and we'll give you all you want!\"\r\n\r\nTom had rushed forward, and was shaking hands with Mary's parents,\r\nso unexpectedly met with, when Mr. Nestor called out:\r\n\r\n\"Come over here, Mr. Hosbrook. I want you to meet a friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later, the millionaire owner of the ill-fated RESOLUTE was\r\nshaking hands with Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand it,\" Mr. Hosbrook said. \"To think of meeting\r\nother people on this desolate island--this island of earthquakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please don't speak of earthquakes!\" cried Mrs. Nestor. \"We are\r\nin mortal terror! There have been several since we landed in the\r\nmost terrible storm day before yesterday. Isn't it awful! It is a\r\nregular earthquake island!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I call it,\" spoke Tom, grimly.\r\n\r\nThe others of the larger party of refugees now came up. Besides Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Nestor, and Mr. Hosbrook, there was Mr. and Mrs. Floyd\r\nAnderson, friends of the millionaire; Mr. Ralph Parker, who was\r\nspoken of as a scientist, Mr. Barcoe Jenks, who seemed an odd sort\r\nof individual, always looking about suspiciously, Captain Mentor,\r\nwho had been in command of the yacht, and Jake Fordam, the mate of\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\n\"And are these all who were saved?\" asked Tom, as he introduced his\r\ntwo friends, and told briefly of their air voyage.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Mr. Hosbrook, \"two other boatloads, one containing\r\nmost of the crew, and the other containing some of my guests, got\r\naway before our boat left. I trust they have been rescued, but we\r\nhave heard nothing about them. However, our own lives may not long\r\nbe safe, if these earthquakes continue.\"\r\n\r\n\"But did I understand you to say, Mr. Swift, that you had food?\" he\r\nwent on. \"If you have, I will gladly pay you any price for some,\r\nespecially for these two ladies, who must be faint. I have lost all\r\nmy ready cash, but if we ever reach civilization, I will--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't speak of such a thing as pay,\" interrupted Mr. Fenwick. \"All\r\nthat we have we'll gladly share with you. Come over to our camp. We\r\nhave enough for all, and we can cook on our gasolene stove. Don't\r\nspeak of pay, I beg of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--er, if Mr. Hosbrook has no money, perhaps I can offer an\r\nequivalent,\" broke in the man who had been introduced as Barcoe\r\nJenks. \"I have--er--some securities--\" He stopped and looked about\r\nindefinitely, as though he did not know exactly what to say, and he\r\nwas fumbling at a belt about his waist; a belt that might contain\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\n\"Don't speak of reimbursing us,\" went on Mr. Fenwick, with rather a\r\nsuspicious glance at Mr. Jenks. \"You are welcome to whatever we\r\nhave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my topknot; certainly, yes!\" joined in Mr. Damon, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I--er--I only spoke of it,\" said Mr. Jenks, hesitatingly, and\r\nthen he turned away. Mr. Hosbrook looked sharply at him, but said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we go to our camp,\" proposed Tom. \"We may be able to get\r\nyou up a good meal, before another earthquake comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what makes so many of them?\" asked Mrs. Nestor, with a\r\nnervous shiver.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, they are terrifying! One never knows when to expect\r\nthem,\" added Mrs. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\"I have a theory about them,\" said Mr. Parker, the scientist, who,\r\nup to this time had spoken but little.\r\n\r\n\"A theory?\" inquired Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. This island is one of the smaller of the West Indies group. It\r\nis little known, and has seldom been visited, I believe. But I am\r\nsure that what causes the earthquakes is that the whole island has\r\nbeen undermined by the sea, and it is the wash of great submarine\r\nwaves and currents which cause the tremors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undermined by the sea?\" repeated Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It is being slowly washed away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my soul! Washed away!\" gasped Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"And, in the course of a comparatively short time, it will sink,\"\r\nwent on the scientist, as cheerfully as though he was a professor\r\npropounding some problem to his class.\r\n\r\n\"Sink!\" ejaculated Mrs. Nestor. \"The whole island undermined! Oh,\r\nwhat an alarming theory!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could hold to a different one, madam,\" was Mr. Parker's\r\nanswer, \"but I cannot. I think the island will sink after a few more\r\nshocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what good will my--\" began Barcoe Jenks, but he stopped in\r\nconfusion, and again his hand went to his belt with a queer gesture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA MIGHTY SHOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Swift turned to gaze at Mr. Barcoe Jenks. That individual\r\ncertainly had a strange manner. Perhaps it might be caused by the\r\nterror of the earthquakes, but the man seemed to be trying to hold\r\nback some secret. He was constrained and ill at ease. He saw the\r\nyoung inventor looking at him, and his hands, which had gone to his\r\nbelt, with a spasmodic motion, dropped to his side.\r\n\r\n\"You don't really mean to say, Parker, that you think the whole\r\nisland is undermined, do you?\" asked the owner of the RESOLUTE.\r\n\r\n\"That's my theory. It may be a wrong one, but it is borne out by the\r\nfacts already presented to us. I greatly fear for our lives!\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can we do?\" cried Mrs. Nestor.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" answered the scientist, with a shrug of his shoulders.\r\n\"Absolutely nothing, save to wait for it to happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that!\" begged Mrs. Andersen.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you gentlemen do something--build a boat and take us away.\r\nWhy, the boat we came here in--\"\r\n\r\n\"Struck a rock, and stove a hole in the bottom as big as a barrel,\r\nmadam,\" interrupted Captain Mentor. \"It would never do to put to sea\r\nin that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can't something else be done?\" demanded Mrs. Nestor. \"Oh, it is\r\nawful to think of perishing on this terrible earthquake island. Oh,\r\nAmos! Think of it, and Mary home alone! Have you seen her lately,\r\nMr. Swift?\"\r\n\r\nTom told of his visit to the Nestors' home. Our hero was almost in\r\ndespair, not so much for himself, as for the unfortunate women of\r\nthe party--and one of them was Mary's mother! Yet what could he do?\r\nWhat chance was there of escaping from the earthquake?\r\n\r\n\"Bless my gizzard!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Don't let's stand here\r\nworrying! If you folks are hungry come up to our camp. We have\r\nplenty. Afterward we can discuss means of saving ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to be saved!\" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. \"I must be saved! I have\r\na great secret--a secret--\"\r\n\r\nOnce more he paused in confusion, and once more his hands nervously\r\nsought his belt.\r\n\r\n\"I would give a big reward to be saved,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\n\"And so, I fancy, we all would,\" added Captain Mentor. \"But we are\r\nnot likely to. This island is out of the track of the regular line\r\nof vessels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we, anyhow?\" inquired Mr. Fenwick. \"What island is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't down on the charts, I believe,\" was the captain's reply,\r\n\"but we won't be far out, if we call it Earthquake Island. That name\r\nseems to fit it exactly.\"\r\n\r\nThey had walked on, while talking, and now had gone past the broken\r\ncliff. Tom and his two friends of the airship led the way to the\r\ncamp they had made. On the way, Mr. Hosbrook related how his yacht\r\nhad struggled in vain against the tempest, how she had sprung a\r\nleak, how the fires had gone out, and how, helpless in the trough of\r\nthe sea, the gallant vessel began to founder. Then they had taken to\r\nthe boats, and had, most unexpectedly come upon the island.\r\n\r\n\"And since we landed we have had very little to eat,\" said Mrs.\r\nNestor. \"We haven't had a place to sleep, and it has been terrible.\r\nThen, too, the earthquakes! And my husband and I worried so about\r\nMary. Oh, Mr. Swift! Do you think there is any chance of us ever\r\nseeing her again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Tom, softly. \"I'll do all I can to get us\r\noff this island. Perhaps we can build a raft, and set out. If we\r\nstay here there is no telling what will happen, if that scientist's\r\ntheory is correct. But there is our camp, just ahead. You will be\r\nmore comfortable, at least for a little while.\"\r\n\r\nIn a short time they were at the place where Tom and the others had\r\nbuilt the shack. The ruins of the airship were examined with\r\ninterest, and the two women took advantage of the seclusion of the\r\nlittle hut, to get some much needed rest until a meal should be\r\nready.\r\n\r\nOne was soon in course of preparation by Tom and Mr. Damon, aided by\r\nMate Fordam, of the RESOLUTE. Fortunate it was that Mr. Fenwick had\r\nbrought along such a supply of food, for there were now many mouths\r\nto feed.\r\n\r\nThat the supper (which the meal really was, for it was getting late)\r\nwas much enjoyed, goes without saying. The yacht castaways had\r\nsubsisted on what little food had been hurriedly put into the life\r\nboat, as they left the vessel.\r\n\r\nAt Tom's request, while it was yet light, Captain Mentor and some of\r\nthe men hunted for a spring of fresh water, and found one, for, with\r\nthe increase in the party, the young inventor saw the necessity for\r\nmore water. The spring gave promise of supplying a sufficient\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of material at hand for making other shacks, and\r\nthey were soon in course of construction. They were made light, as\r\nwas the one Tom and his friends first built, so that, in case of\r\nanother shock, no one would be hurt seriously. The two ladies were\r\ngiven the larger shack, and the men divided themselves between two\r\nothers that were hastily erected on the beach. The remainder of the\r\nfood and stores was taken from the wreck of the airship, and when\r\ndarkness began to fall, the camp was snug and comfortable, a big\r\nfire of driftwood burning brightly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if only we can sleep without being awakened by an earthquake!\"\r\nexclaimed Mrs. Nestor, as she prepared to go into the shack with\r\nMrs. Anderson. \"But I am almost afraid to close my eyes!\"\r\n\r\n\"If it would do any good to stay up and watch, to tell you when one\r\nwas coming, I'd do so,\" spoke Tom, with a laugh, \"but they come\r\nwithout warning.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the night did pass peacefully, and there was not the least\r\ntremor of the island. In the morning the castaways took courage and,\r\nafter breakfast, began discussing their situation more calmly.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that the only solution is to build some sort of a\r\nraft, or other craft and leave the island,\" said Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my hair brush!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Why can't we hoist a signal\r\nof distress, and wait for some steamer to see it and call for us? It\r\nseems to me that would be more simple than going to sea on a raft. I\r\ndon't like the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"A signal would be all right, if this island was in the path of the\r\nsteamers,\" said Captain Mentor. \"But it isn't. Our flag might fly\r\nfor a year, and never be seen.\"\r\n\r\nHis words seemed to strike coldness to every heart. Tom, who was\r\nlooking at the wreck of the airship, suddenly uttered an\r\nexclamation. He sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" demanded Mr. Fenwick. \"Does your sore leg hurt you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I have just thought of a plan!\" fairly shouted the young\r\ninventor. \"I have it! Wait and see if I can work it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Work what?\" cried Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\nTom did not get a chance to answer, for, at that moment, there\r\nsounded, at the far end of the island, whence the yacht castaways\r\nhad come, a terrific crash. It was accompanied, rather than\r\nfollowed, by a shaking, trembling and swaying of the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Another earthquake!\" screamed Mrs. Nestor, rushing toward her\r\nhusband. The castaways gazed at each other affrighted.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, before their eyes, they saw the extreme end of that part\r\nof the island on which they were camping, slip off, and beneath the\r\nfoaming waves of the sea, while the echoes of the mighty crash came\r\nto their ears!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nMR. JENKS HAS DIAMONDS\r\n\r\n\r\nStunned, and well-nigh paralyzed by the suddenness of the awful\r\ncrash, and the recurrence of the earthquake, the castaways gazed\r\nspell-bound at one another.\r\n\r\nSucceeding the disappearance of the end of the island there arose a\r\ngreat wave in the ocean, caused by the immersion of such a quantity\r\nof rock and dirt.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" yelled Tom, \"there may be a flood here!\"\r\n\r\nThey realized his meaning, and hastened up the beach, out of reach\r\nof the water if it should come. And it did. At first the ocean\r\nretreated, as though the tide was going out, then, with a rush and\r\nroar, the waves came leaping back, and, had the castaways remained\r\nwhere they had been standing they would have been swept out to sea.\r\n\r\nAs it was the flood reached part of the wreck of the airship, that\r\nlay on the beach, and washed away some of the broken planks. But,\r\nafter the first rush of water, the sea grew less troubled, and there\r\nwas no more danger from that source.\r\n\r\nTrue, the whole island was rumbling and trembling in the throes of\r\nan earthquake, but, by this time, the refugees had become somewhat\r\nused to this, and only the two ladies exhibited any outward signs of\r\ngreat alarm, though Mr. Barcoe Jenks, Tom observed, was nervously\r\nfingering the belt which he wore about his waist.\r\n\r\n\"I guess the worst is over,\" spoke Mr. Fenwick, as they stood\r\nlooking toward where part of the island had vanished. \"The shock\r\nexpended itself on tearing that mass of rock and earth away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hope so,\" added Mr. Hosbrook, solemnly. \"Oh, if we could\r\nonly get away from this terrible place! We must hoist a signal of\r\ndistress, even if we are out of the track of regular vessels. Some\r\nship, blown out of her course may see it. Captain Mentor, I wish you\r\nand Mr. Fordam would attend to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, sir,\" answered the commander of the ill-fated RESOLUTE.\r\n\"The signal shall be hoisted at once. Come on, Mr. Fordam,\" he\r\nadded, turning to the first mate.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mind,\" interrupted Tom, \"I wish you would first help\r\nme to get what remains of the airship up out of reach of any more\r\npossible high waves. That one nearly covered it, and if there are\r\nother big rollers, the wreck may be washed out to sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't see that any great harm would result from that,\" put in Mr.\r\nJenks. \"There isn't anything about the wreck that we could use to\r\nmake a boat or raft from.\" Indeed, there was little left of the\r\nairship, save the mass of machinery.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it may come in handy before we leave here,\" said Tom, and\r\nthere was a quiet determined air about him, that caused Mr. Damon to\r\nlook at him curiously. The odd gentleman started to utter one of his\r\nnumerous blessings, and to ask Tom a question, but he thought better\r\nof it. By this time the earthquake had ceased, and the castaways\r\nwere calmer.\r\n\r\nTom started toward the airship wreck, and began pulling off some\r\nbroken boards to get at the electrical machinery.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you had better give Mr. Swift a hand, Captain Mentor,\"\r\nspoke the millionaire yacht owner. \"I don't know what good the wreck\r\ncan be, but we owe considerable to Mr. Swift and his friends, and\r\nthe least we can do is to aid them in anything they ask. So,\r\nCaptain, if you don't mind, you and the mate bear a hand. In fact,\r\nwe'll all help, and move the wreck so far up that there will be no\r\ndanger, even from tidal waves.\"\r\n\r\nTom looked pleased at this order, and soon he and all the men in the\r\nlittle party were busy taking out the electrical apparatus, and\r\nmoving it farther inland.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with it, Tom?\" asked Mr. Damon, in a low\r\nvoice, as he assisted the young inventor to carry a small dynamo,\r\nthat was used for operating the incandescent lights.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know myself. I have a half-formed plan in my mind. I may\r\nbe able to carry it out, and I may not. I don't want to say anything\r\nuntil I look over the machinery, and see if all the parts which I\r\nneed are here. Please say nothing about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my toothpick! Of course, I'll not,\" promised Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\nWhen the removal of most of the machinery of the wrecked airship had\r\nbeen completed, Mrs. Nestor exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Well, since you are moving that out of harm's way, don't you think\r\nit would be a good idea to change our camp, also? I'm sure I'll\r\nnever sleep a wink, thinking that part of the island may fall into\r\nthe ocean at any moment in the night, and create a wave that may\r\nwash us all out to sea. Can't we move the camp, Mr. Swift?\"\r\n\r\n\"No reason why we can't,\" answered the lad, smiling. \"I think it\r\nwould be a good plan to take it farther back. We are likely to be\r\nhere some time, and, while we are about it, we might build more\r\ncomplete shelters, and have a few more comforts.\"\r\n\r\nThe others agreed with this idea, so the little shacks that had been\r\nerected were taken down, and moved to higher ground, where a better\r\noutlook could be had of the surrounding ocean. At the same time as\r\nsafe a place as possible, considering the frequent earthquakes, was\r\npicked out--a place where there were no overhanging rocks or cliffs.\r\n\r\nThree huts were built, one for the two ladies, one for the men, and\r\nthird where the cooking could be done. This last also held the food\r\nsupplies and stores, and Tom noted, with satisfaction, that there\r\nwas still sufficient to eat to last over a week. Mr. Fenwick had not\r\nstinted his kitchen stores.\r\n\r\nThis work done, Captain Mentor and Mate Fordam went to the highest\r\npart of the island, where they erected a signal, made from pieces of\r\ncanvas that had been in the life boat. The boat itself was brought\r\naround to the new camp, and at first it was hoped that it could be\r\nrepaired, and used. But too large a hole had been stove in the\r\nbottom, so it was broken up, and the planks used in making the\r\nshacks.\r\n\r\nThis work occupied the better part of two days, and during this\r\ntime, there were no more earthquakes. The castaways began to hope\r\nthat the island would not be quiet for a while. Mrs. Anderson and\r\nMrs. Nestor assumed charge of the \"housekeeping\" arrangements, and\r\nalso the cooking, which relieved Tom from those duties. The two\r\nladies even instituted \"wash-day,\" and when a number of garments\r\nwere hung on lines to dry, the camp looked like some summer colony\r\nof pleasure-seekers, out for a holiday.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Tom had spent most of his time among the machinery\r\nwhich had been taken from the airship. He inspected it carefully,\r\ntested some of the apparatus, and made some calculations on a bit of\r\npaper. He seemed greatly pleased over something, and one afternoon,\r\nwhen he was removing some of the guy and stay wires from the\r\ncollapsed frame of the WHIZZER, he was approached by Mr. Barcoe\r\nJenks.\r\n\r\n\"Planning something new?\" asked Mr. Jenks, with an attempt at\r\njollity, which, however, failed. The man had a curious air about\r\nhim, as if he was carrying some secret that was too much for him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, nothing exactly new,\" answered Tom. \"At best I am merely\r\ngoing to try an experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"An experiment, eh?\" resumed Mr. Jenks, \"And might I ask if it has\r\nanything to do with rescuing us from this island?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope it will have,\" answered Tom, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. \"Well, now I have a proposition to make\r\nto you. I suppose you are not very wealthy, Mr. Swift?\" He gazed at\r\nTom, quizzically.\r\n\r\n\"I am not poor,\" was the young inventor's proud answer, \"but I would\r\nbe glad to make more money--legitimately.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so. Most every one would. Look here!\"\r\n\r\nHe approached closer to Tom, and, pulling his hand from his pocket,\r\nheld it extended, in the palm were a number of irregularly-shaped\r\nobjects--stones or crystals the lad took them to be, yet they did\r\nnot look like ordinary stones or crystals.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what those are?\" asked Mr. Jenks.\r\n\r\n\"I might guess,\" replied Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I'll save you the trouble. They are diamonds! Diamonds of the very\r\nfirst water, but uncut. Now to the point. I have half a million\r\ndollars worth of them. If you get me safely off this island, I will\r\nagree to make you a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds!\"\r\n\r\n\"Make me a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds?\" asked\r\nTom, struck by the use of the work \"make.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, 'make,'\" answered Mr. Jenks. \"That is if I can discover the\r\nsecret--the secret of Phantom Mountain. Get me away from the island\r\nand I will share my knowledge with you--I need help--help to learn\r\nthe secret and help to make the diamonds--see, there are some of the\r\nfirst ones made, but I have been defrauded of my rights--I need the\r\naid of a young fellow like you. Will you help? See, I'll give you\r\nsome diamonds now. They are genuine, though they are not like\r\nordinary diamonds. I made them. Will you--\"\r\n\r\nBefore Tom could answer, there came a warning rumble of the earth,\r\nand a great fissure opened, almost at the feet of Mr. Jenks, who,\r\nwith a cry of fear, leaped toward the young inventor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSECRET OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Help me save this machinery!\" yelled Tom, whose first thought was\r\nfor the electrical apparatus. \"Don't let it fall into that chasm!\"\r\n\r\nFor the crack had widened, until it was almost to the place where\r\nthe parts of the wrecked airship had been carried.\r\n\r\n\"The machinery? What do I care about the machinery?\" cried Mr.\r\nJenks. \"I want to save my life!\"\r\n\r\n\"And this machinery is our only hope!\" retorted Tom. He began\r\ntugging at the heavy dynamos and gasolene engine, but he might have\r\nsaved himself the trouble, for with the same suddenness with which\r\nit opened, the crack closed again. The shock had done it, and, as if\r\nsatisfied with that phenomena, the earthquake ceased, and the island\r\nno longer trembled.\r\n\r\n\"That was a light one,\" spoke Tom, with an air of relief. He was\r\nbecoming used to the shocks now, and, when he saw that his precious\r\nmachinery was not damaged he could view the earth tremors calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Slight!\" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. \"Well, I don't call it so. But I see\r\nCaptain Mentor and Mr. Hosbrook coming. Please don't say anything to\r\nthem about the diamonds. I'll see you again,\" and with that, the\r\nqueer Mr. Jenks walked away.\r\n\r\n\"We came to see if you were hurt,\" called the captain, as he neared\r\nthe young inventor.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm all right. How about the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only frightened,\" replied the yacht owner. \"This is getting awful.\r\nI hoped we were free from the shocks, but they still continue.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I guess they will,\" added Tom. \"We certainly are on Earthquake\r\nIsland!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Parker, the scientist, says this last shock bears out his\r\ntheory,\" went on the millionaire. \"He says it will be only a\r\nquestion of a few days when the whole island will disappear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Comforting, to say the least,\" commented Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I should say so. But what are you doing, Mr. Swift?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trying an experiment,\" answered the young inventor, in some\r\nconfusion. He was not yet ready to talk about his plans.\r\n\r\n\"We must begin to think seriously of building some sort of a boat or\r\nraft, and getting away from the island,\" went on the millionaire.\r\n\"It will be perilous to go to sea with anything we can construct,\r\nbut it is risking our lives to stay here. I don't know what to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Captain Mentor has some plan,\" suggested Tom, hoping to\r\nchange the subject.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the commander, \"I confess I am at a loss to know what\r\nto do. There is nothing with which to do anything, that is the\r\ntrouble! But I did think of hoisting another signal, on this end of\r\nthe island, where it might be seen if our first one wasn't. I\r\nbelieve I'll do that,\" and he moved away, to carry out his\r\nintention.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think I'll get back, Tom, and tell the others that you are\r\nall right,\" spoke Mr. Hosbrook. \"I left the camp, after the shock,\r\nbecause Mrs. Nestor was worried about you.\" The place to which the\r\nairship machinery had been removed was some distance from the camp,\r\nand out of sight of the shacks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. I'm all right,\" said Tom. Then, with a sudden impulse, he\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know much about this Mr. Barcoe Jenks, Mr. Hosbrook?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a great deal,\" was the reply. \"In fact, I may say I do not know\r\nhim at all. Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I thought he acted rather strangely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what the rest of us think,\" declared the yacht owner. \"He is\r\nno friend of mine, though he was my guest on the RESOLUTE. It came\r\nabout in this way. I had invited a Mr. Frank Jackson to make the\r\ntrip with me, and he asked if he could bring with him a Mr. Jenks, a\r\nfriend of his. I assented, and Mr. Jackson came aboard with Mr.\r\nJenks. Just as we were about to sail Mr. Jackson received a message\r\nrequiring his presence in Canada, and he could not make the trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. Jenks seemed so cut-up about being deprived of the yachting\r\ntrip, and was so fond of the water, that I invited him to remain on\r\nboard, even if his friend did not. So that is how he came to be\r\namong my guests, though he is a comparative stranger to all of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" spoke Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Has he been acting unusually strange?\" asked Mr. Hosbrook\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"No, only he seemed very anxious to get off the island, but I\r\nsuppose we all are. He wanted to know what I planned to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you tell him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, for the reason that I don't know whether I can succeed or not,\r\nand I don't want to raise false hopes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you would prefer not to tell any of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one--that is except Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Damon. I may need them\r\nto help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" responded Mr. Hosbrook. \"Well, whatever it is, I wish you\r\nluck. It is certainly a fearful place--this island,\" and busy with\r\nmany thoughts, which crowded upon him, the millionaire moved away,\r\nleaving Tom alone.\r\n\r\nA little while after this Tom might have been seen in close\r\nconversation with Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick. The former, on hearing\r\nwhat the young inventor had to say, blessed himself and his various\r\npossessions so often, that he seemed to have gotten out of breath.\r\nMr. Fenwick exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Tom, if you can work that it will be one of the greatest things you\r\nhave ever done!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope I can work it,\" was all the young inventor replied.\r\n\r\nFor the next three days Tom, and his two friends, spent most of\r\ntheir time in the neighborhood of the pile of machinery and\r\napparatus taken from the wrecked WHIZZER. Mr. Jenks hung around the\r\nspot, but a word or two from Mr. Hosbrook sent him away, and our\r\nthree friends were left to their work in peace, for they were\r\ninclined to be secretive about their operations, as Tom did not want\r\nhis plans known until he was ready.\r\n\r\nThe gasolene motor was overhauled, and put in shape to work. Then it\r\nwas attached to the dynamo. When this much had been done, Tom and\r\nhis friends built a rude shack around the machinery shutting it from\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\"Humph! Are you afraid we will steal it?\" asked Mr. Parker, the\r\nscientist, who held to his alarming theory regarding the ultimate\r\ndisappearance of the island.\r\n\r\n\"No, I simply want to protect it from the weather,\" answered Tom.\r\n\"You will soon know all our plans. I think they will work out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better do it before we get another earthquake, and the island\r\nsinks,\" was the dismal response.\r\n\r\nBut there had been no shocks since the one that nearly engulfed Mr.\r\nJenks. As for that individual he said little to any one, and\r\nwandered off alone by himself. Tom wondered what kind of diamonds\r\nthey were that the odd man had, and the lad even had his doubts as\r\nto the value of the queer stones he had seen. But he was too busy\r\nwith his work to waste much time in idle speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE WIRELESS PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe castaways had been on Earthquake Island a week now, and in that\r\ntime had suffered many shocks. Some were mere tremors, and some were\r\nso severe as to throw whole portions of the isle into the sea. They\r\nnever could tell when a shock was coming, and often one awakened\r\nthem in the night.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of this, the refugees were as cheerful as it was\r\npossible to be under the circumstances. Only Mr. Jenks seemed\r\nnervous and ill at ease, and he kept much by himself.\r\n\r\nAs for Tom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick, the three were busy in their\r\nshack. The others had ceased to ask questions about what they were\r\ndoing, and Mr. Nestor and his wife took it for granted that Tom was\r\nbuilding a boat.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mentor and the mate spent much time gazing off to sea,\r\nhoping for a sight of the sail of some vessel, or the haze that\r\nwould indicate the smoke of a steamer. But they saw nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't much hope of sighting anything,\" the captain said. \"I\r\nknow we are off the track of the regular liners, and our only chance\r\nwould be that some tramp steamer, or some ship blown off her course,\r\nwould see our signal. I tell you, friends, we're in a bad way.\"\r\n\r\n\"If money was any object--,\" began Mr. Jenks.\r\n\r\n\"What good would money be?\" demanded Mr. Hosbrook. \"What we need to\r\ndo is to get a message to some one--some of my friends--to send out\r\na party to rescue us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" chimed in Mr. Parker, the scientist. \"And the\r\nmessage needs to go off soon, if we are to be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" asked Mr. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\"Because I think this island will sink inside of a week!\"\r\n\r\nA scream came from the two ladies.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you keep such thoughts to yourself?\" demanded the\r\nmillionaire yacht owner, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's true,\" stubbornly insisted the scientist.\r\n\r\n\"What if it is? It doesn't do any good to remind us of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my gizzard, no!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Suppose we have\r\ndinner. I'm hungry.\"\r\n\r\nThat seemed to be his remedy for a number of ills.\r\n\r\n\"If we only could get a message off, summoning help, it WOULD be the\r\nvery thing,\" sighed Mrs. Nestor. \"Oh, how I wish I could send my\r\ndaughter, Mary, word of where we are. She may hear of the wreck of\r\nthe RESOLUTE, and worry herself to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is out of the question to send a message for help from\r\nEarthquake Island,\" added Mrs. Anderson. \"We are totally cut off\r\nfrom the rest of the world here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" spoke Tom Swift, quietly. He had come up silently,\r\nand had heard the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"What's that you said?\" cried Mr. Nestor, springing to his feet, and\r\ncrossing the sandy beach toward the lad.\r\n\r\n\"I said perhaps we weren't altogether cut off from the rest of the\r\nworld,\" repeated Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Why not,\" demanded Captain Mentor. \"You don't mean to say that you\r\nhave been building a boat up there in your little shack, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a boat,\" replied Tom, \"but I think I have a means of sending\r\nout a call for help!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom--Mr. Swift--how?\" exclaimed Mrs. Nestor. \"Do you mean we\r\ncan send a message to my Mary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not exactly to her,\" answered the young inventor, though he\r\nwished that such a thing were possible. \"But I think I can summon\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" demanded Mr. Hosbrook. \"Have you managed to discover some\r\ncable line running past the island, and have you tapped it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly.\" was Tom's calm answer, \"but I have succeeded, with\r\nthe help of Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick, in building an apparatus that\r\nwill send out wireless messages!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wireless messages!\" gasped the millionaire. \"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wireless messages!\" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. \"I'll give--\" He paused,\r\nclasped his hands on his belt, and turned away.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom!\" cried Mrs. Nestor, and she went up to the lad, threw her\r\narms about his neck, and kissed him; whereat Tom blushed.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you'd better explain,\" suggested Mr. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said the lad. \"That is the secret we have been engaged\r\nupon--Mr. Damon, Mr. Fenwick and myself. We did not want to say\r\nanything about it until we were sure we could succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you sure now?\" asked Captain Mentor.\r\n\r\n\"Fairly so.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could you build a wireless station?\" inquired Mr. Hosbrook.\r\n\r\n\"From the electrical machinery that was in the wrecked WHIZZER,\"\r\nspoke Tom. \"Fortunately, that was not damaged by the shock of the\r\nfall, and I have managed to set up the gasolene engine, and attach\r\nthe dynamo to it so that we can generate a powerful current. We also\r\nhave a fairly good storage battery, though that was slightly damaged\r\nby the fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have just tested the machinery, and I think we can send out a\r\nstrong enough message to carry at least a thousand miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that will reach some station, or some passing ship,\" murmured\r\nCaptain Mentor. \"There is a chance that we may be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it isn't too late,\" gloomily murmured the scientist. \"There is\r\nno telling when the island will disappear beneath the sea.\"\r\n\r\nBut they were all so interested in Tom's announcement that they paid\r\nlittle attention to this dire foreboding.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us about it,\" suggested Mr. Nestor. And Tom did.\r\n\r\nHe related how he had set up the dynamo and gasolene engine, and\r\nhow, by means of the proper coils and other electrical apparatus,\r\nall of which, fortunately, was aboard the WHIZZER, he could produce\r\na powerful spark.\r\n\r\n\"I had to make a key out of strips of brass, to produce the Morse\r\ncharacters,\" the lad said. \"This took considerable time, but it\r\nworks, though it is rather crude. I can click out a message with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" said Mr. Hosbrook, who had been considering\r\ninstalling a wireless plant on his yacht, and who, therefore, knew\r\nsomething about it, \"you may send a message, but can you receive an\r\nanswer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have also provided for that,\" replied Tom. \"I have made a\r\nreceiving instrument, though that is even more crude than the\r\nsending plant, for it had to be delicately adjusted, and I did not\r\nhave just the magnets, carbons, coherers and needles that I needed.\r\nBut I think it will work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you have a telephone receiver to use?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There was a small interior telephone arrangement on Mr.\r\nFenwick's airship, and part of that came in handy. Oh, I think I can\r\nhear any messages that may come in answer to ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about the aerial wires for sending and receiving\r\nmessages?\" asked Mr. Nestor.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you have to have several wires on a tall mast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and that is the last thing to do,\" declared Tom. \"I need all\r\nyour help in putting up those wires. That tall tree on the crest of\r\nthe island will do,\" and he pointed to a dead palm that towered\r\ngaunt and bare like a ship's mast, on a pile of rocks in the centre\r\nof Earthquake Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nMESSAGES INTO SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Swift's announcement of the practical completion of his wireless\r\nplant brought hope to the discouraged hearts of the castaways. They\r\ncrowded about him, and asked all manner of questions.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenwick and Mr. Damon came in for their share of attention, for\r\nTom said had it not been for the aid of his friends he never could\r\nhave accomplished what he did. Then they all trooped up to the\r\nlittle shack, and inspected the plant.\r\n\r\nAs the young inventor had said, it was necessarily crude, but when\r\nhe set the gasolene motor going, and the dynamo whizzed and hummed,\r\nsending out great, violet-hued sparks, they were all convinced that\r\nthe young inventor had accomplished wonders, considering the\r\nmaterials at his disposal.\r\n\r\n\"But it's going to be no easy task to rig up the sending and\r\nreceiving wires,\" declared Tom. \"That will take some time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you got the wire?\" asked Mr. Jenks.\r\n\r\n\"I took it from the stays of the airship,\" was Tom's reply, and he\r\nrecalled the day he was at that work, when the odd man had exhibited\r\nthe handful of what he said were diamonds. Tom wondered if they\r\nreally were, and he speculated as to what might be the secret of\r\nPhantom Mountain, to which Mr. Jenks had referred.\r\n\r\nBut now followed a busy time for all. Under the direction of the\r\nyoung inventor, they began to string the wires from the top of the\r\ndead tree, to a smaller one, some distance away, using five wires,\r\nset parallel, and attached to a wooden spreader, or stay. The wires\r\nwere then run to the dynamo, and the receiving coil, and the\r\nnecessary ground wires were installed.\r\n\r\n\"But I can't understand how you are going to do it,\" said Mrs.\r\nNestor. \"I've read about wireless messages, but I can't get it\r\nthrough my head. How is it done, Mr. Swift?\"\r\n\r\n\"The theory is very simple,\" said the young inventor. \"To send a\r\nmessage by wire, over a telegraph system, a battery or dynamo is\r\nused. This establishes a current over wires stretched between two\r\npoints. By means of what is called a 'key' this current is\r\ninterrupted, or broken, at certain intervals, making the sounding\r\ninstrument send out clicks. A short click is called a dot, and a\r\nlong click a dash. By combinations of dots, dashes, and spaces\r\nbetween the dots and dashes, letters are spelled out. For instance,\r\na dot and a space and a dash, represent the letter 'A' and so on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand so far,\" admitted Mrs. Nestor.\r\n\r\n\"In telegraphing without wires,\" went on Tom, \"the air is used in\r\nplace of a metallic conductor, with the help of the earth, which in\r\nitself is a big magnet, or a battery, as you choose to regard it.\r\nThe earth helps to establish the connection between places where\r\nthere are no wires, when we 'ground' certain conductors.\"\r\n\r\n\"To send a wireless message a current is generated by a dynamo. The\r\ncurrent flows along until it gets to the ends of the sending wires,\r\nwhich we have just strung. Then it leaps off into space, so to\r\nspeak, until it reaches the receiving wires, wherever they may be\r\nerected. That is why any wireless receiving station, within a\r\ncertain radius, can catch any messages that may be flying through\r\nthe air--that is unless certain apparatus is tuned, or adjusted, to\r\nprevent this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, once the impulses, or electric currents, are sent out into\r\nspace, all that is necessary to do is to break, or interrupt them at\r\ncertain intervals, to make dots, dashes and spaces. These make\r\ncorresponding clicks in the telephone receiver which the operator at\r\nthe receiving station wears on his ear. He hears the code of clicks,\r\nand translates them into letters, the letters into words and the\r\nwords into sentences. That is how wireless messages are sent.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you propose to send some that way?\" asked Mrs. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" replied Tom, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Where to?\" Mrs. Nestor wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I can't tell,\" was Tom's reply. \"I will have to project\r\nthem off into space, and trust to chance that some listening\r\nwireless operator will 'pick them up,' as they call it, and send us\r\naid.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are wireless operators always listening?\" asked Mr. Nestor.\r\n\r\n\"Somewhere, some of them are--I hope,\" was Tom's quiet answer. \"As I\r\nsaid, we will have to trust much to chance. But other people have\r\nbeen saved by sending messages off into space; and why not we?\r\nSinking steamers have had their passengers taken off when the\r\noperator called for help, merely by sending a message into space.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can we tell them where to come for us--on this unknown\r\nisland?\" inquired Mrs. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\"I fancy Captain Mentor can supply our longitude and latitude,\"\r\nanswered Tom. \"I will give that with every message I send out, and\r\nhelp may come--some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't come any too quick for me!\" declared Mr. Damon. \"Bless my\r\ndoor knob, but my wife must be worrying about my absence!\"\r\n\r\n\"What message for help will you send?\" Captain Mentor wanted to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to use the old call for aid,\" was the reply of the young\r\ninventor. \"I shall flash into space the three letters 'C.Q.D.' They\r\nstand for 'Come Quick--Danger.' A new code call has been instituted\r\nfor them, but I am going to rely on the old one, as, in this part of\r\nthe world, the new one may not be so well understood. Then I will\r\nfollow that by giving our position in the ocean, as nearly as\r\nCaptain Mentor can figure it out. I will repeat this call at\r\nintervals until we get help--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or until the island sinks,\" added the scientist, grimly.\r\n\r\n\"Here! Don't mention that any more,\" ordered Mr. Hosbrook. \"It's\r\ngetting on my nerves! We may be rescued before that awful calamity\r\novertakes us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe so,\" was Mr. Parker's reply, and he actually seemed\r\nto derive pleasure from his gloomy prophecy.\r\n\r\n\"It's lucky you understand wireless telegraphy, Tom Swift,\" said Mr.\r\nNestor admiringly, and the other joined in praising the young\r\ninventor, until, blushing, he hurried off to make some adjustments\r\nto his apparatus.\r\n\r\n\"Can you compute our longitude and latitude, Captain Mentor,\" asked\r\nthe millionaire yacht owner.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" was the reply. \"Not very accurately, of course, for\r\nall my papers and instruments went down in the RESOLUTE. But near\r\nenough for the purpose, I fancy. I'll get right to work at it, and\r\nlet Mr. Swift have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would. The sooner we begin calling for help the better.\r\nI never expected to be in such a predicament as this, but it is\r\nwonderful how that young fellow worked out his plan of rescue. I\r\nhope he succeeds.\"\r\n\r\nIt took some little time for the commander to figure their position,\r\nand then it was only approximate. But at length he handed Tom a\r\npiece of paper with the latitude and longitude written on it.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the young inventor had been connecting up his\r\napparatus. The wires were now all strung, and all that was necessary\r\nwas to start the motor and dynamo.\r\n\r\nA curious throng gathered about the little shack as Tom announced\r\nthat he was about to flash into space the first message calling for\r\nhelp. He took his place at the box, to which had been fastened the\r\napparatus for clicking off the Morse letters.\r\n\r\n\"Well, here we go,\" he said, with a smile.\r\n\r\nHis fingers clasped the rude key he had fashioned from bits of brass\r\nand hard rubber. The motor was buzzing away, and the electric dynamo\r\nwas purring like some big cat.\r\n\r\nJust as Tom opened the circuit, to send the current into the\r\ninstrument, there came an ominous rumbling of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Another quake!\" screamed Mrs. Anderson. But it was over in a\r\nsecond, and calmness succeeded the incipient panic.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, overhead, there sounded a queer crackling noise, a\r\nvicious, snapping, as if from some invisible whips.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy! What's that?\" cried Mrs. Nestor.\r\n\r\n\"The wireless,\" replied Tom, quietly. \"I am going to send a message\r\nfor help, off into space. I hope some one receives it--and answers,\"\r\nhe added, in a low tone.\r\n\r\nThe crackling increased. While they gathered about him, Tom Swift\r\npressed the key, making and breaking the current until he had sent\r\nout from Earthquake Island the three letters--\"C.Q.D.\" And he\r\nfollowed them by giving their latitude and longitude. Over and over\r\nagain he flashed out this message.\r\n\r\nWould it be answered? Would help come? If so, from where? And if so,\r\nwould it be in time? These were questions that the castaways asked\r\nthemselves. As for Tom, he sat at the key, clicking away, while,\r\noverhead, from the wires fastened to the dead tree, flashed out the\r\nmessages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nANXIOUS DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the first few minutes of watching Tom click out the messages,\r\nthe little throng of castaways that had gathered about the shack,\r\nmoved away. The matter had lost its novelty for them, though, of\r\ncourse, they were vitally interested in the success of Tom's\r\nundertaking. Only Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick remained with the young\r\ninventor, for he needed help, occasionally, in operating the dynamo,\r\nor in adjusting the gasolene motor. Mrs. Nestor, who, with Mrs.\r\nAnderson, was looking after the primitive housekeeping arrangements,\r\noccasionally strolled up the hill to the little shed.\r\n\r\n\"Any answer yet, Mr. Swift?\" she would ask.\r\n\r\n\"No.\" was the reply. \"We can hardly expect any so soon,\" and Mrs.\r\nNestor would depart, with a sigh.\r\n\r\nKnowing that his supply of gasolene was limited, Tom realized that\r\nhe could not run the dynamo steadily, and keep flashing the wireless\r\nmessages into space. He consulted with his two friends on the\r\nsubject, and Mr. Damon said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, the best plan, I think, would be only to send out the flashes\r\nover the wires at times when other wireless operators will be on the\r\nlookout, or, rather, listening. There is no use wasting our fuel. We\r\ncan't get any more here.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" admitted Tom, \"but how can we pick out any certain\r\ntime, when we can be sure that wireless operators, within a zone of\r\na thousand miles, will be listening to catch clicks which call for\r\nhelp from the unknown?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't,\" decided Mr. Fenwick. \"The only thing to do is to trust\r\nto chance. If there was only some way so you would not have to be on\r\nduty all the while, and could send out messages automatically, it\r\nwould be good.\"\r\n\r\nTom shook his head. \"I have to stay here to adjust the apparatus,\"\r\nhe said. \"It works none too easily as it is, for I didn't have just\r\nwhat I needed from which to construct this station. Anyhow, even if\r\nI could rig up something to click out 'C.Q.D.' automatically, I\r\ncould hardly arrange to have the answer come that way. And I want to\r\nbe here when the answer comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any plan, then?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"Bless my shoe laces!\r\nthere are enough problems to solve on this earthquake island.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought of this,\" said Tom. \"I'll send out our call for help from\r\nnine to ten in the morning. Then I'll wait, and send out another\r\ncall from two to three in the afternoon. Around seven in the evening\r\nI'll try again, and then about ten o'clock at night, before going to\r\nbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That ought to be sufficient,\" agreed Mr. Fenwick. \"Certainly we\r\nmust save our gasolene, for there is no telling how long we may have\r\nto stay here, and call for help.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be long if that scientist Parker has his way,\" spoke Mr.\r\nDamon, grimly. \"Bless my hat band, but he's a MOST uncomfortable man\r\nto have around; always predicting that the island is going to sink!\r\nI hope we are rescued before that happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess we all do,\" remarked Mr. Fenwick. \"But, Tom, here is\r\nanother matter. Have you thought about getting an answer from the\r\nunknown--from some ship or wireless station, that may reply to your\r\ncalls? How can you tell when that will come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then won't you or some of us, have to be listening all the while?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, for I think an answer will come only directly after I have sent\r\nout a call, and it has been picked up by some operator. Still there\r\nis a possibility that some operator might receive my message, and\r\nreport to his chief, or some one in authority over him, before\r\nreplying. In that time I might go away. But to guard against that I\r\nwill sleep with the telephone receiver clamped to my ear. Then I can\r\nhear the answer come over the wires, and can jump up and reply.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean you will sleep here?\" asked Mr. Damon, indicating the\r\nshack where the wireless apparatus was contained.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Tom, simply.\r\n\r\n\"Can't we take turns listening for the answer?\" inquired Mr.\r\nFenwick, \"and so relieve you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not, unless you understand the Morse code,\" replied Tom.\r\n\"You see there may be many clicks, which result from wireless\r\nmessages flying back and forth in space, and my receiver will pick\r\nthem up. But they will mean nothing. Only the answer to our call for\r\nhelp will be of any service to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that you can catch messages flying back and\r\nforth between stations now?\" asked Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the young inventor, with a smile. \"Here, listen for\r\nyourself,\" and he passed the head-instrument over to the WHIZZER's\r\nformer owner. The latter listened a moment.\r\n\r\n\"All I can hear are some faint clicks,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"But they are a message,\" spoke Tom. \"Wait, I'll translate,\" and he\r\nput the receiver to his ear. \"'STEAMSHIP \"FALCON\" REPORTS A SLIGHT\r\nFIRE IN HER FORWARD COMPARTMENT,'\" said Tom, slowly. \"'IT IS UNDER\r\nCONTROL, AND WE WILL PROCEED.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that was the message you heard?\" cried Mr.\r\nDamon. \"Bless my soul, I never can understand it!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was part of a message,\" answered Tom. \"I did not catch it all,\r\nnor to whom it was sent.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why can't you send a message to that steamship then, and beg\r\nthem to come to our aid?\" asked Mr. Fenwick. \"Even if they have had\r\na fire, it is out now, and they ought to be glad to save life.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would come to our aid, or send,\" spoke Tom, \"but I can not\r\nmake their wireless operator pick up our message. Either his\r\napparatus is not in tune, or in accord with ours, or he is beyond\r\nour zone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you heard him,\" insisted Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but sometimes it is easier to pick up messages than it is to\r\nsend them. However, I will keep on trying.\"\r\n\r\nPutting into operation the plan he had decided on for saving their\r\nsupply of gasolene, Tom sent out his messages the remainder of the\r\nday, at the intervals agreed upon. Then the apparatus was shut down,\r\nbut the lad paid frequent visits to the shack, and listened to the\r\nclicks of the telephone receiver. He caught several messages, but\r\nthey were not in response to his appeals for aid.\r\n\r\nThat night there was a slight earthquake shock, but no more of the\r\nisland fell into the sea, though the castaways were awakened by the\r\ntremors, and were in mortal terror for a while.\r\n\r\nThree days passed, days of anxious waiting, during which time Tom\r\nsent out message after message by his wireless, and waited in vain\r\nfor an answer. There were three shocks in this interval, two slight,\r\nand one very severe, which last cast into the ocean a great cliff on\r\nthe far end of the island. There was a flooding rush of water, but\r\nno harm resulted.\r\n\r\n\"It is coming nearer,\" said Mr. Parker.\r\n\r\n\"What is?\" demanded Mr. Hosbrook.\r\n\r\n\"The destruction of our island. My theory will soon be confirmed,\"\r\nand the scientist actually seemed to take pleasure in it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you and your theory!\" exclaimed the millionaire in disgust.\r\n\"Don't let me hear you mention it again! Haven't we troubles\r\nenough?\" whereat Mr. Parker went off by himself, to look at the\r\nplace where the cliff had fallen.\r\n\r\nEach night Tom slept with the telephone receiver to his ear, but,\r\nthough it clicked many times, there was not sounded the call he had\r\nadopted for his station--\"E. I.\"--Earthquake Island. In each appeal\r\nhe sent out he had requested that if his message was picked up, that\r\nthe answer be preceded by the letters \"E.I.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on the fourth day after the completion of the wireless\r\nstation, that Tom was sending out his morning calls. Mrs. Nestor\r\ncame up the little hill to the shack where Tom was clicking away.\r\n\r\n\"No replies yet, I suppose?\" she inquired, and there was a hopeless\r\nnote in her voice.\r\n\r\n\"None yet, but they may come any minute,\" and Tom tried to speak\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly hope so,\" added Mary's mother, \"But I came up more\r\nespecially now, Mr. Swift, to inquire where you had stored the rest\r\nof the food.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rest of the food?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the supply you took from the wrecked airship. We have used up\r\nnearly all that was piled in the improvised kitchen, and we'll have\r\nto draw on the reserve supply.\"\r\n\r\n\"The reserve,\" murmured Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is only enough in the shack where Mrs. Anderson and I do\r\nthe cooking, to last for about two days. Isn't there any more?\"\r\n\r\nTom did not answer. He saw the drift of the questioning. Their food\r\nwas nearly gone, yet the castaways from the RESOLUTE thought there\r\nwas still plenty. As a matter of fact there was not another can,\r\nexcept those in the kitchen shack.\r\n\r\n\"Get out wherever there is left some time to-day, if you will, Mr.\r\nSwift,\" went on Mrs. Nestor, as she turned away, \"and Mrs. Anderson\r\nand I will see if we can fix up some new dishes for you men-folks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--all right,\" answered Tom, weakly.\r\n\r\nHis hand dropped from the key of the instrument. He sat staring into\r\nspace. Food enough for but two days more, with earthquakes likely to\r\nhappen at any moment, and no reply yet to his appeals for aid! Truly\r\nthe situation was desperate. Tom shook his head. It was the first\r\ntime he had felt like giving up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nA REPLY IN THE DARK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young inventor looked out of the wireless shack. Down on the\r\nbeach he saw the little band of castaways. They were gathered in a\r\ngroup about Mr. Jenks, who seemed to be talking earnestly to them.\r\nThe two ladies were over near the small building that served as a\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n\"More food supplies needed, eh?\" mused Tom. \"Well, I don't know\r\nwhere any more is to come from. We've stripped the WHIZZER bare.\" He\r\nglanced toward what remained of the airship. \"I guess we'll have to\r\ngo on short rations, until help comes,\" and, wondering what the\r\ngroup of men could be talking about, Tom resumed his clicking out of\r\nhis wireless message.\r\n\r\nHe continued to send it into space for several minutes after ten\r\no'clock, the hour at which he usually stopped for the morning, for\r\nhe thought there might be a possible chance that the electrical\r\nimpulses would be picked up by some vessel far out at sea, or by\r\nsome station operator who could send help.\r\n\r\nBut there came no answering clicks to the \"E. I.\" station--to\r\nEarthquake Island--and, after a little longer working of the key,\r\nTom shut down the dynamo, and joined the group on the beach.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you it's our only chance,\" Mr. Jenks was saying. \"I must get\r\noff this island, and that's the only way we can do it. I have large\r\ninterests at stake. If we wait for a reply to this wireless message\r\nwe may all be killed, though I appreciate that Mr. Swift is doing\r\nhis best to aid us. But it is hopeless!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think about it, Tom?\" asked Mr. Damon, turning to the\r\nyoung inventor.\r\n\r\n\"Think about what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why Mr. Jenks has just proposed that we build a big raft, and\r\nlaunch it. He thinks we should leave the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be a good idea,\" agreed the lad, as he thought of the\r\nscant food supply. \"Of course, I can't say when a reply will be\r\nreceived to my calls for aid, and it is best to be prepared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially as the island may sink any minute,\" added Mr. Parker.\r\n\"If it does, even a raft will be little good, as it may be swamped\r\nin the vortex. I think it would be a good plan to make one, then\r\nanchor it some distance out from the island. Then we can make a\r\nsmall raft, and paddle out to the big one in a hurry if need be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's a good idea, too,\" conceded Tom.\r\n\r\n\"And we must stock it well with provisions,\" said Mr. Damon. \"Put\r\nplenty of water and food aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't,\" spoke Tom, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we haven't plenty of provisions. That's what I came down to\r\nspeak about,\" and the lad related what Mrs. Nestor had said.\r\n\r\n\"Then there is but one thing to do,\" declared Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Captain Mentor.\r\n\r\n\"We must go on half rations, or quarter rations, if need be. That\r\nwill make our supply last longer. And another thing--we must not let\r\nthe women folks know. Just pretend that we're not hungry, but take\r\nonly a quarter, or at most, not more than a half of what we have\r\nbeen in the habit of taking. There is plenty of water, thank\r\ngoodness, and we may be able to live until help comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then shall we build the raft?\" asked Mr. Hosbrook.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that this would be a good plan, and they started it\r\nthat same day. Trees were felled, with axes and saws that had been\r\naboard the WHIZZER, and bound together, in rude fashion, with strong\r\ntrailing vines from the forest. A smaller raft, as a sort of ferry,\r\nwas also made.\r\n\r\nThis occupied them all that day, and part of the next. In the\r\nmeanwhile, Tom continued to flash out his appeals for help, but no\r\nanswers came. The men cut down their rations, and when the two\r\nladies joked them on their lack of appetite, they said nothing. Tom\r\nwas glad that Mrs. Nestor did not renew her request to him to get\r\nout the reserve food supply from what remained in the wreck of the\r\nairship. Perhaps Mr. Nestor had hinted to her the real situation.\r\n\r\nThe large raft was towed out into a quiet bay of the island, and\r\nanchored there by means of a heavy rock, attached to a rope. On\r\nboard were put cans of water, which were lashed fast, but no food\r\ncould be spared to stock the rude craft. All the castaways could\r\ndepend on, was to take with them, in the event of the island\r\nbeginning to sink, what rations they had left when the final shock\r\nshould come.\r\n\r\nThis done, they could only wait, and weary was that waiting. Tom\r\nkept faithfully to his schedule, and his ear ached from the constant\r\npressure of the telephone receiver. He heard message after message\r\nflash through space, and click on his instrument, but none of them\r\nwas in answer to his. On his face there came a grim and hopeless\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, a week following the erection of the wireless\r\nstation, Mate Fordam came upon a number of turtles. He caught some,\r\nby turning them over on their backs, and also located a number of\r\nnests of eggs under the warm sands.\r\n\r\n\"This will be something to eat,\" he said, joyfully, and indeed the\r\nturtles formed a welcome food supply. Some fish were caught, and\r\nsome clams were cast up by the tide, all of which eked out the\r\nscanty food supply that remained. The two ladies suspected the truth\r\nnow and they, too, cut down their allowance.\r\n\r\nTom, who had been sitting with the men in their sleeping shack, that\r\nevening, rose, as the hour of ten approached. It was time to send\r\nout the last message of the night, and then he would lie down on an\r\nimprovised couch, with the telephone receiver clamped to his ear, to\r\nwait, in the silence of the darkness, for the message saying that\r\nhelp was on the way.\r\n\r\n\"Well, are you off?\" asked Mr. Damon, kindly. \"I wish some of us\r\ncould relieve you, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind it,\" answered the lad \"Perhaps the message may\r\ncome to-night.\"\r\n\r\nHardly had he spoken than there sounded the ominous rumble and\r\nshaking that presaged another earthquake. The shack rocked, and\r\nthreatened to come down about their heads.\r\n\r\n\"We must be doomed!\" cried Mr. Parker. \"The island is about to sink!\r\nMake for the raft!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait and see how bad it is,\" counseled Mr. Hosbrook. \"It may be\r\nonly a slight shock.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, as he spoke, the trembling of the island ceased, and there\r\nwas silence. The two ladies, who had retired to their own private\r\nshack, ran out screaming, and Mr. Anderson and Mr. Nestor hastened\r\nover to be with their wives.\r\n\r\n\"I guess it's passed over,\" spoke Mr. Fenwick.\r\n\r\nAn instant later there came another tremor, but it was not like that\r\nof an earthquake shock. It was more like the rumble and vibration of\r\nan approaching train.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" cried Tom, pointing to the left. Their gaze went in that\r\ndirection, and, under the light of a full moon they saw, sliding\r\ninto the sea, a great portion of one of the rocky hills.\r\n\r\n\"A landslide!\" cried Captain Mentor. \"The island is slowly breaking\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"It confirms my theory!\" said Mr. Parker, almost in triumph.\r\n\r\n\"Forget your theory for a while, Parker, please,\" begged Mr.\r\nHosbrook. \"We're lucky to have left a place on which to stand! Oh,\r\nwhen will we be rescued?\" he asked hopelessly.\r\n\r\nThe worst seemed to be over at least for the present, and, learning\r\nthat the two ladies were quieted, Tom started up the hill to his\r\nwireless station. Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick went with him, to aid in\r\nstarting the motor and dynamo. Then, after the message had been\r\nclicked out as usual Tom would begin his weary waiting.\r\n\r\nThey found that the earthquake shock had slightly disturbed the\r\napparatus, and it took them half an hour to adjust it. As there had\r\nbeen a delay on account of the landslide, it was eleven o'clock\r\nbefore Tom began sending out any flashes, and he kept it up until\r\nmidnight. But there came no replies, so he shut off the power, and\r\nprepared to get a little rest.\r\n\r\n\"It looks pretty hopeless; doesn't it?\" said Mr. Fenwick, as he and\r\nMr. Damon were on their way back to the sleeping shack.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it does. Our signal hasn't been seen, no ships have passed\r\nthis way, and our wireless appeal isn't answered. It does look\r\nhopeless but, do you know, I haven't given up yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have faith in Tom Swift's luck!\" declared the eccentric\r\nman. \"If you had been with him as much as I have, up in the air, and\r\nunder the water, and had seen the tight places he has gotten out of,\r\nyou'd feel the same, too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, but here there doesn't seem to be anything to do. It all\r\ndepends on some one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right. You leave it to Tom. He'll get an answer yet, you\r\nsee if he doesn't.\"\r\n\r\n It was an hour past midnight. Tom tossed uneasily on the hard bed\r\nin the wireless shack. The telephone receiver on his ear hurt him,\r\nand he could not sleep.\r\n\r\n\"I may as well sit up for a while,\" he told himself, and he arose.\r\nIn the dimness of the shack he could see the outlines of the dynamo\r\nand the motor.\r\n\r\n\"Guess I'll start her up, and send out some calls,\" he murmured. \"I\r\nmight just happen to catch some ship operator who is up late. I'll\r\ntry it.\"\r\n\r\nThe young inventor started the motor, and soon the dynamo was\r\npurring away. He tested the wireless apparatus. It shot out great\r\nlong sparks, which snapped viciously through the air. Then, in the\r\nsilence of the night, Tom clicked off his call for help for the\r\ncastaways of Earthquake Island.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour he sent it away into space, none of the others in\r\ntheir shacks below him, awakening. Then Tom, having worked off his\r\nrestless fit, was about to return to bed.\r\n\r\nBut what was this? What was that clicking in the telephone receiver\r\nat his ear? He listened. It was not a jumble of dots and dashes,\r\nconveying through space a message that meant nothing to him. No! It\r\nwas his own call that was answered. The call of his station--\"E.\r\nI.\"--Earthquake Island!\r\n\r\n\"WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT'S WANTED?\"\r\n\r\nThat was the message that was clicked to Tom from somewhere in the\r\ngreat void.\r\n\r\n\"I GET YOUR MESSAGE 'E. I.' WHAT'S WANTED? DO I HEAR YOU RIGHT?\r\nREPEAT.\" Tom heard those questions in the silence of the night.\r\n\r\nWith trembling fingers Tom pressed his own key. Out into the\r\ndarkness went his call for help.\r\n\r\n\"WE ARE ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND.\" He gave the longitude and latitude.\r\n\"COME QUICKLY OR WE WILL BE ENGULFED IN THE SEA! WE ARE CASTAWAYS\r\nFROM THE YACHT 'RESOLUTE,' AND THE AIRSHIP 'WHIZZER.' CAN YOU SAVE\r\nUS?\"\r\n\r\nCame then this query:\r\n\r\n\"WHAT'S THAT ABOUT AIRSHIP?\"\r\n\r\n\"NEVER MIND AIRSHIP,\" clicked Tom. \"SEND HELP QUICKLY! WHO ARE YOU?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer flashed to him through space:\r\n\r\n\"STEAMSHIP 'CAMBARANIAN' FROM RIO DE JANEIRO TO NEW YORK. JUST\r\nCAUGHT YOUR MESSAGE. THOUGHT IT A FAKE.\"\r\n\r\n\"NO FAKE,\" Tom sent back. \"HELP US QUICKLY! HOW SOON CAN YOU COME?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a wait, and the wireless operator clicked to Tom that he\r\nhad called the captain. Then came the report:\r\n\r\n\"WE WILL BE THERE WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS. KEEP IN COMMUNICATION\r\nWITH US.\"\r\n\r\n\"YOU BET I WILL,\" flashed back Tom, his heart beating joyously, and\r\nthen he let out a great shout. \"We are saved! We are saved! My\r\nwireless message is answered! A steamer is on her way to rescue us!\"\r\n\r\nHe rushed from the shack, calling to the others.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" demanded Mr. Hosbrook.\r\n\r\nTom briefly told of how the message had come to him in the night.\r\n\r\n\"Tell them to hurry,\" begged the rich yacht owner. \"Say that I will\r\ngive twenty thousand dollars reward if we are taken off!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll do the same,\" cried Mr. Jenks. \"I must get to the place\r\nwhere--\" Then he seemed to recollect himself, and stopped suddenly.\r\n\"Tell them to hurry,\" he begged Tom. The whole crowd of castaways,\r\nsave the women, were gathered about the wireless shack.\r\n\r\n\"They'll need to hurry,\" spoke Mr. Parker, the gloomy scientist.\r\n\"The island may sink before morning!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hosbrook and the others glared at him, but he seemed to take\r\ndelight in his prediction.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the wireless instruments hummed.\r\n\r\n\"Another message,\" whispered Tom. He listened.\r\n\r\n\"THE 'CAMBARANIAN' WILL RUSH HERE WITH ALL SPEED,\" he announced, and\r\nnot a heart there on that lonely and desolate island but sent up a\r\nprayer of thankfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\"WE ARE LOST!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was little more sleep for any one that night. They sat up,\r\ntalking over the wonderful and unexpected outcome of Tom Swift's\r\nwireless message, and speculating as to when the steamer would get\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my pocket comb! But I told you it would come out all right,\r\nif we left it to Tom!\" declared Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"But it hasn't come out yet,\" remarked the pessimistic scientist.\r\n\"The steamer may arrive too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a cheerful sort of fellow to take on a yachting trip,\"\r\nmurmured Mr. Hosbrook, sarcastically. \"I'll never invite you again,\r\neven if you are a great scientist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to sit and watch for the steamer,\" declared Mr. Damon, as\r\nhe went outside the shack. The night was warm, and there was a full\r\nmoon. \"Which way will she come from, Tom?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, but I should think, that if she was on her way north,\r\nfrom South America, she'd pass on the side of the island on which we\r\nnow are.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" agreed Captain Mentor. \"She'll come up from over\r\nthere,\" and he pointed across the ocean directly in front of the\r\nshacks and camp.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm going to see if I can't be the first to sight her lights,\"\r\ndeclared Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\n\"She can't possibly get here inside of a day, according to what the\r\noperator said,\" declared Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Wire them to put on all the speed they can,\" urged the eccentric\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"No, don't waste any more power or energy than is needed,\" suggested\r\nMr. Hosbrook. \"You may need the gasolene before we are rescued. They\r\nare on their way, and that is enough for now.\"\r\n\r\nThe others agreed with this, and so Tom, after a final message to\r\nthe operator aboard the CAMBARANIAN stating that he would call him\r\nup in the morning, shut down the motor.\r\n\r\nMr. Damon took up his position where he could see far out over the\r\nocean, but, as the young inventor had said, there was no possible\r\nchance of sighting the relief steamer inside of a day. Still the\r\nnervous, eccentric man declared that he would keep watch.\r\n\r\nMorning came, and castaways brought to breakfast a better appetite\r\nthan they had had in some time. They were allowed larger rations,\r\ntoo, for it was seen that they would have just enough food to last\r\nuntil taken off.\r\n\r\n\"We didn't need to have made the big raft,\" said Mr. Fenwick, as Tom\r\ncame down from his station, to report that he had been in\r\ncommunication with the Camabarian and that she was proceeding under\r\nforced draught. \"We'll not have to embark on it, and I'm glad of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we may need it yet,\" asserted Mr. Parker. \"I have been making\r\nsome observations just now, and the island is in a very precarious\r\nstate. It is, I believe, resting on only a slim foundation, and the\r\nleast shock may break that off, and send it into the sea. That is\r\nwhat my observations point out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I wish you wouldn't make any more observations!\" exclaimed\r\nMrs. Nestor, with spirit. \"You make me nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"And me, also,\" added Mrs. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\"Science can not deceive, madam,\" retorted Mr. Parker.\r\n\r\n\"Well it can keep quiet about what it knows, and not make a person\r\nhave cold chills,\" replied Mary's mother. \"I'm sure we will be\r\nrescued in time.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a slight tremor of an earthquake, as they were eating\r\ndinner that day, but, aside from causing a little alarm it did no\r\ndamage. In the afternoon, Tom again called up the approaching\r\nsteamer, and was informed that, because of a slight accident, it\r\ncould not arrive until the next morning. Every effort would be made\r\nto keep up speed, it was said. There was much disappointment over\r\nthis, and Mr. Damon was observed to be closely examining the food\r\nsupply, but hope was too strong to be easily shattered now.\r\n\r\nMr. Parker went off alone, to make some further \"observations\" as he\r\ncalled them, but Mr. Hosbrook warned him never again to speak of his\r\nalarming theories.\r\n\r\nMr. Barcoe Jenks called Tom aside just before supper that evening.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't forgotten what I said to you about my diamonds,\" he\r\nremarked, with many nods and winks. \"I'll show you how to make them,\r\nif you will help me. Did you ever see diamonds made?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, and I guess very few persons have.\" replied the lad, thinking\r\nperhaps Mr. Jenks might not be quite right, mentally.\r\n\r\nThe night passed without alarm, and in the morning, at the first\r\nblush of dawn, every one was astir, looking eagerly across the sea\r\nfor a sight of the steamer.\r\n\r\nTom had just come down from the wireless station, having received a\r\nmessage to the effect that a few hours more would bring the\r\nCAMBARANIAN within sight of the island.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a tremendous shock, as if some great cannon had\r\nbeen fired, and the whole island shook to its very centre.\r\n\r\n\"Another earthquake! The worst yet!\" screamed Mrs. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\"We are lost!\" cried Mrs. Nestor, clinging to her husband.\r\n\r\nAn instant later they were all thrown down by the tremor of the\r\nearth, and Tom, looking toward his wireless station, saw nearly half\r\nof the island disappear from sight. His station went down in\r\ncollapse with it, splashing into the ocean, and the wave that\r\nfollowed the terrible crash washed nearly to the castaways, as they\r\nrose and kneeled on the sand.\r\n\r\n\"The island is sinking!\" cried Mr. Parker. \"Make for the raft!\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess it's our only chance,\" murmured Captain Mentor, as he gazed\r\nacross the water. There was no steamer in sight. Could it arrive on\r\ntime? The tremors and shaking of the island continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE--CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nDown to where the small raft was moored ran Mr. Parker. He was\r\nfollowed by some of the others.\r\n\r\n\"We must put off at once!\" he cried. \"Half the island is gone! The\r\nother half may disappear any moment! The steamer can not get here on\r\ntime, but if we put off they may pick us up, if we are not engulfed\r\nin the ocean. Help, everybody!\"\r\n\r\nTom gave one more look at where his wireless station had been. It\r\nhad totally disappeared, there being, at the spot, now but a sheer\r\ncliff, which went right down into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe women were in tears. The men, with pale faces, tried to calm\r\nthem. Gradually the earthquake tremor passed away; but who could\r\ntell when another would come?\r\n\r\nCaptain Mentor, Mr. Hosbrook and the others were shoving out the\r\nsmall raft. They intended to get aboard, and paddle out to the\r\nlarger one, which had been moored some distance away, in readiness\r\nfor some such emergency as this.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" cried Mr. Fenwick to Tom who was lingering behind. \"Come\r\non, ladies. We must all get aboard, or it may be too late!\"\r\n\r\nThe small raft was afloat. Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Nestor, weeping\r\nhysterically, waded out through the water to get aboard.\r\n\r\n\"Have we food?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Bless my kitchen range! but I\r\nnearly forgot that.\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't any food left to take,\" answered Mrs. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\"Shove off!\" cried Captain Mentor.\r\n\r\nAt that instant a haze which had hung over the water, was blown to\r\none side. The horizon suddenly cleared. Tom Swift looked up and gave\r\na cry.\r\n\r\n\"The steamer! The steamer! The CAMBARANIAN!\" he shouted, pointing to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe others joined in his exclamations of joy, for there, rushing\r\ntoward Earthquake Island was a great steamer, crowding on all speed!\r\n\r\n\"Saved! Saved!\" cried Mrs. Nestor, sinking to her knees even in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"It came just in time!\" murmured Mr. Hosbrook.\r\n\r\n\"Now I can make my diamonds,\" whispered Mr. Jenks to Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Push off! Push off!\" cried Mr. Parker. \"The island will sink,\r\nsoon!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we will be safer on the island than on the raft,\" declared\r\nCaptain Mentor. \"We had better land again.\"\r\n\r\nThey left the little raft, and stood on the shore of the island.\r\nEagerly they watched the approach of the steamer. They could make\r\nout hands and handkerchiefs waving to them now. There was eager hope\r\nin every heart.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, some distance out in the water, and near where the big\r\nraft was anchored, there was a curious upheaval of the ocean. It was\r\nas if a submarine mine had exploded! The sea swirled and foamed!\r\n\r\n\"It's a good thing we didn't go out there,\" observed Captain Mentor.\r\n\"We would have been swamped, sure as guns.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost as he spoke the big raft was tossed high into the air, and\r\nfell back, breaking up. The castaways shuddered. Yet were they any\r\nsafer on the island? They fancied they could feel the little part of\r\nit that remained trembling under their feet.\r\n\r\n\"The steamer is stopping!\" cried Mr. Damon.\r\n\r\nSurely enough the CAMBARANIAN had slowed up. Was she not going to\r\ncomplete the rescue she had begun?\r\n\r\n\"She's going to launch her lifeboats,\" declared Captain Mentor. \"Her\r\ncommander dare not approach too close, not knowing the water. He\r\nmight hit on a rock.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later and two lifeboats were lowered, and, urged on by the\r\nsturdy arms of the sailors, they bounded over the waves. The sea\r\nseemed to be more and more agitated.\r\n\r\n\"It is the beginning of the end,\" murmured Mr. Parker. \"The island\r\nwill soon disappear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you be quiet?\" demanded Mr. Damon, giving the scientist a\r\nnudge in the ribs.\r\n\r\nThe lifeboats were close at hand now.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all there?\" shouted some one, evidently in command.\r\n\r\n\"All here,\" answered Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Then hurry aboard. There seems to be something going on in these\r\nwaters--perhaps a submarine volcano eruption. We must get away in a\r\nhurry!\"\r\n\r\nThe boats came in to the shelving beach. There was a little stretch\r\nof water between them and the sand. Through this the castaways\r\nwaded, and soon they were grasped by the sailors and helped in. In\r\nthe reaction of their worriment Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Nestor were\r\nboth weeping, but their tears were those of joy.\r\n\r\n\"Give way now, men!\" cried the mate in charge of the boats. \"We must\r\nget back to the ship!\"\r\n\r\nThe sea was now swirling angrily, but the sailors, who had been in\r\nworse turmoils than this, rowed on steadily.\r\n\r\n\"We feared you would not get here in time,\" said Tom to the mate.\r\n\r\n\"We were under forced draught most of the way,\" was his answer.\r\n\"Your wireless message came just in time. An hour later and our\r\noperator would have gone to bed.\"\r\n\r\nThe young inventor realized by what a narrow margin they had been\r\nrescued.\r\n\r\n\"The island will soon sink,\" predicted Mr. Parker, as they reached\r\nthe steamer, and boarded her. Captain Valasquez, who was in command,\r\nwarmly welcomed the castaways.\r\n\r\n\"We will hear your story later,\" he said. \"Just now I want to get\r\nout of these dangerous waters.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave the order for full speed, and, as the CAMBARANIAN got under\r\nway, Tom, and the others, standing on the deck, looked back at\r\nEarthquake Island.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there sounded a dull, rumbling report. The whole ocean\r\nabout the island seemed to upheave. There was a gigantic shower of\r\nspray, a sound like an explosion, and when the waters subsided the\r\nisland had sunk from sight.\r\n\r\n\"I told you it would go,\" cried Mr. Parker, triumphantly, but the\r\nhorror of it all--the horror of the fate that would have been theirs\r\nhad they remained there an hour longer--held the castaways dumb. The\r\nscientist's honor of having correctly predicted the destruction of\r\nthe island was an empty one.\r\n\r\nThe agitation of the sea rocked even the mighty CAMBARANIAN and, had\r\nour friends been aboard the frail raft, they would surely have\r\nperished in the sea. As it was, they were safe--saved by Tom Swift's\r\nwireless message.\r\n\r\nThe steamer resumed her voyage, and the castaways told their story.\r\nCaptain Valasquez refused to receive the large amount of money Mr.\r\nHasbrook and Mr. Jenks would have paid him for the rescue, accepting\r\nonly a sum he figured that he had lost by the delay, which was not a\r\ngreat deal. The castaways were given the best aboard the ship, and\r\ntheir stories were listened to by the other passengers with bated\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nIn due time they were landed in New York, and Mr. and Mrs. Nestor\r\naccompanied Tom to Shopton. Mr. Damon, with many blessings also\r\naccompanied them, going to his home in Waterfield. Later it was\r\nlearned that the other boats from the RESOLUTE had been picked up,\r\nand the sailors and guests were all saved.\r\n\r\nOf course, as soon as our friends had been rescued by the steamer,\r\nthe wireless operator aboard her, with whom Tom soon struck up an\r\nacquaintance, sent messages to the relatives of the castaways,\r\napprising them of their safety.\r\n\r\nAnd the joy of Mary Nestor, when she found that it was Tom who had\r\nsaved her parents, can well be imagined. As for our hero, well, he\r\nwas glad too--for Mary's sake.\r\n\r\n\"I won't forget my promise to you, Tom Swift,\" said Mr. Barcoe\r\nJenks, as he parted from the young inventor, and what the promise\r\nwas will be told in the next volume of this series, to be called:\r\n\"Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers; or, The Secret of Phantom\r\nMountain.\" In that Tom is destined to have many more surprising\r\nadventures, as is also Mr. Damon, who learned new ways to call down\r\nblessings on himself and his possessions.\r\n\r\nAnd now, for a time, we will take leave of the young inventor and\r\nalso of his many friends, who never ceased to wonder over Tom\r\nSwift's skill with the wireless.\r\n\r\nTHE END",
