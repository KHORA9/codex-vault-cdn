Some of the plans may be useful in eases where, in addition\r\nto the main dwelling, smaller homes are needed for relatives, tenants,\r\nor unmarried farm hands. Still others will be found useful in the\r\nconstruction of low-cost houses for temporary use.\r\n\r\nA well-built farmhouse should last for 60 years or more. In the ordinary\r\ncourse of events at least two generations of children will be brought up\r\nin it. During these years the family operating the farm probably will\r\nhave no other choice of dwelling. The builder should, therefore, think\r\nboth of present needs and possible future requirements when selecting a\r\nplan for a new farmhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMHOUSE REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE\r\n\r\nThe first requirement of a satisfactory farmhouse is adequate size to\r\nprovide needed working area, storage space, and living and sleeping\r\nquarters. For the average family at least three sleeping rooms are\r\nneeded,[2] one for the parents, one for the boys, and one for the girls.\r\n\r\n[2] Sometimes the living room must serve as one of the sleeping rooms.\r\n\r\nAll the space may not be needed at the time the house is built, but\r\nthe chances are that it will be needed before many years. On the other\r\nhand, many families find that after the children have grown up and left\r\nhome it is not necessary to use the entire house. For this reason it is\r\ndesirable to have it arranged so that part of the rooms may be closed off\r\nor may be rented to tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMFORT AND CONVENIENCE\r\n\r\nAdequate, well-used space for both the family and the furniture is\r\na large factor in farmhouse comfort. The proper number, size, and\r\nplacement of windows, doors, and stairs, and good construction are\r\nimportant. These matters have been carefully worked out in the plans\r\nshown in this bulletin. Comfort also depends to a large extent on good\r\nheating, plumbing, lighting, and screening. Information on some of these\r\nsubjects is given in Farmers' Bulletin 1698, Heating the Farm Home; 1448,\r\nFarmstead Water Supply; 1426, Farm Plumbing; 1227, Sewage and Sewerage of\r\nFarm Homes; Department Circular 405, The Domestic Oil Burner; and in U.S.\r\nDepartment of Commerce bulletin, Insulation on the Farm, price 10 cents.\r\n\r\nThe convenient arrangement of the farmhouse begins with its relationship\r\nto the other farm buildings and to the highway. Unlike the city house,\r\nthe farmhouse has its main line of communication through the back or side\r\ndoor. Therefore outside doors and porches should be located so as to give\r\nconvenient entrance from the farm driveway and the path to the barn, and\r\nwherever possible should be on the sheltered side of the house.\r\n\r\nIf possible, there should be a convenient place near the rear entrance\r\nfor men to leave their outer wraps and to wash before going into the\r\nhouse. These facilities are often provided in a washroom or in one corner\r\nof the workroom, but if there is no washroom or workroom in the house,\r\nthere should at least be clothes hooks and a bench and washbasin for\r\nsummer use on the back porch.\r\n\r\nIt is also desirable that the work portions of the house, where the\r\nhousewife spends much of her time, look out over the farm buildings and\r\nthe entrance roadway. Most farm women like also a glimpse of the highway\r\nfrom the kitchen window.\r\n\r\nPreferably the traffic way from the rear entrance to the main portion of\r\nthe house should not lead through the kitchen. If the kitchen must be\r\nused as a passageway, the doors should be so arranged that the traffic\r\ndoes not cross the work area. This not only decreases the possibility\r\nof interference with household activities but also makes possible a\r\nmore compact and convenient arrangement of work equipment. An important\r\nfactor is a workroom or porch, on about the same level as the kitchen,\r\nfor laundry, canning, care of milk, and other farm activities and for\r\nsupplementary food storage. This saves much clutter in the kitchen itself\r\nand contributes to more efficient arrangement.\r\n\r\nAt least one bedroom should be provided on the first-floor of the\r\nfarmhouse, not too far from the kitchen, so that small children or\r\nsick persons may be cared for conveniently. The bathroom should be\r\nconvenient to both downstairs and upstairs bedrooms, but preferably on\r\nthe first-floor. A space for a bathroom is very desirable even if the\r\nfixtures cannot be put in at once.\r\n\r\nAmple storage space should be provided for clothing, bedding and linen,\r\nwraps, food, dishes and utensils, cleaning equipment, toys, and fuel. In\r\ngeneral, these needs have been met in the plans given in this bulletin\r\nby closets in halls and bedrooms, kitchen cabinets, shelves or pantries,\r\nand cellar storage. Closet, cabinet, and shelf space adds greatly to the\r\nconvenience and comfort of a house and should not be omitted.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] Plans for closets and storage spaces can be obtained from the Bureau\r\nof Home Economics.\r\n\r\nIn the smaller plans shown here, an alcove or an end of the kitchen is\r\nindicated for use as a dining area. In the larger plans, either a dining\r\nroom or a space for dining in the living room is provided, and in most\r\ncases there is also space in the kitchen for \"hurry-up\" meals.\r\n\r\nThe following points have been kept in mind in planning the kitchens.\r\n\r\nA sink in every house is recommended. Even when water must be carried\r\ninto the house, the sink and drain add much to the convenience of the\r\nkitchen and may be installed very cheaply. Where running water is not\r\navailable, a pump may be installed beside the sink. However, running\r\nwater, hot and cold, adds more to the convenience of the farm-home than\r\nalmost any other factor.\r\n\r\nThe sink should be well-lighted, with windows over or at one end of it.\r\nWindows over the sink should have the sills higher than the back of the\r\nsink. Such windows will need to be shielded from sun glare unless on the\r\nnorth side of the house. The sink should have a drain board at the left\r\nend, at the right a flat shelf for stacking dishes if there is no drain\r\nboard there. Dish storage should be near enough the left end of the sink\r\nfor the dishes to be put away without unnecessary steps.\r\n\r\nThe cookstove should be conveniently near the sink, preferably against\r\nthe side wall, or across from it if the kitchen is narrow.\r\n\r\nA small food-preparation surface, table or shelf, should be placed next\r\nto the stove at the same height as the cooking surface. There should be\r\ncupboard space near the stove for the storage of cooking utensils. A\r\nworktable should be provided for long mixing jobs; it should have knee\r\nspace and toe space. Staple supplies should be stored near this table\r\nand, if possible, should be near the refrigerator and not too far from\r\nthe stove.\r\n\r\nThe refrigerator should, for convenient use, be as near as possible\r\nto the worktable and stove; however, the higher the surrounding\r\ntemperature the greater the cost of operating the refrigerator. If an\r\nice refrigerator is used, a location near the outside door lessens the\r\ntracking of dirt into the house. A ventilated cupboard near the worktable\r\nis convenient for storing the less perishable foods and reduces the\r\nseason during which ice is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION TO OTHER BUILDINGS AND HIGHWAY\r\n\r\nA house designed for the south or west side of the highway should be\r\nreversed if it is to be built on the north or east. For example, plan\r\n6521 (p. 24) would fit nicely on either the south or the west side of\r\nthe main road. If it were south of the highway, with the drive as shown,\r\nthe kitchen would be on the east where it would have the advantage of\r\nthe morning sunlight and in most localities the screened porch would be\r\nsheltered from the coldest winds. If the house were on the west side of\r\nthe road, the kitchen would still get morning sunlight, and the porch\r\nwould protect it from the afternoon sun. On the other hand, if the house\r\nwere to be built on the north or east side of the road, the kitchen\r\nwould be badly sheltered and lighted, but reversing the plan so that the\r\nkitchen would be on the right instead of the left side of the house would\r\nremedy these conditions.\r\n\r\nBefore deciding to build any house the plan should be studied carefully\r\nto see how it will best fit the location and the arrangement of the rest\r\nof the farmstead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEARANCE\r\n\r\nAttractive appearance of a farmhouse is to be obtained by:\r\n\r\n  Good taste in its proportions and exterior design.\r\n\r\n  Materials chosen to suit the local environment and type of house,\r\n    effectively employed.\r\n\r\n  A pleasing color scheme for the house, in harmony with its\r\n    surroundings.\r\n\r\n  Proper planning with relation to the natural features of the site,\r\n    the other farm buildings, and the highway.\r\n\r\n  Grading the site and planting trees, shrubs, and flowers.\r\n\r\nIf the homes shown in this bulletin are carefully built according to the\r\ndrawings, they will be satisfactory with respect to the first two points.\r\n\r\nProper location of the house is exceedingly important and must be worked\r\nout on the ground. Farmers' Bulletin 1132, Planning the Farmstead, and\r\n1087. Beautifying the Farmstead, will be found helpful in this and in the\r\nplanting of trees and shrubs around the house. Farmers' Bulletin 1452,\r\nPainting on the Farm, discusses kinds and uses of paints. Other bulletins\r\non these subjects are available from several of the State agricultural\r\ncolleges.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFETY\r\n\r\nSafety in the farmhouse depends first on good construction for protection\r\nfrom damage by wind, fire, decay, and termites. Safety is promoted\r\nalso by planning to avoid hazards from low beams, steep or unguarded\r\nstairways, or badly placed doors and windows. The working drawings for\r\nthe houses illustrated herein embody good practice in these matters. The\r\nwelfare and convenience of the occupants will be further permanently\r\nsafeguarded through rat-proof construction, which eliminates \"rat\r\nharbors\", and denies easy entrance of the rodents to the building.\r\nAdditional safety may be secured at slight cost by following the\r\nrecommendations in Farmers' Bulletins 1590, Fire Protective Construction\r\non the Farm; 1638, Rat Proofing Buildings and Premises; and 1649,\r\nConstruction of Chimneys and Fireplaces; Leaflet 87, Wind-Resistant\r\nConstruction for Farm Buildings, and Leaflet 101, Injury to Buildings by\r\nTermites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION MATERIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe houses shown in this bulletin may, with slight changes, be built of\r\nwood, stone, concrete, brick, tile, earth, steel, or other materials.\r\nThe choice depends largely on owner's preference, local availability and\r\nprice, and the skill of local builders in using one or another. Many new\r\nmaterials for various purposes such as roofing, flooring, and insulation\r\nare on the market and deserve consideration.\r\n\r\nThe practice common among farmers of hauling their own stone or concrete\r\nmaterials, cutting their own logs where possible, having their lumber\r\nsawed at local mills, and doing part of the actual construction work, aid\r\nin reducing the cash outlay and in making possible a better house for the\r\nsame money expenditure. This is especially true where lumber is sawed\r\nlong enough before building starts to allow thorough seasoning. This\r\nseasoning of lumber is important and is too often disregarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory way to learn the probable cost of a house is to\r\nobtain estimates from one or more local builders. Approximate costs may,\r\nof course, be obtained by comparing the proposed house with one built\r\nrecently in the same community, or rough estimates may be based on the\r\nsize of the house and typical unit costs for the locality.\r\n\r\nUnit costs based on prices and wages prevailing in the spring of 1934 for\r\nhouses suitable for the localities were obtained for about 300 counties\r\nby the Farm Housing Survey, A summary of the figures is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nCELLARS\r\n\r\nCosts for ordinary cellars were reported for most sections as varying\r\nfrom 50 cents to $1 per square foot of floor space. The cost per square\r\nfoot is, of course, less for a large than for a small cellar, other\r\nthings being equal. Easy excavation and low-cost materials also make\r\nfor low unit cost. Costs of nearly $2 per square foot were reported in\r\nsome sections where the ground-water level is high and cellar walls and\r\nfloor must be carefully waterproofed. In sections where cellars are not\r\nordinarily used the cost of the foundation was reported as part of the\r\ncost of the house superstructure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERSTRUCTURES AND PORCHES\r\n\r\nReported costs of one-story frame superstructures, including heating,\r\nplumbing, and lighting equipment ordinarily used in the locality, ranged\r\nfrom $1.25 to $2.25 per square foot of floor space in the South, from\r\n$2.25 to $3.50 in the West and Southwest, from $2.50 to $4 in the North,\r\nand from $3 to $4.50 in New England. Costs in Maryland, Virginia, and\r\nWest Virginia and in a narrow belt along the east coast, including\r\nFlorida, were reported from $2 to $3.25, and in the timber-producing\r\nsections of the Northwest at about $2 per square foot. Costs in any\r\nlocality are influenced by local factors, generally being relatively high\r\nnear cities and in thickly settled sections and relatively low in places\r\nwhere there are local supplies of lumber or other materials.\r\n\r\nDifferences in cost between the various sections are due to differences\r\nin the kinds of houses built, as well as to differences in material\r\ncosts and wages. The typical house in the North is much more compact and\r\nsubstantial and provided with more expensive heating equipment than the\r\ntypical house in the South.\r\n\r\nThe cost per square foot of floor area of two-story frame houses was\r\nreported as being 5 to 15 percent less than that of one-story houses in\r\nthe same locality.\r\n\r\nThe costs of typical masonry superstructures were generally reported\r\nat $2 to $3 per square foot of floor area in the southern third of the\r\nUnited States, from $3 to $4 per square foot in the central third, and\r\nmore than $4 per square foot in the northern third of the country. There\r\nwere many variations from these general levels, however, costs of about\r\n$2 per square foot being reported in many localities in the States\r\nbordering on or south of the Ohio River. Costs reported for counties\r\nalong the Atlantic and Gulf coasts were generally higher than for those\r\nin the interior. Little difference in cost per square foot of floor area\r\nin one-story and in two-story masonry houses was reported. The higher\r\ncosts reported for masonry houses as compared with frame are probably\r\ndue in part to better grades of finish and equipment used in the masonry\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nThe costs per square foot of floor space of open porches were reported as\r\nbeing about half the costs per square foot of floor space in one-story\r\nhouses of similar materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATING BY UNIT COSTS\r\n\r\nThe floor areas of the cellar, the porches, and the house itself (the\r\nsuperstructure) are shown with each plan. They do not include unexcavated\r\ncellar space nor unfinished space in attics. The areas were figured from\r\nthe working drawings (see p. 7) because in some cases the dimensions\r\ngiven in the plans herein are approximate only. The superstructure area\r\nof a house of more than one story is given here as the area of the\r\nfirst-floor plus the usable area of the second-floor. Stairways, halls,\r\nand closets are included. To estimate very roughly what a house might\r\ncost, multiply the number of square feet of cellar floor space by a cost\r\nper square foot based on the costs stated above. Do the same for the\r\nhouse superstructure and the porches, and add the figures together. This,\r\nwith allowance for price changes since the spring of 1934, will give\r\na rough estimate of total cost of the house. The actual cost will, of\r\ncourse, be affected by the materials and home equipment which the owner\r\nselects and by the skill and efficiency of the builders.\r\n\r\nIf the owner can furnish part of the material or labor, or if interior\r\nfinish or equipment is omitted, the initial cash outlay may be reduced.\r\nEstimates based on local prices and wage rates are to be preferred to\r\nthose based on the cost figures given above.\r\n\r\nLittle study has been given to what amounts farm people are justified\r\nin spending for their houses, but several investigations have been\r\nmade of expenditures for housing by people with fixed incomes. It is\r\ngenerally agreed that the house ordinarily should not cost more than two\r\nand one-half times the average annual net income of the family. In the\r\ncase of the farm family the value of the living furnished by the farm\r\nshould be considered as part of the income. Another generally accepted\r\nrule, which perhaps is more nearly applicable to farm conditions, is\r\nthat not more than 25 percent--usually not more than 20 percent--of the\r\naverage annual net income of the family should be required for housing,\r\nincluding principal payments, interest, taxes, insurance, repairs, and\r\nmiscellaneous costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING DRAWINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking drawings have been prepared giving all necessary dimensions\r\nand details for building these homes. Farmers may obtain copies of\r\nthese drawings from the agricultural extension services of the State\r\nagricultural colleges. The State extension services will supply only\r\nthose plans which are suitable in their respective States, and usually\r\nwill make a small charge to cover printing and mailing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUTION REGARDING CHANGES\r\n\r\nThese plans have been carefully prepared by competent architects in\r\nconsultation with home-management specialists and agricultural engineers\r\nfamiliar with farm conditions in all parts of the United States. It is\r\nurged that the plans be studied carefully before making a selection,\r\nbut that no changes be made in them except for alternate arrangements\r\nindicated by the drawings or descriptions. Changing the size of a room or\r\nthe location of a door or window may spoil some other valuable feature,\r\nand is almost certain to harm the appearance of the house. Doors and\r\nwindows should be selected according to the descriptive material on the\r\ndrawings. Sizes should be closely adhered to for best appearance.\r\n\r\nThe prospective builder should not try to obtain too much originality,\r\nbut rather should base his selection on those features of the plan which\r\nwill give the utmost satisfaction in the long run. Differences in slope\r\nof ground, location of the drive and farm buildings, and position and\r\namount of trees and shrubbery, all will contribute to the distinctive\r\nappearance of the home.\r\n\r\nFor homes of the type offered in this bulletin, the surroundings should\r\nbe kept free from distracting adornments. As a general rule, a few trees\r\nto provide shade, some flowering shrubs of native growth grouped close to\r\nthe building to break harsh lines, and a bed or two of flowers selected\r\nfor their color value, will be sufficient decorative relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANS FOR HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 40 house plans shown in this bulletin have been arranged in four\r\ngroups representing, respectively, (1) 1-story growing houses; (2)\r\n1-story houses originally built with two or more separate bedrooms; (3)\r\nhouses of 1-1/2 or 2 stories; and (4) very small houses. Some of the\r\nplans might have been placed in another group about as well as in that in\r\nwhich they are shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE-STORY GROWING HOUSES\r\n\r\nThere are many arguments in favor of the growing house for the farm. The\r\nfirst unit can be erected at a moderate cost, yet the finished house may\r\nhave all the features considered important. As more space is needed the\r\nowner often can build the additions himself, taking advantage of slack\r\ntimes to cut lumber from his own land, haul sand and gravel for concrete,\r\nand in other ways reduce the cost of the additions. The chief difficulty\r\nwith the growing house is that it is likely to grow very slowly. By the\r\ntime additions are made the house is considered old by its occupants,\r\nand the additions are likely not to receive as careful attention as the\r\noriginal house.\r\n\r\nThe growing houses in this bulletin have been carefully planned so\r\nthat both the first units and the final structure are satisfactory in\r\nusefulness and in appearance. The additions fit into the original units\r\nwith a minimum of ripping out and rearrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6511,[4] FOR THE SOUTHWEST\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, first unit 605 square feet; with\r\n  1-bedroom addition 815 square feet; with 2-bedroom addition 960 square\r\n  feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORIGINAL HOUSE]\r\n\r\nThis plan is for a permanent dwelling of frame, stucco, stone, adobe,\r\nor other construction. If desired, the first unit may be built without\r\nbedrooms, as shown, and the living room used for sleeping quarters until\r\nthe house is completed. The two large closets of this living room add\r\nmuch to its value, and the arrangement with all doors at one end of the\r\nroom permits efficient use of the space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nIf the first unit is to be used for several years before the bedrooms are\r\nadded, the small bathroom with shower will be especially desirable. That\r\nspace must be used for other purposes, however, and the bathroom fixtures\r\nmoved when one or both bedrooms are added.\r\n\r\nAn alternate kitchen arrangement suggested by the Bureau of Home\r\nEconomics for houses in which only an oil, gas, or electric stove is\r\nneeded and meals will usually be eaten in the living-dining room is shown\r\non page 9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLANS]\r\n\r\n[4] Prepared by W. K. Bartges and Earl Barnett for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, University of California.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6512,[5] FOR THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, first stage 715 square feet; second stage\r\n  with one bedroom 1,085 square feet; third stage 1,515 square feet.\r\n  Porch, 250 square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF ORIGINAL HOUSE]\r\n\r\nPlan 6512 is designed for southern conditions, to afford ample shade from\r\na glaring summer sun. The arrangement of rooms permits the building to\r\nface toward the south, thus taking advantage of the summer breezes from\r\nthat direction. The glazed porch on the north side offers a cool spot for\r\nsummer meals, while the meals served during cold weather would naturally\r\nbe more enjoyable in front of a blazing fire at the west end of the\r\nliving room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nThe second stage of the house adds the center bedroom of the three shown\r\nin the third stage. The partitions for the hall and the closets near the\r\nsouth porch are not needed until the third stage. If at all possible,\r\nthe center bedroom should be built with the original unit to provide\r\nmore sleeping space; but if it is necessary to watch the budget closely,\r\nthe large living room or the glazed porch can be pressed into temporary\r\nservice as sleeping quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN WITH ADDED BEDROOM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN WITH TWO ADDED BEDROOMS]\r\n\r\n[5] Prepared by J. B. Atkinson and J. E. Hudson for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6513,[6] FOR THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, first unit 490 square feet; with first\r\n  addition 705 square feet; completed house 1,015 square feet. Porches,\r\n  first unit 25 square feet; with first addition 240 square feet.\r\n\r\nThe first unit of house 6513 is modest, and yet provides complete kitchen\r\nequipment, toilet facilities, a workroom or laundry, and g bedroom of\r\ncomfortable size. The first addition increases the living accommodations\r\nand, with its front and rear porches, offers a cool retreat in hot\r\nweather. The second addition provides two more bedrooms and an adjoining\r\nbath, thus completing the six-room house. If desired, these two bedrooms\r\nmay be made larger than shown in the plans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF INTERIOR]\r\n\r\nThe interior view shows the compact arrangement of kitchen cabinets and\r\nsink, and indicates the bright work area that is planned to lighten the\r\nduties of the housewife. An alternate arrangement of the kitchen, with no\r\nworkroom, is shown on page 13.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two stages of development adequate space will be found\r\nin the kitchen for dining; but when two bedrooms are added in the final\r\nwing, the original bedroom (adjoining the kitchen) might be converted\r\ninto a dining room. On the other hand, if at times the entire house is\r\nnot needed by the family, the last wing of the house will make very\r\ndesirable rooms for renting to tourists or summer boarders, or may be\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the South the fireplace will not provide sufficient\r\nheat in cold weather, but a circulator heater may be set in front of the\r\nfireplace and connected to the chimney through a metal shield. If the\r\nplan is used in the North, a cellar may be constructed under the second\r\nunit, with stairs leading down from the rear porch, which should be\r\nenclosed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLANS]\r\n\r\n[6] Prepared by W. H. Nash for the Bureaus of Agricultural Engineering\r\nand Home Economics, U.S. Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6514,[7] FOR THE MIDDLE WEST\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, original house 670 square feet; with\r\n  addition 940 square feet. Cellar, 255 square feet. Porches, 120 square\r\n  feet.\r\n\r\nHouse 6514, with basement and furnace, is well adapted to northern or\r\nmid-western conditions. The steps to the basement may be outside the\r\nbuilding as shown, or the washroom may be extended so as to include the\r\nsteps and provide greater protection during stormy weather.\r\n\r\nThe original house, in order to come in the class of low-cost houses,\r\ndoes not contain a bath. A pump at the kitchen sink provides water until\r\nfunds permit of the installation of a modern plumbing system.\r\n\r\nThe first unit of the house may be heated either by a circulator heater\r\nin the living room or by a furnace. The furnace will be especially\r\ndesirable after the second unit is added.\r\n\r\nThe added bedroom wing is recessed from the main building line to permit\r\ncross ventilation through the bedroom in the original house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETE HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[7] Prepared by W. E. Pettit and Fred Riebel for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, Ohio State University.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6515,[8] FOR THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, first unit 565 square feet; with first\r\n  addition 900 square feet; completed house 1,255 square feet. Porches,\r\n  175 square feet.\r\n\r\nThis begins as a three-room house but is planned so that eventually three\r\nbedrooms and a bath may be added. The kitchen in the original house is\r\nnicely arranged, as shown in the plan. When the house is completed, the\r\nfirst bedroom may be used as a dining room, with a door cut through from\r\nthe kitchen. The range should then be placed against the living room\r\nwall. The fireplace and range will heat the first three rooms. Hall space\r\nfor a circulator heater is provided in the first addition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETE HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[8] Prepared by C. W. Heery, Fred J. Orr, and B. G. Danner for the\r\ndepartment of agricultural engineering, University of Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6516,[9] FOR THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, original unit 685 square feet; with\r\n  first addition 1,035 square feet; completed house 1,345 square feet.\r\n  Porches, original 90 square feet; completed house 155 square feet.\r\n\r\nThe original unit of house 6516 is a two-room structure of ample size.\r\nThe dining room and kitchen are combined in one room, while the other\r\nroom is temporarily both bedroom and living room. A porch leading\r\ndirectly into the kitchen affords entrance during the initial stage. In\r\nthe center of the first unit are an unusually large storage closet and a\r\nchimney reminiscent of colonial Virginia. In localities where firewood is\r\nnot readily available the fireplace may be omitted and a stove used for\r\nheating the bedroom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN SHOWING FUTURE ADDITIONS]\r\n\r\nAdditions to the house are indicated on both sides of the original; the\r\nfirst addition undoubtedly would be that with the bedroom and bath. The\r\nrear porch can be enclosed if needed, and will then serve for laundering\r\nand other work that is more convenient not to do in the kitchen. The\r\nsecond addition will complete the house with a living room and front\r\nporch.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the living room and front porch requires considerable\r\nchange in the arrangement of the kitchen to keep traffic from the back\r\ndoor to the living room from passing directly in front of the range. It\r\nwill be best to set the range against the end wall, and preferably to\r\nuse an electric or oil range so that no new chimney will be required.\r\nAfter the living room is added, less dining space will be needed in the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF ORIGINAL UNIT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED UNIT]\r\n\r\n[9] Prepared by H. B. Boynton and J. M. Thompson for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6517,[10] FOR THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, original house 660 square feet; completed\r\n  house 1,025 square feet. Porches, 300 square feet.\r\n\r\nIn plan 6517 a large amount of space is provided at low-cost by using\r\nthe cheapest type of construction and omitting the interior finish at\r\nthe time of building, for when a large family must be housed and funds\r\nare limited space is often more desirable than good finish and ease of\r\nheating. The exterior walls are of vertical boards and battens, and the\r\nroof is of galvanized corrugated metal. The house may be improved at\r\nany time by lining the walls and ceiling. The kitchen arrangement shows\r\na treatment recommended by home economists, the sink and worktable at\r\nright angles to the wall, with shelves above them. This scheme has the\r\nadvantage of separating the working and dining areas, yet it does not\r\nhamper easy communication between the rooms at meal hours. If desired, a\r\nbed may be placed in the living room, yet the house is so arranged that\r\neach sleeping room will have complete privacy. The side wall of the small\r\nbedroom next to the kitchen is intended to be made of 1-inch boards with\r\nbattens on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe addition of bedrooms with closets and a bathroom is suggested.\r\nThis addition will provide space for a circulator heater, which is a\r\nconvenience when no cellar is planned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN AND COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[10] Prepared by the Bureaus of Agricultural Engineering and Home\r\nEconomics, U.S. Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6518[11]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, first stage 835 square feet; with\r\n  addition 1,160 square feet. Porches, 120 square feet.\r\n\r\nSeveral novel features about this small dwelling will appeal to the\r\nfarm-home builder. A heater room on the main floor near the rear entrance\r\nand the kitchen avoids the need for a cellar. A kitchen like this, with\r\nthree outside walls to give light and cross ventilation and a better view\r\nof the farmstead and highway, is often desirable. The end of the living\r\nroom next the kitchen is narrowed to a dining alcove, and when more space\r\nis needed the dining table may be extended into the living room. The\r\ncompleted bungalow has three bedrooms, with ample closet space. The rear\r\nporch will provide a comfortable, shady place to work outside during the\r\nwarm summer days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nIn the first stage of construction the two bedrooms at the rear may\r\nbe omitted. This would still leave one bedroom and the bathroom and\r\ntemporary closet space in the original bungalow. Then the two other\r\nbedrooms can be added later, when funds become available, or a screened\r\nand glazed sleeping porch with outside entrance could be built instead. A\r\nporch off the living room could also be added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[11] Prepared by L. J. Smith for the department of agricultural\r\nengineering, State College of Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6519,[12] FOR THE SOUTHWEST\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, original house 775 square feet; with\r\n  addition 1,075 square feet. Porches, 160 square feet.\r\n\r\nThe plans and perspectives on these pages show two methods of roofing\r\nthis house. In each plan the original unit of the house is complete, and\r\npleasing in appearance, and the additions fit the house gracefully with\r\nvery little tearing out or rearrangement.\r\n\r\nAs in some other plans, the kitchen is designed for the use of an oil,\r\ngas, or electric cookstove. The house may be heated by a circulator\r\nhot-air heater, by a hot-water system with a radiator boiler in the\r\nliving room, or possibly by radiant gas or electric heaters in the\r\nbedrooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\nThe type of design favors keeping the house close to the ground. If\r\nfloor-joist construction is used, the topsoil should be removed from\r\nunder the house so that joists will not come too close to the ground\r\nsurface. A concrete subfloor could be placed directly on the ground,\r\nsupporting wood sleepers and wood floors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[12] Prepared by H. E. Wichers, O. S. Ekdahl, and N. F. Resch for the\r\ndepartment of architecture, Kansas State Agricultural College.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6520[13]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, first unit 450 square feet; with first\r\n  addition 730 square feet; completed house 985 square feet. Porches,\r\n  255 square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nWith their low-pitched roofs, and modest design both inside and out,\r\nplans 6520 and 6521 represent very desirable types of farmhouses.\r\nSuch buildings blend with their surroundings to produce a real homey\r\natmosphere. Originally planned for southern conditions, where a\r\ncirculator heater placed in the hall should be adequate, these plans are\r\nadapted to colder regions if the houses are well constructed and are\r\nprovided with basements and central heating plants as indicated on the\r\nworking drawings.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6521[13]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, first unit 630 square feet; with first\r\n  addition 985 square feet; completed house 1,285 square feet. Porches,\r\n  385 square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nIn both designs the development from two large rooms progresses\r\nlogically, the main difference being that in plan 6520 the additions are\r\nmade at the side, while in plan 6521 the new rooms are added at the rear\r\nof the first unit. Although all the rooms of 6521 a r e shown as larger\r\nthan those of 6520, by slight alterations either size of house may be\r\nbuilt from either plan. The choice should be determined largely by the\r\nslope of the building site.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nIn each original house a temporary partition provides 2 bedrooms in place\r\nof a living room. The first addition adds 2 other bedrooms, and the\r\nremoval of the partition between the temporary bedrooms provides a large\r\nliving room. The second addition increases the total number of bedrooms\r\nto 3 by adding 2 and refitting 1 in the first addition as a bathroom.\r\n\r\nEach kitchen is ideally located to command a view of the driveway,\r\nhighway, and farm buildings. Closets, pantry, and other equipment utilize\r\nthe darker part of the room, leaving the lighter portions for working\r\narea and dining table. These arrangements are complete in the original\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nOn the screened back porch, which is equipped with laundry trays and\r\ncloset, men coming from the fields may hang their outside work garments\r\nand, except in cold weather, wash before entering the house. Here a great\r\ndeal of the dirty and messy work in preparing fruits and vegetables for\r\ncanning may be done. Entrance from the screened porch to the bath or\r\nbedrooms reduces to a minimum the traffic through the kitchen and living\r\nroom. In plan 6520 the screened porch might be divided by a lattice into\r\nwork and living spaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[13] Prepared by Eldred Mowery and C. E. Cope for the Bureaus of\r\nAgricultural Engineering and Home Economics, U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6522[14]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, original house 640 square feet; with\r\n  addition _A_. 950 square feet; with addition _B_ 930 square feet.\r\n  Porch, addition _B_, 120 square feet.\r\n\r\nOn account of its compact arrangement, this low-cost house furnishes a\r\nvery satisfactory amount of usable space for the small family and may be\r\nenlarged to three-bedroom size, as indicated on the plans. The kitchen is\r\nwell-arranged, with moderate storage space, and a wood box filled from\r\noutside, with a ventilated cupboard or cooler above it. The workroom,\r\nunusually large for a small house, is a good place for laundry or canning\r\nand for men to clean up before coming in to meals. Dining space is\r\nprovided at the rear of the living room. This house should be compared\r\nwith no. 6527 (p. 36).\r\n\r\nBoard and batten construction is very suitable for a low-cost house, but\r\nany other type of construction may be used for plan 6522 if preferred.\r\nIf the house is built in a cold climate, probably it will be desirable\r\nto omit the fireplace and heat the living and bedrooms with a circulator\r\nheater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN WITH ADDITION A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN WITH ADDITION D]\r\n\r\n[14] Prepared by the Bureaus of Agricultural Engineering and Home\r\nEconomics, U.S. Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6523,[15] FOR THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, first unit 990 square feet; with addition\r\n  _A_ 1,420 square feet; with addition _B_ 1,375 square feet. Cellar,\r\n  350 square feet. Porches, 100 square feet.\r\n\r\nCommunication between rooms is an important consideration in modern house\r\nplanning. This has been provided in house 6523 by a small hall, which\r\npermits access not only from one room to another but also to the outside,\r\nthe basement stairs, the washroom, the bathroom, and the linen closet,\r\nthus eliminating the necessity of using any room as a passageway.\r\n\r\nAlternate extensions are shown, the choice probably depending upon\r\nthe surrounding ground contour. Addition _B_ should receive first\r\nconsideration, because it brings the two new bedrooms into closer\r\nrelation with the bathroom and does not destroy the washroom adjoining\r\nthe rear entrance. It does, however, reduce the size of one of the first\r\nbedrooms.\r\n\r\nIf addition _A_ is contemplated, the window at _X_ should be located at\r\n_Y_ when the first unit is built. The steps in the hall of addition A may\r\nbe omitted if the ground slopes down at the rear so that the floor of the\r\naddition can be built at a lower level than the floor of the original\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIf addition _B_ is to be used, the window at _Z_ should be located so as\r\nto come in the hall of the addition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN WITH ADDITIONS]\r\n\r\n[15] Prepared by C. W. Heery and B. G. Banner for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, University of Georgia,\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6524[16]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, first unit 1,245 square feet; with\r\n  addition 1,735 square feet. Porches, 25 square feet. Cellar, 400\r\n  square feet.\r\n\r\nThe charm of house 6524 lies in its informality and simplicity. It is\r\nbuilt for comfort and service. The broad expanse of roof, relieved by a\r\ngable, gives it a substantial yet homelike appearance. This is an easy\r\nhouse to move around in, and the kitchen is very nicely arranged. The\r\nscreened porch, in addition to providing a cool and inviting summer\r\ndining and work space, affords ready access to all the rooms of the\r\nhouse. If the future addition of bedrooms is contemplated, the hall\r\nwindow in the first unit should be replaced with a door. This will not\r\nonly provide an extra exit from the house but obviate unnecessary cutting\r\nand tearing out when the addition is built.\r\n\r\nThe cellar provides space for a central heating plant, it desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF KITCHEN]\r\n\r\n[16] Prepared by C. W. Heery, Fred J. Orr and B. G.

Cellar, 795 square feet.\r\n\r\nThis simple farmhouse develops into a home of dignity and charm. The\r\noriginal unit furnishes all modern conveniences and an ample basement.\r\nFuture bedrooms may be added as required, while the extended living room\r\nmight be built as the final touch of growing prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest to the reader to note the similarity of\r\narrangement of this house and no. 6519 (p. 20). These plans were\r\ndeveloped independently, but the coincidence emphasizes the\r\npracticability of having the work and living areas on the side of the\r\nbuilding next to the driveway and the bedrooms toward the rear, with the\r\nbathroom located as centrally as possible. The design of a small house\r\nfor farm use is greatly influenced by the rather fixed location of the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN FLOOR PLAN SHOWING FUTURE ADDITIONS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BASEMENT PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF ORIGINAL UNIT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETE HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[17] Prepared by H. B. Boynton and J. M. Thompson for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERATE-SIZED ONE-STORY HOUSES\r\n\r\nHouses of this group can best be built complete at one time, though in\r\nseveral cases it is noted that rooms may be omitted from the original\r\nbuilding or extra rooms added. The larger houses of this group provide\r\nabout the same features as the completed growing houses. The more compact\r\ntwo-bedroom houses are well adapted to farms where two or more separate\r\ndwellings are needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6526,[18] FOR TIMBERED SECTIONS\r\n\r\n  Floor areas; Superstructure, 845 square feet. Porches, 300 square feet.\r\n\r\nIn spite of present-day improvements in building materials, there is\r\nsomething about the rugged appearance of a log cabin that harmonizes with\r\nrural settings. Log construction blends into wooded surroundings more\r\nintimately than boards, bricks, or stucco.\r\n\r\nHouse 6526 will accommodate 4 persons comfortably, or even 5 or 6 persons\r\nif a couch is placed in a corner of the living room.\r\n\r\nThe location of the bathroom not only serves the bedrooms but is\r\nconvenient to the kitchen and the rear porch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nThe central chimney serves the kitchen range, circulator heater, and\r\nfireplace. The ample size of the kitchen, and its built-in cupboards,\r\ndish cabinets, and other conveniences add greatly to the desirability\r\nof the design. If a pass cupboard between kitchen and living room is\r\ndesired, it may be arranged in the cabinet next to the outer wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[18] Prepared by N. G. Napier for the department of agricultural\r\nengineering, University of Arkansas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6527[19]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, main house, 915 square feet; with storage\r\n  addition 1,120 square feet. Cellar, 115 square feet. Porches, 130\r\n  square feet.\r\n\r\nThis house is similar in many respects to the first unit of 6522 (p. 26),\r\nbut is enlarged to provide for the bathroom. A shallow root cellar with\r\nroom above is added at the rear of the house to provide extra storage if\r\nneeded in localities where a cellar is not practicable. As in the case of\r\nplan 6522, two more bedrooms may be added to the left side of the house\r\nby taking space from the rear bedroom for a hallway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nThe house is planned to be heated by a jacketed heater in the workroom\r\nwith a cold-air return duct under the floor and cold-air registers in the\r\nliving room and bedrooms. This arrangement will keep all handling of coal\r\nand ashes out of the living parts of the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[19] Prepared by O. R. S. Trabor for the department of agricultural\r\nengineering, University of Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6528,[20] FOR THE NORTH\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 800 square feet. Cellar, 800 square feet.\r\n\r\nHouse 6528 is intended for use in cold, snowy regions, where farmers need\r\ncellars for storing fuel and vegetables. The hip roof helps to brace the\r\nhouse against the wind and is economical of material. A well-insulated\r\nceiling is recommended to help keep the house comfortable. The\r\nsubstantial chimney in the center of the house, with separate flues for\r\nfurnace, kitchen range, and fireplace, insures good draft and no wasted\r\nheat. The vestibule at the front and the hall arrangement at the side\r\ndoor also aid in keeping the house warm. Both doors are convenient to the\r\ndriveway and the path to the barn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nThe washroom and laundry of this house are in the cellar. This is a\r\nsatisfactory and economical arrangement where there is good drainage\r\nfor both the cellar and the plumbing fixtures, and is particularly\r\nadvantageous on rolling ground. But one should beware of putting a deep\r\ncellar in a poorly drained location.

Porches, 250 square feet.\r\n\r\nThis house was designed to meet the needs of a family of 4 to 6 people.\r\nThe porch faces the highway, and paths from the front and side porches\r\nlead to the farm drive.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen is complete and compact. The extra space found in many farm\r\nkitchens has been omitted and a workroom added to provide for laundry and\r\nother rough work. This also provides a place for men to leave their outer\r\nwraps and wash before entering the living room. Storage space can be\r\nobtained in the attic by the use of a disappearing stair in the workroom\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nNo wood or coal range is provided for in this plan, because the\r\nuse of an oil, gas, or electric stove saves space in the kitchen\r\nand correspondingly reduces the cost of the house. This saving and\r\nthe convenience of a small, compact cooking unit deserve careful\r\nconsideration in localities where these fuels are cheaply available.\r\nHeating is accomplished by means of a circulator heater in the living\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe designer of this plan states:\r\n\r\n  The bedrooms are small. They are little used during waking hours, thus\r\n  they can be reduced with less injury to family comfort than any other\r\n  room. The large living room more than compensates for this.\r\n\r\n  When funds are limited it is always debatable, in a great portion of\r\n  the United States, whether spending money for a porch is wise, because\r\n  the same money could be used instead to increase the area of the house\r\n  proper. In this particular case the porch could be left off without\r\n  harm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOME AND FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[21] Prepared by H. E. Wichers and O. S. Ekdahl for the department of\r\narchitecture, Kansas State Agricultural College.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6530[22]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 1,155 square feet. Porches, 245 square\r\n  feet.\r\n\r\nThe well-known economy of square house construction is illustrated by\r\nthis plan. A choice of heating methods without a cellar is indicated. If\r\na circulator heater is used in the hall, as shown, the chimney between\r\nthe bedrooms will not be needed, and if extra bedrooms are wanted they\r\nmay be added as in plan 6517 (p. 18). A fireplace in the back bedroom\r\nwould, of course, interfere with taking a hall off this room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nKitchen doors are located to permit easy communication between the\r\nscreened porch and the hall without interference with the work area\r\nwhile the screened porch is useful as both work and dining area. This\r\nlatter feature, together with the ample size of the bedrooms, living room\r\nkitchen, makes the dwelling especially suitable for the small family in\r\nthe South. The addition of a cellar under one-half of the house and of\r\na central heating plant would adapt this plan to other sections of the\r\ncountry, though the rooms are rather larger than is common in the North.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOME]\r\n\r\n[22] Prepared by W. C. Breithaupt and H. W. Dearing for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, Alabama Polytechnic Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6531[23]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 1,185 square feet. Porches, 155 square\r\n  feet.\r\n\r\nHouse 6531 should be compared with no. 6533. The two plans were developed\r\nindependently, but are very similar and illustrate a logical grouping of\r\nrooms for a farmhouse. In some respects the arrangement of 6531 works\r\nout more satisfactorily because it is not restricted by the structural\r\ndetails of framing a pitched roof.\r\n\r\nThis house is a model of compactness and efficiency. Note the simple but\r\neffective way in which the kitchen and heater room are located back to\r\nback. The floor of the heater room is a concrete slab, two steps below\r\nthe main floor level. A pass cupboard between the kitchen and dining room\r\nis handy for serving meals. It also provides storage space beneath its\r\ncounter. The entire bedroom side may be omitted from the original house,\r\nin which case the workroom would serve for dining and the dining room for\r\na bedroom.\r\n\r\nAll dimensions of this house are multiples of 3-1/2 feet. Wall, door, and\r\nwindow sections might be prefabricated so that erection would consist\r\nmerely of bolting the sections together, or the house can be built in the\r\nordinary way. The sketch at the top of page 41 illustrates the use of\r\nsheet metal as an exterior covering, the one in the center shows concrete\r\nblocks, and the bottom view shows the walls covered with a combination of\r\nlap siding and shingles or wide boards.\r\n\r\nThe flat roof should be covered with good roofing and well-insulated for\r\ncomfort in both summer and winter as described in the working drawings.\r\nThe cost of the insulated flat roof should not be greater than that of an\r\nordinary pitched roof without insulation. The accumulation of snow will\r\nhelp to keep the building warm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOME]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOME]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOME]\r\n\r\n[23] Prepared by Albert Frey for the Bureaus of Agricultural Engineering\r\nand Home Economies, U.S. Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6532[24]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 1,125 square feet Porches, 35 square feet.\r\n\r\nThis is a new type of low-cost house designed to provide five small\r\nsingle bedrooms or sleeping compartments and one bedroom of average size.\r\nThe sleeping compartments are not very large, but to secure privacy and\r\nyet maintain economy of construction, something must be sacrificed. In\r\nthis case it is unnecessary space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOME AND FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nThe sketch showing the arrangement of bunks illustrates an interesting\r\nfeature of this house. In the right-hand room the bunk is near the floor,\r\nand wardrobe and dresser space is obtained in the partition between the\r\ntwo rooms. In the left-hand room the bunk is 4 feet above the floor and\r\nprojects over the one on the other side of the partition. Wardrobe space\r\nis arranged under the bunk. This room is especially suitable for a boy.\r\nA folding study table is provided under the window in each room. On warm\r\nnights air circulation would be obtained by opening the bedroom doors to\r\nthe hall, which is ventilated by the windows above the lower roof. By\r\nomitting all but one of the partitions forming the five small bedrooms\r\ntwo good-sized rooms can be obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS SECTION OF BEDROOMS AND WARDROBE AT B-B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE VIEW OF BUNK AT A-A]\r\n\r\nThe exterior appearance may seem, at first glance, unusually severe,\r\nbut by omitting a pitched roof and the ornamental features of cornice\r\nmoldings and trim decorations, the cost of construction is materially\r\nlowered. Here everything has been reduced to the simplest form possible.\r\n\r\nWith the heater room adjoining the kitchen, there is little need for a\r\nbasement, thus an important item of expense is eliminated. The kitchen\r\nand workroom form a compact and very convenient unit along the driveway\r\nside of the house, while the large living room commands a good view of\r\nthe highway. The living room and halls are lighted and ventilated by the\r\nsmall windows above the lower roofs. Closet space is provided in every\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAs in plan 6531 (p. 40), all dimensions are multiples of 3-1/2 feet so\r\nthat the house can be either prefabricated or built in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n[24] Prepared by Albert Frey and R. G. Allen for the Bureaus of\r\nAgricultural Engineering and Home Economics, U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6533[25]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 1,130 square feet. Porch, 80 square feet.\r\n  Cellar, 280 square feet.\r\n\r\nHouse 6533 is one of the few designs in which a separate dining space was\r\nallotted. Many people do not consider a separate dining room essential in\r\nthe small farmhouse, and additional space adds to the cost, but in this\r\ncase the arrangement adds to the spaciousness of the interior without\r\ngreatly increasing the cost.\r\n\r\nThe rear entry is large enough to serve as laundry and washroom, and\r\nconstitutes a back way from the kitchen to the bedrooms and bathroom\r\nwithout passing through the living room.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen, with cross ventilation and ample cupboard and counter space,\r\nis a pleasant workshop for the housewife, and is so arranged that easy\r\nservice to the dining alcove is possible.\r\n\r\nThe bedrooms and adjoining bath are grouped together, allowing that\r\nportion of the house to be closed off from the living portion.\r\n\r\nIn the cellar is the heating plant, with fuel bin.\r\n\r\nThe house is kept low to give it an appearance of hugging the ground, but\r\nin no case should the joists be below the ground level. Shingles, beveled\r\nsiding, or clapboards may be used for the exterior surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[25] Prepared by Max Uhlig for the department of agricultural\r\nengineering, Massachusetts Agricultural College.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSES OF MORE THAN ONE STORY\r\n\r\nIn many respects houses of more than one story are better suited for\r\nfarm use in the Northern States than single-story buildings. They are\r\nmore economical in foundation and roof construction, and are easier to\r\nheat. They should be arranged with one bedroom and a bath, or at least\r\na toilet, on the ground floor. A cellar for fuel and vegetable storage\r\nand a central heating plant are usually needed with this type of house.\r\nThe laundry may also be located in the cellar if suitable drainage and\r\na grade door to the outside can be obtained, but in a poorly drained\r\nlocation it is best to keep the laundry above-ground. In building a\r\ncellar advantage should be taken of the slope of the ground to obtain\r\ngood lighting and an easy entrance on the low side of the slope.\r\n\r\nTo avoid uncomfortably warm second-floor bedrooms in summer cross\r\nventilation should be provided in each room. Insulation of the ceiling is\r\nvaluable both in summer and in winter.\r\n\r\nIt is very convenient to have a bathroom on the second-floor as well as\r\none on the first-floor, especially if rooms are to be rented to tourists\r\nwhen the family does not need the whole house.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6534[26]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, original house, 1,420 square feet; with\r\n  living room addition, 1,720 square feet. Cellar, 775 square feet.\r\n  Porches, 285 square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nThe first-floor and cellar plans of house 6534 are almost the same as the\r\noriginal unit of no. 6525 (p. 32), but there are comfortable bedrooms,\r\na bath, and closet space on the second-floor. If funds are available to\r\nbuild the living room wing indicated, the entire dwelling will breathe\r\nthe traditional southern spirit of hospitable spaciousness.\r\n\r\nThe hall and stair arrangements of this house are very good. Persons\r\ncoming in at the back door can leave wraps in the vestibule at the head\r\nof the cellar stairs and go directly to any downstairs room or to the\r\ncellar, yet there is little lost space.\r\n\r\nIf the house should at some time be occupied by a small family, the\r\nentire upstairs could be shut off. Persons wishing rooms for tourists\r\nwill find either the upstairs bedrooms or the downstairs bedroom and bath\r\nvery suitable for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF ORIGINAL UNIT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[26] Prepared by H. B. Boynton and J. M. Thompson for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6535[27]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 820 square feet. Porch, 30 square feet.\r\n\r\nThis might well be considered the smallest story-and-a-half farmhouse\r\nthat could be practicably built. The designer has utilized the space to\r\ngood advantage, omitting a bath in the original structure for the sake of\r\neconomy. The working drawings show a future addition to the house which\r\nprovides a bedroom and bath on the first-floor. The alternate floor plan\r\nshows a dormer in the rear like the one on the front, to make room for a\r\nsecond-floor bath.\r\n\r\nA distinctive feature of this compact design is the =L=-shaped\r\nkitchen with its well-grouped and well-lighted working surfaces and\r\ndining table. The arrangement of an =L=-shaped room is often a\r\nproblem when enlarging or remodeling. The living room is arranged for\r\nboth day and night use, with a folding bed in a closet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALTERNATE FIRST FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALTERNATE SECOND FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[27] Prepared by C. T Bridgman for the department of agricultural\r\nengineering, Iowa State College.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6536,[28] FOR THE NORTH\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 1560 square feet. Cellar, 400 square\r\n  feet. Porch, 210 square feet.\r\n\r\nThis design illustrates a type of farmhouse frequently built in recent\r\nyears because of its simple lines and economy of construction. It\r\nillustrates the pleasing possibility of fitting the farmhouse to sloping\r\nground, with ample light in the basement and easy flights of steps\r\nbetween the house proper, the large workroom at the rear, and the cellar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nThe partition between the main rooms downstairs is carried up to divide\r\nthe second-floor, giving these bedrooms ample size and good cross\r\nventilation and making a strong construction that will not sag in years\r\nto come. A second bathroom may be provided in the storage space by the\r\nchimney, thus adding to the comfort of the home and making the upstairs\r\nrooms suitable for rental to tourists if desired. The roof should be\r\ninsulated to give comfort both in summer and in winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR VIEW OF KITCHEN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nThe downstairs hall, lighted by the windows on the stairs, is compact\r\nand provides easy communication between all rooms. The living room is\r\nwell-lighted and has good wall spaces for furniture. The combined kitchen\r\nand dining room, with the sink at right angles to the outside wall, as\r\nshown in the interior view, gives the housewife three walls of continuous\r\nwork surfaces and in addition light and the view from all the windows of\r\nthe room. Children can play or older members visit in the dining end with\r\nslight interference to the housewife's work. This is especially helpful\r\non chilly days in the fall and spring when the kitchen stove provides the\r\nonly heat in the house.\r\n\r\nThe part basement furnishes space for a furnace and for storage of fruits\r\nand vegetables.\r\n\r\n[28] Prepared by C. J. Poiesz and Eldred Mowery for the Bureaus of\r\nAgricultural Engineering and Home Economics, U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6537[29]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure (including enclosed porch) 1,520 square\r\n  feet. Cellar, 840 square feet. Terrace and steps, 100 square feet.\r\n\r\nHouse 6537 is similar in many respects to no. 6536, and has much the same\r\nadvantages, though the rooms are somewhat smaller. A second downstairs\r\nbedroom can be added beside the bathroom, if needed, or the two bedrooms\r\non the second-floor can be left unfinished if funds are not on hand to\r\ncomplete the building in the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe sketch indicates the roof line sweeping down snug over the window\r\nof the first-floor bedroom, a feature which is carried out with similar\r\nsuccess in plan 6538. Designs of this type help to keep a two-story\r\nhome from appearing too tall and make it a more harmonious unit in the\r\nfarmstead scheme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[29] Prepared by T. A. Zink for the department of agricultural\r\nengineering, Purdue University.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6538[30]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 1,740 square feet. Cellar, 385 square\r\n  feet. Stoops, 80 square feet.\r\n\r\nHouse 6538 may be roofed in a number of ways, with slight alterations\r\nin the arrangement of the second-floor. The appearance is, of course,\r\ngreatly altered; but in each case is pleasing. With the modernistic\r\nflat roof, any waste spaces caused by the sloping roofs in the other\r\ndesigns are eliminated. The storage room on the second-floor then becomes\r\nsuitable for a child's bedroom, a sewing room, or an office, and the\r\nflat-deck porch roof will serve as a sleeping porch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\nThe plan is simple and well proportioned. Since the arrangement of the\r\nentrance is a little unusual, the location of the driveway and the path\r\nto the barn should be given careful study before deciding upon the site\r\nand placing of the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSES]\r\n\r\nConstruction should be simple. In the case of the modernistic house,\r\nconcrete or stucco is suggested for the first story and boards and\r\nbattens for the second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[30] Prepared by W. K. Bartges and Earl Barnett for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering. University of California..\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6539,[31] FOR THE NORTH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF FIRST STAGE]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, original house, 1,100 square feet; with\r\n  kitchen addition, 1,270 square feet; with all additions shown, 1,620\r\n  square feet. Porches, original house, 90 square feet; completed house,\r\n  285 square feet. Cellar, 565 square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nThousands of farmhouses in all parts of the North and Middle West have\r\nbegun like house 6539, and the development illustrated for this one\r\nshould offer helpful suggestions both to farmers who plan to build new\r\nand those who expect to remodel present houses. It is a very practical\r\ndesign, expressing honest dignity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nThe plans on this page show the original unit, which would supply a\r\ncomfortable yet economical dwelling, with a basement for fuel and\r\nstorage. The first addition might be either the new 7 kitchen and porch\r\nor the downstairs bedroom, bath, and laundry. If needed, a third upstairs\r\nbedroom and a bathroom can be added over those in the first-floor\r\naddition, as shown in the working drawings, with little loss of material\r\nor work, because the downstairs bedroom has a flat-deck roof. This would\r\nincrease the floor area of the superstructure to 1,900 square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST FLOOR PLAN WITH ADDITIONS]\r\n\r\n[31] Prepared by J. M. Deibert for the Bureaus of Agricultural\r\nEngineering and Home Economics, U.S. Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6540[32]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 1,380 square feet. Porch, 70 square feet.\r\n  Cellar, 760 square feet.\r\n\r\nThis plan is intended for use in the North, where the compact floor plan\r\nwith cellar and inside chimney and the front vestibule will simplify\r\nthe heating problem. The first-floor level is above the ordinary\r\nheight of packed snow in winter, but the grade entrance gives easy\r\ncommunication with both the cellar and the main part of the house. This\r\npermits convenient use of the cellar as a washroom and laundry, if in a\r\nwell-drained location, as well as for storage purposes.\r\n\r\nThe house is roomy and well-arranged, with a downstairs bedroom and\r\nbathroom. By a slight change to make the second-floor like the first, a\r\nbathroom or toilet could be arranged in the large closet by the stairs.\r\nStorage space is provided in the attic.\r\n\r\nAll second-floor partitions are directly above those of the first floor,\r\nthus making a strong, rigid house with the least framing material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[32] Prepared by H. W. Orth and R. A. Gmeinder for the division of\r\nagricultural engineering, University of Minnesota.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERY SMALL HOUSES\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the houses in the very-small-house group are kept to\r\nthe minimum by using the living rooms for sleeping rooms at night. These\r\nhouses cannot be considered adequate for the typical farm family, but\r\nwill serve for young married couples or for tenants with small families.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6501[33]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 325 square feet. Stoop, 15 square feet.\r\n\r\nIn plan 6501, sleeping space is provided in double-deck beds screened\r\nfrom the living room by draw curtains. If more space is wanted later, a\r\nbedroom wing can be added at the end of the living room. To save space,\r\nthe kitchen is planned for an oil, gas, or electric stove. With a house\r\nof this size, part of the housework would have to be done outdoors,\r\nand a paved or graveled space under a tree near the house would be a\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[33] Prepared by H. E. Wichers, N. F. Resell, and O. S. Ekdahl, for\r\nKansas State College.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6502[34]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 600 square feet. Stoop, 35 square feet.\r\n\r\nThe special feature of plan 6502 is the well-arranged kitchen, with good\r\nstorage space and a compact work area at one side of the direct line\r\nof travel from the back door. Some privacy at night is afforded by the\r\ndouble wardrobes and folding screen between the two beds in the living\r\nroom. The side porch will serve the double purpose of workroom and\r\nsleeping porch. It should be screened and have curtains to keep out the\r\nrain. By adding 4 feet to the living room and an additional partition, a\r\nthird room could be provided. A shower bath may be installed in the large\r\ncloset as shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[34] Prepared by A. L. Matthews and N. G. Napier for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, University of Arkansas,\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6503[35]\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, original house 520 square feet; with\r\n  addition, 825 square feet.\r\n\r\nSmall homes are often cut up into several rooms, with the result that in\r\nthem a person has a \"boxed-in\" feeling. In plan 6503 the rooms are few,\r\nand each is used for more than one purpose. If the cost must be kept to\r\na minimum, the bedroom and sleeping porch may be omitted in the original\r\nconstruction. The kitchen-dining room is unusually large for a house of\r\nthis size, and the equipment is grouped in the front part of the room\r\nwhere the housewife can have a good view of the highway.\r\n\r\nWhen the bedroom and sleeping porch are built, the bunk in the\r\nkitchen-dining room may be taken out to provide more dining space; or\r\nif one desires a cellar under part of the house, the cellar stairway\r\nmay replace the bunk space. A large window and high-beamed ceiling are\r\nfeatures of the living room. The chimney must not be too small; it is a\r\nfeature of the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[35] Prepared by R. A. Deal and W. W. DeNeff for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, State College of Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6504,[36] FOR THE SOUTHWEST\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 430 square feet. Porches, 145 square feet.\r\n\r\nPlans 6504 and 6505 were designed for the central valleys of California,\r\nwhere outdoor sleeping is invited, by the mild nights.\r\n\r\nThese were designed for temporary homes to be used later as shops, bunk\r\nhouses, storage buildings, or for other uses, so concrete floors are\r\nrecommended. Low-cost \"frameless\" construction is shown in the working\r\ndrawings. There are no ceilings. The shower baths shown in the plans can\r\nbe installed cheaply.\r\n\r\nThe kitchens and work porches are large enough for the needs of a\r\ngood-sized family. Plenty of windows are provided for ventilation. The\r\nkitchen arrangement shows a wood-burning stove, and a large refrigerator\r\nplaced against an inside wall for protection from the outdoor heat. It is\r\nexpected that meals will ordinarily be eaten in the kitchen or outdoors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6505,[36] FOR THE SOUTHWEST\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 410 square feet. Porches, 125 square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[36] Prepared by W. K. Bartges and Earl Barnett for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, University of California.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6506,[37] FOR NEW ENGLAND\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 540 square feet. Porches, 60 square feet.\r\n\r\nThough the rooms in plan 6506 have been kept as small as possible in\r\norder to reduce cost, good use of space is realized in the arrangement.\r\nAdditions to the house would enable it to accommodate an average-sized\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nA work-porch addition beside the kitchen and living room, between the\r\nwindows, would provide a place for laundry work and for hanging outer\r\nwraps. A bathroom might be built by enclosing a portion of the front\r\nporch and enlarging the window to make a doorway from the hall. If\r\ndesired, a third bedroom could be added at the end of the living room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[37] Prepared by Bernhard Dirks for the department of agricultural\r\nengineering, Massachusetts State College.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6507,[38] FOR THE NORTH\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, original house, 380 square feet; with\r\n  first addition 600 square feet. Porches and entrances, 50 square feet.\r\n  Cellar, first unit 380 square feet; with addition 600 square feet.\r\n\r\nPlan 6507 is intended for snowy sections, and the first-floor is\r\npurposely raised above the winter snow level. The house can be built in\r\neither one or two stages.\r\n\r\nNo partition divides the kitchen and living room, which permits\r\nheating the house with the kitchen range in mild weather. It also aids\r\nventilation in summer and facilitates serving of meals in the living room.\r\n\r\nThe steps to the cellar are outside the house, protected by a storm door.\r\nThere is ample space in the cellar for laundry and storage. A cistern\r\nunder the kitchen provides soft water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN AND COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[38] Prepared by S. A. Witzel for the department of agricultural\r\nengineering, University of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6508,[39] FOR THE NORTHWEST\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, first stage 385 square feet; second stage\r\n  605 square feet; third stage 755 square feet. Porches and steps, first\r\n  stage 20 square feet; second and third stages 70 square feet.\r\n\r\nThis house is designed for the minimum requirements of beginners on the\r\nland, the first portion being 16 by 24 feet outside. It may either be\r\nenlarged for a permanent dwelling or later used as a service building.\r\nThe bedroom is ample in size, but the living room, because it must also\r\nbe used temporarily as a kitchen and dining room, will be crowded. This\r\nunit may be made 18 feet instead of 16 feet wide. Later the kitchen and\r\na small bedroom may be added at the rear of the first unit, with a side\r\nporch off the kitchen. The door between the kitchen and living room will\r\nthen be changed to the right of the chimney, and a narrow hall taken off\r\nthe rear of the front bedroom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nIf an additional bedroom is desired, it can be added to the left of\r\nthe bathroom, making the third stage for this house. The closet in the\r\nkitchen should be removed and a door cut through to allow easy access\r\nfrom the kitchen to the bath and bedrooms. The bedroom closets must be\r\nrearranged to allow for these changes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\n[39] Prepared by R. A. Deal and W. W. DeNeff for the department of\r\nagricultural engineering, State College of Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN 6509,[40] FOR THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n  Floor areas: Superstructure, 525 square feet. Porches and steps, 90\r\n  square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOOR PLAN]\r\n\r\nPlans 6509 and 6510, for the South and the Middle West, respectively, are\r\nlow-cost houses for families that need only one bedroom. The kitchens are\r\nwell-arranged and have good storage space. Closet space also is ample for\r\nhouses of this size.\r\n\r\nA storage and workroom, as shown in plan 6510, is a good feature for\r\nthe North but is not so much needed in the South, where mild weather\r\npermits doing much housework outdoors. The living room fireplace and\r\nkitchen range should heat house 6509 comfortably under ordinary southern\r\nconditions, but in the North arrangements should be made for a stove or\r\ncirculator heater as in plan 6510.\r\n\r\n[40] Prepared by W.
