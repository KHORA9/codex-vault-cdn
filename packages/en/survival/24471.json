Upwards of three hundred volumes\r\nhave been written, embracing works in nearly all of the languages of\r\nEurope, concerning the herb and the various methods of using it. Most\r\nwriters have confined themselves to the commercial history of the\r\nplant; while others have written upon its medicinal properties and the\r\nvarious modes of preparing it for use. For this volume the Author only\r\nclaims that it is at least a more comprehensive treatise on the\r\nvarieties and cultivation of the plant than any work now extant. A\r\nfull account of its cultivation is given, not only in America, but\r\nalso in nearly all of the great tobacco-producing countries of the\r\nworld. The history of the plant has been carefully and faithfully\r\ncompiled from the earliest authorities, that portion which relates to\r\nits early culture in Virginia being drawn from hitherto unpublished\r\nsources. Materials for such a work have not been found lacking.\r\nEuropean authors abound with allusions to tobacco; more especially is\r\nit true of English writers, who have celebrated its virtues in poetry\r\nand song. All along the highways and by-paths of our literature we\r\nencounter much that pertains to this \"queen of plants.\" Considered in\r\nwhat light it may, tobacco must be regarded as the most astonishing of\r\nthe productions of nature, since it has, in the short period of nearly\r\nfour centuries, dominated not one particular nation, but the whole\r\nworld, both Christian and Pagan. Ushered into the Old World from the\r\nNew by the great colonizers--Spain, England, and France--it attracted\r\nat once the attention of the authors of the period as a fit subject\r\nfor their marvel-loving pens. It has been the aim of the writer to\r\ngive as much as possible of the existing material to be had concerning\r\nthe early persecution waged against it, whether by Church or State.\r\nThese accounts, while they invest with additional interest its early\r\nuse and introduction, serve as well to show its triumph over all its\r\nfoes and its vast importance to the commerce of the world. This work\r\nhas been prepared and arranged, not only for the instruction and\r\nentertainment of the users of tobacco, but for the benefit of the\r\ncultivators and manufacturers as well. As such it is now presented to\r\nthe public for whatever meed of praise or censure it is found to\r\ndeserve.\r\n\r\nHartford, Conn., 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n                                                                  Page\r\n\r\n     1.

a\r\nmoist fertile soil and requiring the most thorough culture in order to\r\nsecure the finest form and quality of leaf. It is a native of the\r\ntropics and under the intense rays of a vertical sun develops its\r\nfinest and most remarkable flavor which far surpasses the varieties\r\ngrown in a temperate region. It however readily adapts itself to soil\r\nand climate growing through a wide range of temperature from the\r\nEquator to Moscow in Russia in latitude 56°, and through all the\r\nintervening range of climate[2].\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 1: The greater number of the species are\r\n              annual plants; but two at least are perennial; the\r\n              _Nicotiana fruticosa_, which is a shrub, a native of the\r\n              Cape of Good Hope, and of China; and _N. urens_, a\r\n              native of South America.]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 2: Tatham says that the tobacco plant is\r\n              peculiarly adapted for an agricultural comparison of\r\n              climates.]\r\n\r\nThe plant varies in height according to species and locality; the\r\nlargest varieties reaching an altitude of ten or twelve feet, in\r\nothers not growing more than two or three feet from the ground.\r\nBotanists have enumerated between forty and fifty varieties of the\r\ntobacco plant who class them all among the narcotic poisons. When\r\nproperly cultivated the plant ripens in a few weeks growing with a\r\nrapidity hardly equaled by any product either temperate or tropical.\r\nOf the large number of varieties cultivated scarcely more than\r\none-half are grown to any great extent while many of them are hardly\r\nknown outside of the limit of cultivation. Tobacco is a strong growing\r\nplant resisting heat and drought to a far greater extent than most\r\nplants. It is a native of America, the discovery of the continent and\r\nthe plant occurring almost simultaneously. It succeeds best in a deep\r\nrich loam in a climate ranging from forty to fifty degrees of\r\nlatitude. After having been introduced and cultivated in nearly all\r\nparts of the world, America enjoys the reputation of growing the\r\nfinest varieties known to commerce. European tobacco is lacking in\r\nflavor and is less powerful than the tobacco of America.\r\n\r\nThe botanical account of tobacco is as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Nicotiana, the tobacco plant is a genus of plants of the\r\n     order of Monogynia, belonging to the pentandria class, order\r\n     1, of class V. It bears a tubular 5-cleft calyx; a\r\n     funnel-formed corolla, with a plaited 5-cleft border; the\r\n     stamina inclined; the stigma capitate; the capsule 2-celled,\r\n     and 2 to 4 valved.\"\r\n\r\nA more general description of the plant is given by an American\r\nwriter:--\r\n\r\n     \"The tobacco plant is an annual growing from eighteen inches\r\n     (dwarf tobacco) to seven or eight feet in height[3]. It\r\n     bears numerous leaves of a pale green color sessile, ovate\r\n     lanceolate and pointed in form, which come out alternately\r\n     from two to three inches apart. The flowers grow in loose\r\n     panicles at the extremity of the stalks, and the calyx is\r\n     bell-shaped, and divided at its summit into five pointed\r\n     segments. The tube of the corolla expands at the top into an\r\n     oblong cup terminating in a 5-lobed plaited rose-colored\r\n     border. The pistil consists of an oval germ, a slender style\r\n     longer than the stamen, and a cleft stigma. The flowers are\r\n     succeeded by capsules of 2 cells opening at the summit and\r\n     containing numerous kidney-shaped seeds.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 3: An old English writer in describing tobacco\r\n              says:--\"When at its just height, it is as tall as an\r\n              ordinary sized man.\"]\r\n\r\nTwo of the finest varieties of Nicotiana Tobacum that are cultivated\r\nare the Oronoco and the Sweet Scented; they differ only in the form of\r\nthe leaves, those of the latter variety being shorter and broader than\r\nthe other. They are annual herbaceous plants, rising with strong erect\r\nstems to the height of from six to nine feet, with fine handsome\r\nfoliage. The stalk near the root is often an inch or more in diameter,\r\nand surrounded by a hairy clammy substance, of a greenish yellow\r\ncolor. The leaves are of a light green; they grow alternately, at\r\nintervals of two or three inches on the stalk; they are oblong and\r\nspear-shaped; those lowest on the stalk are about twenty inches in\r\nlength, and they decrease as they ascend.\r\n\r\nThe young leaves when about six inches, are of a deep green color and\r\nrather smooth, and as they approach maturity they become yellowish and\r\nrougher on the surface. The flowers grow in clusters from the\r\nextremities of the stalk; they are yellow externally and of a delicate\r\nred within. They are succeeded by kidney shaped capsules of a brown\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThompson in his \"Notices relative to Tobacco\" describes the tobacco\r\nplant as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"The species of Nicotiana which was first known, and which\r\n     still furnishes the greatest supply of Tobacco, is the N.\r\n     tobacum, an annual plant, a native of South America, but\r\n     naturalized to our climate. It is a tall, not inelegant\r\n     plant, rising to the height of about six feet, with a\r\n     strong, round, villous, slightly viscid stem, furnished with\r\n     alternate leaves, which are sessile, or clasp the stems; and\r\n     are decurrent, lanceolate, entire; of a full green on the\r\n     upper surface, and pale on the under.\r\n\r\n     \"In a vigorous plant, the lower leaves are about twenty\r\n     inches in length, and from three to five in breadth,\r\n     decreasing as they ascend. The inflorescence, or flowering\r\n     part of the stem, is terminal, loosely branching in that\r\n     form which botanists term a panicle, with long, linear\r\n     floral leaves or bractes at the origin of each division.\r\n\r\n     \"The flowers, which bloom in July and August, are of a pale\r\n     pink or rose color: the calyx, or flower-cup, is\r\n     bell-shaped, obscurely pentangular, villous, slightly\r\n     viscid, and presenting at the margin five acute, erect\r\n     segments. The corolla is twice the length of the calyx,\r\n     viscid, tubular below, swelling above into an oblong cup,\r\n     and expanding at the lip into five somewhat plaited, pointed\r\n     segments; the seed vessel is an oblong or ovate capsule,\r\n     containing numerous reniform seeds, which are ripe in\r\n     September and October; and if not collected, are shed by the\r\n     capsule opening at the apex.\"\r\n\r\nIn Stevens and Liebault's Maison Rustique, or the Country Farm,\r\n(London, 1606), is found the following curious account of the tobacco\r\nplant:--\r\n\r\n     \"This herbe resembleth in figure fashion, and qualities, the\r\n     great comfrey in such sort as that a man woulde deeme it to\r\n     be a kinde of great comfrey, rather than a yellow henbane,\r\n     as some have thought.\r\n\r\n     \"It hath an upright stalke, not bending any way, thicke,\r\n     bearded or hairy, and slimy: the leaves are broad and long,\r\n     greene, drawing somewhat towards a yellow, bearded or\r\n     hoarrie, but smooth and slimie, having as it were talons,\r\n     but not either notched or cut in the edges, a great deale\r\n     bigger downward toward the root than above: while it is\r\n     young it is leaved, as it were lying upon the ground, but\r\n     rising to a stalke and growing further, it ceaseth to have\r\n     such a number of leaves below, and putteth forth branches\r\n     from half foot to half, and storeth itselfe, by that meanes\r\n     with leaves, and still riseth higher from the height of four\r\n     or five foote, unto three or four or five cubits according\r\n     as is sown in a hot and fat ground, and carefully tilled.\r\n     The boughs and branches thereof put out at joints, and\r\n     divide the stalk by distance of halfe a foote: the highest\r\n     of which branches are bigger than an arme.\r\n\r\n     \"At the tops and ends of his branches and boughs, it putteth\r\n     foorth flowers almost like those of Nigella, of a whitish\r\n     and incarnate color, having the fashion of a little bell\r\n     comming out of a swad or husk, being of the fashion of a\r\n     small goblet, which husk becometh round, having the fashion\r\n     of a little apple, or sword's pummell: as soon as the flower\r\n     is gone and vanished away, it is filled with very small\r\n     seedes like unto those of yellow henbane, and they are black\r\n     when they be ripe, or greene, while they are not yet ripe.\r\n\r\n     \"In a hot countree it beareth leaves, flowers, and seeds at\r\n     the same time, in the ninth or tenth month of the year it\r\n     putteth foorth young cions at the roote, and reneweth itself\r\n     by this store and number of cions, and great quantity of\r\n     sprouts, and yet notwithstanding the roots are little,\r\n     small, fine thready strings, or if otherwise they grow a\r\n     little thick, yet remaine they still very short, in respect\r\n     of the height of the plant. The roots and leaves do yield a\r\n     glewish and rosinith kind of juice, somewhat yellow, of a\r\n     rosinlike smell, not unpleasant, and of a sharpe, eager and\r\n     biting taste, which sheweth that it is by nature hot,\r\n     whereupon we must gather that it is no kind of yellow\r\n     henbane as some have thought. Nicotiana craveth a fat ground\r\n     well stird, and well manured also in this cold countrie\r\n     (England) that is to say an earth, wherein the manure is so\r\n     well mingled and incorporated, as that it becometh earthie,\r\n     that is to say, all turned into earth, and not making any\r\n     shew any more of dung: which is likewise moist and shadowie,\r\n     wide and roomy, for in a narrow and straight place it would\r\n     not grow high, straight, great and well-branched.\r\n\r\n     \"It desireth the South sun before it, and a wall behind it,\r\n     which may stand in stead of a broad pair of shoulders to\r\n     keep away the northern wind and to beate backe againe the\r\n     heat of the sun. It groweth the better if it be oft watered,\r\n     and maketh itself sport and jolly good cheer with water when\r\n     the time becometh a little dry. It hateth cold, and\r\n     therefore to keepe it from dying in winter, it must be\r\n     either kept in cellars where it may have free benefit of\r\n     air, or else in some cave made on purpose within the same\r\n     garden, or else to cover it as with a cloak very well with a\r\n     double mat, making a penthouse of wicker work from the wall\r\n     to cover the head thereof with straw laid thereupon: and\r\n     when the southern sun shineth, to open the door of the\r\n     covert made for the said herb right upon the said South\r\n     sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe most ludicrous part of \"The discourse on Nicotian\" will be found\r\nin that portion which relates to the making of the plant-bed and\r\ntransplanting:--\r\n\r\n     \"For to sow it, you must make a hole in the earth with your\r\n     finger and that as deep as your finger is long, then you\r\n     must cast into the same hole ten or twelve seeds of the said\r\n     Nicotiana together, and fill up the hole again: for it is so\r\n     small, as that if you should put in but four or five seeds\r\n     the earth would choake it: and if the time be dry, you must\r\n     water the place easily some five days after: And when the\r\n     herb is grown out of the earth, inasmuch as every seed will\r\n     have put up his sprout and stalk, and that the small thready\r\n     roots are intangled the one within the other, you must with\r\n     a great knife make a composs within the earth in the places\r\n     about this plot where they grow and take up the earth and\r\n     all together, and cast them into a bucket full of water, to\r\n     the end that the earth may be seperated, and the small and\r\n     tender impes swim about the water; and so you shall sunder\r\n     them one after another without breaking of them.\" * *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STALK.\r\n\r\nThe Tobacco stalk varies with the varieties of the plant. All of the\r\nspecies cultivated in the United States have stalks of a large\r\nsize--much larger than many varieties grown in the tropics. Those of\r\nsome species of tobacco are little and easily broken, which to a\r\ncertain extent is the case with most varieties of the plant when\r\nmaturing very fast. The stalks of some plants are rough and uneven,\r\nwhile those of others are smooth. Nearly all, including most of those\r\ngrown in Europe and America, have erect, round, hairy, viscid stalks,\r\nand large, fibrous roots; while that of Spanish as well as dwarf\r\ntobacco is harder and much smaller. The stalk is composed of a\r\nwood-like substance containing a glutinous pith, and is of about the\r\nsame shade of color as the leaves. As the plant develops in size the\r\nstalk hardens, and when fully grown is not easily broken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco stalks.]\r\n\r\nThe size of the stalk corresponds with that of the leaves, and with\r\nsuch varieties of the plant as Connecticut seed leaf, Virginia,\r\nKentucky, Ohio, St. Domingo, and some others; both will be found to be\r\nlarger than Spanish, Latakia, and Syrian tobacco, which have a much\r\nsmaller but harder stalk. It will readily be seen that the stalk must\r\nbe strong and firm in order to support the large palm-like leaves\r\nwhich on some varieties grow to a length of nearly four feet with a\r\ncorresponding breadth. The stalk does not \"cure down\" as fast as the\r\nleaves, which is thought now to be necessary in order to prevent\r\nsweating, as well as to hasten the curing. Most of the varieties of\r\nthe plant have an erect, straight stalk, excepting Syrian tobacco,\r\nwhich near the top describes more of a semi-circle, but not to that\r\nextent of giving an idea of an entirely crooked plant. The stalk\r\ngradually tapers from the base to the summit, and when deprived of its\r\nleaves presents a smooth appearance not unlike that of a small tree or\r\nshrub deprived of its twigs and leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEAVES.\r\n\r\nThe Plant bears from eight to twenty leaves according to the species\r\nof the plant. They have various forms, ovate, lanceolate, and pointed.\r\nLeaves of a lanceolate form are the largest, and the shape of those\r\nfound on most varieties of the American plant. The color of the leaves\r\nwhen growing, as well as after curing and sweating, varies, and is\r\nfrequently caused by the condition of the soil. The color while\r\ngrowing may be either a light or dark green, which changes to a\r\nyellowish cast as the plant matures and ripens. The ground leaves are\r\nof a lighter color and ripen earlier than the rest--sometimes turning\r\nyellow, and during damp weather rotting and dropping from the stalk.\r\nSome varieties of the plant, like Latakia, bear small but thick\r\nleaves, which after cutting are very thin and fine in texture; while\r\nothers, like Connecticut seed leaf and Havana, bear leaves of a medium\r\nthickness, which are also fine and silky after curing. But while the\r\ncolor of the plant when growing is either a light or dark green, it\r\nrapidly changes during curing, and especially after passing through\r\nthe sweat, changing to a light or dark cinnamon like Connecticut seed\r\nleaf, black like Holland and Perique tobacco, bright yellow of the\r\nfinest shade of Virginia and Carolina leaf, brown like Sumatra, or\r\ndark red like that known by the name of \"Boshibaghli,\" grown in Asia\r\nMinor. The leaves are covered with glandular hairs containing a\r\nglutinous substance of an unpleasant odor, which characterizes all\r\nvarieties as well as nearly all parts of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of all varieties of tobacco grow the entire length of the\r\nstem and clasp the stalk, excepting those of Syrian, which are\r\nattached by a long stem. The size of the leaves, as well as the entire\r\nplant, is now much larger than when first discovered. One of the early\r\nvoyagers describes the plant as short and bearing leaves of about the\r\nsize and shape of the walnut. In many varieties the leaves grow in a\r\nsemi-circular form while in others they grow almost straight and still\r\nothers growing erect presenting a singular appearance. The stem or\r\nmid-rib running through the leaf is large and fibrous and its numerous\r\nsmaller veins proportionally larger which on curing become smaller and\r\nparticularly in those kinds best adapted for cigar wrappers. The\r\nleaves from the base to the center of the plant are of about equal\r\nsize but are smaller as they reach the summit, but after topping\r\nattain about the same size as the others. The color of the leaf after\r\ncuring may be determined by the color of the leaf while growing--if\r\ndark green while maturing in the field, the color will be dark after\r\ncuring and sweating and the reverse if of a lighter shade of green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco leaves.]\r\n\r\nIf the soil be dark the color of the leaf will be darker than if grown\r\nupon a light loam. Some varieties of the plant have leaves of a smooth\r\nglossy appearance while others are rough and the surface uneven--more\r\nlike a cabbage leaf, a peculiar feature of the tobacco of Syria. The\r\nkind of fertilizers applied to the soil also in a measure as well as\r\nthe soil itself has much to do with the texture or body of the leaf\r\nand should be duly considered by all growers of the plant. A light\r\nmoist loam should be chosen for the tobacco field if a leaf of light\r\ncolor and texture is desired while if a dark leaf is preferred the\r\nsoil chosen should be a moist heavy loam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLOWER.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the tobacco plant grow in a bunch or cluster on the\r\nsummit of the plant and are of a pink, yellow, or purple white color\r\naccording to the variety of the plant. On most varieties the color of\r\nthe flowers is pink excepting Syrian or Latakia which bears yellow\r\nflowers while those of Shiraz or Persian and Guatemala are white\r\nwhile those of the Japan tobacco, are purple. The segments of the\r\ncorolla are pointed but on some varieties unequal, particularly that\r\nof Shiraz tobacco. The flowers impart a pleasant odor doubtless to all\r\nlovers of the weed but to all others a compound of villainous smells\r\namong which and above all the rest may be recognized an odor\r\nsuggestive of the leaves of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bud and flowers.]\r\n\r\nWhen in full blossom a tobacco field forms a pleasant feature of a\r\nlandscape which is greatly heightened if the plants are large and of\r\nequal size. The pink flowers are the largest while those of a yellow\r\ncolor are the smallest. The plant comes into blossom a few weeks\r\nbefore fully ripe when with a portion of the stalk they are broken off\r\nto hasten the ripening and maturing of the leaves. After the buds\r\nappear they blossom in a few days and remain in full bloom two or\r\nthree weeks, when they perish like the blossoms of other plants and\r\nflowers. The flowers of Havana tobacco are of a lighter pink than\r\nthose of Connecticut tobacco but are not as large--a trifle larger\r\nhowever than those of Latakia tobacco. Those varieties of the tobacco\r\nplant bearing pink flowers are the finest flavored and are used\r\nchiefly for the manufacture of cigars while those bearing yellow\r\nflowers are better adapted for cutting purposes and the pipe.\r\n\r\nThe American varieties of tobacco bear a larger number of flowers\r\nthan European tobaccos or those of Africa or Asia. The color of the\r\nflowers remain the same whether cultivated in one country or another\r\nwhile the leaves may grow larger or smaller according to the system of\r\ncultivation adopted. Those varieties of the plant with heart-shaped\r\nleaves have paniculated flowers with unequal cups. The flower stems on\r\nthe American varieties are much longer than those of European tobaccos\r\nand also larger. The season has much to do with the size of the\r\nflowers; as if very dry they are usually smaller and not as numerous\r\nas if grown under more favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAPSULE.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the flowers drop from the fruit bud the capsules grow very\r\nrapidly until they have attained full size--which occurs only in those\r\nplants which have been left for seed and remain untopped. When topped\r\nthey are not usually full grown--as some growers top the plants when\r\njust coming into blossom, while others prefer to top the plants when\r\nin full bloom and others still when the blossoms begin to fall. The\r\nfruit is described by Wheeler\r\n                              \"as a capsule of a nearly oval figure.\r\n     There is a line on each side of it, and it contains two\r\n     cells, and opens at the top. The receptacles one of a\r\n     half-oval figure, punctuated and affixed to the separating\r\n     body. The seeds are numerous, kidney-shaped, and rugose.\"\r\n\r\nMost growers of the plant would describe the fruit bud as follows: In\r\nform resembling an acorn though more pointed at the top; in some\r\nspecies, of a dark brown in others of a light brown color, containing\r\ntwo cells filled with seeds similar in shape to the fruit bud, but not\r\nrugose as described by some botanists. Some writers state that each\r\ncell contains about one thousand seeds. The fruit buds of Connecticut,\r\nVirginia, Kentucky and Ohio Tobacco as well as of most of the\r\nvarieties grown within the limits of the United States are much larger\r\nthan those of Havana, Yara, Syrian, and numerous other species of the\r\nplant, while the color of these last named varieties is a lighter\r\nshade of brown. The color of the seed also varies according to the\r\nvarieties of the plant. The seeds of some species are of a dark brown\r\nwhile others are of a lighter shade. The seeds, however, are so small\r\nthat the variety to which they belong cannot be determined except by\r\nplanting or sowing them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Capsules. (Fruit bud.)]\r\n\r\nThe plants selected for seed are usually left growing until late in\r\nthe season, and at night should be protected from the cold and frost\r\nby a light covering of some kind--this may not be absolutely\r\nnecessary, as most growers of tobacco have often noticed young plants\r\ngrowing around the base or roots of the seed stalk--the seeds of which\r\ngerminated although remaining in the ground during the winter. Strong,\r\nhealthy plants generally produce large, well filled capsules the only\r\nones to be selected by the grower if large, fine plants are desired.\r\nMany growers of tobacco have doubtless examined the capsules of some\r\nspecies of the plant and frequently observed that the capsules or\r\nfruit buds are often scarcely more than half-filled while others\r\ncontain but a few seeds. The largest and finest capsules on the plant\r\nmature first, while the smaller ones grow much slower and are\r\nfrequently several weeks changing from green to brown. Many of the\r\ncapsules do not contain any seed at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUCKER.\r\n\r\nThe offshoots or suckers as they are termed, make their appearance at\r\nthe junction of the leaves and stalk, about the roots of the plant,\r\nthe result of that vigorous growth caused by topping. The suckers can\r\nhardly be seen until after the plant has been topped, when they come\r\nforward rapidly and in a short time develop into strong, vigorous\r\nshoots. Tatham describing the sucker says:\r\n\r\n     \"The sucker is a superfluous sprout which is wont to make\r\n     its appearance and shoot forth from the stem or stalk, near\r\n     to the junction of the leaves with the stems, and about the\r\n     root of the plant, and if allowed to grow, injuring the\r\n     marketable quality of the tobacco by compelling a division\r\n     of its nutriment during the act of maturation. The planter\r\n     is therefore careful to destroy these intruders with the\r\n     thumb nail, as in the act of topping. This superfluity of\r\n     vegetation, like that of the top, has been often the subject\r\n     of legislative care; and the policy of supporting the good\r\n     name of the Virginia produce has dictated the wisdom of\r\n     penal laws to maintain her good faith against imposition\r\n     upon strangers who trade with her.\"\r\n\r\nThe ripening of the suckers not only proves injurious to the quality\r\nof the leaf but retards their size and maturity and if allowed to\r\ncontinue, prevents them from attaining their largest possible growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Suckers.]\r\n\r\nOn large, strong, growing plants the growth of suckers is very rank\r\nafter attaining a length of from six to ten inches, and when fully\r\ngrown bearing flowers like the parent stalk. After growing for a\r\nlength of time they become tough and attached so firmly to the stem of\r\nthe leaf and stalk that they are broken off with difficulty,\r\nfrequently detaching the leaf with them. The growth of the suckers,\r\nhowever, determines the quality as well as the maturity of the plants.\r\n\r\nWeak, spindling plants rarely produce large, vigorous shoots, the\r\nleaves of such suckers are generally small and of a yellowish color.\r\nWhen the plants are fully ripe and ready to harvest the suckers will\r\nbe found to be growing vigorously around the root of the plant. This\r\nis doubtless the best evidence of its maturity, more reliable by far\r\nthan any other as it denotes the ripening of the entire plant.\r\nSuckering the plants hastens the ripening of the leaves, and gives a\r\nlighter shade of color, no matter on what soil the plants are grown.\r\nHaving treated at some length of the various parts of the tobacco\r\nplant--stalk, leaves, flowers, capsules and suckers we come now to its\r\nnicotine properties. The tobacco plant, as is well known, produces a\r\nvirulent poison known as Nicotine. This property, however, as well as\r\nothers as violent is found in many articles of food, including the\r\npotato together with its stalk and leaves; the effects of which may be\r\nexperienced by chewing a small quantity of the latter. The New\r\nEdinburgh Encyclopedia says:\r\n\r\n     \"The peculiar effect produced by using tobacco bears some\r\n     resemblance to intoxication and is excited by an essential\r\n     oil which in its pure state is so powerful as to destroy\r\n     life even in very minute quantity.\"\r\n\r\nChemistry has taught us that nicotine is only one among many\r\nprinciples which are contained in the plant. It is supposed by many\r\nbut not substantiated by chemical research that nicotine is not the\r\nflavoring agent which gives tobacco its essential and peculiar\r\nvarieties of odor. Such are most probably given by the essential oils,\r\nwhich vary in amount in different species of the plant.\r\n\r\nAn English writer says:\r\n\r\n     \"Nicotine is disagreeable to the habitual smoker, as is\r\n     proved by the increased demand for clean pipes or which by\r\n     some mechanical contrivance get rid of the nicotine.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Blotin tested by numerous experiments the effects of\r\nnicotine on the various parts of the organization of man. While the\r\nphysiological effects of nicotine may be interesting to the medical\r\npractitioner, they will hardly interest the general reader unless it\r\ncan be shown that the effects of nicotine and tobacco should be proved\r\nto be identical.\r\n\r\nWe are loth to leave this subject, however, as it is so intimately\r\nconnected with the history of the plant, without treating somewhat of\r\nits medicinal properties which to many are of more interest than its\r\nsocial qualities. The Indians not only used the plant socially,\r\nreligiously, but medicinally. Their Medicine men prescribed its use in\r\nvarious ways for most diseases common among them. The use thus made of\r\nthe plant attracted the attention of the Spanish and English, far more\r\nthan its use either as a means of enjoyment or as a religious act.\r\nWhen introduced to the Old World, its claims as a remedy for most\r\ndiseases gave it its popularity and served to increase its use. It was\r\nstyled \"_Sana sancta Indorum_--\" \"_Herbe propre à tous maux_,\" and\r\nphysicians claimed that it was \"the most sovereign and precious weed\r\nthat ever the earth tendered to the use of man.\" As early as 1610,\r\nthree years after the London and Plymouth Companies settled in\r\nVirginia, and some years before it began to be cultivated by them as\r\nan article of export, it had attracted the attention of English\r\nphysicians, who seemed to take as much delight in writing of the\r\nsanitary uses of the herb as they did in smoking the balmy leaves of\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\nDr. Edmund Gardiner, \"Practitioner of Physicke,\" issued in 1610 a\r\nvolume entitled, \"The Triall of Tobacco,\" setting forth its curative\r\npowers. Speaking of its use he says:\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco is not violent, and therefore may in my judgement\r\n     bee safely put in practise. Thus then you plainly see that\r\n     all medicines, and especially tobacco, being rightly and\r\n     rationally used, is a noble medicine and contrariwise not in\r\n     his due time with other circumstances considered, it doth no\r\n     more than a nobleman's shooe doth in healing the gout in the\r\n     foot.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Verner of Bath, in his Treatise concerning the taking the fume of\r\ntobacco (1637) says that when \"taken moderately and at fixed times\r\nwith its proper adjunct, which (as they doe suppose) is a cup of\r\nsack, they think it be no bad physick.\" Dr. William Barclay in his\r\nwork on Tobacco, (1614) declares \"that it worketh wonderous cures.\" He\r\nnot only defends the herb but the \"land where it groweth.\" At this\r\ntime the tobacco plant like Indian Corn was very small, possessing but\r\nfew of the qualities now required to make it merchantable. When first\r\nexported to Spain and Portugal from the West Indies and South America,\r\nand even by the English from Virginia, the leaf was dark in color and\r\nstrong and rank in flavor. This, however, seems to have been the\r\nstandard in regard to some varieties while others are spoken of by\r\nsome of the early writers upon tobacco as \"sweet.\"\r\n\r\nThe tobacco (uppowoc) grown by the Indians in America, at the time of\r\nits discovery, and more particularly in North America, would compare\r\nbetter with the suckers of the largest varieties of the plant rather\r\nthan with even the smallest species of the plant now cultivated. At\r\nthe present time tobacco culture is considered a science in order to\r\nsecure the colors in demand, and that are fashionable, and also the\r\nright texture of leaf now so desirable in all tobaccos designed for\r\nwrappers. Could the Indians, who cultivated the plant on the banks of\r\nthe James, the Amazon and other rivers of America, now look upon the\r\nplant growing in rare luxuriance upon the same fields where they first\r\nraised it, they could hardly realize them to be the same varieties\r\nthat they had previously planted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO. ITS DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly four hundred years have passed away since the tobacco plant and\r\nits use was introduced to the civilized world. It was in the month of\r\nNovember, 1492, that the sailors of Columbus in exploring the island\r\nof Cuba first noted the mode of using tobacco. They found the Indians\r\ncarrying lighted firebrands (as they at first supposed) and puffed the\r\nsmoke inhaled from their mouths and nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards concluded that this was a method common with them of\r\nperfuming themselves; but its frequent use soon taught them that it\r\nwas the dried leaves of a plant which they burned inhaling and\r\nexhaling the smoke. It attracted the attention of the Spaniards no\r\nless from its novelty than from the effect produced by the indulgence.\r\n\r\nThe use of tobacco by the Indians was entirely new to the Spanish\r\ndiscoverers and when in 1503 they landed in various parts of South\r\nAmerica they found that both chewing and smoking the herb was a common\r\ncustom with the natives. But while the Indians and their habits\r\nattracted the attention of the Spanish sailors Columbus was more\r\ndeeply interested in the great continent and the luxuriant tropical\r\ngrowth to be seen on every hand. Columbus himself says of it:--\r\n\r\n     \"Everything invited me to settle here. The beauty of the\r\n     streams, the clearness of the water, through which I could\r\n     see the sandy bottom; the multitude of palm-trees of\r\n     different kinds, the tallest and finest I had ever seen; and\r\n     an infinite number of other large and flourishing trees; the\r\n     birds, and the verdure of the plains, are so amazingly\r\n     beautiful, that this country excelles all others as far as\r\n     the day surpasses the night in splendor.\"\r\n\r\nLowe, gives the following account of the discovery of tobacco and its\r\nuses:--\r\n\r\n     \"The discovery of this plant is supposed to have been made\r\n     by Fernando Cortez in Yucatan in the Gulf of Mexico, where\r\n     he found it used universally, and held in a species of\r\n     veneration by the simple natives. He made himself acquainted\r\n     with the uses and supposed virtues of the plant and the\r\n     manner of cultivating it, and sent plants to Spain, as part\r\n     of the spoils and treasures of his new-found World.\"\r\n\r\nOviedo[4] is the first author who gives a clear account of smoking\r\namong the Indians of Hispaniola[5]. He alludes to it as one of their\r\nevil customs and used by them to produce insensibility. Their mode of\r\nusing it was by inhalation and expelling the smoke through the\r\nnostrils by means of a hollow forked cane or hollow reed. Oviedo\r\ndescribes them as\r\n                  \"about a span long; and when used the forked ends\r\n     are inserted in the nostrils, the other end being applied to\r\n     the burning leaves of the herb, using the herb in this\r\n     manner stupefied them producing a kind of intoxication.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 4: Historia General de los Indios 1526.]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 5: St. Domingo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Primitive pipe.]\r\n\r\nOf the early accounts of the plant and its use, Beckman a German\r\nwriter says:--\r\n\r\n     \"In 1496, Romanus Pane, a Spanish monk, whom Columbus, on\r\n     his second departure from America, had left in that country,\r\n     published the first account of tobacco with which he became\r\n     acquainted in St. Domingo. He gave it the name of Cohoba\r\n     Cohobba, Gioia. In 1535, the negroes had already habituated\r\n     themselves to the use of tobacco, and cultivated it in the\r\n     plantations of their masters. Europeans likewise already\r\n     smoked it.\"\r\n\r\nAn early writer thus alludes to the use of tobacco among the East\r\nIndians:--\r\n\r\n     \"The East Indians do use to make little balls of the juice\r\n     of the hearbe tobaco and the ashes of cockle-shells wrought\r\n     up together, and dryed in the shadow, and in their travaile\r\n     they place one of the balls between their neather lip and\r\n     their teeth, sucking the same continually, and letting down\r\n     the moysture, and it keepeth them both from hunger and\r\n     thirst for the space of three or four days.\"\r\n\r\nOviedo says of the implements used by the Indians in smoking:--\r\n\r\n     \"The hollow cane used by them is called tobaco and that that\r\n     name is not given to the plant or to the stupor caused by\r\n     its use.\"\r\n\r\nA writer alluding to the same subject says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The name tobacco is supposed to be derived from the Indian\r\n     tobaccos, given by the Caribs to the pipe in which they\r\n     smoked the plant.\"\r\n\r\nOthers derive it from Tabasco, a province of Mexico; others from the\r\nisland of Tobago one of the Caribbees; and others from Tobasco in the\r\ngulf of Florida.\r\n\r\nTomilson says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The word tobacco appears to have been applied by the\r\n     caribbees to the pipe in which they smoked the herb while\r\n     the Spaniards distinguished the herb itself by that name.\r\n     The more probable derivation of the word is from a place\r\n     called Tobaco in Yucatan from which the herb was first sent\r\n     to the New World.\"\r\n\r\nHumboldt says concerning the name:--\r\n\r\n     \"The word Tobacco like maize, savannah, cacique, maguey\r\n     (agave) and manato, belong to the ancient language of Hayti,\r\n     or St. Domingo. It did not properly denote the herb, but the\r\n     tube through which the smoke was inhaled. It seems\r\n     surprising that a vegetable production so universally spread\r\n     should have different names among neighboring people. The\r\n     pete-ma of the Omaguas is, no doubt, the pety of the\r\n     Guaranos; but the analogy between the Cabre and Algonkin (or\r\n     Lenni-Lennope) words which denote tobacco may be merely\r\n     accidental. The following are the synonymes in five\r\n     languages: Aztec or Mexican, _yetl_; Huron, _oyngona_;\r\n     Peruvian, _sayri_; Brazil, _piecelt_; Moxo, _sabare_.\"\r\n\r\nRoman Pane who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage alludes to\r\nanother method of using the herb.\r\n                                  They make a powder of the leaves,\r\n     which \"they take through a cane half a cubit long; one end\r\n     of this they place in the nose, and the other upon the\r\n     powder, and so draw it up, which purges them very much.\"\r\n\r\nThis is doubtless the first account that we have of snuff-taking;\r\nFairholt says concerning its use:--\r\n\r\n     \"Its effects upon the Indians in both instances seem to have\r\n     been more violent and peculiar than upon Europeans since.\"\r\n\r\nThis may be accounted for from the fact of the imperfect method of\r\ncuring tobacco adopted by them and all of the natives up to the period\r\nof the settlement of Virginia by the English. As nearly all of the\r\nearly voyagers allude to the plant and especially to its use it would\r\nseem probable that it had been cultivated from time immemorial by all\r\nthe native people of the Orinoco; and at the period of the conquest\r\nthe habit of smoking was found to be alike spread over both North and\r\nSouth America. The Tamanacs and the Maypures of Guiana wrap maize\r\nleaves round their cigars as the Mexicans did at the time of the\r\narrival of Cortez. The Spaniards since have substituted paper for the\r\nleaves of maize, in imitation of them.\r\n\r\n     \"The poor Indians of the forests of the Orinoco know as well\r\n     as did the great nobles at the court of Montezuma, that the\r\n     smoke of tobacco is an excellent narcotic; and they use it\r\n     not only to procure their afternoon nap, but also to put\r\n     themselves in that state of quiescence which they call\r\n     dreaming with the eyes open or day dreaming.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Native smoking.]\r\n\r\nTobacco at this period was also rolled up in the leaves of the Palm\r\nand smoked. Columbus found the natives of San Salvador smoking after\r\nthis manner. Lobel in his History of Plants[6] gives an engraving of\r\na native smoking one of these rolls or primitive cigars and speaks of\r\ntheir general use by Captains of ships trading to the West Indies.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 6: History of Plants, 1576.]\r\n\r\nBut not only was snuff taking and the use of tobacco rolls or cigars\r\nnoted by European voyagers, but the use of the pipe also in some parts\r\nof America, seemed to be a common custom especially among the chiefs.\r\nBe Bry in his History of Brazil (1590) describes its use and also some\r\ninteresting particulars concerning the plant. Their method of curing\r\nthe leaves was to air-dry them and then packing them until wanted for\r\nuse. In smoking he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"When the leaves are well dried they place in the open part\r\n     of a pipe of which on burning, the smoke is inhaled into the\r\n     mouth by the more narrow part of the pipe, and so strongly\r\n     that it flows out of the mouth and nostrils, and by that\r\n     means effectually drives out humours.\"\r\n\r\nFairholt in alluding to the various uses of the herb among the Indians\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"We can thus trace to South America, at the period when the\r\n     New World was first discovered, every mode of using the\r\n     tobacco plant which the Old World has indulged in ever\r\n     since.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement is not entirely correct--the mode of using tobacco in\r\nNorway by plugging the nostrils with small pieces of tobacco seems to\r\nhave been unknown among the Indians of America as it is now with all\r\nother nationalities, excepting the Norwegians.\r\n\r\nWhen Cortez made conquest of Mexico in 1519 smoking seemed to be a\r\ncommon as well as an ancient custom among the natives. Benzoni in his\r\nHistory of the New World[7] describing his travels in America gives a\r\ndetailed account of the plant and their method of curing and using it.\r\nIn both North and South America the use of tobacco seemed to be\r\nuniversal among all the tribes and beyond all question the custom of\r\nusing the herb had its origin among them. The traditions of the\r\nIndians all confirm its ancient source; they considered the plant as a\r\ngift from the Great Spirit for their comfort and enjoyment and one\r\nwhich the Great Spirit also indulged in, consequently with them\r\nsmoking partook of the character of a moral if not a religious act.\r\nThe use of tobacco in sufficient quantities to produce intoxication\r\nseemed to be a favorite remedy for most diseases among them and was\r\nadministered by their doctors or medicine-men in large quantities.\r\nBenzoni gives an engraving of their mode of inhaling the smoke and\r\nsays of its use:--\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 7: From 1541 to 1556.]\r\n\r\n     \"In La Espanola, when their doctors wanted to cure a sick\r\n     man, they went to the place where they were to administer\r\n     the smoke, and when he was thoroughly intoxicated by it, the\r\n     cure was mostly effected. On returning to his senses he told\r\n     a thousand stories of his having been at the council of the\r\n     gods, and other high visions.\"\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be supposed that while the custom of using tobacco among\r\nthe Indians in both North and South America was very general and the\r\nmode of use the same, that the plant grown was of the same quality in\r\none part as in another. While the rude culture of the natives would\r\nhardly tend to an improvement in quality; the climate being varied\r\nwould no doubt have much to do with the size and quality of the plant.\r\nThis would seem the more probable for as soon as its cultivation began\r\nin Virginia by the English colonists it had successful rivals in the\r\ntobacco of the West Indies and South America. Robertson says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Virginia tobacco was greatly inferior to that raised by the\r\n     Spaniards in the West Indies and which sold for six times as\r\n     much as Virginia tobacco.\"[8]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 8: West India tobacco sold for 18 shillings\r\n              per pound and Virginia for 3 s.]\r\n\r\nBut not only has the name tobacco and the implements employed in its\r\nuse caused much discussion but also the origin of the plant.\r\n\r\nSome writers affirm that it came from Asia and that it was first grown\r\nin China having been used by the Chinese long before the narcotic\r\nproperties of opium were known. Tatham in his work on Tobacco says of\r\nits origin in substantial agreement with La Bott:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is generally understood that the tobacco plant of\r\n     Virginia is a native production of the country; but whether\r\n     it was found in a state of natural growth there, or a plant\r\n     cultivated by the Indian natives, is a point of which we are\r\n     not informed, nor which ever can be farther elucidated than\r\n     by the corroboration of historical facts and conjectures. I\r\n     have been thirty years ago, and the greatest part of my time\r\n     during that period, intimately acquainted with the interior\r\n     parts of America; and have been much in the unsettled parts\r\n     of the country, among those kinds of soil which are\r\n     favorable to the cultivation of tobacco; but I do not\r\n     recollect one single instance where I have met with tobacco\r\n     growing wild in the woods, although I have often found a few\r\n     spontaneous plants about the arable and trodden grounds of\r\n     deserted habitations. This circumstance, as well as that of\r\n     its being now, and having been, cultivated by the natives at\r\n     the period of European discoveries, inclines towards a\r\n     supposition that this plant is not a native of North\r\n     America, but may possibly have found its way thither with\r\n     the earliest migrations from some distant land. This might,\r\n     indeed, have easily been the case from South America, by way\r\n     of the Isthmus of Panama; and the foundation of the Choctaw\r\n     and Chickasaw nations (who we have reasons to consider as\r\n     descendants from the Tloseolians, and to have migrated to\r\n     the eastward of the river Mississippi, about the time of the\r\n     Spanish conquest of Mexico by Cortez), seems to have\r\n     afforded one fair opportunity for its dissemination.\"\r\n\r\nThe first knowledge which the English discoverers had of the plant was\r\nin 1565 when they found it growing in Florida, one hundred and\r\nseventy-three years after it was first discovered by Columbus on the\r\nisland of Cuba. Sir John Hawkins says of its use in Florida:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Floridians, when they travel, have a kind of herb\r\n     dried, which with a cane and an earthen cup in the end, with\r\n     fire and the dried herbs put together, do suke through the\r\n     cane the smoke thereof, which smoke satisfieth their hunger,\r\n     and therewith they live four or five dayes without meat or\r\n     drinke, and this all the Frenchmen used for this purpose:\r\n     yet do they holde opinion withall, that it causeth water and\r\n     steame to void from their stomacks.\"\r\n\r\nThis preparation might not have been tobacco as the Indians smoke a\r\nkind of bark which they scrape from the killiconick, an aromatic\r\nshrub, in form resembling the willow; they use also a preparation\r\nmade with this and sumach leaves, or sometimes with the latter mixed\r\nwith tobacco. Lionel Wafer in his travels upon the Isthmus of Darien\r\nin 1699 saw the plant growing and cultivated by the natives. He\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"These Indians have tobacco amongst them. It grows as the\r\n     tobacco in Virginia, but is not so strong, perhaps for want\r\n     of transplanting and manuring, which the Indians do not well\r\n     understand, for they only raise it from the seed in their\r\n     plantations. When it is dried and cured they strip it from\r\n     the stalks, and laying two or three leaves upon one another,\r\n     they roll up all together sideways into a long roll, yet\r\n     leaving a little hollow. Round this they roll other leaves\r\n     one after another, in the same manner, but close and hard,\r\n     till the roll be as big as one's wrist, and two or three\r\n     feet in length. Their way of smoking when they are in\r\n     company is thus: a boy lights one end of a roll and burns it\r\n     to a coal, wetting the part next it to keep it from wasting\r\n     too fast. The end so lighted he puts into his mouth, and\r\n     blows the smoke through the whole length of the roll into\r\n     the face of every one of the company or council, though\r\n     there be two or three hundred of them. Then they, sitting in\r\n     their usual posture upon forms, make with their hands held\r\n     together a kind of funnel round their mouths and noses. Into\r\n     this they receive the smoke as it is blown upon them,\r\n     snuffing it up greedily and strongly as long as ever they\r\n     are able to hold their breath, and seeming to bless\r\n     themselves, as it were, with the refreshment it gives them.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1534 James Cartier a Frenchman was commissioned to explore\r\nthe coast of North America, with a view to find a place for a colony.\r\nHe observed that the natives of Canada used the leaves of an herb\r\nwhich they preserved in pouches made of skins and smoked in stone\r\npipes. It being offensive to the French, they took none of it with\r\nthem on their return. But writing more particularly concerning the\r\nplant he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"In Hochelaga, up the river in Canada there groweth a\r\n     certain kind of herb whereof in Summer they make a great\r\n     provision for all the year, making great account of it, and\r\n     only men use of it, and first they cause it to be dried in\r\n     the Sune, then wear it about their necks wrapped in a little\r\n     beast's skine made like a bagge, with a hollow piece of\r\n     stone or wood like a pipe, then when they please they make\r\n     powder of it, and then put it in one of the ends of the said\r\n     Cornet or pipe, and laying a cole of fire upon it, at the\r\n     other end and suck so long, that they fill their bodides\r\n     full of smoke, till that it commeth out of their mouth and\r\n     nostrils, even as out of the Tonnel of a chimney. They say\r\n     that this doth keepe them warme and in health, they never\r\n     goe without some of this about them.\"\r\n\r\nBe Bry in his History of Brazil 1590 gives an engraving of a native\r\nsmoking a pipe and a female offering him a handful of tobacco leaves.\r\nThe pipe has a modern look and is altogether unlike those found by the\r\nEnglish in use among the Indians in Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old engraving.]\r\n\r\nAn English writer says of the Tobacco using races:--\r\n\r\n     \"From the evidence collected by travellers and\r\n     archæologists, as to the native arts and relics connected\r\n     with the use of Tobacco by the Red Indians, it would appear\r\n     that not one tribe has been found which was unacquainted\r\n     with the custom,[9] its use being as well known to the\r\n     tribes of the North-west and the denizens of the snowy wilds\r\n     of Canada, as to the races inhabiting Central America and\r\n     the West India Islands.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 9: Arnold in his History of Rhode Island\r\n              refers to the planting of tobacco by the Indians when\r\n              the State was first settled. Elliot also says in his\r\n              History of the same State:--\"Tobacco was universal,\r\n              every man carrying his pipe and bag; and in its\r\n              cultivation only, did the men condescend to labor; but\r\n              occasionally all would join, the whole neighborhood,\r\n              men, women, and children, when some one's field was to\r\n              be broken up, and they made a loving, sociable, speedy\r\n              time of it.\"]\r\n\r\nFather Francisco Creuxio states that the Jesuit missionaries found the\r\nweed extensively used by the Indians of the Seventeenth Century. In\r\n1629 he found the Hurons smoking the dried leaves and stalks of the\r\nTobacco plant or petune. Many tribes of Indians consider that Tobacco\r\nis a gift bestowed by the Great Spirit as a means of enjoyment. In\r\nconsequence of this belief the pipe became sacred, and smoking became\r\na moral if not a religious act, amongst the North American Indians.\r\nThe Iroquois are of opinion that by burning Tobacco they could send up\r\ntheir prayers to the Great Spirit with the ascending incense, thus\r\nmaintaining communication with the spirit world; and Dr. Daniel\r\nWilson suggests that\r\n                     \"the practice of smoking originated in the use of\r\n     the intoxicating fumes for purposes of divination, and other\r\n     superstitious rites.\"\r\n\r\nWhen an Indian goes on an expedition, whether of peace or war, his\r\npipe is his constant companion; it is to him what salt is among Arabs:\r\nthe pledge of fidelity and the seal of treaties. In the words of a\r\n_Review_:\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco supplies one of the few comforts by which men who\r\n     live by their hands, solace themselves under incessant\r\n     hardship.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the presence, and use of tobacco by the natives of America are\r\namong the most interesting features connected with its history, it can\r\nhardly be more so than is its early cultivation by the Spaniards,\r\nEnglish and Dutch, and afterward by the French. The cultivation of the\r\nplant began in the West India Islands and South America early in the\r\nSixteenth Century. In Cuba its culture commenced in 1580, and from\r\nthis and the other islands large quantities were shipped to Europe. It\r\nwas also cultivated near Varina in Columbia, while Amazonian tobacco\r\nhad acquired an enviable reputation as well as Varinian, long before\r\nits cultivation began in Virginia by the English. At this period of\r\nits culture in America the entire product was sent to Spain and\r\nPortugal, and from thence to France and Great Britain and other\r\ncountries of Europe. The plant and its use attracted at once the\r\nattention as well as aroused the cupidity of the Spaniards, who prized\r\nit as one of their greatest discoveries.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Tobacco was introduced into Europe by the Spaniards, and\r\nits use became a general custom, its sale increased as extensively as\r\nits cultivation. At this period it brought enormous prices, the finest\r\nselling at from fifteen to eighteen shillings per pound. Its\r\ncultivation by the Spaniards in various portions of the New World\r\nproved to them not only its real value as an article of commerce, but\r\nalso that several varieties of the plant existed; as on removal from\r\none island or province to another it changed in size and quality of\r\nleaf. Varinas tobacco at this time was one of the finest tobaccos\r\nknown,[10] and large quantities were shipped to Spain and Portugal.\r\nThe early voyagers little dreamed, however, of the vast proportions to\r\nbe assumed by the trade in the plant which they had discovered, and\r\nwhich in time proved a source of the greatest profit not only to the\r\nEuropean colonies, but to the dealers in the Old World.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 10: Trinidad tobacco was then considered the\r\n              finest.]\r\n\r\nHelps, treating on this same subject, says:\r\n\r\n     \"It is interesting to observe the way in which a new product\r\n     is introduced to the notice of the Old World--a product that\r\n     was hereafter to become, not only an unfailing source of\r\n     pleasure to a large section of the whole part of mankind,\r\n     from the highest to the lowest, but was also to distinguish\r\n     itself as one of those commodities for revenue, which are\r\n     the delight of statesmen, the great financial resource of\r\n     modern nations, and which afford a means of indirect\r\n     taxation that has perhaps nourished many a war, and\r\n     prevented many a revolution. The importance, financially and\r\n     commercially speaking, of this discovery of tobacco--a\r\n     discovery which in the end proved more productive to the\r\n     Spanish crown than that of the gold mines of the Indies.\"\r\n\r\nSpain and Portugal in all their colonies fostered and encouraged its\r\ncultivation and then at once ranked as the best producers and dealers\r\nin tobacco. The varieties grown by them in the West Indies and South\r\nAmerica were highly esteemed and commanded much higher prices than\r\nthat grown by the English and Dutch colonies. In 1620, however, the\r\nDutch merchants were the largest wholesale tobacconists in Europe, and\r\nthe people of Holland, generally, the greatest consumers of the weed.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of 1584, under the auspices of Sir Walter Raleigh,\r\nwhich resulted in the discovery of Virginia, also introduced the\r\ntobacco plant, among other novelties, to the attention of the English.\r\nHariot,[11] who sailed with this expedition, says of the plant:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 11: A brief and true Report of the New Found\r\n              Land of Virginia (London, 1588).]\r\n\r\n     \"There is an herb which is sowed apart by itselfe, and is\r\n     called by the inhabitants uppowoc. In the West Indies it\r\n     hath divers names, according to the severall places and\r\n     countries where it groweth and is used; the Spaniards\r\n     generally call it Tobacco. The leaves thereof being dried\r\n     and brought into powder, they use to take the fume or smoke\r\n     thereof by sucking it through pipes made of clay into their\r\n     stomacke and heade, from whence it purgeth superfluous\r\n     fleame and other grosse humors; openeth all the pores and\r\n     passages of the body; by which means the use thereof not\r\n     only preserveth the body from obstructions, but also if any\r\n     be so that they have not beene of too long continuance, in\r\n     short time breaketh them; whereby their bodies are notably\r\n     preserved in health, and know not many grievous diseases\r\n     wherewithall we in England are oftentimes affected. This\r\n     uppowoc is of so precious estimation amongest them that they\r\n     thinke their gods are marvellously delighted therewith;\r\n     whereupon sometime they make halowed fires, and cast some of\r\n     the powder therein for a sacrifise. Being in a storme uppon\r\n     the waters, to pacifie their gods, they cast some up into\r\n     the aire and into the water: so a weave for fish being newly\r\n     set up, they cast some therein and into the aire; also after\r\n     an escape of danger they cast some into the aire likewise;\r\n     but all done with strange gestures, stamping, sometimes\r\n     dancing, clapping of hands, holding up of hands, and staring\r\n     up into the heavens, uttering there withal and chattering\r\n     strange wordes, and noises.\r\n\r\n     \"We ourselves during the time we were there used to suck it\r\n     after their manner, as also since our returne, and have\r\n     found many rare and wonderful experiments of the virtues\r\n     thereof; of which the relation would require a volume of\r\n     itselfe; the use of it by so manie of late, men and women,\r\n     of great calling as else, and some learned phisitions also\r\n     is sufficient witnes.\"\r\n\r\nThe natives also when Drake[12] landed in Virginia, \"brought a little\r\nbasket made of rushes, and filled with an herbe which they called\r\nTobah;\" they \"came also the second time to us bringing with them as\r\nbefore had been done, feathers and bags of Tobah for presents, or\r\nrather indeed for sacrifices, upon this persuasion that we were gods.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 12: The World Encompassed. London, 1628.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Strachey[13] says of tobacco and its cultivation by the\r\nIndians:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 13: \"The Historie of Travaile into Virginia\r\n              Britannica.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"Here is great store of tobacco, which the salvages call\r\n     apooke: howbeit it is not of the best kynd, it is but poor\r\n     and weake, and of a byting taste; it grows not fully a yard\r\n     above ground, bearing a little yellow flower like to\r\n     henbane; the leaves are short and thick, somewhat round at\r\n     the upper end; whereas the best tobacco of Trynidado and the\r\n     Oronoque, is large, sharpe, and growing two or three yardes\r\n     from the ground, bearing a flower of the breadth of our\r\n     bell-flower, in England; the salvages here dry the leaves of\r\n     this apooke over the fier, and sometymes in the sun, and\r\n     crumble yt into poudre, stalk, leaves, and all, taking the\r\n     same in pipes of earth, which very ingeniously they can\r\n     make.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The contrast.]\r\n\r\nIt would seem then, if the account given by Strachey be correct, that\r\nthe tobacco cultivated by the Indians of North America was of inferior\r\ngrowth and quality to that grown in many portions of South America,\r\nand more particularly in the West India islands. As there are still\r\nmany varieties of the plant grown in America, so there doubtless was\r\nwhen cultivated by the Indians. While most probably the quality of\r\nleaf remained the same from generation to generation, still in some\r\nportions of America, owing more to the soil and climate than the mode\r\nof cultivating by them, they cured very good tobacco. We can readily\r\nsee how this might have been, from numerous experiments made with both\r\nAmerican and European varieties. Nearly all of the early Spanish,\r\nFrench and English voyagers who landed in America were attracted by\r\nthe beauty of the country. Ponce De Leon, who sailed from Spain to the\r\nFloridas, was charmed by the plants and flowers, and doubtless the\r\nfirst sight of them strengthened his belief in the existence somewhere\r\nin this tropical region of the fountain of youth.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of tobacco proved of the greatest advantage to the\r\nnations who fostered its growth,--and increased the commerce of both\r\nEngland and Spain, doing much to make the latter what it once was, one\r\nof the most powerful nations of Europe and possessor of the largest\r\nand richest colonies, while it greatly helped the former, already\r\nunsurpassed in intelligence and civilization, to reach its present\r\nposition at the commercial head of the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nAs Spain, however, has fallen from the high place she once held, her\r\ncolonial system has also gone down. And while England, thanks to her\r\nmore liberal policy, still retains a large share of the territory\r\nwhich she possessed at first, Spain, which once held sway over a vast\r\nportion of America, has been deprived of nearly all of her colonies,\r\nand ere long may lose control of the island on which the discoverer of\r\nAmerica first saw the plant.[14]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 14: \"Spain has doubtless conquered more of the\r\n              Earth's surface than any other modern nation; and her\r\n              peculiar national character has also caused her to make\r\n              the worst use of them. It was always easier for the Moor\r\n              to conquer than to make a good use of his conquests; and\r\n              so it has always been with Spain.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is an historical fact that wherever in the English and Spanish\r\ncolonies civilization has taken the deepest root, so has also the\r\nplant which has become as famous as any of the great tropical products\r\nof the earth. The relation existing between the balmy plant and the\r\ncommerce of the world is of the strongest kind. Fairholt has well\r\nsaid, that \"the revenue brought to our present Sovereign Lady from\r\nthis source alone is greater than that Queen Elizabeth received from\r\nthe entire customs of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe narrow view of commercial policy held by her successors, the\r\nStuarts, induced them to hamper the colonists of America with\r\nrestrictions; because they were alarmed lest the ground should be\r\nentirely devoted to tobacco. Had not this Indian plant been\r\ndiscovered, the whole history of some portions of America would have\r\nbeen far different. In the West Indies three great products--Coffee,\r\nSugar-Cane, and Tobacco,--have proved sources of the greatest\r\nwealth--and wherever introduced, have developed to a great extent the\r\nresources of the islands. Thus it may be seen that while the Spaniards\r\nby the discovery and colonization of large portions of America\r\nstrengthened the currency of the world, the English alike, by the\r\ncultivation of the plant, gave an impetus to commerce still felt and\r\ncontinued throughout all parts of the globe.\r\n\r\n     An English writer has truthfully observed that \"Tobacco is\r\n     like Elias' cloud, which was no bigger than a man's hand,\r\n     that hath suddenly covered the face of the earth; the low\r\n     countries, Germany, Poland, Arabia, Persia, Turkey, almost\r\n     all countries, drive a trade of it; and there is no\r\n     commodity that hath advanced so many from small fortunes to\r\n     gain great estates in the world. Sailors will be supplied\r\n     with it for their long voyages. Soldiers cannot (but) want\r\n     it when they keep guard all night, or upon other hard duties\r\n     in cold and tempestuous weather. Farmers, ploughmen, and\r\n     almost all labouring men, plead for it. If we reflect upon\r\n     our forefathers, and that within the time of less than one\r\n     hundred years, before the use of tobacco came to be known\r\n     amongst us, we cannot but wonder how they did to subsist\r\n     without it; for were the planting or traffick of tobacco now\r\n     hindered, millions of this nation in all probability must\r\n     perish for the want of food, their whole livelihood almost\r\n     depending upon it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen first discovered in America, and particularly by the English in\r\nVirginia, the plant was cultivated only by the females of the tribes,\r\nthe chiefs and warriors engaging only in the chase or following the\r\nwarpath. They cultivated a few plants around their wigwams, and cured\r\na few pounds for their own use. The smoke, as it ascended from their\r\npipes and circled around their rude huts and out into the air, seemed\r\ntypical of the race--the original cultivators and smokers of the\r\nplant. But, unlike the great herb which they cherished and gave to\r\ncivilization, they have gradually grown weak in numbers and faded\r\naway, while the great plant has gone on its way, ever assuming more\r\nand more sway over the commercial and social world, until it now takes\r\nhigh rank among the leading elements of mercantile and agricultural\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not find in any accounts of the English voyagers made previous\r\nto 1584, any mention of the discovery of tobacco, or its use among the\r\nIndians. This may appear a little strange, as Captains Amidas and\r\nBarlow, who sailed from England under the auspices of Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh in 1584, on returning from Virginia, had brought home with\r\nthem pearls and tobacco among other curiosities. But while we have no\r\naccount of those who returned from the voyage made in 1602 taking any\r\ntobacco with them, it is altogether probable that those who remained\r\ntook a lively interest in the plant and the Indian mode of use; for we\r\nfind that in nine years after they landed at Jamestown tobacco had\r\nbecome quite an article of culture and commerce.\r\n\r\nHamo in alluding to the early cultivation of tobacco by the colony,\r\nsays, that John Rolfe was the pioneer tobacco planter. In his words:\r\n\r\n     \"I may not forget the gentleman worthie of much\r\n     commendations, which first took the pains to make triall\r\n     thereof, his name Mr. John Rolfe, Anno Domini 1612, partly\r\n     for the love he hath a long time borne unto it, and partly\r\n     to raise commodities to the adventurers, in whose behalfe I\r\n     intercede and vouchsafe to hold my testimony in beleefe that\r\n     during the time of his aboade there, which draweth neere\r\n     sixe years no man hath laboured to his power there, and\r\n     worthy incouragement unto England, by his letters than he\r\n     hath done, witness his marriage with Powhatan's daughter one\r\n     of rude education, manners barbarous, and cursed generation\r\n     merely for the good and honor of the plantation.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Rolfe.]\r\n\r\nThe first general planting of tobacco by the colony began according to\r\nthis writer--\r\n             \"at West and Sherley Hundred (seated on the north side of\r\n     the river, lower than the Bermudas three or four myles)\r\n     where are twenty-five commanded by capten Maddeson--who are\r\n     imployed onely in planting and curing tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in 1616, when the colony numbered only three hundred and\r\nfifty-one persons. Rolfe, in his relation of the state of Virginia,\r\nwritten and addressed to the King, gives the following description of\r\nthe condition of the colony in 1616:\r\n\r\n     \"Now that your highness may with the more ease understand in\r\n     what condition the colony standeth, I have briefly sett\r\n     downe the manner of all men's several imployments, the\r\n     number of them, and the several places of their aboad, which\r\n     places or seates are all our owne ground, not so much by\r\n     conquest, which the Indians hold a just and lawfull title,\r\n     but purchased of them freely, and they verie willingly\r\n     selling it. The places which are now possessed and inhabited\r\n     are sixe:--Henrico and the lymitts, Bermuda Nether hundred,\r\n     West and Sherley hundred, James Towne, Kequoughtan, and\r\n     Dales-Gift. The generall mayne body of the planters are\r\n     divided into Officers, Laborers, Farmors.\r\n\r\n     \"The officers have the charge and care as well over the\r\n     farmors as laborers generallie--that they watch and ward for\r\n     their preservacions; and that both the one and the other's\r\n     busines may be daily followed to the performance of those\r\n     imployments, which from the one are required, and the other\r\n     by covenant are bound unto. These officers are bound to\r\n     maintayne themselves and families with food and rayment by\r\n     their owne and their servant's industrie. The laborers are\r\n     of two sorts. Some employed onely in the generall works, who\r\n     are fedd and clothed out of the store--others, specially\r\n     artificers as smiths, carpenters, shoemakers, taylors,\r\n     tanners, &c., doe worke in their professions for the colony,\r\n     and maintayne themselves with food and apparrell, having\r\n     time lymitted them to till and manure their ground.\r\n\r\n     \"The farmors live at most ease--yet by their good endeavors\r\n     bring yearlie much plentie to the plantation. They are bound\r\n     by covenant, both for themselves and servants, to maintaine\r\n     your Ma'ties right and title in that kingdom, against all\r\n     foreigne and domestique enemies. To watch and ward in the\r\n     townes where they are resident. To do thirty-one dayes\r\n     service for the colony, when they shalbe called\r\n     thereunto--yet not at all tymes, but when their owne busines\r\n     can best spare them. To maintayne themselves and families\r\n     with food and rayment--and every farmor to pay yearlie into\r\n     the magazine for himself and every man servant, two barrells\r\n     and a halfe of English measure.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus briefly have I sett downe every man's particular\r\n     imployment and manner of living; albeit, lest the\r\n     people--who generallie are bent to covett after gaine,\r\n     especially having tasted of the sweete of their\r\n     labors--should spend too much of their tyme and labor in\r\n     planting tobacco, known to them to be verie vendible in\r\n     England, and so neglect their tillage of corne, and fall\r\n     into want thereof, it is provided for--by the providence\r\n     and care of Sir Thomas Dale--that no farmor or other, who\r\n     must maintayne themselves--shall plant any tobacco, unless\r\n     he shall yearely manure, set and maintayne for himself and\r\n     every man servant two acres of ground with corne, which\r\n     doing they may plant as much tobacco as they will, els all\r\n     their tobacco shalbe forfeite to the colony--by which meanes\r\n     the magazine shall yearely be sure to receave their rent of\r\n     corne; to maintayne those who are fedd thereout, being but a\r\n     few, and manie others, if need be; they themselves will be\r\n     well stored to keepe their families with overplus, and reape\r\n     tobacco enough to buy clothes and such other necessaries as\r\n     are needful for themselves and household. For an easie\r\n     laborer will keepe and tend two acres of corne, and cure a\r\n     good store of tobacco--being yet the principall commoditie\r\n     the colony for the present yieldeth.\r\n\r\n     \"For which as for other commodities, the councell and\r\n     company for Virginia have already sent a ship thither,\r\n     furnished with all manner of clothing, household stuff and\r\n     such necessaries, to establish a magazine there, which the\r\n     people shall buy at easie rates for their commodities--they\r\n     selling them at such prices that the adventurers may be no\r\n     loosers. This magazine shalbe yearelie supplied to furnish\r\n     them, if they will endeavor, by their labor, to maintayne\r\n     it--which wilbe much beneficiall to the planters and\r\n     adventurers, by interchanging their commodities, and will\r\n     add much encouragement to them and others to preserve and\r\n     follow the action with a constant resolution to uphold the\r\n     same.\"\r\n\r\nThe colony at this time was engaged in planting corn and tobacco,\r\n\"making pitch and tarr, potashes, charcole, salt,\" and in fishing. Of\r\nJamestown he says:\r\n\r\n     \"At James Toune (seated on the north side of the river, from\r\n     West and Sherley Hundred lower down about thirty-seven\r\n     miles) are fifty, under the command of lieutenant Sharpe, in\r\n     the absence of capten Francis West, Esq., brother to the\r\n     right ho'ble the L. Lawarre,--whereof thirty-one are\r\n     farmors; all theis maintayne themselves with food and\r\n     rayment. Mr. Richard Buck minister there--a verie good\r\n     preacher.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Hugh Jones \"Chaplain to the Honourable Assembly, and lately\r\nMinister of James-Towne and in Virginia,\" in a work entitled--\"The\r\nPresent State of Virginia,\" gives the following account of the\r\ncultivation of tobacco:\r\n\r\n     \"When a tract of land is seated, they clear it by felling\r\n     the trees about a yard from the ground, lest they should\r\n     shoot again. What wood they have occasion for they carry\r\n     off, and burn the rest, or let it lie and rot upon the\r\n     ground. The land between the logs and stumps they hoe up,\r\n     planting tobacco there in the spring, inclosing it with a\r\n     slight fence of cleft rails. This will last for tobacco some\r\n     years, if the land be good; as it is where fine timber, or\r\n     grape vines grow. Land when hired is forced to bear tobacco\r\n     by penning their cattle upon it; but cowpen tobacco tastes\r\n     strong, and that planted in wet marshy land is called\r\n     nonburning tobacco, which smoaks in the pipe like leather,\r\n     unless it be of a good age. When land is tired of tobacco,\r\n     it will bear Indian Corn or English Wheat, or any other\r\n     European grain or seed with wonderful increase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Virginia tobacco field, 1620.]\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco and Indian Corne are planted in hills as hops, and\r\n     secured by worm fences, which are made of rails supporting\r\n     one another very firmly in a particular manner. Tobacco\r\n     requires a great deal of skill and trouble in the right\r\n     management of it. They raise the plants in beds, as we do\r\n     Cabbage plants; which they transplant and replant upon\r\n     occasion after a shower of rain, which they call a season.\r\n     When it is grown up they top it, or nip off the head,\r\n     succour it, or cut off the ground leaves, weed it, hill it;\r\n     and when ripe, they cut it down about six or eight leaves on\r\n     a stalk, which they carry into airy tobacco houses, after it\r\n     is withered a little in the sun, there it is hung to dry on\r\n     sticks, as paper at the paper-mills; when it is in proper\r\n     case, (as they call it) and the air neither too moist, nor\r\n     too dry, they strike it, or take it down, then cover it up\r\n     in bulk, or a great heap, where it lies till they have\r\n     leisure or occasion to strip it (that is pull the leaves\r\n     from the stalk) or stem it (that is to take out the great\r\n     fibres) and tie it up in hands, or streight lay it; and so\r\n     by degrees prize or press it with proper engines into great\r\n     Hogsheads, containing from about six to eleven hundred\r\n     pounds; four of which Hogsheads make a tun by dimention, not\r\n     by weight; then it is ready for sale or shipping.\r\n\r\n     \"There are two sorts of tobacco, viz., Oroonoko the\r\n     stronger, and sweet-scented the milder; the first with a\r\n     sharper leaf like a Fox's ear, and the other rounder and\r\n     with finer fibres: But each of these are varied into several\r\n     sorts, much as Apples and Pears are; and I have been\r\n     informed by the Indian traders, that the Inland Indians have\r\n     sorts of tobacco much differing from any planted or used by\r\n     the Europeans. The Indian Corn is planted in hills and\r\n     weeded much as tobacco. This grain is of great increase and\r\n     most general use; for with this is made good bread, cakes,\r\n     mush, and hommony for the negroes, which with good pork and\r\n     potatoes (red and white, very nice and different from ours)\r\n     with other roots and pulse, are their general food.\"\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of tobacco increased with the growth of the colony and\r\nthe increase of price which at this time was sufficient to induce most\r\nof the planters to neglect the culture of Corn and Wheat, devoting\r\ntheir time to growing their \"darling tobacco.\" The first thirty years\r\nafter the colonization of Virginia by the English, the colony made but\r\nlittle progress owing in part to private factions and Indian wars. The\r\nhorrid massacres by the Indians threatened the extermination of the\r\ncolony, and for a time the plantations were neglected and even tobacco\r\nbecame more of an article of import than of export, which is\r\nsubstantiated by an early writer of the colony who says:--\"A vast\r\nquantity of tobacco is consumed in the country in smoking, chewing,\r\nand snuff.\" Frequent complaints were made by the colony of want of\r\nstrength and danger of imminent famine, owing in part to the presence\r\nof a greater number of adventurers than of actual settlers,--such\r\nbeing the case the resources of the country were in a measure limited.\r\n\r\nThe demand for tobacco in England increasing each year, together with\r\nthe high price paid for that from Virginia (3 s. per lb.), stimulated\r\nthe planters to hazard all their time and labor upon one crop,\r\nneglecting the cultivation of the smaller grains, intent only upon\r\ncuring \"a good store of tobacco.\" The company of adventurers at length\r\nfound it necessary to check the excessive planting of the weed, and by\r\nthe consent of the \"Generall Assemblie\" restraining the plantations to\r\n\"one hundred plants[15] ye headd, uppon each of wich plantes there are\r\nto bee left butt onely nyne leaves wich portions as neare as could be\r\nguessed, was generally conceaved would be agreable with the hundred\r\nwaight you have allowed.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 15: Another account is sixty pounds per head.]\r\n\r\nIn 1639 the \"Grand Assembly\" (summoned the sixth of January) passed a\r\nlaw restricting the growth of the colony to 1,500,000 lbs., and to\r\n1,200,000 in the two years next ensuing. The exporting of the poorer\r\nqualities of tobacco by the colony caused much dissatisfaction as will\r\nbe seen by a letter of the Company dated 11th September, 1621:\r\n\r\n     \"We are assured from our Factor in Holland that except the\r\n     tobacco that shall next come thence prove to be of more\r\n     perfection and goodnesse than that was sent home last, there\r\n     is no hope that it vend att all, for albeit itt passed once\r\n     yett the wary buyer will not be againe taken, so that we\r\n     heartily wish that youe would make some provision for the\r\n     burninge of all base and rotten stuff, and not suffer any\r\n     but very good to be cured at least sent home, whereby these\r\n     would certainly be more advanced in the price upon lesse in\r\n     the quantity; howsoever we hope that no bad nor ill\r\n     conditioned tobacco shall be by compelling authoritie\r\n     (abusing its power given for public good to private benefit)\r\n     putt uppon or Factor, and very earnestly desire that he may\r\n     have the helpe of justice to constraine men to pay their\r\n     debts unto him both remaining of the last yeares accompt and\r\n     what shall this yearse growth deue, and that in Comodities\r\n     of the same vallew and goodness as shalbe by him contracted\r\n     for.\"\r\n\r\nAt this period it appears that tobacco was used as money, and as the\r\nmeasure of price and value. The taxes whether public, county, or\r\nparish, were payable in tobacco.\r\n\r\nTatham says, \"Even the tavern keepers were compelled to exchange a\r\ndinner for a few pounds of tobacco.\" The law for the regulation of\r\npayments in tobacco was passed in the year 1640. From these facts and\r\nincidents connected with the culture and commerce of the plant we see\r\nhow intimately it was connected with both Church and State. Jones well\r\nsaid \"the Establishment is indeed tobacco;\" the salary of ministers\r\nwas payable in it according to the wealth of the parish. In most\r\nparishes 16000 lbs. was the yearly amount,\r\n                                           \"and in some 20,000 lbs. of\r\n     Tobacco; out of which there is a deduction for Cask,\r\n     prizing, collecting, and about which allowance there are\r\n     sometimes disputes, as are also differences often about the\r\n     place, time, and manner of delivering it; but all these\r\n     things might easily be regulated. Tobacco is more commonly\r\n     at 20 s. per cent. than at 10; so that certainly it will\r\n     bring 12 s. 8 d. a hundred, which will make 16000 (the least\r\n     salary) amount to 100£ per Ann. which it must certainly\r\n     clear, allowing for all petty charges, out of the lowness of\r\n     the price stated which is less than the medium between ten\r\n     and twenty shillings; whereas it might be stated above the\r\n     medium, since it is oftener at twenty than ten shillings.\r\n     Besides the payment of the salary, the surplice fees want a\r\n     better regulation in the payments; for though the allowance\r\n     be sufficient, yet differences often and illwill arise about\r\n     these fees, whether they are to be paid in money or tobacco,\r\n     and when; whereas by a small alteration and addition of a\r\n     few laws in these and the like respects, the clergy might\r\n     live more happy, peaceable, and better beloved; and the\r\n     people would be more easy, and pay never the more dues.\r\n\r\n     \"Some parts of the country make but mean and poor tobacco so\r\n     that Clergymen don't care to live in such parishes; but\r\n     there the payment might be made in money, or in the produce\r\n     of those places, which might be equivalent to the tobacco\r\n     payments; better for the minister, and as pleasing to the\r\n     people.\"\r\n\r\nWe find further complaints from the London Company of the poor quality\r\nof the tobacco \"sent home,\" in a letter addressed to the Governor,\r\nbearing date 10th June, 1622:--\r\n\r\n     \"The tobacco sent home by the George for the company proved\r\n     very meane and is yett unsold although it hath been offered\r\n     at 3s. the pound. This we thought fitt to advise you\r\n     concerning the quantity and the manner how it is raised, in\r\n     both wich being done contrarie to their directors and\r\n     extreamly to theire prejudice, the Companie is very ill\r\n     sattisfied, will write by the next, more largely.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1620 the difficulties seem first to have been publicly\r\navowed, (though perhaps before felt,) arising from attaching men as\r\npermanent settlers to the colony without an adequate supply of women,\r\nto furnish the comforts of domestic life; and to overcome the\r\ndifficulty \"a hundred young women\" of agreeable persons and\r\nrespectable characters, were selected in England and sent out, at the\r\nexpense of the Company, as wives for the settlers. They were very\r\nspeedily appropriated by the young men of the colony, who paid for the\r\nprivilege of choice considerable sums as purchase money, which went to\r\nreplenish the treasury of the Company, from whence the cost of their\r\noutfit and passage had been defrayed.\r\n\r\nThis speculation proved so advantageous to that body, in a pecuniary\r\nsense, that it was soon followed up by sending out sixty more, for\r\nwhom larger prices were paid than for the first consignment; the\r\namount paid on the average for the first one hundred being 120 pounds\r\nof tobacco apiece for each, then valued at 3s. per lb., and for the\r\nsecond supply of sixty, the average price paid was 150 lbs. of\r\ntobacco, this being the legal currency of the colony, and the standard\r\nvalue by which all contracts, salaries, and prices were paid. In one\r\nof the Companies letters dated in London this 12th of August, 1621, we\r\nfind this account of a portion of the _goods_ sent over in the ship\r\nMarmaduke:--\r\n\r\n     \"We send you in this ship one widdow and eleven maids for\r\n     wives for the people in Virginia; there hath been especiall\r\n     care had in the choise of them for their hath not any one of\r\n     them beene received but upon good comendations, as by a note\r\n     herewith sent you may perceive: we pray you all therefore in\r\n     generall to take them into your care, and most especially we\r\n     recommend them to you, Mr. Pountes, that at their first\r\n     landing they may be housed, lodged and provided for of diet\r\n     till they be marryed for such was the haste of sending them\r\n     away, as that straightned with time, we had no meanes to\r\n     putt provisions aboard, which defect shalbe supplied by the\r\n     magazine shipp; and in case they cannot be presently marryed\r\n     we desire they may be putt to several householders that have\r\n     wives till they can be provided of husbands. There are neare\r\n     fifty more which are shortly to come, we sent by our most\r\n     honoble Lord William the Earle of Southampton and certain\r\n     worthy gentlemen who taking into these considerations, that\r\n     the Plantation can never flourish till families be planted\r\n     and the respect of wives and children fix the people in the\r\n     soil; therefore have given this fair beginning for the\r\n     reimbursing of whose charges, itt is ordered that every man\r\n     that marries them give 120 lb. waight of best leafe tobacco\r\n     for each of them, and in case any of them dye that\r\n     proportion must be advanced to make it upp to those that\r\n     survive; and this certainly is sett down for that the price\r\n     sett upon the bages sent last yeare being 20 lb. which was\r\n     so much money out of purse here, there was returned 66 lb.\r\n     of tobacco only, and that of the worst and basest, so that\r\n     fraight and shrinkage reconed together with the baseness of\r\n     the comoditie there was not one half returned, which injury\r\n     the company is sensible of as they demand restitution, which\r\n     accordingly must be had of them that took uppon them the\r\n     dispose of them the rather that no man may mistake himself,\r\n     in accomptinge tobacco to be currant 3s. sterling contrary\r\n     to express orders.\r\n\r\n     \"And though we are desirous that marriadge be free according\r\n     to the law of nature, yett undervow not to have these maids\r\n     deterred and married to servants, but only to such freemen\r\n     or tenants as have means to maintaine them; we pray you\r\n     therefore to be fathers to them in this business, not\r\n     enforcing them to marrie against their wills; neither send\r\n     we them to be servants, but in case of extremitie, for we\r\n     would have their condition so much better as multitudes may\r\n     be allured thereby to come unto you; and you may assure such\r\n     men as marry those women that the first servants sent over\r\n     by the company shall be consigned to them, it being our\r\n     intent to preserve families and proper married men before\r\n     single persons. The tobacco that shall be due uppon the\r\n     marriadge of these maids we desire Mr. Pountes to receive\r\n     and returne by the first, as also the little quantities of\r\n     Pitzarn Rock and Piece of Oare, the copie of whose bill is\r\n     here returned. To conclude, the company for some weighty\r\n     reasons too long to relate, have ordered that no man\r\n     marrying these women expect the proportion of land usually\r\n     allotted for each head, which to avoid clamor or other\r\n     trouble hereafter you shall do well to give them notice of.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buying wives.]\r\n\r\nIn another letter written by the company and dated London, September\r\n11th, 1621, they write:--\r\n\r\n     \"By this Shipp and Pinace called the Tyger, we also send as\r\n     many maids and young women as will make up the number of\r\n     fifty, with those twelve formerly sent in the Marmaduke,\r\n     which we hope shalbe received with the same Christian pietie\r\n     and charitie as they were sent from hence; the providing for\r\n     them at their first landing and disposing of them in\r\n     marriage (which is our chief intent), we leave to your care\r\n     and wisdom, to take that order as may most conduce to their\r\n     good, and satisfaction of the Adventurers, for the charges\r\n     disbursed in setting them forth, which coming to twelve\r\n     pounds and upwards, they require one hundred and fiftie of\r\n     the best leafe tobacco for each of them; and if any of them\r\n     dye there must be a proportionable addition uppon the rest;\r\n     this increase of thirty pounds is weight since those sent in\r\n     the Marmaduke, they have resolved to make, finding the\r\n     great shrinkage and other losses uppon the tobacco from\r\n     Virginia will not leave lesse, which tobacco as it shalbe\r\n     received, we desire may be delivered to Mr. Ed.

We have used\r\n     extraordinary care and dilligence in the choice of them, and\r\n     have received none of whom we have not had good testimony of\r\n     their honest life and cariadge, which together with their\r\n     names, we send them inclosed for the satisfaction of such as\r\n     shall marry them; for whose further encouragement we desire\r\n     you to give public notice that the next spring we purpose to\r\n     send over as many youths for apprentices to those that shall\r\n     now marry any of them and make us due satisfaction.\r\n\r\n     \"This and theire owne good deserts together with your favor\r\n     and care, will we hope, marry them all unto honest and\r\n     sufficient men, whose means will reach to present repayment;\r\n     but if any of them shall unwarily or fondly bestow herself\r\n     (for the liberty of marriadge we dare not infrindge) uppon\r\n     such as shall not be able to give present sattisfaction, we\r\n     desire that at least as soon as ability shalbe, they be\r\n     compelled to pay the true quantity of tobacco proportioned,\r\n     and that this debt may have precedence of all other to be\r\n     recovered.\r\n\r\n     \"For the rest, which we hope will not be many, we desire\r\n     your best furtherance for providing them fitting services\r\n     till they may happen uppon good matches, and are here\r\n     persuaded by many old planters that there will be good\r\n     maisters now found there, who will readily lay down what\r\n     charges shall be required, uppon assurance of repayment at\r\n     their marriadges, which as just and reasonable we desire may\r\n     be given them. But this and many other things in this\r\n     business we must refer to your good considerations and\r\n     fruitful endeavors in opening a work begun here out of pity,\r\n     and tending so much to the benefitt of the plantation, shall\r\n     not miscarry for any want of good will or care on your\r\n     part.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1622 a monopoly of the importation of tobacco was granted to the\r\nVirginia and Somers Island, companies.\r\n\r\n     \"But now at last it hath pleased God for the confirmation no\r\n     doubt of our hopes and redoubling of our and your courage,\r\n     to incline His Majestie's Royall heart to grant the sole\r\n     importation of Tobacco (a thing long and earnestly desired),\r\n     to the Virginia and Somers Island Companies, and that upon\r\n     such conditions as the private profit of each man is likely\r\n     to be much improved and the general state of the plantation\r\n     strongly secured, while his Majestie's revenue is so closely\r\n     joyned as together with the colonie it must rise and faile,\r\n     grow and impair, and that not a small matter neither, but of\r\n     twenty thousand pounds per annum, (for the offer of so much\r\n     in certainty hath his majestie been pleased to refuse in\r\n     favor of the Plantations).\"\r\n\r\nOn Friday the 22d of March 1622 the Indians attacked the plantations\r\n     \"and attempted in most places under the color of unsuspected\r\n     amytie, and by surprise to have cut us all off and to have\r\n     swept us all away at once throughout the whole lande had itt\r\n     not pleased God of his abundant mercy to prevent them in\r\n     many places, for which we can never sufficient magnifie his\r\n     blessed, name.\"\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding this terrible massacre in which nearly four\r\nhundred persons were slain the colony increased in wealth and numbers\r\nas plantations were laid out and the colonists developed the various\r\nresources of the country. From the first planting of tobacco in\r\nVirginia by the colony it seemed to meet the royal displeasure of King\r\nJames the First who falsely and frivolously sought to establish a\r\nconnection between the balmy plant, and the influences of the Evil\r\nOne.\r\n\r\nIn 1622 King James still opposing the cultivation of tobacco sought by\r\nevery means in his power to discourage its growth and culture. He\r\nurged the growing of mulberry trees and the propagation of silk worms,\r\nas being of more value than tobacco. In a letter dated 10th June 1622,\r\naddressed to the Governor and Council of Virginia by the London\r\nCompany we find this reproof for neglecting the cultivation of\r\n\"mulberrie trees\":\r\n\r\n     \"His Ma{tie} (Majesty) above all things requires from us a\r\n     proof of silke; sharply reproving the neglect thereof,\r\n     wherefore we pray you lett that little stock you have be\r\n     carefully improved, the mulberrie trees preserved and\r\n     increased, and all other fitt preparations made for, God\r\n     willing before Christmas you shall receive from us one\r\n     hundred ounces of Silkworme seed at least, which coming too\r\n     late from Valentia we have been forced to hatch it here.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1623 a letter was prepared for the colony by order of privy council\r\nof the king and addressed to Sir Francis Wyatt Knight and Captain\r\nGeneral of Virginia and to the rest of the Council of State in which\r\nthe colony is admonished to pay more attention to \"Staple\r\nCommodities.\" That part relating to it reads:\r\n\r\n     \"The carefull and diligent prosecution of Staple Commodities\r\n     which we promist; we above all things pray you to performe\r\n     so as we may have speedily the real proof of your cares and\r\n     endeavors therein, especially in that of Iron, of Vines and\r\n     Silk the neglect and delay whereof so long is to us here\r\n     cause of infinit grief and discontent, especially in regard\r\n     of his Majesties just resentment therein that his Royall\r\n     grace and love to the Plantation, which after so long a time\r\n     and long a supply of his Majesties favor hath brought forth\r\n     no better fruit than Tobacco.\r\n\r\n     \"Yett by the goodness of God inclyning his princely heart,\r\n     we have received not only from the Lords of his Privy\r\n     Counsell, but from his Royal mouth such assurance not only\r\n     of his tender love and care but also of his Royal intentions\r\n     for the advancement of the Plantation; that we cannot but\r\n     exceedingly rejoice therein and persuade you with much more\r\n     comfort and encouragement to go on in the building up of his\r\n     Royal worke with all sincerity, care and diligence, and that\r\n     with that perfect love and union amongst yourselves as may\r\n     really demonstrate that your intentions are all one, the\r\n     advancement of God's glorie and the service of his Royall\r\n     Majestie: for the particularities of his Majesties gratious\r\n     intentions for the future good, you may in part understand\r\n     them by the courses appointed by the Lords, whereof we here\r\n     inclosed send the orders.\r\n\r\n     \"And we are further to signifie unto you that the Lords of\r\n     his Majesties Privy Counsell, having by his Majesties order\r\n     taken into their considerations the contract made last\r\n     Sommer by the Company have dissolved the same; and signified\r\n     that his Majestie out of his gracious and Royall intention\r\n     and princely favor to the Plantation hath resolved to grant\r\n     a sole Importion of Tobacco to the two Plantations, with an\r\n     exception only of 40,000 weight of ye best Spanish Tobacco\r\n     to be yearly brought in.\r\n\r\n     \"And it hath also pleased his Majesty in favor of the\r\n     Plantation to reduce ye custom and importing of tobacco to\r\n     9d. per pound: And last of all we are to signifie unto you\r\n     that their Lordships have ordered that all the Tobacco shall\r\n     be brought in from both Plantations as by their Lordship\r\n     order whereof we send you a copy, you may perceive.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1624 King James prohibited the importation of foreign tobacco as\r\nwell as the planting of tobacco in England or Ireland. The following\r\nis a portion of the proclamation:--\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas our commons, in their last sessions of parliament\r\n     became humble petitioners to us, that, for many weighty\r\n     reasons, much concerning the interest of our kingdom, and\r\n     the trade thereof, we would by our royal power utterly\r\n     prohibit the use of all foreign tobacco, which is not of the\r\n     growth of our own dominions: And whereas we have upon all\r\n     occasions made known our dislike we have ever had of the use\r\n     of tobacco in general, as tending to the corruption both of\r\n     the health and manners of our people.\r\n\r\n     \"Nevertheless because we have been often and earnestly\r\n     importuned by many of our loving subjects, planters, and\r\n     adventurers in Virginia and the Somer isles; that, as those\r\n     colonies are yet but in their infancy, and cannot be brought\r\n     to maturity, unless we be pleased, for a time, to tolerate\r\n     unto them the planting and vending of their own growth; we\r\n     have condescended to their desires: and do therefore hereby\r\n     strictly prohibit the importation of any tobacco from beyond\r\n     sea, or from Scotland, into England or Ireland other than\r\n     from our colonies before named; moreover we strictly\r\n     prohibit the planting of any tobacco either in England or\r\n     Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThus King James by Proclamation and Prohibition set his face sternly\r\nagainst the growth and traffic in the plant, which opposition knew no\r\nalteration and continued till his death, which occurred in 1625. James\r\nwas succeeded by his son Charles I. On ascending the throne Charles\r\nmanifested the same hostility towards the plant which his father had.\r\nHe prohibited the importation of all tobacco excepting that grown by\r\nthe colony, and throughout his reign made no change in the restrictive\r\nlaws against its growth and sale. He continued its sale, however, as a\r\nkingly monopoly, allowing only those to engage in it who paid him for\r\nthe privilege. The Company had now raised a capital of two hundred\r\nthousand pounds, but falling into dispute and disagreeing one with\r\nanother, Charles thought best to establish a royal government.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he dissolved the Company in 1626,\r\n                                              \"reducing the Country\r\n     and Government into his own immediate ordering all patents\r\n     and processes to issue in his own name, reserving to himself\r\n     a quit-rent of two shillings for every hundred acres of\r\n     land.\"\r\n\r\nThe first act was by proclamation as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"That whereas, in his royal father's time, the charter of\r\n     the Virginia Company was by a quo warranto annulled; and\r\n     whereas his said father was, and he himself also is, of\r\n     opinion, that the government of that Colony by a company\r\n     incorporated, consisting of a multitude of persons of\r\n     various dispositions, amongst whom affairs of the greatest\r\n     moment are ruled by a majority of votes, was not so proper,\r\n     for carrying on, prosperously, the affairs of the colony;\r\n     wherefore, to reduce the government thereof to such a course\r\n     as might best agree with that form which was held in his\r\n     royal monarchy; and considering also, that we hold those\r\n     territories of Virginia and Somer isles, as also that of New\r\n     England, lately planted, with the limits thereof, to be a\r\n     part of our royal empire; we ordain that the government of\r\n     Virginia shall immediately depend on ourself, and not be\r\n     committed to any company or corporation, to whom it may be\r\n     proper to trust matters of trade and commerce, but cannot be\r\n     fit to commit the ordering of state affairs.\r\n\r\n     \"Wherefore our commissioners for those affairs shall proceed\r\n     as directed, till we establish a council here for that\r\n     colony; to be subordinate to our council here for that\r\n     colony. And at our charge we will maintain those public\r\n     officers and ministers and that strength of men, munition,\r\n     and fortification, which shall be necessary for the defence\r\n     of that plantation. And we will also settle and assure the\r\n     particular rights and interests of every planter and\r\n     adventurer. Lastly, whereas the tobacco of those plantations\r\n     (the only present means of their subsisting) cannot be\r\n     managed for the good of the plantations, unless it be\r\n     brought into one hand, whereby the foreign tobacco of those\r\n     plantations may yield a certain and ready price to the\r\n     owners thereof: to avoid all differences between the\r\n     planters and adventurers themselves, we resolve to take the\r\n     same into our own hands, and to give such prices for the\r\n     same as may give reasonable satisfaction, whereof we will\r\n     determine at better leisure.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the Plantation seemed to prosper, Charles\r\ngranted lands to all the planters and adventurers who would till them,\r\nupon paying the annual sum of two shillings payable to the crown for\r\neach hundred acres. Before the death of King James, however, the\r\ncultivation of tobacco had become so extensive that every other\r\nproduct seemed of but little value in comparison with it, and the\r\nprice realized from its sale being so much greater than that obtained\r\nfor \"Corne,\" the latter was neglected and its culture almost entirely\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nArthur and Carpenter, in their History of Virginia, give a graphic and\r\ntruthful picture of its cultivation during the reign of King James:--\r\n\r\n     \"The first articles of commerce to the production of which\r\n     the early settlers almost exclusively devoted themselves,\r\n     were potash, soap, glass and tar. Distance, however, and a\r\n     want of the proper facilities to enable them to manufacture\r\n     cheaply, rendered the cost of these commodities so great,\r\n     that exports of a similar character from Russia and Sweden\r\n     were still enabled to maintain their old ascendency in the\r\n     markets of Europe. After many fruitless and costly\r\n     experiments in the cultivation of the vine, the growing\r\n     demand for tobacco enabled the planters to turn their labor\r\n     into a profitable channel. As the demand increased the\r\n     profits became correspondingly great, and every other\r\n     species of labor was abandoned for the cultivation of\r\n     tobacco.\r\n\r\n     \"The houses were neglected, the palisades suffered to rot\r\n     down, the fields, gardens and public squares, even the very\r\n     streets of Jamestown were planted with tobacco. The\r\n     townspeople, more greedy of gain than mindful of their own\r\n     security, scattered abroad into the wilderness, where they\r\n     broke up small pieces of rich ground and made their crop\r\n     regardless of their proximity to the Indians, in whose good\r\n     faith so little reliance could be placed.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Charles I. many families of respectable connection\r\njoined the colony, and from this time forward the colony increased in\r\nwealth as well as numbers. King Charles, to use the language of\r\nanother, had now commenced \"as a tobacco merchant and monopolist,\" and\r\nin 1627 issued a proclamation renewing his already strong monopoly\r\nmore effectually, by appointing certain officers of London\r\n                                                           \"to seize\r\n     all foreign tobacco, not of the growth of Virginia or\r\n     Bermudas, for his benefit, agreeable to a former commission:\r\n     also to buy up for his use all the tobacco coming from our\r\n     said plantations, and to sell the same again for his\r\n     benefit.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Growing tobacco in the streets.]\r\n\r\nAgain in 1630 King Charles issued another proclamation, and among\r\nother restrictions limited the importation of it from the colony.\r\nQuickly following this the King issued in 1632 another proclamation\r\nregulating the retailing of tobacco. In 1634 he also prohibited the\r\nlanding of tobacco any where except at the quay near the custom house\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nIn 1636 Charles appointed Sir John Harvey to be continued governor of\r\nthe Plantation. In 1643 parliament laid a tax for the year 1644,\r\ncalling it Excise, and also laid a duty of four shillings per pound on\r\nforeign, and two shillings per pound on English tobacco. From what has\r\nalready been written, it will be seen that both King James and his son\r\nCharles I. enacted the most stringent laws against its importation,\r\nnearly suppressing the trade, which caused the English farmers to\r\ncultivate it for home use; but another law was now added to suppress\r\nits growth on English soil.\r\n\r\nFairholt in speaking of the hostility of King James to the plant says:\r\n\r\n     \"When Kings make unnecessary and unjust laws, subjects\r\n     naturally study how to evade them: it is a mere system of\r\n     self-defence; and as James nearly suppressed the importation\r\n     of tobacco the English began to grow it on their own land.\r\n     But the Scottish Solomon who was on the alert, added another\r\n     law restraining its cultivation 'to misuse and misemploy the\r\n     soil of this fruitful Kingdom.' As this enforced the trade\r\n     with the English colony of Virginia alone, it was soon found\r\n     that Spanish and Portuguese tobacco might be brought into\r\n     port on the payment of the old duty of twopence a pound;\r\n     thus a large trade was carried on with their planters to the\r\n     injury of the British colonists.\r\n\r\n     \"Its use increased in spite of all legislative laws and\r\n     enactments and James ended by prohibiting any person from\r\n     dealing in the article who did not hold his letters patent.\r\n     By this means the trade was monopolized, the consumers\r\n     oppressed, importation diminished, and the London Company of\r\n     Virginia traders ultimately ruined. Those who are fond of\r\n     excusing the evil acts of one of the worst of English Kings,\r\n     pretend to see James' care for his subjects' health and\r\n     wealth in these restrictions, totally regardless of the fact\r\n     that James cared for neither when the monopoly brought large\r\n     sums into his own pocket.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1632 Charles I. granted to Sir George Calvert (who about this time\r\nwas made Lord Baltimore) the territory now known as Maryland; soon\r\nafter receiving the grant he died, when his son took the grant in his\r\nown name. The next year he sailed from England with two hundred\r\npersons and settled in his new possessions. The colony from the first,\r\nprospered far better than the colony of Virginia and soon laid the\r\nfoundation of a strong and substantial government. Like the Virginians\r\nthey soon engaged in the cultivation of tobacco which seemed as well\r\nadapted to the soil as the other products, corn and English wheat. The\r\nIndians were found here as in the Plantation of Virginia planting\r\ntobacco as they did Indian corn and cultivating little patches of it\r\nnear their wigwams choosing the most fertile soil the females of the\r\ntribe being the actual cultivators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Natives growing tobacco.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward both colonies developed into strong and\r\nflourishing plantations and with each succeeding year increased the\r\ncultivation of tobacco which had now become more extensively\r\ncultivated than all the other products combined. Its culture however\r\nwas looked upon with the same disapproval by Charles II. who confirmed\r\nthe old laws against its sale and cultivation. But notwithstanding the\r\nremonstrances of the Stuarts the plant grew in use and favor and could\r\nnot be uprooted even by a kingly hand. The early cultivators of the\r\nplant received a fresh impetus from the importation of a new species\r\nof labor in the form of Negro slaves brought from the West India\r\nislands. They arrived in the Ship Treasurer \"being manned by the best\r\nmen of the colony who set out on roving in ye Spanish dominions in the\r\nWest Indies\" and after a successful cruise against the Spaniards\r\nreturned with their spoils including a certain number of Negroes.\r\nRolfe in alluding to the importation of Negroes says:\r\n\r\n     \"About the last of August came in, a Dutch man-of-warre that\r\n     sold us twenty negars.\"\r\n\r\nMost writers are of the opinion that this was in 1620, one of whom\r\nsays \"in the same year that the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, slaves\r\nlanded in Virginia.\" Another writer says of the introduction of slave\r\nlabor into the Plantations,\r\n                            \"Is there not a probability that the\r\n     vessel was under control of Argall, if not the ship\r\n     Treasurer? If twenty negroes came in 1619, as alleged, their\r\n     increase was very slow, for according to a census of 16th of\r\n     February, 1624, there were but twenty-two then in the\r\n     colony, distributed as follows: eleven at Flourdiew Hundred,\r\n     three at James City, one at James Island, one at the\r\n     plantation opposite James City, four at Warisquoyok, and two\r\n     at Elizabeth City.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that \"negars\" landed in the colony, commenced the\r\narrival of starving boys and girls picked up out of the streets of\r\nLondon. The \"negars\" are described as follows by an early writer of\r\nthe colony.\r\n            \"The negroes live in small cottages called quarters, in\r\n     about six in a gang, under the direction or an overseer or\r\n     baliff; who takes care that they tend such land as the owner\r\n     allots and orders, upon which they raise Hogs and Cattle,\r\n     plant Indian Corn (or maize) and Tobacco for the use of\r\n     their Master; out of which the overseer has a dividend (or\r\n     share) in proportion to the number of hands including\r\n     himself; this with several privileges in his salary, and is\r\n     an ample recompense for his pains, and encouragement of his\r\n     industrious care, as to the labor, health, and provision of\r\n     the negroes. The negroes are very numerous, some gentlemen\r\n     having hundreds of them of all sorts, to whom they bring\r\n     great profit; for the sake of which they are obliged to keep\r\n     them well, and not overwork, starve, or famish them, besides\r\n     other inducements to favor them, which is done in a great\r\n     degree, to such especially that are laborious, careful, and\r\n     honest; though indeed some Masters, careless of their own\r\n     interest and reputation, are too cruel and negligent.\r\n\r\n     \"The negroes are not only increased by fresh supplies from\r\n     Africa and the West India Islands, but also are very\r\n     prolific among themselves; and they that are born there talk\r\n     good English, and effect our language, habits, and customs;\r\n     and tho' they be naturally of a barbarous and cruel temper,\r\n     yet are they kept under by severe discipline upon occasion,\r\n     and by good laws are prevented from running away, injuring\r\n     the English or neglecting their business. Their work (or\r\n     chimerical hard slavery) is not very laborious; their\r\n     greatest hardship consisting in that they and their\r\n     posterity are not at their own liberty or disposal, but are\r\n     the property of their owners; and when they are free they\r\n     know not how to provide so well for themselves generally;\r\n     neither did they live so plentifully nor (many of them) so\r\n     easily in their own country where they are made slaves to\r\n     one another, or taken captive by their enemies. Their work\r\n     is to take care of the stock, and plant Corn, Tobacco,\r\n     Fruits and which is not harder than thrashing, hedging, or\r\n     ditching; besides, though they are out in the violent heat,\r\n     wherein they delight, yet in wet or cold weather there is\r\n     little occasion for their working in the fields, in which\r\n     few will let them be abroad, lest by this means they might\r\n     get sick or die, which would prove a great loss to their\r\n     owners, a good Negroe being sometimes worth three (nay four)\r\n     score pounds sterling, if he be a tradesmen; so that upon\r\n     this (if upon no other account) they are obliged not to\r\n     overwork them, but to clooth and feed them sufficiently, and\r\n     take care of their health.\"\r\n\r\nThe planters, supplied with greater facilities for the work, now\r\nincreased the size of their tobacco plantations, \"taking up new\r\nground\" (clearing the land) and planting a much larger area. The first\r\nexportation of the colony's tobacco was brought into competition with\r\nthat of much finer flavor, which had acquired an established\r\nreputation long before the English began the culture of the plant in\r\nthe New World. The Spanish, Dutch and Portuguese had long monopolized\r\nits culture and trade, and brought from St. Domingo, Jamaica, St.\r\nThomas, the Philippine Islands, West Florida, and various parts of\r\nSouth America, several varieties of tobacco of excellent quality, and\r\nwhich sold at an exorbitant price. On testing the tobacco grown by the\r\nLondon and Plymouth companies it was found to be sweet and mild in\r\nflavor, of a light color, and well adapted for smoking. On its first\r\nintroduction into England it sold for 3s. per pound, but as its\r\nculture increased the price lessened, until it was sold at one-half\r\nthis amount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Destroying suckers.]\r\n\r\nThe planters, who at first cultivated small patches, now planted large\r\nfields of tobacco, and such was the greed for gain that some planters\r\ngathered a second crop upon the same field from the suckers left\r\ngrowing upon the parent stalk. Tatham[16] says in regard to it:--\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 16: Essay on Tobacco, London, 1800.]\r\n\r\n     \"It has been customary in former ages to rear an inferior\r\n     plant from the sucker which projects from the root after the\r\n     cutting of an early plant; and thus a second crop has often\r\n     been obtained from the same field by one and the same course\r\n     of culture; and although this scion is of a sufficient\r\n     quality for smoking, and might become preferred in the\r\n     weaker kinds of snuff, it has been (I think very properly)\r\n     thought eligible to prefer a prohibitory law, to a risk of\r\n     imposition by means of similitude. The practice of\r\n     cultivating suckers is on these accounts not only\r\n     discountenanced as fraudulent, but the constables are\r\n     strictly enjoyned _ex officio_ to make diligent search, and\r\n     to employ the _posse commitatus_ in destroying such crops; a\r\n     law indeed for which, to the credit of the Virginians, there\r\n     is seldom occasion; yet some few instances have occurred,\r\n     within my day, where the constables have very honorably\r\n     carried it into execution in a manner truly exemplary, and\r\n     productive of public good.\"\r\n\r\nFairholt says of the same subject:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was sometimes the custom with planters to reset the\r\n     suckers, and thus grow a double crop on one field, such\r\n     conduct was disallowed; for the reason that the crop was\r\n     inferior, and the more honest grower, who conscientiously\r\n     cleared his plants, and gave them abundance of room to grow,\r\n     was dishonestly competed with; and the first rate character\r\n     of the Virginian crop prejudiced by the action.\"\r\n\r\nFairholt makes a mistake in speaking of the planter as re-setting the\r\nsuckers, and his statement shows him to be entirely unacquainted with\r\nthe habits of the plant. As soon as the plants are harvested, the\r\nstump of the plant remaining in the ground puts forth one or more\r\nvigorous suckers or shoots, which often in a good season grow almost\r\nas high as the parent stalk. In some tobacco-growing sections one or\r\ntwo crops of suckers are gathered besides the first crop.\r\n\r\nThe Creole planters in Louisiana are said to grow three crops in this\r\nmanner, the first or parent crop and two growths of suckers. The\r\nquality of leaf, however, is greatly inferior, as it is small and thin\r\nand lacking in all the qualities necessary for a fine leaf. The\r\nplanters now adopted new methods of culture, and cultivated several\r\nspecies of the plant known as Oronoko and little Frederick, although\r\nthey did not fertilize the fields, even when the soil became\r\nimpoverished, but simply took new fields for its culture.\r\n\r\nHugh Jones says of the kinds of tobacco grown in Virginia:--\r\n\r\n     \"The land between the James and York rivers seemes nicely\r\n     adapted for sweet scented tobacco; for 'tis observed that\r\n     the goodness decreaseth the farther you go to the northward\r\n     of the one, and the southward of the other; but this may be\r\n     (I believe) attributed in some measure to the seed and\r\n     management, as well as to the land and latitude: For on York\r\n     river in a small tract of land called Diggens neck, which is\r\n     poorer than a great deal of other land in the same latitude,\r\n     by a particular seed and management, is made the famous crop\r\n     known by the name of E Dees, remarkable for its mild taste\r\n     and fine smell.\" He speaks of the planters and their\r\n     plantations as follows:--\"Neither the interests nor\r\n     inclinations of the Virginians induces them to cohabit in\r\n     towns: so that they are not forward in contributing their\r\n     assistance towards the making of particular places, every\r\n     plantation affording the owner the provision of a little\r\n     market; wherefore they most commonly build upon some\r\n     convenient spot or neck of land in their own plantation,\r\n     though towns are laid out and established in each county.\r\n\r\n     \"The whole country is a perfect forest, except where the\r\n     woods are cleared for plantations, and old fields, and where\r\n     have been formerly Indian towns, and poisoned fields and\r\n     meadows, where the timber has been burnt down in fire\r\n     hunting and otherwise; and about the creeks and rivers are\r\n     large rank morasses or marshes, and up the country are poor\r\n     savannahs. The gentlemen's seats are of late built for the\r\n     most part of good brick, and many of timber very handsome,\r\n     commodious, and capacious; and likewise the common planters\r\n     live in pretty timber houses, neater than the farm houses\r\n     are generally in England: With timber also are built houses\r\n     for the overseers and out-houses; among which is the kitchen\r\n     apart from the dwelling house, because of the smell of hot\r\n     victuals, offensive in hot weather.\r\n\r\n     \"The habits, life, customs, computations of the Virginians,\r\n     are much the same as about London, which they esteem their\r\n     home; and for the most part have contemptible notions of\r\n     England, and wrong sentiments of Bristol, and the other\r\n     out-posts, which they entertain from seeing and hearing the\r\n     common dealers, sailors, and servants that come from those\r\n     towns, and the country places in England and Scotland, whose\r\n     language and manners are strange to them; for the planters\r\n     and even the native negroes generally talk good English\r\n     without idiom and tone, and can discourse handsomely upon\r\n     most common subjects: and conversing with persons belonging\r\n     to trade and navigation from London, for the most part they\r\n     are much civilized, and wear the best of clothes according\r\n     to their station; nay, sometimes too good for their\r\n     circumstances, being for the generality, comely handsome\r\n     persons of good features and fine complexions (if they take\r\n     care) of good manners and address.\r\n\r\n     \"They are not very easily persuaded to the improvement of\r\n     useful inventions (except a few, such as sawing mills)\r\n     neither are they great encouragers of manufactures, because\r\n     of the trouble and certain expense in attempts of this kind,\r\n     with uncertain prospect of gain; whereas by their staple\r\n     commodity, tobacco, they are certain to get a plentiful\r\n     provision; nay, often very great estates. Upon this account\r\n     they think it folly to take off their hands (or negroes) and\r\n     employ their care and time about anything that may make\r\n     them lessen their crop of tobacco. So that though they are\r\n     apt to learn, yet they are fond of and will follow their own\r\n     ways, humors and notions, being not easily brought to new\r\n     projects and schemes; so that I question if they would have\r\n     been improved upon by the Mississippi or South sea, or any\r\n     other such monstrous bubbles. The common planters leading\r\n     easy lives without much labor, or any manly exercise, except\r\n     horse-racing, nor diversion, except cock-fighting, in which\r\n     some greatly delight.\r\n\r\n     \"This easy way of living, and the heat of the summer, makes\r\n     some very lazy, who are then said to be climate-struck. They\r\n     are such lovers of riding, that almost every ordinary person\r\n     keeps a horse; and I have known some spend the morning in\r\n     ranging several miles in the woods to find and catch their\r\n     horses to ride only two or three miles to the Church, to the\r\n     Court-House or to a Horse-Race, where they generally appoint\r\n     to meet upon business; and are more certain of finding those\r\n     that they want to speak or deal with, than at their home. No\r\n     people can entertain their friends with better cheer and\r\n     welcome; and stranger and traveler is here treated in the\r\n     most free, plentiful, and hospitable manner; so that a few\r\n     Inns or Ordinaries on the road are sufficient.\"\r\n\r\nThis is no doubt a correct picture of the early planters of Virginia.\r\nMany of them became the owners of large plantations and all those who\r\nwere successful growers of tobacco became wealthy in proportion to the\r\nquality of leaf produced.\r\n\r\nThe merchants, factors or store-keepers bought up the tobacco of the\r\nplanters paying in goods or \"current Spanish money, or with sterling\r\nbills payable in Great Britain.\" At first the cultivation of tobacco\r\nby the colony was confined to Jamestown and the immediate vicinity,\r\nbut as the colony increased and the country became more densely\r\npopulated, plantations were laid out in the various counties and a\r\nlarge quantity was produced some ways from the great center Jamestown;\r\naccordingly various methods were adopted to get the tobacco to market,\r\nsome of which was sent by boats or canoes down the rivers, while some\r\nwas conveyed in carts and wagons while another method was by rolling\r\nin hoops.\r\n\r\nTatham in his interesting work on tobacco, gives the following\r\ndescription of the method:\r\n\r\n     \"I believe rolling tobacco the distance of many hundred\r\n     miles, is a mode of conveyance peculiar to Virginia; and for\r\n     which the early population of that country deserve a very\r\n     handsome credit. Necessity (that very prolific mother of\r\n     invention), first suggested the idea of rolling by hand;\r\n     time and experience have led to the introduction of horses,\r\n     and have ripened human skill, in this kind of carriage, to a\r\n     decree of perfection which merits the adoption of the mother\r\n     country, but which will be better explained under the next\r\n     head of this subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carrying tobacco to market.]\r\n\r\n     \"The hogsheads, which are designed to be rolled in common\r\n     hoops, are made closer in the joints than if they were\r\n     intended for the wagon; and are plentifully hooped with\r\n     strong hickory hoops (which is the toughest kind of wood),\r\n     with the bark upon them, which remains for some distance a\r\n     protection against the stones. Two hickory saplings are\r\n     affixed to the hogshead, for shafts by boring an auger-hole\r\n     through them to receive the gudgeons or pivots, in the\r\n     manner of a field rolling-stone; and these receive pins of\r\n     wood, square tapered points, which are admitted through\r\n     square mortises made central in the heading, and driven a\r\n     considerable depth into the solid tobacco. Upon the hind\r\n     part of these shafts, between the horses and the hogshead, a\r\n     few light planks are nailed, and a kind of little cart body\r\n     is constructed of a sufficient size to contain a bag or two\r\n     of provender and provision, together with an axe, and such\r\n     other tools as may be needed upon the road, in case of\r\n     accident. In this manner they set out to the inspection in\r\n     companies, very often joining society with the wagons, and\r\n     always pursuing the same method of encamping.\"\r\n\r\nThe methods of making the plant bed, cultivating and harvesting, by\r\nthe early planters may be interesting to all growers of the plant and\r\nare here described as showing the progress made in cutting tobacco\r\nfrom that time until now.\r\n\r\n     \"In spring red seed, in preference to the white, is put into\r\n     a clean pot; milk or stale beer is poured upon it, and it is\r\n     left for two or three days in this state; it is then mixed\r\n     with a quantity of fine fat earth, and set aside in a hot\r\n     chamber, till the seeds begin to put out shoots. They are\r\n     then sown in a hot-bed. When the young plants have grown to\r\n     a finger's length, they are taken up between the fifteenth\r\n     and twenty-second of May, and planted in ground that has\r\n     been previously well manured with the dung of doves or\r\n     swine. They are placed at square distances of one and a\r\n     half-foot from one another. In dry weather, they are now to\r\n     be watered with lukewarm water softly showered upon them,\r\n     between sunset and twilight. When these plants are full two\r\n     feet high, the top of the stems are broken off, to make the\r\n     leaves grow thicker and broader. Here and there are left a\r\n     few plants without having their tops broken off, in order\r\n     that they may afford seeds for another year. Throughout the\r\n     summer the other plants are from time to time, pruned at the\r\n     top, and the whole field is carefully weeded to make the\r\n     growth of the leaf so much the more vigorous.\r\n\r\n     \"In the month of September, from the sixteenth day, and\r\n     between the hours of ten in the morning and four in the\r\n     afternoon, the best leaves are to be taken off. It is more\r\n     advantageous to pluck the leaves when they are dry than when\r\n     they are moist. When plucked they are to be immediately\r\n     brought home, and hung upon cords within the house to dry,\r\n     in as full exposure as is possible to the influence of the\r\n     sun and air; but so as to receive no rain. In this exposure\r\n     they remain till the months of March and April following;\r\n     when they are to be put up in bundles, and conveyed to the\r\n     store-house, in which they may be kept, that they may be\r\n     there till more perfectly dried by a moderate heat. Within\r\n     eight days they must be removed to a different place, where\r\n     they are to be sparingly sprinkled with salt water, and left\r\n     till the leaves shall be no longer warm to the feeling of\r\n     the hand. A barrel of water with six handfuls of salt are\r\n     the proportions. After all this the tobacco leaves may be\r\n     laid aside for commercial exportation. They will remain\r\n     fresh for three years.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Enriching plant-bed.]\r\n\r\nIn Maryland they formerly prepared the land for a plant-bed by burning\r\nupon it a great quantity of brush-wood, afterwards raking the surface\r\nfine; the seed was then sowed broadcast. The young plants were kept\r\nfree from weeds, and were transplanted when about two inches high. The\r\ncultivation of tobacco gradually spread from one State to another.\r\nFrom Virginia it was introduced into North Carolina and Maryland and\r\nfinally Kentucky which is now the largest producing tobacco State in\r\nthe Union. The demand for Virginia tobacco continued to increase and\r\nlong before the Revolutionary war, Virginia exported annually\r\nthousands of hogsheads of leaf tobacco. Half a century ago the plant\r\nbegan to be cultivated in Ohio and from the first grew remarkably\r\nwell, producing a leaf adapted for both cutting and cigar purposes.\r\n\r\nTobacco was planted in New Netherland (New York) by the early Dutch\r\nsettlers and in 1638 \"had become a staple production.\" In 1639 \"from\r\nVirginia numbers of persons whose terms of service had expired, were\r\nattracted to Manhattan, where they introduced improved modes of\r\ncultivating tobacco.\" Van Twiller was himself a grower of the plant\r\nand had his tobacco farm at Greenwich. Soon after its cultivation\r\nbegan it was subjected to Excise; and regulations were published to\r\ncheck the abuses which injured \"the high name\" it had gained in\r\nforeign countries.[17]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 17: Jacob van Churler and David Provoost were\r\n              appointed inspectors of the new staple tobacco. \"In 1652\r\n              the commonalty at Manhattan was informed that, to show\r\n              their good intentions, the Amsterdam directors had\r\n              determined to take off the export duty of tobacco.\"]\r\n\r\nWailes says of the early cultivation of tobacco in Mississippi:\r\n\r\n     \"When the country came under the dominion of Spain, a market\r\n     was opened in New Orleans; a trade in tobacco was\r\n     established, and a fixed and remunerating price was paid for\r\n     it, delivered at the king's warehouses. Tobacco thus became\r\n     the first marketable staple production of Mississippi.\"[18]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 18: In 1783 Mr. Wm. Dunbar writes: \"The soil\r\n              of Natchez is particularly favorable for tobacco and\r\n              there are overseers there, who will almost engage to\r\n              produce you between two and three hogsheads to the hand\r\n              besides provisions.\"]\r\n\r\nAn English writer has the following account of the culture of tobacco\r\nin Louisiana by the French:\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco is another plant indigenous to this part of\r\n     America; the French colonists cultivated it with such\r\n     success that had they received any encouragement from their\r\n     government they might soon have rivalled Virginia and\r\n     Maryland; but instead of this they were taxed heavily for\r\n     cultivating it, by duties laid on the trade; what they\r\n     produced was of so excellent a quality, as to sell some at\r\n     five shillings a pound. There is one advantage in this\r\n     culture here which ought not to be forgotten; in Louisiana\r\n     the French planters after the tobacco is cut, weeded and\r\n     cleaned the ground on which it grew the roots, push forth\r\n     fresh shoots, which are managed in the same manner as the\r\n     first crop. By this means a second crop is made on the same\r\n     ground, and sometimes a third. These seconds indeed, as they\r\n     are called, do not usually grow so high as the first plant,\r\n     but notwithstanding they make very good tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of the Stuarts, the plant was first cultivated in New\r\nEngland but only in small quantities[19] and used solely for smoking.\r\nAbout 1835 the plant received more attention from the farmers living\r\nin the Connecticut valley containing some of the finest tobacco land\r\nin the country. They found by repeated trials that the soil was well\r\nadapted to the production of a finer leaf tobacco than any they had\r\never seen. At this time Kentucky and Havana tobacco were used in the\r\nmanufacture of cigars, but on testing American tobacco or as it is now\r\nknown \"Connecticut seed leaf\" it was found to make the finest wrappers\r\nyet produced, and consequently the best looking cigars. From that time\r\nits reputation has kept pace with its cultivation, until it now enjoys\r\na world wide popularity. As a wrapping tobacco it towers far above the\r\nseed products of other states and can never have a successful\r\ncompetitor in the other varieties now cultivated in the Middle and\r\nWestern States. Doubtless America furnishes the finest varieties of\r\nthe plant now cultivated, suited for all kinds of manufacturing, and\r\nadapted to all the various forms in which it is used.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 19: \"Every farmer plants a quantity of tobacco\r\n              near his house in proportion to the size of his family.\r\n              It is likewise very necessary that they should plant\r\n              tobacco, because it is so universally smoked by the\r\n              common people,\"--_Kalm's travels in North America_,\r\n              1772.]\r\n\r\nThe great diversity of soil and climate renders this probable while\r\nactual experiments and improved methods of culture have demonstrated\r\nit to a certainty. Thousands of hogsheads, cases, and bales are\r\nannually shipped to all parts of the world and the demand for American\r\ntobacco is greater than for the varieties grown in the Old World. More\r\nthan two hundred and fifty years have passed since the London and\r\nPlymouth Companies began its cultivation in the Old Dominion, and on\r\nthe same soil where the red man grew his \"uppowac.\" Virginia leaf\r\nstill continues to flourish, and to-day it is the great agricultural\r\nproduct of the State.\r\n\r\nFrom a small beginning, like the plant itself it has developed into a\r\ngreat and increasing industry and its culture become a source of\r\nwealth unprecedented in agricultural history. Could the sapient James\r\nI. and his successors the Stuarts, now look upon this cherished\r\nproduction of the world, they would discover a commercial prosperity\r\nconnected with those nations which have fostered and encouraged its\r\ngrowth far in advance of those who have frowned upon the plant and\r\nprohibited or hindered its cultivation. Saint Pierre alluding to the\r\nbeneficence of nature and of the folly and cruelty of man as\r\ncontrasted says:\r\n\r\n     \"When the princes of Europe went Gospel in hand, to lay\r\n     waste Asia, they brought back the plague, the leprosy and\r\n     the small-pox, but nature showed to a Dervish the coffee\r\n     tree in the mountains of Yemen, and at the moment when\r\n     nature brought curses on us through the Crusaders, it\r\n     brought delights to us through the cup of a Mohammedan Monk.\r\n     The descendants of those princes took possession of America,\r\n     and transmitted to us by this conquest, an inexhaustible\r\n     succession of wars and maladies. While they were\r\n     exterminating the inhabitants of America with cannon, a\r\n     Carib invited sailors to smoke his Calumet as a signal of\r\n     peace. The perfume of the tobacco vanquished their torments\r\n     and their troubles, and the use of tobacco was spread all\r\n     over the earth. While the afflictions of the two worlds came\r\n     from artillery, which kings call their last resort, the\r\n     consolations of civilized nations flowed from the pipe of a\r\n     savage.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shipping tobacco.]\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly possible to draw a more graphic picture of the\r\nblessings diffused by the balmy plant, than that just given. Its\r\npeculiar charms and soothing influence are well calculated to\r\ninspire in the breast of man, feelings of peace and happiness, rather\r\nthan elements of discord and strife. The pipe of a king burns not more\r\nfreely the shreds of the plant, than it does the last remnant of\r\nhostile feelings and the recollections of bitter wrongs; while the\r\nsnuff-box of the diplomat contains the precious dust that has soothed\r\nthe fierce hatred of rival houses and cemented the divided factions of\r\na tottering throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the tobacco plant in America by European voyagers\r\naroused their cupidity no less than their curiosity. They saw in its\r\nuse by the Indians a custom which, if engrafted upon the civilization\r\nof the Old World, would prove a source of revenue commensurate with\r\ntheir wildest visions of power and wealth. This was particularly the\r\ncase with the Spanish and Portuguese conquerors, whose thirst for gold\r\nwas gratified by its discovery. The finding by the Spaniards of gold,\r\nsilver, and the balmy plant, and by the Portuguese of valuable and\r\nglittering gems, opened up to Spain and Portugal three great sources\r\nof wealth and power. But while the Spaniards were the first\r\ndiscoverers of the plant there seems to be conflicting opinions as to\r\nwhich nation first began its culture, and whether the plant was\r\ncultivated first in the Old World or in the New. Humboldt says:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was neither from Virginia nor from South America, but\r\n     from the Mexican province of Yucatan that Europe received\r\n     the first tobacco seeds about the year 1559.[20] The\r\n     Spaniards became acquainted with tobacco in the West India\r\n     Islands at the end of the 15th Century, and the cultivation\r\n     of Tobacco preceded the cultivation of the potato in Europe\r\n     more than one hundred and twenty years. When Sir Walter\r\n     Raleigh brought tobacco from Virginia to England in 1586,\r\n     whole fields of it were already cultivated in Portugal.[21]\r\n     It was also previously known in France.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 20: Mussey in his Essay on Tobacco records\r\n              \"That Cortez sent a specimen of the plant to the king of\r\n              Spain in 1519.\" Yucatan was discovered by Hernandez\r\n              Cordova in 1517, and in 1519 was first settled.]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 21: Spain began its culture in Mexico on the\r\n              coast of Caracas at the islands of St. Domingo and\r\n              Trinidad, and particularly in Louisiana.]\r\n\r\nAnother author says of its introduction into Europe:--\r\n\r\n     \"The seeds of the tobacco plant were first brought to Europe\r\n     by Gonzalo Hernandez de Oviedo, who introduced it into\r\n     Spain, where it was first cultivated as an ornamental plant,\r\n     till Monardes[22] extolled it as possessed of medicinal\r\n     virtues.\"[23]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 22: Pourchat declares that the Portuguese\r\n              brought it into Europe from Tobago, an island in the\r\n              West Indies; but this is hardly probable, as the island\r\n              was never under the Portuguese dominion.]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 23: Monardes wrote upon it only from the small\r\n              account he had of it from the Brazilians.]\r\n\r\nMurray says of the first cultivation of tobacco and potatoes in the\r\nOld World:--\r\n\r\n     \"Amidst the numerous remarkable productions ushered into the\r\n     Old Continent from the New World, there are two which stand\r\n     pre-eminently conspicuous from their general adoption.\r\n     Unlike in their nature, both have been received as extensive\r\n     blessings--the one by its nutritive powers tends to support,\r\n     the other by its narcotic virtues to soothe and comfort the\r\n     human frame--the potato and tobacco; but very different was\r\n     the favor with which these plants were viewed. The one long\r\n     rejected, by the slow operation of time, and, perhaps, of\r\n     necessity, was at length cherished, and has become the\r\n     support of millions, but nearly one hundred and twenty years\r\n     passed away before even a trial of its merits was attempted;\r\n     whereas, the tobacco from Yucatan, in less than seventy\r\n     years after the discovery, appears to have been extensively\r\n     cultivated in Portugal, and is, perhaps, the most generally\r\n     adopted superfluous vegetable product known; for sugar and\r\n     opium are not in such common use. The potato by the starch\r\n     satisfies the hunger; the tobacco by its morphia calms its\r\n     turbulence of the mind. The former becomes a necessity\r\n     required, the latter a gratification sought for.\"\r\n\r\nIt would appear then that the year 1559 was about the period of the\r\nintroduction of tobacco into Europe. Phillip II. of Spain sent Oviedo\r\nto visit Mexico and note its productions and resources; returning he\r\npresented \"His Most Catholic Majesty\" with the seeds of the plant. In\r\nthe following year it was introduced into France and Italy. It was\r\nfirst brought to France by Jean Nicot of Nismes in Languedoc, who was\r\nsent as ambassador to Sebastian, King of Portugal, and who obtained\r\nwhile at Lisbon some tobacco seed from a Dutch merchant who had\r\nbrought it from Florida.[24] Nicot returned to France in 1561, and\r\npresented the Queen, Catherine de Medicis, with a few leaves of the\r\nplant.[25]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 24: Parkinson in his Herball [London, 1640]\r\n              says:--\"It is thought by some that John Nicot, this\r\n              Frenchman, being agent in Portugall for the French King,\r\n              sent this sort of tobacco [Brazil] and not any other to\r\n              the French Queene, and is called therefore herba Regina,\r\n              and from Nicotiana, which is probably because the\r\n              Portugalis and not the Spaniards were masters of Brazile\r\n              at that time.\"]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 25: \"Sir John Nicot sent some seeds of it into\r\n              France, to King Francis II., the Queen Mother, and Lord\r\n              Jarnac, Governor of Rochel, and several others of the\r\n              French Lords.\"]\r\n\r\nAs the history of Nicot is so intimately connected with that of the\r\nplant, a short sketch of this original importer will doubtless be\r\ninteresting to all lovers of the weed:--\r\n\r\n     \"John Nicot, Sieur de Villemain, was born at Nismes in 1530,\r\n     and died at Paris in 1600. He was the son of a notary at\r\n     Nismes, and started in life with a good education, but with\r\n     no fortune. Finding that his native town offered no suitable\r\n     or sufficient field for his energies, he went to Paris and\r\n     strove hard to extend his studies as a scholar and his\r\n     connections as an adventurer. He made the acquaintance of\r\n     some courtiers, who felt or affected an interest in learning\r\n     and in learned men. His manners were insinuating; his\r\n     character was pliable. When presented at court he succeeded\r\n     in gaining the esteem and confidence of Henry II., the\r\n     husband of Catherine de Medicis. Francis II., the son of\r\n     Henry II., and the first husband of Mary Stuart, continued\r\n     to Nicot the favor of which Henry II. had deemed him worthy,\r\n     and sent him in 1560 as ambassador to Sebastian, King of\r\n     Portugal. He was successful in his mission. But it was\r\n     neither his talents as a diplomatist, nor his remarkable\r\n     mind, nor his solid erudition, which made Nicot immortal. It\r\n     was by popularizing tobacco in France that he gained a\r\n     lasting fame.\r\n\r\n     \"It is said that it was at Lisbon that Nicot became\r\n     acquainted with the extraordinary properties of tobacco. But\r\n     it is likewise stated with quite as much confidence, that a\r\n     Flemish merchant, who had just returned from America,\r\n     offered Nicot at Bordeaux, where they met, some seeds of the\r\n     tobacco, telling him of their value. The seeds Nicot sent to\r\n     Catherine de Medicis, and on arriving in Paris he gave her\r\n     some leaves of tobacco. Hence, when tobacco began to creep\r\n     into use in France it was called Queen's Herb or Medicean\r\n     Herb.[26] The cultivation of tobacco, except as a fancy\r\n     plant, did not begin in France till 1626; and John Nicot\r\n     could have had no presentiment of the agricultural,\r\n     commercial, financial and social importance which tobacco\r\n     was ultimately to assume. Nicot published two works. The\r\n     first was an edition of the History of France or of the\r\n     Franks, in Latin, written by a Monk called Aimonious, who\r\n     lived in the tenth century. The second was a 'Treasury of\r\n     the French Language, Ancient and Modern.'\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 26: \"The Abbe Jacques Gohory, the author of\r\n              the first book written on tobacao, proposed to call it\r\n              Catherinaine or Medicee, to record the name of Medicis\r\n              and the medicinal virtues of the plant; but the name of\r\n              Nicot superseded these, and botanists have perpetuated\r\n              it in the genus _Nicotiana_.\"--_Le Maout and Decaisne._]\r\n\r\nStevens and Liebault in the \"Country Farm\"[27] give the following\r\naccount of its early introduction into France and the wonderful cures\r\nproduced by its use:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 27: London 1606.]\r\n\r\n     \"Nicotiana though it have (has) beene but a while knowne in\r\n     France yet it holdeth the first and principall place amongst\r\n     Physicke herbs, by reason of his singular and almost diuine\r\n     (divine) vertues, such as you shall heare of hereafter,\r\n     whereof (because none either of the old or new writers that\r\n     have written of the nature of plants, have said anything), I\r\n     am willing to lay open the whole history, as I have come by\r\n     it through a deere friend of mine, the first author,\r\n     inventor, and bringer of this herb into France: as also of\r\n     many both Spaniards, Portugals, and others which have\r\n     travelled into Florida, a country of the Indians, from\r\n     whence this herbe came, to put the same in writing to\r\n     relieve such griefe and travell, as have heard of this\r\n     herbe, but neither know it nor the properties thereof. This\r\n     herbe is called Nicotiana of the name of an ambassador which\r\n     brought the first knowledge of it into this realme, in like\r\n     manner as many plants do as yet retaine the names of\r\n     certaine Greekes and Romans, who being strangers in divers\r\n     countries, for their common-wealth's service, have from\r\n     thence indowed their own countree with many plants, whereof\r\n     there was no knowledge before. Some call it the herbe of\r\n     Queen mother, because the said ambassador Lord Nicot did\r\n     first send the same unto the Queen mother,[28] (as you shall\r\n     understand by and by) and for being afterwards by her given\r\n     to divers others to plant and make to grow in this country.\r\n     Others call it by the name of the herbe of the great Prior,\r\n     because the said Lord a while after sailing into these\r\n     western seas, and happening to lodge neere unto the said\r\n     Lord ambassador of Lisbone, gathered divers plants thereof\r\n     out of his garden, and set them to increase here in France,\r\n     and there in greater quantitie, and with more care than any\r\n     other besides him, he did so highly esteeme thereof for the\r\n     exceeding good qualities sake.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 28: George Buchanan, the Scotch Philosopher\r\n              and poet tutor of James I., had a strong aversion to\r\n              Catherine of Medicis, and in one of his Latin epigrams,\r\n              alludes to the herb being called _Medicie_, advising all\r\n              who valued their health to shun it, not so much from its\r\n              being naturally hurtful, but that it needs must become\r\n              poisonous if called by so hateful a name.]\r\n\r\n     \"The Spaniards call it Tobaco, it were better to call it\r\n     Nicotiana, after the name of the Lord who first sent it into\r\n     France, to the end that we may give him the honor which he\r\n     hath deserved of us, for having furnished our land with so\r\n     rare and singular an herbe: and thus much for the name, now\r\n     listen unto the whole historie: Master John Nicot, one of\r\n     the king's counsell, being ambassador for his Maiestie\r\n     (Majesty) in the realme of Portiugall, in the yeere of our\r\n     Lord God, 1559. 60. and 61. went on a day to see the\r\n     monuments and northie places of the said king of Portiugall:\r\n     at which time a gentleman keeper of the said monuments\r\n     presented him with this herbe as a strange plant brought\r\n     from Florida. The nobleman Sir Nicot having procured it to\r\n     growe in his garden, where it had put forth and multiplied\r\n     very greatly, was aduertifed (notified) on a daie by one of\r\n     his pages, that a yoong boie kinsman of the said page, had\r\n     laide (for triall sake) the said herbe, pressed, the\r\n     substance and juice and altogether, upon an ulcer which he\r\n     had upon his cheeke, neere unto his nose, next neighbor to a\r\n     _Noli me tangere_, (a cancer) as having already seazed upon\r\n     the cartilages, and that by the use thereof it was become\r\n     marvellous well: upon this occasion the nobleman Nicot\r\n     called the boie to him, and making him to continue the\r\n     applying of this herbe for eight or ten days, the _Noli me\r\n     tangere_ became thoroughly kild: nowe they had sent\r\n     oftetimes unto one of the king's most famous phisitions, the\r\n     said boie during the time of this worke and operation to\r\n     make and see the proceeding and working of the said\r\n     Nicotiana, and having in charge to do the same until the end\r\n     of ten days, the said phisition then beholding him, assured\r\n     him that the _Noli me tangere_ was dead, as indeed the boie\r\n     never felt anything of it at any time afterward.\r\n\r\n     \"Some certain time after, one of the cooks of the said\r\n     ambassador having almost all his thombe (thumb) cut off from\r\n     his hand, with a great kitchin knife, the steward running\r\n     unto the said Nicotiana, made to him use of it five or six\r\n     dressings, by the ende of which the wounde was healed. From\r\n     this time forward this herbe began to become famous in\r\n     Lisbon, where the king of Portiugal's court was at that\r\n     time, and the vertues thereof much spoken of, and the common\r\n     people began to call it the ambassador's herbe. Now upon\r\n     this occasion there came certain days after, a gentleman\r\n     from the fields being father unto one of the pages of the\r\n     said Lord ambassador, who was troubled with an ulcer in his\r\n     legge of two years continuance, and craved of the said Lord\r\n     some of his herbe, and using it in manner afore mentioned,\r\n     he was healed by the end of ten or twelve daies. After this\r\n     yet the herbe grewe still in greater reputation, inasmuch as\r\n     that many hasted out of all corners to get some of this\r\n     herbe. And among the rest, there was one woman which had a\r\n     great ring worme, covering all her face like a mask, and\r\n     having taken deepe roote, to whom the said Lord caused this\r\n     Petum to be given, and withall the manner of using it to be\r\n     told her, and at the end of eight or ten daies, this woman\r\n     being thoroughly cured, came to shewe herself unto the said\r\n     Lord, and how that she was cured. There came likewise a\r\n     captain bringing with him his son diseased with the king's\r\n     evill, unto the said Lord Ambassador, for to send him into\r\n     France, upon whom there was some triall made of the said\r\n     herbe, whereupon within four daies he began to show great\r\n     signs and tokens of healing, and in the end was thoroughly\r\n     cured of his king's evil.\"\r\n\r\nItaly received the first plant from Santa Croce,[29] who, like Nicot,\r\nobtained the seed in Lisbon. In 1575 first appeared a figure of the\r\nplant in Andre Theret's \"Cosmographie,\" which was but an imperfect\r\nrepresentation of the plant. It was supposed by many on its discovery\r\nto grow like the engraving given--in form resembling a tree or shrub\r\nrather than an herb. Tobacco was first brought to England by Sir John\r\nHawkins, who obtained the plant in Florida in 1565, and afterwards by\r\nSir Francis Drake.[30] The first planters of it in England were said\r\nto be Captain Grenfield and Sir Francis Drake. One account of its\r\nintroduction into England is as follows:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 29: The Pied Bull Inn, at Islington, was the\r\n              first house in England where tobacco was smoked, while\r\n              Moll Cut-Purse, a noted pickpocket who flourished in the\r\n              time of Charles II., is said to have been the first\r\n              Englishwoman who smoked tobacco.]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 30: \"It was introduced, about 1520, into\r\n              Portugal and Spain by Doctor Hernandez of Toledo; into\r\n              Italy by Thornabon and the Cardinal de Sainte-Croif,\r\n              into England by Captain Drake and into France by Andre\r\n              Theret, a gray friar.\"--_Le Maout and Decaisne's General\r\n              System of Botany_ (Paris 1868).]\r\n\r\n     \"The plant was first used by Sir Walter Raleigh and others,\r\n     who had acquired a taste for it in Virginia.[31] Among the\r\n     natives the usual mode employed in smoking the plant was by\r\n     means of hollow canes, and pipes made of wood and decorated\r\n     with copper and green stones. To deprive it of its acidity,\r\n     some of the natives were wont to pass the smoke through\r\n     bulbs containing water, in which aromatic and medicinal\r\n     herbs had been infused.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 31: Short says of its introduction into\r\n              England: \"Sir Walter Raleigh's Marriners, under Mr.\r\n              Ralph Lane, his Agent in Virginia first brought this\r\n              Commodity into England Anno 1584; and that famous\r\n              Proprietor of this Plantation foresaw good reasons to\r\n              introduce the use of it, however King James might\r\n              afterwards, through his own personal Distaste both of it\r\n              and, him, wrote his Counterblast against it; a work\r\n              surely consistent with the Pen of no Prince, but one of\r\n              his Politicks.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old engraving of tobacco.]\r\n\r\nNeander ascribes this invention to the Persians; but Magnenus rather\r\nattributes it to the Dutch and English, to the latter of whom attaches\r\nthe credit of having invented the clay pipes of modern times. Some\r\nwriters have concluded that the plant served as a narcotic in some\r\nparts of Asia. Liebault thinks it was known in Europe[32] many years\r\nbefore the discovery of the New World, and asserts that the plant had\r\nbeen found in the Ardennes. Magnenus, however, claims its origin as\r\ntransatlantic and affirms as his belief that the winds had doubtless\r\ncarried the seeds from one continent to the other. Pallos says that\r\namong the Chinese, and among the Mongol tribes who had the most\r\nintercourse with them, the custom of smoking is so general, so\r\nfrequent, and has become so indispensable a luxury; the tobacco purse\r\naffixed to their belt so necessary an article of dress; the form of\r\nthe pipes, from which the Dutch seem to have taken the model of\r\ntheirs, so original; and, finally, the preparation of the leaves so\r\npeculiar, that they could not possibly derive all this from America by\r\nway of Europe, especially as India, where the practice of smoking is\r\nnot so general, intervenes between Persia and China. Meyen also states\r\nthat the consumption of tobacco in the Chinese empire is of immense\r\nextent, and the practice seems to be of great antiquity, \"for on very\r\nold sculptures I have observed the very same tobacco pipes which are\r\nstill used.\" Besides, we now know that the plant which furnishes the\r\nChinese tobacco is even said to grow wild in the East Indies.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 32: James the First also inclines to this\r\n              belief, declaring tobacco to be \"a common herb which\r\n              (though under divers names) grows almost everywhere.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco,\" says Loudon, \"was introduced into the county of\r\n     Cork, with the potatoe, by Sir Walter Raleigh.\" A quaint\r\n     writer of this period says of the plant: \"Tobacco, that\r\n     excellent plant, the use whereof (as of fifth element) the\r\n     world cannot want, is that little shop of Nature, wherein\r\n     her whole workmanship is abridged; where you may see earth\r\n     kindled into fire, the fire breathe out an exhalation, which\r\n     entering in at the mouth walks through the regions of a\r\n     man's brain, drives out all ill vapors but itself, draws\r\n     down all bad humors by the mouth, which in time might breed\r\n     a scab over the whole body, if already they have not; a\r\n     plant of singular use; for, on the one side Nature being an\r\n     enemy to vacuity and emptiness and on the other, there being\r\n     so many empty brains in the world as there are, how shall\r\n     Nature's course be continued? How shall those empty brains\r\n     be filled but with air, Nature's immediate instrument to\r\n     that purpose? If with air, what so proper as your fume; what\r\n     fume so healthful as your perfume, what perfume so sovereign\r\n     as tobacco. Besides the excellent edge it gives a man's wit,\r\n     as they but judge that have been present at a feast of\r\n     tobacco, where commonly all good wits are consoled; what\r\n     variety of discourse it begets, what sparks of wit it\r\n     yields?\"[33]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 33: A writer in the \"New England Magazine\"\r\n              says in a different strain: \"This is the enemy that men\r\n              put in their mouths, to steal away their health. This\r\n              has filled the camp, the court, the grove. It is found\r\n              in the pulpit, the senate, the bar and the boudoir.\"]\r\n\r\nThe name of Sir Walter is intimately connected with the history of\r\ntobacco, and is associated with many of the brilliant exploits and\r\nexplorations during the reign of the illustrious Elizabeth.[34] His\r\nname has come down to us as being that of the first smoker of tobacco\r\nin England,[35] and many amusing anecdotes are told of him and the new\r\ncustom which he introduced and sanctioned. Dixon has given us the\r\nfollowing vivid picture of the great Elizabethan navigator:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 34: Thorpe, in his \"History and Mystery of\r\n              Tobacco,\" relates the following anecdote: \"Tradition\r\n              says, that in the time of Queen Elizabeth Sir Walter\r\n              Raleigh used to sit at his door with Sir Hugh Middleton\r\n              and smoke.\"]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 35: Dr. Thomas Short, in his work \"Discourses\r\n              on Tea, Tobacco, Punch, &c,\" (London 1750,) says of the\r\n              original smoker: \"Sir Walter was the first that brought\r\n              the Custom of smoking it into Britain, upon his return\r\n              from America; for he saw the natives of Florida, Brazil\r\n              and other places of the Indies, smoak it thus, they hung\r\n              about their Necks little Pipes or Horns made of the\r\n              Leaves of the Date Tree, or of Reeds or Rushes; and at\r\n              the ends of them they put several dry Tobacco Leaves\r\n              twisted and broken, and set the ends of them on fire,\r\n              and sucked in as much of the smoak as they could.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"In a pleasant room of Durham House, in the Strand,--a room\r\n     overhanging a lovely garden, with the river, the old bridge,\r\n     the towers of Lambeth Palace, and the flags of Paris Garden\r\n     and the Globe in view,--three men may have often met and\r\n     smoked a pipe in the days of Good Queen Bess, who are dear\r\n     to all readers of English blood; because, in the first\r\n     place, they were the highest types of our race in genius and\r\n     in daring; in the second place because the work of their\r\n     hands has shaped the whole after-life of their countrymen in\r\n     every sphere of enterprise and thought. That splendid Durham\r\n     House, in which the nine-days queen had been married to\r\n     Guilford Dudley, and which had afterwards been the\r\n     town-house of Elizabeth, belonged to Sir Walter Raleigh, by\r\n     whom it was held on leave from the queen. Raleigh, a friend\r\n     of William Shakespeare and the players, was also a friend of\r\n     Francis Bacon and the philosophers. Raleigh is said to have\r\n     founded the Mermaid Club; and it is certain that he numbered\r\n     friends among the poets and players. The proofs of his\r\n     having known Shakespeare, though indirect, are strong. Of\r\n     his long intercourse with Bacon every one is aware. Thus it\r\n     requires no effort of the fancy to picture these three men\r\n     as lounging in a window of Durham House, puffing the new\r\n     Indian weed from silver bowls, discussing the highest themes\r\n     in poetry and science, while gazing on the flower-beds and\r\n     the river, the darting barges of dames and cavalier, and the\r\n     distant pavilions of Paris Garden and the Globe.\"\r\n\r\nIts use by so distinguished a person as Raleigh was equivalent to its\r\ngeneral introduction.[36] Aubrey says:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 36: So common was the indulgence that in 1600,\r\n              only seventeen years after Sir Francis Drake returned\r\n              from America, and set the example of using tobacco, the\r\n              French Embassador writes in his dispatches to Paris,\r\n              that the peers, while engaged in the trials of Essex and\r\n              Southampton, deliberated upon their verdicts with pipes\r\n              in their mouths!]\r\n\r\n     \"He was the first that brought tobacco into England, and\r\n     into fashion. In our part--Malmsbury Hundred--it came first\r\n     into fashion by Sir Walter Long. They had first silver\r\n     pipes. The ordinary sort made use of a walnut shell and a\r\n     strawe. I have heard my grandfather Lyte say that one pipe\r\n     was handed from man to man round the table. Sir Walter\r\n     Raleigh standing in a stand at Sir Ro. Poyntz parke at Acton\r\n     tooke a pipe of tobacco, which made the ladies quitte it\r\n     till he had donne.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Walter Raleigh.]\r\n\r\nA writer has truthfully said in regard to associating the name and use\r\nof the plant with the primitive users of it.\r\n\r\n     \"The ambitious sought fame by associating themselves with\r\n     the introduction of the plant and its cultivation; hence we\r\n     find it named after cardinals, legates, and embassadors,\r\n     while in compliment to Catherine, wife of Henry the Second,\r\n     it was called the Queen's herb.\"\r\n\r\nKings now rushed into the tobacco trade. Those of Spain took the lead,\r\nand became the largest manufacturers of snuff and cigars in\r\nChristendom, and the royal workshops of Seville are still the most\r\nextensive in Europe. Other monarchs monopolized the business in their\r\ndominions, and all began to reap enormous profits from it, as most do\r\nat this day. In the year 1615 tobacco was first planted in Holland;\r\nand in Switzerland in 1686. As soon as its cultivation became general\r\nin Spain and Portugal the tobacco trade was \"farmed out,\" bringing an\r\nenormous revenue to those kingdoms. About the beginning of the\r\nSeventeenth Century the Portuguese introduced into Hindostan and\r\nPersia[37] two things, pine-apples and tobacco. To the pine-apples no\r\nobjection seems to have been made; but to the tobacco the most\r\nstrenuous resistance was offered by the sovereigns of the two\r\ncountries. Spite, however, of punishments and prohibitions the use of\r\ntobacco spread with the rapidity of lightning.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 37: Savary says that tobacco has been known\r\n              among the Persians for upwards of 400 years, and\r\n              supposes that they received it from Egypt, and not from\r\n              the East Indies.]\r\n\r\nIn England, tobacco taking soon became a favorite custom not only with\r\nthe loiterers about taverns and other public places, but among the\r\ncourtiers of Elizabeth. Smoking was called drinking tobacco, as the\r\nfashionable method was to \"put it through the nose\" or exhale it\r\nthrough the nostrils. At this period tobacco seemed to have nearly the\r\nsame effect as it did upon the Indian, producing a sort of\r\nintoxication; thus in \"The Perfuming of Tobacco\" (1611) it is said:\r\n     \"The smoke of tobacco drunke or drawen by a pipe, filleth\r\n     the membranes of the braine, and astonisheth and filleth\r\n     many persons with such joy and pleasure, and sweet losse of\r\n     senses, that they can by no means be without it.\"\r\n\r\nThe term \"drinking tobacco\" was not confined to England, but was used\r\nin Holland, France, Spain and Portugal, as the same method of blowing\r\nthe smoke through the nostrils, seemed to be everywhere in vogue.\r\n\r\nThe use of tobacco increased very rapidly soon after its importation\r\nfrom Virginia. The Spaniards and Portuguese had hitherto monopolized\r\nthe trade, so that it brought enormous prices, some kinds selling for\r\nits weight in silver. As soon as its culture commenced in Virginia the\r\ndemand for West India tobacco lessened and Virginia leaf soon came\r\ninto favor, owing not more to the lowering of price than to the\r\nquality of the leaf.[38] This was about 1620, which some writers have\r\ncalled the golden age of tobacco. It had now become a prime favorite\r\nand was used by nearly all classes. Poets and dramatists sung its\r\npraises, while others wrote of its wonderful medicinal qualities.[39]\r\nFops and knaves alike indulged in its use.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 38: Neander, in his work on \"Tobacologia\"\r\n              (London, 1622), mentions eighteen varieties of tobacco,\r\n              or at least localities from where it was shipped to\r\n              London, among which are the following: Varinas\r\n              (considered the best), Brazil, Maracay, Orinoco,\r\n              Margarita, Caracas, Cumana, Amazon, Virginia,\r\n              Philippines, St. Lucia, Trinidad, and St. Domingo.]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 39: \"The first author (says an English writer)\r\n              who wrote of this Plant was Charles Stephanus, in 1564.\r\n              This was a mean, short, inaccurate Draught, till Dr.\r\n              John Liebault wrote a whole Discourse of it next year,\r\n              and put it into his second Book of Husbandry, which was\r\n              every year reprinted with additions and alterations, for\r\n              twenty years after. He had a large Correspondence, a\r\n              good Intelligence, and wrote the best of the age, and\r\n              gathered the greatest stock of experience about this new\r\n              Plant.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"About the latter end of the sixteenth century, tobacco was\r\n     in great vogue in London, with wits and 'gallants,' as the\r\n     dandies of that age were called. To wear a pair of velvet\r\n     breeches, with panes or slashes of silk, an enormous\r\n     starched ruff, a gilt handled sword, and a Spanish dagger;\r\n     to play at cards or dice in the chambers of the\r\n     groom-porter, and smoke tobacco in the tilt-yard or at the\r\n     play-house, were then the grand characteristics of a man of\r\n     fashion. Tobacconists' shops were then common; and as the\r\n     article, which appears to have been sold at a high price,\r\n     was indispensable to the gay 'man about town,' he generally\r\n     endeavored to keep his credit good with his\r\n     tobacco-merchant. Poets and pamphleteers laughed at the\r\n     custom, though generally they seem to have no particular\r\n     aversion to an occasional treat to a sober pipe and a poute\r\n     of sack. Your men of war, who had served in the Low\r\n     Countries, and who taught young gallants the noble art of\r\n     fencing, were particularly fond of tobacco; and your\r\n     gentlemen adventurers, who had served in a buccaneering\r\n     expedition against the Spaniards, were no less partial to\r\n     it. Sailors--from the captain to the ship-boy--all affected\r\n     to smoke, as if the practice was necessary to their\r\n     character; and to 'take tobacco' and wear a silver whistle,\r\n     like a modern boatswain's mate, was the pride of a\r\n     man-of-war's man.\r\n\r\n     \"Ben Jonson, of all our early dramatic writers, most\r\n     frequently alludes to the practice of smoking. In his play\r\n     of 'Every Man in his Humour,' first acted in 1598, Captain\r\n     Bobadil thus extols in his own peculiar vein the virtues of\r\n     tobacco; while Cob, the water carrier, with about equal\r\n     truth, relates some startling instances of its pernicious\r\n     effects.\r\n\r\n     \"'_Bobadil._ Body o' me, here's the remainder of seven pound\r\n     since yesterday was seven-night! 'Tis your right Trinadado!\r\n     Did you never take any, Master Stephen?\r\n\r\n     \"'_Stephen._ No, truly, Sir; but I'll learn to take it since\r\n     you commend it so.\r\n\r\n     \"'_Bobadil._ Sir, believe me upon my relation,--for what I\r\n     tell you the world shall not reprove. I have been in the\r\n     Indies where this herb grows, where neither myself, nor a\r\n     dozen gentlemen more of my knowledge, have received the\r\n     taste of any other nutriment in the world, for the space of\r\n     one and twenty weeks, but the fume of this simple only.\r\n     Therefore, it cannot be but 'tis most divine. Further, take\r\n     it, in the true kind, so, it makes an antidote, that had you\r\n     taken the most deadly poisonous plant in all Italy, it\r\n     should expel it and clarify you with as much ease as I\r\n     speak. And for your greenwound, your balsamum, and your St.\r\n     John's-wort, are all mere gulleries and trash to it,\r\n     especially your Trinidado: your Nicotian is good too. I\r\n     could say what I know of it for the expulsion of rheums, raw\r\n     humours, crudities, obstructions, with a thousand of this\r\n     kind, but I profess myself no quack-salver: only thus much,\r\n     by Hercules; I do hold it, and will affirm it before any\r\n     prince in Europe, to be the most sovereign and precious weed\r\n     that ever the earth tendered to the use of man.'\r\n\r\n     _Cob._ \"'By gad's me, I mar'l what pleasure or felicity they\r\n     have in taking this roguish tobacco!

The costumes were exceedingly\r\ngrotesque and suggestive of the New rather than of the Old World.\r\nKawosha one of the principal characters rode in, wearing on his head a\r\ncap of red-cloth of gold, from his ears were pendants, a glass chain\r\nwas about his neck, his body and legs were covered with olive-colored\r\nstuff, in his hands were a bow and arrows, and the bases of\r\ntobacco--colored stuff cut like tobacco leaves. The play abounds with\r\nallusions to the \"Indian weed.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_Silenus._--Kawosha comes in majestie,\r\n                    Was never such a God as he;\r\n                    He's come from a far countrie\r\n                    To make our nose a chimney.\r\n\r\n  _Kawosha._--The wine takes the contrary way\r\n                   To get into the hood;\r\n                   But good tobacco makes no stay\r\n                   But seizeth where it should.\r\n                   More incense hath burned at\r\n                   Great Kawoshae's foote\r\n                   Than to Silen and Bacchus, both,\r\n                   And take in Jove to boote.\r\n\r\n  _Silenus._--The worthies they were nine tis true,\r\n                   And lately Arthur's knights I knew;\r\n                   But now are come up Worthies new,\r\n                   The roaring boys Kawoshae's crew.\r\n\r\n  _Kawosha._--Silenus toppes the barrel, but\r\n                   Tobacco toppes the braine\r\n                   And makes the vapors fire and soote,\r\n                   That mon revise againe.\r\n                   Nothing but fumigation\r\n                   Doth charm away ill sprites,\r\n                   Kawosha and his nation\r\n                   Found out these holy rites.\"\r\n\r\nThe writers of this period abound in allusions to tobacco and its use.\r\nThe poets and dramatists found in it a fertile field for the display\r\nof their satire, and from 1600 to 1650 stage plays introduced many\r\ncharacters as either tobacco drinkers or sellers. It had now become\r\nso great a custom and had increased so fast after the importation of\r\nVirginia tobacco that it afforded them no insignificant theme for the\r\ndisplay of their genius.[41] The plays of Jonson, Decker, Rowland,\r\nHeywood, Middleton, Fields, Fletcher, Hutton, Lodge, Sharpham,\r\nMarston, Lilly (court poet to Elizabeth), the Duke of Newcastle and\r\nothers are full of allusions to the plant and those who indulged in\r\nits use. Shakespeare,[42] however, does not once allude to its use,\r\nand his silence on this then curious custom has provoked much\r\nconjecture and inquiry. Some affirm that he wrote to please royalty,\r\nbut if so why did he not condemn the custom to appease the wrath of a\r\nsapient king. Others say he kept silence because he was the friend of\r\nRaleigh, and though he would have gladly held up the great smoker and\r\nhis favorite indulgence, feared to add to the popularity of the custom\r\nby displeasing his royal master. Another class affirm that as the\r\nstories of his plays are all antecedent to his own time, therefore he\r\nnever mentions either the drinking of tobacco, or the tumultuous\r\nscenes of the ordinary which belonged to it, and which are so\r\nconstantly met with in his contemporary dramatists. Says one:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 41: \"Never did nature produce a Plant that in\r\n              a short Time became so universally used, for it was but\r\n              a short while known in Europe, till it was taken almost\r\n              everywhere, either chewed; smoked, or snuffed. A pipe of\r\n              tobacco is now the general and most frequent companion\r\n              of, Mug, Bottle, or Punch-bowl.\"--_T. Short._]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 42: Gifford has also remarked that Shakspeare\r\n              is the only one of the dramatic writers of the age of\r\n              James who does not condescend to notice tobacco; all the\r\n              others abound in allusions to it. In Jonson we find\r\n              tobacco in every place--in Cob the waterman's house, and\r\n              in the Apollo Club-room, on the stage, and at the\r\n              ordinary. The world of London was then divided into two\r\n              classes--the tobacco-lovers and the tobacco-haters.]\r\n\r\n     \"How is it that our great dramatist never once makes even\r\n     the slightest allusion to smoking? Who can suggest a reason?\r\n     Our great poet knew the human heart too well, and kept too\r\n     steadily in view, the universal nature of man to be afraid\r\n     of painting the external trapping and ephemeral customs of\r\n     his own time. Does he not delight to moralize on false hair,\r\n     masks, rapiers, pomandens, perfumes, dice, bowls,\r\n     fardingales, etc? Did he not sketch for us, with enjoyment\r\n     and with satire, too, the fantastic fops, the pompous\r\n     stewards, the mischievous pages, the quarrelsome revellers,\r\n     the testy gaolers, the rhapsodizing lovers, the sly cheats,\r\n     and the ruffling courtiers that filled the streets of\r\n     Elizabethan London, persons who could have been found\r\n     nowhere else nor in any other age? No one can dispute that\r\n     he drew the life that he saw moving around him. He sketched\r\n     these creatures because they were before his eyes and were\r\n     his enemies or his associates; they live still because their\r\n     creator's genius was Promethean, and endowed them with\r\n     immortality. Bardolph, Moth, Slender, Abhorson, Don Armado,\r\n     Mercutio, etc., are portraits, as everyone knows and feels\r\n     who is conversant with the manners of the Elizabethan times\r\n     as handed down in old plays.\r\n\r\n     \"If Shakespeare's contemporaries were silent about the then\r\n     new fashion of smoking, we should not so much wonder at\r\n     Shakespeare's taciturnity. But Decker's and Ben Jonson's\r\n     works abound in allusions to tobacco, its uses and abuses.\r\n     The humorist and satirist lost no opportunity of deriding\r\n     the new fashion and its followers. The tobacco merchant was\r\n     an important person in London of James the First's\r\n     time--with his Winchester pipes, his maple cutting-blocks,\r\n     his juniper-wood charcoal fires, and his silver tongs with\r\n     which to hand the hot charcoal to his customers, although he\r\n     was shrewdly suspected of adulterating the precious weed\r\n     with sack lees and oil. It was his custom to wash the\r\n     tobacco in muscadel and grains, and to keep it moist by\r\n     wrapping it in greased leather, and oiled rags, or by\r\n     burying it in gravel. The Elizabethan pipes were so small\r\n     that now when they are dug up in Ireland the poor call them\r\n     'fairy pipes' from their tininess. These pipes became known\r\n     by the nickname of 'the woodcock's heads.' The apothecaries,\r\n     who sold the best tobacco, became masters of the art, and\r\n     received pupils, whom they taught to exhale the smoke in\r\n     little globes, rings, or the 'Euripus.' 'The slights' these\r\n     tricks were called. Ben Jonson facetiously makes these\r\n     professors boast of being able to take three whiffs, then to\r\n     take horse, and evolve the smoke--one whiff on Hounslow, a\r\n     second at Staines, and a third at Bagshot.\r\n\r\n     \"The ordinary gallant, like Mercutio, would smoke while the\r\n     dinner was serving up. Those who were rich and foolish\r\n     carried with them smoking apparatus of gold or\r\n     silver--tobacco-box, snuff-ladle, tongs to take up charcoal,\r\n     and priming irons. There seems, from Decker's \"Gull's\r\n     Horn-Book,\" to have been smoking clubs, or tobacco\r\n     ordinaries as they were called, where the entire talk was of\r\n     the best shops for buying Trinidado, the Nicotine, the Cane,\r\n     and the Pudding, whose pipe had the best bore, which would\r\n     turn blackest, and which would break in the browning. At the\r\n     theatres, the rakes and spendthrifts who, crowded the stage\r\n     of Shakespeare's time sat on low stools smoking; they sat\r\n     with their three sorts of tobacco beside them, and handed\r\n     each other lights on the points of their swords, sending out\r\n     their pages for more Trinidado if they required it. Many\r\n     gallants 'took' their tobacco in the lords room over the\r\n     stage, and went out to (Saint) Paul's to spit there\r\n     privately. Shabby sponges and lying adventurers, like\r\n     Bobadil, bragged of the number of packets of 'the most\r\n     divine tobacco' they had smoked in a week, and told enormous\r\n     lies of living for weeks in the Indies on the fumes alone.\r\n     They affirmed it was an antidote to all poison; that it\r\n     expelled rheums, sour humours, and obstructions of all\r\n     kinds. Some doctors were of opinion that it would heal\r\n     gout[43] and the ague, neutralise the effects of\r\n     drunkenness, and remove weariness and hunger. The poor on\r\n     the other hand, not disinclined to be envious and detracting\r\n     when judging rich men's actions, laughed at men who made\r\n     chimneys of their throats, or who sealed up their noses with\r\n     snuff.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 43: \"Some hold it for a singular remedie\r\n              against the gowte (gout), to chaw every morning the\r\n              leaves of Petum (tobacco), because it voideth great\r\n              quantitie of flegme out at the mouth, hindering the same\r\n              from falling upon the joints, which is the very cause of\r\n              the gowte.\" _Dr. Richard Surflet_ (1606).]\r\n\r\n     \"Ben Jonson makes that dry, shrewd, water carrier of his,\r\n     Cob, rail at the 'roguish tobacco:' he would leave the\r\n     stocks for worse men, and make it present whipping for\r\n     either man or woman who dealt with a tobacco-pipe. But King\r\n     James, in his inane 'Counterblast,' is more violent than\r\n     even Cob. He argues that to use this unsavory smoke is to be\r\n     guilty of a worse sin than that of drunkenness, and asks how\r\n     men, who cannot go a day's journey without sending for hot\r\n     coals to kindle their tobacco, can be expected to endure the\r\n     privations of war. Smoking, the angry and fuming king\r\n     protests, had made our manners as rude as those of the\r\n     fish-wives of Dieppe. Smokers, tossing pipes and puffing\r\n     smoke over the dinner-table, forgot all cleanliness and\r\n     modesty. Men now, he says, cannot welcome a friend but\r\n     straight they must be in hand with tobacco. He that refused\r\n     a pipe in company was accounted peevish and unsociable.\r\n     'Yea,' says the royal coxcomb and pedant, 'the mistress\r\n     cannot in a more mannerly kind entertain her servant than by\r\n     giving him out of her fair hand a pipe of tobacco.' The\r\n     royal reformer (not the most virtuous or cleanly of men)\r\n     closes his denunciation with this tremendous broadside of\r\n     invective:\r\n\r\n     'Have you not reason, then' he says, 'to be shamed and to\r\n     forbear this filthy novelty, so basely grounded, so\r\n     foolishly received, and so grossly mistaken in the right use\r\n     thereof? To your abuse thereof sinning against God, harming\r\n     yourself both in persons and goods, and taking also thereby\r\n     the notes and marks of vanity upon you by the custom\r\n     thereof, making yourselves to be wondered at by all, foreign\r\n     civil nations and by all strangers that come among you, and\r\n     be scorned, and contemned; a custom both fulsome to the eye,\r\n     hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to the\r\n     lungs, and in the black stinking fume thereof nearest\r\n     resembling the horrible Stigian smelle of the pit that is\r\n     bottomless.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Exhaling through the nose.]\r\n\r\nThe supposed curative virtues of the tobacco plant had much to do with\r\nits use in Europe while the singular mode of exhaling through the\r\nnostrils added to its charms, and doubtless led to far greater\r\nindulgence. Spenser in his Fairy Queen makes one of the characters\r\ninclude it with other herbs celebrated for medicinal qualities.\r\n\r\n  \"Into the woods thence-forth in haste she went,\r\n  To seek for herbes that mote him remedy;\r\n  For she of herbes had great intendiment,\r\n  Taught of the Nymph which from her infancy,\r\n  Had nursed her in true nobility:\r\n  There whether it divine Tobacco were,\r\n  Or Panachæ, or Polygony,\r\n  She found and brought it to her patient deare,\r\n  Who all this while lay bleeding out his heart-blood neare.\"\r\n\r\nLilly also a little later, in his play of The Woman in the Moone\r\n(1597), speaks of it (through one of the characters) as being a\r\nmedicinal herb--\r\n\r\n  \"Gather me balme and cooling violets\r\n  And of our holy herbe nicotian,\r\n  And bring withall pure honey from the hive\r\n  To heale the wound of my unhappy hand.\"\r\n\r\nBarclay, in his tract on \"The Vertues of Tobacco,\" recommends its use\r\nas a medicine. The following is one of the modes of use:\r\n\r\n     \"Take of leafe Tobacco as much as, being folded together,\r\n     may make a round ball of such bignesse that it may fill the\r\n     patient's mouth, and inclyne his face downwards toward the\r\n     ground, keeping the mouth open, not mouthing any whit with\r\n     his tongue, except now and then to waken the medicament,\r\n     there shall flow such a flood of water from his brain and\r\n     his stomacke, and from all the parts of his body that it\r\n     shall be a wonder. This must he do fasting in the morning,\r\n     and if it be for preservation, and the body be very\r\n     cacochyme, or full of evil humors, he must take it once a\r\n     week, otherwise once a month. He gives the plant the name of\r\n     'Nepenthes,' and says of it, that 'it is worthy of a more\r\n     loftie name.'\" He writes the following verse addressed to:\r\n\r\n          \"THE ABUSERS OF TOBACCO.\"\r\n\r\n          \"Why do you thus abuse this heavenly plant,\r\n           The hope of health, the fuel of our life?\r\n           Why do you waste it without fear of want,\r\n           Since fine and true tobacco is not ryfe?\r\n           Old Enclio won't foul water for to spair,\r\n           And stop the bellows not to waste the air.\"\r\n\r\nHe also alludes to the quality of tobacco and says: \"The finest\r\nTobacco is that which pearceth quickly the odorat with a sharp\r\naromaticke smell, and tickleth the tongue with acrimonie, not\r\nunpleasant to the taste, from whence that which draweth most water is\r\nmost veituous, whether the substance of it be chewed in the mouth, or\r\nthe smoke of it received.\"\r\n\r\nHe speaks of the countries in which the plant grows, and prefers the\r\ntobacco grown in the New World as being superior to that grown in the\r\nOld. In his opinion, \"only that which is fostered in the Indies, and\r\nbrought home by Mariners and Traffiquers, is to be used.\" But not\r\nalone were Poets and Dramatists inspired to sing in praise or\r\ndispraise of tobacco, Physicians and others helped to swell in\r\nbroadsides, pamphlets and chap-books, the loudest praises or the most\r\nbitter denunciation of the weed. Taylor, the water poet, who lost his\r\noccupation as bargeman when the coach came into use, thought that the\r\ndevil brought tobacco into England in a coach. One of the first tracts\r\nwholly devoted to tobacco is entitled Nash's \"Lenten Stuffe.\" The work\r\nis dedicated to Humphrey King, a tobacconist, and is full of curious\r\nsayings in regard to the plant. Another work, entitled \"Metamorphosis\r\nof Tobacco,\" and supposed to have been written by Beaumont, made its\r\nappearance about this time. Samuel Rowlands, the dramatist, wrote two\r\nworks on tobacco; the first is entitled \"Look to it, for I'll Stabbe\r\nYe,\" written in 1604; the other volume is a small quarto, bearing this\r\nsingular title: \"A whole crew of Kind Gossips, all met to be Merry.\"\r\nThis is a satire on the time and manners of the period, and is written\r\nin a coarse style worthy of the author. In 1605 there appeared a\r\nlittle volume bearing for its title, \"Laugh and Lie Down, or the\r\nWorld's Folly.\" This work describes the fops and men of fashion of its\r\ntime, and shows how popular the custom of tobacco taking had become.\r\nIn 1609, in \"The Gull's Horne Book,\" a gallant is described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"Before the meate comes smoaking to the board our Gallant\r\n     must draw out his tobacco box, the ladle for the cold snuff\r\n     into his nostrils, the tongs and the priming iron. All this\r\n     artillery may be of gold or silver, if he can reach to the\r\n     price of it; it will be a reasonable, useful pawn at all\r\n     times when the current of his money falles out to rune low.\r\n     And here you must observe to know in what state tobacco is\r\n     in town, better than the merchants, and to discourse of the\r\n     potecaries where it is to be sold as readily as the potecary\r\n     himself.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the severest tirades against tobacco appeared in 1612, \"The\r\nCurtain Drawer of the World.\" In speaking of the users of the weed,\r\nand especially noblemen, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"Then noblemen's chimneys used to smoke, and not their\r\n     noses; Englishmen without were not Blackamoores within, for\r\n     then Tobacco was an Indian, unpickt and unpiped,--now made\r\n     the common ivy-bush of luxury, the curtaine of dishonesty,\r\n     the proclaimer of vanity, the drunken colourer of Drabby\r\n     solacy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Soule's Solace, or Thirty-and-One Spiritual Emblems,\" by\r\nThomas Jenner, occurs the following verses:\r\n\r\n  \"The Indian weed, withered quite,\r\n  Greene at noone, cut down at night,\r\n  Shows thy decay; all flesh is hay;\r\n  Thus thinke, then drinke Tobacco.\r\n\r\n  The Pipe that is so lily-white,\r\n  Show thee to be a mortal wight,\r\n  And even such, gone with a touch,\r\n  Thus thinke, then drinke Tobacco.\r\n\r\n  And when the smoake ascends on high,\r\n  Thinke thou beholdst the vanity\r\n  Of worldly stuffe, gone with a puffe,\r\n  Thus thinke, then drinke Tobacco.\r\n\r\n  And when the Pipe grows foul within,\r\n  Thinke on thy soul defiled with sin,\r\n  And then the fire it doth require;\r\n  Thus thinke, then drinke Tobacco.\r\n\r\n  The ashes that are left behind,\r\n  May serve to put thee still in mind,\r\n  That unto dust return thou must;\r\n  Thus thinke, then drinke Tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nButtes, in a little volume entitled \"Dyets Dry Dinner,\" (1599) says\r\nthat\r\n     \"Tobacco was translated out of India in the seede or roote;\r\n     native or sative in our own fruitfullest soils. It cureth\r\n     any griefe, dolour, imposture, or obstruction proceeding of\r\n     colde or winde, especially in the head or breast. The fume\r\n     taken in a pipe is good against Rumes, ache in the head,\r\n     stomacke, lungs, breast; also in want of meate, drinke,\r\n     sleepe, or rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe introduction of tobacco from the colony of Virginia was followed\r\nsoon after by a reduction of price that led to more frequent use among\r\nthe poorer classes, such as grooms and hangers on at taverns and\r\nale-houses, who are alluded to in Rich's \"Honestie of this Age\":\r\n\r\n     \"There is not so base a groome that comes into an ale-house\r\n     to call for his pott, but he must have his pipe of tobacco;\r\n     for it is a commodity that is nowe as vendible in every\r\n     tavern, wine and ale-house, as eyther wine, ale or beare;\r\n     and for apothecaerie's shops, grocer's shops, chandler's\r\n     shops, they are never without company, that from morning\r\n     till night, are still taking of tobacco. What a number are\r\n     there besides, that doe keepe houses, set open shoppes, that\r\n     have no other trade to live by, but by selling of tobacco. I\r\n     have heard it told, that now very lately there hath been a\r\n     catalogue of all those new erected houses that have sett up\r\n     that trade of selling tobacco in London, and neare about\r\n     London; and if a man may believe what is confidently\r\n     reported, there are found to be upwards of seven thousand of\r\n     houses that doth live by that trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old London Ale-house.]\r\n\r\n     \"If it be true that there be seven thousand shops in and\r\n     about London, that doth vend tobacco, as it is credibly\r\n     reported that there be over and above that number, it may\r\n     well be supposed to be but an ill customed shop, that taketh\r\n     not five shillings a day, one day with another throughout\r\n     the whole year; or, if one doth take lesse, two other may\r\n     take more; but let us make our account, but after two\r\n     shillings sixpence a day, for he that taketh lesse than that\r\n     would be ill able to pay his rent, or to keepe open his shop\r\n     windows; neither would tobacco houses make such a muster as\r\n     they do, and that almost in every lane, and in every\r\n     by-corner round about London.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Tobacco seller is described after this manner by Blount in a\r\nvolume \"Micro-Cosmographie; Or A Piece of the World discovered; in\r\nEssays and Characters\" (1628).\r\n\r\n     \"A tobacco seller is the only man that finds good in it\r\n     which others brag of, but doe not, for it is meate, drinke,\r\n     and clothes to him. No man opens his ware with greater\r\n     seriousness, or challenges your judgment more in the\r\n     operation. His Shop is the Randenvous of spitting, where men\r\n     dialogue with their noses, and their conversation is smoke.\r\n     It is the place only where Spain is commended, and preferred\r\n     before England itself.\r\n\r\n     \"He should be well experienced in the World; for he has\r\n     daily tryall as men's nostrils, and none is better\r\n     acquainted with humour. His is the piecing commonly of some\r\n     other trade, which is bawd to his Tobacco, and that to his\r\n     wife, which is the flame that follows the smoke.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the Seventeenth Century began the persecution by royal haters\r\nof the plant, others, however, had denounced the weed and its use and\r\nusers, but venting nothing more than a tirade of words against it, had\r\nbut little effect in breaking up the trade or the custom.[44] James I.\r\nsent forth his famous \"Counterblast\" and in the strongest manner\r\ncondemned its use. A portion of it reads thus:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 44: Elizabeth during her reign, published an\r\n              edict against its use, assigning as a reason, that her\r\n              subjects, by employing the same luxuries as barbarians,\r\n              were likely to degenerate into barbarism.\r\n\r\n              \"From the first introduction of the weed, the votaries\r\n              of the pipe have enjoyed all the blessings of\r\n              persecution. Kings have punished, priests have\r\n              anathematized, satirists satirized and women scolded;\r\n              but still the weed, with its divers shapes and different\r\n              names, reigns supreme among narcotics in every region of\r\n              the globe.\"--_Emerson's Magazine._]\r\n\r\n     \"Surely smoke becomes a kitchen fane better than a dining\r\n     chamber: and yet it makes a kitchen oftentimes in the inward\r\n     parts of men, soyling and injecting with an unctuous oyly\r\n     kind of roote as hath been found in some great tobacco\r\n     takers, that after death were opened. A custom loathsome to\r\n     the eye, harmful to the braine, dangerous to the lungs, and\r\n     the black stinking fume thereof, nearest resembling the\r\n     horrible Stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless.\"[45]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 45: Another writer in the same censorious\r\n              manner says of the use of tobacco, \"Smoking is the\r\n              jovial repast of Cannibals or Man-eaters, and the grand\r\n              entertainment of idolatrous Pagan Festivals. Masters\r\n              will not permit the use of it to their servants or\r\n              slaves and such as use it can hardly find masters or\r\n              buyers.\"]\r\n\r\nQuaint old Burton in his \"Anatomy of Melancholy,\" recognizes the\r\nvirtues of the plant while he anathematizes its abuse. He says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco, divine, rare, superexcellent tobacco, which goes\r\n     far beyond all their panacetas, potable gold, and\r\n     philosophers' stones, a soveraign remedy to all diseases. A\r\n     good vomit, I confesse, a vertuous herb, if it be well\r\n     qualified, opportunely taken, and medicinally used; but, as\r\n     it is commonly abused by most men, which take it as tinkers\r\n     do ale, 'tis a plague, a mischief, a violent purger of\r\n     goods, lands, health, hellish, divelish and damned tobacco,\r\n     the ruine and overthrow of body and soul.\"\r\n\r\nThe duty on importation had been only twopence per pound, a moderate\r\nsum in view of the prices realized by the sale of it.\r\n\r\nThe King now increased it to the enormous sum of two shilling and ten\r\npence. James termed the custom of using tobacco an \"evil vanitie\"\r\nimpairing \"the health of a great number of people their bodies\r\nweakened and made unfit for labor, and the estates of many mean\r\npersons so decayed and consumed, as they are thereby driven to\r\nunthriftie shifts only to maintain their gluttonous exercise\r\nthereof.\"[46] Brodigan says of the \"Counterblast:\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 46: \"King James' violent prejudices against\r\n              all use of tobacco arose from his aversion to Sir Walter\r\n              Raleigh, its first importer into England whom he\r\n              intended a sacrifice to the gratification of the King of\r\n              Spain.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"However absurd his reasoning may appear, it unfortunately\r\n     happened that he possessed the power to reduce his aversion\r\n     to practice, and he may be considered as the author of that\r\n     unwarrantable persecution of the tobacco plant, which under\r\n     varying circumstances, has been injudiciously continued to\r\n     the present time.\"\r\n\r\nOther royal haters of the plant issued the most strenous laws[47] and\r\naffixed penalties of the severest kind, of these may be mentioned the\r\nKing of Persia, Amuroth IV. of Turkey, the Emperor Jehan-Gee and Popes\r\nUrban VIII. and Innocent XII., the last of whom showed his dislike to\r\nmany other customs beside that of tobacco taking.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 47: The Empress Elizabeth was less severe. She\r\n              decreed that the snuff-boxes of those who made use of\r\n              them in church should be confiscated to the use of the\r\n              beadle.]\r\n\r\nOne of the edicts which he issued was against the taking of snuff in\r\nSt. Peters, at Rome; this was in 1690; it was, however, revoked by\r\nPope Benedict XIV., who himself had acquired the indulgence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Punishment for snuff-taking.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the Seventeenth Century tobacco found its way to\r\nConstantinople. To punish the habit, a Turk was seized and a pipe\r\ntransfixed through his nose.\r\n\r\nThe death of King James, followed by its occupancy of the throne by\r\nhis son Charles I., did not lessen the persecution against\r\ntobacco.[48] In 1625, the year of his accession, he issued a\r\nproclamation against all tobaccos excepting only the growth of\r\nVirginia and Somerites. Charles II. also prohibited the cultivation of\r\ntobacco in England and Ireland, attaching a penalty of 10£ per rood.\r\nFairholt, in alluding to the Stuarts and Cromwell as persecutors of\r\ntobacco, says:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 48: Tobacco has been able to survive such\r\n              attacks as these--nay, has raised up a host of defenders\r\n              as well as opponents. The Polish Jesuits published a\r\n              work entitled \"Anti-Misocapnus,\" in answer to King\r\n              James. In 1628, Raphael Thorius wrote a poem \"Hymnus\r\n              Tobaci.\" A host of names appear in the field: Lesus,\r\n              Braum and Simon Pauli, Portal, Pia, Vauquelin, Gardanne,\r\n              Posselt, Reimann, and De Morveau.]\r\n\r\n     \"Cromwell disliked the plant, and ordered his troops to\r\n     trample down the crop wherever found.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an historical fact that both James I. and the two Charleses as\r\nwell as Cromwell had the strongest dislike against the Indian weed.\r\n\r\nWith such powerful foes it seems hardly possible that the custom\r\nshould have increased to such an extent that when William ascended the\r\nthrone the custom was said to be almost universal.[49] \"Pipes grew\r\nlarger and ruled by a Dutchman, all England smoked in peace.\" From\r\nthis time forward the varieties used served only to increase the\r\ndemand for the tobacco of the colonies, and as its culture became\r\nbetter understood the leaf grew in favor, until the demand for it was\r\ngreater than the production.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 49: Says an enthusiastic writer on tobacco,\r\n              \"If judged by the vicissitudes through which it has\r\n              traveled, it must indeed be acknowledged a hero among\r\n              plants; and if human pity, respect, or love should be\r\n              given it for 'the dangers it has passed,' the\r\n              inspiration of Desdemonia's love for Othello, then might\r\n              its most eloquent opponent be dumb, or yield it no\r\n              inconsiderable need of homage.\"]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Anne, the custom of smoking appears to have\r\nattained its greatest height in England; the consumption of tobacco\r\nwas then proportionally greater, considering the population, than it\r\nis at the present time. Spooner, in his \"Looking-Glass for Smokers,\"\r\n1703, says of the custom:\r\n\r\n     \"The sin of the kingdom in the intemperate use of tobacco,\r\n     swelleth and increaseth so daily, that I can compare it to\r\n     nothing but the waters of Noah, that swell'd fifteen cubits\r\n     above the highest mountains. So that if this practice shall\r\n     continue to increase as it doth, in an age or two it will be\r\n     as hard to find a family free, as it was so long time since\r\n     one that commonly took it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen tobacco was first introduced into England its sale was confined\r\nto apothecaries, but afterwards it was dealt in by tobacconists, who\r\nsold other goods besides tobacco.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the Seventeenth Century the culture of tobacco\r\ncommenced in England; it continued, however, only for a short time,\r\nfor the rump parliament in 1652 prohibited the planting of it, and two\r\nyears later Cromwell and his council appointed commissioners for\r\nstrictly putting this act in execution: and in 1660 it was legally\r\nenacted, that from the first of January, 1660-1, no person whatever\r\nshould sow or plant any tobacco in England, under certain penalties.\r\n\r\nIn England drinking or smoking tobacco seems to have met with more\r\nsuccess (as a mode of use) rather than chewing (now so popular). It\r\nwas principally confined to the lower classes, and was common among\r\nsoldiers and sailors. When used by gentlemen it was common to carry a\r\nsilver basin to spit in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silver spittoons.]\r\n\r\nThe habit of smoking or using tobacco in any form was then more\r\nconstant than now, and its use was common in almost all places of\r\npublic gathering. It was the custom to smoke in theatres; stools being\r\nprovided for those who paid for their use and the privilege of smoking\r\non the stage. Tobacco was also sold at some of the play-houses, and\r\nproved a source of profit, doubtless, beyond even the representation\r\nof the plays. We should infer also from some of the early stage plays,\r\nthat the \"players\" used the weed even when acting their parts.\r\nRowlands gives the following poem on tobacco in his \"Knave of Clubs,\"\r\n1611:--\r\n\r\n  \"Who durst dispraise tobacco whilst the smoke is in my nose,\r\n  Or say, but fah! my pipe doth smell, I would I knew but those\r\n  Durst offer such indignity to that which I prefer.\r\n  For all the brood of blackamoors will swear I do not err,\r\n  In taking this same worthy whif with valiant cavalier,\r\n  But that will make his nostrils smoke, at cupps of wine or beer.\r\n  When as my purse can not afford my stomach flesh or fish,\r\n  I sop with smoke, and feed as well and fat as one can wish.\r\n  Come into any company, though not a cross you have,\r\n  Yet offer them tobacco, and their liquor you shall have.\r\n  They say old hospitalitie kept chimnies smoking still;\r\n  Now what your chimnies want of that, our smoking noses will.\r\n  Much vituals serves for gluttony, to fatten men like swine,\r\n  But he's a frugal man indeed that with a leaf can dine,\r\n  And needs no napkins for his hands, his fingers' ends to wipe,\r\n  But keeps his kitchen in a box, and roast meat in a pipe.\r\n  This is the way to help down years, a meal a day's enough:\r\n  Take out tobacco for the rest, by pipe, or else by snuff,\r\n  And you shall find it physical; a corpulent, fat man,\r\n  Within a year shall shrink so small that one his guts shall span.\r\n  It's full of physic's rare effects, it worketh sundry ways,\r\n  The leaf green, dried, steept, burnt to dust, have each their several praise,\r\n  It makes some sober that are drunk, some drunk of sober sense.\r\n  And all the moisture hurts the brain, it fetches smoking thence.\r\n  All the four elements unite when you tobacco take.\r\n  For earth and water, air and fire, do a conjunction make.\r\n  The pipe is earth, the fire's therein, the air the breathing smoke;\r\n  Good liquor must be present too, for fear I chance to choke.\r\n  Here, gentlemen, a health to all, 'Tis passing good and strong.\r\n  I would speak more, but for the pipe I cannot stay so long.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1602 appeared a sweeping tirade entitled, \"Work for Chimney\r\nSweepers, or a Warning against Tobacconists.\" It abounds with threats\r\nagainst all who indulge in tobacco. The most singular work, however,\r\nappeared in 1616, bearing the following singular title: \"The Smoking\r\nAge, or the Man in the Mist; with the Life and Death of Tobacco.\r\nDedicated to Captain Whiffe, Captain Pipe, and Captain Snuffe.\" A\r\nfrontispiece is given representing a tobacconist's shop with shelves,\r\ncounters, pipes and tobacco; a carved figure of a negro stands upon\r\nthe counter, which shows how soon such figures were used by dealers in\r\npipes and tobacco. The title-page contains the following epigram:\r\n\r\n  \"This some affirme, yet yield I not to that,\r\n  'Twill make a fat man lean, a lean man fat;\r\n  But this I'm sure (howse'ere it be they meane)\r\n  That many whiffes will make a fat man lean.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Negro Image.]\r\n\r\nThe following effusion resembles many of the verses of the day on the\r\nfruitful subject:\r\n\r\n  \"Tobacco's an outlandish weed,\r\n  Doth in the land strange wonders breed,\r\n  It taints the breath, the blood it dries,\r\n  It burns the head, it blinds the eyes;\r\n  It dries the lungs, scourgeth the lights,\r\n  It numbs the soul, it dulls the sprites;\r\n  It brings a man into a maze,\r\n  And makes him sit for other's gaze;\r\n  It makes a man, it mars a purse,\r\n  A lean one fat, a fat one worse;\r\n  A sound man sick, a sick man sound,\r\n  A bound man loose, a loose man bound;\r\n  A white man black, a black man white,\r\n  A night a day, a day a night;\r\n  The wise a fool, the foolish wise,\r\n  A sober man in drunkard's guise;\r\n  A drunkard with a drought or twain,\r\n  A sober man it makes again;\r\n  A full man empty, and an empty full,\r\n  A gentleman a foolish gull;\r\n  It turns the brain like cat in pan,\r\n  And makes a Jack a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nThe well-known song of \"Tobacco is an Indian Weed,\" was written most\r\nprobably the last half of the Seventeenth Century, Fairholt gives the\r\nbest copy we have seen of it. It is taken from the first volume of\r\n\"Pills to Purge Melancholy,\" and reads thus:\r\n\r\n  \"Tobacco's but an Indian weed,\r\n  Grows green at morn, cut down at eve,\r\n  It shows our decay, we are but clay;\r\n  Think of this when you smoke tobacco.\r\n\r\n  \"The pipe, that is so lily white,\r\n  Wherein so many take delight,\r\n  Is broke with a touch--man's life is such;\r\n  Think of this when you smoke tobacco.\r\n\r\n  \"The pipe, that is so foul within,\r\n  Shews how man's soul is stained with sin,\r\n  And then the fire it doth require;\r\n  Think of this when you smoke tobacco.\r\n\r\n  \"The ashes that are left behind\r\n  Do serve to put us all in mind\r\n  That unto dust return we must;\r\n  Think of this when you smoke tobacco.\r\n\r\n  \"The smoke, that does so high ascend,\r\n  Shews us man's life must have an end,\r\n  The Vapor's gone--man's life is done;\r\n  Think of this when you smoke tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest objections against the use of the \"Indian\r\nnovelty\" was its ruinous cost at this period. During the reign of\r\nJames The First and Charles The Second, Spanish tobacco sold at from\r\nten to eighteen shillings per pound while Virginia tobacco sold for a\r\ntime for three shillings. In no age and by no race excepting perhaps\r\nthe Indians was the habit so universal or carried to such a length as\r\nin the Seventeenth Century--its supposed virtues as a medicine induced\r\nmany to inhale the smoke constantly. This was one reason why tobacco\r\nwas condemned by so many of the writers and playwrights of the day yet\r\nmany of them used the weed in some form from Ben Johnson to Cibber the\r\none fond of his pipe the other of his snuff.\r\n\r\nIn 1639 Venner published a volume entitled \"A Treatise\" concerning the\r\ntaking of the fume of tobacco. His advice is \"to take it moderately\r\nand at fixed times.\" Many of the clergy were devoted adherents of the\r\npipe. Lilly says of its use among them:\r\n\r\n     \"In this year Bredon vicar of Thornton a profound divine,\r\n     but absolutely the most polite person for nativities in that\r\n     age, strictly adhering to Ptolemy, which he well understood;\r\n     he had a hand in composing Sir Christopher Heydon's defence\r\n     of judicial astrology, being that time his chaplain; he was\r\n     so given over to tobacco and drink, that when he had no\r\n     tobacco, he would cut the bell-ropes and smoke them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO IN EUROPE. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNeander in his work \"Tobacologia,\" (1622) gives a list of the various\r\nkinds of tobacco then used and where they were cultivated, among them\r\nare the following well known now as standard varieties of tobacco:\r\nBrazilian, St. Domingo, Orinoco, Virginia, and Trinidad tobacco.\r\nFairholt says of the latter that it was most popular in England and is\r\nfrequently named by early authors.[50] Tobacco when prepared for use\r\nwas made into long rolls or large balls which often answered for the\r\ntobacconist's sign. What we now call cut tobacco was not as popular\r\nthen as roll. Smokers carried a roll of tobacco, a knife and tinder to\r\nignite their tobacco. At the close of the Sixteenth Century tobacco\r\nwas introduced into the East. In Persia and Turkey where at first its\r\nuse was opposed by the most cruel torture it gained at length the\r\nsanction and approval of even the Sultan himself. Pallas gives the\r\nfollowing account in regard to its first introduction into Asia:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 50: Neander says that Varinas tobacco was the\r\n              best.]\r\n\r\n     \"In Asia, and especially in China, the use of tobacco for\r\n     smoking is more ancient than the discovery of the New World,\r\n     I too scarcely entertain a doubt. Among the Chinese, and\r\n     among the Mongol tribes who had the most intercourse with\r\n     them, the custom of smoking is so general, so frequent, and\r\n     become so indispensable a luxury; the tobacco purse affixed\r\n     to their belt, so necessary an article of dress; the form of\r\n     the pipes from which the Dutch seem to have taken the model\r\n     of theirs so original; and, lastly the preparation of the\r\n     yellow leaves, which are merely rubbed to pieces and then\r\n     put into the pipe, so peculiar, that we cannot possibly\r\n     derive all this from America by way of Europe; especially as\r\n     India, (where the habit of smoking is not so general,)\r\n     intervenes between Persia and China. May we not expect to\r\n     find traces of this custom in the first account of the\r\n     Voyages of the Portugese and Dutch to China? To investigate\r\n     this subject, I have indeed the inclination but not\r\n     sufficient leisure.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco and Theology.]\r\n\r\nWe find by research that smoking was the most general mode of using\r\ntobacco in England when first introduced. In France the habit of\r\nsnuffing was the most popular mode and to this day the custom is more\r\ngeneral than elsewhere. In the days of the Regency snuff-taking had\r\nattained more general popularity than any other mode of using the\r\nplant leaves; the clergy were fond of the \"dust\" and carried the most\r\nexpensive snuff boxes, while many loved the pipe and indulged in\r\ntobacco-smoking. The old vicar restored to his living enjoyed a pipe\r\nwhen seated in his chair musing on the subject of his next Sunday's\r\ndiscourse, \"with a jug of sound old ale and a huge tome of sound old\r\ndivinity on the table before him, for the occasional refreshment as\r\nwell of the bodily as the spiritual man.\"\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of tobacco in Europe was begun in Spain and Portugal.\r\nIts culture in these kingdoms as well as by their colonies brought to\r\nthe crown enormous revenues. In 1626, its culture began in France and\r\nis still an important product. A little later it began to be\r\ncultivated in Germany where it had already been used as a favorite\r\nluxury. From this time its use and cultivation extended to various\r\nparts of Europe. The Persecutors whether kings, popes, poets, or\r\ncourtiers at length gave up their opposition while many of them\r\njoined in the use and spread of the custom. It has been said with much\r\ntruth:\r\n\r\n     \"History proves that persecution never triumphs in its\r\n     attempted eradications. Tobacco was so generally liked that\r\n     no legislative measures could prevent its use.\"\r\n\r\nAt first the use of tobacco was confined to fops and the hangers on at\r\nale houses and taverns but afterwards by the \"chief men of the realm.\"\r\nSoon after the importation of the \"durned weed\" from Virginia the\r\ntobacco muse gave forth many a lay concerning the custom. The\r\nfollowing verses describe the method of smoking then in vogue:\r\n\r\n  Nor did that time know\r\n  To puff and to blow\r\n  In a peece of white clay,\r\n  As they do at this day\r\n  With fier and coole,\r\n  And a leafe in a hole;\r\n  As my ghost hath late seen,\r\n  As I walked betwene\r\n  Westminister Hall\r\n  And the church of St. Paul,\r\n  And so thorow the citie\r\n  Where I saw and did pitty\r\n  My country men's cases,\r\n  With fiery-smoke faces,\r\n  Sucking and drinking\r\n  A filthie weede stinking,\r\n  Was ne'r known before\r\n  Till the devil and the More\r\n  In th' Indies did meete,\r\n  And each other there greete\r\n  With a health they desire,\r\n  Of stinke, smoke and fier.\r\n  But who e're doth abhorre it.\r\n  The citie smookes for it;\r\n  Now full of fier shop,\r\n  And fowle spitting chop,\r\n  So sneezing and coughing,\r\n  That my ghost fell to scoffing.\r\n  And to myself said:\r\n  Here's filthie fumes made;\r\n  Good phisicke of force\r\n  To cure a sicke horse.\r\n\r\nThe Puritans, from the first introduction of the plant, were sincere\r\nhaters of tobacco, not only in England but in America. Cromwell had as\r\nstrong a dislike of the plant as King James, and ordered the troopers\r\nto destroy the crops by trampling them under foot. Hutton describes a\r\nPuritan as one who\r\n\r\n  \"Abhors a sattin suit, a velvet cloak,\r\n  And sayes tobacco is the Devill's smoke.\"\r\n\r\nProbably no other plant has ever met with such powerful determined\r\nopposition, both against its use and cultivation, as the tobacco\r\nplant. It was strenuously opposed by all possible means, governmental,\r\nlegislative, and literary. When tea and coffee were first introduced\r\nboth were denounced in unmeasured terms, but the opposition was not so\r\nbitter or as lasting.\r\n\r\nThe following verses bearing the _nom de plume_ of an \"Old Salt,\"\r\nrecord much of the history of the plant:--\r\n\r\n    \"Oh muse! grant me the power\r\n    (I have the will) to sing\r\n    How oft in lonely hour,\r\n    When storms would round me lower,\r\n    Tobacco's prov'd a King!\r\n\r\n    \"Philanthropists, no doubt\r\n    With good intentions ripe,\r\n    Their dogmas may put out,\r\n    And arrogantly shout\r\n    The evils of the pipe.\r\n\r\n    \"Kind moralists, with tracts,\r\n    Opinions fine may show:\r\n    Produce a thousand facts--\r\n    How ill tobacco acts\r\n    Man's system to o'erthrow.\r\n\r\n    \"Learn'd doctors have employed\r\n    Much patience, time and skill,\r\n    To prove tobacco cloyed\r\n    With acrid alkaloid,\r\n    With power the nerves to kill!\r\n\r\n    \"E'en Popes have curst the plant;\r\n    Kings bade its use to cease;\r\n    But all the Pontiff's rant\r\n    And Royal Jamie's cant\r\n    Ne'er made its use decrease.\r\n\r\n    \"Teetotallers may stamp\r\n    And roar at pipes and beer;\r\n    But place them in a swamp,\r\n    When nights are dark and damp--\r\n    Their tune would change, I fear.\r\n\r\n    \"No advocate am I\r\n    Of excess in one or t'other,\r\n    And ne'er essayed to try\r\n    In wine to drown a sigh,\r\n    Or a single care to smother.\r\n\r\n    \"Yet, in moderation pure,\r\n    A glass is well enough;\r\n    But, a troubled heart to cure,\r\n    Kind feelings to insure,\r\n    Give me a cheerful puff.\r\n\r\n    \"How oft a learn'd divine\r\n    His sermons will prepare,\r\n    Not by imbibing wine,\r\n    But, 'neath th' influence fine\r\n    Of a pipe of \"baccy\" rare!\r\n\r\n    \"How many a pleasing scene,\r\n    How many a happy joke,\r\n    How many a satire keen,\r\n    Or problem sharp, has been\r\n    Evolved or born of smoke!\r\n\r\n    \"How oft, amidst the jar\r\n    Of storms on ruin bent,\r\n    On ship-board, near or far,\r\n    To the drenched and shiv'ring tar\r\n    Tobacco's solace lent!\r\n\r\n    \"Oh! tell me not 'tis bad,\r\n    Or that it shortens life.\r\n    Its charms can soothe the sad,\r\n    And make the wretched glad,\r\n    In trouble and in strife.\r\n\r\n    \"Tis used in every clime,\r\n    By all men, high and low;\r\n    It is praised in prose and rhyme,\r\n    So let the kind herb grow!\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis a friend to the distress'd,\r\n    'Tis a comforter in need;\r\n    It is social, soothing, blest;\r\n    It has fragrance, force, and zest;\r\n    Then hail the kingly weed!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Raleigh[51] and many of Elizabeth's courtiers indulged\r\nfrequently in a pipe, some have imagined that even Queen Bess herself\r\ntested the rare virtues of tobacco. This is hardly based upon\r\nsufficient proof to warrant a very strong belief in it; but the\r\nfollowing account of \"How to weigh smoke\" taken from _Tinsley's\r\nMagazine_ shows that the Queen was acquainted at least with Raleigh's\r\nuse of the weed:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 51: It is said that Raleigh in communicating\r\n              the art to his friends, gave smoking parties at his\r\n              house, where his guests were treated with nothing but a\r\n              pipe, a mug of ale, and a nutmeg. Says an English\r\n              writer: \"From the anecdote related respecting the weight\r\n              of smoke, the vapor of the pipe certainly did not throw\r\n              a cloud over the brilliant wit of the unfortunate\r\n              Raleigh.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"One day it happened that Queen Elizabeth, wandering about\r\n     the grounds and alleys at Hampton with a single maid of\r\n     honour, came upon Sir Walter Raleigh indulging in a pipe.\r\n     Smoking now is as common as eating and drinking, and to\r\n     smoke amongst ladies is a vulgarity. But not so then: it was\r\n     an accomplishment, it was a distinction; and one of the\r\n     feathers in Sir Walter's towering cap was his introduction\r\n     of tobacco. The all-accomplished hero rose and saluted the\r\n     Queen in his grand manner, and the Queen, who was in her\r\n     daintiest humour, gave him her white hand to kiss, and took\r\n     the seat he had left.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, Sir Walter, I can puzzle you at last.\" \"I suppose I\r\n     must not be so rude as to doubt your Majesty.\" \"You are bold\r\n     enough for that, but your boldness will not help you, Sir\r\n     Walter, this time. You cannot tell me how much the smoke\r\n     from your pipe weighs.\" \"Your Majesty is mistaken. I can\r\n     tell you to a nicety. Will your Majesty allow me to call\r\n     yonder page, and send for a pair of scales and weights?\" \"By\r\n     my honour,\" said the Queen, \"were any other subject in our\r\n     realm to make request so absurd, we should very positively\r\n     deny it. But you are the wisest of our fools, and, though we\r\n     expect to see but little use made of these weights when\r\n     brought, your request shall be granted. And, supposing you\r\n     fail to weigh the smoke, what penalty will you pay?\" \"I will\r\n     be content,\" said Sir Walter, \"to lose my head.\" \"You may\r\n     chance to lose it on a graver count than this;\" answered the\r\n     Queen. \"If the head shall have done some slight service to\r\n     your Majesty and the realm,\" replied the courteous knight,\r\n     \"thee will be well content nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Weighing smoke.]\r\n\r\n     \"But your Majesty will soon see that I fail not. First,\r\n     madam, I place this empty pipe in the scales, and I find\r\n     that it weighs exactly 2 ounces. I now fill it with tobacco,\r\n     and the weight is increased to 2-1/10th ounce. I must now\r\n     ask your Majesty to allow me to smoke the pipe out. I shall\r\n     then turn out the ashes, and place them together with the\r\n     pipe in the scale once more. The difference between the\r\n     weight of the pipe with the unsmoked tobacco, and weight of\r\n     the pipe with the ashes, will be the weight of the smoke.\"\r\n     \"You are too clever for us, Sir Walter. We shall expect you\r\n     to-night at supper, and if the conversation grow dull, you\r\n     shall tell our courtiers the story of the pipe.\"\r\n\r\nMany other anecdotes have been told of the adventures of Raleigh with\r\nhis pipe. One is that while taking a quiet smoke his servant entered\r\nand becoming alarmed on seeing the smoke coming from his nose threw a\r\nmug of ale in his face.\r\n\r\nThe same anecdote is also related of others including Tarlton. He\r\ngives an account of it in his Jests 1611. It is told in this manner:\r\n\r\n     \"Tarlton as other gentlemen used, at the first coming up of\r\n     tobacco, did take it more for fashion's sake than otherwise,\r\n     and being in a roome, sat betweene two men overcome with\r\n     wine, and they never seeing the like, wondered at it, and\r\n     seeing the vapour come out of Tarlton's nose, cryed out,\r\n     'Fire, fire!' and threw a cup of wine in Tarlton's face.\r\n     'Make no more stirre,' quoth Tarlton, 'the fire is quenched;\r\n     if the sheriffs come, it will turne a fine as the custom\r\n     is.' And drinking that againe, 'Fie,' says the other: 'what\r\n     a stinke it makes. I am almost poysoned.' 'If it offend,'\r\n     quoth Tarlton, 'let's every one take a little of the smell,\r\n     and so the savor, will quickly go;' but tobacco whiffes made\r\n     them leave him to pay all.\"\r\n\r\nRich gives the following account of a similar scene:--\r\n\r\n     \"I remember a pretty jest of tobacco which was this: A\r\n     certain Welchman coming newly to London, and beholding one\r\n     to take tobacco, never seeing the like before, and not\r\n     knowing the manner of it, but perceiving him vent smoke so\r\n     fast, and supposing his inward parts to be on fire, cried\r\n     out, 'O Jhesu, Jhesu man, for the passion of Cod hold, for\r\n     by Cod's splud ty snowt's on fire,' and having a bowle of\r\n     beere in his hand, threw it at the other's face, to quench\r\n     his smoking nose.\"\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote is equally ludicrous. Before tobacco was much\r\nknown in Germany, some soldiers belonging to a cavalry regiment were\r\nquartered in a German village. One of them, a trumpeter, happened to\r\nbe a negro. A peasant, who had never seen a black man before, and who\r\nknew nothing about tobacco, watched, though at a safe distance, the\r\ntrumpeter, while the latter groomed and fed his horse. As soon as this\r\nbusiness was dispatched, the negro filled his pipe and began to smoke\r\nit. Great had been the peasant's bewilderment before; great was his\r\nterror now. The terror reached an intolerable point when the negro\r\ntook the pipe from his mouth, offered it to the peasant, and asked\r\nhim, in the best language he could command, to take a whiff. \"No, no!\"\r\ncried the peasant, in exceeding alarm; \"no, no! Mr. Devil; I do not\r\nwish to eat fire.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Fielding, in \"The Grub Street Opera\" written about a century\r\nago, has the following verses on Tobacco:--\r\n\r\n   \"Let the learned talk of books,\r\n    The glutton of cooks,\r\n  The lover of Celia's soft smack--O!\r\n    No mortal can boast\r\n    So noble a toast,\r\n  As a pipe of accepted tobacco.\r\n\r\n   \"Let the soldier for fame,\r\n    And a general's name,\r\n  In battle get many a thwack--O!\r\n    Let who will have most\r\n    Who will rule the rooste,\r\n  Give me but a pipe of tobacco.\r\n\r\n   \"Tobacco gives wit\r\n    To the dullest old cit,\r\n  And makes him of politics crack--O!\r\n    The lawyers i' th' hall\r\n    Were not able to bawl,\r\n  Were it not for a whiff of tobacco.\r\n\r\n   \"The man whose chief glory\r\n    Is telling a story,\r\n  Had never arrived at the smack--O!\r\n    Between every heying,\r\n    And as I was saying,\r\n  Did he not take a whiff of tobacco.\r\n\r\n   \"The doctor who places\r\n    Much skill in grimaces,\r\n  And feels your pulse running tic tack--O!\r\n    Would you know his chief skill?\r\n    It is only to fill\r\n  And smoke a good pipe of tobacco.\r\n\r\n   \"The courtiers alone\r\n    To this weed are not prone;\r\n  Would you know what 'tis makes them so slack--O?\r\n    'Twas because it inclined\r\n    To be honest the mind,\r\n  And therefore they banished tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious pieces of verse ever written on tobacco is the\r\nfollowing by Southey, entitled \"Elegy on a Quid of Tobacco:\"--\r\n\r\n    \"It lay before me on the close-grazed grass,\r\n      Beside my path, an old tobacco quid:\r\n    And shall I by the mute adviser pass\r\n      Without one serious thought? now Heaven forbid!\r\n\r\n    \"Perhaps some idle drunkard threw thee there--\r\n      Some husband spendthrift of his weekly hire;\r\n    One who for wife and children takes no care,\r\n      But sits and tipples by the ale-house fire.\r\n\r\n    \"Ah! luckless was the day he learned to chew!\r\n      Embryo of ills the quid that pleased him first;\r\n    Thirsty from that unhappy quid he grew,\r\n      Then to the ale-house went to quench his thirst.\r\n\r\n    \"So great events from causes small arise--\r\n      The forest oak was once an acorn seed;\r\n    And many a wretch from drunkenness who dies,\r\n      Owes all his evils to the Indian weed.\r\n\r\n    \"Let no temptation, mortal, ere come nigh!\r\n      Suspect some ambush in the parsley hid;\r\n    From the first kiss of love ye maidens fly,\r\n      Ye youths, avoid the first Tobacco-quid!\r\n\r\n    \"Perhaps I wrong thee, O thou veteran chaw,\r\n      And better thoughts my musings should engage;\r\n    That thou wert rounded in some toothless jaw,\r\n      The joy, perhaps of solitary age.\r\n\r\n    \"One who has suffered Fortune's hardest knocks,\r\n      Poor, and with none to tend on his gray hairs;\r\n    Yet has a friend in his Tobacco-box,\r\n      And, while he rolls his quid, forgets his cares.\r\n\r\n    \"Even so it is with human happiness--\r\n      Each seeks his own according to his whim;\r\n    One toils for wealth, one Fame alone can bless,\r\n      One asks a quid--a quid is all to him.\r\n\r\n    \"O, veteran chaw! thy fibres savory, strong,\r\n      While aught remained to chew, thy master chewed,\r\n    Then cast thee here, when all thy juice was gone,\r\n      Emblem of selfish man's ingratitude!\r\n\r\n    \"O, happy man! O, cast-off quid! is he\r\n      Who, like as thou, has comforted the poor;\r\n    Happy his age who knows himself, like thee,\r\n      Thou didst thy duty--man can do no more.\"\r\n\r\nAnother well known song of the Seventeenth Century is entitled \"The\r\nTryumph of Tobacco over Sack and Ale:\"--\r\n\r\n     Nay, soft by your leaves,\r\n     Tobacco bereaves\r\n  You both of the garland; forbear it;\r\n     You are two to one,\r\n     Yet tobacco alone\r\n  Is like both to win it, and weare it.\r\n     Though many men crack,\r\n     Some of ale, some of sack,\r\n  And think they have reason to do it;\r\n     Tobacco hath more\r\n     That will never give o'er\r\n  The honor they do unto it.\r\n     Tobacco engages\r\n     Both sexes, all ages,\r\n  The poor as well as the wealthy;\r\n     From the court to the cottage,\r\n     From childhood to dotage,\r\n  Both those that are sick and the healthy.\r\n     It plainly appears\r\n     That in a few years\r\n  Tobacco more custom hath gained,\r\n     Than sack, or than ale,\r\n     Though they double the tale\r\n  Of the times, wherein they have reigned.\r\n     And worthily too,\r\n     For what they undo\r\n  Tobacco doth help to regaine,\r\n     On fairer conditions\r\n     Than many physitians,\r\n  Puts an end to much griefe and paine;\r\n     It helpeth digestion,\r\n     Of that there's no question,\r\n  The gout and the tooth-ache it easeth:\r\n     Be it early, or late,\r\n     'Tis never out of date,\r\n  He may-safely take it that pleaseth.\r\n     Tobacco prevents\r\n     Infection by scents,\r\n  That hurt the brain, and are heady.\r\n     An antidote is,\r\n     Before you're amisse,\r\n  As well as an after remedy.\r\n     The cold it doth heate,\r\n     Cools them that do sweate,\r\n  And them that are fat maketh lean:\r\n     The hungry doth feed,\r\n     And if there be need,\r\n  Spent spirits restoreth again.\r\n     The poets of old,\r\n     Many fables have told,\r\n  Of the gods and their symposia;\r\n     But tobacco alone,\r\n     Had they known it, had gone\r\n  For their nectar and ambrosia.\r\n      It is not the smack\r\n      Of ale or of sack,\r\n  That can with tobacco compare:\r\n      For taste and for smell,\r\n      It beares away the bell\r\n  From them both, wherever they are:\r\n      For all their bravado,\r\n      It is Trinidado,\r\n  That both their noses will wipe\r\n      Of the praises they desire,\r\n      Unless they conspire\r\n  To sing to the tune of his pipe.\r\n\r\nThe history of the rise and progress of tobacco in England, is one of\r\nthe most interesting features connected with the use and cultivation\r\nof the plant. In Spain, Portugal, Germany and Holland the plant was\r\nsustained and encouraged by the throne, and royalty was the strongest\r\nand most devoted defender it had. It saw in the encouragement of its\r\nuse, an income of revenue and a source of profit far greater than that\r\nreceived from any other product. Soon after its cultivation began in\r\nFrance, Spain, and Portugal, the tobacco trade was farmed out.\r\n\r\nFrom its first cultivation in these countries it has been a government\r\nmonopoly. In 1753, the King of Portugal farmed out the tobacco trade,\r\nand from that time until now, the annual amount received has been one\r\nof the principal sources of revenue to the crown. In France, as early\r\nas 1674, a monopoly of the trade was granted to Jean Breton, for six\r\nyears, for the sum of 700,000 francs.\r\n\r\nIn 1720 the Indian Company paid for the privilege 1,500,000 francs per\r\nannum; and in 1771 the price was increased to 25,000,000 francs.\r\nBesides France there are thirteen other European states where the\r\ntobacco trade is a government monopoly, namely, Austria, Spain,\r\nSicily, Sardinia, Poland, Papal States, Portugal, Tuscany, Modena,\r\nParma, San Marino, Lichtenstein.\r\n\r\nFrom the first cultivation of the plant, its growers saw in the\r\ntobacco trade a vast and constantly increasing source of wealth.\r\nThey doubtless in some measure comprehended the close relation\r\nexisting between it and commerce and realized how extensive would be\r\nits use.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the plant, it affords states and nations an\r\nopportunity to engage either in its culture or commerce with the\r\nprospect of the largest success. In this respect it is far different\r\nfrom any other tropical plant, and unlike them is capable of being\r\ncultivated in portions of the earth far remote from the tropics. In\r\nSwitzerland and in the Caucassias it attains to a considerable size,\r\nbut is nevertheless tobacco although it may possess but few of the\r\nexcellences of some varieties, still it affords some enjoyment to the\r\nuser, from the fact that it is the Indian weed. Fairholt speaking of\r\nthe tobacco trade says:\r\n\r\n     \"The progress of the tobacco trade from the earliest\r\n     introduction of the plant into Europe until now, is\r\n     certainly one of the most curious that commerce presents.\r\n     That a plant originally smoked by a few savages, should\r\n     succeed in spite of the most stringent opposition in church\r\n     and state, to be the cherished luxury of the whole civilized\r\n     world; to increase with the increase of time, and to end in\r\n     causing so vast a trade, and so large an outlay of money; is\r\n     a statistical fact, without an equal parallel.\"\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant notwithstanding its fascinating powers, has suffered\r\nmany romantic vicissitudes in its fame and character; having been\r\nsuccessively opposed and commended by physicians, condemned and\r\neulogized by priests, vilified and venerated by kings, and alternately\r\nproscribed and protected by governments, this once insignificant\r\nproduction of a little island or an obscure district, has succeeded in\r\ndiffusing itself throughout every clime, and--exhilarating and\r\nenriching its thousands--has subjected the inhabitants of every\r\ncountry to its dominion. And every where it is a source of comfort and\r\nenjoyment; in the highest grades of civilized society, at the shrine\r\nof fashion, in the depths of poverty, in the palace and in the\r\ncottage, the fascinating influence of this singular plant demands an\r\nequal tribute of devotion and attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO-PIPES, SMOKING AND SMOKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe implements used in smoking tobacco, from the rude pipe of the\r\nIndian to the elaborate hookah of the Turk, show a far greater variety\r\nthan even the various species of the tobacco plant. The instruments\r\nused by the Indians for inhaling the tobacco smoke were no less\r\nwonderful to Europeans than the plant itself.\r\n\r\nThe rude mode of inhaling the smoke and the intoxication produced by\r\nits fumes suggested to the Spaniards a better method of \"taking\r\ntobacco.\" Hariot, however, found clay pipes in use by the Indians of\r\nVirginia, which though having no resemblance to the smoking implements\r\ndiscovered by Columbus, seem to have afforded a model for those\r\nafterward manufactured by the Virginia colony. The sailors of Columbus\r\nseemed to have first discovered cigar, rather than pipe-smoking,\r\ninasmuch as the simple method used by the natives, consisted of a leaf\r\nof maize, which enwrapped a few leaves of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe next instruments discovered in use among the Indians were\r\nstraight, hollow reeds and forked canes. Their mode of use was to\r\nplace a few leaves upon coals of fire and by placing the forked end in\r\nthe nostrils and the other upon the smoking leaves, to inhale the\r\nsmoke until they were stupified or drunken with the fumes. Their\r\nobject in inhaling the fumes of tobacco seemed to be to produce\r\nintoxication and insensibility rather than a mode of enjoyment,\r\nalthough the enjoyment with them consisted of seeing the most\r\nremarkable visions when stupefied by its fumes. Such were the modes\r\nof smoking among the Indians when Columbus planted the banner of Spain\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nA writer in _The Tobacco Plant_ has given a very interesting\r\ndescription of Indian pipes in use among the natives of both North and\r\nSouth America. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"In the tumuli or Indian grave mounds of the Ohio and Scioto\r\n     valleys, large quantities of pipes have been found, bearing\r\n     traces of Indian ingenuity. That their burial mounds are of\r\n     great antiquity, is proved by the fact that trees several\r\n     centuries old are to be found growing upon them. About\r\n     twenty-five years ago, two distinguished archeologists\r\n     Squier and Davis--made extensive exploration of these\r\n     mounds, the results of which were published in an elaborate\r\n     memoir by the Smithsonian Institution. The mounds indicate\r\n     that an immense amount of labor has been expended upon them,\r\n     as the earthworks and mounds may be counted by thousands,\r\n     requiring either long time or an immense population; and\r\n     there is much probability in the supposition of Sir John\r\n     Lubbock that these parts of America were once inhabited by a\r\n     numerous and agricultural population. It may be asked, have\r\n     the races who erected these extensive mounds become extinct,\r\n     or do they exist in the poor uncivilized tribes of Indians\r\n     whom Europeans found inhabiting the river valleys of Ohio\r\n     and Illinois? Many of these mounds are in the form of\r\n     serpents and symbolic figures, and were evidently related to\r\n     the sacrificial worship of the mound builders.\"\r\n\r\nSquier and Davis are of the opinion that:--\r\n\r\n     \"The mound builders were inveterate smokers, if the great\r\n     numbers of pipes discovered in the mounds be admitted as\r\n     evidence of the fact. These constitute not only a numerous,\r\n     but a singularly interesting class of remains. In their\r\n     construction the skill of the maker seems to have been\r\n     exhausted. Their general form, which may be regarded as the\r\n     primitive form of the implement, is well exhibited in the\r\n     accompanying sketch. They are always carved from a single\r\n     piece, and consist of a flat carved bore of variable length\r\n     and width, with the bowl rising from the centre of the\r\n     convex side. From one of the ends, and communicating with\r\n     the hollow of the bowl, is drilled a small hole, which\r\n     answers the purpose of a tube; the corresponding opposite\r\n     division being left for the manifest purpose of holding the\r\n     implement to the mouth.\r\n\r\n     \"The specimen here represented is finely carved from a\r\n     beautiful variety of brown porphyry, granulated with\r\n     various-colored materials, the whole much changed by the\r\n     action of fire, and somewhat resembling porcelain. It is\r\n     intensely hard, and successfully resists the edge of the\r\n     finest-tempered knife. The length of the base is five\r\n     inches; breadth of the same one inch and a-quarter. The bowl\r\n     is one inch and a-quarter high, slightly tapering upwards,\r\n     but flaring near the top. The hollow of the bowl is\r\n     six-tenths of an inch in diameter. The perforation answering\r\n     to the tube is one-sixth of an inch in diameter, which is\r\n     about the usual size. This circumstance places it beyond\r\n     doubt that the mouth was applied directly to the implement,\r\n     without the intervention of a tube of wood or metal.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Indian pipe.]\r\n\r\nThis is an account of a simple pipe, with a small bowl; but most of\r\nthe pipes found in the mounds are highly ornamented with elaborate\r\nworkmanship, representing animals such as the beaver, otter, bear,\r\nwolf, panther, raccoon, squirrel, wild-cat, manotee, eagle, hawk,\r\nheron, swallow, paroquet, etc. One of the most interesting of the\r\nspirited sculptures of animal forms to be found on the mound pipes, is\r\nthe representation of the Lamantin, or Manotee, a cetacean found only\r\nin tropical waters, and the nearest place which they at present\r\nfrequent is the coast of Florida--at least a thousand miles away.\r\nAccording to Sir John Lubbock, these are no rude sculptures, for the\r\ncharacteristics of the animal are all distinctly marked, rendering its\r\nrecognition complete. Many modern Indians are possessed of a wonderful\r\naptitude for sculpture, and they appear to gladly exchange their work\r\nfor the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nThe material most prized for the purpose of pipe-making is the\r\nbeautiful red pipe-stone of the Coteau des Prairies, which is an\r\nindurated aluminous stone, highly colored with red oxide of iron. It\r\nis frequently called \"Catlinite,\" out of compliment to George Catlin,\r\nthe distinguished collector of Indian traditions, who claims to be the\r\nfirst European that ever visited the Red Pipe-stone Quarry, which is\r\nsituated amongst the upper waters of Missouri. Catlin gives the\r\nfollowing legend as the Indian version of the birth of the mysterious\r\nred pipe:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Great Spirit, at an ancient period, here called\r\n     together the Indian warriors, and standing on the precipice\r\n     of the red pipe-stone rock, broke from its wall a piece, and\r\n     made a huge pipe by turning it in his hand, which he smoked\r\n     over them, and to the north, the south, the east and the\r\n     west; and told them that this stone was red, that it was\r\n     their flesh, that they must use it for their pipes of peace,\r\n     that it belonged to them all, and that the war club and the\r\n     scalping knife must not be raised on its ground. At the last\r\n     whiff of his pipe his head went into a great cloud, and the\r\n     whole surface of the rock for several miles was melted and\r\n     glazed. Two great ovens were opened beneath, and two women,\r\n     guardian spirits of the place, entered them in a blaze of\r\n     fire, and they are heard there yet, answering to the\r\n     invocations of the priests and medicine-men.\"\r\n\r\nAt the pipe-stone quarry there is a row of five huge, granite\r\nboulders, which the Indians regard with great reverence, and when they\r\nvisit the spot to secure some red stone to make pipes, they seek to\r\npropitiate the guardian spirits by throwing plugs of Tobacco to them.\r\nSome admirable pieces of pipe-sculpture are produced by the Boheen\r\nIndians, who are found on the coast of the Pacific to the south of the\r\nRussians. These pipes are made from a soft blue clay stone which is\r\nfound only in slabs, and the sculptures are wrought on both sides, the\r\npipes being generally covered with singular groups of human and animal\r\nforms, grotesquely intermingled.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewas are also celebrated for their pipes, which are cut out\r\nof a close-grained stone of a dark color; and Professor Wilson, of\r\nToronto, states that Pobahmesad, or the Flier, one of the famed\r\npipe-sculptors, resides on the Great Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron.\r\nThe old Chippewa has never deviated from the faith of his fathers, as\r\nhe still adheres to all their rites and ceremonies. He uses the red\r\npipe-stone and other materials in the production of his pipes, which\r\nare ingenious specimens of sculpture. The calumet, or pipe of peace,\r\nis still an object of special reverence with the Indian tribes, and\r\nthe pipe-stem is ornamented with six or eight eagle's feathers. Each\r\ntribe has an official who takes charge of the calumet, which he keeps\r\nrolled up in a bearskin robe; and it's never exposed to view or used,\r\nexcept when the chief enters into a treaty with some neighboring\r\nchief. On these occasions the pipe is taken out of its covering by the\r\nIndian dignitary, ready charged with the \"holy weed,\" when it is\r\nsmoked by all the chiefs, each one taking only a single breath of\r\nsmoke, which is regarded as implementing the treaty. The pipe is then\r\nrolled up in its robe of fur, and stowed away in the lodge of its\r\nkeeper until it is again required. The war pipe is simply a tomahawk,\r\nwith a perforated handle communicating with the bowl, which is\r\nopposite the sharp edge of the weapon. When the Indians joined the\r\nBritish as allies during the American war, they had to be supplied\r\nwith iron tomahawks of the native pattern, before they could enter the\r\nfield as allies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sculptured pipe.]\r\n\r\nMany tribes of Indians use herbs of various kinds to mix with tobacco\r\nto reduce its strength, as they are in the habit of exhaling the smoke\r\nfrom the nostrils, and not from the mouth. By the adoption of this\r\nmeans a much smaller quantity of tobacco suffices to produce the\r\nsoothing influence on the nervous system so well known to votaries of\r\nthe weed.\r\n\r\nLongfellow, in his great Indian epic of the Song of Hiawatha, has\r\nportrayed with graphic power in pleasing verse the mysterious legends\r\ndescribing the birth or institution of the peace-pipe by Gitche\r\nManito, \"The Master of Life;\" and a few extracts from \"Hiawatha\" may\r\nbe interesting to illustrate the deep significance of the ideas which\r\nthe Indian holds regarding his relations to the Great Spirit of the\r\nUniverse, and of the esteem with which he views the peace-pipe, which\r\nin the words of Catlin \"has shed its thrilling fumes over the land,\r\nand soothed the fury of the relentless savage.\"\r\n\r\nLongfellow, in the opening of his poem, says:--\r\n\r\n  Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple,\r\n  Who have faith in God and Nature,\r\n  Who believe that in all ages\r\n  Every human heart is human,\r\n  That in even savage bosoms\r\n  There are longings, yearnings, strivings,\r\n  For the good they comprehend not,\r\n  That the feeble hands and helpless,\r\n  Groping blindly in the darkness,\r\n  Touch God's right hand in that darkness\r\n  And are lifted up and strengthened;--\r\n  Listen to this simple story,\r\n  To the song of Hiawatha.\r\n\r\nHe then describes the making of the pipe from the great Red Pipe-Stone\r\nQuarry, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"On the Mountains of the Prairie,\r\n  On the great Red Pipe-Stone Quarry,\r\n  Gitche Manito, the mighty,\r\n  He the Master of Life, descending,\r\n  On the red crags of the quarry\r\n  Stood erect, and called the nations,\r\n  Called the tribes of men together.\r\n  From his foot-prints flowed a river,\r\n  Leaped into the light of morning,\r\n  O'er the precipice plunging downward\r\n  Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.\r\n  And the Spirit stooping earthward,\r\n  With his finger on the meadow\r\n  Traced a winding pathway for it,\r\n  Saying to it, 'Run in this way!'\r\n\r\n  \"From the red stone of the quarry\r\n  With his hand he broke a fragment,\r\n  Moulded it into a pipe-head,\r\n  Shaped and fashioned it with figures;\r\n  From the margin of the river\r\n  Took a long reed for a pipe-stem,\r\n  With its dark green leaves upon it;\r\n  Filled the pipe with bark of willow;\r\n  With the bark of the red willow;\r\n  Breathed upon the neighboring forest,\r\n  Made its great boughs chafe together,\r\n  Till in flame they burst and kindled;\r\n  And erect upon the mountains,\r\n  Gitche Manito, the mighty,\r\n  Smoked the calumet, the Peace-Pipe,\r\n  As a signal to the nations.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pipe of Peace.]\r\n\r\nThe next verses describe the assembling of the nations at the call of\r\nGitche Manito, who proceeds to speak to his children words of wisdom\r\nand announces that he:\r\n\r\n  \"'Will send a prophet to you,\r\n  A Deliverer of the nations,\r\n  Who shall guide you and shall teach you,\r\n  Who shall toil and suffer with you.\r\n  So you listen to his counsels,\r\n  You will multiply and prosper;\r\n  If his warnings pass unheeded,\r\n  You will fade away and perish!\r\n\r\n  \"'Bathe now in the stream before you,\r\n  Wash the war-paint from your faces,\r\n  Wash the blood-stains from your fingers,\r\n  Bury your war-clubs and your weapons,\r\n  Break the red stone from this quarry,\r\n  Mould and make it into Peace-Pipes,\r\n  Take the reeds that grow beside you,\r\n  Deck them with your highest feathers,\r\n  Smoke the calumet together,\r\n  And as brothers live henceforward!'\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"And in silence all the warriors\r\n  Broke the red stone of the quarry,\r\n  Smoothed and formed it into Peace-Pipes,\r\n  Broke the long reeds by the river,\r\n  Decked them with their brightest feathers,\r\n  And departed each one homeward,\r\n  While the Master of Life, ascending\r\n  Through the opening of cloud curtains,\r\n  Through the doorways of the heavens,\r\n  Vanished from before their faces,\r\n  In the smoke that rolled around him,\r\n  The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe!\"\r\n\r\nAlong the northern parts of America, are to be found the Esquimaux\r\npopulation, estimated to number about 60,000.\r\n\r\nThey are votaries of the weed, making their pipes either out of\r\ndriftwood, or of the bones of animals they have used for food.\r\n\r\nTobacco is found growing along the whole western sea-board of South\r\nAmerica until we reach the northern boundaries of Patagonia. Far\r\ninland on the banks of the Amazon, Rio Niger, and other great rivers,\r\nthe weed has been found in luxurious abundance, with a delightful\r\nfragrance.\r\n\r\n     Stephens, in his \"Travels in Central America,\" says that\r\n     \"the ladies of Central America generally smoke--the married\r\n     using tobacco, and the unmarried, cigars formed of selected\r\n     tobacco rolled in paper or rice straw. Every gentleman\r\n     carries in his pocket a silver case, with a long string of\r\n     cotton, steel and flint, and one of the offices of gallantry\r\n     is to strike a light. By doing it well, he may help to\r\n     kindle a flame in a lady's heart; at all events, to do it\r\n     bunglingly would be ill-bred. I will not express my\r\n     sentiments on smoking as a custom for the sex. I have\r\n     recollections of beauteous lips profaned. Nevertheless, even\r\n     in this I have seen a lady show her prettiness and\r\n     refinement, barely touching the straw on her lips, as it\r\n     were kissing it gently and taking it away. When a gentleman\r\n     asks a lady for a light, she always removes the cigar from\r\n     her lips.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Canon Kingsley, in his fascinating novel of \"Westward Ho!\"\r\nhas some quaint remarks on the method of smoking described by Lionel\r\nWafer, surgeon to Dampier, which are well worth quoting. He says,\r\n     \"When they, (the Darien Indians,) will deliberate on war or\r\n     policy, they sit round in the hut of the chief; where being\r\n     placed, enter to them a small boy with a cigarro of the\r\n     bigness of a rolling-pin, and puffs the smoke thereof into\r\n     the face of each warrior, from the eldest to the youngest;\r\n     while they, putting their hands funnel-wise round their\r\n     mouths, draw into the sinuosities of the brain that more\r\n     than Delphic vapor of prophecy; which boy presently falls\r\n     down in a swoon, and being dragged out by the heels and laid\r\n     by to sober, enter another to puff at the sacred cigarro,\r\n     till he is dragged out likewise, and so on till the Tobacco\r\n     is finished, and the seed of wisdom has sprouted in every\r\n     soul into the tree of meditation, bearing the flower of\r\n     eloquence, and in due time the fruit of valiant action.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Model Cigar.]\r\n\r\nTobacco in the form of cigarettes, is extensively used by the\r\ninhabitants of Nicaragua, Guiana, and the dwellers on the banks of the\r\nOrinoco, and the use of the weed is not confined to the male sex, but\r\nis freely used both by the female and juvenile portions of the\r\ncommunity. Mr. Squier, in his \"Travels in Nicaragua,\" states that the\r\ndress of the young urchins consists mainly of a straw hat and a\r\ncigar--the cigar when not in use being stuck behind the ear, in the\r\nmanner in which our clerks place their pens. The natives of Guiana use\r\na tube or pipe not unlike a cheroot, made from the rind of the fruit\r\nof a species of palm. This curious pipe is called a \"Winna,\" and the\r\nhollow is filled with tobacco, the smoking of which affords much\r\nenjoyment to the denizens of the swampy regions of Guiana.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooke, in \"The Seven Sisters of Sleep,\" states that a tube much\r\nresembling the \"Winna\" of Guiana was some years ago to be met with in\r\nthe Tobacconists' Shops in London. The Indian dwelling in the dense\r\nforests in the region of Orinoco has found that tobacco is an\r\nexcellent solace to relieve the monotony of his life; he uses it \"not\r\nonly to procure an afternoon nap, but also to induce a state of\r\nquiescence which they call dreaming with their eyes open.\" We find\r\nfrom voyagers up the Amazon, that smoking prevails not merely amongst\r\nthe natives inhabiting the regions which skirt that great river, but\r\nalso amongst the people on the banks of its numerous tributaries. Mr.\r\nBates the distinguished Naturalist, when making researches far up one\r\nof the tributaries of the Amazon, found tobacco extensively\r\ncultivated, and some distinguished makers of cigarettes. One maker,\r\nJoan Trinidade, was noted for his Tobacco and Tauri cigarettes. This\r\ncigar is so named from the bark in which the tobacco is rolled. Some\r\nof the tribes inhabiting the district of the lower Amazon indulge in\r\nsnuff-taking. This snuff is not made from tobacco, it is the produce\r\nof a plant of the leguminous order, the seeds being carefully\r\ncollected and thoroughly dried in the sun before they are pounded in a\r\nmortar, when the powder is ready for use. The snuff-making season is\r\nquite an event in a Brazilian village, the week or so during which it\r\nlasts forming a kind of religious festival mingled with a good deal of\r\nindulgence of fermented liquors, chiefly of native origin.\r\n\r\nHumboldt, when traveling in South America, found in use among the\r\nOttomac Indians a powder called Niopo, or \"Indian snuff.\" Niopo is a\r\npowerful stimulant, a small portion of it producing violent sneezing\r\nin persons unaccustomed to its use. Father Gumilla says:--\"This\r\ndiabolical powder of the Ottomacs, furnished by an adolescent tobacco\r\nplant, intoxicates them through the nostrils, deprives them of reason\r\nfor some hours, and renders them furious in battle.\" Humboldt,\r\nhowever, has shown that this stimulating snuff is not the product of\r\nthe tobacco plant, but of a species of acacia, Niopo being made from\r\nthe pods of the plant after they have undergone a process of\r\nfermentation. Captain Burton, when traveling in the Highlands of\r\nBrazil, found the tobacco plant growing spontaneously, which made him\r\nconclude that it is indigenous to Brazil. He found the \"Aromatic\r\nBrazilian\" a kind of tobacco with thin leaves and a pink flower, which\r\nis \"much admired in the United States, and there found to lose its\r\naroma after the second year.\" It is usually asserted that the tobacco\r\ngrown in Brazil contains only two per cent. of nicotine, but Captain\r\nBurton is disposed to doubt this, as he states that some varieties of\r\nthe \"holy herb\" grown at Sa'a' Paulo and Nimos suggests a larger\r\nproportion. In the small towns in the Highlands of Brazil, Captain\r\nBurton found that excellent cigars, better than many \"Havannas,\" were\r\nretailed at a halfpenny each. In La Plata, Paraguay, and other\r\ncountries to the south of Brazil, nearly every person smokes, and an\r\nAmerican traveler quoted by Mr. Cooke states that women and girls\r\nabove thirteen years of age use the weed in the form of quids. A\r\nmagnificent Hebe, arrayed in satin and flashing in diamonds, \"puts you\r\nback with one delicate hand, while with the fair taper fingers of the\r\nother she takes the tobacco out of her mouth previous to your saluting\r\nher.\" A European visiting Paraguay for the first time is rather\r\nastonished at the conduct of the fair beauty, but such is the force of\r\ncustom that the squeamishness of the new-comer is soon overcome, when\r\nhe finds that he has to kiss every lady to whom he is introduced; and\r\nthe traveler says that \"one half of those you meet are really tempting\r\nenough to render you reckless of consequences.\"\r\n\r\nSmoking is practised by the natives of Patagonia, who are a tall and\r\nmuscular class of men, though not such giants as represented by the\r\nearly voyagers. Hutchinson, in a valuable paper on the Indians of\r\nSouth America has an account of the Pehuenches, one of the principal\r\ntribes of Patagonia, in which he states that \"their chief indulgence\r\nis smoking. The native pipes are fabricated out of a piece of stone,\r\nfashioned into the shape of a bowl, into which is inserted a long\r\nbrass tube. The latter is obtained by barter at Bohia Blanca. The\r\ntobacco in the bowl being lighted, each man of a party takes a suck at\r\nthe pipe in his turn.\" Tilston, who witnessed the operation, describes\r\nit as a most ludicrous one.\r\n                            \"The smoker gives a pull at the pipe,\r\n     gulping in a quantity of Tobacco vapour, the cubic\r\n     measurement of which my informant would be afraid to guess\r\n     at. All the muscles of the body seem in a temporary\r\n     convulsion whilst it is being taken in, and the neighbour to\r\n     whom the pipe is transferred follows suit by inhaling as if\r\n     he were trying to swallow down brass tube, bowl, Tobacco,\r\n     fire, and all. Meanwhile, there issues from the nose and\r\n     mouth of the previous smoker such a cumulus of cloud as for\r\n     a few seconds to render his face quite invisible.\"\r\n                                                        Tobacco is\r\nmore used in Chili than in the other countries on the Pacific side of\r\nSouth America; this is owing to the extensive use of the leaves of the\r\nCocoa plant as a narcotic by the natives of Bolivia, Peru, and\r\nColombia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: South Americans smoking.]\r\n\r\nWe refrain from enlarging on the nature and use of this narcotic, as\r\non some future occasion we may take an opportunity of making some\r\nobservations on Cocoa, which according to Jonson, holds an undisputed\r\nsway over some seven or eight millions of the inhabitants of South\r\nAmerica. The Indians formerly inhabiting the high table-lands of what\r\nis now called Peru and Bolivia appear prior to the invasion of the\r\nSpaniards to have been much further advanced in civilization than the\r\nraces occupying the other portions of South America; and there is a\r\nstrong probability that they are of a different origin from the races\r\noccupying Chili, Patagonia, Brazil, and the great district washed by\r\nthe waters of the West Indian Sea. Science as yet cannot give anything\r\nlike an accurate idea of the time man has existed in these\r\nwidely-diversified countries, but we cannot go wrong in accepting the\r\nstatement of Darwin, who observes that\r\n                                       \"we must admit that man has\r\n     inhabited South America for an immensely long period,\r\n     inasmuch as any change in climate, effected by the elevation\r\n     of the land must have been extremely gradual.\"\r\n\r\nAnother writer says of the pipes of the Indians of North America:\r\n\r\n     \"Great variety of form and material distinguishes the pipes\r\n     of the modern Indians; arising in part from the local\r\n     facilities they possess for a suitable material from which\r\n     to construct them; and in part also from the special style\r\n     of art and decoration which has become the traditional usage\r\n     of the tribes. The favorite red pipe-stone of the Coteau des\r\n     Prairies, has been generally sought after, both from its\r\n     easiness of working and the beauty of its appearance. A pipe\r\n     of this favorite and beautiful material, found on the shores\r\n     of Lake Simcoe, and now in my possession, measures five\r\n     inches and three-quarters in length, and nearly four inches\r\n     in greatest breadth, yet the capacity of the bowl hollowed\r\n     in it for the reception of tobacco is even less than in the\r\n     smallest of the \"Elfin Pipes.\" In contrast to this, a modern\r\n     Winnebago pipe recently acquired by me, made of the same red\r\n     pipe-stone, inlaid with lead, and executed with ingenious\r\n     skill, has a bowl of large dimensions illustrative of Indian\r\n     smoking usages modified by the influence of the white man.\r\n     From the red pipe-stone, as well as from the lime stone and\r\n     other harder rocks, the Chippeways, the Winnebagos, and the\r\n     Sioux, frequently make a peculiar class of pipes, inlaid\r\n     with lead.\r\n\r\n     \"The Chincok and Puget Sound Indians, who evince little\r\n     taste in comparison with the tribes surrounding them, in\r\n     ornamenting their persons or their warlike and domestic\r\n     implements, commonly use wooden pipes. Sometimes these are\r\n     elaborately carved, but most frequently they are rudely and\r\n     hastily made for immediate use; and even among these remote\r\n     tribes of the flat head Indians, the common clay pipe of the\r\n     fur trader begins to supersede such native arts. Among the\r\n     Assinaboin Indians a material is used in pipe manufacture\r\n     altogether peculiar to them. It is a fine marble, much too\r\n     hard to admit of minute carving, but taking a high polish.\r\n     This is cut into pipes of graceful form, and made so\r\n     extremely thin, as to be almost transparent, so that when\r\n     lighted the glowing tobacco shines through, and presents a\r\n     singular appearance when in use at night or in a dark lodge.\r\n     Another favorite material employed by the Assinaboin Indians\r\n     is a coarse species of jasper also too hard to admit of\r\n     elaborate ornamentation.\"\r\n\r\nThis also is cut into various simple but tasteful designs, executed\r\nchiefly by the slow and laborious process of rubbing it down with\r\nother stones. The choice of the material for fashioning the favorite\r\npipe is by no means invariably guided by the facilities which the\r\nlocation of the tribe affords. A suitable stone for such a purpose\r\nwill be picked up and carried hundreds of miles. Mr. Kane informs me\r\nthat, in coming down the Athabaska River, when drawing near its source\r\nin the Rocky Mountains, he observed his Assinaboin guides select the\r\nfavorite bluish jasper from among the water-worn stones in the bed of\r\nthe river, to carry home for the purpose of pipe manufacture, although\r\nthey were then fully five hundred miles from their lodges. Such a\r\ntraditional adherence to a choice of material peculiar to a remote\r\nsource, may frequently prove of considerable value as a clue to former\r\nmigrations of the tribes. Both the Cree and the Winnebago Indians\r\ncarve pipes in stone of a form now more frequently met with in the\r\nIndian curiosity stores of Canada and the States than any other\r\nspecimens of native carving. The tube, cut at a sharp right angle with\r\nthe cylindrical bowl of the pipe, is ornamented with a thin vandyked\r\nridge, generally perforated with a row of holes, and standing up\r\nsomewhat like the dorsal fin of a fish. The Winnebagos also\r\nmanufacture pipes of the same form, but of a smaller size, in lead,\r\nwith considerable skill.\r\n\r\nAmong the Cree Indians a double pipe is occasionally in use,\r\nconsisting of a bowl carved out of stone without much attempt at\r\nornament, but with perforations on two sides, so that two smokers can\r\ninsert their pipe-stems at once, and enjoy the same supply of tobacco.\r\nIt does not appear, however, that any special significance is attached\r\nto this singular fancy. The Saultaux Indians, a branch of the great\r\nAlgonquin nation, also carve their pipes out of a black stone found in\r\ntheir country, and evince considerable skill in the execution of their\r\nelaborate details. But the most remarkable of all the specimens of\r\npipe sculpture executed by the Indians of the north-west are those\r\ncarved by the Bobeen, or Big-lip Indians,--so called from the singular\r\ndeformity they produce by inserting a piece of wood into a slit made\r\nin the lower lip.\r\n\r\nThe Bobeen Indians are found along the Pacific coast, about latitude\r\n54°, 40', and extend from the borders of the Russian dominions\r\neastward nearly to Frazer River. The pipes of the Bobeen, and also of\r\nthe Clalam Indians, occupying the neighboring Vancouver's Island, are\r\ncarved with the utmost elaborateness and in the most singular and\r\ngrotesque devices, from a soft blue clay-stone or slate. Their form is\r\nin part determined by the material, which is only procurable in thin\r\nslabs, so that the sculptures, wrought on both sides, present a sort\r\nof double bas-relief. From this, singular and grotesque groups are\r\ncarved without any apparent reference to the final destination of the\r\nwhole as a pipe. The lower side is generally a straight line, and in\r\nthe specimens I have examined they measure from two or three to\r\nfifteen inches long; so that in these the pipe-stem is included. A\r\nsmall hollow is carved out of some protruding ornament to serve as the\r\nbowl of the pipe, and from the further end a perforation is drilled to\r\nconnect with this. The only addition made to it when in use is the\r\ninsertion of a quill or straw as a mouth-piece. The Indians have both\r\nwar and peace pipes.\r\n\r\nThe War pipe is a true tomahawk of ordinary size with a perforated\r\nhandle the tobacco being placed in the receptacle above the hatchet\r\nthe handle serving as a pipe-stem and used for either pipe or\r\ntomahawk. Many varieties of Indian Pipes have been found not only in\r\nthe Western and Southern mounds but in Mexico and Central America.\r\nFine specimens are found in Florida and some elaborately carved have\r\nbeen unearthed in Virginia. Wilson says of the pipes used by the\r\nIndians: \"The pipe stem is one of the characteristics of modern race,\r\nif not distinctive of the Northern tribes of Indians.\" In alluding to\r\nthe pipes more particularly he says:\r\n                                     \"Specimens of another class of\r\n     clay pipes of a larger size, and with a tube of such length\r\n     as obviously to be designed for use without the addition of\r\n     a \"pipe-stem,\"\r\n                    most of the ancient clay pipes that have been\r\ndiscovered are stated to have the same form; and this, it may be\r\nnoted, bears so near a resemblance to that of the red clay pipe used\r\nin modern Turkey, with the cherry-tree pipe stem, that it might be\r\nsupposed to have furnished the model.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A war pipe.]\r\n\r\nThe bowls of this class of ancient clay pipes are not of the miniature\r\nproportions which induce a comparison between those of Canada and the\r\nearly examples found in Britain; neither do the stone pipe-heads of\r\nthe mound-builders suggest by the size of the bowl either the\r\nself-denying economy of the ancient smoker, or his practice of the\r\nmodern Indian mode of exhaling the fumes of the tobacco, by which so\r\nsmall a quantity suffices to produce the full narcotic effects of the\r\nfavorite weed. They would rather seem to confirm the indications\r\nderived from the other sources, of an essential difference between the\r\nancient smoking usages of Central America and of the mound-builders,\r\nand those which are still maintained in their primeval integrity\r\namong the Indians of the North West.\r\n\r\nOf the mound-builders Foster says:\r\n\r\n     \"The mound-builders were well aware of the narcotic\r\n     properties of tobacco, a plant which indigenous to America,\r\n     and which since the discovery of the western continent has\r\n     been domesticated in every region of the earth where the\r\n     soil and climate are favorable to its cultivation. No habit\r\n     at this day, it may be said, is more universal or more\r\n     difficult to eradicate than that of smoking. With the\r\n     mound-builder tobacco was the greatest of luxuries; his\r\n     solace in his hours of relaxations, and the choicest\r\n     offering he could dedicate to the Great Spirit. Upon his\r\n     pipe he lavished all the skill he possessed, in the\r\n     lapidary's art.\r\n\r\n       \"From the red stone of the quarry\r\n        With his hand he broke a fragment\r\n        Moulded it into a pipe head\r\n        Shaped and fashioned it with figures.\"\r\n\r\nMany of these pipes are sculptured from the most obdurate stones and\r\ndisplay great delicacy of workmanship. The features of animals are so\r\ntruthfully cut that often there is no difficulty in their\r\nidentification, and even the plumage of birds is delineated by curved\r\nor straight lines which show a close adherence to nature. The bowl and\r\nstem piece wrought from a single block, are as accurately drilled as\r\nthey could be at this day, by the lapidary's art. Both the War pipe\r\nand Peace pipe are the most sacred and the most highly valued of all\r\nthe various kinds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peace pipe.]\r\n\r\n     \"The calumet, or pipe of peace, ornamented with the war\r\n     eagles quill, is a sacred pipe, and never used on any other\r\n     occasion than that of peace making, when the chief brings it\r\n     into treaty, and unfolding the many bandages which are\r\n     carefully kept around it, has it ready to be mutually smoked\r\n     by the chiefs, after the terms of the treaty are agreed\r\n     upon, as the means of solemnizing it; which is done by\r\n     passing the sacred stem to each chief, who draws one breath\r\n     of smoke only through it. Nothing can be more binding than\r\n     smoking the pipe of peace and is considered by them to be an\r\n     inviolable pledge. There is no custom more uniformly in\r\n     constant use amongst the poor Indians than that of smoking\r\n     nor any more highly valued. His pipe is his constant\r\n     companion through life--his messenger of peace; he pledges\r\n     his friends through its stem and its bowl, and when its\r\n     care-drowning fumes cease to flow, it takes a place with him\r\n     in his solitary grave with his tomahawk and war-club\r\n     companions to his long-fancied 'happy hunting grounds.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom specimens of clay pipes found at the South from Virginia to\r\nFlorida it would seem that the Indians had a great variety of pipes\r\nsome of which were beautifully carved while others are perfectly\r\nplain. Many of them however are of rude workmanship and might have\r\nbeen fashioned by some of the tribe unacquainted with pipe-making.\r\n\r\nDall gives the following account of smoking among the natives of\r\nAlaska:\r\n\r\n     We broke camp about five o'clock in the morning. Nothing\r\n     occurred to break the monotony of constant steady plodding.\r\n     Two Indians in the bow of the boat would row until tired,\r\n     and then we would stop for a few minutes to rest, and let\r\n     them smoke. The last operation takes less than a minute;\r\n     their pipes are so constructed as to hold but a very small\r\n     pinch of tobacco. The bowl, with ears for tying it to the\r\n     stem is generally cast out of lead. Sometimes it is made of\r\n     soft stone, bone or even hard wood. The stem is made of two\r\n     pieces of wood hollowed on one side, and bound to the bowl\r\n     and each other by a narrow strip of deerskin. In smoking the\r\n     economical Indian generally cuts up a little birch wood, or\r\n     the inner bark of the poplar, and mixes it with his tobacco.\r\n     A few reindeer hairs pulled from his paska, are rolled into\r\n     a little ball, and placed in the bottom of the bowl to\r\n     prevent the contents from being drawn into the stem. A pinch\r\n     of tobacco cut as fine as snuff is inserted and two or three\r\n     whiffs are afforded by it.\r\n\r\nThe smoke is inhaled into the lungs, producing a momentary stupor and\r\nthe operation is over. A fungus which grows on decayed birch trees, or\r\ntinder manufactured from the down of the poplar rubbed up with\r\ncharcoal is used with flint and steel for obtaining a light. Matches\r\nare highly valued and readily purchased. The effect of the Circassian\r\ntobacco on the lungs is extremely bad, and among those tribes who use\r\nit many die from asthma and congestion of the lungs. This is\r\nprincipally due to the saltpetre with which it is impregnated. The\r\nIndian pipe is copied from the Eskimo, as the latter were the first to\r\nobtain and use tobacco. Many of the tribes call it by the Eskimo name.\r\n\r\nThe Kutchin and Eastern Finneh were modeled after the clay pipes of\r\nthe Hudson Bay Company, but they also carve very pretty ones out of\r\nbirch knots and the root of the wild rose-bush. The Chukchees use a\r\npipe similar to those of the Eskimo, but with a much larger and\r\nshorter stem. This stem is hollow, and is filled with fine birch\r\nshavings. After smoking for some months these shavings impregnated\r\nwith the oil of tobacco, are taken out through an opening in the lower\r\npart of the stem and smoked over. The Hudson Baymen make passable\r\npipe-stems by taking a straight-grained piece of willow or spruce\r\nwithout knots, and cutting through the outer layers of bark and wood.\r\nThis stick is heated in the ashes and by twisting the end in contrary\r\ndirections the heart-wood may be gradually drawn out, leaving a hollow\r\ntube.\r\n\r\nThe Kutchin make pretty pipe-stems out of goose-quills wound about\r\nwith porcupine-quills. It is the custom in the English forts to make\r\nevery Indian who comes to trade, a present of a clay pipe filled with\r\ntobacco. We were provided with cheap brown ones, with wooden stems,\r\nwhich were much liked by the natives, and it is probable that small\r\nbrier-wood pipes, which are not liable to break, would form an\r\nacceptable addition to any stock of trading goods\". The Tchuktchi of\r\nnorth-eastern Asia are devoted worshipers of tobacco, and is one of\r\nthe chief articles of trade with them. Their pipes are large, much\r\nlarger at the stem than the bowl. In smoking, they swallow the fumes\r\nof the tobacco which causes intoxication for a time. \"The desire to\r\nprocure a few of its narcotic leaves induces the American Esquimaux\r\nfrom the Ice Cape to Bristol Bay, to send their produce from hand to\r\nhand as far as the Guosden Islands in Behrings Straits, where it is\r\nbartered for the tobacco of the Tchuktchi, and there again principally\r\nresort to the fair of Ostrownoje to purchase tobacco from the\r\nRussians. Generally the Tchuktchi receive from the Americans as money\r\nskins for half a pond, or eighteen pounds of tobacco leaves as they\r\nafterwards sell to the Russians for two ponds of tobacco of the same\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Tchuktchi pipe.]\r\n\r\nThe Russians also are great lovers of the weed. A writer says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Everybody smokes, men, women, and children. They smoke\r\n     Turkish tobacco, rolled in silk paper--seldom cigars or\r\n     pipes. These rolls are called parporos. The ladies almost\r\n     all smoke, but they smoke the small, delicate sizes of\r\n     parporos, while the gentlemen smoke larger ones. Always at\r\n     morning, noon and night, comes the inevitable box of\r\n     parporos, and everybody at the table smokes and drinks their\r\n     coffee at the same time. On the cars are fixed little cups\r\n     for cigar ashes in every seat. Ladies frequently take out\r\n     their part parporos, and hand them to the gentlemen with a\r\n     pretty invitation to smoke. Instead of having a smoking car\r\n     as we do, they have a car for those who are so 'pokey' as\r\n     not to smoke.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the German States the custom of smoking is universal and\r\ntobacco enters largely into their list of expenditures. A writer says\r\nof smoking in Austria:--\r\n\r\n     \"We have been rather surprised to find so few persons\r\n     smoking pipes in Austria. Indeed, a pipe is seldom seen\r\n     except among the laboring classes. The most favorite mode of\r\n     using the weed here is in cigarettes, almost every gentleman\r\n     being provided with a silver box, in which they have Turkish\r\n     tobacco and small slips of paper, with mucilage on them\r\n     ready for rolling. They make them as they use them, and are\r\n     very expert in the handling of the tobacco. The chewing of\r\n     tobacco is universally repudiated, being regarded as the\r\n     height of vulgarity. The Turkish tobacco is of fine flavor,\r\n     and commands high prices. It is very much in appearance like\r\n     the fine cut chewing tobacco so extensively used at home.\"\r\n\r\nThe cigars made by the Austrian Government, which are the only\r\ndescription to be had are very inferior, and it is not to be wondered\r\nthat the cigarette is so generally used in preference.\r\n\r\nThe smoking of cigarettes by the ladies is quite common, especially\r\namong the higher classes. In no part of the world is smoking so common\r\nas in South America; here all classes and all ages use the weed.\r\nSmoking is encouraged in the family and the children are early taught\r\nthe custom. A traveler who has observed this custom more particularly\r\nthan any other, says of the use of tobacco in Peru:--\r\n\r\n     \"Scarcely in any regions of the world is smoking so common\r\n     as in Peru. The rich as well as the poor, the old man as\r\n     well as the boy, the master as well as the servant, the lady\r\n     as well as the negroes who wait on her, the young maiden as\r\n     well as the mother--all smoke and never cease smoking,\r\n     except when eating, or sleeping, or in church. Social\r\n     distinctions are as numerous and as marked in Peru as\r\n     anywhere else, and there is the most exclusive pride of\r\n     color and of blood. But differences of color and of rank are\r\n     wholly disregarded when a light for a cigar is requested, a\r\n     favor which it is not considered a liberty to ask, and which\r\n     it would be deemed a gross act of incivility to refuse. It\r\n     is chiefly cigarritos which are smoked.\r\n\r\n     \"The cigarrito, as is well known, is tobacco cut fine and\r\n     dexterously wrapped in moist maize leaves, in paper, or in\r\n     straw. Only the laborers on the plantations smoke small clay\r\n     pipes. Dearer than the cigarritos are the cigars, which are\r\n     not inferior to the best Havanna. Everywhere are met the\r\n     cigarrito-twisters. Cleverly though they manipulate,\r\n     cleanliness is not their besetting weakness. But in Peru,\r\n     and in other parts of South America, cleanliness is not held\r\n     in more esteem than in Portugal and Spain.\"\r\n\r\nThe Turks have long been noted as among the largest consumers of\r\ntobacco as well as using the most magnificent of smoking implements.\r\nThe hookah is in all respects the most expensive and elaborate machine\r\n(for so it may be called) used for smoking tobacco. A traveler gives\r\nthe following graphic description of smoking among them:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Turk smoking.]\r\n\r\n     \"As each man smokes only out of his own pipe, it is not\r\n     surprising that this instrument is an indispensable\r\n     accompaniment of every person of rank. Men of the higher\r\n     classes keep two or three servants to attend to their pipes.\r\n     While one looks after things at home, the other has to\r\n     accompany his master in his walks and rides. The long stem\r\n     is on such occasions packed in a finely embroidered cloth\r\n     cover, while the bowl, tobacco, and other accessories are\r\n     carried by the servant in a pouch at his side. A stranger in\r\n     Constantinople will often regard with curiosity and\r\n     surprise, a proud Osmanli on foot or horseback, followed by\r\n     an attendant who, through the long, carefully-packed\r\n     instrument which he carries, gives one the idea that he is a\r\n     weapon-bearer of some heroic period following his lord to\r\n     some dangerous rendezvous. So are the times altered. What\r\n     the armor-bearer was for the warlike races of old, such is\r\n     the tchbukdi for their degenerate descendants.\r\n\r\n     \"To smoke from sixty to eighty pipes a day is by no means\r\n     uncommon; for whatever be the business, no matter how\r\n     serious, in which the Turk is engaged, he must smoke at it.\r\n     In the divan, where the grandees of the empire consult\r\n     together on the most delicate affairs of State, the question\r\n     was once mooted whether the tchbukdes should not be excluded\r\n     from such debates as were of a strictly private nature.\r\n     There was a great diversity of opinion on the subject.\r\n     Politics and reason were on opposite sides. At last it was\r\n     decided that they would not disgrace an ancient national\r\n     usage, but would allow the harmless attendants to enter the\r\n     council-room every now and then to change the pipes. In\r\n     Turkey, pipes and tobacco afford means of distinguishing not\r\n     only the different classes of the community, but even the\r\n     several graduates of rank in the same class. A mushir\r\n     (marshal) would find it derogatory to his dignity to smoke\r\n     out of a stem less than two yards in length. The artisan or\r\n     official of a lower rank, would consider it highly\r\n     unbecoming on his part to use one which exceeded the proper\r\n     proportions of his class. A superior stretches his pipe\r\n     before him to his inferior; while the latter must hold his\r\n     modestly on one side, only allowing the end of the\r\n     mouth-piece to peep out of his closed fist.\r\n\r\n     \"The pasha has the right to puff out his smoke before him\r\n     like a steam engine, while his inferiors are only allowed to\r\n     breathe forth a light curl of smoke, and that must be let\r\n     off backwards. Not to smoke at all in the presence of a\r\n     superior, is held the most delicate homage which can be paid\r\n     him. A son, for instance, acts in this manner in the\r\n     presence of his father, and only such a one is considered to\r\n     be well brought up who declines to smoke even after his\r\n     father has repeatedly invited him to do so. The fair sex in\r\n     the East is scarcely less addicted to the use of this weed.\r\n\r\n     \"The girl of twelve years old smokes a cigarette of the\r\n     thickness of pack-thread. When she has attained her\r\n     fourteenth or fifteenth year, and is already marriageable,\r\n     she is allowed to indulge her penchant at will, which is\r\n     forbidden when younger. After this age the diameter of the\r\n     cigarette increases year by year; and when a lady has\r\n     reached the mature age of twenty-four, no one sees anything\r\n     remarkable in her smoking a modest little chibouque as she\r\n     sits on the lower divan of the harem. Elderly matrons--and\r\n     in Turkey every lady is an elderly matron in her fortieth\r\n     year--are passionately devoted to this enjoyment. The\r\n     pipe-bowls and stems always remain of the size appropriated\r\n     by etiquette to the use of the harem; but the strongest and\r\n     most pungent sorts of tobacco are not unseldom smoked, until\r\n     the mouth, which, according to the assurance of the poet, in\r\n     the bloom of its youth breathed forth ambergiris and musk,\r\n     in its fortieth year acquires so strong a smell that the\r\n     lady can be scented from a distance.\r\n\r\n     \"Like their lords, the hanyrus of rank have also their\r\n     tchbukdes, of course of their own sex, who accompany them\r\n     when out walking or on a visit. In this case, however, the\r\n     cover in which the pipe-stem is made, not of cloth, but of\r\n     silk. The habit of refreshing oneself with a pipe on some\r\n     elevated spot which commands a fine view, is common to both\r\n     sexes. Men can indulge this taste whenever their fancy may\r\n     suggest, but ladies only in retired spots; for, whenever a\r\n     Turkish fair one removes the yas mak (veil) from her lips,\r\n     as she does to smoke, all around her must be harem (sacred).\r\n\r\n     \"Sometimes an eunuch stands guard at a little distance off,\r\n     and if a stranger of the male sex approaches, gives a\r\n     signal; the pipe is held aside, while the mouth is kept\r\n     covered by the veil, until the unexpected Acteon has passed\r\n     by. But where the pipe plays the most important part is in\r\n     the bath. It is well known that the Turkish ladies are\r\n     accustomed to frequent the hommams assiduously, and to\r\n     remain there for hours together. They enter the bath about\r\n     eight o'clock in the morning; take their midday meal there,\r\n     and return home between three and four in the afternoon.\r\n     During these hours of leisure, the most agreeable in a\r\n     Mohammedan woman's life, the pipe is their constant\r\n     resource. In the middle of the warmest room is a round\r\n     terrace-like elevation, called Gobek-tosh.\r\n\r\n     \"Here are clustered old and young, the snow white daughters\r\n     of Circassia and the coal-black beauties of Soudan, and\r\n     beguile the hours with never ending gossip, while around\r\n     them rise the dense fumes of their pipes. Now one of the\r\n     elders of the party tells a story, now a learned lady holds\r\n     a discourse on religion, or extols the beauty and virtue of\r\n     'Aisha Fatima.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Fairy, or Dane's pipe is the most ancient form of the tobacco pipe\r\nused in Great Britain and of about the same size as the \"Elfin pipes\"\r\nof the Scottish peasantry. A great variety of pipes both in form and\r\nsize have been found in the British Islands some of which are of\r\nancient origin bearing dates prior to the Seventeenth Century. Some of\r\nthese ancient pipes are formed of very fine clay and although they\r\nheld but a small quantity of tobacco were doubtless considered to be\r\nfine specimens in their time.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of pipes commenced soon after the custom of using\r\ntobacco had become fashionable and soon after the Virginians commenced\r\nits cultivation. Fairholt says:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old English pipes.]\r\n\r\n     \"The early period at which tobacco pipes were first\r\n     manufactured, is established by the fact that the\r\n     incorporation of the craft of tobacco-pipe makers took place\r\n     on the 5th of October, 1619. Their privileges extending\r\n     through the cities of London and Westminster, the kingdom of\r\n     England and dominion of Wales. They have a Master, four\r\n     Wardens, and about twenty-four Assistants. They were first\r\n     incorporated by King James in his seventeenth year,\r\n     confirmed again by King Charles I., and lastly on the\r\n     twenty-ninth of April in the fifteenth year of King Charles\r\n     II., in all the privileges of their aforesaid charters.\r\n\r\n     \"The London Company of Tobacco Pipe Makers was incorporated\r\n     in the reign of Charles II (1663); it had no hall and no\r\n     livery but was governed by a Master two wardens, and\r\n     eighteen assistants. The first pipes used in the British\r\n     Islands were made of silver while 'ordinary ones' were made\r\n     of a walnut shell and a straw. Afterwards appeared the more\r\n     common clay pipes in various forms and which are in use at\r\n     the present time.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Anne and George I. the pipes assumed a different\r\nform and greater length so long were the stems of some of them that\r\nthey were called yards of clay. The French pipe is one of the finest\r\nmanufactured and is made of a fine red clay especially those made by\r\nFiolet of St. Omer, one of the best designers of pipes. Many of these\r\nlike German pipes are made of porcelain, adorned with portraits and\r\nlandscapes. Others are made of rare kinds of wood turned in the lathe\r\nor artistically carved, and lined with clay to resist the action of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe French also make pipes of agate, amber, crystal, carnelian and\r\nivory, as well as the various kinds of pure or mixed metals. Many of\r\nthe French and German pipes while they are beautiful in design and\r\nmade of the most costly materials are often exceedingly grotesque,\r\nrepresenting often the most ludicrous scenes and all possible\r\nattitudes. Many of them have been termed as satirical pipes taking off\r\nsome public character _a la_ Nast.\r\n\r\nFairholt says of satirical pipes:\r\n\r\n     \"England has occasioned the production of one satirical pipe\r\n     for sale among ourselves. The late Duke of Wellington toward\r\n     the close of his life, took a strong dislike to the use of\r\n     tobacco in the army, and made some ineffectual attempts to\r\n     suppress it. Benda, a wholesale pipe importer in the city\r\n     employed Dumeril, of St. Omer, to commemorate the event, and\r\n     the result was a pipe head, in which a subaltern, pipe in\r\n     hand, quietly 'takes a sight' at the great commander who is\r\n     caricatured after a fashion that must have made the work a\r\n     real pleasure to a Frenchman.\"\r\n                                    Many of the French pipes are\r\nexceedingly quaint representing all manner of comical scenes. One is\r\nformed like a steam-engine the smoke passing through the funnel.\r\nAnother is fashioned after a potato or a turnip while others often\r\nrepresent some military subjects. In England and Ireland also pipes of\r\na whimsical form are common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: French pipes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPIPES AND SMOKERS. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Russia and Denmark as also in Norway and Sweden the pipes are more\r\nsimple and are principally formed of wood sometimes tipped with copper\r\nbut usually of inferior material and work when compared with French\r\nand German pipes. The German pipes considered as works of art are\r\ndoubtless the finest made. Many are made of meerschaum (sea foam).\r\nThis material is found in various parts of Asia Minor. When first\r\nobtained it is capable of forming a lather like soap, and is used by\r\nthe Tartars for washing purposes. The Turks use it for pipes which are\r\nmade in the same way that pottery is and afterwards soaked in wax and\r\nis then ready for smoking. It heats slowly and is capable of greater\r\nabsorption than any other material used in pipe making. To properly\r\ncolor a meerschaum is now considered as one of the fine arts and when\r\ncompleted is considered quite a triumph. When the pipe takes on a rich\r\ndeep brown tint it is considered a valuable pipe and is watched and\r\nguarded as a most valuable treasure.\r\n\r\nM. Ziegler thus describes the source whence the considerable annual\r\nsupply of meerschaum for meerschaum pipes is derived:\r\n\r\n     \"Large quantities of this mineral so highly esteemed by\r\n     smokers, comes from Hrubschitz and Oslawan in Austrian\r\n     Moravia where it is found embedded between thick strata of\r\n     serpentine rock. It is also found in Spain at Esconshe,\r\n     Vallecas and Toledo; the best however comes from Asia Minor.\r\n     The chief places are the celebrated meerschaum mines from\r\n     six to eight miles southeast of Eskis chehr, on the river\r\n     Pursak chief tributary to the river Sagarius. They were\r\n     known to Xenophon, and are now worked principally by\r\n     Armenian Christians, who sink narrow pits, to the beds of\r\n     this mineral, and work the sides out until water or imminent\r\n     danger drives them away to try another place. Some\r\n     meerschaum comes from Brussa, and in 1869 over 3,000 boxes\r\n     of raw material were imported from Asia Minor at Trieste,\r\n     with 345,000 florins. The pipe manufacture and carving is\r\n     principally carried on in Vienna and in Rhula, Duchy of\r\n     Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The commercial value of meerschaum\r\n     carving at these places may be estimated at $2,000,000\r\n     annually. However very large quantities of them are not made\r\n     from genuine but artificial material. The waste from these\r\n     carvings is ground to a very fine powder, and then boiled\r\n     with linseed oil and alum. When this mixture has sufficient\r\n     cohesion, it is cast in molds and carefully dried and\r\n     carved, as if these blocks of mineral had been natural. It\r\n     is said that about one-half of all pipes now sold are made\r\n     from artificial meerschaum. Meerschaum is one of the\r\n     lightest of minerals and it is said that in Italy bricks\r\n     have been made of it so light that they would float on the\r\n     top of the water. Some pipes (doubtless owing to the quality\r\n     of meerschaum) take on more color in a given time than\r\n     others this is owing in a great measure however to the\r\n     thickness of the bowl.\"\r\n\r\nPipe-colorers, who go around coloring pipes or meerschaums, pride\r\nthemselves on the rapidity with which they are enabled to color a\r\npipe. The following, on \"Pipe Colorers,\" is from \"The Tobacco Plant\":\r\n\r\n     \"There are men who pride themselves upon the skill with\r\n     which they are able to color the pipes they smoke. Some of\r\n     these are amateurs, who smoke Tobacco only with the view of\r\n     gratifying that taste for color which is satisfied when a\r\n     bowl of clay or meerschaum is sufficiently yellowed,\r\n     browned, or blacked. There are men who care nothing for\r\n     Tobacco of itself, and would be much more easily and\r\n     rationally pleased were they to set their pipes upon an\r\n     easel and paint them with oils and camel's-hair. Others of\r\n     the class are professional colorers, who hire themselves to\r\n     pipe-sellers or connoisseurs by the week, or day, or hour,\r\n     to smoke so many ounces or pounds of strong Tobacco through\r\n     such and such pipes in such and such a time, with the\r\n     view of causing such and such stains of Tobacco-juice to\r\n     make themselves visible on the bowls or stems of those\r\n     specified pipes. These are mostly old, well-seasoned\r\n     smokers, to whose existence the weed has become essential;\r\n     who smoke their own old pipes, which lack artistic coloring,\r\n     in the intervals when they lay aside the pipes they are\r\n     employed to color. Another and much smaller section of the\r\n     class are those who smoke for smoking's sake, and yet are\r\n     weak enough to nurse some special pipes for show. To such it\r\n     is a joy to say, when friends are gathered at the festive\r\n     board 'Look! is not that well colored? I colored it myself.'\r\n     In such an age as this, when the learned cannot tell us\r\n     which of our various branches of knowledge and inquiry are\r\n     sciences and which are not, it may not seem a great anomaly\r\n     that this pipe-coloring should, by some, be called 'an art.'\r\n     Nor is it, when we think that there is such an 'art' as\r\n     blacking shoes; and when we must perforce admit that he who,\r\n     barber fashion, cuts our hair--and he who, cook-wise, broils\r\n     the kidney for our mid-day dinner--is an artist. We have not\r\n     come as yet to give this title to the weaver who watches the\r\n     loom that weaves our stockings, or to the hammer-man who\r\n     beats the red-hot horse-shoe on the anvil in a smithy; but\r\n     even there we designate 'artisans,' and 'artists' may come\r\n     next. So, hey! for the art of coloring pipes!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pipe colorer.]\r\n\r\n     \"It may not be denied that there is beauty in a well-colored\r\n     meerschaum; but in the admission lies the contradiction of\r\n     Keats' well-known line--\r\n\r\n          \"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.\"\r\n\r\n     For, your meerschaum is a fragile thing, and eminently\r\n     frangible. This present writer once did see four beauties\r\n     break within a single moon. And when they break, what\r\n     previous joy of coloring can over-top the sorrow of their\r\n     dire destruction? It is a singular difficulty in the way of\r\n     those who most desire to beautify utility or utilize the\r\n     beautiful, or show that beauty is most lovely when made\r\n     practical, that these artistic colorers of pipes are always\r\n     those who make least use of Tobacco, save for the immediate\r\n     purpose of obtaining the clay in which it is smoked. Ask\r\n     such an artist why he smokes, and he will scarcely tell you.\r\n     His best reason certainly will be, that others smoke, and,\r\n     as a custom, it becomes him. And when you find an ardent\r\n     smoker--one who smokes because he likes Tobacco for itself,\r\n     or finds it useful--who spends his time in tinting pipes,\r\n     you will have found a _rara avis_, or a monstrosity. Apart\r\n     from taste, there are some practical objections to this\r\n     custom of coloring pipes. Smoking, to be worthy, should be\r\n     free and unrestrained; while he who colors his pipe is tied\r\n     by system and confined to rule.\r\n\r\n     \"A pipe to be enjoyable, should be its master's slave; but\r\n     he who keeps a 'well-colored' pipe is slave thereto. He\r\n     cannot smoke it as, or when, or where he will. He must not\r\n     smoke it in a draught, or near a fire; he must not lay it\r\n     down, or finger it; he must not puff too fast, nor yet too\r\n     slow. In short, he is the creature of this 'Joss'--this\r\n     home-made deity--to which he bows down and worships. The\r\n     pipe-colorers are the Sabbatarians of smoking. Whereas, the\r\n     pipe was made for man, they treat man as made for the pipe.\r\n     And thus, as in all cases where the cart is expected to draw\r\n     the horse, the economy of nature is reversed, and mischief\r\n     is evolved.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: German porcelain pipes.]\r\n\r\nDibdin, in his \"Tour in France and Germany,\" says of Vienna, that it\r\nis a city of smokers,--\"a good Austrian thinks he can never pay too\r\nmuch for a good pipe.\" Many of the Germans use a kind of pipe carved\r\nfrom the root of the dwarf oak; wooden pipes of a similar kind are\r\nmade of brier root, and are very common, as are also those made from\r\nmaple and sweet-brier. One of the favorite pipes used by Germans is\r\nthe porcelain pipe, which consists of a double bowl--the upper one\r\ncontaining the tobacco, which fits into another portion of the pipe,\r\nallowing the oil to drain into the lower bowl, which may be removed\r\nand the pipe cleaned. The bowls are sometimes painted beautifully,\r\nrepresenting a variety of subjects, and in no way inferior to the\r\npainted porcelain for the table.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch are famous smokers and are constantly \"pulling at the pipe.\"\r\nThey use those with long, straight stems, and both their clay and\r\nporcelain pipes are of the finest form and finish. Irving, in \"The\r\nHistory of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the\r\nDutch Dynasty,\" has given a good description of the smoking powers of\r\nthe Dutch. Speaking of his grandfather's love for the weed, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"My great-grandfather, by the mother's side, Hermanns Van\r\n     Clattercop, when employed to build the large stone church at\r\n     Rotterdam, which stands about three hundred yards to your\r\n     left, after your turn from the Boomkeys; and which is so\r\n     conveniently constructed that all the zealous Christians of\r\n     Rotterdam prefer sleeping through a sermon there to any\r\n     other church in the city. My great-grandfather, I say, when\r\n     employed to build that famous church, did, in the first\r\n     place, send to Delft for a box of long pipes; then, having\r\n     purchased a new spitting-box and a hundred weight of the\r\n     best Virginia, he sat himself down and did nothing for the\r\n     space of three months but smoke most laboriously.\r\n\r\n     \"Then did he spend full three months more in trudging on\r\n     foot, and voyaging in the Trekschuit, from Rotterdam to\r\n     Amsterdam--to Delft--to Hærlem--to Leyden--to the\r\n     Hague--knocking his head and breaking his pipe against every\r\n     church in his road. Then did he advance gradually nearer and\r\n     nearer to Rotterdam, until he came in full sight of the\r\n     identical spot whereon the church was to be built. Then did\r\n     he spend three months longer in walking round it and round\r\n     it, contemplating it, first from one point of view, and then\r\n     from another,--now would he be paddled by it on the\r\n     canal--now would he peep at it through a telescope from the\r\n     other side of the Meuse, and now would he take a bird's-eye\r\n     glance at it from the top of one of those gigantic windmills\r\n     which protect the gates of the city.\r\n\r\n     \"The good folks of the place were on the tip-toe of\r\n     expectation and impatience. Notwithstanding all the turmoil\r\n     of my great-grandfather, not a symptom of the church was yet\r\n     to be seen; they even began to fear it would never be\r\n     brought into the world, but that its great projector would\r\n     lie down and die in labor of the mighty plan he had\r\n     conceived. At length, having occupied twelve good months in\r\n     puffing and paddling, and talking and walking,--having\r\n     traveled over all Holland, and even taken a peep into France\r\n     and Germany,--having smoked five hundred and ninety-nine\r\n     pipes and three hundred weight of the best Virginia\r\n     tobacco,--my great-grandfather gathered together all that\r\n     knowing and industrious class of citizens who prefer\r\n     attending to anybody's business sooner than their own, and\r\n     having pulled off his coat and five pair of breeches he\r\n     advanced sturdily up and laid the corner-stone of the\r\n     church, in the presence of the whole multitude,--just at the\r\n     commencement of the thirteenth month.\"\r\n\r\nHe also alludes to Hudson whom he says was:\r\n\r\n     \"A seafaring man of renown, who had learned to smoke tobacco\r\n     under Sir Walter Raleigh, and is said to have been the first\r\n     to introduce it into Holland, which gained him much\r\n     popularity in that country, and caused him to find great\r\n     favor in their High Mightinesses, the lords and states\r\n     general, and also of the honorable West India Company. He\r\n     was a short, square, brawny old gentleman, with a double\r\n     chin, a mastiff mouth, and a broad copper nose, which was\r\n     supposed in those days to have acquired its fiery hue from\r\n     the constant neighborhood of his tobacco pipe. * * * As\r\n     chief mate and favorite companion, the commander chose\r\n     Master Robert Juet, of Limehouse, in England. By some his\r\n     name has been spelled Chewit, ascribed to the circumstance\r\n     of his having been the first man that ever chewed tobacco. *\r\n     * * * Under every misfortune he comforted himself with a\r\n     quid of tobacco, and the truly philosophical maxim, 'that it\r\n     will be all the same a hundred years hence!'\"\r\n                                                   Further on he\r\nalludes to the attempt to subjugate New Amsterdam to the British crown\r\nand the effect produced by the burghers lighting their pipes.\r\n                                                              \"When\"\r\n     he says \"Captain Argol's vessel hove in sight, the worthy\r\n     burghers were seized with such a panic, that they fell to\r\n     smoking their pipes with astonishing vehemence, insomuch\r\n     that they quickly raised a cloud, which, combining with the\r\n     surrounding woods and marshes, completely enveloped and\r\n     concealed their beloved village; and overhung the fair\r\n     regions of Pavonia:--so that the terrible Captain Argol\r\n     passed on, totally unsuspicious that a sturdy little Dutch\r\n     settlement lay snugly couched in the mud, under cover of all\r\n     this pestilent vapor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Persian water pipe.]\r\n\r\nThe Persians[52] are said to be the first to invent the mode of\r\ndrawing tobacco smoke through water thereby cooling it before inhaling\r\nit. Fairholt says \"it is to smoking what ice is to Champagne.\" The\r\n_London Review_ gives the following description of pipes and smoking\r\napparatus:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 52: Sandys, writing in 1610 narrates a Persian\r\n              legend to the effect that Shiraz tobacco was given by a\r\n              holy man to a virtuous youth, disconsolate at the loss\r\n              of his loving wife. \"Go to thy wife's tomb,\" said the\r\n              anchorite, \"and there thou wilt find a weed. Pluck it,\r\n              place it in a reed, and inhale the smoke, as you put\r\n              fire to it. This will be to you wife, mother, father and\r\n              brother,\" continued the holy man, in Homeric strain,\r\n              \"and above all, will be a wise counsellor, and teach thy\r\n              soul wisdom and thy spirit joy.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"The hookah of India is the most splendid and glittering of\r\n     all pipes; it is a large affair, on account of the\r\n     arrangements for causing the smoke to pass through water\r\n     before it reaches the lips of the smoker, as a means of\r\n     rendering it cooler and of extracting from it much of its\r\n     rank and disagreeable flavor.\r\n\r\n     \"On the top of an air-tight vessel, half filled with water,\r\n     is a bowl containing tobacco; a small tube descends from the\r\n     bowl into the water, and a flexible pipe, one end of which\r\n     is between the lips of the smoker, is inserted at the other\r\n     end into the vessel, above the level of the water. Such\r\n     being the adjustment, the philosophy of the inhalation may\r\n     be easily understood. The smoker sucks the air out of the\r\n     vessel, and makes a partial vacuum; the external air,\r\n     pressing on the burning tobacco, drives the smoke through\r\n     the small tube into the water beneath; purified from some of\r\n     its rank qualities, the smoke bubbles up into the vacant\r\n     part of the vessel above the water, and passes through the\r\n     flexible pipe to the smoker's mouth. Sometimes the affair is\r\n     made still more luxurious by substituting rose-water for\r\n     water _pur et simple_. The tube is so long and flexible that\r\n     the smoker may sit (or squat) at a small or great distance\r\n     from the vessel containing the water. In the courts of\r\n     princes and wealthy natives the vessels and tubes are\r\n     lavishly adorned with precious metals. One mode of showing\r\n     hospitality in the East is to place a hookah in the center\r\n     of the apartment, range the guests around, and let all have\r\n     a whiff of the pipe in turn; but in more luxurious\r\n     establishments a separate hookah is placed before each\r\n     guest. Some of the Egyptians use a form of hookah called the\r\n     narghile or nargeeleh--so named because the water is\r\n     contained in the shell of a cocoanut of which the Arabic\r\n     name is nargeeleh. Another kind, having a glass vessel, is\r\n     called the sheshee--having, like the other, a very long\r\n     tube. Only the choicest tobacco is used with the hookah and\r\n     nargeeleh; it is grown in Persia.\r\n\r\n     \"Before it is used, the tobacco is washed several times, and\r\n     put damp into the pipe-bowl, two or three pieces of live\r\n     charcoal are put on the top. The moisture gives mildness to\r\n     the tobacco, but renders inhalation so difficult that weak\r\n     lungs are unfitted to bear it. The dry tobacco preferred by\r\n     the Persians does not involve so much difficulty in 'blowing\r\n     a cloud.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKISH CHIBOUQUES AND WOOD PIPES.\r\n\r\n     \"The stiff-stemmed Turkish pipes, quite different from the\r\n     flexible tube of the hookah and narghile, are of two kinds,\r\n     the kablioun or long pipe, and the chibouque or short pipe.\r\n     Some of the stems of the kablioun, made of cherry tree,\r\n     jasmine, wild plum, and ebony, are five feet in length, and\r\n     are bored with a kind of gimlet. The workman, placing the\r\n     gimlet above the long, slender branchlet of wood, bores half\r\n     the length, and then reverses the position to operate upon\r\n     the other half. The wild cherry tree wood, which is the most\r\n     frequently employed, is seldom free from defects in the\r\n     bark, and some skill is exercised in so repairing these\r\n     defective places that the mending shall be invisible.\"\r\n\r\nThe tubes or pipe-bowls used with these stems are mostly a combination\r\nof two substances--the red clay of Nish and the white earth of\r\nRustchuk; they are graceful in form and sometimes decorated with\r\ngilding. It is characteristic of some of the Turks that they estimate\r\nthe duration of a journey, and with it the distance traveled, by the\r\nnumber of pipes smoked, a particular size of pipe-bowl being\r\nunderstood. Dodwell, in his \"Tour through Greece,\" says that\r\n                                                             \"a Turk\r\n     is generally very clean in his smoking apparatus, having a\r\n     small tin dish laid on the carpet of his apartment, on which\r\n     the bowl of the pipe can rest, to prevent the tobacco from\r\n     burning or soiling the carpet. The tubes of the kabliouns\r\n     are often as much as seven or eight feet long. Some of the\r\n     gardens of Turkey and Greece contain jasmine trees purposely\r\n     cultivated to produce straight stems for these pipes.\"\r\n\r\nOf those Turkish pipes which are used in Egypt, Mr. Lane, after\r\nmentioning the narghile and the chibouque or \"shibuk,\" says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The most common kind used in Egypt is made of wood called\r\n     garmashak (I believe it is maple). The greater part of the\r\n     stick, from the mouth-piece to three-fourths of its length,\r\n     is covered with silk, which is confined at each extremity by\r\n     gold thread, often intertwined with colored silks, or by a\r\n     tube of gilt or silver; and at the lower extremity of the\r\n     covering is a tassel of silk. The covering was originally\r\n     designed to be moistened with water in order to cool the\r\n     pipe, and consequently the smoke by evaporation; but this is\r\n     only done when the pipe is old or not handsome. These stick\r\n     pipes are used by many persons, particularly in winter; in\r\n     summer the smoke is not so cool from them as from the kind\r\n     before mentioned. The bowl is of baked earth, colored red or\r\n     brown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRIAN AND HUNGARIAN PIPE STEMS.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the subject of the costly mouth-pieces of Oriental\r\npipes, we must say a few words concerning the extraordinary care\r\nbestowed on some kinds of plain wood sticks for stems or tubes.\r\nCherry-tree stems, under the name of agriots, constitute a specialty\r\nof Austrian manufacture. The fragrant cherry (prunus makaleb) is a\r\nnative of that country; and the young trees are cultivated with\r\nspecial reference to this application. They are all raised from seed.\r\nThe seedlings, when two years old, are planted in small pots, one in\r\neach; as they grow, every tendency to branching is choked by removing\r\nthe bud; and as they increase in size from year to year, they are\r\nshifted into larger pots or into boxes. Great care is taken to turn\r\nthem round daily, so that every part shall be equally exposed to\r\nsunshine. When the plants have attained a sufficient height they are\r\nallowed to form a small bushy head; but the daily care is continued\r\nuntil the stems grow to a proper thickness. They are then taken out\r\nof the ground, the roots and branches removed, and the stem bored\r\nthrough after being seasoned for some time. The care shown in rearing\r\ninsures a perfect straightness of stem, and an equable diameter of\r\nabout an inch or an inch and a half. The last specimens, when cut from\r\nthe tree, are as much as eight feet in length, dark purple-brown in\r\ncolor, and highly fragrant. At Pesth are made pipes about eighteen\r\ninches in length, of the shoots of the mock orange, remarkable for\r\ntheir quality in absorbing the oil of tobacco, they are flexible\r\nwithout being weak. The French make elegant pipe-bowls of the root of\r\nthe tree-heath, but their chief attention is directed, as far as\r\nconcerns wood pipes, to those of brier-root, which are made by them in\r\nlarge quantities. The bowl and the short stems are carried out of one\r\npiece, and the wood is credited with absorbing some of the rank oil of\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nAmber--the only kind of resin that rises to the dignity of a gem--is\r\nunfitted for the bowl of a tobacco-pipe, because it cannot well bear\r\nthe heat; but it is largely used for mouth-pieces, especially by\r\nwealthy Oriental smokers. The Turks have a belief that amber wards off\r\ninfection; an opinion which, whether right or wrong, tells well for\r\nthe amber workers. There has always been a mystery connected with this\r\nremarkable substance. So far back as the Phenicians, amber was picked\r\nup on the Baltic shore of what is now called Prussia; and the same\r\nregion has ever since been the chief store-house for it. Tacitus was\r\nnot far wrong when he conjectured that amber is a gum or resin exuded\r\nfrom certain trees, although other authorities have preferred a theory\r\nthat it is a kind of wax or fat which has undergone slow petrifaction.\r\nAt any rate, it must at one time have been liquid or semi-liquid; for\r\ninsects, flies, detached wings and legs, and small fragments of\r\nvarious kinds, are often found imbedded in it--those odds and ends of\r\nwhich Pope said:--\r\n\r\n  \"The things, we know, are neither rich nor rare;\r\n  The wonder's how the devil they got there!\"\r\n\r\nWhether new stores of amber are now being formed, or whether, like\r\ncoal, it was the result of causes not now in operation, is an unsolved\r\nproblem. The specimens obtained differ considerably; some are pale as\r\nprimrose, some deep orange or almost brown; some nearly as transparent\r\nas crystal, some nearly opaque. Large pieces, uniform in color and\r\ntranslucency, fetch high prices; and there are fashions in this matter\r\nfor which it is not easy to account,--seeing that the Turks and other\r\nOrientals buy up, at prices which Europeans are unwilling to give, all\r\nthe specimens presenting a straw-yellow color and a sort of cloudy\r\ntranslucency. The Russians, on the contrary, prefer orange-yellow\r\ntransparent specimens. The amber is seldom obtained by actual mining.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Searching for amber.]\r\n\r\nIt is usually found on sea-coasts, after storms, in rounded nodules;\r\nor, if scarce on shore, it is sought for by men clad in leather\r\ngarments, who wade up to their necks in the sea, and scrape the\r\nsea-bottom with hooped nets attached to the end of long poles; or\r\n(rather dangerous work) men go out in boats, and examine the faces of\r\nprecipitous cliffs, picking off, by means of iron hooks, the lumps of\r\namber which they may see here and there. Sometimes a piece weighing\r\nnearly a pound is found, and a weight of even ten pounds is recorded.\r\nAs small pieces can easily be joined by smoothing the surfaces,\r\nmoistening them with linseed oil, and pressing them together over a\r\ncharcoal fire, and as gum copal is sometimes very like amber, there is\r\nmuch sophistication indulged in, which none but an expert can guard\r\nagainst. In fashioning the nodules of amber, whether genuine or\r\nfictitious, into pipe mouth-pieces, they are split on a leaden plate\r\nin a turning lathe, smoothed into shape by whet-stones, rubbed with\r\nchalk and water, and polished with a piece of flannel. It is an\r\nespecially difficult kind of work; for unless the amber is allowed\r\nfrequent intervals for cooling, it becomes electrically excited by the\r\nfriction and shivers into fragments; the men, too, are put into\r\nnervous tremors if kept too long at work at one time. Amber is one of\r\nthe most electrically excitable of all known substances; in fact, the\r\nname electricity itself was derived from _electron_, the Greek name\r\nfor amber. Hookahs, chibouques, narghiles, meerschaums, all are\r\nlargely adorned with amber mouth-pieces. The mouth-piece often\r\nconsists of two or three pieces of amber, interjoined with ornaments\r\nof gold and gems; it is in such case the most costly part of the pipe.\r\n\r\nAt one of the greater industrial exhibitions four Turkish amames, or\r\namber mouth-pieces, were shown, illustrating clearly enough the value\r\nattached to choice specimens; two of them were worth £350 each, two\r\n£200 each, diamond studded. The Turkish and Persian pipes have often a\r\nsmall wooden tube inside the amber mouth-piece. They require frequent\r\ncleaning with a long wire and a bit of tow, and in some large towns\r\nthere are professional pipe-cleaners.\r\n\r\nThe natives of British Guiana have a curious kind of pipe, made of the\r\nrind of the fruit of the areca-palm, coiled up into a kind of cheroot,\r\nwith an internal hollow to hold the tobacco. The poorer Hindoos make a\r\nsimple pipe of two pieces of bamboo,--one cut close to a knot for the\r\nbowl, and a more slender piece for the tube. A lower class of natives\r\nin India make two holes of unequal length, with a piece of stick, in a\r\nclay soil; the holes are unequally inclined so as to meet at the\r\nbottom; the tobacco is placed in the shorter hole, and the smoker,\r\napplying his mouth to the longer, inhales the fumes in this primitive\r\nfashion. The pipes used for opium-smoking in various parts of the East\r\nhave small bowls; the drug is too costly to be used otherwise than in\r\nsmall portions at a time, and too powerful to need more than a few\r\nwhiffs to produce the opium-smoker's dreary delirium.\r\n\r\nThe Tunisians use reeds for pipes. Stone pipes are found among the\r\nnatives of Vancouver; while Strong Bow, the North American Indian\r\nchief, has his long wooden pipe of peace, decked out with tassels and\r\nfringes, but with an ominous-looking sharp steel cutting instrument\r\nnear the end most remote from the bowl.\r\n\r\nChinese, Japanese, Philippine Islanders, Madagascans, Central\r\nAfricans, Algerine Arabs, Mexicans, Paraguayans, Siamese, Tahitians,\r\nSouth American Indians, Mongols, Malays, Tartars, Turcomans, as well\r\nas the nations of Europe and the chief nations of Southern Asia, all\r\nhave their smoking-pipes, plain or ornate, as the case may be, and\r\nmade of wood, reeds, bamboo, bone, ivory, stone, earthenware, glass,\r\nporcelain, amber, agate, jade, precious metals and common metals,\r\naccording to the civilization of the country and the pecuniary means\r\nof the smoker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fancy pipes.]\r\n\r\n     \"The French clay pipes have quite a special character; they\r\n     are well made, and great ingenuity is shown in the\r\n     preparation of the moulds in which they are pressed; but\r\n     being mostly intended for a class of purchasers who prefer\r\n     grotesque ideas to refined taste, the bowls are often\r\n     ornamented with queer shaped heads, having bead-like eyes;\r\n     sometimes imaginary beings, sometimes caricature portraits\r\n     of eminent persons. Where more than the head is represented,\r\n     license is given to a certain grossness of idea; but this is\r\n     not a general characteristic. The clay of which these French\r\n     pipes are made is admitted to be superior to that of\r\n     England, due to the careful mixture of different kinds, and\r\n     to skilful manipulation.\r\n\r\n     \"We need not say much about Dutch pipes as distinct articles\r\n     of manufacture, because the process adopted in their\r\n     production are pretty much like those in use elsewhere. The\r\n     Dutch are famous clay-pipe smokers, not countenancing the\r\n     cigar so much as their neighbors the Belgians, nor the\r\n     meerschaum so largely as their German neighbors on the Rhine\r\n     frontier. A notable bit of sharp practice is on record in\r\n     connexion with the pipe-smokers of Holland--a dodge only to\r\n     be justified on the equivocal maxim that all is fair in\r\n     trade provided it just keeps within the margin we need not\r\n     speak. A pipe manufactory was established in Flanders about\r\n     the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\n     \"The Dutch makers, alarmed at the competition which this\r\n     threatened, cunningly devised a stratagem for nipping it in\r\n     the bud. They freighted a large worn-out ship with an\r\n     enormous quantity of pipes of their own make, sent it to\r\n     Ostend, and wrecked it there. By the municipal laws of that\r\n     city the wreck became public property; the pipes were sold\r\n     at prices so ridiculously low that the town was glutted with\r\n     the commodity; the new Flemish factory was thereby\r\n     paralyzed, ruined, and closed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Turks (especially those of the lower orders) use a kind of clay\r\npipe made of red earth decorated with gilding. The stem of the pipe is\r\nmade from a branch of jasmine, cherry tree or maple and is\r\nsufficiently long to rest on the floor when used by the smoker. A\r\nwriter in the _Tobacco Plant_ says of Old English Clay pipes:\r\n\r\n     \"Of all the various branches of the subject of tobacco, that\r\n     of the history of pipes is one of the most interesting, and\r\n     one that deserves every attention that can possibly be\r\n     given. Whether considered ethnographically, historically,\r\n     geographically, or archæologically, pipes present food for\r\n     speculation and research of at least equal importance to any\r\n     other set of objects that can be brought forward. Some\r\n     branches of the subject have already been treated in these\r\n     columns, and others, in what is intended shall follow, will\r\n     hereafter be discussed. The present article will be devoted\r\n     to 'Fairy Pipes' and the history of the earliest pipes of\r\n     this country. Smoking is an old and venerable institution in\r\n     this kingdom of ours, and dates far back beyond the\r\n     introduction of tobacco to our shores. Long before Sir\r\n     Walter Raleigh was thought of, there is reason to believe\r\n     herbs and leaves of one kind or other--coltsfoot, yarrow,\r\n     mouse-lax, sword-grass, dandelion, and other plants, and\r\n     even dried cow-dung--were smoked for one ailment or other,\r\n     and in some instances for relaxation and pleasure, and thus,\r\n     no doubt, became habitually used. These are still, in some\r\n     of our rural districts, smoked by people as cures for\r\n     various ailments, and are considered not only highly\r\n     efficacious but very pleasant. I have known these or other\r\n     herbs smoked through a stick from which the pith had been\r\n     removed, the bowl being formed of a lump of clay moulded by\r\n     the fingers at the time, and baked in the household fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clay and reed pipes.]\r\n\r\n     \"The small branches of the elder tree, or sometimes the stem\r\n     of the briar and bramble, are what I have seen used, but\r\n     even the stem of the hemlock and keckse are sometimes\r\n     brought into requisition for the purpose.\r\n\r\n     \"I believe that long before the time Dr. Wilson states on\r\n     the authority of Sharpe, that it was common within memory,\r\n     for the old wives of Annandale to smoke a dried white moss\r\n     gathered on the neighboring moors, which they declared to be\r\n     much sweeter than tobacco, and to have been in use long\r\n     before the American weed was heard of; before Sir Walter\r\n     Raleigh wooed and won Elizabeth Throgmorton, or Sir Richard\r\n     Granville voyaged to Virginia with Masters Ralph Layne,\r\n     Thomas Candish, John Arundell, Master Stukely, Bremize,\r\n     Vincent, Heryot, and John Clarke; before Sir Francis Drake\r\n     made his first voyage, or the Spanish Armada was dreamed of;\r\n     before Sir John Hawkins, Captain Price, Coft, Keat or others\r\n     for whom the honor of the introduction of tobacco has been\r\n     claimed, drew breath--smoking was to some extent indulged in\r\n     by our forefathers and (still medicinally, of course) in\r\n     this country. In mediæval times, when the Ceramic art was\r\n     but little practiced, and when all the domestic vessels that\r\n     were produced were of the rudest and coarsest character both\r\n     in material, form, and decoration, it is not to be expected\r\n     that pipes for the smoking of herbs would be manufactured as\r\n     a matter of sale, and those of the people who wished for\r\n     such an indulgence would naturally be thrown on their own\r\n     primitive resources such as I have described, for\r\n     instruments for the purpose.\r\n\r\n     \"A portion of a very rude pipe-head, formed of common red\r\n     clay--a lump of clay moulded by hand, and ornamented with\r\n     small circles pressed into it as from the end of a\r\n     stick--has come under my notice, as have also others of an\r\n     equally primitive character, found in different parts of\r\n     this kingdom. These I have no hesitation in ascribing to a\r\n     pre-Raleigh period. It is not to these, however, but to the\r\n     small pipes formerly used in this kingdom for smoking\r\n     tobacco, and tobacco alone, that I wish to draw attention.\r\n     Most people, especially in the Midland and Northern counties\r\n     of England, as well as in Scotland and Ireland, will have\r\n     heard the name of Fairy Pipes applied to the small,\r\n     old-fashioned, and sometimes oddly-shaped tobacco pipes\r\n     which are not infrequently turned up in digging and plowing\r\n     and other operations. To these and the general forms of old\r\n     English pipes, I purpose confining myself in the present\r\n     article. Many years ago I collected together a large number\r\n     of these 'Fairy Pipes' from all parts of the kingdom. Since\r\n     then, my own researches have, with the aid of inquiries\r\n     carried on for me, enabled me to bring forward many\r\n     interesting points, so as to verify dates of manufacture and\r\n     more fully to carry out their classification. Like their\r\n     Irish brethren and sisters, English people were formerly apt\r\n     to ascribe everything unusually small to the fairies, and\r\n     anything out of the common way to the people of very remote\r\n     ages.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus, these small pipes are commonly in England called\r\n     'fairy pipes,' or 'Carl's pipes,' or 'old man's pipes;' in\r\n     Ireland, where they are likewise known as 'fairy pipes,'\r\n     they are also called 'Dane's pipes;' and in Scotland, where\r\n     their common name is 'elf pipes,' or 'elfin pipes,' they\r\n     are, in like manner, known as 'Celtic pipes.' They are also\r\n     sometimes named 'Mab pipes,' or 'Queen's pipes,' from the\r\n     same fairy majesty, Queen Mab. Thus, while in each country\r\n     they are ascribed to the elfin race--the 'small people' of\r\n     Cornish folk-lore--their secondary names attach to them a\r\n     popular belief in their extreme antiquity. Anything\r\n     apparently old is at once, by the Irish, set down to the\r\n     'Danes;' by the Scots to the 'Celts;' and by people in the\r\n     rural districts of our own country to the 'carls,' or 'old\r\n     men'--carl being indicative of extreme antiquity. In\r\n     Ireland, the pipes are believed to have belonged to the\r\n     _cluricaunes_--a kind of wild, ungovernable, mischievous\r\n     fairy-demon--who were held in awe by the 'pisantry;' and\r\n     whenever found, these pipes were, with much superstitious\r\n     feeling, immediately broken up, so as to destroy and break\r\n     up the spell their finding might have cast around the\r\n     finder. But it was not only among the peasantry that this\r\n     belief in the extreme antiquity of tobacco pipes existed.\r\n\r\n     \"Serious essays were written to prove their pre-historic\r\n     origin, and to claim for them a history that in our day\r\n     reads as arrant nonsense. In 1784, a short pipe was asserted\r\n     to have been found between the jaws of the skull of an\r\n     ancient Milesian exhumed at Bannockstown, county Kildare.\r\n     Upon this discovery, an elaborate and learned paper was\r\n     written in the 'Anthologia Hibernica,' setting forth this\r\n     pipe as a proof of the use of tobacco in Ireland long before\r\n     that country was invaded by the Danes. This pipe has been\r\n     proved by comparison to be probably quite late in the reign\r\n     of Elizabeth. They also have a more modern pipe, the stem of\r\n     which describes one or more circles, while another is tied\r\n     in a knot, yet allows a free passage of air. At another\r\n     time, in opening an Anglo-Saxon grave mound, some of the men\r\n     employed came across a fairy pipe which evidently had rolled\r\n     down from among the surface-soil, and, being turned out in\r\n     juxtaposition with undoubted Anglo-Saxon remains, was\r\n     immediately set down by the learned director of the\r\n     proceedings as a relic of that period. At another time I had\r\n     brought to me, as a great curiosity, two 'Roman pipes,' as I\r\n     was informed--the finders jumping to the conclusion that\r\n     because they had dug them up at little Chester (the Roman\r\n     station Derventio), they must be Roman pipes! I believe they\r\n     expected to receive a large sum from these relics: how\r\n     grievously they were disappointed I need not tell. Instances\r\n     of this kind are far from rare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fairy pipes.]\r\n\r\n     \"I remember a man once bringing me some fragments of Roman\r\n     pottery and other things of the same period, which he had\r\n     turned up in the course of excavations, and among them was a\r\n     Tobacco stopper formed of a Sacheverell medal! and a George\r\n     II. half-penny, all of which he was ready to swear he had\r\n     found \"all of a heap together,\" inside a hypocaust tile,\r\n     which, on examination, certainly had remained _in situ_ from\r\n     Romano-British times! The cupidity of a man had evidently\r\n     led him to collect together these odds and ends, and try to\r\n     turn them to profitable account. Some twenty years ago, a\r\n     large number of \"elfin pipes\" were dug up at Bomington, near\r\n     Edinburgh, along with a quantity of placks or bodles of\r\n     James VI., which thus gave trustworthy evidence of their\r\n     true date. Others were found in the ancient cemetery at\r\n     North Berwick, adjoining to which is a small Romanesque\r\n     building of the Twelfth Century, close upon the shore.\r\n     Within the last half-century, the sea has made very great\r\n     inroads upon this ancient burial-place, carrying off a\r\n     considerable ruin, and exposing the skeletons, and bringing\r\n     to light many interesting relics at almost every\r\n     spring-tide. Among these, many pipes have been washed down.\r\n     A similar circumstance has occurred on the seashore at Hoy\r\n     Lake, Cheshire, where several \"fairy pipes\" have been found.\r\n\r\n     \"Notices of several discoveries occur. Dr. Wilson says, in\r\n     the statistical accounts of Scotland, many of which are\r\n     suggestive of a pre-Raleigh period. Thus, 'in an ancient\r\n     British encampment in the parish of Kirk Michael,\r\n     Dumfriesshire, on the farm of Gilrig, a number of pipes of\r\n     burnt clay were dug up, with heads smaller than the modern\r\n     tobacco-pipes, swelled at the middle and straighter at the\r\n     top. Again, in the vicinity of a group of standing stones at\r\n     Cairney Mount, in the parish of Carluke Lanarkshire, a celt\r\n     or stone hatchet, elfin bolts (flint and bone arrow-heads),\r\n     elfin pipes, numerous coins of the Edwards and of later\r\n     date, and other things are all stated to have been found.'\r\n     An example is also recorded of the discovery of a\r\n     tobacco-pipe in sinking a pit for coal, at Misk, in\r\n     Ayrshire, after digging through many feet of sand. All these\r\n     notes are pregnant with significant warnings of the\r\n     necessity for cautious discrimination in determining the\r\n     antiquity of such buried relics.\"\r\n\r\nIn Turkey the jasmine is cultivated for the purpose of pipe smoking.\r\nBarillet describes the growing of the common jasmine near\r\nConstantinople. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"The object sought is a long straight stem, free from leaves\r\n     and side branches. For this purpose the plants are grown\r\n     quickly in a rich soil, and drawn up by being grown in a\r\n     sheltered situation, to which the sun has little access at\r\n     the sides, but only at the top. Pinching is resorted to, and\r\n     during the second year's growth one end of a thread is\r\n     attached to the top of the jasmine stem. This thread passes\r\n     over a pulley attached to the post to which this jasmine is\r\n     trained, and from it is suspended a weight, the effect of\r\n     which is to keep the stem always in a vertical direction.\r\n     When the jasmine stem is about two centimeters (say three\r\n     quarters of an inch) in diameter a cloth is wrapped around\r\n     it to prevent access of dust and of the sun's rays. Twice or\r\n     thrice in the year the stem is washed with citron-water,\r\n     which is said to give the clear color so much esteemed. When\r\n     the stem has acquired a length of some fifteen feet, it is\r\n     cut down and perforated by the workmen, and fitted with a\r\n     terra-cotta bow and an amber mouth-piece.\"\r\n\r\nBlackburn, in his work entitled \"Artists and Arabs,\" gives the\r\nfollowing picture of life and manners in Algiers:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Female smoking in Algiers.]\r\n\r\n     \"There is one difficulty here, however, for the artist--that\r\n     of finding satisfactory models. You can get one at last, and\r\n     here is her portrait. Her costume, when she throws off her\r\n     haik (and with it a tradition of the Mohammedan faith, that\r\n     forbids her to show her face to an unbeliever), is a rich,\r\n     loose, crimson jacket embroidered with gold, a thin white\r\n     bodice, loose silk trousers reaching to the knee and\r\n     fastened round the waist by a magnificent sash of various\r\n     colors, red morocco slippers, a profusion of rings on her\r\n     little fingers, and bracelets and anklets of gold filagree\r\n     work. Through her waving black hair are twined strings of\r\n     coins and the folds of a silk handkerchief, the hair falling\r\n     at the back in plaits below the waist. She is not beautiful,\r\n     she is scarcely interesting in expression, and she is\r\n     decidedly unsteady. She seems to have no more power of\r\n     keeping herself in one position or of remaining in one part\r\n     of the room, or even of being quiet, than a humming-top. The\r\n     whole thing is an unutterable bore to her, for she does not\r\n     even reap the reward--her father, or husband, or other male\r\n     attendant always taking the money. She is petite,\r\n     constitutionally phlegmatic, and as fat as her parents can\r\n     manage to make her; she has small hands and feet, large\r\n     rolling eyes--the latter made to appear artificially large\r\n     by the application of henna or antimony black; her attitudes\r\n     are not ungraceful, but there is a want of character about\r\n     her, and an utter abandonment to the situation, peculiar to\r\n     all her race. In short, her movements are more suggestive of\r\n     a little caged animal that had better be petted and\r\n     caressed, or kept at a safe distance, according to her\r\n     humor. She does one thing--she smokes incessantly, and makes\r\n     cigarettes with a skill and rapidity which are wonderful.\r\n     Her age is thirteen, and she has been married six months;\r\n     her ideas appear to be limited to three or four, and her\r\n     pleasures, poor creature, are equally circumscribed. She had\r\n     scarcely ever left her father's house, and had never spoken\r\n     to a man until her marriage. There seems to be in the\r\n     Moorish nature a wonderful sense of harmony and contrasts of\r\n     color. Two Orientals will hardly walk down a street side by\r\n     side unless the colors of their costumes harmonize. You find\r\n     a negress selling oranges or citrons; an Arab boy with red\r\n     fez and white turban, carrying purple fruit in a basket of\r\n     leaves--always the right juxtaposition of colors. The sky\r\n     furnishes them a superb background of deep blue, and the\r\n     repose of these solemn Orientals, who sit here like bronze\r\n     statues, save that they smoke incessantly, inspires you with\r\n     a curious respect. They are men who believe in fate--what\r\n     need that they should make haste?\"\r\n\r\nIn Africa the pipes are made of clay and horn, and are mostly rude\r\naffairs, but well suited to their ideas of implements used for holding\r\ntobacco. King gives the following description of smoking among them:--\r\n\r\n     \"A party of headmen and older warriors, seated cross-legged\r\n     in their tents, ceremoniously smoked the daghapipe, a kind\r\n     of hookah, made of bullock's horn, its downward point filled\r\n     with water, and a reed stem let into the side, surmounted by\r\n     a rough bowl of stone, which is filled with the dagha, a\r\n     species of hemp, very nearly, if not the same, as the Indian\r\n     bang. Each individual receives it in turn, opens his jaws to\r\n     their full extent, and placing his lips to the wide mouth of\r\n     the horn, takes a few pulls and passes it on. Retaining the\r\n     last draught of smoke in his mouth, which he fills with a\r\n     decoction of bark and water from a calabash, he squirts it\r\n     on the ground by his side through a long ornamented tube in\r\n     his left hand, performing thereon, by the aid of a reserved\r\n     portion of the liquid, a sort of boatswain's whistle,\r\n     complacently regarding the soap-like bubbles, the joint\r\n     production of himself and neighbor. It appeared to be a sign\r\n     of special friendliness and kindly feeling to squirt into\r\n     the same hole.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: African pipe.]\r\n\r\nWe give an engraving of a kind of pipe used by the natives of interior\r\nAfrica. It is made of clay, and holds but a small portion of the weed.\r\nThe natives are great smokers and indulge in it almost constantly, but\r\ntheir love for it can hardly exceed that of the more hardy Laplanders,\r\nwho are described as \"passionately fond of the plant.\" Nothing is so\r\nindispensable as tobacco to their existence. A Laplander who cannot\r\nget Tobacco sucks chips of a barrel or pieces of anything else which\r\nhas contained it. Tobacco gives the Laplanders a pleasure which often\r\nrises to ecstacy. They both chew and smoke, and they are certainly the\r\ndirtiest chewers in the world. When they chew they spit in their\r\nhands, then raise them to their nose that they may inhale from the\r\nsaliva the irritating principles of the plant. Thus they satisfy two\r\nsenses at the same time. They regularly smoke after their meals. If\r\ntheir supply of Tobacco falls short, they sit down in a circle and\r\npass the pipe round, so that every one in his turn may have a\r\nwhiff.[53]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 53: Reynard, in his \"Travels In Lapland,\" says\r\n              of the use of tobacco: \"We interrogated our Laplander\r\n              upon many subjects. We asked him what he had given his\r\n              wife at their marriage. He told us that she had been\r\n              very expensive to him during his courtship, having cost\r\n              him two pounds weight of tobacco and four or five pints\r\n              of brandy.\"]\r\n\r\n\"A Painter's Camp in the Highlands\" defends the custom of smoking in\r\nthe following well chosen words:\r\n\r\n     \"People who don't smoke--especially ladies--are exceedingly\r\n     unfair and unjust to those who do. The reader has, I\r\n     daresay, amongst his acquaintances ladies who, on hearing\r\n     any habitual cigar-smoker spoken of, are always ready to\r\n     exclaim against the enormity of such an expensive and\r\n     useless indulgence; and the cost of Tobacco-smoking is\r\n     generally cited by its enemies as one of the strongest\r\n     reasons for its general discontinuance. One would imagine,\r\n     to hear these people talk, that smoking was the only\r\n     selfish indulgence in the world. When people argue in this\r\n     strain, I immediately assume the offensive. I roll back the\r\n     tide of war right into the enemy's intrenched camp of\r\n     comfortable customs; I attack the expensive and unnecessary\r\n     indulgences of ladies and gentlemen who do not smoke. I take\r\n     cigar-smoking as an expense of, say, half-a-crown a-day, and\r\n     pipe-smoking at threepence.\r\n\r\n     \"I then compare the cost of these indulgences with the cost\r\n     of other indulgences not a whit more necessary, which no one\r\n     ever questions a man's right to if he can pay for them.\r\n     There is luxurious eating, for instance. A woman who has got\r\n     the habit of delicate eating will easily consume dainties to\r\n     the amount of half-a-crown a-day, which cannot possibly do\r\n     her any good beyond the mere gratification of the palate.\r\n     And there is the luxury of carriage-keeping, in many\r\n     instances very detrimental to the health of women, by\r\n     entirely depriving them of the use of their legs. Now, you\r\n     cannot keep a carriage a-going quite as cheaply as a pipe.\r\n     Many a fine meerschaum keeps up its cheerful fire on a\r\n     shilling a-week. I am not advocating a sumptuary law to put\r\n     down carriages and cookery; I desire only to say that people\r\n     who indulge in these expensive and wholly superfluous\r\n     luxuries, have no right to be so hard on smokers for their\r\n     indulgence.\r\n\r\n     \"Nearly every gentleman who drinks good wine at all will\r\n     drink the value of half-a-crown a-day. The ladies do not\r\n     blame him for this. Half-a-dozen glasses of good wine are\r\n     not thought an extravagance in any man of fair means, but\r\n     women exclaim when a man spends the same amount in smoking\r\n     cigars. The French habit of coffee-drinking and the English\r\n     habit of tea-drinking are also cases in point. They are\r\n     quite as expensive as ordinary Tobacco-smoking, and, like\r\n     it, defensible only on the ground of the pleasurable\r\n     sensation they communicate to the nervous system. But these\r\n     habits are so universal that no one thinks of attacking\r\n     them, unless now and then some persecuted smoker in\r\n     self-defence.\r\n\r\n     \"Tea and tobacco are alike seductive, delicious, and\r\n     deleterious. The two indulgences will, perhaps, become\r\n     equally necessary to the English world. It is high treason\r\n     to the English national feeling to say a word against tea,\r\n     which is now so universally recognized as a national\r\n     beverage that people forget it comes from China, and that it\r\n     is both alien and heathen. Still, I mean no offence when I\r\n     put tea in the same category with Tobacco. Now, who thinks\r\n     of lecturing us on the costliness of tea? And yet it is a\r\n     mere superfluity. The habit of taking it as we do is unknown\r\n     across the Channel, and was quite unknown amongst ourselves\r\n     a very little time ago, when English people were no less\r\n     proud of themselves and their customs than they are now, and\r\n     perhaps with equally good reason. A friend of mine tells me\r\n     that he smokes every day, at a cost of about sixpence\r\n     a-week. Now, I would like to know in what other way so much\r\n     enjoyment is to be bought for sixpence. Fancy the\r\n     satisfaction of spending sixpence a-week in wine! It is well\r\n     enough to preach about the selfishness of this expenditure;\r\n     but we all spend more selfishly, and we all love pleasure,\r\n     and I should very much like to see that cynic whose\r\n     pleasures cost less than sixpence a-week.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Egyptian pipes.]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian pipes, especially those of modern date are exceedingly\r\nfanciful in shape and resemble somewhat the pipes used by the\r\nPersians. Many of them are made of clay and are sold very cheap.[54]\r\nThe Chinese use a variety of pipes but all of them have small bowls\r\nfor the tobacco. Some of their pipes are made of brass and attached to\r\nthe pipe is a receptacle for water, so as to cool the smoke before it\r\npasses into the mouth. The Japanese use both copper and silver pipes,\r\nmost of them similar in shape and size to those used by the Chinese.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 54: Watlin says of smoking in Egypt: \"Tobacco\r\n              is tolerated, and seems to become more common again,\r\n              though a smoker is generally disliked and not allowed to\r\n              perform the part of Imam or rehearse, of the prayers,\r\n              before a congregation. The greater part of the people,\r\n              however, detest and condemn still the use of tobacco,\r\n              and I remember a Shaumar Bedawry who assured me that he\r\n              would not carry that abominable herb on his Camel, even\r\n              if a load of gold were given him.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Japanese pipes.]\r\n\r\nA writer says of smoking among the Japanese:\r\n\r\n     \"Let us sit down to a good Japanese dinner--down on the\r\n     floor. Food on the floor. Fire and cigars or pipes on the\r\n     floor. Sit on your heels, waiting. Enter first\r\n     course--Fish-skin soup. Smoke. Third--Fish, cake and\r\n     bean-cheese. Smoke. Fourth--Row fish and horse-radish.\r\n     Smoke. Fifth--Broiled fish. Smoke again, Sixth--Custard\r\n     soup. Smoke. Seventh--Chicken stew, turnips and onions.\r\n     Smoke a little. Eighth--Cuttle-fish, wafer cakes, Nipon tea.\r\n     Here, if tired you can stop at the end of about two hours'\r\n     ankle-ache. All is cleanly, well spiced with talk, and\r\n     served with the utmost politeness. Sipping tea may be\r\n     substituted for the infinitesimal whiffs of polite smoking.\r\n     A grand dinner is much more elaborate; at least, so far as\r\n     the variety of smokes is concerned. After dinner, rest and\r\n     smoke.\"\r\n\r\nAn English writer could very appropriately call this a cloud of smoke\r\nas he has another scene herein described.\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis all smoke, possibly, but what cannot we discern,\r\n     through a cloud of smoke? Objects dim, but\r\n\r\n          'Thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks\r\n           In Vallambrosa.'\r\n\r\n     Be the medium of the smoke an honest 'churchwarden,' a short\r\n     clay, or a costly meerschaum; does the smoke emanate from a\r\n     refined Havana, a neat Manilla, or a dainty cigarette, such\r\n     as we are at this moment enjoying as a sequel to a modest\r\n     breakfast, 'tis all smoke.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thus given a somewhat lengthy description of the custom and\r\nimplements used in smoking, from the first discovery of the plant\r\nuntil now, and turn to other implements used in connection with the\r\npipe. We, however, give the following from Cop's \"Tobacco Plant,\"\r\ndescriptive of the part played by tobacco on the stage two centuries\r\nago:\r\n\r\n     \"The 'Return from Parnassus' was published anonymously, and\r\n     the copy I have used is dateless. It was 'publicly acted by\r\n     the students of St. John's College in Cambridge.' In Act I.,\r\n     Scene 2d, characters are given of Spenser, Ben Jonson,\r\n     Marlow, Drayton, Marston and Shakespeare, together with some\r\n     other of the known poets and dramatists of the Elizabethan\r\n     age. It contains many references to tobacco. In 'Act IV.,\r\n     Scene 1st,' the characters are thus placed: 'Sir Rodericke\r\n     and Prodigo at one corner of the stage, Recorder and\r\n     Amaretto at the other. Two pages scouring of Tobacco pipes.'\r\n     Actual smoking from tobacco-pipes was introduced on the\r\n     stage afterwards; and instances from the early dramas have\r\n     been given by the writers on tobacco history. In the second\r\n     scene of Act III. smoking is alluded to as one of the marks\r\n     of the current man of fashion, and is coupled with that of\r\n     wearing love-locks, which was to prove such a scandal to the\r\n     Puritans. 'He gins to follow fashions. He wore thin\r\n     sireduelt in a smooky roofe, must take tobacco and must\r\n     weare a locke.' 'Work for Chimney Sweepers, or a Warning\r\n     against Tobacconists, by J. H.,' was published in quarto in\r\n     the year 1602.\r\n\r\n     \"It was answered in the same year by the anonymous 'Defence\r\n     of Tobacco,' a quarto of seventy pages. The author of the\r\n     attack followed the line of King James, or, I should rather\r\n     say, showed him the line to take, for the King's\r\n     'Counterblast' did not appear until he had been King of\r\n     England for some years. The book is divided into sections,\r\n     each section being called 'A Reason.' The seventh 'Reason'\r\n     against the use of tobacco is, that the devil is the\r\n     discoverer and suggester of smoking. 'It was first used and\r\n     practised,' says J. H., 'by devils, priests, and, therefore,\r\n     not to be used by us Christians. That the devil was the\r\n     first author hereof. Monardus, in his 'Treatise of Tabaco,'\r\n     dooth sufficiently witnesse, saying: The Indian priests,\r\n     who, no doubt, were instruments of the devil, whom they\r\n     serve, even before they answer to questions propounded to\r\n     them by their princes, drinke of this tobacco-fume, with the\r\n     vigour and strength whereof they fall suddenly to the ground\r\n     as dead men, remaining so according to the quantity of smoke\r\n     that they had taken. And when the hearbe hath done his\r\n     worke, they revive and wake, giving answers according to the\r\n     vissions and illusions which they saw while they were wrapt\r\n     in that order.' It is not unlikely that J. H.'s authority\r\n     had confused opium with tobacco.\r\n\r\n     \"It was the opinion of the age that every Pagan deity had a\r\n     real existence in the world of evil spirits. After further\r\n     quotations of Monardus, to prove that the devil is 'the\r\n     author of Tobacco, and of the knowledge thereof,' J. H.\r\n     concludes his seventh reason by declaring, 'Wherefore in\r\n     mine opinion this practice is more to be excluded of us\r\n     Christians, who follow Veritie and Truth, and detest and\r\n     abhor the devil as a lyar and deceiver of mankind.' In the\r\n     first year of this century, pipes were not only exhibited,\r\n     but were used upon the stage. They seem at first to have\r\n     been smoked, not during 'the induction.' In the induction to\r\n     Ben Jonson's 'Cynthia's Revels' (1601), the Third Child\r\n     says: 'Now, sir, suppose I am one of your genteel auditors,\r\n     that am come in, having paid my money at the door, with much\r\n     ado; and here take my place, and sit down, I have my three\r\n     sorts of tobacco in my pocket, my light by me, and thus I\r\n     begin.' The Third Child thereupon smokes; but it seems as if\r\n     the smoking on the stage was a kind of protest against a\r\n     prior smoking in the pit. In John Webster's 'Malcontent,' as\r\n     augmented by John Marston in 1604, Sly says in the\r\n     introduction: 'Come, coose, (coz or goose!) let's take some\r\n     tobacco.'\r\n\r\n     \"In 'The Puritan, or the Widow of Watling Street,' published\r\n     in 1607, and attributed by some to Shakespeare,\r\n     tobacco-taking or tobacco-drinking (as smoking was then\r\n     usually called) appears no longer in the induction, but in\r\n     the play itself, Idle, the highwayman, says to the old\r\n     soldier, Skirmish, 'Have you any tobacco about you?' Idle\r\n     being supplied, smokes a pipe on the stage. These extracts,\r\n     however, may have been cited before, together with others of\r\n     like character in the great days of the English Drama. Pipes\r\n     continued to appear upon the stage until its abolition (in\r\n     company with the Prayer Book) by the Puritan rulers. They\r\n     reappeared on the stage of the Restoration. In Thomas\r\n     Shadwell's 'Virtuos' (1676),--to take one instance,--Mirando\r\n     and Clarinda fling away Snarl's cane, hat and periwig, and\r\n     break his pipes, because he 'takes nasty tobacco before\r\n     ladies.'\"\r\n\r\nThere is printed evidence, however, in this same period to show not\r\nonly that all the English ladies of the time were not enemies to\r\ntobacco, but that some of them were themselves smokers. In 1674 an\r\nanonymous quarto appeared under the title of \"The Women's Petition\r\nagainst Coffee.\" It was a protest against the growing influence of the\r\ncoffee-houses in seducing men away from their homes to sit together\r\nmaking mischief and drinking \"this boiled soot.\" It was answered in\r\nthe same year by \"The Men's Answer to the Women's Petition.\" After\r\nspeaking of the providential introduction of coffee into England in\r\nthe midst of the Puritan epoch, when Englishmen wanted some kind of\r\ndrink which would \"at once make them sober and merry,\" the writer\r\nglorifies the coffee-house.\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor, \"the Water Poet,\" made a kind of compromise when he\r\nattributed the introduction of tobacco, not to the devil, but to\r\nPluto,--\"Pluto's Proclamation concerning his Infernal Pleasure for the\r\nPropagation of Tobacco.\" It appears in the folio collection of his\r\nworks of the year 1628. The confusion of tobacco with opium and such\r\ndestructive drugs seems to have been common with the travelers of the\r\nSixteenth and Seventeenth centuries. Camerarius, in his \"Historical\r\nMeditations,\" translated into English by John Malle (folio, 1621),\r\nspeaks of tobacco as to be seen growing in many gardens throughout\r\nEurope. He quotes Jerome Benzo as saying that in Hispaniola \"there be\r\namong them some that take so much of it, as their senses being all\r\novercome and made drunke with the same, they fell down flat to the\r\nground as if they were dead, and there lie without sense or feeling\r\nmost part of the day or of the night.\"\r\n\r\nThe tobacco-box, during the reign of Elizabeth, was no unimportant\r\npart of a dandy's outfit; sometimes a pouch or bag was used.\r\nTobacco-boxes came into general use in England soon after the\r\nintroduction of tobacco, and were much sought after by all who \"drank\"\r\ntobacco. Marston, the Duke of New Castle, and other dramatists,\r\nalluded to the tobacco-box as a part of the smoker's outfit; thus in\r\nthe play of \"The Man in the Moone\" (1609), one character, in answer to\r\nan inquiry who one of the company is, answers: \"I know not certainly,\r\nbut I think he cometh to play you a fit of mirth, for I behelde pipes\r\nin his pocket; now he draweth forth his tinder-box and his touchwood,\r\nand falleth to his tacklings; sure his throate is on fire, the smoke\r\nflyeth so fast from his mouth; blesse his beard with a bason of water,\r\nlest he burn it; some terrible thing he taketh, it maketh him pant and\r\nlook pale, and hath an odious taste, he spitteth so after it.\"\r\n\r\nThe tobacco boxes of the Seventeenth Century were much larger than\r\nthose of the present. Some of them held a pound of tobacco besides\r\nspace for a number of pipes.\r\n\r\nMany of them were made of brass while others were fashioned from horn:\r\n\r\n     \"There is also a simple and ingenious tobacco-box used\r\n     frequently in ale-houses, 'which keeps its own account,'\r\n     with each smoker and acts also as a money-box. It is kept on\r\n     parlor tables for the use of all comers; but none can obtain\r\n     a pipe-full, till the money is deposited through a hole in\r\n     the lid. A penny dropped in, causes a bolt to unfasten, and\r\n     allow the smoker to help himself from a drawer full of\r\n     tobacco. His honor is trusted so far as not to take more\r\n     than his pipe-full, and he is reminded of it by a verse\r\n     engraved on the lid:--\r\n\r\n          'The custom is, before you fill,\r\n          'To put a penny in the till.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Engraved boxes.]\r\n\r\nSome of the tobacco boxes were made of silver and beautifully engraved\r\nwith fancy sketches, historical scenes, or representations of\r\npersonages, landscapes, flowers, etc. The late Duke of Sussex had a\r\nlarge collection of pipes and tobacco boxes.\r\n\r\nA journal describing them says of the collection:\r\n                                                  \"The Duke of Sussex\r\n     had a wonderful collection of these, the values attached to\r\n     some of them being almost fabulous. One example from the\r\n     work-shop of Vienna--long celebrated for this description of\r\n     art,--represented the combat of Hector and Achilles, the\r\n     cover of the pipe being a golden hemlet cristatus of the\r\n     Grecian type.\"\r\n                    Swiss and Tyrolean artists also produce exquisite\r\ncarving, but use wood as a material; and in the famous collection of\r\nBaron de Watteville will be found a marvelous piece of carving\r\nrepresenting Bellerophon overturning the Chimera. But French pipes are\r\nthe most interesting of all to collectors, from the fact that tobacco\r\nwas introduced into that country long before it was known in England,\r\nand also from the ingenuity of a people who can give interest of\r\nvarious kinds to what might seem a simple and prosaic branch of\r\nmanufacture. In the sentiment of the following lines on \"A pipe of\r\nTobacco\" by John Usher, all lovers of the plant will heartily join:\r\n\r\n  \"Let the toper regale in his tankard of ale,\r\n  Or with alcohol moisten his thropple,\r\n  Only give me I pray, a good pipe of soft clay,\r\n  Nicely tapered, and thin in the stopple;\r\n  And I shall puff, puff, let who will say enough,\r\n  No luxury else I'm in lack o',\r\n  No malice I hoard, 'gainst Queen, Prince, Duke or Lord,\r\n  While I pull at my pipe of Tobacco.\r\n\r\n  \"When I feel the hot strife of the battle of life,\r\n  And the prospect is aught but enticin',\r\n  Mayhap some real ill like a protested bill,\r\n  Dims the sunshine that tinged the horizon;\r\n  Only let me puff, puff,--be they ever so rough,\r\n  All the sorrows of life I lose track o',\r\n  The mists disappear, and the vista is clear,\r\n  With a soothing mild pipe of Tobacco.\r\n\r\n  \"And when joy after pain, like the sun after rain,\r\n  Stills the waters, long turbid and troubled,\r\n  That life's current may flow, with a ruddier glow,\r\n  And the sense of enjoyment be doubled,--\r\n  Oh! let me puff, puff, till I feel _quantum suff_,\r\n  Such luxury still I'm in lack o',\r\n  Be joy ever so sweet, it would be incomplete,\r\n  Without a good pipe of tobacco.\r\n\r\n  \"Should my recreant muse,--Sometimes apt to refuse\r\n  The guidance of bit and of bridle,\r\n  Still blankly demur, spite of whip and of spur,\r\n  Unimpassioned, inconstant, or idle;\r\n  Only let me puff, puff, till the brain cries enough,\r\n  Such excitement is all I'm in lack o',\r\n  And the poetic vein soon to fancy gives reign,\r\n  Inspired by a pipe of Tobacco.\r\n\r\n  \"And when with one accord, round the jovial board,\r\n  In friendship our bosoms are glowing;\r\n  While with toast and with song we the evening prolong,\r\n  And with nectar the goblets are flowing;\r\n  Still let us puff, puff--be life smooth, be it rough,\r\n  Such enjoyment we're ever in lack o';\r\n  The more peace and goodwill will abound as we fill\r\n  A jolly good pipe of Tobacco.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco jars.]\r\n\r\nThe tobacco jar is another accessory of more recent date than tobacco\r\npipes but interesting from the varieties of style and shapes. The\r\nfinest are made of porcelain and are lavish in design and enrichment.\r\nOf all the articles of the smokers' paraphernalia none however exhibit\r\nmore fanciful designs than Tobacco-stoppers used by smokers for\r\ncrowding the tobacco into the pipe while smoking. The author of \"A\r\nPaper of Tobacco\" says:\r\n\r\n     \"This was the only article on which the English smoker\r\n     prided himself. It was made of various materials--wood,\r\n     bone, ivory, mother-of-pearl, and silver: and the forms\r\n     which it assumed were exceedingly diversified. Out of a\r\n     collection of upwards of thirty tobacco-stoppers of\r\n     different ages, from 1688 to the present time, the following\r\n     are the most remarkable: a bear's tooth tipped with silver\r\n     at the bottom, and inscribed with the name of Captain James\r\n     Rogers of the Happy Return whaler, 1688; Dr. Henry\r\n     Sacheverel in full canonicals, carved in ivory, 1710; a\r\n     boat, a horse's hind leg, Punch, and another character in\r\n     the same Drama, to wit: his Satanic majesty; a countryman\r\n     with a flail; a milkmaid; an emblem of Priopus; Hope and\r\n     Anchor; the Marquis of Granby; a greyhound's head and neck;\r\n     a paviour's rammer; Lord Nelson; the Duke of Wellington; and\r\n     Bonaparte. The tobacco-stopper was carried in the pocket or\r\n     attached to a ring worn on the finger.\"\r\n\r\nIn Butler's Hudibras it is alluded to in connection with the\r\nastronomer's sign.\r\n\r\n  \"----Bless us! quoth he,\r\n  It is a planet now I see;\r\n  And if I err not, by his proper\r\n  Figure that's like tobacco-stopper,\r\n  It should be Saturn!\"\r\n\r\nIn James Boswell's \"Shrubs of Parnassus\" (1760) a description in verse\r\nof the various kinds of tobacco-stoppers is given:\r\n\r\n  \"O! let me grasp thy waist, be thou of wood\r\n  Or levigated steel, for well 'tis known\r\n  Thy habit is disease. In iron clad\r\n  Sometimes thy feature roughen to the sight,\r\n  And oft transparent art thou seen in glass,\r\n  Portending frangibility. The son\r\n  Of laboring mechanism here displays\r\n  Exuberance of skill. The curious knot,\r\n  The motley flourish winding down the sides,\r\n  And freaks of fancy pour upon the view\r\n  Their complicated charms, and as they please,\r\n  Astonish. While with glee thy touch I feel,\r\n  No harm my fingers dread. No fractured pipe\r\n  I ask, or splinters aid, wherewith to press\r\n  The rising ashes down. Oh! bless my hand,\r\n  Chief when thou com'st with hollow circle crowned\r\n  With sculptured signet, bearing in thy womb\r\n  The treasured Cork-screw. Thus a triple service\r\n  In firm alliance may'st thou boast.\"\r\n\r\nTobacco-stoppers were often made of wood from some relic like a\r\ncelebrated tree or mansion which gave additional value by its\r\nhistoric associations. Taylor alludes to several made from the well\r\nknown Glastonbury thorn. He says:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco stoppers.]\r\n\r\n     \"I saw the sayd branch, I did take a dead sprigge from it,\r\n     wherewith I made two or three tobacco-stoppers, which I\r\n     brought to London.\"\r\n\r\nPipes and tobacco-stoppers have often been favorite testimonials of\r\nfriendship and reward. Fairholt says:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was the custom during the last century to present\r\n     country churchwardens with tobacco-boxes, after the faithful\r\n     discharge of their duties.\"\r\n\r\nThe following lines from \"The Tobacco Leaf,\" penned by some favored\r\none on receiving a rare pipe, are no doubt as neat as the object that\r\ncalled them forth:--\r\n\r\n    \"I lifted off the lid with anxious care,\r\n    Removed the wrappages, strip after strip,\r\n    And when the hidden contents were laid bare,\r\n    My first remark was: \"Mercy, what a pipe!\"\r\n\r\n    A pipe of symmetry that matched its size,\r\n    Mounted with metal bright--a sight to see--\r\n    With the rich umber hue that smokers prize,\r\n    Attesting both its age and pedigree.\r\n\r\n    A pipe to make the royal Freidrich jealous,\r\n    Or the great Teufelsdrockh with envy gripe!\r\n    A man should hold some rank above his fellows\r\n    To justify his smoking such a pipe!\r\n\r\n    What country gave it birth? What blest of cities\r\n    Saw it first kindle at the glowing coal?\r\n    What happy artist murmured \"_Nunc dimittis_,\"\r\n    When he had fashioned this transcendent bowl!\r\n\r\n    Has it been hoarded in a monarch's treasures?\r\n    Was it a gift of peace, or price of war?\r\n    Did the great Khalif in his \"Houre of Pleasures,\"\r\n    Wager and lose it to the good Zaafar?\r\n\r\n    It may have soothed mild Spenser's melancholy,\r\n    While musing o'er traditions of the past,\r\n    Or graced the lips of brave Sir Walter Raleigh,\r\n    Ere sage King Jamie blew his \"Counterblast.\"\r\n\r\n    Did it, safe hidden in some secret cavern,\r\n    Escape that monarch's pipoclastic ken?\r\n    Has Shakespeare smoked it at the Mermaid Tavern,\r\n    Quaffing a cup of sack with rare old Ben?\r\n\r\n    Ay, Shakespeare might have watched his vast creation\r\n    Loom through its smoke--the spectre-haunted Thane,\r\n    The Sisters at their ghostly invocations,\r\n    The jealous Moor and melancholy Dane.\r\n\r\n    Round its orbed haze and through its mazy ringlets,\r\n    Titania may have led her elfin rout,\r\n    Or Ariel fanned it with his gauzy winglets,\r\n    Or Puck danced in the bowl to put it out.\r\n\r\n    Vain are all fancies--questions bring no answer;\r\n    The smokers vanish, but the pipe remains;\r\n    He were indeed a subtle necromancer,\r\n    Could read their records in its cloudy stains.\r\n\r\n    Nor this alone: its destiny may doom it\r\n    To outlive e'en its use and history--\r\n    Some ploughman of the future may exhume it\r\n    From soil now deep beneath the eastern sea.\r\n\r\n    And, treasured by some antiquarian Stultus,\r\n    It may to gaping visitors be shown,\r\n    Labelled: \"The symbol of some ancient Cultus,\r\n    Conjecturally Phallic, but unknown.\"\r\n\r\n    Why do I thus recall the ancient quarrel\r\n    'Twixt Man and Time, that marks all earthly things?\r\n    Why labor to re-word the hackneyed moral,\r\n    [Greek: Ôs phhyllôngenehê], as Homer sings?\r\n\r\n    For this: Some links we forge are never broken:\r\n    Some feelings claim exemption from decay;\r\n    And Love, of which this pipe was but the token,\r\n    Shall last, though pipes and smokers pass away.\"\r\n\r\nThe verse that has been written in praise as well as dispraise of the\r\n\"Indian Novelty\" would of itself fill a volume of no \"mean\r\npretentions.\" The following clever lines from The Tobacco Plant\r\nentitled \"Puffs from a Pipe,\" convey much advice to all smokers of\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\n    Sage old friend!

A modern English\r\npoet on hearing of the result produced on a cow from chewing tobacco,\r\npenned the following sad lines which he entitles--\"An elegy on\r\nsomebody's Cow.\"\r\n\r\n  Weep! weep, ye chewers! Lowly bend, and bow;\r\n  Here lieth what was once a happy cow.\r\n  No more her voice she'll raise, now low, now high,\r\n  In amber fields, beneath an autumn sky;\r\n  No more she'll wander to the milking-pail,\r\n  While swine stand by to see her chew \"pig-tail;\"\r\n  No more round her the bees, a busy crew,\r\n  Shall linger, eager after \"honey-dew;\"\r\n  No more for her shall smoking grains be spread:\r\n  All bellowless remains her empty shed.\r\n\r\n  Sad was her fate. Reflect, all ye who read:\r\n  Life's flower destroyed by the accursed weed.\r\n  When first the yellow juice streamed o'er her lip,\r\n  One might have said, \"This is a sad cow-slip.\"\r\n  To chew the peaceful cud by nature bid,\r\n  Degraded man taught her to chew a quid.\r\n  Sad the effect on body and on mind:\r\n  Her coat grew \"shaggy,\" her milk nicotined;\r\n  Over her head shall naught but clover grow,\r\n  While o'er her peaceful grave the clouds shall blow.\r\n\r\n  No invalid shall ask for her cow-heel,\r\n  To heal his ailments with the simple meal;\r\n  Her whiskful tail into no soup shall go;\r\n  Mother of \"weal\" that would but bring us woe.\r\n  Her tripe shall honor not the festive meal,\r\n  Where smoking onions all their joys reveal;\r\n  Nor shall those shins that oft lagged on the road,\r\n  Be sold in cheap cook-shops as \"_a la mode_,\"\r\n  Her tongue must soon be sandwiched under ground,\r\n  Nor at pic-nics with cheap champagne go round;\r\n  Yea, even her poor bones are past all hope--\r\n  Not fit to be boiled down for scented soap.\r\n\r\n  Ah! hide her hide, poor beast. Her stomachs five\r\n  Dyed with the chewing she could not survive;\r\n  The very worms from her will turn away,\r\n  To seek some anti-chewer for their prey.\r\n  Ye chewers! be ye pilgrims to her tomb;\r\n  Lament with us o'er her untimely doom.\r\n  Awhile she stood the anti-chewer's butt,\r\n  Till scythe-arm'd Time gave her an \"ugly cut.\"\r\n  She stagger'd to her death, and feebly cried,\r\n  And sneezed, \"Achew! achew!\" and chewing died.\r\n\r\nThere are many parodies of popular poems written in praise of the\r\nweed; of which the following in imitation of Tennyson's \"Charge of the\r\nLight Brigade,\" entitled \"The Charge of the Tobacco Jar Brigade,\" is\r\none of the best.\r\n\r\n  \"Epigrams, epigrams,\r\n  Pour'd in, and numbered--\r\n  Good, bad, indifferent--\r\n  More than Six Hundred.\r\n  \"Epigrams potters want,\"\r\n  Quoth The Tobacco Plant:\r\n  Write! you for fame who pant;\r\n  Write! we'll three prizes grant.\"\r\n  Wrote for Tobacco-Jars,\r\n  Over Six Hundred.\r\n\r\n  Postmen, ere morning's light;\r\n  Postmen, whilst day was bright;\r\n  Postmen, as closed in night,\r\n  Ran--tan'd and thunder'd\r\n  Loud at our office door;\r\n  Brought letters, many score--\r\n  Contents of bags--to pour\r\n  Table and desk all o'er:\r\n  Handfuls and armfuls bore,\r\n  Casting them on the floor.\r\n  Then through the town they tore,\r\n  Hastening back for more--\r\n  More than Six Hundred.\r\n\r\n  Letters to right of us,\r\n  Letters to left of us,\r\n  Letters in front of us,\r\n  Seeming unnumbered!\r\n  Envelopes every size\r\n  Met our astonish'd eyes.\r\n  Writer with writer vies!\r\n  Which wins the chiefest prize\r\n  Out of Six Hundred.\r\n\r\n  How did each writer strain\r\n  After a happy vein!\r\n  Pegasus, spurning rein,\r\n  Shied, jibb'd, and blunder'd.\r\n  Reverend writers, then\r\n  Took up the winged pen;\r\n  Suff'rers on beds of pain\r\n  Sought the bright muse again;\r\n  Lawyer and barrister\r\n  Courted and harassed her;\r\n  M.

And while it has had many a royal hater, it\r\ncan also boast of having many a kingly user. A favorite of king and\r\ncourtier, its use was alike common in the palace and the courtyard. It\r\ncan claim, also, many celebrated physicians who have been its patrons,\r\nand among them the noted Dr. Parr. We give an anecdote of him showing\r\nhis love of weed and wit.\r\n\r\nThe partiality this worthy Grecian always manifested for smoking is\r\nwell known. Whenever he dined he was always indulged with a pipe. Even\r\nHis Majesty, when Dr. Parr was his guest at Carlton Palace,\r\ncondescended to give him a smoking-room and the company of Colonel\r\nC----, in order that he might suffer no inconvenience. \"I don't like\r\nto be smoked myself, doctor,\" said the royal wit, \"but I am anxious\r\nthat your pipe should not be put out.\" One day, Dr. Parr was to dine\r\nat the house of Mr. ----, who informed his lady of the circumstance,\r\nand of the doctor's passion for the pipe. The lady was much mortified\r\nby this intimation, and with warmth said, \"I tell you what, Mr. ----,\r\nI don't care a fig for Dr. P.'s Greek; he shan't smoke here.\" \"My\r\ndear,\" replied the husband, \"he must smoke; he is allowed to do so\r\neverywhere.\" \"Excuse me, Mr. ----, he shall not smoke here; leave it\r\nto me, my dear, I'll manage it.\" The doctor came; a splendid dinner\r\nensued; the Grecian was very brilliant. After dinner, the doctor\r\ncalled for his pipes. \"Pipes!\" screamed the lady. \"Pipes! For what\r\npurpose?\" \"Why, to smoke, madam!\" \"Oh! my dear doctor, I can't have\r\npipes here. You'll spoil my room; my curtains will smell of tobacco\r\nfor a week.\" \"Not smoke!\" exclaimed the astonished and offended\r\nGrecian. \"Why, madam, I have smoked in better houses.\" \"Perhaps so,\r\nsir,\" replied the lady, with dignity; and she added with firmness, \"I\r\nshall be most happy, doctor, to show you the rights (rites?) of\r\nhospitality; but you cannot be allowed to smoke.\" \"Then, madam,\" said\r\nDr. Parr, looking at her ample person; \"then, madam,--I must say,\r\nmadam,--\" \"Sir, sir, are you going to be rude?\" \"I must say, madam,\"\r\nhe continued, \"you are the greatest tobacco-stopper in all England.\"\r\nOf the clergy, Whatley was one of the greatest in intellect, and, as a\r\nsmoker was devotedly attached to tobacco; his pipes, when out, served\r\nhim for a book-marker. In summer-time he might be seen, of an evening,\r\nsitting on the chains of Stephen's Green, thinking of \"that,\" as the\r\nsong says, and of much more, while he was \"smoking tobacco.\" In winter\r\nhe walked and smoked, vigorously in both cases, on the Donnybrook\r\nroad; or he would be out with his dogs, climbing up the trees to hide\r\namid the branches a key or a knife, which, after walking some\r\ndistance, he would tell the dogs he had lost, and bid them look for it\r\nand bring it to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Theory against experience.]\r\n\r\nOf many warriors, none have been more devoted to the plant than\r\nNapoleon, Frederick of Prussia and Blücher the Bold. The following\r\nanecdote of the latter is one of the best of its kind: \"As is\r\nwell-known, Field-Marshal Blücher, in addition to his brave young\r\n'fellows' (as he called his horsemen), loved three things above all,\r\nnamely, wine, gambling, and a pipe of Tobacco. With his pipe he would\r\nnot dispense, and he always took two or three puffs, at least, before\r\nundertaking anything. 'Without Tobacco, I am not worth a farthing,' he\r\noften said. Though so passionately fond of Tobacco, yet old 'Forwards'\r\nwas no friend of costly smoking apparatus; and he liked best to smoke\r\nlong, Dutch clay pipes, which, as everybody knows, very readily break.\r\nTherefore, from among his 'young fellows' he had chosen for himself a\r\nPipe-master, who had charge of a chest well packed with clay pipes;\r\nand this chest was the most precious jewel in Blücher's field baggage.\r\nIf one of the pipes broke, it was, for our hero, an event of the\r\ngreatest importance. On its occurrence, the 'wounded' pipe was\r\nnarrowly examined, and if the stem was not broken off too near the\r\nhead, it was sent to join the corps of Invalids, and was called\r\n'Stummel' (Stump, or Stumpy). One of these Stumpies the\r\nField-Marshal usually smoked when he was on horseback, and when the\r\ntroops were marching along or engaged in a reconnoissance, and\r\neye-witnesses record that many a Stumpy was shot from his mouth by the\r\nballs of the enemy--nothing but a piece of the stem then remaining\r\nbetween his lips. Blücher's Pipe-master, at the time of the Liberation\r\nWar, was Christian Hennemann, a Mecklenburg and Rostock man, like\r\nBlücher himself, and most devotedly attached to the Field-Marshal. He\r\nknew all the characteristic peculiarities of the old hero, even the\r\nsmallest, and no one could so skillfully adapt himself to them as he.\r\nHis duties as Pipe-master, Hennemann discharged with great fidelity;\r\nyea, even with genuine fanatical zeal. The contents of the pipe-chest\r\nhe thoroughly knew, for often he counted the pipes. Before every\r\nfierce fight, Prince Blücher usually ordered a long pipe to be filled.\r\nAfter smoking for a short time, he gave back the lighted pipe to\r\nHennemann, placed himself right in the saddle, drew his sabre, and\r\nwith the vigorous cry, 'Forward, my lads!' he threw himself into the\r\nfierce onset on the foe.\r\n\r\nOn the ever-memorable morning of the battle of Belle-Alliance\r\n(Waterloo), Hennemann had just handed a pipe to his master, when a\r\ncannon-ball struck the ground near, so that earth and sand covered\r\nBlücher and his gray horse. The horse made a spring to one side, and\r\nthe beautiful new pipe was broken before the old hero had taken a\r\nsingle puff. 'Fill another pipe for me,' said Blücher; 'keep it\r\nlighted, and wait for me here a moment, till I drive away the French\r\nrascals. Forwards, lads!' Thereupon there was a rush forwards; but the\r\nchase lasted not only 'a moment,' but a whole hot day. At the\r\nBelle-Alliance Inn, which was demolished by shot,--the battle having\r\nat last been gained,--the victorious friends, Blücher and Wellington,\r\nmet and congratulated each other on the grand and nobly achieved work,\r\neach praising the bravery of the other's troops. 'Your fellows slash\r\nin like the very devil himself!' cried Wellington. Blücher replied,\r\n'Yes; you see, that is their business. But brave as they are, I know\r\nnot whether one of them would stand as firmly and calmly in the midst\r\nof the shower of balls and bullets as your English.' Then Wellington\r\nasked Blücher about his previous position on the field of battle,\r\nwhich had enabled him to execute an attack so fatal to the enemy.\r\n\r\nBlücher, who could strike tremendous blows, but was by no means a\r\nconsummate orator, and could not paint his deeds in words, conducted\r\nWellington to the place itself. They found it completely deserted; but\r\non the very spot where Blücher had that morning halted, and from which\r\nhe had galloped away, stood a man with his head bound up, and with his\r\narm wrapped in a handkerchief. He smoked a long, dazzling white clay\r\npipe. 'Good God!' exclaimed Blücher, 'that is my servant, Christian\r\nHennemann. What a strange look you have, man! What are you doing\r\nhere?' 'Have you come at last?' answered Christian Hennemann, in a\r\ngrumbling tone; 'here I have stood the whole day, waiting for you. One\r\npipe after another have the cursed French shot away from my mouth.\r\nOnce even a blue bean (a bullet) made sad work with my head, and my\r\nfist has got a deuce of a smashing. That is the last whole pipe, and\r\nit is a good thing that the firing has ceased; otherwise, the French\r\nwould have knocked this pipe to pieces, and you must have stood there\r\nwith a dry mouth.' He then handed the lighted pipe to his master, who\r\ntook it, and after a few eagerly-enjoyed whiffs, said to his faithful\r\nservant, 'It is true, I have kept you waiting a long time; but to-day\r\nthe French fellows could not be forced to run all at once.' With\r\nastonishment, Wellington listened to the conversation. Amazed, he\r\nlooked now at the Field-Marshal, now at the 'Pipe-master,' and now at\r\nthe branches of trees and the balls scattered all round, which made it\r\nonly too evident what a dangerous post this spot must have been during\r\nthe battle. The wound in Hennemann's head proved to be somewhat\r\nserious; his hand was completely shattered; and yet, in the midst of\r\nthe tempest of shot, he had stood there waiting for his beloved\r\nmaster.\"[55]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 55: During the conquest of Holland, Louvais\r\n              paid more attention to furnishing tobacco than\r\n              provisions; and even at this day, as well as in former\r\n              times, more care is taken to procure tobacco than bread\r\n              to the soldier. Every soldier was obliged to have his\r\n              pipe and his matches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The faithful attendant.]\r\n\r\nTobacco smoking, however, can boast of many patrons besides warriors,\r\nphysicians and statesmen, some of the finest writers of the last three\r\ncenturies have indulged in the weed. The following extract from the\r\n\"Australasian\" entitled, \"Tobacco Smoking\" refers to many literary\r\nsmokers.\r\n\r\n     \"Burke felt himself precluded from 'drawing an indictment\r\n     against a whole community.' The critical moralist pauses\r\n     before the formidable array of the entire social world,\r\n     civilized and savage. The Cockney, leaving behind him the\r\n     regalias and meerschaums of the Strand, finds the wax-tipped\r\n     clay-pipe in the parlors of Yorkshire: finds dhudeen and\r\n     cutty in the wilds of Galway and on the rugged shores of\r\n     Skye and Mull. The Frenchman he finds enveloped in clouds of\r\n     Virginia, and the Swede, Dane, and Norwegian, of every grade\r\n     or class, makes the pipe his travelling companion and his\r\n     domestic solace. The Magyar, the Pole and the Russian rival\r\n     the Englishman in gusto, perhaps excel him in refinement;\r\n     the Dutch boor smokes finer Tobacco than many English\r\n     gentlemen can command, and more of it than many of our\r\n     hardened votaries could endure; but all must yield, or\r\n     rather, all must accumulate, ere our conceptions can\r\n     approach to the German. America and the British colonies\r\n     round off the picture, adding Cherokees, Redmen and\r\n     Mongolians _ad libitum_. The Jew whether in Hounds ditch,\r\n     Paris Hamburgh, or Constantinople, ever inhales the choicest\r\n     growths, and the Mussulman's 'keyf' is proverbial. India and\r\n     Persia dispute with us the palm of refinement and intensity,\r\n     but the philosopher of Australia is embarrassed when he asks\r\n     himself to whom shall I award that of zealous devotion?\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. Adam Clarke, who could never reconcile himself to the\r\n     practice, deemed it due to his piety to find a useful\r\n     purpose in the creation of tobacco by all-seeing Wisdom, and\r\n     as that discovered by the instincts of all the nations of\r\n     the planet, and practiced by mankind for three centuries, is\r\n     wrong, the benevolent Wesleyan of Heydon, applied himself\r\n     diligently and generously to correct the world, and to\r\n     vindicate its Author. 'In some rare cases of internal injury\r\n     tobacco may be used but not in the customary way.' Be it\r\n     known, then, that the Creator has not created it in vain.\r\n     Dr. Clarke must have been a very good-natured man. He\r\n     tortured his brains to find a hope of pardon for Judas\r\n     Iscariot, and held that the creature (Nachash) who tempted\r\n     Eve was not a serpent but a monkey cursed by the forfeiture\r\n     of _patella_ and _podex_; therefore doomed to crawl! But I\r\n     fear, if the present form of using tobacco be not the true\r\n     one, we must despair of ever finding it, and people will go\r\n     on smoking and 'hearing reason' as long as the world goes\r\n     round. Robert Hall received a pamphlet denouncing the pipe.\r\n     He read it, and returned it. 'I cannot, sir, confute your\r\n     arguments, and I cannot give up smoking,' was his comment.\r\n     It is loosely asserted that smoking is more prevalent among\r\n     scholars, intellectualists, and men who live by their\r\n     brains, than among artisans and subduers of the soil. This\r\n     is an error. Tobacco is less a fosterer of thought than a\r\n     solace of mental vacuity. The thinker smokes in the\r\n     intervals of work, impatient of _ennui_ as well as of\r\n     lassitude, and the ploughman, the digger, the blacksmith or\r\n     the teamster, lights his cutty for the same reason. No true\r\n     worker, be he digger, or divine, blends real work with\r\n     either smoking or drinking. Whenever you see a fellow drink\r\n     or smoke during work, spot him for a gone coon; he will come\r\n     to grief, and that right soon. Sleep stimulates thought, and\r\n     sometimes a pipe will bring sleep, but trust it not of\r\n     itself for either thought or strength. It combats _ennui_,\r\n     lassitude, and intolerable vacuity, soothing the nerves and\r\n     diverting attention from self. Sam Johnson came very near\r\n     the mark: 'I wonder why a thing that costs so little\r\n     trouble, yet has just sufficient semblance of doing\r\n     something to break utter idleness, should go out of fashion.\r\n     To be sure, it is a horrible thing blowing smoke out; but\r\n     every man needs something to quiet him--as, beating with his\r\n     feet.'\r\n\r\n     \"Life is really too short for moralists and medici who have\r\n     read Don Quixote, to attack a verdict arrived at and acted\r\n     upon by the combined nations of the entire world, during the\r\n     experience of three centuries, and apparently deepened by\r\n     their advancing civilization. Give us rules and\r\n     modifications, give us guides and correctives, give us\r\n     warnings against excess, precipitancy, and neglect of other\r\n     enjoyments, or of important duties, if you will. The urbane\r\n     æstheticism that regulates pleasure also limits it; and true\r\n     refinement ever modifies the indulgence it pervades. But it\r\n     is emulating Mrs. Partington and her mop to attempt to\r\n     preach down a world. When they do agree, their unanimity is\r\n     irresistible. Prohibition may give zest to enjoyment, and\r\n     provocation to curiosity, but can never overcome the\r\n     instincts of nature or cravings of nervous irritability, and\r\n     he who rises in rebellion against her absolute decree will\r\n     respect the limits and study the laws of a recognized and\r\n     regulated enjoyment.\r\n\r\n     \"Let, then, the moralist point out what social duties may be\r\n     imperilled; let the physician apprise us of the disorders to\r\n     be guarded against; and let the lover of elegance see that\r\n     no neglect or slight awaits her. Of abstract arguments we\r\n     have seen the futility, of moral and medical crusades even\r\n     the most patient are weary, and we gladly turn to something\r\n     real, in the suffrages of a by-gone great man of\r\n     acknowledged fame--Ben Jonson. Ben Jonson loved the 'durne\r\n     weed,' and describes its every accident with the gusto of a\r\n     connoisseur. Hobbes smoked, after his early dinner, pipes\r\n     innumerable. Milton never went to bed without a pipe and a\r\n     glass of water, which I cannot help associating with his:\r\n\r\n                                       'Adam waked,\r\n       So custom'd, for his sleep was æry light, of pure digestion bred\r\n       And temperate vapors bland!'\r\n\r\n     \"Sir Isaac Newton was smoking in his garden at Woolsthorpe\r\n     when the apple fell. Addison had a pipe in his mouth at all\r\n     hours, at 'Buttons.' Fielding both smoked and chewed. About\r\n     1740 it became unfashionable, and was banished from St.\r\n     James' to the country squires and parsons. Squire Western,\r\n     in _Tom Jones_, arriving in town, sends off Parson Supple to\r\n     Basingstoke, where he had left his Tobacco-box! The\r\n     snuff-box was substituted. Lord Mark Kerr, a brave officer\r\n     who affected the _petit maitre_ (_à la_ Pelham, in Lord\r\n     Lytton's second novel), invented the invisible hinges, and\r\n     it was this 'going out of fashion' that Jonson alluded to in\r\n     1774.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Newton and his pipe.]\r\n\r\n     \"We next find Tobacco rearing its head under the auspices of\r\n     Paley and Parr. Paley had one of the most orderly minds ever\r\n     given to man. A vein of shrewd and humorous sarcasm,\r\n     together with an under-current of quiet selfishness, made\r\n     him a very pleasant companion. 'I cannot afford to keep a\r\n     conscience any more than a carriage,' was worthy of Erasmus,\r\n     perhaps of Robelais. 'Our delight was,' said an old\r\n     Jonsonian to the writer, 'to get old Paley, on a cold\r\n     winter's night, to put up his legs, wrap them well up, stir\r\n     the fire, and fill him a long Dutch pipe; he would talk\r\n     away, sir, like a being of a higher sphere. He declined\r\n     any punch, but drank it up as fast as we replenished his\r\n     glass. He would smoke any given quantity of Tobacco, and\r\n     drink any _given_ quantity of punch.'\r\n\r\n     \"Parr smoked ostentatiously and vainly, as he did\r\n     everything. He used only the finest Tobacco, half-filling\r\n     his pipe with salt. He wrote and read, and smoked and wrote,\r\n     rising early, and talking fustian. He was a sort of\r\n     miniature Brummagem Johnson. Except his preface to\r\n     _Bellendenus_, you might burn all he has written. His 'Life\r\n     of Fox' is beneath contempt. His letters are simply\r\n     laughable, especially his characters of contemporaries. He,\r\n     however, was an amiable and good-natured man, and had\r\n     sufficient humanity to regard dissent as an impediment to\r\n     his recognition of intellectual or moral worth. Parr was an\r\n     arrogant old coxcomb, who abused the respectful kindness he\r\n     received, and took his pipe into drawing-rooms. I pass over\r\n     the Duke of Bridgewater, because he was early crossed in\r\n     love by a most beautiful girl, could not bear the sight of a\r\n     flower even growing, and passed life in a pot-house with a\r\n     pipe, listening to Brindley, whose intellect and dialect\r\n     must have been alike incomprehensible to him.\r\n\r\n     \"The cigar appeared about 1812; it received the countenance\r\n     of the Regent, who had hitherto confined himself to macobau\r\n     snuff, scented with lavender and the tonquin bean. Porson\r\n     smoked many bundles of cheroots, which nabobs began to\r\n     import. After 1815 the continental visits were resumed, and\r\n     the practice of smoking began steadily to increase. The\r\n     German china bowl with globular receiver of the essential\r\n     oil, the absorbent meerschaum, the red Turkish bell-shaped\r\n     clay, the elaborate hookah,--a really elegant ornament, and\r\n     perhaps the most healthful and rational form of\r\n     smoking,--pipes of all shapes, began to fill the shops of\r\n     London. Coleridge, when cured of opium, took to snuff. Byron\r\n     wrote dashingly about 'sublime Tobacco,' but I do not think\r\n     he carried the practice to excess. Shelley never smoked, nor\r\n     Wordsworth, nor Keats. Campbell loved a pipe. John Gibson\r\n     Lockhart was seldom without a cigar. Sir Walter Scott smoked\r\n     in his carriage, and regularly after dinner, loving both\r\n     pipes and cigars. Professor Wilson smoked steadily, as did\r\n     Charles Lamb. Carlyle, now somewhat past seventy, has been a\r\n     sturdy smoker for years. Goethe did not smoke, neither did\r\n     Shakespeare. I cannot recall a single allusion to Tobacco in\r\n     all his plays; even Sir Toby Belch does not add the pipe to\r\n     his burnt sack. But Shakespeare hated every form of\r\n     debauchery. The penitence of Cassio is more prominent than\r\n     was his fun. 'What! drunk? and talk fustian and speak\r\n     parrot, and discourse with one's shadow?' Shakespeare held\r\n     drunkenness in disgust. Even Falstaff is more an\r\n     intellectual man than a sot. What actor could play Falstaff\r\n     after riding forty miles and being well thrashed? Yet, when\r\n     Falstaff sustains the evening at the Boar's Head, he has\r\n     ridden to Gadshill and back, forty-four miles! No palsied\r\n     sot, he. Hamlet's disgust at his countrymen is well known.\r\n     'Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!' is the\r\n     comment on the drunken Kit Sly. In short, when you look at\r\n     the smooth, happy, half-feminine face of Shakespeare, you\r\n     see one to whom all forms of debauchery were ungenial. A\r\n     courtier certainly, and a lover of money. The king had\r\n     written against Tobacco, and Will Shakespeare set his watch\r\n     to the time. Raleigh and Coliban Jonson might smoke at the\r\n     Mermaid--Will kept his head clear and his doublet sweet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tennyson, smoking.]\r\n\r\n     \"Alfred Tennyson is a persistent smoker of some forty years.\r\n     Dickens, Jerrold and Thackeray all puffed. Lord Lytton loves\r\n     a long pipe at night and cigars by day. Lord Houghton smokes\r\n     moderately. The late J. M. Kemble, author of 'The Seasons in\r\n     England,' was a tremendous smoker. Moore cared not for it;\r\n     indeed, I think that Irish gentlemen smoke much less than\r\n     English. Wellington shunned it; so did Peel. D'Israeli loved\r\n     the long pipe in his youth, but in middle age pronounced it\r\n     'the tomb of love.' While I am writing, it is not too much\r\n     to aver that 99 persons out of 100, taken at random, under\r\n     forty years of age, smoke habitually every day of their\r\n     lives. How many in Melbourne injure wealth and brain, I\r\n     leave to more skilled and morose critics. But my mind\r\n     misgives me. Paralysis is becoming very frequent.\r\n\r\n     \"I have seen stone pipes from Gambia, shaped like the letter\r\n     U consisting each of one solid flint, hollowed through,\r\n     also hookahs made by sailors with cocoanut shells. All,\r\n     however, now agree that it is impossible to have either\r\n     comfortable, cool, or safe smoking, unless through a\r\n     substance like clay, porous and absorbent, especially as\r\n     portable pipes are the mode. Those of black charcoal are not\r\n     handsome; indeed, I always feel like a mute at a funeral\r\n     while smoking one, but they are delightfully cool, absorbing\r\n     more essential oil of nicotine, and more quickly than any\r\n     meerschaum. I caution the smoker to have an old glove on; as\r\n     these pipes 'sweat,' the oil comes through, and nothing is\r\n     more pertinacious than oil of tobacco when it sinks into\r\n     your pores, or floats about hair or clothes. My own taste\r\n     inclines to the German receiver, long cherry tube and amber,\r\n     and to my own garden, for all street smoking is unæsthetic,\r\n     and the traveller by coach, boat, or rail has the tastes of\r\n     others to consult. Surely it is not urbane to throw on\r\n     another the burden of saying that he likes not the smell or\r\n     the inhaling of burning tobacco. Better postpone your solace\r\n     to more fitting time and place--the close of day and your\r\n     own veranda. Indoor smoking is detestable. Life has few\r\n     direr disenchanters than the morning smells of obsolete\r\n     tobacco, relics though they be of hesternal beatitude. Give\r\n     me, in robe or jacket, a hookah, or German arrangement,\r\n     Chinese recumbency in matted and moistened veranda, and the\r\n     odors of fresh growing beds of flowers wafted by the\r\n     southern breeze. Nor be wanting the fragrant perfume of\r\n     coffee. 'Meat without salt,' says Hafiz, 'is even as tobacco\r\n     without coffee.' The tannin of the coffee corrects the\r\n     nicotine. And it may not be amiss to learn that a plate of\r\n     watercress, salt, and a large glass of cold water should be\r\n     at hand to the smoker by day; the watercress corrects any\r\n     excess, and is at hand in a garden. Smoke not before\r\n     breakfast, nor till an hour has elapsed after a good meal.\r\n     Smoke not with or before wine, you destroy the wine-palate.\r\n     If you love tea, postpone pipe till after it; no man can\r\n     enjoy fine tea who has smoked. In short, smoke not till the\r\n     day is done, with all its tasks and duties.\r\n\r\n     \"I have seen men of pretension and position treat carpets\r\n     most contumeliously, trampling on the pride of Plato with a\r\n     recklessness that would bring a blush to the cheek of\r\n     Diogenes himself. Can they forget the absorbent powers of\r\n     carpet tissues, and the horrors of next morning to\r\n     non-smokers, perhaps to ladies? Surely this is unæsthetic\r\n     and illiberal: it is in an old man most pitiable, in a young\r\n     one intolerable, in a scholar inexcusable, from an\r\n     uncleanness that seems willful. Let the young philosopher\r\n     avoid such practice, and give a wide berth to those who\r\n     follow them. Take the following rules, tyro, _meo\r\n     periculo_:--\r\n\r\n     1. Never smoke when the pores are open: they absorb, and you\r\n     are unfit for decent society. Be it your study ever to\r\n     escape the noses of strangers. First impressions are\r\n     sometimes permanent, and you may lose a useful acquaintance.\r\n\r\n     2. Learn to smoke slowly. Cultivate 'calm and intermittent\r\n     puffs.'--_Walter Scott._\r\n\r\n     3. On the first symptom of expectoration lay down the pipe,\r\n     or throw away the cigar; long-continued expectoration is\r\n     destructive to yourself and revolting to every spectator.\r\n\r\n     4. Let an interval elapse between the filling of succeeding\r\n     pipes.\r\n\r\n     5. Clean your tube regularly, and your amber mouthpiece with\r\n     a feather dipped in spirits of lavender. Never suffer the\r\n     conduit to remain discolored or stuffed.\r\n\r\n     6. A German receiver can be washed out like a teacup, and\r\n     the oil collected is of value, but a meerschaum should never\r\n     be wetted. A small sponge at the end of a wire dipped in\r\n     sweet oil should be used carefully and persistently round\r\n     and round, coaxing out any hard concretions, till the inside\r\n     be smooth in its dark polished grain, of a rich mahogany\r\n     tint. The outside, also, well polished with sweet oil and\r\n     stale milk, then enveloped in chamois leather. The rich dark\r\n     coloring is the pledge of your safety--better there than\r\n     darkening your own brains.\r\n\r\n     \"The pale gold c'noster and Turkey have now given way to the\r\n     splendid varieties of America, and my knowledge halts behind\r\n     the age. The black sticks resembling lollipops are said to\r\n     be compounds of rum, bullocks' blood and tobacco lees. A\r\n     taste for them, when once contracted, is abiding. Fine\r\n     volatile tobacco, with aromatic delicacy, requires a long\r\n     tube; used in a short pipe of modern fashion, they parch and\r\n     shrivel the tongue. In short, what is true of all other\r\n     pleasures is also true of tobacco-smoking. Fruition is\r\n     sometimes too rapid for enjoyment, as the dram-drinker is\r\n     less wise than the calm imbiber of the fragrant vintage of\r\n     the Garonne. With Burke's common sense I began, and with it\r\n     I end. Depurate vice of all her offensiveness, and you prune\r\n     her of half her evil. Let not your love of indulgence be so\r\n     inordinate as to purchase short pleasure by impairing\r\n     health, neglecting duty, or, while promoting your own\r\n     self-complacency, allow yourself to become permanently\r\n     revolting to society, by offending more senses as well as\r\n     more principles than one.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern smokers.]\r\n\r\nMantegazza, one of the most brilliant of all writers on tobacco, in\r\nalluding to the enchantment of the \"weed,\" says:--\r\n\r\n     \"If a winged inhabitant of some remote world felt the\r\n     impulse to traverse space, and, with an astronomical map, to\r\n     fly round our planetary system, he would at once recognize\r\n     the earth by the odor of tobacco which it exhales, forasmuch\r\n     as all known nations smoke the nicotian herb. And thousands\r\n     and thousands of men, if compelled to limit themselves to a\r\n     single nervous aliment, would relinquish wine and coffee,\r\n     opium and brandy, and cling fondly to the precious narcotic\r\n     leaf. Before Columbus, tobacco was not smoked except in\r\n     America; and now, after a lapse of a few centuries in the\r\n     furthest part of China and in Japan, in the island of\r\n     Oceanica as in Lapland and Siberia, rises from the hut of\r\n     the savage and from the palace of the prince, along with the\r\n     smoke of the fireplace, where man bakes his bread and warms\r\n     his heart, another odorous smoke, which man inhales and\r\n     breathes forth again to soothe his pain and to vanquish\r\n     fatigue and anxiety.\r\n\r\n     \"In the early times of the introduction of tobacco, smokers\r\n     in many countries were condemned to infamous and cruel\r\n     punishments; had their noses and their lips cut off, and\r\n     with blackened faces and mounted on an ass, exposed to the\r\n     coarse jests of the vilest vagabonds and the insults of the\r\n     multitude. But now the hangman smokes, and the criminal\r\n     condemned to death smokes before being hanged. The king in\r\n     his gilt coach smokes; and the assassin smokes who lies in\r\n     wait to throw down before the feet of the horses the\r\n     murderous bomb. The human family spends every year two\r\n     thousand six hundred and seventy millions of francs (about a\r\n     hundred millions in English money) on tobacco, which is not\r\n     food, which is not drink, and without which it contrived to\r\n     live for a long succession of ages.\r\n\r\n     \"In the discomfitures and disasters which befell the Army of\r\n     Lavalle, in the civil wars of the Argentine Republic, the\r\n     poor fugitives had to suffer the most horrible privations,\r\n     which can be imagined. By degrees the tobacco came to an\r\n     end, and the Argentines smoked dry leaves. One man, more\r\n     fortunate than his comrades, continued to use with much\r\n     economy the most precious of all his stores--tobacco. A\r\n     fellow soldier begged to be allowed to put the economist's\r\n     pipe in his own mouth, and thus to inhale at second-hand the\r\n     adored smoke, paying two dollars for the privilege. What is\r\n     more striking still, when, in 1843, the convicts in the\r\n     prison of Epinal, France, who had for some time been\r\n     deprived of tobacco, rose in revolt, their cry was 'tobacco\r\n     or death!' When Col. Seybourg was marching in the interior\r\n     of Surinam against negro rebels, and the soldiers had to\r\n     bear the most awful hardships, they smoked paper, they\r\n     chewed leaves and leather, and found the lack of tobacco the\r\n     greatest of all their trials and torments.\"\r\n\r\nElsewhere, inquiring what nervous aliments harmonize the one with the\r\nother, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The only, the true, the legitimate companion of coffee is\r\n     the nicotian plant; and wisely and well the Turkish epicures\r\n     declare that for coffee--the drink of Heaven--tobacco is the\r\n     salt. The smoke of a puro, of a manilla, or of real Turkish\r\n     tobacco, which passes amorously through the voluptuous tip\r\n     of amber, blends magnificently with the austere aroma of the\r\n     coffee, and the inebriated palate is agitated between a\r\n     caress and a rebuke.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a Southern paper we extract these whimsical lines.\r\n                                                        \"On the Great\r\n     Fall in the Price of Tobacco in 1801,\" by Hugh Montgomery,\r\n     Lynchburgh, Va.,\r\n\r\n          \"Lately a planter chanced to pop\r\n           His head into a barber's shop--\r\n           Begged to be shaved; it soon was done,\r\n           When Strap (inclined oft-times to fun,)\r\n           Doubling the price he'd asked before,\r\n           Instead of two pence made it four.\r\n           The planter said, 'You sure must grant,\r\n           Your charge is most exhorbitant.'\r\n          'Not so,' quoth Strap, 'I'm right and you are wrong,\r\n           For since tobacco fell, your face is twice as long.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother quaint whim in the form of an advertisement for a lost\r\nmeerschaum is from an Australian paper:\r\n\r\n     \"To Honest men and others,--Driving from Hale Town to\r\n     Bridgetown, on Sunday, last, the advertiser lost a cigar\r\n     holder with the face of a pretty girl on it. The intrinsic\r\n     value of the missing article is small, but as the owner has\r\n     been for the last few months converting the young lady from\r\n     a blonde into a brunette, he would be glad to get it back\r\n     again. If it was picked up by a gentleman, on reading this\r\n     notice, he will, of course, send it to the address below. If\r\n     it was picked up by a poor man, who could get a few\r\n     shillings by selling it, on his bringing it to the address\r\n     below, he shall be paid the full amount of its intrinsic\r\n     value. If it was picked up by a thief, let him deliver it,\r\n     and he shall be paid a like amount, and thus for once can do\r\n     an honest action, without being a penny the worse for it.\"\r\n\r\nA humorous writer thus discourses on man, who he denominates as\r\n\"common clays\":\r\n                \"Yet we are all common clays! There are long clays and\r\n     short clays, coarse clays and refined clays, and the latter\r\n     are pretty scarce, that's a fact. To follow out the simile,\r\n     life is the tobacco with which we are loaded, and when the\r\n     vital spark is applied we live; when that tobacco is\r\n     exhausted we die, the essence of our life ascending from the\r\n     lukewarm clay when the last fibre burns out, as a curl of\r\n     smoke from the ashes in the bowl of the pipe, and mingling\r\n     with the perfumed breeze of heaven, or the hot breath\r\n     of--well, never mind; we hope not. Then the clay is cold,\r\n     and glows no more from the fire within; the pipe is broken,\r\n     and ceases to comfort and console. We say, 'A friend has\r\n     left us,' or 'Poor old Joe; his pipe is out.' We have all a\r\n     certain supply of life, or, if we would pursue the\r\n     comparison, a share of tobacco. Some young men smoke too\r\n     rapidly, even voraciously, and thus exhaust their share\r\n     before their proper time,--then we say they have 'lived too\r\n     fast,' or 'pulled at their pipes too hard.' Others, on the\r\n     contrary, make their limited supply go a long way, and when\r\n     they are taking their last puffs of life's perfumed plant\r\n     their energy is unimpaired; they can run a race, walk a mile\r\n     with any one, and show few wrinkles upon their brow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The artist.]\r\n\r\n     \"A delicate person is like a pipe with a crack in the bowl,\r\n     for it takes continued and careful pulling to keep his light\r\n     in; and to take life is like willfully dashing a lighted\r\n     pipe from the mouth into fragments, and scattering the\r\n     sparks to the four winds of heaven. An artist is a good\r\n     coloring pipe; an attractive orator is a pipe that draws\r\n     well; a communist is a foul pipe; a well-educated woman\r\n     whose conversation is attractive is a pipe with a nice\r\n     mouthpiece; a girl of the period is a fancy pipe, the\r\n     ornament of which is liable to chip; a female orator on\r\n     woman's rights is invariably a plain pipe; an old toper is a\r\n     well-seasoned pipe; an escaped thief is a cutty pipe, and\r\n     the policeman in pursuit is a shilling pipe, for is he not a\r\n     Bob?\"\r\n\r\nFrom these ingenious \"conceits\" we turn to a few thoughts on the\r\npresent condition and history of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Yankee smoker.]\r\n\r\nThe calumet or pipe of peace, decorated with all the splendor of\r\nsavage taste, is smoked by the red man to ratify good feeling or\r\nconfirm some treaty of peace. The energetic Yankee bent upon the\r\naccomplishment of his ends, puffs vigorously at his cigar and with\r\nscarcely a passing notice, strides over obstacles that lie in his path\r\nof whatever nature they may be. The dancing Spaniard with his eternal\r\ncastanets whispers but a word to his dark-eyed senorita as he hands\r\nher another perfumed cigarette. The lounging Italian hissing intrigues\r\nunder the shadow of an ancient portico, smokes on as he stalks over\r\nthe proud place where the blood of Cæsar dyed the stones of the\r\nCapitol, or where the knife of Virginius flashed in the summer sun.\r\nThe Turk comes forth from the Mosque only to smoke. The priest of\r\nNicaragua with solemn mien strides up the aisle and lights the altar\r\ncandles with the fire struck from his cigar. The hardy Laplander\r\ninvites the stranger to his hut and offers him his pipe while he\r\ninquires, if he comes from the land of tobacco. The indigent Jakut\r\nexchanges his most valuable furs and skins for a few ounces of the\r\n\"Circassian weed.\" Its charms are recognized by the gondolier of\r\nVenice and the Muleteer of Spain. The Switzer lights his pipe amid\r\nAlpine heights. The tourist climbing Ætna, or Vesuvius' rugged side,\r\npuffs on though _they_ perchance have long since ceased to smoke.\r\nTobacco, soothed the hardships of Cromwell's soldiers and gave novelty\r\nto the court life of the daughters of Louis XIV, delighted the\r\ncourtiers of Queen Elizabeth and bidding defiance to the ire of her\r\nsuccessors, the Stuarts, has never ceased to hold sway over court and\r\ncamp, as well as over the masses of the people.\r\n\r\nIn nothing cultivated has there been so remarkable a development.\r\nOriginally limited to the natives of America, it attracted the\r\nattention of Europeans who by cultivation increased the size and\r\nquality of the plant. But not alone has the plant improved in form and\r\nquality, the rude implements once used by the Indians have given away\r\n(even among themselves) to those of improved form and modern style.\r\nThese facts are without a doubt among the most curious that commerce\r\npresents. That a plant primarily used only by savages, should succeed\r\nin spite of the greatest opposition in becoming one of the greatest\r\nluxuries of the civilized world, is a fact without parallel. It can\r\nalmost be said, so universally is it used, that its claims are\r\nrecognized by all. Though hated by kings and popes it was highly\r\nesteemed by their subjects. Their delight in the new found novelty was\r\nunbounded and doubtless they could sing in praise as Byron did in\r\nlater times of:\r\n\r\n  \"Sublime tobacco which from East to West\r\n  Cheers the tar's labor and the Turkman's rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSNUFF, SNUFF-BOXES AND SNUFF-TAKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe custom of snuff-taking is as old at least as the discovery of the\r\ntobacco plant. The first account we have of it is given by Roman Pane,\r\nthe friar who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage of discovery\r\n(1494), and who alludes to its use among the Indians by means of a\r\ncane half a cubit long. Ewbank says:\r\n\r\n     \"Much has been written on a revolution so unique in its\r\n     origin, unsurpassed in incidents and results, and\r\n     constituting one of the most singular episodes in human\r\n     history; but next to nothing is recorded of whence the\r\n     various processes of manufacture and uses were derived. Some\r\n     imagine the popular pabulum[56] for the nose of translantic\r\n     origin. No such thing! Columbus first beheld smokers in the\r\n     Antilles. Pizarro found chewers in Peru, but it was in the\r\n     country discovered by Cabral that the great sternutatory was\r\n     originally found. Brazilian Indians were the Fathers of\r\n     snuff, and its best fabricators. Though counted among the\r\n     least refined of aborigines, their taste in this matter was\r\n     as pure as that of the fashionable world of the East. Their\r\n     snuff has never been surpassed, nor their apparatus for\r\n     making it.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 56: Dr. John Hill in his tract \"Cautions\r\n              against the immoderate use of snuff\" gives the following\r\n              definition of it. \"The dried leaves of tobacco, rasped,\r\n              beaten, or otherwise reduced to powder, make what we\r\n              call snuff.\" This tract was published in 1761. The\r\n              author, afterwards Sir John Hill, was equally celebrated\r\n              as a physician and a writer of farces, as denoted by the\r\n              following epigram by Garrick:\r\n\r\n                \"For physic and farces his equal there scarce is;\r\n                 His farces are physic, his physic a farce is.\"]\r\n\r\nSoon after the introduction and cultivation of tobacco in Spain and\r\nPortugal its use in the form of snuff came in vogue and from these\r\nnotions it spread rapidly over Europe, particularly in France and\r\nItaly. It is said to have been used first in France[57] by the wife\r\nof Henry II., Catherine de Medici, and that it was first used at court\r\nduring the latter part of the Sixteenth Century. The Queen seemed to\r\ngive it a good standing in society and it soon became the fashion to\r\nuse the powder by placing a little on the back of the hand and\r\ninhaling it. The use of snuff greatly increased from the fact of its\r\nsupposed medicinal properties and its curative powers in all diseases,\r\nparticularly those affecting the head, hence the wide introduction of\r\nsnuff-taking in Europe. Fairholt says of its early use:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 57: An English writer gives a different\r\n              account--\"The custom of taking snuff as a nasal\r\n              gratification does not appear to be of earlier date than\r\n              1620, though the powdered leaves of tobacco were\r\n              occasionally prescribed as a medicine long before that\r\n              time. It appears to have first become prevalent in\r\n              Spain, and from thence to have passed into Italy and\r\n              France.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"Though thus originally recommended for adoption as a\r\n     medicine, it soon became better known as a luxury and the\r\n     gratification of a pinch was generally indulged in Spain,\r\n     Italy and France, during the early part of the Seventeenth\r\n     Century. It was the grandees of the French Court who 'set\r\n     the fashion' of snuff, with all its luxurious additions of\r\n     scents and expensive boxes. It became common in the Court of\r\n     Louis le Grand, although that monarch had a decided\r\n     antipathy to tobacco in any form.\"\r\n\r\n     Says an English writer \"Between 1660 and 1700, the custom of\r\n     taking snuff, though it was disliked by Louis XIV., was\r\n     almost as prevalent in France as it is at the present time.\r\n     In this instance, the example of the monarch was\r\n     disregarded; _tobac en poudre_ or _tobac rape_[58] as snuff\r\n     was sometimes called found favor in the noses of the French\r\n     people; and all men of fashion prided themselves on carrying\r\n     a handsome snuff-box. Ladies also took snuff; and the belle\r\n     whose grace and propriety of demeanour were themes of\r\n     general admiration, thought it not unbecoming to take a\r\n     pinch at dinner, or to blow her pretty nose in her\r\n     embroidered _mouchoir_ with the sound of a trombone. Louis\r\n     endeavored to discourage the use of snuff and his\r\n     valets-de-chambre were obliged to renounce it when they were\r\n     appointed to their office. One of these gentlemen, the Duc\r\n     d'Harcourt, was supposed to have died of apoplexy in\r\n     consequence of having, in order to please the king, totally\r\n     discontinued the habit which he had before indulged to\r\n     excess.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 58: Grated tobacco.]\r\n\r\nOther grandees were less accommodating: thus we are told that\r\nMarechal d'Huxelles used to cover his cravat and dress with it. The\r\nRoyal Physician, Monsieur Fagon, is reported to have devoted his best\r\nenergies to a public oration of a very violent kind against snuff,\r\nwhich unfortunately failed to convince his auditory, as the excited\r\nlecturer in his most enthusiastic moments refreshed his nose with a\r\npinch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A tobacco grater.]\r\n\r\nAlthough disliked by the most polished prince of Europe, the use of\r\nsnuff increased and soon spread outside the limits of the court of\r\nFrance and in a short time became a favorite mode of using tobacco as\r\nit continues to be with many at this day.[59] The snuff-boxes of this\r\nperiod were very elegant and were decorated with elaborate paintings\r\nor set with gems. It was the custom to carry both a snuff-box and a\r\ntobacco grater, which was often as expensive and elegant as the\r\nsnuff-box itself. Many of them were richly carved and ornamented in\r\nthe most superb manner. Others bore the titles and arms of the owner\r\nand it was considered as part of a courtier's outfit to sport a\r\nmagnificent box and grater. The French mode of manufacturing snuff was\r\nto saturate the leaves in water, then dry them and color according to\r\nthe shade desired. The perfume was then added and the snuff was\r\nprepared for use. The kind of tobacco used was \"Tobac de Virginie.\"\r\nSpanish snuff was perfumed in the same manner with the additional use\r\nof orange-flower water. Carver gives the mode of manufacturing snuff\r\nin America (1779).\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 59: The Rev. S. Wesley speaking of the abuses\r\n              of tobacco, intimates that the human ear, will not long,\r\n              remain exempted from its affliction.\r\n\r\n                \"To such a height with some is fashion grown\r\n                 They feed they very nostrils with a spoon.\r\n                 One, and but one degree is wanting yet,\r\n                 To make their senseless luxury complete;\r\n                 Some choice regale, useless as snuff and dear,\r\n                 To feed the mazy windings of the ear.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"Being possessed of a tobacco wheel, which is a very simple\r\n     machine, they spin the leaves, after they are properly\r\n     cured, into a twist of any size they think fit; and having\r\n     folded it into rolls of about twenty pounds weight each,\r\n     they lay it by for use. In this state it will keep for\r\n     several years, and be continually improving, as it every\r\n     hour grows milder. When they have occasion to use it, they\r\n     take off such a length as they think necessary, which, if\r\n     designed for smoking, they cut into small pieces, for\r\n     chewing into larger, as choice directs; if they intend to\r\n     make snuff of it they take a quantity from the roll, and\r\n     laying it in a room where a fire is kept, in a day or two it\r\n     will become dry, and being rubbed on a grater will produce a\r\n     genuine snuff. Those in more improved regions who like their\r\n     snuff scented, apply to it such odoriferous waters as they\r\n     can procure, or think most pleasing.\"\r\n\r\nDutch snuff was only partially ground, and was therefore coarse and\r\nharsh in its effects when inhaled into the nostrils. The Irish,\r\naccording to Everards, used large quantities of snuff \"to purge their\r\nbrains.\" Snuff-taking became general in England[60] at the\r\ncommencement of the Seventeenth Century, and scented snuffs were used\r\nin preference to the plain. Frequent mention is made in the plays of\r\nthis time of its use and varieties. In Congreve's \"Love for Love,\" one\r\nof the characters presents a young lady with a box of snuff, on\r\nreceipt of which she says, \"Look you here what Mr. Tattle has given\r\nme! Look you here, cousin, here's a snuff-box; nay, there's snuff\r\nin't: here, will you have any? Oh, good! how sweet it is!\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 60: \"The custom of taking snuff was probably\r\n              brought into England by some of the followers of Charles\r\n              II., about the time of the Restoration. During his\r\n              reign, and that of his brother, it does not appear to\r\n              have gained much ground: but towards the end of the\r\n              Seventeenth Century it had become quite the \"rage\" with\r\n              beaux, who at that period, as well as in the reign of\r\n              Queen Anne, sometimes carried their snuff in the hollow\r\n              ivory heads of their canes.\"--_A Paper of Tobacco._]\r\n\r\nPortuguese snuff seemed to be in favor and was delicately perfumed. It\r\nwas made from the fibres of the leaves, and was considered among many\r\nto be the finest kind of the \"pungent dust.\" Some varieties of snuff\r\nwere named after the scents employed in flavoring them. In France many\r\nkinds became popular from the fact of their use at court, and by the\r\ncourtiers throughout the kingdom. Pope notes the use of the snuff-box\r\nby the fops and courtiers of his time in this manner:--\r\n\r\n  \"Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain,\r\n  And the nice conduct of a clouded cane;\r\n  With earnest eyes, and round, unthinking face,\r\n  He first the snuff-box open'd, then the case.\"\r\n\r\nThe mode of \"tapping the box\" before opening was characteristic of the\r\nbeaux and fops of this period, and is commented on in a poem on\r\nsnuff:--\r\n\r\n  \"The lawyer so grave, when he opens his case,\r\n     In obscurity finds it is hid,\r\n  Till the bright glass of knowledge illumines his face,\r\n     As he gives the three taps on the lid.\"\r\n\r\nSpain, Portugal, and France early in the Seventeenth Century became\r\nnoted as the producers of the finest kinds of snuff. In Spain and\r\nPortugal it was the favorite mode of using tobacco, and rare kinds\r\nwere compounded and sold at enormous prices. Its use in France by the\r\nfair sex is thus commented on by a French writer:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Demi-journées.]\r\n\r\n     \"Everything in France depends upon _la mode_; and it has\r\n     pleased _la mode_ to patronize this disgusting custom, and\r\n     carry about with them small boxes which they term\r\n     _demi-journées_.\"\r\n\r\nThe most expensive materials were employed in the manufacture of\r\nsnuff-boxes, such as agate, mosaics, and all kinds of rare wood, while\r\nmany were of gold, studded with diamonds. Some kinds were made of\r\nChina mounted in metal, and were very fanciful. In \"Pandora's Box,\" a\r\n\"Satyr against Snuff,\" 1719, may be found the following description of\r\nthe snuff-boxes then in vogue:\r\n\r\n  \"For females fair, and formal fops to please,\r\n  The mines are robb'd of ore, of shells the seas,\r\n  With all that mother-earth and beast afford\r\n  To man, unworthy now, tho' once their lord:\r\n  Which wrought into a box, with all the show\r\n  Of art the greatest artist can bestow;\r\n  Charming in shape, with polished rays of light,\r\n  A joint so fine it shuns the sharpest sight;\r\n  Must still be graced with all the radiant gems\r\n  And precious stones that e'er arrived in Thames.\r\n  Within the lid the painter plays his part,\r\n  And with his pencil proves his matchless art;\r\n  There drawn to life some spark or mistress dwells,\r\n  Like hermits chaste and constant to their cells.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the more highly perfumed snuffs sold for thirty shillings a\r\npound, while the cheaper kinds, such as English Rappee and John's\r\nLane, could be bought for two or three shillings per pound. There are\r\nat least two hundred kinds of snuff well known in commerce. The Scotch\r\nand Irish snuffs are for the most part made from the midribs; the\r\nStrasburgh, French, Spanish, and Russian snuffs from the soft parts of\r\nthe leaves. An English writer gives the following account of some of\r\nthe well-known snuffs and the method of manufacturing:--\r\n\r\n     \"For the famous fancy snuff known as Maroco, the recipe is\r\n     to take forty parts of French or St. Omer tobacco, with\r\n     twenty parts of fermented Virginia stalks in powder; the\r\n     whole to be ground and sifted. To this powder must be added\r\n     two pounds and a half of rose leaves in fine powder; and the\r\n     whole must be moistened with salt and water and thoroughly\r\n     incorporated. After that it must be 'worked up' with cream\r\n     and salts of tartar, and packed in lead to preserve its\r\n     delicate aroma. The celebrated 'gros grain Paris snuff' is\r\n     composed of equal parts of Amersfoort and James River\r\n     tobacco, and the scent is imported by a 'sauce,' among the\r\n     ingredients of which are salt, soda, tamarinds, red wine,\r\n     syrup, cognac, and cream of tartar.\"\r\n\r\nThe mode of manufacture of snuff now is far different than that\r\nemployed in the Seventeenth Century. Then the leaves were simply dried\r\nand made fine by rubbing them together in the hands, or ground in some\r\nrude mill; still later the tobacco was washed or cleansed in water,\r\ndried, and then ground. Now, however, the tobacco undergoes quite a\r\nprocess, and must be kept packed several months before it is ground\r\ninto snuff. One of the most celebrated manufacturers of snuff was\r\nJames Gillespie, of Edinburgh, who compounded the famous variety\r\nbearing his name. The following account of him we take from \"The\r\nTobacco Plant:\"--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Gillespie.]\r\n\r\n     \"In the High Street of Edinburgh, a little east from the\r\n     place where formerly stood the Cross,--\r\n\r\n          \"'Dun-Edin's Cross, a pillar'd stone,\r\n            Rose on a turret octagon,'\r\n\r\n     was situated the shop of James Gillespie, the celebrated\r\n     snuff manufacturer. The shop is still occupied by a\r\n     tobacconist, whose sign is the head of a typical negro, and\r\n     in one of the windows is exhibited the effigy of a\r\n     Highlander, who is evidently a competent judge of\r\n     'sneeshin.' Not much is known regarding the personal history\r\n     of James Gillespie, but it is understood that he was born\r\n     shortly after the Jacobite rebellion of 1715, at Roslin, a\r\n     picturesque village about six miles from Edinburgh. He\r\n     became a tobacconist in Edinburgh, along with his brother\r\n     John, and by the exercise of steady industry and frugality,\r\n     he was enabled to purchase Spylaw, a small estate in the\r\n     parish of Colinton, about four miles from Edinburgh, where\r\n     he erected a snuff-mill on the banks of the Water of Leith,\r\n     a small stream which flows through the finely-wooded grounds\r\n     of Spylaw. The younger brother, John, attended to the shop,\r\n     while the subject of our notice resided at Spylaw, where he\r\n     superintended the snuff-mill. Mr. Gillespie was able to\r\n     continue his industrious habits through a long life, and\r\n     having made some successful speculations in tobacco during\r\n     the war of American Independence, when the 'weed' advanced\r\n     considerably in price, he was enabled to increase his Spylaw\r\n     estate from time to time by making additional purchases of\r\n     property in the parish.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Gillespie remained through life a bachelor. His\r\n     establishment at Spylaw was of the simplest description. It\r\n     is said that he invariably sat at the same table with his\r\n     servants, indulging in familiar conversation, and entering\r\n     with much spirit into their amusements. Newspapers were not\r\n     so widely circulated at that period as they are now, and on\r\n     the return of any of his domestics from the city, which one\r\n     of them daily visited, he listened with great attention to\r\n     the 'news, and enjoyed with much zest the narration of any\r\n     jocular incident that had occurred. Mr. Gillespie had a\r\n     _penchant_ for animals, and their wants were carefully\r\n     attended to. His poultry, equally with his horses, could\r\n     have testified to the judicious attention which he bestowed\r\n     upon them. A story is told of the familiarity between the\r\n     laird and his riding horse, which was well-fed and full of\r\n     spirit.\r\n\r\n     \"The animal frequently indulged in a little restive\r\n     curvetting with its master, especially when the latter was\r\n     about to get into the saddle. 'Come, come,' he would say, on\r\n     such occasions, addressing the animal in his usual quiet\r\n     way, 'hae dune, noo, for ye'll no like if I come across your\r\n     lugs (ears) wi' the stick.'\r\n\r\n     \"Even in his old age Mr. Gillespie regularly superintended\r\n     the operations in the mill, which was situated in the rear\r\n     of his house. On these occasions he was wrapped in an old\r\n     blanket ingrained with snuff. Though he kept a carriage he\r\n     very seldom used it, until shortly before his death, when\r\n     increasing infirmities caused him occasionally to take a\r\n     drive. It was of this carriage, plain and neat in its\r\n     design, with nothing on its panel but the initials 'J. G.'\r\n     that the witty Henry Erskine proposed the couplet--\r\n\r\n          'Who would have thought it\r\n           That noses had bought it?'\r\n\r\n     as an appropriate motto. In those days snuff was much more\r\n     extensively used than at present, and Mr. Gillespie was in\r\n     the habit of gratuitously filling the 'mulls' of many of the\r\n     Edinburgh characters of the last century. Colinton appears\r\n     to have been a great snuff-making centre. About thirty years\r\n     ago there were five snuff mills in operation in the parish,\r\n     the produce of which was sold in Edinburgh. Even now a\r\n     considerable quantity of snuff is made in the district,\r\n     chiefly by grinders to the trade.\"\r\n\r\nMurray, alluding to the popularity of the custom in England during\r\nthe reign of the House of Brunswick, says:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fops taking snuff. (_From an old print_).]\r\n\r\n     \"The reigns of the four Georges may be entitled the snuffing\r\n     period of English history. The practice became an appanage\r\n     of fashion before 1714, as it has continued after 1830, to\r\n     be the comfort of priests, literary men, highlanders,\r\n     tailors, factory hands, and old people of both sexes. George\r\n     IV. was a nasute judge of snuffs, and so enamoured of the\r\n     delectation, that in each of his palaces he kept a jar\r\n     chamber, containing a choice assortment of tobacco powder,\r\n     presided over by a critical superintendent. His favorite\r\n     stimulant in the morning was violet Strasburgh, the same\r\n     which had previously helped Queen Charlotte to 'kill the\r\n     day'--after dinner Carrotte--named from his _penchant_ for\r\n     it. King's Carrotte, Martinique, Etrenne, Old Paris, Bureau,\r\n     Cologne, Bordeaux, Havre, Princeza, Rouen, and Rappee, were\r\n     placed on the table, in as many rich and curious boxes.\"\r\n\r\nSterne, in his \"Sentimental Journey,\" gives a pleasing description of\r\nsnuff-taking with the poor monk. He writes:\r\n\r\n     \"The good old monk was within six paces of us, as the idea\r\n     of him crossed my mind; and was advancing towards us a\r\n     little out of the line, as if uncertain whether he should\r\n     break in upon us or no. He stoop'd, however, as soon as he\r\n     came up to us with a world of frankness; and having a horn\r\n     snuff-box in his hand, he presented it open to me.\r\n\r\n     \"'You shall taste mine,' said I, pulling out my box (which\r\n     was a small tortoise one), and putting it into his hand.\r\n\r\n     \"''Tis most excellent,' said the monk.\r\n\r\n     \"'Then do me the favor,' I replied 'to accept of the box and\r\n     all, and when you take a pinch out of it, sometimes\r\n     recollect it was the peace-offering of a man who once used\r\n     you unkindly, but not from his heart.'\r\n\r\n     \"The poor monk blushed as red as scarlet, 'Mon Dieu?' said\r\n     he, pressing his hands together, 'you never used me\r\n     unkindly.'\r\n\r\n     \"'I should think,' said the lady, 'he is not likely.'\r\n\r\n     I blushed in my turn; but from what motives, I leave to the\r\n     few who feel to analyze. 'Excuse me, madam,' replied I, 'I\r\n     treated him most unkindly, and from no provocations.'\r\n\r\n     \"''Tis impossible,' said the lady.\r\n\r\n     \"'My God!' cried the monk, with a warmth of asseveration\r\n     which seemed not to belong to him, 'the fault was in me, and\r\n     in the indiscretion of my zeal.'\r\n\r\n     \"The lady opposed it, and I joined with her in maintaining\r\n     it was impossible, that a spirit so regulated as his could\r\n     give offence to any. I knew not that contention could be\r\n     rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the nerves as I\r\n     then felt it. We remained silent, without any sensation of\r\n     that foolish pain which takes place when, in a circle, you\r\n     look for ten minutes in one another's faces without saying a\r\n     word.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Horn snuff-boxes.]\r\n\r\n     \"Whilst this lasted, the monk rubb'd his horn box upon the\r\n     sleeve of his tunic; and as soon as it had acquired a little\r\n     air of brightness by the friction, he made a low bow and\r\n     said, 'twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or\r\n     goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this\r\n     contest, but be it as it would, he begg'd we would exchange\r\n     boxes. In saying this, he presented this to me with one, as\r\n     he took mine from me in the other; and having kissed it,\r\n     with a stream of good nature in his eyes, he put it into his\r\n     bosom, and took his leave. I guard this box as I would the\r\n     instrumental parts of my religion, to help my mind on to\r\n     something better: in truth I seldom go abroad without it;\r\n     and oft and many a time have I called up by it the\r\n     courteous spirit of its owner, to regulate my own in the\r\n     jostlings of the world; they had found full employment for\r\n     his, as I learnt from his story, till about the forty-fifth\r\n     year of his age, when upon some military services\r\n     ill-requited, and meeting at the same time with a\r\n     disappointment in the tenderest of passions, he abandoned\r\n     the sword and the sex together, and took sanctuary, not so\r\n     much in his convent as in himself. I feel a damp upon my\r\n     spirits, as I am going to add, that in my last return\r\n     through Calais, upon inquiring after Father Lorenzo, I heard\r\n     he had been dead near three months, and was buried, not in\r\n     his convent, but according to his desire, in a little\r\n     cemetery belonging to it about two leagues off. I had a\r\n     strong desire to see where they had laid him, when, upon\r\n     pulling out his little horn box, as I sat by his grave, and\r\n     plucking a nettle or two at the head of it, which had no\r\n     business to grow there, they all struck together so forcibly\r\n     upon my affections that I burst into a flood of tears--but I\r\n     am as weak as a woman; I beg the world not to smile, but\r\n     pity me.\"\r\n\r\nMany pleasing effusions have been written promoted doubtless by a\r\nsneeze among which the following on \"A pinch of Snuff\" from \"The\r\nSportsman Magazine,\" exhibits the custom and the benefits ascribed to\r\nits indulgence.\r\n\r\n    \"With mind or body sore distrest,\r\n    Or with repeated cares opprest,\r\n    What sets the aching heart at rest?\r\n                            A pinch of snuff!\r\n\r\n    \"Or should some sharp and gnawing pain\r\n    Creep round the noddle of the brain,\r\n    What puts all things to rights again?\r\n                            A pinch of snuff!\r\n\r\n    \"When speech and tongue together fail,\r\n    What helps old ladies in their tale,\r\n    And adds fresh canvass to their sail?\r\n                            A pinch of snuff!\r\n\r\n    \"Or when some drowsy parson prays,\r\n    And still more drowsy people gaze,\r\n    What opes their eyelids with amaze?\r\n                            A pinch of snuff!\r\n\r\n    \"A comfort which they can't forsake,\r\n    What is it some would rather take,\r\n    Than good roast beef, or rich plum cake?\r\n                            A pinch of snuff!\r\n\r\n    \"Should two old gossips chance to sit,\r\n    And sip their slop, and talk of it,\r\n    What gives a sharpness to their wit?\r\n                            A pinch of snuff!\r\n\r\n    \"What introduces Whig or Tory,\r\n    And reconciles them in their story,\r\n    When each is boasting in his glory?\r\n                            A pinch of snuff!\r\n\r\n    \"What warms without a conflagration\r\n    Excites without intoxication,\r\n    And rouses without irritation?\r\n                            A pinch of snuff!\r\n\r\n    \"When friendship fades, and fortune's spent,\r\n    And hope seems gone the way they went,\r\n    One cheering ray of joy is sent--\r\n                            A pinch of snuff!\r\n\r\n    \"Then let us sing in praise of snuff!\r\n    And call it not such 'horrid stuff,'\r\n    At which some frown, and others puff,\r\n                            And seem to flinch.\r\n\r\n    \"But when a friend presents a box,\r\n    Avoid the scruples and the shocks\r\n    Of him who laughs and he who mocks,\r\n                            And take a pinch!\"\r\n\r\nFrom \"Pandora's Box\" from which we have already quoted, we extract the\r\nfollowing in which the use of snuff is deprecated by the author:\r\n\r\n                        --\"now, 'tis by every sort\r\n  And sex adored, from Billingsgate to court.\r\n  But ask a dame 'how oysters sell?' if nice,\r\n  She begs a pinch before she sets a price.\r\n  Go thence to 'Change, inquire the price of Stocks;\r\n  Before they ope their lips they open first the box.\r\n  Next pay a visit to the Temple, where\r\n  The lawyers live, who gold to Heaven prefer;\r\n  You'll find them stupify'd to that degree,\r\n  They'll take a pinch before they'll take their fee.\r\n  Then make a step and view the splendid court,\r\n  Where all the gay, the great, the good resort;\r\n  E'en they, whose pregnant skulls, though large and thick,\r\n  Can scarce secure their native sense and wit,\r\n  Are feeding of their hungry souls with pure\r\n  Ambrosial snuff.  *  *  *  *\r\n  But to conclude: the gaudy court resign,\r\n  T' observe, for once, a place much more divine,\r\n  When the same folly's acted by the good,\r\n  And is the sole devotion of the lewd;\r\n  The church, more sacred once, is what we mean,\r\n  Where now they flock to see and to be seen;\r\n  The box is used, the book laid by, as dead,\r\n  With snuff, not Scripture, there the soul is fed;\r\n  For where to heaven the hands by one of those,\r\n  Are lifted, twenty have them at the nose;\r\n  And while some pray, to be from sudden death\r\n  Deliver'd, others snuff to stop their breath.\"\r\n\r\nPaolo Mantegazza, one of the most brilliant and witty of Italian\r\nwriters on tobacco, says of its use and \"some of the delights that may\r\nbe imagined through the sense of smell:\"--\r\n\r\n     \"Human civilization has not yet learned to found on the\r\n     sense of smell aught but the moderate enjoyment derived from\r\n     snuffing, which, confined within the narrow circle of a few\r\n     sensations, renders us incapable of entering into the most\r\n     delicate pleasures of that sense.\r\n\r\n     \"Snuff procures us the rapture of a tactile irritation, of a\r\n     slight perfume; but, above all, it furnishes the charm of an\r\n     intermittent occupation which soothes us by interrupting,\r\n     from time to time, our labor. At other times it renders\r\n     idleness less insupportable to us, by breaking it into the\r\n     infinite intervals which pass from one pinch of snuff to\r\n     another. Sometimes our snuff-box arouses us from torpor and\r\n     drowsiness; sometimes, it occupies our hands when in society\r\n     we do not know where to put them or what to do with them.\r\n     Finally, snuff and snuffing are things which we can love,\r\n     because they are always with us; and we can season them with\r\n     a little vanity if we possess a snuff-box of silver or of\r\n     gold, which we open continually before those who humbly\r\n     content themselves with snuff-boxes of bone or of wood. We\r\n     gladly concede the pleasures of snuffing to men of all\r\n     conditions, and to ladies who, having passed a certain age,\r\n     or who, being deformed, have no longer any sex; but we\r\n     solemnly and resolutely refuse the snuff-box to young and\r\n     beautiful women, who ought to preserve their delicate and\r\n     pretty noses for the odors of the mignonette and the rose.\"\r\n\r\nWith royalty snuff has been a prime favorite. Charles III. of Spain\r\nhad a great predilection for rappee snuff, but only indulged his\r\ninclination by stealth, and particularly while shooting, when he\r\nimagined himself to be unnoticed. Frederick the Great and Napoleon[61]\r\nboth loved and used large quantities of the \"pungent dust.\" Of the\r\nformer the following anecdote is related:--\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 61: Napoleon, having been unable to undergo\r\n              the ordeal of a first pipe, stigmatized it us a habit\r\n              only fit to amuse sluggards. What he renounced in\r\n              smoking, however, he compensated in snuff.]\r\n\r\n     \"The cynical temper of Frederick the Great is well known.\r\n     Once when his sister, the Duchess of Brunswick, was at\r\n     Potsdam, Frederick made to the brave Count Schwerin the\r\n     present of a gold snuff-box. On the lid inside was painted\r\n     the head of an ass. Next day, when dining with the king,\r\n     Schwerin, with some ostentation, put his snuff-box on the\r\n     table. Wishing to turn the joke against Schwerin, the king\r\n     called attention to the snuff-box. The Duchess took it up\r\n     and opened it. Immediately she exclaimed, 'What a striking\r\n     likeness! In truth, brother, this is one of the best\r\n     portraits I have ever seen of you.' Frederick, embarrassed,\r\n     thought his sister was carrying the jest too far. She passed\r\n     the box to her neighbor, who uttered similar expressions to\r\n     her own. The box made the round of the table, and every one\r\n     was fervently eloquent about the marvelous resemblance. The\r\n     king was puzzled what to make of all this. When the box at\r\n     last reached his hands, he saw, to his great surprise, that\r\n     his portrait was really there. Count Schwerin had simply,\r\n     with exceeding dispatch, employed an artist to remove the\r\n     ass's head, and to paint the king's head instead. Frederick\r\n     could not help laughing at the Count's clever trick, which\r\n     was really the best rebuke of his own bad taste and want of\r\n     proper and respectful feeling.\"\r\n\r\n     \"As Frederick William I., of Prussia, was eminently the\r\n     Smoking King, so his son Frederick the Great was eminently\r\n     the Snuffing King. Perhaps smoking harmonizes best with\r\n     action; and it might, without much stretch of fancy, be\r\n     shown that as the Prussian monarchy was founded on tobacco\r\n     smoke, it flourished on snuff. Possibly, if Napoleon the\r\n     Great, who like Frederick the Great, was an excessive\r\n     snuffer, had smoked as well as snuffed, he might have\r\n     preserved his empire from overthrow, seeing that smoking\r\n     steadies and snuffing impels. The influences of smoking and\r\n     snuffing on politics and war are ascertainable. What the\r\n     effect of chewing is on political and military affairs, it\r\n     is not so easy to discover. We recommend the subject for\r\n     meditation to the profoundest metaphysicians. How many of\r\n     the American politicians and generals have been chewers as\r\n     well as snuffers and smokers? Is there to be some mysterious\r\n     affinity between chewing and the revolutions, especially the\r\n     social revolutions of the future? May not apocalyptic\r\n     interpreters be able to show that chewing is the symbol of\r\n     anarchy and annihilation?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scotch snuff-mills.]\r\n\r\nWhen first used in Europe snuff was made ready for use by the\r\ntakers--each person being provided with a box or \"mill,\" as they were\r\ntermed, to reduce the leaves to powder.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this, the following may not be irrelevent:--\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote of Huerta the celebrated Spanish guitarist, is\r\ntaken from one of M. Ella's programmes:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the year 1826 the famous Huerta, who astonished the\r\n     English by his performances on the guitar, was anxious to be\r\n     introduced to the leader of the Italian Opera Band--a\r\n     warm-hearted and sensitive Neapolitan--Spagnoletti. The\r\n     latter had a great contempt for guitars, concertinas, and\r\n     other fancy instruments not used in the orchestra. He was\r\n     fond of snuff, had a capacious nose, and, when irritated,\r\n     would ejaculate '_Mon Dieu!_' On my presenting the vain\r\n     Spaniard to Spagnoletti, the latter inquired, 'Vat you\r\n     play?' Huerta--'De guitar-r-r, sare.' Spagnoletti--'De\r\n     guitar! humph!' (takes a pinch of snuff.) Huerta--'Yeas,\r\n     sare, de guitar-r-r, and ven I play my _adagio_, de tears\r\n     shall run down both side your pig nose.' 'Vell den,' (taking\r\n     snuff,) said Spagnoletti, 'I vill not hear your _adagio_.'\"\r\n\r\nThe anecdote related of Count de Tesse, a celebrated courtier of\r\nFrance, is one of the best of its kind:--\r\n\r\n     \"Count de Tesse, Marshal of France, was an eminent man\r\n     during the reign of Louis XIV. Though he was a brave soldier\r\n     and by no means an incompetent general, yet he was more\r\n     remarkable as a skillful diplomatist and a pliant and\r\n     prosperous courtier. During the War of Succession in Spain,\r\n     he besieged Barcelona with a considerable army, in the\r\n     spring of 1705. Terrible was the assault, and terrible was\r\n     the resistance. At the end of six weeks the arrival of the\r\n     British fleet, and reinforcements thrown into the place,\r\n     forced Marshal Tesse to retire. Besides immense losses in\r\n     dead and wounded, he had to abandon two hundred and twenty\r\n     cannon and all his supplies. Incessantly fighting for\r\n     fifteen days in his retreat towards the Pyrenees, he lost\r\n     three thousand more of his men. It ought to be said, in\r\n     vindication of Tesse, that he undertook the siege by express\r\n     and urgent command of the French King, and contrary to his\r\n     own judgment; for in writing to a friend, he said: 'If a\r\n     Consistory were held to decide the infallibility of the\r\n     King, as Consistories have been held to decide the\r\n     infallibility of the Pope, I should by my vote declare His\r\n     Majesty infallible. His orders have confounded all human\r\n     science.'\r\n\r\n     \"Soon after the siege of Barcelona, a lady at a fashionable\r\n     party took out her snuff-box and offered a pinch to any one\r\n     who wished it. Marshal Tesse approached to take a pinch; but\r\n     suddenly the lady drew her snuff-box back, saying, 'For you,\r\n     Marshal, the snuff is too strong--it is Barcelona.'\"\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the dry kinds of snuff are in favor and are esteemed as\r\nhighly as the moister snuffs. Robert Leighton gives the following pen\r\npicture of the snuff-loving Scotchman; it is entitled \"The Snuffie\r\nAuld Man:\"--\r\n\r\n  \"By the cosie fire-side, or the sun-ends o' gavels,\r\n  The snuffie auld bodie is sure to be seen.\r\n  Tap, tappin' his snuff-box, he snifters and sneevils,\r\n  And smachers the snuff frae his mou' to his een.\r\n  'Since tobacco cam' in, and the snuffin' began,\r\n  There hasna been seen sic a snuffie auld man.\r\n\r\n  \"His haurins are dozen'd, his een sair bedizzened.\r\n  And red round the lids as the gills o' a fish;\r\n  His face is a' bladdit, his sark-breest a' smaddit.\r\n  As snuffie a picture as ony could wish.\r\n  He makes a mere merter o' a' thing he does,\r\n  Wi' snuff frae his fingers an' drops frae his nose.\r\n\r\n  \"And wow but his nose is a troublesome member--\r\n  Day and nicht, there's nae end to its snuffie desire:\r\n  It's wide as the chimlie, it's red as an ember,\r\n  And has to be fed like a dry-whinnie fire.\r\n  It's a troublesome member, and gi'es him nae peace,\r\n  Even sleepin', or eatin', or sayin' the grace.\r\n\r\n  \"The kirk is disturbed wi' his hauckin' and sneezin'\r\n  The dominie stoppit when leadin' the psalm;\r\n  The minister, deav'd out o' logic and reason,\r\n  Pours gall in the lugs that are gapi' for balm.\r\n  The auld folks look surly, the young chaps jocose,\r\n  While the bodie himsel' is bambazed wi' his nose.\r\n\r\n  \"He scrimps the auld wife baith in garnal and caddy\r\n  He snuffs what wad keep her in comfort and ease;\r\n  Rapee, Lundyfitt, Prince's Mixture, and Toddy,\r\n  She looks upon them as the worst o' her faes.\r\n  And we'll see an end o' her kooshian nar\r\n  While the auld carle's nose is upheld like a Czar.\"\r\n\r\nSharp has written some verses founded upon the following singular\r\nanecdote in Dean Ramsay's \"Reminiscences of Scottish Life and\r\nCharacter:\"\r\n\r\n     \"The inveterate snuff-taker, like the dram-drinker, felt\r\n     severely the being deprived of his accustomed stimulant, as\r\n     in the following instance: A severe snow-storm in the\r\n     Highlands, which lasted for several weeks, having stopped\r\n     all communication betwixt neighboring hamlets, the\r\n     snuff-boxes were soon reduced to their last pinch. Borrowing\r\n     and begging from all the neighbors within reach were first\r\n     resorted to, but when these failed all were alike reduced to\r\n     the longing which unwillingly abstinent snuff-takers alone\r\n     know. The minister of the parish was amongst the unhappy\r\n     number; the craving was so intense that study was out of the\r\n     question, and he became quite restless. As a last resort,\r\n     the beadle was dispatched through the snow, to a neighboring\r\n     glen, in the hope of getting a supply; but he came back as\r\n     unsuccessful as he went. 'What's to be done, John? was the\r\n     minister's pathetic inquiry. John shook his head, as much as\r\n     to say that he could not tell, but immediately thereafter\r\n     started up, as if a new idea occurred to him. He came back\r\n     in a few minutes, crying, 'Hae!' The minister, too eager to\r\n     be scrutinizing, took a long deep pinch, and then said,\r\n     'Whour did you get it?' 'I soupit (swept) the poupit,' was\r\n     John's expressive reply. The minister's accumulated\r\n     superfluous Sabbath snuff now came into good use.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sweeping from the Pulpit.]\r\n\r\n    \"Near the Highlands,\r\n    Where the dry lands\r\n    Are divided into islands,\r\n    And distinguish'd from the mainland\r\n    As the Western Hebrides.\r\n\r\n    \"Stormy weather,\r\n    Those who stay there,\r\n    Oftentimes for weeks together\r\n    Keep asunder from their neighbors,\r\n    Hemm'd about by angry seas.\r\n\r\n    \"For, storm-batter'd,\r\n    Boats are shattered,\r\n    And their precious cargoes scatter'd\r\n    In the boist'rous Sound of Jura,\r\n    Or thy passage, Colonsay;\r\n\r\n    \"While the seamen,\r\n    Like true freemen,\r\n    Battle bravely with the Demon\r\n    Of the storm, who strives to keep them\r\n    From their harbor in the bay.\r\n\r\n    \"For this reason\r\n    One bad season,\r\n    (If to say so be not treason,)\r\n    In an island town the people\r\n    Were reduced to great distress.\r\n\r\n    \"Though on mainland\r\n    They would fain land,\r\n    They were storm-bound in their ain land,\r\n    Where each luxury was little,\r\n    And grew beautifully less.\r\n\r\n    \"But whose sorrow,\r\n    That sad morrow,\r\n    When no man could beg or borrow\r\n    From a friend's repository,\r\n    Equall'd theirs who craved for snuff.\r\n\r\n    \"But, most sadden'd,\r\n    Nearly madden'd\r\n    For the lack of that which gladden'd\r\n    His proboscis, was the parson,\r\n    Hight the Rev'rend Neil Macduff.\r\n\r\n    \"If a snuffer,\r\n    Though no puffer,\r\n    You may guess what pangs he'd suffer\r\n    In his journey through a snow-drift,\r\n    Visiting a neighboring town.\r\n\r\n    \"From his rushing\r\n    For some sneishing;\r\n    But his choring and his fishing\r\n    Could procure no Toddy's Mixture,\r\n    Moist Rappee, or Kendal Brown.\r\n\r\n    \"In his trouble--\r\n    Now made double,\r\n    Since his last hope proved a bubble--\r\n    To his aid came Beadle Johnnie,\r\n    In his parish right-hand man.\r\n\r\n    \"With a packet,\r\n    Saying, Tak' it,\r\n    It's as clean as I can mak' it,\r\n    If ye'd save yer snuff on Sabbath\r\n    A toom box ye needna scan.\r\n\r\n    \"Being lusty\r\n    (Though 'twas musty)\r\n    To his nose the snuff so dusty\r\n    Put the minister, too much in want,\r\n    The gift to scrutinize.\r\n\r\n    \"An idea\r\n    He could see a\r\n    Blessing in this panacea;\r\n    So he took such hearty pinches as brought\r\n    Tears into his eyes.\r\n\r\n    \"Then to Johnnie,\r\n    His old cronie,\r\n    Cried--'I fear'd I'd ne'er get ony.'\r\n    'Well, I'll tell ye,' said the beadle,\r\n    'Whaur I got the stock of snuff.'\r\n\r\n    \"'In the poupit\r\n    Low I stoopit,\r\n    An' the snuff and stour I soupit,\r\n    Then I brocht ye here a handfu',\r\n    For ye need it sair enough.'\"\r\n\r\nThe old Scottish snuff-mill, which consisted of a small box-like\r\nreceptacle into which fitted a conical-shaped projection with a short,\r\nstrong handle was a more substantial affair than the rasp used by the\r\nFrench and English snuff-takers. (See page 232). Both, answered the\r\npurpose for which they were designed, the leaves of tobacco being\r\n\"toasted before the fire,\" and then ground in the mill as it was\r\ncalled. The more modern snuff-mill is similar in shape, but is used to\r\nhold the snuff after being ground, rather than for reducing the leaves\r\nto a powder.\r\n\r\nBoswell gives the following poem on snuff, in his \"Shrubs of\r\nParnassus:\"\r\n\r\n  \"Oh Snuff! our fashionable end and aim!\r\n  Strasburg, Rappee, Dutch, Scotch, what'eer thy name,\r\n  Powder celestial! quintessence divine!\r\n  New joys entrance my soul while thou art mine.\r\n  Who takes--who takes thee not! where'er I range,\r\n  I smell thy sweets from Pall Mall to the 'Change.\r\n  By thee assisted, ladies kill the day,\r\n  And breathe their scandal freely o'er their tea;\r\n  Nor less they prize thy virtues when in bed,\r\n  One pinch of thee revives the vapor'd head,\r\n  Removes the spleen, removes the qualmish fit,\r\n  And gives a brisker turn to female wit,\r\n  Warms in the nose, refreshes like the breeze,\r\n  Glows in the herd and tickles in the sneeze.\r\n  Without it, Tinsel, what would be thy lot!\r\n  What, but to strut neglected and forgot!\r\n  What boots it for thee to have dipt thy hand\r\n  In odors wafted from Arabian land?\r\n  Ah! what avails thy scented solitaire,\r\n  Thy careless swing and pertly tripping air,\r\n  The crimson wash that glows upon thy face,\r\n  Thy modish hat, and coat that flames with lace!\r\n  In vain thy dress, in vain thy trimmings shine,\r\n  If the Parisian snuff-box be not thine.\r\n  Come to my nose, then, Snuff, nor come alone,\r\n  Bring taste with thee, for taste is all thy own.\"\r\n\r\nThere seems to be as great a variety of design in snuff-boxes as among\r\npipes and tobacco-stoppers. The Indians of both North and South\r\nAmerica have their mills for grinding or pulverizing the leaves. In\r\nthe East a great variety of snuff-boxes may be seen; they are made of\r\nwood and ivory, while many of them have a spoon attached to the box,\r\nwhich they use in taking the dust from the box to the back of the\r\nhand, whence it is taken by the forefinger and conveyed to the nose.\r\nIn Europe we find greater variety of design in snuff-boxes than in the\r\nEast. In Europe they are made of the most costly materials, and\r\nstudded with the rarest gems.\r\n\r\nIn the East they are made of ivory, wood, bamboo, and other materials.\r\nOf late years boxes made of wood from Abbotsford or some other noted\r\nplace have been used for the manufacture of snuff-boxes. Formerly when\r\nsnuff-taking was in more general use by kings and courtiers than\r\nnow--a magnificent snuff-box was considered by royalty as one of the\r\nmost valuable and pleasing of \"memorials.\" Many of these testimonials\r\nof friendship and regard were of gold and silver, and set with\r\ndiamonds of the finest water.\r\n\r\nAmong the anecdotes of celebrated snuff-takers, the following from\r\nWhite's \"Life of Swedenborg,\" will be new to many:\r\n\r\n     \"Swedenborg took snuff profusely and carelessly, strewing it\r\n     over his papers and the carpet. His manuscripts bear its\r\n     traces to this day. His carpet set those sneezing who shook\r\n     it. One Sunday he desired to have it taken up and beaten.\r\n     Shearsmith objected, 'Better wait till to-morrow,' 'Dat be\r\n     good! dat be good!' was his answer.\"\r\n\r\nWe copy the following article on the manufacture of snuff from a\r\nwell-known English journal, \"Cope's Tobacco Plant:\"--\r\n\r\n     \"Although snuff is still extensively consumed in this\r\n     country (Great Britain), the mode of its manufacture is very\r\n     little known to those who use it; and there are very few\r\n     persons of even the most inquisitive turn of mind who can\r\n     say they have ever penetrated into the mysterious precincts\r\n     of a snuff-mill. Even those who have been privileged, and\r\n     have had the courage to inspect the interior of such an\r\n     establishment, have come away with very vague notions of\r\n     what they saw. The hollow whirr of the revolving pestles,\r\n     the hazy atmosphere closely resembling a London fog in\r\n     November, a phenomenon which is produced by the innumerable\r\n     particles of tobacco floating about, and causing the gas to\r\n     flicker and sparkle in a mysterious way, and producing a\r\n     lively irritation of the mucous membrane, all combine in\r\n     placing the visitor in a state of amusing bewilderment, and\r\n     he is compelled to make a speedy exit, having only had just\r\n     a running peep at the interesting process of snuff-making.\r\n     It is therefore our duty to give a description of a process\r\n     which will be new to a large number of people, and will help\r\n     to clear up some of the obscure theories that a great many\r\n     more entertain of it.\r\n\r\n     \"Those persons who have travelled on the Continent, and who\r\n     have noticed on tobacconists' counters a small machine,\r\n     somewhat like a coffee-mill, which a man works with one\r\n     hand, while he holds a hard-pressed plug of tobacco about a\r\n     pound weight against the revolving grater, and produces\r\n     snuff while the snuff-taker waits for it, may imagine that\r\n     snuff in England is produced on a somewhat similar small\r\n     scale. But this, like many kindred theories, is quite a\r\n     mistake. In this country there exist large snuff-mills\r\n     worked by steam power, and in Scotland there is one\r\n     water-mill which is driven by a water-power of the strength\r\n     of thirty horses. The grinding of snuff is at present\r\n     carried on much as it was one hundred years ago. The\r\n     apparatus, although effective, is very primitive, and would\r\n     lead one to suppose that mechanical ingenuity had wholly\r\n     neglected to trouble itself about improving that branch of\r\n     machinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snuff-mill a century ago.]\r\n\r\n     \"All kinds of snuff are made from tobacco leaves, or tobacco\r\n     stalks, either separate or mixed. This in the first instance\r\n     goes through a kind of fermentation, and, like the basis of\r\n     soup at the modern hotels, forms, as it were, the stock from\r\n     which all the varieties in flavor and appearance are\r\n     produced by special treatment and flavoring. Of course the\r\n     strength and pungency of the snuff will depend a good deal\r\n     upon the richness of the tobacco originally put aside for\r\n     it. About one thousand pounds of tobacco would form an\r\n     ordinary batch of snuff. The duty on this would amount to\r\n     about £150, and this has to be paid before the tobacco is\r\n     removed from the bonded warehouse. Having got his heap of\r\n     material ready, the snuff-maker moistens it, then places it\r\n     in a warm room and covers it over with warm cloths--coddles\r\n     it, as it were, to make it comfortable, so that the cold air\r\n     cannot get to it--and the heap is then left for three or\r\n     four weeks, as the case may be, to ferment.\r\n\r\n     \"In France, where, under the Imperial _régime_, snuff-making\r\n     was a Government monopoly, the tobacco was allowed to\r\n     ferment for twelve or eighteen months; and in the principal\r\n     factory (that at Strasburg) might have been seen scores of\r\n     huge bins, as large as porter vats, all piled up with\r\n     tobacco in various stages of fermentation. The tobacco,\r\n     after being fermented, if intended for that light, powdery,\r\n     brown-looking snuff called S. P., is dried a little; or if\r\n     for Prince's Mixture, Macobau, or any other kind of Rappee,\r\n     is at once thrown into what is called the mull. The mull is\r\n     a kind of large iron mortar weighing about half a ton and\r\n     lined with wood; and there is a heavy pestle which travels\r\n     round it, forming, as it were, a large pestle and mortar.\r\n\r\nThese mulls are placed in rows and shut up in separate cupboards, to\r\nkeep in the dust. The snuff-maker wanders from one to the other, and\r\nfeeds them as they require.\r\n\r\n     \"When the grinding of the snuff is completed it is then\r\n     ready for flavouring, and in this consists the great art and\r\n     secret of the trade. Receipts for peculiar flavors are\r\n     handed down from father to son as most valuable heir-looms,\r\n     and these receipts are in fact a valuable property in many\r\n     instances, for so delicate is the nose of your snuff-taker\r\n     that he can detect the slightest variation in the\r\n     preparation of his favorite snuff. It is related of one old\r\n     snuff-maker in London, who had acquired a handsome fortune\r\n     and retired from business, that he made it a consideration\r\n     with his successors that he should be allowed, so long as he\r\n     lived, to attend one day in the week at the business and\r\n     flavor all the snuff. Most people will also be familiar with\r\n     some one of the numerous versions of the origin of the once\r\n     famous Lundy Foote Snuff, better known as 'Irish\r\n     Blackguard.'\r\n\r\n     \"The excise are very rigid in their laws for regulating the\r\n     manufacture of snuff; and with the exception of a little\r\n     common salt, which is added to make the tobacco keep, and\r\n     alkalies for bringing out the flavor, nothing is allowed to\r\n     be used but a few essential oils. And here we must digress\r\n     for a moment to correct a popular error, viz., that snuff\r\n     contains ground glass, put there for titillating purposes.\r\n     What appears to be ground glass is only the little crystals\r\n     or small particles of alkali that have not been dissolved.\r\n     So that fastidious snuff-takers may dismiss this bugbear at\r\n     once and forever.\r\n\r\n     \"The essential oils referred to form a very expensive item\r\n     to the manufacture of snuff. The ladies would be much\r\n     surprised to see a dusty snuff-maker drain off five pounds'\r\n     worth of pure unadulterated otto-of-roses into a tin can,\r\n     and as they (the ladies) would suppose, throw it away on a\r\n     heap of what would appear to them rubbishy dust in one\r\n     corner of the snuff-room. Of course the ladies would\r\n     consider the proper place for it to be on the cambric\r\n     handkerchief, but this idea would be about the last to occur\r\n     to your matter-of-fact snuff-maker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Perfuming snuff.]\r\n\r\n     \"In addition to otto-of-roses, the scent-room contains great\r\n     jars of essence of lemon, French geranium, verbena, oil of\r\n     pimento, bergamotte, etc., all of which are used in the\r\n     various flavoring combinations. There would most likely also\r\n     be a few hundred-weight of fine Tonquin beans, and one of\r\n     these beans is generally presented to any visitor who drops\r\n     in, as souvenir to carry away in his waistcoat pocket. Snuff\r\n     is very extensively used in the mills and factories of\r\n     Lancashire. Those who toil long in heated and noisy mills\r\n     seem to require, and doubtless do require, tobacco in some\r\n     shape or other to keep them from flagging; and as chewing is\r\n     not polite, and smoking in a mill not allowed, the only\r\n     resource left to the operative is his snuff. A singular\r\n     feature connected with this is, we believe, the fact that\r\n     spinners in very few instances use snuff-boxes, they prefer\r\n     having their supply of snuff screwed up in a piece of paper.\r\n     One retail shop-keeper in a busy spinning town in Lancashire\r\n     assured us that he retailed over four hundred weight of\r\n     snuff a week in pennyworths.\r\n\r\n     \"It is impossible to state the exact quantity of snuff used\r\n     in this country; but, as far as we can arrive at it from\r\n     statistics at hand, we should say it cannot be less than\r\n     five hundred tons per annum. This seems an enormous\r\n     quantity, considering the comparatively small number of\r\n     persons who now use snuff; but the great bulk of snuff seems\r\n     to be consumed by particular communities, such as the\r\n     Lancashire operatives, and the consumption of it is\r\n     therefore not generally observable; and further it should be\r\n     remembered that those who do take snuff, individually use\r\n     large quantities.\"\r\n\r\nSnuff-manufacturing has in some cases been attended with considerable\r\naffluence. One instance is the London manufacturer already mentioned,\r\nwhose profits accumulated to the extent of nearly a quarter of a\r\nmillion; another is the Lundy Foote business, and the third a Scotch\r\nmanufacturer (Gillespie), who by the way, practised a bit of\r\nbenevolence, in the shape of building an hospital, in return for the\r\ngood things fortune had sent him. Of course an hospital, like many\r\nother things, may have a doubtful origin, as witness the famous Guy's,\r\nwhich stands as a lasting monument to the wonderful profits that used\r\nto be made out of the iniquitous advance note system. But we do not by\r\nany means wish to make comparisons which must be odious and although\r\nthe profits of snuff-manufacturing are for a variety of\r\nreasons--amongst others the decreased consumption of the manufactured\r\narticle--not nearly as large as they were fifty years ago; yet we are\r\nsure that the fortunes accumulated by some of the old snuff-makers\r\nwere the result of honest, upright industry.\r\n\r\nOf European tobacco used in the manufacture of snuff that of Holland\r\nand France (St. Omer) is considered to be equal to any grown in\r\nEurope. Of the varieties grown in America, Virginia leaf is used quite\r\nextensively for some grades of snuff and \"good stout rich snuff leaf\"\r\ncommands excellent prices and meets with a ready sale.\r\n\r\nA writer gives the following account of the love the Terra Del\r\nFuegians have for tobacco.\r\n\r\n     \"This morning we were up early, a large party going ashore\r\n     for various scientific purposes, and the others taking the\r\n     ship out in the channel to do a little dredging; both\r\n     parties were very successful, and added much to our\r\n     collection. As we on the shore were about ready to come off,\r\n     we were visited by a party of Fuegians, five men, four\r\n     women, and nine children, with three dogs. They came in an\r\n     English-built boat, stolen or lost from some English ship.\r\n     The men and dogs landed and came towards us with a great\r\n     frankness of manner. They could talk neither English nor\r\n     Spanish, except the few words, boat, fire, tobac, galleto,\r\n     arco. But they understood the imperial manner of one of our\r\n     officers, who said quietly but firmly, 'keep back those\r\n     dogs,' and immediately drove back the barking curs with\r\n     sticks and stones. They warmed themselves at our fire, and\r\n     seemed disposed to be very civil and friendly. We gave them\r\n     our remaining biscuit, and what little tobacco there was in\r\n     our party to spare. One of them accepted a pinch of snuff\r\n     and pretended to sneeze, crying 'Hatchee!' with mock\r\n     solemnity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fuegian snuff-takers.]\r\n\r\n     An old man sat down on a stone and sang to us a low, sweet\r\n     recitation, or chant, in wild key, or mode, ending on a\r\n     rising melody with each stanza.\r\n\r\n     They followed us to the ship, and we gave them some calico\r\n     and beads, and tobacco, and also bought bows and arrows, and\r\n     a sea-urchin, paying them in tobacco. They clung to the ship\r\n     as we got under way, men and women, crying, 'Tobacco!' and\r\n     frantic to catch any fragment of the precious weed thrown to\r\n     them. But at length they let go, and we left the bay with\r\n     the cry of tobacco ringing in our ears.\"\r\n\r\nHaving spoken of most of the modes of using snuff in both the Old and\r\nNew World, we come now to a description of using snuff at the South,\r\nknown as \"dipping,\" and by some as \"rubbing,\" both terms used to\r\ndenote the same manner of use. The description of it as given by A. L.\r\nAdams is as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the South, and more especially in Virginia, where\r\n     tobacco has been cultivated for more than two hundred and\r\n     fifty years, and where a few pounds of it was the\r\n     legitimate price for a wife, it is not surprising that it\r\n     should be more highly prized and come into more general use\r\n     than in any other section of our country. On the banks of\r\n     the James River it was first successfully cultivated by the\r\n     English colony, and this simple fact alone must forever\r\n     throw a charm around it, which will foster the pride of the\r\n     Virginian who has any respect for his ancestry, and hold him\r\n     under sacred obligations to use, cherish, and defend the\r\n     plant and its use--all of which he regards as no less a\r\n     pleasure than a duty. Here too its many virtues were first\r\n     discovered, and its soothing effects first felt and\r\n     appreciated.\r\n\r\n     \"To the old Virginian it is indeed a cherished weed,\r\n     charming all manner of diseases, comforting in sorrow,\r\n     soothing the ills of life, and preserving to a good old age\r\n     and in a happy frame of mind all who use it. He believes in\r\n     its superior virtues, and ascribes to it more good qualities\r\n     than to any other known plant. He always carries it about\r\n     with him, and if perchance he gets out he is truly\r\n     miserable. He not only loves but worships it as a cure all.\r\n     His wife and daughters know its virtues full well, and use\r\n     it with equal grace and relish, believing it gives a lustre\r\n     to the eye and a freshness to the cheek rarely surpassed.\r\n     Among the variety of ways in which it is used none attracted\r\n     my attention so much as the novel manner of snuff-taking in\r\n     various parts of Virginia, West Virginia, the Carolinas and\r\n     Georgia.\r\n\r\n     \"In some localities the practice is unknown, while in many\r\n     others it is very common. I first discovered young ladies\r\n     putting snuff into their mouths as if eating it, when my\r\n     curiosity was excited to an alarming extent, but on being\r\n     invited to 'dip' with them I soon learned that they were not\r\n     eating, but 'rubbing and chewing' it, as they called it, and\r\n     in such a lively manner as to soon convince me that they\r\n     appreciated it. I found the habit to be quite common even\r\n     among the young of both sexes--all indulging in it as if it\r\n     afforded real satisfaction to the appetite for tobacco in\r\n     some form.\r\n\r\n     \"The young ladies however seemed the more attached to the\r\n     'rubbing process,' as it has been appropriately styled, and\r\n     defended it with equal logic and grace whenever it was\r\n     assailed. The young gentlemen when in the society of the\r\n     young ladies generally join them in this unique use of\r\n     snuff, as they are always sure to be invited and urged if\r\n     they decline, and to merit their favor of course they must\r\n     appear social. I believe, in credit to their taste,\r\n     however, that they really prefer a good cigar, and think it\r\n     more in keeping with their ideas of manhood and neatness. I\r\n     have seen young girls of ten 'rubbing and chewing,' as if\r\n     they appreciated it as much as mother Eve did the apple in\r\n     the garden of paradise.\r\n\r\n     \"I have also seen old ladies with trembling limbs and few\r\n     teeth 'rubbing and chewing,' as if it made them feel young\r\n     again. I have frequently been ushered unexpectedly into the\r\n     presence of young ladies, and found them puffing their\r\n     cigarettes in a manner that convinced me that they knew how\r\n     to smoke. There is nothing that will more surely and quickly\r\n     bring a stranger into the fellowship and good graces of the\r\n     ladies than to join them in their pet habit of\r\n     snuff-rubbing. It seems to form a bond of friendship which\r\n     they regard as sacred as the vows of wedlock.\r\n\r\n     \"The older matrons 'rub' less and smoke more, which is in\r\n     accordance with nature and philosophy: The older we grow the\r\n     more we smoke. They find solid pleasure in sitting by the\r\n     open grate after tea with fifteen inches of pipe's tail\r\n     between their teeth, and slowly but gracefully puffing the\r\n     perfumes of the exhilarating weed into the room, and\r\n     watching with childish pleasure the hazy curling wreaths of\r\n     smoke as they gently float around, changing in form and\r\n     color until they finally disappear up the chimney, affording\r\n     rich themes for meditation and profitable study, and perhaps\r\n     suggestive of earlier days when grandmother, an innocent,\r\n     blooming maid, was exchanged for the weed, the seed of which\r\n     produced the plant she is now burning. Everywhere I marked\r\n     only pleasant and soothing effects from the use of tobacco.\r\n\r\n     \"The planter is never more indifferent to the ills of life\r\n     and in sympathy with good feeling and pleasure, than when he\r\n     sits down after dinner in his vine-thatched portico and\r\n     lights his pipe, passing to his guests pipes, cigars, and\r\n     tobacco in various forms, leaving them to choose their\r\n     favorite mode of using it. Sambo is never more contented\r\n     than when he burns the weed in a cob pipe, and draws the\r\n     delicious smoke through an elder sprig or mullen stem. But\r\n     the maid is happiest of all when with her lover she sits\r\n     face to face, and they 'dip' together from the same magic\r\n     plant--tobacco.\r\n\r\n     \"In every walk of life throughout the sunny South tobacco in\r\n     some form may be found, and its effects are always the same,\r\n     whether drawn from the pocket of the beggar or taken with\r\n     gloved fingers from the golden tobacco-box of the planter.\r\n     For snuff the ladies have very nice round boxes with lids\r\n     which, they always carry with them full of black snuff\r\n     highly but pleasantly flavored. They also carry little\r\n     brushes or sticks about three inches long with pliable ends;\r\n     these they wet in the mouth, then dip into the snuff-box,\r\n     and then place it in the mouth outside of the gums and rub\r\n     earnestly for two or three minutes. 'Will you dip with me?'\r\n     is the usual way of putting the invitation, when the box is\r\n     drawn from the pocket and rapped slightly on the cover,\r\n     sometimes by all present, who thus signify their readiness\r\n     to 'dip,' then it is repassed open to all, and the 'dipping\r\n     and rubbing' begins in earnest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snuff-dipping.]\r\n\r\n     \"The only advantage I ever discovered in this unnatural way\r\n     of snuffing is in avoiding all unpleasant sneezing which\r\n     snuffing is sure to produce, although it is claimed that it\r\n     whitens and preserves the teeth and sweetens the mouth, and\r\n     produces a beneficial effect on the lungs, all of which is\r\n     true or not, just as you choose to believe. 'Will you dip\r\n     and rub with me?' said one of the prettiest belles of\r\n     Winchester, and in another city in another state the\r\n     daughter of an ex-governor, handing me a silver-tipped brush\r\n     and opening a rose-wood snuff-box richly inlaid with gold,\r\n     politely asked me to 'dip' with her, expressing the belief\r\n     that friendship would always follow. I have frequently been\r\n     asked by ladies when travelling through the country and\r\n     stopping at farm-houses, if I used tobacco--as a hint to\r\n     offer them some, and it was a pleasure to comply, and\r\n     receive the thankful smile of an appreciative heart.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snuffers.]\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the country the habit of snuff-taking is confined\r\nprincipally to old ladies, who use any kind, either black or yellow,\r\nand who prefer themselves the cheaper kinds. But few varieties are\r\nused, and there seems to be but little taste manifested in the\r\nselection of the \"dust.\" Foreign varieties are used only to a limited\r\nextent, being chiefly confined to those of transatlantic birth and\r\ntastes. The custom of chewing and smoking seems to be more popular\r\nwith the male sex than snuff-taking, and one rarely finds a man\r\naddicted to the latter habit, unless it be one somewhat advanced in\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nStewart in his admirable paper on snuff gives much useful information\r\nin regard to the universal custom of using it as well as its origin\r\nand distinguished uses of the great sternutatory.\r\n\r\n     \"The luckless fate of inventors and originators has become\r\n     proverbial, but the ingenious individual whose nostrils\r\n     rejoiced in the first pinch of snuff stood in no need of the\r\n     niggardly praise of contemporaries or the lavish gratitude\r\n     of posterity. That first 'pinch' was its own priceless\r\n     reward, far above present appreciation or future fame. What\r\n     matters it, that his great name has not been reverently\r\n     handed down to us: that posterity seeks in vain his honored\r\n     tomb, on which to hang her grateful votive wreath; that\r\n     zealous antiquaries have raised up innumerable pretenders to\r\n     his unclaimed honors, and striven to rob him of his fame?\r\n     Enough for that lucky inventor, wherever he may rest, that\r\n     he enjoyed in his lifetime the reward for which ordinary\r\n     benefactors of their kind are fain to look to the future.\r\n\r\n     \"It is perfectly vain to attempt now to penetrate into the\r\n     mystery which envelopes the name and nation of the first\r\n     snuff-taker: long before rough, noble-hearted Drake cured\r\n     his dyspepsia by the use of tobacco, or Raleigh transplanted\r\n     some roots of that precious weed into English soil, there\r\n     were European noses which had rejoiced at its pulverized\r\n     leaves. Conjecture, lost in the mazy distance, gladly lays\r\n     hold of something substantial in the shape of snuff's first\r\n     royal patron. This was Catherine de Medicis, who, receiving\r\n     some seeds of the tobacco plant from a Dutch colony,\r\n     cherished them, and elevated the dried and pounded leaves\r\n     into a royal medicine, with the proud title of 'Herbe à la\r\n     Reine.' For in the beginning men took snuff, not as an\r\n     everyday luxury, but as a medicament. Like tea--which a\r\n     hundred years later was advertised as a cure for every\r\n     ill--the new sneezing powder was hailed a universal\r\n     specific; and so pleasant in its operation, that mankind,\r\n     acting upon the wholesome aphorism that prevention is much\r\n     better than cure, and eagerly anticipated the disease it was\r\n     supposed to remedy.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The use of 'the pungent grains of titillating dust'\r\n     received a somewhat heavy and discouraging blow from an\r\n     unexpected quarter. That ubiquitous power which hurled\r\n     anathemas alike at the heresies of Luther and the length of\r\n     clerical wigs, discountenanced its use, and at length fairly\r\n     lost its temper in the contest with snuff. Whether from a\r\n     prescience of the beneficial influence it was destined to\r\n     exert upon mankind, or from a suspicion of its power of\r\n     sharpening intellects, it is difficult to say; but Popes\r\n     Urban VIII., and Innocent waged quite a miniature crusade\r\n     against snuff, anathematizing those who should use it in\r\n     any church, and positively threatening with excommunication\r\n     all impious persons who should provoke a profane sneeze\r\n     within the sacred precincts of St. Peter's pile; Louis XIV.,\r\n     that good son of the Church, filially complied with the\r\n     paternal injunction, but his courtiers were less yielding;\r\n     and the ante-chamber of Versailles frequently resounded with\r\n     the effects of the pleasant stimulant.\r\n\r\n     \"All persecution has a distinct tendency to establish the\r\n     object of its hate, and so it was with the subject of our\r\n     article--it only required to be loved; and I do not doubt\r\n     that, had circumstances required them, snuff would have\r\n     found its martyrs. Its use was not general in England until\r\n     Charles II. introduced it, upon his return from exile, with\r\n     other important fashions. It had been known and used before,\r\n     as had the periwig, but it was not until his reign that it\r\n     became common. When the Stuarts relieved the country of\r\n     their presence for the second and last time, it had become\r\n     firmly established; and, by the days of good Queen Anne, was\r\n     such a necessary of life, that there were in the metropolis\r\n     alone no less than seven thousand shops where the\r\n     snuff-boxes of the Londoners could be replenished.\r\n\r\n     \"At that time, indeed, gallants were as proud of their\r\n     jewelled boxes of amber, porcelain, ebony and agate as they\r\n     were of their flowing wigs and clouded canes, the handles of\r\n     which were not unfrequently constructed to hold the\r\n     cherished dust. We are told by courtly Dick Steel, that a\r\n     handsome snuff-box was as much an essential of 'the fine\r\n     gentleman' as his gilt chariot, diamond ring, and brocade\r\n     sword-knot. We know them to have been manufactured of the\r\n     costliest material, heavy with gold and brilliant with\r\n     jewels, as they needed to be when their masters carried wigs\r\n     'high on the shoulder in a basket borne,' worth forty or\r\n     fifty guineas, and wore enough Flanders lace upon their\r\n     persons to have stocked a milliner's stall in New England.\r\n\r\n     \"Unfortunately, but very naturally, this extravagance\r\n     rendered snuff a butt for the wits (who all took it, by the\r\n     way), to shoot at. Steele, whose weakness for dress and show\r\n     were proverbial, levelled many of his blunt shafts at its\r\n     use; and Pope, who himself tells us 'of his wig all powder\r\n     and all snuff his band,' let fly one of his keener arrows at\r\n     the beaux, whose wit lay in their snuff-boxes and tweezer\r\n     cases. As the men laid by, in the Georgian era, much of the\r\n     magnificence of their attire, so their snuff-boxes became\r\n     plainer and decidedly uglier. Rushing into an opposite\r\n     extreme, the most outrageous receptacles for the precious\r\n     dust were devised. Boxes in the shape of bibles, boots,\r\n     shoes, toads, and coffins outraged public taste. The\r\n     strangest materials were used in their construction; the\r\n     public taste leaning towards relics possessing historical\r\n     interest. Thus the mulberry tree planted by Shakespeare, the\r\n     hull of the Royal George, in which 'brave Kempenfelt went\r\n     down, with twice four hundred men,' and the deck of the\r\n     Victory, on which Nelson died 'for England, home, and\r\n     beauty,' have alone been supposed to supply material for\r\n     snuff-boxes to an extent which, if known, must considerably\r\n     weaken the faith of their possessors in their genuineness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fancy snuff-boxes.]\r\n\r\n     \"Nor has snuff itself been less liable to the rule of\r\n     fashion than the boxes that held it. We will give a few\r\n     familiar instances. In the naval engagement of Viga, in\r\n     1703, when a large Spanish fleet was taken or destroyed, a\r\n     great quantity of musty snuff was made prize of, and\r\n     patriotism ran high enough to cause the 'town' for some\r\n     length of time to resist all that was not manufactured to\r\n     imitate the flavor from which it took its well-known name of\r\n     'musty.' Nearer to our own time, a large tobacco warehouse\r\n     having been destroyed by fire, in Dublin, a poor man\r\n     purchased some of the scorched or damaged stock, and\r\n     manufacturing it into coarse snuff, sold it to the poorer\r\n     class of snuff-takers. Forthwith capricious fashion adopted\r\n     it, endowing it with fabulous qualities, and Lundy Foot's\r\n     Irish Black-guard (so it was termed) filled the most\r\n     fashionable boxes.\r\n\r\n     \"Again, during the Peninsular campaigns, in which the light\r\n     division of the British army bore so memorable a part, the\r\n     mixture used by and called after its gallant leader, General\r\n     Sir. Amos Norcott, had a more extensive sale than any other.\r\n     When Napoleon was at Elba, and folks began to tire of\r\n     legitimacy, as they soon did, it became fashionable to use\r\n     snuff scented with the spirit of violet, and significantly\r\n     to allude to the perfume. Garrick, when he was manager of\r\n     Drury Lane Theatre, brought a mixture into fashion by using\r\n     or alluding to it in one of his most famous parts. The\r\n     tobacconist whom he thus favored was his under-treasurer,\r\n     Hardham, whom no writer about snuff should omit to notice.\r\n     He was a great favorite with Garrick, whom in his turn he\r\n     almost revered. One of Hardham's most important duties was\r\n     to number the house from a hole in the curtain above the\r\n     stage; and it is amusing to fancy the little tobacconist,\r\n     snuff-box in hand, calmly watching the pit fill, or from his\r\n     elevated position admiring the histrionic talents of his\r\n     gifted patron. His shop in Fleet street is also memorable.\r\n     It was the general resort of theatrical men and tyros, who\r\n     sought to reach the manager through his subordinates, and\r\n     his little back parlor witnessed the _début_ of many who\r\n     afterwards gained applause from larger, though not more\r\n     exacting audiences.\r\n\r\n     \"Her Majesty Queen Charlotte has bequeathed her name to a\r\n     once favorite mixture, and George the Fourth has some slight\r\n     chance of being remembered by the famous 'Prince's Mixture,'\r\n     which was so popular when it was the fashion to admire and\r\n     imitate that gifted individual. It would be a grateful but\r\n     almost an impossible task to enumerate the kings, soldiers,\r\n     lawyers, poets and actors who had sought from and found in\r\n     the snuff-box comfort and inspiration. Prominent among the\r\n     rulers of the earth who have acknowledged the pleasing\r\n     influence of snuff is Frederick the Great. His snuff-box was\r\n     the pocket of the long waistcoats of that period, in which\r\n     he kept large quantities loose--a dirty habit, which\r\n     Napoleon, who was a great plagiarist, adopted. It would be\r\n     easy to draw out a famous list of literary names attached to\r\n     snuff, beginning with Dryden, who was particular enough to\r\n     manufacture his own mixture, and selfish enough to preserve\r\n     the secret of its excellence, with a view, probably, of\r\n     enhancing the value of the pinch from his box, for which the\r\n     beaux and wits at Will's intrigued.\r\n\r\n     \"In the pulpit, at the bar, and on the stage, snuff has been\r\n     equally valuable in adding to the persuasive eloquence and\r\n     talent of its patrons. By the female portion of human-kind\r\n     it was at one time pretty generally taken, nor was it\r\n     uncommon for young and even pretty women to offer and accept\r\n     a pinch in public. After the gentle sex had to a great\r\n     extent given up the habit, some strong minded females were\r\n     to be found who retained it. Mrs. Siddons, when she came off\r\n     the stage after dying hard, as Desdemona, or harrowing the\r\n     hearts of her audience by her representation of Jane Shore,\r\n     could composedly ask those around for a pinch of the\r\n     precious restorative. When we consider the beneficial\r\n     influence which snuff has exerted over mankind generally, we\r\n     cannot help regretting that its virtues were not sooner\r\n     known.\r\n\r\n     \"For we put forth the proposition seriously, that its effect\r\n     upon the world has been to render it more humane and\r\n     even-tempered, and that had the western hemisphere\r\n     discovered the tobacco plant earlier, historians would have\r\n     had more pleasant events to chronicle. For instance, it is\r\n     not impossible--nay, most probable--that the fate of Rome,\r\n     discussed by the Triumvirate over their snuff-boxes, would\r\n     have been different. Is it likely that, under the humanizing\r\n     influence of mutual pinches, Antony would have asked for, or\r\n     Augustus resigned, the head of Cicero to his bloodthirsty\r\n     colleague; or that the other details of the conscription\r\n     which deluged the streets of Rome with the blood of her best\r\n     citizens, would have been agreed to? Again, can any one\r\n     imagine Charles the Ninth and his evil counsellors plotting\r\n     the massacre of St. Bartholomew over pinches of the soothing\r\n     dust? Is it probable that the High Court of Justiciary would\r\n     have entitled its royal martyr to a special service in the\r\n     Book of Common Prayer, if its deliberation had been inspired\r\n     by the kindly snuff which since that time has so often\r\n     softened the rigor of the law? My hypothesis may seem an\r\n     absurd one, but history supports it.\r\n\r\n     \"When Charles the Second introduced snuff into general use,\r\n     men's hands had scarcely adapted themselves to more\r\n     peaceable occupations than cutting their neighbors' throats,\r\n     and the ashes of a long and bitter civil war needed little\r\n     fanning to break into a blaze again; and yet, for forty\r\n     years of misgovernment the nation kept its temper. How can\r\n     this forbearance be accounted for? Was it that circumstances\r\n     no longer called for as stern and as effectual remedies as\r\n     before? No. Was the second Charles one whit more desirable\r\n     than the first of that ilk? Was Clarendon more liked than\r\n     Stafford? Was Russell's head of less consequence than\r\n     Prynne's ears? No. Again, wrongs as grievous as those which\r\n     Hampden had died in resisting were to be avenged, but in a\r\n     milder, better fashion; for mankind had in the meantime\r\n     learned to take snuff. Much of the haste and irritation\r\n     which had previously led to blows discharged itself in a\r\n     good-natured sneeze. Snuff made men forbearing, even jocular\r\n     over their wrongs. Who can doubt that the revolution which\r\n     ended in placing William of Orange on his father-in-law's\r\n     throne owed its bloodless character not a little to the\r\n     influence of snuff. We read of difficulties in its course,\r\n     which, fifty years previously, would inevitably have led to\r\n     bloodshed, being easily, almost humorously surmounted. The\r\n     plagued nation effected a revolution over its snuff-boxes in\r\n     the happiest conceivable manner.\r\n\r\n     \"Having ventured so far I am inclined to put forward a yet\r\n     higher claim which snuff has upon our gratitude, and to hint\r\n     that the great deeds of great men who were snuff-takers may\r\n     be traced by a chain of reasoning--slight, yet\r\n     conclusive--to this dearly prized luxury. The hackneyed\r\n     saying that time is money, or money's worth, has more truth\r\n     in it than most of the fallacies which are supposed to\r\n     regulate our conduct. The most important events of our lives\r\n     often hinge on moments. A moment to stifle passion, to\r\n     summon reflection, to plunge into the past and bring up a\r\n     buried memory, to consider results, is often of the utmost\r\n     consequence, and this valued moment the pinch of snuff\r\n     insures, when, without it, delay would be simply\r\n     embarrassment. The pinch of snuff, taken at the right\r\n     instant, secures an important reprieve, during which the\r\n     unpleasant question may be evaded, the hasty reply\r\n     reconsidered, or an angry _repartee_ thought better of,\r\n     while the same time gained serves to improve the\r\n     diplomatist's _equivoque_, to point the orator's satire, and\r\n     polish the wit's _mot_. In a word, its use on important\r\n     occasions affords, to every one who needs them, better means\r\n     of acting upon Talleyrand's mischievous yet clever\r\n     aphorism--that language is useful rather to conceal than to\r\n     express our thoughts. Moreover, the action necessary in\r\n     conveying the tempting graces to their destination has not\r\n     unfrequently been found useful. It employs the hasty hand\r\n     that may itch to take illegal vengeance for fancied insults;\r\n     it serves to hide the angry twitching mouth and passionately\r\n     expanding nostrils, to give a natural expression to changes\r\n     of the countenance which would otherwise indicate emotion,\r\n     and to parry attention till reason has been summoned to\r\n     supplant passion.\r\n\r\n     \"It is denied (in a rather irritating way sometimes) that\r\n     the subject of our article has any beneficial influence upon\r\n     the intellects of its patrons. We are not about to claim for\r\n     it any such exalted qualities, but we may be allowed to\r\n     mention a fact or so which entitles it to some respect\r\n     medicinally. As we have before stated, in its early days it\r\n     was considered to possess powerful healing qualities, and\r\n     even now is found of use in cases of headache and weak\r\n     sight. It was also supposed valuable in cases of heaviness\r\n     and obtuseness of intellect. Is it, therefore unreasonable\r\n     to presume that it may have had some share in gaining for\r\n     our brethren beyond the Tweed that shrewdness of national\r\n     character which has become proverbial?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Curing a headache.]\r\n\r\n     \"The specimens which came in the reign of James I.,\r\n     southward, did not command much respect or admiration from\r\n     our countrymen; indeed they were the bulls at which every\r\n     satirist hurled his shafts, and blunt must have been that\r\n     one which did not pierce some potent folly of language or\r\n     manner. The town rang with anecdotes of their rags, beggary,\r\n     and quarrels; ballad-singers made merry at their expense,\r\n     and the stage resounded with uncomplimentary allusions.\r\n     Indeed, in one of the most popular plays of that period, the\r\n     king himself was not spared, and the actors (Ben Jonson\r\n     among them) had very nearly lost their ears for their\r\n     boldness. Nor was it at least for a hundred and fifty years\r\n     after this period that the Scotch became noted for that\r\n     enterprise and talent which now distinguish them.\r\n\r\n     \"We do not deny that the union may have developed their\r\n     traits, but it is clear that within that time snuff had\r\n     become a national stimulant. To the observer of men and\r\n     manners there is something very characteristic in the\r\n     various fashions in which the pinch of snuff is taken. 'The\r\n     exercise of the snuff-box,' as it was once termed, was an\r\n     acknowledged science, but few were the great proficients who\r\n     could mutely express their feelings by its aid. We have not\r\n     space to run through all its exercise, but we may mention\r\n     the 'pinch military,' which Frederick, and after him,\r\n     Napoleon practiced inhaling snuff copiously, and with much\r\n     waste, as though it were human life they were throwing away;\r\n     the 'pinch malicious,' of which Pope was perfect master; the\r\n     'pinch dictatorial,' which burly Jonson established; the\r\n     'pinch sublimely contemptuous,' such as Reynolds took when\r\n     some travelling virtuoso hinted at excellence away from\r\n     Leicester-square, and ruffled his complacent vanity; and,\r\n     above all, the 'pinch polite,' which Talleyrand understood\r\n     so well.\r\n\r\n     \"From snuff to sneezing is but a step, which we purpose\r\n     taking before we bring this cursory article to a close. The\r\n     act of sneezing appears to have been variously regarded at\r\n     various stages of the world's history, but from the earliest\r\n     times of which we have any authentic record, it has been the\r\n     customs of those around to give vent to a short benediction\r\n     immediately upon its commission. The Robbins considering\r\n     themselves bound to find a reason for this universal custom,\r\n     and being hard pressed, gave the somewhat incomprehensible\r\n     explanation that, previous to Jacob, man sneezed but once in\r\n     his lifetime, and then immediately before death; so that\r\n     those around, warned of his imminent journey, hastened to\r\n     wish it a good termination. How it was that Jacob instituted\r\n     a new order of things we are not told, but as a proof of the\r\n     truth of their assertion they give the fact that in all\r\n     nations of the earth a similar custom will be found\r\n     existing.\r\n\r\n     \"Strangely enough this assertion was corroborated by the\r\n     first colonists of America, who found the habit to be in\r\n     common use amongst the aboriginal tribes. The Greeks and\r\n     Romans certainly had a similar habit, but far from attaching\r\n     any ill-omen to the sneeze they regarded it as of good\r\n     augury. Thus Catullus assures us that when Cupid upon a\r\n     memorable occasion sneezed, all:\r\n\r\n          'The little loves that waited by\r\n           Bowed and blessed the augury.\r\n\r\n     And in the 'Life of Themistocles,' Plutarch informs his\r\n     readers that sneezing by the General on the eve of a battle\r\n     was regarded as a certain sign of conquest. Strangely enough\r\n     we find that in comparatively modern times, the custom of\r\n     giving expression to good wishes when a friend sneezed was\r\n     attributed to the fearful plague which periodically swept\r\n     over Europe. Sneezing was one of its first and most\r\n     dangerous symptoms, and those who were by, as they gathered\r\n     their robes about them and fled from their doomed\r\n     fellow-creature, would ejaculate a quick 'God bless you,'\r\n     hurriedly invoking from a more merciful quarter the aid they\r\n     feared to give. Violent sneezing was not only among the\r\n     first, but was one of the last fatal signs of that fearful\r\n     scourge, and was often too rapidly followed by death to give\r\n     time for more than a short benediction. Anyhow, the custom\r\n     still exists and one of the most pleasant reminiscences\r\n     attached to the first pinch of snuff is the chorus of hearty\r\n     good wishes of sympathizing friends which follows upon the\r\n     inevitable sneeze.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Highlanders.]\r\n\r\nThe variety of taste in snuff is accounted for by the proverb, \"So\r\nmany men to so many noses.\" Highland gentlemen of every degree are\r\nmostly fond of Gillespie; while operatives from the Lowlands generally\r\nprefer plain Scotch. When two Highlanders meet, they usually exchange\r\na pinch of snuff, mutually _preeing_ the contents of their _mulls_,\r\nwhile their _colleys_, (dogs) after a fashion of their own, take a\r\nreciprocal _sniff_ of each other. Cuba is the favorite of the\r\ngentlemen of the stock exchange; the tradesman's box usually contains\r\nrappee; high dried Irish is grateful to those who love to feel the\r\ntaste of snuff in their throat. Sea-faring men seldom take snuff: a\r\nsailor with a snuff-box is as rarely to be met with as a sailor\r\nwithout a knife.\r\n\r\nThe history of the rise and progress of snuff-taking abounds in\r\nincidents and anecdotes, among the most curious of all that relate to\r\nthe various modes of using the weed. Though once the most popular and\r\nfashionable manner of using tobacco it now falls far behind the other\r\nand more common and more popular forms of indulging in the herb. In\r\nFrance and Spain the introduction of tobacco ushered in this form of\r\nusing it, and to inhale a few grains of the pungent dust was the\r\ndelight of polished and favored courtiers who regardless of the forms\r\nroyalty patronized and gave sanction to the custom. Thus its use in a\r\nshort time became popular all over Europe and gave unlimited scope for\r\nthe satirist and dramatist to ridicule the habit. In spite, however,\r\nof frown and ridicule this ancient custom though not now as popular or\r\nas fashionable, still claims many sincere votaries and doubtless will\r\nas long as the plant is cultivated or used in any form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCIGARS.\r\n\r\n  \"The poet may sing of the leaf of the rose,\r\n  And call it the purest and sweetest that blows;\r\n  But of all the leaves that ever were tried,\r\n  Give me the tobacco leaf rolled up and dried.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe smoking of cigars is now considered the best as it is the most\r\nfashionable mode of using the weed. The word cigar is from the Spanish\r\n_cigarro_, and signifies a cylindrical roll of tobacco leaves, made of\r\nshort pieces or shreds of the leaves divested of the stem and wound\r\nabout with a binder, and enveloped in a portion of the leaf known by\r\nthe name of wrapper--acute at one end and truncated at the other. In\r\nthe East Indies a sort of cigar called _cheroot_ is also made with\r\nboth ends truncated. The smoking of tobacco in the form of cigars is\r\ndoubtless the most general as well as the most ancient mode of its\r\nuse. When Columbus landed in Hispaniola, the sailors saw the natives\r\nsmoking the leaves of a plant, \"the perfume of which was fragrant and\r\ngrateful.\" But while cigars are of very ancient origin in the West\r\nIndies, they were not generally known in Europe until the beginning of\r\nthe Nineteenth Century. In fact, of all the various works on\r\ngastronomy and the pleasures of the table, written and published from\r\n1800 to 1815, not one speaks of this now indispensable adjunct of a\r\ngood dinner. Even Britlat-Savarin, in his _Physiologie du Gout_,\r\nentirely ignores tobacco and all its distractions and charms. Benzo\r\ngives the following account of the manufacture of a cigar in\r\nHispaniola:--\r\n\r\n     \"They take a leafe from the stalks of their great bastard\r\n     corn (which we commonly called Turkie--wheat) together with\r\n     one of these tobacco-leaves and fold them up together like a\r\n     coffin of paper, such as grocers make to put spices in, or\r\n     like a small organ-pipe. Then putting one end of the same\r\n     coffin to the fire, and holding the other end in their\r\n     mouths, they draw their breath to them. When the fire hath\r\n     once taken at the pipe's end, they draw forth so much smoke\r\n     that they have their mouth, nose, throat, and head full of\r\n     it; and, as if they tooke a singular delight therein they\r\n     never leave supping and drinking till they can sup no more,\r\n     and thereby loose their breath and their feeling.\"\r\n\r\nSahagun, in his \"History of New Spain,\" speaks of the natives as using\r\nthe leaves of tobacco rolled into cigars, which they ignite and smoke\r\nin tubes of tortoise-shell or silver. The following article from the\r\n_New York Times_ contains much valuable information in regard to\r\ncigars, especially Havanas:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cigars.]\r\n\r\n     \"It is perfectly safe to say that there is more money spent\r\n     every day in New York for cigars than for bread,\" (doubted.)\r\n     \"From the fine gentlemen, who buy their cigars at\r\n     Delmonico's, or get them direct from the importers, down to\r\n     the little barefoot boys in the streets, who buy theirs from\r\n     the Chinamen at the corners or pick up the stumps that are\r\n     thrown away, all smoke. In some countries pipes and\r\n     cigarettes are made to do duty by the poorer classes, but in\r\n     New York cigars seem to be almost invariably preferred. Now,\r\n     while there is nothing better, in the way of something to\r\n     smoke, than a first-class Havana cigar, there is nothing\r\n     nastier than some of the cheap abominations made in that\r\n     shape in New York. To the truth of this last proposition,\r\n     anyone will readily testify who has ever been so unfortunate\r\n     as to have had to ride from Harlem to New York in a late\r\n     smoking-car, with half a dozen roughs smoking cheap cigars\r\n     on board.\r\n\r\n     \"The cigars sold in this market may be divided into three\r\n     classes--the imported, those made of imported tobacco, and\r\n     those made of domestic tobacco. These may be again\r\n     classified under many different heads, as there are many\r\n     kinds and grades of each. The cheapest cigars in New York\r\n     are dispensed by dilapidated Chinamen, who have little\r\n     stands about the streets and markets. These are certainly\r\n     the vilest cigars made anywhere in the world, and are sold\r\n     from one to five cents each. Next in order come the common\r\n     domestic cigars. They are sold at five cents each, or six\r\n     for twenty-five cents, and are of the kind kept at the cheap\r\n     refreshment stalls, lager beer saloons, and low groggeries.\r\n     After these are the more pretentious home-made cigars,\r\n     manufactured of selected domestic tobacco, which are sold\r\n     all over the city, and in the making of which Havana\r\n     'fillers' are supposed to be used. A filler, be it known, in\r\n     technical parlance means that portion of the tobacco of\r\n     which the inside of the cigar is made. Price, ten to fifteen\r\n     cents. Then comes the best class of cigars in which domestic\r\n     tobacco is used, those which are made with clear Havana\r\n     fillers and Connecticut wrappers. Fifteen cents is the\r\n     price, and many are palmed off on the unwise for the real\r\n     imported article. Cigars made wholly of imported Cuban\r\n     tobacco come next on the list. Some of them are excellent,\r\n     and compare favorably with many of the imported. They bring\r\n     from fifteen to fifty cents each at the cigar stores. Last\r\n     in line, but best of all, is the genuine, imported Havana\r\n     cigar. Few and rare are they, and great is the price of the\r\n     higher grades thereof.\r\n\r\n     \"There are some places in New York where an imported cigar\r\n     of a reasonable size may be bought for fifteen cents, but\r\n     they are few and far between. Twenty or twenty-five cents is\r\n     the price usually charged, and from that to a dollar. All\r\n     the cigars made in the United States are invariably put up\r\n     in imitation Havana boxes, with imitation Havana labels and\r\n     brands. It is doubtful, however, whether this transparent\r\n     device deceives anybody, for in accordance with the United\r\n     States Internal Revenue laws, all boxes of cigars\r\n     manufactured in the United States must not only bear the\r\n     manufacturer's label, giving his full name and place of\r\n     business, and the number of his manufactory, but they must\r\n     also bear the United States inspector's brand. Before the\r\n     present law was in force, and the duties on tobacco were\r\n     low, this scheme may have been profitable. But why the\r\n     practice is still adhered to by the manufacturers is hard to\r\n     imagine, for the boxes now used, being made of imported\r\n     cedar, must be very costly, and must materially increase the\r\n     price of cigars. Only those of the very poorest quality are\r\n     packed in white wooden boxes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cigar-holders.]\r\n\r\n     \"Some people seem to smoke not because they like it, but\r\n     only to be in the fashion. Some days ago the writer of this\r\n     article happened to be in a cigar-store, when two\r\n     well-dressed young men came in and asked for some ten cent\r\n     cigars. The clerk handed out the box, and after a critical\r\n     inspection the purchaser asked: \"Are these medium?' 'Yes,\r\n     sir,' said the clerk. 'Then I'll take a dollar's worth.'\r\n     After they had gone the writer asked the clerk what they\r\n     meant by 'medium.' He said he didn't exactly know, but\r\n     supposed they wanted to know whether the cigars were between\r\n     strong and mild. 'I told them they were,' said he, 'because\r\n     I thought they would buy if I said so, but they are all\r\n     alike.' And in this connection it is very singular that\r\n     although the Island of Cuba is so near to the United States\r\n     and so many cigars are imported into this city, so little is\r\n     known about the different sizes and brands of cigars,\r\n     excepting, of course, by those in the business. It is a\r\n     common thing here to see a man ask in a cigar store for a\r\n     _Flor del Fumar_, a _Figaro_, or an _Espanola_. By this he\r\n     means a cigar of a certain size, and does not seem to know\r\n     that these are not the names which designate the size, but\r\n     are the names of the manufactories. In Havana, were a man to\r\n     ask for a _Flor del Fumar_, the dealer would ask him what\r\n     size he wanted.\r\n\r\n     \"Every box of cigars packed in Havana has, at least, six\r\n     distinctive works on it. First is the brand, which is burned\r\n     in the upper side of the lid of the box, with an iron made\r\n     for the purpose; second the label, this bears the name and\r\n     address of the manufactory; third, the mark designating the\r\n     size and shape of the cigars, this is usually put on with a\r\n     stencil; there are not so very many regular sizes, or\r\n     _vitolas_, made in Havana as might be imagined, a list of\r\n     them may prove interesting. These are: Damos, Entre Actos,\r\n     Opera, Concha, Regalia de Concha, Londres, Londres de Corte,\r\n     Regalia de Londres, Regalia Britanica, Regalia del Rey,\r\n     Regalia de la Reina, Reina Victoria, Panetelos, Trabucos,\r\n     Embajadores, Especiales, Imperiales, Brevos, Prensados,\r\n     Cilindrados, Millar Vegueros. The _Damos_ (Dames) as their\r\n     name indicates, are meant for the ladies, and are the\r\n     smallest made. The _Cozadores_ (huntsmen) are the longest,\r\n     and the _Trabucos_ (blunderbusses) the fattest. The\r\n     _Prensados_ (pressed) are flat, and _Cilindrados_\r\n     (cylindrical) are so called because, when green, they are\r\n     put in bundles of twenty-five, and tightly rolled in strong\r\n     tissue paper, which is twisted at each end of the roll. When\r\n     the cigars are dry the paper is taken off, and the bunch\r\n     retains the cylindrical shape given it. The _Brevos_ (figs)\r\n     are also tied up while green, and tightly pressed. This\r\n     makes them stick together something like figs, hence their\r\n     name. The _Vegueros_ (plantation) take their name from the\r\n     fact that they are supposed to be made like those made on\r\n     the plantations, but they are not made in the same way.\r\n\r\n     \"In the _Vegos_ (plantations) the _veguero_, or planter,\r\n     makes his cigar of a single leaf of tobacco, which he\r\n     carries ready moistened for the purpose, by rolling it on\r\n     his knee. Besides the above, some fancy sizes have been\r\n     adopted of late years, but they are made by only a few of\r\n     the larger manufacturers in Havana. Fourth is the color\r\n     mark, which is also put on in stencil. Fifth, the class\r\n     mark. All the round cigars made in Havana are separated into\r\n     three classes: _Primera_, or first; _Segunda_, or second;\r\n     and _Tercera_, or third. Some manufacturers never mark any\r\n     of their cigars as of the third class, not because they do\r\n     not make them, but because they think they sell better\r\n     without the mark. They make the first class _Flor_, the\r\n     second _Primera_, and the third _Segunda_. Others mark all\r\n     their cigars as of the first class, and indicate the classes\r\n     by the color of the labels, and in this way none but the\r\n     wholesale purchaser knows the secret. Sixth, the last, is\r\n     the mark denoting the number of cigars in the box. This is\r\n     stenciled on the side in Arabic numerals.\r\n\r\n     \"A theory has obtained that cigars made in Havana, by reason\r\n     of some inexplicable climatic influence, are better than\r\n     those made in New York, even should they be made of tobacco\r\n     from the same plantation. This may be so, but it is doubtful\r\n     whether this was ever fairly tested, or, indeed, whether it\r\n     was ever tested at all. The truth is that all the best\r\n     tobacco grown in the island of Cuba is bought up by the\r\n     heavy manufacturers in Havana. The crops of the best\r\n     plantations are contracted for in advance, and the\r\n     old-established firms buy from the same _vegos_ year after\r\n     year. Hence it is why their cigars are so uniform in\r\n     quality. All Cuban tobacco is not good, by any means. The\r\n     tobacco from the Vuelta de Arriba is not so good as that\r\n     from the Vuelta de Abajo, and yet there is but little\r\n     difference in their geographical position. And in the Vuelta\r\n     de Abajo, a short distance makes a difference in the quality\r\n     of the tobacco. Some _vegos_ are celebrated for their good\r\n     crops, while others, perhaps not a hundred yards away, do\r\n     not produce good crops at all. There are many poor cigars\r\n     made in Cuba, as all who have ever been there know, and all\r\n     over the island the Havana cigar is deemed the best. In\r\n     Havana, and, indeed, in all parts of the island, green or\r\n     freshly-made cigars are preferred, and the most esteemed\r\n     cigar-cases are made of carefully prepared bladders, in\r\n     which the cigars are rolled to prevent the evaporation of\r\n     the moisture.\r\n\r\n     \"When a Cuban gentleman gives a cigar to a friend, he does\r\n     not, as we do, open his case, and offer it to him to choose\r\n     from but he examines its contents carefully and critically,\r\n     selects the one he thinks the best and offers it. And there\r\n     is a great deal more in the choice of a cigar, by selecting\r\n     it on account of its outside appearance, than one not\r\n     accustomed to it would suppose. A wrapper which has that\r\n     which the Cubans call _calidad_ makes the cigar much\r\n     stronger than one which does not possess it. That is to say,\r\n     that the wrapper which has _calidad_ contains more essential\r\n     oil, is denoted by an abundance of small pustules on the\r\n     surface of the leaf, and by a general rich, oily appearance.\r\n     As a proof of the foregoing proposition, it is only\r\n     necessary to know how cigars are made. A lot of tobacco is\r\n     worked up into say 50,000. After they are all made, they are\r\n     turned over to be assorted, according to color and class,\r\n     and are packed and marked. The fillers are all alike, it is\r\n     the wrappers that make the difference. To assort the colors\r\n     a very, correct eye is required, and those who do this part\r\n     of the work make better wages than those who make the\r\n     cigars.\r\n\r\n     \"The value of cigars does not increase in direct ratio with\r\n     their size, for owing to the difficulty in getting good\r\n     wrappers for the larger kinds, the expense of their\r\n     manufacture is much increased. Upon one occasion, in Havana,\r\n     a manufacturer received an order for a thousand cigars\r\n     intended for the Queen of Spain's husband, Don Francisco de\r\n     Asis, which he agreed to make for $1,000. They were\r\n     delivered in due time, and packed in a richly-mounted cedar\r\n     chest, were sent to the royal recipient. They were\r\n     magnificent cigars, of the cazadores size, all of the same\r\n     color, and so smoothly made as to look as if they had been\r\n     turned out of hard wood instead of rolled tobacco. They were\r\n     placed on exhibition for a few days before they were sent to\r\n     Spain, and a gentleman who saw them, wishing to make a\r\n     present to some dignitary, asked the manufacturer to make\r\n     him a like number at the same price. To his surprise, the\r\n     order was refused. The manufacturer said he could not do it\r\n     for the money. His explanation was that it was not the\r\n     actual cost of the tobacco and labor of making them, but it\r\n     was on account of the trouble and expense met with in\r\n     selecting the wrappers. He said he had to pick over\r\n     thousands of bales before he could secure a sufficient\r\n     number of the proper length, color, and fineness.\r\n\r\n     \"Some two years ago there was a story of a Cuban\r\n     cigar-dealer in Broadway, who selected cigars for his more\r\n     favored customers by ear. It was said that he put the cigar\r\n     to his ear, and listened intently for a moment, and by the\r\n     cracking of the tobacco was enabled to judge of its quality.\r\n     This was a good advertising dodge, but in practice it was\r\n     all nonsense. None but that wily Cuban ever heard of such a\r\n     mode of trying a cigar. In the Island of Cuba that which we\r\n     call a cigar is called a _tabaco_ (a tobacco) and when it is\r\n     required to discriminate between the manufactured and\r\n     unmanufactured article it is called _tabaco torcido_, or\r\n     rolled tobacco. This, however, is only necessary when used\r\n     in the plural. In Mexico a cigar is called a _puro_, and in\r\n     Peru[62] and some of the other Spanish American countries it\r\n     is called a _cigarro puro_, in contradistinction to the\r\n     _cigarro de papel_, or cigarette. Cigarettes in Cuba are\r\n     called _cigarros_, and their consumption is enormous.\r\n     Strange as it may appear, there are some confirmed smokers\r\n     in Cuba who never use cigars at all, but confine themselves\r\n     to cigarettes. To the New Yorker it looks curious to see a\r\n     great, bearded man smoking a tiny cigarette; and, indeed\r\n     were he to smoke his cigarette as the New Yorker would smoke\r\n     his cigar, it would be labor lost, so far as getting any\r\n     effect of the tobacco was concerned. But the cigarette\r\n     smoker inhales the greater part of the smoke, it goes\r\n     directly into his lungs, and into contact with a large\r\n     surface of mucous membrane, and, indeed, with the blood\r\n     itself. Were the New York cigar-makers to smoke a cigarette\r\n     in the same way it would make him so giddy that he would be\r\n     compelled to give it up long before it was consumed. That\r\n     the smoke does go into the lungs is proved by the fact that\r\n     a cigarette smoker can inhale the smoke and exhale it again\r\n     after drinking a glass of water.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 62: Ballaert says that the consumption of\r\n              cigars in Peru is enormous. \"An old fisherman on being\r\n              asked how he amused himself when not at his labors\r\n              replied, 'Why I smoke; and as I have consumed 40 paper\r\n              cigars a day for the last 50 years, which cost me one\r\n              rial each will you have the goodness to tell me how many\r\n              I have smoked, and how much I have expended for\r\n              tobacco?'\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Life in Mexico.]\r\n\r\nAll tobacco grown upon the island of Cuba is not of the finest\r\nquality; the majority of it is far inferior to the best Mexican coast\r\ntobacco. The value of the tobacco lands of this last mentioned country\r\nhas not been fully developed. The variety of soil, exposure, climate,\r\nand atmospheric influences are greater than can possibly be in Cuba,\r\nand when the best is discovered, combining all the requisites, which\r\nundoubtedly will be the case with an increased culture of the plant,\r\nit will be found to be equal to the Vuelta Abogo of Cuba, and much\r\nmore extensive. The subject of tobacco lands, evidently, is not well\r\nunderstood in Mexico, as it must be, from great experience, in Cuba.\r\nAll of these varieties of lands and circumstances exist in Mexico, and\r\nit is safe to predict that, at some day, this country will stand\r\npre-eminent over all others in this industry.\r\n\r\nWe extract the following from the _Tobacco Leaf_ in regard to\r\ncigar-making in Cuba:--\r\n\r\n     \"The rule is that a cigar-maker devotes all his ingenuity\r\n     and diligence to one class of goods. For example, one\r\n     workman makes only _Londres_; another only _Regalias_;\r\n     another only _Milores Communes_; and so on. In the Cuban's\r\n     factory the operatives are allowed to smoke as many cigars\r\n     as they like when at work; and to take home with them, when\r\n     they leave work in the evening, five cigars each. The\r\n     immigration of Chinese laborers into Cuba has modified, and\r\n     must further modify, the labor market there. In the\r\n     cigarette factories at Havana, Chinese workmen are almost\r\n     exclusively employed. Though objectionable for many of their\r\n     moral habits, these workmen are nevertheless docile,\r\n     ingenious, laborious, and contented.\"\r\n\r\nA writer, alluding to the manufacture of cigars, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The colors or strengths are _Amarillo Claro_, bright\r\n     yellow; _Amarillo Obscuro_, dark yellow; _Claro_, bright;\r\n     _Colorado Claro_, bright red; _Colorado_, red; _Colorado\r\n     Obscuro_, dark red; _Colorado Maduro_, red-ripe or mellow;\r\n     _Maduro_, ripe or mellow; _Maduro Obscuro_, dark ripe or\r\n     mellow; _Pajizo Claro_, bright straw-colored; _Pajizo_,\r\n     straw-colored; _Pajizo Obscuro_, dark straw-colored;\r\n     _Fuerte_, strong or heavy; _Entre Fuerte_, rather strong or\r\n     heavy; _Flajo_, light. Then there are the indications of the\r\n     qualities:--Superfine; _Firo_, not quite so fine; _Flor_,\r\n     finest or firsts; _Superior_, next, or seconds; _Buenos_,\r\n     next, or thirds. The cigar has a notable history. First has\r\n     to be determined the part of the plant from which it is\r\n     taken; then the part of the leaf from which it is taken, the\r\n     tobacco being best which is furthest away from the root or\r\n     middle of the leaf. One elaborate process follows another\r\n     for the perfection of a work of art--for as such we must\r\n     regard a cigar.\"\r\n\r\nHazard, in his admirable work on Cuba, devotes considerable space to\r\ncigars, their manufacture, varieties, and use, in which he speaks of\r\nthe various brands as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"The brands known as '_Yara Mayau_,' and the '_Guisa_,' are\r\n     perhaps the most celebrated made upon the Island. Of the\r\n     '_Yara_,' which has some considerable reputation,\r\n     particularly in the London market, I confess I cannot speak\r\n     favorably. Cigars that I smoked made from this leaf, and\r\n     which are much smoked in the vicinity of Santiago de Cuba, I\r\n     found had a peculiar saline taste which was very unpleasant,\r\n     as also a slight degree of bitterness; many smokers,\r\n     however, become very fond of this flavor. When I state that\r\n     in Havana alone there are over one hundred and twenty-five\r\n     manufacturers of cigars, it will readily be understood there\r\n     must be a great many inferior cigars made even in Cuba.\r\n     Havana may be called the 'City of cigars,' from its\r\n     reputation and the immense number of factories there are in\r\n     it for the manufacture of cigars, from the smallest shop\r\n     opening on the street, employing three or four hands to the\r\n     immense _fabricos_ erected expressly for this purpose, and\r\n     employing five or six hundred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cuban cigar shop.]\r\n\r\n     \"Let not any one imagine, then, that because he is in Havana\r\n     he will get no poor cigars, for a greater mistake can not be\r\n     made, for just as vile trash can there be purchased as any\r\n     where; and it appeared to me that in buying, from time to\r\n     time in different _fabricos_, a few cigars it was rarely I\r\n     found a really good one. It behooves, then, every lover of a\r\n     good cigar to make himself familiar with the best makers and\r\n     brands, and to purchase those, and those only, that suit\r\n     his taste. To the traveler in Havana, this is easy enough,\r\n     as he can there buy sample boxes from any of the factories\r\n     and of any of the brands. There are, in addition to these\r\n     hundreds of other cigar factories, some of which, such as\r\n     _Cabargos_, _Figaros_, _Luetanos_, _Victorias_, etc., are\r\n     first-class, three or four at least in whose cigars every\r\n     smoker may have perfect confidence, the brands of which are\r\n     known all over the world. These are: _Cabaños_, _Uppmann_\r\n     and _Partagas_; for whose brands, perhaps, one pays\r\n     something more, but has always the satisfaction of finding\r\n     them good. To the kindness of the gentlemen connected with\r\n     some of these factories I am indebted for most of the\r\n     information in this article, and particularly to Señor Don\r\n     Avulmo G. del Valle, the present proprietor of the Cabaños\r\n     Factory, who was good enough to show me through his\r\n     establishment, carefully explaining to me its peculiarities.\r\n     As the process of manufacture and description of grades and\r\n     qualities are the same with all the best makers, I give here\r\n     a detailed history of this factory and its products.\r\n\r\n     \"The factory for Cabaños cigars has been established\r\n     seventy-two years the founder of it being Don Francisco\r\n     Cabaños, his son, Don de P. Cabaños, succeeding him, to whom\r\n     has succeeded his son-in-law, Señor del Valle, the present\r\n     proprietor and director of the factory. When it was founded,\r\n     the cigars were sold to the public in bundles of twenty,\r\n     only amounting to a total number per year, of four or five\r\n     hundred thousand cigars, the sales of which kept constantly\r\n     increasing until 1826, when there were sold two millions. At\r\n     this period the demand for exportation commenced, increasing\r\n     each year until 1848, when the number sold amounted to three\r\n     and a half millions. At this time, the present director came\r\n     in charge, and increased the sale to eight millions per\r\n     year, until, in 1866, the total sales by this one house\r\n     only, amounted to the enormous number of sixteen million\r\n     cigars, which went to different parts of the world. The\r\n     tobacco manipulated in this factory is, with some few\r\n     exceptions, that grown upon plantations in the Vuelta Abojo,\r\n     with the proprietors of which Señor del Valle has a special\r\n     contract for their product. The most noted of these places\r\n     are known as '_La Lena_,' '_San Juan aj Martin_,' '_Los\r\n     Pilotos_,' '_Rio Hondo_.' The firm also own three _vegas_,\r\n     as do also Partagas, Uppmann, and others, in a greater or\r\n     less degree. The amount raised upon these _vegas_ in\r\n     connection with the Cabaños Factory, amounts to five\r\n     thousand bales, of from first to eighth quality, leaving\r\n     the most inferior qualities, which amount to about one\r\n     thousand bales, for exportation, the factory not using such\r\n     common grades. It is a custom of the manufacturers to keep a\r\n     supply of the best qualities always on hand from year to\r\n     year, in order that, should the tobacco crop, in any one\r\n     year, be bad, the reputation of the house can be maintained\r\n     by using the good tobacco in the store. The factory is a\r\n     large stone building, opposite the Canipo de Moste, in which\r\n     all the operations connected with cigar making are carried\r\n     on (excepting the manufacture of boxes) by over five hundred\r\n     operatives, all males. The following is the process of\r\n     manufacture:\r\n\r\n     \"Arrived at the factory, the tobacco bales, carefully packed\r\n     and wrapped in palm leaves, are kept in a cool, dark, place\r\n     on the first floor, being divided off into classes according\r\n     to quality and value, which latter varies from twenty to\r\n     four hundred dollars per bale of two hundred pounds. When\r\n     wanted, the bales are opened, the _manojas_ and _gabillos_\r\n     are separated, and the latter carried in their dry state to\r\n     the moistening room. Here are a number of men whose business\r\n     it is to place the leaves, for the purpose of moistening and\r\n     softening them, into large barrels in which is a solution of\r\n     saltpetre in water; this done, the water is poured off, and\r\n     other workmen spread out the leaves with their hands upon\r\n     the edges of the barrels, ridding them as much as possible,\r\n     of any surplus water; after which, the leaves, from being\r\n     moistened, unfold very easily, and, with care, without\r\n     tearing. The stem is then taken out, the process being known\r\n     as _disbalillar_. These stems, with the refuse of other\r\n     tobacco, are sometime used as filling for the commonest kind\r\n     of cigars. The filling is known as _tripa_, the very best\r\n     being selected, like the leaf, for the best cigars. Now\r\n     comes the maker, and supplying himself with a handful of\r\n     leaf (_copa_) for wrappers, and a lot of the _tripa_ for\r\n     filling or really making the body of the cigar itself he\r\n     carries it to a little table, and spreading the wrapper upon\r\n     the table, cuts with a short knife the different portions of\r\n     the leaf. This is a very nice operation, requiring skill,\r\n     knowledge, and experience; for it is in this operation that\r\n     the different qualities of tobacco are separated, the\r\n     outside of the leaf being generally the best; next that,\r\n     another quality; and that portion adjoining the stem the\r\n     worst.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco leaf.]\r\n\r\n     \"The general sorting of the tobacco is done by hands of\r\n     great experience and judgment, who are the highest in\r\n     consideration in the factories, some of them receiving\r\n     large pay; thus for instance, the official _escojedor_, or\r\n     chooser, gets from five to seven dollars (gold) per day, and\r\n     the _torcedores_, or twisters, from two to four, the workmen\r\n     being paid so much per thousand cigars, generally from two\r\n     to four dollars. To show how very careful the maker must be\r\n     in cutting out the leaf to make the most of it: Mr. del\r\n     Valle was explaining to me the process of manufacture, and\r\n     directed the maker to cut the leaf. This the man did drawing\r\n     his knife in the manner denoted by the dotted lines in the\r\n     engraving. This it appears was not making the most of the\r\n     fine part of the leaf, for Mr. del Valle, annoyed, took the\r\n     knife himself, and after rating the maker soundly for his\r\n     carelessness, showed him how to cut it properly, as defined\r\n     by the black line, the difference being, as far as I could\r\n     judge, a slight inequality of color between the two parts.\r\n     The manufacture of the cigar is very simple. The cigar\r\n     maker, being seated before a low work table, which has\r\n     raised ledges on every side except that nearest him, takes a\r\n     leaf of tobacco, spreads it out smoothly before him, and\r\n     cuts it as in the drawing. He then lays a few fragments of\r\n     tobacco (_tripa_) in the centre or a leaf strip and rolls\r\n     the whole into the shape of a cigar, and taking then a\r\n     wrapper, rolls it spirally around the cigar. If the workman\r\n     is skillful, he makes it of just the right length and size,\r\n     without any trimming of the knife. The cigars are assorted,\r\n     counted, and done up in bundles of generally twenty-five\r\n     each, and then packed in the boxes, ready for market, under\r\n     their different names of _Londres_, _Regalias_, etc. These\r\n     names are generally understood to have the same meaning\r\n     throughout the trade, the '_Vegueros_,' for instance, being\r\n     the plantation cigars, made at the _regas_, and much\r\n     esteemed by smokers, though they are rarely to be met with\r\n     for sale, or, if so, at an exhorbitant price. The '_Regalia\r\n     Imperial_,' the finest and best, is nearly seven inches\r\n     long, the price varying from one hundred and fifty to three\r\n     hundred dollars per thousand (gold). The '_Regalia_' is not\r\n     so large but fine, the '_Trabuco_,' short and thick; the\r\n     '_Londres_,' the most convenient in shape, and most smoked\r\n     in this country and England; the '_Dama_' the small sized\r\n     one used by ladies(?) or by men between acts of the opera\r\n     (_entr' operas_). There are also other names which each\r\n     factory has for some particular kinds. Artificial flavors\r\n     are given to cigars, when some particular taste is to be\r\n     satisfied, by the use of flavoring extracts. Each of the\r\n     above names has different qualities, as:\r\n\r\n        _Londres_ '_superfine_' the very best of that size (delicious).\r\n            \"        '_fino_,' not quite so fine.\r\n            \"        '_flor_,' finest, or firsts.\r\n            \"        '_superior_,' next, or seconds.\r\n            \"        '_buenos_,' next, or thirds.\r\n\r\n     Again, these different qualities have different colors,\r\n     known as: '_maduro_,' strongest; '_oscuro_,' strong (dark);\r\n     '_colorado_,' medium; '_claro_,' mild; '_Brevors_,' means\r\n     pressed. Thus, supposing one wanted a good cigar to suit his\r\n     taste, he would perhaps order: 'Partagas' (maker), 'londres'\r\n     (size), 'flor' (quality), 'Colorado' or 'oscuro' (strength),\r\n     and he would get a good cigar, nice size, best quality, not\r\n     too strong, or too mild.\r\n\r\n     \"I must confess to a weakness for the Uppmann cigars, which\r\n     I have found, without exception, to be good, and which have\r\n     a fine reputation throughout the West Indies. A millionaire\r\n     need not want a better cigar to smoke than their '_Londres\r\n     superfine_,' at sixty dollars (gold) per thousand, in\r\n     Havana, or their '_Cazadores_,' at fifty dollars. Partagas\r\n     cigars of course, every one knows are good; and he keeps\r\n     generally pretty well sold up, but fills orders as they come\r\n     in. For a new experience, one of his '_Regalio Reyno flor_,'\r\n     is something to try, even if they do cost out there\r\n     eighty-five dollars, gold.\r\n\r\n     \"In all the factories they make about the following rates:\r\n     For every order of ten thousand, costing fifty dollars per\r\n     thousand, five per cent. discount is allowed. Less than five\r\n     thousand will pay five dollars extra. I should, perhaps,\r\n     mention that no distinction is made to dealers, the only\r\n     advantage they have over the private buyer is, that they are\r\n     enabled to get the discount for large lots. The absurd\r\n     notion so prevalent with us, that the Cubans only smoke\r\n     their cigars green, is an error, since the leaf is entirely\r\n     dried in the sun before being touched by the manufacturer.\r\n     The Cubans are very particular indeed to preserve the aroma\r\n     and fragrance of the cigars, by keeping them in wrappers of\r\n     oiled and soft silks; it is, in fact, quite a sight to see\r\n     with what ceremony some of these are produced at gentlemen's\r\n     tables, with much unction, like the ushering in of old wine.\r\n     My chapter on cigars would be incomplete did I fail to note\r\n     the beautiful and courteous way in which all Cubans no\r\n     matter of what position, whether the exquisite at the club,\r\n     or the _portero_ at the door, ask you for a light. 'Do me\r\n     the favor Señor?' and you present your cigar, the lighted\r\n     end towards the speaker. He takes the cigar delicately\r\n     between his thumb and fore-finger, lights his own, and then,\r\n     with a quick, graceful motion, turns yours in his fingers,\r\n     presenting you, with another wave, the mouth end, makes you\r\n     a hand salute, utters his _gracios_, and leaves you studying\r\n     out the 'motions' and thinking what a charming thing is\r\n     national politeness.\"\r\n\r\nIn the selection of leaves for the manufacture of cigars in the\r\nfactories only the large fine ones are used for _Regalias_,\r\n_Imperiales_, or _Medios Regalias_; and also for _Cazadores_,\r\n_Panetelos_, _Imperiales_, _Caballeros_, and so on; the smaller fine\r\nleaves for _Panetelos_ and _Londres_; the dark inferior leaves for\r\n_Canones_. The commonest tobacco goes to form the _Milores Communes_;\r\nthe worst is converted into cigars which are generally pressed flat,\r\nand known as _Prinsados_. For the smallest kind of _Londres_ and for\r\n_Damos_, a proportionally small leaf is employed.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba and Luzon, one of the Philippine Islands, is found one of the\r\nlargest factories for cigars in the world. In Manilla there are three\r\nfactories where 7,000 families and 1,200 males are employed: one in\r\nCavite, in which 5,000 operatives, mostly females, are engaged; and\r\none in Malabar, which gives employment to about 2,000 more, also\r\nfemales. The tobacco is worked into both cigars and cheroots both of\r\nwhich have a variety of shapes. In both Manilla and Havana the custom\r\nof smoking is universal and one rarely meets with any of the male sex\r\nwithout a cigar between his lips.\r\n\r\nA writer speaking of the universality of the custom says:\r\n\r\n     \"In Havana, the custom of smoking is a universal one. There,\r\n     young and old indulge freely in the use of the weed,\r\n     dividing their attention pretty equally between the cigar\r\n     and the cigarette. Even the ladies of the better class in\r\n     many instances indulge; though not to so great an extent as\r\n     is commonly reported.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Smoking in Cuba\" says an American writer, \"is like the\r\n     habit of making shoes in Lynn, Massachusetts, everybody\r\n     smokes!--in the house, and by the way; in the cars, and on\r\n     horseback; everywhere, and at all times. You meet whole\r\n     regiments of youngsters, from six to eight years of age,\r\n     with black beaver hats, tail-coats, and canes, each with a\r\n     cigar, nearly his own size, in his mouth. You feel like\r\n     putting the miniature dandies into the water of the next\r\n     fountain basin, which shallow as it is, would fully, suffice\r\n     to drown the largest of them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wenches smoking.]\r\n\r\nYou have a right to accost any one smoking in the street, however much\r\nmay be his superiority or inferiority to yourself, and to ask a light\r\nfor your cigar; even negroes hatless and shirtless, thus address\r\nwell-dickied gentlemen, and _vice versa_. Refuse to take a cigar with\r\na Cuban, and you refuse his friendship. The negroes cannot work at all\r\nwithout their quota of cigars; \"and looking out of the windows of a\r\nroom in that magnificent hotel '_El Telegrafo_,' the writer remembers\r\nto have caught a glimpse more than once of the negro women at work in\r\nthe laundry, every one of whom held a long cigar in her mouth, and\r\npuffed incessantly as the clothes were manipulated upon the\r\nwashboards.\" In Havana, as throughout Cuba, there is a cigar\r\netiquette, to infringe any of the rules of which is construed as an\r\ninsult. It is, for instance considered a breach of etiquette when you\r\nare asked for a light to hand your cigar without first knocking off\r\nthe ashes. A greater breach, however, is to pass the cigar handed for\r\nyou to obtain a light from, to a third party for a similar purpose;\r\nthe rule is to hand back the cigar with as graceful a wave as you can\r\ncommand, and then if necessary, pass your own cigar to the third\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A moonlight reverie in Havana.]\r\n\r\nThe insult direct in cigar etiquette is for the party to whom you\r\napply for a light, to pass on and leave you with the remains of his\r\ncigar, or to intimate to you, by word or action, that he has no\r\nfurther use for it, and that you can throw it away. In Cuba, where\r\ncigars are plentiful, the usual custom is, when you ask for a light,\r\neven if the party be a stranger, to pull out your case and offer him a\r\ncigar, by way of recognizing the civility in stopping to accommodate\r\nyou. The Spaniards are naturally a polite people, and the stranger\r\nstepping into the Louvre and other public places of resort in Havana,\r\nis struck at once with the marked contrast in this respect to familiar\r\ngatherings elsewhere. In no place is a cigar more enjoyable than in\r\nHavana. Seated upon the roof of one of the large hotels in that city\r\nin a bright moonlight night, within hearing of the dreamy roll on the\r\nbeach: the regular throb of the sea, lulling one into quietness; the\r\nsigh of the summer breeze a lullaby to the senses; while a\r\nhigh-flavored prime cigar, as it wastes and floats away in air, is\r\nthe fairy wand which opens the enchanted gates of Reverie and\r\nImagination.\r\n\r\nWhat need of a friend under such soothing circumstances? What need of\r\nthe jolly _camarade_ of former days to sigh back sigh for sigh, puff\r\nfor puff, and wander in gentle reminiscences over the Lesbian\r\nlabyrinth of the past, when Julia was most kind, or Cynthia, darling\r\ngirl, delighted in the perfume of a capital havana? Here, in this\r\nquaint old city by the sea, is the place for dreams and reveries and\r\nthe utter rendering of one's self up--to a good cigar. Is it not a\r\nplace for reverie? Has not one with this most respectable weed, this\r\nprime _havana_, the concomitants of a thousand reveries? Will not one\r\npuff of that narcotic breath drowse deep all watching dragons, and\r\nmake for him the sleeping beauties of his will? And, _presto_, there\r\nthey are! and, oh! ye houris of the South, with what a smile and\r\nglance between the azure puffs! Well let me not forget myself. With a\r\nsterner morality he sees how the bending Bedouin fashions his pipe in\r\nthe moistened ground; he sees the slender Indian reed with the flat\r\nbowls of Lahore and Oude, the pipe of the Anglo-eyed celestial, the\r\nred clay of Bengal, and the glittering gilded cups in which the\r\ndark-skinned races of Siam, the Malacca Isles, and the Philippines,\r\nlove to enshrine their dreamy opium-haunted spirits of the weed. He\r\nsees how in the squatter's hut the old squaw sits by her hunter lord,\r\nand puffs at the corn-cob sweetness, and how by lonely ways the\r\ntraveler rests and thinks of home, and in the blue smoke greets once\r\nmore the faces of the loved, perhaps forever gone. He sees how the\r\nEsquimaux, with his hollow Walrus-tooth, makes bearable the stifling\r\nsqualor of his den; or, sterner and graver still, some item of\r\nhistoric lore mingles rudely with his dreams, and elbows sharply the\r\nairy spirits of his smoke-engendered thoughts. Softly tremble in the\r\ndelicate blue mist and the azure spirals from his old Virginia\r\nclay--the domes of a sea-bathed city. Loftily pierce the tall white\r\nminarets into the quivering heavens, while the solemn cypress throws\r\nits shade below. Before him, silent-paced as in a dream, files the\r\nweird array of Arab camels, bowing their long necks tufted with\r\ncrimson braids, and measuring the brown sands of the desert with\r\nghost-like tread. 'Tis the moon of Egypt and the waters of the Nile;\r\n'tis the palm-bough waves for him; and women, free-limbed, with\r\nflashing eyes, and antique water-vases on their heads, move past him\r\nfrom the low-rimmed shadowy wells. And he sees them there and smiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: By the sea.]\r\n\r\nHe sees on beach by the sea the summer idler sitting beneath the\r\njutting rock, gazing far out upon the sea, yet ignoring the white\r\nsails that pass up and down before him, as well as the open volume\r\nupon his knee, while his thoughts float outward and upward with the\r\ngraceful wreaths of smoke that encircle his head; and if of a\r\npractical turn, he listlessly wonders why, if his own delightful land\r\nfurnishes some twentieth of the whole Tobacco produce of the world,\r\nand does honor to her native weed by being its mightiest consumer,\r\nwhy, in the name of all disasters, the product is so dear--ay, doubly\r\ndear? And thus as his pipe burns low, a hundred other statistics;\r\nthen, knocking out his whitened ashes on the floor, he reads sedately\r\n(his pipe being out) that the \"Tobacco plant furnishes ashes to the\r\namount of one-fourth of its bulk, being a much greater proportion than\r\nthat of any other vegetable product,\" and, moreover, that \"Tobacco\r\nexhausts the soil at the ratio of fourteen tons of wheat to one of\r\nTobacco!\" Oh, base insinuation! But, as he relights his pipe, and the\r\ngraceful vapor circles in fresh buoyancy and grace before him, he\r\nonly, in his contented mind, retains that one supreme expression--\"_One\r\nton of Tobacco!_\" Ah,\r\n\r\n  \"Think of it, picture it\r\n   Now, if you can!\"\r\n\r\nFrom \"A Paper of Tobacco,\"[63] we extract the following humorous\r\ndescription of Yankee cigar smokers, which to a certain extent is true\r\nto life, but like most of the articles descriptive of American life by\r\nEnglish Authors, who travel in America and write _a book_ afterwards,\r\nit is exaggerated or overdrawn:\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 63: London, 1839.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An American smoker.]\r\n\r\n     \"The Americans, who pride themselves on being the\r\n     fastest-going people on the 'versal globe'--who build\r\n     steamers that can out-paddle the sea-serpent and breed\r\n     horses that can trot faster than an ostrich can run--are,\r\n     undoubtedly, entitled to take precedence of all nations as\r\n     consumers of the weed. The sedentary Turk, who smokes from\r\n     morn to night, does not, on an average, get through so much\r\n     tobacco per annum, as a right slick, active, go-ahead\r\n     Yankee, who thinks nothing, 'upon his own relation,' of\r\n     felling a wagon-load of timber before breakfast, or of\r\n     cutting down a couple of acres corn before dinner. The\r\n     Americans, it is to be observed, generally smoke cigars; and\r\n     tobacco in this form burns very fast away in the open air,\r\n     more especially when the consumer is rapidly locomotive,\r\n     whether upon his own legs, the back of a horse, the top of a\r\n     coach, the deck of a steamboat, or in an open railway\r\n     carriage. The habit of chewing tobacco is also prevalent\r\n     in 'the States,' nor is it, as in Great Britain and Ireland,\r\n     almost entirely confined to the poorer classes. Members of\r\n     the House of Representatives and of the Senate, doctors,\r\n     judges, barristers, and attorneys chew tobacco almost as\r\n     generally as the laboring classes in the old country. Even\r\n     in a court of justice, more especially in the Western\r\n     States, it is no unusual thing to see judge, jury, and the\r\n     gentlemen of the bar, all chewing and spitting as liberally\r\n     as the crew of a homeward-bound West Indiaman. It must\r\n     indeed be confessed that Brother Jonathan loves tobacco 'not\r\n     wisely but too well,' and that the habits which are induced\r\n     by his manner of using it are far from 'elegant.' The truth\r\n     is, he neither smokes nor chews like a gentleman; he lives\r\n     in a land of liberty, and takes his tobacco when and where\r\n     he pleases. He spits as freely as he smokes and chews--upon\r\n     the carpet or in the fire-place--for he is not particular as\r\n     to where he squirts his copious saliva, and does not think\r\n     with the late Dr. Samuel Parr, that a spitting-box is a\r\n     necessary article of household furniture. The free-born\r\n     citizen of the States laughs at the aristocratic\r\n     restrictions imposed on smoking in England, where, on board\r\n     of the numerous steamboats that ply on the Thames,\r\n     conveying the pride of the city to Gravesend and Margate, no\r\n     smoking is allowed abaft the funnel, and where, in\r\n     public-houses ashore, no gentleman is permitted to smoke in\r\n     the parlor before two o'clock in the afternoon. A pipe of\r\n     tobacco, or a cigar, after a day's hard exercise, whether\r\n     mental or bodily, and after the cravings of hunger and\r\n     thirst are appeased, may be fairly ranked amongst the most\r\n     delightful and most harmless of all earthly luxuries. It\r\n     fills the mind with pleasing visions, and the heart with\r\n     kindly feelings. A hard-working laborer, smoking by the side\r\n     of his hearth at night, presents a perfect picture of quiet\r\n     enjoyment. I see him now in my mind's eye. He is seated in\r\n     an old high-backed, cushionless arm-chair, but an easy one,\r\n     nevertheless, to him, who from dawn till sunset, has been\r\n     engaged in ploughing, thrashing, ditching, or mowing. With\r\n     one leg thrown over the other, he quietly reclines backward,\r\n     and with an expression of perfect mental composure, he gazes\r\n     on the smoke that ascends from his pipe. There is a\r\n     sentiment-exciting power[64] in the smoke of tobacco when\r\n     perceived by the eye, as well as a pleasing sedative effect\r\n     when inhaled; and those smokers who have any doubt of the\r\n     fact should take a pipe with their eyes closed. A person who\r\n     smokes with his eyes shut cannot very well tell whether his\r\n     cigar is lighted or not. How soothing is a pipe or a cigar\r\n     to a wearied sportsman, on his return to his inn from the\r\n     moors! As he sits quietly smoking, he thinks of the absent\r\n     friends whom he will gratify with presents of grouse; and,\r\n     in a state of perfect contentment with himself and all the\r\n     world, he determines to give all his game away. Full of such\r\n     kindly feelings, he retires to bed; but, alas, with\r\n     day-light, when the effect of the tobacco has subsided, the\r\n     old leaven of selfishness prevails, and his good intentions\r\n     are abandoned. 'Mary,' said an old Cumberland farmer to his\r\n     daughter, when she was once asking him to buy her a new\r\n     beaver, 'why dost thou always tease me about such things\r\n     when I'm quietly smoking my pipe?' 'Because ye are always\r\n     best-tempered then, feyther,' was the reply. 'I believe,\r\n     lass, thou's reet,' rejoined the farmer; 'for when I was a\r\n     lad, I remember that my poor feyther was just the same;\r\n     after he had smoked a pipe or twee he wad ha' gi'en his head\r\n     away if it had been loose.'\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 64: The smoke ascending from the snuff of a\r\n              candle could excite a sentimental feeling in the minds\r\n              of Wordsworth and Sir George Beaumont, though it seems\r\n              to have had no such effect on the mind of\r\n              Crabbe.--_Lockhart's Life of Sir Walter Scott._]\r\n\r\nThe following ode to a Cigar is no doubt familiar to many, yet will\r\npay a re-perusal:\r\n\r\n  \"And oft, mild friend, to me thou art\r\n    A monitor, though still;\r\n  Thou speak'st a lesson to my heart\r\n    Beyond the preacher's skill.\r\n\r\n  \"Thou'rt like the man of worth, who gives\r\n    To goodness every day,\r\n  The odor of whose virtues lives\r\n    When he has passed away.\r\n\r\n  \"When in the lonely evening hour,\r\n    Attended but by thee,\r\n  O'er history's varied page I pore,\r\n    Man's fate in thine I see.\r\n\r\n  \"Oft, as thy snowy column grows,\r\n    Then breaks and falls away,\r\n  I trace how mighty realms thus rose,\r\n    Thus trembled to decay.\r\n\r\n  \"Awhile, like thee, earth's masters burn,\r\n    And smoke and fume around,\r\n  And then like thee to ashes turn,\r\n    And mingle with the ground.\r\n\r\n  \"Life's but a leaf adroitly rolled,\r\n    And time's the wasting breath,\r\n  That, late or early, we behold\r\n    Gives all to dusty death.\r\n\r\n  \"From beggar's frieze to monarch's robe\r\n    One common doom is passed;\r\n  Sweet nature's work, the swelling globe,\r\n    Must all burn out at last.\r\n\r\n  \"And what is he who smokes thee now?\r\n    A little moving heap,\r\n  That soon, like thee, to fate must bow,\r\n    With thee in dust must sleep.\r\n\r\n  \"But though thy ashes downward go,\r\n    Thy essence rolls on high;\r\n  Thus, when my body must lie low,\r\n    My soul shall cleave the sky.\"\r\n\r\nIn Charles Butler's \"Story of Count Bismarck's Life,\" a good anecdote\r\nis told of the Count and his last cigar:--\r\n\r\n     \"'The value of a good cigar,' said Bismarck, as he proceeded\r\n     to light an excellent Havana, 'is best understood when it is\r\n     the last you possess, and there is no chance of getting\r\n     another. At Königgrätz I had only one cigar left in my\r\n     pocket, which I carefully guarded during the whole of the\r\n     battle as a miser does his treasure. I did not feel\r\n     justified in using it. I painted in glowing colors in my\r\n     mind the happy hour when I should enjoy it after the\r\n     victory. But I had miscalculated my chances.' 'And what was\r\n     the cause of your miscalculation?' 'A poor dragoon. He lay\r\n     helpless, with both arms crushed, murmuring for something to\r\n     refresh him. I felt in my pockets and found I had only gold,\r\n     and that would be of no use to him. But, stay, I had still\r\n     my treasured cigar! I lighted this for him, and placed it\r\n     between his teeth. You should have seen the poor fellow's\r\n     grateful smile! I never enjoyed a cigar so much as that one\r\n     which I did not smoke.'\"\r\n\r\nIn European cities juveniles offer the smoker, at every street corner,\r\na \"pipe\" or a \"cigar light.\" The following description, entitled\r\n\"Light, Sir,\" is from an English journal, and contains much\r\ninteresting information on the various modes of lighting pipes and\r\ncigars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Light, Sir.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"''Ere y'are, sir--pipe-light, cigar-light, on'y 'ap'ny a\r\n     box--'ave a light, sir.' Every smoker of the larger cities\r\n     knows the cry. Every tender-hearted smoker is familiar with\r\n     the appeal, by day and by night, and remembers pangs of\r\n     regret he has felt when the want of ha'pence or the\r\n     repletion of his match-box has prevented his much-besought\r\n     response. There is no need now to enlarge upon the\r\n     sufferings, the adventures, the dangers of these peripatetic\r\n     juvenile trades folk, sparse of clothes and food, and full\r\n     of the material which may make or mar a nation; for all\r\n     this was done, and even overdone, by the graphic\r\n     sensationalists of the London penny dailies when Chancellor\r\n     Lowe proposed a tax on matches. We may, upon occasion, feel\r\n     for the manufacturers and venders of 'lights,' but more\r\n     generally we find ourselves constrained to sympathize with\r\n     the purchasers of such contrivances for the ignition of\r\n     pipes and cigars. The smoking of tobacco is an art; an art\r\n     which, in its proper exercise, requires much care, much\r\n     prudence, and not a little skill. This is a proposition\r\n     which must, from its very nature, be startling to\r\n     non-smokers, and surprising to many smokers. The tobacco\r\n     hater (invariably an illogical creature, who hates that\r\n     which he knows not) will hold up hands in amazement, and\r\n     sniff with the nose in contempt, to whom reply would be\r\n     superfluous.\r\n\r\n     \"With the smoker the case is otherwise. A German writer\r\n     recently said that the English were better smokers than the\r\n     Germans; because, whereas the German smoked incessantly,\r\n     without rule, system, or moderation, the English smoked with\r\n     care, with slow and appreciative lovingness, and the\r\n     determination not to overstep the bounds of rational\r\n     enjoyment. Had he known more of English smokers, he would\r\n     not have made so wild a statement; and had he known English\r\n     women better, he would never have attributed to their sweet\r\n     influence the fancied superiority he describes in English as\r\n     compared with German smoking. In truth, the art of tobacco\r\n     using is nowhere more ignored, nowhere more contemptuously\r\n     neglected than in these 'favored isles.' For one man who\r\n     smokes with a reason, for a purpose, or by system, you shall\r\n     find a thousand who smoke without either; and the result is\r\n     that those who smoke have little defense, in the general\r\n     way, for their practice, while those who condemn the habit\r\n     have far better grounds for their opposition than they have\r\n     ever yet been able to explain. To those who do know why they\r\n     use tobacco, it is well-nigh incredible that so many of\r\n     their fellow-smokers should be ignorant of the properties,\r\n     the uses, the abuses, of the weed they burn and the fumes in\r\n     which they delight. Yet, even this is not so surprising as\r\n     the fact that so few of those who smoke--smoke much, often\r\n     and constantly--should be ignorant of, or indifferent to,\r\n     the conditions which are necessary to their own adequate\r\n     enjoyment of the weed.\r\n\r\n     \"You will see a man light a cigar so carelessly that one\r\n     side of the roll will burn rapidly, with prodigious\r\n     fumigation and giving out a dark and offensive cloud, while\r\n     the other side remains untouched by the fire, only to wither\r\n     and crackle and twist into uncouth shapes, until the smoker\r\n     flings the cigar away, with an accompaniment of expletives\r\n     which attach rather to his own stupidity than to the piece\r\n     of tobacco he has so abominably abused. You will see another\r\n     with a good pipe, laden with good tobacco, well lit, blowing\r\n     incessantly down the mouth-piece and the stem until the\r\n     moisture introduced with his breath into the bowl of his\r\n     pipe effectually prevents the tobacco from burning, and puts\r\n     out the fire; and then you will hear him lament that he\r\n     should have paid so good a price for a pipe so bad that it\r\n     'fouls' before he has smoked a single hour. You will see\r\n     another who, while he talks to his friends, allows his\r\n     tobacco to go out every three or four minutes, so that at\r\n     length his mouth is sore and his palate nauseated with the\r\n     combined fumes of lucifer matches, burnt paper and exhausted\r\n     tobacco dust; and he inveighs against the 'cabbage-leaf\r\n     which that rascally tobacconist sold him for good Shag or\r\n     Cavendish.' Another knows so little of the art of smoking\r\n     that he never 'stops' his pipe, and so allows the light dust\r\n     of the burnt weed to fly about him in flakes and minute\r\n     particles, to the permanent damage of his own and his\r\n     neighbors' clothes. But in nothing is the inartistic\r\n     character of English smoking so conspicuously exemplified as\r\n     in the use of 'lights.' Those who form the great majority of\r\n     smokers amongst the English-speaking races seem to consider\r\n     that, so long as their pipes are set alight, it matters not\r\n     how or from what source the light is obtained. Thus, one\r\n     will place his pipe-bowl in a flame of gas, and pull away at\r\n     the stem till his tobacco is on fire; another will thrust\r\n     the bowl into the midst of a coal fire, and when he sees a\r\n     glow in the bowl withdraw it, and contentedly puff away;\r\n     another stops an obliging policeman or railway guard, and\r\n     ignites his tobacco by hard pulling at the flame of an\r\n     oil-lamp; another will stick the end of a choice cigar into\r\n     the bowl of a pipe filled with coarsest Shag, thus ruining\r\n     the flavor of his 'prime Havana' forever; while yet another\r\n     will light lucifer matches, and apply the blazing brimstone\r\n     to his pipe or cigar, thus saturating the whole mass with\r\n     sulphurous and phosphoretic fumes, to the ruin of the weed\r\n     and the injury of his own health.\r\n\r\n     \"How much wiser the West Indian negro, who takes a burning\r\n     stick from the wood fire, and tenderly lights his weed\r\n     therewith, or joyfully brings a handful of the white-hot\r\n     ashes in his thick-skinned palm, that 'massa' may fire his\r\n     cigar! Or the travelling peddler or tinker, who, as he sits\r\n     by the way-side, patiently wooes the sun with a\r\n     'burning-glass' till his tobacco ignites, or uses with equal\r\n     prudence and skill the ancient but inimitable tinder-box.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bringing a light.]\r\n\r\n     \"But this is the age of Fusees. What a name! When, in our\r\n     youth, those longitudinal strips of tinder, semi-divided\r\n     into innumerable transverse slips, all tipped with harmless,\r\n     ignitable matter, first assumed the title, we had little\r\n     notion of the atrocities which would come to be dignified by\r\n     their name. This was soon after the world had been delighted\r\n     by the Congreves, which drove Lucifer to the wall, and\r\n     before English and German ingenuity had taught us to find\r\n     'death' in the box, as well as 'the pot.' The innocent old\r\n     fusee had his faults, certainly. He would not always light;\r\n     he had a bad habit of turning back on your finger-nail and\r\n     burning its quick when you struck him; and he would\r\n     occasionally light up, all by himself, and set fire to fifty\r\n     of his fellows in your waist-coast pocket, or the tail of\r\n     your best dress-coat. (Those were the days when waist-coats\r\n     were gorgeous and tail-coats immense.) But what were these\r\n     peccadilloes compared with the sins of the modern\r\n     'cigar-light?' 'Fusees,' forsooth! More like bomb-shells,\r\n     military mines, torpedoes, and nitroglycerine trains. Who\r\n     has not had them explode in his eye, on his cheek, down his\r\n     neck, scarring his skin, burning holes in his coats and\r\n     trousers, frightening passers-by, and doing all manner of\r\n     deep-dyed devilment? Nor is this the worst. Those who will\r\n     trust their skins, and their eyes, and their clothes to\r\n     'Vesuvians,' 'Flamers,' and the like, are not to be pitied;\r\n     for they are more cruel to their tobacco than the fusees are\r\n     to them. Our grievance is that so many engines of\r\n     destructiveness and offensiveness should be so largely\r\n     patronized by smokers, to their own discomfort, the\r\n     ruination of their tobacco, the scandalization of gentle and\r\n     simple, and the encouragement of vicious manufactures. Now,\r\n     we are not going to particularize too closely, for fear of\r\n     consequences. In these days, when a man may bring an action\r\n     for libel because it has been said of him that he sells bad\r\n     soup at a railway station, prudence is the better part of\r\n     valor. But, just examine this heterogeneous pile of\r\n     'cigar-lights,' which rears its audacious head upon the\r\n     table. Here are Palmers, Barbers, Farmers, Lord Lornes,\r\n     Tichbornes, Bryants and Moys, Bells and Blacks, Alexandres,\r\n     Bismarcks, King Williams, Napoleons, and scores of other\r\n     varieties. Some light 'only on the box,' some light\r\n     anywhere, some everywhere, and some nowhere. Some are on\r\n     wood, some on porcelain, some on glass, some on dire deeds\r\n     intent. There are vestas, safety-matches, patent\r\n     flint-and-steel contrivances, with silver tubes and\r\n     marvellous screws wherewith to put them out when they have\r\n     served your turn. Some are excellent, many passable, still\r\n     more intolerable. One of these times it may be worth while\r\n     to speak of the good ones, but at present we care only to\r\n     treat of those that are bad, and that briefly.\r\n\r\n     \"Here's a 'Flamer'--we name no names--everybody seems to\r\n     make flamers; and this one deserves his title. We want to\r\n     light a peaceful pipe, and he bursts out in a fury like unto\r\n     nothing on earth so much as Etna in convulsion, or the\r\n     Tuilleries in petroleum blaze. But, if you have any respect\r\n     for your tobacco, your lips, your nostrils, or your lungs,\r\n     you will let him get rid of his flames before you apply him\r\n     to your cigar; and, when you do venture so far, he drops off\r\n     the stick and burns a hole in the carpet. Or, if you be\r\n     daring enough to take a light from the flamer while he\r\n     flames, you spoil your tobacco, foul your mouth, and get a\r\n     taste of sulphur-suffocation such as Asmodeus might have\r\n     were he to take a whiff of a smoke-and-fire belching chimney\r\n     in the Black Country as he flies across that district by\r\n     night. Haven't got a light? Glad of it. Try a\r\n     Vesuvian-round, black and tipped with blue. There's a\r\n     pyrotechnic display for you! Now, in with it, after the\r\n     approved style illustrated by the two human hands engaged in\r\n     lighting a cigar on the illuminated cover of the box. 'Ugh!'\r\n     you say. Just so; you've got a mouthful of choice\r\n     abominations, which will cost you much waste of saliva,\r\n     several shivers, and the whole piece of tobacco you were\r\n     about to enjoy. Here, put that away; take another, light it\r\n     quietly with this wax-vesta, or this wooden 'spill,' or this\r\n     screw of paper; smoke gently, don't let the fire out, and\r\n     you'll be all right. In future, you may be wise enough to\r\n     avoid cheap cigar-lights and pipe-lights, even for use in\r\n     the streets. Our word upon it--they are far dearer than\r\n     those which cost more.\"\r\n\r\nThe following description of \"Home Made Cigars\" is from _All the Year\r\nRound_, and will doubtless be read with interest by many growers of\r\nthe weed who may recall similar scenes:\r\n\r\n     \"'Apropos of cigars,' said Wilkins, lighting a second\r\n     fragrant Havana with the stump of the first, 'let's go and\r\n     see the farmer's establishment for making them. You see that\r\n     field of tobacco over yonder? Old Standish raises his own\r\n     weed, dries it in the big open sheds behind the barn, cures\r\n     it--I don't quite know the whole process--and then has it\r\n     made into sixes and short fives, Conchas and Cabanas, like a\r\n     Cuban señor. I went over the establishment about a year ago,\r\n     and it is worth seeing.'\r\n\r\n     \"We strolled first over to the tobacco field. The weed was\r\n     then just at its full ripeness, and the long, flappy,\r\n     delicately-furred green leaves bent gracefully over toward\r\n     the ground, growing smaller and smaller the higher they were\r\n     on the stout stalk. Few foreigners know that even as far\r\n     north as New England, in the sunny valleys of Connecticut,\r\n     sheltered as they are from the bleak east winds of the\r\n     Atlantic and accustomed to a long and steady summer heat,\r\n     tobacco is grown in large quantities, flourishes\r\n     exuberantly, and is one of the chief sources of profit to\r\n     the farmers. It needs a rich warm soil and careful tending;\r\n     but it gives in its growth, a sentimental reward to the\r\n     cultivator; for it comes up gracefully, rapidly, and\r\n     beautifully, and is with some care, one of the most\r\n     satisfactory crops to 'handle.' Having gazed at and tasted\r\n     the thick leaves, we sauntered behind the barn, and there\r\n     saw the long open shed, with beams running parallel from\r\n     end to end, where the gathered tobacco leaves were hung to\r\n     be thoroughly dried by the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making cigars.]\r\n\r\n     \"Then Wilkins conducted us for some distance along the river\r\n     bank; we jumped into a boat and rowed perhaps half a mile,\r\n     landing by the side of a little shop-like building, where we\r\n     heard the hum of voices and the commotion of many busy\r\n     persons. We entered and found ourselves in a long, low room,\r\n     having wide tables ranged along the walls; here, working\r\n     rapidly, were rows of chatty country girls, who, as they\r\n     worked, laughed and talked, and now and then hummed a verse\r\n     of some familiar ballad. Neatly packed piles of the dried\r\n     and cured leaf lay upon the table before them.\r\n\r\n     \"Each was armed with knives and cutters, and we watched the\r\n     quick transformation of the flat leaves into the smooth and\r\n     compact cigars. The tobacco grown upon the farm was, we\r\n     discovered, only used as wrappers for the cigars. The good\r\n     farmer imported, for the interior filling, a fine tobacco\r\n     from Havana. Strips and little pieces of this the girls\r\n     placed in the centre of the cigar, wrapping the Connecticut\r\n     tobacco in wide strips tightly about it, then pasting each\r\n     of the last with some paste in a pot by their side. It\r\n     seemed to be done almost in an instant; the Havana slips\r\n     were laid down, cut and trimmed, and pressed into shape in\r\n     a twinkling; the wrappers were cut as quickly; and, more\r\n     rapidly than I can describe it, the cigar was made. These\r\n     girls were mostly daughters of neighboring farmers, who\r\n     received so much per hundred cigars made; intelligent,\r\n     bright-eyed and witty; many of them comely, with rosy cheeks\r\n     and ruddy health; educated at the common schools, and able,\r\n     their day's work over, to sit down at the piano and rattle\r\n     away _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\n     \"His stock of cigars thus made up, from the first sowing to\r\n     the last finishing touch, the good squire (being\r\n     Yankee-like, a sort of Jack-of-all-trades,) would have them\r\n     put up in gorgeously labeled boxes, carry them to town, and\r\n     sell them to retail dealers; not disdaining himself, twice\r\n     or thrice a year, to go through the neighboring States with\r\n     samples, and acting as his own commercial traveler.\"\r\n\r\nThis description, however, may not convey a correct idea of the exact\r\nmode of manufacture to many growers of tobacco in the Connecticut\r\nValley inasmuch as many planters of the \"weed\" make the entire cigar\r\n(more particularly for their own use) wrapper, binder and filler\r\nwholly of seed-leaf tobacco, such cigars do not readily sell to the\r\ntrade except at inferior prices which admit of but a small profit to\r\nthe manufacturer. The following spicy article from the \"London\r\n_Figaro_\" may be interesting to all smokers as well as guide them in\r\nthe selection of a good cigar.\r\n\r\n     \"I am an imaginative person, and 'society' has treated me\r\n     shamefully of late--its tangible delights are absent from\r\n     me. Allow me, then, to console myself by the 'creations of\r\n     smoke,' as Lord Lytton puts it. I am scouted by society\r\n     because I am in love. I am told I look:\r\n\r\n          \"As hyenas in love are supposed to look, or\r\n           A something between Abelard and old Blücher.\"\r\n\r\n     And, moreover, I am an ugly man, but there was only a\r\n     fortnight's difference in gaining a woman's love between\r\n     John Wilkes and the handsomest man in England, courage,\r\n     Jehu! I like idleness, because it shows that one can afford\r\n     it; so I am puffing idly--ah! the balmy fragrance of this\r\n     mild Havana! 'Oh! the effect of that first note from the\r\n     woman one loves!' says one; 'Oh! the kiss on the dimpled\r\n     cheek, the sound of the silver voice!' says another; but\r\n     what can compare to the dreamy exquisite luxury of a good\r\n     cigar? But, heavens, what am I saying? I am in love, and\r\n     Julia reads the \"_Figaro_!\" The paleness of Flaxman's\r\n     illustrations spreads over me--please, reader, look upon the\r\n     sentiment as sarcastic. I am in a fog of smoke, and am\r\n     quaffing claret from the silvered pewter. There's plenty of\r\n     it; and no soul can say:\r\n\r\n          \"That in drinking from _that_ beaker\r\n           I am sipping like a fly.'\r\n\r\n     How changed from the long, long days ago, when I was a\r\n     connoisseur in Parparillo cigars, brown-paper cigarettes,\r\n     and cane cheroots! Then I fondly adored Sir Walter Raleigh\r\n     as my earthly idol, for giving me tobacco--when I had the\r\n     halfpence to buy it--and delighted in the story, told by\r\n     queer Oldys, of Sir Walter's servant extinguishing the\r\n     Virginny smoke that issued from his master's lips, by\r\n     drenching him with ale. Alas! my idol is shattered by\r\n     Hawkins. The Spaniards say, 'The lie that lasts for half an\r\n     hour is worth telling.' History has lied for longer, by a\r\n     considerable period. Fond even as I was of my brown-papered\r\n     cigarettes when baccy failed, I must confess I never reached\r\n     the stage attained by Sir Christopher Haydon's chaplain,\r\n     William Breedon, parson of Thornton, in Bucks, who was so\r\n     given to\r\n\r\n          \"October store and best Virginia,\"\r\n\r\n     that when he had no tobacco (and too much drink) he used to\r\n     cut the _bell-ropes_ and smoke them!\r\n\r\n          \"The Polyglot--three parts--my text;\r\n           Howbeit--likewise--now to my next.\"\r\n\r\n     \"On Smoke.--It is a vulgar, ludicrous, and foolish custom to\r\n     bite off the nose of a cigar. Don't be a Vandal--you are not\r\n     a Sandwich Islander, about to chew your _Kava_. A cigar\r\n     should be handled daintily; it is a fragile, graceful\r\n     creature--don't mar its beauty. Tear off the twist, and the\r\n     pleasure of smoking is at an end! The outer leaf becomes\r\n     untwirled. Ere it is half finished, you have a ragged end\r\n     between your lips--nasty, foul, and unsightly--through which\r\n     the smoke comes in huge clouds to your mouth, instead of\r\n     slender streams on the palate. 'How, then,' say you; 'prick\r\n     it, or cut it, or what? Tear it not, cut it not; nor yet\r\n     puncture it. Don't be frightened of the cigar--thrusting a\r\n     half-inch alone into the mouth; but, when you begin, take a\r\n     good half of it in the mouth; pull at it lustily for a few\r\n     seconds, to open its pores; then draw it out, allowing but\r\n     an inch to be held within the lips--believe me, you will\r\n     enjoy it a hundred-fold more; and there are but few cigars\r\n     that will not allow of their virtue being drawn though their\r\n     leaves. Never bite the end off, and never use your cigar\r\n     cruelly, by squeezing it, biting it, or re-lighting it.\r\n     Cigar-holders, tubes, quills, and such like inventions, we\r\n     despise. If you cannot bear the cigar in your mouth--aye,\r\n     and enjoy it--you have no business with it: go back to your\r\n     brown paper and cane!\r\n\r\n     \"What is the best beverage to imbibe whilst inhaling the\r\n     precious weed? Momentous question! Coffee, or claret, says\r\n     Jehu. I do not believe in bitter, as an accompanying liquid\r\n     to a cigar. The Corporation of Christ-church, years ago,\r\n     smoked cigars, and drank with them that then famous\r\n     concoction known as 'Ringwood Beer.' What was the result?\r\n     The first toast at every civic banquet held for years in\r\n     that borough was gravely given out, and bumpered with due\r\n     solemnity, as follows:--\r\n\r\n          'Prosperation to this Corporation.'\r\n\r\n     Brandy is a perfect antidote to inebriation from beer, so we\r\n     are told. The Corporation should have known this, and been\r\n     awakened from their long and pleasant dream of\r\n     _prosperation_. Brandy I should hardly reckon amongst the\r\n     drinks that ought to be with cigars, notwithstanding that\r\n     Tennyson has asked:--\r\n\r\n          'For what delights can equal those\r\n           Which stir, with spirits, inner depths? &c.'\r\n\r\n     Brandy-and-water, gin, whisky, and the likes are only fit\r\n     for those who nocturnally lay the foundation for matutinal\r\n     'hot coppers,' with the vilest shag in the most odorous of\r\n     yards of clay. 'Smoking leads to drinking,' has been a\r\n     favorite old woman's saying for time out of mind. How I hate\r\n     old women's sayings! A grain--requiring to be picked out\r\n     with a pin and microscope--of truth, with a bushel of bunkum\r\n     or cant. How is it, that ever since the days of James I, of\r\n     'hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain' memory, there\r\n     have always been carpers on the injurious effects of\r\n     smoking? 'Nicotine!' they say, with a\r\n     would-be-taken-for-know-all-about-it-air. Quite so; but, as\r\n     recent investigations have proved that, so far as the actual\r\n     'poisoning' is concerned, it would take upwards of a\r\n     thousand years to kill the most inveterate of healthy\r\n     smokers, we have still time to breathe--and 'it please the\r\n     pigs.' _Mem._ for pipers--French tobacco contains the\r\n     greatest, Turkish the least, per-centage of nicotine.\r\n     Havana, two and one-half per cent.\r\n\r\n     \"But an unique old woman of Jehu's acquaintance goes further\r\n     still; boldly asserting that 'smoking is well for making\r\n     good soldiers, well for making good sailors, well for making\r\n     sometimes good lawyers; not so well for making good\r\n     Christians.' Oh! ashes of Hawkins and Raleigh, shudder for\r\n     the results of 'baccy on degraded human nature.' There must\r\n     be a rarity of good Christians, then amongst the parsons;\r\n     they are all fond of it. Dean Aldrich was, perhaps, tho\r\n     greatest smoker of his day. His excessive attachment to this\r\n     habit was the cause of many wagers. Here's one:--At\r\n     breakfast, one morning, at the 'Varsity, an undergraduate\r\n     laid his companion long odds that the Dean was smoking at\r\n     that instant. Away they hastened; and, being admitted to the\r\n     Dean's study, stated the occasion of their visit. The Dean\r\n     replied, in perfect good humor, to the layer of the bet,\r\n     'You see, sir, you have lost your wager; for I am not\r\n     smoking, but filling my pipe.' But--my cigar has reached its\r\n     last dying speech, and there is but a drop left in the\r\n     beaker.\r\n\r\n          'I'll not leave thee, thou lone drop!\r\n               'Twould be mighty unkind,\r\n           Since the rest I have swallow'd,\r\n                To leave thee behind.'\r\n\r\n     \"Final exhortation. Choose the small, sound, tolerably firm,\r\n     and elastic cigar: the dwarf contains stuff within which the\r\n     giant hath not. Don't flatter yourself you're smoking\r\n     cabbage, if not tobacco--its any odds on rhubarb!\r\n\r\n          'For me there's nothing new or rare,\r\n             Till wine deceives my brain;\r\n           And that, I think, 's a reason fair\r\n             To fill my pipe again.'\"\r\n\r\n     Charles Lamb, \"the gentle Elia\" was during a portion of his\r\n     lifetime a famous smoker. In a letter to Hazlitt he writes,\r\n     \"I am so smoky with last night's ten pipes, that I must\r\n     leave off.\" It is said that he smoked only the coarsest and\r\n     strongest he could procure. Dr. Parr inquired of him how he\r\n     acquired his \"prodigious smoking powers.\" \"I toiled after\r\n     it, sir,\" was the reply, \"as some men toil after virtue!\"\r\n     Lamb was constant in his use of tobacco, and among all the\r\n     great luminaries of English literature we know of none more\r\n     addicted to the use of the pipe. Lamb might often be seen in\r\n     his chambers in Mitre Court Building, puffing the coarsest\r\n     weed from a long clay pipe, in company with Parr who used\r\n     the finest kind of tobacco in a pipe half filled with salt.\r\n     It was no easy task to relinquish the use of tobacco and it\r\n     cost him many a struggle and much determined effort. In\r\n     writing to Wordsworth he says:--\"I wish you may think this a\r\n     handsome farewell to my 'Friendly Traitress.' Tobacco has\r\n     been my evening comfort and my morning curse for these five\r\n     years. I have had it in my head to do it (Farewell to\r\n     Tobacco) these two years; but tobacco stood in its own light\r\n     when it gave me headaches that prevented my singing its\r\n     praises.\"\r\n\r\nLamb's poem is without doubt one of the finest pieces of verse ever\r\nwritten on tobacco, and seemingly contains both words of praise and\r\ndispraise--the latter however in some sense are insincere.\r\n\r\n  \"May the Babylonish curse\r\n  Straight confound my stammering verse\r\n  If I can a passage see\r\n  In this word-perplexity,\r\n  Or a fit expression find,\r\n  Or a language to my mind,\r\n  (Still the phrase is wide or scant,)\r\n  To take leave of thee, GREAT PLANT!\r\n  Or in my terms relate\r\n  Half my love, or half my hate;\r\n  For I hate, yet love thee

following neat little tribute to tobacco, pays a\r\ndeserved compliment, not only to the plant, but to the great English\r\nsmoker, \"ye renowned Sir Walter Raleigh.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Let poets rhyme of what they will,\r\n    Youth, Beauty, Love or Glory, still\r\n                My theme shall be Tobacco!\r\n    Hail, weed, eclipsing every flow'r,\r\n    Of thee I fain would make my bow'r\r\n

to his \"little roll\"\r\nand regards this mode of obtaining the flavor of tobacco the best. The\r\nfinest are made in Havana and, vast quantities are used by the Cubans\r\nand Spaniards. A writer in \"The Tobacco Plant\" gives this pleasing\r\neffusion in regard to them:--\r\n\r\n     \"Your cigarette is a sort of hybrid--half-pipe and\r\n     half-cigar; neither the one nor the other; neither the\r\n     delight of the epicure nor the solace of the true\r\n     tobacco-lover. Far be it from us to deny, or even to\r\n     question, its value, its utility, or its charm. We have\r\n     smoked too many to dream of treating them with\r\n     scorn--cigarettes of Virginia shag, strong, pungent,\r\n     luscious; of light and fragrant Persian, innocuous and\r\n     soothing; cigarettes rolled by ladies' dainty fingers,\r\n     compressed by elegant French machines of silk and silver,\r\n     cut, stamped, and gummed by prosy, matter-of-fact, and even\r\n     vulgar Titanic engines in great tobacco-factories. But the\r\n     thorough-paced smoker renders to his cigarette only a\r\n     secondary and diluted adoration: it is nice, it is delicate,\r\n     it is pretty--a thing to be toyed with, to be fondled, even\r\n     to burn one's fingers (or, perchance, one's lips) withal;\r\n     but by no means an object to call forth a passion.\r\n\r\n     \"But just as the world would be a tame and an insipid\r\n     institution were all men's tastes alike, so the world of\r\n     smokers would lose much of its romance were all the lovers\r\n     of the weed of temperament too robust to love a cigarette.\r\n     Brevity and sweetness are proverbially held to constitute\r\n     claims upon the respect and admiration of the voluptuous,\r\n     and to the cigarette these cannot be denied. There is\r\n     something touching in the self-abnegation of a tobaccoite\r\n     who will devote five mortal minutes and the sweat of his\r\n     refined intelligence, with the skill of his delicate\r\n     fingers, to the preparation of a tiny capsule of the weed,\r\n     which burns itself to ashes in five minutes more. There is a\r\n     butterfly-beauty about the cigarette to which the cigar and\r\n     the pipe can lay no claim--a summer charm to stir the dreamy\r\n     rapture of a poet, and to excite the Lotus-eating\r\n     philosopher even to analogy. Just as the suns, and flowers,\r\n     and balmy zephyrs of a century have gone to form the gauzy,\r\n     multi-colored insect that flits across your path throughout\r\n     a single summer's day, and then returns to dust and vapor,\r\n     so the harvest of West-Indian and East-Asian fields, the\r\n     long voyage of the mariner, the merchant's hours of soil,\r\n     the steam-power and manual labor of the factory, the\r\n     thoughtful calculations of the trader, the skill of the\r\n     tissue-paper maker, all have gone, and more than these, to\r\n     the creation of a fairy-cylinder of Tobacco, which glows,\r\n     delights, expires, and meets its end in ten or fifteen\r\n     fleeting minutes.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the cigarette is not a favorite with us, still we admire its\r\nuse as a sort of appendage to a good dinner, and as preparatory work\r\nfor a \"good smoke.\" The Spaniards have always been great lovers of\r\ntheir minute rolls, and with them, no other method of burning tobacco\r\nappears so delicate or refined. Especially is this true among the\r\nladies, who prefer \"Seville cigarettes\" to all others. Many smokers\r\nmake their own cigarettes, sometimes using Havana tobacco, and\r\nsometimes making them of two or more kinds. An excellent cigar is made\r\nby using equal parts of Virginia and Perique tobacco, or equal parts\r\nof Havana and Perique. A fine flavored cigarette is also made from\r\nYara and Havana tobacco, equal parts of each being used. Thos. Hood\r\nhas signalized his attachment to cigar in the following pleasing\r\nlittle poem:--\r\n\r\n    THE CIGAR.\r\n\r\n    \"Some sigh for this and that,\r\n      My wishes don't go far;\r\n    The world may wag at will,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"Some fret themselves to death\r\n      With Whig and Tory jar;\r\n    I don't care which is in,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir John requests my vote,\r\n      And so does Mr. Marr;\r\n    I don't care how it does,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"Some want a German row,\r\n      Some wish a Russian war;\r\n    I care not. I'm at peace,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"I never see the Post,\r\n      I seldom read the Star;\r\n    The Globe I scarcely heed,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"Honors have come to men\r\n      My juniors at the Bar;\r\n    No matter--I can wait,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"Ambition frets me not;\r\n      A cab or glory's car\r\n    Are just the same to me,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"I worship no vain gods,\r\n      But serve the household Lar;\r\n    I'm sure to be at home,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not seek for fame,\r\n      A General with a scar;\r\n    A private let me be,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"To have my choice among\r\n      The toys of life's bazar,\r\n    The deuce may take them all,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"Some minds are often tost\r\n      By tempests like a tar;\r\n    I always seem in port,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"The ardent flame of love\r\n      My bosom cannot char,\r\n    I smoke but do not burn,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\r\n\r\n    \"They tell me Nancy Low\r\n      Has married Mr. R.;\r\n    The jilt! but I can live,\r\n      So I have my cigar.\"\r\n\r\nLord Byron, a \"good smoker\" as well as a great poet, has immortalized\r\nhis love of the cigar in the following graceful lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"Sublime Tobacco! which from east to west,\r\n  Cheers the tars labors, and the Turkman's rest--\r\n  Which on the Moslem's ottoman divides\r\n  His hours, and rivals opium and his brides;\r\n  Magnificent in Stamboul, but less grand,\r\n  Though not less loved in Wapping or the Strand;\r\n  Divine in hookhas, glorious in a pipe,\r\n  When tipped with amber, mellow, rich, and ripe,\r\n  Like other charms, wooing the caress\r\n  More dazzingly when dawning in full dress.\r\n  Yet thy true lovers more admire by far\r\n  Thy naked beauties--Give me a Cigar!\"\r\n\r\nHaving given a general description of the cigar and its mode of\r\nmanufacture, we come now to a more particular account of the various\r\nkinds known as the best and of world-wide reputation. Standing at the\r\nhead of the various kinds of cigars, either of the Old or New World,\r\nare those known to all smokers as:\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVANA CIGARS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Havanas.]\r\n\r\nThese are, by common consent, the finest in the world. They possess\r\nevery quality desirable in a cigar, and seemingly to its greatest\r\nextent. Grown in the richest portion of the tropical world, the leaf\r\nhas a rich, oily appearance, and, when made into cigars, possesses a\r\nflavor as rich as it is rare. Unlike most tobaccos suitable for\r\ncigars, every taste can be met in the Havana cigars, its many\r\nvarieties of flavor and strength suiting it alike to both sexes, and\r\nto the making of the delicate cigarette or the largest Cabanas. These\r\ncigars are made up of all the various colors and parts of the leaf,\r\nand also of all sizes common to the trade. In shape they are usually\r\nround, though sometimes pressed (flat), and in color are (according to\r\nour description) light and dark brown, light and dark red, straw\r\ncolored and dark straw colored, and some other shades or strengths. It\r\nis necessary to have all the various shades of color in order to meet\r\nthe demand for the various flavors desired. Without doubt a greater\r\nvariety of flavors can be found among Havana cigars than in any other\r\nkind, owing to the many shades of color, which determines the strength\r\nand flavor of the cigar. The Havana cigar is made of a leaf tobacco\r\nwell known for its good burning qualities, when properly cured and\r\nsweated,--burning with a clear, steady light, leaving a fine white or\r\npearl-colored ash, according to the color chosen. These cigars rarely\r\n\"char\" in burning; certainly not, if made of good quality of tobacco\r\nand thoroughly sweat. If a full-flavored cigar is desired, choose the\r\ndark colors, and the lighter if a mild cigar is preferable. The\r\nlighter the color of the tobacco the lighter the ash and the milder\r\nthe flavor of the cigar. Light-colored cigars usually burn freer and\r\nmore evenly than dark ones. In selecting a cigar for its good burning\r\nqualities, choose those (if such are to be had) covered with white\r\nspecks, or white rust; such cigars burn well, as white rust is found\r\nonly on well-ripened leaves. Select a firm, well-made cigar--one that\r\ncontains a good quantity of fillers--avoiding, however, in Havana\r\ncigars, one made _too_ nicely, as it is sometimes the case that\r\nsuperior external appearance is made to cover defects in the more\r\nimportant qualities.\r\n\r\nSuch a selection will insure a cigar of good quality; one that will\r\nhold fire and last the length of time appropriate to its size. A cigar\r\nshould not be chosen simply because it is made well, and neither\r\nbecause its outside appearance (wrapper) is fine, both in color and\r\nquality of leaf; rather depend upon the manufacture of the brand.\r\nHavana cigars have as many distinct flavors as there are colors of the\r\nleaf, ranging from very mild to very strong.\r\n\r\nThe first great requisite of a cigar is its burning quality, and the\r\nsecond its flavor; without the first the latter is of little value. A\r\ncigar made from leaf that does not burn freely will not possess any\r\ndesirable flavor, but will char and emit rank-smelling smoke, without\r\nany desirable feature whatever. When both of these qualities are in a\r\nmeasure perfect the cigar will prove to be good. There are two\r\nvarieties, at least, known as non-burning tobacco, of which we shall\r\nspeak hereafter. The flavor and burning quality of a cigar always\r\ndetermine its character, and are found in perfection in those made of\r\nfine even-colored leaf. Dark cigars have a thicker leaf or more body,\r\nand consequently are stronger than light-colored cigars. When the\r\ncigar is made of fine, well-sweat tobacco, and contains the full\r\nquantity of fillers, the pellet of ashes will be firm and strong, and\r\nshould possess the same color all through, if the filler, binder and\r\nwrapper are of the same shade of color. The finest-flavored cigars are\r\nthose of a medium shade, between a light and a dark brown,--not so\r\ndark as to be of strong, rank taste, or so mild as to be deficient in\r\na decided tobacco flavor, but simply possessing sufficient strength to\r\ngive character to the cigar.\r\n\r\n\r\nYARA CIGARS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yara cigars.]\r\n\r\nThis variety of cigars is made from tobacco grown on the Island of\r\nCuba, bearing the same name as the cigars. They are highly esteemed by\r\nthose who smoke only this kind, but are not liked by most smokers of\r\nHavana cigars. Most of them are exported to Europe, very few of them\r\nfinding their way to this country. It is somewhat difficult to compare\r\nthem with Havana cigars, as the flavor is essentially different. In\r\ncomparison with other brands made upon the Island, the Yara holds an\r\nunimportant place, yet, in some parts of Cuba, it is preferred to any\r\nother kind. In London the Yara is a favorite with many old smokers,\r\nwho use no others. Old smokers describe the Yara cigar as having a\r\n\"sweet\" flavor, but one unaccustomed to them, like Hazard and others,\r\npronounce them bitter, and having a \"peculiar saline taste.\" It can,\r\ndoubtless, be said with truth concerning the Yara cigar, that unlike\r\nother varieties, such as Havana, Manilla, Paraguayan, Swiss and\r\nBrazil, the taste for them is not natural, but, when once formed,\r\nbecomes very decided. As a general rule smokers of Yara cigars think\r\nother kinds are deficient in flavor, and are wanting in quality,\r\nbecause they lack the peculiar flavor belonging only to Yara cigars.\r\nBe this as it may, we hardly think the Yara cigar suited to the\r\ncigarist's taste at the present time. Its aromatic flavor is not\r\nadapted to the general taste, and some little time is required to\r\ndevelop a decided love for it. We prefer the \"Cubas,\" made from a good\r\nquality of leaf grown near Trinidad, Puerto-Principe, and other cities\r\neast of Havana. The peculiar flavor of Yara cigars is owing to the\r\ncharacter of the soil, rather than to any artificial process employed\r\nin manufacturing. In moistening Havana leaf Catalan wine is used, and\r\nother flavoring extracts. This may (and does) change the condition and\r\nquality of the tobacco, but even _with_ this treatment, the flavor of\r\nYara tobacco would be unlike that of Havana leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANILLA CIGARS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Manilla cigar and cheroot.]\r\n\r\nThis well-known variety of cigars is manufactured from Manilla tobacco\r\ngrown in Luzerne, one of the Philippine Islands, which is known as\r\nsuperior leaf for cigar purposes. Manilla cigars have an extensive\r\nreputation, but principally in the East and in Europe. These cigars\r\nare made in various forms and shapes, some of them are called cheroots\r\n(the term used in the East for cigars) and are principally known for\r\ntheir aromatic flavor, entirely distinct from that of Havana cigars.\r\nSome smokers think that they have the same effect as varieties of\r\ntobacco that have been moistened with the juice of the poppy, giving\r\nthe cigar a flavor like that of opium, and as a natural result,\r\nsecuring a light-colored ash. There are not as many colors of Manilla\r\ncigars as there are of Havana, and they are not as closely assorted.\r\nSome of them are a high-cinnamon color, and are far from being a\r\nstrong cigar. Their flavor is not always uniform, and is not denoted\r\nby the color as in other varieties. The flavor is not unpleasant, but\r\nis better suited to those who prefer a mild rather than a full\r\nflavored cigar. The aroma is pleasant and mild, and to those but\r\nlittle acquainted with them, agreeable. Manilla tobacco usually burns\r\nwell, if the leaf is of good quality and well sweated, still it is\r\nknown as a non-burning tobacco. As the tobacco is of good body, the\r\ncigars do not usually burn as well as other kinds. Select a\r\nlight-colored rather than a dark cigar if one of good quality is\r\ndesired. Both the cigars and cheroots are made of the same quality of\r\nleaf, and are of about the same size--differing, however, in shape.\r\nThere are but few grades of Manilla cigars, and most of them are solid\r\nand well wrapped. They are flat rather than round, and draw well but\r\ndo not hold fire like some other cigars. The leaf makes a very good\r\nwrapper for a tobacco of its thickness and strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWISS CIGARS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swiss cigars.]\r\n\r\nThese well-known cigars have but little reputation in this country,\r\nowing to the fact of their being but little known. In Europe the\r\ncigars of Luzerne have no insignificant reputation, and are generally\r\nliked by smokers who prefer a mild and agreeable cigar. These cigars\r\nare usually dark-colored, but not strong, and have but little variety\r\nof flavor. Travelers and tourists through Switzerland speak of Swiss\r\ncigars as being of agreeable flavor, and unlike any other found in\r\nEurope. With American tobacco, those of a dark color are usually\r\nstrong, but with European tobaccos this is not always the case--they\r\npossess much less strength, and can be used more freely than the\r\ntobacco of America. These cigars are usually pressed, and burn well,\r\nleaving a dark-colored ash, and emitting a fragrant odor. Most of\r\nthose used in this country may be more properly termed cheroots, both\r\nends being cut, allowing a free passage of air, which is usually the\r\ncase with all kinds of cheroots, or Eastern and European cigars. There\r\nis not that freshness of flavor to Swiss cigars peculiar to Havana's,\r\nand they lack that essential quality which renders the latter so\r\ndelicious and enjoyable. The Swiss cigar is in perfection when just\r\nmade or rolled, and such should be chosen instead of those that have\r\nbeen made for some time and closely packed and dried.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAGUAY CIGARS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paraguay cigars.]\r\n\r\nThese cigars are made of one of the finest varieties of leaf tobacco\r\nknown to commerce. Although unknown to this country--both the cigars\r\nand the leaf tobacco have a deserved reputation in Europe, and it is\r\nbeyond all question one of the finest tobaccos in the world for\r\ncigars. These cigars have a delicacy of flavor unapproachable in any\r\nother variety, and may justly be termed the finest at least of all\r\nSouth American cigars. It is one of the finest burning tobaccos in the\r\nworld, and does not fail to suit the taste of the most fastidious of\r\nsmokers. The finest are of dark color and wholly free from any rank or\r\nunpleasant taste. These cigars are uniformly mild and have but little\r\nvariety of flavor, the ash is dark-colored, firm and strong, clinging\r\nwith tenacity to the cigar, which is the best evidence of the quality\r\nof the leaf. In Paraguay they are considered superior to all other\r\nkinds and are smoked continuously without any seemingly ill effect.\r\nPage alludes to the custom of smoking as being universal, \"Men, women,\r\nand children--delicate, refined girls, and youngsters who would not\r\nwith us be promoted to the dignity of pantaloons--smoke with a gravity\r\nand gusto that is irresistibly ludicrous to a foreigner.\" The\r\nParaguayans consider excessive smoking of other tobacco as injurious\r\nbut not of the delicate flavored leaf of Paraguay. These cigars are\r\nrolled firm and strong usually small and hold fire until the entire\r\ncigar has been consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUATEMALA CIGARS.\r\n\r\nThis variety of cigars, although of excellent flavor, is hardly known\r\noutside of Central America. They are made from Guatemala tobacco--one\r\nof the few varieties of tobacco bearing white blossoms, and possessed\r\nof a similar flavor to Mexican tobacco. Although Guatemala tobacco has\r\nnot been thoroughly tested by the great manufacturers of cigars either\r\nin Europe or America, it doubtless is well suited for cigars. It is a\r\ndistinct variety from those kinds bearing pink and yellow blossoms,\r\nand its growth and quality would seem to suggest some doubt as to its\r\nquality and adaptability for cigars. Stephens and other travelers seem\r\nto regard it as tobacco of excellent quality, and allude to its\r\nconstant use by the ladies who smoke _puros_, a cigar made of a single\r\nleaf, or formed entirely of tobacco. They also use the _papelotes_\r\nwrapped in paper and sometimes in the dried leaf of maize. It would\r\nseem probable from the climate of Central America, that Guatemala\r\ntobacco would be exactly suited for the manufacture of cigars, but so\r\nlittle is known concerning it, and its cultivation is so limited, that\r\nat present it is simply a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAZILIAN CIGARS.\r\n\r\nThe cigars of Brazil, like those made of South American tobacco, are\r\nnoted for their superior flavor. They are made of \"Brazilian Aromatic\"\r\none of the finest tobaccos of Brazil. Although but little known in\r\nthis country, both the tobacco and the cigars are highly esteemed in\r\nEurope, where most of the leaf is sent. Both Brazilian cigars and the\r\ncelebrated \"Tauri Cigarettes\" possess a delicacy of flavor, described\r\nby travelers as unapproachable by any other variety of cigars and\r\ncigarettes. A late traveler says concerning them:--\"Accustomed to\r\nsmoke only Havana cigars, I was unprepared to recognize any others as\r\nbeing worthy even of the name of cigars. I was presented with a box of\r\nBrazilian cigars of commendable size and finish, of a dark color and\r\nof a good flavor, before trying them, I ignited one, merely to test\r\ntheir quality and not from any impression that they were worth even\r\nthe value of the cheapest Havanas. Great was my surprise to find them\r\nof an agreeable flavor and very pleasant to the taste.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaf is very thin, and without doubt, well suited for a cigar\r\nwrapper. The flavor of all cigars made from South American tobacco is\r\nsimilar, especially those made from tobacco grown east of the Andes. A\r\nwriter, alluding to their mode of manufacturing cigars for their own\r\nuse says:\r\n\r\n     \"They take the leaf after it is cured and ready for\r\n     manufacture into cigars, and dampen it, not with pure water\r\n     but with water containing the juice of the poppy so as to\r\n     produce the effect of opium. When prepared in this manner\r\n     they are much esteemed by the Brazilians and especially by\r\n     the herders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN CIGARS.\r\n\r\nThis was the name given to cigars made some forty or fifty years ago\r\ncomposed of Connecticut seed-leaf, or as it was then called, American\r\ntobacco. The fillers were selected from various kinds of tobacco,\r\nincluding Virginia, Kentucky, and Spanish, using for a wrapper\r\nSpanish, American or Maryland leaf. At this time the tobacco was not\r\nsorted as now, and was made up into cigars after being stripped, but\r\nthe cigars after being manufactured were kept for some time before\r\nthey were sold. At this time but little pains comparatively was taken\r\nin their manufacture: they were not assorted or shaded according to\r\nthe present standard, and were packed in chestnut instead of cedar\r\nboxes containing from one to five hundred cigars each. A manufacturer\r\nof cigars nearly fifty years ago gives the following account of his\r\nmethod:\r\n        \"We selected for wrappers those leaves having white specks\r\n     (white rust) upon them, which greatly increased the sale of\r\n     the cigars, and which were considered by smokers to be much\r\n     better than those not wound with fancy wrappers. After the\r\n     cigars were packed in the boxes a little Spanish bean was\r\n     grated upon the cigars, or a single bean was placed between\r\n     the cigars in the box.\"\r\n                             At this time some little taste was\r\nevinced for colors, and cigars of a \"bright cinnamon red,\" and\r\nafterwards, of a dark brown, were considered the finest, while leaf\r\nthat was black was considered worthless for wrappers. A kind of cigar\r\nwhich is distinctly American and which is made to a considerable\r\nextent, is called a seed cigar, and is made from tobacco grown in\r\nConnecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, or Ohio. These cigars have but\r\nlittle reputation, and are of inferior quality and manufacture. A very\r\ngood cigar, call a \"sprig cigar,\" is made from Havana and Connecticut\r\nseed-leaf filler wound with a seed wrapper which gives a good flavor\r\nsimilar to clear Havana.\r\n\r\nA full flavored cigar like a sip of rare old wine is inspiring to a\r\nlover of the \"royal plant\" and amid the sublime and companionable\r\nthoughts that its fragrance engenders, one is led oftentimes to\r\nreflect on its rare virtues and the benign effects it produces\r\nwherever known. Thus it lightens the toil of the weary laborer\r\nplodding along the highway of life. The student poring over musty\r\ntomes sees with a clearer perception as its fragrance accompanies him\r\nalong the pathway of science and of history. The poet \"as those\r\nwreathes up go\" sees Helicon's fresh founts flowing clearer and purer.\r\nThe musician \"lord of sounds,\" evokes tones from his instrument never\r\nbefore heard by mortal ear. The warrior, \"fresh from glory's field\" is\r\ncharmed by its fragrance as he dreams of shattered battalions and\r\nsleeping hosts. The farmer nurtured amid the odors of the \"balmy\r\nplant\" honors the \"useless weed\" as a promoter of happiness and an\r\nincreaser of gains. While:\r\n\r\n  \"Kings smoke when they ruminate\r\n  Over grave affairs of state.\"\r\n\r\nThe exile too, far from home and kindred smokes on as he muses of\r\nhappier hours gone never to return. And thus amid all the varied ranks\r\nand walks of life this solace of the mind and comfort of life exhales\r\nits fragrance and breathes its benedictions over all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO PLANTERS AND PLANTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grounds selected for the cultivation of tobacco are called by\r\nvarious names even in the same countries. Thus in the Connecticut\r\nValley, such lands are called tobacco fields, at the South they are\r\nknown as tobacco plantations, while in Cuba they are called Vegas or\r\ntobacco farms. In Cuba almost the entire tobacco farm is planted to\r\ntobacco while at the South and in New England this is rarely the case\r\nunless the plantations or tobacco farms are small and contain but a\r\nfew acres. In the Connecticut Valley and more especially along the\r\nbanks of the Connecticut River, where the farms are frequently small,\r\nthis is sometimes the case but farther removed from the river, where\r\nthe farms are much larger but a few acres of the best land is used for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the Connecticut Valley the tobacco fields average from one to forty\r\nacres, rarely exceeding the latter and indeed seldom including as\r\nlarge an area. The average size of tobacco fields is about five\r\nacres--sometimes all in one lot but oftener divided into several small\r\npieces on various parts of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut planter is deeply interested in the plant and gives it\r\nhis undivided attention from seed-sowing until it is sold to the\r\nspeculator or manufacturer. All other crops in his opinion are of but\r\nlittle importance compared with the great New England product, one\r\ncrop is frequently not off his hands before he is preparing for\r\nanother. The Connecticut planter stands first in the rank of tobacco\r\ngrowers; he is thoroughly acquainted with the nature of the plant and\r\nknows just what land to select and what kind of fertilizers to apply.\r\nHe has reduced the cultivation to almost an exact science and can\r\nobtain (the season being favorable) the color most desirable. He has\r\nthoroughly tested all kinds of fertilizers, and knows just what kinds\r\nwill produce the various shades of color as well as the desired\r\ntexture and size of leaf. No other tobacco planter so thoroughly\r\nunderstands the methods of curing, sweating and doing up the crop, and\r\nhe takes no little pride in showing his crop to the buyer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Connecticut tobacco field.]\r\n\r\nIt is his aim to obtain not only the best leaf for a cigar-wrapper but\r\nalso a tobacco of the finest possible flavor; hence he tries the\r\nprincipal varieties grown in Cuba, Brazil and other countries in order\r\nto judge of their quality and whether they can be cultivated with\r\nprofit on his lands. He has the best constructed sheds for hanging and\r\ncuring and the latest and most improved agricultural implements for\r\nthe cultivation of the plants. The greatest pains are taken in\r\nsecuring the crop and harvesting and handling the plants without\r\ninjuring the leaves. The tobacco fields are kept in the best possible\r\ncondition, no weeds or grass is allowed to grow and the entire\r\nsurface is as free from stones as a lawn. He usually, if his farm is\r\nsmall, plants the same field year after year, securing a much finer\r\nleaf and by yearly manuring keeping the ground fertile and in good\r\ncondition. When the tobacco is stripped the utmost care is taken to\r\nassort the leaves and he frequently shades or assorts the colors,\r\nobtaining fancy prices for such \"selections.\"\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut grower is well acquainted with the different soils,\r\nand is able to judge with considerable accuracy in regard to selecting\r\nthe right fields for tobacco. The warmest land is chosen--mellow and\r\nfree from stones or shaded by trees and prepared as if for a garden.\r\nAll of the improved methods of obtaining early plants as well as\r\ntransplanting, he adopts, and in spite of early freezing, is generally\r\nable to outwit Jack Frost, and secure the plants before this great foe\r\nof the weed ravages the fields. It may safely be said of the\r\nConnecticut planter that he secures more even crops than any other\r\ngrower of the plant, and obtains the finest colored leaf for cigar\r\nwrappers.\r\n\r\nThe growers are thoroughly informed as regards the prices, and\r\nalthough the buyers may steal suddenly upon them, are generally\r\nprepared to \"set\" a price upon their crops. Some refuse to sell on the\r\npoles, or even after it is stripped, preferring to pack their tobacco\r\nuntil it has passed through the sweat, when larger prices are\r\nobtained. Many growers not only pack their own crop, but buy up that\r\nof others, thus acting as both producer and buyer. During the growing\r\nof the crop, and particularly after it has been cured and stripped,\r\nthe growers congregate together, and talk over the condition of the\r\ncrop and the prices likely to be realized. Sometimes they form an\r\nassociation or club, agreeing to \"hold\" the tobacco for satisfactory\r\nprices, and frequently employing an agent to sell the crop. Many of\r\nthe tobacco fields or farms in the Connecticut valley are very\r\nvaluable, especially those near large cities and means of\r\ntransportation; such lands often selling for one thousand dollars per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nThe finest tobacco lands in the Connecticut valley are located in\r\nthe vicinity of Hartford about fifty miles from Long Island Sound.\r\nThese lands are near enough to the sound to get the salts in the\r\natmosphere from the south winds that blow up the valley in the precise\r\namount which the plant needs. Not much farther north does the\r\natmosphere possess this peculiar quality, while lower down the river\r\nthe salt air is too strong for the plant, and the leaves in\r\nconsequence are thick and harsh. Fine tobacco leaves can be\r\nmanufactured as well as fine broadcloth or costly silks. These results\r\ndepend in a great manner upon the proper soil and the fertilizers,\r\napplied together with the most thorough cultivation of the plants. The\r\nsoil of our best Connecticut tobacco fields is alluvial, varying in\r\ncomposition from a heavy sandy loam to a light one containing very\r\nlittle clay.\r\n\r\nFor the past few years light soil has been preferred for the tobacco\r\nfield, on account of the demand for light colored leaf. The soil can\r\nhardly be too light when leaf of a light cinnamon color is desired; as\r\nthe color of all kinds of tobacco depends upon the soil and the\r\nfertilizers used.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century since Havana tobacco commanded very high\r\nprices, both in this country and in Europe. It burnt freely and\r\npurely. The Cuban planters, although getting rich on the ordinary\r\ncrops, were not satisfied with their gains, and attempted to increase\r\ntheir crops by the use of guano and artificial fertilizers. They\r\nsecured heavier crops, but the quality became poorer. The prices fell\r\noff and the planters did not realize as much for their crops as\r\nformerly, although the growth was larger. About this time Connecticut\r\nseed leaf became known as a cigar wrapper, and in a short time took\r\nthe lead for this purpose, as it still continues to. It cured finely,\r\nburnt white and free, and in a short time brought high prices. The\r\nprofit realized from its growth led some Connecticut growers into the\r\nsame mistake as it did the Cuban planters, when they, by misguided\r\nculture, nearly ruined their crops and injured the reputation of Cuban\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nArtificial fertilizers and strong manure produce a leaf larger and\r\nheavier, but their effect on the character of the leaf is injurious,\r\nthe salts destroying its fine qualities, so that it sweats and cures\r\npoorly, and compared with the finest leaf burns dark and emits a rank\r\nand unpleasant odor.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut tobacco grower requires considerable capital when\r\nengaged extensively in the business, as ordinarily he buys large\r\nquantities of fertilizers and requires many hands to cultivate the\r\ncrop. On the largest tobacco farms the sheds or \"hanging houses\" are\r\nbuilt near or in the field, and are sometimes very large, say two or\r\nthree hundred feet in length, and capable of holding the crop of from\r\nfive to ten acres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home of the Connecticut planter.]\r\n\r\nHis broad fields of the weed can usually be seen from his house and he\r\nloves to show to visitors the plants growing in all their luxuriance,\r\nor to sit on his piazza and call attention to their waving leaves and\r\ngraceful showy tops. Few tobacco-growers can discuss the relative\r\nmerits of the numerous varieties like the Connecticut planter, and he\r\nis well acquainted not only with the various kinds grown in his own\r\ncountry but also with those of others. Indeed you may often see\r\ngrowing in his garden specimens of Cuban, Brazil or Latakia tobacco;\r\nsuch is his love for all that pertains to this great tropical plant.\r\nHe considers it one of the greatest of all the vegetable products and\r\nnever tires of lauding the plant and its use. He sincerely hates all\r\nanti-tobaccoites and has a supreme disgust for the memory of King\r\nJames I. and all royal foes of the plant. He is, however, a man of\r\nlarge and liberal views and bestows his favors with a princely hand.\r\nIf fortune frowns he may lessen his crop but never his attachment for\r\nthe plant. Amid all the cares and perplexities incident to life, he\r\npuffs away and as the ashes drop from his cigar meditates upon the\r\nprobable future of tobacco growers and all users of the weed.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut tobacco grower is in all respects a man of genuine\r\nrefinement and nobility of soul. He is always ready to give\r\ninformation on his particular system of culture, and how he obtains\r\nsuch large and fine crops. He is a good judge of leaf tobacco, and can\r\ntell in a moment the quality of his famous variety. He is thoroughly\r\nawake to modern improvements, and always willing to try new\r\nimplements, such as tobacco hangers or transplanters in his sheds or\r\nfields. He is just the person one likes to meet, jovial and\r\ngood-natured; he naturally loves the plant he cultivates and uses it\r\nfreely; lighting his after-dinner cigar or evening pipe with a gusto\r\nthat is peculiar to the grower of tobacco everywhere. Indeed he is\r\nhardly in a proper frame of mind to converse about tobacco until he\r\nlights a cigar.\r\n\r\nNo other cultivator of the soil gains as many friends as the\r\ntobacco-grower. His table is well supplied from the choicest his\r\nlarder affords and he cheerfully welcomes all to its side. He is the\r\nfriend of the poor and the companion of the rich. No meanness or low\r\nchicanery is his. His attachment for home, friends, and country is as\r\nfirm and strong as for the plant he cultivates.\r\n\r\nOlmsted in his work \"The Seaboard Slave States\" gives the following\r\ndescription of a Virginia plantation:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Negro quarters.]\r\n\r\n     \"Half an hour after this I arrived at the negro quarters--a\r\n     little hamlet of ten or twelve small and dilapidated cabins.\r\n     Just beyond them was a plain farm gate at which several\r\n     negroes were standing; one of them, a well-made man, with an\r\n     intelligent countenance and prompt manner, directed me how\r\n     to find my way to his owner's house. It was still nearly a\r\n     mile distant; and yet, until I arrived in its immediate\r\n     vicinity, I saw no cultivated field, and but one clearing.\r\n\r\n     \"In the edge of this clearing, a number of negroes, male and\r\n     female, lay stretched out upon the ground near a small\r\n     smoking charcoal pit. Their master afterwards informed me\r\n     that they were burning charcoal for the plantation\r\n     blacksmith, using the time allowed them for holidays--from\r\n     Christmas to New Years--to earn a little money for\r\n     themselves in this way. He paid them by the bushel for it.\r\n     When I said that I supposed he allowed them to take what\r\n     wood they chose for this purpose, he replied that he had\r\n     five hundred acres covered with wood, which he would be very\r\n     glad to have any one burn, or clear off in any way. Cannot\r\n     some Yankee contrive a method of concentrating some of the\r\n     valuable properties of this old field pine, so that they may\r\n     be profitably brought into use in more cultivated regions?\r\n     Charcoal is now brought from Virginia; but when made from\r\n     pine it is not very valuable, and will only bear\r\n     transportation from the banks of the navigable rivers whence\r\n     it can be shipped, at one movement to New York. Turpentine\r\n     does not flow in sufficient quantity from this variety of\r\n     the pine to be profitably collected, and for lumber it is of\r\n     very small value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The planter's home.]\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. W.'s house was an old family mansion, which he had\r\n     himself remodeled in the Grecian style, and furnished with a\r\n     large wooden portico. An oak forest had originally occupied\r\n     the ground where it stood; but this having been cleared and\r\n     the soil worn out in cultivation by the previous\r\n     proprietors, pine woods now surrounded it in every\r\n     direction; a square of a few acres only being kept clear\r\n     immediately about it. A number of the old oaks still stood\r\n     in the rear of the house, and, until Mr. W. commenced his\r\n     improvements, there had been some in its front. These,\r\n     however, he had cut away, as interfering with the symmetry\r\n     of his grounds, and in place of them had ailanthus trees in\r\n     parallel rows.\r\n\r\n     \"On three sides of the outer part of the cleared square\r\n     there was a row of large and comfortable-looking negro\r\n     quarters, stables, tobacco-houses, and other offices, built\r\n     of logs. Mr. W. was one of the few large planters, of his\r\n     vicinity, who still made the culture of tobacco their\r\n     principal business. He said there was a general prejudice\r\n     against tobacco, in all the tide water regions of the State,\r\n     because it was through the culture of tobacco that the once\r\n     fertile soil had been impoverished; but he did not believe\r\n     that, at the present value of negroes, their labor could be\r\n     applied to the culture of grain with any profit, except\r\n     under peculiarly favorable circumstances. Possibly the use\r\n     of guano might make wheat a paying crop, but he still\r\n     doubted. He had not used it, himself. Tobacco required fresh\r\n     land, and was rapidly exhausting, but it returned more\r\n     money, for the labor used upon it, than anything else;\r\n     enough more, in his opinion to pay for the wearing out of\r\n     the land. If he was well paid for it, he did not know why he\r\n     should not wear out his land. His tobacco-fields were nearly\r\n     all in a distant and lower part of his plantation; land\r\n     which had been neglected before his time, in a great\r\n     measure, because it had been sometimes flooded, and was,\r\n     much of the year, too wet for cultivation. He was draining\r\n     and clearing it, and it now brought good crops. He had had\r\n     an Irish gang draining for him, by contract. He thought a\r\n     negro could do twice as much work in a day as an Irishman.\r\n     He had not stood over them and seen them at work, but judged\r\n     entirely from the amount they accomplished: he thought a\r\n     good gang of negroes would have got on twice as fast. He was\r\n     sure they must have 'trifled' a great deal, or they would\r\n     have accomplished more than they had. He complained much of\r\n     their sprees and quarrels. I asked why he should employ\r\n     Irishmen, in preference to doing the work with his own\r\n     hands. It's dangerous work, (unhealthy!) and a negro's life\r\n     is too valuable to be risked at it. If a negro dies it's a\r\n     considerable loss, you know.' He afterwards said that his\r\n     negroes never worked so hard as to tire themselves--always\r\n     were lively, and ready to go off on a frolic at night. He\r\n     did not think they ever did half a fair day's work. They\r\n     could not be made to work hard: they never would lay out\r\n     their strength freely, and it was impossible to make them do\r\n     it. This is just what I have thought when I have seen slaves\r\n     at work--they seem to go through the motions of labor\r\n     without putting strength into them. They keep their powers\r\n     in reserve for their own use at night, perhaps.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. W. also said that he cultivated only the coarser and\r\n     lower-priced sorts of tobacco, because the finer sorts\r\n     required more pains-taking and discretion than it was\r\n     possible to make a large gang of negroes use. 'You can make\r\n     a nigger work,' be said, 'but you cannot make him think.'\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the early tobacco culture of Virginia, he says:--\r\n\r\n     The light, rich mould resting on the sandy soil of Eastern\r\n     Virginia was exactly suited to the cultivation of tobacco,\r\n     and no better climate for this plant was to be found on the\r\n     globe. This had just been sufficiently proved, and a\r\n     suitable method of culture learned experimentally, when the\r\n     land was offered to individual proprietors by the king,\r\n     (James I.) Very little else was to be obtained from the soil\r\n     which would be of value to send to Europe, without an\r\n     application to it of a higher degree of art than the slaves,\r\n     or stupid, careless servants of the proprietors could\r\n     readily be forced to use. Although tobacco had been\r\n     introduced into England but a few years, an enormous number\r\n     of persons had initiated themselves in the appreciation of\r\n     its mysterious value.\r\n\r\n     \"The king, having taken a violent prejudice against it,\r\n     though he saw no harm in the distillation of grain, had\r\n     forbidden that it should be cultivated in England. Virginia,\r\n     therefore, had every advantage to supply the demand.\r\n     Merchants and the super-cargoes of ships, arriving with\r\n     slaves from Africa, or manufactured goods, spirits, or other\r\n     luxuries from England, very gladly bartered them with the\r\n     planters for tobacco, but for nothing else. Tobacco,\r\n     therefore, stood for money, and the passion for raising it,\r\n     to the exclusion of everything else, became a mania, like\r\n     the 'California fever' of 1849.\r\n\r\n     \"The culture being once established, there were many reasons\r\n     growing out of the social structure of the colony, which,\r\n     for more than a century, kept the industry of the Virginians\r\n     confined to this one staple. These reasons were chiefly the\r\n     difficulty of breaking the slaves, or training the\r\n     bond-servants to new methods of labor, the want of\r\n     enterprise or ingenuity of the proprietors to contrive other\r\n     profitable occupations for them, and the difficulty or\r\n     expense of distributing the guard or oversight, without\r\n     which it was impossible to get any work done at all, if the\r\n     laborers were separated, or worked in any other way than\r\n     side by side, in gangs, as in the tobacco-fields.\r\n\r\n     \"Owing to these causes the planters kept on raising tobacco\r\n     with hardly sufficient intermission to provide sustenance,\r\n     though often, by reason of the excessive quantity raised,\r\n     scarcely anything could be got for it. Tobacco is not now\r\n     considered peculiarly and excessively exhaustive; in a\r\n     judicious rotation, especially as a preparation for wheat,\r\n     it is an admirable fallow crop, and, under a scientific\r\n     system of agriculture, it is grown with no continued\r\n     detriment to the soil. But in Virginia it was grown without\r\n     interruption or alternation, and the plantations rapidly\r\n     deteriorated in fertility. As they did so, the crops grew\r\n     smaller in proportion to the labor expended upon them; yet,\r\n     from the continued importation of laborers, the total crops\r\n     of the colony increased annually, and the market value fell\r\n     proportionately to the better supply.\r\n\r\n     \"With smaller return for labor and lower prices, the\r\n     planters soon found themselves bankrupt, instead of nabobs.\r\n     How could they help themselves? Only by forcing the\r\n     merchants to pay them higher prices. But how to do that,\r\n     when every planter had his crop pledged in advance, and was\r\n     obliged to hurry it off at any price he could get for it, in\r\n     order to pay for his food, and drink, and clothing, and to\r\n     keep his head above water at credit for the following year.\r\n     The crop supplied more tobacco than was needed, but no one\r\n     man would cease to plant it, or lessen his crop for the\r\n     general good. Then it was agreed all men must be made to do\r\n     so, and the colonial legislature was called upon to make\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     \"Acts were accordingly passed to prevent any planter from\r\n     cultivating more than a certain number of plants to each\r\n     hand he employed in labor, and prescribing the number of\r\n     leaves which might be permitted to ripen upon each plant\r\n     permitted to be grown. An inspection of all tobacco, after\r\n     it had been prepared for market, was decreed, and the\r\n     inspectors were bound by oath, after having rejected all of\r\n     inferior quality, to divide the good into two equal parts,\r\n     and then to burn and destroy one of them. Thus, it was\r\n     expected the quantity of tobacco offered for sale would be\r\n     so small that merchants would be glad to pay better prices\r\n     for it, and the planters would be relieved of their\r\n     embarrassment.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. M. P. Handy gives the following interesting sketch, entitled \"On\r\nthe Tobacco Plantation\":--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Burning the patch.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"Riding through Southside, Virginia, any warm, bright\r\n     winter's day after Christmas, the stranger may be startled\r\n     to see a dense column of smoke rising from the forest\r\n     beyond. He anxiously inquires of the first person he\r\n     meets--probably a negro--if the woods are on fire. Cuffee\r\n     shows his white teeth in a grin that is half amusement, half\r\n     contempt, as he answers: 'No, sar, deys jis burnin' a\r\n     plant-patch.' For this is the first step in tobacco-culture.\r\n\r\n     \"A sunny, sheltered spot on the southern slope of a hill is\r\n     selected, one protected from northern winds by the\r\n     surrounding forest, but open to the sun in front, and here\r\n     the hot-bed for the reception of the seed is prepared. All\r\n     growth is felled within the area needed, large dead logs are\r\n     dragged and heaped on the ground as for a holocaust, the\r\n     whole ignited, and the fire kept up until nothing is left of\r\n     the immense wood-heap but circles of the smoldering ashes.\r\n     These are afterward carefully plowed in; the soil,\r\n     fertilized still further, if need be, is harrowed and\r\n     prepared as though for a garden-bed, and the small brown\r\n     seed sown, from which is to spring the most widely-used of\r\n     man's useless luxuries. Later, when the spring fairly opens,\r\n     and the young plants in this primitive hot-bed are large and\r\n     strong enough to bear transplanting, the Virginian draws\r\n     them, as the New Englander does his cabbages, and plants\r\n     them in like manner, in hills from two to four feet apart\r\n     each way. Lucky is he whose plant-bed has escaped the fly,\r\n     the first enemy of the precious weed. Its attacks are made\r\n     upon it in the first stage of its existence, and are more\r\n     fatal, because less easily prevented, than those of the\r\n     tobacco-worm, that scourge, _par excellence_, of the tobacco\r\n     crop. Farmers often lose their entire stock of plants, and\r\n     are forced to send miles to beg or buy of a more fortunate\r\n     planter. Freshly-cleared land--'new ground,' as the negroes\r\n     call it--makes the best tobacco-field, and on this and the\r\n     rich lowlands throughout Southside is raised the staple\r\n     known through the world as James River tobacco.\r\n\r\n     \"On this crop the planter lavishes his choicest fertilizers;\r\n     for the ranker the growth, the longer and larger the leaf,\r\n     the greater is the value thereof, though the manufacturers\r\n     complain bitterly of the free use of guano, which, they say,\r\n     destroys the resinous gum on which the value of the leaf\r\n     depends. Once set, the young plant must contend, not only\r\n     with the ordinary risk of transplanting, but the cut-worm is\r\n     now to be dreaded. Working underground, it severs the stem\r\n     just above the root, and the first intimation of its\r\n     presence is the prone and drooping plant. For this there is\r\n     no remedy, except to plant and replant, until the tobacco\r\n     itself kills the worm. In one instance, which came under our\r\n     observation, a single field was replanted six times before\r\n     the planter succeeded in getting 'a good stand,' as they\r\n     call it on the plantations; but this was an extreme case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stringing the primings.]\r\n\r\n     \"When the plants are fairly started in their growth, the\r\n     planter tops and primes them, processes performed, the first\r\n     by pinching off the top bud, which would else run to seed,\r\n     and the second by removing the lower leaves of each plant,\r\n     leaving bare a space of some inches near the ground, and\r\n     retaining from six to a dozen stout, well-formed leaves on\r\n     each stem, according to the promise of the soil and season,\r\n     and these leaves form the crop. The rejected lower leaves or\r\n     primings, in the days of slavery, formed one of the\r\n     mistress' perquisites and were carefully collected by the\r\n     'house-gang,' as the force was styled, strung on small\r\n     sharp sticks like exaggerated meat-skewers, and cured, first\r\n     in the sun, afterwards in the barn, often placing a pretty\r\n     penny in her private purse. Now when all labor must be paid\r\n     for in money, they are not worth collecting, and, except\r\n     when some thrifty freedman has a large family which he\r\n     wishes to turn to account, are left to wither where they\r\n     fall.\r\n\r\n     \"There is absolutely no rest on a large tobacco plantation,\r\n     one step following another in the cultivation of the\r\n     troublesome weed--the last year's crop is rarely shipped to\r\n     market before the seed must be sown for the next--and\r\n     planting and replanting, topping and priming, suckering and\r\n     worming, crowd on each other through all the summer months.\r\n     Withal the ground must be rigidly kept free from grass and\r\n     weeds, and after the plants have attained any size this must\r\n     be done by hoe; horse and plow would break and bruise the\r\n     brittle leaves.\r\n\r\n     \"'Suckering' is performed by removing every leaf-bud which\r\n     the plant throws out after the priming (and topping), thus\r\n     retaining all its sap and strength for the development of\r\n     the leaves already formed, and this must be done again and\r\n     again through the whole season. Worming is still more\r\n     tedious and unremitting. In the animal kingdom there are\r\n     three creatures, and three only, to whom tobacco is not\r\n     poisonous--man, a goat found among the Andes, and the\r\n     tobacco-worm. This last is a long, smooth-skinned worm, its\r\n     body formed of successive knobs or rings, furnished each\r\n     with a pair of legs, large prominent eyes, and is in color\r\n     as green as the leaf upon which it feeds. It is found only\r\n     on the under side of the leaves, every one of which must be\r\n     carefully lifted and examined for its presence. Women make\r\n     better wormers than men, probably because they are more\r\n     patient and painstaking. When caught the worm is pulled\r\n     apart between the thumb and finger, for crushing it in the\r\n     soft mold of the carefully cultivated fields is impossible.\r\n     Carelessness in worming was an unpardonable offence in the\r\n     days of slavery, and was frequently punished with great\r\n     severity. An occasional penalty on some plantations--very\r\n     few, in justice to Virginia planters be it said--was to\r\n     compel the delinquent wormer to bite in two the disgusting\r\n     worm discovered in his or her row by the lynx-eyed overseer.\r\n     Valuable coadjutors in this work are the housewife's flock\r\n     of turkeys, which are allowed the range of the tobacco lots\r\n     near the house, and which destroy the worms by scores. The\r\n     moth, whose egg produces these larvæ, is a large white\r\n     miller of unusual size and prolificness. Liberal and kind\r\n     masters would frequently offer the negro children a reward\r\n     for every miller captured, and many were the pennies won in\r\n     this way. One of these insects, placed one evening under an\r\n     inverted tumbler, was found next morning to have deposited\r\n     over two hundred eggs on the glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Worming.]\r\n\r\n     \"As the plant matures the leaves grow heavy, and, thick with\r\n     gum, droop gracefully over from the plant. Then as they\r\n     ripen, one by one the plants are cut, some inches below the\r\n     first leaves, with short stout knives,--scythe or reaper is\r\n     useless here,--and hung, heads down, on scaffolds, in the\r\n     open air, till ready to be taken to the barn. A Virginia\r\n     tobacco-barn is totally unlike any other building under the\r\n     sun. Square as to the ground plan, its height is usually\r\n     twice its width and length. In the center of the bare\r\n     earthen floor is the trench for firing; around the sides\r\n     runs a raised platform for placing the leaves in bulk; and,\r\n     commencing at a safe distance from the fire, up to the top\r\n     of the tall building, reach beams stretching across for the\r\n     reception of the tobacco-sticks, thick pine laths, from\r\n     which are suspended the heavy plants. Safely housed and\r\n     beyond all danger of the frost, whose slightest touch is\r\n     sufficient to blacken and destroy it, the crop is now ready\r\n     for firing, and through the late autumn days blue clouds of\r\n     smoke hover over and around the steep roofs of the tall\r\n     tobacco-barns. A stranger might suppose the buildings on\r\n     fire, but not a blaze is within, the object here, as in\r\n     bacon-curing, being _smoke_, not _fire_.\r\n\r\n     \"For this the old field-pine is eschewed, and the planter\r\n     draws on his stock of oak and hickory-trees. Many use\r\n     sassafras and sweet gum in preference to all other woods for\r\n     this purpose, under the impression that they improve the\r\n     flavor of the tobacco-leaf. When the leaves, fully cured,\r\n     have taken the rich brown hue of the tobacco of commerce, so\r\n     unlike the deep green of the growing plant that a person\r\n     familiar with the one would never recognize the other as the\r\n     same plant, the planter must fold his hands and wait until\r\n     they are in condition for what is technically known as\r\n     striking, i. e., taking down from the rafters on which they\r\n     are suspended. Touch the tobacco when too dry and it\r\n     crumbles, disturb it when too high or damp, and its value\r\n     for shipping is materially lessened, while if handled in too\r\n     cold weather it becomes harsh. But there comes a mild damp\r\n     spell, and the watchful planter seizing the right moment,\r\n     since tobacco, like time and tide, waits for no man, musters\r\n     all the force he can command for the work of stripping and\r\n     stemming. This done, the leaves are sorted and tied in\r\n     bundles, several being held in one hand, while around the\r\n     stalk-end of the cluster is wrapped another leaf, the loose\r\n     end of which is tucked through the center of the bundle.\r\n     Great care is taken in this operation not to break the leaf,\r\n     and oil or lard is freely used in the work. During this\r\n     process the crop is divided into the various grades of\r\n     commerce from 'long bright' leaf to 'lugs' the lowest grade\r\n     known to manufacturers. These last are not packed into\r\n     hogsheads, but are sent loose, and sold without the trouble\r\n     of prizing, in the nearest market-town.\r\n\r\n     \"Shades imperceptible to a novice, serve to determine the\r\n     value of the leaf. As it varies in color, texture, and\r\n     length, so fluctuates its market price, and at least half\r\n     the battle lies in the manner in which the crop has been\r\n     handled in curing. From the mountainous counties of\r\n     South-western Virginia, Franklin, Henry, and Patrick, comes\r\n     all the rarest and the most valuable tobacco, 'fancy\r\n     wrappers' but these crops are smaller in proportion to those\r\n     raised along the lowlands of the rivers. This tobacco is\r\n     much lighter in color, much softer in texture, than the\r\n     ordinary staple, and is frequently as soft and fine as silk.\r\n     Some years ago a bonnet made of this tobacco was exhibited\r\n     at the Border Agricultural Fair, and had somewhat the\r\n     appearance of brown silk. Only one such plant have I ever\r\n     seen grown in Southside, and that, a bright golden brown,\r\n     and nearly two feet in length, was carefully preserved for\r\n     show on the parlor-mantel of the planter who raised it.\r\n\r\n     \"After tying, the bundles are placed in bulk, and when again\r\n     'in order,' are 'prized' or packed into the hogsheads,--no\r\n     smoothly-planed and iron-hooped cask, by the way, but huge\r\n     pine structures very roughly made. The old machine for\r\n     prizing was a primitive affair, the upright beam through\r\n     which ran another at right angles, turning slightly on a\r\n     pivot, heavily weighted at one end, and used as a lever for\r\n     compressing the brown mass into the hogsheads. Now, most\r\n     well-to-do planters own a tobacco straightener and\r\n     screw-press, inventions which materially lessen the manual\r\n     labor of preparing the crop for market. Each hogshead is\r\n     branded with the name of the owner, and thus shipped to his\r\n     commission-merchant, when the hogshead is 'broken' by\r\n     tearing off a stave, thus exposing the strata of the bulk to\r\n     view. Of late years some planters have been guilty of\r\n     'nesting,' or placing prime leaf around the outer part and\r\n     an inferior article in the center of the hogshead.\r\n\r\n     \"At a tobacco mart in Southside, occurred perhaps the only\r\n     instance of negro-selling since the establishment of the\r\n     Freedman's Bureau. At every town is a huge platform scale\r\n     for weighing wagon and load, deducting the weight of the\r\n     former from the united weight of both to find the quantity\r\n     of tobacco offered for sale. A small planter has brought a\r\n     lot of loose tobacco to market, which, being sold, was\r\n     weighed in this manner, and for which the purchaser was\r\n     about to pay, when a bystander quietly remarked, 'You forgot\r\n     to weigh the nigger.' An explanation followed, and the\r\n     tobacco, re-weighed, was found short 158 lbs., or the exact\r\n     weight of the colored driver, who had, unobserved, been\r\n     standing on the scales behind the cart while the first\r\n     weighing took place.\r\n\r\n     \"Thirty years or more ago--before the Danville and Southside\r\n     Railroads were built--the tobacco was principally carried to\r\n     market on flat-boats, and the refrain to a favorite negro\r\n     song was:--\r\n\r\n          \"'Oh, I'm gwine down to Town!\r\n            An' I'm gwine down to Town!\r\n            I'm gwine down to Richmond Town\r\n            To cayr my 'bacca down!'\r\n\r\n     \"Then all along the rivers, at every landing, was a tobacco\r\n     warehouse, the ruins of some of which may still be seen.\r\n     With no crop has the Emancipation Act interfered so much as\r\n     with this, and the old tobacco planters will tell you with a\r\n     sigh that tobacco no longer yields them the profits it once\r\n     did: the manufacturers are the only people who make fortunes\r\n     on it now-a-days; $12 per hundred is the lowest price which\r\n     pays for the raising, and few crops average that now. Still\r\n     every farmer essays its culture, every freedman has his\r\n     email tobacco patch by his cabin door, and the Indian weed\r\n     is still the great staple of Eastern Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nThe first planters of tobacco at the West were the Ohioans, who began\r\nits culture about fifty years ago. From the first they have taken much\r\ninterest in the plant, and as the result of many experiments not only\r\nproduce seed leaf, but the finest cutting leaf grown in this country.\r\nThe Ohio tobacco growers have shown a spirit of enterprise in this\r\ndirection that is as commendable as it is rare. While they have not\r\ntested the great tropical varieties like their brother tobacco growers\r\nof Connecticut, they have succeeded in producing a leaf for cutting\r\nthat is the admiration of the world. At first their experiments were\r\nunsuccessful, and the early growers were ridiculed for entertaining\r\nthe belief that tobacco could be grown at the West. Yet despite all\r\nobjections and seeming failures, the growers continued its cultivation\r\nuntil it has become one of the great products of the State. Of late\r\nthe Ohio growers have demonstrated that their soil is better adapted\r\nfor the finer grades of cutting leaf, than for seed leaf or even the\r\nmore common \"cinnamon blotch.\"\r\n\r\nThe soil is rich, and an experience of half a century has at length\r\ngiven them a thorough knowledge of the plant and the most successful\r\nmodes of cultivation. In appearance an Ohio tobacco field resembles\r\nthose of the Connecticut valley--the leaf is large, and though\r\ncoarser, cures down a dark rich brown, like \"cinnamon blotch,\" or a\r\nlight yellow, the color of the famous \"white tobacco.\" The Ohio\r\ngrowers have taken much pains with the Ohio broad leaf, and have\r\nproduced a seed leaf tobacco that in many respects is a superior\r\nwrapper for cigars. While it does not possess the fine texture of\r\nConnecticut seed leaf it still has many good qualities, and with the\r\ncareful culture given it will doubtless become still finer as a leaf\r\ntobacco, for wrapping cigars. But it is in the production of cutting\r\nleaf that the Ohio growers take rank, and ere long will supply the\r\nvast demand made upon them for their great cutting variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ohio tobacco field.]\r\n\r\nWith a degree of pride peculiar to all tobacco growers, (when any new\r\nvariety has originated,) they point with no little egotism to their\r\nfields of \"white tobacco,\" and ask their fellow-growers of New England\r\nto rival this \"great plant.\" So successful have they been of late with\r\ncutting leaf, that their fields yield them returns not inferior to\r\nmany of the choicest tobacco farms on the Connecticut River. The Ohio\r\ngrowers have one advantage over earlier growers of the plant--their\r\nland has not been cultivated as long as the famous tobacco lands of\r\nthe Connecticut valley, and does not require that thorough fertilizing\r\nwhich is so necessary in New England. Still the tobacco field cannot\r\nbe too thoroughly prepared for the growth of tobacco, whether in the\r\ntropics or in the more temperate regions.\r\n\r\nIn the curing of tobacco, the Ohio growers have but few equals, and no\r\nsuperiors. At first, the complaint made by the buyers of Ohio tobacco\r\nwas, that \"Ohio tobacco has the appearance of being too hard fired,\r\nindeed so much so as to have the flavor of being baked.\" The early\r\nculture of tobacco in the State attracted the attention of tobacco\r\nbuyers, especially those who had dealt largely in Maryland leaf, and\r\nso much so, that one large firm issued a circular and sent to all the\r\nprominent growers in the tobacco growing section giving instructions\r\nin regard to its cultivation and management. We copy from one lying\r\nbefore us, and dated 1842. It reads as follows:\r\n                                                \"As tobacco is every\r\n     year becoming a more prominent article in your State, we\r\n     deem it of so much importance that we have had this circular\r\n     printed on the subject of its Cultivation and Management,\r\n     and take the liberty to address it to you. New ground\r\n     produces the finest and highest priced tobacco. The plants\r\n     should be set about 2 feet 9 inches or three feet apart,\r\n     which will give them sufficient air and sun to ripen, and\r\n     give the leaf a good body. It should be topped as soon as it\r\n     buttons, kept clear of suckers, and cut as soon as it is\r\n     ripe--if favorable weather, it will be fit for the house in\r\n     15 to twenty days after it is topped.\r\n\r\n     \"When cut, let it remain until sufficiently lank to handle\r\n     without breaking; but it should be housed before it is\r\n     sun-killed, or much deadened, to prevent which, put it up in\r\n     small heaps, say as much as a man can carry, with the heads\r\n     to the sun, as soon as cut, and even then the top plants may\r\n     be too much deadened, unless soon removed to the house. If\r\n     sun-killed, it will not cure fine. The Maryland system is to\r\n     fire without flues, and when the precaution is taken to lay\r\n     planks or boards directly over the fire, accidents seldom\r\n     occur.\r\n\r\n     \"Slow fires are kept up for the first four or five days\r\n     after the house is filled, so as to give it a moderate heat\r\n     throughout, until the Tobacco is generally yellow, then the\r\n     fires are raised or increased so as to kill the leaf and\r\n     stem in forty-eight hours or less. When cured on the stock,\r\n     as is done in Maryland, it can be better assorted, or the\r\n     different qualities more readily separated than when\r\n     stripped in the field and cured in the leaf. When stripping\r\n     and tying up in bundles, it should be assorted according to\r\n     the following classifications: 1st, Fine Yellow; 2d, Yellow;\r\n     3d, Spangled; 4th, Fine Red; 5th, Good Red; 6th, Brown and\r\n     Common. It is often put up as if there were but two or three\r\n     qualities, hence there is a great mixture of the several\r\n     sorts, which is a very serious disadvantage in selling, as\r\n     the purchaser generally values it at the price of the most\r\n     inferior in the sample.\r\n\r\n     \"The process of curing unfired, or air-dried tobacco, is\r\n     similar to the above, except the firing; when so cured, it\r\n     is more difficult to condition, so as to make it keep; but\r\n     it generally sells quite as well. Planters should be very\r\n     careful to have their Tobacco in good dry condition when\r\n     they deliver it to the dealer or purchaser, as it is\r\n     all-important to him to receive it free from dampness or\r\n     moisture, which bruises it and injures its quality. We think\r\n     such management as directed above would raise the value of\r\n     Ohio tobacco as high as similar quality of Maryland.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco warehouse.]\r\n\r\nAs when first cultivated, the Ohio growers still select new land as\r\nthe best adapted for tobacco, though not as easy of cultivation. When\r\nthe tobacco growers are ready for preparing their \"new ground\" they\r\ninvite in their friends and neighbors, and the field is \"grubbed\" in a\r\nshort time. \"Grubbing Day,\" with the young people, is an event of no\r\ncommon interest; the farmers gather from the adjoining farms and with\r\nmirth and muscle soon render the field fit for the \"Indian herb.\" In\r\nthe evening, the planter's home is filled with the young people, bent\r\non having a right good time, and with \"stripping the willow\" and other\r\ngames, close the day if not the night in the most enjoyable manner.\r\nMany of the country merchants take the tobacco of the growers when in\r\ncondition to handle, paying them (or at least a portion of it,) in\r\ngoods, or purchasing the tobacco as they do other merchandise. They\r\nhave large warehouses where they receive and pack the tobacco until\r\nshipped to market. In the early Spring the growers take their tobacco\r\nto the workhouses, where it is packed by the merchants who frequently\r\nhave a claim on the crop for advances made on the same.\r\n\r\nHaving given a description of the Connecticut, Virginia and Ohio\r\ntobacco growers, we come now to the most extensive cultivators of\r\ntobacco in America--the Kentuckians. With the exception of the\r\nVirginians they are the oldest growers of the plant in the United\r\nStates,[65] and are confessedly among the most thorough cultivators of\r\nthe plant in the world. The soil of Kentucky is admirably adapted for\r\nthe great staple, and along the banks of the Green River may be seen\r\nthe largest tobacco fields in the world. The plant attains a large\r\nsize, and grows with a luxuriance common to all products grown in the\r\nfamous \"blue grass\" region.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 65: Kentucky was originally a part of\r\n              Virginia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kentucky tobacco plantation.]\r\n\r\nThe system adopted by the Kentucky growers is similar to that adopted\r\nby all growers of cut tobacco, and the fine quality of Kentucky\r\n\"selections\" has deservedly gained the leaf a reputation that must\r\nplace it in the front rank of American tobacco. The vast quantity\r\ngrown in the state is an evidence not only of the good quality of\r\nKentucky tobacco, but of the adaptation of the soil and of the method\r\nof cultivation in use. As a cut tobacco, Kentucky-leaf is held in the\r\nhighest esteem, the exportation of the leaf to all parts of Europe\r\ngaining for it a reputation hardly equaled by any Southern tobacco.\r\nThe system of cultivation is similar to that pursued by the Virginian,\r\nand the same process of curing is also adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky growers generally succeed in getting a \"good stand\" and\r\nwhen once the plants have commenced to grow they come forward with a\r\nrapidity that is truly astonishing. The soil of Kentucky is well\r\nadapted for the production of the largest varieties of tobacco as well\r\nas the finest grades of cutting leaf. Much attention is paid to the\r\nselection of soil, that the light standard of Kentucky leaf may be\r\nfurther advanced. On the large plantations a vast amount of tobacco is\r\ngrown, in some instances equaling the entire product of some of the\r\ntobacco-growing towns in the Connecticut Valley. The tobacco is packed\r\nin hogsheads, each one containing twelve hundred pounds, the same as\r\nin Virginia and Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky planter prides himself on the superior quality of\r\ntobacco, as well as his famous blooded stock. If there is anything\r\nmore remarkable than the high character of the latter, it must\r\ncertainly be the renowned plant which has given the wealthy planters\r\nof Kentucky a national popularity among all cultivators of tobacco.\r\nThe Kentuckians are thorough in all of their methods of cultivation,\r\nand with the first stock and tobacco farms in the country bid fair to\r\nachieve still further honors as \"tillers of the soil.\" Possessed of\r\nthe largest means, they have brought their farms up to a high state of\r\ncultivation, and produce in their famous valleys the very finest of\r\nNature's products.\r\n\r\nKentucky planters are men of the largest endowments; Nature, in her\r\ngifts to them has been most lavish, and the princely fortunes which\r\nthey have acquired shows how well they have benefited by her\r\nmunificence. In manners affable, and in benevolence unsurpassed, the\r\nKentucky planter gains the plaudits of all. He is polite to both\r\nfriend and foe, and possessed with all of that polished manner which\r\nmarks the true gentleman, and especially all growers of the \"kingly\r\nplant.\" Easy of approach, he has still that reserve that bids all\r\nsycophants mark well their conduct and demeanor. On the plantation or\r\nat the race, the Kentuckian is ever in his best mood for recreation\r\nand enjoyment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Kentucky planter.]\r\n\r\nHis attachment for the horse has developed qualities of patience and\r\nthoroughness that are shown elsewhere than on the \"course.\" Benefiting\r\nby years of training and study, the success that follows his efforts\r\nshows at once that such talents are not confined to a single field of\r\noperations. In many respects like the Virginia planter, they differ\r\nsomewhat in their taste in all that pertains to the turf and the\r\nfield. But we would not lose sight, among his many noble traits of\r\ncharacter, of that love of his State that pre-eminently characterizes\r\nthe Kentuckian. He is justly proud of her soil and of her sons, and\r\nwhether in the halls of Congress or on the field of carnage and blood,\r\nfears not to maintain the honor and safety of the one and the other.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to one acquainted with the growth of tobacco and the\r\nvalue of the Southern States for its production that so small an area\r\nof land is devoted to its culture in Georgia, Florida and Louisiana.\r\nWhen owned by Spain, West Florida was noted for its tobacco, and\r\nproduced large quantities which were exported to Spain and France. The\r\nsoil of Florida is well adapted for tobacco, and the rich hummock\r\nlands produce an excellent quality for cigars, not unlike Havana leaf.\r\nIts cultivation has been tried in various parts of the State, but the\r\nresult has not warranted its cultivation to any great extent\r\nexcepting in Gadsden County where the plant flourishes as well as in\r\nCuba.\r\n\r\nThe seed used in Havana and the plant resembles it so closely that\r\neven Cuban planters cannot distinguish it from that grown on the\r\nisland. The mode of cultivation is nearly the same, and the soil is\r\nsaid to produce a leaf of tobacco similar to that of the celebrated\r\nVuelta de Albajo. Formerly the product was sent to New Orleans, and\r\nthe leaf was pronounced by some dealers to be bitter, but most of them\r\nconsidered it valuable. The planter selects the high lands or\r\nhummocks, the soil of which is light and rich for the tobacco field.\r\nThe plants are carefully drawn from the bed, and transplanted\r\nafterwards. The mode of culture is to plow between the rows and hoe\r\nthe plants carefully.\r\n\r\nA Florida tobacco field in appearance is not unlike a _vega_, or Cuba\r\ntobacco field; the same luxuriant growth of the forest may be seen on\r\nevery hand, and the \"queen of herbs\" grows underneath or near the\r\nfragrant Orange and the stately Magnolia. The soil of Gadsden County\r\nis in some respects unlike that of the rest of the State in that there\r\nis an entire absence of limestone, which is found elsewhere all\r\nthrough Florida. The climate of the State is well adapted for the\r\ngrowth of tobacco, and is less changeable on the Gulf side than along\r\nthe Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nFormerly larger crops were raised than now. Under the old _régime_\r\nwhen on every plantation were a score or more of idle negro urchins, a\r\nlarge portion of the labor could be performed by them, such as\r\nworming, dropping the plants, and picking up the primings, while now\r\nthe labor has to be paid for in money or its equivalent. At this time,\r\nthe \"wrapper leaf\" was considered to be among the best for cigars, and\r\nbrought high prices. In the days of slavery, tobacco was considered to\r\nbe as profitable as the cotton crop, and good tobacco plantations were\r\nconsidered to be the most valuable in the State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Florida tobacco plantation.]\r\n\r\nThis peculiar tobacco region is without doubt capable, with proper\r\nmanagement, of producing a superior article for cigars, both wrappers\r\nand fillers, and when grown on \"new ground\" the staple is exceedingly\r\nfine. The leaf cures as rapidly, and is of as good color as in Cuba,\r\nand in a favorable season and when harvested fully ripe, is destitute\r\nof that bitter taste formerly ascribed to it. The plants grow large,\r\nand have that smooth, shiny appearance peculiar to Havana tobacco, the\r\nleaves growing erect, and frequently covered with \"specks\" or \"white\r\nrust,\" one of the best evidences of a fine flavored and a good-burning\r\ntobacco. A Florida tobacco-grower gives the following account of the\r\nplant:\r\n\r\n     \"The Gadsden 'wrapper-leaf' was always in high repute, and\r\n     extensively used in the manufacture of cigars, being in\r\n     size, firmness, and texture fully equal to the best Cuba,\r\n     and far superior to the Connecticut seed-leaf. Where the\r\n     variety known as the Cuba filler has been tried, it has\r\n     succeeded finely in this county, possessing that delicate\r\n     and peculiar aroma so highly prized in the Havana cigars. We\r\n     need but the capital to make the most profitable crop that\r\n     is grown. It is a fact, that of all the counties of the\r\n     State, many of them abounding in the very finest soil,\r\n     Gadsden is the only one that has succeeded in making the\r\n     Cuba tobacco a staple market-crop. Prior to 1860 it rivaled\r\n     in net returns the great staple cotton, and from present\r\n     indications, it is about to resume its former status among\r\n     the great agricultural products of the country.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Whether this success is attributable to any peculiarity in\r\n     the elements of the soil, I am not able to determine, but\r\n     this fact is worthy of note, that, except immediately on the\r\n     banks of the Apalachicola River, which forms the Western\r\n     boundary of the County, there is an entire absence of the\r\n     rotten limestone which so largely pervades the other\r\n     sections of the State. For the planter of limited means,\r\n     there is no crop so well suited to his condition as the Cuba\r\n     tobacco. To produce a given result there is a less area of\r\n     land required than is demanded for the production of any\r\n     other field crop. The cultivation, harvesting, and\r\n     preparation for market is simple, and the labor so light\r\n     that it may be participated in by every member of the\r\n     family, male and female, over six years of age. The growth\r\n     of the plant is so rapid, and its arrival at maturity so\r\n     quick, that it never interferes with any of the provision\r\n     crops, and rarely with a moderate cotton crop.\"\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana the tobacco plant flourishes well and grows as well and\r\nas luxuriantly as sugar cane. Even along the banks of the Mississippi\r\nthe plants attain good size, and succeed as finely as in some of the\r\nother parishes in the interior of the State. The Perique and Louisiana\r\ntobacco are the principal varieties cultivated, and attain nearly the\r\nsize of Connecticut seed leaf. In St. James parish the soil seems well\r\nadapted for Perique tobacco, and here it readily takes on that black\r\nhue that is one of the peculiar features of this singular variety. In\r\nCoddo parish tobacco is cultivated to some extent, but does not\r\nproduce a leaf equal to that grown in St. James Parish. The tobacco\r\ngrown in the Parishes of Bossier and Natchitoches is used chiefly by\r\nthe growers of the parishes and is fitted for both smoking and snuff.\r\n\r\nThe Louisiana planters have adopted the method of the French in doing\r\nup their tobacco--twisting it in rolls, or as the French call them,\r\n\"Carrots.\" The planters of St. James Parish annually put up from ten\r\nto fourteen thousand carrots of Perique, each carrot weighing about\r\nfour pounds.\r\n\r\nMr. Perique, from whom the tobacco takes its name, made many\r\nimprovements in the manner of preparing the tobacco for market, one\r\nof which consisted in taking up the twisted lumps (after remaining in\r\npress for six months), spreading them to fifteen or sixteen inches in\r\nlength and having completed four pounds in weight, rolling it into a\r\nlump which retained its shape by means of a rope one-fourth inch in\r\ndiameter, tightly twisted around it. The labor in pressing and\r\ntwisting is entirely done by hand, and attended to with the most\r\nscrupulous care.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louisiana tobacco plantation.]\r\n\r\nThe Creole planters sometimes raise two, and even three crops on the\r\nsame field, two of them being the growths of suckers or shoots from\r\nthe parent stock or stump. The growers of Perique tobacco have tested\r\nHavana seed, but can see but little difference between the product and\r\nthat from Virginia or Kentucky tobacco seed, while the growth is much\r\nsmaller. In color Louisiana tobacco is very dark, entirely different\r\nfrom any other variety grown in the Mississippi valley.\r\n\r\nSome few years since tobacco culture was introduced into California,\r\nand the belief then entertained by those who planted the consoling\r\nweed, that the state would soon become as famous for raising tobacco\r\nas she now is for producing wheat and gold seem likely to be\r\nrealized. The soil and climate of California are admirably adapted for\r\ntobacco. In the valleys the land is a deep alluvial loam, easily\r\nworked, producing bountiful crops of the finest leaf tobacco. The\r\nplanters have experimented with several varieties, including Havana,\r\nFlorida, Latakia, Hungarian, Mexican, Virginia, Connecticut, Standard\r\nand White leaf. Large crops are grown, especially of Florida tobacco,\r\nwhich, with careful culture, produces two thousand five hundred pounds\r\nof merchantable leaf to the acre. The planters get their Havana seed\r\nfrom Cuba, preferring to do so rather than to risk the seed from their\r\nown plants. At first they used home-grown seed and could not see any\r\nserious deterioration or change in the quality of the tobacco, but a\r\nsingular change in the form of the leaf took place. That from\r\nhome-grown seed grew longer, and the veins or ribs, which in Havana\r\ntobacco stand out at right angles from the leaf stalks took an acute\r\nangle, and thus became longer and made up a greater part of the leaf.\r\nOf Florida tobacco the home-grown seed comes true.\r\n\r\nTobacco is now being tested in the several counties in the State and\r\nwith every promise of success. Many of the ranches seem well adapted\r\nfor the plant and the planters are confident by their new process of\r\ncuring, of being able to produce an article equal to the best Havana\r\nbrand. The plants attain a remarkable size, and grow up like many\r\nkinds of tropical vegetation, without much care being bestowed upon\r\nthem, although the plants are regularly cultivated and hoed. The\r\nplanters are not troubled with that foe of most tobacco fields, \"the\r\nworm.\" They attribute this in part to the excellence of their soil and\r\npartly to the abundance of birds and yellow jackets. The planters do\r\nnot always \"top\" the Havana and do very little \"suckering.\" If the\r\nground is rich, and free from weeds they let one of the suckers from\r\nthat root grow, and thus become almost as large and heavy as the\r\noriginal plant. They believe that the soil is strong enough to bear\r\nthe plants and suckers, and that they get a better leaf and finer\r\nquality without suckering.\r\n\r\nIn summer the roads are very dusty in California, and this dust is a\r\ndisadvantage to the tobacco planter. On some of the plantations double\r\nrows of shade trees are planted along the main roads, and gravel is\r\nspread on the interior roads; and to protect the fields of tobacco\r\nfrom the high winds which sweep through the California valley, almonds\r\nand cottonwoods are planted for wind-breaks in the fields.\r\n\r\nSome of the planters employ Chinese to cultivate the plants, who are\r\nvery careful in hoeing and weeding the tobacco, living an apparently\r\njolly life in shanties near the fields. A witty California\r\ncorrespondent of the _Tobacco Leaf_ writes concerning the early\r\ncultivation of tobacco in that State:\r\n\r\n     \"We are doing a great many other things in California now\r\n     besides raising grain, fruit, wine, wool, and gold. We are\r\n     doing a lively business in tobacco. Fifteen years ago I was\r\n     down East on one occasion when they were gathering the\r\n     tobacco crop--which goes to New York, and, by a process\r\n     equal to wine making, becomes Havana tobacco. It struck me\r\n     that this country was admirably adapted to its cultivation,\r\n     and I brought back some seed, which I gave to a friend\r\n     living on the bank of the Sacramento River, instructing him\r\n     to plant it as per direction given me. We sat down and\r\n     calculated the immense fortune we would make raising\r\n     tobacco, if the experiment was a success. A week later my\r\n     friend, who was an impatient sort of a fellow, wrote me just\r\n     a line--'No results.' I replied, and asked him if he\r\n     expected a crop of tobacco in seven days. A few weeks later\r\n     he wrote, 'Here she comes;' two weeks later, 'How big is the\r\n     stuff to be?' two weeks later, 'Not room for tobacco and me\r\n     too. Who shall quit?' I heard no more for a month and\r\n     thought I would go up and see it. I did so, and the\r\n     steamboat landed me at my friend's ranch. I could not see\r\n     the house, and hallooed. I heard an answer from the depths,\r\n     and then following a path, I found my friend swinging in a\r\n     hammock in the shade of a grove of tobacco trees. I desire\r\n     to maintain my reputation for truth and veracity, so\r\n     necessary to a correspondent, so I won't say how big or how\r\n     high those tobacco plants were; but my friend's hammock was\r\n     slung from them--and he was no feather-weight--the leaves\r\n     completely embowered the cottage. I congratulated him on the\r\n     results--such a grove and such a shade--and moreover I\r\n     said, 'You will be permanently rid of mosquitoes.' 'Will I!'\r\n     said he. 'Do you know that these gallinippers have learned\r\n     to chew already, and the habit is spreading so that all the\r\n     old he-fellows are coming down from Marysville to take a\r\n     hand.' I inquired if my friend had cured any or smoked any.\r\n     He pointed to a Manyanita pipe split open on the ground, and\r\n     said. 'Before it was real strong, some three weeks ago, I\r\n     tried a leaf in that pipe. Observe the result--busted it the\r\n     second whiff, and knocked me off the log I was sitting on.'\r\n     Such was the first experiment in tobacco raising in\r\n     California. But now they have learned the trick. They have\r\n     searched the State for the poorest and most barren soil,\r\n     and, having found it are cultivating a splendid article of\r\n     genuine Havana leaf tobacco, manufacturing cigars as good as\r\n     you get one time in twenty even in Havana, making several\r\n     brands of smoking tobacco, and, lastly, an article of\r\n     Louisiana perique, ('peruke' proper,) that any old smoker\r\n     would go into ecstasies over, fully equal, it is said to the\r\n     genuine old-fashioned article, and that is saying a good\r\n     deal. Now if we can supply the world with cigars and\r\n     tobacco, we have got a dead sure thing for the future, even\r\n     if gold gives out, grain fails and the pigs eat up all the\r\n     fruit. Your people who have been paying fifteen cents apiece\r\n     for genuine Havana cigars imported direct from--Connecticut,\r\n     should rejoice and join in an earnest _hooray!_\"\r\n\r\nIn Mexico the tobacco plantations exhibit a diversity of scenery not\r\nmet with in other portions of America. The soil is well adapted for\r\nthe crop, and on many of the plantations in the Gulf States the plant\r\ngrows as finely as on any of the _vegas_ of Cuba. The Mexicans are\r\namong the best cultivators of the plant in the world, and, like the\r\nTurks, prefer its culture to that of any product grown. The plant is a\r\nstrong, vigorous grower, and ripens early, emitting an odor like that\r\nof Havana tobacco. The climate is so favorable that from one to three\r\ncrops can be grown on the same field in one year, and yield a\r\nbountiful harvest without seemingly impoverishing the soil.[66]\r\nTransplanted in the summer or autumn, the plants grow through the\r\nwinter months, and in spring are gathered and taken to the sheds.\r\nSartorius, in his work on Mexico, says of its culture on the\r\nplantation:--\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 66: Shepard says of the cultivation of tobacco\r\n              by the Indians:--\"The tobacco which is raised on the\r\n              Tehuantepec isthmus is said, by good judges, to rival\r\n              that of Cuba, and commands, in the capital, equal prices\r\n              with the far-famed Havana. It is cultivated by the\r\n              Indians, whose fields, or '_milpas_,' according to\r\n              Indian custom, are situated at some distance from their\r\n              villages, often in the depths of the forest. Upon these\r\n              little patches they bestow whatever labor is consistent\r\n              with dislike for exertion, leaving the rich soil to\r\n              accomplish the balance.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mexican tobacco plantation.]\r\n\r\n     \"Various kinds of tobacco are planted, mostly that with the\r\n     short, dingy, yellow blossoms, which has a very large,\r\n     strong leaf. But there is little doubt that the sorts would\r\n     be more carefully selected, if the trade were not fettered\r\n     by the monopoly. Most of the government planters enter into\r\n     an arrangement with the small farmers and peasants who have\r\n     to grow a certain number of plants, on conditions of handing\r\n     over the harvest at a low figure--six to eight dollars per\r\n     crop. These _aviados_ receive something in advance, and\r\n     their chief profit consists in securing the sand leaf and\r\n     the greater part of the after-harvest, which they sell to\r\n     the contrabandists. It is indeed allowed to export whatever\r\n     remains; but it is attended with so many annoyances from the\r\n     authorities, that it is never attempted. The many ships\r\n     which enter the Mexican harbor of the east coast with\r\n     European manufactures, find no return freight except gold\r\n     and silver, cochineal, vanilla, a few drugs and goat skins,\r\n     all of which take up very little room in the ships (money is\r\n     usually sent off in the English government steamers);\r\n     consequently they must either proceed to Laguna to buy\r\n     log-wood, or they must take in sugar, coffee, or tobacco, in\r\n     a Cuban or Haytian port. As soon as tobacco becomes an\r\n     export article, its cultivation must increase immensely in\r\n     the Coast States, the Mexican being very partial to this\r\n     branch of agriculture, which occupies him part of the year\r\n     only.\"\r\n\r\nMayer also alludes as follows to the same subject:--\r\n\r\n     \"A large portion of the tobacco sold in the republic is\r\n     contraband; for the ridiculous and greedy restrictions and\r\n     exactions with which a plant of such universal consumption\r\n     is surrounded, necessarily disposes the people to violate\r\n     laws which they feel were only made to impair their rights\r\n     of production and trade under a constitution professing to\r\n     be free.\"\r\n\r\nThe government planters in the State of Vera Cruz have large, fine\r\nplantations, and the plants are carefully tended and cultivated as in\r\nall countries where tobacco is a government monopoly. On each plant a\r\ncertain number of leaves are taken off, including the sand leaf, which\r\nis thrown away, and everything in the way of topping and suckering\r\nperformed as carefully as on the tobacco farms in Cuba. The small\r\nfarmers who raise only a few thousand plants are not as careful as the\r\nlarge planters, and are sometimes guilty of planting more than the\r\nnumber agreed upon, while the mountain passes towards the table-land\r\nare carefully guarded to prevent smuggling of the crop, which is far\r\nmore remunerative than selling to the government.\r\n\r\nWe will now take the reader to the primitive tobacco plantations of\r\nAmerica about the middle of the Sixteenth Century. The plantations\r\nwere not located in Cuba as many have supposed but what has been\r\nvariously named Hispaniola, Hayti, and St. Domingo. It was in this\r\nisland that the Spaniards first began the cultivation of tobacco and\r\ninaugurated (under the guise of Christianity) that career of monstrous\r\ncruelty, with which their insatiable appetite for the burning of\r\nheretics and for the baiting of bulls so well accords. In 1509, Diego\r\nColumbus, the eldest son of the great discoverer, assumed in St.\r\nDomingo, or as it was then called, Hispaniola, the vice-regal powers\r\nwhich had been intrusted to him. Diego as portrayed by the historian\r\n\"was a man as noble as his father, and almost as gifted; and he had\r\nhis father's fate. Like his father, he had to bear all that Spanish\r\nenvy and Spanish malignity could inflict. In 1511, Diego Columbus sent\r\nDiego Velasquez to conquer Cuba.\" From historians Velasquez gets a\r\nbetter character than most of the _Conquistadores_, who in general\r\nwere as ferocious as they were audacious and fortunate. No serious\r\nopposition was or could be offered. With the name of Velasquez the\r\nprosperity of Cuba is inseparably identified. As Governor of Cuba he\r\nwas a vigorous colonizer and civilizer. He founded Havana, which he\r\ncalled the Key of the New World, and which is said to rank as the\r\neighth place in the hierarchy of commercial cities. Havana, however\r\nhad long been flourishing before the seat of Government had been\r\ntransferred to it from Santiago. It was Velasquez who introduced\r\nslavery into Cuba; and it was during his vice-royalty and under his\r\nsanction that those memorable exploratory and conquering expeditions\r\nbegan, the most astonishing of which was that to Mexico, led by\r\nCortez, the insubordinate lieutenant of Velasquez, whose death is said\r\nto have been hastened by the rebellious and ungrateful conduct of\r\nCortez, and perhaps by the spectacle of such immense and rapid\r\nsuccess. The agricultural, commercial, and general growth of the West\r\nIndia islands at this period would have been much more rapid if the\r\nSpaniards had not annihilated the native population, and if they had\r\nnot been exposed to incessant piratical attacks. These were often of\r\nthe most desolating kind. In 1688, the city of Puerto Principe was\r\nplundered and destroyed. From its strongly fortified position Havana\r\nset the buccaneers at defiance, and sometimes saved the whole island\r\nfrom ruin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. Domingo tobacco field, 1535.]\r\n\r\nThe exact period of the first cultivation of tobacco in St. Domingo is\r\nnot known, but we find that as early as 1535 the negroes had\r\nhabituated themselves to the use of it in the plantations of their\r\nmaster. Soon however its cultivation increased, and during the latter\r\npart of the Sixteenth Century the Spaniards shipped vast quantities\r\nto Europe, a very large amount of which found its way to England,\r\nwhere it brought fabulous prices. The Spaniards, by the application of\r\nthe lash and other cruelties, extorted from the negroes an amount of\r\nlabor never equaled by any other task masters in the world. Forcing\r\nthese slaves to labor on the plantations from morning until night,\r\nwith the fierce rays of a tropical sun shining full upon their\r\nuncovered backs, and goaded on to the performance of the severest\r\ntoil, is it any wonder that the haughty cavaliers of Spain grew rich\r\nfrom their industry, and feasted on the products of the Indies.\r\nCultivated on the rich soil of this fertile island, the tobacco of St.\r\nDomingo had no competitor, until the Spaniards began its culture a\r\nlittle later on the island of Trinidad, the product of which in time\r\nstood at the head of all the tobaccos of the Indies and of South\r\nAmerica. The tobacco trade at this time was wholly controlled by the\r\nSpaniards, who, though successful in this direction, made but slow\r\nprogress in colonization. Compared in the British colonies in the New\r\nWorld, the Spanish possessions were weak and incompetent, and for all\r\ntheir advantages in their great product, it was ultimately rivaled by\r\nthe English Colonial tobacco. In the conquest of the New World,\r\nSpanish energy and enterprise seem to have exhausted themselves; and\r\nas Spain was declining, its colonies could not be expected rapidly to\r\nadvance. The history of the Spanish conquest in America is a record of\r\ncruelty and of blood, while that of English colonization is marked by\r\nEnglish rigor and enterprise, and is one of successful daring and\r\nultimate triumph.\r\n\r\nThe West India plantations, however, were still worked, and for more\r\nthan a century St. Domingo yielded a vast amount of tobacco, until the\r\nsoil of Cuba was found to be better adapted for its production than\r\nany other of the West India islands, not excepting even the island of\r\nTrinidad.\r\n\r\nHazard, in his work on Cuba, describes the celebrated _vegas_ or\r\ntobacco plantations, of the island as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Cuban _vega_.]\r\n\r\n     \"The best properties known as _vegas_, or tobacco farms, are\r\n     comprised in a narrow area in the south-west part of the\r\n     island, about twenty-seven leagues broad. Near the western\r\n     extremity of the Island of Cuba, on the southern coast, is\r\n     found one of the finest tobaccos in the world. Within a\r\n     space of seventy-three miles long and eighteen miles wide,\r\n     grows the plant that stands as eminent among tobacco plants\r\n     as the lordly Johannisberger among the wines of the Rhine.\r\n     Shut in on the north by mountains, and south-west by the\r\n     ocean, Pinar del Rio being the principal point in the\r\n     district. These _vegas_ are found generally on the margins\r\n     of rivers, or in low, moist localities, their ordinary size\r\n     being not more than a _coballeria_, which amounts to about\r\n     thirty-three acres of our measurement. The half of this is\r\n     also most frequently devoted to the raising of the vegetable\r\n     known as the _platano_ (banana), which may be said to be the\r\n     bread of the lower classes. A few other small vegetables are\r\n     raised. The usual buildings upon such places are a dwelling\r\n     house, a drying-house, a few sheds for cattle, and perhaps a\r\n     small _bohio_ (hut), or two, made in the rudest manner, for\r\n     the shelter of the hands, who, upon some of the very largest\r\n     places number twenty or thirty, though not always\r\n     negroes--for this portion of the labor of the island seems\r\n     to be performed by the lower classes of whites. Some of the\r\n     places that are large have a mayoral, as he is called, a man\r\n     whose business it is to look after the negroes, and direct\r\n     the agricultural labors; but, as a general thing, the\r\n     planter, who is not always the owner of the property, but\r\n     simply the lessee, lives upon, directs, and governs the\r\n     place.\r\n\r\n     \"Guided by the results of a long experience transmitted from\r\n     his ancestors (says a Spanish author), the farmer knows,\r\n     without being able to explain himself, the means of\r\n     augmenting or diminishing the strength or the mildness of\r\n     the tobacco. His right hand, as if guided by an instinct,\r\n     foresees what buds it is necessary to take off in order to\r\n     put a limit to the increase or height, and what amount of\r\n     trimming is necessary to give a chance to the proper\r\n     quantity of leaves. But the principal care, and that which\r\n     occupies him in his waking hours, is the extermination of\r\n     the voracious insects that persecute the plant. One called\r\n     _cachaga_ domesticates itself at the foot of the leaves; the\r\n     _verde_, on the under side of the leaves; the _rosquilla_,\r\n     in the heart of the plant; all of them doing more or less\r\n     damage. The planter passes entire nights, provided with\r\n     lights, clearing the buds just opening, of these destructive\r\n     insects. He has even to carry on a war with still worse\r\n     enemies,--the _vivijagnas_, a species of large, native ants,\r\n     that are to the tobacco what the locust is to the wheat.\r\n     This plague is so great, at times, that prayers and special\r\n     adoration are offered up to San Marcial to intercede against\r\n     the plague of ants.\r\n\r\n     \"The plant, whose original name was _cohiba_, seems to have\r\n     been cultivated first by Europeans on the island in the\r\n     vicinity of Havana. The island of Cuba is without doubt\r\n     well adapted for the cultivation of tobacco--the soil,\r\n     climate, and improved methods of culture all tend to the\r\n     production of a leaf tobacco as celebrated as it is\r\n     valuable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Killing bugs by night.]\r\n\r\n     \"Between the 'Lower Valley,' in the Nicotian, not the\r\n     geographical, sense of these words, lie the so-called\r\n     _Partidos_ which produce the tobacco that is sent to Europe\r\n     as _Partido_ or _Cabañas_. The leaf often surpasses that of\r\n     the 'Lower Valley' in size and fineness, as well as in the\r\n     beauty of the color; but it is inferior in quality. The\r\n     tobacco farmers though stalwart fellows are not fond of\r\n     work, and too often waste their time at the tavern. Many of\r\n     them from thriftlessness are plunged into debt; and scarcely\r\n     is the harvest ended when they borrow money from the tobacco\r\n     merchant on the following harvest, who thereby obtains the\r\n     right to interfere, it may be despotically, with the\r\n     management of the crop. Continual embarrassments tempt the\r\n     tobacco planters to be dishonest. To cheat their creditors,\r\n     they often sell the best part of the crop in underhand\r\n     fashion. Such of the tobacco farmers as wish to produce a\r\n     great deal of tobacco, without regard to the excellence of\r\n     the article, leave the plant to its natural growth, which is\r\n     both scientifically and otherwise objectionable, for it is\r\n     on a process of thinning and pruning a due diffusion of sap\r\n     in the leaves depends, and consequently the quality of the\r\n     tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nThe tobacco, after being baled, is sent to the Havana market. The\r\nbales of tobacco are carried on the backs of mules or horses to the\r\ncity or to the nearest railway station.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Going to market.]\r\n\r\n     \"In the long line or train of mules or horses, the head of\r\n     one mule or horse is tied to the tail of the one before it.\r\n     On the back of the foremost sits the driver. The hindmost\r\n     carries a bell, which enables the driver to know whether any\r\n     of the animals have broken loose.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the description given by Hazard of Cuba, its soil, climate, and\r\nother resources, it will readily be seen by all acquainted with the\r\ntobacco plant that this famous island is well adapted for the\r\nproduction of a tobacco that for fineness and delicacy of flavor is\r\nhardly rivaled. With the peculiar composition of the soil, and with a\r\nclimate well adapted for the perfection of all kinds of tropical\r\nplants and fruits, it can hardly be imagined that any finer variety of\r\ntobacco can be grown than that produced in Cuba and the adjoining\r\nislands. Doubtless the climate of Cuba is nearly the same as when\r\nColumbus discovered the island, and wrote in such extravagant\r\nlanguage its praise. The soil of Cuba is prolific, and the variety of\r\ntropical plants and fruits grown upon the island is quite remarkable.\r\nNowhere is this seen to a greater extent than in the varieties of\r\ntobacco cultivated. Although there are several kinds and qualities\r\ngrown on the island, the mode of culture upon all the _vegas_ is\r\nnearly the same. These _vegas_ or tobacco farms greatly outnumber the\r\ncoffee and sugar estates, but are much smaller, and require a less\r\nnumber of hands to work them. Hazard estimates the number at ten\r\nthousand, while they are constantly increasing as new fields are being\r\ntried and new modes of culture introduced. Russell says of tobacco\r\nculture in Cuba:--\r\n\r\n     \"In regard to climate, it is worthy of observation that\r\n     tobacco is only cultivated during winter, when there is\r\n     little rain. It grows most luxuriantly in summer with the\r\n     increased heat and moisture; but the leaves grown in this\r\n     season are devoid of those qualities for which the weed is\r\n     esteemed. The conditions of growth are less powerful in\r\n     winter, when the temperature is ten degrees lower, and the\r\n     fall of rain small. At the same time, there is more sunshine\r\n     to impart those aromatic qualities which are so much\r\n     relished by smokers of tobacco. In Virginia the torrid heat\r\n     and thunder showers during the summer months are by no means\r\n     favorable for developing the mild aroma of a good smoking\r\n     leaf. Such atmospheric conditions are better suited for\r\n     cotton and Indian corn than tobacco, which must have dry\r\n     weather and sunshine to produce it in perfection.\"\r\n\r\nNo country in Europe is more celebrated for its tobacco than Germany.\r\nThe tobacco plant has been cultivated in some parts of Prussia for\r\nnearly two centuries. The tobacco of Germany is used for all purposes\r\nfor which the leaf is designed--for cutting, cigars, and snuff. There\r\nare various kinds of German tobacco, the finest being grown in the\r\nGrand Duchy of Baden. The native tobacco of Germany, however, is not\r\npowerful in flavor, and may be smoked continuously to an extent which\r\nwould be dangerous and disagreeable if American tobacco were used.\r\nAlthough it is cultivated in most of the States of Germany, and by a\r\nlarge number of growers, still the tobacco fields as a rule are small.\r\nThe Germans are among the most thorough cultivators of the plant in\r\nEurope, and every operation in the field is done at the proper time\r\nand in the right manner. After it is cured they prepare it nicely in\r\nrolls and carots, the latter for manufacturing into snuff. The tobacco\r\nfields are faithfully tended, and the utmost pains taken to secure\r\nlarge, well-formed leaves. The fields present a much more even\r\nappearance than similar fields in France, where the tobacco grown is\r\nsmall and uneven. The South German growers of tobacco are without\r\ndoubt the most successful tobacco-growers in Europe, not excepting the\r\nHollanders, who raise an excellent tobacco for snuff. The time of\r\ngathering the leaves is the occasion of quite a merry-making among the\r\ngrowers and villagers, and is considered an event of considerable\r\nimportance. Fairholt says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The time of harvesting the leaves is an interesting period\r\n     for a stranger to visit the villages, which put on a new\r\n     aspect as every house and barn is hung all over with the\r\n     drying leaves.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: German tobacco field.]\r\n\r\nGerman tobacco cures well, and some of the finer sorts make excellent\r\ncigar wrappers and are much esteemed throughout Europe. The following\r\naccount of the cultivation and production of tobacco in the different\r\nGerman States, will give some idea of the amount cultivated and used\r\nin Germany:--\r\n\r\n     \"The aggregate area of land cultivated with tobacco in\r\n     Prussia during the year 1871, amounted to 5.925 hectares (a\r\n     hectare being equal to 2.47 English acres). It appears that\r\n     the extent of tobacco-growing land has, during the last\r\n     fifty years, been gradually diminishing in Prussia, and that\r\n     accordingly the expectations entertained in the beginning of\r\n     that period of a great future development of this branch of\r\n     agriculture, have not been realized; for whilst the area of\r\n     land planted with tobacco in the year 1825 was 12.374\r\n     hectares, it amounted in 1871 to less than one-half this\r\n     amount. The reasons for this gradual decline are considered\r\n     to be, on the one hand, the growing competition of the South\r\n     German growers, and the increase in the importations of\r\n     American tobacco; on the other, the fact that the\r\n     cultivation of beet-root (for sugar manufacturing) and of\r\n     potatoes (for the distilleries) has proved to be a more\r\n     profitable business than the cultivation of tobacco. It has,\r\n     moreover, been found by many years' experience, that whilst\r\n     the quality of the tobacco cultivated in most parts of\r\n     Prussia is not such as to enable the growers to compete\r\n     successfully with the importers of foreign (particularly of\r\n     North American) sorts, the labor attending its cultivation\r\n     and its preparation for the market, as well as the\r\n     uncertainty of only an average crop, are out of proportion,\r\n     as a rule, to the average profits arising therefrom. The\r\n     cultivation of the plant has, consequently, gradually become\r\n     restricted, chiefly to those districts of the country where\r\n     either the soil is peculiarly adapted for the purpose, or\r\n     where it is carried on for the private use of the producer.\"\r\n\r\n     With regard to the various provinces of Prussia, it appears\r\n     that \"In East Prussia the extent of tobacco land is only a\r\n     limited one, and is confined to the district around Tilsit,\r\n     where about two-thirds of the entire cultivation is in the\r\n     hands of peasants, who consume their own produce. In West\r\n     Prussia (the western portion of the province of Prussia\r\n     proper) the cultivation is rather more extensive,\r\n     particularly near the town of Marienwerder; the tobacco,\r\n     however, is very inferior. The most important districts of\r\n     the province of Posen are those of Chodziesz and Meseritz.\r\n     In Pomerania, next to Brandenburg the most important\r\n     tobacco-growing province of the kingdom, the area of land\r\n     cultivated is very large. The principal districts are those\r\n     near Stettin. In Silesia the most important districts are\r\n     those around Breslau, Ratibor, and Oels. The principal\r\n     tobacco-growing province of Prussia is Brandenburg, and here\r\n     again, particularly the part of the government district of\r\n     Potsdam, which contains the towns of Neustadt, Eberswalde\r\n     and Prenzlau. Besides the districts mentioned, tobacco is\r\n     grown largely in that of Frankfort-on-the Oder. In the\r\n     province of Saxony the chief districts are those of Stendal,\r\n     Salzwedel, Nordhausen, Burg, and Wittenburg. Hanover, like\r\n     the other western provinces of the kingdom, produces a\r\n     superior quality of tobacco to that raised in the eastern\r\n     parts of Prussia--the most important district is that of\r\n     Munden. The chief tobacco-growing districts of Hesse-Nossau\r\n     are situated near the towns of Cassel and Hanau. In Rhenish\r\n     Prussia the plant is cultivated, particularly in the\r\n     neighborhood of Cleve, Emmerich, Coblenz, Creuznach, and\r\n     Saarbruck; the districts first mentioned produce a very\r\n     superior quality. The production of tobacco in Westphalia is\r\n     extremely small, while in the province of Schleswig-Holstein\r\n     the plant is not cultivated at all. In the account given it\r\n     will be seen that the tobacco plant holds an important place\r\n     among the products of Prussia, and although not as\r\n     extensively cultivated as formerly, has not been entirely\r\n     driven from the soil by other products which yield a larger\r\n     profit to the producer. The plant is cultivated in other\r\n     parts of Germany, especially in Bavaria, where large\r\n     quantities of tobacco are grown, particularly so in the\r\n     Bavarian Palatinate and in Franconia (viz., the districts\r\n     around Nuremberg and Erlangen). In the Kingdom of Saxony but\r\n     little tobacco is raised, as is also the case in Wurtemberg,\r\n     although the soil and climate in parts of this state are\r\n     said to be very favorable to the growth of the tobacco\r\n     plant; the area of land cultivated is upon the whole, a very\r\n     limited one, and in 1871 did not exceed 178.2 hectares. The\r\n     Grand Duchy of Baden has at all times been the chief\r\n     tobacco-growing part of Germany; as far back as the end of\r\n     the Seventeenth Century, special laws for regulation of the\r\n     cultivation, preparation, and warehousing of this article\r\n     were in force. The most prominent tobacco-growing districts\r\n     of Baden are those of Carlsruhe, Mannheim, Heidelburg,\r\n     Badenburg, Schwetzingen, and Lahr; the quality of the plant\r\n     grown in those parts being a very superior one (among the\r\n     various kinds of German tobacco). The produce of the\r\n     districts mentioned is therefore applied chiefly in the\r\n     manufacture of cigar wrappers, and is exported in\r\n     considerable quantities to Bremen, Hamburg, Switzerland,\r\n     Holland, and even to America for the use of cigar\r\n     manufacture. The prices of the best kinds of Baden tobacco\r\n     are consequently also, on an average, much higher than those\r\n     realized by other German growers. In the Grand Duchy of\r\n     Hesse the plant is cultivated, the chief district being that\r\n     around the town of Darmstadt; in the Thuringian States,\r\n     tobacco is grown; the most prominent among them as regards\r\n     its production is the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. In\r\n     Mecklenburg also some tobacco is raised, the most important\r\n     district being that of Neu Brandenburg (in\r\n     Mecklenburg-Strelitz). In Brunswick only a small extent of\r\n     land is used for tobacco growing, the same being situated\r\n     near the town of Helmstadt. In Alsace and Lorraine, the\r\n     recently acquired provinces of Germany, the cultivation of\r\n     tobacco has been extensively carried on for many years, more\r\n     especially in the country around Strasburg, Mulhausen,\r\n     Schirmeck, and Munster, and to a small extent near Metz and\r\n     Thionville.\"\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from this account that the German tobacco fields\r\nproduce a vast quantity of tobacco, some of which is of excellent\r\ntexture and flavor, and well adapted to the taste of European smokers\r\nof the plant.\r\n\r\nEver since the introduction of tobacco into Holland, its cultivation\r\nand its use has been looked upon with favor by the \"true-born\r\nNederlander,\" who associates the plant with every social enjoyment.\r\nThe Dutch, on the discovery of tobacco, were among the first to use it\r\nand encourage its cultivation. In the history of the Dutch colonies in\r\nthe Indies it plays an important part. Tobacco began to be cultivated\r\nin Holland about Amersfoot in 1615, and from that time until now, its\r\nculture has increased until it has become one of the greatest of\r\nagricultural products of the country. The plant is grown in the\r\nVeluive (the valley of Guelderland), where the soil is particularly\r\nadapted for the rich snuff-leaf which is manufactured from Amersfoot\r\ntobacco. The Dutch, like the Germans, are excellent cultivators of\r\ntobacco, selecting the richest and the strongest land, and working the\r\nfields of as fine a tilth as possible. The plants do not grow as\r\nrapidly as in America, as they are transplanted into the fields in\r\nMay, and are not harvested until the latter part of September or\r\nbeginning of October. The plants attain good size--larger than most\r\nof the tobacco of Europe, and a tobacco field in Holland compares\r\nfavorably with any in this country. The color of the plants while\r\ngrowing, is a dark rich green, and they are of a uniform size,\r\nmaturing slowly but thoroughly. Connor says of Amersfoot tobacco:\r\n\"This tobacco is much esteemed, the fineness of the leaf and its\r\nfreedom from fibres fitting it for cigar-wrappers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dutch planters.]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch planters of tobacco are among the happiest cultivators of\r\nthe plant in Europe, if not in the world, and unlike the renowned Van\r\nTwiller never \"have any doubts about the matter,\" and believe that\r\ntobacco is absolutely necessary to sustain life. After the evening\r\nmeal the planter lights his pipe or calls upon the good dominie, to\r\nhave a social chat, discoursing over their favorite beverage the\r\nvirtues of two great luxuries. Oftener, however, he passes his\r\nevenings at the village inn, where, surrounded by other comrades, he\r\ndiscourses as follows of his favorite plant,--tabak:\r\n\r\n     \"That the smoking of tobacco is of infinite benefit, no one\r\n     who is impartial and unprejudiced can deny. In a country\r\n     like Holland, where the atmosphere is always laden with\r\n     heavy and hurtful particles, and where, while people\r\n     breathe that atmosphere from above, they feel themselves not\r\n     less affected from below by the cold, moist, swampy\r\n     soil--the smoking and the chewing of tobacco are the\r\n     wholesome prophylactics of which we can make use. To the\r\n     Indians and the Negroes, tobacco is almost the only solace\r\n     in this transient life. They learn, by means of it, to\r\n     support nature, and to encounter valiantly, by its help, all\r\n     the tribulations incidental to the human lot. If they are\r\n     depressed, they smoke or chew tobacco, and gladden\r\n     themselves therewith. If they are exhausted, and the sun and\r\n     their hard and inhuman masters appear to conspire to destroy\r\n     them, a little tobacco restores their strength, makes them\r\n     forget their slavish life, and go vigorously to work again.\r\n\r\n     In the Thirty Years' War in Germany, the smoking and chewing\r\n     of tobacco proved the salvation of many thousands of men,\r\n     who by its aid guarded themselves against the deadly effects\r\n     of deficient food and of bad meats and drinks. Nothing is so\r\n     good, nothing so serviceable to human life, as the smoking\r\n     of tobacco--which may well be called a kingly plant, seeing\r\n     that the monarchs of the earth are not ashamed to use it.\r\n     While tobacco cultivates sociality, and is of great avail in\r\n     severe hunger and thirst, it strengthens the body and checks\r\n     fluxions, and colds, and slimy humors. Nature has willed it\r\n     that men should make use of plants like tobacco, which, by\r\n     their heat and sharpness, draw the humors outward, and cause\r\n     a slight salivation. Witness, as confirmation of what has\r\n     been said, cloves and pepper, which hold sway nearly over\r\n     the earth; betel, which to the Hindoos is the remedy for\r\n     every disease; the onions and leeks of the Egyptians, who\r\n     while building the pyramids and obelisks, spent their money\r\n     eagerly on those dainties; and tobacco, which is adopted by\r\n     the four quarters of the world.\r\n\r\n     The justly celebrated British physician, Cheyne, has\r\n     remarked that both chewing and smoking of tobacco are\r\n     exceedingly serviceable for those who suffer from rheumatic\r\n     and catarrhal affections, have a sluggish digestion, or live\r\n     a luxurious life. As tobacco has numerous slanderers, so\r\n     there are many who know not how to turn tobacco to a good\r\n     purpose. Excess and abuse may be found in the smoking and\r\n     chewing of tobacco as in other things. Instead of using\r\n     tobacco in moderation, there are persons who make themselves\r\n     its slaves, and render themselves incapable of the immense\r\n     benefit of the enlivening and stimulating effect they would\r\n     otherwise owe to it. A little tobacco smoked or chewed\r\n     three or four times a day cannot fail to be beneficial. But\r\n     the adversaries of tobacco, in order to furnish themselves\r\n     with an argument, make tobacco bear all the blame when some\r\n     one who has given himself up to an intemperate and luxurious\r\n     life, and who is besides a great smoker, becomes the victim\r\n     of all kinds of discomforts and sickness. To condemn tobacco\r\n     by saying those who begin to chew or smoke it nearly always\r\n     suffer from malaise and nausea, is surely preposterous. May\r\n     we not in fairness contend that tobacco is essentially\r\n     wholesome, that it helps digestion, relieves the mind and\r\n     cheers the spirits.\"\r\n\r\nThe following humorous account of \"Thirsty Tobacco\" is a most curious\r\nillustration of the superstitions which spontaneously grow up in the\r\nhearts of the people.\r\n\r\n     \"Soon after the introduction of tobacco into Holland many of\r\n     the Dutch were of the opinion that the tobacco plant drank\r\n     in moisture greedily and required to be often and abundantly\r\n     watered. From this insatiable thirst the belief arose that\r\n     tobacco was the cause of rain, brought clouds to the\r\n     heavens, and restored the general crops. Once, in the\r\n     neighborhood of Amersfoot, the weather was very rainy, and\r\n     the crops suffered accordingly. On the tobacco growing round\r\n     the town the blame of the calamity was thrown; and it was\r\n     resolved to punish tobacco, the sottish rain-drinker and\r\n     wicked rain-bringer. A rabble, consisting chiefly of boys\r\n     and youths, rushed to the tobacco fields, and scattered\r\n     havoc with the ferocity of stupidity. The mad creatures\r\n     pulled up the stalks, tore off the leaves, and trampled\r\n     leaves and stalks under foot. Before they had done the work\r\n     of destruction quite as completely as they desired, soldiers\r\n     appeared on the scene. They sternly commanded the rioters to\r\n     desist, but the rioters paid no heed either to entreaties or\r\n     threats. Thereupon they drew their swords, as if by the mere\r\n     flash of these to terrify the rioters, who laughed a laugh\r\n     of contempt. Then effectually to frighten the rioters, the\r\n     soldiers fired at them with blank cartridges. This harmless\r\n     noise drove the mischief-makers to ignominious flight, and\r\n     the tobacco plants which were still uninjured were left in\r\n     peace.\"\r\n\r\nAt what exact time this destruction of \"thirsty tobacco\" took place we\r\nare left in doubt. It is doubtless a \"good joke\" got up by some\r\n\"ponderous joker\" for the amusement of Dutch smokers.\r\n\r\nAll admirers of tobacco like Holland and its people. It is\r\nemphatically the land of smoke. One is constantly in cloud-land, and\r\nwhether in the house or on the street the incense of tobacco is\r\nperpetual, from the good natured dominie who puffs leisurely at many\r\npipes to the humblest peasant who works modestly among the plants, all\r\nburn the fragrant weed and pay homage to its shrine. Ever since the\r\nDutch looked upon the plant it has been more to them than king and\r\ncourtier. The old Dutch burgomasters \"who dozed away their lives and\r\ngrew fat upon the bench of magistracy in Rotterdam; and who had\r\ncomported themselves with such singular wisdom and propriety, that\r\nthey were never either heard or talked of, owed all to the use and\r\ninfluence of the 'kingly plant.'\" Not only are the Dutch prodigious\r\nsmokers, but they use the pipe at all places and at all times. On the\r\nway to Church the pipe is lighted, and after service it is the solace\r\nof the evening hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Success to Von Tromp.]\r\n\r\nIn all public places the pipe plays an important part. The traveler is\r\nconstantly reminded of the use of tobacco; for even the bridges have\r\npublic notices affixed to them requesting all visitors to prevent the\r\nfall of tobacco-ashes on the gravel or grass; and not to knock out\r\ntheir pipes within bounds of the place. The old Dutch planters were\r\nfond of a \"silent pipe,\" and after the labors of the day gathered\r\ntogether to drink and smoke to the success of Admiral Von Tromp, whose\r\nexploits in the British Channel carried terror to many a heart. Or,\r\nspeculated upon the voyage of the \"_Goede Vrouw_\" (Good Woman), which\r\nhad been fitted out to colonize the new country.\r\n\r\nThe progress of tobacco-culture in Oceanica, is shown in the following\r\naccount which Connor gives of the tobacco plantations of Australia:\r\n\r\n     \"The development of tobacco culture in Australia has been\r\n     great and rapid. In these colonies, where only a few years\r\n     ago the plant was not known, there are now hundreds of acres\r\n     under tobacco. The local manufacture is also keeping pace\r\n     with the production of the leaf, and the import of tobacco\r\n     into the Australian colonies yearly diminishes in proportion\r\n     to the increased consumption of locally grown and\r\n     manufactured tobacco. Imported leaf is used in the\r\n     manufacture of cigars, those made from colonial leaf being\r\n     held in low esteem. Steady efforts are being made by the\r\n     cultivators to improve the quality of the produce, and with\r\n     every prospect of success, many places in the colonies being\r\n     well adapted for the growth of the plant. Colonel De Coin\r\n     says Australia is capable of producing very good qualities.\r\n     Tobacco has hitherto been grown upon alluvial lands, but a\r\n     preference is evinced for lands somewhat less rich but free\r\n     from floods. Alluvial land gives a larger crop per acre, but\r\n     the flavor is ranker. In 1872 there were 567 acres under\r\n     tobacco in New South Wales. The average produce of the\r\n     colonies is about 1,300 pounds to the acre. The amount of\r\n     produce varied from 976 pounds to the acre in New South\r\n     Wales to 2,016 in Tasmania, the climate of this island being\r\n     moister and more favorable for tobacco than that of the\r\n     other colonies. Manilla and Havana tobacco has been grown\r\n     with great success for seed for many years at the Adelaide\r\n     Botanic Gardens, and the seed raised has been largely\r\n     distributed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Australian growers may demonstrate the fact that as good or better\r\nManilla tobacco can be grown by them than in the Philippine islands.\r\nIf the leaf will burn freely, and leave a white, firm ash, the product\r\nwill no doubt prove a rival of the leaf grown in Luzon. From the\r\ncomposition of the soil, it is hardly probable that Havana tobacco\r\ncan be grown to perfection; it may, however, resemble in some measure\r\nthe Cuban leaf. The climate has much to do with the flavor of tobacco;\r\nmore than with the size of the plants or the color of the leaf. Cuba\r\nin this respect has a decided advantage over Australia; and Havana\r\ntobacco will hardly find a rival in Australian leaf, though grown on\r\nthe finest soil, and given the most thorough care.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco field in Algiers.]\r\n\r\nSo extensive is the cultivation of the tobacco plant, that even the\r\nArab cultivates it in the burning desert. In Algiers it is an\r\nimportant product; and through the efforts and encouragement of the\r\nFrench government its cultivation is assuming large dimensions. Some\r\nportions of Algiers seem to be well adapted for tobacco, the finest of\r\nwhich is equal to any obtained from America; but a large portion of\r\nthe product from that province is of poor quality. It is a favorite\r\nplant with the Arab, and his attention seems to be about equally\r\ndivided between his tobacco and his camels. The plant is light in\r\ncolor and of peculiar flavor, well suited to his taste, and in keeping\r\nwith his idea of quality and excellence. The crop is usually\r\nbountiful, notwithstanding the heat of the summer and the absence of\r\nmoisture in the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco field in Africa.]\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant is also cultivated in other parts of Africa besides\r\nAlgiers. In Egypt and Nubia it is grown to a considerable extent, as\r\nwell as by most of the native tribes of the South-west. Among some\r\ntribes it forms an important article of trade, and serves the purpose\r\nof money or its representative. The natives are partial to the plant,\r\nand devotedly attached to smoking. Little patches may be seen near\r\ntheir huts, on which they lavish their attention and care. In some\r\nparts of Africa tobacco grows to a very great height. Livingstone\r\ngives an account of a variety that attained an altitude much higher\r\nthan the American plant. Several varieties are cultivated, some of\r\nthem resembling the Shiraz and Latakia, while most of it is said to be\r\nsimilar to Virginia tobacco, only larger. With careful culture the\r\nplant would doubtless thrive in most parts of Africa, as the soil is\r\nlight and the season usually favorable. Though the heat is extreme the\r\nplant flourishes even in the hottest part of the season, and attains a\r\ndegree of perfection corresponding to the labor bestowed by the\r\nnatives in cultivating. Their manner of curing is simply by drying the\r\nleaves, and is not suited to the taste of any besides themselves. In\r\nEgypt, Algiers, and Nubia, the plant is cultivated with more care, and\r\na better system of curing is adopted than by the natives of the\r\ninterior. Burton gives an account of the cultivation of tobacco by the\r\nnatives of East Africa:--\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco grows plentifully in the more fertile regions of\r\n     East Africa. Planted at the end of the rains, it gains\r\n     strength by sun and dew, and is harvested in October. It is\r\n     prepared for sale in different forms. Everywhere, however, a\r\n     simple sun-drying supplies the place of cocking and\r\n     sweating, and the people are not so fastidious as to reject\r\n     the lower or coarser leaves and those tainted by the earth.\r\n     Usumbara produces what is considered at Zanzibar a superior\r\n     article; it is kneaded into little circular cakes four\r\n     inches in diameter by half an inch deep: rolls of these\r\n     cakes are neatly packed in plantain-leaves for exportation.\r\n     The next in order of excellence is that grown in Uhiao: it\r\n     is exported in leaf or in the form called _kambari_,\r\n     roll-tobacco, a circle of coils each about an inch in\r\n     diameter. The people of Khutu and Usagara mould the pounded\r\n     and wetted material into discs like cheeses, 8 or 9 inches\r\n     across by 2 or 3 in depth, and weighing about 3 lbs.; they\r\n     supply the Wagogo with tobacco, taking in exchange for it\r\n     salt. The leaf in Unyamwezi generally is soft and\r\n     perishable, that of Usukuma being the worst; it is sold in\r\n     blunt cones, so shaped by the mortars in which they are\r\n     pounded. At Karaguah, according to the Arabs, the tobacco, a\r\n     superior variety, tastes like musk in the water-pipe. The\r\n     produce of Ujiji is better than that of Unyamwezi; it is\r\n     sold in leaf, and is called by the Arabs _hamumi_, after a\r\n     well-known growth in Hazramaut. It is impossible to give an\r\n     average price to tobacco in East Africa; it varies from 1\r\n     khete of coral beads per 6 oz. to 2 lbs.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the most beautiful and fragrant tobacco fields in the world\r\nare to be found in Syria. Indeed it may truthfully be said that a\r\nfield of Latakia tobacco is hardly inferior in beauty to the large and\r\nfragrant orchards of the olive and mulberry, or the wheat fields on\r\nthe terraced sides of Mount Lebanon.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant is cultivated in various parts of Syria and\r\nparticularly by the Druses on \"The Lebanon,\" as it is usually called.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco field in Syria.]\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of tobacco in Syria, has been a considerable industry,\r\nand the product has acquired a reputation in European markets that has\r\ndemonstrated its real value, and a constant demand for this variety of\r\nthe plant. Latakia tobacco resembles in flavor the yellow tobacco of\r\nEastern Thibet and Western China, both of them grown from the same\r\nseed. Latakia tobacco is not sweated like most tobacco, but is first\r\ncured in the sun and then hung up in the peasants' huts to cure until\r\nready for market. The plants ripen very fast and emit an aromatic\r\nodor, increasing in strength as the plants ripen. For smoking it has\r\nbut few superiors. After curing, it is baled and sent to Europe, where\r\nit is manufactured into smoking tobacco. The plants are well\r\ncultivated and watched against the ravages of birds, which seem to\r\nlike the young and tender plants especially before they are\r\ntransplanted. From the nature of the soil the plants are watered\r\nfrequently, and when the leaves are about the size of a large cabbage\r\nleaf are ready to harvest. As the plants ripen the leaves gradually\r\nthicken and take on a lighter shade; the leaf when green is very\r\nthick, but after curing is quite thin and of a bright yellow or brown,\r\naccording to the process employed in curing. The peasants take equal\r\npains in its fumigation, using various kinds of wood according to the\r\ncolor of leaf they wish to obtain. They usually make two kinds of\r\nleaf, the finest being colored brown and known by the name of\r\n_abowri_. The tobacco is fumigated with two kinds of wood, _gozen_\r\n(pine wood) and _sindian_ (oak), the tobacco fumigated with gozen\r\nhaving the best smell. The fumigation, however, is said not to be\r\nresorted to expressly for the tobacco, but the mountaineers of\r\nnecessity burn much wood in their huts in the winter, and the smoke\r\nimproves the tobacco in color, smell, and flavor. All the tobacco\r\ngrown about Latakia derives its origin from the same seed, but the\r\ndifference between the _abowri_ and the other kinds is owing to the\r\ncultivation of the former about high mountains and with the use of\r\npine wood in fumigating it. A field of Latakia tobacco presents a\r\nnovel appearance, the short straight plants with their ovate leaves\r\nbearing yellow blossoms form a striking contrast to towering seed leaf\r\nrising fully two or three feet higher than the Syrian plant.\r\n\r\nFairholt says that \"Latakia tobacco is a native of America but grows\r\nwild in other countries, and is a hardy annual in English gardens,\r\nflowering from midsummer to Michaelmas, so that by some botanists it\r\nhas been termed 'common, or 'English tobacco.'\" Burton's work on\r\nunexplored Syria is full of passages relating to tobacco and the\r\ncustom of smoking.\r\n\r\n     \"The tobacco which is grown on the slopes of the Libanus and\r\n     the Anti-Libanus mountains appears to be one of the finest\r\n     quality and most delicate flavor. The monks of the convents\r\n     are famous for the production of a snuff, which for\r\n     pungency, at least, is far superior to the snuffs of Europe.\r\n     Personal experience of it convinces us that a great deal of\r\n     the pungency of this snuff is due to the addition of some\r\n     aromatic herb in addition to the natural acridity produced\r\n     by the highly dried tobacco. The cultivation of tobacco in\r\n     Syria, will probably increase in proportion to the improved\r\n     condition of affairs in Syria, we have little doubt; and we\r\n     trust that when agricultural science is better studied\r\n     there, Englishmen will have the opportunity of testing the\r\n     value and importance of Syrian tobacco products.\"\r\n\r\nConnor says of the tobacco fields of India:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the Bombay Presidency tobacco is largely produced, and\r\n     its quality in such districts as Kaira and Khandesh is\r\n     superior. In 1871 there were nearly 43,000 acres of land\r\n     under tobacco in the presidency, the largest quantities\r\n     being grown in Kaira, Khandesh, Belgaum Sattara, Shalopoor,\r\n     and Poona. The trade is extensive. The exports of tobacco to\r\n     foreign countries amount to several million pounds annually.\r\n     Among foreign countries, Mauritius, Bourbon, and\r\n     neighboring places, not reckoned as part of British India,\r\n     take a large share of the exports. Bombay exports tobacco to\r\n     other Indian presidencies. Small quantities of the fine\r\n     Guzerat tobaccos find their way by rail into the\r\n     North-western Provinces. Numerous endeavors have for many\r\n     years past been made to improve the quality of Bombay\r\n     tobacco. In 1831 the Resident in the Persian Gulf sent to\r\n     the local Government a maund of seed of the 'very finest\r\n     tobacco grown in Persia,' and with it he sent some\r\n     observations on the mode of cultivating tobacco in the\r\n     neighborhood of Shiraz. In 1867 fifteen small packets of\r\n     genuine Shiraz tobacco were forwarded for trial in the\r\n     Bombay Presidency. Of the seed sown in Kolhopoor, about\r\n     eight or nine germinated, and the plants grew to a height of\r\n     five feet two inches; of these only four survived. There\r\n     were two varieties, one with oblong the other with circular\r\n     leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco field in India.]\r\n\r\n     \"Of the seeds sent to Kandesh, only a few germinated. All\r\n     the seed put down in the Victoria Gardens failed. That sent\r\n     to Sind, though said to have been carefully sown, also\r\n     failed to germinate. The Conservator of Forests had the\r\n     seeds sent him sown in beds, and the plants, when a few\r\n     inches in height, were transplanted into pots. They grew\r\n     with the greatest luxuriance, and produced abundance of\r\n     flowers and seed. Some of the seed was sent to the collector\r\n     of Kaira, who forwarded a sample of the tobacco grown from\r\n     it. The Conservator considered the produce very good, and\r\n     the secretary of the Agri-Horticultural Society pronounced\r\n     it 'of a superior kind.' The flavor was exceedingly fine,\r\n     but it had not been allowed to come to maturity, hence it\r\n     was thin and shriveled. It had also been spoilt by rain,\r\n     and consequently its market value could not be fairly\r\n     tested. The experiment, it is clear, was not conducted with\r\n     proper care by most of those to whom the seed was confided,\r\n     but the Local Government considered that on the whole the\r\n     result was satisfactory, as showing that there was every\r\n     probability that Shiraz tobacco, with care and proper\r\n     gardening, might be introduced into the Bombay Presidency.\r\n\r\n     \"In August, 1869, the Bombay Government again distributed a\r\n     small supply of seed of the Shiraz, Havana, and other\r\n     varieties to the superintendents of cotton experiments, and\r\n     to the collectors of Kaira, Khandesh, Dharwar, and\r\n     Kurrachee, for experimental cultivation. The seeds did well\r\n     in the hands of all the superintendents, who reported very\r\n     favorably on the plants raised from them. In Sind only the\r\n     soil in which the seed was sown proved unsuitable. In\r\n     Dharwar all the five varieties germinated, though the\r\n     Maryland failed to some extent, and a considerable quantity\r\n     of seed of each variety was secured. Of Latakia, only twenty\r\n     grains were sent to the superintendent; and the quantity in\r\n     each case increased to one pound from the produce of the\r\n     plants. These two varieties of tobacco, however, were not so\r\n     much admired by the cultivators as Shiraz, Havana, and\r\n     Maryland, to which they gave a decided preference. The only\r\n     varieties of seed which were available for experiments at\r\n     Broach and Veermgaum were Havana and Shiraz. In both places\r\n     the plants came up well, and a large quantity of seed was\r\n     obtained from them. That sent to Broach arrived a little too\r\n     late in the season to admit of an extensive experiment being\r\n     made; this indeed appears to have been the case at all the\r\n     other places. The seed, however, was of good quality,\r\n     germinated freely, and produced excellent plants in a very\r\n     short time.\r\n\r\n     \"The first transplanting was made out into a field in an\r\n     open piece of land, where they commenced growing vigorously,\r\n     but the rains being then over, swarms of small locusts made\r\n     their appearance, and ate up the young plants before they\r\n     had thoroughly established themselves in the ground. The\r\n     second lot was transplanted into a more sheltered patch,\r\n     where the progress was all that could be desired, both the\r\n     varieties growing rapidly, the Havana especially producing\r\n     some leaves of enormous size. The first cutting was\r\n     entrusted to a potel, who managed it according to the native\r\n     process of curing. The tobacco was so strong, however, that\r\n     only old confirmed smokers could manage it. The most\r\n     formidable difficulty which presented itself was the\r\n     management of the midrib, which in the large leaves was\r\n     extremely coarse and juicy. When the leaves were made up\r\n     into hands for the purpose of fermentation before the midrib\r\n     was thoroughly dry, the result was invariably mould and\r\n     discoloration. On the other hand, when dried sufficiently to\r\n     insure freedom from mould, the lamina of the leaf became so\r\n     brittle that it was crushed to powder at the slightest\r\n     touch, and so wrinkled and dry that the heaps did not\r\n     ferment at all. Of the varieties supplied, the Shiraz,\r\n     Havana, and Maryland attracted most attention and promised\r\n     the best results. The great drawback was the curing part of\r\n     the process. So far as the cultivation was concerned, there\r\n     was every prospect of success; but not so with regard to the\r\n     curing.\"\r\n\r\nRobertson says of the curing of the leaf:--\r\n\r\n     \"In my opinion, all efforts to produce good tobacco will be\r\n     useless until the services of a competent curer are\r\n     obtained.\"\r\n\r\nHe considers the fault of all Indian tobacco to lie in the curing. The\r\nleaf itself is good, and it is simply the art of curing that should be\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\n     \"I have cured tobacco of different varieties, some of which\r\n     would hold a good place in the English market, but the fault\r\n     generally found with the tobacco is that it is too full\r\n     flavored. Further experiments were carried on in the same\r\n     districts with varying results. In Sind the experiments and\r\n     their results were insignificant. In Broach they were\r\n     somewhat more successful, the superintendent thus\r\n     summarising his experience:--'Havana, Shiraz, and other\r\n     varieties of exotic tobacco will, with ordinary care and\r\n     attention, yield fair and certain crops on ordinary black\r\n     land, and presumably on every other kind to be met with in\r\n     Guzerat. By the skillful application of manure, leaf of any\r\n     desired quality or peculiarity of flavor and texture may be\r\n     obtained. The quantity of produce is so great that, should\r\n     it be found practicable to cure the leaf well enough to make\r\n     it a salable article in the European market, a source of\r\n     profit by no means insignificant would be opened up to the\r\n     Guzerat ryot. For the native market the country plant is\r\n     more suitable, and its cultivation consequently the more\r\n     profitable.' In Dharwar the superintendent was enabled to\r\n     distribute seed in sufficient quantities to those applying\r\n     for it, but found the ryots would not cultivate it on a\r\n     large scale, being apprehensive of loss. Native tobacco he\r\n     considers less liable to injury than the exotic varieties\r\n     during the squally weather prevalent about the time the leaf\r\n     is approaching maturity.\"\r\n\r\nRobertson, in replying to the assertion that the tobacco of India\r\ncontains little if any nicotine, says:\r\n\r\n     \"It appears to me that there must be some mistake as to the\r\n     tobacco containing little or no nicotine. Very many have\r\n     tried the tobacco, and pronounce it to be good, with,\r\n     however, the fault of being exceedingly strong. Now, the\r\n     strength of tobacco comes from its nicotine, and if the\r\n     specimens I sent contain no nicotine, whence the strength? I\r\n     believe that nothing destroys tobacco so much as moistening\r\n     it. How, then, are acetic acid and chloride of soda to be\r\n     used in the curing? If the process of desiccation had been\r\n     carried on too quickly, the tobacco would have been of\r\n     either a green or greenish-yellow color. If too slowly, it\r\n     would have been black, like much of the country tobacco. I\r\n     perceive that the amount of nicotine in a great measure\r\n     depends on the extent to which the leaf is allowed to ripen.\r\n     The riper the leaf the more the nicotine. The amount of\r\n     nicotine does not appear to depend on the amount of curing.\r\n     The soil the tobacco was grown in is a hardish red moorum\r\n     soil, containing much iron; probably that may account for\r\n     the red coloring matter being so much developed. I intend to\r\n     have some of each description of the tobacco leaf analyzed,\r\n     and also intend to submit the soil in which it was grown to\r\n     the same process. I have had some of the cigars packed up\r\n     for some months to test how far they are proof against\r\n     insects. None have been attacked by insects. Some Manilla\r\n     cigars, some Trichinopoly cheroots, all packed up at the\r\n     same time, have, however, been entirely destroyed by\r\n     insects.\r\n\r\n     \"It is clear from the reports that both in Guzerat and\r\n     Khandesh, Havana and Shiraz tobacco will flourish, and that\r\n     they may be introduced without difficulty. The ryots, it is\r\n     said, preferred the new kinds to their own, and desire their\r\n     introduction, the foreign varieties commanding a higher\r\n     price in the market. The chief drawback is the want of\r\n     knowledge and appliances for the proper curing of the leaf.\r\n     This, indeed, is the great drawback throughout India. In the\r\n     district of Kaira the seed is always sown in nursery beds in\r\n     the month of July, and transplanting commences about the end\r\n     of August, the operation continuing for about two months.\r\n     The tobacco planted on the dry soil called 'koormit' ripens\r\n     and is fit for cutting in January and February; that which\r\n     is grown on irrigated land during March and April. In\r\n     Canara, tobacco is generally grown in elevated situations.\r\n     The seed is sown in August, and the seedlings are\r\n     transplanted in November, the crop arriving at maturity in\r\n     three or four months. North Canara derives its supply\r\n     chiefly from Mysore, the leaf produced in that province\r\n     being said to be less liable to affect the head than that of\r\n     the Canara plant.\"\r\n\r\nThe Turk and his family love to cultivate tobacco as well as to smoke\r\nit; and give it their attention from seed-sowing until it is sold to\r\nthe merchant. The Turk is very particular in cultivating it, as on its\r\ncolor depends in a great measure its value. He commences work on his\r\nplant-bed in March, sowing the seed about the same time as the\r\nVirginia planters. After the leaves are gathered the same scrupulous\r\ncare is taken with them; especially in drying and baling, that the\r\nleaf may be in just the right condition to ferment properly, and be\r\nready to be assorted by the \"tobacco pickers.\" The Turk presses his\r\nwhole family into the cultivation of the plants. The children are\r\nengaged in weeding while he waters the beds or prepares the tobacco\r\nfield for the planting of the tobacco. In pruning and picking the\r\nleaves he removes only those that are small--the removal of which will\r\nstill further advance the growth of the plants, and is careful to\r\ngather only those leaves that are turning yellow, giving evidence of\r\ntheir maturity. Says one in regard to the cultivation of tobacco in\r\nTurkey:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Turkish tobacco going to market.]\r\n\r\n     \"The Turk and his family, it will seem, have now been\r\n     occupied upon their tobacco crop for nearly a whole year.\r\n     The leaf is just becoming a bright light yellow when it\r\n     falls into the hands of the merchant, and it is during this\r\n     period that the process of fermentation or heating generally\r\n     occurs, before which the tobacco can not be shipped. The\r\n     bales having been placed in the merchant's store, are left\r\n     end up until a fermentation or baking has taken place, the\r\n     ends being reversed every three or four days. In the course\r\n     of a few weeks a bale is reduced to about two-thirds of its\r\n     original size. It is then placed upon its sides to cool.\r\n     When it is discovered to be cold it is broken open by the\r\n     native tobacco-pickers, and every leaf sorted and\r\n     classified. The patience with which this operation is\r\n     carried out is truly astonishing. There is a good deal of\r\n     difference in their rate of work. One man may pick only\r\n     fifty pounds weight a day, while another does twice that\r\n     quantity. It is necessary to watch them closely, or they\r\n     will put a dirty brown leaf with a pale yellow. They neither\r\n     know nor care about the losses that may be incurred by the\r\n     merchant, whose samples may be thus spoiled. A bale of leaf\r\n     purchased at five piastres per _oque_, when dissected by the\r\n     Greek for various markets will be found to contain varieties\r\n     ranging in price from 5 to 60 piastres; of these some are\r\n     dispatched to Odessa, some to Smyrna, others to\r\n     Constantinople, Alexandria, and England--the mixed and\r\n     common qualities generally to the latter country, the price\r\n     there obtained being the least remunerative to the Greek\r\n     shippers. The bales are brought from the interior to the\r\n     shipping ports upon mules, each animal carrying two bales;\r\n     and it is a pretty sight to witness, say 150 mules at a\r\n     time, crossing mountains and rugged paths with their\r\n     burdens, followed by perhaps fifty camels laden with cotton,\r\n     marching to the merry tinkle of the bells on their necks.\r\n     When the tobacco reaches the shipping port the troubles of\r\n     the exporter are intensified. The bales are first taken to\r\n     the Custom House, and there weighed. The weights thus\r\n     arrived at are compared with the quantity received from the\r\n     interior, and if there be any material difference the\r\n     shipper has to account for it. If any has been sold for\r\n     consumption in Turkey, duty has to be paid upon the amount;\r\n     and in order that no part of his shipment may be used in the\r\n     country, he has to sign a bond that the tobacco shall not be\r\n     landed in any other port of Turkey. On the arrival of the\r\n     tobacco in England, the landing certificates are forwarded\r\n     to Turkey. It is in this way that the trade is retained in\r\n     the hands of a few Greeks, who naturally put every obstacle\r\n     in the way of the foreigner, whose sole remedy is at last\r\n     found to be the payment of the universal 'backshish,' to the\r\n     comptroller of customs.\"\r\n\r\nThe merchant who buys the tobacco of the planter at a low price, and\r\nthereby takes the profit from him of cultivating it, is preyed upon in\r\nthe same manner by the Greek buyers who have the sole monopoly of the\r\ntrade. Like Shiraz tobacco, that of Turkey has to be handled\r\nfrequently and pass through several stages of curing before it is\r\nready to be manufactured. In this respect it is unlike most of the\r\ntobaccos of America, but its treatment is not unlike that of the\r\nvarieties of the East.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Japan tobacco field.]\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant is cultivated with great success in many of the\r\nprovinces of Japan, and is exported in large quantities to Europe. The\r\nleaf is excellent, and is in request by many buyers of Eastern\r\ntobaccos. Robertson gives the following interesting account of the\r\nJapan tobacco fields:--\r\n\r\n     \"According to a native account, tobacco was introduced into\r\n     Japan in the year 1605, and was first planted at Nagasaki in\r\n     Hizen. It is now very generally grown throughout the\r\n     country. In the province of Awa, where a great deal of\r\n     tobacco is grown, the seed is sown in early spring in fields\r\n     well exposed to the sun and duly prepared for its reception.\r\n     Well sifted stable manure is strewn over the field, and the\r\n     seedlings appear after the lapse of about twenty days. The\r\n     old manure is then swept away, and liquid manure applied\r\n     from time to time. If the plants are too dense they are\r\n     thinned out. The larger plants are now planted out into\r\n     fields well prepared for the purpose in rows, with about\r\n     eight inches space between each plant, the furrows between\r\n     each row being about two feet wide. They are again well\r\n     sprinkled with liquid manure, also with the lees of oil at\r\n     intervals of about seven days. A covering of wheat or millet\r\n     bran is now laid over the furrows. The bitter taste of the\r\n     leaf is in a measure an effectual safeguard against the\r\n     ravages of insects, but the leaves are nevertheless\r\n     carefully tended to prevent damage from such cause. If the\r\n     reproduction from seed is not desired the flowers should be\r\n     cut off and the stem pruned down, otherwise the leaves will\r\n     lose in scent and flavor. In Osumi exceptional attention is\r\n     paid to the cultivation of the tobacco plant. The lees of\r\n     oil, if liberally used, and stable manure sparsely applied,\r\n     have great effect on the plant, producing a small leaf with\r\n     an excellent flavor; while, if the opposite course is\r\n     followed, the leaves grow to an immense size, but are\r\n     inferior in taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transplanting.]\r\n\r\n     \"When the flowers are in full bloom the 'sand' leaves are\r\n     picked. After the lapse of twelve or fourteen days the\r\n     leaves are gathered by twos. Any leaves that may remain are\r\n     afterwards broken off along with the stalk. Any sand\r\n     adhering to the leaves is removed with a brush; the stems\r\n     having been cut off, the leaves are rolled round, firmly\r\n     pressed down with a thin board, and cut exactly in the\r\n     centre. The two halves are then placed one on the top of the\r\n     other in such manner that the edges exactly correspond, and\r\n     being in this position firmly compressed between two boards,\r\n     they are cut into fine strips, the degree of fineness\r\n     depending on the skill of the cutter. A machine made of\r\n     hard wood, but with the vital parts of iron, is used by some\r\n     persons for this purpose. The machine was devised about\r\n     sixty years ago by a skillful Yeddo mechanic, the idea being\r\n     taken from those used in Osaka and Kiyoto for cutting thread\r\n     used for weaving into silk embroidery. Since then numerous\r\n     improvements have been made in it, and it is now extremely\r\n     well adapted for the economization of labor. Another machine\r\n     was invented about eight years since, also by a Yeddo\r\n     mechanic. It is smaller than the first mentioned, but being\r\n     very easily worked is much in use. Tobacco is sometimes cut\r\n     in the following crude manner:--The leaves are piled one on\r\n     top of the other, tightly compressed into the consistency of\r\n     a board, and then cut into shavings by a carpenter's plane.\r\n     This is, however, about the worst method, and even the best\r\n     tobacco, if treated in such fashion, loses its flavor and\r\n     valuable qualities.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chinese tobacco field.]\r\n\r\nIn China[67] tobacco is cultivated in the western part of the empire,\r\nand grows almost as large as most American varieties. Chinese tobacco\r\nis usually light in color, of a thin, silky texture, and mixed with\r\nTurkey tobacco, is a considerable feature in the export trade of that\r\ncountry. The Chinese cultivate the plant like the Japanese, and give\r\nit as much care and attention as they do the tea plant. The leaves are\r\ngathered when ripe, and are dried and well-assorted before baling. The\r\nChinese planter often raises large fields of the plants, and employs\r\nmany hands to tend and cultivate them. We give a cut of a tobacco\r\nfield and the planter looking at the field and noting the progress of\r\nthe laborers.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 67: I saw also great plantations of tobacco,\r\n              which they call tharr, and which yield very considerable\r\n              profit, as it is universally used in smoking, by persons\r\n              of all ranks, of both sexes in China; and, besides great\r\n              quantities are sent to the Mongolls, who prefer the\r\n              Chinese manner of preparing it before any other. They\r\n              make it into a gross powder, like saw-dust, which they\r\n              keep in a small bag, and fill their little brass pipes\r\n              out of it, without touching the tobacco with their\r\n              fingers.--_Bell's Travels in Asia_, 1716, 1719, 1722.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco field in Persia.]\r\n\r\nIn Persia tobacco is cultivated near Shiraz, which gives name to the\r\nvariety. The soil is very fertile and richly cultivated. Not only does\r\nthe tobacco plant flourish finely, but all kinds of vegetables grow to\r\nperfection. The Persians cultivate the plant principally for their own\r\nuse. It is a fine smoking tobacco, and when cured properly is said to\r\nbe equal to Latakia. Their mode of curing is unlike that adopted by\r\nany other cultivators of the weed but is very successful, and is no\r\ndoubt the proper method of preparing the leaves for use. Their mode of\r\npressing in large cakes is unlike that of any other growers--but\r\ndoubtless adds to the aromatic quality of the leaf which makes it so\r\npopular in the East.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco field is trenched so as to retain water, while the\r\nplants are set on the ridges where they flourish and mature until the\r\nbuds and flowers are broken off. The harvest occurs in the autumn,\r\nwhen the singular process of curing begins.\r\n\r\nAbbott says of the culture and commerce of tobacco in Persia:\r\n\r\n     \"Jehrum, South Persia, is the principal mart for tobacco,\r\n     which is brought here from all the surrounding districts,\r\n     and disposed of to traders, who distribute it over the\r\n     country far and near. These traders are numerous, and many\r\n     established here are wealthy; they usually transact their\r\n     business in their private houses, without resorting to the\r\n     caravansaries of which there are six in the place. There are\r\n     many grades and qualities of Shiraz tobacco but that\r\n     produced at Tuffres (according to Forster), a town about one\r\n     hundred miles to the south-west of Turshish, is esteemed the\r\n     best in Persia.\r\n\r\n     \"Of the many varieties of the tobacco plant grown in the\r\n     East, that known as Manilla is among the most famous and the\r\n     most extensively cultivated. It is grown in several of the\r\n     Philippine islands, particularly in Luzon and the southern\r\n     group, known as the Visayos. The Philippines are a large\r\n     group of islands in the North Pacific Ocean, discovered by\r\n     Magellan in 1521; they were afterwards taken posession of by\r\n     the Spaniards, in the reign of Philip II., from whom they\r\n     take their name.\r\n\r\n     \"The islands are said to be eleven hundred in number, but\r\n     some hundreds of them are very small, and all are nominally\r\n     subject to the Spanish government at Manilla. The\r\n     Philippines produce a great variety of tropical products\r\n     such as rice, coffee, sugar, indigo, tobacco, cotton, cacao,\r\n     abaca, or vegetable silk, pepper, gums, cocoa-nuts,\r\n     dye-woods, timber of all descriptions for furniture and the\r\n     buildings, rattans of various kinds, and all the agreeable\r\n     fruits of the tropics. On the shores are found nacre, or\r\n     mother of pearl, magnificent pearls, bird's-nests, shells of\r\n     every description, an incredible quantity of excellent fish,\r\n     and the _trépang_, or _balatê_, a sea-worm, or animal\r\n     substance, found on the shores of the Philippine Islands,\r\n     resembling a large pudding. The Chinese esteem it as a great\r\n     delicacy and mix it with fowl and vegetables. The\r\n     inhabitants practise various kinds of industry; they weave\r\n     matting of extraordinary fineness and of the brightest\r\n     colors, straw hats, cigar cases and brackets; they\r\n     manufacture cloth and tissues of every sort from cotton,\r\n     silk, and abaca; they, from filaments taken from the leaves\r\n     of the _etuana_, make cambric of a texture much finer than\r\n     that of France; and they also manufacture coarse strong\r\n     cloth for sails, and ropes and cables of all dimensions;\r\n     they tan and dress leather and skins to perfection; they\r\n     manufacture coarse earthen ware, and forge and polish arms\r\n     of various kinds; they build ships of heavy tonnage, and\r\n     also light and neat boats; and at Manilla they frame and\r\n     finish-off beautiful carriages; they are also very clever\r\n     workers in gold, silver, and copper; and the Indian women\r\n     are specially expert in needlework, and in all kinds of\r\n     embroidery.\r\n\r\n     \"The island of Luzon is the largest of the Philippines, and\r\n     extends from north to south for the length of about six\r\n     degrees. It is divided throughout its whole extent by a\r\n     chain of mountains, which in general owe their formation to\r\n     volcanic eruptions. In the provinces of Laguna and Batangas\r\n     there is the high mountain called Maijai, one of the\r\n     loftiest in Luzon, which is beyond doubt an ancient crater;\r\n     on the summit a little lake is found, the depth of which\r\n     cannot be measured. At some period the lava that then flowed\r\n     from the summit towards the base, in the neighborhood of the\r\n     town of Nacarlan, covered up immense cavities, which are now\r\n     recognizable by the sonorous noise of the ground for a great\r\n     extent; and sometimes it happens that, in consequence of an\r\n     inundation or an earthquake, this volcanic crust is in some\r\n     places broken, and exposes to the view enormous caverns,\r\n     which the Indians call 'the mouths of hell.' In the district\r\n     about the town of San Pablo, which is situated on the\r\n     mountain, are found great numbers of little circular lakes\r\n     and immense heaps of rotten stones, basalt, and different\r\n     descriptions of lava, which show that all these lakes are\r\n     nothing else than the craters of old volcanoes. Altogether\r\n     the soil to the southward, in the province of Albai, is\r\n     completely volcanic, and the frequent eruptions of the\r\n     volcano bearing that name may, as the natives say, be\r\n     attributed to the same cause as the earthquakes so often\r\n     felt in the island of Luzon. Over almost the whole of these\r\n     mountains, where fire has played so conspicuous a part,\r\n     there is a great depth of vegetable earth, and they are\r\n     covered with a most splendid vegetation. Their declivities\r\n     nourish immense forests and fine pastures in which grow\r\n     gigantic trees--palm trees, rattans, and lianas of a\r\n     thousand kinds, or gramineous plants of various sorts,\r\n     particularly the wild sugar cane, which rises to the height\r\n     of from nine to twelve feet from the ground; in their\r\n     interior are rich mines of copper, gold, iron, and coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Growing tobacco on the Philippine islands.]\r\n\r\n     \"There are two distinct and strongly marked seasons in the\r\n     island of Luzon, namely, the rainy or the wintry season, and\r\n     the dry or summer season. For six months of the year--that\r\n     is from June to December--the wind blows from the south-west\r\n     to the north-east, and then the declivities of the mountains\r\n     and all the western side of the island are in the season of\r\n     the rains; in the six other months, the wind changes, and\r\n     blows from the north-east to the south-west, when all the\r\n     eastern parts of the island have the season of winter.\r\n     During the rainy season, the incessant fall of rain on the\r\n     mountains causes the rivers, both large and small, to\r\n     overflow and to become torrents, that rush down upon the\r\n     plains, covering them with water, and depositing the broken\r\n     earth and slime which they have gathered in their course. In\r\n     the dry season, water is supplied for irrigation from\r\n     reservoirs, which are carefully filled during the rains.\r\n     From these causes it follows that without any manuring, and\r\n     with scarcely any improvement from human industry, the soil\r\n     of the Philippines is as fertile as any in the world; so\r\n     that, without great labor, the cultivator has most abundant\r\n     harvests.\"\r\n\r\nThe above description of the Philippines by Gironiere gives a faithful\r\naccount of the vast resources of the islands. Of the products\r\ncultivated rice and tobacco are the most important. The finest tobacco\r\nplantations are situated in the northern parts of the island of Luzon,\r\nand furnish the finest quality of Manilla tobacco. That grown in the\r\nVisayos is of an inferior quality, and is sold to merchants holding a\r\npermit to purchase at the shipping ports and transport to Manilla for\r\nsale to the government. In the island of Luzon, the greatest quantity\r\nof tobacco is cultivated in the provinces of Nueva Ecija and Cagavan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco plow.]\r\n\r\nTomlinson in an account of the tobacco of the Philippines says:\r\n\"Manilla leaf comes from the three principal districts of the island\r\nof Luzon--Visayos, Ygarotes and Cagayan.\" The mode of cultivation does\r\nnot differ in any great respect from that followed in other parts of\r\nthe world. Great seed beds are made on the plantations where the\r\nplants are grown until ready to transplant in the tobacco ground.\r\nUnlike most land adapted for tobacco, large crops are grown without\r\nthe aid of any fertilizer whatever. In cultivating the plants,\r\nbuffaloes are used, yoked one after the other, going between the rows\r\nseveral times, and at the last ploughing leaving a trench in the\r\nmiddle of the rows, for letting off the water. The Indian plow used in\r\ncultivating is exceedingly simple: it is composed of four pieces of\r\nwood which the most unhandy ploughman can put together, with the mould\r\nboard and share, which are of cast iron. The lightness and simplicity\r\nof this plough render it easy to be used in every kind of cultivation,\r\nwhere the plantations are divided into rows, such as those of tobacco,\r\nmaize and sugar cane. It is used with great advantage, not only for\r\ncutting down weeds, but also for giving to each row a ploughing, which\r\nis serviceable to the plantation, and which is less costly and\r\nquicker than simple weeding with the mattock.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves are ripe they are stripped from the stalks and\r\nseparated into three classes, according to their size, and afterwards\r\nmade into bunches of fifty or a hundred, by passing through them, near\r\nthe foot, a little bamboo cane, as if it was a skewer, by which the\r\nbunches are afterwards hung up to dry in vast sheds, into which the\r\nsun's rays cannot enter, but in which the air circulates freely; they\r\nare left to hang there until they become quite dry, and for this, a\r\ngreater or less time is required, according to the state of the\r\nweather. When the drying is effected the leaves are placed according\r\nto their quality, in bales of twenty-five pounds, and in that state\r\nthey are handed over to the administration of the monopoly. Gironiere\r\nin describing the mode of culture on the tobacco plantations says:\r\n\r\n     \"During the first two months after the transplanting it is\r\n     indispensably necessary to give four ploughings to the\r\n     ground between the rows of the plants, and every fifteen\r\n     days to handpick, or even better, to root out with the\r\n     mattock, all the weeds which cannot be touched by the\r\n     plough. These four ploughings ought to be done in such a\r\n     manner as to leave alternately a furrow in the middle of\r\n     each line, and on the sides, and consequently, at the last\r\n     ploughing, the earth covers the plants up to their first\r\n     leaves, leaving a trench for carrying off all water that may\r\n     accumulate during the heavy rains. As soon as each plant has\r\n     gained a proper height, its head is lopped off to force the\r\n     sap to turn into the leaves, and, in a few weeks afterwards,\r\n     it is fit for being gathered.\"\r\n\r\nThe tobacco fields or plantations are very large, and together with\r\nthe vast sheds for curing, the fields present a beautiful appearance;\r\nthe long straight rows with their dark green leaves adding not a\r\nlittle to the beauty and variety of the landscape. The great growers\r\nof the plant are very careful in cultivating the fields and give the\r\ntobacco frequent hoeings, until ready to be gathered and taken to the\r\nsheds. The planters are obliged to take the utmost pains, as the\r\nproduct is obliged to be given up to the monopolizing government which\r\nis the sole purchaser, and which, in its great establishment at\r\nBinondoc, employs continually from 15,000 to 20,000 workmen and\r\nworkwomen in manufacturing cigars for the consumption of the country\r\nand for exportation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spanish planters.]\r\n\r\nManilla tobacco is much esteemed in the islands both by the Spaniards\r\nand the Chinese. The custom of smoking is universal among all classes\r\nand at all times. In the house, on the road and street, the aroma of a\r\nfragrant Manilla is ever borne on the breeze. The Spaniards are the\r\nprincipal owners of the tobacco fields, and, like their brother\r\nplanters on the island of Cuba, are fond of the weed and its more\r\npotent companion. After a luxurious breakfast the planter elevates his\r\nfeet for a quiet smoke, and lights either a cigar or cheroot, filling\r\nthe room with smoke and with the most fragrant perfume.\r\n\r\nOf all the various products cultivated, but few vie with the tobacco\r\nplant in beauty of form and general appearance. By its great variety\r\nof colors in leaves and flowers, it offers a striking contrast with\r\nthe more sombre hues of most other plants. When left to grow until\r\nthe plants have reached full size, the tobacco field has the\r\nappearance of a vast flower garden, the tiny blossoms exhaling their\r\nfragrance and the entire plant emitting odors as rare and as delicate\r\nas the most fragrant exotic. In the tropics the finest tobacco\r\nplantations are found, as nature is more lavish, not only in the\r\nrichness of the soil, but in the variety of the vegetable products.\r\nHere the tobacco plant attains its finest form and most delicately\r\nflavored leaves. The hues of the flowers are brighter and their\r\nfragrance sweeter. In the tropics the tobacco field may be scented\r\nfrom afar, as its odors are wafted on the breeze. In its native home\r\nit flourishes and matures as readily as the more common kinds of\r\nvegetation, while it affords the planter a larger revenue than many of\r\nthe more useful of nature's products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant almost vies with the palm in the number of\r\nvarieties; botanists having enumerated as many as forty, which by no\r\nmeans includes the entire number now being cultivated. The plant shows\r\nalso a great variety of forms, leaves, color of flowers, and texture.\r\nEach kind has some peculiar feature or quality not found in another;\r\nthus, one variety will have large leaves, while another will have\r\nsmall ones; one kind leaves flowers of a pink or yellow color, another\r\nwhite; one variety will produce a leaf black or brown, another yellow\r\nor dark red. The following list includes nearly all of the principal\r\nvarieties now cultivated:--Connecticut seed leaf (broad and narrow\r\nleaf), New York seed leaf, Pennsylvania (Duck Island), Virginia and\r\nMaryland (Pryor and Frederick, James River, etc.), North Carolina\r\n(Yellow Orinoco, and Gooch or Pride of Granville, etc.), Ohio Seed\r\nleaf (broad leaf), Ohio leaf (Thick Set, Pear Tree, Burley, and\r\nWhite), Texas, Louisiana (Perique), Florida, Kentucky, Missouri,\r\nWisconsin, Havana, Yara, Mexican, St. Domingo, Columbia (Columbian,\r\nGiron, Esmelraldia, Palmyra, Ambolima), Rio Grande, Brazil, Orinoco,\r\nParaguay, Porto Rico, Arracan, Greek, Java, Sumatra, Japan, Hungarian,\r\nChina, Manilla, Algerian, Turkey, Holland (Amersfoort), Syrian\r\n(Latakia), French (St. Omer), Russian, and Circassian. Many of these\r\nvarieties are well known to commerce, and others are hardly known\r\noutside the limit of their cultivation.\r\n\r\nAll of these varieties may be divided into three classes,[68] viz.:\r\ncigar, snuff, and cut-leaf tobacco. The first class, cigar leaf,\r\nincludes all those varieties of tobacco that are used in the\r\nmanufacture of cigars, and embraces the finest quality of tobacco\r\ngrown, including Connecticut seed leaf, Havana, Yara, Manilla, Giron,\r\nParaguayan, Mexican, Brazilian, Sumatra, etc. The second class\r\nembraces all of the varieties used in the manufacture of snuff, such\r\nas Virginia, Holland (Amersfoort), Brazilian, French (St. Omer), etc.\r\nThe third class includes all of those tobaccos used for smoking and\r\nchewing purposes, such as Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio,\r\nMaryland, Latakia, Perique, Turkish, and others.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 68: Probably most writers would divide tobacco\r\n              into but two classes, including tobacco used for the\r\n              manufacture of snuff with cut tobacco.]\r\n\r\nSouth American tobaccos are almost exclusively used for the\r\nmanufacture of cigars. Although of various qualities, they possess the\r\ndistinctive flavor which characterizes all tobacco used for this\r\npurpose. This is generally the case with most of the tobacco grown in\r\nthe tropics--it seems to be especially adapted for the manufacture of\r\ncigars, rather than for cutting purposes. European tobaccos are milder\r\nin flavor, and are used extensively in the manufacture of snuff; while\r\nthe tobacco of the East is well adapted for the pipe.\r\n\r\nTobacco to be used for cigars must not only be of good flavor, but\r\nmust burn freely, without which it has no real value for this purpose.\r\nNon-burning tobaccos cannot be used, and are either employed in the\r\nmanufacture of snuff or for cutting.\r\n\r\nOf the many kinds of tobacco of both the Old and New World, doubtless\r\nthe most curious of all is that kind known as\r\n\r\n\r\nDWARF TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mexican dwarf tobacco.]\r\n\r\nThis plant is a native of Mexico, and was discovered by Houston, who\r\nfound it growing near Vera Cruz. This is probably the smallest kind of\r\ntobacco known. The plant grows to the height of about eighteen inches,\r\nthe leaves growing tufts at the base of the plant. Some have supposed\r\nthis tobacco to be what is known as Deer Tongue, which is used for\r\nflavoring, but it is quite probable that it is entirely different. The\r\nleaf is small and light green, and it is quite a showy plant when in\r\nblossom. As a curiosity it can hardly fail to attract attention from\r\nall those acquainted and interested in tobacco, but will hardly admit\r\nof cultivation, on account of the absence of leaves, with the\r\nexception of the few growing near the ground. Of all the tobaccos used\r\nfor the manufacture of cigars, none have obtained an equal reputation\r\n(simply as a cigar wrapper) with the famous and much sought for\r\nvariety known as\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT SEED LEAF,\r\n\r\nwhich in all respects towers far above the seed products of the other\r\nstates. The varieties cultivated in the United States and known as\r\n\"seed leaf\" tobaccos, are grown in Connecticut, Massachusetts,\r\nVermont, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin.\r\nAll of the seed leaf of these states is used exclusively in the\r\nmanufacture of cigars. Connecticut seed leaf is justly celebrated as\r\nthe finest known for cigar wrappers, from the superiority of its color\r\nand texture, and the good burning quality of the leaf. The plant grows\r\nto the height of about five feet, with leaves from two and one half to\r\nthree feet in length and from fifteen to twenty inches broad, fitted\r\npreëminently by their large size for wrappers, which are obtained at\r\nsuch a distance from the stem of the leaf as to be free from large\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nConnecticut seed leaf tobacco in color, is either dark or light\r\ncinnamon, two of the most fashionable colors to be found in American\r\ntobaccos. The plant is strong and vigorous, ripening in a few weeks,\r\nand when properly cultivated attaining a very large size. There are\r\ntwo principal varieties of Connecticut seed leaf, viz.--broad and\r\nnarrow leaf: of these two, the broad leaf is considered the finest,\r\ncutting up to better advantage and ripening and curing fully as well.\r\nConnecticut seed leaf attains its finest form and perfection of leaf\r\nin the rich meadows of the Connecticut Valley, where it has been\r\ncultivated to a greater or less extent for nearly half a century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Connecticut seed leaf.]\r\n\r\nThe plant is one of the most showy of all the varieties of tobacco.\r\nThe stalk is straight and large, while the leaf (especially the broad)\r\nis admirably proportioned, and the top is broad and graceful,\r\nrendering it far more symmetrical in appearance than many of the\r\nsmaller varieties.\r\n\r\nBefore Connecticut tobacco became known as a wrapper, Maryland and\r\nHavana tobaccos were used for this purpose, and when Connecticut first\r\ncame into use, it was only as a filler. This variety differs very\r\nmaterially from Havana in this respect--it has not that fine flavor of\r\nCuba tobacco, but in texture is much superior. The lighter shades of\r\nit burn purely and freely, leaving a white or pearl colored ash, which\r\nis one of the best evidences of a good wrapper. The leaf also is\r\nvery firm and strong, and sufficiently elastic to bear considerable\r\nmanipulating in manufacture. The various shades also of the two\r\ncolors, dark and light brown or cinnamon, are among the finest and\r\nmost delicate of any to be found among the numerous kinds of tobacco\r\nused for cigars. The color of the wrapper, however, is merely a matter\r\nof taste; when first used for a wrapper the color in demand was a dark\r\nbrown or cinnamon, now it is light cinnamon leaf that is the most\r\nfashionable, and leaf of this color is considered the finest and of\r\nthe most delicate flavor. As a superior burning tobacco, seed leaf\r\nespecially commends itself, and while all of the seed products of the\r\nvarious states producing this description of tobacco, are remarkable\r\nfor their good burning qualities, none are more so than Connecticut\r\nseed leaf.\r\n\r\nThorough cultivation by the growers has made this quality of tobacco\r\nthe most profitable of any grown in the United States. Some\r\nconsiderable controversy has arisen among tobacco-growers concerning\r\nthe origin of this famous variety. One opinion sets forth that it\r\nsprung from plants or seeds brought from Virginia, while another is\r\nthat tobacco seed from Cuba gave it origin. Most probably the former\r\ntheory is correct, as the plant was cultivated in gardens in New\r\nEngland, during the reign of Charles I.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the system of cultivation pursued has been\r\nsuccessful in the production of a leaf tobacco that can hardly be\r\nimproved, so far as the texture of the leaf is concerned. Some of the\r\n\"selections\" of seed leaf have that fine soft feeling peculiar to\r\nsatin or silks, and we have seen specimens of such selections, that\r\nseemed almost destitute of veins, or anything that would naturally\r\nsuggest that it was a leaf. In this respect it is quite remarkable,\r\nfor while the leaf is very large the stem and veins are quite small,\r\nno larger than in many varieties with a much smaller leaf. From its\r\nfirst cultivation in the Connecticut valley, the quality has gradually\r\nimproved until now, and it seems at last to possess almost every\r\nfeature desirable in a good wrapper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Havana tobacco.]\r\n\r\nThis famous variety of the tobacco plant is by common consent the\r\nfinest flavored tobacco for cigars now being cultivated. Some,\r\nhowever, consider Paraguayian, Brazil, and Mexican coast tobacco its\r\nequals, while, according to Tomlinson, Macuba tobacco, grown on the\r\nisland of Martinica, stands at the head of all varieties of the plant.\r\nThese statements may, however, be regarded as mere opinions rather\r\nthan acknowledged facts.\r\n\r\nHavana tobacco, according to Hazard,\r\n                                     \"grows to a height of from six to\r\n     nine feet, as allowed, with oblong, spear-shaped leaves; the\r\n     tobacco being stronger when few leaves are permitted to\r\n     grow. The leaves when young are of a dark-green color and\r\n     have rather a smooth appearance, changing at maturity into\r\n     yellowish-green. The plant grows quickly, and by careful\r\n     pruning a fine colored leaf is obtained, varying from a\r\n     straw color to dark brown or black.\"\r\n                                          The plant bears a pink blossom,\r\nwhich is succeeded by capsules not quite as large as those of\r\nseed-leaf tobacco. The finest is grown in the Vuelta de Abajo, which,\r\nfor nearly a century, has been celebrated as a fine tobacco-producing\r\ndistrict. When growing, a _vega_ of Havana tobacco forms a most\r\npleasing feature of the landscape. As the plants ripen, the dark,\r\nglossy green of the leaves is succeeded by a lighter shade and a\r\nthickening of the leaf. The plant ripens in from eight to ten weeks\r\nafter being transplanted. The stalk and leaves are not as large as its\r\ngreat rival, Connecticut seed-leaf, but it far surpasses it in flavor.\r\nThe plant emits a pleasant odor while growing, like most varieties of\r\nthe plant grown in the tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\nYARA TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nThis variety of tobacco, like Havana, is grown upon the island of\r\nCuba, but is unlike it in flavor, as well as in the appearance of the\r\nplant. It is well known as an admirable tobacco for cigars, but is not\r\nsought after or grown to such an extent as Havana. The leaf when\r\ngrowing, is in color a fine green, and when cured is of considerable\r\nbody and fine texture. A writer in alluding to Yara tobacco says:\r\n\r\n     \"The most noted _vega_ or tobacco plantation is situated\r\n     near Santiago de Cuba and is called Yara. The choicest\r\n     tobacco is that grown on the banks of rivers which are\r\n     periodically overflowed. They are called Lo Rio, Rio Hondo,\r\n     and Pinar del Rio, and the tobacco is distinguished from all\r\n     other grown upon the island by a fine sand which is found in\r\n     the creases of the leaves.\"\r\n\r\nThe flavor of Yara tobacco is so essentially different from Havana,\r\nthat it is not cultivated as extensively, if indeed it could be. It is\r\ngrown more particularly for home use and for exporting to Europe,\r\nwhere it is considered one of the finest of tobaccos. Of the other\r\nvarieties grown in the West Indies such as St. Domingo, Jamaica, and\r\nTrinidad, much may be said both in praise and dispraise. St. Domingo\r\nand Trinidad have been cultivated for more than two hundred years. St.\r\nDomingo tobacco has a large leaf, but is of inferior flavor to most\r\nvarieties of West India tobacco.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Virginia tobacco.]\r\n\r\nVirginia tobacco has acquired a reputation which has gradually\r\nstrengthened for more than two hundred and fifty years. It was one of\r\nthe first products to be cultivated by the English colony, and in less\r\nthan a quarter of a century after the settlement of Virginia, had\r\nacquired a reputation hardly surpassed by its well known rivals,\r\nTrinidad, Brazil, St. Domingo, and Various tobaccos. The plant grows\r\nto the height of from five to seven feet; the leaves are long and\r\nbroad, and when cured are of various colors, from a rich brown to a\r\nfine yellow. The finest of Virginia tobacco comes from the mountainous\r\ncounties, but the amount is small in proportion to the vast quantities\r\nraised on the lowlands of the Dan and James rivers and their\r\ntributaries. The leaf grown in the higher counties of South-western\r\nVirginia is much lighter in color and much softer than the ordinary\r\nVirginia tobacco. Shades of color in Virginia tobacco (as well as in\r\nmost others) serve to determine its use, while texture and length of\r\nleaf affect as well its market value. There are various grades of\r\nVirginia tobacco, especially in that grown in Southside, Virginia.\r\n\"Long bright leaf\" is considered the finest, while that known as\r\n\"Luga\" is the poorest and lowest grade of leaf.\r\n\r\nThe staple known as James River tobacco has acquired a world-wide\r\nreputation, and the same ground is cultivated and planted with tobacco\r\nnow as in 1620. Virginia tobacco is known chiefly as a cut tobacco;\r\n\"good, stout snuff leaf\" is also obtained from it, which brings as\r\nmuch in European markets as \"fine spinners.\" Missouri, Kentucky, and\r\nsome parts of Ohio also produce large quantities for manufacturing\r\ninto chewing and smoking tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nOHIO TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ohio white tobacco.]\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant has been cultivated in this State for nearly fifty\r\nyears. Sullivan, in describing the kinds used for cutting, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Two kinds of seed are used, viz., the 'Thick Set' and the\r\n     'Pear Tree,' and of late years the 'Burley' has come into\r\n     favor. Nearly all tobacco grown in Ohio is 'fired,' that is,\r\n     cured by fires or flues; it is packed in hogsheads of about\r\n     eight hundred pounds net.\"\r\n\r\nAnother writer says:--\r\n\r\n     \"In some parts her soil produces a fine yellow article\r\n     called 'Northern Ohio;' it is manufactured into the finest\r\n     quality of smoking tobacco, and is extensively used by all\r\n     epicures of the meerschaum, both in this country and in\r\n     Europe. Ohio also produces another variety called Ohio seed\r\n     leaf, or more familiarly, 'Seed.'\"\r\n\r\nWhile in another section she produces an excellent article of leaf for\r\nchewing. Ohio tobacco of all kinds is a large plant, and cures \"down\"\r\nto fine colors. One variety for cutting, known as \"cinnamon blotch,\"\r\nis a leaf of good body and is considered an excellent tobacco for\r\nchewing. A few years since a variety originated in a very curious\r\nmanner. We give the account as published by Prof. E. W. Smith:--\r\n\r\n     \"This tobacco is known by the name of White tobacco. The\r\n     seed was procured about three years ago, in a very singular\r\n     way. There were a few hills of tobacco that looked very\r\n     singular, situated near a thicket of bushes and trees. The\r\n     rising morning sun sent its rays through this thicket,\r\n     striking diagonally upon a few hills, and producing by some\r\n     chemical law or daguerreotyping process the (white) tobacco.\r\n     The tobacco was allowed to go to seed. This seed was sown\r\n     the next year, and produced the same kind of tobacco. The\r\n     tobacco, before the white tobacco was daguerreotyped, was a\r\n     cinnamon blotch, so it may be seen by this freak of nature\r\n     how it was changed from red to white.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPERIQUE TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of tobacco well adapted for smoking, of all\r\ncolors and strengths. Of American tobaccos suitable for this purpose,\r\nnone have acquired a wider reputation at home than Perique. It is\r\ncultivated only in small quantities in one or two parishes in\r\nLouisiana. Perique tobacco may be used not only for smoking, but for\r\nchewing and for snuff. The leaf when cured measures some eighteen\r\ninches in length by fourteen in width, is thick and substantial, has\r\nthe appearance of a rich Kentucky tobacco, and when placed under press\r\nimmediately after being cured becomes black without the aid of any\r\nartificial means. It is put up in rolls, or, as they are called,\r\n\"carrots.\" This tobacco is raised mostly in the parish of St. James,\r\nLa., and derives its name from an old Spanish navigator who settled in\r\nSt. James parish in the year 1820. His first attempt at raising\r\ntobacco, for his own use, succeeded so well and gave him such a fine\r\nresult, (the plant developing itself to a great extent and being very\r\nrich,) that he concluded to devote all his time to the culture of\r\ntobacco, in order to make a living out of it.\r\n\r\nThe seed first used by him was the Kentucky, but this was subsequently\r\nchanged for the Virginia, which has been in use up to this time, being\r\nrenewed every four or five years. The tobacco originally put up by\r\nPerique was twisted by hand and placed under press for three or four\r\ndays, then taken out, untwisted, retwisted and replaced in the press\r\nfor five or six days. After undergoing the same process three or four\r\ndifferent times, it was finally left to remain under press for six\r\nmonths, and then taken out for use. Mr. Perique, however, soon made a\r\ncapital improvement in the mode of putting up his tobacco; for, as\r\nearly as the year 1824, we find the tobacco in beautiful rolls of four\r\npounds, and as hard as a \"Saucisson de Boulogne.\"\r\n\r\nThis tobacco, which has retained the name of its producer, is still\r\nmanufactured in the same manner as it was fifty-four years ago, the\r\nwork still being done entirely by hand. The plant is cultivated as the\r\nVirginia tobacco by about a dozen small planters in that part of the\r\nParish called \"Grande-Pointe,\" seven miles from the Mississippi river.\r\nA small quantity is also raised on the banks of the river in the same\r\nparish by a few planters. The growers of Perique tobacco have tried\r\nVirginia, Kentucky, and Havana seed, but prefer the former--Havana\r\nproducing too small a plant without a much better flavor.\r\n\r\nTobacco is grown in other parishes of the State; it is however of\r\ninferior quality, and is used only for smoking or snuff. Perique\r\ntobacco, when cut for smoking, is very black in appearance,\r\nexceedingly smooth, and of peculiar odor. It is probably the thinnest\r\ntobacco cultivated; and is strong, but of agreeable flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERUVIAN TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nJohn Gerard gives the following description of the tobacco of Peru:\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco, or henbane of Peru, hath very great stalks of the\r\n     bigness of a child's arme, growing in fertile and\r\n     well-dunged ground of seven or eight feet high, dividing\r\n     itself in sundry branches of great length; whereon are\r\n     placed in most comely order very faire, long leaves, broad,\r\n     smooth and sharp-pointed, soft and of a light green color;\r\n     so fastened about the stalk that they seem to embrace and\r\n     compass it about. The flowers grow at the top of the stalks\r\n     in shape like a bell-flower, somewhat long and cornered;\r\n     hollow within, of a light carnation color, tending to\r\n     whiteness towards the rims. The seed is contained in long,\r\n     sharp-pointed cods, or seed-vessels, like unto the seed of\r\n     yellow henbane, but somewhat smaller, and browner of color.\r\n     The root is great, thicke and of a wooddy substance, with\r\n     some threddy strings annexed thereunto.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMEXICAN TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant seems to have been cultivated in Mexico from time\r\nimmemorial. Francisco Lopez de Gomara, who was chaplain to Cortez,\r\nwhen he made conquest of Mexico, in 1519, alludes to the plant and the\r\ncustom of smoking; and Diaz relates that the king Montezuma had his\r\npipe brought with much ceremony by the chief ladies of his court,\r\nafter he had dined and washed his mouth with scented water. The\r\nSpaniards encouraged its cultivation, and to this day it is grown in\r\nseveral of the coast states. Various kinds are cultivated, but chiefly\r\na variety bearing yellow flowers, with a large leaf of fine flavor\r\nresembling the Havana. The plant is a favorite with the Mexicans, who\r\nprefer it to any other product grown. It is cultivated like most\r\nvarieties of the tropics, and is hardly inferior to any grown in the\r\nWest Indies, and is especially adapted for cigars and cigaritos. After\r\nthe first harvest another, and sometimes a third crop is gathered by\r\nallowing one shoot to grow from the parent root, which oftentimes\r\ndevelops to a considerable size. The quality of leaf, however, is\r\ninferior; as is the case with all second and third crops grown in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. DOMINGO TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nThis well-known West India variety is inferior to most kinds grown on\r\nthe neighboring islands. The plant attains a large size, cures dark,\r\nis coarse, and of inferior flavor. It is a favorite tobacco in\r\nGermany, and thousands of Ceroons are annually shipped to Hamburg. The\r\nWest India islands produce many varieties of tobacco, which is owing\r\nmore to the composition of the soil and climate than to the method of\r\ncultivation and curing.\r\n\r\nThe demand for St. Domingo tobacco is limited. It has no established\r\nreputation in this country, and on account of the high duties can not\r\ncompete with our domestic tobaccos.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATAKIA TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Latakia tobacco, (Syria).]\r\n\r\nThis variety of the tobacco plant is one of the most celebrated known\r\nto commerce. It attains its finest form and flavor in Syria, where it\r\nis cultivated to a considerable extent. For smoking it is among the\r\nbest of the varieties of the East, and is used for the more delicate\r\ncut tobaccos and cigars. It grows to the height of three feet--each\r\noffshoot bearing flowers, the leaves of which are ovate in form, and\r\nare attached to the stalk by a long stem. The flowers are yellow, and\r\nnumber only a few in comparison with most varieties. When growing, the\r\nleaves are thick, but after curing are thin and elastic. The stalk is\r\nsmall, as are also the leaves. While growing, the plants emit a strong\r\naromatic odor not like that of Havana tobacco, but stronger and less\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nThe plant was introduced into this country by Bayard Taylor, and\r\nattains its full size in the Connecticut valley, where it has been\r\ntested by many growers. After curing, the leaf is a bright yellow of\r\nagreeable flavor, having the odor of ashes of roses. The flavor is\r\nsimilar to Turkish tobacco, but is said to be less delicate.\r\n\r\nAfter harvesting, the plants cure rapidly and on account of their\r\nsmall size rarely sweat. Latakia tobacco, however, is not adapted to\r\nthe taste of American smokers, most of whom prefer tobacco of home\r\ngrowth to even the finest of Turkish leaf. Latakia tobacco can be\r\nraised with less labor than most varieties. Its diminutive size and\r\nits unpopularity, however, prevent its general culture in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nIn no other country in Europe is the tobacco plant attracting as much\r\nas attention as in the empire of Russia. The varieties grown in\r\nAmerica, Cuba, Turkey, and Persia, have been tried, renewing the seed\r\nonce in two or three years. The tobacco of Russia is mild, and of\r\ninferior flavor, and brings from 40 to 80 kopecks per pood. A very\r\ngood quality of tobacco is grown in the trans-Caucasian provinces; it\r\nalso flourishes well in the Southern provinces.\r\n\r\nThe plants attain good size, but lack that fine flavor when cured that\r\nother tobaccos possess. A recent traveler through Russia, describing\r\nthe tobacco, says:\r\n\r\n     \"Russian tobacco is very mild and rather sweet flavored,\r\n     though not equal in aroma to the Havana, or posessing that\r\n     rich ripe taste so much prized in that well known tobacco.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOMBIA TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nColombia has long been celebrated for the quality and varieties of its\r\ntobacco. Its cultivation has been carried on for more than two hundred\r\nand fifty years, and Varinian tobacco had obtained a well established\r\nreputation in Europe long before Raleigh's \"would-be-colonists\"\r\nsailed for Virginia. The principal varieties grown are Colombian,\r\nCarmen, Ambalema, Palmyra, and Giron. Most of these tobaccos are used\r\nfor cigar purposes, especially the latter. The leaf is fine, of good\r\nsize, and marked with light yellow spots. Tanning says of the tobacco\r\nof Colombia:\r\n\r\n     \"The Cumanacoa, Tobacco de la Cueva, de los Misones, de la\r\n     Laguna de Valencia cura seca and Caraco, de la Lagunade\r\n     Valencia cura negro, de Oriluca, de Varinos cura seca, de\r\n     Casovare, de Baylodores, de Rio Negro en Andull, are equal\r\n     to the tobacco of the Brazils. The tobacco of the Cueva, in\r\n     the department of Cumana, is said to be grown from the\r\n     excrements of certain birds deposited by them in a cavity,\r\n     from which the natives extract it: it is considered the\r\n     finest tobacco in Colombia. The birds are a species of the\r\n     owl.\r\n\r\n     \"The natives of Varinos, and in fact of the whole kingdom,\r\n     chew a substance called chimo, which is made of a jelly, by\r\n     boiling the Varinos tobacco, and afterwards mixed with an\r\n     alkali called _hurado_, which is found in a lake near\r\n     Merida. Both are an _estanco_ of government, and produce a\r\n     large annual income. The mode of cultivating the above\r\n     tobacco by the natives is as follows:--They prepare a small\r\n     bed, sifting the earth very fine, on which they sow the\r\n     seed, and then cover it with plantain leaves for some days.\r\n     As soon as the plants make their appearance, they raise the\r\n     leaves about two feet, so as to give the plants free air,\r\n     and to allow them sooner to grow strong. When they become\r\n     large enough to transplant, they have the land prepared; and\r\n     as soon as the rainy season sets in, they plant out their\r\n     young plants, taking great care to protect them from the\r\n     sun, and to keep them clean as they grow up, as well as to\r\n     prevent the worms from destroying or eating the leaves. When\r\n     the leaf is ripe, it gets yellow spots on it; and on bending\r\n     the leaf it cracks. Then it is fit for pulling off, which is\r\n     done, and the leaves are neatly packed in handsful, placed\r\n     in a dry situation, and occasionally shifted from one place\r\n     to another. When the leaves are well dried they are all\r\n     packed closely, and well covered, to keep the flavor in.\r\n\r\n     \"The leaf is left in this state for one or two months, and\r\n     then made up for use. They never top their tobacco, and the\r\n     leaves never ripen together. The mode adopted by the North\r\n     American planters is somewhat different; they top their\r\n     plants when they have eight full leaves, or they keep it\r\n     suckered; and, by this means, the leaves are large and\r\n     sappy.\r\n\r\n     \"They cut off the stem at the ground, when ripe, and hang it\r\n     on laths for one day and a night, with the leaves all\r\n     hanging down; they then place it in their barns; and, when\r\n     these are quite full, they smoke it for some days, and let\r\n     it remain in that way until the stem, as well as the leaf,\r\n     is quite dry; they then put it in a heap, and cover it up\r\n     for market. They strip off the leaves, and pack them in\r\n     hogsheads, and it is received in London.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMATRA TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nSumatra tobacco is one of the finest varieties cultivated, and\r\ncommands in European markets the very highest prices. The plant is a\r\nvigorous grower, and produces large, fine leaves of most delicate\r\nodor. The leaf is of beautiful appearance, of almost a silky texture,\r\nand in color a rich brown. It is extensively used in the manufacture\r\nof cigars, and on the continent it frequently realizes as much as 5s.\r\nper pound for this purpose. It sells in London for from 3s. 6d. to 4s.\r\nper pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAZILIAN TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nBrazil tobacco is grown chiefly in the valley of San Diego and San\r\nFrancisco. The former being on the west side of the Brazilian\r\nmountains, and the latter on the east. The San Diego is the finest,\r\nand the following analysis of the San Diego of Brazil, and Vuelta de\r\nAbajo, will give one an idea of the soil of these famous tobacco\r\nlands:--\r\n\r\n                           VUELTA DE ABAJO, CUBA.

The planter raises two crops a year; curing for\r\nexportation as in Cuba or Venezuela. The plant grows to the height of\r\nabout six feet, bearing leaves lanceolate in form, about thirty inches\r\nlong, and from eight to twelve inches wide. The tobacco fields are\r\nvery irregular. After it is cut it is placed on poles in the field,\r\nand afterwards carried to the drying sheds. It is gathered in the dry\r\nseason in September. After curing, it is removed to the packing house\r\nand baled in packages, and then transported on mules to the coast for\r\nshipping. A large portion of the crop is shipped to Portugal. It is a\r\ndark maroon-colored leaf, and contains a large proportion of the\r\nnicotine oil. It is a high-flavored tobacco, and on this account is\r\nused for cigars and cutting.\r\n\r\nBurton says of the tobacco of Brazil:\r\n\r\n     \"The tobacco of the Rio de Pomba, especially the 'Fumo\r\n     crespo,' is a dark strong leaf, well fitted for making\r\n     'Cavendish' or 'Honey-dew;' the weed flourishes throughout\r\n     Minos Gerals. The soil will be much improved by compost; and\r\n     the produce by being treated in Virginia style delicately\r\n     dried in closed barns with fires.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVENEZUELAN TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Orinoco tobacco, (Venezuela)]\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco tobacco grows from four to five feet high, bearing large\r\novate leaves, and is in all respects a fine quality of tobacco. The\r\nplant is grown during all seasons of the year. It is used chiefly for\r\ncigars, and is shipped to Northern Europe. It is packed in\r\n_carrottes_, and then baled. In color it is dark mahogany, and of good\r\nbody and texture. The leaf is about eighteen inches long, and about\r\nten inches wide. The planters cure by air-drying in sheds, and\r\nafterwards it is tied up in hands and baled for export. For their own\r\nuse, they have adopted the method of the Brazilians, sprinkling the\r\nleaf with water containing the juice of the poppy.\r\n\r\nThe flavor is rich and mellow; a little more oily than Havana leaf. It\r\nis used for the manufacture of cigars. Orinoco tobacco makes very fine\r\nflavored cigars, burning freely, and leaving a pearl-colored ash; it\r\nis considered by the Venezuelans to be much better than any variety\r\ngrown in South America. In cultivating it the planters use no\r\nfertilizers whatever, taking up new land as the old wears out. The\r\ncrop is gathered first in May, and then in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSIAN TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shiraz tobacco, Persia.]\r\n\r\nShiraz tobacco is a native of Persia, and is one of the finest\r\nvarieties for the pipe to be found in the East. The plant differs from\r\nmost varieties in the color of the flowers and the form of the leaves.\r\nIt is not adapted for cigars as it does not readily ignite, and this\r\nvariety together with Manilla, are known as non-burning tobaccos.\r\nAfter curing, the color is a light yellow, the flavor mild and not\r\nunlike Latakia and Turkish tobacco. The color of the flowers like\r\nthose of Guatemala tobacco, is white, but in other respects nearly\r\nsimilar to other kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERSFOORT TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nThis variety of tobacco is cultivated quite extensively in Holland, in\r\nthe Veluwe (valley of Guelderland). The plant is of good size and\r\naverages 1.580 kilos to the hectare. The cultivation is very carefully\r\nconducted on the richest soil. The leaf is very fine and is free from\r\nlarge fibres, fitting it for cigars. Large quantities are also used in\r\nthe manufacture of snuff. The tobacco plant has been cultivated in\r\nHolland since its first introduction, with complete success,\r\nproducing a variety for snuff unrivaled by any other tobacco grown in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIn color Dutch tobacco is both dark and light; the former being used\r\nfor snuff and the latter for cigars and cheroots.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. OMER TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nTobacco is an important product in France, and affords the government\r\nan immense revenue. In the north of France two varieties are\r\ncultivated, the Brazilian and the Mexican, but the tobacco is unlike\r\nthat grown in those countries. Most of the tobacco of France is small\r\nand inferior to Havana and Manilla. In the South of France tobacco is\r\ncultivated to a considerable extent, but is of inferior quality,\r\nlacking the rich flavor of the tobacco of Cuba. The cultivation is\r\npermitted only in certain departments, and the cultivators must use\r\nonly the seed supplied to them by the officers of the _regie_. This is\r\nselected with the greatest care, the kind and quantity depending upon\r\nthe nature of the land, the soil being carefully analyzed, and\r\ncultivation prohibited in soils which do not possess the constituents\r\nnecessary for the growth of good tobacco. These analyses also\r\ndetermine the quantities and sorts of manure required to bring the\r\nland into fit condition. Most of the seed used is the produce of seed\r\nimported at various times from North America and Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation is most carefully watched, and the statistics\r\navailable concerning it are of the minutest kind. Not only is the area\r\nof each field of tobacco accurately measured, but each plant is noted\r\ndown, and even each leaf on each plant is accounted for. St. Omer is\r\nused chiefly for snuff, sometimes used with other kinds and is much\r\nesteemed by the French who consider it among the best of tobaccos.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNGARIAN TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nThis variety is attracting considerable attention, from the fact that\r\nit is well adapted for the manufacture of cigars. Like Connecticut\r\nseed leaf, the leaves are large and well suited for cigar wrappers. A\r\nconsiderable portion is adapted for other uses, and it is in some\r\nrespects a good cutting tobacco. When in fine condition, Hungarian\r\nleaf burns freely and leaves a clean, light-colored ash. No variety of\r\ntobacco grown in Europe is attracting more notice than this, and if\r\ngood leaf tobacco suitable for cigars can be grown, American tobacco\r\nwill diminish in proportion. Hungarian tobacco is a favorite with the\r\nItalians, and large quantities are sold to the Italian monopoly to be\r\nused both for cigars and cutting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spanish tobacco.]\r\n\r\nFor several years the growers of tobacco in the Connecticut valley\r\nhave directed their attention towards the production of a tobacco\r\npossessing all of the excellencies of both wrapper and filler; in\r\nother words, if possible securing a leaf of light color and fine\r\ntexture and good flavor, so as to combine all of the desirable\r\nfeatures and qualities of tobacco in one variety. Some few years since\r\nthe Department of Agriculture at Washington distributed a variety of\r\ntobacco seed among the Connecticut tobacco growers known by the name\r\nof Spanish tobacco.\r\n\r\nIt has been tested by many of the largest tobacco growers in\r\nConnecticut, and found to be one of the best varieties of the plant\r\never cultivated in the valley. The plant grows to the height of eight\r\nfeet, bearing leaves about two feet in length by one foot in width, is\r\nan erect, strong, growing tobacco with a small, hard stalk and stout,\r\nlong roots. The plant, when growing, imparts a strong aromatic odor\r\nnot unlike Havana tobacco, but is larger everyway, and of inferior\r\nflavor for cigars. By repeated trials its superiority has been\r\ndemonstrated to a certainty, while the profit arising from its culture\r\nproves it worthy of attention from all cultivators of tobacco.\r\n\r\nWhen cured the leaf is very fine and light of color, the stem and\r\nveins of the leaf are small, thus fitting it for a good wrapper as\r\nwell as filler. If the tobacco growers in the Connecticut valley can\r\nsucceed in raising this variety, they will produce a leaf tobacco much\r\nsuperior to the common variety known as seed leaf. Beyond all question\r\na much finer flavored tobacco than Connecticut seed leaf can be grown,\r\nand still retain all of the excellencies of the latter, such as color,\r\ntexture, and size of leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKISH TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco of Turkey has been called by some enthusiastic smoker \"the\r\nking of tobaccos,\" but whether it possesses this royal preëminence\r\nover all other varieties must be decided by other than ourselves. That\r\nit is a fine smoking tobacco, no one can doubt that ever \"put breath\"\r\nto the favored pipe that contains the yellow shreds, but we should\r\nprefer by far to part with it rather than with its great rival, Havana\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nThe plant is not as large as many varieties, but grows up strong and\r\nflourishes well on account of the care and attention given it by the\r\nTurk and his family, as it is in all respects a family plant, and the\r\nflower garden is generally the tobacco field. Turkey tobacco ranges in\r\ncolor from brown to light yellow, the latter being the most in demand.\r\nThis variety is similar in flavor to Latakia and Shiraz, and these\r\nthree tobaccos, Persian, Syrian, and Turkish, are considered the\r\nfinest and best adapted of all tobaccos for the pipe. The work of\r\ncultivating a field of Turkish tobacco is very tedious, as large\r\nquantities of water have to be carried to sprinkle upon the plants.\r\nThe finest colored, a pale yellow leaf, brings \"inflated\" prices, but\r\nmore often by others than the poor Turk who grows it.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPAN TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Japan tobacco.]\r\n\r\nOf the tobacco of Asia, the best known in Europe is the yellow leaf\r\ngrown in Japan. In those provinces where a high degree of temperature\r\nprevails, the plant lives throughout the winter, but it is\r\nnevertheless customary to sow fresh seed in the early spring of each\r\nsuccessive year. When fully grown, Japan tobacco attains an altitude\r\nof about six feet, bearing leaves long and pointed, completely\r\nenveloping the stalk. The leaves, however, differ in form in different\r\nprovinces, some being round and wide, others narrow and pointed, and\r\nothers thick and long.\r\n\r\nThe mode of cultivating also varies in the different provinces. The\r\nsowing and transplanting are dependent on the temperature of the\r\nlocality, and each place follows its own customs. In autumn a great\r\nnumber of flowers spring from the tip of the stalk. These are about an\r\ninch in length, and of a pale purple tint. To these succeed small\r\nround capsules, inside of which are three small chambers containing a\r\ngreat number of light red seeds. The method of cultivation is novel,\r\nthe manuring of tobacco differing from that of other plants in that it\r\nis plentifully applied both to the roots and leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUATEMALA TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco of Central America, though possessing considerable\r\nexcellence, has never become an important product, nor to any great\r\nextent an article of commerce. There are several varieties grown in\r\nGuatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the other Central American states;\r\nsome of which by proper cultivation might be valuable to both the user\r\nand the manufacturer. One variety bears white flowers like the tobacco\r\nof Persia, but in other respects it differs but little from South\r\nAmerican varieties. Numerous other sorts occur, many of which are\r\nlocal, and differ principally, if not solely, in the size or form of\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\nThe soil of Guatemala is well adapted for tobacco, and with careful\r\ncultivation it could hardly fail of becoming an important agricultural\r\nproduct. It is also probable that the soil of nearly all of Central\r\nAmerica is adapted to the plant, and with the favorable climate, the\r\nvarieties now grown would doubtless with proper care, become noted as\r\ntobacco well adapted for cigars.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANILLA TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nThis variety is one of the most celebrated grown in the East.[69] It\r\nis used exclusively for the manufacture of cigars and cheroots, and\r\nsupplies India and Spain with a vast quantity of the manufactured\r\narticle. The plant is a strong, vigorous grower, bearing dark green\r\nleaves; coming forward rapidly under the careful culture bestowed upon\r\nthe plants.[70] After curing, the leaves show a variety of colors\r\nranging from dark brown to light yellow or straw color. The leaf when\r\ncured, has a peculiar appearance unlike that of any other tobacco. It\r\nis of good body but smooth, and has the appearance of tobacco that has\r\nbeen 'frost-bitten.' The leaf is not as porous as most other tobaccos,\r\nand therefore does not as readily ignite, and frequently 'chars' in\r\nburning--thus giving it the name of a non-burning tobacco.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 69: Blanco thus describes the tobacco of the\r\n              Philippines: \"It is an annual, growing to the height of\r\n              a fathom, and furnishes the tobacco for the _estancos_\r\n              (licensed shops). General opinion prefers the tobacco of\r\n              Gapan, but that of the Pasy districts, Laglag and\r\n              Lambunao, in Iloilo, of Maasin or Leyte, is appreciated\r\n              for its fine aroma; also that of Cagayan, after being\r\n              kept for some years,--for this use like the tobacco of\r\n              the island of Negros it burns the mouth.\"]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 70: The seedlings are planted in January, and\r\n              the greater part of the crop comes forward in May and\r\n              June.]\r\n\r\nThe plants are 'set' wide apart, and during the first two months are\r\ncarefully cultivated, when the top is broken off and the leaves\r\nallowed to ripen. In some respects, Manilla tobacco is one of the best\r\nvarieties of the plant cultivated, and were it not for its non-burning\r\nquality, it would have but few rivals among cigar tobaccos.[71] We\r\nhave thus, at some length, described nearly half of the varieties of\r\ntobacco now being cultivated. There are, however, others as well known\r\nand of equal value and favor. Some of these are of superior quality\r\nand of world-wide repute. Of those described, the varieties grown in\r\nthe tropics are the most celebrated and of the finest flavor. As when\r\nfirst discovered, the tobaccos of the tropics command the highest\r\nprices, and possess qualities not easily transmitted when grown in a\r\ntemperate clime.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 71: \"The soil of many of the islands\r\n              especially of the Bisayas is favorable to the growth of\r\n              tobacco. The island of Negros formerly produced some of\r\n              very good quality.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drying houses or sheds for the curing and storing of tobacco are\r\namong the most interesting objects to be seen on the tobacco\r\nplantation. These sheds vary in size from a small structure capable of\r\nholding only a few thousand plants to the immense sheds with\r\nsufficient capacity for hanging the products of several acres. In the\r\nConnecticut valley, the Southern States, at the West, and in the\r\nPhilippine Islands these tobacco sheds are often several hundred feet\r\nin length, built in the most substantial manner and provided with\r\nsuitable side doors and ventilators for the free passage of air, and\r\nthe most perfect system of ventilation. The most substantial and\r\nfinest tobacco sheds are to be found in the Connecticut valley, which\r\nare provided with every convenience for hanging and taking down or\r\n\"striking\" the crop. Many of them are painted and adorned with a\r\ncupola, which serves the double purpose of an ornament and a\r\nventilator for the hot air to pass off from the curing and heated\r\nplants. Formerly, the tobacco being harvested was hung in barns and\r\nsheds, used for storing grain and hay, and better adapted to other\r\npurposes than to that of a tobacco shed, where thorough ventilation is\r\nnecessary to avoid sweat and pole-rot, attending upon the curing of\r\nthe plants. Of late, tobacco growers, throughout the world, have paid\r\nconsiderable attention to the method of curing, and to erecting more\r\nsuitable buildings for the purpose. At the South and West, the log\r\ntobacco barns are giving way to the more substantial frame buildings,\r\nand better facilities are employed for \"firing\" the tobacco in the\r\nsheds. Formerly, the tobacco sheds at the South looked more like the\r\nrude huts of the herders on the pampas of South America, than\r\nbuildings devoted to the curing of tobacco. Tobacco barns and sheds\r\nare built of a great variety of material, and in various ways,\r\naccording to the manner of building where the tobacco is grown. Thus\r\nin the Connecticut valley, such sheds or barns are large and\r\ncommodious frame buildings; at the South and West, many of them are\r\nbuilt of logs; in Cuba, of slabs covered with palm leaves or thatched.\r\nIn Turkey, of stones covered with rough boards, and daubed with mud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Connecticut tobacco shed.]\r\n\r\nIn selecting a site for the tobacco shed, not only should its\r\nproximity to the tobacco field be considered, but also the ground on\r\nwhich it is to be built. It should always be erected on dry ground,\r\nrather than upon moist, so that no dampness may arise and injure the\r\nleaves in curing. The tobacco shed should also be built on an elevated\r\nspot, so that a free circulation of air may be had, which is hardly\r\npossible if built on low ground or among trees or in the woods as at\r\nthe South. This applies more particularly to sheds where the method\r\nof curing is by air-drying instead of by \"firing\" or by \"flues.\" In\r\nNew England the strongest timber, as oak, is used for building, as the\r\nweight of the plants before fully cured is immense. The shed is braced\r\nat every point and generally rests upon stone posts so as to allow a\r\ngood circulation underneath the building. Poles are used for hanging,\r\neither round or sawed, when the plants are hung with twine; when hung\r\non tobacco hooks, laths are used, the hooks attached to the lath; more\r\nfrequently the plants are strung upon the laths without the aid of\r\nhooks, the lath passing through the center of the stalk an inch or two\r\nfrom the end. The doors lengthwise of the building are simply the\r\noutside boards hung on hinges, every second or third being chosen\r\naccording to the ideas of curing entertained by the grower. Some\r\nplanters are of the opinion that the plants need all the air that can\r\nbe obtained, and keep the sheds open during both day and night, while\r\nothers open the doors only now and then--closing during warm days, and\r\nduring a storm. Sometimes the doors are hung on hinges at the\r\ntop--opening but partially and not allowing as free circulation as\r\nwhen hung on the sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern Connecticut tobacco shed.]\r\n\r\nAnother building of late has been built by the growers in the\r\nConnecticut valley, called a stripping house. This building is\r\nfrequently attached to the shed or near by so that stripping may be\r\nperformed during all kinds of weather, without danger of injuring the\r\ntobacco, or the health of the stripper. Such buildings however are\r\nneeded only in tobacco sections where the cold is extreme during the\r\nwinter, when most of the tobacco is to be stripped. The stripping room\r\nor house is provided with a stove, a long table, or elevated platform,\r\nin front of the windows, of which there should be several to admit\r\nplenty of light, and a number of chairs to accommodate the strippers.\r\nOn the stove a kettle of water is kept constantly boiling or heated,\r\nthe ascending steam of which keeps the leaves of tobacco from drying\r\nand consequently from cracking or breaking. When in condition for\r\n\"striking\" or taking down, the plants are carried to the\r\nstripping-room, and covered with boards and blankets, when the\r\noperation called stripping commences. Many of the stripping-rooms are\r\nbuilt large enough to contain the cases after the tobacco is packed,\r\nthus answering a double purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stripping room.]\r\n\r\nIn Virginia and the other tobacco-growing states of the South, the\r\ntobacco barn is built altogether different, as the method of curing is\r\nby fires or flues instead of air curing. The height of the building is\r\nusually twice its width and length. In the center of the smooth\r\nearthen floor, is the trench for \"firing,\" while around the sides of\r\nthe building runs an elevated platform for placing the tobacco leaves\r\nin bulk; and, commencing at a safe distance from the trench, up to the\r\ntop of the building, reach beams stretching across for the reception\r\nof the pine laths, from which are suspended the tobacco plants. Many\r\nof the tobacco sheds at the South, are built like those of New\r\nEngland, but many log structures are still to be seen and many\r\nplanters prefer them to those made like other frame buildings. The old\r\nVirginia planters of a hundred years ago, built rough log sheds for\r\nhousing the plants, which afforded little protection from wind and\r\nrain, which, in consequence, injured much of the tobacco hanging\r\naround the sides of the building. Tatham gives the following\r\ndescription of the \"Tobacco house and its variety\" in his work on\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern Virginia shed.]\r\n\r\n     \"The barn which is appropriated to the use of receiving and\r\n     curing this crop, is not, in the manner of other barns,\r\n     connected with the farm yard, so that the whole occupation\r\n     may be rendered snug and compact, and occasion little waste\r\n     of time by inconsiderate and useless locomotion; but it is\r\n     constructed to suit the particular occasion in point of\r\n     size, and is generally erected in, or by the side of, each\r\n     respective piece of tobacco ground; or sometimes in the\r\n     woods, upon some hill or particular site which may be\r\n     convenient to more than one field of tobacco. The sizes\r\n     which are most generally built where this kind of culture\r\n     prevails, are what are called forty-feet, and sixty-feet\r\n     tobacco houses; that is, of these lengths respectively, and\r\n     of a proportionate width; and the plate of the wall, or part\r\n     which supports the eaves of the roof, is generally elevated\r\n     from the groundsel about the pitch of twelve feet. About\r\n     twelve feet pitch is indeed a good height for the larger\r\n     crops; because this will allow four pitch each to three\r\n     successive tiers of tobacco, besides those which are hung in\r\n     the roof; and this distance admits a free circulation of\r\n     air, and is a good space apart for the process of curing the\r\n     plant. There are various methods in use in respect to the\r\n     construction of tobacco houses, and various materials of\r\n     which they are constructed; but such are generally found\r\n     upon the premises as suffice for the occasion. And although\r\n     these sizes are most prevalent, yet tobacco houses are in\r\n     many instances built larger or smaller according to the\r\n     circumstances of the proprietor, or the size of the spot of\r\n     ground under cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Virginia shed 150 years ago.]\r\n\r\n     \"The most ordinary kinds consist of two square pens built\r\n     out of logs of six or eight inches thick, and from sixteen\r\n     to twenty feet long. Out of this material the two pens are\r\n     formed by notching the logs near their extremities with an\r\n     axe; so that they are alternately fitted one upon another,\r\n     until they rise to a competent height; taking care to fit\r\n     joists in at the respective tiers of four feet space, so\r\n     that scaffolds may be formed by them similar to those\r\n     heretofore described to have been erected in the open field,\r\n     for the purpose of hanging the sticks of tobacco upon, that\r\n     they may be open to a free circulation of air during this\r\n     stage of the process. These pens are placed on a line with\r\n     each other, at the opposite extremes of an oblong square,\r\n     formed of such a length as to admit of a space between the\r\n     two pens wide enough for the reception of a cart or wagon.\r\n     This space, together with the two pens, is covered over with\r\n     one and the same roof, the frame of which is formed in the\r\n     same way as the walls by notching the logs aforesaid, and\r\n     narrowing up the gable ends to a point at the upper\r\n     extremity of the house, termed the ridge pole. The remaining\r\n     part of the fabric consists of a rough cover of thin slabs\r\n     of wood, split first with a mall and wedges, and afterwards\r\n     riven with an instrument or tool termed a froe. The only\r\n     thing which then remains to be done, is to cut a door into\r\n     each of the pens, which is done by putting blocks or wedges\r\n     in betwixt the logs which are to be cut out, and securing\r\n     the jambs with side pieces pinned on with an anger and\r\n     wooden pins. The roof is secured by weighing it down with\r\n     logs; so that neither hammer, nails, brick, or stone, is\r\n     concerned in the structure; and locks and keys are very\r\n     rarely deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n     \"The second kind of tobacco houses differ somewhat from\r\n     these, with a view to longer duration. The logs are to this\r\n     end more choicely selected. The foundation consists of four\r\n     well hewn groundsels, of about eight by ten inches, leveled\r\n     and laid upon cross sawed blocks of a larger tree, or upon\r\n     large stones. The corners are truly measured, and squared\r\n     diamond-wise, by which means they are more nicely notched in\r\n     upon each other; the roof is fitted with rafters, footed\r\n     upon wall plates, and covered with clap-boards nailed upon\r\n     the rafters in the manner of slating. In all other respects\r\n     this is the same with the last mentioned method; and both\r\n     are left open for the passage of the air between the logs.\r\n\r\n     \"The third kind is laid upon a foundation similar to the\r\n     second; but instead of logs, the walls are composed of posts\r\n     and studs, tenoned into the sells, and braced; the top of\r\n     these are mounted with a wall-plate and joists; upon these\r\n     come the rafters; and the whole is covered with clap-boards\r\n     and nails, so as to form one uninterrupted oblong square,\r\n     with doors, etc., termed, as heretofore, a forty, sixty, or\r\n     one hundred feet tobacco house, etc.\r\n\r\n     \"The fourth species of these differs from the third only in\r\n     the covering, which is generally of good sawed feather-edged\r\n     plank; in the roof, which is now composed of shingles; and\r\n     in the doors and finishing, which consist of good sawed\r\n     plank, hinged, &c. Sometimes this kind are underpinned with\r\n     a brick or stone wall beneath the groundsels; but they have\r\n     no floors or windows, except a plank or two along the sides\r\n     to raise upon hinges for sake of air, and occasional light:\r\n     indeed, if these were constructed with sides similar to the\r\n     brewery tops in London, I think it would be found\r\n     advantageous. In respect to the inside framing of a tobacco\r\n     house, one description may serve for every kind: they are so\r\n     contrived as to admit poles in the nature of a scaffold\r\n     through every part of them, ranging four feet from centre to\r\n     centre, which is the length of the tobacco stick, as\r\n     heretofore described; and the lower ties should be so\r\n     contrived as to remove away occasionally, in order to pursue\r\n     other employments at different stages in the process of\r\n     curing the crop.\"\r\n\r\nIn Ohio, the tobacco barns are built in a manner similar to those in\r\nVirginia; constructed of logs and provided with trenches for fires in\r\ncuring the tobacco. The tobacco sheds for hanging the tobacco cured by\r\nair-drying, are built of the same material without trenches, as smoke\r\nis not employed in curing \"seed-leaf\" tobacco. The sheds for both\r\nkinds of curing tobacco are large structures, varying in size\r\naccording to the area of tobacco planted. Sometimes the sheds are\r\nbuilt near the woods where fuel can be procured, and in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the tobacco field. The tobacco houses are built in the\r\nstrongest manner and of the most durable material, and are well fitted\r\nfor the purpose designed. In the counties bordering the Ohio River,\r\nwhere a large quantity of tobacco is raised, the tobacco sheds are to\r\nbe seen on every hand, the smoke issuing from the sides of the\r\nbuilding, giving a stranger the idea of a burning building rather than\r\nthe curing of a great staple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ohio tobacco shed.]\r\n\r\nThe following account of constructing tobacco barns in Missouri, is\r\nfrom a St. Louis paper:\r\n\r\n     \"We believe in small barns for any kind of curing. A house\r\n     built 16 feet inside and divided into four rooms and six\r\n     tier high in the body is the preferable size for flue or\r\n     coal curing. For flues they should be built on a very\r\n     slightly sloping place; just enough to make the flues draw\r\n     well. Flues four inches lower at the eye than the chimney\r\n     will be slope enough. The door should always be between the\r\n     flues and in the end of the house, to prevent the drip from\r\n     falling before the door and the eye of the flues. The tiers\r\n     should begin eight feet above the ground and be placed two\r\n     feet above each other to the top. They should be placed\r\n     across the house so that the roof tier can conveniently be\r\n     placed above them. The door, three feet wide and six feet\r\n     high, furnished with a good, close shutter. A barn of this\r\n     size will cure 800 sticks of common size tobacco, which\r\n     will weigh about 1200 lbs. The proper construction of flues\r\n     is of great importance; they should be built of any stone\r\n     that will stand fire without bursting. White sand-stone,\r\n     bastard soap-stone, or any other that does not contain\r\n     flint. The size of a flue for a sixteen foot barn, is\r\n     generally about 12 inches wide by 14 inches high inside. Not\r\n     much care need be taken to have them smooth on the outside.\r\n     If stone can be had to make the inside smooth so as not to\r\n     obstruct the putting on of wood, it is all that is\r\n     necessary. They should be run just far enough from the\r\n     house-side not to set the house on fire, and there is not as\r\n     much danger of this as may be supposed. Run the walls of the\r\n     house-side all around, running the stem out at the middle of\r\n     the upper side. The stem should be run far enough above the\r\n     wall of the house to avoid danger of sparks from the\r\n     chimney. The height of the inside of the flue should be\r\n     preserved its whole length. The width may be slightly\r\n     decreased from the elbow to the chimney. The inner wall is\r\n     carried all around. But too much explanation bewilders; we\r\n     think we have said enough. As before said, we like small\r\n     barns; where too much tobacco is together, it all can not\r\n     receive the heat alike, which is our main objection to large\r\n     barns. As to the number of barns necessary, we would say\r\n     that there ought to be enough to receive all the crop\r\n     without moving any. Say one sixteen-foot barn to every 8,000\r\n     hills of tobacco planted. As a general rule, plant one\r\n     thousand hills for every hundred sticks house-room. That is,\r\n     if you have three barns plant 24,000 hills, and if it is\r\n     common tobacco, they will receive it. A much larger quantity\r\n     may be saved in this number of barns by curing and moving\r\n     out, but it is very troublesome.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Persian tobacco shed.]\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky and Tennessee the tobacco barns resemble those of Ohio and\r\nthe other Western states, and are large, commodious structures,\r\nprovided with every facility for curing the plants. In other\r\ntobacco-growing countries the tobacco barns and sheds differ but\r\nlittle from those in America, the only difference being in form and\r\nbuilding material. In countries where tobacco is a government\r\nmonopoly, large and comfortable buildings are provided for the crop\r\nwith all the necessary accessories for the curing, packing, and\r\nstoring of the tobacco. In South America many of the sheds are large\r\nand low, built on the plantation, and close to the tobacco field. In\r\nCuba, the curing houses are located on the _vegas_, and as soon as the\r\ntobacco is cut it is placed on the poles to dry or cure. In Asia, a\r\nlarge quantity of the tobacco is cured in the peasants' huts, where\r\nthe smoke is said to impart additional flavor to the already fragrant\r\nleaves. In the Philippines the largest tobacco sheds are found,\r\ndescribed by Gironiere as \"vast sheds,\" and of sufficient capacity to\r\nhold acres of the leaves. In Persia, where the celebrated Shiraz\r\ntobacco is grown, the sheds are simply covered buildings without any\r\nboards on the sides, the only protection afforded from the weather\r\nbeing supplied by light, thorny bushes, so that the plants may be\r\nexposed to the wind. After fully curing, the tobacco is removed to\r\nanother drying-house and turned every day. The drying-houses in other\r\ntobacco-growing countries differ but little from those described,\r\nwhile the manner of curing is similar, the plants being \"fired,\"\r\nsun-cured, or air-dried--the three modes now employed in drying the\r\nleaves. If the tobacco of the tropics is fragrant while growing, it is\r\ndoubly so after being harvested and carried to the sheds. The odor\r\nfrom the well-filled barns is borne on the breeze alike to friend and\r\nfoe of the plant. As the process of drying goes on, the plants\r\ngradually lose the strong perfume emitted during the earlier stages of\r\ncuring, and by the time the leaves are \"cured down\" and the sheds\r\nclosed, but little odor issues from the plants, and this continues to\r\nbe the case until the leaves are entirely dried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTobacco at the present time is one of the great products of the world.\r\nAs an article of agriculture and of commerce, it holds an important\r\nplace among the great staples, while as a luxury, its use has become\r\nas extensive as its culture. The tobacco plant is now cultivated in\r\nnearly all parts of the world with varying success, according to the\r\nsystem of cultivation adopted by its growers. Primarily cultivated by\r\nthe aborigines of America in the rude manner common to uncivilized\r\nraces, the plant has, by numerous experiments and careful culture,\r\nbecome one of the greatest of agricultural products. When first\r\ndiscovered by the Spanish and Portuguese, the plant was small, and in\r\nflavor \"poor and weak and of a byting taste.\" As soon, however, as the\r\nSpaniards began its cultivation in the islands of St. Domingo and\r\nTrinidad, attention was paid to developing it, and in a few years the\r\ndescription we find of the latter variety is that it is \"large, sharp,\r\nand growing two or three yards from the ground.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the sixteenth century the Portuguese began its\r\ncultivation in Portugal, the soil of which seemed well adapted to the\r\nplant, and still further increased the size and quality of the leaf.\r\nTobacco is now cultivated through a wider range of temperature than\r\nany other tropical plant, and whether grown amid the sands of Arabia,\r\nthe plains of South America, or in the rich valley of the Connecticut,\r\ndevelops its finest form and perfection of leaf. During the last\r\nhalf-century the plant has been developed to a greater extent than\r\nduring the three hundred years succeeding its discovery. Now its\r\ncultivation has been reduced to almost an exact science, and the\r\nquality of the leaf is in a great measure within the control of the\r\ngrowers of the plant.\r\n\r\nFormerly it was supposed that the varieties that grew in the tropics\r\ncould not be successfully cultivated in the temperate regions, but\r\nrecent and repeated experiments have demonstrated the fact that the\r\ntobacco of Cuba can be grown with success in the Connecticut valley.\r\nWhile the tobacco of the tropics is the finest in flavor, the more\r\ntemperate regions produce the finest and best colored leaf. The\r\ntobacco of the tropics, as to the uses to which it is put, is limited,\r\nwhile the tobacco of the more temperate regions can be used for all\r\nthe purposes for which the plant is designed.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the plant varies with the variety, the soil, and\r\nthe use to be made of the leaf. Thus a tobacco designed for cutting\r\npurposes is cultivated somewhat differently from that designed for the\r\nmanufacture of snuff or cigars. In the one case the plant is allowed\r\nto remain growing longer in the field, while in the other the work of\r\ntopping the plants is performed at an earlier stage of their growth.\r\nPrimarily but little attention was paid to the color and texture of\r\nthe leaf, the principal object being the production of a leaf of large\r\nsize, rather than one of good color, and of a silky texture. Now,\r\nhowever, these are most important considerations, and give value to\r\nthe tobacco in proportion to the perfection of these qualities.\r\n\r\nThe soil, too, is carefully chosen and fitted in the most thorough\r\nmanner, while the fertilizers used are selected with reference to the\r\ncolor of leaf desired. When first cultivated in the United States it\r\nwas thought that tobacco designed for various uses could not be grown\r\nin the same state or section; now, however, tobacco for cigars and for\r\ncutting are grown nearly side by side. But in the fineness of the\r\nleaf, tobacco culture has made its greatest stride. By a careful\r\nselection of soil, and by the judicious application of proper\r\nfertilizers, the leaf tobaccos of Connecticut, Cuba, and Virginia,\r\nresemble in texture the finest satins and silks. This result has been\r\nreached, not by the sacrifice of the strength of the leaf, but by the\r\nmost careful culture and improved methods of curing.\r\n\r\nThe first labor to be performed in connection with the growth of a\r\ncrop of tobacco, is the selection of a site for, and the making of,\r\nthe \"plant bed\" or \"plant patch.\" These beds for the early growth of\r\nthe plants until large enough to transplant, are made in various ways\r\nand at different times, according to the method of tilling adopted and\r\nthe climate. In California the tobacco bed is made in January, in the\r\nSouthern States, Syria, Turkey, and Holland, in March. In New England\r\nin April. In Mexico and Java in June, and in Persia in December. In\r\nthe Connecticut valley the manner of making the\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT BED,\r\n\r\nas given by a Massachusetts tobacco-grower, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"No rigid rules can be given for any process in tobacco\r\n     culture, which depends much upon weather and season, but\r\n     certain advantages may be obtained by skillful adaptation of\r\n     general principles to circumstances. This is especially true\r\n     of raising tobacco plants, which occupy an extremely slight\r\n     depth of ground for weeks after sowing, making it necessary\r\n     to prepare the whole soil with reference to the state of\r\n     this thin surface. Any slight mistake of treatment may make\r\n     in the end a difference of several days; consequently each\r\n     item is of importance. While every tobacco-raiser wants\r\n     early plants, and appreciates the value of a good location\r\n     for growing them, many naturally sheltered spots of ground,\r\n     protected from northerly winds by buildings, trees, or\r\n     hills, remain unappreciated. Tight board fences are no\r\n     protection worth mentioning.\r\n\r\n     \"A heavily manured crop of tobacco would fit such places for\r\n     tobacco beds, and leave them freer from weeds than any other\r\n     cultivation; and a subsequent use of some commercial\r\n     fertilizer would avoid the introduction of weed seed. With\r\n     these precautions, and a careful destruction of all\r\n     neighboring weeds, a tolerably clean bed may be expected. To\r\n     prepare the ground, plow or loosen deeply with a large\r\n     cultivator; harrow in two-thirds of the fertilizer to be\r\n     used; rake the bed perfectly level, then rake in the other\r\n     third; roll once, and another slight raking will fit the bed\r\n     for sowing, after which it should be rolled down hard. If\r\n     the soil is handled in drying weather, it should be done\r\n     quickly, because damp ground, if prepared and rolled down\r\n     before drying, will 'set' like mortar, and remain damp on\r\n     the surface. Moisture and darkness are essential to the\r\n     germination of the seed, and these conditions can be secured\r\n     only by making the surface compact while damp. The\r\n     disintegration of the deeper lumps, and the decomposition of\r\n     fertilizers, will cause the surface to grow gradually\r\n     softer. The effect of plowing is to break the ground into\r\n     lumps, which lie upon each other, giving free admission to\r\n     the air between them. Harrowing makes finer the lumps near\r\n     the surface, and mixes the fertilizer deeper than a rake can\r\n     be used. The first raking is to pulverize and level, so that\r\n     rains will neither collect in ponds, nor run off, but\r\n     penetrate the soil evenly. The second raking is to mix the\r\n     fertilizer equally through the soil, to the depth of an inch\r\n     or less, and reduce the lumps to the size of peas, which is\r\n     as fine as a medium loam can be made without danger of a\r\n     tough crust. Too much working destroys the healthy grain of\r\n     the soil, and reduces it to a paste, which the roots of the\r\n     tobacco plants can penetrate but slowly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making the plant bed in Connecticut.]\r\n\r\n     \"The bed should not be watered before nor after the plants\r\n     come up. The ground will be cold enough without any extra\r\n     evaporation, and if the place is suitable for tobacco\r\n     plants, and rightly fitted, the surface will be damp in the\r\n     morning, even in very dry weather. If the plants need\r\n     stimulating, sow on them a coat of Peruvian guano or\r\n     super-phosphate at the commencement of a rain, regulating\r\n     the quantity used by the amount of the water likely to fall.\r\n     Superphosphate makes dark-colored, thick-leaved, stocky\r\n     plants. Fish guano has about the same effect, but gives a\r\n     lighter color and thinner leaf. Peruvian guano is more\r\n     stimulating than either, and makes a light-colored, thin\r\n     leaf. Great caution is necessary in the use of these\r\n     powerful medicines to avoid an over-dose. A quantity that\r\n     would be safe in a heavy rain, would in a light rain kill\r\n     many or nearly all the plants.\r\n\r\n     \"Old seed will sprout sooner than new. The seed should be\r\n     measured while dry, and the same spoon used every year, so\r\n     the effect of a given amount may be noted and the quantity\r\n     regulated by experience. Level the seed in the spoon with a\r\n     knife-blade, like measuring grain in a half-bushel. After\r\n     sprouting again, allowing for the seed, increase in bulk for\r\n     each rod separately. The amount of seed needed to the square\r\n     rod varies with different seasons, soils, and seeds, but can\r\n     be loosely a tablespoonful. There are many breeds of\r\n     tablespoons. Too thick sowing will nearly spoil a bed by\r\n     causing it to produce weak, yellow, spindling plants, while\r\n     thin sowing will give good square ones. A bed should appear\r\n     about half stocked till the plants are nearly ready to set,\r\n     when they will suddenly spread and seem to multiply.\r\n\r\n     \"Some growers sprout and some prefer dry seed. In favorable\r\n     circumstances sprouting will give a gain of four to six\r\n     days, but in many cases dry seed will be fully as early. A\r\n     long sprout is liable to be broken off in sowing, or killed\r\n     by cold, after it is in the ground. A sprout just showing\r\n     will endure several nights' freezing if there is some warm\r\n     sun in the day-time. One way to sprout is to spread the seed\r\n     thinly on cotton cloth, and roll it up inside of woolen\r\n     cloth, keep it in a warm place, and dip in warm water every\r\n     day. In about four days the white spots will show. Sprouted\r\n     no more than this, it will stand unfavorable weather as well\r\n     as dry seed. A pint of meal and a pint of plaster to each\r\n     rod, is a good mixture to sow in. Pouring from one dish to\r\n     another many times will mix the plaster, meal, and seed\r\n     perfectly if dry. If sprouted, it should be rubbed through\r\n     the hands a few times with the mixture, to dry it and\r\n     prevent any bunches of plants coming from seed stuck\r\n     together. The plaster will show on the ground whether the\r\n     sowing is being done evenly.\r\n\r\n     \"Weeding should of course be done early and thoroughly.\r\n     Weeds are stronger than the plants, and a little neglect\r\n     will check them, making practically, perhaps, a difference\r\n     of several days. A good way to prepare for weeding and\r\n     taking up plants, is to make the bed about fifteen feet\r\n     wide, and place round, straight poles across it about eleven\r\n     feet apart. The poles should be three inches in diameter at\r\n     the smallest end. They cost nothing and save moving blocks\r\n     around with the weeding planks.\"\r\n\r\nIf the plants are tardy of growth, or the season is backward, wooden\r\nframes covered with cloth soaked in linseed oil may be placed over the\r\nbeds, which is far better than to cover with pine boughs or glass\r\neven. The cloth soaked in oil draws the rays of the sun and keeps the\r\nearth dry and warm, causing a rapid growth of the plants, which at\r\nthis stage need forcing in order to be forward enough for early\r\ntransplanting. A Virginia planter gives the following description of\r\nmaking the\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT PATCH.\r\n\r\n     \"Cut wood in September or October, so that it may season, to\r\n     burn patches (beds) in winter or spring. For ten acres, or\r\n     fifty thousand hills, burn and sow three patches each of\r\n     seventy-five square yards. Say one (if the land be in good\r\n     condition) the latter part of December, and if it be not in\r\n     condition then, burn one hundred and fifty square yards the\r\n     first good weather in January or February, and the other the\r\n     first of March. Select a place on some small constant\r\n     running stream, not liable to overflow, with a moist, sandy\r\n     soil; cut down all trees close to the ground; get off all\r\n     shrubbery, leaves, etc. The patch will then be ready for\r\n     wooding. Commence by laying on skids ten or twelve feet\r\n     long, four in diameter, three and a half feet apart; cover\r\n     thickly with brush, then put on wood regular all over, and\r\n     thick enough to burn dry an inch in depth. Commence your\r\n     fires on the side, and continue to move after it has burnt\r\n     hard enough. After it has burned, sweep off all coals, but\r\n     not the ashes: then it will be ready for hoeing up, which\r\n     can be done with good grub hoes; hoe deep, but do not turn\r\n     over the soil; get off all large and small roots; chop over\r\n     with hill hoes, and rake until the earth is thoroughly\r\n     pulverized; then put on twenty-five bushels of good, fine,\r\n     stable manure, without weed and grass seed, and twenty-five\r\n     pounds of Peruvian guano, which should be put on regularly,\r\n     hoed and raked in.\r\n\r\n     \"For sowing, lay off beds four feet wide, so that the water\r\n     from rains may run or drain off. For every bed four feet\r\n     wide and twelve yards long, sow one chalk pipe bowl full of\r\n     seed, after being mixed with ashes; tread with the feet or\r\n     pat it over with weeding hoes, that it may be close and\r\n     smooth; cover it with dog-wood, maple, or any fine brush, to\r\n     the depth of twenty or twenty-four inches, to protect the\r\n     young plants from cold or a drouth. After the plants have\r\n     commenced coming up, re-sow the patches with half the\r\n     quantity of seed first sown, which will not interfere with\r\n     the plants first up, but make good re-planting plants. When\r\n     the plants, or some of them, have grown to the size of a\r\n     Spanish mill dollar, take off the brush, pick off all\r\n     sticks, weeds, and grass, and keep them well picked until\r\n     you have finished setting out.\r\n\r\n     \"Should the plants not grow fast enough to suit, manure with\r\n     Peruvian guano; have it fine, and sow over in the middle of\r\n     the day when they are dry, or if it be raining briskly, it\r\n     may then be sown over. Should the patches be suffering for\r\n     rain, put five pounds of Peruvian guano in twenty gallons of\r\n     water, and sprinkle it over with a watering-pot. To destroy\r\n     the flea, bug, or fly, put dry leaves around the patch, and\r\n     set fire to them at night, which will attract and destroy\r\n     them if they are disturbed with a broom or leafy brush.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Virginia planters selected and made the plant patch as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     \"The quality of earth, and places which are universally\r\n     chosen for this purpose, are newly cleared lands of the best\r\n     possible light black soil, situated as near to a small\r\n     stream of water as they can be conveniently found, due\r\n     attention being paid to the dryness of the place.\r\n\r\n     \"The beds, or patches, as they are called, differ in size,\r\n     from the bigness of a small salad bed to a quarter of an\r\n     acre, according to the magnitude of the crop proposed; and\r\n     they are prepared for receiving the seed in March and the\r\n     early part of April, as the season suits, first by burning\r\n     upon them large heaps of brush wood, the stalks of the maize\r\n     or Indian corn, straw, or other rubbish; and afterwards, by\r\n     digging and raking them in the same manner of preparing\r\n     ground for lettuce seed; which is generally sown mixed with\r\n     the tobacco seed (the same process being suitable to both\r\n     plants); and which answers the double purpose of feeding the\r\n     laborer, and of protecting the young tobacco plant from the\r\n     fly; for which intent a border of mustard seed round the\r\n     plant patch is found to be an effectual remedy, as the fly\r\n     prefers mustard, especially white mustard, to any other\r\n     young plant; and will continue to feed upon that until the\r\n     tobacco plant waxes strong, and becomes mature enough for\r\n     transplantation.\"\r\n\r\nA Tennessee planter gives the following description of making the\r\nplant bed as practised in his State. In some respects, especially in\r\npreventing the growth of weeds, it is the best process of making the\r\n\"plant patch\" that we have ever seen described. He says:--\r\n\r\n     \"To make a good plant bed it requires good management and\r\n     pretty hard work. It will hardly be done well without the\r\n     presence of the farmer to attend to it. The time to make a\r\n     bed is from the 15th of October to the first of April. The\r\n     best beds are made in the Fall, for the reason that the\r\n     ground is then very dry and therefore more easily burned,\r\n     and besides there is more time for the ashes to rot before\r\n     the hot weather. A bed turned in the Fall will hold moisture\r\n     better than burned later. It takes less wood to burn well.\r\n     The plants are more vigorous and tougher. The soil should be\r\n     rich and light and never tilled before. The location should\r\n     be as much exposed to the sun as possible. It is best for a\r\n     bed to be surrounded by timber. The bugs are not so apt to\r\n     find it. Low rich valleys will generally do better than\r\n     ridges, though any good rich new ground will make good\r\n     plants if well burned and prepared. The ground should be\r\n     raked very clean of leaves before packing on the brush and\r\n     wood. The fire must have a fair chance at the ground. The\r\n     brush should be packed on straight and close, at least\r\n     enough wood mixed with it to make it lie close. If the brush\r\n     is green, endeavor to mix what dry stuff there is thorough,\r\n     so the fire will burn through without trouble. It is very\r\n     important that the fire should be as hot as possible while\r\n     it is burning. The bed should not be rained upon after it is\r\n     set before it is burned, as it will be doubtful whether the\r\n     ground beneath the brush will get dry well.\r\n\r\n     \"The ground should always be as dry as possible when it is\r\n     burned. The bed should be set on fire in several places at\r\n     once so as to have a very great heat on it at once. If the\r\n     ground is well burned it will be a little crusty and\r\n     whitish, and will pulverize beautifully. As soon as the\r\n     ground is cool enough it may be loosened up and pulverized.\r\n     This should be done well, and may be done with a good sharp\r\n     harrow and then followed with hoes and grubbing hoes. Aim to\r\n     keep the ashes and rich soil on the surface, and for this\r\n     reason a bed is sometimes damaged by a too deep working.\r\n     Rake carefully, getting off all the roots and trash. The bed\r\n     should be drained by a little ditch around it on the upper\r\n     side. If it is very early in the Fall, the seed should not\r\n     be sown until the danger of very warm days has passed. After\r\n     the last of November the sowing should be as soon as the bed\r\n     is prepared. A little less than a heaping tablespoonful to\r\n     ten steps square is about the quantity of seed. Cover the\r\n     seed very lightly with the rake or tramping the ground with\r\n     the feet. Cover the bed with a good layer of straight brush,\r\n     not enough to keep the light rains from the bed, but at the\r\n     same time enough to keep the ground in a moist condition\r\n     even in hot weather. Make a low close brush fence around the\r\n     bed to keep the leaves from being blown upon it. Re-sow\r\n     whenever the plants are well up, so as to have two chances.\r\n     Take off the brush cover when the plants are big enough to\r\n     shade the ground themselves. If the plants are rather thin\r\n     on the bed, do not uncover until you go there to draw the\r\n     plants. If there is any danger of a scarcity of plants,\r\n     always put the trash back after drawing.\"\r\n\r\nIn Cuba the\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SEMILLEROS\"\r\n\r\nor planting beds as a rule, lie higher than the rest of the farm. On\r\nthe large _vegas_ or tobacco plantations, numbers of planting beds are\r\nmade under the supervision of the mayoral. Siecke gives the following\r\naccount of making the beds or _semilleros_:\r\n\r\n     \"On the island of Cuba any field selected for the\r\n     cultivation of tobacco is divided into long beds\r\n     (_Canteras_) twenty-five to twenty-eight feet long, and\r\n     nineteen to twenty inches wide. The soil is then manured\r\n     with a mixture of two parts of well rotten dung and one part\r\n     of either sand or fine sandy earth. During the months of\r\n     August, September, and even October, the beds are watered,\r\n     and the seeds mingled with the nine-fold quantity of fine\r\n     sand, are sown broad cast or through a fine sieve, and\r\n     immediately after covered with a mixture of dung and\r\n     triturated or molaxated earth, in such a manner that this\r\n     mixture forms a covering layer of about 1-32 inches.\r\n\r\n     \"The utmost care is taken to protect the seeds against the\r\n     stifling heat of sunrays as well as heavy showers. To this\r\n     end forked sticks about three inches high, are placed\r\n     around the tobacco beds, opposite one another, and into\r\n     these forks thin twigs are laid, which are covered with\r\n     palm-leaves in such a way as to form a slight roof.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Covering plant bed.]\r\n\r\nIn Syria the tobacco seed is sown in ground free from stones, well\r\nmanured with goats dung, and strewn over with prickly bushes to\r\nprotect the young plants from birds. The plants are watered daily till\r\nthey reach the height of eight or ten inches, when they are\r\ntransplanted. In Persia where the celebrated Shiraz tobacco is\r\ncultivated, the seed is planted in a dark soil slightly manured; the\r\nground is covered with light thorny bushes to keep it warm, and these\r\nare removed when the plants are a few inches high. The ground is\r\nregularly watered if required, and when the plants are six to eight\r\ninches high are transplanted. In Turkey\r\n                                        \"the tobacco seed is sown\r\n     early in the spring, in small beds carefully prepared for\r\n     the early growth of the young plants. In a few weeks the\r\n     plants appear thick; then begins the occupation of the\r\n     farmer's wife, and their numerous children, whose little\r\n     fingers are engaged day by day in thinning the beds, care\r\n     being taken to leave the most healthy looking plants. The\r\n     husband is engaged either in carrying water from the nearest\r\n     well by the aid of his mule, or in preparing the land for\r\n     the reception of the plants. The beds are well watered\r\n     before sunrise and after sundown.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The Hungarian peasantry always make their tobacco beds\r\n     against the south ends of their houses. These beds are\r\n     enclosed by hurdles two feet high, at the bottom of which\r\n     stones are laid, and on the outside of these, thorns are\r\n     thickly placed, to exclude the moles. They fill this\r\n     enclosure to the height of eighteen inches with fresh,\r\n     coarse manure, which they press closely by beating as they\r\n     throw it on; covering with finely pulverized earth mixed\r\n     with dung of the preceding year that had become soil. They\r\n     do not regulate their time of sowing either by the moon,\r\n     month, the season, but by the holy week of the passing year;\r\n     it is on Good Friday that all of their beds are sown, and\r\n     although this day may vary nearly one month in different\r\n     years, they are faithful to their thermometer--their piety\r\n     not permitting them to know any other. To the mysterious\r\n     influence of the day, without regard to the season, they\r\n     ascribe their success and they generally succeed.\" Bickinson\r\ngives an account of the manner of making the plant bed in the East\r\nIndian Archipelago. He says:\r\n                             \"Not far from us is a hut inhabited by\r\n     two natives, who are engaged in cultivating tobacco. Their\r\n     _ladangs_, or gardens, are merely places of an acre or less,\r\n     where the thick forest has been partially destroyed by fire,\r\n     and the seed is sown in the regular spaces between the\r\n     stumps.\"\r\n\r\nAfter making the plant bed and tending through the weeding season, the\r\nnext step to be taken is the\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF GROUND\r\n\r\nfor the tobacco fields. Tobacco, unlike any other plant, readily\r\nadapts itself to soil and climate. The effect produced upon the plant\r\nmay be seen in comparing the tobacco of Holland and France, the one\r\nraised upon low, damp ground, the other on a sandy loam. The early\r\ngrowers of the plant in Virginia, were very particular in the\r\nselection of soil for the plant. The lands which they found best\r\nadapted were the light red, or chocolate-colored mountain lands, the\r\nlight black mountain soil in the coves of the mountains, and the\r\nrichest low grounds.\r\n\r\n     Tatham says: \"The condition of soil of which the planters\r\n     make choice, is that in which nature presents it when it is\r\n     first disrobed of the woods with which it is naturally\r\n     clothed throughout every part of the country; hence in the\r\n     parts where this culture prevails, this is termed new\r\n     ground, which may be there considered as synonymous with\r\n     tobacco ground. Thus the planter is continually cutting down\r\n     new ground, and every successive spring presents an\r\n     additional field, or opening of tobacco (for it is not\r\n     necessary to put much fence round that kind of crop); and to\r\n     procure this new ground you will observe him clearing the\r\n     woods from the sides of the steepest hills, which afford a\r\n     suitable soil; for a Virginian never thinks of reinstating\r\n     or manuring his land with economy until he can find no more\r\n     new land to exhaust, or wear out as he calls it; and,\r\n     besides, the tobacco which is produced from manured or\r\n     cow-penned land, is only considered, in ordinary, to be a\r\n     crop of second quality. It will hence be perceived, (and\r\n     more particularly when it is known that the earth must be\r\n     continually worked to make a good crop of tobacco, without\r\n     even regarding the heat of the sun, or the torrent of sudden\r\n     showers,) that, however lucrative this kind of culture may\r\n     be in respect to the intermediate profits, there is a\r\n     considerable drawback in the waste of soil.\"[72]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 72: Liancourt in his Travels in North America,\r\n              says of tobacco culture in Virginia: \"The nature of the\r\n              country beyond the James River is much more variegated\r\n              than on this side. At present they are preparing the\r\n              lands for the planting of tobacco. After having worked\r\n              the land it is thrown into small hillocks. * * * The\r\n              cultivation of tobacco, which has been very much\r\n              neglected during several years, is more followed this\r\n              year on account of the high price it bears in Europe;\r\n              but the soil has been so long worked with this\r\n              exhausting produce, and is so badly manured (for manure\r\n              is absolutely necessary for tobacco when the soil is not\r\n              newly broken up), that it is not capable of producing\r\n              good crops.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the Connecticut valley where tobacco is grown for wrapping\r\npurposes, the selection of soil will depend upon the color of leaf in\r\ndemand (as the soil as well as the fertilizers determine in a measure\r\nthe color and texture of the tobacco). If the grower wishes to obtain\r\ndark colored tobacco then the soil selected should be a dark loam; on\r\nthe other hand, if a light colored wrapper is desired he selects a\r\nlight loam, and with the application of proper fertilizers the proper\r\ncolor will be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant flourishes well either on high or low ground,\r\nproviding the soil be dry and free from stones, which are a source of\r\nannoyance during the cultivation of the plants and especially in\r\nharvesting. When grown on very low ground the plants should be \"set\"\r\nearly, so as to harvest before early frosts. The plant may be\r\ncultivated on such soil in almost any part of the valley excepting\r\nonly near the sound, or other body of salt water, the effect produced\r\nby planting tobacco too near the sea, more especially in Connecticut,\r\nbeing injurious to the leaf, which is apt to be thick and unfit for a\r\ncigar wrapper. In some countries, however, the leaf grown near salt\r\nwater is equal in color and texture to any grown in the interior. But\r\ngenerally the plant obtains its finest form and quality of\r\nleaf--whether in the islands of the ocean, on the great prairies of\r\nthe west, amid the sands of Arabia, on the mountains of Syria, or\r\nalong the dykes of Holland--on lands bordering the largest rivers.\r\nThis is true of the tobacco lands of Connecticut, Kentucky, Virginia,\r\nFlorida, Brazil, Venezuela, and Paraguay, as well as of those in the\r\nislands of Cuba and St. Domingo, where the rivers flow to the southern\r\ncoast from the mountains which lie to the north. It must not be\r\nimagined from this that tobacco can not be successfully cultivated at\r\na distance from valleys enriched by large and overflowing rivers. Some\r\nof the finest tobacco grown in Connecticut is grown in counties some\r\ndistance from the river that gives name to our state.\r\n\r\nWhen possible, select that kind of soil for the tobacco field that\r\nwill produce the color and texture of leaf desired. For Connecticut\r\nseed leaf a light moist loam is the proper soil. The same field can be\r\nused a number of seasons in succession; the result will be a much\r\nfiner leaf than will come from selecting a new field each year. The\r\nearly planters of tobacco in Virginia soon ruined their fields by\r\nfailing to manure them. In Maryland the soil best adapted for the\r\ngrowth of tobacco is a light, friable soil, or what is commonly called\r\na sandy loam, not too flat, but of a rolling, undulating surface, and\r\nnot liable to overflow in excessive rains. New land is far better than\r\nold.\r\n\r\nA Missouri tobacco grower gives the following account of the selection\r\nof soil for tobacco in that State:--\r\n\r\n     \"Select upland, or black oak ridges and slopes, which\r\n     comprise a large area of the tobacco lands of our county,\r\n     and carefully clear off all the timber, and take out all the\r\n     roots we can conveniently, and break up the ground as\r\n     thoroughly as can be done by ploughing and harrowing until\r\n     all the tufts and dirt are perfectly pulverized.\"\r\n\r\nIn Cuba the planters select the red soil as the best for fine tobacco.\r\nSome planters, however, prefer a soil mixed of 1/4 sand and 1/2 to\r\n3/4 of decayed vegetable matter. In St. Domingo the soil is not\r\nuniform. The planters select a deep black loam or tenacious clay, or\r\neven loams mixed with sand. The most fertile places are on the banks\r\nof the Yuna, from Laxay to Jaigua, in the vicinity of Mocha, on the\r\nbanks of the Camoo, and around La Vega. Around Santiago, clay and sand\r\npredominate, and the soil can not be highly praised. Most of the\r\ntobacco grown in the island is raised in the valley of the Vega.\r\n\r\nCussree, in treating of this subject, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The quality of tobacco depends as much upon the nature of\r\n     the soil as of the climate. The plant requires peculiarities\r\n     of soil to develop certain of its qualities. And these\r\n     peculiarities are such that art cannot furnish the\r\n     conditions to produce them where they are naturally wanting.\r\n     The sugar-cane grows chiefly on soils derived from\r\n     calcareous formations; but few or none of these are fitted\r\n     for tobacco, which is cultivated only on sandy loams. Both\r\n     the Cuban and American planters concur in asserting that a\r\n     large quantity of silicious matters in soils is essential\r\n     for the growth of good tobacco.\r\n\r\n     \"As already noticed, the rich clay loams on the banks of the\r\n     James River, in Virginia, do not grow good tobacco; while\r\n     the less fertile silicious soils in the county of Louisa\r\n     produce it much superior in quality. Small patches of\r\n     tobacco are everywhere seen growing over the sugar producing\r\n     districts of Cuba; but I saw no tobacco plantations in the\r\n     calcareous regions over which I traveled. The soils rest\r\n     upon the primary formation. Even in the tobacco districts\r\n     the planters know the spots in the different fields that\r\n     produce the various qualities of leaf.\"\r\n\r\nIn\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARING THE SOIL\r\n\r\nfor the reception and growth of the plants, the fertilizing as well as\r\nthe plowing of the fields should be performed in the most thorough\r\nmanner. The first is essential for a large and vigorous growth, while\r\nthe latter renders the cultivation of the plants much easier. The\r\ncareful preparation of soil is so intimately connected with all that\r\npertains to the plant, that it should be done well in order that the\r\nbest results may follow. Tobacco of good body, color, and texture,\r\ncannot be grown on land devoid of fertility. The field selected for\r\ntobacco, if heavy sward, should be plowed early in the spring or the\r\nfall before, and later in the season if the turf is well rotted. After\r\nspreading on the manure, the field may be plowed again and harrowed\r\nfrequently until all the lumps are made fine, and the surface mellow.\r\n\r\nIn the use of fertilizers select, if a light colored leaf is desired,\r\neither horse manure or tobacco stems. In the Connecticut valley nearly\r\nall kinds of Domestic, Commercial, and Special fertilizers are used.\r\nOf domestic fertilizers, horse manure is considered the best, as it\r\nproduces the finest and lightest colored leaf of any known fertilizer.\r\nOf commercial fertilizers, Peruvian guano is doubtless one of the\r\nbest--imparting both color and fineness to the leaf. Of special\r\nmanures, tobacco stems are perhaps the best, at least the most\r\nfrequently used. Of the other special fertilizers, such as cotton seed\r\nmeal, castor pomace, ground bone, damaged grain, tobacco waste and\r\nsaltpetre waste, much may be said both in praise and dispraise. Cotton\r\nseed meal, when used with domestic manure is an excellent and powerful\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nIf domestic manures are applied, use about twelve cords to the acre,\r\ncomposting before plowing under. As soon as spread, plow the field and\r\nsee that all of the manure is covered. If tobacco stems are used, plow\r\nin from three to five tons to the acre, all of them at once, or a part\r\nin the fall and the remainder in the spring. If Peruvian guano is\r\napplied, sow on about three hundred pounds to the acre in connection\r\nwith the domestic manure. Fish guano should be composted before\r\nsowing, either with loam or manure, and when used on light soil is a\r\nvery good fertilizer, producing a light, thin leaf. After the tobacco\r\nfield is harrowed it is ready for the ridger, which makes the hills\r\nand gathers together all of the loose manure on the surface, and\r\ncollects it in the ridges. Where a ridger is not used, work off the\r\nrows from three and one half to four feet apart, or even wider than\r\nthis. In the Connecticut valley the field is marked and hilled so as\r\nto give about 6000 hills to the acre. This will be a sufficient number\r\nif the growth is likely to be large. Where a ridger is used, manure\r\ncan not be dropped in the hill and in many respects it is well not to\r\ndo so, as the plants are liable to be blown over during a storm--not\r\nstanding as firmly in the hills as plants when no manure is used in\r\nthe hills. If the hills are to be made with the hoe, avoid all stones,\r\nbits of turf and grass in making them, and select only the fresh\r\nearth--gently patting the top of the hill with the hoe. New made hills\r\nare better than old, but it will make but little difference unless the\r\nsoil is very dry at the time of transplanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A tobacco ridger.]\r\n\r\nThe following description of the manner of preparing the tobacco field\r\nin Virginia by the old planters is quite interesting, and gives some\r\nidea of the amount of labor to be performed on the tobacco\r\nplantation:--\r\n\r\n     \"There are two distinct and separate methods of preparing\r\n     the tobacco ground: the one is applicable to the preparation\r\n     of new and uncultivated lands, such as are in a state of\r\n     nature, and require to be cleared of the heavy timber and\r\n     other productions with which Providence has stocked them;\r\n     and the other method is designed to meliorate and revive\r\n     lands of good foundation, which have been heretofore\r\n     cultivated, and, in some measure, exhausted by the calls of\r\n     agriculture and evaporation.\r\n\r\n     \"The process of preparing new lands begins as early in the\r\n     winter as the housing and managing the antecedent crop will\r\n     permit, by grabbing the undergrowth with a mattock; felling\r\n     the timber with a poll-axe;[73] lopping off the tops, and\r\n     cutting the bodies into lengths of about eleven feet, which\r\n     is about the customary length of an American fence rail, in\r\n     what is called a worm or panel fence.[74] During this part\r\n     of the process the negro women, boys, and weaker laborers,\r\n     are employed in piling or throwing the brush-wood, roots,\r\n     and small wood, into heaps to be burned; and after such logs\r\n     or stocks are selected as are suitable to be malled into\r\n     rails, make clapboards, or answer for other more particular\r\n     occasions of the planter, the remaining logs are rolled into\r\n     heaps by means of hand-spikes and skids; but the\r\n     Pennsylvania and German farmers, who are more conversant\r\n     with animal powers than the Virginians, save much of this\r\n     labor by the use of a pair of horses with a half sledge, or\r\n     a pair of truck wheels.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 73: This is a short, thick, heavy-headed axe,\r\n              of a somewhat oblong shape, with which the Americans\r\n              make great dispatch. They treat the English poll-axe\r\n              with great contempt, and always work it over again as\r\n              old iron before they deem it fit for their use.]\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 74: The worm or panel fence, originally of\r\n              Virginia, consists of logs or malled rails from about\r\n              four to six or eight inches thick and eleven feet in\r\n              length. A good fence consists of ten rails and a rider.\r\n              It is called a worm fence from the zigzag manner of its\r\n              construction.]\r\n\r\n     \"The burning of this brush-wood, and the log piles, is a\r\n     business for all hands after working hours; and as nightly\r\n     revels are peculiar to the African constitution, this part\r\n     of the labor proves often a very late employment, which\r\n     affords many scenes of rustic mirth. When this process has\r\n     cleared the land of its various natural incumbrances (to\r\n     attain which end is very expensive and laborious), the next\r\n     part of the process is that of the hoe; for the plough is an\r\n     implement which is rarely used in new lands when they are\r\n     either designed for tobacco or meadow. There are three kinds\r\n     of the hoe which are applied to this tillage: the first is\r\n     what is termed the sprouting hoe, which is a smaller species\r\n     of mattock that serves to break up any particular hard part\r\n     of the ground, to grub up any smaller sized grubs which the\r\n     mattock or grubbing hoe may have omitted, to remove small\r\n     stones and other partial impediments to the next process.\r\n     The narrow or hilling hoe follows the operation of the\r\n     sprouting hoe. It is generally from six to eight inches\r\n     wide, and ten or twelve in the length of the blade,\r\n     according to the strength of the person who is to use it;\r\n     the blade is thin, and by means of a movable wedge which is\r\n     driven into the eye of the hoe, it can be set more or less\r\n     digging (as it is termed), that is, on a greater or less\r\n     angle with the helve, at pleasure. In this respect there\r\n     are few instances where the American blacksmith is not\r\n     employed to alter the eye of an English-made hoe before it\r\n     is fit for use; the industrious and truly useful merchants\r\n     of Glasgow have paid more minute attention to this\r\n     circumstance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drawing the dirt around the foot.]\r\n\r\n     \"The use of this hoe is to break up the ground and throw it\r\n     into shape; which is done by chopping the clods until they\r\n     are sufficiently fine, and then drawing the earth round the\r\n     foot until it forms a heap round the projected leg of the\r\n     laborer like a mole hill, and nearly as high as the knee; he\r\n     then draws out his foot, flattens the top of the hill by a\r\n     dab with the flat part of the hoe, and advances forward to\r\n     the next hill in the same manner, until the whole piece of\r\n     ground is prepared. The center of these hills are in this\r\n     manner guessed by the eye; and in most instances they\r\n     approach near to lines of four feet one way, and three feet\r\n     the other. The planter always endeavors to time this\r\n     operation so as to tally with the growth of his plants, so\r\n     that he may be certain by this means to pitch his crop\r\n     within season.\r\n\r\n     \"The third kind of hoe is the broad or weeding hoe. This is\r\n     made use of during the cultivation of the crop, to keep it\r\n     clean from the weeds. It is wide upon the edge, say from ten\r\n     inches to a foot, or more; of thinner substance than the\r\n     hilling hoe, not near so deep in the blade, and the eye is\r\n     formed more bent and shelving than the latter, so that it\r\n     can be set upon a more acute angle upon the helve at\r\n     pleasure, by removing the wedge.\"\r\n\r\nThe manner of preparing the soil in Virginia at the present time is\r\nthus described by a Virginia planter:--\r\n\r\n     \"The crop usually, grown in Virginia is divided into three\r\n     classes, viz.:--Shipping, Sun-cured Fillers, and Bright\r\n     Coal-cured Wrappers and Smokers. The first may be grown on\r\n     any good soil, upland or alluvial: the latter two on dry,\r\n     well-drained upland only. All require thorough preparation\r\n     of the soil to insure good crops. The work first necessary\r\n     for this crop is to burn a sufficiency of plant land. To\r\n     prepare the land for transplanting, put the land in full\r\n     tilth, then mark off with a shovel, plow furrows three feet\r\n     to three feet four inches apart, and into these furrows sow\r\n     the fertilizers; then with turning plows, bed the land on\r\n     these furrows, and to facilitate the hilling, cross these\r\n     beds three feet apart with furrows by a shovel plow, and the\r\n     hills are made, except to pat them with hoes. Hilly lands\r\n     will seldom admit of this cross-plowing, and the beds must\r\n     be chopped into hills. On new ground apply the fertilizers\r\n     broadcast. It acts well, and for fine yellow pays better on\r\n     new grounds than any other lands. The culture is essentially\r\n     the same for all classes of tobacco. Stir the land up as\r\n     often as necessary to promote a rapid growth of the plants,\r\n     and to keep down grass and weeds. 'Shipping' tobacco may be\r\n     plowed later and worked longer than 'fine yellow.' For\r\n     'coal-curing' sacrifice pounds for color.\"\r\n\r\nThe next operation to be performed on the tobacco farm or plantation\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPLANTING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transplanting.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as four or five leaves on a plant about the size of a dollar\r\nhave appeared, they are large enough to transplant. Take the plants up\r\nwith care, sprinkling with water and keeping covered. In taking them\r\nup, the earth may be allowed to remain on the roots, or shaken off,\r\nat the option of the grower. As a general rule, however, the earth\r\nshould remain rather than be shaken off. Remove to the field and drop\r\none at each hill, and where the plants are small, two. A common custom\r\nis to \"set\" every tenth or twelfth hill with two plants. This is a\r\ngood plan, as they are frequently needed during hoeing time to \"fill\r\nin.\" If holes have not been made, insert the first two fingers, making\r\na hole large enough for the roots to remain in an easy and natural\r\nposition. Press the earth gently around the plant if the soil is\r\nmoist, but if dry, more firmly. See that the plant stands in an\r\nupright position. If dry after \"setting\" the plants, water them, and\r\nif a protracted drought follows, cover them up with grass or hay\r\ndipped in water; remove, however, in a day or two.[75] Plaster may\r\nalso be used to advantage, as it keeps the hill moist, besides\r\nfertilizing the plant; put a little just around the plants. In taking\r\nup from the bed select large ones, leaving the smaller ones to grow.\r\nTransplanting should commence as early as possible that this result\r\nmay follow.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 75: Walker says of tobacco culture in Colombia\r\n              (South America):--\"It is advisable to cover the plant\r\n              with a banana leaf, or something similar: by this means\r\n              the tobacco is protected from the heat of the sun, and\r\n              from the heavy rains, which would not prove less\r\n              prejudicial.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transplanting.]\r\n\r\nPlants with large broad leaves are considered the best, those that\r\ngrow tall and \"spindling\" or \"long shank\" plants, as they are called\r\nat the South, are rejected and should not be set out when others that\r\nare more \"stocky\" can be obtained. Avoid, however, setting too large\r\nplants, as they are not as apt to live as smaller ones. Transplanting\r\nshould be done as fast as possible, that the tobacco field may present\r\nan even appearance and be ready to harvest at one time. If the plants\r\nare to grow and ripen evenly, the transplanting should be finished in\r\na week or two from the time of the first setting. This can generally\r\nbe done unless plants are very scarce, when circumstances, beyond the\r\ngrowers' control, often make the field give apparent evidence of want\r\nof care, although the real trouble is a want of plants.\r\n\r\n     \"It may be necessary to water the plants once or twice after\r\n     transplanting; this in a measure will depend upon the\r\n     season.\"\r\n\r\nTatham in his Essay on the Culture and Commerce of Tobacco, (London\r\n1800,) gives an account of the manner of transplanting in Virginia at\r\nthat period. Under the head of\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE SEASON FOR PLANTING,\"\r\n\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n     \"The term, 'season for planting,' signifies a shower of\r\n     rain, of sufficient quantity to wet the earth to a degree of\r\n     moisture which may render it safe to draw the young plants\r\n     from the plant bed, and transplant them into the hills which\r\n     are prepared for them in the field, as described under the\r\n     last head; and these seasons generally commence in April,\r\n     and terminate with what is termed the long season in May;\r\n     which (to make use of an Irishism), very frequently happens\r\n     in June; and is the opportunity which the planter finds\r\n     himself necessitated to seize with eagerness for the\r\n     pitching of his crop: a term which comprehends the ultimate\r\n     opportunity which the spring will afford him, for planting a\r\n     quantity equal to the capacity of the collective power of\r\n     his laborers when applied in cultivation. By the time which\r\n     these seasons approach, nature has so ordered vegetation,\r\n     that the weather has generally enabled the plants, (if duly\r\n     sheltered from the spring frosts, a circumstance to which a\r\n     planter should always be attentive in selecting his plant\r\n     patch,) to shoot forward in sufficient strength to bear the\r\n     vicissitude of transplantation.\r\n\r\n     \"They are supposed to be equal to meet the imposition of\r\n     this task, when the leaves are about the size of a dollar;\r\n     but this is more generally the minor magnitude of the\r\n     leaves; and some will be of course about three or four times\r\n     that medium dimension. Thus, when a good shower or season\r\n     happens at this period of the year, and the field and plants\r\n     are equally ready for the intended union, the planter\r\n     hurries to the plant bed, disregarding the teeming element,\r\n     which is doomed to wet his skin, from the view of a\r\n     bountiful harvest, and having carefully drawn the largest\r\n     sizable plants, he proceeds to the next operation, (that) of\r\n     planting.\r\n\r\n     \"The office of planting the tobacco, is performed by two or\r\n     more persons, in the following manner: The first person\r\n     bears, suspended upon one arm, a large basket full of the\r\n     plants, which have just been drawn and brought from the\r\n     plant bed to the field, without waiting for an intermission\r\n     of the shower, although it should rain ever so heavily; such\r\n     an opportunity indeed, instead of being shunned, is eagerly\r\n     sought after, and is considered to be the sure and certain\r\n     means of laying a good foundation, which cherishes the hope\r\n     of a bounteous return. The person who bears the basket,\r\n     proceeds thus by rows from hill to hill; and upon each hill\r\n     he takes care to drop one of his plants. Those who follow\r\n     make a hole in the center of each hill with their fingers,\r\n     and having adjusted the tobacco plant in its natural\r\n     position, they knead the earth round the root with their\r\n     hands, until it is of a sufficient consistency to sustain\r\n     the plant against wind and weather. In this condition they\r\n     leave the field for a few days, until the plants shall have\r\n     formed their radifications; and where any of them shall have\r\n     casually perished, the ground is followed over again by\r\n     successive replantings, until the crop is rendered\r\n     complete.\"\r\n\r\nIn tropical regions, the plants are transplanted as well in summer and\r\nfall as in the spring, but more frequently in the early autumn. In\r\nMexico, transplanting is performed from August till November. In\r\nPersia, the tobacco plants are \"transplanted on the tops of ridges in\r\na ground trenched so as to retain water. When the plants are thirty to\r\nforty inches high, the leaves vary from three to fifteen inches in\r\nlength, when the buds are ready to be pinched off; the leaves\r\nincrease in size until August and September, when they have attained\r\ntheir growth.\" In Turkey \"when the young plants are about six inches\r\nin height they are removed from the small beds and planted in fields\r\nlike cabbages in this country, and are then left to nature to develop\r\nthem to a height of from three to four feet; three leaves, however,\r\nare removed from each plant to assist its growth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: American transplanter.]\r\n\r\nA year or two since, a machine was invented and offered to the growers\r\nof the Connecticut valley, called a transplanter, of which we here\r\ngive an engraving. The inventor claimed that the \"American\r\nTransplanter\" could do the work of several men and do it equally well.\r\nIt rolls along the ridge something like a wheelbarrow, marking the\r\nhills with a sharp joint in the wheel and setting the plants as they\r\nare dropped into the receptacles at the top.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant, like most of the vegetable products, has many and\r\nvaried foes. Not only is it most easily affected and damaged by wind\r\nand hail, but it seems to be the especial favorite of the insect\r\nworld, who, like man, love the taste of the plant. The first of them\r\n\"puts in an appearance\" immediately after transplanting, which\r\nnecessitates the performance of what is known to all growers of the\r\nplant as\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The worm.]\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of worms that prey upon the plants; viz: the \"cut\r\nworm\"[76] and the green or \"horn worm.\" The first commences its work\r\nof destruction in a few hours after transplanting in the field. During\r\nthe night it begins by eating off the small or central leaves called\r\nby the grower the \"chit,\" and often so effectually as to destroy the\r\nplant. The time chosen by the planter to find these pests of the\r\ntobacco field is early in the morning, when they can be found nearer\r\nthe surface than later in the day. Remove the earth around the roots\r\nof the plants, where the worm will generally be found. Occasionally\r\nthey are found farther from the hill. If they are numerous, the field\r\nshould be \"wormed\" every morning, or at least every other day, which\r\nlabor will be rewarded with a choice collection of primitive tobacco\r\nchewers. Sometimes the worms are very small and difficult to find,\r\nwhile at other times more are found than are required for the growth\r\nand development of the plants. As soon as they disappear they make way\r\nfor the \"horn worm\" who now takes his turn at a \"chaw.\" By some the\r\ncut worm is considered the most dangerous foe; as it often destroys\r\nthe plant, while the other injures the leaf without endangering the\r\nplant. A little plaster sprinkled around the hill sometimes checks\r\ntheir progress, yet we have never found any remedy that would hinder\r\ntheir depredations very much. The plants should be kept growing as\r\nsoon as transplanted, which will be found the better method, as they\r\nwill soon be too large for the cut worm to injure them much, if at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 76: Hughes, in his History of Barbadoes, says\r\n              that the common people call the worm kitifonia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Worming tobacco.]\r\n\r\nThe \"horn worm\" feeds upon the finest and largest leaves. They are not\r\nfound as often on the top leaves--especially those growing on the very\r\nhighest part of the stalk, as they prefer the ripe leaves and those\r\nlower on the plant. The horn worm, if large, eats the leaves in the\r\nfinest part of them, frequently destroying half of a leaf. They leave\r\nlarge holes which renders the leaf worthless for a cigar wrapper,\r\nleaving it fit only for fillers or seconds. In Cuba the tobacco plant\r\nis assailed by three different kinds of insects--one attacks the foot\r\nof the leaves; a second the under side; a third devours the heart of\r\nthe plant. In Colombia the following are the great enemies of the\r\ntobacco plant: A grub, named _canne_, which devours the young buds;\r\nthe _rosca-worm_, which commits its depredations in the night only,\r\nburrowing in the ground during the day; the grub of a butterfly,\r\ncalled by the Creoles _palometa_; a species of scarabæus called\r\n_arader_, which feeds on the root of the plant; and a species of\r\ncaterpillar[77] which is called in the country the _horned-worm_, so\r\nvoracious as to require one night only to devour an entire leaf of\r\ntobacco. At the South, and especially in Virginia, the housewife's\r\nflock of turkeys are allowed to range in the tobacco fields and devour\r\nmany of these pests.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 77: Wallace says of worming tobacco in Brazil:\r\n              \"The plants are much attacked by the caterpillar of a\r\n              sphinx moth, which grows to a large size, and would\r\n              completely devour the crop unless carefully picked off.\r\n              Old men, and women, and children are therefore\r\n              constantly employed going over a part of the field every\r\n              day, and carefully examining the plants leaf by leaf\r\n              till the insects are completely exterminated.\"]\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as the plants have been transplanted, the work of\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATING\r\n\r\nshould commence. As the tobacco plant grows and ripens in a few weeks\r\nfrom the time it is transplanted in the field, it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that the plants get \"a good start\" as soon as possible. In\r\na favorable season, and with ordinary culture, the plants will do to\r\nharvest or \"cut\" in from eight to ten weeks after transplanting. From\r\nthe rapidity of its growth it will readily be seen that the plant\r\nshould come forward at once, if large, fine leaves are desired. In a\r\nweek from the time of transplanting a light cultivator should be run\r\nbetween the rows, stirring the soil lightly, after which the plants\r\nshould be hoed carefully, drawing away from the hill and plant the old\r\nand \"baked\" earth and replacing it with fresh. If the hill is hard\r\naround the plant it should be loosened by striking the hoe carefully\r\ninto the hill and gently lifting the earth, thus making the hill\r\nmellow. This is apt to be the case with stiff, clayey soil, which, if\r\npossible, should be avoided in selecting the tobacco field.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless as true a saying as it is a common one with\r\nConnecticut tobacco-growers, that the plants will not \"start much\r\nuntil they have been hoed.\" Where the first hoeing is delayed two or\r\nthree weeks, the plants will to a certain extent become stunted and\r\ndwarfed, and will hardly make up for the delay in growing. In from two\r\nto three weeks, the field should be hoed again, and this time the\r\ncultivator should mellow the soil a little deeper than the first time,\r\nwhile the hoeing should be done in the most thorough manner. Draw the\r\nearth around the plant and cut up with the hoe all grass and weeds,\r\nand remove all stone and lumps of manure and any rubbish that will\r\nhinder easy cultivation, or retard the growth of the plants. At this\r\nperiod the most careful attention must be given to the plants, as they\r\nare (or ought to be) growing rapidly, and upon their early maturity\r\nwill depend the color and texture of the leaf.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the plants may be hoed for the third and last time (as\r\na fourth hoeing is but rarely necessary). At this time they have\r\nattained considerable size, (say two or three feet high) and are\r\nrapidly maturing, and ere long will be ready to harvest. At the last\r\nhoeing the plants should be \"hilled up,\" that is, the earth should be\r\ndrawn around the plant under the leaves, causing it to stand firmly in\r\nthe hill, and keeping the roots well protected and covered. The\r\ntobacco plant requires constant cultivation, and the cultivator may be\r\nrun through the rows after loosening the earth and turning up the\r\nmanure towards the plants.\r\n\r\nSome growers of tobacco in the early stages of its growth apply some\r\nkind of fertilizers to the backward plants; this will be found to be\r\nof advantage, and should be done just before a rain, when the plants\r\nwill start in a manner almost surprising. A little phosphate or\r\nPeruvian guano may be used, but should be applied with care or the\r\nplants may be retarded instead of quickened in their growth.\r\n\r\nThere is much to be done in the tobacco field besides cultivating and\r\nhoeing the plants. In many hills there will be found two plants, which\r\nshould be re-set at the second hoeing if needed, and if not, pulled up\r\nand destroyed, as it is better to have one large plant in the hill\r\nthan two small ones. Again, after the last hoeing, the tobacco should\r\nbe kept free from worms. If any have been overlooked they will have\r\nattained to a good size by this time, and will devour in a short time\r\nenough tobacco to make a \"short six.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this account of the cultivation of tobacco as practiced in the\r\nConnecticut valley, one will readily see that the labor performed\r\nduring the growing of the plants should not be superficial. On their\r\nrapid growth depends the color and texture of the leaf. Plants that\r\nare slow in maturing never make fine wrapping leaves or show a good\r\ncolor. Where the growth is rapid the plants will be more brittle than\r\nif of slower growth, and must therefore be handled with care in\r\npassing through the rows to worm, top, and sucker the plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Topping.]\r\n\r\nA century ago the Virginia planters cultivated their tobacco fields in\r\nthe following manner:--\r\n\r\n     \"Hoeing commences with the first growth of the tobacco after\r\n     transplantation, and never ceases until the plant is nearly\r\n     ripe, and ready to be laid by, as they term the last weeding\r\n     with the hoe; for he who would have a good crop of tobacco,\r\n     or of maize, must not be sparing of his labor, but must keep\r\n     the ground constantly stirring during the whole growth of\r\n     the crop. And it is a rare instance to see the plough\r\n     introduced as an assistant, unless it be the slook plough,\r\n     for the purpose of introducing a sowing of wheat for the\r\n     following year, even while the present crop is growing; and\r\n     this is frequently practiced in fields of maize, and\r\n     sometimes in fields of tobacco, which may be ranked amongst\r\n     the best fallow crops, as it leaves the ground perfectly\r\n     clean and naked, permitting neither grass, weed, nor\r\n     vegetable to remain standing in the space which it has\r\n     occupied.\"\r\n\r\nThe next operation to be performed in the tobacco field is known by\r\nthe name of\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPPING,\r\n\r\nand is simply breaking or cutting off the top of the stalk, preventing\r\nthe plant from running up to flower and seed. By so doing the growth\r\nof the leaves is secured, and they at once develop to the largest\r\npossible size. The leaves ripen sooner if the plant is topped, while\r\nthe quality is much better. There are various methods of topping as\r\nwell as different periods. Some growers top the plant as soon as the\r\ncapsules appear, while others wait until the plants are in full\r\nblossom. If topped before the plants have come into blossom, the\r\noperation should be performed as soon as possible, as a longer time\r\nwill be required for the leaves to grow and ripen than when topping is\r\ndelayed until the plants are in blossom. In the Connecticut valley\r\nmost growers wait until the blossoms appear before breaking off the\r\ntop. Topping must not be delayed after the blossoming, in order that\r\nall danger from an untimely frost may be avoided. The top may be\r\nbroken off with the hand or cut with a knife, the latter being the\r\nbetter as well as the safer way. Sometimes the rain soaks into the\r\nstalk, rotting it so that the leaves fall off, injuring them for\r\nwrappers. Top the plants at a regular height, leaving from nine to\r\ntwelve leaves, so that the field will look even, and also make the\r\nnumber of leaves to a plant uniform. Late plants may be topped with\r\nthe rest or not, at the option of the grower. This mode of topping\r\nrefers more particularly to cigar rather than cutting leaf. Those\r\nvarieties of tobacco adapted for cutting leaf should be topped as soon\r\nas the button appears; top low, thereby throwing the strength of the\r\nstalk into a few leaves, making them large and heavy. The number of\r\nleaves should not exceed fourteen. Let it stand from five to six weeks\r\nafter it is topped. The object in letting it stand so long after\r\ntopping is to have it thoroughly ripe. This gives it the bright, rich,\r\ngolden color, entirely different from cigar leaf, but very desirable\r\nfor chewing leaf. On account of the length of time it must stand after\r\ntopping, it is desirable to take that which has been topped early, in\r\norder to have it ripen, and get it in before a freeze, although ripe\r\ntobacco is not injured by cold nights, and will sometimes stand even\r\nan ordinary frost.\r\n\r\nThe manner of topping in Virginia by the first planters in the colony,\r\nis thus described:--\r\n\r\n     \"This operation, simply, is that of pinching off with the\r\n     thumb nail[78] the leading stem or sprout of the plant,\r\n     which would, if left alone, run up to flower and seed; but\r\n     which, from the more substantial formation of the leaf by\r\n     the help of the nutritive juices, which are thereby afforded\r\n     to the lower parts of the plant, and thus absorbed through\r\n     the ducts and fibres of the leaf, is rendered more weighty,\r\n     thick, and fit for market.\"\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 78: Many of the Virginians let the thumb nail\r\n              grow long, and harden it in the candle, for this\r\n              purpose: not for the use of gouging out people's eyes,\r\n              as some have thought fit to insinuate.]\r\n\r\nNow the custom is to top for shipping from eight to ten leaves, for\r\ncoal-curing from ten to twelve, according in both cases to strength of\r\nsoil and time of doing the work.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico \"as soon as the buds begin to show themselves the top is\r\nbroken off. Not more than from eight to ten leaves are left on the\r\nplant, without counting the sand-leaf, which is thrown away,\" and\r\ndestroyed in the same manner as the Dutch are said to do of spies. In\r\nsome countries the plants are not topped at all, and the leaves are\r\nleft upon the stalk until fully ripe, when they are picked.\r\n\r\nThe next labor following the topping of the plants is called\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCKERING.\r\n\r\nImmediately after topping the plants, shoots or sprouts make their\r\nappearance at the base of the leaves where they join the parent stalk.\r\nThey are known by the name of suckers and the removal of them by\r\nbreaking them off is called suckering. At first the suckers make their\r\nappearance at the top of the plants at the base of the upper leaves,\r\nand then gradually appear farther down on the stalk until they are\r\nfound at the very root of the plant. The plants should be suckered\r\nbefore the shoots are tough, when they will be removed with\r\ndifficulty, frequently clinging to both stalk and leaf, thereby\r\ninjuring the latter, as the leaf very often comes off with the sucker\r\nif the latter is left growing too long. The plants should be kept\r\nclean of them and especially at the time of harvesting.\r\n\r\nAn old writer on tobacco says of Suckers and Suckering:--\r\n\r\n     \"The sucker is a superfluous sprout which is wont to make\r\n     its appearance and shoot forth from the stem or stalk, near\r\n     to the junction of the leaves with the stem, and about the\r\n     root of the plant and if these suckers are permitted to\r\n     grow, they injure the marketable quality of the tobacco by\r\n     compelling a division of its nutriment during the act of\r\n     maturation. The planter is therefore careful to destroy\r\n     these intruders with the thumb-nail as in the act of\r\n     topping, and this process is termed suckering.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Suckering.]\r\n\r\nAfter this operation is performed the planter ascertains in regard to\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\nRIPENING OF THE PLANTS.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plants are fully ripe they not only take on a different\r\nhue but give evidence of decay. The leaves as they ripen become\r\nrougher and thicker, assume a tint of yellowish green and are\r\nfrequently mottled with yellow spots. The tobacco grower has two signs\r\nwhich he regards as \"infallible\" in this matter. One is that on\r\npinching the under part of the leaf together, if ripe it will crack or\r\nbreak; the other is the growth of suckers to be found (if ripe) around\r\nthe base of the stalk.\r\n\r\nTatham says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Much practice is requisite to form a judicious discernment\r\n     concerning the state and progress of the ripening leaf; yet\r\n     care must be used to cut up the plant as soon as it is\r\n     sufficiently ripe to promise a good curable condition, lest\r\n     the approach of frost should tread upon the heels of the\r\n     crop-master; for in this case, tobacco will be among the\r\n     first plants that feel its influence, and the loss to be\r\n     apprehended in this instance, is not a mere partial damage\r\n     by nipping, but a total consumption by the destruction of\r\n     every plant. I find it difficult to give to strangers a full\r\n     idea of the ripening of the leaf: it is a point on which I\r\n     would not trust my own experience without consulting some\r\n     able crop-master in the neighborhood; and I believe this is\r\n     not an uncustomary precaution among those who plant it. So\r\n     far as I am able to convey an idea, which I find it easier\r\n     to understand than to express, I should judge of the\r\n     ripening of the leaf by its thickening sufficiently; by the\r\n     change of its color to a more yellowish green; by a certain\r\n     mellow appearance, and protrusion of the web of the leaf,\r\n     which I suppose to be occasioned by a contraction of the\r\n     fibres; and other appearances as I might conceive to\r\n     indicate an ultimate suspension of the vegetative\r\n     functions.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cutting the plants.]\r\n\r\nAfter the plants have ripened the operation of cutting or\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING\r\n\r\nbegins. The cutter passes from plant to plant cutting only those\r\nplants that are ripe. In harvesting a light hatchet or saw may be\r\nused or a tobacco cutter which is the better and not as liable to\r\ninjure the leaves. The plants may be cut either in the morning (after\r\nthe dew is off) or just at night, providing there are no indications\r\nof frost. Lay the plants carefully on the sides to avoid breaking the\r\nleaves. If the plants are cut during a very warm day they should be\r\nexamined from time to time as they are liable to \"sun-burn,\" an injury\r\nmuch dreaded by the planter, as sun-burnt leaves are useless for cigar\r\nwrappers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Putting on lath.]\r\n\r\nAfter the plants are wilted on one side they are turned so that the\r\nentire plant will be in good condition to handle without breaking.\r\nHarvesting should be performed in the most careful manner. At this\r\ntime the leaves are very brittle and unless the cutter is an\r\nexperienced hand much injury may be done to the leaves. The stem of\r\neach plant is severed as near as possible to the ground and afterwards\r\nif hung on lath they are divided longitudinally to admit the air and\r\ndry them sooner. When the plants are to be hung on lath they may be\r\nwilted before \"stringing\" or not, at the option of the grower. Most\r\ngrowers are of the opinion now that the plants should be harvested\r\nwithout wilting at all, stringing on the lath as soon as cut and\r\ncarrying them immediately to the shed.\r\n\r\nWhen wilted in the field there is often much damage done to the leaves\r\nwhether they are sun-burnt or not. Oftentimes the ground is hot and\r\nthe plants in a few hours both on the under and upper sides become\r\nvery warm and almost burnt by the rays of the sun. For this reason the\r\nmanner of hanging on lath is the better way and in New England is fast\r\ndisplacing the old method of hanging with twine. When hung in this\r\nmanner five or six plants to the lath are the usual number unless they\r\nare very large. When placed or strung on the lath the plants are not\r\nas liable to sweat or pole rot, owing in part to the splitting of the\r\nstalk, which causes the rapid curing of the leaves as well as the\r\nstalk itself. A new method of hanging tobacco has been introduced of\r\nlate in the Connecticut valley by means of tobacco hooks attached to\r\nthe lath. This mode is considered by many growers the safest way, and\r\nby others as no better than the more common way of hanging simply on\r\nthe lath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carrying to the shed.]\r\n\r\nIn Virginia in \"ye olden time,\" the following method of harvesting was\r\nadopted:--\r\n\r\n     \"When the plant has remained long enough exposed to the sun,\r\n     or open air, after cutting, to become sufficiently pliant to\r\n     bear handling and removal with conveniency, it must be\r\n     removed to the tobacco house, which is generally done by\r\n     manual labor, unless the distance and quantity requires the\r\n     assistance of a cart. If this part of the process were\r\n     managed with horses carrying frames upon their backs for\r\n     the conveniency of stowage, in a way similar to that in\r\n     which grain is conveyed in Spain, it would be found a\r\n     considerable saving of labor. It becomes necessary, in the\r\n     next place, to see that suitable ladders and stages are\r\n     provided, and that there be a sufficient quantity of tobacco\r\n     sticks, such as have been described to answer the full\r\n     demand of the tobacco house, whatsoever may be its size;\r\n     time will be otherwise lost in make-shifts, or sending for a\r\n     second supply.\r\n\r\n     \"When everything is thus brought to a point at the tobacco\r\n     house, the next stage of the process is that termed hanging\r\n     the tobacco. This is done by hanging the plants in rows upon\r\n     the tobacco sticks with the points down, letting them rest\r\n     upon the stick by the stem of the lowest leaf, or by the\r\n     split which is made in the stem when that happens to be\r\n     divided. In this operation care must be taken to allow a\r\n     sufficient space between each of the successive plants for\r\n     the due circulation of air between: perhaps four or five\r\n     inches apart, in proportion to the bulk of the plant. When\r\n     they are thus threaded upon the sticks (either in the\r\n     tobacco houses, or, sometimes, suspended upon a temporary\r\n     scaffold near the door), they must be carefully handed up by\r\n     means of ladders and planks to answer as stages or\r\n     platforms, first to the upper tier or collar beams of the\r\n     house, where the sticks are to be placed with their points\r\n     renting upon the beams transversely, and the plants hanging\r\n     down between them. This process must be repeated tier after\r\n     tier of the beams, downwards, until the house is filled;\r\n     taking care to hang the sticks as close to each other as the\r\n     consideration of admitting air will allow, and without\r\n     crowding. In this position the plants remain until they are\r\n     in condition to be taken down for the next process.\"\r\n\r\nIn Cuba about the beginning of January the tobacco is ready for\r\ncutting. If the harvest is good, all the leaves are taken from the\r\nplants at once. Tobacco consisting of those leaves is called Temprano,\r\nor \"Early Pipe.\" If, on the contrary, the harvest is not good, the\r\nimmature leaves are left to grow. Tobacco formed of these leaves has\r\nthe name of Tardio, or \"Late Pipe.\" In every respect, appearance\r\nincluded, the Temprano is much superior to the Tardio. In the purchase\r\nof tobacco, it is a principal thing to ascertain how much or how\r\nlittle Temprano a parcel contains. Moreover, there are what may be\r\ncalled bastard leaves, which grow after the leaves proper have been\r\ngathered.[79] Tobacco made from these bastard leaves is easily\r\nrecognizable, the leaves being long and narrow, of a reddish color,\r\nand a bitter taste.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 79: Second crop, or Volunteer tobacco.]\r\n\r\nThe mode of harvesting tobacco in Virginia at present is thus\r\ndescribed by a Virginia planter:--\r\n\r\n     \"In bringing to the barn place the tobacco on scaffolds near\r\n     the barn-door, so that it can be readily housed in case of\r\n     rain. As Bright Wrappers and Smokers pay so much better than\r\n     dark tobaccos, it is advisable, whenever practicable, to\r\n     coal-cure all that ripens of a uniform yellow color. The\r\n     quality of the leaf will determine the hanging: 'Shipping'\r\n     should be hung seven to nine plants to the stick four and a\r\n     half feet long. To cure the plants properly requires some\r\n     experience, great care, and much attention. The plants\r\n     should not be 'cut' until fully ripe. Be careful in cutting\r\n     to select plants of a uniform size, color, and quality,\r\n     putting six or seven to the stick. Let the plants go from\r\n     the cutter's hands on to sticks held in the hands of women\r\n     or boys; and as soon as the sticks are full, place them\r\n     carefully on wagons and carry them to the barn. Place the\r\n     sticks on tiers about ten inches apart, and regulate the\r\n     plants on the sticks.\r\n\r\n     \"It is impossible to lay down any uniform system or give\r\n     specific instructions. General principles will be suggested\r\n     to guide the planter amid the changeableness of seasons and\r\n     variableness of material to be operated upon.\"\r\n\r\nIn Turkey--\r\n\r\n     \"The planters calculate always fifty-five days from May\r\n     12th, for their crops to be ready for gathering. When the\r\n     leaves show the necessary yellow tips, they are carried to\r\n     the house, and there threaded into long bunches by a large,\r\n     flat needle, about a foot long, passed through the stalk of\r\n     each.\"\r\n\r\nIn Ohio the process of harvesting tobacco for cutting is thus\r\ndescribed by a grower:--\r\n\r\n     \"When thoroughly ripe, having stood two or three weeks\r\n     longer than is necessary for cigar leaf, it is ready to cut.\r\n     This is done with a knife made for the purpose. It resembles\r\n     a wide chisel, except that the handle and chisel are at\r\n     right angles. Before cutting, the stalk is split down\r\n     through the center. Being ripe, it splits before the knife,\r\n     and following the grain the leaves escape unharmed. This\r\n     splitting is done in as little time as is necessary to cut\r\n     the stalk off in the ordinary way. Split it to within about\r\n     three or four inches of the ground, and cut it off in the\r\n     ordinary way with the same knife. Cut it off and hang it\r\n     over one of your sticks that you have driven slanting into\r\n     the ground near you. Cut and put six stalks on the stick,\r\n     and then lay it down on the ground to wilt, taking the usual\r\n     care to prevent sun-burn. When it is sufficiently wilted,\r\n     haul to the shed and hang it up.\"\r\n\r\nIn the East Indian Archipelago,\r\n                                \"as soon as the leaves are fully grown\r\n     they are plucked off, and the petiole and a midrib are cut\r\n     away. Each leaf is then cut transversely into strips about a\r\n     sixteenth of an inch wide, and these are dried in the sun\r\n     until a mass of them looks like a bunch of oakum.\"\r\n\r\nIn Persia, when the plants are ripe they are cut off close to the\r\nroot, and again stuck firmly in the ground. By exposure to the night\r\ndews the leaves change from green to yellow. When of the proper tint,\r\nthey are gathered in the early morning while wet with dew, and heaped\r\nup in a shed, the sides of which are closed in with light thorny\r\nbushes, so as to be freely exposed to the wind.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the leaves are gathered in the height of summer. When the\r\nflowers are of a light tint, two or three of the leaves nearest the\r\nroot are gathered. These are called first leaves, but produce tobacco\r\nof second quality. After the lapse of a fortnight, the leaves are\r\ngathered by twos, and from these the best tobaccos are produced. Any\r\nremaining leaves are afterwards broken off along with the stem and\r\ndried. These form the lowest quality of tobacco. After gathering, the\r\nleaves are arranged in regular layers and covered with straw matting,\r\nwhich is removed in a couple of days. The leaves are now of a light\r\nyellow color. They are then fastened by the stem in twos and threes to\r\na rope slung in a smoke room, and after being so left for fourteen or\r\nfifteen days, they are dried for two or three days in the sun, after\r\nwhich they are exposed for a couple of nights in order that they may\r\nbe moistened with dew. They are then smoothed out and arranged in\r\nlayers, the stems being fastened together, pressed down with boards,\r\nand packed away in a dark room. D'Almirda says that in Java, the\r\nleaves are gathered and tied up in bundles of fifteen, twenty or\r\nthirty, and suspended from bamboo poles running across the interior of\r\nthe shed, where they are left to dry for twenty days or more,\r\naccording to the state of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plants have been hung in the shed the process of\r\n\r\n\r\nCURING\r\n\r\nbegins. If fully ripe at the time of harvesting, the plants will \"cure\r\ndown\" very fast and take on a better hue than when they cure less\r\nrapidly. During cool weather the doors and ventilators should be left\r\nopen that the plants may have a free circulation of air and cure the\r\nfaster. When, however, the weather is damp, they should be closed, to\r\navoid sweating and pole rot. When a light leaf is desired, the tobacco\r\nshed should be provided with windows to let in plenty of sunlight,\r\nwhich has much to do with the color of the leaf. When a dark leaf is\r\ndesired, all light should be excluded.\r\n\r\nThe time necessary for the curing of the plants will depend upon the\r\nripeness of the plants as well as the weather during curing. There are\r\nthree kinds or methods of curing, viz: air curing, sun curing and\r\nfiring, or curing by flues. Air curing is the curing of the plants in\r\nsheds or barns. Sun curing is the process of curing in the open air,\r\nwhile \"firing\" is the process of curing by \"smoke,\" the common method\r\nemployed at the South and to some extent at the West. This is the\r\ncommon way of curing cutting leaf, while air curing is the manner of\r\ncuring cigar leaf. Tatham, already quoted, gives the following account\r\nof the process as performed in Virginia of\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SMOKING THE CROP.\"\r\n\r\n     \"From what has been said under the head of hanging the\r\n     plant, it will be perceived that the air is the principal\r\n     agent in curing it, but it must be also considered that a\r\n     want of uniform temperature in the atmosphere calls for the\r\n     constant care of the crop-master, who generally indeed\r\n     becomes habitually weather-wise, from the sowing of his\r\n     plants, until the delivery of his crop to the inspector. To\r\n     regulate this effect upon the plants he must take care to be\r\n     often among them, and when too much moisture is discovered,\r\n     it is tempered by the help of smoke, which is generated by\r\n     means of small smothered fires made of old bark, and of\r\n     rotten wood, kindled about upon various parts of the floor\r\n     where they may seem to be most needed.\r\n\r\n     \"In this operation it is necessary that a careful hand\r\n     should be always near: for the fires must not be permitted\r\n     to blaze, and burn furiously; which might not only endanger\r\n     the house, but which, by occasioning a sudden over-heat\r\n     while the leaf is in a moist condition, might add to the\r\n     malady of 'firing' which often occurs in the field.\"\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the manner of curing tobacco at the present time, is thus\r\ndescribed by a planter.\r\n                        \"For curing tobacco the simplest method is\r\n     sun-curing or air curing and the one most likely to prove\r\n     successful. The tobacco barn should be so constructed as to\r\n     contain four, five or six rooms four feet wide, so that four\r\n     and a half feet sticks may fit, all alike. Log barns are\r\n     best for coal curing. All should be built high enough to\r\n     contain four firing tiers under joists covered with shingles\r\n     or boards and daubed close. Fire with hickory all rich,\r\n     heavy, shipping tobacco.\r\n\r\n     \"As soon as the barn is filled kindle small fires of coals\r\n     or hickory wood, about twenty fires to a barn twenty feet\r\n     square, four under each room. Coal is best, but hickory\r\n     saplings, chopped about two feet long, make a good steaming\r\n     heat. The successful coal-curer is an artist, and all\r\n     engaged in the business are experimenters in nature's great\r\n     laboratory.\" A North Carolina planter gives an interesting\r\n     account of curing tobacco yellow. \"Curing tobacco yellow,\r\n     for which this section is so famous, is a very nice process\r\n     and requires some experience, observation, and a thorough\r\n     knowledge of the character and quality of the tobacco with\r\n     which you have to deal, in order to insure uniform success.\r\n     Much depends upon the character of the crop when taken from\r\n     the hill. If it is of good size, well matured and of good\r\n     yellowish color, there is necessarily but little difficulty\r\n     in the operation. As soon as the tobacco is taken from the\r\n     hill and housed, we commence with a low degree of heat, say\r\n     95° to 100° Fahr., 'the yellowing' or 'steaming' process.\r\n     This is the first and simplest part of the whole process,\r\n     and requires from fifteen to thirty-six hours, according to\r\n     the size and quality of the tobacco, and this degree of\r\n     heat should be continued until the leaf opens a lemon color,\r\n     and is nearly free from any green hue. When this point is\r\n     reached, the heat should be gradually raised to 105° in\r\n     order to commence drying the leaf, and here lies the whole\r\n     difficulty in curing (I mean in drying the leaf). The last\r\n     degree of heat indicated, should be continued five or six\r\n     hours, when it should again be gradually raised to 110°,\r\n     when it should be maintained at this point, until the tail\r\n     or points of the leaves begin to curl and dry. Indeed it\r\n     will probably be safest for beginners to continue this\r\n     degree of heat until one-third of the leaf is dried.\r\n\r\n     \"The temperature may then be gradually increased to 115°,\r\n     and kept for several hours at that point, until the leaf\r\n     begins to rattle when shaken, then again raise the heat to\r\n     120°, at which point it should be continued until the leaf\r\n     is dried, after which the temperature may be increased to\r\n     150° or 160° to dry the stem and stalks; the latter should\r\n     be blackened by the heat before the curing is complete.\r\n     Ordinarily it requires from two and a half to five days to\r\n     cure a barn of tobacco, dependent entirely upon the size and\r\n     quality. Put seven or eight plants on each stick and place\r\n     them eight inches apart on tier poles. In the yellowing\r\n     process the door of the barn should be kept closed to\r\n     exclude the air. When this point is reached for drying the\r\n     leaf, the door may be opened occasionally, and kept open for\r\n     twenty or thirty minutes at a time, especially if the\r\n     tobacco gets into a \"sweat,\" as it is called, or becomes\r\n     damp and clammy.\r\n\r\n     \"The temperature is raised in the barn by cautiously adding\r\n     coal from time to time to the fires, which should be placed\r\n     in small piles on the floor, in rows, allowing about five\r\n     feet between each pile, which should at first contain a\r\n     double handful of coal. In adding coal, you will soon learn\r\n     the quantity necessary to be applied by the effect produced.\r\n     Avoid raising the heat hastily after the drying is\r\n     commenced, lest the leaf should be scalded and reddened; on\r\n     the other hand, it should not be raised too slowly for fear\r\n     of 'raising the grain,' or the leaf becoming spongy and\r\n     dingy. Both extremes are to be avoided, and the skill\r\n     required is attained only by experience and observation. We\r\n     usually cut tobacco the latter part of the week, house it\r\n     and suffer it to remain until the first of next week, that\r\n     we may not violate the fourth commandment.\"\r\n\r\nIn California tobacco is cured by the method known as the \"Culp\r\nprocess\" from the name of its patentee. When the plant lies in the\r\nfield, Mr. Culp's peculiar process begins which is described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco had long been grown in California, even before\r\n     Americans came. He had raised it as a crop for fifteen\r\n     years; and before he perfected his new process, he was able\r\n     usually to select the best of his crop for smoking tobacco,\r\n     and sold the remainder for sheep wash. One year, two\r\n     millions of pounds were raised in the State, and as it was\r\n     mostly sold for sheep wash, it lasted several years, and\r\n     discouraged the growers. Tobacco always grew readily, but it\r\n     was too rank and strong. They used Eastern methods, topping\r\n     and suckering, and as the plant had here a very long season\r\n     to grow and mature, the leaf was thick and very strong. The\r\n     main features of the Culp process are, he said, to let the\r\n     tobacco, when cut, wilt on the field; then take it at once\r\n     to the tobacco house and pile it down, letting it heat on\r\n     the piles to 100° for Havana. It must, he thinks, come to\r\n     100°, but if it rises to 102° it is ruined. Piling,\r\n     therefore, requires great judgment. The tobacco houses are\r\n     kept at a temperature of about 70°; and late in the fall, to\r\n     cure a late second or third crop they sometimes use a stove\r\n     to maintain a proper heat in the house, for the tobacco must\r\n     not lie in the pile without heating. When it has had its\r\n     first sweat, it is hung up on racks; and here Mr. Culp's\r\n     process is peculiar.\r\n\r\n     \"He places the stalk between two battens, so that it sticks\r\n     out horizontally from the frame; thus each leaf hangs\r\n     independently from the stalk; and the racks or frames are so\r\n     arranged that all the leaves on all the stalks have a\r\n     separate access to the air. The tobacco houses are frame\r\n     buildings, 100x60 feet, with usually four rows of racks, and\r\n     two gangways for working. On the rack the surface moisture\r\n     dries from the leaf; and at the proper time it is again\r\n     piled, racked, and so on for three or even four times. The\r\n     racks are of rough boards, and the floor of the houses is of\r\n     earth. After piling and racking for three weeks, the leaves\r\n     are stripped from the stalk and put into 'hands,' and they\r\n     are then 'bulked' and lie thus about three months, when the\r\n     tobacco is boxed. From the time of cutting, from four to six\r\n     months are required to make the leaf ready for the\r\n     manufacturer. \"Piling\" appears to be the most delicate part\r\n     of the cure, and they have often to work all night to save\r\n     tobacco that threatens to overheat.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mexico the leaves are hung up on bast[80] strings, dried in the\r\nshade and then sent to the chief depots, where, when they have\r\nundergone fermentation, they are sorted, and tied up in bundles. In\r\nPersia, the plants are carried to the shed and heaped, and in four or\r\nfive days the desired pale yellow color is further developed. The\r\nstalks and center stem of each leaf are now removed and thrown away,\r\nwhile the leaves are heaped together in the drying house for another\r\nthree or four days, when they are fit for packing.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 80: The inner bark of the lime-tree.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stripping.]\r\n\r\nIn Turkey the bunches of leaves are exposed to the sun to dry, and\r\nsome months' exposure is necessary before they are sufficiently\r\nmatured for baling. Rain sets in at a later period, and the tobacco\r\nbecoming moist and fit for handling, is then removed from the\r\nthreads, and made into bundles or \"hands\" of about sixty leaves each\r\nand tied around the stems.\r\n\r\nAfter the leaves are thoroughly cured they are in condition for\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRIPPING.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the tobacco are easily affected by the humidity of the\r\natmosphere and during damp weather every opportunity is improved by\r\nthe grower for taking down the tobacco preparatory to stripping. After\r\ntaking down from the poles the plants should be packed in order to\r\nkeep moist until stripped. The tobacco should not be removed from the\r\npoles when it drips or the juice exudes from either the stalk or the\r\nleaves. If stripped in this condition the leaves are apt to stain and\r\nthus become unfit for wrappers. The operation of stripping consists in\r\ntaking the leaves from the stalk and tying them in bundles or hands\r\nwith a leaf around the base of the hand. Each \"hand\" or bunch should\r\ncontain at least eight leaves and from that number to twelve. If the\r\nplants are large the leaves of one stalk will form a hand; a poor leaf\r\nis used for binding as it can not be used for the same purpose as the\r\nleaves around which it is bound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hands.]\r\n\r\nThe old planters of tobacco in Virginia called this operation of\r\ntaking off the leaves and tying them up \"stripping and bundling\" which\r\nis here described.\r\n\r\n     \"When the plants of tobacco which are thus hanging upon the\r\n     sticks in the house have gone through the several stages of\r\n     process before the time of stripping, and are deemed to be\r\n     in case for the next operation, a rainy day (which is the\r\n     most suitable) is an opportunity which is generally taken\r\n     advantage of when the hands cannot be so well employed out\r\n     of doors. The sticks containing the tobacco which may be\r\n     sufficiently cured, are then taken down and drawn out of the\r\n     plants. They are then taken one by one respectively, and the\r\n     leaves being stripped from the stalk of the plant are rolled\r\n     round the butts or thick ends of the leaves with one of the\r\n     smallest leaves as a bandage, and thus made up into little\r\n     bundles fit for laying into the cask for final packing.\"\r\n\r\nHazard gives the following method of assorting and stripping tobacco\r\nin Cuba:--\r\n\r\n     \"Among the Cubans, the leaves are divided into four classes:\r\n     first, _desecho_, _desecho limpio_, which are those\r\n     immediately at the top of the plant, and which constitute\r\n     the best quality, from the fact that they get more equally\r\n     the benefit of the sun's rays by day and the dew by night;\r\n     second, _desechito_, which are the next to the above; third,\r\n     the _libra_, the inferior or small leaves about the top of\r\n     the plant; and fourth, the _injuriado_, or those nearest the\r\n     root. Of the _injuriado_ there are three qualities; the best\r\n     is called _injuriado de reposo_, or 'the picked over,' and\r\n     the other two, firsts and seconds (_primeros_, _sequndos_).\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco of the classes _desechito_ and _libra_, of which\r\n     the leaves are not perfect, is called _injuriado bueno_,\r\n     while all the rest, of whatever quality, that is broken in\r\n     such a manner as to be unfit for wrappers are called\r\n     _injuriado malo_. Amongst the trade in place of the above\r\n     names, the different qualities are simply designated by\r\n     numbers.\"\r\n\r\nMeyer, a German writer who resided several years in Cuba, gives\r\nanother classification, making ten classes altogether, while Hazard\r\nmentions only four general classes.\r\n\r\nAfter the leaves are stripped from the stalk the process known as\r\n\r\n\r\nASSORTING\r\n\r\ncommences. Assorting tobacco is doing up in hands the various\r\nqualities and keeping them separate. In the Connecticut valley the\r\ngrowers make usually but two kinds or qualities excepting only when\r\nthe crop is poor when three qualities are made, viz: Wrappers,\r\nSeconds, and Fillers. The Wrappers are the largest and finest leaves\r\non the plant and should be free from holes and sweat as well as green\r\nand white veins. The leaves selected for this quality come from the\r\nmiddle and even the top leaves of the plant. The Seconds are made up\r\nof leaves not good enough for Wrappers and too good for Fillers. Such\r\nleaves sometimes are worm-eaten and of various colors on the same\r\nleaf--one part dark and another light. The fillers are the poorest\r\nquality of leaves to be found on the plants, and consist of the \"sand\"\r\nor ground leaves, one or two to each plant. Some of our largest\r\ngrowers in assorting the leaves keep each color by itself, an\r\noperation known as\r\n\r\n\r\nSHADING.\r\n\r\nThis is a very delicate operation and requires a good eye for colors\r\nas well as a correct judgment in regard to the quality of the leaf.\r\nThis mode of assorting colors in stripping is similar to that of\r\nshading cigars, in which the utmost care is taken to keep the various\r\ncolors and shades by themselves. In shading the wrappers only are so\r\nassorted, and may be \"run into\" two or three shades depending on the\r\nnumber of shades or colors of the leaf. The better way is to make only\r\ntwo qualities of the wrappers in shading--viz., light and dark\r\ncinnamon \"selections.\" Shading tobacco does not imply that it is\r\ncarried to its fullest extent in point of color as in shading cigars,\r\nbut simply keeping those general colors by themselves like light and\r\ndark brown leaves. Cutting tobaccos before being used are subjected to\r\na process known as\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEMMING.\r\n\r\nTatham gives the following account of the process of stemming in\r\nVirginia a century ago:--\r\n\r\n     \"Stemming tobacco is the act of separating the largest stems\r\n     or fibres from the web of the leaf with adroitness and\r\n     facility, so that the plant may be nevertheless capable of\r\n     package, and fit for a foreign market. It is practised in\r\n     cases where the malady termed the fire, or other casual\r\n     misfortune during the growth of the plant, may have rendered\r\n     it doubtful in the opinion of the planter whether something\r\n     or other which he may have observed during the growth of his\r\n     crop, or in the unfavorable temperature of the seasons by\r\n     which it hath been matured does not hazard too much in\r\n     packing the web with a stem which threatens to decay. To\r\n     avoid the same species of risk, stemming is also practised\r\n     in cases where the season when it becomes necessary to\r\n     finish packing for a market is too unfavorable to put up the\r\n     plant in leaf in the usual method; or when the crop may be\r\n     partially out of case. Besides the operation of stemming in\r\n     the hands of the crop-master, there are instances where this\r\n     partial process is repeated in the public warehouses; of\r\n     which I shall treat under a subsequent head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stemming.]\r\n\r\n     \"The operation of stemming is performed by taking the leaf\r\n     in one hand, and the end of the stem in the other, in such a\r\n     way as to cleave it with the grain; and there is an\r\n     expertness to be acquired by practice, which renders it as\r\n     easy as to separate the bark of a willow, although those\r\n     unaccustomed to it find it difficult to stem a single plant.\r\n     When the web is thus separated from the stem, it is made up\r\n     into bundles in the same way as in the leaf, and is laid in\r\n     bulk for farther process. The stems have been generally\r\n     thrown away, or burnt with refuse tobacco for the purpose of\r\n     soap-ashes; but the introduction of snuff-mills has, within\r\n     a few years back, found a more economical use for them.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tobacco has been stripped it is ready for\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Packing.]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to pack the \"hands\" after stripping in order to keep\r\nit moist, or in nearly the same condition as when stripped. Select a\r\ncool place, not too dry or too damp, but one where if properly\r\nprotected, the tobacco will remain moist. It should be packed loosely\r\nor compact, according as the hands are moist or dry. It may be packed\r\nin the center of the floor so that it may be examined from either\r\nside, or against the sides of the packing house, as may be thought\r\nbest. Hand the tobacco to the packer, who presses the hands firmly\r\nwith his knees and hands, laying the tobacco in two tiers and keeping\r\nthe pile at about the same height until all is packed. If possible\r\npack all together, that is, each kind by itself, as it is better to\r\nhave the wrappers or fillers all together rather than in several\r\nplaces, as the moisture is retained better than when it is packed in\r\nsmall piles or heaps. Use in packing a plank or board, placing it\r\nagainst the front of the tier and bring the ends of the hands up\r\nagainst it. This will make the tobacco look much better and also\r\nrender the process of packing firmer.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco may be packed any height or length desired, according to\r\nthe quantity, but usually from three to four feet high will be found\r\nto be convenient while the length may be proportioned to the height or\r\nnot. Tobacco may be packed by the cord or half cord so as to be able\r\nto judge of the quantity--good large wrappers averaging a ton to the\r\ncord. Seconds and Fillers will not contain as many pounds to the cord\r\nas wrappers. After the tobacco is packed, cover first with\r\nboards--planed ones are preferable,--or even shingles--and press\r\nfirmly, especially if the tobacco is dry, then cover with blankets or\r\nany kind of covering, adding plank or pieces of timber if additional\r\npressure is needed. It can now remain packed until sold or cased, and\r\nwill hardly need to be examined unless packed while very damp or kept\r\npacked until warm weather.\r\n\r\nWailes says of planting by the early planters of tobacco in\r\nMississippi:--\r\n\r\n     \"The larger planters packed it in the usual way in\r\n     hogsheads. Much of it, however, was put up in carrets, as\r\n     they were called, resembling in size and form two small\r\n     sugar-loafs united at the larger ends. The stemmed tobacco\r\n     was laid smoothly together in that form coated with wrappers\r\n     of the extended leaf, enveloped in a cloth, and then firmly\r\n     compressed by a cord wrapped around the parcel, and which\r\n     was suffered to remain until the carret acquired the\r\n     necessary dryness and solidity, when together with the\r\n     surrounding cloth, it was removed, and strips of lime-bark\r\n     were bound around it at proper distances, in such a manner\r\n     as to secure it from unwrapping and losing its proportions.\"\r\n\r\nIn Turkey, after the tobacco is made into bundles or hands, it is\r\npiled against the walls inside the dwelling rooms and a carefully\r\ngraduated pressure put upon it until ready for baling. In Java, when\r\nthe tobacco is ready to pack the leaf is examined, and if found quite\r\nbrown, it is tightly pressed and packed up either in boxes or matting\r\nfor exportation, or in the bark of the tree plantain, for immediate\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nThe next process on the tobacco plantation is that of\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIZING, CASING, AND BALING.\r\n\r\nThe term prizing originated in Virginia, and as performed by the early\r\nplanters, is thus described by an old writer on tobacco culture:--\r\n\r\n     \"Prizing, in the sense in which it is to be taken here is,\r\n     perhaps, a local word, which the Virginians may claim the\r\n     credit of creating, or at least of adopting; it is at best\r\n     technical, and must be defined to be the act of pressing or\r\n     squeezing the article which is to be packed into any\r\n     package, by means of certain levers, screws, or other\r\n     mechanical powers; so that the size of the article may be\r\n     reduced in stowage, and the air expressed so as to render it\r\n     less pregnable by outward accident, or exterior injury, than\r\n     it would be in its natural condition.\r\n\r\n     \"The operation of prizing, however, requires the combination\r\n     of judgment and experience; for the commodity may otherwise\r\n     become bruised by the mechanic action, and this will have an\r\n     effect similar to that of prizing in too high case, which\r\n     signifies that degree of moisture which produces all the\r\n     risks of fermentation, and subjects the plant to be\r\n     shattered into rags. The ordinary apparatus for prizing\r\n     consists of the prize beam, the platform, the blocks, and\r\n     the cover. The prize beam is a lever formed of a young tree\r\n     or sapling, of about ten inches diameter at the butt or\r\n     thicker end, and about twenty or twenty-five feet in length;\r\n     but in crops where many hands are employed, and a sufficient\r\n     force always near for the occasional assistance of managing\r\n     a more weighty leverage, this beam is often made of a larger\r\n     tree, hewn on two of its sides to about six inches thick,\r\n     and of the natural width, averaging twelve or fourteen\r\n     inches. The thick end of this beam is so squared as to form\r\n     a tenon, which is fitted into a mortise that is dug through\r\n     some growing tree, or other, of those which generally abound\r\n     convenient to the tobacco house, something more than five\r\n     feet above the platform. Close to the root of this tree, and\r\n     immediately under the most powerful point of the lever, a\r\n     platform or floor of plank is constructed for the hogshead\r\n     to stand upon during the operation of prizing. This must be\r\n     laid upon a solid foundation, levelled, upon hewn pieces of\r\n     wood as sleepers; and so grooved and perforated that any wet\r\n     or rain which may happen to fall upon the platform may run\r\n     off without injuring the tobacco. Blocks of wood are\r\n     prepared about two feet in length, and about three or four\r\n     inches in diameter, with a few blocks of greater dimensions,\r\n     for the purpose of raising the beam to a suitable purchase;\r\n     and a movable roof constructed of clap-boards nailed upon\r\n     pairs of light rafters, of sufficient size to shelter the\r\n     platform and hogshead, is made ready to place astride of the\r\n     beam, as a saddle is put upon a horse's back, in order to\r\n     secure the tobacco from the weather while it is subjected to\r\n     this tedious part of the process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prizing in olden times.]\r\n\r\n     \"That part of the apparatus which is designed to manage and\r\n     give power to the lever is variously constructed: in some\r\n     instances two beams of timber about six feet long, and\r\n     squared to four by six inches, are prepared; through these,\r\n     by means of an auger hole, a sapling of hickory or other\r\n     tough wood, is respectively passed; and the root thereof\r\n     being formed like the head of a pin to prevent its slipping\r\n     through the hole, the sapling is bent like a bow, and the\r\n     other end is passed through the same piece of wood in a\r\n     reversed direction, in which position it is wedged. These\r\n     two bows are in this manner hung by the sapling loops upon\r\n     the end of the prize beam or lever; and loose planks or\r\n     slabs of about five or six feet long being laid upon these\r\n     suspended pieces of timber, a kind of hanging floor or\r\n     platform is constructed, upon which weights are designed to\r\n     act as in a scale. A pile of large stones are then carted to\r\n     the place, and a sufficient number of these are occasionally\r\n     placed upon this hanging platform, until the lever has\r\n     obtained precisely the power which the crop master wishes to\r\n     give it by this regulating medium.\r\n\r\n     \"The prizing or packing by the old planters must have been a\r\n     tedious affair, and far different from the quick work made\r\n     by the screw-press now owned by all well to-do planters. The\r\n     size of the hogsheads containing the tobacco was regulated\r\n     by law to the standard of four feet six inches in length,\r\n     but the shape of the cask varied according to the fancy of\r\n     the cooper, or roughness of his work. At this period (a\r\n     century ago), the tobacco hogshead was made most generally\r\n     of white oak; but Spanish oak, and red oak, were sometimes\r\n     used, when the usual kind could not be so readily commanded.\r\n     Now the hogsheads are made of pine, but are nearly as rough\r\n     as those made by the colonial growers.\r\n\r\n     \"Tobacco, if well packed, and prized duly, will resist the\r\n     water for a surprising length of time. An instance is\r\n     recorded in strong proof of this, which occurred at\r\n     Kingsland upon James river in Virginia, where tobacco, which\r\n     had been carried off by the great land floods in 1771, was\r\n     found in a large raft of drift wood in which it had lodged\r\n     when the warehouses at Richmond were swept away by the\r\n     overflowing of the freshets; an inundation which had\r\n     happened about twenty years before this cask was found.\"\r\n\r\nTatham gives the following account of a similar instance:--\r\n\r\n     \"On the sixth of October, 1782, I myself was one of a party\r\n     who were shipwrecked upon the coast of New Jersey, in\r\n     America, on board the brigantine Maria, Captain McAulay,\r\n     from Richmond in Virginia, and laden with tobacco. Several\r\n     hogsheads, which were saved from the wreck were brought\r\n     round to Stillwill's landing upon Great Egg harbor; and\r\n     amongst them some which had lost the headings of the cask,\r\n     and the hoops and staves, were so much shattered by the\r\n     beating of the surf, that it was not thought worth while to\r\n     land them, and they were just tumbled out of the lighter\r\n     upon the beach, and left to remain where the tide constantly\r\n     flowed over them for several weeks, so that the outside was\r\n     completely rotten, and they had the appearance of heaps of\r\n     manure. In this very bad condition, I still persisted in\r\n     trying to save what I supposed might remain entire in the\r\n     interior of the lump, and at last prevailed so far over the\r\n     ignorance and prejudice by which I had been ridiculed, as to\r\n     effect an overhauling and repacking of this damaged\r\n     commodity and to save a proportion thereof very far beyond\r\n     what I myself had expected. Some of the heart of this was so\r\n     highly improved, that I have seldom seen tobacco equal to it\r\n     for chewing, or for immediate manufacture; and what was\r\n     repacked was sold to a tobacconist in Water Street,\r\n     Philadelphia, at a price so little reduced below the\r\n     ordinary market, that the man very frankly told me, that if\r\n     he could have had the whole drowned tobacco in a short time\r\n     after it was saved from the wreck, he would have made no\r\n     difference in the price but would rather have preferred it\r\n     for immediate manufacture, as it would have spared him, some\r\n     little labor in a part of the process.\"\r\n\r\nPrizing tobacco applies to the packing of tobacco in hogsheads all\r\nsuch leaf being used for cutting purposes, cigar leaf being either\r\ncased or baled. In some sections about 800 pounds net is packed in one\r\nparcel, while in others 1000 pounds and sometimes even 1500 and 1800\r\npounds. \"Seed leaf\" tobacco in this country is all packed in cases\r\ninstead of hogsheads, each case containing from 375 to 400 pounds net.\r\nIt is necessary that all kinds of tobacco should be pressed in some\r\nkind of package before it is ready to be manufactured. There are\r\nexceptions, however, as in the case of Latakia tobacco, which is\r\nsimply hung in the peasant's huts through the winter to be fumigated\r\nand to acquire the peculiar flavor this tobacco has. Tobacco in good\r\ncondition to case must be damp enough to bear the pressure in casing\r\nwithout breaking and crumbling, while it must not be too moist or it\r\nwill rot in the case. The number of pounds to the case will vary\r\naccording to the size of the leaf, as well as the condition of the\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nWhen ready to case the \"hands\" are packed in the case, laying them in\r\ntwo tiers. The case being nearly full the contents are then subjected\r\nto a strong pressure until it is reduced to one half its bulk, then\r\nanother layer is placed in the case and again pressed, and succeeded\r\nby as many as are required to fill the case. The tobacco should be\r\npacked evenly in layers with the ends of the leaves touching one\r\nanother or even crossing, and the whole mass presenting a smooth and\r\neven appearance. The \"wrappers\" should be cased by themselves and \"the\r\nseconds\" and \"fillers\" together or separate at the option of the\r\npacker. The tobacco should be cased hard so that the mass will rise\r\nbut little when the pressure is removed. As the fillers are usually\r\ndry they must be moistened before casing or subjected to a very strong\r\npressure. After packing the cases should be turned on their sides, and\r\nthe grower's name marked on each case, also the kind of tobacco,\r\nwhether wrappers or fillers, together with the number of pounds and\r\nthe weight of the case. This is necessary to ascertain the quality of\r\nleaf produced by each grower, as well as to protect the buyer against\r\nall fraud in packing and casing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco press.]\r\n\r\nThe cases may be piled one upon another, but should be kept from the\r\nrays of the sun and in a dry room, so that the sweating of the leaf\r\nmay be sufficient to fit it for use. It is necessary that the season\r\nduring sweating should be warm, in order to secure a good sweat. It\r\nwill commence to \"warm up\" sometime in April or May, and will be ready\r\nto sample or uncase about the first of September. After \"going through\r\na sweat,\" the leaf takes on a darker color, and loses the rank flavor\r\nwhich it had before. It is better to let the tobacco dry off before\r\nbeing used or taken from the case. \"Baling\" is packing tobacco in\r\nsmall bundles or packages containing from one hundred to two hundred\r\npounds, and is the manner of putting up tobacco for export in Cuba,\r\nParaguay, Algiers, Hungary, Mexico, Syria, the Philippines, China,\r\nSumatra, Japan, Java, Turkey, and in some other tobacco-growing\r\ncountries. In Cuba after being formed into hands or \"_gavillos_\" and\r\nfour of these tied together with strips of palm-leaf so as to\r\nconstitute a \"_manoja_,\" fifty or eighty of them are packed together,\r\nmaking what is called a \"_tercio_\" or bale, the average weight of\r\nwhich is two hundred pounds. Hazard says of the number of pounds\r\nproduced on the _vegas_:\r\n\r\n     \"A _caballeria_ of thirty-three acres of ground produces\r\n     about nine thousand pounds of tobacco, made up in about the\r\n     following proportions: four hundred and fifty of _desecho_,\r\n     or best; one thousand eight hundred pounds _desechito_, or\r\n     seconds; two thousand two hundred and fifty pounds of\r\n     _libra_, or thirds; and four thousand five hundred pounds of\r\n     _injuriado_. From these figures, taking the bale at one\r\n     hundred pounds, and the average price of the tobacco at\r\n     twenty dollars per bale, (though this is a low estimate, for\r\n     the crops of some of the vegas are sold as high, sometimes,\r\n     as four hundred dollars per bale,) an approximate idea may\r\n     be formed of the profit of a large plantation in a good\r\n     year, when the crops are satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, after being baled, the tobacco is sent to the government\r\nfactories, where it is not weighed until two months afterwards. The\r\nprice is high, varying from twelve to twenty-eight dollars per crate;\r\nand is paid in ten monthly installments. In Persia, when the tobacco\r\nis fit for packing, the leaves are carefully spread on each other, and\r\nformed into cakes four or five feet round, and three to four inches\r\nthick, care being taken not to break or injure the leaves. Bags of\r\nstrong cloth, thin and open at the sides, are provided, into which the\r\ncakes are pressed strongly down on each other. When the bags are\r\nfilled they are placed in a separate drying house, and are turned\r\nevery day. Water is then sprinkled on the cakes, if required, to\r\nprevent them from breaking. The leaf is valued for being thick, tough,\r\nof a uniform light yellow color, and of an agreeable aromatic smell.\r\n\r\nIn Turkey, the tobacco after remaining in the dwelling-room of the\r\nhouse a sufficient time, is ready for baling. The bales average in\r\nweight about forty _oques_ (110 English pounds). The covering of the\r\nbales is a sort of netting made by the peasants from goat's hair; it\r\nis elastic and of great strength. Vamberry says of packing tobacco in\r\nEuropean Turkey:\r\n\r\n     \"The tobacco is packed in small packets (_bog tche_), and\r\n     only after it has lain for years in the warehouses of the\r\n     tobacco merchants, is it honored by the connoisseurs of\r\n     Stamboul with the title of 'Aala Gobeck.' This sort of\r\n     finely-cut tobacco resembling the finest silk, is held in\r\n     equally high estimation in the palaces of the Grand\r\n     Seignior, in the seraglio, and in the divan of the sublime\r\n     Porte, where the privy council debate the most important\r\n     affairs of the empire, under the soothing influence of its\r\n     aromatic vapors.\"\r\n\r\nIn St. Domingo and the United States of Colombia, South America, the\r\nbales are called _Serous_, and in Holland and Germany, Packages.\r\nTobacco is sent to market in bales of various sizes and made of\r\nvarious materials. In Cuba, the tobacco is bound with palm leaves. In\r\nSouth America it is packed in ox hides. From the East it comes in\r\ncamel's hair sacks or \"netting made from goat's hair,\" while from\r\nPersia, tobacco is exported in sacks of strong cloth. Manilla tobacco\r\nis shipped in bales containing four hundred pounds net. It is covered\r\nfirst with bass and then with sacking, made of Indian grass tied\r\naround with ratan. Each bale contains a printed statement, of which\r\nthe following is a copy:\r\n\r\n            PROVINCIA DE CAGAYAN,\r\n\r\n  PARTIDO DE CITÁ.     _Cosecha de 186._\r\n\r\n            Clas de         conteine 40 manos de tabaco\r\n            aforado por la junta de aforo y enfardelado\r\n            por el que subscribe.

El Interventor de aforo.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant while growing is easily affected by a wet season,\r\nwhile it is also liable to injury by the opposite extreme of heat or\r\ndrought. If a drought occurs soon after the plants are transplanted,\r\ntheir growth and development is greatly hindered. When, however, the\r\nplants are nearly grown, a severe drought affects the plants but\r\nlittle, the large palm-like leaves forming a kind of canopy and\r\nkeeping the earth moist and cool. During a wet season, and sometimes\r\nwhen the plants have been set in damp soil, they are affected by\r\n\"brown rust,\" or, as it is called at the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Firing.]\r\n\r\nIt is supposed to be caused by very damp weather, and is much dreaded\r\nby all growers of the weed, as it is sometimes quite common, and on\r\nlow soil affects the crop to a considerable extent. It spots the leaf\r\nwith hard brown spots that often fall out, producing holes fatal to\r\nthe value of the crop. The lower leaves on the plant are more likely\r\nto be injured than those higher on the stalk. The spots vary in size;\r\nsometimes they are as large as a three cent piece, but more frequently\r\nabout the size of a small pearl button. At the South, rust or \"firing\"\r\nis much more common than in the Connecticut valley, and often whole\r\nfields are badly affected by the malady. Some seasons hardly any rust\r\ncan be discovered on the leaves, and if any spots are found they are\r\nfixed and do not spread.\r\n\r\nSmall plants are more liable to be injured than large ones, and not\r\nunfrequently nearly every leaf is covered with the spots. Many\r\ntheories have been advanced in regard to the cause of rust and how to\r\nprevent it. It usually occurs just before, or after, topping, and if\r\nthe plants are ripe enough to harvest, they should be cut before the\r\nrust spreads to any great extent. It makes its appearance very\r\nsuddenly, and if the weather be favorable (damp), spreads rapidly,\r\noften in a few days injuring the plants to a great extent. There are\r\ntwo varieties of rust or \"firing,\" brown and white; and while the\r\nformer is dreaded by the grower, as it injures the quality of the\r\nplant, the other is regarded with special favor, as it gives value to\r\nthe leaf.\r\n\r\nThe white rust,[81] as it is termed, is a small white speck (often\r\nnoticed on cigars), making its appearance on the leaves of the plant\r\ntowards the latter part of its growth, and usually found on the top\r\nand middle leaves. It is usually found on the best, and more\r\nfrequently on light than dark tobacco. Unlike the brown rust, the\r\nwhite does not fall out, but is as firm in its place as any part of\r\nthe leaf; sometimes the spots are as white as chalk, and again they\r\nwill be of a yellowish shade, though lighter in color than brown rust.\r\nThe lighter the color the better their effect on the leaf upon which\r\nthey are found. Leaves thus \"spotted\" make the finest of wrappers, and\r\nlight-colored leaf thus affected brings the very highest price. It is\r\nwell known to manufacturers of cigars that such leaves burn well, and\r\nalmost invariably make a light ash. Good judges of cigars always pick\r\nfor those thus affected, and watch with interest the ash of the cigar,\r\nnoting the color as well as the flavor.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 81: Florida tobacco is noted for the white\r\n              rust found on the leaves.]\r\n\r\nSome seasons this kind of rust is quite common, and it is supposed to\r\nbe caused in the same way as the brown, although there are some\r\ngrowers who think that it is produced by altogether different causes.\r\nThere is, however, a marked difference in the appearance of the leaves\r\nthus spotted; the white rust is not usually as thick upon the leaf,\r\nand is more generally found along the sides of the leaf, while the\r\nbrown rust is found more in the center than along the sides. Tobacco\r\nof a light cinnamon color thus \"marked\" is considered the most\r\nvaluable, and could the planter obtain such a crop at option, he could\r\nrealize the very highest price for it. Large growers who find much of\r\ntheir tobacco \"spotted\" in this manner, would do well to keep such\r\nleaves by themselves, and sell direct to the manufacturer. Both kinds\r\nof rust are more commonly seen on the plants during a wet than a dry\r\nseason, and particularly if the plants have grown rapidly during the\r\nlatter part of the time.\r\n\r\nFormerly buyers of leaf tobacco were more interested in leaf of this\r\ndescription than now; and some of them, more anxious than others, made\r\nliberal offers to any grower of tobacco who could ascertain how such\r\ntobacco could be obtained. It is hardly probable that any method of\r\nculture could be devised so as to obtain such leaf; it seems to be a\r\nfreak of nature, depending somewhat on the soil as well as the\r\nhumidity of the atmosphere, and without doubt is beyond the control of\r\nthe grower. Various theories propounded and experiments tried have not\r\nmet with any success that we are aware of. Some growers are of the\r\nopinion that light manure spread on moist soil will tend to produce\r\nleaf affected with white rust, while others affirm that such leaf is\r\ncommon on high ground when manured with light fertilizers. It is a\r\nmatter of doubt whether such leaf can be obtained by any preparation\r\nof soil, or any system of cultivation whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThe selection of large, well-formed plants for the maturing of the\r\nseeds, is of more importance than most growers are aware of.[82] Not\r\nonly should the altitude of the plant be taken into account, but also\r\nthe size and texture of the leaf.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 82: Liancourt says of the selection of seed\r\n              plants in Virginia:--\"The seed for the next year is\r\n              obtained from forty to fifty stalks per acre, which the\r\n              cultivator lets run up as high as they will grow,\r\n              without bruising their heads.\"]\r\n\r\nIf a variety foreign to the soil (on which it is cultivated) is grown,\r\nthen particular pains should be taken to select seed plants resembling\r\nthose cultivated in its native home.\r\n\r\nIn cultivating foreign varieties, even the first season plants may be\r\nseen that do not resemble the majority, but are seemingly trying to\r\naccommodate themselves to the soil and climate, and in consequence\r\nresemble in a measure the variety commonly cultivated. Growers of\r\nHavana tobacco in the Connecticut valley can testify to this, and\r\nespecially to the increased size of the plants. There are, however,\r\ngrowers of Havana tobacco, who claim that it will never deteriorate in\r\nquality, and that seed from Havana is not required in order to secure\r\nthe delightful flavor of the _Vuelta de Abajo_ leaf. Our experience is\r\nthe reverse of this, and applies more directly to the flavor of the\r\nleaf than the size, color, or texture. In the Connecticut valley\r\nHavana leaf retains in a remarkable degree the texture and color of\r\nleaf, but not the flavor. Fresh or new seed is required from time to\r\ntime. Sieckle says on the choice of seed:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spanish seed tobacco.]\r\n\r\n     \"The selection of seed is one of the principal conditions\r\n     for raising good tobacco, especially when intended for the\r\n     manufacture of cigars. In the United States now and then\r\n     Havana seeds are planted. The tobacco raised therefrom\r\n     generally resembles the real Havana in shape and color of\r\n     leaves. But in order to reproduce approximately also the\r\n     fine taste and flavor of genuine Havana tobacco, it would be\r\n     required to impart to the soil exactly the components which\r\n     constitute the famous tobacco-ground, viz.: the soil of the\r\n     above-mentioned _Vuelta de Abajo_ in Cuba. We say\r\n     approximately, because the climate is a thing that can be\r\n     neither transplanted nor fully equaled by artificial means.\r\n     Havana seed propagated in the United States usually\r\n     degenerates very soon, even in the course of two or three\r\n     years. In other countries the experiment has been made to\r\n     acclimate foreign seeds, for instance, Havana, by crossing,\r\n     respectively changing the sexes and giving the male\r\n     influence now to the foreign, then to the home plant.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Connecticut valley the cultivation of Havana tobacco is\r\nincreasing year by year, and it promises to become the principal\r\nvariety cultivated. All of the leading qualities of Connecticut seed\r\nleaf, such as color, strength, and texture, are preserved, while the\r\nflavor is as fine as that of much that is imported. The plants\r\nselected for seed should be allowed to fully ripen, when the leaves\r\nmay be stripped from the stalks, that the capsules may receive all the\r\nstrength of the growing and maturing plants. The seed plants should be\r\nleft standing some six or eight weeks after the other plants have been\r\nharvested. If the nights are very cold and frosty, the top of the\r\nplants may be covered with a light cloth or paper to protect the seed\r\nbuds.\r\n\r\nWhen the capsules are of full size and brown in color, the top may be\r\nbroken off and hung up in a dry, cool place to cure, after which the\r\nseeds should be taken from the capsules. To do this, the end of the\r\nseed buds may be cut, when most of the seeds will fall out if the buds\r\nare fully ripe and dry. A southern planter gives the following account\r\nof the curing and management of seed plants:--\r\n\r\n     \"There are four classes of tobacco grown in Virginia and\r\n     North Carolina, viz.: Shipping, filling, smoking, and\r\n     wrapping; and it is important that planters desiring to\r\n     raise either one of these should choose the kind of seed\r\n     best adapted to each particular class. The Pryor makes the\r\n     heaviest, richest shipping, and can only be grown to\r\n     perfection on alluvial or heavily manured lands. The\r\n     Frederick or Maryland grows larger, but is not so rich and\r\n     waxy. The Oronoko is far preferable for fillers, smokers or\r\n     wrappers, being sweeter in flavor, finer in fibre and\r\n     texture, and more easily cured yellow. This is the kind best\r\n     adapted to our gray soils, giving best returns. The product\r\n     is not so large as on black or brown lands, yet with skill\r\n     in curing and management, the difference in product is more\r\n     than made up in quality.\r\n\r\n     \"The Oronoko, therefore, is the only kind suited to our gray\r\n     lands, and of this there are several varieties, the two\r\n     most in favor being the yellow Oronoko, and the Gooch or\r\n     Pride of Granville. The first is the kind that gave\r\n     character to the Caswell (North Carolina) yellow tobacco\r\n     more than twenty years ago, and is still preferred by a very\r\n     large number of planters who grow the finest yellow smokers\r\n     and wrappers. The latter is preferred in Granville county,\r\n     North Carolina, that produces the finest yellow tobacco\r\n     grown on this continent, or, perhaps, in the world. This\r\n     latter is clearly an Oronoko tobacco, very much resembling\r\n     the former, except that the leaf grows rather broader, and\r\n     by some is considered sweeter. These two kinds have been\r\n     grown with special reference to their adaptation to\r\n     producing the finest quality of wrappers, smokers, and\r\n     fillers. I am satisfied that the art of curing and\r\n     management have not only been very far advanced toward\r\n     scientific perfection, but that in perfecting the kinds of\r\n     seed grown much improvement has been made. For instance, in\r\n     the saving of seed, by adopting the plan of turning out the\r\n     forwardest plants growing in the best soil, and afterwards\r\n     observing to cut off all the heads of plants that ripen up\r\n     coarse, narrow or ill-shaped, or of a green color on the\r\n     hill, and saving only those heads that ripen yellow in color\r\n     and of a smooth and fine texture, much has been done to\r\n     improve the kind. Besides, the most important point in the\r\n     saving of tobacco seed is to cut off all the lateral shoots,\r\n     leaving only three crown shoots to perfect seed, thereby\r\n     securing larger pods and more perfect seed that always ripen\r\n     in good time, and are more reliable for seed beds and the\r\n     production of early, vigorous plants.\r\n\r\n     \"By following this mode of saving seed with special\r\n     reference to the growth of a particular class of tobacco, in\r\n     a few years the seed is not only greatly improved, but as\r\n     like begets like in the vegetable as in the animal kingdom,\r\n     becomes _sui generis_--the first of its species. The writer\r\n     can bear testimony to the above facts and desires that\r\n     others may profit thereby. Where any plant attains its\r\n     highest perfection, there is the place to secure the best\r\n     seed. The home of the tobacco plant is in Virginia and North\r\n     Carolina, and the growth and perfection of the kinds here\r\n     cultivated have reached a point unattained any where else.\r\n     The West and South would do well to procure their seed from\r\n     us, and then save and propagate after the instructions above\r\n     given.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND GROWTH.\r\n\r\nThe first account we find of raising a second crop of tobacco on the\r\noriginal field, is found in the early history of the Virginia colony;\r\nwho, not satisfied with the vast amount cultivated in the usual\r\nmanner, allowed a second growth to spring up from the parent stalk and\r\nthus obtained two crops from the same field in one year. The inferior\r\nquality of this growth at length caused its prohibition by law, as\r\ndescribed elsewhere in this work. Of late, however, this \"new\r\ndeparture\" in tobacco culture seems to have attracted some attention,\r\nparticularly in the Southern States, where numerous experiments have\r\nbeen made, and in some instances with complete success. In Mexico and\r\nalso in Louisiana and California, two and even three crops are\r\ngathered, thus adding to the profit of the grower, but hardly to the\r\nfertility of the tobacco fields. Whatever the fertility of the tobacco\r\nfield may be, or the care and attention given to the second crop by\r\nthe planter, it can not equal the first crop, and must from the nature\r\nof the case be quite inferior in size, texture, and flavor of leaf.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the varieties grown in the tropics will be much finer than\r\nthe varieties grown in a more temperate region. There are many reasons\r\nwhy a second and third crop can not be equal to the first in the\r\nqualities necessary for fine leafy tobacco. In the first place, the\r\nsoil will hardly produce a second crop of the size and texture of leaf\r\nthat will compare with the first growth: the leaves will be small and\r\nresemble the top leaves of the original plant rather than the large,\r\nwell-formed leaves of the center. Again, the season will hardly be\r\nfavorable (unless in the tropics), for a second growth, which has much\r\nto do with the quality of the leaf and which alone ensures large,\r\nwell-matured plants.\r\n\r\nIn the Connecticut valley but one crop can be grown of seed leaf, and\r\neven this when planted late is frequently overtaken by the \"frost\r\nking\" whose cold breath strikes a chill to the heart of the tobacco\r\ngrower who has been so unfortunate as to have but a few plants;\r\nespecially if his fields were \"set\" late in the season, or with\r\n\"spindling\" or \"long shank plants\" which come forward slowly and\r\nforbid all thought of a second growth, and sometimes give small hopes\r\nof even the first.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia and North Carolina the experiment has been tried of\r\ncovering the stumps or trunk of the plants with straw, followed by\r\nplowing on both sides of the rows, thereby covering them to a depth of\r\nseveral inches, in which condition they are left until spring, when\r\nthe covering is removed and the suckers or sprouts shoot forth and\r\ngrow with great rapidity. This novel experiment may succeed so far as\r\nthe growth and maturing of the plants is concerned, but will hardly\r\nadd to the reputation of \"Virginia's kingly plant\" or to the profit of\r\nthe growers, as the product must necessarily be small if the labor of\r\ntransplanting is avoided.\r\n\r\nBeyond all question, experiments with the growth and culture of the\r\ntobacco plant are among the most interesting and valuable, and afford\r\nthe planter the most pleasure and instruction of all similar trials\r\nwith the products of the vegetable kingdom. These experiments at once\r\ndevelop not only the rare qualities of the plant, but its various\r\nforms and habit of growth. They show as well as its adaptation to all\r\ncountries and climes, and the preservation of its qualities when grown\r\nin regions far remote from its native home. The florist finds no more\r\npleasure in the cultivation of the rarest exotic than the tobacco\r\nplanter in testing some new variety of tobacco, and noting its varied\r\nqualities and adaptation to his fields. By trying new varieties, some\r\nof the finest qualities of the plant have been developed, and many\r\nother of its excellences still further advanced. In the United States\r\nnumerous trials and experiments are constantly being made to still\r\nfurther perfect the various kinds already cultivated, as well as to\r\ntest other varieties and note their qualities and adaptation to the\r\nsoil. Already far advanced, the culture of the plant has not yet\r\nreached its highest point. The adaptation, soil, and fertilizers, are\r\nnow attracting much attention, and further study of these elements\r\npromises to \"bring out\" qualities of leaf hitherto overlooked, or at\r\nleast but partially developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTION, COMMERCE AND MANUFACTURE OF TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew comparatively of the users or even of the growers and\r\nmanufacturers of tobacco, are aware of the vast amount cultivated,\r\nmanufactured and used. Many suppose that its cultivation is confined\r\nto the United States and a few of the West India Islands, having no\r\nidea of the large quantities grown in Europe, Asia and Africa and the\r\nislands of the East India Archipelago. The Spaniards first began the\r\ncultivation of the plant on the Island of St. Domingo, afterwards\r\nextending it to Trinidad, the coast of South America, Mexico and the\r\nPhilippine Islands. In Portugal the cultivation commenced about\r\n1575-80, and continued some years. The Dutch a little later, began the\r\nproduction of tobacco in the East Indies, and in connection with the\r\nSpaniards and Portuguese were the only cultivators of tobacco until\r\nthe English commenced its growth in Virginia in 1616.\r\n\r\nThe first production in St. Domingo by the Spaniards was sometime\r\nprevious to 1535, and the island has continued to produce the great\r\nstaple until now. In Trinidad, however, a finer article was yielded,\r\nand its cultivation became more general here until the Spaniards began\r\nto plant it in Cuba in 1580. From the West Indies, South America and\r\nthe East Indies, Europe raised its supply of tobacco until the English\r\ncolonists commenced its cultivation in Virginia. The Spaniards and\r\nPortuguese at first controlled the trade in tobacco, and extorted most\r\nfabulous prices for it. As soon, however, as the Dutch and English\r\nbegan to cultivate it and receive it from their colonies the price\r\ngradually fell while the demand and consumption for it increased in\r\nproportion to the falling off of prices. From the island of Trinidad,\r\nEurope received its finest tobacco, and it continued to maintain its\r\nreputation as such until that variety known as Varinas tobacco from\r\nSouth America appeared; this variety attracted the attention of\r\nEuropean buyers and consumers, from its superiority in flavor and\r\nappearance which it has maintained for more than two hundred and fifty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn South America, the cultivation of tobacco took its rise in\r\nVenezuela, Brazil and Colombia. The varieties there produced had\r\nacquired an established reputation as early as 1600, together with St.\r\nLucia, Philippine and Margarita tobaccos. Early in the Seventeenth\r\nCentury, the Dutch became the great producers and importers into\r\nEurope, and the growths of their colonies continued to furnish a large\r\nproportion of the quantity used until English colonial tobacco made\r\nits appearance from Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe Plymouth and London companies from its first appearance in their\r\nmarkets, saw its vast importance as an article of agriculture and\r\ncommerce, and in twenty years after the first planting of it, began to\r\nreap rich returns from its sale and production. From this time\r\nforward, not only in America, but in Europe and Asia, its cultivation\r\nspread among other nations until at length it has become one of the\r\ngreat sources of revenue of almost every country, and a leading\r\nproduct of nearly every clime. The islands of St. Domingo, Trinidad,\r\nSt. Lucia and Martinique, do not produce as large quantities of\r\ntobacco as formerly; its cultivation in the West Indies being now\r\nconfined chiefly to the island of Cuba.\r\n\r\nThis island produces at the present time the finest cigar leaf of the\r\nWest Indies, which is considered by many as the best grown. The value\r\nof the annual product of Cuba is estimated at $20,000,000, nearly as\r\nmuch as that of the entire United States. Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela,\r\nand Paraguay, which are the tobacco-producing countries of South\r\nAmerica, furnish Europe with a large amount of leaf tobacco. In\r\nBrazil according to Scully it \"occupies the fourth place in the\r\nexports\" and is extensively cultivated in various parts of the empire.\r\nIn Venezuela it is an important article of agriculture, and the\r\nproduct is of fine quality and in good repute in Europe. Colombia has\r\nlong been noted for the amount and excellence of its tobacco; its\r\nvarious growths are fine in all respects and are among the finest\r\ncigar tobaccos grown. In Paraguay large quantities of excellent cigar\r\ntobacco are raised, much of which is used in various parts of South\r\nAmerica, the remainder going to Europe.\r\n\r\nAll of the tobacco of South America is unrivaled in flavor and is well\r\nadapted for the manufacture of cigars. In Mexico, tobacco is raised to\r\nsome extent, particularly in the Gulf States, where it develops\r\nremarkably and is of excellent quality both in texture and flavor.\r\nMexico is doubtless as well adapted for tobacco as any country in the\r\nworld, and if certain restrictions[83] were removed, its culture would\r\nincrease and the demand would cause its extensive production. In the\r\nCentral American States, some tobacco is cultivated, but not to the\r\nextent that is warranted by the demand or the adaptation of the soil.\r\nSome parts of the States, especially of Honduras, are well adapted for\r\nthe production of the very finest leaf. As it is but little is grown;\r\nhardly any being exported to Europe. America is the native home of the\r\ntobacco plant, and in the United States vast quantities are produced\r\nof all qualities and suited for all purposes.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 83: Tobacco is not allowed to pass from one\r\n              state into another without paying a certain duty.]\r\n\r\nIn New England from 20,000 to 30,000 acres are cultivated annually,\r\nestimated to yield on an average from 1500 to 1700 pounds to the acre.\r\nThe annual product in cases is from 50,000 to 170,000.[84] Of the\r\nMiddle States, New York and Pennsylvania furnish a large amount of\r\n\"seed leaf\" as it is called. In 1872 the latter state reported 38,010\r\ncases, mostly grown in three counties. A fine quality of tobacco is\r\nraised in the immediate vicinity of the old William Penn mansion, and\r\nis known to all dealers as superior leaf. In New York the crop is\r\nusually good, and along the valleys are found some excellent lands for\r\nits culture.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 84: The amount in 1872, was 172,000.]\r\n\r\nAs we go South, we reach the great tobacco-growing states, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, Kentucky, and others. Maryland has long been noted for its\r\ntobacco, and annually exports thousands of hogsheads to European\r\nmarkets. Virginia, as we have seen, is the oldest tobacco-producing\r\nstate in the Union, and still continues to raise thousands of acres of\r\nthe \"weed\" for home use and for export. In 1622, six years after its\r\ncultivation began, she produced 60,000 pounds of leaf tobacco. North\r\nCarolina also raises a fine article of smoking tobacco--of fine color\r\nand superior flavor. This state has long been noted for its superior\r\nleaf tobacco, and ever since the first settlement of the state has\r\nproduced large quantities of it. In 1753 100 hogsheads were exported,\r\nthe number constantly increasing until the present. In Georgia some\r\ntobacco is grown. Havana tobacco was first cultivated in this state by\r\nCol. McIntosh, and succeeded finely in some of the counties along the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nIn Florida, Havana tobacco is cultivated altogether. It differs\r\nsomewhat in flavor, however, so that it is called Florida tobacco, not\r\nbecause it is grown in that state, but because it is a little bitter,\r\nunlike that grown in Cuba. Kentucky is the great tobacco-producing\r\nstate of the Union. Two-fifths of the entire amount grown in the\r\ncountry comes from this state. In 1871 nearly 150,000 acres were\r\ndevoted to it in the state--producing 103,500,000 pounds of leaf\r\ntobacco. In Ohio and Missouri large quantities of tobacco are grown,\r\nthe former state furnishing both cutting and seed leaf tobaccos. The\r\nother Western states including Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, are\r\nengaged largely in its production, and furnish a good article of leaf.\r\n\r\nCalifornia for the last few years has given the culture of tobacco\r\nsome attention, and promises to become a great tobacco-producing\r\nstate. The United States have cultivated in some seasons 350,769 acres\r\nof tobacco, valued at $25,901,769. The average yield per acre is\r\ngreater in Connecticut than in any other state, being 1,700 pounds,\r\nwhile the smallest yield is in Georgia, 350 pounds. The average price\r\nper pound in Connecticut is 25 cts; in Kentucky 7 7-10 cts; in Georgia\r\n21 4-10 cts; in Ohio 9 1-10 cts; and in Pennsylvania 15 2-10 cts. In\r\n1855 there was exported from this country 150,213 hogsheads and 13,366\r\ncases of tobacco.\r\n\r\nIn Europe large quantities of tobacco are grown, excepting in England,\r\nSpain, and Portugal, where its culture is prohibited by law to benefit\r\nthe colonial growers of the plant. Austria is the great\r\ntobacco-producing country of Europe, and yields an annual product of\r\n45,000,000 pounds of tobacco; the leaf is of good quality, and is used\r\nfor cigars. France also raises about 30,000,000 pounds of tobacco\r\nbesides importing large quantities from the United States. In Russia\r\nthe annual tobacco crop is about 25,000,000 pounds. In Holland about\r\nas much tobacco is grown as in the state of Connecticut--6,000,000\r\npounds and the product is adapted for both cigar and snuff-leaf. Large\r\nquantities of tobacco are also imported, from 30,000,000 to 35,000,000\r\npounds. The tobacco factories in the country are stated to give\r\nemployment to one million operatives. Belgium produces considerable\r\ntobacco, about 3,000,000 pounds annually. Switzerland also raises from\r\n1,000,000 to 1,200,000 pounds of leaf. In Greece tobacco is an\r\nimportant product and the quality of leaf is very fine; her product\r\nhas been as high as 5,500,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn Asia tobacco has long been cultivated, and is one of the greatest\r\nproducts of the country. In both Asiatic and European Turkey the\r\nannual production is about 43,000,000 pounds. In China and Japan large\r\nquantities are grown, as well as in Persia, Thibet, and other portions\r\nof Asia. In the Philippine Islands its cultivation is carried on by\r\nthe Spaniards, as it has been for upwards of 250 years. Bowring says\r\nof its culture:--\r\n\r\n     \"The money value of the tobacco grown in the Philippines is\r\n     estimated at from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 of dollars, say\r\n     1,000,000l. sterling. Of this nearly one half is consumed in\r\n     the island, one quarter is exported in the form of cheroots\r\n     (which is the Oriental word for cigars), and the remainder\r\n     sent to Spain in leaves and cigars, being estimated as an\r\n     annual average contribution exceeding 800,000 dollars. The\r\n     sale of tobacco is a strict government monopoly, but the\r\n     impossibility of keeping up any sufficient machinery for the\r\n     protection of that monopoly is obvious even to the least\r\n     observant. The cultivator, who is bound to deliver all his\r\n     produce to the government, first takes care of himself and\r\n     his neighbors, and secures the best of his growth for his\r\n     own benefit. From functionaries able to obtain the best\r\n     which the government brings to market, a present is often\r\n     volunteered, which shows that they avail themselves of\r\n     something better than the best. And in discussing the matter\r\n     with the most intelligent of the empleados, they agreed that\r\n     the emancipation of the producer, the manufacturer and the\r\n     seller, and the establishment of a simple duty, would be\r\n     more productive to the revenue than the present vexatious\r\n     and inefficient system of privileges.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1810 the deliveries were 50,000 bales (of two arrobas),\r\n     of which Gapan furnished 47,000 and Cayayan 2,000. In 1841\r\n     Cayayan furnished 170,000 bales; Gapan, 84,000; and New\r\n     Biscay, 34,000. But the produce is enormously increased; and\r\n     so large is the native consumption, of which a large\r\n     proportion pays no duty, that it would not be easy to make\r\n     even an approximative estimate of the extent and value of\r\n     the whole tobacco harvest. Where the fiscal authorities are\r\n     so scattered and so corrupt;--where communications are so\r\n     imperfect and sometimes wholly interrupted; where large\r\n     tracts of territory are in the possession of tribes\r\n     unsubdued or in a state of imperfect subjection; where even\r\n     among the more civilized Indians the rights of property are\r\n     rudely defied, and civil authority imperfectly maintained;\r\n     where smuggling, though it may be attended with some risk,\r\n     is scarcely deemed by any body an offense, and the very\r\n     highest functionaries themselves smoke and offer to their\r\n     guests contraband cigars on account of their superior\r\n     quality,--it may well be supposed that lax laws, lax morals\r\n     and lax practices, harmonize with each other, and that such\r\n     a state of things as exists in the Philippines must be the\r\n     necessary, the inevitable result.\r\n\r\n     \"I am informed by the alcalde mayor of Cayayan that he sent\r\n     in 1858 to Manilla from that province tobacco for no less a\r\n     value than 2,000,000 dollars. The quality is the best of the\r\n     Philippines; it is all forwarded in leaf to the capital. The\r\n     tobacco used by the natives is not subject to the _estanco_,\r\n     and on my inquiring as to the cost of a cigar in Cagayan,\r\n     the answer was 'Casinada' (Almost nothing). They are not so\r\n     well rolled as those of the government, but undoubtedly the\r\n     raw material is of the very best.\"\r\n\r\nIn Sumatra some of the finest tobacco in the world is produced which\r\nhas an established reputation in European markets.\r\n\r\nIn Africa tobacco is grown to some extent in Egypt, Algiers and\r\nTripoli as well as by the natives of Central and South, Western\r\nAfrica. The French have paid particular attention to its culture in\r\nAlgiers and have succeeded in producing tobacco of good flavor and\r\ntexture. In Australia the plant does remarkably well and promises to\r\nbecome as celebrated as that of other portions or islands of the East\r\nIndia Archipelago.\r\n\r\nIt readily appears from the extensive cultivation of tobacco that it\r\ncan hardly fail of becoming an important article of commerce. The\r\nSpaniards and Portuguese found it to be an important source of\r\nrevenue, and from South America and the West Indies exported large\r\nquantities to Europe. As soon as it began to be cultivated in Virginia\r\nits commercial value began to be apparent and attracted many\r\nnavigators who came thither to barter for tobacco and furs, and other\r\narticles of inferior value. Most of the tobacco exported from the\r\nUnited States is shipped to Europe and from there is reshipped to Asia\r\nand Africa. Of foreign tobacco but little finds its way to this\r\ncountry, the duties[85] preventing many varieties of excellent quality\r\ncompeting with our domestic tobacco. Cuba, St. Domingo and Manilla\r\ntobacco are the only varieties that are imported from other countries.\r\nWest India tobacco, more particularly that of Cuba--is shipped to all\r\nparts of the world, especially to Spain, Great Britain, Russia, France\r\nand the United States.\r\n\r\n              [Footnote 85: Thirty-five cents a pound, gold.]\r\n\r\nThe tobacco of South America is exported almost entirely to Europe.\r\nEngland receives a large quantity of South American tobacco as well as\r\nSpain and Portugal. The varieties cultivated in Asia and Africa for\r\nexport are shipped mostly to Europe. Great Britain, Spain, France and\r\nGermany are the great tobacco-consuming countries of the world, or\r\nat least of Europe. In Great Britain, Spain and Portugal, no tobacco\r\nis cultivated, and these countries are therefore dependent upon their\r\ncolonies for a supply of the great product. The commerce in the plant\r\nis extensive and reaches to every part of the globe. No nation, state,\r\nor empire now ignores the revenue to be derived from its import or\r\nculture, and many a government receives more from this plant alone\r\nthan from any other source.\r\n\r\nWhile some nations prohibit its culture at home, their colonies are\r\nallowed to grow it, and thus the article and the revenue are both\r\nsecured. But while the production of the plant and the commerce\r\ndepending on it are extensive, they are not more so than the\r\nmanufacture of the leaf into the various preparations for use. The\r\ngovernment work-shops of Seville and Manilla, as well as those of\r\nHavana and Paris are of enormous proportions and employ thousands of\r\noperatives in the manufacture of cigars and cigarettes. In this\r\ncountry and in England, large quantities of cigars are made both from\r\ndomestic and foreign tobaccos.\r\n\r\nIn South America also many are made, but more for home use than for\r\nexport. Cutting leaf is largely manufactured in this country,\r\nespecially near the great leaf growing sections. Most of this is used\r\nhere, the leaf for manufacture abroad being exported in hogsheads for\r\ncutting in any form desired. Snuff leaf is exported largely from this\r\ncountry to Great Britain and France, where are the largest\r\nmanufacturers of snuff in the world. At the present time the demand\r\nseems greater for cutting than for cigar leaf. The growths of the West\r\nIndies and South America furnish a large quantity of fine tobacco for\r\ncigars, but comparatively little for cutting purposes. European\r\ntobaccos are adapted for both cutting and for cigars, and are used\r\nextensively at home though not considered equal to American varieties,\r\nbeing of a milder flavor. As an article of production and commerce,\r\ntobacco must be considered as important as any of the great products\r\nor staples, since the demand is constant and continually increasing.\r\nYear by year its cultivation extends into new sections, where it\r\nbecomes a permanent production if the soil and climate prove\r\ncongenial. From time to time new varieties become known, and are\r\ncultivated in various countries with success varying according to the\r\nsoil and climate and the knowledge of the planter. Nowhere is the\r\nplant receiving more attention both in its cultivation and\r\nmanufacture, than in this country. The varieties grown in the tropics\r\nhave been tested with more or less success, and bid fair ere long to\r\nbecome the leading kinds in some sections. But not alone in this\r\ncountry is the plant attracting the attention of the great commercial\r\nnations. In Europe and Asia as well as in Africa, its production is\r\nassuming the large proportions due to its vast importance to\r\nAgriculture and Commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: End.]",
