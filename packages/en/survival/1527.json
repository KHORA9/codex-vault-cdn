An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.\r\n\r\n[Enter DUKE, CURIO, and other LORDS; MUSICIANS attending.]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIf music be the food of love, play on;\r\nGive me excess of it, that, surfeiting,\r\nThe appetite may sicken and so die.\r\nThat strain again! It had a dying fall;\r\nO, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound\r\nThat breathes upon a bank of violets,\r\nStealing and giving odour! Enough; no more;\r\n'T is not so sweet now as it was before.\r\nO spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou!\r\nThat, notwithstanding thy capacity\r\nReceiveth as the sea, nought enters there,\r\nOf what validity and pitch soe'er,\r\nBut falls into abatement and low price,\r\nEven in a minute! so full of shapes is fancy\r\nThat it alone is high fantastical.\r\n\r\nCURIO.\r\nWill you go hunt, my lord?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat, Curio?\r\n\r\nCURIO.\r\nThe hart.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhy, so I do, the noblest that I have.\r\nO, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,\r\nMethought she purg'd the air of pestilence!\r\nThat instant was I turn'd into a hart;\r\nAnd my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,\r\nE'er since pursue me.\r\n\r\n[Enter VALENTINE.]\r\n\r\nHow now! what news from her?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nSo please my lord, I might not be admitted,\r\nBut from her handmaid do return this answer:\r\nThe element itself, till seven years' heat,\r\nShall not behold her face at ample view;\r\nBut, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk\r\nAnd water once a day her chamber round\r\nWith eye-offending brine; all this to season\r\nA brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh\r\nAnd lasting in her sad remembrance.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, she that hath a heart of that fine frame\r\nTo pay this debt of love but to a brother,\r\nHow will she love when the rich golden shaft\r\nHath kill'd the flock of all affections else\r\nThat live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,\r\nThese sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd--\r\nHer sweet perfections -- with one self king!\r\nAway before me to sweet beds of flow'rs;\r\nLove-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bow'rs.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The sea-coast.\r\n\r\n[Enter VIOLA, a CAPTAIN, and SAILORS.]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhat country, friends, is this?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nThis is Illyria, lady.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd what should I do in Illyria?\r\nMy brother he is in Elysium.\r\nPerchance he is not drown'd. What think you, sailors?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nIt is perchance that you yourself were sav'd.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nO my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nTrue, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,\r\nAssure yourself, after our ship did split,\r\nWhen you, and those poor number sav'd with you,\r\nHung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,\r\nMost provident in peril, bind himself,\r\nCourage and hope both teaching him the practice,\r\nTo a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea;\r\nWhere, like Arion on the dolphin's back,\r\nI saw him hold acquaintance with the waves\r\nSo long as I could see.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nFor saying so, there's gold:\r\nMine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,\r\nWhereto thy speech serves for authority,\r\nThe like of him. Know'st thou this country?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nAy, madam, well; for I was bred and born\r\nNot three hours' travel from this very place.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWho governs here?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nA noble duke, in nature as in name.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhat is his name?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nOrsino.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nOrsino! I have heard my father name him;\r\nHe was a bachelor then.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nAnd so is now, or was so very late;\r\nFor but a month ago I went from hence,\r\nAnd then 'twas fresh in murmur--as, you know,\r\nWhat great ones do the less will prattle of--\r\nThat he did seek the love of fair Olivia.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhat's she?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nA virtuous maid, the daughter of a count\r\nThat died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her\r\nIn the protection of his son, her brother,\r\nWho shortly also died; for whose dear love,\r\nThey say, she hath abjur'd the company\r\nAnd sight of men.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nO that I serv'd that lady,\r\nAnd might not be delivered to the world,\r\nTill I had made mine own occasion mellow,\r\nWhat my estate is!\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nThat were hard to compass,\r\nBecause she will admit no kind of suit,\r\nNo, not the duke's.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThere is a fair behaviour in thee, captain;\r\nAnd though that nature with a beauteous wall\r\nDoth oft close in pollution, yet of thee\r\nI will believe thou hast a mind that suits\r\nWith this thy fair and outward character.\r\nI prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,\r\nConceal me what I am, and be my aid\r\nFor such disguise as haply shall become\r\nThe form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:\r\nThou shalt present me as an eunuch to him;\r\nIt may be worth thy pains, for I can sing\r\nAnd speak to him in many sorts of music\r\nThat will allow me very worth his service.\r\nWhat else may hap, to time I will commit;\r\nOnly shape thou silence to my wit.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nBe you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be;\r\nWhen my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI thank thee; lead me on.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA'S house.\r\n\r\n[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother\r\nthus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nBy my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights; your\r\ncousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, let her except before excepted.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of\r\norder.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nConfine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes\r\nare good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they\r\nbe not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThat quaffing and drinking will undo you. I heard my lady talk of\r\nit yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in one\r\nnight here to be her wooer.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWho, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, he.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHe's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWhat's that to th' purpose?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, he has three thousand ducats a year.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats; he's a very\r\nfool and a prodigal.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nFie, that you'll say so! he plays o' th' viol-de-gamboys, and\r\nspeaks three or four languages word for word without book, and\r\nhath all the good gifts of nature.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nHe hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he's a fool,\r\nhe's a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a\r\ncoward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought\r\namong the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nBy this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors that say so of\r\nhim. Who are they?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThey that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWith drinking healths to my niece. I'll drink to her as long as\r\nthere is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria: he's a\r\ncoward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece\r\ntill his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish-top. What, wench!\r\nCastiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.\r\n\r\n[Enter SIR ANDREW AGUECHEEK.]\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nSir Toby Belch; how now, Sir Toby Belch!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSweet Sir Andrew!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBless you, fair shrew.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAnd you too, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAccost, Sir Andrew, accost.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhat's that?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMy niece's chambermaid.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nGood Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMy name is Mary, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nGood Mistress Mary Accost,--\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nYou mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board her, woo her,\r\nassail her.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBy my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that\r\nthe meaning of 'accost'?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nFare you well, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAn thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw\r\nsword again.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword\r\nagain. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSir, I have not you by th' hand.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMarry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNow, sir, 'thought is free.' I pray you, bring your hand to th'\r\nbuttery-bar and let it drink.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nIt's dry, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhy, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry.\r\nBut what's your jest?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nA dry jest, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAre you full of them?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends; marry, now I let go\r\nyour hand, I am barren.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO knight, thou lack'st a cup of canary; when did I see thee so\r\nput down?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNever in your life, I think; unless you see canary put me down.\r\nMethinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an\r\nordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I\r\nbelieve that does harm to my wit.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNo question.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride home to-morrow,\r\nSir Toby.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPourquoi, my dear knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhat is 'pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had bestow'd that\r\ntime in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and\r\nbear-baiting! O, had I but follow'd the arts!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThen hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhy, would that have mended my hair?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPast question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBut it becomes me well enough, does't not?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nExcellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFaith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be\r\nseen; or, if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me: the\r\ncount himself here hard by wooes her.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nShe'll none o' th' count. She'll not match above her degree,\r\nneither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear't. Tut,\r\nthere's life in't, man.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' th' strangest mind i'\r\nth' world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nArt thou good at these kickshawses, knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAs any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my\r\nbetters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFaith, I can cut a caper.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd I can cut the mutton to't.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in\r\nIllyria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWherefore are these things hid? wherefore have these gifts a\r\ncurtain before 'em? are they like to take dust, like Mistress\r\nMall's picture? why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and\r\ncome home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig. What dost\r\nthou mean? is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the\r\nexcellent constitution of thy leg, it was form'd under the star\r\nof a galliard.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, 't is strong, and it does indifferent well in flame-colour'd\r\nstock. Shall we set about some revels?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nTaurus! That's sides and heart.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNo, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the caper. Ha! higher!\r\nha, ha, excellent!\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.\r\n\r\nThe DUKE'S palace.\r\n\r\n[Enter VALENTINE, and VIOLA in man's attire.]\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nIf the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are\r\nlike to be much advanc'd. He hath known you but three days, and\r\nalready you are no stranger.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nYou either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in\r\nquestion the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in\r\nhis favours?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nNo, believe me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI thank you. Here comes the Count.\r\n\r\n[Enter DUKE, CURIO, and ATTENDANTS.]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWho saw Cesario, ho?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nOn your attendance, my lord; here.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nStand you awhile aloof. Cesario,\r\nThou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd\r\nTo thee the book even of my secret soul.\r\nTherefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;\r\nBe not denied access, stand at her doors,\r\nAnd tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow\r\nTill thou have audience.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nSure, my noble lord,\r\nIf she be so abandon'd to her sorrow\r\nAs it is spoke, she never will admit me.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBe clamorous and leap all civil bounds\r\nRather than make unprofited return.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nSay I do speak with her, my lord, what then?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, then unfold the passion of my love,\r\nSurprise her with discourse of my dear faith!\r\nIt shall become thee well to act my woes;\r\nShe will attend it better in thy youth\r\nThan in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI think not so, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nDear lad, believe it;\r\nFor they shall yet belie thy happy years,\r\nThat say thou art a man: Diana's lip\r\nIs not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe\r\nIs as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,\r\nAnd all is semblative a woman's part.\r\nI know thy constellation is right apt\r\nFor this affair. Some four or five attend him;\r\nAll, if you will; for I myself am best\r\nWhen least in company.  Prosper well in this,\r\nAnd thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,\r\nTo call his fortunes thine.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI'll do my best\r\nTo woo your lady,-- [Aside] yet, a barful strife!\r\nWhoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE V.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA'S house.\r\n\r\n[Enter MARIA and CLOWN.]\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my\r\nlips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse. My lady\r\nwill hang thee for thy absence.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nLet her hang me. He that is well hang'd in this world needs to\r\nfear no colours.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMake that good.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHe shall see none to fear.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nA good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was born,\r\nof 'I fear no colours.'\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhere, good Mistress Mary?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nIn the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWell, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are\r\nfools, let them use their talents.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nYet you will be hang'd for being so long absent; or to be turn'd\r\naway, is not that as good as a hanging to you?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMany a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and, for turning\r\naway, let summer bear it out.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nYou are resolute, then?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNot so, neither; but I am resolv'd on two points.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThat, if one break, the other will hold; or, if both break, your\r\ngaskins fall.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nApt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby would\r\nleave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any\r\nin Illyria.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nPeace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady; make your\r\nexcuse wisely, you were best.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWit, and 't be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits\r\nthat think they have thee do very oft prove fools; and I, that am\r\nsure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man: for what says\r\nQuinapalus? 'Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.'\r\n\r\n[Enter LADY OLIVIA with MALVOLIO.]\r\n\r\nGod bless thee, lady!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nTake the fool away.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nDo you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGo to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you: besides, you grow\r\ndishonest.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTwo faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend; for,\r\ngive the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry: bid the\r\ndishonest man mend himself; if he mend, he is no longer\r\ndishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing\r\nthat's mended is but patch'd; virtue that transgresses is but\r\npatch'd with sin; and sin that amends is but patch'd with virtue.\r\nIf that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,\r\nwhat remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so\r\nbeauty's a flower. The lady bade take away the fool; therefore, I\r\nsay again, take her away.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSir, I bade them take away you.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMisprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non facit\r\nmonachum; that's as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain.\r\nGood madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCan you do it?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nDexteriously, good madonna.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nMake your proof.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI must catechize you for it, madonna; good my mouse of virtue,\r\nanswer me.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWell, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGood madonna, why mourn'st thou?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGood fool, for my brother's death.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI think his soul is in hell, madonna.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI know his soul is in heaven, fool.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThe more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul being in\r\nheaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nYes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity,\r\nthat decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGod send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing\r\nyour folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox; but he will\r\nnot pass his word for twopence that you are no fool.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow say you to that, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; I\r\nsaw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no\r\nmore brain than a stone. Look you now, he's out of\r\nhis guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him,\r\nhe is gagg'd. I protest, I take these wise men, that crow so at\r\nthese set kind of fools, no better than the fools' zanies.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a\r\ndistemper'd appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free\r\ndisposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem\r\ncannon bullets. There is no slander in an allow'd fool, though he\r\ndo nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man,\r\nthough he do nothing but reprove.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNow Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak'st well of\r\nfools!\r\n\r\n[Re-enter MARIA.]\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMadam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to\r\nspeak with you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nFrom the Count Orsino, is it?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nI know not, madam; 't is a fair young man, and well attended.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWho of my people hold him in delay?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSir Toby, madam, your kinsman.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nFetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman: fie on\r\nhim! [Exit MARIA.] Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the\r\ncount, I am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.\r\n[Exit MALVOLIO.] Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old,\r\nand people dislike it.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a\r\nfool; whose skull Jove cram with brains! for-- here he comes--\r\n\r\n[Enter SIR TOBY.]\r\n\r\none of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nBy mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA gentleman.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nA gentleman! what gentleman?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n'T is a gentleman here -- a plague o' these pickle-herring! How\r\nnow, sot!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGood Sir Toby!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAy, marry, what is he?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLet him be the devil, and he will, I care not; give me faith, say\r\nI. Well, it's all one.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat's a drunken man like, fool?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nLike a drown'd man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat\r\nmakes him a fool; the second mads him; and a third drowns him.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGo thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz; for he's\r\nin the third degree of drink, he's drown'd: go look after him.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHe is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the\r\nmadman.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n[Re-enter MALVOLIO.]\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMadam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told\r\nhim you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much,  and\r\ntherefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep; he\r\nseems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to\r\nspeak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? he's fortified\r\nagainst any denial.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nTell him he shall not speak with me.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHas been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your door like a\r\nsheriff's post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he'll speak\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat kind o' man is he?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nWhy, of mankind.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat manner of man?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nOf very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nOf what personage and years is he?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nNot yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a\r\nsquash is before 't is a peascod, or a codling when 't is almost\r\nan apple: 't is with him in standing water, between boy and man.\r\nHe is very well-favour'd, and he speaks very shrewishly; one\r\nwould think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nLet him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGentlewoman, my lady calls.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n[Re-enter MARIA.]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGive me my veil; come, throw it o'er my face;\r\nWe'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.\r\n\r\n[Enter VIOLA, and ATTENDANTS.]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThe honourable lady of the house, which is she?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSpeak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMost radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,-- I pray you,\r\ntell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her: I\r\nwould be loth to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is\r\nexcellently well penn'd, I have taken great pains to con it. Good\r\nbeauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to\r\nthe least sinister usage.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhence came you, sir?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI can say little more than I have studied, and that question's\r\nout of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you\r\nbe the lady of the house, that I may proceed in\r\nmy speech.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAre you a comedian?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNo, my profound heart; and yet, by the very fangs of malice I\r\nswear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIf I do not usurp myself, I am.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMost certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is\r\nyours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my\r\ncommission. I will on with my speech in your praise, and then\r\nshow you the heart of my message.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCome to what is important in't; I forgive you the praise.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAlas, I took great pains to study it, and 't is poetical.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIt is the more like to be feign'd; I pray you, keep it in. I\r\nheard you were saucy at my gates, and allow'd your approach\r\nrather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be\r\ngone; if you have reason, be brief; 't is not that time of moon\r\nwith me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWill you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNo, good swabber; I am to hull here a little longer. Some\r\nmollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind; I am\r\na messenger.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy\r\nof it is so fearful. Speak your office.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIt alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no\r\ntaxation of homage: I hold the olive in my hand; my words are as\r\nfull of peace as matter.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThe rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my\r\nentertainment. What I am, and what I would, are as secret as\r\nmaidenhead; to your ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGive us the place alone; we will hear this divinity.\r\n[Exeunt MARIA and ATTENDANTS.] Now, sir, what is your text?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMost sweet lady,--\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nA comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies\r\nyour text?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIn Orsino's bosom.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIn his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nTo answer by the method, in the first of his heart.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nGood madam, let me see your face.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHave you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face?\r\nYou are now out of your text; but we will draw the curtain, and\r\nshow you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was this\r\npresent; is 't not well done?\r\n[Unveiling.]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nExcellently done, if God did all.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\n'T is in grain, sir; 't will endure wind and weather.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n'T is beauty truly blent whose red and white\r\nNature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on.\r\nLady, you are the cruell'st she alive,\r\nIf you will lead these graces to the grave,\r\nAnd leave the world no copy.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers\r\nschedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried, and every\r\nparticle and utensil labell'd to my will: as, item, two lips,\r\nindifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to them; item,\r\none neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise\r\nme?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI see you what you are, you are too proud;\r\nBut, if you were the devil, you are fair.\r\nMy lord and master loves you; O, such love\r\nCould be but recompens'd, though you were crown'd\r\nThe nonpareil of beauty!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow does he love me?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWith adorations, fertile tears,\r\nWith groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYour lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:\r\nYet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,\r\nOf great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;\r\nIn voices well divulg'd, free, learn'd, and valiant;\r\nAnd, in dimension and the shape of nature,\r\nA gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;\r\nHe might have took his answer long ago.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIf I did love you in my master's flame,\r\nWith such a suffering, such a deadly life,\r\nIn your denial I would find no sense;\r\nI would not understand it.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, what would you?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMake me a willow cabin at your gate,\r\nAnd call upon my soul within the house;\r\nWrite loyal cantons of contemned love,\r\nAnd sing them loud even in the dead of night;\r\nHalloo your name to the reverberate hills,\r\nAnd make the babbling gossip of the air\r\nCry out, 'Olivia!' O, you should not rest\r\nBetween the elements of air and earth,\r\nBut you should pity me!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYou might do much. What is your parentage?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAbove my fortunes, yet my state is well;\r\nI am a gentleman.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGet you to your lord;\r\nI cannot love him: let him send no more;\r\nUnless, perchance, you come to me again,\r\nTo tell me how he takes it. Fare you well;\r\nI thank you for your pains. Spend this for me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:\r\nMy master, not myself, lacks recompense.\r\nLove make his heart of flint that you shall love;\r\nAnd let your fervour, like my master's, be\r\nPlac'd in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\n'What is your parentage?'\r\n'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well;\r\nI am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;\r\nThy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit,\r\nDo give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast! Soft, soft!\r\nUnless the master were the man. How now!\r\nEven so quickly may one catch the plague?\r\nMethinks I feel this youth's perfections\r\nWith an invisible and subtle stealth\r\nTo creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.\r\nWhat ho, Malvolio!\r\n\r\n[Re-enter MALVOLIO.]\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHere, madam, at your service.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nRun after that same peevish messenger,\r\nThe county's man: he left this ring behind him,\r\nWould I or not; tell him I'll none of it.\r\nDesire him not to flatter with his lord,\r\nNor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him.\r\nIf that the youth will come this way to-morrow,\r\nI'll give him reasons for't. Hie thee, Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMadam, I will.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI do I know not what; and fear to find\r\nMine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.\r\nFate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;\r\nWhat is decreed must be, and be this so!\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II.\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The sea-coast\r\n\r\n[Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN.]\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWill you stay no longer; nor will you not that I go with you?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nBy your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me: the\r\nmalignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I\r\nshall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone: it\r\nwere a bad recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLet me know of you whither you are bound.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nNo, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I\r\nperceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not\r\nextort from me what I am willing to\r\nkeep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express\r\nmyself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,\r\nwhich I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of\r\nMessaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him\r\nmyself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had\r\nbeen pleas'd, would we had so ended! but you, sir, alter'd that;\r\nfor some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was\r\nmy sister drown'd.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAlas the day!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nA lady, sir, though it was said she much resembl'd me, was yet of\r\nmany accounted beautiful; but, though I could not, with such\r\nestimable wonder, over-far believe that, yet thus far I will\r\nboldly publish her: she bore mind that envy could not but call\r\nfair. She is drown'd already, sir, with salt water, though I seem\r\nto drown her remembrance again with more.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nPardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nO good Antonio, forgive me your trouble!\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIf you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nIf you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom\r\nyou have recover'd, desire it not. Fare ye well at once; my bosom\r\nis full of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my\r\nmother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell\r\ntales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court; farewell.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThe gentleness of all the gods go with thee!\r\nI have many enemies in Orsino's court,\r\nElse would I very shortly see thee there.\r\nBut, come what may, I do adore thee so\r\nThat danger shall seem sport, and I will go.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.  A street\r\n\r\n[Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following.]\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nWere you not ev'n now with the Countess Olivia?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nEven now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arriv'd but\r\nhither.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nShe returns this ring to you, sir; you might have sav'd me my\r\npains, to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that\r\nyou should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none\r\nof him; and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to come\r\nagain in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord's taking\r\nof this. Receive it so.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nShe took the ring of me; I'll none of it.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nCome, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is it\r\nshould be so return'd. If it be worth stooping for, there it lies\r\nin your eye; if not, be it his that finds it.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI left no ring with her; what means this lady?\r\nFortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!\r\nShe made good view of me; indeed, so much\r\nThat, methought, her eyes had lost her tongue,\r\nFor she did speak in starts distractedly.\r\nShe loves me, sure: the cunning of her passion\r\nInvites me in this churlish messenger.\r\nNone of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.\r\nI am the man. If it be so, as 't is,\r\nPoor lady, she were better love a dream.\r\nDisguise, I see thou art a wickedness,\r\nWherein the pregnant enemy does much.\r\nHow easy is it for the proper-false\r\nIn women's waxen hearts to set their forms!\r\nAlas, our frailty is the cause, not we!\r\nFor such as we are made of, such we be.\r\nHow will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;\r\nAnd I, poor monster, fond as much on him,\r\nAnd she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.\r\nWhat will become of this? As I am man,\r\nMy state is desperate for my master's love;\r\nAs I am woman-- now, alas the day!--\r\nWhat thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!\r\nO time, thou must untangle this, not I;\r\nIt is too hard a knot for me to untie!\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.  OLIVIA'S house\r\n\r\n[Enter SIR TOBY and SIR ANDREW.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nApproach, Sir Andrew: not to be a-bed after midnight is to be up\r\nbetimes; and 'diluculo surgere,' thou know'st--\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNay, by my troth, I know not; but I know, to be up late is to be\r\nup late.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA false conclusion; I hate it as an unfill'd can. To be up after\r\nmidnight, and to go to bed then, is early; so that to go to bed\r\nafter midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our life\r\nconsist of the four elements?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFaith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of eating and\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThou 'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink. Marian, I\r\nsay! a stoup of wine!\r\n\r\n[Enter CLOWN.]\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nHere comes the fool, i' faith.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHow now, my hearts! did you never see the picture of 'We Three'?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWelcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBy my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than\r\nforty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing,\r\nas the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling\r\nlast night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians\r\npassing the equinoctial of Queubus; 't was very good, i' faith. I\r\nsent thee sixpence for thy leman; hadst it?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose is no\r\nwhipstock; my lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no\r\nbottle-ale houses.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nExcellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now,\r\na song.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThere's a testril of me too.  If one knight give a--\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWould you have a love-song, or a song of good life?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA love-song, a love-song.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, ay; I care not for good life.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[Sings.]\r\n   O mistress mine, where are you roaming?\r\n   O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,\r\n   That can sing both high and low:\r\n   Trip no further, pretty sweeting;\r\n   Journeys end in lovers meeting,\r\n   Every wise man's son doth know.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nExcellent good, i' faith.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGood, good.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[Sings.]\r\n   What is love? 'T is not hereafter;\r\n   Present mirth hath present laughter;\r\n   What's to come is still unsure.\r\n   In delay there lies no plenty,\r\n   Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,\r\n   Youth's a stuff will not endure.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nA mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA contagious breath.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nVery sweet and contagious, i' faith.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make\r\nthe welkin dance indeed? shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch\r\nthat will draw three souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd you love me, let's do 't; I am dog at a catch.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBy'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMost certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be constrain'd in\r\n't to call thee knave, knight.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n'Tis not the first time I have constrain'd one to call me knave.\r\nBegin, fool: it begins, 'Hold thy peace.'\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI shall never begin, if I hold my peace.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nGood, i' faith! Come, begin.\r\n[Catch sung.]\r\n\r\n[Enter MARIA.]\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWhat a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not call'd\r\nup her steward Malvolio, and bid him turn you out of  doors,\r\nnever trust me.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMy lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's a\r\nPeg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.'\r\nAm not I consanguineous? am I not of her blood? Tilly-vally;\r\nlady! [Sings.]  'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBeshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, he does well enough if he be dispos'd, and so do I too; he\r\ndoes it with a better grace, but I do it more natural.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[Sings]\r\n'O, the twelfth day of December,'--\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nFor the love o' God, peace!\r\n\r\n[Enter MALVOLIO.]\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMy masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have you no wit,\r\nmanners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of\r\nnight? Do ye make an alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak\r\nout your coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse of\r\nvoice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time, in you?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWe did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you\r\nthat, though she harbours you as her kins-man, she's nothing\r\nallied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your\r\nmisdemeanours, you are welcome to the house; if not, and it would\r\nplease you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, good Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nIs 't even so?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n'But I will never die.'\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nSir Toby, there you lie.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nThis is much credit to you.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n'Shall I bid him go?'\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n'What and if you do?'\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n'O, no, no, no, no, you dare not.'\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nOut o' tune, sir? ye lie. Art any more than a steward? Dost thou\r\nthink, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes\r\nand ale?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nYes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' th' mouth too.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTh 'rt i' th' right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs.  A\r\nstoup of wine, Maria!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMistress Mary, if you priz'd my lady's favour at any thing more\r\nthan contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule.\r\nShe shall know of it, by this hand.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nGo shake your ears.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n'T were as good a deed as to drink when a man's a-hungry, to\r\nchallenge him the field, and then to break promise with him and\r\nmake a fool of him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nDo't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge; or I'll deliver thy\r\nindignation to him by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSweet Sir Toby, be patient for to-night; since the youth of the\r\ncount's was to-day with my lady, she is much out of quiet.  For\r\nMonsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him; if I do not gull him\r\ninto a nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not think I\r\nhave wit enough to lie straight in my bed: I know I can do it.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPossess us, possess us; tell us something of him.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMarry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nO, if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason, dear knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI have no exquisite reason for 't, but I have reason good enough.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThe devil a puritan that he is, or any thing constantly, but a\r\ntime-pleaser; an affection'd ass, that cons state without book,\r\nand utters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so\r\ncramm'd, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is his grounds\r\nof faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in\r\nhim will my revenge find notable cause to work.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat wilt thou do?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nI will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love; wherein, by\r\nthe colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his\r\ngait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and\r\ncomplexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated. I\r\ncan write very like my lady, your niece; on a forgotten matter we\r\ncan hardly make distinction of our hands.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nExcellent! I smell a device.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI have 't in my nose too.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHe shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they\r\ncome from my niece, and that she's in love with him.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMy purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd your horse now would make him an ass.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAss, I doubt not.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nO, 't will be admirable!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSport royal, I warrant you; I know my physic will work with him.\r\nI will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he\r\nshall find the letter; observe his construction of it. For\r\nthis night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGood night, Penthesilea.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBefore me, she's a good wench.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nShe's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me. What o' that?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI was ador'd once too.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLet's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nIf I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSend for money, knight; if thou hast her not i' th' end, call me\r\ncut.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nIf I do not, never trust me; take it how you will.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, come, I'll go burn some sack; 't is too late to go to bed\r\nnow. Come, knight; come, knight.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.\r\n\r\nThe DUKE'S palace\r\n\r\n[Enter DUKE, VIOLA, CURIO, and others.]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGive me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.\r\nNow, good Cesario, but that piece of song,\r\nThat old and antique song we heard last night;\r\nMethought it did relieve my passion much,\r\nMore than light airs and recollected terms\r\nOf these most brisk and giddy-paced times.\r\nCome, but one verse.\r\n\r\nCURIO.\r\nHe is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWho was it?\r\n\r\nCURIO.\r\nFeste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady Olivia's father\r\ntook much delight in. He is about the house.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGo seek him out, and play the tune the while.\r\n\r\n[Exit CURIO. Music plays]\r\n\r\nCome hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,\r\nIn the sweet pangs of it remember me;\r\nFor such as I am all true lovers are,\r\nUnstaid and skittish in all motions else,\r\nSave in the constant image of the creature\r\nThat is belov'd.  How dost thou like this tune?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIt gives a very echo to the seat\r\nWhere Love is thron'd.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThou dost speak masterly:\r\nMy life upon 't, young though thou art, thine eye\r\nHath stay'd upon some favour that it loves;\r\nHath it not, boy?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nA little, by your favour.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat kind of woman is 't?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nOf your complexion.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nShe is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAbout your years, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nToo old, by heaven! let still the woman take\r\nAn elder than herself; so wears she to him,\r\nSo sways she level in her husband's heart:\r\nFor, boy, however we do praise ourselves,\r\nOur fancies are more giddy and unfirm,\r\nMore longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,\r\nThan women's are.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI think it well, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThen let thy love be younger than thyself,\r\nOr thy affection cannot hold the bent;\r\nFor women are as roses, whose fair flower,\r\nBeing once display'd, doth fall that very hour.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd so they are: alas, that they are so;\r\nTo die, even when they to perfection grow!\r\n\r\n[Re-enter CURIO and CLOWN.]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, fellow, come, the song we had last night.\r\nMark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;\r\nThe spinsters and the knitters in the sun,\r\nAnd the free maids that weave their thread with bones,\r\nDo use to chant it: it is silly sooth,\r\nAnd dallies with the innocence of love,\r\nLike the old age.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAre you ready, sir?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAy; prithee, sing.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n             SONG\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n    Come away, come away, death,\r\n    And in sad cypress let me be laid;\r\n    Fly away, fly away, breath;\r\n    I am slain by a fair cruel maid.\r\n    My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,\r\n    O, prepare it!\r\n    My part of death, no one so true\r\n    Did share it.\r\n\r\n    Not a flower, not a flower sweet,\r\n    On my black coffin let there be strown;\r\n    Not a friend, not a friend greet\r\n    My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown.\r\n    A thousand thousand sighs to save,\r\n    Lay me, O, where\r\n    Sad true lover never find my grave,\r\n    To weep there!\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThere 's for thy pains.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI 'll pay thy pleasure, then.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTruly, sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGive me now leave to leave thee.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNow the melancholy god protect thee; and the tailor make thy\r\ndoublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I\r\nwould have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business\r\nmight be every thing, and their intent every where; for that 's\r\nit that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLet all the rest give place.\r\n\r\n[CURIO and ATTENDANTS retire.]\r\n\r\nOnce more, Cesario,\r\nGet thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.\r\nTell her my love, more noble than the world,\r\nPrizes not quantity of dirty lands;\r\nThe parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,\r\nTell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;\r\nBut 't is that miracle and queen of gems\r\nThat Nature pranks her in attracts my soul.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nBut if she cannot love you, sir?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI cannot be so answer'd.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nSooth, but you must.\r\nSay that some lady, as perhaps there is,\r\nHath for your love as great a pang of heart\r\nAs you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;\r\nYou tell her so; must she not, then, be answer'd?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThere is no woman's sides\r\nCan bide the beating of so strong a passion\r\nAs love doth give my heart; no woman's heart\r\nSo big to hold so much; they lack retention.\r\nAlas, their love may be call'd appetite--\r\nNo motion of the liver, but the palate--\r\nThat suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;\r\nBut mine is all as hungry as the sea,\r\nAnd can digest as much. Make no compare\r\nBetween that love a woman can bear me\r\nAnd that I owe Olivia.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAy, but I know--\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat dost thou know?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nToo well what love women to men may owe;\r\nIn faith, they are as true of heart as we.\r\nMy father had a daughter lov'd a man,\r\nAs it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,\r\nI should your lordship.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAnd what's her history?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nA blank, my lord. She never told her love,\r\nBut let concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,\r\nFeed on her damask cheek; she pin'd in thought,\r\nAnd with a green and yellow melancholy,\r\nShe sat, like patience on a monument,\r\nSmiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?\r\nWe men may say more, swear more; but indeed\r\nOur shows are more than will; for still we prove\r\nMuch in our vows, but little in our love.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBut died thy sister of her love, my boy?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI am all the daughters of my father's house,\r\nAnd all the brothers too; and yet I know not.\r\nSir, shall I to this lady?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAy, that's the theme.\r\nTo her in haste; give her this jewel; say,\r\nMy love can give no place, bide no denay.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE V.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA'S garden.\r\n\r\n[Enter SIR TOBY, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome thy ways, Signior Fabian.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be\r\nboil'd to death with melancholy.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally\r\nsheep-biter come by some notable shame?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nI would exult, man; you know he brought me out o' favour with my\r\nlady about a bear-baiting here.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo anger him, we'll have the bear again; and we will fool him\r\nblack and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd we do not, it is pity of our lives.\r\n\r\n[Enter MARIA.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHere comes the little villain.\r\nHow now, my metal of India!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nGet ye all three into the box-tree; Malvolio's coming down this\r\nwalk. He has been yonder i' the sun practising behaviour to his\r\nown shadow this half hour. Observe him, for the love of mockery;\r\nfor I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him.\r\nClose, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there [throws down a\r\nletter], for here comes the trout that must be caught with\r\ntickling.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n[Enter MALVOLIO.]\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'T is but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told me she did\r\naffect me; and I have heard herself come thus near, that, should\r\nshe fancy, it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses\r\nme with a more exalted respect than any one else that follows\r\nher. What should I think on 't?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHere 's an overweening rogue!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him; how he\r\njets under his advanc'd plumes!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPeace, I say.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nTo be Count Malvolio!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAh, rogue!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nPistol him, pistol him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPeace, peace!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nThere is example for't: the lady of the Strachy married the\r\nyeoman of the wardrobe.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFie on him, Jezebel!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace! now he's deeply in; look how imagination blows him.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHaving been three months married to her, sitting in my state,--\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nCalling my officers about me, in my branch'd velvet gown; having\r\ncome from a day-bed, where I have left Olivia sleeping,--\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nFire and brimstone!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace, peace!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAnd then to have the humour of state; and, after a demure travel\r\nof regard, telling them I know my place, as I would they should\r\ndo theirs, to ask for my kinsman Toby,--\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nBolts and shackles!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace, peace, peace! now, now.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSeven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him: I\r\nfrown the while; and perchance wind up my watch, or play with\r\nmy-- some rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me,--\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nShall this fellow live?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThough our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an\r\naustere regard of control,--\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips, then?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSaying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece,\r\ngive me this prerogative of speech,'--\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat, what?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'You must amend your drunkenness.'--\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nOut, scab!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish\r\nknight,'--\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThat's me, I warrant you.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'One Sir Andrew.'\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI knew 't was I; for many do call me fool.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nWhat employment have we here?\r\n[Taking up the letter.]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNow is the woodcock near the gin.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO, peace! and the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nBy my life, this is my lady's hand: these be her very C's, her\r\nU's, and her T's; and thus makes she her great P's. It is, in\r\ncontempt of question, her hand.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nHer C's, her U's, and her T's; why that?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n[Reads]\r\nTo the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes:-- her very\r\nphrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! and the impressure her\r\nLucrece, with which she uses to seal; 't is my lady. To whom\r\nshould this be?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThis wins him, liver and all.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n[Reads]\r\n            Jove knows I love;\r\n            But who?\r\n            Lips, do not move;\r\n            No man must know.\r\n\r\n'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers alter'd!\r\n'No man must know.' If this should be thee, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMarry, hang thee, brock!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n[Reads]\r\n     I may command where I adore;\r\n     But silence, like a Lucrece knife,\r\n     With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:\r\n     M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nA fustian riddle!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nExcellent wench, say I.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let me see, let\r\nme see, let me see.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nWhat dish o' poison has she dress'd him!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd with what wing the staniel checks at it!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command me; I serve\r\nher; she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity;\r\nthere is no obstruction in this: and the end,-- what should that\r\nalphabetical position portend? if I could make that resemble\r\nsomething in me!-- Softly! M, O, A, I,--\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO, ay, make up that; he is now at a cold scent.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nSowter will cry upon 't for all this, though it be as rank as a\r\nfox.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nM,-- Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nDid not I say he would work it out? the cur is excellent at\r\nfaults.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nM,-- but then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that suffers\r\nunder probation: A should follow, but O does.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nAnd O shall end, I hope.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAy, or I 'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAnd then I comes behind.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nAy, an you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction\r\nat your heels than fortunes before you.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nM, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former; and yet, to\r\ncrush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these\r\nletters are in my name. Soft! here follows prose.\r\n-- [Reads] 'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am\r\nabove thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some are born great,\r\nsome achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em.\r\nThy Fates open their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace\r\nthem; and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy\r\nhumble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly\r\nwith servants; let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put\r\nthyself into the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee that\r\nsighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and\r\nwish'd to see thee ever cross-garter'd. I say, remember. Go to,\r\nthou art made, if thou desir'st to be so; if not, let me see thee\r\na steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch\r\nFortune's fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with\r\nthee,\r\nTHE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.\r\n\r\nDaylight and champain discovers not more; this is open. I will be\r\nproud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I\r\nwill wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very\r\nman. I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for\r\nevery reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did\r\ncommend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being\r\ncross-garter'd; and in this she manifests herself to my love, and\r\nwith a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her\r\nliking. I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout,\r\nin yellow stockings, and cross-garter'd, even with the swiftness\r\nof putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a\r\npostscript.\r\n\r\n[Reads] Thou canst not choose but know who I am.

To see this age! A sentence is but a cheveril\r\nglove to a good wit; how quickly the wrong side may be turn'd\r\noutward!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with words may\r\nquickly make them wanton.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhy, man?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhy, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that word might\r\nmake my sister wanton. But, indeed, words are very rascals since\r\nbonds disgrac'd them.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThy reason, man?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTroth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and words are\r\ngrown so false, I am loth to prove reason with them.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI warrant thou art a merry fellow, and car'st for nothing.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNot so, sir; I do care for something; but in my conscience, sir,\r\nI do not care for you: if that be to care for nothing, sir, I\r\nwould it would make you invisible.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nArt not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she will keep no\r\nfool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands as\r\npilchards are to herrings, the husband's the bigger. I am,\r\nindeed, not her fool, but her corrupter of words.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nFoolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun, it shines\r\neverywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft\r\nwith your master as with my mistress. I think I saw your\r\nwisdom there.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNay, and thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.   Hold,\r\nthere's expenses for thee.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNow Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nBy my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for one; [Aside]\r\nthough I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWould not a pair of these have bred, sir?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nYes, being kept together and put to use.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida\r\nto this Troilus.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI understand you, sir; 't is well begg'd.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThe matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar.\r\nCressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will construe to\r\nthem whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of\r\nmy welkin,-- I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThis fellow is wise enough to play the fool;\r\nAnd to do that well craves a kind of wit:\r\nHe must observe their mood on whom he jests,\r\nThe quality of persons, and the time;\r\nAnd, like the haggard, check at every feather\r\nThat comes before his eye. This is a practice\r\nAs full of labour as a wise man's art:\r\nFor folly that he wisely shows is fit;\r\nBut wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.\r\n\r\n[Enter SIR TOBY and SIR ANDREW.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSave you, gentleman!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd you, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nDieu vous garde, monsieur.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nEt vous aussi; votre serviteur.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWill you encounter the house? my niece is desirous you should\r\nenter, if your trade be to her.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the list of my\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTaste your legs, sir; put them to motion.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you\r\nmean by bidding me taste my legs.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI mean, to go, sir, to enter.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI will answer you with gait and entrance. But we are prevented.\r\n\r\n[Enter OLIVIA and MARIA.]\r\n\r\nMost excellent accomplish'd lady, the heavens rain odours on you!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThat youth's a rare courtier. 'Rain odours'; well.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and\r\nvouchsafed ear.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n'Odours,' 'pregnant,' and 'vouchsafed': I'll get 'em all three\r\nall ready.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nLet the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.\r\n[Exeunt SIR TOBY, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA.] Give me your hand, sir.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy duty, madam, and most humble service.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat is your name?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nCesario is your servant's name, fair princess.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nMy servant, sir! 'T was never merry world\r\nSince lowly feigning was call'd compliment;\r\nYou're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd he is yours, and his must needs be yours;\r\nYour servant's servant is your servant, madam.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nFor him, I think not on him; for his thoughts,\r\nWould they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMadam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts\r\nOn his behalf.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, by your leave, I pray you,\r\nI bade you never speak again of him;\r\nBut, would you undertake another suit,\r\nI had rather hear you to solicit that\r\nThan music from the spheres.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nDear lady,--\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGive me leave, beseech you. I did send,\r\nAfter the last enchantment you did here,\r\nA ring in chase of you; so did I abuse\r\nMyself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.\r\nUnder your hard construction must I sit,\r\nTo force that on you, in a shameful cunning,\r\nWhich you knew none of yours; what might you think?\r\nHave you not set mine honour at the stake,\r\nAnd baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts\r\nThat tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving\r\nEnough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom,\r\nHides my heart. So, let me hear you speak.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI pity you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nThat's a degree to love.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNo, not a grize; for 't is a vulgar proof,\r\nThat very oft we pity enemies.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, then methinks 't is time to smile again.\r\nO world, how apt the poor are to be proud!\r\nIf one should be a prey, how much the better\r\nTo fall before the lion than the wolf!    [Clock strikes]\r\nThe clock upbraids me with the waste of time.\r\nBe not afraid, good youth, I will not have you;\r\nAnd yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,\r\nYour wife is like to reap a proper man.\r\nThere lies your way, due west.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThen westward-ho! Grace and good disposition\r\nAttend your ladyship!\r\nYou'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nStay:\r\nI prithee, tell me what thou think'st of me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThat you do think you are not what you are.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIf I think so, I think the same of you.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThen think you right; I am not what I am.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI would you were as I would have you be!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWould it be better, madam, than I am?\r\nI wish it might, for now I am your fool.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful\r\nIn the contempt and anger of his lip!\r\nA murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon\r\nThan love that would seem hid; love's night is noon.\r\nCesario, by the roses of the spring,\r\nBy maidhood, honour, truth, and every thing,\r\nI love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,\r\nNor wit nor reason can my passion hide.\r\nDo not extort thy reasons from this clause,\r\nFor that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;\r\nBut rather reason thus with reason fetter,\r\nLove sought is good, but given unsought is better.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nBy innocence I swear, and by my youth,\r\nI have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,\r\nAnd that no woman has; nor never none\r\nShall mistress be of it, save I alone.\r\nAnd so adieu, good madam; never more\r\nWill I my master's tears to you deplore.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move\r\nThat heart, which now abhors, to like his love.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA'S house\r\n\r\n[Enter SIR TOBY, SIR ANDREW and FABIAN.]\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNo, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nYou must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMarry, I saw your niece do more favours to the count's\r\nserving-man than ever she bestow'd upon me; I saw 't i' th'\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nDid she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAs plain as I see you now.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThis was a great argument of love in her toward you.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nI will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nShe did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate\r\nyou, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart,\r\nand brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her;\r\nand with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should\r\nhave bang'd the youth into dumbness. This was look'd for at your\r\nhand, and this was balk'd: the double gilt of this opportunity\r\nyou let time wash off, and you are now sail'd into the north of\r\nmy lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on\r\nDutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable\r\nattempt either of valour or policy.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy I hate: I\r\nhad as lief be a Brownist as a politician.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour.\r\nChallenge me the count's youth to fight with him; hurt him in\r\neleven places: my niece shall take note of it; and assure\r\nthyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in\r\nman's commendation with woman than report of valour.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThere is no way but this, Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWill either of you bear me a challenge to him?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGo, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief; it is no\r\nmatter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention; taunt\r\nhim with the license of ink; if thou thou'st him some\r\nthrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in\r\nthy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the\r\nbed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it. Let there be\r\ngall enough in thy ink; though thou write with a goose-pen, no\r\nmatter: about it.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhere shall I find you?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWe'll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.\r\n\r\n[Exit SIR ANDREW.]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThis is a dear manakin to you, Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nWe shall have a rare letter from him; but you'll not deliver 't?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNever trust me, then; and by all means stir on the youth to an\r\nanswer. I think oxen and wain-ropes cannot hale them together.\r\nFor Andrew, if he were open'd, and you find so much blood in his\r\nliver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of th'\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nAnd his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage\r\nof cruelty.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLook where the youngest wren of nine comes.\r\n\r\n[Enter MARIA.]\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nIf you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into\r\nstitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turn'd heathen, a very\r\nrenegado; for there is no Christian, that means to be sav'd by\r\nbelieving rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages of\r\ngrossness. He's in yellow stockings.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd cross-garter'd?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMost villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i' th'\r\nchurch. I have dogg'd him, like his murderer. He does obey every\r\npoint of the letter that I dropp'd to betray him; he does smile\r\nhis face into more lines than is in the new map, with the\r\naugmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such a thing as 't\r\nis.  I  can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady\r\nwill strike him; if she do, he'll smile, and take 't for a great\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, bring us, bring us where he is.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\n\r\nA street\r\n\r\n[Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO.]\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI would not by my will have troubled you;\r\nBut, since you make your pleasure of your pains,\r\nI will no further chide you.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI could not stay behind you: my desire,\r\nMore sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;\r\nAnd not all love to see you, though so much\r\nAs might have drawn one to a longer voyage,\r\nBut jealousy what might befall your travel,\r\nBeing skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,\r\nUnguided and unfriended, often prove\r\nRough and unhospitable. My willing love,\r\nThe rather by these arguments of fear,\r\nSet forth in your pursuit.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nMy kind Antonio,\r\nI can no other answer make but thanks,\r\nAnd thanks, and ever thanks; too oft good turns\r\nAre shuffl'd off with such uncurrent pay:\r\nBut, were my worth as is my conscience firm,\r\nYou should find better dealing. What's to do?\r\nShall we go see the reliques of this town?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTo-morrow, sir; best first go see your lodging.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI am not weary, and 't is long to night;\r\nI pray you, let us satisfy our eyes\r\nWith the memorials and the things of fame\r\nThat do renown this city.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWould you'd pardon me;\r\nI do not without danger walk these streets.\r\nOnce, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys\r\nI did some service; of such note indeed,\r\nThat, were I ta'en here, it would scarce be answer'd.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nBelike you slew great number of his people.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTh' offence is not of such a bloody nature;\r\nAlbeit the quality of the time and quarrel\r\nMight well have given us bloody argument.\r\nIt might have since been answer'd in repaying\r\nWhat we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,\r\nMost of our city did: only myself stood out;\r\nFor which, if I be lapsed in this place,\r\nI shall pay dear.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nDo not then walk too open.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIt doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.\r\nIn the south suburbs, at the Elephant,\r\nIs best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet,\r\nWhiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge\r\nWith viewing of the town; there shall you have me.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhy I your purse?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHaply your eye shall light upon some toy\r\nYou have desire to purchase; and your store,\r\nI think, is not for idle markets, sir.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI'll be your purse-bearer, and leave you\r\nFor an hour.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTo th' Elephant.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI do remember.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA'S garden\r\n\r\n[Enter OLIVIA and MARIA.]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI have sent after him; he says he'll come.\r\nHow shall I feast him? what bestow of him?\r\nFor youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.\r\nI speak too loud.\r\nWhere's Malvolio? He is sad and civil,\r\nAnd suits well for a servant with my fortunes.\r\nWhere is Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nHe's coming, madam, but in very strange manner.\r\nHe is, sure, possess'd, madam.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, what's the matter? does he rave?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNo, madam, he does nothing but smile. Your ladyship were best to\r\nhave some guard about you, if he come; for, sure, the man is\r\ntainted in's wits.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGo call him hither.\r\n\r\n[Exit MARIA.]\r\n\r\nI am as mad as he,\r\nIf sad and merry madness equal be.\r\n\r\n[Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO.]\r\n\r\nHow now Malvolio!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSweet lady, ho, ho.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSmil'st thou?\r\nI sent for thee upon a sad occasion.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSad, lady! I could be sad; this does make some obstruction in the\r\nblood, this cross-gartering; but what of that? if it please the\r\neye of one, it is with me as the very true\r\nsonnet is, 'Please one, and please all.'\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nNot black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to\r\nhis hands, and commands shall be executed; I think we do know the\r\nsweet Roman hand.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nTo bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGod comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so\r\noft?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nHow do you, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAt your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWhy appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'Be not afraid of greatness'; 'twas well writ.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat mean'st thou by that, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'Some are born great,'--\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'Some achieve greatness,'--\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat say'st thou?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHeaven restore thee!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,'--\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nThy yellow stockings!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'And wish'd to see thee cross-garter'd.'\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCross-garter'd!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'Go to, thou art made, if thou desir'st to be so;'--\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAm I made?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, this is very midsummer madness.\r\n\r\n[Enter SERVANT.]\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMadam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is return'd: I\r\ncould hardly entreat him back: he attends your ladyship's\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI'll come to him. [Exit SERVANT] Good Maria, let this fellow be\r\nlook'd to. Where's my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a\r\nspecial care of him; I would not have him miscarry for the half\r\nof my dowry.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA.]\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nO, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than Sir Toby to\r\nlook to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him\r\non purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me\r\nto that in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she; 'be\r\nopposite with kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang\r\nwith arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of\r\nsingularity'; and, consequently, sets down the manner how; as, a\r\nsad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of\r\nsome sir of note, and so forth. I have lim'd her; but it is\r\nJove's doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away\r\nnow, 'Let this fellow be look'd to'; fellow! not Malvolio, nor\r\nafter my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing adheres together,\r\nthat no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle,\r\nno incredulous or unsafe circumstance,-- what can be said?\r\nNothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of\r\nmy hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be\r\nthank'd.\r\n\r\n[Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY and FABIAN.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhich way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of\r\nhell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I\r\n'll speak to him.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nHere he is, here he is. How is 't with you, sir? how is 't with\r\nyou, man?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGo off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private; go off.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nLo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not I tell you?\r\nSir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAh, ha! does she so?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGo to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently with him: let me\r\nalone. How do you, Malvolio? how is 't with you? What, man! defy\r\nthe devil; consider, he 's an enemy to mankind.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nDo you know what you say?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nLa you, and you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart!\r\nPray God, he be not bewitch'd! My lady would not lose him for\r\nmore than I 'll say.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHow now, mistress!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nO Lord!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPrithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do you not see you\r\nmove him? let me alone with him.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNo way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is rough, and\r\nwill not be roughly us'd.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAy, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 't is not for gravity to play\r\nat cherry-pit with Satan. Hang him, foul collier!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nGet him to say his prayers; good Sir Toby, get him to pray.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMy prayers, minx!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNo, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGo, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow things. I am not of\r\nyour element; you shall know more hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nIs 't possible?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nIf this were play'd upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an\r\nimprobable fiction.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHis very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nWhy, we shall make him mad indeed.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThe house will be the quieter.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, we 'll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is\r\nalready in the belief that he 's mad: we may carry it thus, for\r\nour pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of\r\nbreath, prompt us to have mercy on him; at which time we will\r\nbring the device to the bar, and crown thee for a finder of\r\nmadmen. But see, but see.\r\n\r\n[Enter SIR ANDREW.]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nMore matter for a May morning.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nHere 's the challenge, read it; I warrant there 's vinegar and\r\npepper in 't.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nIs 't so saucy?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, is 't, I warrant him; do but read.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGive me. [Reads] Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a\r\nscurvy fellow.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGood and valiant.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[Reads] Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call\r\nthee so, for I will show thee no reason for 't.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nA good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[Reads] Thou com'st to the lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses\r\nthee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter\r\nI challenge thee for.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nVery brief, and to exceeding good sense-- less.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[Reads] I will waylay thee going home; where if it be thy chance\r\nto kill me,--\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGood.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[Reads.] Thou kill 'st me like a rogue and a villain.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nStill you keep o' th' windy side of the law; good.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[Reads] Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon one of our souls!\r\nHe may have mercy upon mine; but my hope is better, and so look\r\nto thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,\r\nANDREW AGUECHEEK.\r\nIf this letter move him not, his legs cannot; I'll give 't him.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nYou may have very fit occasion for 't; he is now in some commerce\r\nwith my lady, and will by and by depart.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGo, Sir Andrew; scout me for him at the corner of the orchard,\r\nlike a bum-baily. So soon as ever thou see'st him, draw; and as\r\nthou drawest, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft, that a\r\nterrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twang'd off,\r\ngives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have\r\nearn'd him. Away!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNay, let me alone for swearing.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNow will not I deliver his letter; for the behaviour of the young\r\ngentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his\r\nemployment between his lord and my niece confirms no less:\r\ntherefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant,  will breed\r\nno terror in the youth; he will find it comes from a clodpole.\r\nBut, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth; set upon\r\nAguecheek a notable report of valour; and drive the gentleman, as\r\nI know his youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous\r\nopinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so\r\nfright them both, that they will kill one another by the look,\r\nlike cockatrices.\r\n\r\n[Re-enter OLIVIA with VIOLA.]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nHere he comes with your niece; give them way till he take leave,\r\nand presently after him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt SIR TOBY, FABIAN, and MARIA.]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI have said too much unto a heart of stone,\r\nAnd laid mine honour too unchary out.\r\nThere 's something in me that reproves my fault;\r\nBut such a headstrong potent fault it is,\r\nThat it but mocks reproof.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWith the same haviour that your passion bears,\r\nGoes on my master's grief.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHere, wear this jewel for me, 't is my picture:\r\nRefuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you:\r\nAnd I beseech you come again to-morrow.\r\nWhat shall you ask of me that I 'll deny,\r\nThat honour sav'd may upon asking give?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNothing but this,-- your true love for my master.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow with mine honour may I give him that\r\nWhich I have given to you?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI will acquit you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWell, come again to-morrow; fare thee well.\r\nA fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n[Re-enter SIR TOBY and FABIAN.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGentleman, God save thee!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd you, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThat defence thou hast, betake thee to 't. Of what nature the\r\nwrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter,\r\nfull of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the\r\norchard-end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation; for\r\nthy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nYou mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me: my\r\nremembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done\r\nto any man.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nYou'll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold\r\nyour life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your\r\nopposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath can\r\nfurnish man withal.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI pray you, sir, what is he?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHe is knight, dubb'd with unhatch'd rapier and on carpet\r\nconsideration; but he is a devil in private brawl: souls and\r\nbodies hath he divorc'd three; and his incensement at this moment\r\nis so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of\r\ndeath and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give 't or take 't.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the\r\nlady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put\r\nquarrels purposely on others, to taste their valour; belike this\r\nis a man of that quirk.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent\r\ninjury. Therefore get you on and give him his desire.  Back you\r\nshall not to the house, unless you undertake that with\r\nme which with as much safety you might answer him. Therefore on,\r\nor strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that 's\r\ncertain, or forswear to wear iron about you.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThis is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this\r\ncourteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him\r\nis; it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my\r\nreturn.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nPray you, sir, do you know of this matter?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nI know the knight is incens'd against you, even to a mortal\r\narbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI beseech you, what manner of man is he?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as\r\nyou are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is,\r\nindeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that\r\nyou could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you\r\nwalk towards him? I will make your peace with him, if I can.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI shall be much bound to you for 't. I am one that had rather go\r\nwith sir priest than sir knight; I care not who knows so much of\r\nmy mettle.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n[Re-enter SIR TOBY, with SIR ANDREW.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a firago. I had\r\na pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the\r\nstuck in with such a mortal motion that it is\r\ninevitable; and, on the answer, he pays you as surely as your\r\nfeet hit the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to\r\nthe Sophy.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nPox on 't, I'll not meddle with him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAy, but he will not now be pacified; Fabian can scarce hold him\r\nyonder.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nPlague on 't; and I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in\r\nfence, I'd have seen him damn'd ere I 'd have challeng'd him. Let\r\nhim let the matter slip, and I 'll give him my horse, gray\r\nCapilet.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI 'll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on 't; this\r\nshall end without the perdition of souls. [Aside] Marry, I 'll\r\nride your horse as well as I ride you.\r\n\r\n[Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA.]\r\n\r\n[To FABIAN] I have his horse to take up the quarrel; I have\r\npersuaded him the youth 's a devil.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nHe is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and looks pale, as\r\nif a bear were at his heels.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[To VIOLA] There 's no remedy, sir: he will fight with you for 's\r\noath sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel,\r\nand he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of: therefore\r\ndraw, for the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not\r\nhurt you.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n[Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell\r\nthem how much I lack of a man.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGive ground, if you see him furious.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman will, for his\r\nhonour's sake, have one bout with you; he cannot by the duello\r\navoid it; but he has promis'd me, as he is a gentleman and a\r\nsoldier, he will not hurt you. Come on; to 't.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nPray God, he keep his oath!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI do assure you 't is against my will. [They draw]\r\n\r\n[Enter ANTONIO.]\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nPut up your sword. If this young gentleman\r\nHave done offence, I take the fault on me;\r\nIf you offend him, I for him defy you.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nYou, sir! why, what are you?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nOne, sir, that for his love dares yet do more\r\nThan you have heard him brag to you he will.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.\r\n[They draw]\r\n\r\n[Enter OFFICERS.]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI 'll be with you anon.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nPray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMarry, will I, sir; and, for that I promis'd you, I 'll be as\r\ngood as my word; he will bear you easily, and reins well.\r\n\r\n1 OFFICER.\r\nThis is the man; do thy office.\r\n\r\n2 OFFICER.\r\nAntonio, I arrest thee at the suit\r\nOf Count Orsino.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nYou do mistake me, sir.\r\n\r\n1 OFFICER.\r\nNo, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,\r\nThough now you have no sea-cap on your head.\r\nTake him away; he knows I know him well.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI must obey. [To VIOLA] This comes with seeking you:\r\nBut there's no remedy; I shall answer it.\r\nWhat will you do, now my necessity\r\nMakes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me\r\nMuch more for what I cannot do for you\r\nThan what befalls myself. You stand amaz'd;\r\nBut be of comfort.\r\n\r\n2 OFFICER.\r\nCome, sir, away.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI must entreat of you some of that money.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhat money, sir?\r\nFor the fair kindness you have show'd me here,\r\nAnd, part, being prompted by your present trouble,\r\nOut of my lean and low ability\r\nI 'll lend you something. My having is not much;\r\nI 'll make division of my present with you:\r\nHold, there 's half my coffer.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWill you deny me now?\r\nIs 't possible that my deserts to you\r\nCan lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,\r\nLest that it make me so unsound a man\r\nAs to upbraid you with those kindnesses\r\nThat I have done for you.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI know of none;\r\nNor know I you by voice or any feature.\r\nI hate ingratitude more in a man\r\nThan lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,\r\nOr any taint of vice whose strong corruption\r\nInhabits our frail blood.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nO heavens themselves!\r\n\r\n2 OFFICER.\r\nCome, sir, I pray you, go.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLet me speak a little. This youth that you see here\r\nI snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,\r\nReliev'd him with such sanctity of love,\r\nAnd to his image, which methought did promise\r\nMost venerable worth, did I devotion.\r\n\r\n1 OFFICER.\r\nWhat 's that to us? The time goes by; away!\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nBut O how vile an idol proves this god!\r\nThou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.\r\nIn nature there 's no blemish but the mind;\r\nNone can be call'd deform'd but the unkind.\r\nVirtue is beauty; but the beauteous evil\r\nAre empty trunks, o'erflourish'd by the devil.\r\n\r\n1 OFFICER.\r\nThe man grows mad; away with him!\r\nCome, come, sir.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLead me on.\r\n\r\n[Exit with OFFICERS.]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMethinks his words do from such passion fly\r\nThat he believes himself; so do not I.\r\nProve true, imagination, O, prove true,\r\nThat I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome hither, knight; come hither, Fabian; we 'll whisper o'er a\r\ncouplet or two of most sage saws.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nHe nam'd Sebastian. I my brother know\r\nYet living in my glass; even such and so\r\nIn favour was my brother; and he went\r\nStill in this fashion, colour, ornament,\r\nFor him I imitate. O, if it prove,\r\nTempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare: his\r\ndishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and\r\ndenying him; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nA coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nDo; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd I do not,--\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nCome, let's see the event.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI dare lay any money 't will be nothing yet.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT IV.\r\n\r\nSCENE I.\r\n\r\nBefore OLIVIA'S house.\r\n\r\n[Enter SEBASTIAN and CLOWN.]\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWill you make me believe that I am not sent for you?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nGo to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow;\r\nLet me be clear of thee.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWell held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor I am not sent\r\nto you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your name\r\nis not Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing\r\nthat is so is so.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else;\r\nThou know'st not me.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nVent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and now\r\napplies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great\r\nlubber, the world, will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird\r\nthy strangeness, and tell me what I shall vent to my lady; shall\r\nI vent to her that thou art coming?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.\r\nThere 's money for thee; if you tarry longer,\r\nI shall give worse payment.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBy my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give\r\nfools money get themselves a good report after fourteen years'\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\n[Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY, and FABIAN.]\r\n\r\nSR ANDREW.\r\nNow, sir, have I met you again? there 's for you.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhy, there 's for thee, and there, and there.\r\nAre all the people mad?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHold, sir, or I 'll throw your dagger o'er the house.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThis will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of your\r\ncoats for twopence.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome on, sir; hold.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNay, let him alone: I 'll go another way to work with him; I 'll\r\nhave an action of battery against him, if there be any law in\r\nIllyria: though I struck him first, yet it 's no matter for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nLet go thy hand.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up\r\nyour iron: you are well flesh'd; come on.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now?\r\nIf thou dar'st tempt me further, draw thy sword.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two of this\r\nmalapert blood from you.\r\n\r\n[Enter OLIVIA.]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHold, Toby; on thy life, I charge thee, hold!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMadam!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWill it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,\r\nFit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,\r\nWhere manners ne'er were preach'd! Out of my sight!\r\nBe not offended, dear Cesario.\r\nRudesby, be gone!\r\n\r\n[Exeunt SIR TOBY, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN.]\r\n\r\nI prithee, gentle friend,\r\nLet thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway\r\nIn this uncivil and unjust extent\r\nAgainst thy peace. Go with me to my house;\r\nAnd hear thou there how many fruitless pranks\r\nThis ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby\r\nMayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go;\r\nDo not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,\r\nHe started one poor heart of mine in thee.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhat relish is in this? how runs the stream?\r\nOr I am mad, or else this is a dream.\r\nLet fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;\r\nIf it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nNay, come, I prithee. Would thou'dst be rul'd by me!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nMadam, I will.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, say so, and so be!\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA'S house.\r\n\r\n[Enter MARIA and CLOWN.]\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard; make him believe\r\nthou art Sir Topas the curate: do it quickly; I 'll call Sir Toby\r\nthe whilst.\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWell, I 'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in 't; and I\r\nwould I were the first that ever dissembl'd in such a gown. I am\r\nnot tall enough to become the function well, nor lean enough to\r\nbe thought a good student; but to be said an honest man and a\r\ngood housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a\r\ngreat scholar. The competitors enter.\r\n\r\n[Enter SIR TOBY and MARIA.]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nJove bless thee, master parson!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of Prague, that\r\nnever saw pen and ink, very wittily said to niece of King\r\nGorboduc, 'That that is is'; so I, being master parson, am master\r\nparson; for, what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo him, Sir Topas.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat, ho, I say, peace in this prison!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThe knave counterfeits well; a good knave.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n[Within] Who calls there?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nSir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nOut, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man! talkest thou\r\nnothing but of ladies?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWell said, master parson.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Topas, never was man thus wrong'd; good Sir Topas, do not\r\nthink I am mad: they have laid me here in hideous darkness.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nFie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms;\r\nfor I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself\r\nwith courtesy. Say'st thou that house is dark?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAs hell, Sir Topas.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhy, it hath bay-windows transparent as barricadoes, and the\r\nclerestories toward the south north are as lustrous as ebony; and\r\nyet complainest thou of obstruction?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI am not mad, Sir Topas; I say to you, this house is dark.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMadman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness but ignorance;\r\nin which thou art more puzzl'd than the Egyptians in their fog.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were\r\nas dark as hell; and I say, there was never man thus abus'd. I am\r\nno more mad than you are; make the trial of it in any constant\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nThat the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat think'st thou of his opinion?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nFare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness; thou shalt hold\r\nth' opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear\r\nto kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy\r\ngrandam. Fare thee well.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Topas, Sir Topas!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMy most exquisite Sir Topas!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNay, I am for all waters.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown; he sees\r\nthee not.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou find'st\r\nhim; I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be\r\nconveniently deliver'd, I would he were, for I am now so far in\r\noffence with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this\r\nsport to the upshot.

Malvolio,\r\nMalvolio, thy wits the heavens restore! endeavour thyself to\r\nsleep, and leave thy vain bibble babble.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Topas!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMaintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I, sir? not I, sir.\r\nGod be wi' you, good Sir Topas!  Marry, amen. I will, sir, I\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nFool, fool, fool, I say!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAlas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am shent for speaking\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGood fool, help me to some light and some paper. I tell thee, I\r\nam as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWell-a-day that you were, sir!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nBy this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light; and\r\nconvey what I will set down to my lady. It shall advantage thee\r\nmore than ever the bearing of letter did.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI will help you to 't.
