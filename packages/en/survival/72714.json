The vegetation which resulted in\r\nthe coal measures could have grown only in a sub-tropical climate,\r\nwhile over these are vast remains of ice-worn boulders and scratched\r\nrocks which obviously have been left by ice existing under polar\r\nconditions. Such records were not found only in one region, but\r\ncropped up in juxtaposition in many parts of the world. Remains of\r\nsub-tropical vegetation were found in Spitzbergen, and remains of an\r\nextensive ice-sheet moving at sea-level from the south were clearly\r\nrecognized in central and northern India. At first it was simply\r\nnoticed that the older fossils generally indicated a warmer climate,\r\nand it was considered that the early climate of a globe cooling from\r\nthe molten state would be warm and moist, and so account for the\r\nobserved conditions. It was recognized that the ice remains were\r\nrelatively recent, and so far as a cause for the Ice Age was sought\r\nit was considered that astronomical changes would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nIt was only when geologists began to find records of ice ages\r\nfar anterior to the Carboniferous Age, and astronomers proved by\r\nincontrovertible observations and calculations that changes in the\r\nearth’s orbit, or its inclination to that orbit, could not account\r\nfor the ice ages, that the importance and inexplicability of the\r\ngeological evidence for changes of climate came to be clearly\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years much study has been given to\r\n“palæoclimatology,” but such a study is extremely difficult.\r\nOnly a very small fraction of the total surface of the earth can\r\nbe geologically examined, and of that fraction a still smaller\r\nproportion has up to the present been studied in detail. There has\r\nbeen a great tendency to study intently a small region and then to\r\ngeneralize. The method of study which has to be employed is extremely\r\ndangerous. A geological horizon is determined by the fossils it\r\ncontains. Wherever fossils of a certain type are found the strata are\r\ngiven the same label. Isolated patches correlated by their fossils\r\nare found in different parts of the world, and it is frequently\r\nassumed not only that these rocks were laid down at the same time,\r\nbut that the conditions which they indicate existed over the whole of\r\nthe earth’s surface simultaneously. Thus geologists tell us that the\r\nclimate of the Carboniferous Age was warm and damp; of the Devonian\r\nAge cool and dry; of the Eocene Age very warm; of the Ice Age very\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nBut has the geologist given sufficient attention to the climatic\r\nzones during the various geological climates? It is true that the\r\ngeologist has definitely expressed the view that in certain ages\r\nclimatic zones did not exist; but from a meteorological point of\r\nview it is difficult to see how the climate could have been even\r\napproximately the same in all parts of the world if solar radiation\r\ndetermined in the past as in the present the temperature of the\r\nsurface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe climatic zones of the various geological periods will need much\r\ncloser study in the future; the data hardly exist at present, and the\r\ngreat area covered by the ocean will always make the study difficult\r\nand the conclusions doubtful. Admitting, for the sake of argument\r\nonly, large changes in average conditions, but with zonal variations\r\nof the same order of magnitude as those existing to-day, the slow\r\nchanges from period to period will cause any given climatic state\r\nto travel slowly over the surface of the earth, and this will so\r\ncomplicate the problem as to make it doubtful whether any conclusions\r\ncan be reached so long as the same criteria are used to determine\r\nboth the geological epoch and the climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nThese considerations apply more particularly to the earlier records,\r\nwhile Mr. Brooks has confined his work chiefly to the later records,\r\nbeginning with those of the Great Ice Age, in which climatic zones\r\nare clearly indicated by the limits of the ice; but in this problem\r\none cannot confine one’s attention to a portion of the record, for\r\nthe test of any explanation must be its sufficiency to explain all\r\nthe past changes of climate. One will not be satisfied with an\r\nexplanation of the Great Ice Age which does not explain at the same\r\ntime the records of earlier ice ages, of which there is indubitable\r\nevidence in the Permo-Carboniferous and Pre-Cambrian periods, and\r\nthe records of widespread tropical or sub-tropical conditions in the\r\nCarboniferous and Eocene Ages. Whether Mr. Brooks’ theory for the\r\ncause of the recent changes of climate satisfies this criterion must\r\nbe left to each reader to decide.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Brooks says, the literature on this subject is now immense,\r\nand it is most unsatisfactory literature to digest and summarize. In\r\nthe first place, many of the original observations which can be used\r\nin the study of past climates are hidden away in masses of purely\r\ngeological descriptions, and a great deal of mining has to be done\r\nto extract the climatic ore. Then, again, most of the writers who\r\nhave made a special study of climatic changes have had their own\r\ntheoretical ideas and most of their evidence has been _ex parte_. To\r\ntake a single example, for one paper discussing dispassionately the\r\nevidence for changes in climate during the historical period, there\r\nhave been ten to prove either that the climate has steadily improved,\r\nsteadily deteriorated, changed in cycles or remained unchanged. It is\r\nextremely difficult to arrive at the truth from such material, and\r\nstill more difficult to summarize the present state of opinion on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt may be complained that Mr. Brooks has himself adopted this same\r\nmethod and has written his book around his own theory. But was\r\nthere any alternative? There are so many theories and radically\r\ndifferent points of view that no writer could confine himself to the\r\nobservations and say what these indicate, for the indications are so\r\nvery different according to each theory in turn. And new theories are\r\nalways being propounded; since Mr. Brooks commenced to write this\r\nbook, Wegener has put forward his revolutionary theory according\r\nto which the polar axis has no stability, and the continents are\r\ntravelling over the face of the globe like debris on a flood. Where\r\nis there solid ground from which to discuss climatic changes if the\r\ncontinents themselves can travel from the equator to the pole and\r\nback again in the short period of one or two geological epochs?\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks has studied deeply geology, anthropology, and meteorology,\r\nand he has considerable mathematical ability. By applying the latter\r\nto the results of his studies he has developed a theory for the cause\r\nof climatic changes based on changes of land and sea area, and on\r\nchanges of elevation of land surfaces, and naturally he has made this\r\ntheory the basis of his work.\r\n\r\nThat there will be some who are not able to agree with him as to\r\nthe sufficiency of the causes he invokes, or who may even question\r\nwhether he also has not taken for granted what others dispute, goes\r\nwithout saying; but all will agree that he has presented a difficult\r\nsubject in a clear and concise way, and that meteorologists (and may\r\nI add geologists?) owe to him a deep debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\n                                                        G.

That time saw the growth of\r\nhumanity from a primitive stage but little removed from the higher\r\nanimals to the beginnings of a complicated civilization, and it saw\r\nthat human life spread from its cradle or cradles to the ends of the\r\nearth; it saw the configuration of the globe passing through a series\r\nof modifications which ended by establishing the physical geography\r\nof the present day. Finally, it saw a series of startling changes\r\nof climate which almost merit the term “Revolutions” of the old\r\ncatastrophic geologists, at the conclusion of which we can trace the\r\ngradual development of the climatic conditions of the present day.\r\nIn short, it is a period of immense interest which has a personal\r\napplication lacking in the remoter parts of geological time, and for\r\nthat reason it is worthy of the fullest study.\r\n\r\nOn the geological side the literature of the Ice Age is immense, and\r\nis beyond the power of any one man to master. Volumes might be, and\r\nnot infrequently have been, written on the glacial geology of areas\r\nlimited to a few square miles, or even on the deposits of a single\r\nsection. On the archæological side the literature is not yet so\r\nvoluminous, but is technical and conflicting in a high degree. It is\r\nonly when we seek the contributions of competent meteorologists that\r\nwe find a serious gap in the literature. Nor is this surprising, for\r\nmeteorologists are still so much occupied with the present vagaries\r\nof the weather, that few of them have time to extend their researches\r\ninto the geological past. Yet this is eminently a case where the past\r\nis the key to the present, and it may be that the solution of many\r\nproblems which meteorologists have hitherto faced in vain will yet be\r\nsuggested by studies of the climatic changes of the Ice Age.\r\n\r\nThe writer’s excuse for setting down his views is that he is\r\nintensely interested in all three sciences—geology, anthropology,\r\nand meteorology. The combination of these three subjects naturally\r\nended in specialization on their common meeting place, and led him to\r\nhope that he could assist his fellow geologists and anthropologists\r\nby acquainting them with some of the bearings of meteorology on\r\ntheir subject, and could open out to his fellow meteorologists a\r\nfascinating branch of their science.\r\n\r\nThe Quaternary, however, was not the only geological period to\r\nexhibit the phenomena of an Ice Age, and in order that we may more\r\nfully understand the status of the Quaternary Ice Age in the long\r\nsuccession of geological climates, and also to avoid the charge of\r\npresenting part of the evidence only, a brief discussion of the\r\nclimates of the earlier periods has been attempted. The plan of\r\nthe work is as follows: Chapter I deals generally with the causes\r\nof climatic fluctuations and with the meteorology of an Ice Age.\r\nChapter II gives a brief account of the climatic record as a whole,\r\nand Chapter III deals with the Tertiary period considered as leading\r\nup to the Quaternary Ice Age. Chapter IV discusses the subdivisions\r\nof the Glacial period, and the conflict between advocates of one\r\nand of repeated glaciations. Chapters V to XII give brief accounts,\r\n_from the standpoint of a meteorologist_, of the glacial history of\r\nNorthern Europe, the Mediterranean Region, Asia, North and South\r\nAmerica, Africa, Australia, and the South Polar regions. In Chapters\r\nXIII to XV post-Glacial climatology is considered. Chapters XVI and\r\nXVII deal with the major climatic fluctuations of the “historic”\r\nperiod, and finally, in Chapters XVIII and XIX, is a short discussion\r\nof the influence of climate on the evolution and history of man. A\r\nbrief bibliography concludes each chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF CLIMATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nFACTORS OF CLIMATE AND THE CAUSES OF CLIMATIC FLUCTUATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of any point on the earth’s surface depends on a complex\r\nof factors, some of them due to influences arriving from outside the\r\nearth, and others purely terrestrial. Since any variations of climate\r\nmust be due to a change in one or more of these, it is necessary,\r\nbefore we can discuss changes of climate, to consider briefly what\r\nthe factors are.\r\n\r\nThe only important extra-terrestrial factor of climate is the amount\r\nof radiant energy which reaches the borders of the earth’s atmosphere\r\nfrom the heavenly bodies—that is, from the sun, for the moon and\r\nstars can be ignored in this connexion. The only other conceivable\r\nfactor is the arrival of meteorites, bringing kinetic energy which is\r\nconverted into heat, and introducing cosmic dust into the atmosphere;\r\nbut it is highly improbable that this is of appreciable effect.\r\n\r\nThe amount of solar radiation[1] which reaches the earth depends in\r\nthe first place on the total radiation emitted by the sun, and in\r\nthe second place on the distance of the earth from the sun, both of\r\nwhich quantities are variable. It has been calculated that if other\r\nfactors remained unchanged an increase of ten per cent. in the solar\r\nradiation would raise the mean temperature of the earth’s surface\r\nby about 7° C., or between 12° and 13° F., with, of course, a\r\ncorresponding fall for a decrease.\r\n\r\nAfter the sun’s radiation reaches the outer limits of the earth’s\r\natmosphere its nature and intensity are modified by the composition\r\nof the air through which it passes. In general the air itself is\r\nvery transparent to the small wave-lengths which make up the solar\r\nrays, but the presence of fine dust, whether of volcanic or of cosmic\r\norigin, has been shown by Humphreys to be a distinct hindrance to\r\ntheir passage, so that volcanic eruptions of an explosive nature,\r\nsuch as that of Krakatoa in 1883, La Soufrière (St. Vincent) in 1902,\r\nor Katmai (Alaska) in 1912, may result in a fall of temperature over\r\nthe world as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the earth is determined by the balance between\r\nthe radiation received from the sun and the terrestrial radiation to\r\nspace, and a decrease in the latter would be as effective in raising\r\nthe mean temperature as an increase in the former. The use of glass\r\nfor greenhouses depends on this principle; for glass is transparent\r\nto heat rays of small wave-length, but is largely opaque to the rays\r\nof greater wave-length which make up terrestrial radiation. Certain\r\nconstituents of the atmosphere, especially water-vapour, carbon\r\ndioxide and ozone, are effective in this way, and variations in the\r\namount of these gases present may affect the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe angle at which the sun’s rays strike the earth’s surface is a\r\nhighly important factor. Within the Tropics the sun at midday is\r\nnearly vertical throughout the year, and the mean temperature in\r\nthese regions is correspondingly high; on the other hand, during\r\nthe long polar night the sun is not seen for half the year, and\r\nvery low temperatures prevail. There is thus a seasonal variation\r\nof the heat received from the sun in middle and high latitudes, the\r\nextent of which depends on the “obliquity of the ecliptic,” i.e. the\r\ninclination of the earth’s axis to the plane of its orbit round the\r\nsun, and any changes in this factor must alter the seasonal variation\r\nof climate.\r\n\r\nFurther, since the climate of any place depends so closely on its\r\nlatitude, it follows that if the latitude changes the climate will\r\nchange. A ship can change its latitude at will, but we are accustomed\r\nto regard the position of the “firm ground beneath our feet”\r\nrelatively to the poles as fixed within narrow limits. This stability\r\nhas, however, been questioned from time to time, mainly on evidence\r\nderived from palæoclimatology, and theories of climatic change have\r\nbeen based on the wanderings of continents and oceans. Finally, local\r\nclimate is intimately bound up with the distribution of land and sea,\r\nand the marine and atmospheric currents resulting therefrom, and on\r\nelevation above sea-level, both of which factors, as we shall see,\r\nhave suffered very wide variations in the geological past.\r\n\r\nNearly all the theories which have been put forward to account for\r\ngeological changes of climate, and especially the occurrence of the\r\nlast or Quaternary Ice Age, are based on the abnormal variation of\r\none or other of the above factors, and we may consider them briefly\r\nin turn. Very few have ever been taken seriously. In the first place,\r\nwe can at once dismiss fluctuations in the radiation emitted by\r\nthe sun as a cause of _great_ changes of climate. It is true that\r\nmany small fluctuations are traceable directly to this cause, such\r\nas the eleven-year periodicity of temperature and rainfall; but\r\nthese fluctuations are, and must be, greater at the equator than at\r\nthe poles, while the fall of temperature during the Glacial period\r\nreached its maximum near the poles and was least at the equator.\r\nMoreover, there is not the slightest direct evidence in support of\r\nsuch a theory, and it can only be admitted when all other hypotheses\r\nhave failed.\r\n\r\nThe “astronomical” theory of the cause of climatic fluctuations is\r\nassociated chiefly with the name of James Croll. Croll’s theory\r\nconnects abnormal variations of climate with variations, firstly of\r\nthe eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, and secondly of the ecliptic.\r\nIn periods of high eccentricity the hemisphere with winter in\r\naphelion is cold because the long severe winter is far from being\r\nbalanced by the short hot summer; at the same time the opposite\r\nhemisphere enjoys a mild equable climate. This theory commanded\r\ninstant respect, and still finds a place in the text-books, but\r\ndifficulties soon began to appear. The evidence strongly suggests\r\nthat glacial periods did not alternate in the two hemispheres,\r\nbut were simultaneous over the whole earth; even on the equator\r\nthe snow-line was brought low down. Moreover, on Mars the largest\r\nsnow-cap appears on the hemisphere with its winter in perihelion.\r\nAlthough Croll’s reasoning was beautifully ingenious he gave very few\r\nfigures; while the date which he gives for the conclusion of the Ice\r\nAge, 80,000 years ago, has been shown by recent research to be far\r\ntoo remote, 15,000 years being nearer the mark.\r\n\r\nCroll’s theory has recently been revived in an altered form by R.\r\nSpitaler, a Czecho-Slovakian meteorologist, who calculated the\r\nprobable alteration in the mean temperature of each latitude under\r\nmaximum eccentricity (0.7775) and maximum obliquity (27° 48′), the\r\ndistribution of land and water remaining unchanged. The results are\r\nshown in the attached table, where - means that the temperature was\r\nso much below the present mean, and + that it was so much above.\r\n\r\n  -------+-------------------------+--------------------------\r\n         |   Aphelion December.    |      Aphelion June.\r\n         +-------------------------+--------------------------\r\n         | Winter.

During the\r\nlong severe winter great volumes of sea water are brought to a low\r\ntemperature, and, owing to their greater weight, sink to the bottom\r\nof the ocean, where they remain cold and accumulate from year to\r\nyear. But the water warmed during the short hot summer remains on the\r\nsurface, where its heat is dissipated by evaporation and radiation.\r\nThus, throughout the cold period, lasting about 10,000 years, the\r\nocean in that hemisphere is steadily growing colder, and this mass\r\nof cold water is sufficient to maintain a low temperature through\r\nthe whole of the following period of 10,000 years with winter in\r\nperihelion, which would otherwise be a genial interval. In this\r\nway a period of great eccentricity becomes a glacial period over\r\nthe whole earth, but with crests of maximum intensity alternating\r\nin the two hemispheres. Unfortunately the numerical basis of this\r\ntheory is not presented, and it seems incredible that a deficiency\r\nof temperature could be thus maintained through so long a period.\r\nFurther, the difficulty about chronology remains, and the work brings\r\nthe astronomical theory no nearer to being a solution of the Ice Age\r\nproblem than was Croll’s.\r\n\r\nThe theory which connects fluctuations of climate on a geological\r\nscale with changes in the composition of the earth’s atmosphere is\r\ndue to Tyndall and Arrhenius, and was elaborated by Chamberlin. The\r\ntheory supposed that the earth’s temperature is maintained by the\r\n“blanketing” effect of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This\r\nacts like the glass of a greenhouse, allowing the sun’s rays to\r\nenter unhindered, but absorbing the heat radiated from the earth’s\r\nsurface and returning some of it to the earth instead of letting it\r\npass through to be lost in space. Consequently, any diminution in the\r\namount of carbon dioxide present would cause the earth to radiate\r\naway its heat more freely, so reducing its temperature. But it is\r\nnow known that the terrestrial radiation which this gas is capable of\r\nabsorbing is taken up equally readily by water-vapour, of which there\r\nis always sufficient present, and variations of carbon dioxide cannot\r\nhave any appreciable effect.\r\n\r\nBrief mention may be made here of a theory put forward by Humphreys,\r\nwho attributed glaciation to the presence of great quantities of\r\nvolcanic dust in the atmosphere. It would require an enormous output\r\nof volcanic dust to reduce the temperature sufficiently; but in\r\nany case the relation, if any, between vulcanicity and temperature\r\nduring the geological ages is rather the reverse of that supposed\r\nby Humphreys, periods of maximum volcanic action coinciding more\r\nfrequently with high temperatures than with low. Perhaps the best\r\ncomment on Humphreys’ theory is that in 1902 F. Frech produced its\r\nexact opposite, warm periods being associated with an excess of\r\nvulcanicity and cold periods with a diminution.\r\n\r\nThe theory which attributes climatic changes in various countries\r\nto variations in the position of the poles has been adduced in\r\ntwo main forms. The first is known as the Pendulation Theory, and\r\nsupposes the existence of two “oscillation poles” in Ecuador and\r\nSumatra. The latitude of these points remains unchanged, and the\r\ngeographical poles swing backwards and forwards along the meridian\r\nof 10 E. midway between them. Varying distances from the pole cause\r\nchanges of climate, and the movements of the ocean, which adjusts\r\nitself to the change of pole more rapidly than the land, causes the\r\ngreat transgressions and regressions of the sea and the elevation and\r\nsubsidence of the land.\r\n\r\nAn alternative form put forward by P. Kreichgauer, and recently\r\nbrought up again by Wegener, explains the apparent variations in\r\nthe position of the pole, not through a motion of the earth’s\r\naxis, but by the assumption that the firm crust has moved over the\r\nearth’s core so that the axis, remaining firm in its position,\r\npasses through different points of the earth’s crust. The cause of\r\nthese movements is the centrifugal force of the great masses of the\r\ncontinents, which are distributed symmetrically about the earth.\r\nImagine a single large continent resting on a sub-fluid magma in\r\ntemperate latitudes. Centrifugal force acting on this continent\r\ntends to drive it towards the equator. There is thus a tendency for\r\nthe latitude of Europe to decrease. Similar forces acting through\r\ngeological ages have caused the poles and equator to wander at large\r\nover the earth’s surface, and also caused the continents to shift\r\ntheir positions relatively to one another. According to Wegener, in\r\nthe Oligocene there was only a single enormous continent, America\r\nbeing united to Europe and Africa on the one hand, and through\r\nAntarctica to Australia on the other; while the Deccan stretched\r\nsouth-westwards nearly to Africa. The poles were in Alaska and north\r\nof the Falkland Islands. The treatment in Kreichgauer’s original book\r\nis speculative and at times fanciful; Wegener’s treatise appears\r\nto demand more respectful attention, but is open to some vital\r\nobjections. In the first place, theories of this class demand that\r\nthe glaciation occurred in different regions at widely different\r\ntimes, whereas we shall see in the following pages that the evidence\r\npoints very strongly to a double glaciation during the Quaternary\r\noccurring simultaneously over the whole earth. This objection, which\r\nwas fatal to Croll’s theory in its original form, is equally fatal\r\nto theories of pole-wandering as an explanation of the Quaternary\r\nIce Age. Secondly, we know that the last phase of this glaciation,\r\nknown as the Wisconsin stage in America and the Wurmian in Europe,\r\nwas highly developed only 20,000 years ago, and probably reached its\r\nmaximum not more than 30,000 years ago. In the last 5000 years there\r\nhas been no appreciable change of latitude, at least in Eurasia; and\r\nit seems impossible for the extensive alterations required in the\r\ngeography of the world by Wegener’s theory to have taken place in so\r\nshort a time.\r\n\r\nThe great glaciation of the Permian period, referred to in the\r\nnext chapter, is a totally different matter. During this time the\r\nice-sheets appear to have reached their maximum area, and to have\r\nextended to sea-level, in countries which are at present close to\r\nthe equator, while lands now in high latitudes remained unglaciated.\r\nIt is true that at the present day glaciers exist at high latitudes\r\nunder the equator itself, and given a ridge sufficiently steep and\r\na snowfall sufficiently heavy such glaciers would possibly extend\r\nto sea-level; but even these conditions would not give rise to the\r\nenormous deposits of true boulder-clay which have been discovered,\r\nand there seems no way of avoiding the supposition of an enormous\r\ndifference in the position of the pole relatively to the continents\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\nWegener’s theory alone, however, requires that glaciation should\r\nalways have been proceeding in some part of the globe (unless both\r\npoles were surrounded by wide expanses of ocean), which is hard to\r\nreconcile with the extremely definite and limited glaciations which\r\ngeological research has demonstrated. In these circumstances we may\r\ntentatively explain the pre-Tertiary glacial periods by combining\r\nWegener’s theory of the movements of continents and oceans as a\r\nwhole with the theory of changes of elevation and of land and sea\r\ndistribution which is outlined below. That is to say, we may suppose\r\nthat the positions of the continents and oceans have changed,\r\nrelatively both to each other and to the poles, slowly but more\r\nor less continuously throughout geological time; while at certain\r\nperiods the land and sea distribution became favourable for extensive\r\nglaciation of the regions which at that time were in high latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe geographical theory, which states that the Ice Age was brought\r\nabout by elevation in high latitudes, and by changes in the land and\r\nsea distribution, though never seriously challenged, has suffered\r\nuntil recently from a lack of precision. The present author attempted\r\nto remedy this by a close mathematical study of the relation of\r\ntemperature to land and sea distribution at the present day. The\r\nmethod at attack was as follows: from the best available isothermal\r\ncharts of all countries the mean temperature reduced to sea-level was\r\nread off for each intersection of a ten-degree square of latitude and\r\nlongitude, for January and July, from 70° N. to 60° S. latitude; this\r\ngave 504 values of temperature for each of these months. Round each\r\npoint was next drawn a circle with an angular radius of ten degrees,\r\ndivided into east and west semicircles. The area of each semicircle\r\nwas taken as 100, and by means of squared paper the percentage of\r\nland to the east and land to the west were calculated; finally, in\r\neach month the percentage of the whole circle occupied by land, ice,\r\nor frozen sea was calculated, this figure naturally being greater in\r\nwinter than in summer. The projection used was that of the “octagonal\r\nglobe,” published by the Meteorological Office, which shows the world\r\nin five sections, the error nowhere exceeding six per cent.\r\n\r\nThese figures were then analysed mathematically, and from them the\r\neffects on temperature of land to the east, land to the west, and\r\nice were calculated. The detailed numerical results are set out in\r\nan Appendix; it is sufficient here to give the following general\r\nconclusions:\r\n\r\n(1) In winter the effect of land to the west is always to lower\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n(2) In winter the effect of land to the east is almost negligible,\r\nthat is to say, the eastern shore of a continent is almost as cold\r\nas the centre of the continent. The only important exception to this\r\nrule is 70° N., which may be considered as coming within a belt of\r\npolar east winds.\r\n\r\n(3) In summer the general effect of land, whether to the east or\r\nwest, is to raise temperature, but the effect is nowhere anything\r\nlike so marked as the opposite effect in winter.\r\n\r\n(4) The effect of ice is always to lower temperature.\r\n\r\n(5) For every latitude a “basal temperature” can be found. This is\r\nthe temperature found near the centre of an ocean in that latitude.\r\nThis “basal temperature” is a function of the amount of land in the\r\nbelt of latitude. Poleward of latitude 20° an increase of land in the\r\nbelt lowers the winter basal temperatures very rapidly and raises the\r\nsummer basal temperature to a less extent. The “basal temperature”\r\nis important, since it is the datum line from which we set out to\r\ncalculate the winter and summer temperatures of any point, by the\r\naddition or subtraction of figures representing the local effect of\r\nland in a neighbouring 10° circle.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the scale of the temperature variations which\r\nmay be due to geographical changes, suppose that the belt between\r\n50° and 70° N. is entirely above the sea. Then we have the following\r\ntheoretical temperatures; for a point on 60° N. at sea-level:\r\n\r\n        January -30° F.; July 72° F.\r\n\r\nData for calculating the effect of ice are rather scanty, but the\r\nfollowing probable figures can be given, supposing that the belt in\r\nquestion were entirely ice-covered:\r\n\r\n        January -30° F. (as for land); July 23° F.\r\n\r\nSupposing that the belt were entirely oceanic, the mean temperature\r\nin 60° N. would be:\r\n\r\n        January 29° F.; July 41° F.\r\n\r\nThese figures show how enormously effective the land and sea\r\ndistribution really is. From Appendix it is easy to calculate the\r\nprobable temperature distribution resulting from any arrangement\r\nof land and water masses. Since the geography of the more recent\r\ngeological periods is now known in some detail, we have thus a means\r\nof restoring past climates and discussing the distribution of animals\r\nand plants in the light of this knowledge. Of course it is not\r\npretended that no other possible causes of great climatic variation\r\nexist, but no others capable of seriously modifying temperature\r\nover long periods are known to have been in operation. As we shall\r\nsee later, there are solar and other astronomical causes capable of\r\nmodifying climate slightly for a few decades or even centuries, but\r\nthese are insignificant compared with the mighty fluctuations of\r\ngeological time.\r\n\r\nIn applying the results of this “continentality” study to former\r\ngeological periods the method adopted is that of differences. The\r\npresent climate is taken as a standard, and the temperatures of,\r\nfor instance, the Glacial period are calculated by adding to or\r\nsubtracting from the present temperatures amounts calculated from\r\nthe change in the land and sea distribution. This has the advantage\r\nof conserving the present local peculiarities, such as those due\r\nto the presence of the Gulf Drift, but such a procedure would be\r\ninapplicable for a totally different land and sea distribution, such\r\nas prevailed during the Carboniferous period. That it is applicable\r\nfor the Quaternary is perhaps best shown by the following comparison\r\nof temperatures calculated from the distribution of land, sea and ice\r\nwith the actual temperatures of the Ice Age as estimated by various\r\nauthorities (inferred fall):\r\n\r\n  ------------+--------------------+--------------+-----------------\r\n              |                    |              | Calculated Fall.\r\n  Locality.   |     Author.        |Inferred Fall.+-----+-----+-----\r\n              |                    |              | Jan.|July.|Mean.\r\n  ------------+--------------------+--------------+-----+-----+-----\r\n              |                    |     °F.      | °F. | °F. | °F.\r\n  Scandinavia | J.

The\r\nexistence of a great land-mass generally implies that part of it\r\nat least has a considerable elevation, perhaps 10,000 or 20,000\r\nfeet, and these high lands lave a very different climate to the\r\nneighbouring lowlands. Meteorologists have measured this difference\r\nin the case of temperature and found that the average fall with\r\nheight is at the rate of 1° F. in 300 feet. In the lower levels the\r\nfall is usually greater in summer than in winter, but at 3000 feet it\r\nis fairly uniform throughout the year. Consequently, quite apart from\r\nany change in climate due to the increased land area, an elevation of\r\n3000 feet would result in a fall of temperature of 10° F., winter and\r\nsummer alike. This reinforces the effect of increased land area and\r\naids in the development of ice-sheets or glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe effect of geographical changes on the distribution of rainfall\r\nare much more complicated. The open sea is the great source of\r\nthe water-vapour in the atmosphere, and since evaporation is very\r\nmuch greater in the hot than in the cold parts of the globe, for\r\nconsiderable precipitation over the world as a whole there must\r\nbe large water areas in the Tropics. In temperate latitudes the\r\nwater-vapour is carried over the land by onshore winds, and some of\r\nit is precipitated where the air is forced to rise along the slopes\r\nof hills or mountains. Some rain falls in thunderstorms and similar\r\nlocal showers, but the greater part of the rain in most temperate\r\ncountries is associated with the passage of “depressions.” These are\r\nour familiar wind- and rain-storms; a depression consists essentially\r\nof winds blowing in an anti-clockwise direction round an area of low\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThese centres of low pressure move about more or less irregularly,\r\nbut almost invariably from west to east in the temperate regions.\r\nThey are usually generated over seas or oceans, and, since a supply\r\nof moist air is essential for their continued existence, they tend to\r\nkeep to the neighbourhood of water masses or, failing that, of large\r\nriver valleys. In a large dry area depressions weaken or disappear.\r\nTheir tracks are also very largely governed by the positions of areas\r\nof high pressure or anticyclones, which they tend to avoid, moving\r\nfrom west to east on the polar side of a large anticyclone and from\r\neast to west on the equatorial side. Since anticyclones are developed\r\nover the great land areas in winter, this further restricts the paths\r\nof depressions to the neighbourhood of the oceans at that season.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons the tracks of depressions, and therefore the\r\nrainfall, are intimately connected with the distribution of land and\r\nsea. In winter there is little rainfall in the interior of a great\r\nland-mass, except where it is penetrated by an arm of the sea like\r\nthe Mediterranean; on the other hand, the coasts receive a great deal\r\nof rain or snow. The interior receives its rain mostly in spring or\r\nsummer; if the coastal lands are of no great elevation this will be\r\nplentiful, but if the coasts are mountainous the interior will be\r\narid, like the central basins of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe development of an ice-sheet is equivalent to introducing\r\nperpetual winter in the area occupied by the ice. The low temperature\r\nmaintains high pressure, and storm-tracks are unable to cross the\r\nice. At the present day depressions rarely penetrate beyond the\r\nouter fringe of the Antarctic continent, and only the southern\r\nextremity of Greenland is affected by them. Since the total energy\r\nin the atmosphere is increased by the presence of an ice-sheet,\r\nwhich affords a greater contrast of temperature between cold pole\r\nand equator, storms will increase in frequency and their tracks\r\nmust be crowded together on the equatorial side of the ice-sheet.\r\nIn the southern hemisphere we have great storminess in the “roaring\r\nforties”; south of Greenland the Newfoundland banks are a region\r\nof great storminess. Hence, when an ice-sheet covered northern and\r\ncentral Europe the Mediterranean region must have had a marked\r\nincrease of storminess with probably rain in summer as well as in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nBut if snow-bearing depressions cannot penetrate an ice-sheet, it may\r\nbe asked how the ice-sheet can live. The answer depends on the nature\r\nof the underlying country. A land of high relief such as Antarctica\r\nis, and as Greenland probably is, rising to a maximum elevation of\r\nmany thousand feet near its centre, draws its nourishment chiefly\r\nfrom the upper currents which flow inward on all sides to replace\r\nthe cooled air which flows outwards near the surface. These upper\r\ncurrents carry a certain amount of moisture, partly in the form of\r\nvapour, but partly condensed as cirrus and even cumulus cloud.\r\n\r\nAt low temperatures air is able to hold only a negligible amount of\r\nwater-vapour, and this current, coming in contact with the extremely\r\ncold surface of the ice, is sucked dry, and its moisture added to\r\nthe ice-sheet. Probably there is little true snowfall, but the\r\ncondensation takes place chiefly close to the surface, forming a\r\nfrozen mist resembling the “ice-mist” of Siberia. Even if the central\r\nland is not high enough to reach into the upper current at its normal\r\nlevel, the surface outflow of cold air will draw the current down\r\nto the level of the ice. This will warm it by compression, but the\r\nice-surface is so cold that such warming makes little difference in\r\nthe end. This process of condensation ensures that after the ice\r\nreaches a certain thickness it becomes independent of topography, and\r\nin fact the centre of the Scandinavian ice-sheet lay not along the\r\nmountain axis, but some distance to the east of it.\r\n\r\nIt is probably only on the edges of the ice-sheet, and especially in\r\nareas of considerable local relief, that snowfall of the ordinary\r\ntype takes place, associated with moist winds blowing in the front\r\nsection of depressions which skirt the ice-edge. But when conditions\r\nare favourable this source of supply is sufficient to enable these\r\nlocal ice-sheets to maintain an independent life, merely fusing with\r\nthe edges of the larger sheet where they meet. Examples of such\r\nlocal centres in Europe were the Irish and Scottish glaciers, and\r\nat a later stage the Lofoten glaciers of the west of Norway, and in\r\nAmerica the Cordilleran glaciers of Columbia.\r\n\r\nPenck and Brückner have demonstrated that in the Alps the increase of\r\nglaciation was due to a fall of temperature and not to an increase\r\nof snowfall. The argument is threefold: firstly, the lowering of the\r\nsnow-line was uniform over the whole Alpine area, instead of being\r\nirregular as it would be if it depended on variations of snowfall;\r\nsecondly, the area and depth of the parent snow-fields which fed\r\nthe glaciers remained unchanged, hence the increased length of the\r\nglaciers must have been due to decreased melting below the snow-line,\r\ni.e. to lower temperatures; thirdly, the upper limit of tree-growth\r\nin Europe sank by about the same amount as the snow-line. The same\r\nconclusion holds for the great Scandinavian and North American\r\nice-sheets, the extension of which was undoubtedly due to a great\r\nfall of temperature. In the case of the Alps the interesting point\r\nhas come to light that the fall of temperature, though due in part\r\nto increased elevation, is mainly accounted for by the presence of\r\nthe Scandinavian ice-sheet, which extended its influence for many\r\nmiles beyond the actual limits of glaciation, so that its waxings and\r\nwanings are faithfully reproduced in those of the Alpine glaciers,\r\neven to the details of the final retreat after the last maximum.\r\n\r\nIt is only when we turn to tropical and sub-tropical regions that\r\nwe find variations of temperature unable to account for increased\r\nglaciation. Not only were the changes of land and sea distribution\r\non a very much smaller scale than further north, but the Appendix\r\nshows that the temperature value of a corresponding change of land\r\narea is also very much less. But the high intertropical mountains—the\r\nAndes and Kenya and Kilimanjaro in central Africa—which to-day bear\r\nglaciers, in Quaternary times carried much greater ones. We cannot\r\ncall in a fall of temperature, for the reason above stated, and also\r\nbecause at lower levels there is no evidence of colder conditions.\r\nIn the Glacial period the marine fauna was the same as to-day, and\r\nmountains which now fall short of the snow-line by a few hundred\r\nfeet were still unglaciated even then. The only alternative is\r\nincreased snowfall on the higher mountains. Fortunately this fits in\r\nwell with meteorological theory. The rain and snowfall of tropical\r\nregions depends, first of all, on the evaporation over the oceans.\r\nBut evaporation is profoundly influenced by the velocity of the wind;\r\nand the wind, which in the Tropics represents the strength of the\r\natmospheric circulation, depends on the thermal gradient between the\r\nequator and the poles; since there is no evidence of any appreciable\r\nchange of temperature over the Tropics as a whole, while there was\r\na very great fall in cold temperate and polar regions, the thermal\r\ngradient, and therefore, ultimately, the tropical and sub-tropical,\r\nrain and snowfall must have been very greatly increased. Hence the\r\nincreased glaciation of high mountains near the equator, and hence\r\nalso the evidence of “Pluvial periods” in the sub-tropical arid\r\nregions on either side of the equator.\r\n\r\nThus during Glacial periods we have:\r\n\r\n(1) Elevation in high latitudes caused a great increase of land areas\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n(2) Both elevation and increase of land area resulted in a lowering\r\nof temperature, materially increased by the gradual development of\r\ngreat ice-sheets.\r\n\r\n(3) These ice-sheets caused the development of subsidiary ice-sheets\r\non their southern and western borders.\r\n\r\n(4) The lowering of temperature in high latitudes increased the\r\nthermal gradient between equator and poles, resulting in:\r\n\r\n      (_a_) Increased snowfall, and hence increased glaciation on\r\n      high mountains near the equator.\r\n\r\n      (_b_) Pluvial periods in the sub-tropical arid regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Humphreys, W.

This is a\r\n“tillite,” or boulder-clay, discovered by Prof. Coleman at the base\r\nof the Lower Huronian (Early Proterozoic) of Canada. It extends in\r\nan east and west direction for 1000 miles across northern Ontario,\r\nand northward from the northern shore of Lake Huron for 750 miles. It\r\nrests on a scratched or polished surface of various rocks, and the\r\nincluded boulders are not always local, but some have been brought\r\nfrom a considerable distance. All these characters point to a large\r\nice-sheet.\r\n\r\nTraces of Proterozoic glaciations have been discovered in various\r\nother parts of the world, and some of these may be of the same age\r\nas the Canadian ice-sheet, but they cannot yet be dated exactly. An\r\ninteresting example is western Scotland, which J. Geikie considered\r\nto have been glaciated by ice from the north-west which has since\r\nsunk into the North Atlantic. Other glacial remains have no doubt\r\nbeen destroyed or deeply buried, while some may still await\r\ndiscovery, and at present we must be content to note the occurrence\r\nof a glacial period at this time without attempting any description\r\nof the distribution of climates over the globe.\r\n\r\nFollowed a long period of milder climate indicated in America by\r\nthick deposits of limestone with the remains of reef-building\r\norganisms and other marine life. This period may have been\r\ninterrupted at least once by the recurrence of glacial conditions,\r\nbut the evidence for this is doubtful. It must be remembered that the\r\nduration of the Proterozoic was very great, at least as long as all\r\nsubsequent time, while the relics of it which are now known to us are\r\nfew and scattered, so that much which happened during that time is a\r\nclosed book. It is not until the very close of the Proterozoic that\r\nwe again find indisputable evidence of widespread glacial action.\r\n\r\nThis second great glaciation was placed originally in the earliest\r\nCambrian (see table of geological formations at the end of Chapter\r\nI), but later evidence shows that it is slightly older than the\r\noldest deposit which can be referred to this series, and it may\r\nbe designated the Pre-Cambrian glaciation. Tillites of this age\r\nhave been found in the middle Yangtse region of China and in South\r\nAustralia (where they extend from 20 miles south of Adelaide to 440\r\nmiles north, with an east-west extension of 200 miles). Glacial\r\ndeposits which probably refer to this period have been found also\r\nin India, both in the Deccan and near Simla, over a wide area in\r\nSouth Africa, and in the extreme north of Norway. This distribution\r\nsuggests the presence of two centres of glaciation, one between\r\nChina, India and Australia, and the other north-west of Europe. The\r\nsouth-eastern of these was the most extensive, and probably indicates\r\na ring of glaciated continents surrounding the pole, rather than a\r\nsingle enormous ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nDuring the Cambrian all evidence of glacial action ceases, and we\r\nhave, instead, evidence of a warm, fairly uniform climate in the\r\nabundant marine life. This continued during the Ordovician and became\r\naccentuated during the Silurian period, when reef corals lived in the\r\nseas of all parts of the world. Terrestrial deposits are curiously\r\nlacking in all this series, and this suggests that in the absence\r\nof any great mountain-building and elevation shallow seas extended\r\nover almost the whole of the surface, accompanied by mild oceanic\r\nclimates extending to high latitudes.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Silurian there was a period of mountain-building\r\nand the formation of continents. The extinction of numerous species\r\nof marine organisms and the rapid evolution of others point to the\r\nseas becoming cooler and the stress of life more acute. In the\r\nsucceeding Devonian period there is evidence of glacial conditions\r\nin South Africa in the form of a thick series of quartzites\r\nwith striated pebbles up to fifteen inches long, but no typical\r\nboulder-clay has been discovered. There are also some doubtful traces\r\nfrom England. The most noteworthy development of the Devonian in the\r\nBritish Isles is, however, a thick deposit of red sandstone (Old Red\r\nSandstone) of the type that is formed in shallow lagoons or inclosed\r\nbasins, and suggesting desert conditions, so that the rainfall of the\r\nBritish Isles was probably slight.\r\n\r\nThese continental conditions passed away towards the close of the\r\nDevonian period, and once again extensive warm oceans appear to\r\nhave spread over a large part of the globe, associated with the\r\ndevelopment of reef-building corals. Climate continued warm and\r\nequable throughout the greater part of the Carboniferous. The\r\nimportant feature of this period is the great system of coal-beds\r\nwhich extends through North America and Europe to China, with\r\nnorthern and southern limits in 80° N. (north-east Greenland and\r\nSpitzbergen) and 15° S. (Zambesi River). Wegener, summing up the\r\nevidence, and considering especially the absence of annual rings\r\nin the trees, concludes that the coal-beds are the remains of the\r\ntropical rain-forest when the equator lay across Europe some 30\r\ndegrees north of its present position.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the Carboniferous period great mountain-building\r\nset in, resulting in the formation of the famous Gondwanaland,\r\nincluding south and central Africa, southern Asia, part of Australia\r\nand possibly Brazil. From a consideration of the glacial evidence,\r\nhowever, it appears, as will be seen later, that this was probably\r\na ring of neighbouring and partly adjoining land areas rather than\r\na single enormous continent. At the same time the climate became\r\ncooler, and a hardier vegetation, known as the _Glossopteris_ flora,\r\ndeveloped in the southern hemisphere, including woody trees with\r\nannual rings indicating seasons. The large insects of the coal\r\nforests which did not undergo a metamorphosis were replaced by\r\nsmaller types which did pass through such a stage; this change of\r\nhabit is considered to be due to the winters having become severe,\r\nso that the insects learnt to hibernate through them. In the early\r\nPermian, Gondwanaland was occupied by great ice-sheets, remains of\r\nwhich in the form of tillites of great thickness, ice-worn surfaces\r\nand striated boulders have been found in South Africa, Belgian Congo,\r\nand Togoland, Tasmania and widely separated parts of Australia,\r\npeninsular and north-western India, and probably also Afghanistan.\r\nIn India the glacial striæ show that the ice-sheet was moving north,\r\nwhile in South Africa it was moving south, i.e. away from the present\r\nequator in both cases. Widespread glacial remains have been found\r\nalso in Brazil, northern Argentine and the Falkland Islands, and\r\nthere are probable traces near Boston in North America, in Armenia,\r\nthe Urals and the Alps, and possibly also in England.\r\n\r\nWegener’s reconstruction of the geography of this period places the\r\nsouth pole a little to the south-east of South Africa, surrounded by\r\na great continent composed of the junction of Africa, South America,\r\nAntarctica, Australia, and an extended Deccan added to by smoothing\r\nout the folds of the Himalayas. This great circumpolar continent he\r\nconsiders to have been the site of an immense ice-cap. The North Pole\r\nlay in the Pacific Ocean, so that almost all the remaining land areas\r\nenjoyed temperate or tropical climates.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that this peculiar distribution of glacial\r\nremains apparently necessitates a position of the pole somewhere\r\nnear that described by Wegener, but the theory of a single polar\r\nice-cap extending beyond 50° latitude on nearly all sides presents\r\ndifficulties. From the mechanism of the supply of snow to an\r\nice-sheet described in the preceding chapter it follows that, except\r\nclose to the edges, all the moisture precipitated must be brought in\r\nby upper currents. But even if we take into account the increase in\r\nthe strength of the atmospheric circulation due to the introduction\r\nof an ice-cap, there is a limit to the supply of moisture by this\r\nprocess. All such moisture has to cross the periphery, and with\r\nincreasing radius; the number of square miles of area to each mile\r\nof periphery becomes greater, slowly at first, then more and more\r\nrapidly. We shall see in Chapter VIII that even the North American\r\nQuaternary ice-sheet became unwieldy from this cause, and suffered\r\nseveral changes of centre.\r\n\r\nHence it seems that the _rapprochement_ of the continents in\r\nPermo-Carboniferous times need not have been so complete as Wegener\r\nsupposes, the glacial phenomena being more readily explicable by a\r\nring of continents surrounding a polar sea, as in the case of the\r\nQuaternary glaciation of the northern hemisphere. The local Permian\r\nglaciations of Europe and North America, some of which fell close to\r\nWegener’s equator, are easily explicable as due to mountain glaciers\r\nsimilar to those of Ruwenzori and other tropical mountains during the\r\nQuaternary. There were interglacial periods in South Africa, Brazil\r\nand New South Wales, which increase the resemblance between the\r\nPermian and Quaternary Ice Ages.\r\n\r\nIn Upper Permian times there was a widespread development of arid\r\nclimates, especially in the present temperate parts of North America\r\nand Europe. Wegener attributes this to the northerly position of the\r\nequator bringing the sub-tropical desert belt (Sahara, Arizona) to\r\nthese regions. In the Trias these conditions gradually gave place\r\nto another period of widespread warm shallow seas, with abundant\r\nmarine life and corals extending over a large part of the world, even\r\nto Arctic Alaska. In the United States there are the remains of the\r\nforests of this period, in which the tree-trunks show very little\r\nevidence of annual rings, indicating that the seasonal changes were\r\nslight, so that the climate had again become mild and oceanic.\r\n\r\nIn the Lias (Lower Jurassic), there was crustal movement and\r\nvolcanic action accompanied by land-formation and a gradual lowering\r\nof temperature. There was a great reduction in the abundance and\r\ngeographical range of corals, and most of the species of insects are\r\nof dwarf types. There is, however, no evidence of glacial action.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Jurassic period appears to have been warmer than the\r\nLias. Insects of a large size and corals again attained a very wide\r\ndistribution, but there is enough difference in the marine faunas of\r\ndifferent regions to indicate a greater development of climatic zones\r\nthan in the extremely oceanic periods such as the late Triassic.\r\nSchuchert points out that the plants of Louis Philippe Land in 63° S.\r\nare the same, even to species, as those of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nIn the Cretaceous period the climate was at first similar to that of\r\nthe Jurassic, and trees grew in Alaska, Greenland and Spitzbergen.\r\nThese trees, however, show marked annual rings, indicating a\r\nconsiderable differentiation of seasons, while trees of this age\r\nfound in Egypt are devoid of rings. Towards the close of the\r\nCretaceous there were many crustal movements and great volcanic\r\noutbursts, accompanied by a considerable reduction of temperature,\r\nwhich led to the extinction of many forms of life and the rapid\r\nevolution of others. There is no evidence of glacial action during\r\nthe Cretaceous, however, though at the beginning of the Eocene\r\nthere was a local glaciation of the San Juan Mountains of Colorado.\r\nAccording to W. W. Atwood this glaciation was double, the first\r\nstage being of the Alpine mountain glacier type, separated by an\r\ninterglacial from the second stage, which was of the Piedmont type\r\n(mountain glaciers spreading out on the plain at the foot of the\r\nmountain). This Eocene glaciation has been found nowhere else,\r\nhowever, and the climate of the Tertiary, which is discussed more\r\nfully in the next chapter, was in general warm and oceanic, becoming\r\nrigorous towards its close.\r\n\r\nSumming up, we find that in the geological history of the earth two\r\nmain types of climate seem to have alternated. Following on periods\r\nof great crustal movement, and the formation of large land areas,\r\nthe general climate was cool, with a marked zonal distribution\r\nof temperature, culminating during at least four periods in the\r\ndevelopment of great sheets of inland ice. It is in such a period,\r\nthough, fortunately, not at its worst, that we are living at present.\r\nDuring quiescent periods, on the other hand, when these continents\r\nlargely disappeared beneath the sea, climate became mild and equable,\r\nand approached uniformity over a great part of the world. At these\r\ntimes, as soon as the surface water of the sea in high latitudes\r\nbegan to cool, it sank to the bottom, and its place was taken by\r\nwarmer water from lower latitudes. The oceanic circulation was very\r\ncomplete, but there were practically no cold surface currents.\r\nInstead, there was probably a general drift of the surface waters\r\nfrom low to high latitudes (with an easterly trend owing to rotation\r\nof the earth), and a return drift of cooled water along the floor of\r\nthe ocean. The formation of sea-ice near the poles became impossible,\r\nwhile the widespread distribution of marine life was facilitated.\r\n\r\nThe alternation of periods of crustal deformation with periods of\r\nquiescence has frequently been noticed, and has been termed the\r\n“geological rhythm.” It may be attributed to the gradual accumulation\r\nof small strains during a quiescent period until the breaking point\r\nis reached, when earth-movements take place until equilibrium is\r\nrestored, when the process is repeated.\r\n\r\nThe gradual erosion of the land by river and wave-action and the\r\nconsequent shifting of the load provides a certain amount of stress;\r\nbut this is local, and calls for local readjustments only. A more\r\ngenerally effective agency may be the gradual slowing down of the\r\nearth’s rotation under the influence of tidal friction. The mechanism\r\nof this process was described by A. E. H. Love (“Nature,” 94, 1914,\r\np. 254): “The surface of the ocean, apart from waves and tides, is at\r\nany time a figure of equilibrium answering to the speed of rotation\r\nat the time, more oblate when the speed is greater, less oblate when\r\nit is slower. Let us imagine that the lithosphere also is at some\r\ntime a figure of equilibrium answering to the speed of rotation at\r\nthat time. If the speed remained constant, the lithosphere would\r\nretain this figure, and the matter within it would remain always\r\nin the same configuration without having to support any internal\r\ntangential stress. Now suppose that the speed of rotation gradually\r\ndiminishes. The surface of the ocean will gradually become less and\r\nless oblate. The lithosphere also will gradually become less oblate,\r\nbut not to such an extent as to make it a figure of equilibrium\r\nanswering to the diminished speed of rotation, while the matter\r\nwithin it will get into a state of gradually increasing internal\r\ntangential stress. The effect on the distribution of land and water\r\nwill be that the depth of the ocean will gradually diminish in lower\r\nlatitudes and increase in higher latitudes, the latitudes of no\r\nchange being 35° 16′ N. and S.\r\n\r\n“The internal tangential stress in the matter within the lithosphere\r\nmay increase so much that it can no longer be supported. If this\r\nhappens a series of local fractures will take place, continuing until\r\nthe lithosphere is again adjusted much more nearly to a figure of\r\nequilibrium, which will be less oblate than the original figure. The\r\neffect on the distribution of land and water will be that the depth\r\nof the ocean will increase rather rapidly and spasmodically in lower\r\nlatitudes and diminish in higher latitudes.\r\n\r\n“Accordingly, the kind of geological change which the theory of tidal\r\nfriction would lead us to expect is a sort of rhythmic sequence,\r\ninvolving long periods of comparative quiescence, marked by what\r\nSuess calls ‘positive movements of the strand,’ in the higher\r\nlatitudes, and ‘negative movements’ in the lower, alternating with\r\ncomparatively short periods of greater activity, marked by rise of\r\nthe land around the poles and subsidences in the equatorial regions.”\r\n\r\nThe main periods of adjustment under this scheme fall at the\r\nbeginning and end of the Proterozoic, in the Permo-Carboniferous\r\nand in the Quaternary. The two latter at least were periods of\r\ngreat earth-movement, while the two former were also continental\r\nperiods, since the land-masses were large and high enough to develop\r\nice-sheets.\r\n\r\nThe difficult question raised by the low latitudes in which the\r\nPre-Cambrian and Permo-Carboniferous glaciations were chiefly\r\ndeveloped cannot yet be regarded as solved, but the geological facts\r\nspeak strongly in favour of ice-sheets rather than mountain glaciers,\r\nand practically speaking it is meteorologically impossible for large\r\nice-sheets to extend to sea-level in the Tropics while the rest of\r\nthe world enjoys a temperate climate. The only escape seems to be to\r\nassume a position of the South Pole somewhere between Africa, India\r\nand Australia throughout the whole of the Proterozoic and Palæozoic\r\nperiods. On the other hand, from the Jurassic onwards, there is no\r\nreal support to the hypothesis that the positions of the poles were\r\nother than they are now. Wegener’s explanation of the Quaternary Ice\r\nAge we have seen to be untenable. The period of transition appears\r\nto lie in the later Permian and Triassic. The Proterozoic and\r\nPermo-Carboniferous glacial periods were much less definite in the\r\nnorth than in the south-east; but such as they were they appear to\r\nhave been most severe in the east of North America, where the ice was\r\ncoming from the north; there are also some glacial traces in Europe.\r\nThis indicates that the position of the North Pole cannot have been\r\nin the North Pacific Ocean, which is antipodal to the South Indian\r\nOcean. Hence it seems that what we have to consider is not so much\r\nthe wanderings of the poles at large among the continents as the\r\nbreak-off at the close of the Palæozoic period of portions of the\r\nAntarctic continent and their drift northwards towards the equator.\r\nWithout going into the mathematics of the question, it seems just\r\npossible that the periodic overloading of circumpolar continents by\r\nlarge ice-masses could have this effect in the course of time,[2] but\r\nthe suggestion is put forward tentatively for consideration rather\r\nthan as a definite hypothesis. We must be thankful that in the next\r\nchapter we are on safer ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Coleman, A. P. “Climates and physical conditions of the early\r\n  Pre-Cambrian.” _Geol.

Throughout most of its length it\r\nappears to have been characterized by remarkably mild and equable\r\nclimatic conditions extending into comparatively high latitudes,\r\nso that the west coast of Greenland, for instance, had a flora of\r\nalmost sub-tropical aspect. Since the plants in question—chiefly\r\npalms and cycads—are not of identical species with their present-day\r\nrepresentatives, it is unsafe to base numerical estimates of the\r\ntemperature upon them, but it is at least obvious that these regions\r\nwere warmer than they are at present.\r\n\r\nLet us glance for a moment at the geography of the Tertiary\r\nperiod. The most noticeable point is a great expanse of sea over\r\nsouth-eastern Europe, including the Mediterranean countries,\r\nextending away over the Black Sea and Caspian, and stretching in a\r\ngreat arm to the Arctic Ocean, south of Novaya Zemlya. The geology of\r\nthe archipelago north of Canada is not yet well known, but it seems\r\nprobable that there was a considerable area of Tertiary ocean there\r\nalso. The sea further encroached on the present boundaries of North\r\nAmerica, both east and west, and on the north-eastern coast of Asia.\r\nBearing in mind the principles set out in the first chapter, we can\r\ninfer from these changes a great increase in the winter temperature\r\nof the regions along the Arctic circle. The increase reached a\r\nmaximum on the west of Greenland and in western Siberia, but the\r\nwest coast of Alaska also had a decidedly warm climate in the late\r\nMiocene and Pliocene.\r\n\r\nThe basin of the Arctic Ocean, which already existed at that stage,\r\nwas raised to a temperature considerably higher than the present\r\nby three great streams of warm water flowing into it. If, as seems\r\nprobable, the Bering Strait was deeper, and the submarine ridge\r\nacross the North Atlantic less pronounced, the obstacles to the\r\noutflow of cold water along the ocean floor were much less than now.\r\nFinally, the winter temperatures of the land-masses to the south,\r\nand especially Siberia, being already very much less severe owing\r\nto the sea over Europe, the temperature of the water of the great\r\nrivers flowing into the Arctic was not so low. For these reasons the\r\ndevelopment of ice in the Arctic Ocean was very much diminished,\r\nand possibly entirely absent, allowing a great amelioration of the\r\nclimate of Greenland, the rigor of which is at present much enhanced\r\nby the ice which flows down the Greenland Sea and round Cape Farewell.\r\n\r\nThe cumulative effect of all these changes—greater water area,\r\ngreater inflow of warm surface water, less inflow of cold river\r\nwater, less ice-development—must have been a mild equable rainy\r\nclimate, entirely suitable to a rich vegetation. The sub-tropical\r\naspect of that vegetation should not be stressed, for it was probably\r\nas much an expression of the geological age of the period in question\r\nas of its climate.\r\n\r\nThe objection may be raised that at the present time the\r\nsub-antarctic islands in the great Southern Ocean have the most\r\nmaritime climate in the world, but are not by any means places of\r\nopulent vegetation. The difference is entirely accounted for by the\r\npresence of the great ice-bearing Antarctic continent. Its effect\r\nis twofold. Firstly, the glaciers shed into the Southern Ocean an\r\nimmense quantity of ice and ice-cold water annually, which must have\r\nan appreciable effect on temperature. Secondly, the presence of this\r\nice-covered continent and the floating ice in its neighbourhood\r\nextending as far as the sixtieth parallel, by forming a marked\r\ncontrast with the warmer waters further north, greatly intensifies\r\nthe strength of the atmospheric circulation in these regions,\r\nresulting in the development of a great succession of severe storms\r\nwhich sweep the sub-antarctic islands. There are no great land-masses\r\nto break the force of the wind, and these latitudes are among the\r\nstormiest, windiest regions of the earth—gale succeeding gale, winter\r\nand summer alike; and it is largely to the extraordinary power of the\r\nwind that we must attribute the desolate appearance of the islands.\r\n\r\nThe picture we have drawn of the high northern latitudes in early\r\nTertiary times is vastly different. A great warm ocean occupied the\r\nArctic regions, fed by three ocean currents analogous to the Gulf\r\nDrift, and the fall of temperature was gradual from the tropic to the\r\npole. The return colder currents were mainly along the ocean floor\r\nand with little ice-formation the storms were few and not severe. On\r\nthe western shores of the continents mild rain-bearing south-west\r\nwinds prevailed, and a quiet moist warm atmosphere existed which was\r\nespecially favourable to plant life. This favourable state of affairs\r\nlasted until well on in the Miocene, and then changes set in. The\r\nland and sea distribution underwent essential modifications. The\r\ngreat Tertiary continent or archipelago which is believed to have\r\nexisted in the western Pacific, and whose last remaining summits\r\nnow form the scattered islands of that ocean, gradually subsided,\r\nand in its place elevation began in higher latitudes. Bering Strait\r\nbecame narrow and shallow, and was probably for a time entirely\r\nclosed, while the connexion between the Arctic and Indian Oceans was\r\nclosed permanently, leaving in its lowest areas a chain of great\r\ninland seas and lakes, of which the Caspian and Aral Seas are now\r\nthe greatest representatives. The Canadian Archipelago was probably\r\nraised above its present level, and formed a great northern extension\r\nof the American continental area. The changes in the Atlantic also\r\nwere very extensive. The West Indies were the site of a large and\r\nlofty Antillean continent; further north a considerable land-mass\r\nexisted east of Newfoundland; Greenland was joined on the west to\r\nthe extended American continent, and considerably enlarged to the\r\nsouth-east. Iceland, though it remained an island, was elevated and\r\nprobably nearly doubled in area, and between Iceland and the north of\r\nScotland was developed a great submarine ridge, which may or may not\r\nhave risen above the sea in places. The British Isles became a solid\r\nblock of land, united with continental Europe across the English\r\nChannel and the great plain which is now the North Sea. Scandinavia\r\nwas elevated by more than a thousand feet, and the elevation extended\r\nat least as far as Spitzbergen. The Murman area had a considerable\r\nextension. In eastern Asia the Sea of Okhotsk was land and Japan was\r\nunited to the mainland.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere our knowledge is not nearly so detailed.\r\nThe presence of marine Middle-Tertiary beds with temperate mollusca\r\nin Graham Land and of plant-bearing beds in Seymour Island point to\r\na smaller Antarctic continent and very much warmer conditions at\r\nthis time in the South as well as in the North Polar regions. For\r\nthe close of the Tertiary, however, we have strong grounds in the\r\ndistribution of animals and plants for assuming that the Antarctic\r\ncontinent was greatly increased in size, with promontories uniting\r\nit to Australia on the one hand and to South America on the other.\r\nNew Zealand was largely increased in area, and South Africa probably\r\nextended further polewards. The sub-antarctic islands attained a much\r\ngreater area. Conditions were ripe for the Ice Age in the southern as\r\nwell as the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Kerner von Marilaun, F. “Synthese der morphogenen Winterklimate\r\n  Europas zur Tertiärzeit.” Wien, _SitzBer.

The rivers had an increasing fall towards the\r\nsea, and rapidly carved out deep narrow valleys, which were later\r\ndeveloped by the ice into the great fiords of Norway and other\r\nheavily glaciated regions. But on the whole the first beginnings of\r\nthe Ice Age occurring towards the close of the Pliocene period are\r\nobscure, and are likely always to remain so, for the simple reason\r\nthat the advancing and retreating ice-sheets have wiped out most\r\nof the evidence of the conditions which immediately preceded their\r\nadvent. The deteriorations of the climate had begun long before the\r\ngeographical changes outlined at the close of the last chapter were\r\ncomplete, for mollusca of the Pliocene beds in East Anglia indicate\r\nprogressive refrigeration of the North Sea at the same time as it\r\nbecame increasingly shallow. At the close we have great shell-banks\r\nwith northern species which must have been piled up by powerful\r\neasterly winds; these easterly winds show that the storm-tracks\r\nhad been driven south of their present course and suggest that the\r\nglacial anticyclone already existed over Scandinavia. At the present\r\nday similar shell-banks are forming on the coast of Holland under\r\nthe influence of the prevailing westerly winds. The next series of\r\ndeposits in this region are fresh-water “forest beds,” attributed to\r\na greatly extended Rhine, and belong to the period when the North\r\nSea had become a plain.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of the plan of this work to go over the geological\r\nground of the Quaternary Ice Age, which has already been so\r\nfrequently and so efficiently covered. All I can hope to do is to\r\ngive a brief general account of the succession of climatic changes\r\ninvolved, necessarily incomplete since so much of the world is at\r\npresent insufficiently explored for glacial traces. But a certain\r\namount of explanatory introduction is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn Europe and North America there are distinct traces of several\r\nseparate glaciations with “interglacial” periods when the climate\r\napproached or became even warmer than the present. The time-relations\r\nof these glaciations are not yet fully worked out, but there seems\r\nlittle doubt that they were contemporaneous in the two continents.\r\nThe correlation is not perfect, however, since the United States\r\ngeologists recognized altogether five glaciations. The explanation\r\nappears to be that the equivalent of the Rissian glaciation in\r\nAmerica is double; two stages, the Illinoian and Iowan, being\r\nrecognizable, separated by a retreat of the ice.

The time which has\r\nelapsed since the glaciers of the last or Wurm stage were in active\r\nretreat has been estimated by comparing the growth of peat-bogs,\r\nriver-deltas, etc., during historical times with that since the last\r\nretreat of the ice. But the most conclusive method is due to the\r\nSwedish geologist Baron de Geer, who has actually counted the years\r\nsince the ice in its final retreat left any particular point between\r\nRagunda and the south of Sweden. The work is based on the idea that\r\nthe lamination observed in certain marine and lacustrine clays in\r\nSweden is seasonal, the thick coarse layers being due to the floods\r\nproduced by the rapid melting of the ice in summer, and the thinner\r\nand finer layers being due to the partial cessation of melting in\r\nwinter. By correlating one section with another it is possible to\r\ndate any particular layer with great exactness, and further to prove\r\nthe existence of several great climatic fluctuations during the\r\nretreat. The topmost limit of the section is given by the surface of\r\nthe old floor of Lake Ragunda in Jemtland, which received its waters\r\nfrom one of the permanent glaciers and was accidentally drained in\r\n1796. De Geer finds that the edge of the last great ice-sheets lay\r\nover southern Scania about 12,000 years ago, and further estimates\r\n8000 years for the retreat across the Baltic. These results are in\r\ngeneral agreement with those obtained by other methods, and we may\r\naccordingly, with some confidence, put the date when the ice-sheet of\r\nthe Wurm glaciation finally left the coast of Germany at about 18000\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\nThis period fixed, we have a datum for estimating the duration of the\r\ninterglacial periods. The moraines of the Wurm glaciation present\r\neverywhere a very fresh appearance, and the chemical change which\r\nthe boulders they contain have undergone is slight, while weathering\r\nextends to a depth of scarcely a foot. The moraines of the Riss\r\nglaciation are weathered somewhat more deeply, and those of the\r\nMindel glaciation very much more. Assuming that chemical weathering\r\nhas proceeded uniformly during the interglacial periods and ceased\r\nduring the glaciations, Penck and Brückner, who have studied\r\nexhaustively the glaciation of the Alps, find that the Riss-Wurm\r\ninterglacial lasted about three times as long as the interval between\r\nthe Wurm glaciation and the present day, or 60,000 years, and the\r\nMindel-Riss interglacial about twelve times as long, or 240,000\r\nyears. No data are available for the Gunz-Mindel interglacial, but it\r\nis provisionally made equal to the Riss-Wurm, another 60,000 years.\r\n\r\nNo possibility of such direct measurement of the duration of the\r\nglacial periods themselves has yet been found. Penck and Brückner\r\nassume that the duration equalled that of the Riss-Wurm interglacial,\r\nor 60,000 years in each case. This seems unnecessarily long. The\r\nYoldia Sea, the deepest part of which coincided with the centre of\r\nthe Scandinavian glaciation, appears to have reached its greatest\r\ndepth not more than 6000 years after the maximum of glaciation,\r\nindicating a lag of this period. The subsidence of the land due to\r\nthe weight of the ice-sheet may have commenced some time before the\r\nmaximum of glaciation, but the duration of the subsidence can hardly\r\nhave been more than 10,000 years, and this is the limit for the\r\nsecond half of the Wurm glacial period. Further, we know that during\r\nthe growth of the ice-sheets there was comparatively little melting,\r\nfor the rivers then had little power of carrying debris. Recent\r\nmeasurements in Greenland give the rate of ice-growth on the surface\r\nof the ice-sheet as 40 cm., or 15 inches a year; let us say a foot,\r\nand assume a marginal loss equivalent to half this amount over the\r\nwhole ice-sheet. This gives us an average increase of six inches a\r\nyear, or 10,000 years for growth to a maximum thickness of 5000 feet.\r\nOn these grounds the estimated duration of the Rissian glacial period\r\nhas been reduced to 30,000 years, and that of the Wurm period to\r\n22,000 years. Only in the case of the long and complicated Mindelian\r\nperiod, which, as will be seen later, was virtually a series of\r\noverlapping glaciations from various centres, has the figure of\r\n60,000 years been accepted. In the present state of our knowledge no\r\nestimate of the duration of the Gunz-Mindel interglacial can have\r\nany value, and the dates are accordingly carried back only to the\r\nMindelian. In this way we obtain the time-scale given on page 48.\r\n\r\nThe fourfold glaciation has been recognized with certainty only\r\nin Europe and North America, and even in these countries there is\r\nconsiderable doubt whether the northern ice-sheets shrank back as\r\nfar as their present narrow limits during the interglacial periods.\r\nThe long Mindel-Riss interglacial, which was probably the Chellean\r\nstage of flint industry,[3] was characterized by a very warmth-loving\r\nfauna, and it is possible, even probable, that during this period the\r\nglaciers melted completely away, except on the very highest summits.\r\nOf the climate of the Gunz-Mindel interglacial (termed by J. Geikie\r\nthe “Norfolkian,” from the Cromer Forest Bed), we have comparatively\r\nlittle evidence. If the suggestion put forward in the following\r\nchapter is correct, the Gunz-Mindel interglacial was merely a local\r\nincident in the glaciation of the Alps, and not a true interglacial\r\nat all. Even the Cromer Forest Bed itself is not conclusive, since it\r\nis a river deposit largely composed of material drifted from lower\r\nlatitudes. The Riss-Wurm interglacial (J. Geikie’s “Neudeckian”)\r\nnowhere gives us evidence of a climate as warm as the present, and as\r\nregards the Scandinavian and Canadian ice-sheets may have been merely\r\nan extensive and prolonged oscillation of the ice-edge.\r\n\r\nAs regards the glaciation of Norway, the question has been\r\ninvestigated recently by H. W. son Ahlmann, who has published a long\r\nand detailed paper in English in volumes 1 and 2 of the Swedish\r\n_Geographiska Annalen_. He concludes that the morphology of Norway,\r\nwithout reference to stratigraphical or biological data, gives\r\nconclusive evidence of two glaciations. The first of these was the\r\ngreater, and between that time and the second smaller glaciations\r\nthere occurred an interglacial period of such considerable length\r\nthat the greater part of the present gorges was then formed by\r\nfluvial erosion.\r\n\r\nWe may, accordingly, consider the Ice Age as fourfold or double,\r\naccording to the point of view from which we regard it. In the Alps\r\nand other mountain ranges on the borders of the great northern\r\nice-sheets, which respond very readily to small changes, it was\r\nfourfold. In the peripheral regions of the northern ice-sheets\r\nthemselves it has an appearance of being threefold or fourfold. In\r\nthe more central regions of these great ice-sheets, where response\r\nto climatic change is very slow, there is no evidence of more than\r\ntwo glaciations; but in these regions, where the destructive effect\r\nof the ice reached its maximum, it is only by the merest chance that\r\nevidence of interglacial periods is preserved at all. And finally, in\r\nall other parts of the world we have evidence of only two glaciations\r\nat most.\r\n\r\nThere is one deposit which is of considerable importance in the\r\nstudy of interglacial climates, and that is the loess. Loess is an\r\nexceedingly fine-grained homogeneous deposit resulting from the\r\ngradual accumulation of wind-blown dust on a surface sparsely covered\r\nwith vegetation. It is to be seen accumulating at the present day in\r\nparts of south-east Russia and central Asia. Its formation, except in\r\nclosed basins, needs a climate of the steppe character, with not much\r\nrainfall, and especially with a long dry season. Now loess was very\r\nextensively developed in Europe during the Quaternary. Its occurrence\r\nis peculiar, since it is found most widely developed resting on the\r\ndeposits of the Rissian glaciation, and is never found resting on\r\nthe moraines of the Wurm glaciation. A little loess is found below\r\nthe Riss moraines, and it has also been found between the Riss and\r\nWurm moraines. In the pre-Rissian loess an implement of Acheulian\r\nage was discovered in 1910 at Achenheim (Alsace), by R. R. Schmidt\r\nand P. Wernert, indicating that the deposit was formed towards the\r\nclose of the Chellean industry, when the climate was already cold and\r\ndry. In the same section the younger loess seems to fill completely\r\nthe Riss-Wurm interglacial, since Mousterian implements were found\r\nat the base and Aurignacian implements in the middle. The younger\r\nloess contains remains of the jerboa and other rodents at present\r\ninhabiting the Siberian steppes. It is therefore reasonable to\r\nconclude that steppe conditions prevailed in central Europe through\r\npractically the whole of the Riss-Wurm interglacial, and the same\r\nprobably applies to the corresponding pre-Wisconsin interglacial in\r\nAmerica. But if a steppe climate prevailed in central Germany there\r\nmust have been very severe conditions in Scandinavia, and probably\r\nthe ice-sheet maintained a quite considerable area there throughout\r\nthe whole period, though without encroaching on the Baltic basin. In\r\nNorth America the loess was deposited by westerly winds, indicating\r\nthat the ice-development was not sufficient to impose anticyclonic\r\nconditions in place of the present prevailing westerly winds, and the\r\nsame appears to be true of Europe. Similar climatic conditions were\r\ndeveloped for a short time at the close of the Wurm glaciation, but\r\nwithout any appreciable development of loess.

Space does not permit of\r\nany summary of the great conflict between the monoglacialists and\r\nthe polyglacialists; it is sufficient to say that the latter often\r\nwent to extremes and so laid themselves open to defeat, but the\r\ntwofold nature of the glaciation is now widely accepted. It must\r\nbe understood, however, that the following summary represents the\r\nviews of a certain section of geologists only, views which are not\r\nuniversally held. In the British Isles especially, where the remains\r\nof the maximum glaciation completely dominate those of all the\r\nothers, the theory of a single glaciation still largely prevails.\r\n\r\nWhen ice began to accumulate on the rising Scandinavian plateau\r\nit naturally formed at first on the Norwegian mountains near the\r\nAtlantic, which was the chief source of snowfall. These mountain\r\nglaciers spread rapidly down the steep seaward slopes to the west and\r\nmore slowly down the gentler landward slopes to the east. At this\r\nstage the centre of the ice-sheet, and consequently the centre of\r\nthe glacial anticyclone, as soon as the latter developed a definite\r\nexistence, lay quite near the Norwegian coast. Under anticyclonic\r\nconditions the circulation of the winds round the centre is in the\r\nsame direction as the motion of the hands of a watch, combined with\r\nan outward inclination at an angle of about thirty to forty-five\r\ndegrees. Consequently, while the centre lay in Norway, due north of\r\nthe Alps, the prevailing winds in the latter must have been from\r\nnorth-east, and therefore very cold. Accordingly, this stage is\r\nprobably contemporaneous with the Gunz glaciation of the Alps. In the\r\nsame way, over the North Sea area the winds must have been easterly,\r\ncausing the currents which piled up the great shell-banks of the East\r\nAnglian coast, already referred to as marking the end of the Tertiary\r\nand beginning of the Quaternary period.\r\n\r\nBut the ice which reached the northern North Sea broke up into\r\nicebergs not far from the coast, and floated away, while that which\r\nmoved east into the north of Sweden could only be dissipated by\r\nmelting and ablation, processes which we have reason to believe went\r\non very slowly. Hence ice began to accumulate and spread over a wide\r\narea east of the main Scandinavian mountain chain. Fresh snow was\r\ndeposited directly on this ice-surface, until it gradually overtopped\r\nthe mountains which originally gave rise to it, and reversed the\r\nflow, so that the ice actually moved uphill across the mountain\r\nchain. As the center of the ice-sheet moved eastward the glacial\r\nanticyclone moved with it, and this new position to the eastward\r\ncaused an alteration in the direction of the prevailing winds over\r\nthe rest of Europe. The Alps were now south-west of the anticyclonic\r\ncentre, and the winds in that district accordingly became easterly\r\ninstead of north-easterly. Of course, the glacial anticyclone was\r\nnow more intense, but in summer in central Europe easterly winds are\r\nnaturally so much warmer than north-easterly winds that at first this\r\nincrease in intensity was not enough to counterbalance the change in\r\ndirection, and there was a slight improvement in the Alpine climate.\r\nIn the same way, over the North Sea district the prevailing winds had\r\nnow become south-easterly instead of easterly, which would make for a\r\nslight rise of temperature, as also would the occasional depressions\r\nwhich would be able to make their way in from the westward, bringing\r\nwarm moist air from the Atlantic and occasional rainfall. By this\r\ntime the process of elevation had converted the North Sea floor into\r\nan extensive plain.\r\n\r\nFrom Sweden and the Gulf of Bothnia the ice spread out in all\r\ndirections, extending in the east to the foot of the Ural Mountains,\r\nwhich formed an independent centre of glaciation; in the south-east\r\nover a large part of European Russia, where it reached as far south\r\nas latitude 40° in the Dnieper valley; in the south over almost the\r\nwhole of Germany as far as the Riesengebirge and Harz Mountains;\r\nand in the south-east over the whole of Holland and the North Sea\r\nbasin. It should be noted that Holland and Denmark were glaciated,\r\nnot by Norwegian ice, but by ice from the Baltic sheet which had\r\ncrossed southern Sweden. The North Sea glacier extended across East\r\nAnglia as far as Cambridge, while a northern branch of it swept\r\nacross Caithness and the Orkney and Shetland Islands, but most of the\r\nBritish Isles were glaciated from independent centres—the Scottish\r\nHighlands, the Pennines, Cumberland, Wales and northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the glaciated area, and particularly with its\r\nextension south-westward across the North Sea, the Alpine climate\r\nagain became very severe, and the local glaciers and Piedmont\r\nice-sheets of the Alps reached their maximum development in the\r\nMindelian. At the same time the central plateau of France developed\r\na local plateau glacier of its own, and the Pyrenees underwent their\r\nfirst and greatest glaciation, no traces of the Gunzian having been\r\nfound in this range.\r\n\r\nThe British Isles show an interesting outward migration of the local\r\ncentres of maximum ice-development. The Scandinavian glacier which\r\ninvaded East Anglia extended arctic anticyclonic conditions across\r\nthe North Sea, and induced a heavy snowfall over the high lands of\r\nGreat Britain. These, in consequence, developed independent glaciers,\r\nwhich on their eastern sides fused with the Scandinavian glacier\r\nand, partly by deflecting its flow, partly by intercepting some of\r\nits snowfall, pushed it back into the North Sea plain. The Scottish\r\nglaciers became strong enough to encroach on Ireland, partly in the\r\nnorth-east, and partly by way of the Irish Sea and St. George’s\r\nChannel (then a valley) on to the south-east. This further extension\r\nof the cold area enabled the Irish glaciers to develop, and these\r\nin turn pushed back the Scottish glaciers until Ireland was solely\r\nglaciated by Irish ice.\r\n\r\nThe southern margin of the ice-sheet did not extend beyond the Thames\r\nvalley, but at some stage the English Channel carried floating ice,\r\nwhich formed the deposits of ice-borne boulders, of which that at\r\nSelsey is a well-known example.\r\n\r\nThis great ice-sheet nowhere formed marked terminal moraines, but its\r\ndeposits fade away in thin beds of stiff boulder-clay. This absence\r\nof moraines is probably connected with the great thickness of the\r\nice-sheets, which did not leave any appreciable nunataks or rocky\r\n“islands” exposed in its path, so that there was nothing to give\r\nrise to detritus on the surface of the ice. All the transportation\r\nhad to be carried on beneath the ice-sheets, and these, penetrating\r\ninto comparatively low latitudes where the sun is powerful in summer,\r\nwould suffer gradual melting and ablation for some distance from\r\ntheir margins. Near the actual ice-limit the motion must have been\r\nslow and the thickness of the ice small, so that conditions were\r\nagainst the accumulation of thick beds of detritus.\r\n\r\nOn the borders of the ice-sheet the climate cannot have been\r\nover-rigorous, for pre-Chellean man was able to live almost up to the\r\nice-edge. The air must have been extremely cold, and there was a belt\r\nof high arctic climate round the ice, but in the south and south-west\r\nthis appears to have been very narrow, and sub-arctic conditions,\r\nno worse than those in which many races live to-day, prevailed not\r\nvery far from the ice. The configuration of the ice-surface largely\r\nexplains this. A high steeply sloping wall of ice causes intensely\r\nviolent winds, carrying dense clouds of drift-snow—blizzards, in\r\nfact, similar to those now experienced in parts of Antarctica under\r\nsimilar circumstances, which sweep the land bare of all life for a\r\nconsiderable distance. But a low and gradually sloping surface, such\r\nas seems to have existed near the borders of the maximum glaciation,\r\nfavours instead comparatively gentle winds without much drift snow.\r\nIt is only on the north-west ice-ridge, where ice-cliffs fronted\r\nthe sea and where severe storms from the Atlantic were frequent in\r\nwinter, that blizzards occurred.\r\n\r\nWhen the land in Scandinavia began to sink under the ice-load more\r\nrapidly than the supply of snow could build up the surface of the\r\nice-sheet the force which pushed out the ice in all directions from\r\nthe centre gradually died away, and the ice-masses over the North\r\nSea area—now probably again below sea-level—and the low grounds of\r\nEurope were left derelict, with no resources but the snowfall on\r\ntheir own surfaces. Under these conditions they melted away more\r\nor less rapidly. While these derelict ice-masses were still large,\r\nthe auxiliary peripheral centres in the Alps, Pyrenees and British\r\nIsles maintained an independent existence for a while, probably with\r\nfluctuations similar to those which marked the close of the last\r\nglaciation in the Alps, though the evidence of these has now been\r\nwiped away. It is even likely that the beginnings of the weakening\r\nof the central source of supply helped the British ice to divert the\r\nScandinavian ice into the North Sea. Had there been any powerful\r\nrivers bearing great masses of detritus from the south, as there\r\nare in Siberia, some of these derelict ice-sheets might have been\r\npreserved for a time, at least, as “fossil ice,” but in western\r\nEurope conditions were not favourable for this.\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance of the ice-sheets the general climate of\r\nEurope must have passed through a series of stages of amelioration,\r\nof which traces can be found here and there, though the details\r\nare lost to us. Ultimately temperate conditions again prevailed;\r\nand for a very long time, approaching a quarter of a million years,\r\nEurope cannot have differed greatly from present climatic conditions.\r\nIn Scandinavia the mammoth roamed in forests of birch, pine and\r\nspruce; further south the mammoth is absent, and we find instead more\r\nsouthern forms—_Elephas antiquus_, resembling the Indian elephant,\r\n_Rhinoceros merckii_, a southern form, the sabre-toothed tiger,\r\ncave-lion, cave-bear and cave-hyæna, wolf, beaver, horse and various\r\nforms of deer, while the flora included even such warmth-loving trees\r\nas the fig. Obviously, during part of this interglacial period, the\r\nclimate must have been even warmer than the present.\r\n\r\nLet us glance for a moment at the probable conditions. One of\r\nthe dominant features in the present weather of Europe is the\r\naccumulation of floating ice in the Arctic basin. This keeps the\r\ntemperature low and the pressure high—forms in fact during the spring\r\nand summer months a temporary glacial anticyclone similar in kind\r\nto, though of less intensity than, that which has been described as\r\ncovering the Scandinavian ice-sheet. This anticyclone maintains on\r\nits southern edges a belt of easterly winds, and these winds enter\r\ninto the general circulation of the earth. Their effect is to push\r\nsouthward the permanent storm-centres normally situated near Iceland\r\nand the Aleutian Islands, and it is these storm-centres which play\r\na large part in causing the rainy weather of northern and central\r\nEurope. But occasionally—as in the remarkable spring and summer of\r\n1921—these conditions break down. The Arctic Ocean becomes unusually\r\nice-free and warm, the pressure falls, and in consequence the\r\nstorm-centres move northward. Europe comes under the influence of\r\nthe permanent anticyclones of sub-tropical latitudes, rain-bearing\r\nstorms pass far to the northward, and we have a dry warm summer of\r\nthe Mediterranean type.\r\n\r\nThis is presumably what happened during the long warm Mindel-Riss\r\ninterglacial. For some reason, possibly connected with a temporary\r\nwidening and deepening of the Bering Strait, the waters of the Arctic\r\nOcean became warmer and the amount of floating ice less. Pressure\r\nbecame lower in the polar basin and therefore higher over the\r\nAtlantic and Europe, and fine warm conditions prevailed in Europe as\r\nthe normal climate instead of only as an occasional event.\r\n\r\nThis warm interval was finally brought to a close by the renewed\r\nelevation of Scandinavia, and the ice-sheets began to develop again,\r\nheralded by a period of dry steppe climate. This time, however, the\r\nconditions were different; the elevation was not so great, and was\r\nmore local. Hence the resulting glaciation was less intense; it\r\nfilled the Baltic basin and extended some distance on to the North\r\nGerman plain and into Holland. It failed to reach the coast of\r\nBritain, but that it extended some way across the North Sea plain is\r\nindicated by the peculiar distribution of the Newer Drift of Britain,\r\nto be referred to later. In the north of Norway the slope of the ice\r\ntowards the sea was very steep, so that many of the coastal hills\r\nextended above it as nunataks. The ice extended into the channel\r\nbetween the mainland and the Lofoten Islands (then a peninsula), but\r\naccording to Ahlmann these islands were an independent centre of\r\nlocal glaciation, as the British Isles had been during the preceding\r\nperiod, and the local ice met the main ice-sheet in the fiords. On\r\nthe coast of Nordland sufficient land lay bare to harbour a small\r\nArctic flora, and Vaero, the southernmost island of Lofoten, had only\r\nsmall hanging snow-banks.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the British glacial deposits is still very\r\nmuch under discussion, but it seems probable that the Scottish\r\nhighlands formed a subsidiary centre which glaciated the whole of\r\nScotland and north-east England, sending a stream south-eastward,\r\nwhich was prevented from spreading across the North Sea plain by\r\nthe presence of Scandinavian ice to the east and impinged on the\r\ncoast of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, just reaching the northern\r\nextremity of Norfolk. Many British geologists regard this development\r\nas the concluding phase of a single glaciation of Britain, but the\r\ndifferences in the amount of weathering undergone are against such\r\nan interpretation. At the same time there were local glaciers in\r\nCumberland, Wales and Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn England limits of this glaciation are characterized by a\r\nwell-marked series of end-moraines, which indicate that the ice\r\ncarried much surface detritus, and probably ended in a steep cliff.\r\nIn Scandinavia, on the other hand, the centre of glaciation again\r\nlay over the low ground well to the east of the mountains, and the\r\nice which reached Germany and Denmark was still largely free of\r\nsurface detritus, and so did not form marked end-moraines. There\r\nwas a difference, however. On this occasion, owing to the local\r\nnature of the elevation in Scandinavia, the ice-sheet did not extend\r\nits borders so far to the eastward, and the glaciation of Asia, as\r\ndescribed in Chapter VII, was slight. Europe came more under the\r\ninfluence of cold north-easterly and northerly winds, and life on\r\nthe ice-borders was not so easy as during the preceding glaciation.\r\nMan could still live near the ice, but he took to making his home in\r\ncaves, and to clothing himself in skins for warmth.\r\n\r\nAfter the ice had reached its Rissian maximum of glaciation the\r\nclimate improved somewhat. The ice-edge retreated, leaving Denmark\r\nand the German coast, and vacating the Baltic basin, but not\r\ndisappearing altogether from Scandinavia. At Rixdorf, near Berlin,\r\nthere is a bed of gravel deposited in this “interglacial,” containing\r\nnumerous and well-preserved bones of the mammoth, woolly rhinoceros,\r\naurochs, bison, horse, reindeer, red deer and other species of\r\n_Cervus_, musk ox and wolf—a cold temperate to sub-arctic fauna.\r\nIn south Germany fresh-water mollusca indicate that the summers in\r\nthat district were almost as warm as at present, but the winters\r\nwere probably severe. As described in the preceding chapter this\r\n“interglacial” was the time of loess formation _par excellence_, with\r\na continental climate and steppe conditions over much of central\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nInvestigations at Skærumhede in Denmark show that this recession of\r\nthe ice was accompanied by, and presumably due to, a fall in the\r\nlevel of the land relatively to that of the sea, for at the beginning\r\nof the oscillation the land lay about 350 feet above its present\r\nlevel, sinking gradually to only 30 feet above present. Even at its\r\nbest during this interglacial the climate was almost sub-arctic in\r\nDenmark. In northern Finland, on the eastern edge of the ice-sheet,\r\nthere was also an “interglacial,” with a slight improvement in the\r\nclimate accompanying a temporary submergence. But in Scandinavia\r\nthere are no traces of any interglacial deposits of this period, and\r\nconsidering the cold climates which prevailed in Denmark and North\r\nGermany, it seems probable that Scandinavia continued to be glaciated\r\nduring the whole period.\r\n\r\nThe mode of life among Mousterian men, who lived during this\r\n“interglacial,” also points to a severe climate. For at this time man\r\ndid not live in the open, but in caves and rock-shelters, and the\r\npractice of wearing the fur skins of animals as a protection against\r\nthe cold, begun in the preceding Rissian glacial period, was not\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nAfter the temporary subsidence had ceased, elevation again set in,\r\ncausing a readvance of the ice-sheets and glaciers. The limits fell\r\nshort of those of the preceding maximum, and the climate was not\r\nso severe, but in its general character it resembled that of the\r\npreceding maximum, but was much stormier, and there were probably\r\nfrequent blizzards of the Antarctic type, carrying drift-snow. The\r\nnew ice-sheet carried more surface detritus than its predecessors,\r\npresumably because all the high ground was not covered, and it\r\nformed high terminal moraines. The close association of cold ice\r\nand irregular masses of bare sand and stones, strongly heated by the\r\nsummer sun, set up a belt of powerful convection very favourable for\r\nthe development of blizzards; possibly there was something in the\r\nnature of an ice-cliff down which the cold winds could blow with\r\ngreat strength. At any rate, man found the near neighbourhood of\r\nthe ice unpleasant, and went, so that there are no contemporaneous\r\nhuman implements near the moraines. The limits of the Scandinavian\r\nice-sheet ran from the Norwegian coast across Denmark from north\r\nto south, through North Germany and northern Russia, and included\r\nFinland. The ice probably did not extend far across the North Sea\r\nplain, and in the British Isles there was no ice-sheet, but the high\r\nmountains of Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cumberland bore small\r\nlocal glaciers, which were long enough to reach the sea in the\r\nScottish highlands. The Alps bore considerable glaciers, indicating\r\na depression of the snow-line of about 3500 feet, corresponding to a\r\ntemperature 11° F. lower than the present.\r\n\r\nAfter this ice-development had reached its maximum limits and\r\nremained there for perhaps a thousand years, retreat set in, and\r\nthe Scandinavian ice once more withdrew from Germany and Denmark to\r\nthe Baltic basin. But its edge was never far from the German coast,\r\nand occasionally readvanced across it, for numerous fossiliferous\r\ndeposits are intercalated in boulder-clay. The fauna and flora, which\r\nare well known, point to an arctic climate. At its best the mean\r\ntemperature of July rose to about 50° F., and there was a vegetation\r\nperiod of three or four months with an average temperature of about\r\n40° F., but these relatively mild conditions lasted at most for a few\r\ndecades or perhaps a century at a time, and the winters were severe\r\nthroughout. The duration of the whole of this “Baltic Interstadial”\r\nwas from one to two thousand years.\r\n\r\nNext followed the final readvance of the ice forming the great\r\n“Baltic” moraines which fringe the Baltic coast of Germany, turning\r\nnorthward in the west into Denmark and in the east into Finland.\r\nThere was a corresponding re-development of glaciers in the Alps\r\n(Bühl stage) and in the mountains of Ireland and Scotland, though\r\nthese probably failed to reach the sea even in Scotland. This period\r\ngave us a repetition of the climate of the preceding maxima. In this\r\ncase we have definite evidence of the presence of a belt of easterly\r\nwinds on the southern side of the ice-sheet, in a series of “barkans”\r\nor fossil dunes in Holland, Germany and Galicia. These dunes were\r\nformed of fine ice-deposited material, and they are crescent-shaped,\r\nwith their convexities to the east, indicating that they were built\r\nby strong easterly winds. A moment’s consideration will show the\r\ntruth of the latter statement. Suppose there is an isolated round\r\nhillock of sand exposed to strong easterly winds. The sand grains\r\nwill travel up the easterly windward slope of the hillock and roll\r\ndown the westerly leeward side. In this way the whole hillock will\r\nadvance very slowly westwards. But in the centre, where the hillock\r\nreaches its greatest height, the grains will take longer to reach\r\nthe highest point than near the edges, where they have not to rise\r\nso high. At the edges a strong gust will carry some of the heavier\r\ngrains right over the dune, while nearer the centre they will be left\r\nhalf-way, and when the gust ceases will perhaps roll back to their\r\noriginal position. In this way the margins of the dune will advance\r\nwestward more rapidly than the centre, producing the crescent shape\r\nwith the convex side to the east. At the time of their formation\r\nthese dunes must have had their steepest side to the westward, but\r\nthe westerly winds which have prevailed during the last few thousand\r\nyears have succeeded in modifying that detail, without destroying\r\nthe general shape of the dunes, and the steepest slopes are now on\r\nthe eastern side. The preservation of the original shape, in spite\r\nof the subsequent development of westerly winds, is due in part to\r\nthe coating of vegetation, which protected the dunes as soon as more\r\nfavourable conditions occurred, and probably in part to the lesser\r\nvelocity of the westerlies. If the period of east winds and dune\r\nformation had been long enough, we might have had another deposit of\r\nloess, but it was short, and vegetation, which is necessary to the\r\ngenesis of true loess, had no time to establish itself before the\r\nclimate changed again with the final retreat of the ice. The climate\r\nof this period in Rumania has been ably described by G. Murgoci:\r\n“In general the prevailing climate of the time of the formation of\r\nloessoid soils and blown sands must have been that which is named by\r\nE. de Martonne the aralian climate, a dry climate with some rain in\r\nspring to call forth a poor and transient vegetation and to maintain\r\nthe flowing water in rivers and lakes. The temperature with great\r\nextremes, in summer up to 120° F. and in winter below 20° F., was the\r\ncharacteristic of this climate; the atmosphere was very dry in the\r\nhot season, but in the rest of the year there was some humidity in\r\nthe air and moisture in the soil, the water of the subsoil being not\r\nvery deep. The atmospheric precipitation in this region was caused\r\nby the south-west wind just as at present; but the dominant wind\r\ngiving the character of a dry continental climate was the north-east\r\nwind (Crivat) which has left its traces in the fossil dunes of the\r\nBaragan.”\r\n\r\nA history of the changes of climate in Europe which followed the\r\nmaximum of the last readvance of the ice-sheet must be left to later\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Brooks, C.

Most of what we do know relates to\r\nthe relatively brief periods of submergence.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Glacial period the sea lay some 500 feet\r\nabove its present level, and we can trace the first appearance of a\r\nnorthern marine fauna. This stage is known as the Calabrian; it is\r\ndivided into two horizons—a lower, in which northern forms are still\r\nrare, and an upper, in which they are becoming abundant. The most\r\ntypical species are two mollusca whose present habitat is the coast\r\nof Iceland—_Chlamys (Pecten) islandicus_ and _Cyprina islandica_.\r\n\r\nThe Calabrian beach is not found on the coast of Spain or at\r\nGibraltar, and in Algeria it probably occurs at a lower level. This\r\nsuggests that the subsidence at this period was local, and the\r\nwestern lands stood up as a barrier against the Atlantic. There\r\nmust have been a channel of some sort, however, on the site of the\r\npresent Straits of Gibraltar, to provide an inlet for the immigrating\r\nnorthern mollusca. In the Maritime Alps, and again in the eastern\r\nMediterranean, the Calabrian beaches are at a much greater height\r\nowing to local elevation.\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of the Calabrian beach the whole Mediterranean\r\nregion was elevated above its present level. This elevation must be\r\ncontemporaneous with the period of maximum elevation in north-west\r\nEurope associated with the great Mindelian glaciation. It is\r\nsuggested that the “sill” of the outlet channel at Gibraltar was\r\nraised above the level of the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean became,\r\nfirst a closed salt lake, and then a pair of lakes, the eastern fresh\r\ndraining into the western, which was salt, the two being separated\r\nby a ridge of land between Italy and Tunis. This period of elevation\r\nwas long enough for a great deal of denudation to take place. Even in\r\nthe Mediterranean this was a time of severe climate. On the eastern\r\nside of Gibraltar there are breccias, known as the “Older Limestone\r\nAgglomerate,” which reach a thickness of 100 feet in places, and are\r\nnow much weathered. Similar agglomerates are found in Malta. These\r\nresemble the “head” of the south of England, and appear to be due\r\nto frost action in a severe climate. In Corsica there are traces of\r\nfour periods of mountain glaciation, and the two oldest of these are\r\nprovisionally correlated with the Gunzian and Mindelian of the Alps.\r\nIn the Balkan highlands there are traces of two distinct glaciations:\r\nthe older, which was the more general and reached the greater\r\nintensity, probably corresponding to the Mindelian. In the Atlas\r\nMountains there are great boulder moraines which seem to belong to\r\nthree distinct glaciations, the oldest extending to about 2000 feet\r\nabove sea-level, and the second terminating at about 4000 feet, while\r\nthe third glaciation consisted of small valley glaciers only.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the Mindelian glacial period the land sank or\r\nthe ocean rose again, and the waters of the Atlantic poured in,\r\nbringing with them a great number of high northern and Arctic\r\nmollusca. The theory has been put forward that this influx was in the\r\nnature of a debacle and carved out a deep gorge through the present\r\nStraits of Gibraltar. The beaches deposited by this sea lie at a\r\nheight of 250 to 330 feet above the present sea-level. The fauna\r\nresembles that inhabiting the northernmost parts of Europe at the\r\npresent day, and the waters must have been several degrees colder\r\nthan at present. This stage is termed the Sicilian.\r\n\r\nAs the climate improved the land gradually rose again, and the\r\nnext general raised beach lies at a height of only about 100 feet\r\nin southern Italy (except where it has been elevated by local\r\nearth-movements). Further west it lies still nearer the present\r\nsea-level—twenty feet in the Balearic Islands and only seven feet on\r\nthe coast of Spain. On the coast of Algeria and Tunis this beach is\r\nfound at a height of about forty-five feet.\r\n\r\nThe beach contains no trace of the northern fauna found in the\r\nSicilian stage; instead it is marked by an assemblage of mollusca\r\nof a sub-tropical aspect, including _Strombus bubonius_, _Mytilus\r\nsenegalensis_ and _Cardita senegalensis_. The bones of large mammals\r\nare also found, including the hippopotamus and southern forms of\r\nelephant (_E. antiquus_) and rhinoceros (_Rh. merckii_). This warm\r\nstage corresponds to the Chellean interglacial fauna of northern\r\nEurope, though so far as I am aware no Chellean implements have been\r\nfound associated with it.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Older Limestone Agglomerate of Gibraltar had\r\nbeen worn into caves, in which are found the bones of ibex, wild\r\nboar, leopard, spotted hyena, _Rhinocerus leptorhinus_, _Elephas\r\nmeridionalis_, lion, southern lynx, bear, wolf, stag, horse, etc.,\r\nso that the rock must have been covered by a rich vegetation, and\r\nmust have had a greater extent than now, and a connexion with\r\nthe continent of Africa. This is said to have been followed by a\r\nsubmergence of about 700 feet with numerous oscillations. This\r\nsubmergence, if it is really attributable to the interglacial, must\r\nhave been extremely local, and possibly it is much older.\r\n\r\nAfter the warm Chellean period the Mediterranean region rose again,\r\nprobably contemporaneously with the rise which caused the Rissian\r\nglaciation of northern Europe. But the climate was nothing like\r\nso severe as in the Sicilian. We have no old beaches containing a\r\nmolluscan fauna of this period, but at the Grotte au Prince near\r\nMentone, investigated by M. Boule, the _Strombus_ beach is overlain\r\nby a bed of cemented pebbles and “hearths” containing Mousterian\r\nimplements and bones of a temperate fauna. The Newer Limestone\r\nAgglomerate on the east of Gibraltar may have been formed during this\r\nperiod. The Mediterranean lands remained above their present level\r\nuntil the close of the Glacial period.\r\n\r\nEach glaciation of northern Europe must have been a time of greater\r\nrainfall as well as of lower temperature in the Mediterranean. The\r\nglacial anticyclone in the north displaced the storms from the\r\nAtlantic, which now mostly either skirt the north-west coast of\r\nNorway or pass across Denmark into the Baltic. These storms had\r\nto take a more southerly course, and entered the Mediterranean\r\nbasin either across the south of France or in the neighbourhood of\r\nGibraltar: tracks which are still occasionally followed in winter.\r\nThese storms brought a rainfall much heavier than the present, and\r\nof a different character. The Mediterranean is now a “winter rain\r\nregion,” and the north of Africa is entirely rainless for several\r\nmonths in the summer. But during the “Pluvial periods” it is probable\r\nthat rain fell throughout the year, though the winter still had more\r\nthan the summer. The winter rains were in the form of steady falls\r\nof long duration, such as we experience now in England, while the\r\nsummer rains fell in short, heavy showers, perhaps accompanied by\r\nthunder. The Older Pluvial period, which corresponds to the Mindelian\r\nglaciation, had these conditions in their greatest development.\r\nDepressions cannot live long without a supply of moisture, either\r\nfrom the sea or from transpiring vegetation, and at present such\r\nwinter storms as enter the Mediterranean are almost confined to its\r\nsurface, and on the African side rarely penetrate more than one\r\nhundred miles inland. But at the period of greatest elevation the\r\nshrunken Mediterranean offered no such great attraction, and with a\r\ncomparatively well-watered Sahara the storms were able to pass much\r\nfurther south. Consequently, northern Africa possessed a number of\r\nlarge and permanent rivers which reached the sea. It was along these\r\nrivers and their banks that the fauna still inhabiting the Saharan\r\noases made its way, to be isolated there by the decrease of the\r\nrainfall, so that crocodiles and many species of fish now live in\r\nisolated pools and in rivers which lose themselves in the sand.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt and Syria the first Pluvial period is double, corresponding\r\nto the Gunz and Mindel glaciations, with an intervening phase of\r\nfeeble desert conditions, during which, however, the rainfall\r\nremained greater than the present. The second stage, corresponding to\r\nthe Mindelian, indicates very great activity; at this time the Jordan\r\nSea (Dead Sea) reached its greatest area, extending to the northern\r\nend of the Sea of Tiberias.\r\n\r\nConditions in Egypt at this time are very interesting. South of Cairo\r\nthe alluvial Nile muds are at most thirty to thirty-five feet thick,\r\nand ten feet of this thickness has been deposited since the time of\r\nRamesis II. If the rate of deposition has been uniform, this gives a\r\nperiod of only 14,000 years for the deposition of the whole thickness\r\nof the muds. The theory put forward by Hume and Craig (British\r\nAssociation Report, 1911, p. 382) is briefly as follows: The mud\r\ndeposits of the Nile valley are carried down with the flood waters\r\nof the Blue Nile, Atbara, etc. These rivers rise in the highlands\r\nof Abyssinia, where they are fed by the rains of the south-west\r\nmonsoon. The incidence of the monsoon is determined by a number of\r\nfactors, prominent among which is the temperature of southern Asia.\r\nDuring the winter, at present, the low temperature of the Himalayan\r\nand Tibetan region results in a great outflow of cold air, which\r\nstrikes the coast of Africa as the cool dry north-east monsoon.\r\nDuring this time there is very little rain in Abyssinia. It is only\r\nwhen the Asiatic land-mass warms up in summer that the south-west\r\nmonsoon is established.\r\n\r\nBut during the Glacial period, as we shall see, there was a great\r\ndevelopment of snow and ice on the Himalayas. The result was that\r\nwinter conditions, i.e. the north-east monsoon, prevailed more\r\nor less throughout the year, and the rivers which feed the Nile\r\ncontained only a small volume of water. Hence they lost themselves in\r\nthe desert before reaching Cairo, and the Nile in its present form\r\ndid not exist. On the other hand, the westerly winds which at present\r\nbring a moderate winter rainfall to the coast of Syria were greatly\r\nincreased in intensity and extended further south, replacing the dry\r\nnorth and south winds now occupying the Nile valley. The northerly\r\nwinds prevailing in the Nile valley in summer are associated with\r\nthe low pressure area over the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf,\r\nwhich in turn is due to the extremely high temperature experienced\r\nthere. Even at the present day the highest hills of Sinai penetrate\r\nabove the north winds into a westerly current, and a moderate fall\r\nof temperature over the Persian Gulf would inhibit the north winds\r\nin the Nile valley altogether and allow the westerly winds to reach\r\nthe surface. These strong westerly winds brought a heavy rainfall\r\nto the hills, now almost rainless, between the Nile and the Red\r\nSea. Powerful streams descended the western slopes of these hills,\r\nbringing great quantities of debris, which formed delta-terraces\r\nforty of fifty feet thick where the streams debouched on to the\r\nEgyptian plain. These are especially well developed at Oina, the\r\nmeeting place of several dry valleys from the hills, and it is\r\nremarkable that they actually cross the present site of the Nile\r\nvalley and reach the desert on its western side, additional evidence\r\nthat the Nile was not then in existence.\r\n\r\nThese gravel terraces contain numerous stone implements of early\r\n(pre-Chellean) types, showing that at this time Egypt had sufficient\r\nrainfall of its own to support human life.\r\n\r\nThe moist westerly winds carried the climate of the Mediterranean\r\ncoast far into the desert. For instance, in the oasis of Khargeh, in\r\nlatitude 25°, grew the evergreen oak and other plants not now found\r\nsouth of Corsica and southern France.\r\n\r\nThe Mindelian Pluvial period was followed by a long dry period\r\ncorresponding to the Chellean, when desert conditions supervened. The\r\nNile as we know it first appeared during this period. Terraces were\r\nformed on the sides of the valley, probably during the submergence\r\nwhich produced the _Strombus_ beaches of the western Mediterranean;\r\nthese contain Chellean implements. During the succeeding elevation\r\nthe Nile cut its bed below the present level.\r\n\r\nThe Rissian glaciation of northern Europe is represented in Egypt by\r\na second rainy period, the Lesser Pluvial period. Rain again fell\r\non the Red Sea hills, forming a newer set of gravel terraces, but\r\nthese are much smaller than the great Mindelian terraces. No terraces\r\nare known representing the Wurmian period, and the country does not\r\nseem to have been inhabited at this time. Probably the climate was\r\nsemi-desert, with not enough rainfall of its own to support human\r\nlife, and yet without the fertilizing Nile floods to enable human\r\nlife to exist without rainfall. As has been said, the present regime\r\ndid not begin until the last glaciation was nearly over, about 12,000\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Gignoux, M. “Les formations marines pliocènes et quaternaires de\r\n  l’Italie du Sud et de la Sicilie.” _Ann. l’Univ.

These movements left a number of great basins\r\nclosed in on all sides by enormous mountain walls; at first all these\r\nbasins contained lakes, and the subsequent geographical history has\r\nconsisted largely in the gradual silting up of the lakes and the\r\ndevelopment of more and more arid conditions. The fluctuations of the\r\nIce Age were superposed on this secular desiccation, but except in\r\nnorthern Siberia the part played by glaciation in the history of the\r\ncountry has been relatively small.\r\n\r\nConsider for a moment the relief of Asia. The orographic centre may\r\nbe taken as the great Pamir plateau, the “Roof of the World,” with\r\nan average elevation exceeding the height of Mont Blanc, diversified\r\nby ranges of mountains exceeding 25,000 feet in places. East of this\r\nis the great plateau of Tibet, 10,000 to 17,000 feet, bounded on the\r\nsouth by the mighty Himalayas, and on the north by the mountains\r\nof Kuen Lun. On the north the Pamir plateau is bounded by the Alai\r\nrange, passing north-east into the Tian-Shan mountains, rising to\r\n24,000 feet in Khan-tengri. Still further north-east comes the Altai\r\nrange, with an elevation of 9000 feet. East of Lake Baikal lie a\r\nseries of ranges averaging 8000 feet in height, and passing into the\r\nStanovoi range of eastern Siberia and the mountains of Kamchatka.\r\n\r\nThe Himalayas, owing to their heavy snowfall derived from the\r\nsouth-west monsoon, bear numerous great glaciers, but with the series\r\nof ranges extending from the Pamirs to north-east Siberia the case is\r\ndifferent. These ranges all rise above the snow-line in places, but\r\nowing to the scanty snowfall they bear at most a few small glaciers\r\non their northern sides, and none at all on the slopes which face\r\ntowards the deserts of western China, and in all cases the glaciation\r\nis very slight in comparison with their elevation.\r\n\r\nThis distribution was characteristic also of the Ice Age. In the\r\nPamirs there is evidence of two periods when the glaciers had a\r\ngreater extent; in the first they extended to a level of 5000 feet,\r\nin the second to 7000 feet. The present limit of the glaciers lies at\r\nabout 10,000 feet. The first glaciation was remote, for the moraines\r\nare worn and weathered, but the second was much more recent, for\r\nthe moraines are fresh, and in some cases there are still masses\r\nof “dead” ice buried beneath great accumulations of debris and\r\noccasionally exposed by slips.\r\n\r\nIn the Tian-Shan mountains there are remains of two glaciations.\r\nThe earlier was the greater, and the glaciers descended well below\r\n10,000 feet. This glaciation was followed by a long interval, when\r\nthe erosion of the rivers converted the U-shaped glacial valleys into\r\nV-shaped gorges. A second glaciation descended to a level of 10,000\r\nfeet, and again developed U-valleys to this level; the end-moraines\r\nof these glaciers are young and fresh-looking. In the Altai range\r\nthere were also two glacial periods. In the older and greater the\r\nsnow-line was depressed by 3000 feet. The glaciers attained a length\r\nof twelve miles and descended to a level of only 3000 feet above the\r\nsea. The second glaciation was less extensive.\r\n\r\nSo far we have been dealing with small mountain glaciers only. But\r\nin north-eastern Siberia we find a different state of affairs. The\r\nStanovoi and Verkhoiansk mountains were heavily glaciated, and during\r\nthe first glaciation were probably the centre of an actual ice-sheet\r\nsimilar to that of Scandinavia. The ice descended the valleys of\r\nthe rivers Yana, Indijirka and Kolyma and covered the New Siberian\r\nIslands, which were at that time connected with the mainland. The\r\nupper valley of the Lena was also heavily glaciated by an ice-sheet\r\nmoving southward, probably from the Patom highlands. When this\r\nglaciation drew to a close the source of supply among the mountains\r\nceased, and the ice on the lowlands and in the lower parts of the\r\nriver valleys was left stranded as “dead” ice. When the mountains\r\nbecame free of ice, the re-born rivers carried great quantities of\r\nmoraine-clay and other debris with them, and flooding the ice-surface\r\nover wide areas deposited their load above the ice. In course of\r\ntime the remains of the ice-sheet were deeply covered by a layer of\r\nearth and stones, which prevented the ice from melting and preserved\r\nit to the present day. This is the probable origin of the well-known\r\n“fossil ice” of Siberia. Other theories have been put forward, such\r\nas the freezing of ground water during the winter, but none are\r\nsatisfactory, and that given here was generally adopted by Russian\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nDuring the long warm interglacial which followed, the surface of the\r\nthick earth-layer covering the ice bore low-growing herbage in the\r\nsame way as any other earth-surface. (A parallel to this is found\r\nin Alaska, where the glaciers terminate among the forests, which\r\nactually grow over the moraines covering their snouts.) The rivers\r\ncut their way down through the earth and ice, exposing ice-cliffs,\r\nwhich were quickly buried by talus from above. The mammoth and\r\nwoolly rhinoceros roamed the land, and their tusks remain in great\r\nnumbers as the “fossil ivory” of Siberia and the Arctic Ocean. Still\r\nmore remarkable is the fact that mammoths have been found buried\r\nentire, and preserved by the frozen ground to the present day. It is\r\ndifficult to say how the animals reached such a position, but most\r\nprobably they sank into swamps formed during the summer and were\r\nquickly frozen.\r\n\r\nIn western Europe the mammoth and woolly rhinoceros are regarded as\r\nindications of severe climate, but their presence in north-eastern\r\nSiberia in large numbers is evidence of a climate probably somewhat\r\nwarmer than that of the present day, especially as regards the length\r\nof the vegetation period. Probably the winter snowfall also was less\r\nthan now. It is difficult to see how the fauna could have moved from,\r\nsay, the New Siberian islands into a warmer climate each winter, for\r\nthe winter climate becomes markedly more severe as one penetrates\r\nsouth from the Arctic coast into the interior. It is possible that\r\nthe mammoth and woolly rhinoceros hibernated during the winter.\r\n\r\nAfter this interglacial there came a recrudescence of glacial\r\nconditions. In this case, however, the Stanovoi and Verkhoiansk\r\nmountains and the Patom highlands were not buried in an ice-sheet,\r\nbut became the centre of great valley glaciers, which reproduced the\r\nwell-known glacial phenomena—corries, glacial terraces, U-valleys,\r\netc. The ice extended down the great river valleys, leaving a typical\r\nmoraine landscape on either side, and again reached the New Siberian\r\nislands. In course of time the climate ameliorated, again commencing\r\nin the south, and again the ice of the glaciers was buried. In the\r\nNew Siberian islands the happenings are summarized very expressively\r\nby a rock-section described by Vollossovitsch. The bottom of the\r\nsection is formed by the older layer of “fossil ice.” Above this is\r\na sandy clay with remains of meadow vegetation and shrubs, followed\r\nby a fine clay with remains of alder and white birch, and the bones\r\nof mammoth and rhinoceros. Above this comes another layer of “fossil\r\nice,” followed by clay with the dwarf birch, Arctic willow, and bones\r\nof musk ox, horse and later mammoth. After this the coastal regions\r\nsank beneath the sea for a time and marine clays were formed in a\r\nclimate somewhat warmer than the present. When the land rose again\r\nthe conditions resembled those now prevailing.\r\n\r\nThough not part of Asia, reference may be made here to the\r\nglaciation of Spitzbergen, which runs strictly parallel with that of\r\nnorthern Siberia. The first glaciation was of the “ice-sheet” type,\r\noriginating in the region north of Storfjiord, filling the whole\r\nof that fiord and extending south of South Cape. Barentz Land and\r\nStans Foreland were at least partially ice-covered. The ice-floor of\r\nSpitzbergen, which resembles that of Siberia, may have originated\r\nduring this glaciation. This was followed by subsidence to 230\r\nfeet below present level, and the ice retreated, giving place to\r\nan “interglacial,” during which frost was very active and largely\r\nobliterated the traces of the ice-sheet. This “interglacial” was\r\nfollowed by a second extension of the ice, which affected the valleys\r\nand fiords only, leaving the plateaux free. This again was followed\r\nby subsidence and a warm period.\r\n\r\nIn southern Kamchatka there was a great development of ice, but\r\nin the form of a network of glaciers rather than of an inland\r\nice-sheet. In the east the ice reached the sea, but on the west it\r\nleft a zone forty to sixty miles broad, and up to a thousand feet\r\nhigh unglaciated, so that there was the same difference then as now\r\nbetween the rainy east side and the drier west side of the peninsula.\r\nThe present snow-line in the centre of southern Kamchatka is about\r\n5500 feet, and at the maximum of the glaciation it must have been\r\nfully 3000 feet lower.\r\n\r\nThis glaciation was followed after an interval by a second, which was\r\nconfined to the mountains. The moraines of this glaciation are much\r\nfresher than are those of the earlier one.\r\n\r\nIn Japan the mountains were only just high enough for glaciers to\r\ndevelop in the north. The moraines are old and weathered, and their\r\nmeaning has been disputed; but recent work by Simotomai and Oseki\r\nseems to have established their glacial origin. The depression of the\r\nsnow-line necessary to produce them—about 3000 feet—fits in very well\r\nwith that observed in adjoining parts of the continent. The phenomena\r\nwere confined to small hanging glaciers in the Hida mountains which\r\ncut out corries and descended to a level of about 8000 feet, leaving\r\nsmall morainic ridges. This glaciation was probably contemporaneous\r\nwith the earlier and greater glaciation of Siberia. To the succeeding\r\ninterglacial may be attributed the marine deposits found near Tokio\r\ncontaining corals, at present living some distance further south. No\r\ntrace of any subsequent glaciation of Japan has yet been found.\r\n\r\nJ. S. Lee has recently called attention to the existence of a\r\nglaciated area in northern China, the evidence for which consists of\r\nmoraines and striated slabs found in southern Chi-li, and a glaciated\r\nvalley with travelled boulders in the north of Shan-si. The glacial\r\ndeposits in Chi-li are closely associated with a layer of quartzite\r\npebbles which continues southward beneath the loess on the eastern\r\nside of the Tai-hang range, and is attributed to either torrential\r\nrain or the melting of glaciers. J. Geikie had long ago stated that\r\nthere once existed ice-masses all over northern China, and considered\r\nthat the ice came from the Himalayas. This origin is impossible, the\r\nprobable source of the ice being the Yablonoi mountains in southern\r\nMongolia.\r\n\r\nIn the Himalayas the glaciers formerly had a much greater extension.\r\nThe glaciers at present extend downwards to 11-13,000 feet, but old\r\nmoraines are found at 7000 feet, and near Dalhousie on the southern\r\nslopes of the Dholadar range to 4740 feet.\r\n\r\nOn the northern side of the Himalayas there was a great development\r\nof ice over Tibet, but there was not a real ice-sheet such as\r\noccurred further north. Oldham records three separate periods of\r\nglaciation in Kashmir, but it is not yet possible to discuss the\r\nglacial history of the Himalayas in detail. The latter is likely to\r\nprove complicated, since the range is still rising, and has probably\r\nbeen doing so either continually or intermittently throughout the\r\nQuaternary.\r\n\r\nThe great development of ice in Tibet, which is now semi-arid,\r\nowing to interception of the rain-bearing winds by the Himalayan\r\nrange, suggests a considerable alteration in the present\r\nmeteorological conditions. The Tibetan snowfall was probably due to\r\nthe Mediterranean storms, which now give a small winter rainfall\r\nin north-west India, and which during the Glacial period greatly\r\nincreased in strength and frequency and occurred throughout the year\r\n(Chapters IV and VI), giving the Pluvial period of North Africa.\r\nThese storms would pass across Persia and continue to the north of\r\nthe Himalayas, probably breaking up over the Tibetan plateau.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, taking northern Asia as a whole, there have\r\nbeen two general glaciations, of which the first was the more\r\nsevere, separated by a long interglacial, during which, in Japan\r\nat least, the climate became appreciably warmer than the present.\r\nThe first glaciation is related to elevation in the Arctic basin,\r\nwhich closed Bering Strait and united the New Siberian islands to\r\nthe mainland. It was almost certainly contemporaneous with the first\r\nglaciation (Gunz-Mindel) of Europe. The ice began as glaciers on the\r\nmountains as in Scandinavia, but, owing to the scanty supply of snow,\r\ndeveloped more slowly and only reached the dignity of ice-sheets\r\nin north-east Siberia. Then followed subsidence below the present\r\nlevel, wider opening of the Bering Strait, warm ocean currents and\r\na long interglacial. After this there was again elevation and a\r\nre-development of ice-sheets, but apparently once only, and not twice\r\nas in Europe. This glaciation probably corresponded in point of time\r\nmore or less with the Rissian, for the post-glacial dry of central\r\nAsia appears to have been of enormous period length.\r\n\r\nThere is one other phenomenon which must be considered in connexion\r\nwith the glacial history of Asia, and that is the loess. Loess has\r\nalready been referred to in connexion with the glaciation of Europe,\r\nbut in China its development is much greater. Richthofen, who first\r\nstudied this deposit attentively, and to whom we owe the æolian\r\ntheory of its origin, found that it was formerly deposited in China\r\nover a much greater area than that over which it is accumulating\r\nat present, and attributes this cessation of growth to the heavier\r\nrainfall brought by the Glacial period, which enabled the rivers\r\nto cut back their valleys and drain some of the mountain basins,\r\nformerly enclosed. He considered that loess can accumulate more\r\nrapidly in a closed basin, where occasional floods leave behind\r\nthem layers of bare sand and mud, easily dried to dust, than in a\r\nwell-drained river valley where floods are rare.\r\n\r\nIn western Asia outside the limits of glaciation we have further\r\nevidence of at least one Pluvial period in the former far greater\r\nextent of all the enclosed lakes, due partly to greater precipitation\r\nand partly to decreased evaporation. The Caspian Sea and Aral Sea\r\nwere extended to several times their present size and united into a\r\nsingle sheet of inland water. Lake Lop-Nor was greatly increased in\r\nsize, and many of the desert basins, at present dry, were the sites\r\nof salt lakes. This is especially the case in central Persia, where\r\nthere were large salt or brackish lakes.\r\n\r\nThese Pluvial conditions have not yet been correlated with the\r\nglaciations of Asia, but, by analogy with the conditions in America\r\ndiscussed in the next chapter, there is little doubt that they were\r\ncontemporaneous with one at least of the glaciations, and probably\r\nthere were two main Pluvial periods coinciding with the two Glacial\r\nperiods. At Baku, on the shores of the Caspian river, Pumpelly has\r\nfound old shore lines at heights of 600, 500, and 300 feet above the\r\npresent level of the water. Still more interesting are the conditions\r\nfound by Sven Hedin in the Kavir basin of Persia. Here there are\r\nlacustrine clays and silts referable to a Pluvial period covered by\r\nbeds of almost pure salt, suggesting a rapid and complete drying up\r\nof the lake. Above this again are further silts indicating a return\r\nof Pluvial conditions. In addition to this the succession of silts\r\nand clays show that there were several minor fluctuations superposed\r\non the main wet periods, giving ten moist phases altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nMany of the more important references are in Russian, and for these\r\nreference is made to summaries in other languages.\r\n\r\n  Sevastianov, D.

It spread from three main centres, the\r\nCordilleran or Rocky Mountain centre, the Keewatin centre west of\r\nHudson Bay, and the Labradorean centre. Vancouver Island in the west\r\nand New Brunswick and Newfoundland in the east, were also independent\r\ncentres of glaciation, and ice from the latter may have reached the\r\ncoast of the United States in places. The ice covered an area of\r\nabout 4,000,000 square miles, and the main ice-sheet extended to 38°\r\nN., or twelve degrees further south than the Scandinavian ice-sheet.\r\nNine stages are recognized by American geologists, though opinion is\r\ndivided as to whether all the stages of “deglaciation” represent real\r\ninterglacial periods. The sequence is as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Nebraskan, Jerseyan or pre-Kansan glaciation.\r\n  2. Aftonian deglaciation.\r\n  3. Kansan glaciation.\r\n  4. Yarmouth deglaciation.\r\n  5. Illinoian glaciation.\r\n  6. Sangamon deglaciation.\r\n  7. Iowan glaciation.\r\n  8. Peorian deglaciation.\r\n  9. Wisconsin glaciation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the northern part of the Rocky Mountains there\r\nis evidence of only two Glacial periods, separated by a single long\r\ninterglacial, though perhaps the second glaciation was double.\r\nFurther south, out of reach of the main ice-sheets, there are traces\r\nof two and in places three separate developments of valley glaciers\r\nresembling those of the Alps.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Europe, the literature of the subject is extensive\r\nand conflicting, but the following summary of the course of events\r\nrepresents the views of most moderate American geologists.\r\n\r\nThe Quaternary period opened with extensive elevation of the whole\r\nNorth American continent, which raised the Rocky Mountains several\r\nthousand feet above their present level and extended the continental\r\narea over much of the northern archipelago. In the east Newfoundland\r\nis considered to have been raised at least 1000 feet, a movement\r\nwhich converted the banks into dry land and interposed a large\r\ncold area in the path of the moisture-bearing southerly winds. As\r\nin northern Europe the high mountains of the west were the first\r\nto develop large glaciers, which coalesced into an ice-sheet,\r\nfilling the valleys and rising up the slopes of the mountains until\r\nit reached a thickness of 5000 feet. In Puget Sound the ice was\r\n4000 feet thick, but seawards the slope is very rapid and the ice\r\nwas unable to extend far from the shore. This ice-sheet extended\r\nsouth-eastwards some distance into the United States, forming\r\nthe first ground-moraine of that district. Probably while this\r\nCordilleran glaciation was still in progress ice began to spread\r\noutwards also from the Labradorean centre, forming the oldest drift\r\nof that region. These oldest deposits are, however, not yet well\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nThis oldest boulder-clay is separated from the moraines of the main\r\nglaciation near its southern limit by river gravels containing the\r\nremains of mollusca and large herbivorous mammals—extinct species of\r\nhorse, the hairy mammoth of the old world (_Elephas primigenius_),\r\nand two other extinct species of elephant, and also the true American\r\nmammoth. This is the Aftonian fauna, which has been claimed as\r\nevidence of an Interglacial period. That it evidences a retreat of\r\nthe ice-edge in that particular region is certain, but that the\r\nclimate became really temperate is very doubtful. More probably it\r\ncorresponds to the Gunz-Mindel “interglacial” of the Alps, and was\r\nformed when the Cordilleran ice-sheet was retreating, but before the\r\nKeewatin sheet had reached its maximum.\r\n\r\nThe Aftonian stage was followed by the Kansan glaciation, when the\r\nice-sheets reached their maximum area over the greater part of\r\nNorth America. The chief centre of glaciation at this stage was the\r\nKeewatin, west of Hudson Bay. While it is certain that the Keewatin\r\ncentre reached its maximum later than the Cordilleran, geological\r\nopinion in America is divided as to whether or no the two ice-sheets\r\never coalesced, but it is difficult to understand how an independent\r\nice-sheet could have grown up on the comparatively low ground of\r\nthe Keewatin centre. Most probably the course of events here was an\r\nexact parallel of that in the better-known Scandinavian region—the\r\nCordilleran ice-sheet extended eastwards over the lower ground until\r\na glacial anticyclone developed east of the Rockies. When this\r\nhappened the supply of moisture to the western part of the ice-sheet\r\nfell off somewhat, and the eastern part took on an independent life,\r\nultimately becoming the main centre of glaciation. It was while these\r\nchanges were in progress that the southern limit of the ice retreated\r\nnorthwards and the “Aftonian” deposits were formed.\r\n\r\nThe next stage (Kansan) occurred when the ice from the Keewatin\r\ncentre spread outwards in all directions, and in the south reached\r\nthe maximum limits of glaciation in America. In the west this sheet\r\noverlapped on to the ground-moraine of the former Cordilleran ice,\r\nbut the Rocky Mountains were too far away and too high for Keewatin\r\nice to dominate them and overflow them from east to west. Instead\r\nthese mountains must have maintained an extensive glaciation of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the Keewatin centre the Labradorean also\r\ndecreased, but more slowly, and this change was not associated with a\r\nretreat of the southern ice-edge, so that there was no corresponding\r\n“interglacial” in the east of the United States. The moraines of\r\nthese older glaciations resemble those of the early ice-sheets of\r\nEurope in presenting only featureless level surfaces of boulder-clay\r\nwithout morainic ridges, lakes and the other characteristics of\r\nice-bearing surface detritus, and there is no doubt that conditions\r\nat the southern edge were similar—the climate was severe in winter,\r\nbut not insupportable in summer. At the same time it was decidedly\r\nmore severe than the present, even as far south as Florida, where\r\nthere are colonies of northern plants, which migrated southwards\r\nduring the Ice Age, still living on local cold slopes with a\r\nnortherly aspect. After the maximum of glaciation the disappearance\r\nof the ice took place gradually and chiefly by ablation, for there\r\nare none of the extensive river gravels and flood terraces which we\r\nshould find had the melting been rapid. It is only in the valleys\r\nof the Rocky Mountains that such deposits occur, testifying to\r\nconditions such as obtained in the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding Yarmouth stage of deglaciation was very long,\r\ncorresponding in this respect to the Mindel-Riss interglacial of\r\nEurope. The Kansan moraine was weathered to a depth of ten or twenty\r\nfeet, and four-fifths of its surface was removed by the erosion of\r\nstreams and rivers. In the mountain districts the side streams which\r\nhad been left occupying “hanging valleys” by the over-deepening of\r\nthe heavily glaciated main valleys, had time to cut out uniformly\r\ngraded broad V-shaped valleys descending to the level of the\r\nmain stream. In the Great Basin also, where the periods of high\r\nwater-level are considered to correspond to the main glaciations,\r\nthe interval of low water corresponding to the Yarmouth stage\r\nwas very long. A rough estimate of its length is about 200,000\r\nyears—somewhat shorter than the Mindel-Riss. Actually, though the\r\nKansan and Mindelian glaciations were approximately contemporaneous,\r\nthe subsequent recurrence of glaciation in America appears to have\r\npreceded slightly that in Europe.\r\n\r\nOf the climate of this stage we have unfortunately little evidence.\r\nOld land surfaces of this age are known, containing deposits of peat\r\nand bones of the wood rabbit and common skunk, but both of these\r\nanimals have a wide range. Perhaps the climate resembled the present\r\nduring most of the period; there is no evidence that it was ever\r\nwarmer, and it appears quite likely that ice-sheets maintained their\r\nexistence in the far north through the whole of this stage.\r\n\r\nAfter this interglacial there set in a period of renewed elevation\r\nin the Rocky Mountains and in the Labrador-Newfoundland centres,\r\nwhich brought about a recurrence of the glaciation. In the Rocky\r\nMountains the ice was not so thick as in the preceding stage, but all\r\nthe valleys were occupied to a considerable depth and the ice spread\r\nout to the eastward. The Labrador ice-sheets also developed again,\r\nforming the Illinoian glaciation, the moraines of which are found as\r\nfar west as Illinois, but no moraines are known of this age due to\r\nthe Keewatin ice-sheet. The latter developed later, and is classed by\r\nsome American geologists as a separate glaciation, the Iowan, which\r\nis only certainly found in northern Iowa, but may be represented\r\nfurther east by a thin sheet of boulder-clay overlapping the\r\nIllinoian moraine. The supposed interglacial between the Illinoian\r\nand Iowan, the “Sangamon Stage,” is represented only by land surfaces\r\nformed of the Illinoian moraine and covered by the loess or locally\r\nby the equivalent of the Iowan moraine, and there is no evidence that\r\nthe ice-edge retreated far. Other American geologists, including\r\nF. Leverett, do not recognize the existence of a separate Iowan\r\nglaciation, and as the amount of weathering and denudation undergone\r\nby the two moraines differs very little, this seems the more natural\r\nview. The natural explanation seems to be that this was another case\r\nof “glacial piracy,” the Keewatin ice-sheet, owing to its lesser\r\nsnowfall, developing more gradually, and finally diverting the supply\r\nof moisture from the Labradorean ice-sheet, until it reached a\r\nmaximum after the latter was already on the wane. Both these sheets\r\nof drift present similar flat features to the Kansan sheet, without\r\nmorainic ridges.\r\n\r\nLeverett’s interpretation of the succession is as follows: The third\r\n(Illinoian-Iowan) glaciation was followed by a period of moist\r\nclimate, when peat-bogs were formed on level poorly-drained surfaces,\r\nwhile elsewhere coniferous forests developed. This was followed by a\r\nperiod of dry steppe-like conditions with a cold temperate climate,\r\nwhen the great American loess sheet was deposited. This loess sheet\r\nextends northwards, overlapping the Iowan moraine, and in places\r\npassing under the Wisconsin drift. The material has come from the\r\nwest, and probably most largely from the dry plains east of the\r\nRocky Mountains, from which it diminishes in thickness eastwards.\r\nBut unlike Europe this phase of steppe conditions was followed in\r\nAmerica by a definite interglacial, when the climate seems to have\r\nbecome rather warmer than the present. In the northern States an old\r\nland-surface formed on the loess, and, termed the Peorian stage, is\r\noverlain by the Wisconsin drift; but near Toronto, on the shores\r\nof Lake Ontario and in the Don valley, the gap represented by this\r\nland-surface is partly filled by a remarkable series of lacustrine\r\ndeposits known as the Toronto stage. The Lake Ontario beds indicate\r\na climate slightly colder than the present, but the Don valley beds\r\ncontain plants and animals living in the central States, and refer to\r\nconditions more favourable than those now found in the district.\r\n\r\nThe duration of this interglacial has been worked out in a\r\nremarkable way by A. P. Coleman, who on the basis of wave-action\r\nestimated it as 62,000 years, which agrees very closely with the\r\n60,000 years found by Penck and Brückner in the Alps. This period\r\nwas not long enough for streams in the “hanging valleys” to cut\r\nout uniformly graded valleys down to the main rivers, and was\r\nconsequently much shorter than the preceding interglacial.\r\n\r\nThe last glaciation of North America was the Wisconsin, which closely\r\nresembles the Wurmian of Europe both in its relations to the older\r\nglaciations and in the rough topography and unworn character of its\r\nmoraines. It extended within the limits of the Kansan drift across\r\nfully two-thirds of the continent, from Nantucket and Cape Cod\r\nthrough Long Island, northern New Jersey, Pennsylvania, southern New\r\nYork, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa\r\nand the Dakotas, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. At the same time\r\nthe Cordilleran centre probably bore increased local valley glaciers.\r\n\r\nLike the Wurm glaciation, the Wisconsin was double. The older\r\nmoraines are well-marked, and in places are covered by a foot or two\r\nof loess, though this deposit reaches nothing like the thickness of\r\nthat overlying the moraines of the earlier glaciations. The moraine\r\nunder this loess is very little weathered, so that the time interval\r\nwas very short; possibly this loess is redistributed older loess\r\nassociated with glacial east winds. The ice of the first glaciation\r\nmelted very slowly and there is very little gravel outwash to the\r\nmoraines. But “after the Wisconsin ice-sheet had reached a position a\r\nlittle outside the limits of the Great Lakes the retreat became much\r\nmore rapid, and large outwash aprons were formed from which valley\r\ntrains of gravel led far down the drainage lines. From this position\r\n... the moraines are practically free from loess-like silts.”[4]\r\n\r\nFrom this point onwards the glacial history of America is one\r\nof irregular retreat, with occasional halts or even readvances\r\nresembling those of the Scandinavian ice. Banded clays are found\r\nsimilar to those used so successfully by Baron de Geer in dating\r\nthe retreat stages of Scandinavia, and this geologist has recently\r\nbeen investigating them, but until his results are worked out no\r\ncorrelation with Europe can be attempted.\r\n\r\nA natural clock of another type is provided by Niagara Falls, which\r\nare cutting their way back up the gorge at a rate which has been\r\ndefinitely ascertained. Taking into account the varying amounts\r\nof water which have passed over the falls at different stages of\r\npost-glacial geography, the duration since the region became free of\r\nice has been calculated at about 20,000 years, which agrees closely\r\nwith the time elapsed since the Scandinavian ice-sheet left the North\r\nGerman coast.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving North America it is necessary to give a brief\r\naccount of the phenomena outside the main centres of glaciation,\r\nand especially of the history of the Great Basin between the Sierra\r\nNevada and Wasatch Mountains. The lowest levels of this basin are\r\nat present occupied by several salt lakes without outflow, of\r\nwhich the largest is the Great Salt Lake, the level of the water\r\nbeing determined by the balance between inflow of the rivers and\r\nevaporation from the surface. Twice in the past this balance has\r\nbeen decidedly more favourable, and then the lakes grew to many\r\ntimes their present size. The two greatest of these old lakes have\r\nbeen fully described under the names of Lake Bonneville (of which\r\nthe Great Salt Lake is a vestige) and Lake Lahontan, further to\r\nthe west. The investigations have shown that before the Glacial\r\nperiod, and extending back into an unknown past, there was a period\r\nof great aridity. To this succeeded a long period of high water,\r\nduring which, however, neither of the lakes overflowed. This stage\r\nwas followed by a very long period of great aridity, during which\r\nthe lakes dried up completely, and all their soluble matter was\r\ndeposited and buried by alluvial material. This period was followed\r\nby a return of moist conditions, during which the water reached a\r\nhigher level than before, and in the case of Lake Bonneville actually\r\noverflowed into the Snake river, cutting a deep gorge. This period,\r\nhowever, was shorter than the preceding moist period. It was followed\r\nby an irregular fall interspersed with occasional slight rises,\r\nbut ultimately both lakes descended below their present level and\r\nprobably again dried up completely. Both lakes suggest that this low\r\nlevel was followed by a third rise to a height very slightly above\r\nthe present level, followed by a slow fall in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the periods of high water to the glaciations are\r\nnot clear in these large lakes, but in the Mono Basin, a small\r\nbasin further west, there is no doubt that the two were almost\r\ncontemporaneous, high water accompanying the maxima of glaciation and\r\nextending some way into the retreat phase. The very long interval\r\nbetween the first and second period of high water, several times that\r\nsince the second period, agrees with this correlation. We find then\r\nthat south-west of the main glaciated area there was a district of\r\ngreater precipitation or less evaporation, or more probably both.\r\nThis is confirmed by the valley moraines of all this region—Sierra\r\nNevada, Uinta and Wasatch mountains, Medicine Bow Range of northern\r\nColorado, etc., all of which indicate two glaciations, of which the\r\nfirst was the greater, separated by a very long interval. In several\r\nranges the moraines of the second glaciation are double, and some\r\ngeologists consider that there were three Glacial periods in these\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nIn the extremely arid region of Arizona, on the other hand, which is\r\nconsiderably further south, the evidence of the Gila conglomerates\r\nindicates that while frost was very active, the increase of\r\nprecipitation, though undoubtedly present, was comparatively slight.\r\nThis shows that the climatic balance was not greatly disturbed, the\r\nchief effect being an important lowering of temperature, probably\r\ndue to cold northerly winds. The Gila conglomerates are double,\r\nseparated by a period representing present-day conditions.\r\n\r\nSumming up the evidences of glacial climate in North America, we find\r\na striking similarity to Europe. In the north elevation and increased\r\nland area caused the development of large ice-sheets, which appeared\r\nfirst in the mountainous regions with a heavy snowfall, and later\r\nspread over the drier plains and plateaux of the interior. This first\r\nglaciation was long and complex. Owing to the anticyclonic conditions\r\nwhich formed over the ice, the rain- and snow-bearing depressions\r\nwere forced to pass further southward, causing greater snowfall on\r\nthe mountains and high water-level in the lake basins. This greater\r\nsnowfall, together with the cold conditions due to the existence\r\nof the ice-sheets to the north, caused the development of mountain\r\nglaciers south of the main glaciated region. In the east there were\r\ncold northerly winds which carried a severe climate as far south\r\nas Florida. This Glacial period was followed by subsidence, and a\r\nlong spell of dry, moderately warm climate lasting perhaps 200,000\r\nyears, after which elevation and glacial conditions again set in.\r\nThese conditions were not so severe as the first, and their duration\r\nwas much less, while they were broken up by several intervals of\r\ntemporary recession of the ice, one of which, corresponding to\r\nthe Riss-Wurm period, lasted for 60,000 years, and perhaps should\r\nbe considered as an “interglacial.” This period was marked in its\r\nearly stages by the deposition of the curious æolian deposit known\r\nas “loess,” indicating steppe conditions. After the last glaciation\r\nthere set in a stage of irregular retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Leverett, F. “Comparison of North American and European glacial\r\n  deposits.” _Zs. f.

This is the more unfortunate as the chain of the Andes,\r\nextending from north of the equator to high southern latitudes, is of\r\nenormous importance in glacial theory, and especially in the question\r\nof simultaneity of glaciation in the two hemispheres.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of glaciation in South America are obscure. The\r\ndistribution of animals shows that towards the close of the Tertiary\r\nthe Falkland Islands were greatly elevated and were united to Tierra\r\ndel Fuego and Patagonia, and this enlarged land area was connected\r\nin some way with Australia and Tasmania, but the mode of this latter\r\nconnexion is not definitely known. This question will be discussed\r\nmore fully in Chapter XI; it is sufficient to say here that the\r\namount of elevation may have reached 12,000 feet in Tierra del Fuego.\r\nEquatorwards the elevation diminished, and near the equator the land\r\nprobably lay somewhat lower than now.\r\n\r\nIn South Georgia the present glaciers greatly expanded, until\r\npractically the whole island was buried in ice, and the same is\r\ntrue of the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego, only the highest\r\npeaks remaining above the ice. In the latter district there is\r\nsome evidence of two glaciations separated by an interglacial, the\r\nearlier glaciation being due to a regional ice-sheet and the later\r\nto smaller valley glaciers. The intricate coast-line of the Falkland\r\nIslands and Tierra del Fuego points to fiord erosion by ice which\r\nextended well beyond the present limits of the land, and can only\r\nhave occurred during considerable elevation. As to the character of\r\nthe interglacial, little is known. In the Falklands there is a bed of\r\nblack vegetable soil full of tree-trunks, indicating the existence of\r\nluxuriant forests and a temperate climate. This deposit is overlain\r\nby boulder-clay, and may be either interglacial or pre-glacial, but\r\nsince it was formed when the land stood at a comparatively low level,\r\nwhile we have reason to believe (see Chapter XII) that during the\r\nclose of the Tertiary period these islands were greatly elevated,\r\nit is probably an interglacial formation, and indicates a great\r\namelioration of climate. In Gable Island, Tierra del Fuego, Halle\r\nfound beneath boulder-clay a Quaternary fauna of barnacles and marine\r\nmollusca indicating a climate slightly warmer than the present, and\r\nthis probably belongs to the same period. To the concluding stages\r\nof the Glacial period in the Falklands belong the curious “stone\r\nrivers,” great streams of moss-grown boulders which fill the valleys,\r\nand under the influence of temperature changes are probably still\r\nslowly advancing.\r\n\r\nPassing further north to the Andes, between 39° and 44° south\r\nlatitude, the glaciation was not so severe, and its records are\r\ntherefore clearer. The first result of elevation was the cutting of\r\ndeep canyons by the rivers. This was followed, possibly without much\r\nfurther elevation, by a fall of temperature, which in this connexion\r\nmay be attributed to the extension of the Antarctic and Tierra del\r\nFuego ice-sheets. Glaciers now developed and spread down the canyons,\r\nleaving moraines of great volume and height, associated with all\r\nthe other criteria of glaciation. The snow-fields from which these\r\nglaciers originated lay between 5000 and 6000 feet above the sea,\r\nand the snow-line lay at about 3000 feet instead of above 6000 as at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThis glaciation was followed by a long interglacial, during which the\r\nglaciers retreated to the highest summits of the Andes. The length of\r\nthis period is indicated by the fact that the earlier moraines have\r\nbeen eroded to such an extent that they no longer present distinctly\r\nthe typical features of glacial topography, while the materials of\r\nwhich they are composed are decayed to somewhat the same extent as\r\nthe older moraines of North America, the granite boulders especially\r\nbeing rotten and friable. This interglacial was followed by a\r\nre-development of the glaciers, but to nothing like the same extent\r\nas formerly; their moraines are smaller and fresh-looking, indicating\r\nthat this glaciation was comparatively recent.\r\n\r\nStill further north, in latitude 20°-25° S., we come to a region of\r\nvery slight snowfall, where the snow-line lies higher than anywhere\r\nelse on the face of the earth. The glaciation here was comparatively\r\nunimportant, the snow-line descending only 1600 to 2500 feet. Here\r\nKeidel found moraines of three glacial advances, and from his\r\ndescription it appears probable that the earliest and greatest was\r\nseparated by a considerable interval from the two younger, the\r\ninterglacial between which was short and not characterized by a\r\nreturn to present-day climatic conditions, since during this interval\r\nthere was very little weathering. Probably we have here to do with\r\ntwo glaciations, of which the second was double. In fact, some\r\nwriters have described no less than five glacial advances in the\r\nArgentine Andes, but most of these are probably merely retreat stadia.\r\n\r\nIn Peru, W. Sievers reports the existence of two glaciations\r\nseparated by a considerable interval. The present limit of the\r\nglaciers is about 15,200 feet; during the first glaciation they\r\ndescended to about 11,000 feet, and during the second to 12,800\r\nfeet. The evidence is very complete. In Ecuador, H. Meyer records\r\na similar bipartition. The oldest glaciation is represented by\r\ntrough-like valleys, enormous gravel terraces, and old moraines\r\nmuch weathered; the limits are far below the present limits of\r\nglaciers, but have been much obscured by subsequent erosion. This\r\nglaciation was followed by a long period of steppe climate resembling\r\nthe present, during which the loess-like Cangagua formation was\r\ndeposited. This in turn was followed by a readvance of the glaciers\r\nto a level about 2700 feet below the present limit. This glaciation\r\nis associated with crescent-shaped moraines, corrie lakes,\r\nhanging valleys and gravel terraces, covered with vegetation, but\r\notherwise fresh-looking. The snow-line lay about 1600 feet below\r\nthe present. Probably during the first glaciation the Andes were\r\ninvaded by numerous mountain plants and animals related to North\r\nAmerican forms—a valuable piece of evidence which indicates that\r\nthe glaciation was contemporaneous with that in North America. In\r\nColumbia and Venezuela there are traces of Glacial periods, but these\r\nhave not yet been studied in detail. The most northerly evidence of a\r\nGlacial period comes from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Maria, near the\r\nnorth coast of Venezuela in 11° N.\r\n\r\nExcept in Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia the ice did not extend far\r\nfrom the mountains. But in the eastern Argentine there is a great\r\nseries of Quaternary deposits known as the Pampean. This formation\r\ncovers 200,000 square miles, and consists of at least ninety feet of\r\nfine loam without a single pebble (except for a few thin calcareous\r\nlayers), but containing large numbers of complete skeletons of\r\nmammals. It raises several interesting problems. Apparently it\r\nrepresents the whole course of the Glacial period. By some geologists\r\nit is considered to be a delta deposit of the combined Parana and\r\nParaguay rivers, but the absence of mollusca, except in a marine\r\nintercalation near its summit, is against this view, and Steinmann\r\nattributes it to æolian agencies and compares it to the loess of\r\nEurope and North America. If this view is correct the Pampean\r\nrepresents steppe conditions prevailing on the equatorial side of the\r\nPatagonia-Falkland Islands ice-sheet. Apparently before the incoming\r\nof the greatest cold the Pampas were in part at least forest-clad,\r\nfor in the older beds are found peculiar forms of ground-sloths\r\nwhich were adapted for forest life and have been found also in\r\ncave-deposits of Brazil. At the maximum of glacial conditions the\r\nPampas probably had a steppe climate, but the disappearance of the\r\nforests is to be attributed rather to drought than to cold. Elevated\r\nglacier-bearing Andes to the west and ice-sheets to the south would\r\nrender the Argentine extremely arid, and this accounts for the\r\ngradual extinction of so many giant forms whose remains are found\r\nin the Pampean deposits. Conditions ultimately became too severe\r\neven for the horse, which died out in South America. The marine\r\ntransgression which left its mark near the top of the Pampean is\r\nprobably post-glacial.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, on the other hand, there is no evidence that the climate\r\nhas ever been drier than the present, and in the semi-arid regions of\r\nthe north-east it is even probable that during the Glacial period the\r\nclimate was moister, presumably owing to the greater strength of the\r\nrain-bearing east and north-east winds. Further west in the Andes the\r\nexistence of this wet period is borne out by the former greater size\r\nof Lake Titicaca, and there seems to be additional evidence to the\r\nsame effect in the Chilian deserts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Steinmann, J. “Diluvium in Südamerika.” _Zs. d.

The glaciation of the Atlas Mountains has already\r\nbeen referred to in connexion with the Mediterranean region. Further\r\nsouth we have no great mountain chain such as the Andes extending\r\nabove the snow-line over the whole extent of the country, but merely\r\na few isolated peaks. Three of these, all close to the equator, are\r\nknown to show traces of a greatly extended glaciation in the past:\r\nRuwenzori, just north of the equator, on the borders of Uganda and\r\nthe Congo, reaching an elevation of 16,794 feet, with the present\r\nsnow-line at 15,000 feet, and glaciers extending to 10,000 feet,\r\nformerly bore glaciers extending down as far as 5200 feet; Kenya, on\r\nthe equator in Kenya Colony, height 17,040 feet, present snow-line\r\nabout 15,000 feet, past snow-line 12,000 feet, and old moraines\r\nat 10,000 feet; finally, Kilimanjaro, 3° S., on the borders of\r\nTanganyika territory, height 19,320 feet, present limit of glaciers\r\n13,650 feet, past limit 4870 feet. Further south, the Drakensberg\r\nMountains, between Basutoland and Natal, were glaciated on their\r\nhigher summits. In none of these cases have the remains of more than\r\none glaciation been described, but the mountains are still very\r\nlittle known and this negative evidence is not conclusive. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Ruwenzori there are several peaks, which approach\r\n12,000 feet, but these were not glaciated, pointing to a snow-line\r\nabove this level. Unfortunately the latter piece of evidence is of\r\ndoubtful validity since these mountains are volcanic and possibly of\r\npost-glacial age; we may consider, however, that the glaciation of\r\nthe central African mountains was characterized by a great increase\r\nin the length of the glaciers with only a slight depression of the\r\nsnow-line, conditions showing that the glaciation was due chiefly\r\nto an increase of snowfall, and only in a minor degree to a fall of\r\ntemperature. This conclusion is borne out by the low-level beds,\r\nwhich nowhere show an appreciably lower temperature, but abound in\r\nindications of a former greatly increased rainfall. The first of\r\nthese is the former greater size of the African great lakes.\r\n\r\nAbyssinia, as we have seen, was probably drier than at present, but\r\nfurther south the rainfall must have been considerably greater. Lake\r\nKioga stood 600 feet above its present level and was connected with\r\nLake Victoria. Lake Victoria and the smaller lakes were twice their\r\npresent size, and most of the broad valleys were filled with water.\r\nLake Magadi is the attenuated relic of a vast sheet of water, and\r\nother great lakes have disappeared entirely. One of these, in the\r\nRift valley, south of Lake Naivasha, has been mapped by Professor\r\nGregory and named after Professor Suess. Part of this decrease of the\r\nlakes has undoubtedly taken place within historic times, and part may\r\nbe attributed to changes in the drainage, but there remains enough\r\nevidence to show that some time in the Ice Age the great lakes were\r\nvery much larger than the present.\r\n\r\nMr. E. J. Wayland, the Government Geologist of Uganda, informs me\r\nthat in the old basin of Victoria Nyanza there are masses of gravel\r\nwhich may be two or three miles in breadth, the surface of which\r\nforms two terraces at different levels. Above the level of these is\r\nan old peneplain with ancient beach gravels. Mr. Wayland considers\r\nthat this peneplain was formed probably during the Pliocene by the\r\nfirst Victoria Nyanza occupying a basin between folds. The initial\r\nhigh level was due to the want of an outlet, but may have been\r\namplified by other causes. The level of the lake then sank gradually\r\nto a considerably lower level, after which it rose again nearly to\r\nits old level and remained there for a considerable time. During this\r\nperiod the great gravel deposits were formed; they contain flood\r\ndeposits, especially near their base. The level of the lake then\r\nsank again and this part of the basin was converted into a valley\r\noccupied by a river. Subsequently the level rose again sufficiently\r\nto carve out the lower terrace in the gravels. Mr. Wayland considers\r\nthat the upper terrace may also represent a stage distinct from that\r\nin which the gravels were actually deposited, but the upper terrace\r\nmay be the original surface of the gravels. Thus there is evidence of\r\ntwo Pluvial periods in central Africa, of which the first, probably\r\ncorresponding with the great extension of the mountain glaciers, was\r\nthe greater. From the archæological evidence it appears to correspond\r\nwith the Mindelian glaciation of Europe.\r\n\r\nA second line of evidence has been pointed out by C. W. Hobley. At\r\nthe entrance to Kilindi Harbour, Mombasa, there is a gap in the coral\r\nbarrier through which the fresh water from the river finds its way.\r\nThese gaps are always found opposite the mouths of rivers, and are\r\ndue to the inability of the coral polyp to live in fresh or brackish\r\nwater. In Pleistocene times the land stood some seventy feet lower\r\nrelatively to the sea, and the old channel through the reef at this\r\nheight is almost double the width of the present channel, showing\r\nthat the river then had a greater volume, i.e. the rainfall in its\r\nbasin was greater.\r\n\r\nBut Africa is noteworthy chiefly for its deserts, and the most\r\nimportant evidence of climatic change is found in the deserts of\r\nSahara and Kalahari. From the time of the ancient Greeks it had been\r\nbelieved that the Sahara was formerly the site of a great inland sea,\r\nand the presence of this sea had even been suggested as the cause\r\nof the Ice Age in Europe, but recent investigations have shown that\r\nthis is not so; the Sahara has been land at least throughout the\r\nTertiary period. There is, however, abundant evidence that during the\r\nQuaternary the rainfall was considerably greater than the present.\r\nThe presence of numerous animals closely associated with water, such\r\nas the hippopotamus and even the crocodile, in oases now entirely\r\nisolated, shows that these oases were formerly connected with the big\r\nrivers. The most definite evidence, however, comes from Lake Tchad.\r\nThis was formerly of much greater area, but Chudeau and Freydenberg\r\nhave made out a whole series of changes from desert conditions in the\r\nTertiary through pluvial conditions in the Quaternary back to desert\r\nconditions of the present. The sequence is as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. A regime of dunes.\r\n\r\n  2. A slow transgression causing a long marshy period, during which\r\n  numerous plants whose remains are found lived in the period.\r\n\r\n  3. A slow regression.\r\n\r\n  4. A rapid transgression (grey loam).\r\n\r\n  5. A slow regression (clayey white loam with traces of roots).\r\n\r\n  6. A transgression (white loam).\r\n\r\n  7. Establishment of a new dune regime.\r\n\r\nIn the Chari basin east of Lake Tchad are the remains of fish and\r\nshells, and also small pebbles of sandstone and chalcedony, which are\r\nnot local, but must have been brought from the mountains of Tibesti\r\nby the rivers Egnei and Toro when their current was much stronger\r\nthan at present. In Senegal, south of the 15th parallel, the present\r\ndune sands are underlain by an alluvial soil, indicating moister\r\nconditions preceding the present climate. There is no means of dating\r\nthe moist periods indicated by these phenomena, but it is reasonable\r\nto correlate them with the former extension of the central African\r\nlakes.\r\n\r\nPassing south to the Kalahari, we find evidence of a number of\r\nmoist stages separated by drier intervals, but they can apparently\r\nbe grouped into two main Pluvial periods, separated by a long\r\ninterpluvial with steppe-like conditions. One at least of these\r\nPluvial periods must be correlated with the former immense extension\r\nof Lake Ngami and the Etosha Pan.\r\n\r\nFrom Cape Colony, there is some evidence of moister conditions in the\r\npast, but the Quaternary variations cannot be separated from those of\r\nhistoric times.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Africa some reference must be made to an interesting\r\nsuggestion by C. W. Hobley, as to the mechanism of climatic change\r\nin tropical countries. He notes that the north-east and south-west\r\nmonsoons extend to a height of only a few thousand feet. Above\r\nthem are the very steady “trade winds” connected with the general\r\ncirculation of the atmosphere. In Kenya Colony these blow from east\r\nor a little south of east. “Their effect is very marked on the high\r\nmountains of the interior, such as Kenya, Kilimanjaro and Elgon; in\r\nthe early morning they are generally quite clear, but about 10 a.m.\r\nthe clouds sweep up from the S.S.E. and collect on the mountains and\r\nblot them out from view for the rest of the day. These are believed\r\nto be clouds borne inland by the trade winds, and the moisture they\r\ncarry is precipitated mainly on the south and south-east sides of\r\nthe mountains.” Hobley suggests that there was formerly a nearly\r\ncontinuous ridge of high land extending north and south, and this\r\ncaught the moisture from the trade winds, so causing the Pluvial\r\nperiod, the evidence for this ridge being the distribution of alpine\r\nplants on the now isolated high mountains. An alternative explanation\r\nis that the greater strength of the earth’s circulation during\r\nglacial times caused the trade winds to be much stronger and also\r\nto extend to a lower level at the expense of the monsoons, just as\r\nthe west winds extended to a lower level in northern Egypt. This\r\nwould bring a great deal more moisture to be precipitated on the\r\nmountains, increasing the length of the glaciers and also the volume\r\nof the rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Scott Elliott, G.

The history of the region appears\r\nto be as follows:\r\n\r\nIn late Tertiary times the shore-line lay some distance to the\r\neast towards New Zealand, this being a relic of a much earlier\r\nconnexion between the two lands. Towards the close of the Tertiary\r\nearth-movements set in, which elevated the mountain belt of eastern\r\nAustralia and formed a land connexion with Tasmania and the Antarctic\r\ncontinent. At the same time the land to the east and the closed\r\nbasins of central Australia were also probably developed about this\r\ntime. The climate was then somewhat warmer than the present, at least\r\non the east coast, for the Australian barrier reef extended further\r\nsouth. Probably at this time the Antarctic ice-sheet did not reach\r\nthe sea, and there was none of the floating ice which is such an\r\nimportant factor in cooling the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe next stage was the lowering snow-line on Kosciusko to about 3000\r\nfeet below the present and the development of extensive glaciers,\r\nwhich descended to 5500 feet above the sea, and attained an area\r\nof 80 to 100 square miles and a thickness of at least 1000 feet.\r\nTasmania was also extensively ice-covered, probably by glaciers\r\nwhich coalesced at low levels, forming what is known as a “piedmont”\r\nice-sheet, which possibly reached the sea. The lowering of the\r\nsnow-line in Tasmania is estimated as 6000 feet, corresponding to\r\na fall in temperature of 18° F. Probably a large part of this fall\r\nis accounted for by the increased elevation, which may have been\r\nseveral thousand feet in Tasmania and more than a thousand feet even\r\nin New South Wales. This glaciation, which was probably dependent on\r\nthe growth of the Antarctic ice-sheet, was followed by a very long\r\ninterglacial, the duration of which has been estimated by Professor\r\nDavid as 100,000 to 200,000 years. The old moraines are much\r\nweathered and denuded, resembling in this respect the older moraines\r\nof Europe. No information is available as to the climate of this\r\ninterglacial period. Possibly some of the Quaternary raised beaches\r\nwith warmth-loving mollusca found in unglaciated parts of Australia\r\nbelong to this period, and if so the climate was warmer than the\r\npresent for at least part of the time.\r\n\r\nThe interglacial was followed by uplift and a second much less severe\r\nGlacial period, characterized by valley glaciers on Kosciusko and in\r\nTasmania, reaching the sea in places on the latter island. It was\r\nat the close of this Glacial period that man reached Tasmania; its\r\nconclusion is dated by Prof. David at about 10,000 years ago. It was\r\nterminated by a period of depression below the present level with a\r\nwarm climate.\r\n\r\nIn the dry interior of Australia there is evidence that at one time,\r\nprobably during the maximum glaciation, the rainfall was heavier than\r\nthe present, and numerous lakes were developed which have now been\r\ndry for a very long time. It is possible that the artesian water\r\nsupply of Australia, which Gregory considers to be “fossil water”\r\naccumulated under different conditions from the present, is a vestige\r\nof the rainfall of this period. Further north, in Java, the beds in\r\nwhich the famous _Pithecanthropus_ skeleton was found, believed to be\r\nlower glacial, contain also plant remains similar to those now found\r\nin the Khassian mountains of Assam, one of the rainiest climates in\r\nthe world. The climate of Java during the maximum glaciation was\r\nthus decidedly rainier, and probably somewhat cooler than the present.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary find which may be referred to here is that of\r\nProfessor Neuhauss, who discovered giant erratics, scratched and\r\npolished, and moraines at _sea-level_ at the western end of Huon\r\nGulf, New Guinea. The region is very unstable, and is known to have\r\nstood at a very much higher level, perhaps 10,000 feet or more, in\r\nQuaternary times, and if the moraines indicate glaciers terminating\r\nat 10,000 feet above the sea they are explicable by a slight fall of\r\ntemperature and increase of snowfall.\r\n\r\nTurning now to New Zealand, we find extensive glacial remains on\r\nSouth Island, though not on North Island. As in so many other\r\ncountries, the Quaternary opened with great elevation, which reached\r\nat least 1500 feet over the whole group. North and South Islands\r\nwere united with each other, with Stewart Island and probably also\r\nthe outlying islands, even including the Chatham Islands, forming a\r\ngreat land-mass several times the present area of New Zealand. On the\r\nsouthern part of this land-mass extensive glaciers were formed; on\r\nthe east these did not reach the present sea-level, but on the snowy\r\nsouth-west they extended far below it, so that the terminal moraines\r\nare now completely submerged; possibly they were never formed, but\r\nthe debris was floated away seaward on icebergs. Further north\r\nmoraines are found near the present shore-line at many places between\r\nMilford Sound and Hokitika, and morainic mounds cover a large part of\r\nthe low ground. Still further north they retreat inland, and in the\r\nNelson Province are not found below a level of 2000 feet at the foot\r\nof Lake Rotoiti.\r\n\r\nIn the south-east a great moraine has been described at the south end\r\nof Lake Wakatipu and others at the north-east ends of Lakes Manapouri\r\nand Te Anau, but none are found nearer the sea-coast. The glaciated\r\narea of New Zealand was at least ten times the present ice-covered\r\narea, and the Tasman, the longest glacier in New Zealand, was\r\nexpanded from its present length of 16 miles to at least 30 miles.\r\nMuch of the apparent fall of temperature shown by this glaciation\r\nwas probably due to the great elevation, but apart from this the ice\r\nhad a marked influence on climate. Outside the limits of glaciation\r\non the east is a thick deposit of typical loess, which extends up\r\nto a level of 1000 feet on the flanks of the hills. The occurrence\r\nof this loess points to a steppe climate with dry, cold, southerly\r\nwinds on the lee side of the glaciated mountains, and is probably\r\nalso connected with the increase of land area. Further north, north\r\nof Auckland in North Island, the present treeless plains were covered\r\nby forests; for Kauri gum, apparently very old, has been found. The\r\nsub-antarctic islands—Campbell, Antipodes, etc.—were not covered by\r\neither New Zealand or Antarctic ice, but were the centres of local\r\nsevere glaciations of their own.\r\n\r\nThe next stage was a great subsidence, during which the glaciers\r\nretreated. The land sank below its present level, raised beaches\r\nprobably of interglacial age being found at various heights ranging\r\nfrom 10 feet above the sea at Manukau in the centre of North Island\r\nto 150 feet at Taranaki, 200 feet at Cape Palliser, 400 feet on\r\nthe west coast of South Island, 500 feet at Amuri Bluff, and even\r\n800 feet in the entrances to the south-western sounds. This great\r\nsubmergence was associated with the deposition of extensive gravel\r\ndeposits by the rivers.\r\n\r\nThe interglacial was followed by a second period of elevation. It is\r\nnot certain how far this went. Submerged peat-bogs have been found at\r\na depth of nearly 600 feet below sea-level near Canterbury, but these\r\nmay belong to the early stages of the interglacial and not to the\r\npost-Glacial period. On the other hand, the submerged forests which\r\nare found at many points on the coast of New Zealand are evidently\r\npost-glacial and indicate a slight rise above present level. At the\r\nsame time there was a renewal of the glacial conditions, but the ice\r\nwas confined to the valleys and had a much less extent than in the\r\nfirst glaciation. This period seems to have been followed by a slight\r\nsubmergence and a temporary warm period.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  David, T. W. E. “Australasie.

Various suggestions have been made to account\r\nfor this former extension, perhaps the most remarkable being that it\r\ncoincided with a milder and therefore snowier climate. This, however,\r\nis untenable, for the Glacial period of Graham Land and the South\r\nOrkneys is obviously a southward extension of the Glacial period of\r\nTierra del Fuego, which was obviously due to a colder climate, and\r\ncan be traced northward along the Andes into tropical regions. A more\r\nfruitful suggestion is that as one of the most potent factors in\r\npreventing the accumulation of snow is at present the wind, it was a\r\ndecrease in the strength of the wind which enabled the ice to reach a\r\ngreater thickness. This is probably true in a sense, the decrease of\r\nwind force being due to a great increase in the area of the Antarctic\r\ncontinent during the Quaternary.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in the early Quaternary there was great elevation\r\nin the south of South America and also in Australia and New Zealand.\r\nThe amount of this elevation increased southward and was very great\r\nnear the polar circle. This is borne out by considerations based\r\non the distribution of living and fossil animals, which point very\r\ndefinitely to a land connexion between Australia and South America\r\nin Tertiary and early Quaternary times, most probably by way of\r\nAntarctica.\r\n\r\nThe first line of evidence is the distribution of the marsupials,\r\nliving and extinct. As is well known the chief home of this type of\r\nmammal is now in Australia and New Guinea, but in Tertiary deposits\r\nin Patagonia remains of extinct forms known as Dasyurids have been\r\nfound, which are allied to Australian forms, and can only have\r\ncome from Australia, probably via Tasmania. Secondly, there are\r\ntwo peculiar families of fresh-water fishes, the _Haplochitonidæ_\r\nand _Galaxiidæ_, the first common to Australia and South America,\r\nwhile one species of the second is found in New Zealand, Tasmania,\r\nthe Falkland Islands and Patagonia. Thirdly, Beddard has found an\r\nintimate relation between the earthworms of New Zealand, Eastern\r\nAustralia and Patagonia. Finally there is a curious similarity\r\nbetween the slugs of Patagonia and those of Polynesia.\r\n\r\nWhat is the explanation of these relationships? Assuming that\r\nthere has been a land connexion, it can have been either by way\r\nof Antarctica or Polynesia. The earthworms cannot endure a very\r\nsevere climate, but on the other hand there is a total absence of\r\nany tropical forms common to Australia and South America, and the\r\ngeneral dissimilarity of the faunas shows that the connexion cannot\r\nhave been available for a very long period. A study of the oceanic\r\ndepths suggests that the Antarctic connexion is the more probable.\r\nA comparatively slight elevation would connect Patagonia and the\r\nFalkland Islands with the South Shetlands and Graham Land, and an\r\nelevation of 12,000 feet would give a large land connexion between\r\nAustralia and the opposite coast of Antarctica via Kerguelen. Forbes\r\neven postulates an immense Tertiary Antarctica in which several forms\r\nof animals and plants were able to evolve, but except possibly in\r\nthe case of the edentates this supposition is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThe course of events may provisionally be taken as follows: In late\r\nTertiary times an elevation of at least 12,000 feet in the South\r\nPolar regions caused a great increase in the area of Antarctica,\r\nwhich was united to South America on the one hand and Australia on\r\nthe other. The northern shores of this continent were far to the\r\nnorth of their present position, and though the interior was very\r\ncold the coast lands had at first a moderate temperature, and for a\r\nshort time allowed animals to migrate from Australia to South America\r\nor vice versa. But the high mountains of the interior were already\r\nglaciated, and ice-sheets gradually crept down their slopes. Owing\r\nto the small precipitation the advance of the ice-sheets was slow,\r\nbut ultimately, probably in late Tertiary times, they approached\r\nthe coast, and the track along which migrations had taken place\r\nwas closed. The distribution of animals and plants shows quite\r\nclearly that the land connexion was maintained into the period of\r\nrefrigeration. The shores of the continent being further north, the\r\npressure gradient between the pole and the present coast was less,\r\nand consequently the winds were lighter. This and the diminished loss\r\nby calving into glaciers allowed the ice to become thicker than it is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nHedley apparently considers that the migrations referred to\r\nabove took place in an interglacial period, but the Patagonian\r\nbeds in which the fossil marsupials are found are Tertiary and\r\nnot Quaternary. No direct evidence of an interglacial period has\r\nbeen found in Antarctica, nor, considering the intensity of the\r\nglaciation which the country is even now undergoing, is any such\r\nto be expected, and we can only infer from the bipartition of the\r\nGlacial period in Australia, New Zealand and South America—which,\r\nin New Zealand at least, was associated with submergence—that there\r\nwas probably a similar bipartition in Antarctica. Nordenskjold\r\nstates that the submarine relief showing river erosion which, in\r\nTierra del Fuego, was developed partly at least in the interglacial\r\nperiod, is also developed in West Antarctica. It is improbable that\r\nthe ice ever entirely vanished from the continent. We shall see in\r\nChapter XIV that even the comparatively brief warm period known as\r\nthe post-glacial climatic optimum extended to the Antarctic coast,\r\nand this is additional argument for extending the much greater\r\ninterglacial oscillation southward beyond its known limits in Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, Australia and New Zealand, but here the matter must be\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Hedley, C. “The palæographical relations of Antarctica.” _London,\r\n  Proc.

But Scandinavia was now sinking, and the margin\r\nof the ice soon began to retreat again. At the same time the Alpine\r\nglaciers diminished in size, while the Irish and Scottish glaciers\r\ndisappeared. This is the critical period in the change from glacial\r\nto temperate conditions, and, thanks to the researches of the\r\nSwedish geologists, and especially G. de Geer, H. Munthe and Gunnar\r\nAndersson, we are very well acquainted with it. The change was\r\nnot uniform; at first the recession was very slow, and there were\r\nperiods when for scores of years the ice-edge remained stationary\r\nor even readvanced, but on the whole the time was one of persistent\r\namelioration. The following description is based chiefly on W. B.\r\nWright’s summary of de Geer’s work.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the coast of Germany the ice-edge appears to have\r\nremained in the western Baltic, retreating slowly for some 8000\r\nyears. About 10,000 B.C. it lay along the southern coast of Sweden,\r\nand during the next 2000 years it withdrew to about 59° N. This was\r\nthe Gotiglacial stage. Here came a pause, when, for 200 years, about\r\n8000 B.C., owing presumably to a change for the worse in the climate,\r\nthe ice-edge remained in one position, forming a great moraine. Then\r\ncame another period of very rapid retreat, the Finiglacial occupying\r\nnearly 3000 years, followed by a further halt of some duration near\r\nRagunda, about 5000 B.C. After this the ice-sheet split into two\r\nportions, and the Glacial period is regarded as over.\r\n\r\nIn the Alps there were similar periods of regression and of halting\r\nor readvance. The first, known as the Bühlstadium, corresponded to\r\nthe Baltic readvance (Chapter V). The second, the Gschnitz-stadium,\r\nwith a snow-line 2000 feet below the present (i.e. mean temperature\r\nabout 6° F. lower than now), has not been dated, but probably\r\noccurred about 8000 B.C. This was followed by a warmer period,\r\nprobably as warm as and drier than the present, after which the\r\nglaciers readvanced about 5000 B.C. in the third or Daun-stadium,\r\nwhen the snow-line was depressed 1000 feet (temperature 3° F. lower\r\nthan now).\r\n\r\nIn the lower Nile valley the deposition of gravel ceased, and that of\r\nmud began about 8000 B.C., indicating that at this time the climate\r\nof north-east Africa reached its present state of dryness.\r\n\r\nIt is at present difficult to give more than a tentative explanation\r\nof these oscillations of climate during the Retreat Phase. Northern\r\nEurope was at the time passing through a complicated series of\r\ngeographical changes. As the ice left the Baltic basin the latter\r\nbecame the site of a cold ice-lake, with narrow outlets to the\r\nAtlantic by way of the Sound and the Belts. At this time the\r\nrecession was slow. Then the retreat of the ice opened a connexion\r\nwith the White Sea, and elevation closed the outlet to the west.\r\nThis probably made the waters still colder, and the Fennoscandian\r\npause occurred. Elevation now closed the connexion with the White\r\nSea, and an entirely closed-in ice-lake resulted. During this stage\r\nthe retreat was slow, until between 7000 and 6000 B.C., when the\r\nice-sheet vacated Scania, and direct communication between the Baltic\r\nand the Atlantic was opened across Lakes Wener and Wetter, and the\r\nclimate, though still arctic at first, became appreciably warmer by\r\n6000 B.C.\r\n\r\nFor more than 10,000 years of the retreat, or until 6000 B.C., the\r\nice-sheet was still sufficiently large and powerful to maintain a\r\nborder of Arctic anticyclonic conditions on its southern edge. During\r\nthe retreat the mean annual temperature of southern Sweden increased\r\nfrom 17° F. to 35° F., equivalent to a change from North-east\r\nGreenland to South Greenland. The July temperature rose to about 43°\r\nF. On the North German Plain still lived the reindeer and the fauna\r\nand flora of the sub-Arctic tundras; the mean annual temperature rose\r\nto 45° F. by the close of the period. The land flora in Sweden was\r\nentirely xerophilous, indicating a slight rainfall. There is also\r\ngeological evidence of a small annual rainfall on the south-west\r\ncoast of Norway. This period covers the transition from Palæolithic\r\nto Neolithic culture.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the continental character of the climate of\r\nthe final stages of the retreat phase was slightly increased by\r\nastronomical causes, the obliquity of the ecliptic being probably\r\nnearly one degree greater about 7500 B.C. than it is now. In Germany\r\nand Sweden this would have the effect of lowering the winter\r\ntemperature and raising the summer temperature by rather more than 1°\r\nF.\r\n\r\nWhile the land was still falling rapidly in the north of Scandinavia\r\nand the Gulf of Bothnia, the coasts of Germany and Denmark began to\r\nrise, and about 6000 B.C. again closed[5] the outlet of the Baltic,\r\nconverting it into a large fresh-water lake, the _Ancylus_ lake. A\r\nsimilar lake was formed farther east in central Finland. At this time\r\nthe south-west Baltic lands stood more than 100 feet higher than at\r\npresent. The land was probably still largely under the influence of\r\ndry easterly winds, and the shutting out of the Atlantic accentuated\r\nthe continental conditions, and this stage in the climatic history\r\nof Europe is known as the “Continental Phase.” The winter climate\r\nwas severe; at first the summers were not especially warm (July\r\ntemperature about 54° F. in southern Sweden). This is probably the\r\nperiod of formation of the Ragunda moraines, and of a readvance of\r\nthe glaciers on the Norwegian side of the divide, when the snow-line\r\nlay 200-300 metres lower than at present; it was also the time of\r\nthe Daun readvance in the Alps. But as the land sank in the north\r\nand rose in the south, the waters of the _Ancylus_ lake retreated\r\nfarther and farther north, and the summers became hot and dusty, with\r\na mean July temperature of about 60° F. Everywhere in the Baltic\r\nregions the older _Ancylus_ beds show a monotonous pine-wood, but\r\nin the upper _Ancylus_ these are followed closely by a number of\r\nplants and shrubs of southern type—black alder, curled birch, linden,\r\netc. The temperature continued to rise, and oak, Norway maple, ash,\r\nand finally, in the southernmost parts of Sweden, the common maple\r\nappeared. The last-named plant has been found below the present level\r\nof the sea in Ystad Harbour.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these conditions the remnant of the\r\nScandinavian ice-sheet again decreased in size, until it split into\r\ntwo portions, the break occurring at Ragunda, and this is considered\r\nby Scandinavian geologists to mark the end of the Ice Age in Europe.\r\nGunnar Andersson compares the climate of southern Sweden at this time\r\nto the Baraba Steppes in western Siberia, with an annual rainfall\r\nof 12 to 16 inches, but this seems an extreme estimate. The “Karst”\r\nflora of the limestone areas of south-east Europe immigrated into\r\neastern Sweden during this period, and south-east Europe probably\r\ngives a better idea of the climate of Sweden during the continental\r\nphase. Farther east, in Finland, Kupffer describes the climate as\r\nresembling that of central Russia. In central Germany the climate was\r\ndry, with a mean temperature in the four summer months of 63° F.;\r\nit resembled that of south-west Russia. This period of warm summers\r\nbegan earlier in Germany than in Sweden, and throughout this phase\r\nScandinavia was occupied by a rich forest flora. The hazel extended\r\nseveral degrees north of its present position, and to higher levels,\r\nindicating a July temperature about 7° F. higher than the present. In\r\nsouthern Norway the pine extended to much greater heights. But the\r\nivy and yew, whose limits depend on the winter rather than on the\r\nsummer temperature, showed no such extension, indicating that the\r\nwinters remained severe. In Denmark there was a dry climate, fairly\r\nwarm at the close, with fir forests, though western Denmark is now\r\ntoo wet for this tree. On the coast of Norway the seas were still\r\ncold, so that there is a contrast between the animal life of the sea\r\nand the plant life of the land. The Alps also became warm and dry,\r\nand were occupied by a xerophilous flora.\r\n\r\nAs the glacial anticyclone decreased in intensity, depressions from\r\nthe Atlantic began to take a more northerly course, but were held up\r\nnear the British Isles and materially increased the rainfall. This is\r\nthe first peat-bog period of these islands, when the birch and pine\r\nforests which had covered the non-glaciated lands during the cold\r\ndry period gave way to extensive growths of peat-bogs. Southern and\r\neastern England, however, largely escaped this damp period, sharing\r\nin the dry climate of the Continent.\r\n\r\nThe absence of storms off the north-west coast of Norway is shown by\r\nthe forests which at this period covered all the outermost islands\r\nof Norway as far as Ingo Island, off North Cape. These islands are\r\nnow barren, and their afforestation indicates a drier and especially\r\na less stormy climate than the present, with a decreased frequency\r\nof winds from the sea. These conditions were well developed about\r\n5000 B.C. This is the Early Neolithic period. Owing to the great\r\ndevelopment of forests, this period is sometimes called the _Early\r\nForest period_.\r\n\r\nThe late-glacial history of North America was equally complicated.\r\nConsider first the region of the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Great\r\nLakes. As the Wisconsin ice-sheet retreated across the present\r\nsite of the Lakes, the latter underwent a remarkable series of\r\nfluctuations of area and outflow, which have been made the subject\r\nof brilliant studies by several American geologists. The opening\r\nstage began when the ice abandoned the high ground south of the\r\nlakes, leaving depressions bounded on the south by the hills and\r\non the north by the ice. The earliest of these in the basins of\r\nLakes Erie and Huron are known as the first and second Lake Maumee.\r\nThese gradually grew in size and coalesced, forming several series\r\nof connected lakes, to which various names have been given; thus\r\nLake Warren extended well outside the present limits of Lake Erie\r\nand southern Huron, and was held up by ice over Lake Ontario and\r\nnorthern Huron. At a later stage an enormous Lake Algonquin extended\r\nbeyond the combined limits of Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron, and\r\ncommunicated by broad channels with an enlarged Lake Ontario known\r\nas Lake Iroquois, and with Lake Erie. But even before this time the\r\nnorthern shores of the lakes, relieved of the major portion of their\r\nice-load, had begun to rise rapidly, and ultimately reduced the lakes\r\nto their present size.\r\n\r\nThese great areas of ice-cold water, bathing the southern edges\r\nof the ice-sheet, must have had an unfavourable influence on the\r\nclimate, keeping it cold and damp, and preventing dry continental\r\nconditions from becoming established. They probably retarded the\r\nice-retreat in these regions quite considerably, so that a lobe of\r\nice was left here long after the edge had retreated northwards on\r\neither side. At the same time the climate further south was dry, with\r\næolian deposits; but as the anticyclonic winds blew off the Atlantic\r\nthe evidence of drought is not so marked as in Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter this slow retreat had been in progress for a considerable time\r\na submergence, known as the “_Champlain stage_” set in, reaching a\r\ndepth of at least 600 feet and opening the St. Lawrence regions\r\nwide to the Atlantic, which penetrated into Lake Ontario. The ice\r\nnow retreated rapidly under the influence of a maritime climate\r\nlittle colder than the present. In phase this period corresponds\r\nto the second _Yoldia Sea_ stage of Scandinavia; in point of time\r\nit was probably somewhat earlier. This was followed by elevation,\r\nthe first result of which was to cut off the warm water and cause a\r\nsharp fall of temperature exactly analogous to that of the Ragunda\r\nmoraines, but a few thousand years earlier and probably more marked.\r\nThe continuance of elevation brought on a long continental period\r\nof extreme aridity, when trees grew on the peat-bogs of the eastern\r\nStates, while the lakes of the Great Basin further west were almost\r\nor wholly dried up. At the maximum of the continental conditions the\r\nsummers at least were warmer than at present, as indicated by the\r\nnorthward extension of various species of plants and fresh-water\r\nmollusca. The winters were probably more severe. Possibly the great\r\naridity of this period was partly due to a sub-glacial continental\r\nanticyclone obstructing the path of depressions across America from\r\nwest to east. The drainage area of the Great Basin received hardly\r\nany rainfall and was a hopeless desert, but the Atlantic States were\r\nable to grow trees on the old peat-bogs, probably with rainfall\r\nderived from the Atlantic. By reference to the cutting of Niagara\r\ngorge, we can infer that the warm dry period began about 6000 B.C.,\r\nso that it corresponds exactly with the continental phase (_Ancylus_\r\nstage) of Europe. This period of aridity was finally ended by a fresh\r\nsubmergence, the “_Micmac_,” which carried the land about twenty feet\r\nbelow its present level.\r\n\r\nIn Yukon and Alaska, where the glaciation was not nearly so severe as\r\nfurther to the south-east, the depression of the land by the ice-load\r\nand consequently the subsequent rise on its removal were not great.\r\nThere were no complicated geographical changes, and correspondingly\r\nthere appear to have been no fluctuations of climate, but only a\r\ngradual passage to present conditions.\r\n\r\nEven in Iceland there are indications of a dry period following the\r\nlast glacial maximum, for tree-trunks, buried in the peat-bogs, show\r\nthat the birch formerly had a much greater extension. It is also\r\nquite possible that there was an accentuation of desert conditions in\r\nAsia during the retreat of the glaciers in Europe and North America,\r\nwhich may have played a part in the wave of Neolithic migration that\r\nappears to have overwhelmed the artistic Palæolithic races of western\r\nEurope; but of this we have as yet no direct evidence. The Neolithic\r\ninvasion of Europe took place along two main routes, the Nordics\r\npassing from the centre of Asia north of the Caspian, across Russia\r\nto the Baltic shores, where they became the Kitchen-midden people;\r\nand the Alpine race passing from Transbaikalia, south of the Caspian\r\nand Black Sea, into southern Europe. The Nordics drove before them\r\nan older race, characterized by the transitional Maglemose culture,\r\nwhich passed from east of Russia to the shores of the Baltic and\r\nultimately to England, where harpoons of Maglemose type have been\r\nfound beneath the peat of Holderness.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere the continental phase does not appear\r\nto have been so well developed. The uppermost part of the Pampean\r\nloess is possibly post-glacial; more certainly so are the sand-dunes\r\non the coast near Buenos Aires, in which human remains have been\r\nfound in association with the bones of some extinct animals. In New\r\nSouth Wales, after the retreat of the glaciers, there was a period\r\nwith land a little above its present level, so that the stools of\r\nEucalyptus trees are now found ten feet below sea-level; but there is\r\nno evidence as to the climate of this stage. In New Zealand we have\r\nno definite post-glacial beds of continental type. The occurrence of\r\nxerophilous plants, such as _Aciphylla_, still living in a climate\r\nwhich is now decidedly moist, may be a remnant of a continental phase\r\nin New Zealand, or may date back to the steppe conditions of the\r\nloess.

The existence of this\r\nphase was the chief point brought out in the great collection of\r\npapers communicated to the Stockholm meeting of the International\r\nGeological Congress, which has frequently been referred to in\r\nthis volume. The pioneer work on the subject has been done by the\r\nScandinavian geologists, and we may commence with a discussion of\r\nthis period in the countries bordering on the Baltic.\r\n\r\nAbout 4000 B.C., at the conclusion of the continental phase referred\r\nto in the preceding chapter, a rapid movement of submergence set\r\nin over the whole of the southern Baltic, and shortly afterwards\r\nthe land-bar which had formerly separated the fresh waters of the\r\n_Ancylus_ lake from the Atlantic gave place to a wide strait, through\r\nwhich the waters of the ocean flowed into the Baltic across southern\r\nSweden. Ultimately this channel became wider than the present outlet\r\nbetween Sweden and Denmark, and maritime influences penetrated to\r\nall parts of the Baltic. In recognition of this influence the period\r\nwas termed by Blytt the “Atlantic stage.” The much greater freedom\r\nwith which the waters of the Atlantic were able to enter is shown by\r\na comparison of the “isohalines” of this period with those of the\r\npresent day. Isohalines indicate the degree of saltness of the water;\r\nthose of to-day can, of course, be measured directly, and show that\r\nin the Gulf of Bothnia the water becomes continually less salt as we\r\ngo northward, for which reason many species of marine mollusca are\r\nunable to live. By studying the distribution of the mollusca in the\r\n_Littorina_ Sea the isohalines of that period have been reconstructed\r\nalso, and show that the salt content was much greater than at the\r\npresent day, indicating a greater influx of oceanic waters.\r\n\r\nIf we take a map showing a reconstruction of the geography of\r\n_Littorina_ time, and apply to it the formulæ given in the Appendix,\r\ncomparing our results with the inferences of Scandinavian and north\r\nGerman geologists as to the temperature, we find that there is a\r\nremarkably good agreement. Many of the palæo-botanists comment on\r\nthe prolongation of the autumn into the present winter, which is\r\nespecially characteristic of a more insular climate. The amounts of\r\nchange in each case are also in good agreement, except perhaps in\r\nthe Christiania region and in north Denmark, where the geologists\r\nrequire a greater change than that calculated from the land and sea\r\ndistribution; this is probably accounted for by a higher temperature\r\nin the waters of the Atlantic. The maximum change as calculated\r\nis shown in south-west Finland (winter 6° F. warmer, summer 2° F.\r\ncooler). Finland is described as having at that time the climate of\r\nwestern Europe, which we may take as meaning winter 8° warmer, summer\r\n3-4° cooler. There was thus a great change from the extreme climate\r\nof the continental phase with its hot summers and severe winters and\r\nlittle rain, to an extremely temperate climate with cool summers,\r\nmild winters and a heavy rainfall. The warmth-loving plants which had\r\nbegun to immigrate during the later part of the continental phase\r\ncontinued to spread, and probably the highest average temperatures\r\nwere reached at the time of maximum submergence, but now they were\r\naccompanied by plants for which a large rainfall is necessary, and it\r\nseems that the average rainfall of southern Sweden must have been\r\nabout 40 inches a year. The oak began to dominate the forests in\r\nplace of the hazel, and the peat-bogs, which during the preceding dry\r\nperiod had hardened into a firm surface on which birch and pine were\r\nable to take root, again became moist, so that the trees were choked\r\nby growths of bog-plants. On the shores lived men of the Transition\r\nand Early Neolithic. As the land rose again and the _Littorina_ Sea\r\ndecreased in area the climate again became drier and more rigorous.\r\nIn Denmark the forests of the _Ancylus_ period gave place to oak as\r\nthe land sank, and there are also remains of two water plants, the\r\nwater-nut (_Trapa natans_), which is no longer found in Denmark,\r\nand _Najas marina_, still living in one isolated locality. Northern\r\nDenmark was broken up into islands, among which marine deposits were\r\nformed, containing the remains of southern mollusca, many of which\r\nare found in the kitchen-middings. Most of the wood used by Neolithic\r\nman was oak; there is little fir and no beech.\r\n\r\nIn Norway the work of C. Brögger has made us familiar with the\r\n_Tapes_ beds, which correspond in point of time to the _Littorina_\r\nstage of the Baltic. _Tapes decussatus_ is itself a southern species\r\nof mollusc, and it is associated with a very rich warmth-loving\r\nfauna. In southern Norway the geographical conditions were different\r\nfrom those in Sweden, for the land reached its lowest level\r\nrelatively to the sea about the close of the Glacial period, and has\r\nbeen rising throughout the post-glacial. The seas show a progressive\r\nrise of temperature from 8° F. below present at the close of the\r\nGlacial period to 4° F. above the present in the older _Tapes_ beds.\r\nThe littoral climate at this stage resembled that prevailing at\r\npresent on the coast of northern England. After this, as the land\r\napproached its present level, the temperature fell again, and in the\r\nupper _Tapes_ stage was only 2° F. above the present.\r\n\r\nThe warm period represented by the _Tapes_ beds is found at intervals\r\nalong the west coast of Norway, and we again find evidence of a\r\nsubmergence of the land contemporary with the maximum temperature.\r\nThese conditions extend even as far north as Tromsö, within the\r\nArctic circle. In Spitzbergen there are raised beaches 30 to 80\r\nfeet above the sea, containing remains of molluscs and a species of\r\n_Fucus_, none of which are now living so far north. On the land there\r\nare old peat-bogs of great thickness, though peat-mosses cannot now\r\ngrow, since the ground never thaws below a depth of 6-10 inches. It\r\nhas been pointed out that a great number of the plants now living in\r\nSpitzbergen are unable to ripen their seeds under present climatic\r\nconditions, though they must have done so in the past. Ripe seeds\r\nof some species, in fact, have been found in the peat-bogs, which\r\nare contemporaneous with the raised beach. There is thus evidence\r\nof a very well-marked warm period associated with submergence in\r\nSpitsbergen.\r\n\r\nIn Franz Josef Land, Nansen found raised beaches with mussels 10 to\r\n20 feet above the present level; this shell does not now live so far\r\nnorth. In the White Sea and on the Murman coast there are also raised\r\nbeaches with a southern fauna. The warm period shown in the beds of\r\nthe New Siberian Islands has already been referred to (p. 79).\r\n\r\nReturning to the British Isles we find that in the south the land\r\nwas above its present level throughout the whole of the post-glacial\r\nperiod. On the other hand, a 25-foot beach is found in north-west\r\nEngland (Formby and Leasowe marine beds), but without any evidence\r\nas to climate; the same applies to the 25-foot beach of Scotland.\r\nIt is only when we come to the north-east of Ireland that we find\r\nevidence of conditions appreciably warmer than the present, in the\r\nsection of the Alexandra Dock, Belfast, where marine clays overlie\r\nbeds of grey sand and peat. The lower estuarine clay is essentially a\r\nlittoral clay, known as the _Scrobicularia_ zone. It is brownish-blue\r\nand sandy, and contains in abundance the roots and leaves of the\r\ngrass-wrack (_Zostera marina_), and a vast number of shells of a few\r\nspecies which live between tide-marks, indicating that the land stood\r\n10 feet or so above its present level at first, while the climate\r\ncannot have differed greatly from that prevailing at the present day.\r\nIt must have been formed during a period of gradual depression, for\r\nthroughout its six feet or more of thickness it preserves identical\r\nlittoral characters. After a time this depression became more rapid,\r\nand the upper estuarine clay began to form—a light blue clay, very\r\npure and unctuous, with a very rich and well-preserved fauna, known\r\nas the _Thracia_ zone. The fauna has a decidedly southern aspect,\r\nand indicates that the coasts of north-east Ireland had the present\r\ntemperature of Bantry Bay—an increase of at least 3° F. in the mean\r\nannual temperature. The _Thracia_ zone is followed by a bed of yellow\r\nshore sand, indicating re-elevation to about seven feet above the\r\npresent level.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to the upper estuarine clay are raised beaches at\r\na height of 25 feet in north-east Ireland, falling to 15 feet at\r\nDublin, and to only 6 or 7 feet in western Donegal and Sligo. The\r\nmollusca indicate a somewhat higher temperature than the present. In\r\nthe beaches have been found flint scrapers and arrowheads of early\r\nNeolithic type.\r\n\r\nLooking further westwards, we find that Iceland, which had undergone\r\na slight elevation during the continental phase, so that peat was\r\nformed below present sea-level, again subsided, falling to 10 or 12\r\nfeet below its present level. During this subsidence the temperature\r\nrose, the greatest warmth coinciding with the lowest level of the\r\nland. Species from the south-west shores, where the temperature of\r\nthe water is directly influenced by the Gulf Drift, extended to the\r\ncold northern coast. In some places the marine clays of this period\r\nhave been ploughed up by a subsequent readvance of the glaciers.\r\n\r\nFrom Greenland comes abundant evidence of a post-glacial warm period\r\ncoincident with a subsidence of about 80 feet. Raised beaches all\r\nalong the west coast contain mollusca, some species of which are not\r\nnow living north of the St. Lawrence estuary. On the other hand,\r\nsome northern species which lived off the west coast during the\r\nglacial maximum retreated northwards during this period, and have\r\nnot re-established themselves, though the climate is now suitable.\r\nFurther, K. Steenstrup describes the occurrence of “dead ice” at\r\nseveral places in North Greenland—masses of ice which have become\r\nseparated from their parent glaciers owing to rapid recession,\r\nand are now buried in morainic matter. Subsequently the ice again\r\nadvanced, and in some cases a new glacier has advanced over these\r\nmasses of “dead ice.”\r\n\r\nPassing to the mainland of North America, we find in eastern Canada\r\ncolonies of southern mollusca, especially oysters and quohogs,\r\nseparated from their main area of distribution south of Cape Cod\r\nby a wide area of cold seas—the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy. At\r\nthe beginning of the warm phase the land lay slightly below its\r\npresent level, but subsequently rose above it. The climate became\r\nstill warmer, until its temperature resembled that of the middle New\r\nEngland States. At the same time the rainfall diminished and the\r\npeat-bogs were replaced by forests of hardwood trees. In the basin of\r\nthe Great Lakes the warm period is represented by gravel beds in the\r\nNiagara gorge, which from their position must, according to the most\r\nrecent determinations, have been formed about 4000 to 3000 B.C. These\r\ngravels contain shells of fresh-water mollusca, especially species of\r\n_Unio_, which are not now living in the St. Lawrence system, but are\r\nfound in tributaries of the Mississippi further south. Further south\r\non the eastern coast of the United States there are marine deposits\r\nindicating a slight submergence, with a climate somewhat warmer than\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nPassing to South America, we find in southern Patagonia and Tierra\r\ndel Fuego exactly similar evidence of a post-glacial subsidence with\r\na warmer climate than the present. Raised beaches at a height of 50\r\nfeet contain mollusca, some of which are now rare or extinct in that\r\nlocality, and in sheltered situations plants are found still living\r\nwhose nearest neighbours are some way to the north.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, in southern and eastern Australia there are beaches\r\na few feet above present level, containing warmth-loving species of\r\nmollusca and indicating a post-glacial warm period. There is some\r\nevidence in the distribution of plants and marine mollusca that this\r\nwarm period extended to New Zealand. Raised beaches at a height of\r\n50 to 180 feet are also known from many places in Antarctica, and\r\nthese contain mollusca, some of which are not now living south of\r\nthe sub-antarctic islands. An interesting confirmation of this has\r\nbeen given by E. Philippi, from the results of an examination of the\r\nsea-floor at four points in about 63° S., 75-95° E., all within the\r\npresent limit of pack-ice. The deposit at present forming is poor\r\nin pelagic foraminifera, and consequently contains little lime, but\r\nthis deposit is very thin, and beneath it is a much more calcareous\r\nclay especially rich in _Globigerina_. The latter deposit is still\r\nforming north of the limit of pack-ice, and Philippi concludes\r\nthat at no very distant date the limits of ice were further south,\r\nindicating warmer conditions. It is interesting to note that a\r\nsimilar sequence has been found in the Norwegian North Sea, the brown\r\nforaminiferous deposit (in this case containing _Biloculina_) being\r\nknown to be underlain as well as overlain by an unfossiliferous\r\ngrey clay attributed to the Glacial period. Finally, with regard to\r\nCape Colony, A. W. Rodgers says: “It is possible that the presence\r\nof marine mollusca belonging to species that are only known in the\r\nliving state from the coast north of Pondoland, in the raised beaches\r\nof Mossel and Algoa Bays, indicates that the sea on the south coast\r\nwas formerly warmer than now.”\r\n\r\nThus we have evidence of a period of submergence and climates warmer\r\nthan the present from a large number of places, including the Arctic\r\nOcean and Greenland, the temperate coasts of North America and\r\nEurope, the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. The stage appears to be\r\nmissing on the temperate coasts of the Pacific, on both the Asiatic\r\nand North American sides, and from the whole of the Tropics. It is\r\nfairly certain that the warm period occurred at the same time in\r\neastern North America and western Europe; in the case of the southern\r\nhemisphere we have no direct proof of this, but in all cases the\r\ndeposits are comparatively recent, and since they obviously refer to\r\na similar state of affairs we may assume that they are of the same\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nIn the Baltic area we know that the great change of level was due\r\nlargely to a subsidence of the land and only to a small extent to\r\na rise of the sea. But in other parts of the world the amount of\r\nsubmergence was remarkably uniform at places in the same latitude,\r\nand decreased steadily from the polar regions to about latitude\r\n40-50°, where it became zero. Now such a general change suggests that\r\nit was the sea which rose rather than the land which sank, and points\r\nto some general cause which piled up the waters of the oceans in the\r\nhigher latitudes. A possible cause of this nature has been adduced\r\nby O. Pettersson, which he terms the “tide-generating force,” which\r\nreached one of its maxima in an 1800-year cycle about 3500 B.C. This\r\npossibility will be dealt with more fully in Chapter XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  _Bericht Internat.

By 3000 B.C., or towards the close of the Neolithic\r\nperiod, considerable elevation had again taken place over the central\r\nlatitudes of western Europe (the northern parts of Norway and Sweden\r\nwere still several hundred feet below their present level). The\r\nsouthern part of the British Isles, which had remained slightly\r\nelevated since the last Glacial period, had now emerged to a height\r\nof nearly ninety feet above its present level; the area of Ireland\r\nhad increased appreciably and part of the North Sea was land. The\r\ngeographical changes were not great, but they were sufficient to turn\r\nthe scale in the direction of a continental climate in the British\r\nIsles. The more or less complete closing of the Straits of Dover, and\r\nthe consequent bar to the free circulation of the Gulf Drift, must\r\nhave had an appreciable effect on the climate in the direction of\r\ncontinentality. At the same time the low level of northern Norway,\r\nand possibly the persistence of warm conditions in the Arctic basin,\r\nmore and more attracted depressions to the northernmost track, so\r\nthat the British Isles especially, and to a lesser extent Holland,\r\nGermany, southern Scandinavia and Russia, came more persistently\r\nunder the influence of anticyclonic conditions. The rainfall of\r\nthese countries diminished, and the surface of the bogs dried\r\nsufficiently to enable forests to grow in the western countries; in\r\nGermany heath-plants took the place of bog-plants, while in Russia\r\nsteppe conditions supervened. The normal meteorological conditions at\r\nthis time in fact resembled those of the memorable drought of 1921,\r\nwhich was characterized by low pressure and stormy conditions in\r\nthe Arctic Ocean and a belt of high pressure and persistently fine\r\nweather across central Europe.\r\n\r\nDuring this phase the winters may have been severe, but the summers\r\nwere warmer than the present, for in the peat-bogs of Ireland and\r\nScotland are the remains of trees larger than any now found in the\r\nneighbourhood. The Irish bogs dried so completely that they were\r\nextensively inhabited; corded oak roads have been found at this\r\nhorizon, while in 1883 a two-story log house, surrounded by an\r\nenclosure, was found in Drumkelin Bog, Co. Donegal; it was twelve\r\nfeet square and nine feet in height, and a roadway led to it across\r\nthe bog. Both house and roadway were entirely constructed of oak.\r\nWith the hut were found a stone chisel and a flint arrowhead. Beneath\r\nthe floor were fourteen feet of bog, and above the floor twenty-six\r\nfeet. This time was also one of relatively little wind movement,\r\nfor stools occur even in exposed positions on the mountain slopes\r\nof western Ireland, where trees will only grow now in sheltered\r\npositions near sea-level.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of the very dry climate of this phase is the\r\nfrequent occurrence of trees apparently _in situ_ beneath the surface\r\nof fresh-water lakes, both in Ireland and Scandinavia. I was able to\r\nexamine one very good example near Lough Toome in north-west Ireland.\r\nAn unusually dry spring had lowered the surface of the water and\r\na large number of tree-stools were exposed; when these trees were\r\ngrowing the water-surface must have been at least two feet below\r\nthe level of the present outlet. Most of the lakes in which these\r\nstools are found are shallow upland basins with a small drainage\r\narea, and if the present climate became drier they would more or less\r\ncompletely disappear.\r\n\r\nMr. Fairgrieve has noted the action of blown sand on the westward\r\nside of broken-off tree-stumps in a submerged forest on the shore in\r\nsouth Wales, which, though not conclusive, suggests dry conditions.\r\nMr. Fairgrieve also noted the direction of fall of twenty-one trees,\r\nand found that in the great majority of cases they were blown down by\r\nwesterly winds.\r\n\r\nThe forest phase was short; according to the late C. Reid the land\r\nagain began to subside shortly after 3000 B.C., and by 1600 B.C.,\r\nin Britain at least, had reached its present level; this carries\r\nus to the beginning of the Bronze Age. In connexion with Ellsworth\r\nHuntington’s theory that the dampness of Ireland lowers the energy\r\nof its inhabitants, it is interesting to note that this dry period\r\napparently corresponds to the legendary Heroic Age, when the vigour\r\nof the Irish reached a level never since attained. Civilization in\r\nScandinavia also seems to have benefited by the drier conditions,\r\nfor Scandinavian technique advanced rapidly to a high level about\r\n1800 B.C. But though there is evidence of a considerable sea-borne\r\ncommerce with Britain and Ireland, there appears to have been\r\ncomparatively little land traffic between different parts of\r\nScandinavia at this time. In fact, to primitive man dense forest with\r\nthick undergrowth was almost impenetrable. But at the close of the\r\nforest phase and the beginning of the peat-bog phase the trees were\r\nweakening under conditions becoming unfavourable. Such dying forests\r\nare marked by the absence of undergrowth and young trees, and afford\r\nsafe and easy land communication. Accordingly we find that by 1500\r\nB.C. a considerable traffic had developed across Scandinavia by land.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have no direct evidence, the meteorological conditions\r\nsuggest very strongly that the dry belt extended across Russia into\r\nSiberia as a marked period of desiccation, possibly worse than any\r\ndroughts of the historic period. At present Siberia receives its\r\nrainfall mainly from depressions which cross Russia from the Baltic\r\nor Black Seas, and follow a well-marked track north of the central\r\nAsiatic mountains. But during the forest period these tracks were\r\nabandoned, and the majority of the depressions passed north-eastward\r\noff the coast of Norway into the Arctic Ocean. The result must\r\nhave been a great diminution of rainfall over the continent. We\r\nshall see later (Chapter XIX) that this period of drought was of\r\nextraordinary importance in human history. For during the moist\r\nmaritime phase central and eastern Europe, and probably also Asia,\r\nhad become extensively peopled by neolithic nomads of Aryan and\r\nSemitic races, while the great river valleys of the south were in\r\nthe possession of dense agricultural populations in a more advanced\r\nstate of civilization. As the climate became progressively drier and\r\nthe pasture diminished, the land was unable to support such a large\r\nnomadic population, and there was a great outburst of raiding and\r\nconquering expeditions directed southwards and westwards, resulting\r\nin a succession of empires in the rich Mesopotamian regions and\r\nneighbouring countries, which form the beginnings of our history. The\r\nbeginnings of history in China also, about 2500 B.C., show that at\r\nthis time the settled peoples of that country were in trouble with\r\nthe nomads of the interior.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Reid, C. “Submerged forests.” Cambridge University Press, 1913.\r\n\r\n  Lewis, F.

TO A.D. 500\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 1800 B.C., or the beginning of the Bronze Age in Britain, the\r\nsubsiding land finally attained approximately its present level. At\r\nthe same time the climate of western Europe deteriorated, becoming\r\nmuch more humid and rainy, and there set in a period of intense\r\npeat-formation in Ireland, Scotland and northern England, Scandinavia\r\nand North Germany, known as the Peat-Bog Period or Upper Turbarian.\r\nThe peat-beds choked and killed the forests which had developed on\r\nthe older peat-bogs, and grew up above the stools and fallen trunks,\r\nso that we have two layers of peat separated by an old forest. The\r\nforest level contains neolithic articles, the peat contains gold\r\ncollars, bronze swords and pins, and other objects of the Bronze\r\nAge. This growth also went on even over high ground, which had not\r\npreviously been covered by peat, for Professor Henry informs us that\r\non Copped Mountain, near Enniskillen, and at other places in Ireland,\r\nBronze Age cairns and tumuli are found resting on rock and covered\r\nby several feet of bog. Peat-beds on the Frisian dunes between two\r\nlayers of blown sand are dated about 100 B.C., and some bogs in\r\nnorthern France were formed during the Roman period. There is also\r\nsome much-disputed contemporary Latin evidence that at the time of\r\nthe Roman occupation the climate of Britain was damp and boggy, while\r\nGibbon (“Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire”), referring to the\r\nclimate of central Europe at the beginning of the Christian era,\r\npoints to some evidence that the climate was colder. This is, that\r\nthe Rhine and the Danube were frequently frozen over, so that the\r\nnatives crossed them with cavalry and wagons without difficulty,\r\nalthough at the present time this never happens. It is possible\r\nthat this severe climate is referred to in the Germanic legend of\r\nthe “Twilight of the Gods,” when frost and snow ruled the world\r\nfor generations. The Norse sagas point to a similar cold period in\r\nScandinavia. This lapse of climate occurred in the Early Iron Age,\r\nabout 650 to 400 B.C., when there was a rapid deterioration from the\r\nhigh Scandinavian civilization of the Bronze Age. This deterioration\r\nof culture was probably the direct result of the increased severity\r\nof the climate.\r\n\r\nThis Pluvial period has been made the subject of special studies\r\nby Ellsworth Huntington in several important books and papers; he\r\nfinds evidence of a distinctly Pluvial period in three regions—the\r\nMediterranean, central and south-western Asia, and an area including\r\nthe southern United States and northern Mexico. In the first of\r\nthese, the Mediterranean, Huntington considers that the Græco-Roman\r\ncivilizations grew up in a period of increased rainfall which lasted\r\nfrom about 500 B.C. to A.D. 200. These states were able to develop\r\nin comparative peace because during this time there were no great\r\ninvasions of nomadic peoples from eastern Europe or central Asia,\r\na fact which points to good rainfall in these comparatively dry\r\nregions, so that their inhabitants had no need to emigrate in quest\r\nof a living. In the Mediterranean itself the heavier rainfall allowed\r\na solid agricultural basis which produced a sturdy race of peasants\r\nwho made good soldiers. Owing to the greater cyclonic control of\r\nclimate and consequent changeable weather, these inhabitants were\r\nmore vigorous in mind and body, for Huntington’s researches have\r\ndemonstrated that long spells of monotonous weather, either fine\r\nor rainy, are unfavourable for human energy. Finally the heavier\r\nrainfall maintained a perennial flow in the rivers, giving plentiful\r\nsupplies of good drinking water. These conditions broke down earlier\r\nin Greece than in Italy, as the latter naturally has a heavier\r\nrainfall. Huntington considers that the decline of Greece was largely\r\ndue to malarial poisoning, the decreasing rainfall causing the\r\nriver-flow to break down in summer, leaving isolated pools forming a\r\nbreeding ground for mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nAfter A.D. 200 the climate of Italy also deteriorated. The decrease\r\nof rainfall, combined with gradual exhaustion of the soil, made\r\nwheat-growing more and more difficult for the small agriculturalist,\r\nand the farms came into the hands of large landowners, who worked\r\nthem by slave labour, and in place of wheat either grew vines or\r\nolives or raised flocks and herds. The agricultural population\r\ngravitated to Rome and a few other large cities, and had to be fed by\r\nimported wheat. The decline was probably aided by the introduction of\r\nmalaria, as in Greece.\r\n\r\nIn north Africa and Palestine the question is more debatable. C.\r\nNegro, who has investigated the supposed desiccation of Cyrenaica,\r\nconcludes that there has been no change of climate since Roman times,\r\nbut a careful study of his evidence suggests that his conclusions are\r\nopen to criticism. All that he has proved is that there has been no\r\nmarked _progressive_ decrease of rainfall since about A.D. 200; he\r\nhas ignored the possibility of great fluctuations before and since\r\nthat date. In north Africa it seems difficult to believe that the\r\ngreat cities of antiquity could have existed under present climatic\r\nconditions, but when we turn to Palmyra in the Syrian desert we have\r\npractically incontrovertible proof in the great aqueducts, built to\r\ncarry from the hill-springs to the city large volumes of water which\r\nthese springs no longer deliver, so that even where they are intact\r\nthe aqueducts now carry only the merest trickle.\r\n\r\nIn Persia we find numerous ruins, which point to a much greater\r\npopulation two thousand or more years ago. This population lived\r\nby agriculture, and the remains of their irrigation works are now\r\nfound in regions where running water never comes. Even the scanty\r\npopulation of to-day can hardly live on the present rainfall of the\r\ncountry, and it is unbelievable that the much greater population\r\nindicated by these ruined cities could have existed without a very\r\nmuch greater supply of water. The same condition is indicated by the\r\nruined cities of the great deserts of central Asia. These cities were\r\ninhabited by agriculturalists, and the remains of tilled fields,\r\nterraces and irrigation works abound in places where the supply of\r\nbrackish water would now be barely sufficient for drinking purposes\r\nfor such a large population. Huntington has also made a careful study\r\nof the water-level of the Caspian Sea in classical times, and finds\r\nthat there was a great period of high water extending from unknown\r\nantiquity to about A.D. 400.\r\n\r\nThere is only one region in central Asia where the population appears\r\nto have been less in classical times than now, and that is the high\r\nbasin of Kashmir. Huntington points out that this basin is at present\r\nnear the upward limit of agriculture, and any fall of temperature\r\nand increase of snowfall would drive out the inhabitants. But local\r\nlegends point to such a period in the remote past, corresponding to\r\nthe period of increased habitability of the central Asian deserts; at\r\nits close there were extensive migrations from Turkestan into Kashmir.\r\n\r\nPassing to America, we come to interesting evidence of a very\r\ndifferent class—I refer to the “big trees” (_Sequoia_) of California.\r\nSince these trees live in a semi-arid climate, the amount of rainfall\r\nis the chief factor in their growth, which finds an expression in\r\nthe breadth of the annual rings measured on the stump of the tree\r\nwhen it is cut down. The method of utilizing the data was due to\r\nA. E. Douglass. A careful comparison was first made between the\r\nmeasurements of rings and the rainfall measured at neighbouring\r\nstations, and a formula was developed by which the rainfall of each\r\nyear could be reconstructed from the tree-growth with a high degree\r\nof accuracy. In extrapolating to find the rainfall for earlier years\r\nbefore rainfall measurements began, various corrections had to be\r\napplied, for instance trees grow more rapidly when young than when\r\nthey are old, while trees which are likely to live to a great age\r\ngrow more slowly at first than trees which die younger. These methods\r\nwere applied to nearly two thousand “big trees,” some of which were\r\nfound to be four thousand years old, but it is pointed out that the\r\ncorrections eliminate any progressive variation of climate which may\r\nhave occurred, so that the results show only “cycles” of greater or\r\nlesser length. Summing up, Huntington says: “Judging from what we\r\nhave seen of the rainfall of to-day and its relation to the growth\r\nof the Sequoias, high portions of their curve (of growth) seem to\r\nindicate periods when the winters were longer than now, when storms\r\nbegan earlier in the fall and lasted later into the spring, and\r\nwhen mid-winter was characterized by the great development of a\r\ncold continental high-pressure area, which pushed the storms of the\r\nprevailing zone of westerly winds far down into sub-tropical regions\r\nand thus caused sub-tropical conditions to invade what is now the\r\nzone of equatorial rains.” Neglecting later favourable periods,\r\nwhich are relatively short and unimportant, it is found that these\r\nconditions prevailed very markedly between 1200 B.C. and A.D. 200,\r\nwith maxima about 1150 B.C., 700 B.C., and from 450 B.C. to 250 B.C.\r\n\r\nThus over the greater part of the temperate regions of the northern\r\nhemisphere we have evidence of an important rainy period between the\r\nextreme limits of 1800 B.C. and A.D. 400 or 500. This period was best\r\ndeveloped from 1200 B.C. to A.D. 200, and reached its maximum about\r\n400 B.C. It constitutes a remarkable wave of climatic variation,\r\nwhich is hitherto without adequate explanation. A somewhat similar,\r\nthough less intense, wave which occurred about A.D. 1200-1300, and\r\nwhich is described in the following chapter, was associated by Wolf\r\nto a great outburst of sunspots which took place about A.D. 1200. It\r\nis well known that sunspots are an index of solar activity, the sun’s\r\nradiation being greater at times of spot maximum than at times of\r\nspot minimum. Greater solar radiation increases the evaporation over\r\nthe oceans, so that the air becomes more humid. This moist air is\r\ncarried by atmospheric currents over the land, where the moisture is\r\ncondensed into clouds and greatly increases the rainfall. At the same\r\ntime the cloud canopy shuts off some of the direct heat of the sun,\r\nand we have the curious paradox that at times of sunspot maximum, or\r\ngreatest solar radiation, the temperature of the earth’s surface is\r\nlowest.\r\n\r\nThe connexion outlined above is, however, extremely problematical\r\nfor temperate regions. Since the absolute sunspot maximum at A.D.\r\n1200 is also very doubtful, it will be realized that the evidence for\r\nthe sunspot hypothesis of the mediæval rainfall maximum is extremely\r\nslender. Furthermore, since we know nothing whatever about the solar\r\nactivity during the classical rainfall maximum, we are still less in\r\na position to extend the sunspot hypothesis to that period also.\r\n\r\nThe interesting theory recently put forward by O. Pettersson, already\r\nalluded to, provides a plausible alternative explanation of the\r\nsevere stormy climate of the Peat-bog period, which reached a maximum\r\nnear 400 B.C. Without going into details this theory is that the\r\nstrength of the tides depends on the relative positions of the sun\r\nand moon, and the tides are greatest when these act in conjunction,\r\nand also when they are nearest to the earth. This fluctuation of\r\nstrength passes through various cyclic variations with periods of\r\nnine years, about ninety years and about 1800 years, though the\r\nlengths of the periods are not constant. The latter cycle is most\r\nimportant to our purposes; according to Pettersson’s calculations\r\nthe fluctuations of the “tide-generating force” were as follow:\r\n\r\n      Maxima 3500 B.C.   2100 B.C.   350 B.C.   A.D. 1434\r\n      Minima 2800 B.C.   1200 B.C.   A.D. 530.\r\n\r\nIncreased range of the tides means increased circulation in the\r\nwaters of the oceans, especially an increased interchange between the\r\nwarm North Atlantic and the cold Arctic waters. It also means than an\r\nunusual amount of ice is brought down from high into low latitudes.\r\nWide local variations of temperature of the surface waters of the\r\noceans cause increased cyclonic activity, and hence we may expect a\r\ngenerally increased storminess at times of maximum “tide-generating\r\nforce,” and the reverse at times of minimum.\r\n\r\nFor the last maximum (A.D. 1434) Pettersson is able to adduce a good\r\ndeal of historical evidence of increased storminess in north-west\r\nEurope and bad ice-conditions near Iceland and Greenland, while\r\nHuntington has found an increase of rainfall shown by the big trees\r\nof California. The next preceding maximum, that of 360 B.C., marks\r\nthe culminating point of the Peat-bog phase. The Norse sagas and\r\nthe Germanic myths point to a severe climate about 650 B.C., which\r\ndestroyed an early civilization. This was the “Twilight of the Gods,”\r\nwhen frost and snow ruled the world for generations. The period\r\nwas the Early Iron Age, when civilization deteriorated greatly in\r\nnorth-west Europe.\r\n\r\nOf the maximum of 2100 B.C. there is no trace. It is possible that\r\nthe great Atlantic submergence of the Maritime phase is connected\r\nwith the tidal maximum of 3500 B.C., but the phenomena were on a\r\nscale so much greater than those of the more recent maxima that this\r\ncan hardly have been the sole cause.\r\n\r\nThe minima should have been characterized by periods of relatively\r\nquiet stable climate with little ice near Iceland and Greenland.\r\nThat the last minimum, in A.D. 530, was such a period there is\r\nconsiderable evidence in the high level reached by civilization at\r\nthat period in Scandinavia and by the revival in Ireland. Again,\r\nabout 1200 B.C., in the early part of the Peat-bog phase, there\r\nis evidence of considerable traffic by sea between Scandinavia\r\nand Ireland. The Irish Museum has lately discovered a hoard of\r\ngold objects dated about 1000 B.C., in which the designs show a\r\nScandinavian origin. The minimum of 2800 B.C., which occurred in the\r\nForest phase, may have contributed to the dry climate of that period,\r\nbut otherwise has left no trace.\r\n\r\nAlthough at first sight the effect which Pettersson sets out to\r\nexplain seems out of all proportion to the smallness of his cause,\r\nthe coincidences after 2000 B.C. are extremely interesting, and\r\nsuggest that after the land and sea distribution reached its present\r\nform the astronomical cause adduced by Pettersson was possibly\r\neffective, but before that date the astronomical cause, if it\r\nexisted, was masked by the much greater climatic variations due to\r\nchanges in the land and sea distribution.\r\n\r\nThe opinion has frequently been expressed that the “Classical” and\r\n“Mediæval” rainfall maxima were phenomena similar to the Glacial\r\nperiod, but less intensive. This view is often carried to its logical\r\nconclusion, that the thirty-five-year cycle, the eleven-year,\r\nand still smaller cycles of climate, are also part of the same\r\nseries, and that the Glacial period and, let us say, the three-year\r\nperiodicity of rainfall are therefore due to variations of the same\r\nagent, in this case the sun. This logical extension of the theory\r\nis, however, completely untenable. The eleven-year periodicity is\r\nadmittedly connected with variations in the solar activity, but there\r\nare other cycles which are completely independent of such variations,\r\nsuch as, for instance, the annual variation undergone by all\r\nmeteorological elements, which depends entirely on the inclination\r\nof the earth’s axis. There is a well-marked 4.8 year period in the\r\namount of ice off Iceland, the half-cycle of which is exactly equal\r\nto the distance travelled by the water taking part in the North\r\nAtlantic circulation, divided by the velocity with which it travels.\r\nThere is, therefore, no _a priori_ reason for assuming that the cause\r\nof the Glacial period was identical with the cause of the Classical\r\nand Mediæval rainfall maxima. Further, in the latter case, the chief\r\nphenomenon was the increase of rainfall; the decrease of temperature\r\nwas merely incidental, but in the Glacial period the outstanding\r\nfeature was a great lowering of temperature in the polar and\r\ntemperate regions, and in this case it was the increase of rainfall\r\nwhich was incidental.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Lewis, F.

It is admitted\r\nthat there have been shiftings of the centres of population and\r\ncivilization, first from Egypt and Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean\r\nregions, and later to northern and western Europe, but these have\r\nbeen attributed chiefly to political causes, and especially to the\r\nrise of Islam and the rule of the “accursed Turk.” Recently, however,\r\nthere has arisen a class of evidence which cannot be explained away\r\non political grounds, and which appears to have decided the battle\r\nin favour of the supporters of change; I refer to the evidence of\r\nthe trees, explained in the preceding chapter. The conclusions\r\nderived from the big trees of California have fallen admirably into\r\nline with archæological work in central America, in central Asia\r\nand other regions, and have shown that the larger variations even\r\nof comparatively recent times have been very extensive, if not\r\nworld-wide, in their development.\r\n\r\nLet us consider first the evidence of the trees. These indicate\r\nthat after the moist period ending about A.D. 400, described in the\r\npreceding chapter, the rainfall was generally light until about A.D.\r\n1000, when it showed a sharp rise, probably to the level attained in\r\nA.D. 1. (The correction for age renders an exact comparison between\r\nperiods a thousand years apart difficult.) This period of abundant\r\nrainfall lasted some fifty years, followed by a gradual decline to a\r\nbrief minimum, shortly before A.D. 1200. About 1300 occurred another\r\nrapid rise, reaching a maximum before 1350; the period of heavy rain\r\ncontinued a short while after 1400, when a decline set in, reaching\r\na minimum at 1500, after which the rainfall recovered somewhat, and\r\nsubsequently maintained approximately its present level, with a\r\nslight maximum about 1600 to 1645.\r\n\r\nIn the desert of Arizona, in regions at present too dry for\r\nagriculture, there are abundant ruins, which are attributed by\r\nHuntington to three periods:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Pueblo ruins, dating back to just before the coming of the\r\nSpaniards (i.e. about A.D. 1600), and indicating merely an increase\r\nof population at the present centres.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Ruins of an older civilization, termed by Huntington the\r\nPajaritan, during which numerous inhabitants lived in places where\r\nat present no crops can be raised. “These people, as appears from\r\ntheir pottery, their skulls and their methods of agriculture, belong\r\nto a different civilization from that of the modern Pueblos who\r\ninhabited Gran Quivera at the time of the coming of the Spaniards.\r\nThey had evidently disappeared long before that date, as is evident\r\nfrom the present ruins of their villages, and from the absence of any\r\nhint of their existence in the early annals of the country” (_Geogr.\r\nJournal_, 40, 1912, p. 396).\r\n\r\nThe largest ruins of this type invariably lie near the main lines of\r\ndrainage. They consist of villages with houses of several storeys.\r\nBut digging down beneath these ruins we find (_c_) traces of an\r\nolder occupation, and ruins of a primitive type are also found on\r\nthe plateaus remote from any except small valleys. “They are usually\r\nsmall, and are greatly ruined, and seem to belong to a time long\r\nanterior to the main large ruins.” Huntington terms this type the\r\nHohokam; unfortunately this and the Pajaritan occupations cannot\r\nbe accurately dated, but it is reasonable to connect them with the\r\nrainfall maxima shown by the trees, about the time of Christ, and in\r\nA.D. 1000 to A.D. 1300.\r\n\r\nA similar succession has been found in the neighbourhood of Mexico\r\nCity. The earliest trace of occupation is a crude “mountain pottery,”\r\nin ordinary river sand and gravel. These deposits are succeeded by\r\nfiner sand with better pottery known as the “San Juan” type, above\r\nwhich comes a culture layer with the remains of houses. This is\r\ncovered by a bed of “tepetate,” a white calcareous deposit frequently\r\nfound in dry regions where much water evaporates. The gravels suggest\r\nthe occasional heavy rains of arid countries. The San Juan pottery\r\nextends throughout the “tepetate,” which probably corresponds to the\r\ndry period of A.D. 400-1000 in California.\r\n\r\nHistorical records in Mexico date back to the coming of the Aztecs in\r\nA.D. 1325. They show that in 1325 and again in 1446 the level of the\r\nlake of Mexico was high, but towards the end of the fifteenth century\r\nthe water was much lower. In 1520 it was high again; in 1600 it was\r\nlow, but high from 1629 to 1634. From 1675 to 1755 was a long dry\r\nperiod. On the whole the climate from 300 to 600 years ago seems to\r\nhave been moister than that of to-day.\r\n\r\nStill further south in the Peninsula of Yucatan recent explorations\r\nhave yielded results of extreme interest. Yucatan lies within the\r\ntropical rain-belt, and is covered by almost impenetrable forests.\r\nThe climate is enervating and unhealthy, and the present inhabitants\r\nare greatly lacking in vigour. In the forest, however, have been\r\nfound the ruins of ninety-two towns, some of them of great size,\r\nand all remarkable for the beauty as well as the solidity of their\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nThese ruins belong to the great Mayan civilization. Mayan history\r\nhas been briefly summarized by Huntington as follows: “First we have\r\na long period of active development, during which the calendar was\r\nevolved and the arts of architecture and sculpture were gradually\r\ndeveloped.... This time of marked growth must have preceded the\r\nChristian era. Then comes ... the building of the great cities of\r\nCopan, Quirigua, Tikal and others. These first great cities were in\r\nthe southern part of the Maya area, on the borders of Honduras or in\r\neastern Guatemala. They lasted perhaps three or four centuries; then\r\nquickly declined. So far as we have any evidence, civilization never\r\nrevived in this southern area, for the structures of the great period\r\nhave not been rebuilt by later inhabitants. Towards the end of the\r\nperiod of greatness the centre of Mayan culture moved northward....\r\nThe great period, according to Bowditch, lasted from 100 B.C. to\r\nA.D. 350 ... then came a time of very low civilization, lasting for\r\ncenturies.... A revival ensued about A.D. 900 or A.D. 1000, and\r\narchitecture once more reached a high pitch, but ... only in northern\r\nYucatan; all the rest of the country seems to have remained in\r\ndarkness. Moreover, this mediæval revival was relatively shortlived.\r\nSince that time the condition of the Mayas has fluctuated more or\r\nless, but on the whole there has been a decline.”\r\n\r\nNow at the present day the densest and most progressive population in\r\nYucatan is found in the driest part of the country, where the forest\r\ngives place to jungle. If the line of separation between jungle and\r\nforest were moved southward 300 miles, the former would include\r\nall the districts where ruins are now found. We see from the above\r\nsummary that the prosperous periods of Mayan history were just those\r\nperiods which in California were moist; in Yucatan they must have\r\nbeen dry. Huntington’s explanation is the theory of the “shifting of\r\nclimatic belts”; during the rainy period in California the temperate\r\nstorm-tracks were shifted further southward. At the same time the\r\nsub-tropical high-pressure belt, which at present lies over the\r\nWest Indies, was also shifted southwards, and this brought a dry\r\ncool winter to Yucatan, with an increased contrast of seasons, and\r\nconsequently a more invigorating climate.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, Huntington and other explorers have found similar traces of\r\npast variations of climate, a fascinating account of which is given\r\nin “The Pulse of Asia.” Space will not permit of a summary in detail,\r\nbut the following general conclusions may be quoted:[6]\r\n\r\n“If we omit the Volga and the European portions of the Caspian\r\ndrainage area, the limits (of the six basins considered) lie over\r\nsixteen hundred miles apart from north to south and over three\r\nthousand from east to west. All this great area seems to have been\r\nsubject to the same great waves of climatic change.\r\n\r\n“In the ancient days when the Oxus River entered the Scythian Gulf\r\nof the expanded Caspian Sea, and Lake Gyoljuk discharged permanently\r\nto the Tigris, the lake of Seyistan had not been converted into dry\r\nland by the giants. Kashmir was so cold and snowy that agriculture\r\nwas impossible.... In the Lop basin the rivers were full of water;\r\nLop-Nor was the “Great Salt Lake”; the desert was comparatively small\r\nand the zone of vegetation extensive; and on all sides there was a\r\ndensity of population and a degree of prosperity far beyond those of\r\nto-day. And in the Turfan basin the same was probably true.\r\n\r\n“A great change took place throughout the six basins during the early\r\ncenturies of the Christian era. The lakes of Gyoljuk, Seyistan, the\r\nCaspian, Lop-Nor and presumably Turfan were greatly reduced in size.\r\nIn the case of the first three, parts of the old lake-beds were used\r\nas sites for villages. Except in Kashmir, the change of climate\r\nappears to have brought disaster....\r\n\r\n“Again there came a change (about A.D. 700). The process of\r\ndesiccation gave place to a slight but important tendency toward\r\nincreased rainfall and lower temperature. Kashmir became colder and\r\nmore snowy, and hence more isolated; the rivers of Lop and Turfan\r\ngained greater volume; and the lakes of Lop, the Caspian and Turfan\r\nexpanded once more. The habitability of the arid regions began to\r\nincrease; migrations came to an end; and central Asia was prosperous\r\nfor a time. Finally (about 1350) a latest and slightest change took\r\nplace in the other direction, and we seem to-day to be in the midst\r\nof an epoch of comparative equilibrium, with no marked tendency\r\ntowards climatic change in either direction.” There was, however, a\r\nperiod of comparatively high water in the Caspian in the early part\r\nof the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the evidence for climatic changes during historical times\r\nis more difficult to follow, since variations of rainfall leave fewer\r\ntraces in a moist than in an arid or semi-arid country. A certain\r\namount of material is given by Brückner in his “Klimaschwankungen.”\r\nHe finds that there was a great advance of the Alpine glaciers from\r\n1595 to 1610, while two Italian lakes without outlet, the Lago di\r\nFucina and Lake Trasimeno, attained a high level about the same\r\ntime. Other evidence for western Europe is derived from the date\r\nof the wine-harvest and from the records of severe winters. Like\r\nthe growth-curves of the big trees, they need a secular correction\r\nto alter the general slope of the curve, especially in the case of\r\nsevere winters, but the larger irregularities probably correspond to\r\nreal variations of climate. I have added in column 4 the numbers of\r\nwinters with sea-ice on some part of the Danish coast, as tabulated\r\nfrom the records compiled by Captain C. I. H. Speerschneider. The\r\nresults are in general agreement with column 3, particularly as\r\nshowing that the period 1401-50 was relatively mild; but the first\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century is less instead of greater than its\r\ntwo neighbours in this column.\r\n\r\nThe figures for the wine-harvest refer to the average for the period\r\n1816-80; - indicates that the harvest was so many days earlier than\r\nnormal, corresponding to a high summer temperature (May to August).\r\nThe table shows that cold winters were especially numerous in the\r\nfirst half of the twelfth century and again in the thirteenth. The\r\nend of the fifteenth century was marked by hot summers and mild\r\nwinters, or a warmer climate; the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury by cold (presumably snowy) winters and cool summers. Thus the\r\nperiods of increased rainfall in the arid regions of Asia and America\r\nwere marked by a colder climate in the rainy regions of western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n  --------+---------+---------+-------------+-------------\r\n     1.   |    2.   |    3.   |     4.      |    5.\r\n          |         |         |             |\r\n   Period,| Date of |   No.   |Winters with |\r\n  50 years|   Wine  |of Severe|Ice on Danish| Remarks.\r\n   about. | Harvest.| Winters.|   coast.    |\r\n  --------+---------+---------+-------------+-------------\r\n     825  |         |     4   |             |\r\n     875  |         |     7   |             |\r\n     925  |         |     5   |             |\r\n     975  |         |     6   |             |\r\n    1025  |         |     6   |             |\r\n    1075  |         |    10   |             |\r\n    1125  |         |    15   |             | Cold winters\r\n    1175  |         |    10   |             |\r\n    1225  |         |    13   |           } |\r\n    1275  |         |    13   |           } | Cold winters\r\n    1325  |         |    13   |      7    } |\r\n    1375  |         |    11   |      4      |\r\n    1425  |  +5     |    13   |      7      |\r\n    1475  |  +1     |     7   |      2      | Warm\r\n    1525  |  +2.9   |    10   |      5      |\r\n    1575  |  +2.2   |    14   |     14    } |\r\n    1625  |  +4.1   |    17   |     11    } | Cold\r\n    1675  |  +2.7   |    15   |     14    } |\r\n    1725  |  +0.1   |    10   |      5      |\r\n    1775  |  -0.2   |    --   |     22      |\r\n    1825  |  -0.9   |    --   |     21      |\r\n  --------+---------+---------+-------------+-------------\r\n\r\nThe date of the break up of the River Dwina at Mitau was recorded\r\nintermittently from 1530 to 1709, and regularly since that date, and\r\nthe figures have been discussed by Rykatchef.

The case for climatic change has\r\nbeen well set out by O. Pettersson[7]. The Roman authors (Pliny,\r\nSolinus, etc.) wrote that there was a frozen sea about Thule\r\n(Iceland), but a party of monks who visited the island about A.D.\r\n795 during the months of February to August, in which the ice is\r\nnormally most abundant in Icelandic waters, found the coast free,\r\nthough they met with a frozen sea a day’s journey to the northward.\r\nIn the ninth century the Norsemen visited Iceland regularly, and at\r\ntimes sailed round it, apparently without interference from ice.\r\nThe early settlers practised agriculture with some success. In the\r\nthirteenth century, however, the reports of ice off Iceland became\r\nfrequent—apparently the conditions were worse than those of the\r\npresent day, and much more so than in the eighth and ninth centuries.\r\nAccording to Rabot, it appears from ancient records that considerable\r\nareas cultivated in the tenth century are now covered with ice. The\r\nfirst spread of the glaciers took place in the first half of the\r\nfourteenth century. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the\r\nclimate of Iceland ameliorated somewhat, but in the seventeenth there\r\nwas a readvance, which destroyed several farms about 1640 or 1650.\r\nSince then there has been a slight retreat.\r\n\r\nThe ice-conditions of Greenland are closely related to those of\r\nIceland, and the records of the Norse colonization of Greenland bear\r\nout the conclusions drawn from the latter island. Up to the close\r\nof the twelfth century ice is hardly ever mentioned in the accounts\r\nof voyages, though it is now a great hindrance. Eric, the pioneer\r\nexplorer of West Greenland, spent three successive winters on the\r\nislands in Juliaanehaab Bay (latitude 60° 45′ N.), and explored the\r\ncountry during the summer; “this cannot be explained otherwise than\r\nby assuming that the Polar ice did not reach Cape Farewell and the\r\nwest coast of Greenland in those days.” In the thirteenth century ice\r\nis first specifically mentioned as a danger to navigation, and at\r\nthe end of the fourteenth century the old Norse sailing route was on\r\naccount of ice definitely abandoned in favour of one further south.\r\nShortly afterwards the Norse colonies were wiped out by a southward\r\nmigration of the Eskimos. Even in Norway itself the fourteenth\r\ncentury was a time of dearth, short harvests and political troubles,\r\nwhen corn had to be imported from Germany instead of being exported\r\nto Iceland as in former years.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Pettersson’s conclusions are considered\r\ninvalid by H. H. Hildebrandsson[8] on the ground of the\r\nincompleteness of the records.\r\n\r\nFor the southern hemisphere our records are naturally much rarer and\r\nof less antiquity than for the northern hemisphere, and until the\r\ntree-rings are investigated we cannot carry our study back beyond\r\nthe sixteenth century. From some researches into the municipal\r\narchives of Santiago de Chile, latitude 33½° S., published by B. V.\r\nMackenna in 1877, we can infer, however, that the general course of\r\nvariation since 1520 was similar to that of corresponding regions in\r\nNorth America. Santiago lies in a semi-arid region where a temporary\r\nshortage of water is severely felt, the average annual rainfall\r\nbeing only 364 mm. (14.3 inches). The early travellers, however,\r\nmake no specific mention of drought, and in 1540 Pedro de Valdivia\r\ncrossed the desert of Atacama with a column of troops and cattle\r\nwithout inconvenience—a feat which would be difficult nowadays. In\r\n1544 there were heavy rains and great floods in June. The next record\r\nis for the year 1609, recording another heavy flood on the Mapocho,\r\nwhich was repeated nine years later in 1618. The first recorded\r\ndrought occurred in the years 1637 to 1640; there was another flood\r\nin 1647, after which came a series of severe droughts interrupted by\r\noccasional floods, which lasted until the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The first half of the nineteenth century was again\r\ncomparatively rainy. The records thus indicate a wet period centred\r\nabout 1600, followed by a dry period during the eighteenth century,\r\nexactly parallel to the records from the United States and Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Huntington, E. “The climatic factor as illustrated in arid\r\n  America.” Washington, Carnegie Institution, 1914.\r\n\r\n  ——. “The fluctuating climate of North America.” _Geogr.

For this early period we are reduced to speculation, in\r\nwhich we may reasonably utilize the facts which we have gained about\r\nclimatic variation.\r\n\r\nThe chief problem to be explained is why man’s arboreal ancestor\r\nleft the safe shelter and easy food supply of his primæval forest\r\nand ventured forth into the plains. An article by Professor J.\r\nBarrell,[10] of Yale University, gives a plausible account of the\r\nchange, putting it down to necessity, and not to choice. His theory\r\nis that the human ancestor lived in the forests spread over Asia,\r\nthen a vast well-watered plain, during the middle-Tertiary period.\r\nThen the gradual uplifting of the Himalayas and other mountain\r\nranges caused a decrease in the rainfall of central Asia, so that\r\nultimately the forests were unable to thrive, and gradually gave\r\nplace to steppe conditions. The change was slow enough to give the\r\nless specialized inhabitants of the forest time to change their\r\nhabits and evolve into forms suitable to a terrestrial life, and the\r\nchief of the animals which took advantage of this period of grace\r\nwas the pre-human. Forced to live on the ground, with a diminishing\r\nfood supply, only the most progressive individuals were able to\r\nsurvive, and evolution was rapid. The changing type was saved from\r\nbeing submerged in the great mass of the original type in the forests\r\nwhich continued to exist further south by the impassable wall of\r\nmountains. Major Cherry[11] considers that there is sufficient\r\nevidence to prove that a portion of this evolution took place on the\r\nseashore, an environment which would have been much more favourable\r\nto a small ape-like animal than the open steppe would have been. It\r\nis quite likely that the earliest migrations, such as that which\r\ncarried _Pithecanthropus_ to Java, took place along the shore. But\r\nafter a time, when increasing brainpower and the use of primitive\r\nstone implements enabled man to take the offensive against the\r\nlarger animals, the centre of activity changed to the steppes. A\r\nfamiliar view of the early development of man was advocated by W.\r\nD. Mathew,[12] who writes: “In view of the data obtainable from\r\nhistorical record, from tradition, from the present geographical\r\ndistribution of higher and lower races of men, from the physical\r\nand physiological adaptation of all and especially of the higher\r\nraces, it seems fair to conclude that the centre of dispersal of\r\nmankind in prehistoric times was central Asia, north of the great\r\nHimalayan ranges, and that when by progressive aridity that region\r\nbecame desert it was transferred to the regions bordering it to the\r\neast, south and west. We may further assume that the environment in\r\nwhich man primarily evolved was not a moist tropical climate, but\r\na temperate and more or less arid one, progressively cold and dry\r\nduring the course of his evolution. In this region and under these\r\nconditions, the race first attained a dominance which enabled it to\r\nspread out in successive waves of migration to the most remote parts\r\nof the earth.”\r\n\r\nWe do not know anything of the migrations of the Eolithic and\r\nearlier Palæolithic races, except that they spread rapidly\r\nover a considerable portion of the earth. Both migration and\r\nevolution, especially mental evolution, must have been accelerated\r\nby the great changes of climate which were taking place. In\r\nthe Mindel-Riss interglacial period we know of two types, the\r\nPiltdown man (_Eoanthropus dawsoni_) and the Heidelberg man (_Homo\r\nheidelbergensis_), the latter a true man, though probably not on\r\nthe direct line of evolution of _Homo sapiens_. The stress of the\r\nsucceeding second Glacial period was too great for _Eoanthropus_,\r\nwhich appears to have died out, but _Homo_, probably an Asiatic or\r\nAfrican type similar to _H. Heidelbergensis_, survived. The next\r\nform, associated with Mousterian implements, is Neanderthal man (_H.\r\nneanderthalensis_), who closely resembled modern man, and all the\r\nremains of races which lived subsequently to the last glaciation\r\nare those of modern man (_H. sapiens_), including the magnificent\r\nCro-Magnards and the negroid Grimaldi race. Thus each glaciation\r\nhas been marked by a step upwards in the scale of humanity; does\r\nthis mean that the coming of the super-man is contingent on another\r\nglacial epoch?\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Barrell, J. “Probable relations of climatic change to the origin of\r\n  the Tertiary Ape-man.” _Scientific Monthly_, New York, 4, 1917, p.\r\n  16.\r\n\r\n  Mathew, W.

Many accidental factors—position on\r\ntrade-routes, possession of special mineral advantages, and so on,\r\nhave undoubtedly played a part in this, but it will not be difficult\r\nto show that climatic fluctuations have also had their share.\r\n\r\nA brilliant study of Ellsworth Huntington[13] has shown that there\r\nare certain optimum conditions of climate which are most suitable\r\nfor efficient work. These conditions, which were determined by an\r\nanalysis of the output of work in American factories, were then\r\nfound to be just those which prevail in the most progressive regions\r\nof the globe, which are located in the temperate storm-belts, and\r\nit is shown in certain instances that fluctuations in the position\r\nof this storm-belt coincided with fluctuations in the centres of\r\ncivilization. A few additional examples of this may be given.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of civilization may reasonably be placed with the\r\ntransition from the Palæolithic to the Neolithic type, a transition\r\nwhich involved much more than just the polishing of stone weapons.\r\nIt involved also the beginnings of agriculture, crude pottery, and\r\nlater, the domestication of animals. One of the earliest Neolithic\r\ncities known is probably that of Anau, near Askabad in Transcaspia,\r\nexcavated by Pumpelly in 1904. From the thickness of the accumulated\r\ndebris the date of first settlement is placed at or before 8000\r\nB.C., i.e. 10,000 years ago, or during the period which in Europe is\r\nassigned to the concluding stages of the Wurm glaciation. Pumpelly’s\r\ntime-estimates are based on careful comparison with accumulations\r\nin Merv and other cities. At present the mean annual rainfall in\r\nthat part of Turkestan is below ten inches a year, and the country\r\nis practically desert, and is entirely unfitted for agriculture.\r\nBut with the remains of the ice-sheet still over Scandinavia and\r\ndepressions following a more southerly course along the Mediterranean\r\nbasin and into southern Asia, the rainfall was considerably heavier,\r\nand the climate in general was more suited to a progressive race.\r\nAt the outset we find this Neolithic race living in rectangular\r\nhouses built of uniform sun-dried bricks; they were skilful potters,\r\ncultivating cereals, but at first without domestic animals.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of Neolithic civilization in Crete is placed by Evans\r\nat about 12000 B.C., while on the basis of excavations by de Morgan\r\nat Susa in Persia, Montelius places the origin of Neolithic culture\r\nin this part of Asia as early as about 18000 B.C. At Susa the\r\ndeposits are 130 feet thick, and of these the upper 40 feet cover a\r\nperiod of 6000 years.\r\n\r\nThus we see that what may be considered as the great step from\r\nsavagery to civilization took place while the present centres of\r\nprogress in Europe and America were still in the Ice Age. At this\r\ntime the climate of southern Asia must have resembled the present\r\nclimate of north-west Europe in heavier rainfall and the day-to-day\r\nfluctuations of weather—in fact, the districts where civilization\r\nbegan probably had at that time the most stimulating climate in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nWith the vanishing of the ice-sheets and the setting in of the mild\r\nclimate of the Maritime phase the Neolithic culture spread rapidly to\r\nEurope, and by 2000 B.C. even the Baltic regions were well inhabited,\r\nand it is probable that the Aryan race was developing in the Russian\r\nsteppes. About this time Anau was abandoned owing to increasing\r\naridity.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the Bronze Age in western Europe, about 1800\r\nB.C., however, the climate again became colder and rainier,\r\ncorresponding to the Peat-bog phase or “Classical” rainfall maximum,\r\nthe deterioration culminating in the Early Iron Age. This period\r\nwas marked by a great southward spread of the Aryan peoples, and\r\nushered in the Heroic Age of Greece. The races of the Mediterranean,\r\nas we have seen, continued to thrive throughout this rainy period,\r\nand their power did not diminish until its close, about A.D. 400.\r\nThis downfall was accelerated if not caused by the pressure of nomad\r\npeoples driven out of Asia by the increasing drought. These Asiatic\r\nmigrations included the great marches of the Tartar hordes and, aided\r\nby religious enthusiasm, the conquests of the Moslems.\r\n\r\nThe early Middle Ages, after the downfall of Rome, appear to have\r\nbeen characterized by a dry warm climate. This was the age of the\r\nVikings, when the Norse races rose to dominance in western Europe,\r\nfinally invading and occupying large areas of France and Britain,\r\nand even extending their power to Sicily. With the increasing cold\r\nand wet of the “Mediæval” rainfall maximum came a final burst\r\nof Norse migration, which left the homeland poor and scantily\r\npopulated, and the centre of activity and progress lay once again\r\nwith the Mediterranean peoples, and especially with Italy and Spain.\r\nThe Tartar invasions ceased, and against the increasing power of\r\nEurope the Moslem wave broke and receded. At the close of this\r\nrainy period political dominance again moved north. From that time\r\nthe fluctuations of climate have been of minor importance, and\r\ncorrespondingly there have been no great shiftings of political\r\npower from latitude to latitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n  Tyler, J.

(_a_) is\r\nexpressed as a percentage of the area of the whole circle; (_b_) and\r\n(_c_) as percentages of the area of a semicircle.\r\n\r\nThe term “ice” includes ice-sheets such as that of Greenland or\r\nAntarctica, and also frozen sea or sea closely covered by pack-ice;\r\nthe latter figure may vary in different months.\r\n\r\nThe temperature in January or July is then calculated from the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\nTemperature = basal temperature + ice coeff. x per cent. of ice +\r\nland west coeff. x per cent. of land to west + land east coeff. x per\r\ncent. of land to east.\r\n\r\nThe basal temperatures and the appropriate coefficients are given in\r\nthe following table.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the effect of a given slight change of land and sea\r\ndistribution, it is not necessary to employ the basal temperature.\r\nInstead the equation can be treated as a differential, and the change\r\nof temperature due to the change of land and ice calculated from the\r\nfigures in columns 3 to 5. The figures are given in degrees absolute,\r\n273°0 = 32° F.

In such a case a\r\nsmaller unit such as a circle of five degrees radius can be employed.\r\nAs a rough approximation it may be said that the effect of the\r\nconversion of a square mile of land into sea, or _vice versa_, on\r\nthe temperature of a neighbouring point is inversely proportional to\r\nits distance. Since the area of a five-degree circle is one-quarter\r\nthat of a ten-degree circle, while the average distance of the\r\nland composing it is one-half, we have to divide our regression\r\ncoefficients by two in order to fit the new data.\r\n\r\nThis method was applied to obtain the probable temperature\r\ndistribution on the shores of the _Littorina_ Sea at its maximum\r\nextension, and gave results which agreed remarkably well with those\r\ncalculated by geologists from the animal and plant life of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee London _Q.

ice-sheets, the latter renders it too\r\nprolate, and there will be a tendency for readjustment by the\r\ntransference of mass towards the equator.\r\n\r\n[3] This has been the subject of much
