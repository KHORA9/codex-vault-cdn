It has built up peoples, and has\r\nriven them apart. It has brought to the world vast and permanent wealth.\r\nIt has enlisted the vision of statesmen, the genius of inventors, the\r\ncourage of pioneers, the forcefulness of manufacturers, the initiative of\r\nmerchants and shipbuilders, and the patient toil of many millions.\r\n\r\nA whole library could be written on the economic aspects of cotton alone.\r\nIt could be told in detail, how and why the domination of the field of\r\nits manufacture passed from India to Spain, to Holland, and finally to\r\nEngland, which now shares it chiefly with the United States. The\r\ninterdependence of nations which it has brought about has been the\r\nsubject of numerous books and articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenius that Served\r\nThe World's Need\r\n\r\nNor is the history of the inventions which have made possible to-day's\r\ngreat production of cotton fabrics less impressive. From the unnamed\r\nHindu genius of pre-Alexandrian days, through Arkwright and Eli Whitney,\r\ndown to Jacquard and Northrop, the tale of cotton manufacture is a series\r\nof romances and tragedies, any one of which would be a story worth\r\ntelling in detail. Yet, here is a work that is by no means finished.\r\nGreat inventors who will apply their genius to the improvement of cotton\r\ngrowing and manufacture are still to be born.\r\n\r\nThe present purpose, however, is to explain, as briefly as may be, the\r\ngrowth of the cotton industry of the United States, in its more important\r\nbranches, and to endeavor, on the basis of recognized authority, to\r\nindicate its position in relation to the cotton industries of the\r\nremainder of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerica the Chief\r\nSource of Raw Material\r\n\r\nFor the present, and for the future, as far as that may be seen, the\r\nUnited States will have to continue to supply the greater part of the\r\nworld's raw cotton. Staples of unusual length and strength have been\r\ngrown in some foreign regions, and short and inferior fibers have come\r\nfrom still others. But the cotton belt of the Southern States, producing\r\nmillions of bales, is the chief source of supply for all the world.\r\n\r\nThe following table, taken from \"The World's Cotton Crops, 1915,\" by J.\r\nA. Todd, gives the comparative production of the great cotton-growing\r\nareas, for the 1914-1915 season:\r\n\r\n    America     16,500,000 bales of 500 pounds\r\n    India        5,000,000   \"    \" 500   \"\r\n    Egypt        1,300,000   \"    \" 500   \"\r\n    Russia       1,300,000   \"    \" 500   \"\r\n    China        4,000,000   \"    \" 500   \"\r\n    Others       1,300,000   \"    \" 500   \"\r\n               -----------\r\n    Total       29,400,000   \"    \" 500   \"\r\n\r\nThe American crop is thus approximately fifty-six per cent. of the\r\nworld's total. The other producing countries have shown since the\r\nbeginning of the century an interesting, if not a remarkable growth, that\r\nof China being the largest in quantity, and that of Russia, the largest\r\nin proportion. The American increase has been larger, absolutely, than\r\nthat of any other region, and there is little indication that it will not\r\ncontinue to hold first position.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish Spinners\r\nDominate World Market\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of cotton, Great Britain's supremacy, while not so\r\ngreat proportionately as that of America in growing it, is for the\r\npresent not likely to be challenged. The following table of the number of\r\nspindles in the chief manufacturing countries is based on English figures\r\ncompiled shortly before the outbreak of the World War. The number of\r\nspindles is the usual basis upon which the size of the industry is\r\njudged. It is not a perfect method, but it has fewer objections than any\r\nother:\r\n\r\n    Great Britain        55,576,108\r\n    United States        30,579,000\r\n    Germany              10,920,426\r\n    Russia                8,950,000\r\n    France                7,400,000\r\n    India                 6,400,000\r\n    Austria               4,864,453\r\n    Italy                 4,580,000\r\n    Latin America         3,100,000\r\n    Japan                 2,250,000\r\n    Spain                 2,200,000\r\n    Belgium               1,468,838\r\n    Switzerland           1,398,062\r\n    Scattering            2,499,421\r\n                        -----------\r\n    Total Spindles      142,186,308\r\n\r\nSuch figures can be only approximate. The war has brought growth in the\r\nUnited States and in Japan, but has certainly reduced the numbers of\r\nspindles in Germany, Austria, and Russia. It is doubtful, moreover, how\r\nwell the French industry has been able to maintain itself. But the\r\ntabulation is accurate enough to show the relative standing of the\r\nvarious countries. There are, as has been indicated, other standards than\r\nthe number of spindles. The United States, through the fact that it\r\nspecializes, generally speaking, on the coarser fabrics, uses about\r\n5,000,000 bales of cotton annually, as compared with Great Britain's\r\n4,000,000. The British product, however, sells for much more. Thus the\r\nvalue of the spindle standard is affirmed. England, then, produces well\r\nin excess of one-third of the cotton cloth of the world; the United\r\nStates considerably more than one-fifth of it, with the other countries\r\ntrailing far behind, but prospering nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Individuality\r\nof the Cotton Fiber\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The cotton fiber--a highly magnified view, showing the\r\ntwist_]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious ruling of fate which makes the spinning of cotton fiber\r\npossible. There are many other short vegetable fibers, but cotton is the\r\nonly one which can profitably be spun into thread. Hemp and flax, its\r\nchief vegetable competitors, are both long fibered. The individuality of\r\nthe cotton fiber lies in its shape. Viewed through the microscope, the\r\nfiber is seen to be, not a hollow cylinder, but rather a flattened\r\ncylinder, shaped in cross-section something like the figure eight. But\r\nthe chief and valuable characteristic is that the flattened cylinder is\r\nnot straight, but twisted. It is this twist which gives its peculiar and\r\noverwhelming importance to cotton, for without this apparently fortuitous\r\ncharacteristic, the spinning of cotton, if possible at all, would result\r\nin a much weaker and less durable thread. The twist makes the threads\r\n\"kink\" together when they are spun, and it is this kink which makes for\r\nstrength and durability.\r\n\r\nThough the cotton plant seems to be native to South America, Southern\r\nAsia, Africa, and the West Indies, its cultivation, was largely confined\r\nat first to India, and later to India and the British West Indies. At the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century, the West Indies, because of their\r\nespecial fitness for growing the longer staples were supplying about\r\nseventy per cent. of the food of the Lancashire spindles. The United\r\nStates having made unsuccessful attempts to produce cotton in the early\r\ndays of the colonies, first became an important producing country toward\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century. American Upland cotton, by reason of\r\nits comparatively short staple, and the unevenness of the fibers, as well\r\nas the difficulty of detaching it from the seed, was decidedly inferior\r\nto some other accessible species. The Southern planters who grew it,\r\nmoreover, found it next to impossible to gin it properly, the primitive\r\nroller gin of the time being unsuited to the task, and the work of\r\npulling off the fibers by hand being both tedious and expensive. In 1792,\r\nthe amount exported from the United States was equivalent to only 275\r\nbales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Eli Whitney, the schoolmaster inventor of the cotton\r\ngin_]\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1793, is the most important in the history of cotton\r\ngrowing in the United States. In the autumn of 1792, Eli Whitney, a young\r\nMassachusetts man who had just been graduated from Yale College, sailed\r\nfrom New York to South Carolina where he intended to teach school. On\r\nshipboard he met the widow of Nathaniel Greene, the Revolutionary\r\ngeneral. Mrs. Greene invited the youth to begin his residence in the\r\nSouth on her plantation at Mulberry Grove, Georgia. Here one evening,\r\nsome officers, late of General Greene's command, were discussing the\r\ngreat wealth which might come to the South were there a suitable machine\r\nfor removing stubborn Upland fiber from its green seed. The story goes\r\nthat while the discussion was at its height, Mrs. Greene said:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, apply to my young friend, Mr. Whitney. He can make\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nWhitney commenced work on the problem. A room was set aside as his\r\nworkshop, and it was not long before he had produced the beginnings of\r\nthe gin. He fixed wire teeth in a board, and found that by pulling the\r\nfibers through with his fingers he could leave the tenacious seed behind.\r\nHe carried this basic idea further by putting the teeth on a cylinder and\r\nby providing a rotating brush to clean the fiber from the teeth.\r\n\r\nThe changes which followed immediately upon the introduction of the\r\ncotton gin were tremendous in scope and almost innumerable. There was a\r\ntime, before cotton became a staple, when the South led New England in\r\nmanufacturing. That time passed almost immediately. Iron works and coal\r\nmines were abandoned, and men turned their energies from the culture of\r\ncorn, rice, and indigo largely to the raising of the cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpansion in\r\nProduction\r\n\r\nThe following figures, giving production in the equivalent of 500 pound\r\nbales for the year at the close of each ten-year period, give some idea\r\nof the tremendous expansion which ensued.\r\n\r\n                            _500 Pound\r\n    _Year_                     Bales_\r\n    1790                          3,138\r\n    1800                         73,222\r\n    1810                        177,824\r\n    1820                        334,728\r\n    1830                        732,218\r\n    1840                      1,347,640\r\n    1850                      2,136,083\r\n    1860                      3,841,416\r\n    1870                      4,024,527\r\n    1880                      6,356,998\r\n    1890                      8,562,089\r\n    1900                     10,123,027\r\n    1910                     11,608,616\r\n    1917                     11,302,375\r\n\r\nBy this table it will be seen that the Civil War and the freeing of the\r\nslaves held up production only temporarily. In 1914, the banner year, the\r\ncrop reached the tremendous total of 16,134,930 bales of five hundred\r\npounds each.\r\n\r\nSome little spinning had been done in the seventeenth century, but in\r\n1787-88 the first permanent factory, built of brick, and located in\r\nBeverly, Massachusetts, on the Bass river, was put into operation by a\r\ngroup headed by John Cabot and Joshua Fisher. This factory failed to\r\njustify itself economically, chiefly because of the crudeness of its\r\nmachinery. But Samuel Slater, newly come from England with models of the\r\nArkwright machinery in his brain, set up a factory in Pawtucket in 1790.\r\nFrom that time forth the growth was steady and sure, if not always\r\nextremely rapid.\r\n\r\nThe following table,[A] which covers the whole country, relates\r\nparticularly to New England in the years before 1880, because the cotton\r\nmanufacturing industry until then was largely concentrated there. It\r\nshows how the manufacturing interests of the country profited by the\r\ndiscovery that brought wealth to the agricultural South:\r\n\r\n    =======+=======+============+=========+=============+==============\r\n           |_Number|            |_Cotton  |             |\r\n           |  of   |  _Number   |  Used   |  _Number    |  _Value of\r\n    _Year_ | Estab-|    of      |   in    |     of      |  Product in\r\n           | lish- | Spindles_  | Million |  Employes_  |   Dollars_\r\n           | ments_|            | Pounds_ |             |\r\n    -------+-------+------------+---------+-------------+--------------\r\n      1810 |       |     87,000 |         |             |\r\n      1820 |       |    220,000 |         |             |\r\n      1830 |   795 |  1,200,000 |    77.8 |     62,177  |   $32,000,000\r\n      1840 |  1240 |  2,300,000 |   113.1 |     72,119  |    46,400,000\r\n      1850 |  1094 |  3,600,000 |   276.1 |     92,286  |    61,700,000\r\n      1860 |  1091 |  5,200,000 |   422.7 |    122,028  |   115,700,000\r\n      1870 |   956 |  7,100,000 |   398.3 |    135,369  |   177,500,000\r\n      1880 |   756 | 10,700,000 |   750.3 |    174,659  |   192,100,000\r\n      1890 |   905 | 14,200,000 | 1,118.0 |    218,876  |   268,000,000\r\n      1900 |   973 | 19,000,000 | 1,814.0 |    297,929  |   332,800,000\r\n      1910 |  1208 | 27,400,000 | 2,332.2 |    371,120  |   616,500,000\r\n      1918 |       | 34,940,830 | 3,278.2 |             |\r\n    =======+=======+============+=========+=============+==============\r\n\r\n  [A]  This tabulation includes spinning and weaving\r\n       establishments only.\r\n\r\nThe North, having this growing interest in an industry struggling against\r\nthe experience and ability of the more firmly established English market,\r\nsought naturally for the protection given by a high tariff. The South,\r\nhaving definitely dropped manufacturing, pleaded with Congress always for\r\na low tariff, and the right to deal in human chattels.\r\n\r\nThere is little need to go further into the rift which began to develop\r\nalmost immediately. In 1861 the split occurred. The war between the\r\nStates caused hardly more suffering than the blockade which cut off the\r\nspinners of Manchester from the vegetable wool which supplied them the\r\nmeans of living. Cotton proved its power and its domination. It was a\r\nbeneficent monarch, but it brooked no denial of its overlordship.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Exports\r\nto England Heavy\r\n\r\nThe invention of the Whitney Gin, as we have just said, found the United\r\nStates able to use but a small part of the cotton grown. What became of\r\nthe remainder? Obviously, it was exported to provide the means for\r\noperating the English mills. Here is a table which shows how American\r\ncotton left the Southern ports for England and the Continent in the\r\nalternate decennial years beginning in 1790, three years before the\r\ninvention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney. The figures are exclusive of\r\nlinters.\r\n\r\n                                 _Exports in\r\n                               Equivalent of 500\r\n    _Year_                        Pound Bales_\r\n\r\n    1790                             379\r\n    1810                         124,116\r\n    1830                         553,960\r\n    1850                       1,854,474\r\n    1870                       2,922,757\r\n    1890                       5,850,219\r\n    1910                       8,025,991\r\n    1917                       4,587,000\r\n\r\nIn 1910 American cotton made up almost exactly three-quarters of the\r\nwhole amount imported into Great Britain. The other countries of Europe\r\nhave developed a spinning industry by no means inconsiderable. American\r\ncotton is sent to almost all those European countries which spin and\r\nweave.\r\n\r\nSuch a movement had of course a profound effect upon the currents of\r\nworld trade. The cotton crop is the second in value of all the crops\r\nproduced in the United States, and such a large part of it is exported\r\nthat the credit it gives to its sellers enables them to buy in return\r\nsome of the most valuable of the products manufactured in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the amount of cotton, expressed in the\r\nequivalent of 500 pound bales, exported to the various countries named in\r\nthe decennial years:\r\n\r\n    ======+=========+=========+========+=======+========+========+=========\r\n          |_United  |         |        |       |        |_Nether-|\r\n    _Year_| Kingdom_|_Germany_|_France_|_Italy_|_Russia_| lands_ |_Belgium_\r\n    ------+---------+---------+--------+-------+--------+--------+---------\r\n    1821  |  175,438|    1,496|  54,878|  1,796|    609 |   8,372|\r\n    1830  |  419,661|    2,246| 150,212|    471|    223 |  17,135|\r\n    1840  |  989,830|   18,317| 358,180|  7,805|  4,406 |  21,698|   25,780\r\n    1850  |  863,062|   10,090| 251,668| 18,707|  8,677 |   8,590|   25,492\r\n    1860  |2,528,274|  132,145| 567,935| 54,037| 43,396 |  25,515|   29,601\r\n    1870  |1,298,332|  173,552| 306,293| 14,549| 30,341 |  17,050|    3,452\r\n    1880  |2,433,255|  308,045| 359,693| 59,126|204,500 |  65,325|   17,896\r\n    1890  |2,905,152|  837,641| 484,759|129,751|193,163 |  17,438|   93,588\r\n    1900  |2,302,128|1,619,173| 736,092|443,951| 54,950 |  74,635|  148,319\r\n    1910  |2,444,558|1,887,657| 968,422|393,327| 67,203 |  18,823|  102,346\r\n    1917  |2,387,101|         | 658,553|369,213| 15,945 |  10,098|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWhere Cotton is Grown and Spun and Why\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen (page 5) that the world's cotton crop is produced chiefly by\r\nthe United States, with 56%; India, with 17%; China, with 13-1/2%; Egypt\r\nand Russia with 4-1/2%, the remaining 4-1/2% being made up by Brazil,\r\nMexico, Peru, Turkey, Persia, Japan, and several other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimitive Methods of\r\nGrowing in India\r\n\r\nIndia is the first country wherein, so far as we have record, the growing\r\nof cotton reached the stage of an industry. There conditions are almost\r\nideal, apparently, for the production of a great crop; yet, for many\r\nyears the crop was a small one, and was utilized locally in the domestic\r\nmanufacture of the light clothing worn by the people. Nothing remotely\r\nresembling the present modern factory system developed during all the\r\nthousands of years that the Indians had the field practically to\r\nthemselves. The plant grown in India for a long time produced a short,\r\nuncertain staple, difficult to gin and still more difficult to spin. The\r\ngreater part of the cotton growing districts are still given over to the\r\nshort staple varieties (about 3/4 inch) but in recent years certain\r\nvarieties of Egyptian and American cotton have been produced with some\r\nsuccess. About 20,000,000 acres are given over to the culture of the\r\nplant, but the methods used are to a great extent primitive in the\r\nextreme. Most of the crop, being unsuited to the needs of the British\r\nspinners, is either manufactured in Indian mills, of which the number is\r\nconstantly growing, or exported to Japan. Before the war, Germany was a\r\nlarge consumer of Indian cotton.\r\n\r\nThe figures given as representing the Chinese crop probably are not any\r\nmore accurate than the usual statistical figures concerning China. The\r\nChinese are still largely in the domestic system of manufacture, and much\r\nof their crop--probably a larger proportion than in India--is spun and\r\nwoven in the neighborhood where it is grown, without ever appearing in\r\nstatistical tables. The methods of growing are equally primitive. The\r\nfiber is short, and the mills of the country import more raw cotton,\r\nyarn, and textiles than they export.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Growing Importance\r\nOf Egyptian Staples\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian crop is one of the most interesting, both in the methods\r\nof culture, and in the product. From the point of view of\r\nstatistics--remembering the uncertainty of the size of the Chinese\r\ncrop--Egypt is the third cotton growing country of the world. This is\r\nthe more interesting because it was not until about 1820 that Egypt was\r\nconsidered as a source of supply. The present area, under extremely\r\nintensive cultivation, is about 1,800,000 acres, and nine-tenths of this\r\nis in the Nile delta.\r\n\r\nClimatic conditions are radically different from those of the United\r\nStates. Little rain falls during the growing season, but an elaborate\r\nsystem of irrigation provides a sufficient and probably more satisfactory\r\nwater supply, insomuch as the quantity of water can be regulated, and\r\nthere is little danger of either too much or too little moisture. The\r\nregions where the soil is not composed exclusively of the black delta\r\nmud, but is a mixture of sand and mud, produce the best crops. The land,\r\nafter being plowed, is thrown up into ridges about three feet apart.\r\nChannels for water are formed at right angles to the ridges. The seeds,\r\nbefore being sown, in March, are thoroughly soaked, and after the\r\nseedlings appear there is frequent hoeing and watering. The total water\r\nis equivalent to a rainfall of about 35 inches. There is little\r\ncultivation in the American fashion, hand labor being employed almost\r\nexclusively. The result of all this intensive effort is an abundant crop\r\nof long-stapled cotton with an extremely strong fiber, bringing in the\r\nopen market a price second only to that of the American Sea Island\r\nvariety. Much of the Egyptian cotton is used in the manufacture of\r\nhosiery and other knit goods, sateens, sewing thread, etc., but recently\r\nit has also been found to be exceedingly well fitted for the manufacture\r\nof the fabric used in pneumatic tires, and for the duck or filter cloth\r\nused in such industries as the refining of sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pickers in Delta Field_]\r\n\r\nRussian cotton, so-called, is really grown largely in Turkestan though a\r\nsmall amount is produced in the Southern Caucasus. The culture has been\r\nunder way since very early times, but had little more than local\r\nsignificance until about 1875 when the Russian Government took steps to\r\nfoster it, distributing American seed of the Upland variety, importing\r\nthe necessary equipment, and providing instructors, frequently Americans.\r\nRailroads to handle the crop were built, and, with all this favorable\r\nassistance, progress was rapid. About one-third of the cotton used in the\r\nRussian mills up to the time of the war was grown on Russian soil, the\r\nremainder being brought largely from the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Crop\r\nAs the World's Basis\r\n\r\nBut the bulk of the world's supply is the cotton grown in the United\r\nStates. The price for American Upland Cotton governs the price of the\r\nother varieties. The acreage devoted to the cultivation of the cotton\r\ncrop in the United States is approximately 34,000,000. The increase since\r\n1839, when census figures covering this point were first obtained, has\r\nbeen about seventeen fold. The 1916 acreage, of the various States,\r\ntogether with figures giving the value of the crop and the comparative\r\nrank, is here given:\r\n\r\n    ================+==========+==============+========+===============\r\n                    |          |   _Gross     |        | _Crop Value\r\n                    |          |Equivalent 500|_Approx-|   Including\r\n     _States_       | _Acreage_|  Pound Bales | imate  |     Seed\r\n                    |          | Exclusive of |Percent-|  and Linters_\r\n                    |          |   Linters_   | age_   |\r\n    ----------------+----------+--------------+--------+---------------\r\n    Alabama         | 1,977,000|      517,890 |    4.6 |   $86,940,000\r\n    Arizona         |          |       21,737 |    0.1 |     6,300,000\r\n    Arkansas        | 2,740,000|      973,752 |    8.6 |   164,840,000\r\n    California      |          |       57,826 |    0.5 |     9,410,000\r\n    Florida         |   183,000|       37,858 |    0.3 |    10,260,000\r\n    Georgia         | 5,195,000|    1,883,911 |   16.7 |   322,600,000\r\n    Louisiana       | 1,454,000|      638,729 |    5.7 |   102,260,000\r\n    Mississippi     | 2,788,000|      905,554 |    8.0 |   152,270,000\r\n    Missouri        |   345,000|       60,831 |    0.5 |    10,100,000\r\n    North Carolina  | 1,515,000|      617,989 |    5.5 |   103,940,000\r\n    Oklahoma        | 2,783,000|      959,081 |    8.5 |   150,270,000\r\n    South Carolina  | 2,837,000|    1,236,871 |   10.9 |   207,220,000\r\n    Tennessee       |   882,000|      240,525 |    2.1 |    40,130,000\r\n    Texas           |11,092,000|    3,125,378 |   27.7 |   495,590,000\r\n    Virginia        |    50,000|       18,777 |    0.2 |     3,140,000\r\n    All Other States|          |        5,666 |    0.1 |       970,000\r\n                    +----------+--------------+--------+--------------\r\n      Totals        |33,841,000|   11,302,375 | 100.00 | 1,866,240,000\r\n    ================+==========+==============+========+==============\r\n\r\nThere are generally speaking, two kinds of cotton produced in the United\r\nStates--Upland cotton, and Sea Island cotton. The former makes up the\r\ngreat bulk of the crop, the relative percentages in 1917 being 99.2 and\r\n.8.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constant Search\r\nFor Long Staples\r\n\r\nA few years ago the terms short-staple and Upland were practically\r\ninterchangeable, but the great demand for long staple, chiefly from the\r\nmanufacturers of thread and of pneumatic tire fabrics has led to a\r\nsuccessful attempt to grow the longer fibers in the Upland districts, so\r\nthat now more than a million bales annually are being produced in the\r\nUpland districts of cotton with a staple length of 1-1/8 inches and more.\r\nThe world's total production of long staple is in the neighborhood of\r\n2,250,000 bales. Egypt is the chief producer outside the United States,\r\nher product being approximately 1,000,000 bales of 500 pounds every year.\r\nAlthough the product is small, the best Sea Island produced in the United\r\nStates grows upon the small islands off the coast of South Carolina. The\r\nlong-staple Upland is grown chiefly in the Mississippi delta, where the\r\nproduct is called \"Peeler,\" \"benders,\" etc., though the percentage of\r\nlong-staple produced elsewhere is steadily increasing. The success of\r\ncertain Arizona growers in producing long-staple from Egyptian seed is\r\nbeing watched with great interest. More than 3,000 bales came from this\r\nsource in 1916, the fiber averaging 1-1/2 inches in length. There has\r\nrecently been developed there, the new and important Pima variety, which\r\nis superior to the native Egyptian cotton, being both longer and whiter,\r\nand the growers are now planting Pima almost exclusively.\r\n\r\nThe following table, taken from the Encyclopedia Brittanica, gives the\r\ncomparative length of staple of the more important varieties of cotton.\r\nThe order in which they are given represents, roughly, their relative\r\ncommercial value:\r\n\r\n                                _Length of Staple\r\n    Sea Island Cotton               in Inches_\r\n      Carolina Sea Island              1.8\r\n      Florida Sea Island               1.8\r\n      Georgia Sea Island               1.7\r\n      Barbados Sea Island              2.\r\n\r\n    Egyptian Cottons\r\n      Yannovitch                       1.5\r\n      Abassi                           1.5\r\n      Good Brown Egyptian (Mitafifi)   1.2\r\n\r\n    American Cotton\r\n      Good Middling Memphis            1.3\r\n      Good Middling Texas              1.0\r\n      Good Middling Upland             1.0\r\n\r\n    Indian Cottons\r\n      Fine Tinnevelly                   .8\r\n      Fine Bhaunagar                   1.0\r\n      Fine Amraoti                     1.0\r\n      Fine Broach                       .9\r\n      Fine Bengal                       .9\r\n      Fine ginned Sind                  .8\r\n      Good ginned Kumta                1.0\r\n\r\nThe table of the number of spindles in each country in the world, given\r\non page 6, gives some idea of the relative position of the United States\r\nin the field of cotton manufacturing. We have seen how the English\r\nindustry, having the prior start, grew to imposing proportions and helped\r\nto bring about a change almost as great in its effects as the French\r\nRevolution, which was occurring at almost the same time. British\r\nsupremacy in cotton manufacturing has never been truly challenged, but\r\nthere has been an appreciable growth in several other countries, and in\r\nGermany and Japan, at least, the recent development has been little short\r\nof phenomenal. New figures will probably show that in the future Japan\r\nwill be the chief competitor of England and the United States for a share\r\nof the cotton trade of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fall River, Massachusetts_]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Home Market\r\nCreated An Industry\r\n\r\nThe chief factor in the growth of the American industry was probably not\r\nthe nearness of the source of supply, cheap fuel or labor, nor any of\r\nthese factors which operated in the case of England, such as climate,\r\ngeographical position, and shipping control, but more than anything else\r\nthe presence of a market close at hand which grew so rapidly, more\r\nrapidly indeed than the industry could grow to meet it. Aided to some\r\nextent by an import tariff, the manufacturers have weathered some short\r\nperiods of depression, but in the main the industry has grown in direct\r\nratio to the growth of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A typical Southern mill_]\r\n\r\n\r\nNew England As Home\r\nOf American Spinning\r\n\r\nThe cotton mill, as we have seen, early chose New England as its\r\ndomicile. Mills are scattered more or less throughout the entire region,\r\nbut there are several localities which stand out beyond all others, and\r\nalmost deserve the title they have acquired as the centers of the\r\nindustry. Premier place for a long time was held by Fall River, and even\r\nnow the race between that city and New Bedford is strong, with the lead\r\nslightly in favor of the former city.\r\n\r\nBristol County, Mass., in which these two centers, and Taunton, are\r\nlocated, Providence, R. I., and Middlesex County, Mass., together\r\ncontained 10,086,686 spindles in 1917, or 29.5% of the country's total of\r\n34,221,252.\r\n\r\nThe growth in this one locality is due probably to the advantages which\r\ncome with centralization, as well as to the natural advantages they\r\npossessed. These latter, which include particularly water power and a\r\nmoist climate, are not as important now, With steam power and mechanical\r\nhumidifiers as they were a generation ago.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Atlantic States, the number of plants and the spindlage\r\nhave remained about stationary over a long period of years, and are even\r\nshowing a tendency to decrease. Small weaving establishments which buy\r\ntheir yarn are particularly numerous around Philadelphia, and there are\r\nlarge cotton duck mills in and near Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\nMills in the Midst of\r\nCotton Plantations\r\n\r\nIt has been in the South, however, that the growth of the cotton\r\nmanufacturing industry in the last few decades has been most phenomenal.\r\nIn 1860 there were 324,052 spindles in the cotton growing States compared\r\nwith 8,632,087 in New England. In 1917, the figures were: Northern\r\nStates (including Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\nNew Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and\r\nVermont), 19,835,662 spindles devoted to the spinning of cotton\r\nexclusively; Southern States (including Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,\r\nMaryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,\r\nand Virginia), 14,292,918 spindles devoted to cotton exclusively.\r\n\r\nThe census figures do not give the number of spindles in each city except\r\nwhen the confines of the city and of the county happen to coincide. But\r\nthe appended table is presented as showing the spindlage of counties\r\nhaving more than 100,000 spindles devoted to the spinning of cotton.\r\n\r\nAbout 1880, the Southerner saw the opportunity that awaited him when he\r\nshould manufacture his own cotton. At that time he was consuming only\r\n188,748 bales, while New England took 1,129,498. In ten years, he was\r\nutilizing more than half a million bales, while New England had just\r\npassed the million and a half figure. In 1905, the South consumed\r\n2,140,151 bales, while New England had climbed to only 1,753,282. The\r\nfigures are Scherer's, who points out that the race was won in\r\ntwenty-five years. However, as competition with the South increased, New\r\nEngland, following the earlier lead of Old England, has tended always to\r\nproduce a finer and finer quality of cloth, leaving the coarser grades of\r\nsheeting, drills and ducks to the Southern mills. Thus, while the South\r\nis consuming an ever larger proportion of the cotton crop, she is still\r\nfar from receiving for her product the money that comes to the New\r\nEnglander, who with a higher grade of labor and greater variation of\r\noutput is constantly catering, with dress fabrics and fine stuffs of\r\nvarious kinds, to a discriminating well-to-do patronage.\r\n\r\n                               _Spindles\r\n      _County_                   (Number)_\r\n    Bristol, Mass.              7,294,221\r\n    Providence, R.

Thus we\r\nfind that the great raw cotton markets of the United States are in New\r\nYork and New Orleans. In Europe they are at Liverpool, Bremen and Havre.\r\nBecause of conditions imposed by the German government, the Bremen market\r\nis largely dependent upon New York and Liverpool. The other great world\r\nmarket is that of Alexandria, which, although it handles but a\r\ncomparatively small part of the world's crop, is important on account of\r\nthe quality of the staple which makes up the Egyptian bale.\r\n\r\nThe two chief American markets, New York and New Orleans, are sharply\r\ndifferentiated. The New Orleans market is a true trader's market. The\r\ngreat bulk of the sales made on the New Orleans floor are bona-fide\r\nsales, in which cotton actually changes hands. The New York market on the\r\nother hand is a merchants' and manufacturers' market, in which business\r\ntransactions are protected against loss by the purchase or sale of\r\n\"futures\", though, of course, there is always a large amount of\r\nspeculating. Delivery is rarely demanded. The function of the exchange,\r\ntherefore, is largely that of insurance. The intricacies of this market\r\nwill be discussed later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Raw Cotton Market\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the ramifications of the cotton industry, the cotton itself,\r\non its devious way from planter to consumer, is successively the concern\r\nof a series of individuals and corporations. The immense value of the\r\nproduct, the expense of growing, handling, manufacturing, and selling it\r\nall mean that great quantities of capital are utilized in bringing it at\r\nlast to its final consumer. At any stage of the process, cotton\r\nrepresents no inconsiderable part of the nation's wealth, and to expedite\r\nits journey, merchandising and financial methods of a highly specialized\r\ntechnique have been developed. There are two very clearly marked stages\r\nin this process. The first has to do with the raw cotton, as it goes from\r\nplanter to mill. The second has to do with the journey from mill to\r\nconsumer. The first is usually called the Raw Cotton Market, and the\r\nsecond the Cloth Market.\r\n\r\nThe planter begins his work early in the spring. His crop is dependent\r\nupon his ability to secure and pay for the labor to work it, for the\r\ntools and machinery which are used, and his own expenses. Small planters\r\nare rarely sufficiently in funds to enable them to go through the growing\r\nseason without financial assistance. They must borrow money, and they\r\nusually borrow it with the growing crop as a basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Local Grower\r\nAnd the Charge Account\r\n\r\nThey may borrow from the country merchant in the town near which their\r\nplantations are located. Credit here is usually furnished through the\r\n\"charge account\" system, whereby the merchant supplies the planter's\r\nwants for the growing season, even to the extent of giving credit to his\r\nfarm hands. Tenant farmers live almost entirely on credit furnished by\r\nthe store-keepers of the vicinity. When the picking season begins, in\r\nJuly, August, or September, according to the region concerned, the\r\nmerchant, in lieu of money, may take the cotton as it comes from the\r\ngins, crediting the grower thereof at the market price. The cotton thus\r\naccumulated is sold to local buyers, or, occasionally, to shippers or\r\nexporters. In the case of the larger plantations, or groups of\r\nplantations operated by syndicates or corporations, the cotton is\r\nfrequently shipped direct to the mill or, more often, to a warehouse. The\r\nlarger producers, instead of getting their credit from the local stores,\r\nas their tenant farmers do, are financed either by their banks, or by\r\ntheir buyers, who in turn are financed by their bankers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Street Buyers\r\nOf Texas Towns\r\n\r\nIn some districts, particularly in Texas, there is the small or local\r\nbuyer, usually called a \"street buyer,\" who operates in the smaller\r\ntowns, buying his cotton at the gins in lots of from one to ten bales,\r\neither from the small planters, or from the country merchants. This\r\nbuying gives a certain concentration to the crop, and enables the larger\r\nbuyers to deal in lots of comparatively uniform quality from certain\r\nregions, the general type of whose product is known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Street buyer in a Southern town_]\r\n\r\nCotton bought from the planters or from the country merchants is almost\r\ninvariably paid for in cash.\r\n\r\nCotton is frequently sold at the compress point, rather than at the gin,\r\nthis course being pursued in the case of large producers, or when the\r\noriginal buyer is a mere local operator. One of the most important\r\noperations, commercially as well as industrially, is the grading of\r\ncotton, which takes place as a rule at the compress point under the\r\nsupervision of the buyer, who employs experts for this purpose. Cotton\r\nmills as a rule operate on certain specified grades of cotton, and any\r\ndeviation from this grade means either a readjustment of machinery or\r\ndisgruntled and dissatisfied employes, or, perhaps, an inability to fill\r\nan order for cloth of certain types. The manufacturer will usually refuse\r\nto accept any grades save those he has specifically commissioned the\r\nbuyer to obtain for him. The actual grades, and the terms describing them\r\nhave been established by the United States Government, and are rigidly\r\nadhered to by the trade. Prices are established on the grade known as\r\n\"middling\" as a basis, and variation from this basis is taken up in the\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\r\nStandardization of\r\nAmerican Cotton Grades\r\n\r\nThe grades, for white cotton, as established by usage and confirmed by\r\nGovernmental standardization are:\r\n\r\n    Middling Fair           Strict Low Middling\r\n    Strict Good Middling    Low Middling\r\n    Good Middling           Strict Good Ordinary\r\n    Strict Middling         Good Ordinary\r\n    Middling\r\n\r\nFor yellow tinged stock the grades are:\r\n\r\n    Strict Good Middling    Middling\r\n    Good Middling           Strict Low Middling\r\n    Strict Middling         Low Middling\r\n\r\nFor yellow stained and blue stained there are only three grades quoted,\r\ngood middling, strict middling, and middling, the inference here being\r\nthat stained cotton below the basic grade, is unsuited for most\r\ncommercial purposes.\r\n\r\nWith cotton selling around thirty cents a pound, the difference between\r\nthe cost per pound of middling fair, the highest market grade of white\r\ncotton, and good ordinary, the lowest market grade, may amount to twelve\r\nor thirteen cents. The value of the shipment, and its use as a basis for\r\ncredit, is dependent upon its proper classification.\r\n\r\nThe large cotton buyers purchase for the account of mills, for exporters,\r\nor for clients abroad. They are usually firms of strong financial\r\nstanding, and as we have seen, they are bankers or factors themselves,\r\nfinancing growers or small buyers during the growing of the crop, and the\r\nfirst concentration of the cotton. But when the large movement of cotton\r\nis on, it is frequently necessary that they, like the local banks, must\r\nbe financed in order that they may execute their orders, or, as is\r\nfrequently the case, accept cotton sent to them on consignment. Cotton\r\nsent on consignment must be stored until a market is found for it, and in\r\norder that proper storage facilities may be supplied, the provision of\r\nsuitable warehouse facilities is an important matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarehousing as\r\nIndustry's Great Need\r\n\r\nUntil recently, warehousing in its relations to the textile trade, had\r\nnot been developed to the extent which might have been expected in those\r\nmethods which would make it of the greatest use and advantage to textile\r\ninterests. By means of the facilities which could properly be afforded by\r\nwarehouses, manufacturers, or merchants should be able, at times of\r\nfavorable markets, to lay in large stocks of materials, and to finance\r\nthem safely and easily.\r\n\r\nToday, this need is being met in constantly increasing measure by the\r\nIndependent Warehouses, Inc., affiliated with the Textile Banking Co.,\r\nand having, like the latter, the support of the Guaranty Trust Company of\r\nNew York, and the Liberty National Bank of New York.\r\n\r\nModern warehouses of approved type, with all requisite facilities, will\r\nbe established by this company at various ports of entry throughout the\r\ncountry, as well as at the important concentration points in the cotton\r\nbelt, and also in the great textile manufacturing centers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Weighing cotton on the compress platform_]\r\n\r\nThus it is seen that the cotton merchant has an important economic\r\nfunction to perform. His is the duty of gathering up the great aggregate\r\nof cotton, from all parts of the cotton belt, and distributing it in\r\nexactly the quantity and grade needed to the cotton manufacturers of the\r\nworld. In the performance of this function, and in order that the supply\r\nof cotton may be fed out exactly as it is needed by the manufacturers,\r\nthe cotton merchants have found it convenient, and even necessary to\r\nestablish great common markets where they may meet and enter into the\r\ntransactions with each other and the whole world which are necessary to\r\nbring the cotton into the channels of commerce and keep it moving to its\r\nmultitudinous destinations. These markets are in addition to the numerous\r\nlocal markets where the preliminary concentration takes place, and to\r\nsome extent they are subsidiary to the latter, where the cotton of the\r\nactual quantity and quality they are seeking is to be had in the first\r\ninstance. Yet it is the great markets which establish the prices, for it\r\nis they which are in close and immediate touch with all the other markets\r\nof the world, and it is on their floors that the merchants and brokers\r\nmeet who deal in great quantities. It is their connection with the\r\nnumerous sources of information which gives these great markets their\r\nimportance, for it is they which register immediately and most accurately\r\nthe resultant of the sum total of all the economic forces which\r\ndetermine the price.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The New York Cotton Exchange_]\r\n\r\nThe great cotton markets of the world are those of New York and New\r\nOrleans, in the United States; Liverpool, in England; Bremen, in Germany;\r\nHavre, in France; Alexandria, in Egypt; and Bombay, in India. There are\r\ndifferences between these markets which give a greater importance to some\r\nof them. Bremen, which serves a large territory, operates under\r\ngovernmental restrictions which make it necessary for Bremen merchants to\r\ndeal in other markets as well. Havre serves chiefly the needs of France,\r\nwhich is not one of the large cotton consuming countries. Alexandria\r\ndeals only in Egyptian cottons, and Bombay, whose dealings are confined\r\nmostly to the native staples, has neither the responsiveness nor the\r\ncompleteness of the remaining markets. Thus, by elimination, the three\r\ngreat markets of the world, wherein cotton of all kinds is dealt in, and\r\nall forms of transactions in it are common are those of New York, New\r\nOrleans, and Liverpool. To these, the cotton world looks for guidance\r\nfrom day to day. The prices established on their several floors are the\r\nprices of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cotton train going from gin to compress_]\r\n\r\nThe Liverpool Exchange, under different names, has existed since 1841,\r\nhaving taken approximately its present form in 1870, in the attempts to\r\nstabilize conditions after the great speculative period which resulted\r\nfrom the American Civil War. The New York and New Orleans Exchanges were\r\nboth organized the following year. The uniformity of rules and practices\r\nin the trade which resulted from the establishment of the exchanges have\r\nbeen of inestimable benefit to the industry and to the world, and this\r\ndespite occasional abuses, which have usually been corrected as methods\r\nfor correction have been evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpot Markets and Those\r\nWhich Deal in \"Futures\"\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans Cotton Market, and those of lesser cities, are largely\r\nspot markets, that is, the dealings which takes place in the Exchanges at\r\nthose points involve the actual transferring of cotton which is on hand,\r\nor, at least, contracted for. The New York market deals preponderantly\r\nin what are known as contracts for future delivery, or, in the language\r\nof the Exchange, \"futures.\" The Liverpool Cotton Market is both a great\r\n\"spot\" cotton market, and a great \"futures\" market. The striking thing\r\nabout these \"futures\" contracts is that but few of them are fulfilled by\r\nactual delivery.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises, what function is fulfilled by the New York\r\nExchange that it should have such an important place in the cotton\r\nmarket? To the uninitiated the speculative features of the market have\r\noften served to condemn it, and at times of speculative fever, or of\r\nmanipulation such as has occurred on one or two occasions, there has been\r\npublic agitation calling for legislation against dealing in futures. Yet\r\nthe New York Exchange performs a very definite and valuable service, and\r\nits trading methods have served to stabilize the whole industry, and to\r\nremove from it much of that very speculation which is frequently charged\r\nagainst the Exchange itself.\r\n\r\nThe justification of the Exchange is found in the fact that the futures\r\ncontracts common on its floor afford the cotton merchant and manufacturer\r\na chance to insure themselves against losses occasioned by fluctuations\r\nin the market. The method by which this is done is called hedging.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy the Merchant\r\nMust Hedge His Sales\r\n\r\nFor the cotton merchant, the situation as it develops is approximately\r\nthis: buying, as he must, all grades and quantities of cotton, he may\r\nhave an immediate market with the spinners whom he serves for only\r\ncertain of these grades, and thus may have left on his hands a large\r\nsupply of cotton of other grades which came to him in his purchases which\r\nhe has no call for at the time. These \"overs\" are subject to the risk of\r\na decline in value unless the merchant can find some way to protect\r\nhimself. Nor is this risk the only one run by the cotton merchant. The\r\nspinners frequently contract for months ahead for the output of their\r\nmills, and it is part of the merchant's task to see that the cotton is\r\navailable at a contract price when the spinners are in need of it. Such\r\ncontracts for future deliveries are not only common but customary. If it\r\nwere impossible for the spinner to make such contracts, it would, of\r\ncourse, be impossible for the weaver to make future contracts for the\r\ndelivery of cloth. Such a condition unsettling the distributing markets,\r\nwould be intolerable. Hence, the necessity of future contracts between\r\nmerchants and spinners. The situation would otherwise be a very difficult\r\none for the merchant whose supply of cotton, and the price he must pay\r\nfor it, are subject to the vagaries of nature, which may grant a\r\nbountiful crop one year, and a short and inferior one the next, with\r\nconsequent fluctuations in price sufficient not alone to wipe out his\r\nprofit but his capital as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hedge As a\r\nCredit Transaction\r\n\r\nHedging, as has been said, affords the protection, against serious loss\r\nwhich these varying conditions make probable.\r\n\r\n\"It may almost be said,\" observes Arthur R. Marsh, former President of\r\nthe New York Cotton Exchange, \"that as the main business of banks today\r\nis not dealing in money, but in credits, so the main business of the\r\ncotton exchanges is now in credit transactions in cotton, toward which\r\nthe actual cotton 'on the spot' stands in much the same relation as the\r\nmoney in the banks to the sum total of their transactions in credit. It\r\nserves as a reserve at once for the satisfaction of unliquidated credit\r\nbalances and for the maintenance of sound credit values in all the credit\r\noperations.\"\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Mr. Marsh describes the hedging process in these words: \"A\r\nhedge is the purchase or sale of contracts for one hundred or more bales\r\nof cotton for future delivery, made not for the purpose of receiving or\r\ndelivering the actual cotton, but as an insurance against fluctuations in\r\nthe market that might unfavorably affect other ventures in which the\r\nbuyer or seller of the hedge is actually engaged.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The floor of the New York Cotton Exchange_]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Merchants Secure\r\nProtection by Hedging\r\n\r\nThe cotton merchant, in making a hedge, would proceed in this fashion.\r\nHaving made an actual sale of cotton to a spinner for future delivery,\r\nthe price being fixed according to current quotations in New York for\r\ndeliveries to be made in the month specified in the contract, he would\r\nbuy futures for a corresponding amount of cotton on the New York Cotton\r\nExchange.\r\n\r\nIf the price of cotton should have advanced when the time for the\r\ndelivery of the actual cotton comes, he will be able to sell his futures\r\ncontract at a higher price, thus offsetting the loss sustained upon the\r\ndeal in actual cotton. Or, if he prefers, he may hold the \"futures\"\r\ncontract until its maturity and sell it at the then prevailing figure.\r\nThe first course would be the customary one for a bona-fide merchant,\r\nwhose sole concern is protecting himself against loss by fluctuations in\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, cotton should fall before the merchant bought to\r\nfulfill his actual contract, he would make a profit upon his sales to the\r\nspinner. He would, however, suffer a loss upon his futures contract, for\r\nthe seller would be able to purchase the cotton to fulfill the contract\r\nat a lower point than the contract called for, and would consequently be\r\nable to deliver to the merchant who made the hedge, cotton which the\r\nlatter would be forced to accept at a price higher than the then\r\nprevailing one, and thus again the profit and loss would balance each\r\nother. The usual custom is, not for the merchant to accept delivery, but\r\nto pay over to the seller of the futures contract the difference between\r\nthe contract price and that prevailing. This would be just the difference\r\nbetween his own purchasing and selling price in his actual dealing with\r\nthe spinner, and so would eliminate the profit, due to change in price,\r\nmade in that transaction. Thus, by the hedging process, the merchant\r\nloses a possible profit on a falling market, but at the same time fails\r\nto suffer a loss when the market is against him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHedging as Practiced\r\nBy Cotton Manufacturers\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer's hedging is necessarily somewhat different in practice,\r\nthough the same in principle. If he accepts orders for cloth requiring\r\nmore cotton than is being held in his warehouse, he may buy futures\r\ncontracts to the amount of the additional cotton he will need. Then in\r\nthe event that his actual purchase of cotton may be at a figure which\r\nwould tend to reduce or eliminate his profits on the sale of the cloth,\r\nalready fixed by contract, he may sell his futures contract at a\r\ncorresponding profit, thereby preventing loss. Should the price of cotton\r\nfall in the interim, his profit on the sale of the cloth will be larger,\r\nbut the settlement of his futures contract will be expensive to the same\r\nextent. Thus he sacrifices the chance of a greater possible profit in\r\norder to be insured against loss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Compress bales bound for New Orleans_]\r\n\r\nIt is probably more common for the cotton merchant to hedge than for the\r\nmanufacturer to adopt that proceeding. The manufacturer, as a rule, has\r\nbeen accustomed to buy his cotton during the buying season, that is, in\r\nOctober, November, December, and January, and he makes his arrangements\r\nwith his selling agents on the basis of the price paid, trusting to his\r\nown judgment, and the comparatively small fluctuations in the price of\r\ncloth in normal times, to protect him against loss. It is usually\r\nbelieved that the Southern mills, being newer, and frequently of a\r\ndifferent financial standing, have found it more desirable to have\r\nrecourse to this form of insurance than their older competitors in the\r\nNorth. Then, too, the rapid development of the cotton warehousing system\r\nhas made it less necessary for the manufacturers to tie their money up in\r\ngreat quantities of cotton, as they can buy when the market appears\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nProtection for Mills\r\nRunning for Stock\r\n\r\nA very important point, however, and one which all manufacturers would do\r\nwell to consider carefully is the protection which a \"futures\" market\r\ngives to a manufacturer making plain goods for stock, particularly on a\r\nfalling raw material market, which, of course, would also mean a falling\r\ngoods market. To stop the mill because values were falling would be\r\nimpossible without utter disorganization, and its attendant heavy loss,\r\nwhile to keep on manufacturing stock goods with a certainty that they\r\nwould be worth less each succeeding month is a disheartening prospect for\r\nthe mill.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the manufacturer sells \"futures\" for the succeeding months\r\nto the extent of the cotton which he would require each month to\r\nmanufacture the goods, he can run his machinery as usual and have a\r\nperfectly free mind, as he has safeguarded himself against any loss due\r\nto a falling value of the raw material. Suppose, for instance, the cotton\r\nmarket fell off, say one cent a pound each month, with a corresponding\r\nfall in the value of the woven goods. In such an event, the manufacturer\r\ncould, as each month arrived, buy a contract for an amount corresponding\r\nto what he had sold, and at a proportionately less price, thus making a\r\nprofit on the \"futures\" which he had sold to an extent which would\r\ncorrespond, approximately, to the smaller value which his manufactured\r\ngoods would then have in the market. Thus the profit on the one side\r\nwould take care of the loss on the other. If the market rose instead of\r\nfalling, he would make a loss in replacing his futures contract, but his\r\ngoods would then command a higher value, and again no loss would be\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nThis method of hedging is the regular and standard practice of the\r\nEnglish cotton mills, and, of course, of many of our domestic mills, but\r\nthere are some manufacturers who, through their unfamiliarity with the\r\noperations of the futures market, are quite unaware of the protection\r\nwhich they thus have at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Responsiveness of\r\nthe Great Exchanges\r\n\r\nThe great exchanges, and the New York Exchange in particular, are thus\r\nused by cotton merchants and manufacturers in every part of the world to\r\nprotect themselves in their buying and selling operations. The value of\r\nmiddling cotton in New York is kept upon par with the value of the same\r\ncotton in any growing or manufacturing point, such factors as freight,\r\ninsurance, brokerage, etc., being allowed for in the quoted price.\r\nQuotations on the Liverpool Exchange are thus higher than quotations in\r\nNew York by the difference between the amount it costs to deliver cotton\r\nin Liverpool and to deliver it in New York. Thus the merchant and\r\nmanufacturer is able to buy and sell hedge contracts on the New York\r\nExchange, knowing that operations at the New York price in New York are\r\non a parity with operations at the Liverpool price in Liverpool, or at\r\nthe Havre price in Havre. Thus the hedge contract which a Southern\r\nmerchant sells in Atlanta, through his broker on the New York Exchange,\r\nmay be bought by a spinner in Tokyo or Manchester, anxious to insure his\r\nsupply of cotton at a price which would make his contracts profitable.\r\n\r\nIn normal times the selling of merchants and the buying of manufacturing\r\nengaged in actual and bona fide hedging transaction has been estimated by\r\ncompetent authorities to make up fully seventy-five per cent. of the\r\ntrading done on the New York Exchange. The remaining twenty-five per\r\ncent. may thus be attributed to speculative operations, that is\r\noperations entered into by outsiders through brokers, on the chance of a\r\nrise or a fall in the market. Nor is such speculation without its value.\r\nIt is the speculators, as a rule, who are the first to take advantage of\r\ncrop reports or weather conditions, or news likely to affect the market\r\nfavorably or unfavorably, and buy or sell as their judgment dictates.\r\nTheir operations serve to discount such changes to some extent, or at\r\nleast to make the breaks and rises more gradual than they would otherwise\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nIn abnormal times, that is times of great scarcity and great demand, or\r\nbumper crops and small demand, the speculative element plays a larger\r\npart, for it is in such times that the greatest fluctuations in price\r\ntake place. Merchants or manufacturers holding hedging contracts are\r\nunder a greater incentive to buy or sell, as they see their opportunities\r\nfor profit growing greater or less, as the case may be, and in\r\nconsequence more contracts are made, and they pass from hand to hand with\r\ngreater rapidity, the gain or loss thus being distributed among a greater\r\nnumber of persons than would otherwise be the case. It is the operations\r\nof speculators, and the manipulation that once or twice during its\r\nhistory has been possible by unscrupulous traders which has brought about\r\nat such times public agitation for the abolition of the Exchange. Recent\r\nchanges in the form of the cotton contract have made it almost impossible\r\nfor such operations, if repeated, to be successful, and thus there is\r\nlittle likelihood that the very important economic function of the\r\nExchange will be interfered with by legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Cloth Market\r\n\r\n\r\nThe output of the manufacturer finds its way to the ultimate consumer\r\nthrough a variety of channels. What these are will depend upon the manner\r\nin which the various mills are organized, and their respective policies\r\nas to the marketing of their products. Some mills, usually very large\r\norganizations, will have plants completely equipped, in every department,\r\nspinning, weaving, dyeing, printing, finishing, etc., and will process\r\nall of their goods themselves in every detail, offering them on the\r\nmarket in their finished form. Some of these may make a wide variety of\r\nfabrics suitable for one class of trade, or for many classes of trade,\r\nwhile others will specialize on a few articles. A good many concerns that\r\nare not of the largest size, but which confine their production to a few\r\narticles, may also put the goods through every operation themselves.\r\n\r\nThen there are a great number of cotton mills, many of them of very large\r\nsize, which do no weaving at all, but confine themselves to spinning,\r\nfinding a market for their yarns with the many weaving mills which have\r\nno spinning plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany Large Mills\r\nDo No Finishing\r\n\r\nNumerous mills, both large and small, manufacturing, principally, goods\r\nof a staple grade, which may either be of fine or coarse character, sell\r\ntheir entire product in the gray, or unfinished state, because they do\r\nnot wish to burden themselves with the task of putting the goods through\r\nthe various finishing treatments necessary to fit them for the market.\r\nThis method of disposing of the product appeals to many for it reduces\r\nthe manufacturing operations to the spinning of the yarn, and to the\r\nweaving of the cloth. The owners or managers of the mills may have had no\r\nexperience outside of these branches, and if they themselves were to\r\nattempt to finish, or \"convert,\" the goods they would be entering strange\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nWhatever method of merchandising may be adopted, it is certainly obvious\r\nthat the product of large mills is so great that it must be disposed of\r\nin a large way, and hence various channels of outlet have grown up to\r\nsatisfy the requirements of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nDealing Direct With\r\nDry Goods Jobbers\r\n\r\nA substantial portion of the output of the mills (but nothing like what\r\nit was years ago, and it grows relatively smaller every year), is\r\ndisposed of directly to dry goods jobbing houses, and by them to retail\r\ndealers, who sell it by the yard to the consumer. This practice was\r\nformerly more widespread, but has diminished greatly in recent years. A\r\nfurther enormous yardage passes eventually through the cutting-up houses,\r\nwhich manufacture garments of every kind, from overalls to pajamas, or\r\nfrom raincoats to shirts, and dispose of their products to distributors,\r\nwho eventually sell them to the public. Then there are retailers whose\r\nrequirements for goods of particular kinds are so considerable that their\r\norders are of sufficient magnitude to warrant the mills in dealing with\r\nthem direct.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are the great mail-order houses, with a gigantic annual\r\nturnover, whose catalogues go to every part of the land, and which\r\nhandle great quantities of piece goods, as well as made-up garments, and\r\nwhose custom is eagerly sought for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Thousands of looms in a single room_]\r\n\r\nOther mills make fabrics suitable for use in the military and naval\r\nestablishments of the country, and in other public channels, and which,\r\nin selling these fabrics, will deal directly with the Government, or\r\nindirectly through intermediaries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, and other domestic outlets, there is a great\r\nquantity of goods produced for export, which are handled through houses\r\nspecially organized for that trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nMerchandising by\r\nDry Goods Jobber\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest established agencies for handling mill products is the\r\ndry goods jobber, and it is to be remarked that many large retail houses\r\ndo also a substantial jobbing business, though generally less so in\r\ncottons than in other classes of fabrics. The jobber will buy finished\r\nproducts from those mills which sell goods in that state, and will also\r\nbuy large amounts of gray goods. These he will sell principally to retail\r\ndistributors, but his transactions, in addition, will extend into a\r\nmultitude of channels, and, he will deal with small garment manufacturers\r\nand makers of all kinds of wares, and will also sell considerable\r\nquantities to the larger cutters when they are unable, for one reason or\r\nanother, to buy direct from the mills or from the converters. There are\r\nalso numerous small jobbing concerns which buy substantial quantities\r\nfrom the larger jobbers as occasion may require.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest avenues of outlet is through a class of dealers known\r\nas converters, and there are converters operating in every kind of fabric\r\nfrom cotton to silk. In the last forty or fifty years, this business has\r\ndeveloped into immense proportions, and the converter performs a real and\r\nimportant service in the trade. He is intimately acquainted with the\r\nneeds of his customers, and possesses a fair knowledge of the kinds of\r\ngoods put out by the various mills and the different constructions in\r\nwhich they are sold, and is well acquainted with all of the market\r\ndyeing, finishing, bleaching, and printing concerns, having also a fair\r\nunderstanding of the various treatments accorded to the goods. He buys\r\nhis goods in the gray from the mills, and sends them to the finishers,\r\nprinters, etc., to be treated, according to his instructions. By a\r\ncareful studying of the fabric constructions, and of the subsequent\r\ntreatments, he is able to create fabrics of a suitable and marketable\r\ncharacter, which are in some respects different from those offered by any\r\nof his competitors, and which are brought out with an exact knowledge of\r\nthe requirements of the trade to which he is catering. He is able to make\r\na profit, and generally a very substantial one, by handling the goods in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nConsiderable capital is required by the converter, as goods bought in the\r\ngray have to be paid for on practically a cash basis, and he may have to\r\ncarry them for a time before they are finally marketed. The converter\r\nsells to the cutting-up houses, to jobbers, and to retailers, or, in\r\nfact, to whatever trade he seeks. Large and profitable businesses have\r\nthus been built up. Many converters have adopted their own distinctive\r\ntrade marks, and since the goods that they handle are known by these\r\ntrade marks, the identity of the mill which made them originally is often\r\nentirely unknown to the ultimate consumer. The converter can give his\r\nbusiness to whatever mill, at the time, will give him the best value for\r\nhis money.\r\n\r\n\r\nJobbers Must Know\r\nStatus of Mills\r\n\r\nThese operations are facilitated by the services of another class of\r\nintermediaries, the cloth brokers. If a buyer, whether he be retailer,\r\njobber, converter, or what not, wishes to secure goods of a certain kind,\r\nhe would have a very difficult task if he had to canvass the entire\r\nmarket, and ascertain what was being offered. Hence he is likely to go to\r\nthe cloth brokers. They are in touch with all the principal manufacturing\r\nsources of supply, and will have daily quotations of the offerings of the\r\ndifferent mills; he will know which mills are \"sold up,\" and which are\r\nopen for business, and what class of goods they desire to sell.\r\nConsequently the cloth brokers are in a position to offer to would-be\r\npurchasers a wide variety of the different cloths which are available on\r\nthe market, and it is their business to buy from the mills as cheaply as\r\nthey can, and so get the best possible price for their customers. The\r\ntransactions are handled on a small commission, and the average buyer, in\r\nmany kinds of goods, is able to do much better by working through a\r\nbroker than by opening negotiations directly with the mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost Mills Have\r\nOffices in Chief Markets\r\n\r\nMills selling their products through brokers in this manner may, or may\r\nnot, have a representative stationed in the goods market, according to\r\ncircumstances. Mills, manufacturing a limited number of plain fabrics,\r\nand which do not sell through brokers, may also be without\r\nrepresentatives in the primary goods market, and will dispose of their\r\nproduct directly from the mills, partly by correspondence, and partly\r\nthrough the efforts of their travelers. The great mass of the mills,\r\nhowever, are regularly and efficiently represented in the great central\r\ngoods markets, principally New York, though also in Boston, Philadelphia,\r\nBaltimore, and elsewhere, and their selling agencies are very highly\r\norganized institutions.\r\n\r\nThese establishments which have sufficient capital to enable them to\r\nfinance themselves--with or without the assistance of regular bankers'\r\nloans--may maintain their own selling offices, and market their product\r\nin their own names directly to their customers. The amount of capital\r\nrequired to handle a business in this way is proportionately very large,\r\nfor the concern must be able to keep itself sufficiently supplied with\r\nraw materials, and then to carry the expenses as these materials pass\r\nthrough the slow stages of manufacture until the goods are finally\r\nfinished, after which they may have to be kept in stock for a time until\r\nthe delivery dates, and then, after shipment, the accounts have to be\r\ncarried until the bills are paid, so that, from the time the manufacturer\r\npays for his raw material until he finally receives pay for his goods is\r\na very long period.\r\n\r\n\r\nLoans Made Upon\r\nWarehouse Receipts\r\n\r\nThe financing of a business conducted in this way can be assisted by\r\nloans from warehouses upon stocks of raw material stored there, by bank\r\naccommodation, and by facilities which certain banks give for the cashing\r\nof a substantial percentage of those accounts on the books of the concern\r\nwhich the customers have not discounted themselves. Also, in handling his\r\nmerchandise in this way, the manufacturer must have a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the best means of marketing his product, and this care\r\nof the selling end is, of course, an added burden upon his shoulders\r\nwhich, in many cases, he may not feel competent to handle properly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the comparatively few concerns which do have sufficient\r\ncapital to sell directly, in addition to the many from great to small who\r\nhave not, will market their product through what are known as dry goods\r\ncommission houses, sometimes referred to as factors, and simply as\r\ncommercial bankers. The commission house system, as we have it here, does\r\nnot exist anywhere else, and its great growth in the United States has\r\nbeen largely due to certain peculiarities in our banking methods, which\r\nhave prevented mills--even those with a reasonably sufficient supply of\r\ncapital--from obtaining the amount of direct banking accommodation\r\nnecessary for their needs.\r\n\r\nThe commission house, in its usual relations with its mills, undertakes\r\nto conduct the sale of their products. Some commission agents insist upon\r\nhaving the entire selling control of all of the goods the mill produces,\r\nor at any rate, of all the goods of the kind which they are equipped to\r\nsell. Others, again, will take over a partial selling control of the\r\nproduct of a mill, and various lines of the same manufacturer may be\r\nfound offering through different channels. There are some obvious\r\ndisadvantages connected with this latter procedure.\r\n\r\nIf the mill is a very large one, the selling agent may handle no goods\r\nexcept the product of that mill, but in the great majority of cases, the\r\nfactor will represent a considerable number of mills.\r\n\r\nImmediately on receipt of the invoices of the goods consigned to the\r\nselling agent, the mill can draw against them a percentage of their\r\nvalue, previously agreed upon, usually about two-thirds of their net\r\nselling price, and upon these loans interest at the rate of 6% is\r\ncharged. The difference between the rate at which the commission house\r\ncan borrow money, (in normal times perhaps 4 to 4-1/2%), and the 6% which\r\nis usually charged to the mills, constitutes a considerable part of the\r\nprofits of the factor's business.\r\n\r\n\r\nFactors Provide\r\nSelling Facilities\r\n\r\nThe factor often provides a store, together with a complete selling and\r\noffice force, and every facility for receiving, storing, selling, and\r\nshipping the goods, and for financing the business. The salesmen of the\r\nhouse travel throughout the country, reaching all the important markets,\r\nand the managers of the different departments, who thus understand the\r\nneeds of the market, are in a position to advise the mill with\r\nintelligence and exactness as to the kind of goods which should be made\r\nto meet the requirements of the trade. The cost of warehousing and of\r\ninsurance on the merchandise is also paid by the commission agent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Spinning room in a large mill. These are all ring\r\nspindles_]\r\n\r\nThe prices at which the goods are to be sold are fixed by the mill, but,\r\nof course, they will finally sell at prices determined by the market\r\nconditions. As the goods are sold, the amounts which they bring are\r\ncredited to the mill, less whatever has been advanced against them. The\r\nselling agent also stands ready, no matter on what time and terms the\r\ngoods may be sold, to credit the mill with the net value of the sale,\r\nless 6% interest for the unexpired time within which the customer may\r\npay, and from this interest charge also he secures part of his return. Of\r\ncourse if bank rates are very high, as they sometimes are for short\r\nperiods, the factor may be out of pocket on the interest account, instead\r\nof making profit. As the goods are sold, so are the equities in them\r\nreleased, and the balance is credited to the mill. If, however, the goods\r\nsell at a loss there will be no equities coming to the mill, and, in\r\nfact, there are not infrequently deficiencies to make up.\r\n\r\nFor these services, and according to the nature of the goods being sold,\r\nvarious commissions are charged, usually ranging between the limits of 4\r\nand 8% of the net returns of the sales. Plain unfinished goods which are\r\nmarketed in large quantities are charged for at a relatively low figure,\r\nwhile fancy goods, sold in smaller quantities and requiring more effort\r\nand expense to sell them, are charged for at a higher figure.\r\n\r\nThe selling agent also guarantees the credits of the firms to which he\r\nsells, so that no losses for bad debts can fall upon the manufacturer,\r\nbut, at the same time, he will decline orders from any concerns except\r\nthose with whose credit he is entirely satisfied.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently when the manufacturer conducts his own selling\r\noperations, he will use the facilities afforded by the commission house\r\nfor the financial part of the business only, taking advances on his\r\ngoods, having his sales cashed, and his credits guaranteed, etc. For\r\nthese lesser services, of course, the commissions charged are smaller.\r\n\r\nWhen goods are charged out, the bills are payable to the commission\r\nhouse, and so, as far as the customer is concerned, the commission house\r\nis the principal in the transaction. In many cases certain modified\r\narrangements are made, but in most instances the business is conducted as\r\nherein described, and it may fairly be said that the bulk of the dry\r\ngoods of all kinds produced in the United States finds its way into the\r\nmarket through commission house channels.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking Plain Goods\r\nfor Future Orders\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of most cotton mills, and certainly of those making\r\nplain goods, to run steadily all the year round, and thus the commission\r\nagent, whether he has secured advance orders on the goods or not, has\r\nconstantly flowing into his hands an assured stream of merchandise which\r\nmust eventually, when sold, pay him a commission. Thus the securing of a\r\ngood account means an assured source of revenue to the commission agent.\r\n\r\nThere are no more important selling organizations for textiles than these\r\ndry goods commission houses, many of them having an immense and\r\nprofitable turnover, and their businesses are conducted on a very high\r\nplane of efficiency, and probity, although, in itself, there are many\r\nevils attendant upon this method of the distribution of merchandise, and\r\nwhich exercise at times a most adverse influence upon the well being of\r\nthe mills whose product is thus disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrength of Agents\r\nMakes \"Paper\" Acceptable\r\n\r\nIt is evident that no ordinary capital would be sufficient for the\r\nsupplying of money on call to mills in the immense quantity needed, and\r\nit is here that the banker's capital is called into use. The commission\r\nhouse is usually a concern of substantial means, sometimes very rich, and\r\nnearly always of a financial standing, which will give it, on its own\r\naccount, an assured credit. At certain times of the year the calls for\r\nmoney from the mills are greater than at other times, and as shipments\r\ncome forward, and advances are required, the commission house, in order\r\nto put itself in funds, will issue a series of its own notes in\r\nconvenient sized amounts, $5,000 to $10,000 each, for instance, and will\r\noffer these for sale, through its note broker.\r\n\r\nThis paper, which commands an advantageously low rate of interest, and\r\nwhich is issued for convenient periods of time, averaging perhaps four\r\nmonths, is much sought after by banks and other institutions in primary\r\nmarkets and throughout the country wishing to invest current funds in a\r\nsafe and not unprofitable medium. This paper is so acceptable to banks\r\nnot only because the credit of the issuing firm is behind it, but also\r\nbecause it is known that the money which is obtained for the notes will\r\nbe lent out to mills on ample collateral. The issuing house is in a\r\nposition so entirely safe that hardly ever can a question arise as to its\r\nability to take care of its borrowings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFinancing Cotton and Cotton Cloth\r\n\r\n\r\nNo industry shows better than the cotton industry the economic importance\r\nof banking service. No industry, perhaps, utilizes to such a complete\r\nextent the modern instruments of credit, nor is so dependent upon these\r\ninstruments for its proper functioning. At no point in the progress from\r\nseed to cloth is the capital represented by the cotton necessarily or\r\neven customarily tied up. And not only may the cotton itself at any stage\r\nbe the basis of credit accommodation, but also, the actual added value\r\nwhich the labor of any factor in the chain may give to the cotton may\r\nitself be realized upon in advance. The credit possibilities of the\r\nindustry have grown with the admission of acceptances to rediscount in\r\nthe Federal Reserve Banks, and this admissibility has likewise played a\r\npart in the present growth of the warehouse system, the lack of which was\r\na handicap to the industry in past years.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit Necessary from Seed\r\nto Finished Product\r\n\r\nIn considering the raw cotton and the cloth market it was necessary to\r\ninclude some account of the financial and banking processes involved in\r\nthe various commercial transactions undertaken. It is perhaps advisable,\r\nhowever, even at the risk of some repetition, to give a quick survey of\r\nthe financial and credit aspects of the industry as a whole from the time\r\nthe cotton is placed in the ground up to the actual sale to the cutter-up\r\nor the jobber.\r\n\r\nThe utilization of credit begins, as we have seen, with the very planting\r\nof the crop. Many of the growers, even those who own their farms, are men\r\nof limited means, and are not able to pay for the necessaries of life and\r\nof labor during the long growing season. The country storekeeper,\r\naccordingly, in return for a lien on the crop, allows them credit at his\r\nstore, usually charging interest based on the monthly statement of their\r\nledger accounts. He in turn receives the necessary accommodation for his\r\nown purchases from the local bank, or from the local buyer or factor with\r\nwhom he is affiliated. The high prices prevailing during the past few\r\nyears have undoubtedly changed to some extent the small grower's\r\nfinancial position.\r\n\r\n\r\nCash for the Grower\r\nFrom the Local Bank\r\n\r\nThe larger growers, or the great corporations which let out cotton lands\r\nto renters, usually operate the stores in their villages upon the same\r\nbasis, credit being advanced against the renter's share of the growing\r\ncrop. Even these large corporations are seldom able to meet the heavy\r\ndemands of the growing season without recourse to the credit service of\r\nthose to whom they sell their cotton, or to the local banks. The banks,\r\nor buyers, in turn discount at least a proportion of the commercial paper\r\nthus created with their correspondent banks in New York, Boston, or other\r\nfinancial centers. This credit arrangement, it will be seen, is almost\r\nentirely based on a moral risk, the lien being made upon the growing\r\ncotton which cannot be liquidated until it is grown, picked, and ginned.\r\n\r\nWhen the crop is picked, it is weighed by the merchant before it is\r\nginned, and the farmer is credited on the merchant's books with the\r\namount due him, the balance in his favor being given him in cash. His\r\nconcern with the cotton is thus ended. In the event that he is able to\r\nfinance himself through the season he takes the cotton directly to the\r\ngin, and has it ginned and baled there, paying the ginnery for the\r\noperation, and selling the cotton directly to a local buyer and the seed\r\nto an oil mill. If the gin warehouse is available, and he desires to wait\r\nfor a more favorable opportunity to sell, he may store the cotton, taking\r\na gin receipt for it, against which the cotton will eventually be\r\ndelivered. The gin receipt may be collateral for a loan from a cotton\r\nfactor, or from a local bank.\r\n\r\nThus, it will be seen that the grower receives accommodation throughout\r\nhis season, and is paid cash for his product when it is delivered. This\r\narrangement puts a heavy strain upon the cotton buyers, particularly upon\r\nthose who deal in large lots for the mills. The method by which the\r\nbuyers pay the growers is thus described:\r\n\r\nThe buyers make arrangements with the local bankers where the gins are\r\nlocated for the payment of the cotton, the banks furnishing the actual\r\ncash against tickets issued by the buyer's representatives, holding the\r\ntickets in question as their collateral in the meantime. When a\r\nsufficient amount of cotton has been accumulated the local banker, at the\r\nrequest of the buyer's agent, delivers the tickets in question to the\r\nlocal agent of the railroad, who in turn issues a bill of lading covering\r\nthe shipment to the compress point, which then is attached to the draft\r\ndrawn by the buyer's agent upon the buyer's head office, which draft\r\nincludes the price paid for the cotton plus interest and exchange charged\r\nby the local banker, who is reimbursed for the amount of the draft thus\r\ndrawn. When this cotton is ready for export (or for shipment to the mill\r\nin the United States) local bills of lading, covering shipment from point\r\nof origin to compress point, are exchanged by the cotton buyer's banker\r\nfor local bills of lading to port or for through bills of lading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_Picked 100 pounds today_\"]\r\n\r\nWhen cotton is bought at compress points, compress receipts instead of\r\ntickets are delivered to the local banker, who pays for the cotton as\r\npurchased by the buyer's representative from time to time. When a\r\nsufficient amount of cotton is ready for shipment the compress receipts\r\nare exchanged by the banker for local bills of lading to port (or to\r\nmill), or through bills of lading, as the case may be. These bills of\r\nlading are attached to the draft drawn by the representative on the head\r\noffice of the buyer, the local bank being reimbursed for the amount thus\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\nBuyers must necessarily hold great quantities of cotton in storage, for\r\nthey buy whatever cotton is offered, and must sell, as we have seen,\r\ncertain grades and qualities to the mills in order that they may weave\r\nthe cloth for which their orders call. Cotton must, therefore, be held in\r\nstorage, either at the compress points, which is usual, or at warehouses\r\noperated by factors, or by independent corporations, or in their own\r\nwarehouses.\r\n\r\nWhile the buyers by cash payments are concentrating the cotton necessary\r\nto fill their domestic or foreign orders, their need for funds is a\r\npressing one. Their arrangements with local banks we have seen. When the\r\ncotton is shipped, the local bank, by means of drafts on the buyer's head\r\noffice, is relieved of the burden it has been carrying, but the cotton\r\nstill represents capital, and if that capital is to continue to earn its\r\nwages it must be the basis for credit. The factors and large banks in New\r\nYork or Boston, which have been assisting the local bank, must now assist\r\nthe buyer and the warehouseman. The methods by which this burden is\r\nshifted to the larger banks are varied, and we can consider only one or\r\ntwo of their aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\nSame Mills Pay Cash, Relieving\r\nFactors of Burden\r\n\r\nSome of the larger New England mills pay cash for the cotton which is\r\nshipped to them, buying sufficient in the season to carry them through,\r\nor nearly through, the year. Their buyers, therefore, need support, if\r\nthey need it at all, only during the period of concentration. They may\r\nhave their private banking arrangements, and may be able to utilize their\r\nwarehouse receipts or bills of lading, or their mere notes based upon\r\nmixed collateral, for an advance of sixty to seventy-five per cent. of\r\nthe value of the cotton, the line having been arranged in advance. Credit\r\nmay be obtained by the buyer directly from the warehouseman, who thus\r\nbecomes a factor in his own right, being supported by arrangements\r\npreviously made with his own bank. Credit may also be obtained from a\r\nbank, upon bills of lading which are exchanged for warehouse receipts\r\nwhen the cotton is delivered at the port or at any warehousing point; or\r\nthe credit obtained from the bank may be settled and a new credit opened\r\nwith the warehouseman when the cotton is shifted from cars to storage.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarehousemen as Factors of\r\nGrowing Importance\r\n\r\nThe growing importance of the warehouseman has been mentioned. His\r\nservices have developed with the need of mills for greater credit, and\r\ntheir unwillingness to tie up their working capital in cotton held in\r\ntheir own warehouses. Mills which formerly bought all their year's supply\r\nduring the buying season, so-called, now take their cotton from\r\nwarehouses as they want it, buying it from their buyers, and making\r\npayment according to the individual standing arrangements. The advent of\r\nthe warehouseman who is either a banker, or closely affiliated with a\r\nbank, has undoubtedly done much to make the financing of cotton a more\r\nelastic and feasible proposition, distributing the risk over a wider\r\ncircle and making credit more readily available at any point in the\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Weighing gin bales in a ginnery yard_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cotton warehouses in the South_]\r\n\r\nThe mill, we have seen, frequently pays cash for its raw stock, or else\r\nbuys upon short term notes. The average mill does not have a working\r\ncapital large enough to enable it to tie up the thousands of dollars\r\nnecessary for such a proceeding, as well as the funds which must\r\nconstantly be paid out for wages, for operation expenses of all kinds,\r\nfor upkeep, and all other overhead. Mills, as a matter of fact, are\r\nfrequent borrowers, either from general banks, or from textile banks or\r\nfactors, or from their selling agents, who, as we have seen, combine\r\ntheir primary and original function of selling with that of supplying\r\nfinancial assistance.\r\n\r\nMills which purchase cotton from their buyers and pay cash, or\r\napproximately cash, for it, usually buy such cotton to fill orders which\r\nthey have already received from their selling agents. They may, in\r\ncertain instances, obtain an advance from their agents of a proportion of\r\nthe whole selling price of the order, and out of that advance pay for the\r\npurchase of cotton, or they may hold the cotton in warehouses, using it\r\nonly as needed, and putting up the warehouse receipts as collateral for\r\nloans.\r\n\r\nThe raw cotton itself, however, represents only a portion of the mill's\r\noperating expenses and it cannot be the entire basis for financial\r\noperations of the magnitude often needed. These broader financial wants\r\nmay be met out of the prospective selling price of the cloth by means of\r\nloans from the selling agent; or, they may be met by direct relations\r\nwith a commercial bank, which may make loans on ordinary collateral, on\r\nacceptances, or, as frequently happens in the case of mills of undoubted\r\nintegrity, on the mere note of the company operating the mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelling Agent May Shift\r\nBurden to Banks\r\n\r\nWhen the burden is assumed by the selling agent, or factor, he in turn\r\nmay shift it to the bank, either by indorsing the note of the mill, or by\r\nindorsing the note of the purchaser of the cloth or by borrowing directly\r\nfrom the bank on his own paper.\r\n\r\nThe converter, as a rule, is not a factor, but a merchant pure and\r\nsimple, seeking accommodations from a factor or a bank as his needs may\r\nrequire it. Inasmuch as he usually buys for cash or on short-term notes,\r\nand sells to jobbers or retailers upon more extended terms, his needs are\r\nfrequently heavy. His relation with his factor may be, and frequently is,\r\nupon the basis of accounts receivable, or he may borrow upon his own\r\ncollateral, or, if he is counted an \"A1\" risk, upon his unsecured note.\r\n\r\nThese, in brief are the financial steps in the progress of cotton from\r\nthe grower to the jobber. A cursory view is all that is possible, because\r\nin the words of a textile banker of standing \"every textile banking\r\ntransaction is a law unto itself.\" Yet enough has been said to show the\r\nall-important part which banking plays in the cotton industry, and to\r\nindicate how dependent are the turning of wheels and the distribution of\r\ncotton and of cloth upon the credit which banks and bankers are able to\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\n\r\nFactors and Their Wide\r\nFinancial Service\r\n\r\nFrequent use has been made of the word factor, and no adequate definition\r\nof its meaning has yet been given. The factor is, briefly, the commercial\r\nbanker of the industry, and his duty is to provide, at any stage of the\r\ncotton process, the financial assistance which may be necessary, either\r\nfrom his own resources or through his affiliations with some large bank.\r\nIt is true, of course, that some factors work only with those dealing in\r\nraw stock, and some confine their services to mills. Some factors are\r\ncotton buyers, some are selling agents, some deal with buyers and some\r\ndeal with selling agents. Some are employed only by the mills. Recently,\r\nhowever, the tendency has been to develop under one roof a unit\r\ninstitution capable of handling every textile banking transaction. It\r\nwill be interesting to enumerate here, briefly, the various functions and\r\nfacilities of one such institution:\r\n\r\n    1. It makes loans to cotton buyers and to mills\r\n       on cotton held in warehouses or in transit.\r\n\r\n    2. It checks the credit of the mill's prospective\r\n       customers.\r\n\r\n    3. It cashes accounts receivable.\r\n\r\n    4. It makes advances against merchandise for\r\n       the account of mill, converter, or jobber.\r\n\r\n    5. It finances merchandise and raw material requirements,\r\n       and current operations.\r\n\r\n    6. It deals in acceptances, specializing, of course,\r\n       upon paper arising out of transactions in the\r\n       textile industry.\r\n\r\n    7. It maintains an Industrial Department, which\r\n       includes:\r\n\r\n       (a) the services of a consulting architect, expert\r\n           in mill construction.\r\n\r\n       (b) the services of a production engineer,\r\n           skilled in the laying out of plants in the line\r\n           of greatest efficiency, and in diagnosing\r\n           and correcting the production mistakes\r\n           of an inefficient mill.\r\n\r\n       (c) information as to the newest mill practice,\r\n           which it is ready to provide for its\r\n           clients and others.\r\n\r\n       (d) readiness to assist customers in the expansion\r\n           of their business either by financing\r\n           new mill construction or by providing\r\n           sales representatives in other countries.\r\n\r\n       (e) maintenance offices abroad, either for the\r\n           buying or selling of textiles or equipment,\r\n           or raw materials, or for the complete and\r\n           direct financing of such transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAmerican Cloth in Foreign Markets\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the American cotton grower supplies more than half of\r\nthe world's demand for raw cotton. The cotton manufacturer in the United\r\nStates is in no such position. This is not to say that American cotton\r\ngoods are not exported in very considerable amounts. From the inception\r\nof the industry in this country varying percentages of the total product\r\nhave been sent abroad. The following table, taken from the United States\r\nStatistical Abstract (1910) shows the average annual exports of cotton\r\ngoods for the five year periods named, expressed in millions of dollars:\r\n\r\n                         _Uncolored    _Colored\r\n              _Total_       Cloth_       Cloth_       _Other_\r\n    1856-60     $7.5         $2.4         $2.3          $2.8\r\n    1861-65      3.7           .4           .9           2.4\r\n    1866-70      4.1           .9           .3           2.8\r\n    1871-75      3.1          1.7           .6            .7\r\n    1876-80     10.0          6.1          2.6           1.2\r\n    1881-85     13.0          8.0          2.9           2.1\r\n    1886-90     12.4          7.4          3.2           1.6\r\n    1891-95     13.3          7.7          3.0           2.5\r\n    1896-1900   20.4         11.6          4.4           4.3\r\n    1901-05     31.3         17.2          7.0           7.0\r\n    1906-10     35.1         16.8          7.2          11.0\r\n\r\nThe irregularity of the export trade, as shown by these figures, has been\r\nexplained on several grounds, the chief factors being, apparently, the\r\nfluctuations in the prosperity and consequently in the buying power of\r\nthe home market, and the pressure upon the home market exerted by the\r\nrapid growth of cotton manufacturing in the South.\r\n\r\nThe normal position of the United States as an exporter of cotton goods\r\nis shown by the following table, which gives the exports of the chief\r\nmanufacturing countries in the year before the war (the figures for 1915\r\nare also given because they show the changes which had already begun):\r\n\r\n                          1913            1915\r\n\r\n    United Kingdom   $618,000,000   $418,000,000\r\n    Germany           117,000,000     30,100,000\r\n    France             78,000,000     60,000,000\r\n    Japan              58,000,000     95,800,000\r\n    United States      55,500,000     60,200,000\r\n    Switzerland        50,300,000     65,800,000\r\n    Italy              47,800,000     30,500,000\r\n    India              38,900,000     27,300,000\r\n    Holland            30,900,000\r\n    Austria Hungary    27,800,000\r\n    Belgium            23,700,000\r\n    Russia             22,500,000     19,700,000[B]\r\n    Spain               8,300,000     17,400,000\r\n    China               1,400,000      2,100,000\r\n\r\n-----\r\n  [B]  Eleven months.\r\n\r\nThus, despite the very remarkable growth which had taken place between\r\n1910 and 1913, the United States ranked fifth among the nations exporting\r\ncotton goods. The reasons for this might be summed up in almost a word.\r\nThe attractiveness and rapid growth of the home market provided an outlet\r\nfor practically the whole output of American mills. With high prices\r\nprevailing in the home market, the manufacturer was not called upon to\r\nexert himself to stimulate sales in regions where competition would\r\ninevitably be keen and profits small.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor Handicaps to\r\nTrade Development\r\n\r\nSupporting this main objection there have been others. Until recently the\r\nbanking facilities abroad were insufficient to the needs of a greater\r\ncommerce; and shipping facilities, in pre-war days, were not such as to\r\nmake regular shipments possible to many foreign markets. Over these\r\nconditions manufacturers had not direct control, but there were other\r\nmatters in which their own short-comings were all too evident. There is\r\nlittle need to list again the familiar complaints, known to every reader\r\nof Commerce Reports and the export magazines. Faulty packing and\r\ninsufficient attention to orders were the most frequent. The former was\r\nundoubtedly due to inexperience, and the latter to the tendency of the\r\nmanufacturer or merchant to consider the foreign market as a place for\r\ndisposing of a surplus unsalable at home. To this attitude may also be\r\nattributed the frequency with which shipments for which orders had been\r\naccepted have been delayed or overlooked altogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Compress bales awaiting export on a Savannah wharf_]\r\n\r\nThe foreign market remained for the American manufacturer a prize so\r\ndistant and of such questionable value that he was simply not willing to\r\nmake the effort and spend the money that would be necessary to compete\r\nwith British, German, French, and other sellers. He would have had to\r\nknow local customs and tastes, and all the details that he had so\r\narduously acquired a knowledge of for the home market. The time was not\r\nripe.\r\n\r\n\r\nU. S. Export Trade\r\nAs Affected By War\r\n\r\nThe war served to disarrange the system of cotton cloth distribution of\r\nthe whole world. It is now a commonplace to say that the United States,\r\nby the cutting off of the usual sources of supply, succeeded for the\r\nfirst time in entering in force markets which hitherto had been closed.\r\nIt would probably be truer to say that foreign buyers, finding it\r\nimpossible to secure their customary supply from their regular sources,\r\ncame to the United States and asked American manufacturers to supply\r\ntheir imperative wants.\r\n\r\nJust what this meant is found in the statement that while in 1913 our\r\ntotal exports of cotton goods amounted to about 445,000,000 yards, in\r\n1917 the figure was about 690,000,000 yards, an increase of fifty-five\r\nper cent. The increase, moreover, has been in the colored cottons, the\r\nuncolored cloths showing an actual decrease.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom, during 1917, exported nearly 5,000,000,000 yards of\r\ncloth, so there is no immediate prospect that the United States will be a\r\ndangerous competitor for that country, except in a few limited lines and\r\nin a few markets. The chief gain to the American cotton industry brought\r\nby the war was the opportunity it gave merchants to introduce their goods\r\nabroad at a time when loss was next to impossible. Operating at an\r\nassured profit they were able to learn the markets without the long and\r\ndiscouraging fight which would have been necessary had the competitive\r\npower of the other nations been at full force. If, as seems likely, the\r\neconomic forces which projected the United States so suddenly and\r\ndramatically into the world's markets shall continue to operate, then the\r\nfuture will see a further development of our sales.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture of Foreign Sales\r\nAnd Probable Markets\r\n\r\nOur best and most permanent markets are probably to be found in such\r\ncountries as Cuba, Mexico, the Philippines, Central and South America,\r\nand, to a certain extent, Canada and Australia, and parts of Asia and\r\nAfrica. To be sure, competition will have to be met both from European\r\ncountries and from Japan, whose development in the cotton industry in\r\nrecent years has been nothing short of phenomenal. She has practically\r\ndoubled the number of her spindles in the last ten years, and her\r\ncompetition has already been felt, for instance, in China, where American\r\ngray goods have been practically eliminated from the market. Other\r\ngrowing markets for Japanese cotton goods are South Africa, Australia,\r\nIndia, and the west coast of South America.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba and the Philippine Islands, the United States has the advantage\r\nof a preferential tariff agreement and excellent shipping facilities. In\r\nCanada and Australia our cotton goods are popular but the tariff duties\r\nare in favor of Great Britain. In the Dutch East Indies there is at\r\npresent a good opportunity for getting a foothold in the white goods\r\ntrade. Argentina has lately been our best market for cotton goods, and as\r\nthe imports of cotton products into that country amounted to $65,000,000\r\nin 1916, this trade is worth the intensive efforts which are now being\r\nmade to clinch it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Development\r\nUp to Merchants\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of South America, as in the Manila market, there are\r\nestablished American trading firms that are doing extensive development\r\nwork and their efforts have produced favorable results. In the other\r\nLatin-American markets there are practically no local American firms and\r\nin none of them have the possibilities of the trade been more than\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion seems to be that if the United States is to keep what\r\nshe has gained by the war in the cotton goods trade the same care and\r\naggressiveness will have to be shown in the foreign as in the domestic\r\ntrade. England's position today as the foremost exporter of cotton\r\nmanufactures is the result of careful study of foreign markets and their\r\nrequirements, of catering to the tastes of the people, of aggressive\r\nadvertising, of competent foreign salesmen, of reliability in filling\r\norders, of good packing, and of more or less liberal credit terms.\r\nManufacturers in the United States will have to follow the same procedure\r\nif this country is to keep her present position in international trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSome of the Grower's Problems\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring, the farm hands begin the work of getting the seed\r\nbeds ready. Upland fields have to be terraced, ditched, and drained by an\r\nelaborate process before the work is well begun. Plowing and sub-soiling\r\nare the least of the planter's worries. He must often chop last year's\r\nstalks with a disc harrow or with a stalk cutter. The spike tooth or the\r\ndisc harrow must work again after the plowing is finished. It is\r\ncustomary to plant cotton in a slightly raised bed, in order that\r\nthinning may be more easily done, and that the soil may be more quickly\r\nwarmed. Much planting is still done by hand, one man dropping the seeds\r\nin the long straight furrow and another following close behind him with a\r\nhoe, covering them up; but of late years the one-horse planter and the\r\ntwo-horse combined lister and planter have come into vogue, and, now that\r\nthe tractor is both cheap and serviceable, it is possible to plant two or\r\nmore rows at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Long Season of\r\nIntensive Cultivation\r\n\r\nWhen the tiny seedlings first appear above the fragrant mellow soil, the\r\nplanter's work is well begun, but it is only begun, for then comes the\r\nseason of cultivating and thinning out. As soon as there are two or three\r\ninches of growth, the first cultivation takes place. How many times the\r\nfield is cultivated depends on the planter, the nature of the soil, the\r\navailability of labor and other factors. But the general rule is, the\r\nmore cultivations, the more cotton. The first cultivation scrapes away\r\nthe soil from the plants, leaving them on a small ridge, where the\r\nthinning-out process can easily be done with a hoe. The stalks are left\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty inches apart in the hill, the rows being usually\r\nabout three and a half feet apart. The next cultivation, usually with a\r\nsweep, pushes the soil back against the plants. Then begins the farmer's\r\nfight against the weeds, each of which seems sturdier and harder to\r\neradicate than its predecessor. Usually cultivation must take place about\r\nevery three weeks.\r\n\r\nIn June, on the average, the bell-shaped blossoms appear. On the first\r\nday they are cream colored or white; on the second day, they change to a\r\nbeautiful wild-rose pink, deepening toward evening to a deeper magenta or\r\ncarnation. On the third day they fade completely, and the development of\r\nthe boll begins.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Many Enemies\r\nof the Growing Boll\r\n\r\nOf the plants upon which humanity depends, the various species of the\r\ngenus Gossypium have probably more enemies, and more relentless enemies,\r\nthan any other. Besides army worms, cut worms, locusts, green flies, leaf\r\nbugs, blister mites, and several others, nature has produced and rendered\r\nextremely prolific and hardy, these two particular pests, the boll weevil\r\nand the boll worm. It is said that the collective attacks of all the\r\ninsects which feed upon cotton cost the country in the neighborhood of\r\n$60,000,000 every year at pre-war prices. The little gray beetle that the\r\nworld knows as the cotton boll weevil is responsible for most of this.\r\nThe mother weevil lays her eggs in the bud. As the grubs from the eggs\r\ndevelop, the bud drops. If a weevil arrives on the scene after the bolls\r\nhave begun to form, she lays her eggs in those with a fine indifference.\r\nThese bolls will not drop, but the grubs ruin the cotton they contain.\r\nThere have been numerous investigations and experiments made to develop a\r\nvariety of cotton impervious to the weevil's attacks, as well as to find\r\nanother insect willing to meet him in combat and overcome him. Guatamalan\r\ncotton is said to be immune and efforts are being made to transplant it\r\nto the United States. A small ant-like creature called a \"kelep\" has also\r\nbeen found, which attacks, kills and devours the weevil, but,\r\nunfortunately, the kelep prefers a warmer clime, and pines away and dies\r\nin even the mild winters of the cotton belt. The boll worm is very\r\nsimilar to the corn worm with which all housewives are familiar, and\r\nindeed corn is its favorite diet. But cotton will do in a pinch, and,\r\nnext to the weevil, he ruins more cotton than any other pest. The boll\r\nweevil cost the country about $25,000,000 yearly, pre-war prices, and the\r\nboll worm about $12,500,000 yearly, enough to justify an even greater\r\nexpenditure for investigation and eradication than has yet been made.\r\n\r\nDespite the ravage of insects and diseases, when a well-tended field of\r\ncotton is ripening, one would think from the number of bolls per plant,\r\nthat the owner's fortune was surely made. Unfortunately, the plants shed\r\nbolls as well as buds and flowers, in great numbers. It has frequently\r\nbeen noted that even well-fertilized plants upon good, carefully\r\ncultivated soil, will mature only fifteen to twenty per cent. of the\r\nbolls produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cotton blossoms and bolls at various stages of growth_]\r\n\r\nThe planter will tell you that he would be willing to stand the boll\r\nweevil, the dropped bolls, the extra cultivations, and all the remainder\r\nof it, if he could only be sure that cotton which did mature would be\r\npicked when it should be picked, and picked with rapidity and care.\r\nPicking is the most laborious, as it is the most picturesque operation on\r\nthe plantation. Many types of machine pickers have been introduced, but\r\nthere are few planters who will admit that any of them suits his\r\nparticular needs. Now, as a hundred years ago, the picking is done by\r\nhand. It is a simple operation, so simple that children ten years old can\r\ndo it, and women excel in it. But the best pickers rarely average more\r\nthan a hundred pounds a day, and most of them pull much less. Careless\r\nwork plays its part, too, for cotton is easily dropped from the boll and\r\nsoiled or lost altogether. Leaves and twigs as well as the shell of the\r\nboll frequently cling to the fiber, and are picked with it, and all these\r\nthings tend to dirty and discolor it, and lessen its marketability. It\r\nrequires about three pounds of cotton with the seed in it, as picked, to\r\nproduce one pound of ginned or lint cotton.\r\n\r\nThere were in the United States, in 1917, a total of 24,272 ginneries, of\r\nwhich 3,921 were idle. Each active gin produced an average of 526 bales\r\nrunning bales of cotton. The number of gins shows a tendency to decrease\r\nevery year, not rapidly, but surely, and this despite the opposite\r\ntendency of the crop. The Whitney gin of the old days has been improved\r\nbeyond the dreams of its inventor. He boasted that one man could do as\r\nmuch with his machine as ten men without it. Today's gin averages about\r\nfive bales a day--a quantity which the negro of old would find difficult\r\nto turn out in a year.\r\n\r\nTo the gin then, which is located either on the plantation or in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood, the mule drawn wagons, driven by negroes as a\r\nrule, bring their loads of cotton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gin bale and compress bale showing reduced bulk of\r\nlatter_]\r\n\r\nAs the downy lint, pulled from the tenacious seeds, rolls into the\r\nreceiving bin of the gin, the huge compressors are put to work. The\r\ncoarse jute bagging is on hand, and the steel straps spread out. The gin\r\nbalers as a rule turn out a bale measuring approximately 28 by 56 by 42\r\ninches, and weighing approximately 500 pounds including twenty pounds of\r\nbagging and straps. The cotton, in being separated from its seeds, has\r\nlost about two-thirds of its weight. But the first process in the long\r\nseries that manufacturing entails has been completed, and the cotton is\r\nready to begin its long journey to the mill. It is usually carted to the\r\nnearest railroad station, and from there shipped to the compressing\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe small farmer almost always gets his money for the cotton as it leaves\r\nthe gin. His interest in it, therefore, is ended when the buyer there\r\npays him the current price. The cotton is a market commodity from that\r\ntime forth.\r\n\r\nThe compress is a large and powerful hydraulic press, whose function is\r\nto force the loosely packed gin bale into a density that will make its\r\nhandling by the railroads, ships, and warehouses more easy and\r\neconomical. The compresses are frequently owned by the railroads.\r\n\r\n\r\nGin Bales and\r\nCompress Bales\r\n\r\nBefore being compressed, the bales are sorted according to grade, and are\r\nthen compressed into a smaller sized bale, measuring approximately 28 by\r\n56 by 18 inches, with a density of from twenty-eight to thirty pounds a\r\nsquare foot. It is this bale which is handled from that time forth,\r\nwhether it be for export, for consumption in Northern or Southern mills,\r\nor whether, as sometimes happens, it is shipped from place to place as\r\nmarket conditions change, and the price offered makes reshipment\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMovement for\r\nImproving the Bale\r\n\r\nIt is encouraging to note that the war brought about, under Government\r\nauspices, a very definite movement for the improvement of the bale. The\r\nproposal demands the installation of high pressure baling machines at the\r\ngin, capable of producing a bale with a density of thirty-five pounds a\r\ncubic foot. The trading unit in cotton is one hundred bales, and such a\r\ncompression would mean that one hundred bales could be loaded into a\r\nsingle freight car, and shipped directly to the export point or\r\nwarehouse. The present practice requires three cars to carry the ginnery\r\nbales to the compressor, and two cars to carry the compressed bales to\r\nthe port, warehouse, or mill. The saving in freight and handling is\r\nobvious. It needs only a glance at the photograph of the two bales side\r\nby side to see the possible saving in waste and \"city crop,\" or tare. The\r\nobstacles in the way of such an improvement are those which face any\r\nrevolutionary change in commercial methods. Established practice,\r\ninvested capital, and the natural conservatism of human nature militate\r\nagainst quick improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nIn the Cotton Mill\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of cotton cloth may be divided into five departments:\r\n\r\n    1. Preparatory processes: Opening, carding,\r\n       combing, and drawing.\r\n\r\n    2. Spinning.\r\n\r\n    3. Spooling, warping, sizing, slashing, entering\r\n       or drawing-in.\r\n\r\n    4. Weaving.\r\n\r\n    5. Converting and finishing, including bleaching,\r\n    mercerizing, dying, printing, and finishing.\r\n\r\nBefore the cotton fiber can be spun into the yarn from which the cloth is\r\nwoven, the bales must be broken open, the impurities removed, and the\r\nfibers arranged so that they are parallel and contain no bunches or\r\ntangles. Care in these processes has become more and more necessary and\r\nimportant as the demand for a higher quality of cloth, possessing greater\r\nstrength and evenness, has been developed. Hence, some of the most\r\nelaborate, complex, and admirable machinery in the mill is that devoted\r\nto these preparatory processes. The principle involved is always that of\r\nthoroughly cleaning the material, then opening it so that every fiber\r\nshall be thoroughly separated from its fellows, and then straightening\r\nout the fibers, no matter what types of machines may be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nConveying Fiber\r\nBy Air Blast\r\n\r\nThe heavy laps of cotton are first thrown directly from the bale into the\r\nbreaker, and the cotton is then usually blown through large pipes from\r\nthe room in which the bales are broken to the room in which the openers\r\nare located.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the opener are two. The first is to clean from the\r\ncotton the dirt and bits of leaf, pod, and foreign substances, which may\r\nhave clung to the fiber as it passed through the gin back on the\r\nplantation. The second is to roll the cotton into a more or less regular\r\n\"lap,\" as it is called.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Energetic\r\nOpener At Work\r\n\r\nAs the cotton goes into the opener (see diagram on following page), dusty\r\nand dirty, it is seized by strong teeth fastened upon a large cylinder\r\n(A), revolving rapidly, and is flung by centrifugal force against an iron\r\ngrid (B) time after time. Sometimes there is a strong current of air\r\nblowing through the tangled mass, helping to loosen the particles. The\r\ndirt comes out through the grid and is carried away, while the lint\r\nitself, after being carried around an indefinite number of times,\r\ngradually works its way along a channel, and finally out between two\r\nlarge rollers (C), which compress it once more, so that it is, in effect,\r\na sheet of batting. This sheet, or lap, is rolled up in a large roll (G),\r\nwhich may be two or three feet in diameter, and is then ready for the\r\nfirst doubling or blending process. In mills where strength and evenness\r\nof yarn are at a premium, the sheets from three or four laps may be fed\r\nthrough another opener, usually called a \"scutcher,\" which breaks them\r\nall apart again, mixes up the fibers, cleans out more of the dirt, and\r\nproduces a more even lap.\r\n\r\nThe cotton, as it comes from the opener and the scutcher, is much cleaner\r\nand more attractive. It begins to look like the riches it contains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cross-section diagram of opener_]\r\n\r\nTo convey the heavy opener-lap from the opener to the carding room, the\r\nmore modern mills are doing away rapidly with hand-power, and carry the\r\nlap on a sort of travelling mono-rail conveyor.\r\n\r\nThe fibers of the lap which comes from the opening room are by no means\r\nparallel, but lie in all directions just as they happened to come from\r\nthe grid of the opener. The function of the card is to straighten them,\r\nand at the same time to remove those which are knotted or immature and of\r\na length below that required for the yarn to be spun, and to take out\r\npractically all of the impurities which may have escaped in the opening\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe principle of carding is one of the oldest of textile mechanical\r\nprinciples, and all the improvements that have been made have been in\r\ndevelopments rather than in basic ideas. Hargreaves, inventor of the\r\njenny, and Sir Richard Arkwright both expended their ingenuity upon it,\r\nthe latter seeming to have been the first to provide a carding machine\r\noperated by other than hand-power. The basic principle involved is the\r\nstraightening out of the fibers by combing or brushing them with wire\r\nbrushes or cards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _\"Scutchers\" at work_]\r\n\r\nIn the revolving flat card, which dominates the field today, there are,\r\nas a rule, three principal cylinders. The lap passes first under the\r\nsmallest of the three, called the taker-in, which is covered with very\r\nfine saw-teeth all in one long strip of steel, wound and fixed spirally\r\nin the surface of the cylinder. The taker-in receives the cotton from a\r\nfeed-roller (C) that turns above a smooth iron plate (D) called the feed\r\nplate. The saw-teeth comb the fibers which are imbedded, so to speak, in\r\nthe lap, and deliver the loose ones to the second cylinder, which is the\r\nlargest of the group. This main cylinder is covered with wire teeth all\r\nbent at exactly the same angle. The cotton clings to them, and is carried\r\naround to the top of the cylinder, where it is engaged by teeth on the\r\nrevolving-flat card which are bent in the opposite direction. This\r\n\"card-clothing\" arranged in strip, crosswise on a travelling lattice,\r\nmoves in the same direction as the cylinder but moves very slowly, and so\r\nthe fibers are carded between the two sets of wire points, the short and\r\nimmature fibers remaining on the card wires of the lattice and the\r\nperfect and now almost entirely parallel ones being carried over from the\r\nmain cylinder to the doffer cylinder, the third of the trio. From this\r\nthey are removed by an oscillating comb (F), coming off in a light,\r\nfleecy lap, which is condensed through a funnel into a soft untwisted\r\nroping, or sliver, about the diameter of a man's thumb, and is then\r\ncoiled into a can, usually about 45 inches high by 8 inches diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _View of Modern Motor-Driven Opener Picker_]\r\n\r\nThe conveying of the sliver (pronounced with a long or short i) into the\r\ncan is in itself an exceedingly ingenious operation, although a very\r\nsimple one. The device is attached directly to the card, and is called a\r\ncoiler. The sliver passes into it from the funnel. The hole from which\r\nthe sliver emerges is off the center of a steel plate which revolves\r\nslowly, so that the sliver, as it comes out, has an eccentric motion\r\nwhich causes it to fall into the can in regular coils. Tangling is thus\r\nprevented, and ease of handling secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nCombing Necessary in\r\nSpinning Fine \"Counts\"\r\n\r\nCombing is necessary in the preparation of cotton for the spinning of\r\nfine \"counts\" or coarser yarns where great smoothness and regularity are\r\ndesired. They are now quite extensively used in the United States, and it\r\nis significant of the trend of the industry here that the number is\r\nrapidly growing. The first cotton comber was invented by a Frenchman of\r\nAlsace named Heilmann. The patent was issued in 1845. Now there are on\r\nthe market other machines, both English and American, similar in\r\nprinciple but improved in many ways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Revolving flat cards_]\r\n\r\nThe first of these preliminary processes is that which is done by the\r\nsliver-lapper. The slivers from 14 to 20 cans are drawn along\r\nside-by-side, passing between three pairs of drawing rollers which will\r\nbe described later. From the drawing rollers the slivers now reduced in\r\nsize, pass between two pairs of calendar rollers from which they emerge,\r\nnot as a sliver, of course, but once more as a lap about a foot wide.\r\nThese laps are usually passed to a ribbon lapper, where six of them are\r\nplaced end-to-end, and unrolled simultaneously, passed between four pairs\r\nof drawing rollers, and then superimposed, one upon the other, and,\r\ncalendered once more, issued as a lap a little less than a foot wide.\r\nThis process may be repeated as many times as the quality of the yarn\r\ndesired may require, for each drawing process served to straighten the\r\nfibers and so to render the thread more even and capable of finer\r\nspinning.\r\n\r\nCombing is exactly what its name implies. The lap is actually raked by a\r\nfine-tooth comb with needle-like teeth of steel ranging from 16 to 90 per\r\ninch. This involves breaking the lap again and the intricacy of the\r\ncomber rests in the mechanism which it employs for joining the separated\r\nends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cross-section diagram of revolving flat card_]\r\n\r\nSix or eight laps go through the machine at once, and the product is\r\ncombined, condensed, formed into a continuous sliver, and deposited once\r\nmore into cans. The process is not a fast one at best, and the chief\r\ncontribution of American inventors is in the direction of speed. Each nip\r\ncombs only 4/16 to 4/10 of an inch of fiber. The Heilman machine made\r\nabout 85 or 90 nips per minute. The American improvement makes 130 to\r\n135. The width of the lap in the American machine is likewise increased,\r\nand the saving in labor, therefore, is considerable. English improvements\r\nhave been in the same direction, the resultant saving being almost as\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ribbon lappers_]\r\n\r\nThough many of the processes already described might be called drawing,\r\nin a sense, insomuch as they involve a continual lengthening and\r\nstraightening of the lap or sliver, yet drawing in the strictest sense\r\nhas not yet begun. It may be done only once, for coarse and cheap yarn,\r\nor it may be repeated a half dozen or more times to produce the finer and\r\nmore expensive products. The frame for each repetition is slightly\r\ndifferent, but several types may be isolated. They are, in the order of\r\ntheir use, the drawing frame, the fly frame, or slubber, the intermediate\r\nframe, and the roving and jack frames.\r\n\r\nFor fine counts the slivers from the comber, and for other grades that\r\nwhich comes directly from the card, are taken, then to the drawing frame.\r\nThe slivers from the cans, six or eight in number, are fed through one\r\naperture, and pass, thus combined, between several (usually four) pairs\r\nof rollers, so arranged that each succeeding pair revolves at a more\r\nrapid rate than that which preceded it. The last pair in the series\r\nrevolve probably six or eight times as fast as the first pair. This\r\ncombination of rollers pulls constantly on the more or less irregular\r\nslivers, rendering them always more nearly uniform in diameter and\r\ndensity, the thickness of one of the entering slivers serving to\r\ncounterbalance the thinness of the other. The drawing frame consists\r\nusually of four or five \"heads,\" and the sliver, after it passes through\r\none of these \"heads,\" is put through a second one, along with other\r\nslivers, so that the doubling and redoubling goes on constantly. There is\r\nan electric device to stop the machine when a sliver breaks, either at\r\nthe back or the front of the frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Combers at work in a mill spinning fine counts_]\r\n\r\nFrom the last head of the drawing frame, the sliver passes to the fly\r\nframe or slubber, which not only continues the drawing and doubling,\r\nusually between three pairs of rollers, but through the aid of a device\r\nwhich gives the sliver a slight twist and winds it, for the first time,\r\nupon a spindle. This device is known as the flyer, and is, roughly, a\r\nU-shaped piece of metal, which, revolving, inverted, over the spindle,\r\ngives the thread a slight lateral twist as it coils upon the spindle. The\r\nlatter also revolves, but with a diminishing motion so that the amount of\r\ntwist may be kept uniform as the diameter of the coil upon the spindle\r\nincreases. The sliver, now being twisted, is called a sliver no longer,\r\nbut the slubbing.\r\n\r\nThe slubbing is passed between the rollers in pairs, the emerging product\r\nbeing less in diameter than the diameter of a single slubbing. The\r\nmachine combines the fourfold process of combination, attenuation,\r\ntwisting and winding. There are more spindles upon this frame than upon\r\nthe slubber.\r\n\r\nThe last drawing frame, except for very fine yarns spun from Egyptian or\r\nSea Island staples, is the roving frame, similar in principle to the last\r\ntwo but containing still more spindles. It receives the rovings from the\r\nintermediate frame, combines two of them into one, twists them a little\r\nmore, and winds them upon the spindle tubes. The Jack frame is similar\r\nexcept that its product is finer and smoother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sliver lappers in a Northern mill_]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, however, that the majority of improvements\r\nhave been the fruit of the brains, not of Americans, but of Englishmen.\r\nCopeland points out that this may be due to the English desire to save in\r\nthe consumption of cotton, but that more probably it is due to the\r\ndevelopment of fine spinning in England, in which most of the machines\r\nhere described are chiefly valuable; and he ventures the prediction that\r\nnow that American mills have definitely gone in for the finer counts, it\r\nmay be expected that engineers here will apply themselves to the\r\nimprovement of this machinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Drawing frames, turning slivers into roving_]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Mule\" Versus\r\nthe Ring Spindle\r\n\r\nSpinning is the final process which turns the cotton into firm, coherent\r\nyarn, sufficiently twisted, and ready for the loom. The twist given to\r\nthe thread by the previous machines has been only enough to make the\r\nfibers hold together. They are still comparatively loose and fluffy, and\r\ntheir tensile strength is slight.\r\n\r\nThere are, in general, two types of spinning machines. The first, the\r\nmule, an English product. The second, radically different, is entirely\r\nAmerican. It was invented in 1828 by James Thorpe, and immediately found\r\nsome favor, but it was not until the Civil War that it was received on\r\nequal terms with the mule. Today, however, it dominates in the United\r\nStates, the comparative figures in 1917 being: ring spindles 30,264,074;\r\nmule spindles 3,634,761. The disparity is growing greater every year, and\r\nthe use of the ring is firmly established in other countries as well. The\r\nfigures for 1907 were:\r\n\r\n                          _Mule_        _Ring_\r\n    England (1909)     39,800,000     7,900,000\r\n    Germany             5,740,000     3,722,000\r\n    France              4,122,000     2,481,000\r\n    Austria             2,307,000     1,277,000\r\n    Italy               1,015,000     1,852,000\r\n    Russia              1,031,000     1,320,000\r\n\r\nThe mule, by reason of the great size to which it has been developed, and\r\nthe impressiveness of its large, rhythmic motion, is one of the most\r\nformidable of all cotton machines, as indeed it is one of the most\r\ncomplex. It received its name from the fact that, performing two\r\nprincipal functions--drawing and spinning--it was regarded as a hybrid,\r\njust as the mule is a hybrid cross between the horse and the donkey.\r\n\r\nIn the mule (see diagram on page 53), which is a long and wide machine,\r\ncarrying sometimes, in new models, as many as 1,300 spindles, the drawing\r\nand twisting are not continuous but consecutive. The rovings (B) are held\r\non a creel (A) at the back of the machine, usually in three or four\r\ntiers, or on long beams or spools. They pass from the creel, or spools,\r\nbetween three pairs of drawing rollers (C.) Coming out of the rollers,\r\nthey are fed to the spindles on the carriage which backs away from the\r\ncreel and recedes somewhat faster than the rovings are unwound. This\r\nreceding is the essential motion of the mule, for thus the cotton\r\nreceives its final drawing. The spindles, meanwhile, are revolving\r\nrapidly, spinning the yarn. The twist goes first to the thin places where\r\nthe least resistance is offered. Then, as the carriage carrying the\r\nwhirling spindles continues to back away, the thicker parts of the\r\nthread, being comparatively untwisted are pulled down to the average\r\ndiameter and are twisted in turn. The carriage usually runs back about\r\nsixty-three inches. At the termination of its run, or stretch, the\r\nspindles increase their speed until the twisting is completed and the\r\ncarriage starts on its return trip. This reverses the spindles, and the\r\nthread which has been wound upon them is unwound, the slack being taken\r\nup by one guide wire (D) while the other guides the thread to the winding\r\npoint, and winds it up in the opposite direction on the cone-shaped cops\r\non the spindles. The rollers do not feed out more roving as the carriage\r\nreturns. Hence, there is no slack when the round trip is completed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Slubbers, showing the U-shaped flyers_]\r\n\r\nExcept for the use of drawing rollers, there is little similarity between\r\nthe mule and the ring frame. The latter has no movable carriage, none of\r\nthe splendid sweep of motion that makes the mule so fascinating to\r\nwatch. The ring-frame is simple and business-like, and its speed is\r\namazing. The bobbins holding the roving are placed directly over the\r\nspindles. Around each of the latter is a steel ring. There are at least\r\n112 spindles on each machine, and all the machine rings for the spindles\r\nare fixed in a single frame. The upper edge of the ring is flanged, like\r\na miniature railroad track, and snapped over the flange is a small but\r\nimportant C-shaped steel ring, called the traveler.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Thread is Spun\r\non the Ring Spindle\r\n\r\nWhen the machine is in operation (See diagram on page 56) each roving (H)\r\nleaving its bobbin, runs through the usual drawing rollers (G) then\r\nthrough a guiding wire to the ring, where it is passed through its\r\ntraveler (B) which is always at the winding point on the spindle. As the\r\nspindle and the rollers revolve, the roving is fed out at a considerably\r\nslower rate than the spindle takes it up, so that there is always a\r\ntension on the thread. The whirling spindle thus pulls on the traveler,\r\ndrawing it round and round on its flanged track (A). It revolves just a\r\nlittle more slowly than the spindle and thus the yarn receives its twist.\r\nMeanwhile, the frame (C) on which the rings are fixed moves slowly up and\r\ndown, so that the winding is properly regulated.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to operate the spindles at a remarkable speed. So perfect\r\nare the bearings which have been evolved that the average speed is ten\r\nthousand revolutions a minute, and on fine yarns it is sometimes 12,000\r\nto 13,000 revolutions. The speed is limited by only two factors: the\r\nfirst is the ability of the operator to make splicings when threads\r\nbreak, and the second is the tendency of the traveler to fly off when the\r\nspeed is too high. The number of travelers consumed is high at best, and\r\nin a mill which has long been in operation the floor in the front of the\r\nframe is likely to be paved with the little steel rings which have fallen\r\nand been ground into the planks by the heels of the worker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Diagram of mule_]\r\n\r\nThe battle between the advocates of the ring frame and those who favor\r\nthe mule is still on. For the American spinner the ring has undoubtedly\r\nmany advantages. Because it spins continuously, and not intermittently,\r\nit turns out about a third more yarn per operator. It is usually\r\nadmitted, however, that the thread from the mule is more even in\r\ndiameter. Advocates of the mule say, moreover, that the thread from the\r\nmule is softer and \"loftier\", and that cloth woven from it has a more\r\n\"clothy\" feel. But others say they can produce soft yarn with the ring.\r\nIn the United States, where the labor cost is a vital item, the\r\nring-spindle has an assured place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mules at work_]\r\n\r\nThe yarn is now a finished product. It may be sold by the spinner to the\r\nweaver or it may be woven in the mill in which it is spun. Before it is\r\nready for the loom, however, there are a number of operations which must\r\nbe completed.\r\n\r\nThe yarn from the ring frame, or mule, is wound in a large cop, or on a\r\nbobbin. It must be put upon spools before it can be warped. The spooler\r\nis a simple machine, but one that requires constant attendance. In the\r\nspooler, bobbins are placed upon holders or spindles, and the thread is\r\npassed over a series of guides to the spool, up above. The spool revolves\r\nat a high rate of speed, and the thread is wound evenly upon it. The\r\noperator must watch for broken threads, retie them, replace the empty\r\nbobbins by full ones and see that the empty ones are gathered up\r\nuninjured. She--the operator is usually a girl or woman--must be alert\r\nand active, and especially nimble fingered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _\"Close-up\" of Ring Spindle in American mill_]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important inventions, one that was received with acclaim\r\nby the American manufacturer, and one which actually reduced his labor\r\ncost on spooling no less than ten per cent. at one clip, is a tiny little\r\nthing that is held in the palm of the hand. This is the Barber knotter.\r\nWhen a thread breaks, the attendant places the two ends together in the\r\nmachine and by the mere pressure of her thumb ties the knot much better\r\nthan she could do it without the knotter. The economies which it effects\r\nextend beyond the mere spooling, for better knots mean fewer breaks in\r\nthe warping process, and a better cloth at the end of weaving.\r\n\r\nThe spools from the spooler are placed on a large frame, called a creel.\r\nThe creels have an average capacity of about 600 spools, and there are\r\nusually 16 to 20 in one tier. The threads from the spools are drawn\r\nbetween the dents of an adjustable reed, then under and over a series of\r\nrollers. From here they are led down to the beam, upon which they are\r\nwound. The revolving of the beam unwinds the yarn from the spools and\r\nwinds it regularly and evenly upon the beam itself. There is a device for\r\nmeasuring the length of the warp wound, and stop motions for arresting\r\nthe operation should a thread break or other accident occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Each operator at these spoolers has a Barber knotter on\r\nher hand_]\r\n\r\nThe yarn of the warp must usually be impregnated with a sizing which will\r\nsmooth out and stick down its furry surface and add as well to the\r\ntensile strength so that the strain of weaving may be withstood. For this\r\nthe most effective and most generally used machine is the slasher, the\r\nchief feature of which is a roller, whose lower side is immersed in the\r\nsizing solution. Threads from the warp beam are run around this roller\r\nthrough the solution and then dried, after which it is finally wound on\r\nanother beam for the loom. A considerable number of loom beams can be\r\nfilled from one set of the warper beams mounted in the slasher.\r\n\r\nThe lengthwise threads of a fabric are called the warp. The crosswise\r\nthreads are called the weft or filling. To make cloth, the warp and weft\r\nmust be interlaced with each other in a suitable manner. The operation is\r\ncalled weaving, the machine in which it is performed is, of course, the\r\nloom. The principal operations of weaving are as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. Shedding, or the raising and lowering of the alternate threads\r\n       of the warp, so that the weft may pass under and over them.\r\n       This is done by means of the harnesses and their heddles.\r\n\r\n    2. Picking, or placing a thread of the weft between the warp\r\n       threads so raised and lowered by means of the shuttle.\r\n\r\n    3. Beating-up, or pushing, each thread of the weft into its\r\n       position close against the thread which has preceded it by\r\n       means of the reed.\r\n\r\n    4. Letting-off, or permitting the warp to unwind from the beam only\r\n       just as fast as is needed by the speed of the weaving. This is\r\n       accomplished by friction bands and weights on the warp beam.\r\n\r\n    5. Taking-up, or winding upon a roller the cloth as it is\r\n       manufactured.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these primary operations, the loom has attachments for\r\nperforming several other functions, such as stop-motions for stopping the\r\nloom when warp or filling threads break, or when the shuttle fails to\r\ncross the loom completely; temples for holding out the cloth laterally as\r\nthe weaving proceeds; a mechanism--in the most modern looms--for changing\r\nthe shuttles, or the cops in the shuttles, as the weft thread on the cops\r\nbecomes exhausted, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Diagram of ring spindle_]\r\n\r\nThe modern cotton loom, which automatically removes the filling bobbins\r\nwithout stopping the loom, is rapidly displacing the older types, and one\r\nweaver can now attend to a surprisingly large number of looms, being\r\ngreatly assisted also by the automatic warp and filling \"stop motions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe Finishing Operations\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the manufacture of the cloth, come the operations necessary to\r\nprepare it for the market. These involve such treatments as bleaching,\r\nprinting, mercerizing, dyeing, and finishing (in the narrow sense).\r\n\r\nThe number of machines involved in these various processes rivals the\r\nnumber which are used in the actual spinning and weaving operations.\r\n\r\nModern bleaching is a highly technical science, conceived and planned by\r\nengineers, and carried out with elaborate machinery by skilled workers.\r\n\r\nGray cloth, as it comes from the loom, is of an unattractive color, a\r\ndirty grayish yellow, and contains not only those impurities which it has\r\npicked up on its journey through the mill but those inherent in its\r\nnatural state as well, all totalling some five per cent. more or less, of\r\nthe total weight. In addition there may be numerous bits of leaf from the\r\nboll which have clung to the fibers through all the processing, and which\r\nappear finally in the cloth as little brownish specks, known to the trade\r\nas motes. Finally, there is the sizing which was put into the warp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Warping--The creel in the rear_]\r\n\r\n\r\nBleaching an Intricate\r\nChemical Process\r\n\r\nIn the bleaching of cotton, there is a series of operations which have\r\nfor their object the elimination of the waxy, fatty matters embodied in\r\nthe fiber, as well as any dirt which it may have acquired. Then, there is\r\nthe actual whitening and the bleaching of the cloth which destroys any\r\ncoloring matter which it may contain and finally there are treatments\r\ndesigned to neutralize the effect of the chemicals used in the bleaching.\r\nThus, the sequence of treatments might be: first, boiling in plain water,\r\nwhich removes certain soluble substances; next, an extended boiling in a\r\nstrong alkaline solution, which saponifies the waxy, fatty matters in the\r\nfiber, and thus removes them from the cloth or yarn. Third, a steeping in\r\na bleaching solution--a solution of chloride of lime being largely\r\nemployed for this purpose, and which treatment is known as the chemic.\r\nNext, after another thorough washing there is a treatment in diluted\r\nsulphuric acid to neutralize the effects of the chemic, and finally this\r\nis followed again by another thorough washing with possibly an additional\r\nmild alkaline treatment. The nature and the method of all these\r\ntreatments varies considerably, and depends upon the character of the\r\ngoods being treated, but, at the conclusion, if all has gone well, the\r\ncloth should be a good white and should not be impaired in strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nSingeing Necessary\r\nin Some Finishes\r\n\r\nFor a certain class of goods, where a clean, smooth surface is required,\r\nit is desirable to singe the goods before the bleaching. This is\r\naccomplished by passing the cloth, stretched out at full width, very\r\nrapidly over heated plates, or through gas flames, so that the fine hairs\r\nor fuzz are singed off, but the fabric itself has not had time to take\r\nfire. Both sides may be singed and the goods may be passed more than once\r\nthrough the flame. When yarns are singed, the threads are passed through\r\nthe flame very rapidly, being unwound from one set of bobbins and wound\r\nup on another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Front view of an automatic loom_]\r\n\r\nIn the dyeing operation the cotton piece goods pass through a series of\r\nmachines, the goods being in rope form as already explained, so that a\r\nnumber of pieces can be put into each machine, side by side. The wash\r\nboxes, dye vats, etc. are equipped with overhead rollers, by means of\r\nwhich the goods, which have been sewn end to end, so as to make a\r\ncontinuous string of them, pass out of the dye, over the roller and down\r\ninto the bath on the other side, continuing to circulate around thus\r\nuntil the desired results have been obtained. In addition to the\r\npreparatory washing and boiling, mordanting and dyeing, there are\r\nsubsequent washings to free the goods from loose coloring matter, and\r\nother special treatments are frequently accorded them.\r\n\r\nFinishing in its special and restricted sense, implies a series of\r\ntreatments, such as stretching, starching, dampening, drying, pressing,\r\nsmoothing, lustreing, glazing, stiffening, softening, and whatnot, which\r\nare given to them according to the use to which they are to be put.\r\n\r\nThe printing press is constructed with a large main cylinder (D), the\r\nsize being dictated by the number of colors which it must take care of.\r\nAs the printing operation is a continuous one, there must be a continuous\r\nfeeding of the cloth, a continuous inking of the engraved rollers (C),\r\nand a continuous cleaning off of the unengraved surface after the\r\ninking.\r\n\r\nUnder each roller, where it is fixed in its place in the press, is a long\r\ncopper trough or pan carrying the coloring material, and in the pan under\r\nthe roller, and extending into the coloring matter, is an intermediate\r\nroller known as the \"furnisher\" roller, and, as the press revolves, this\r\ncovers the surface of the copper roller with a heavy film of coloring.\r\nThe surplus coloring is scraped off as the roller revolves, by a long,\r\nsharp blade or knife, known as \"the doctor,\" and after the roller passes\r\nthis it is quite clean, no coloring remaining on it except that in the\r\nengraved portion.\r\n\r\nEach roller has its color pan with its own color in it. Then, as the\r\ncloth (A) passes between the main cylinder, properly covered by suitable\r\nintervening materials and the series of rollers, each roller in turn\r\nprints its own color, and, collectively, the finished pattern is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Diagram of cloth printing machine_]\r\n\r\nThe goods then pass into a drying room and are afterwards introduced into\r\na steaming chamber, where they are given a good steaming at a slight\r\npressure. This steaming develops the colors and causes them to impregnate\r\nthe fibers more thoroughly. Subsequently, for good work, the goods should\r\nbe washed to get rid of the thickening matters that are mixed with the\r\ncoloring, and then the printing appears in all its beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinting on\r\nFull Ground Colors\r\n\r\nThe foregoing briefly describes the processes of direct printing. In this\r\ncase, the penetration of the colors to the opposite side of the goods is\r\nnot very good. If a solid and full ground color is needed both on the\r\nface and back of the goods, it can be had either by the \"Resist\" or\r\n\"Reserve\" method, or by the \"Extract\" or \"Discharge\" method. In the\r\n\"Resist\" method, when a white figure is wanted on a black or colored\r\nground, the goods are first printed with some substance which will resist\r\nthe action of the dye stuffs. Then, when the goods are dyed, the treated\r\npart does not take the color and the substance used as a resist is washed\r\nout, and thus a white figure is obtained on a solid colored ground.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Discharge\" method, the goods are first dyed in a solid color, and\r\nare then treated with certain chemicals which destroy the dyed color\r\nwherever they touch the fabric, these chemicals being subsequently washed\r\nout where they have been applied, and thus again a white figure can be\r\nhad in the colored ground. By the \"Discharge\" method, moreover, colored\r\nfigures can also be printed on colored grounds, as certain colorings have\r\nbeen developed which are not affected by the discharge materials used,\r\nhence, a whole series of beautiful colors can be printed on goods\r\npreviously dyed with black or colored grounds, each color being mixed\r\nwith a suitable chemical for discharging the ground color, and thus the\r\ncolors of the printed pattern come out as desired.\r\n\r\nAnother important process which is applied to both cotton yarn and cotton\r\nfabrics is that known as mercerization, called after \"Mercer\" an English\r\nchemist who introduced the process. Cotton when subjected to the action\r\nof strong, caustic alkali contracts violently, but when again stretched\r\nand straightened it is found to have acquired a distinct silkiness of\r\nappearance, and under the microscope the twisted ribbon-like fibers of\r\nthe material--already referred to--will be found to have become straight,\r\nglossy and rodlike, just as a bicycle tire would appear after air was\r\nblown into it.\r\n\r\nCotton may be mercerized either in the yarn, warp, skein, or in the\r\npiece, the first being more effective. The best and most satisfactory\r\nresults are achieved when the material treated is made of fine long\r\nstaple cotton, either Sea Island or Egyptian, the shorter cottons being\r\nrelatively much less improved by the treatment. The mercerizing does not\r\ndiminish the strength of the material, and gives to it a greater affinity\r\nfor dye stuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Organization\r\nof Cotton Mills\r\n\r\nThe foremen are specialists in their particular departments. The\r\nwarehouseman, at one end, is a judge of cotton stock, and the foreman of\r\nthe weaving room at the other knows how many automatic looms may safely\r\nbe trusted to each weaver on his staff.\r\n\r\nIn between these two there are, according to the individual mill, a dozen\r\nor more other foremen, all reporting regularly to the superintendent, all\r\ncaptains of their own companies of workers, and all keen, in the\r\ninterests of their own reputations, to operate their departments as\r\nintelligently, as efficiently, and with as little friction with their\r\nindividual operators as possible. For it is generally recognized\r\nthroughout the cotton industry that profitable business depends as much\r\nupon the whole-hearted cooperation of the wage-earners, as upon any other\r\nsingle factor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Question of\r\nIndividual Efficiency\r\n\r\nAs for the operators themselves, they are so varied, there are so many\r\nproblems which they have to face, and such difficulties which those who\r\nemploy and direct them have to solve, that anything like adequate\r\nconsideration is impossible. From the impersonal viewpoint, leaving out\r\nof account the human elements, the problems of wages, and the correlated\r\nproblem of trade organization, there remains the question of individual\r\nefficiency. It is that which we have chiefly to consider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Inspecting finished cloth_]\r\n\r\nThe number of men, women, and children employed in the cotton mills of\r\nthe country has increased at a very high rate, but there has been an\r\ninteresting diminution in the proportionate percentage of women and\r\nchildren under sixteen years of age employed.\r\n\r\nThe United States Census of Manufacturers gives the following figures:\r\n\r\nAVERAGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYES IN AMERICAN COTTON MILLS\r\n\r\n           _Men_     _Women_   _Children_  _Total_\r\n    1870   42,790     69,637     22,942    135,369\r\n    1880   59,685     84,539     28,320    172,544\r\n    1890   88,837    106,607     23,432    218,876\r\n    1900  134,354    123,709     39,866    297,929\r\n    1910  190,531    141,728     38,861    371,120\r\n\r\nIn percentages these figures express themselves as follows:\r\n\r\n           _Men_    _Women_  _Children_\r\n    1870    31.5      51.4      17.1\r\n    1880    34.6      49.0      16.4\r\n    1890    40.6      48.7      10.7\r\n    1900    45.1      41.5      13.4\r\n    1910    51.3      38.2      10.5\r\n\r\nThe question of nationality has had an important bearing upon the\r\ndevelopment of the industry in the United States. The constant influx\r\ninto the country of successive waves of immigration from the different\r\ncountries of Europe has often served in a decade to change the whole\r\ncomplexion of the labor question. In the original New England mills, the\r\nemployees were of almost pure English stock. The sons and daughters of\r\nthe Yankee farmers entered the mills, not as a permanent occupation, but\r\nmerely as a means of getting a start in life.\r\n\r\nJust before the Civil War, the Irish began to come rapidly, and the\r\nactual advent of that struggle saw a great number of the remaining\r\nnatives leaving for the army, or thrown out of work. When the fighting\r\nwas over they did not return, but the Irish came in even greater numbers.\r\nThe next decade saw the arrival of the French Canadians in the New\r\nEngland states, and there also came, in quick succession, natives of\r\nItaly, and of the various states of eastern Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baled cloth being put aboard waiting freight cars_]\r\n\r\nThis change in the national complexion had two very important results. It\r\nbrought into the country a constant stream of cheap labor, polyglot, and\r\nlacking in homogeneity, and consequently slow at first to unionize and\r\nstrike. This characteristic brought another in its train--a lack of\r\nstability, and a proneness to transiency. The second result was hardly\r\nless important. It meant that though labor was relatively plentiful, much\r\nof it was unskilled. This lack of skill put a premium upon quantity\r\nproduction, and led to efforts to develop automatic machinery and\r\nlabor-saving devices of all kinds. It compelled most American\r\nmanufacturers to specialize upon the coarser kinds of yarns and cloths,\r\nmade in simple weaves and patterns, in the making of which the minimum\r\namount of skilled labor was required.\r\n\r\n\r\nNative Stock\r\nin Southern Mills\r\n\r\nConditions in the South were somewhat different. From the beginning, the\r\nemployes here have been almost entirely of native stock. They came from a\r\nclass which previously had little opportunity for any employment of a\r\nregular character outside of farming. When the mills were built these\r\nfolks were given, for the first time, an opportunity for continuous\r\nemployment. Whole families entered the mills, fathers, mothers and\r\nchildren serving in different or in the same departments. The South at\r\nfirst specialized on ducks, twills, denims, and such coarse work. Now,\r\nhowever, there is a growing tendency to diversify the product. The reason\r\nis found in the increasing capability of the workers, many of whom have\r\nby now spent many years of their lives in the mills, and whose fathers\r\nbefore them were operatives. Unless present conditions change and the\r\nSouth becomes the mecca of immigrants--a development probably less likely\r\nnow than in the years before the war--there seems to be a strong\r\npossibility that a class of operatives, rivalling eventually in skill\r\nthose of the English mill towns, will be developed. The stock is the\r\nsame, and the latent capabilities are all there. The determining factors\r\nwill probably be the economic changes of the next few years.\r\n\r\nA remaining factor in the organization of the mill is the size of the\r\nindividual plant, the number of spindles and looms it contains, the\r\nnumber of workers employed, etc. It is in just this particular that some\r\nof the most characteristic developments of the American industry are\r\nfound. About the time of the Civil War, the average New England mill had\r\nless than ten thousand spindles. Today the average is probably between\r\nfifty and one hundred thousand, and perhaps nearer the latter figure than\r\nthe former. Some of the mills have nearly, if not quite, a full million\r\nspindles in several buildings. The average in the South is much less than\r\nthe New England average. The industry in the older section is definitely\r\nlocalized, even to the extent of having whole towns devoted almost\r\nexclusively to the manufacture of single grades of cloth. In the South\r\nthe mills are more widely scattered, advantage having been taken of labor\r\nsupply, water power, and other conditions. Local pride has sometimes\r\ncaused the establishment of mills in regions economically unfitted for\r\nthem. Such mills do not long survive. The advantage of large scale\r\nproduction has thus been seized chiefly by the New England mills, but the\r\ngenerally lower wages of the South have tended to equalize the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Original Whitney cotton gin, preserved in Smithsonian\r\nInstitute in Washington_]",
