JOHN TROWBRIDGE,\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR OF JEFFERSON PHYSICAL LABORATORY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advances in science lead to hopes of the sudden accumulation\r\nof gold, just as the discovery of new worlds led our ancestors to\r\ninvest in many inflated enterprises of commerce and conquest. This\r\nolder temptation has passed away, for there are no new worlds to\r\ndiscover, and this small globe has been practically staked out; but the\r\nmysterious domains of science are still illimitable, and afford vast\r\nopportunities for inflated schemes which have their prototype in the\r\nSouth Sea Bubble.\r\n\r\nLet us refresh our memory of this surprising delusion. It arose in\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne, nearly one hundred and eighty years ago, and\r\nwhen we consider the extent of the speculation and gambling which it\r\ncaused and the number of those who lost everything and who consigned\r\ntheir families to bitter poverty, we are tempted to class it with\r\nthose other calamities which preceded it and which afflicted England\r\nso heavily--the great fire of London and the plague. The South Sea\r\nCompany claimed to have enormous sources of profit in certain exclusive\r\nprivileges, obtained from the Spanish Government, for trading in their\r\npossessions in South America and Mexico; and it may be well for us in\r\nthese times of the flotation of schemes for obtaining gold from salt\r\nwater and from sands, of power from air and something more ethereal\r\nthan air, to be reminded of the many bubbles that came into existence\r\nand burst at the time of the collapse of the South Sea Bubble.\r\n\r\nThe stock of the South Sea Company rose from one hundred to a thousand,\r\nand an army of future victims crowded the offices of the company,\r\nanxious to invest in what they believed would suddenly enrich them.\r\nIndeed, all England seemed to go mad, and the craze of the time is\r\nreflected in the writings of Pope and Swift. Pope says:\r\n\r\n  “At length corruption like a general flood\r\n  Did deluge all; and avarice creeping on,\r\n  Spread like a low-born mist, and hid the sun.\r\n  Statesmen and patriots plied alike the stocks,\r\n  Peeress and butler shared alike the box;\r\n  And judges jobbed, and bishops bit the town,\r\n  And mighty dukes packed cards for half a crown;\r\n  Britain was sunk in lucre’s sordid charms.”\r\n\r\nThe rise of the great bubble was accompanied by the formation of\r\nhundreds of minor ones. Among these we will mention a few which are\r\npertinent to the subject of this paper:\r\n\r\nA wheel for perpetual motion. Capital, one million pounds.\r\n\r\nFor extracting silver from lead.\r\n\r\nFor the transmutation of quicksilver into a malleable fine metal.\r\n\r\nPuckles Machine Company, for discharging round and square cannon balls\r\nand bullets, and making a total revolution in “the art of war.”\r\n\r\nFor carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, “but nobody to know\r\nwhat it is.”\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the proposed capital for floating these and\r\nsimilar schemes was three hundred million pounds. We find, in the\r\nannals of the time, that the Duchess of Marlborough persuaded her\r\nhusband, John Churchill, the great general, not to increase his\r\nholdings, and to sell his shares; he, like a sensible man, took a\r\nsensible woman’s advice and made one hundred thousand pounds. When we\r\ncome to speak of the connection of women with modern delusions, we must\r\nremember this act of one of their sex.\r\n\r\nAt this time, nearly two hundred years after the singular outbreak of\r\nchimerical projects of Queen Anne’s reign, we can match some of these\r\nbubbles almost exactly; for have we not had the Keeley motor, the\r\nextraction of gold from salt water, and is there not great activity\r\nin making the wonder of the public over some advance in science a\r\nsource of money-making? The unscientific person is certainly open to\r\na new danger in the increasing tendency to promote enterprises based\r\nupon some new scientific discovery, and it behooves the followers of\r\nscience to suggest a remedy for this growing evil. I shall endeavor to\r\ndo my part in this paper in pointing out the necessity of some oracular\r\nmedium--a scientific oracle of Delphos--to which the common man can\r\nrepair and get trustworthy information, for it is a melancholy fact\r\nthat such information can not be obtained from the daily press or from\r\nthe literary magazines of the time.\r\n\r\nMany of our newspapers draw such an income from their advertising\r\ncolumns that the editors are unwilling to print any criticism which\r\nwould lead to the restriction of this source of gain; thus if a company\r\npromoting a scientific bubble should advertise liberally in a leading\r\nnewspaper, the editors are usually loath to insert an article upon the\r\nscheme, for the printing of the criticism might lead to the withdrawal\r\nof the advertisement. It is possible that the editors of such daily\r\npapers have not overmuch confidence in the judgment of scientific men,\r\nfor have not the latter often been mistaken? There was Lardner, who\r\nprophesied that steamships could not cross the Atlantic, but we must\r\nremember that Lardner was not a scientific man; he was a popularizer\r\nof science, and never made a scientific investigation. It is said that\r\nthere have been college professors who have denied the possibility of\r\nsending messages under the ocean. This I also doubt, for I am a witness\r\nin the flesh of the way such stories can arise. Not long since I was\r\ninvited to speak before a commercial club, and the presiding officer,\r\nin introducing me, remarked: “The professor will now address you on\r\nthe advances in electricity. When I was in college I well remember\r\nhis describing an electric motor and his remark that it would never\r\nbecome a practical invention.” There was, of course, laughter, and the\r\npresident sat down with a comfortable air of having made a point. The\r\nprofessor pointed out that the presiding officer graduated before he\r\nbecame professor in the university, and before the Gramme machine and\r\nthe electric motor were invented. Nevertheless, the world loves to\r\nbelieve in the inaccuracy of the accurate, and even a sophomore takes\r\ninfinite delight in discovering arithmetical mistakes in an edition of\r\nNewton’s _Principia_.\r\n\r\nI mention this proneness to believe that scientific men are apt to be\r\nmistaken, for it is a blame laid at their doors often by the promoters\r\nof scientific bubbles, and for a very easily understood reason, and the\r\neditors of newspapers and literary magazines can ease their consciences\r\nafter publishing sensational scientific articles by reflecting on the\r\nfallibility of the followers of science. Lawyers and judges, too,\r\nmake their mistakes; nevertheless, we continue to resort to them for\r\nadvice; and few editors, I imagine, would dare to publish a legal\r\nopinion without consulting an authority in law. Yet we read every day\r\nso-called scientific articles in newspapers and magazines which have\r\nevidently never been submitted to competent critics. Have we not read\r\nstatements of the possibility of exploding powder magazines on board\r\nships by electric waves; of the manufacture of liquid air without the\r\nexpenditure of energy; of electricity direct from coal; papers on the\r\nnebular theory, more nebulous than any nebula yet discovered? When we\r\nread a broad sheet in the morning paper setting forth a glowing scheme\r\nto manufacture power out of nothing, to what oracle can we repair to\r\nascertain the truth? It is true that common sense might lead the reader\r\nto reflect that when he is told that the shares can now be obtained for\r\nfive dollars, but in a short time they will be advanced to ten dollars,\r\nand now is the time to invest, that such good things are quickly taken\r\nup without the necessity of advertising. When the morning mail brings\r\na prospectus of a company formed to make diamonds by electricity,\r\na company with ten million dollars capital (why not one hundred\r\nmillions?), to whom should one go to allay the fever of sudden gain?\r\nWhile men and women will carefully consider which line of steamships\r\nto Europe is the best equipped with engines, the efficiency of which\r\ndepends upon the laws that prove the impossibility of perpetual motion,\r\nthey enter at the same time upon schemes to obtain power without the\r\nconsumption of work.\r\n\r\nWe are indeed confronted with the curious fact that even so-called\r\nintelligent people can be led to believe that what we have learned in\r\nregard to the working of Nature may be thrown aside, and that some\r\nnew and unrelated laws may rule supreme. Thus we have what is called\r\nChristian Science, one of the intuitional sciences which may be said\r\nto add a new peril to matrimony. We find cultivated men believing that\r\na government can make money by pronouncing silver equal to gold. Thus\r\nthere are those who fondle their delusions and those who bank upon\r\ncredulity. Education seems to be ineffectual with some temperaments; on\r\nthe whole, however, it has a saving grace, and there are undoubtedly\r\na number in the community who would welcome a source of scientific\r\nauthority which might answer for them just as the Times does in\r\npolitical and economic questions to an Englishman. The American has\r\nespecial reason to fear scientific bubbles, for our patent laws make\r\nit comparatively easy for promoters to make a great show of vested\r\nrights. One method is to build an imposing plant, with powerful dynamos\r\nand with a multiplicity of electrical devices, and to capitalize for\r\nan enormous sum an expensive plant in sight with millions in patents\r\nof very little value. The proposed investor is taken to see the great\r\nplant; its magnitude appeals to his reverence for size, and his\r\npocketbook is soon at the service of the promoter. Another method is\r\nto select some scheme which is on the borderland between physics and\r\nchemistry, such as the electrolytic method of obtaining gold from\r\nsalt water. There is a minute quantity of gold in salt water, and\r\nthe chemist, thinking that electricity might afford an economical\r\nmethod of treating large quantities of water, is reticent in regard\r\nto such a scheme, while the electrician, ignorant of chemistry, is\r\nready to concede that the chemists may have found a cheap extractor,\r\nso the promoter can play the chemist against the electrician, and\r\nthere is no arbitrator in sight. The American is peculiarly in peril\r\nfrom the absence of a large body of men trained in technical science,\r\nsuch as exist in Germany. He also has been unduly excited, and his\r\ndesire for love of sudden wealth stimulated by phenomenal successes.\r\nThe commercial triumph of the telephone has led to a multitude of\r\nscientific bubbles, and has resulted, like the discovery of gold in the\r\nKlondike, in a rush into electrical schemes which have been held up to\r\na hungry crowd of victims as second only to the Bell telephone.\r\n\r\nWhile the telegraph and the telephone can prevent speculations like\r\nthe South Sea Bubble in a great measure, for such schemes were much\r\naided by a lack of a general dissemination of intelligence, and this\r\nlack is supplied by a quick interchange of knowledge, they bring their\r\nown peculiar peril, for they are examples of what profit may be reaped\r\nfrom discovery in the world of science. The commercial enterprises of\r\nthe world have been brought within reach of the many by the telegraph\r\nand telephone. They no longer belong to the few, while the successful\r\nworking of the field of science is still confined to a minority and the\r\ngeneral public; even the cultivated people are very ignorant of the\r\napproaches to the New El Dorado. No bogus land scheme or salted mining\r\nenterprise can be kept in existence to-day for a long period; but the\r\nKeeley motor, with its ethereal vibrations and its pseudo-molecular\r\nmotions, was limited in activity only by the life of the promoter.\r\nInstead of the alchemists we have the seekers after power, which costs\r\nnothing, and in the train of the honest inventor there are unscrupulous\r\npromoters ready to capitalize any remarkable new fact or discovery\r\nwhich attracts public attention.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the influence of the first Duchess of Marlborough\r\nin inducing her husband, the great duke, to sell out his shares in\r\nthe South Sea Bubble when they had risen to a high value because this\r\nexample of discrimination and prudence in a woman supports one in the\r\nbelief that all women are not prone to invest in women’s bank schemes,\r\nin Keeley motors, or in enterprises for “carrying on an undertaking\r\nof great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.” One of my friends\r\nrecently visited the office of a company which proposed to produce\r\npower without the expenditure of a due amount of energy, and found\r\namong those anxious to invest a woman who said that she had just\r\nreceived a dividend from the company for extracting gold from salt\r\nwater, and she was anxious to invest it in the new power company. The\r\ndividend was the result of a liquidation of the Gold from Sea Water\r\nCompany, and represented half of her original sum. She had come out of\r\none delusion with a loss of half of her property, and was now ready\r\nto enter another one with the remaining half. It was an old-fashioned\r\nnotion that women should be kept in ignorance of business, for business\r\nknowledge, it was thought, was the concern of the husbands. This notion\r\nprevails still in some quarters, and there may be some connection\r\nbetween the number of women in Christian Science temples and their lack\r\nof education in practical matters, or in what may be called the legal\r\nbusiness habit--a habit which weighs the probabilities of this and\r\nthat, and leads to ways of exact thinking.\r\n\r\nOne of the remedies for this proneness of women to invest in scientific\r\nbubbles, to invest money on faith, is the lack of exact training,\r\nwhich is not acquired by them either in private schools or colleges.\r\nThe classes of philosophy and psychology in women’s colleges are\r\ncrowded, while those in the exact sciences have only handfuls. This\r\nremark also applies to the students in men’s colleges, and we realize\r\nin this respect how closely college women imitate college men. They\r\nfollow the latter also in the habit of taking lecture courses, a custom\r\nwhich increases vagueness, inaccuracy of thought, and looseness of\r\nstatement. This choice of studies by the young women in their colleges\r\nis a serious question for mankind, in view of the speculative spirit\r\nwhich the feminine sex show toward scientific bubbles and schemes\r\nwhich promise an inordinate rate of interest; for the graduates of\r\nthese colleges will become teachers of youth, and if not teachers\r\nthey have an influence upon the coming citizen during his formative\r\nperiod. As teachers they will far outnumber men teachers, and they are\r\nfast coming into competition with men also in the routine of business\r\noffices and in certain positions in commercial houses. In these\r\nactivities they will need a balance of judgment, exactness of thought,\r\nand business habits. They should be given a sufficient knowledge of\r\nthe elements of physical science to know that power can not be created\r\nfrom nothing, and that the great mass of our knowledge of mechanics\r\nand of the relation of electricity to mechanics can not be overturned\r\nby any new discovery. Whatever is discovered must be related to what\r\nhas preceded it. This is a characteristic of a science, and this is\r\nwhat distinguishes it from a delusion--namely, the great body of\r\nrelated facts put upon a mechanical basis, so that any fact can be\r\nsubstantiated and any phenomenon repeated. When this latter test is\r\napplied to many of the isms of the day they fade into thin air, and\r\nyoung women need especially to be taught to apply such a test. It\r\nwould seem as if the present choice of study by women students tended\r\nto intensify vagueness of thought rather than to correct it, to keep\r\nthem in ignorance of business habits rather than to educate them in the\r\nbalance of judgment on economic questions.\r\n\r\nWomen are born speculators, and are peculiarly prone to invest money\r\nand heart in bubbles. Being the power behind the throne, they can\r\ncarry men into action, and it seems to me that especial attention\r\nshould be paid in women’s colleges to the studies that cultivate\r\naccurate thought and business methods. A certain amount of the study\r\nof scientific methods and a study of common law might take the place\r\nof the study of philosophy, psychology, and biology, certainly in the\r\nfirst years of a woman’s college course, for psychology and biology are\r\nstudies which demand long scientific training and maturity of thought.\r\nRecently I heard the following conversation at a bank in Cambridge.\r\nThe cashier was speaking with a young lady: “Miss ----, your friend has\r\noverdrawn her account three hundred dollars, and you say she has left\r\nCambridge.” “Yes, the trouble with Jane is she is too much educated.”\r\nA long residence in a university town makes one wary of educational\r\ntheories, but the proneness of women to invest in women’s banks and\r\nbogus trust companies certainly seems to need a corrective in a new\r\ncollege curriculum. Men can indulge in delusions and can recover\r\nmental balance, and perhaps their fortunes; but women are apt to\r\nbecome bankrupt permanently. Their experience in business delusions is\r\nsimilar to that in affairs of the heart. Washington Irving says of this\r\nfeminine attribute:\r\n\r\n“She sends forth her sympathies on adventure; she embarks her whole\r\nsoul in the traffic of affection, and if shipwrecked her case is\r\nhopeless, for it is a bankruptcy of the heart.”\r\n\r\nMore mathematics and science, and less philosophy and psychology, might\r\ncorrect that vagueness of thought which leads both men and women into\r\ndelusion.\r\n\r\nNow for our other remedies. Shall we have an academy which shall issue\r\nstorm warnings of scientific bubbles? I fear that the influence of\r\nacademies is waning, and that the conviction that there are as many\r\ngood men outside of the academy as inside would militate against their\r\ndicta. We could have courts of scientific appeal, with judges appointed\r\nby the State to sit on scientific questions of perplexity, and to\r\nsift expert opinions. Such a constitution of scientific courts might\r\nbe a good thing in several ways--a saving health to the public. The\r\ncollege professor would certainly be greatly relieved of endeavors of\r\npromoters to use the name and reputation of the professor’s university,\r\nand incidentally the little his own name might add. This remedial\r\nsolution is not in sight, and we must direct our vision in another\r\ndirection. We know that the newspaper can not serve us, for we seek to\r\nkill sensations, and it seeks to live on them. We are bound to turn to\r\nsome journal or periodical which will publish only what it considers\r\nsound science and will eschew sensational science; a journal which,\r\njust as the London Times is regarded as the authority on political and\r\neconomical questions, will be looked up to as an authority on matters\r\nof science.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to protect the public against scientific bubbles\r\nwe must impress upon both men and women the fact that an education in\r\nscience is desirable, and is becoming more important as the world grows\r\nolder; but until a scientific education becomes more general, it is\r\nimportant that there should be some scientific oracle of Delphos, and\r\nI can not think of any better than a well-managed scientific journal,\r\nthe editors of which will seek for the best information on scientific\r\nquestions which interest the financial world. When it is known that\r\nsuch a journal admits to its pages nothing that is sensational, when it\r\nis realized that the best specialists contribute to it, surely it will\r\nbecome a saving help in times of trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT MAKES THE TROLLEY CAR GO.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM BAXTER, JR., C. E.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--The illustrations of railway generator and switchboard were\r\n    made from photographs kindly furnished by the Westinghouse Electric\r\n    and Manufacturing Company.\r\n\r\n    For the photographs of the electric truck and car controller we are\r\n    indebted to the courtesy of the General Electric Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIf the successful operation of a street-railway car by mechanical power\r\ndepended wholly upon the ability to produce a motor of sufficient\r\ncapacity to do the work, the problem would be an easy one to solve,\r\nand would have been solved long before the advent of the electric\r\nmotor. Mere ability to furnish the necessary power, however, is not\r\nenough to meet the requirements. As already shown, the mechanism\r\nmust be light, strong, compact, simple, and so well protected that\r\nit can not be injured except under abnormal conditions. In addition,\r\nspeed-controlling devices must be provided whereby the velocity may\r\nbe changed at will and in the shortest possible time, and with as\r\nnearly absolute precision as possible. This controlling mechanism must\r\nalso be so arranged that the direction of motion may be varied with\r\nthe greatest certainty and as rapidly as may at any time be required.\r\nThe way in which these results are accomplished in an electrically\r\noperated car can be understood from Figs. 18 and 19, which are line\r\ndrawings, in a simplified form, of an ordinary trolley car. Fig. 18\r\nis an elevation showing the outline of the car body and the wheels in\r\nbroken lines, while the motors and the wires through which the current\r\nis conveyed thereto are drawn in solid lines. Fig. 19 is a plan in\r\nwhich the outline of the car floor and the platforms is represented in\r\nbroken lines, the solid lines being the motors and connecting wires.\r\n\r\nIn almost every instance railway cars are provided with two motors, as\r\nshown at _M M_ in these two figures. This arrangement is adopted not\r\nbecause one motor can not furnish all the power required, but simply\r\nfor the purpose of making the equipment more reliable. Everything of\r\nhuman make is liable to fail; hence if only one motor were used there\r\nwould be more or less liability of its giving out at a critical moment,\r\nand then the car would be helpless. If two motors are provided, should\r\none give out the car would not be disabled, for the remaining machine\r\nwould be able to run it to its destination. In order that this result\r\nmay be successfully accomplished, each motor is made of sufficient\r\ncapacity to run the car without being overtaxed, unless the load is\r\nabnormally large; but even under the latter conditions the machine will\r\nin ninety-nine cases out of a hundred withstand the strain. Some roads,\r\nin small towns, where the traffic is light and the expense must be\r\nkept down to the lowest point, use single-motor cars, so as to effect\r\na saving in first cost. This course, however, is very seldom followed,\r\nexcept in places where there are no heavy grades or where there is\r\nvery little probability of the loads becoming excessive, except at\r\nrare intervals. If the cars are provided with a single motor, when one\r\nbecomes disabled from any cause it has to wait until overtaken by the\r\ncar behind it, so that it may be pushed by the latter to the end of the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nThe electric current for operating the motors is generated in a power\r\nhouse that is located at some convenient point along the route. The\r\ncurrent is conveyed to the moving cars by means of a trolley wire,\r\nwhich is marked _T_ in the drawings. Unless the road is very small and\r\noperates but a few cars, this wire will not be sufficient to carry all\r\nthe current, hence in most cases there are a number of supplementary\r\nwires, which are called feeders. These wires are carried along on\r\npoles, and at proper intervals are connected with the trolley wire _T_.\r\nThe electric current passes from the trolley wire through the motors\r\non the car, and thence to the rails _R_, and through these, and also\r\nthrough the ground, back to the power house. The exact path of the\r\ncurrent is as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 18, 19.--OUTLINE ELEVATION AND PLAN OF ELECTRIC\r\nRAILWAY CAR, SHOWING LOCATION OF MOTORS, CONTROLLING SWITCHES, AND\r\nCONNECTING WIRES.]\r\n\r\nFrom the trolley wire, through the trolley pole _t_, to the fixture\r\non top of the car which holds the latter. From this fixture, as shown\r\nby the heavy full line, the current passes to _a_, which is a switch\r\nlocated under the car hood overhanging the platform. From this switch\r\nthe current passes to a similar one, marked _b_, located in a like\r\nposition at the other end of the car. These two switches are called\r\nemergency switches; they are provided simply as a safety device,\r\nand are used only when the main switches get out of order and the\r\nmotorman can not turn the current off in the regular way. From the\r\nlast hood switch _b_ the current passes to the bottom of the car,\r\nwhere it enters the wire _d d_ at the point _c_. This wire _d d_, as\r\nwill be seen, runs in both directions, and ends in the stands _C C_.\r\nThese latter are the controlling switches, and are provided with a\r\nhandle _h_, by means of which the current is turned on or off from\r\nthe motors, and is directed through them in such a way as to make the\r\ncar run in whichever direction may be desired. From the controllers\r\n_C C_ several wires are run under the car, as shown at _e e e_. These\r\nwires are generally bunched into one or two cables, but they are kept\r\nseparate from each other by means of strong insulating coverings. Four\r\nwires lead into each motor, and three or four into each of the boxes\r\nmarked _G G_. If the motors were required to run in one direction\r\nonly, then two wires would be sufficient to convey the current to\r\nthem; but as they have to run in either direction, at least three\r\nwires are necessary, but in almost every case four are used, as the\r\nresults obtained thereby are more satisfactory. The boxes _G G_ are\r\ncalled rheostats, and are simply devices through which the current is\r\nrun so as to reduce the speed of the car, and also for the purpose of\r\ngraduating the strength of the current that passes through the motors\r\nin the act of starting. These rheostats are very seldom in use when the\r\ncar is in motion, because it is a waste of power to pass the current\r\nthrough them. After the current has passed through the motors it enters\r\nthe ironwork, and thus gets into the car wheels and finally to the\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\nThe lines drawn in Fig. 18 to indicate the position of the wires in the\r\ncar do not show their actual position, but only the general direction\r\nthey follow. From the trolley base to the first hood switch the wire,\r\nas a rule, is run along the car roof on one side of the ventilator,\r\nand the wire leading from the first to the second hood switch occupies\r\na corresponding position on the opposite side of the roof. From the\r\nlast hood switch, _b_, the wire is run down one corner of the car body,\r\nbeing either within the car body, or, if not, so covered by moldings as\r\nto not be reached by the hands of passengers. The wires _d_ and _e_ are\r\ngenerally run under the car, and are firmly secured to it by means of\r\nsuitable fastenings.\r\n\r\nThe controlling switches _C C_ are provided with one and sometimes two\r\nhandles, one of which is used to regulate the speed of the car and\r\nstop and start it, while the other is for the purpose of reversing\r\nthe direction in which it runs. The handle _h_ is for the purpose of\r\nregulating the speed, and by means of _k_ the direction of motion\r\nis changed. Before _h_ is moved from the inactive position _k_ is\r\nturned so that the car may run either forward or backward, as may be\r\ndesired; then, when _h_ is moved, the car will start, and by varying\r\nthe position of _h_ the speed can be changed. If it is desired to\r\nreverse the car, _h_ is brought back to the stop position, _k_ is\r\nshifted to the reverse motion, and then _h_ is again turned to the\r\nrunning position. When the controlling switch is provided with only one\r\nhandle this is turned in one direction to run the car ahead, and in\r\nthe opposite direction to run it backward, the graduations in velocity\r\nbeing obtained by placing the handle in positions intermediate between\r\nthe stop position and the highest speed position.\r\n\r\nAs will be noticed, the wire _d d_ branches at _c_ and runs in both\r\ndirections. Now, when the controller handles are both turned to the\r\nstop position the current from the trolley can get no farther than\r\nthe ends of _d_ in either switch, but if one of them is turned to\r\nthe running position, the current at once passes to the wires in the\r\ncable _e e e_, and thus to the two motors. If the switches _C C_ are\r\nin proper working order and there is no disarrangement of the wires\r\nleading to the motors or those within the latter, the current will obey\r\nthe movements of the handle _h_, but under other conditions it may not.\r\nIf such an emergency arises, the motorman reaches up to the hood and\r\nturns the safety switch _a_ or _b_, and thus cuts the current off.\r\n\r\nThe force with which the motors turn the car wheels around depends\r\nupon the strength of the current; this is owing to the fact that the\r\nmagnetic force is increased or decreased by variations in the current\r\nstrength. If the current is doubled the magnetic force of the armature\r\nis nearly doubled, and so is that of the field magnet, therefore the\r\npull between the poles is nearly four times as great. From this it\r\nwill be seen that the force with which the car is pushed ahead can be\r\nincreased enormously by a comparatively small increase in the strength\r\nof the current. If the current strength is doubled, the propelling\r\nforce is practically quadrupled; and if the current is increased four\r\ntimes, the propelling force is made nearly sixteen times as great.\r\n\r\nThe speed at which the car runs depends upon the force that impels the\r\ncurrent through the wire, and which is called electro-motive force.\r\nThe greater the electro-motive force, the higher the velocity. If the\r\ncurrent passes from the wires in the cable _e e e_ through each motor\r\nseparately, and thence to the rails _R_, each machine will receive\r\nthe effect of the whole electro-motive force of the current; but if\r\nafter the current has passed through one motor it is directed through\r\nthe other, then each machine will be acted upon by only one half the\r\nelectro-motive force, and, as can be seen at once, the velocity in the\r\nfirst instance will be twice as great as in the last. This fact is\r\ntaken advantage of in regulating the speed of the car, and controlling\r\nswitches arranged so as to direct the current through the motors in\r\nthis way are designated as belonging to the series parallel type,\r\nthe name being given from the fact that when the car is running slow,\r\nthe current passes through the two motors in series--that is, through\r\none after the other; but when the motors are running fast, a separate\r\ncurrent passes through each machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--VIEW OF ELECTRIC RAILWAY TRUCK WITH ONE MOTOR\r\nON EACH AXLE AND PROVIDED WITH MAGNETIC BRAKES.]\r\n\r\nIf, when a car is running, the controlling switch is turned to cut the\r\ncurrent off, the effect will be that the speed will gradually reduce;\r\nbut if it is desired to effect a sudden stop, it becomes necessary to\r\ncheck the headway by means of a brake. For this purpose the hand brake\r\nordinarily used on all types of cars is employed, but magnetic brakes\r\nare also used in some cases. Fig. 20 shows a car truck equipped with\r\ntwo motors and magnetic brakes, one on each axle. Looking at the front\r\nend of the truck, the brake is seen on the left side of the axle,\r\nbetween the motor bearing and the car wheel. The larger drum, on the\r\nright side, is the casing within which the gear wheel and pinion are\r\ninclosed. These magnetic brakes are operated by a current generated\r\nby the motors, and not by that of the main line. As was explained in\r\nthe first article, an electric motor can be made to act as a generator\r\nof electric current by simply reversing the direction in which the\r\narmature revolves. If we do not desire to reverse the direction of\r\nrotation, the result can still be attained by reversing the direction\r\nin which the current passes through the armature coils. It is evident\r\nthat the direction of a car motor can not be reversed at the instant\r\nthat it is desired to have it act as a generator--that is, when it\r\nis desired to put the brakes on; hence the direction of the current\r\nthrough the armature is reversed.\r\n\r\nWhen a car is provided with magnetic brakes, the controlling switches\r\nare so made that when the handle _h_ is moved back to the stop position\r\nit disconnects the motors from the trolley wire and at the same time\r\nconnects them with the magnetic brakes in such a manner that they\r\nwill act as generators and thus send current through the coils of the\r\nlatter. In order that the force with which the brakes are applied may\r\nbe graduated, the controlling switches are arranged so as to be moved\r\nseveral steps back of the point which in the ordinary type of switch\r\nwould be the final stop position. When the handle _h_ is placed on\r\nthe first brake position the current generated by the motors is not\r\nvery strong, and as a consequence the force of the brake is light, but\r\nsufficient to bring the car to a stop in a reasonable distance. If a\r\nquicker stop is desired the handle is moved to the second, third, or\r\nfourth brake position, thus increasing the retarding force as much as\r\nmay be desired. Magnetic brakes are very desirable, as they save the\r\ncar wheels, and furthermore afford an additional safety in cases where\r\nit is necessary to arrest the speed instantly.\r\n\r\nThe position of the motors with reference to the truck and car wheels\r\nis very well shown in Fig. 20, and also the manner in which they are\r\nheld in place. The covers of the openings through which access to the\r\ncommutator brushes is obtained are removed from both motors, and in\r\nthe forward one the top of the commutator and one of the brushes can\r\nbe readily seen. The manner in which the motors are suspended from the\r\ntruck is not the same in this figure as in those previously shown, but\r\nthis is simply because the machines are not made by the same concern,\r\nand each manufacturer has his own design.\r\n\r\nFig. 21 shows the appearance of the interior of the controlling\r\nswitches _C C_, Figs. 18 and 19. It will be noticed that there are two\r\nupright shafts, the ends of which project above the top of the box. The\r\nhandle _h_ is placed upon the shaft to the left, and _k_ on that to the\r\nright. The first is the main controller, and the other is the reversing\r\nswitch. It will be noticed that the main controller shaft carries a\r\nnumber of circular segments of different lengths; these are so disposed\r\nthat they come in contact with suitable stationary pieces as the handle\r\n_h_ is turned around, and thus vary the path of the current through the\r\nmotors and the rheostats in the manner required to effect the desired\r\nchanges in the velocity of the car. The reversing shaft is also\r\nprovided with a number of segments, but these are not so easily seen,\r\nalthough they can be discerned on close examination. The wires from the\r\ncable _e e e_ and also wire _d d_ are attached to the stationary pieces\r\nwith which the segments carried by the two shafts make contact when\r\nthe latter are moved around by the motorman. These wires can be seen\r\nback of the main switch shaft, and also above the board located at the\r\nlower left-hand corner. All these wires enter the controller through an\r\nopening in the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--VIEW OF INTERIOR OF CAR CONTROLLER.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the apparatus shown in Figs. 18 to 21, electric cars\r\nare provided with a safety fuse and a lightning arrester, the object\r\nof the latter being to protect the motors from the destructive effects\r\nof lightning strokes. The object of the safety fuse is to protect the\r\nmotor from injury when the current becomes too strong. An electric\r\ncurrent in passing through a wire generates heat, and the stronger the\r\ncurrent the greater the heat. If the wire is large and the current\r\nweak, the heat developed may be insufficient to raise the temperature\r\nto a noticeable degree; but, on the other hand, if the wire is small\r\nor the current very strong, the heat generated may be capable of\r\nraising the temperature of the metal to the fusing point. In fact, the\r\nincandescent lamp operates upon this principle; the carbon filament\r\nis traversed by a current of a strength sufficient to heat it to a\r\npoint where it becomes intensely luminous, and sometimes, through\r\naccident or otherwise, the current becomes strong enough to melt the\r\nfilament, and then the light goes out. In an electric motor it is not\r\nnecessary to raise the temperature of the wire to the melting point to\r\ndo serious injury; in fact, if the heat is sufficient to char paper or\r\ncloth, the machine will be rendered useless until suitable repairs are\r\nmade. The insulation of the wire coils is made principally of cotton,\r\nwhich is a very good electrical insulator in its natural state, but\r\nwhen carbonized by excessive heat it becomes a conductor. As soon as\r\nit becomes a conductor the current is no longer confined to the proper\r\nchannel, but cuts through the insulation to find the shortest path\r\nthrough the machine. If safety fuses were not provided the danger of\r\ndestroying the insulation of the motors and thus disabling the car\r\nwould be decidedly great, for, as already said, the motors can not be\r\nstalled with an overload, the only effect produced being a reduction in\r\nthe speed and an increase in current strength. Now, if there were no\r\nway of limiting the increase in current strength the motors, if greatly\r\noverloaded, would continue to operate until the insulation gave out.\r\nThe safety fuse is simply a piece of wire of such size that it will be\r\nmelted by a current that the motors can carry without being injured;\r\nhence when the current strength reaches a point where the safety of the\r\napparatus is endangered the fuse melts and thus breaks the circuit and\r\nstops the further flow of current. Fuses are generally made of an alloy\r\nthat melts at a low temperature, so that the molten metal may not set\r\nfire to anything upon which it may fall. These easily fused alloys are\r\ninferior to copper as electrical conductors, and on this account the\r\nfuse wire is as a rule much larger than that wound upon the motors,\r\nwhich fact makes its action somewhat mysterious to the uninitiated;\r\nbut whatever its size may be, it is so proportioned that it will melt\r\nbefore the current rises to a strength that would injure the motor\r\ncoils.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the electric current generated in the power house\r\nreaches the motors is illustrated in Fig. 22. In this figure four\r\ntracks are shown, which may be taken to represent roads running in\r\nas many different directions. The three squares at the left side\r\nrepresent generators located in the power house. The circles _a a a_\r\nrepresent switches, by means of which the generators are connected\r\nor disconnected from the trolley lines. _A_ and _B_ represent heavy\r\nmetallic rods, generally made of copper, with which the generators are\r\nconnected by means of the switches _a a a_. These rods are called bus\r\nbars. The circles _b b b b_ represent switches by means of which the\r\ncurrent is turned on or off from the several tracks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING THE MANNER IN WHICH THE\r\nELECTRIC CURRENT FLOWS FROM THE GENERATORS TO THE CARS UPON THE TRACKS.]\r\n\r\nElectric currents must always circulate in closed paths--that is, the\r\ncurrent that starts out from a generator must return to it, and the\r\namount coming back is the same as that which leaves. The action of\r\nan electric generator can be understood by comparing it with that of\r\na water pump pumping into a pipe which runs around from the delivery\r\nend to the suction. With such an arrangement it can be seen that the\r\naction of the pump would be to keep the water in circulation, but\r\nthe same water would be pumped through the pump and the pipe all the\r\ntime. With an electric generator the action is the same, and in Fig.\r\n22 the current flowing along any one of the tracks follows the course\r\nindicated by the arrows. The currents pass out to the several tracks\r\nthrough the trolley wires _T T T T_, and return through the tracks\r\n_R R R R_. The bus bar _A_ is connected with a plate _D_, which is\r\nimbedded in the ground, and is also connected with the ends of the\r\nrails _R R R R_. Suppose for a moment that the two lower generators are\r\nout of service, their switches _a a_ being turned so as to disconnect\r\nthem from the bus _A_, and, further, suppose that the three lower _b_\r\nswitches are open, so that the current can only pass to the upper\r\ntrack; then the top generator will feed into the top road only. Tracing\r\nthe path of the current under these conditions, we find that it will\r\nstart from the upper side of the generator through the _a_ switch to\r\nthe _B_ bus, and thence to the trolley wire at the top of the figure.\r\nOn reaching the first car a portion of the current passes to the track\r\n_R_, the amount being dependent upon the speed of the car and the load.\r\nWhy the whole current does not follow this path generally puzzles the\r\nlayman, but the explanation is that the motors hold the current back,\r\nand only allow as much to pass through them as is necessary to perform\r\nthe required work--that is to say, the current flowing through each\r\ncar is not controlled by the generator or by the force of the current,\r\nbut by the requirements of the motors. The amount of current delivered\r\nby the generator is governed by the demands of the motors. The current\r\nthat does not pass through the first car goes on to the second one,\r\nand if there were more cars there would be current left in the trolley\r\nwire to supply them. After passing through the motors of the two cars\r\nthe current returns through the rails _R_ to the plate _D_, and thus\r\nto bus _A_, from which it enters the lower side of the top generator.\r\nIt will from this explanation be seen that the action of the generator\r\nis simply to keep the current circulating. If two of the generators\r\nare connected with the bus bars _A_ and _B_, the current required by\r\nthe motors will be delivered by the two machines, and if the three\r\ngenerators are placed in service the current will be divided among them.\r\n\r\nWhen two or more generators are used, it is necessary to provide\r\nmeans to prevent the current from dividing unequally between them;\r\nif this were not done, one machine might do nearly all the work,\r\nwhile the other one would be practically idle. The means employed to\r\naccomplish the result is simply an additional bus bar, which is called\r\nan equalizing bus. We will not undertake to explain the principle upon\r\nwhich this arrangement acts; it is sufficient to say that by such means\r\nthe work can be distributed in amounts directly proportional to the\r\ncapacity of the generators, so that if one machine is very much larger\r\nthan the others it will take a portion of the load corresponding to\r\nits size. In order that these results may be attained it is necessary\r\nto properly adjust the several generators, and as no machine can be\r\nmade to work with the accuracy of perfection, the work will not be\r\ndistributed in true proportion for all conditions of load; thus if the\r\ngenerators are adjusted so as to each take its proper share when all\r\nthe cars are in operation, one machine may do too much or not enough\r\nwhen only one half the number are running, but the excess or deficiency\r\nwill not be more than a few per cent unless the adjustment is very\r\ndefective.\r\n\r\nElectric generators for railway work are made in all sizes, from those\r\nonly large enough to operate four or five cars to others capable of\r\nfurnishing sufficient current for thirty or forty or even more. Small\r\ngenerators are made so as to be driven by a belt running over a pulley\r\nmounted on the end of the armature shaft, or they may be arranged\r\nto be connected to the end of a steam-engine shaft, and thus become\r\nwhat is called direct connected machines. Large generators are almost\r\ninvariably of the latter type. A machine of this class is illustrated\r\nin Fig. 23. The driving engine is shown at _E_, the cylinder being\r\nin the background and the crank toward the front, the shaft being\r\nclearly seen at _S_, while _F_ is the fly wheel. The generator is\r\nmounted directly upon the engine shaft, between the bearing at the\r\ncrank end and the fly wheel. The large ring marked _G_ is the field\r\nmagnet ring, and at _D D D_ the field coils are shown. These coils\r\nare equally spaced all the way around the circle. The commutator is\r\nmarked _C_, and the commutator brushes are located at _B B_. The\r\narmature can not be seen very well, as it is covered by the brush\r\nholders and their supporting frames, but it is located within the\r\nring _G_ in the position designated by _A_. This machine is one of\r\na number used to operate the roads of Troy, N. Y., and is of about\r\none-thousand-horsepower capacity, which is enough to furnish all the\r\ncurrent required to run sixty or seventy cars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--LARGE-SIZE DIRECT CONNECTED ELECTRIC RAILWAY\r\nGENERATOR.]\r\n\r\nThe switches _a a_ and _b b_, shown in Fig. 22, and the bus bars _A\r\nB_, are mounted upon a large panel, made of marble or slate, called a\r\nswitch board. These switches are sufficient for the purpose of turning\r\nthe current on or off any track or for connecting and disconnecting\r\nthe generators, but for the successful operation of the plant it is\r\nnecessary to have other devices by means of which the strength of\r\nthe current may be ascertained, and also the electro-motive force.\r\nIt is necessary to provide each generator with means for varying the\r\nelectro-motive force of the current it generates, otherwise the load\r\ncould not be properly equalized between the several machines. All these\r\ndifferent devices are located upon the switch board, so as to have\r\nthem in an accessible position. A railway switch board, arranged for\r\nfour generators and a large number of distributing circuits, is shown\r\nin Fig. 24. The four generator switches are shown at _a a a a_, and\r\nthe circles marked _R_, directly under them, are the devices by means\r\nof which the electro-motive force of the current is regulated. These\r\ndevices are called field regulators, from the fact that their office\r\nis to regulate the strength of the field magnets of the generators,\r\nmaking them stronger to increase the electro-motive force and weaker\r\nto reduce it. The part seen upon the front of the switch board is not\r\nthe regulator proper, but only the handle and the contact points over\r\nwhich this swings. The instruments marked _A A A A_ are for measuring\r\nthe strength of the current of each individual generator, and are\r\ncalled ammeters. The instruments marked _V V V V_ are for the purpose\r\nof indicating the electro-motive force of the currents of the several\r\ngenerators, and are called voltmeters. _Ag_ is an ammeter used to\r\nmeasure the strength of the total current, and _Vg_ is a voltmeter that\r\nindicates the electro-motive force of the current passing out to the\r\ncars on the various lines. The ammeter _Ag_ is not an actual necessity,\r\nfor the strength of the total current can be ascertained by adding the\r\nreadings of the four instruments connected with the generators, but it\r\nis a convenience, as it saves the trouble of performing the addition.\r\nThe voltmeter _Vg_, however, can not be regarded in this light; in\r\nfact, its presence is decidedly serviceable, for it indicates the\r\naverage electro-motive force of all the generators; therefore if any\r\none of the instruments _V V V V_ is higher or lower it shows at once\r\nthat the generator to which it is attached is out of adjustment and not\r\ndoing its proper share of the work. The switches _b b b_, by means of\r\nwhich the current is turned on to the several external circuits, are\r\nshown at the extreme end of the switch board.\r\n\r\nThe instrument marked _W_, located between the _a_ switches, is\r\ncalled a wattmeter, and its office is to indicate the amount of power\r\nfurnished by the generators. This instrument is not always used, as\r\nit is a convenience but not a necessity. It can be seen at once that\r\nwhether it is used or not, the amount of power required to operate\r\nthe roads will be the same, but it is thought by most railroad\r\nmanagers that it is desirable, for then the relation between the coal\r\nconsumed and the power developed can be seen; and if the showing is\r\nnot as good as it should be, the engineer can remind the firemen that\r\nthey are not exercising as much care in feeding the boilers as they\r\nshould. Considered in this light, the watt-meter acts as a check to\r\nwastefulness on the part of the employees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--ELECTRIC RAILWAY SWITCHBOARD.]\r\n\r\nThe instruments marked _C C C C_ serve the same purpose in connection\r\nwith the generators as the safety fuses do with respect to the car\r\nmotors; they are electro-magnetic devices used to open the generator\r\ncircuits whenever the current reaches a strength that is sufficient\r\nto injure the machine. These devices are called circuit breakers.\r\nAs will be noticed, there are four located directly above the four\r\n_a_ switches, and, at the farther end of the board, a large number\r\nlocated directly above the _b_ switches. The latter act to open the\r\nindividual circuits when the currents flowing in them become too\r\nstrong, and the former are controlled entirely by the current of the\r\ngenerator circuits. A circuit breaker is more reliable than a safety\r\nfuse, because it acts quicker. With the fuse the current must act for\r\nsome time before it can melt the metal, as a sufficient amount of heat\r\ncan not be generated instantly. With the circuit breaker, however,\r\nthe action is instantaneous, for as soon as the current reaches the\r\npredetermined strength the magnetism of the operative parts of the\r\ndevice becomes sufficiently strong to cause it to act. A circuit\r\nbreaker is simply a switch that is arranged to be opened automatically\r\nby the action of a magnet, instead of by the hand of the operator. The\r\nswitch part of the apparatus is held in place by a catch that is set\r\nmuch after the fashion of the catch in a mouse trap--that is, so that\r\nthe least pressure will disengage it. A strong spring acts to throw\r\nthe switch open, and as soon as the catch is tripped by the actuating\r\nmagnet the force of the spring comes into action and the circuit is\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nThe circuit breaker is a very valuable apparatus, for it frequently\r\nhappens that, through delays of one kind or another, a large number of\r\ncars concentrate at one point on the road, and, as all the motormen\r\nare anxious to make headway, they all start up at once at the first\r\nopportunity. If there were no circuit breakers at the power house the\r\nresult would be that some of the generators would be greatly overloaded\r\nand perhaps disabled; but, owing to the presence of the circuit\r\nbreakers, the actual result is that the circuit is broken, and then\r\nthe motormen have to wait until the current is turned on again. If too\r\nmany of them try to start their cars at the second trial the current\r\nwill again stop. After two or three ineffectual efforts have been made\r\nto start all the cars together the motormen will conclude to go easy,\r\nand set a few in motion at a time. In this way the cars will become\r\nmore evenly distributed along the line, and the demand for current at\r\nthe point of blockade will reduce to the normal amount, or nearly so,\r\nand the running of the cars will continue without further interruption,\r\nfor the current drawn by the motors having been reduced to the average\r\namount, the circuit breaker will cease to act.\r\n\r\nThe bus bars and all the connections between them and the generators\r\nand external circuits, as well as with all the instruments, are located\r\nbehind the switch board. All these connections are so secured that\r\nthey can not come in contact with each other except where contacts\r\nare required; care is also taken to prevent any connection being made\r\nwith the iron framing that supports the marble slabs. The front of a\r\nswitch board is generally very attractive, the surface being of highly\r\npolished marble, while all the switches and instruments are finely\r\nfinished and, as a rule, of decidedly ornamental design.\r\n\r\nThe switch board might be looked upon as the fountain head from which\r\nthe entire operation of an electric railway system is controlled. By\r\nthe movement of one set of switches upon it the generators are thrown\r\nin or out of service, and by the movement of another set of switches\r\nthe several branches of the road are rendered active or inactive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIS THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION DECLINING?\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. CHARLES AUGUSTUS BRIGGS, D. D.,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF BIBLICAL THEOLOGY, UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question whether the Christian religion is declining is agitating\r\nthe public mind in some measure at the present time. This is due to\r\nthe many changes that are taking place in the forms of religion, the\r\ntypes of doctrine, and the methods of action in the numerous religious\r\norganizations which bear the name of Jesus Christ. Are these changes\r\nsymptoms of disease and decay in the Christian religion, or are they\r\nevidences of renewed vitality and enlargement by growth? It is quite\r\nevident that many things which have been regarded as important and even\r\nessential in the past have declined in importance, and some of them\r\nseem to be on the eve of disappearing altogether. It is not surprising\r\nthat those who have been trained to regard these as essential to\r\nChristianity should think that the Christian religion is declining\r\nwith them. If, however, these things are not so important as has\r\nbeen supposed, but have gained for a time an exaggerated importance,\r\nthen their decline to their normal position and the advance of other\r\nthings to their rightful place, as more important things than has\r\nhitherto been supposed--all this is evidence of a healthful advance in\r\nChristianity. This question, therefore, will be answered in accordance\r\nwith the point of view of the one who considers it. If it is to be\r\nanswered correctly we must put aside all prejudice, and examine the\r\nwhole situation candidly and with a critical scientific spirit. It\r\nis impracticable within the bounds of this article to examine this\r\nquestion on all sides. We can only make a few suggestions relating to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary at the outset to approach the question aright. We\r\nmust distinguish between what is essential to the Christian religion\r\nand what is non-essential. This is not so easy a task as one might\r\nimagine. We can only make this distinction generally, and not with\r\nscientific precision. In the study of religions we have to distinguish\r\n(1) the more fundamental things in the historical institutions and\r\nexperience in life; (2) the doctrines which express the popular belief\r\nor scientific knowledge of the adherents of the religion; and (3) the\r\nexpression of the religion in ethical principles and moral conduct.\r\nThe order of development is always life, doctrine, morals. The earlier\r\nstages of the Christian religion and of Christian experience at any\r\ntime and in any community is the vital experience and the institutional\r\norganization. Doctrines of faith and knowledge presuppose the vital\r\nrelation, and morals presuppose both, and conduct is the final aim\r\nand crown of the whole development. And yet there are some scholars\r\nwho exaggerate the relative importance of each one of the three in its\r\nrelation to the other two and to the whole.\r\n\r\nIn our age greater attention is given to Christian ethics and sociology\r\nthan ever before. A man who has the ethical enthusiasm of our times\r\nis inclined to criticise historical Christianity with great severity,\r\nbecause of its failure to realize the highest ethical ideals, and\r\nespecially those presented by Jesus in his teaching and his example.\r\nHistorical Christianity is so far below these ideals, even in its\r\nbest types, that one is inclined to say if the Church has failed so\r\nbadly in nineteen centuries, what prospect has it in the present or\r\nthe future? Some good men in our times are disgruntled with historical\r\nChristianity for its ethical failures, and keep aloof from the Church\r\non that account; but these are after all proportionately few, and they\r\nare unreasonable, for they exaggerate the ethical phase of Christianity\r\nover against the doctrinal and the vital; they fail to see what is\r\nnecessarily involved in the development of the Christian religion,\r\nthat the ethical age should come last of all; and they also are not\r\njust in their estimate of Christian history, for, notwithstanding the\r\nfailure of the Church, there has been a wonderful and steady ethical\r\nadvance through the centuries. Indeed, it is Christianity itself which\r\nis chiefly responsible for the ethical enthusiasm of the present time,\r\nand this is an evidence that Christianity is about to enter upon the\r\nlast and highest stage of its development. Holy love in principle and\r\npractice in the liberty of self-sacrifice is better understood in the\r\nChurch to-day than ever before, and it is becoming more influential\r\nin the Church and in the world. The Church is about to put forth the\r\nsupreme ethical influence of holy love to transform society and the\r\nlives of men.\r\n\r\nIn large sections of the Church the greatest stress is still laid\r\nupon Christian doctrine, especially as expressed in dogmatic forms.\r\nIf a man thinks that orthodox doctrine is the test of a healthful\r\nand vigorous church, he will make that the determining element in\r\nhis judgment whether Christianity is advancing or declining. In this\r\nsphere we have to distinguish three things: (1) The popular orthodoxy,\r\nwhich is determined by the consensus of teaching from the pulpit; (2)\r\nthe scholarly orthodoxy, which is determined by the teaching of the\r\ntheologian from the chairs of the theological schools and in text-books\r\nof dogmatic theology; (3) the official orthodoxy, which is determined\r\nby creeds, liturgies, confessions of faith, and canons of the Church.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that there has been a great overturning of dogma\r\nin our times, and it is altogether probable that this will assume\r\nmuch greater dimensions. Many think that dogma has had an exaggerated\r\nimportance in the past, and, from their point of view, the Christian\r\nreligion has made an advance by pushing dogma back to a less dominant\r\nposition. Those who maintain that dogma is of supreme importance\r\nnaturally think that the Christian religion declines when dogma is\r\ndiscredited in the Christian community. There can be little doubt that\r\na large number of men absent themselves from church attendance because\r\nthey dislike the popular orthodoxy, which seems to them antiquated,\r\nunscientific, and untrue. Many refuse to unite with religious\r\norganizations which are dominated by an orthodoxy representing the\r\ntheories of scholastic theology. Many remain apart from the churches\r\nbecause they are unwilling to be responsible in any way for their\r\nofficial orthodoxy. Many, born and trained in Presbyterian families,\r\nrefuse to remain in an organization which is responsible for the hard\r\ndoctrines set forth in the Westminster Confession. Many Methodists\r\nrefuse to be compromised by Wesley’s doctrines and Wesley’s rules of\r\nlife. Many refuse to remain Baptists because of what is involved in\r\nclose communion. Many refuse to be Episcopalians because they resent\r\nthe doctrines and practices of sacerdotalism. And so we could find,\r\nmore or less in all religious communions, a dissatisfaction with\r\ndogmas--sometimes superficial, giving a plausible excuse for absence,\r\nsometimes profound, inciting active hostility to the Church. If all of\r\nthese dissatisfied ones are to be regarded as hostile or indifferent\r\nto Christianity, then it is evident that an army of Christians have\r\npractically separated themselves from the Church in our time, and we\r\nmust say that Christianity has in this respect declined. If, on the\r\nother hand, we think that these dissatisfied and disgruntled ones are\r\nyet Christians, and that they are maintaining their faith in Christ\r\nin opposition to an unreasonable church, that they are exerting an\r\nimportant influence in the transformation of the dogmas of the Church,\r\nthen we may say that this is an evidence that Christianity is in a\r\nstate of transition, that it is on the move away from an untenable\r\nposition of exaggerated dogma to a truer and stronger position,\r\nin which dogma will be transformed and given its normal place and\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe effort to throw off the bondage of the popular and the scholastic\r\ndogma is an advance, and not a decline; it is an advance into the realm\r\nof freedom. It first gives the possibility of a critical re-examination\r\nof the dogmatic faith of the Church. Only by the application of the\r\nscientific methods of our age to dogma is it possible for our age to\r\nverify dogma and accept it as valid and reliable. We can not rely on\r\nanything that is merely traditional or the product of the logical\r\nanalysis of premises which remain themselves unverified. The revolt\r\nagainst the confessional orthodoxy, especially in the Presbyterian,\r\nReformed, and Lutheran Churches, is not a sign of decline, as some\r\nthink, but a wholesome movement which indicates a determination to know\r\nthe truth and to hold nothing but the truth.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago-Lambeth articles, adopted by the whole Anglican communion\r\nthroughout the world, reduces the essential doctrines of Christ’s\r\nChurch to the Nicene Creed and the Apostles’ Creed; those creeds in\r\nwhich all the great historical churches, the Greek and the Oriental,\r\nthe Roman and the Protestant, agree. This marks a dogmatic advance,\r\nnot a dogmatic decline, because it makes the distinction between the\r\nessential and unessential doctrines, it defines essential doctrines by\r\nholding up ancient fundamental historical creeds; it thereby represents\r\nall other matters as within the realm of the unessential doctrines, the\r\nprovince of Christian liberty.\r\n\r\nThe churches are therefore readjusting themselves in their relation\r\nto Christian doctrine, and the Christian community is readjusting\r\nitself likewise. The offensive features of Christian dogma, while still\r\nretained and advocated by some theologians and some communions, have\r\nbeen in great measure removed by other theologians and communions, and\r\nthe process is going on with great rapidity. The war against science,\r\ncriticism, literature, and art--all that is characteristic of our\r\nage--is gradually being limited to a smaller number of theologians and\r\ndenominations, and there is ever an increasing number of theologians\r\nand churches which fully recognize all the achievements of modern times\r\nand who are at work in harmonizing them with the verified Christian\r\ndogmas in a larger, grander system--in a new theology representing\r\nall that is noblest and best in Christianity as applied to the modern\r\nworld. While this process is going on, the dissatisfied ones will\r\ntake some little time to find their new church homes and to adjust\r\nthemselves to new conditions and circumstances.\r\n\r\nSo far as the great mass of mankind is concerned, the chief factor\r\nin the Christian religion is the fundamental one of the Christian\r\nlife and the Christian institution, and the advance or decline of\r\nChristianity will be judged from this point of view. Here, however, we\r\nmust recognize that there are several types of religious life which\r\nsometimes combine in one community, but which ordinarily exist apart as\r\ncharacteristic of different temperaments, different nations, different\r\nraces. The lines of cleavage in historical Christianity are for the\r\nmost part racial, national, or temperamental. We have to take this\r\ninto account when we consider the religious life and institutions\r\nof different countries. What a difference there is in religion from\r\nthis point of view in the great centers, such as Rome, St. Petersburg,\r\nBerlin, London, Edinburgh, New York! That man would go far astray who\r\nshould undertake to use any one of these as a test of any or of all the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nLet us consider, for example, the question of participation in the\r\nservices of the Church. Rome has apparently, from a Protestant point\r\nof view, an abnormal number of churches, and in these churches an\r\nextraordinary number of chapels and altars. The reason for this is\r\nthat there is an immense number of clergy in Rome, and all these\r\naltars are needed that they may perform the most important of their\r\nduties--the sacrifice of the mass. The churches, chapels, and altars\r\nare not erected for the people merely--if so, vastly fewer would be\r\nnecessary--but for the priests who sacrifice for the people even when\r\nthey are absent. Berlin has apparently very few churches, and these\r\nare not always well attended by the people, and are used infrequently\r\nexcept on Sundays. Judging from this, it would be a very irreligious\r\ncity; but any one who really knows Berlin would not say that it is\r\nless religious than Rome. The religion of the German people finds its\r\nexpression in a mystic type of personal piety and of family and social\r\nlife; it maintains and propagates itself without frequent attendance\r\nupon public worship.\r\n\r\nIn London regular attendance upon public worship is commonly regarded\r\nas indispensable for the maintenance of the Christian religion.\r\nTherefore Christian people frequent the churches to an extent that is\r\nunknown on the continent of Europe. But to make the British habit of\r\nfrequenting the Church for public worship a test of the vitality of\r\nthe Christian religion in the great cities of the Continent would be\r\naltogether unjust and untrue. The historical development of religion\r\nin Great Britain has brought about an entirely different state of\r\naffairs there from that which we find everywhere else in the world.\r\nThe situation in Great Britain is therefore special, peculiar, and,\r\none might say, abnormal as compared with the situation in other\r\nparts of the world. In the United States the original population was\r\nchiefly British, and therefore followed British methods in religion.\r\nBut in the present century our land, and especially our cities, have\r\nfilled up with a population from the continent of Europe, bringing\r\nwith them Continental methods of worship which would not yield to or\r\nreadily adopt British methods. Intermarriage with the British stock\r\nand familiar converse in society have tended to assimilation, and\r\ntherefore the situation has gradually and inevitably emerged that\r\nthe Christianity of New York and Chicago and our other great cities\r\nhas assumed an intermediate position between that of the Continent\r\nand that of Great Britain. The religious customs characteristic of\r\nBritish Christianity have undoubtedly declined--they have yielded to\r\nthe influence of Continental Christianity. If British Christianity\r\nis the norm by which we are to judge, then Christianity has declined\r\nin the United States. If, however, it is not the norm, then it might\r\nappear that an intermediate position, such as we have attained by\r\nthe assimilation of the British and the Continental types, may be a\r\nreal advance and gain, because of the appropriation of some of the\r\nbest features of both methods and the rubbing off of some of the\r\neccentricities and excrescences of both. A decline in the relative\r\nattendance upon the public worship, and especially upon the second\r\nservice on Sunday, is exactly what we would anticipate under the\r\ncircumstances. It is altogether probable that the decline is much\r\nless than we had the right to expect in view of the vast influence\r\nexerted upon us by Continental types of Christianity during the past\r\nhalf century. And it is altogether probable that the decline has not\r\nreached its normal goal. Especially is this the case when we take into\r\nconsideration other influences which tend to diminish the attendance\r\nupon public worship.\r\n\r\n1. In Great Britain, where the churches were established by law,\r\nthe state and Church were so entwined that it was a badge of good\r\ncitizenship to attend upon public worship. In antithesis with this,\r\nattendance of the nonconformists upon public worship was regarded as a\r\nstanding by their principles and a test of fidelity and courage. These\r\ninfluences worked also in the United States during the colonial period;\r\nbut during the present century this motive has lost its influence,\r\nand it is to be feared that politicians as such feel under no special\r\nobligation to attend church, especially in view of the attitude of many\r\nof the ministry as to political life and political questions.\r\n\r\n2. In Great Britain it has been a badge of social propriety to attend\r\npublic worship. Social influences still prevail greatly in the United\r\nStates, in villages and small cities, and even to some extent in the\r\nchurches in the great cities, where they are organized and conducted\r\nin social lines as social religious clubs. But this influence is much\r\nweaker than it used to be, and it is gradually passing away.\r\n\r\n3. The pulpit was once the chief means of instruction and of\r\nintellectual and moral stimulation for the people. The preacher was the\r\npeople’s orator. The pulpit has in great measure lost its attractive\r\npower in this regard. The daily and weekly press have a greater\r\ninfluence in public instruction. The multiplication of cheap books\r\nalso takes from the preacher a large share of his influence in this\r\nregard. Oratory in legislative bodies has to a great extent lost its\r\ninfluence. Its place has been taken by simple, compact, time-saving\r\nstatements, often printed but not delivered. Committees do the work\r\nwhich used to be done after discussion before the public. So the people\r\nwill not listen now to the pulpit orator of former generations. They\r\ndemand short, crisp sermons that bristle with points, and are practical\r\nand helpful. In other words, the oratorical and highly intellectual\r\ncharacter of the pulpit which used to attract worshipers no longer\r\nattracts them. They feel that they can get more benefit in this regard\r\nby reading in the comfort of the home. Multitudes of people can no\r\nlonger be induced to attend church to be instructed by the minister\r\nor to get his judgment on topics of the time, or to be stirred by his\r\neloquence; they can get all these things cheaper and easier by reading\r\nat home. When, now, this is re-enforced by the fact that multitudes\r\ndislike the doctrines of the Church, and resent them when they are\r\npreached, we can easily understand that church attendance should\r\ndecline very greatly from this reason.\r\n\r\nBut this is no evidence that the Christian religion has declined. If\r\nmen absent themselves from public worship because it is no longer\r\nnecessary for them, as good citizens and as respectable members of\r\nsociety, to attend, or because they may get their instruction and\r\nstimulation elsewhere easier and with less expenditure of time and\r\nmoney, that is simply an evidence that attendance upon church in the\r\npast has been due in great measure to other than religious reasons, and\r\nthat, these no longer holding, attendance has disappeared with them.\r\nThe attendance upon public worship, though reduced so far as number\r\nis concerned, is now more simply and purely for religious reasons,\r\nand therefore minister and people may with greater freedom make the\r\nservices more distinctly religious.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed the real situation that has emerged. The sermon\r\nhas declined relatively in importance, and rightly so. It had an\r\nexaggerated importance in the Protestant Church, especially in the\r\nnon-liturgical churches. There is a world-wide tendency now, which\r\nis increasing in power, to improve and enlarge the worship of the\r\nChurch. Liturgies and ceremonies of worship are more discussed now\r\nin the Protestant world than are sermons and lectures, because it is\r\nbecoming every day more evident that the Church is organized for common\r\nprayer and for public worship, and not merely to furnish a pulpit for\r\na minister. The pulpit is more and more being merged in the worship,\r\nand is losing its domination over the worship. With this tendency\r\ngoes increased attention to the Holy Sacraments, especially the Holy\r\nCommunion, more frequent celebrations and more frequent participation,\r\nincreased opportunity of worship during Sunday and during the week,\r\nand also therewith the greatly increased attention to the organization\r\nof the Church for aggressive Christian work. Those who think that the\r\npulpit is everything in the public service naturally suppose that with\r\nthe decline of the pulpit Christianity declines, but those who think\r\nthat public worship is the essential thing in the Church rejoice at the\r\nchanges that are taking place, and hold that Christianity is advancing.\r\nThey maintain that it is not so important for the Church to gather\r\nlarge crowds to listen to the sermon as it is for the church doors to\r\nbe ever open, with frequent services for the convenience and help of\r\nworshipers at any time, without regard to whether they are few or many,\r\nassured that thereby a much greater number of people are reached and\r\nbenefited than by the former limited methods.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that biblical criticism has undermined faith\r\nin Holy Scripture, and that, therefore, many absent themselves from\r\npublic worship. But there is no real evidence for it. I doubt not\r\nthat the opponents of biblical criticism drive many people from their\r\ncongregations, just as they do when they attack the sure results\r\nof modern science, or expose their ignorance in the discussion of\r\npolitical and economical questions in which they have not been trained;\r\nbut these people simply remove to other congregations where they will\r\nnot be offended by obscurantism and intolerance. Biblical criticism\r\nreally makes the Bible more attractive to the people, and its reading\r\nand exposition more interesting and influential in the Church.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the situation makes it evident that the Christian\r\nreligion is not declining in our land; but it is passing through a\r\ntransition state, putting off antiquated dogmas, customs, and methods,\r\nand adapting itself to the modern world, and transferring itself so as\r\nto better accomplish its work. In no age has Christianity made more\r\nadvance than in the century now drawing to a close.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Indians of Bolivia are described by Sir Martin Conway as “an\r\n    exceedingly bigoted folk, retaining under a mask of Christianity\r\n    their ancient superstitions, little altered,” and are kept in\r\n    order by priestly management rather than by force. Mr. Conway\r\n    was seriously interfered with by them in the prosecution of his\r\n    researches because the nature of his undertaking involved some\r\n    outrage to their superstitions. They regard the mountains above the\r\n    level of habitation as part of the other world, and holding, among\r\n    other fancies, that a golden bull and a golden cross planted by\r\n    supernatural agency stood on the summit of one of the peaks round\r\n    the base of Mount Serata, thought that the object of the explorer’s\r\n    expedition could be nothing else than to obtain possession of these\r\n    priceless treasures. Hence they offered formidable opposition to\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CENTURY OF GEOLOGY.[A]\r\n\r\nBY PROF. JOSEPH LE CONTE.\r\n\r\n    [A] In this article I have attempted to give only the development\r\n        of geological thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeology is one of the youngest of the sciences. It may almost be said\r\nto have been born of the present century. It is true that knowledge\r\nconcerning the structure of the earth had been accumulating ever since\r\nthe time of the Greeks and Romans; it is true that these materials\r\nbecame more abundant and were better organized in the eighteenth\r\ncentury; but this knowledge had not yet taken form as a distinct\r\nbranch of science until about the end of that century. There are two\r\ndistinctive marks of scientific as compared with popular knowledge:\r\nFirst, that its fundamental idea is clearly conceived; and, second,\r\nthat its method is distinctly inductive.\r\n\r\n1. FUNDAMENTAL IDEA.--The fundamental idea underlying geological\r\nthought is the history of the earth. Now, until the beginning of the\r\npresent century the earth was not supposed to have any history. It was\r\nsupposed to have been made at once, out of hand, about six thousand\r\nyears ago, and to have remained substantially unchanged ever since as\r\nthe necessary theater of human history. Changes were known to have\r\ntaken place and in less degree to be still taking place, but these\r\nwere not supposed to follow any law such as is necessary to constitute\r\na history, and thus to constitute a science distinct from geography.\r\nBuffon, about the middle of the last century, did indeed bring out\r\ndimly the idea of an abyss of time, preceding the advent of man, in\r\nwhich the earth was inhabited by animals and plants wholly different\r\nfrom those of the present day, but he was compelled by the priests of\r\nthe Sorbonne to retract these supposed irreligious views. So tardily\r\nwas the fundamental idea of geology clearly conceived that Comte, the\r\ngreat originator of scientific philosophy, in his classification of\r\nthe sciences in 1820, denied a place to geology because, according\r\nto him, it was not a distinct science at all, but only a field for\r\nthe application of all the sciences. It is evident that he did not\r\nperceive the fundamental idea underlying geology and distinguishing\r\nit from geography--viz., a life history of the earth through all\r\ntime. The claim of geology to a place in a scheme of classification\r\nis exactly the same as that of astronomy. As astronomy is a field for\r\nthe application of mathematics, mechanics, physics, and, recently,\r\nchemistry, but is distinguished from them all by its characteristic\r\nfundamental idea of illimitable space, so geology is a field for the\r\napplication of all other lower sciences, but is distinguished from\r\nthem all by her characteristic fundamental idea of illimitable time.\r\nAs all other sciences are terrestrial, but astronomy alone celestial,\r\nso all other sciences belong to the present--the “_now_”--but geology\r\nalone belongs to the illimitable past. The fundamental idea of the one\r\nis infinite _space_, of the other infinite, in sense of inconceivable,\r\n_time_. All other sciences, including astronomy, are but a flash-light\r\nview of Nature. Geology alone is a view of Nature in continuous\r\nmovement, a life history--an evolution of Nature. This mode of thought\r\nbegan to dawn only in the closing years of the last and the opening\r\nyears of the present century. It seems to have been first clearly\r\nconceived by the mind of Hutton in the last part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n2. INDUCTIVE METHOD APPLIED.--When the true idea underlying geology\r\nwas clearly conceived and geology thus distinctly separated from other\r\ndepartments of science, geology may be said to have been born. But\r\nit was still in helpless infancy, its growth irregular, and even its\r\ncontinuous life uncertain, because a solid basis of inductive method\r\nwas not yet laid. That basis was laid mainly by Hutton in 1795,[B] and\r\nstill more clearly by Charles Lyell in 1830, in the principle that\r\nthe study of _causes now in operation_ is the only true foundation of\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\n    [B] Hutton’s Theory of the Earth.\r\n\r\nGeological changes, of course, belong to the irrevocable past, and are\r\ntherefore hopelessly removed from _direct_ observation. Their causes\r\nand process must be reconstructed by the skillful use of the scientific\r\nimagination. Until Lyell, more or less probable hypotheses seemed all\r\nthat was possible. What a field was here for the conflict of opposite\r\nextreme views! But Lyell showed that “causes now in operation” are\r\nproducing similar effects under our eyes, if we will only observe. From\r\nthat moment geology became a truly inductive science and its indefinite\r\nprogress assured.\r\n\r\nThese two events, then--viz., the conception of geology as a distinct\r\nscience, and the introduction of a true scientific method--are the\r\ngreatest epochs in the history of geological science. Some dim\r\nadumbrations of these appear before this century, especially the former\r\nin the mind of Buffon, and the latter somewhat fully in the mind of\r\nHutton, but they were not generally accepted and had not become working\r\nprinciples until the beginning and even some time after the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century. These must be borne in mind in all we have\r\nfurther to say of the progress of geology through the century.\r\n\r\nWhen the century opened, the war between the Neptunists and the\r\nPlutonists, between the Wernerites and the Huttonites, was still\r\ngoing on, but was approaching the usual result in such cases of\r\ndispute--viz., the recognition of the fact that there was truth on\r\nboth sides, and they must be combined into a more comprehensive view.\r\nThe chief difference of opinion still remaining was as to the relative\r\nimportance of the two agencies, aqueous and igneous. Two great advances\r\ntook place about the beginning of this century: William Smith, by\r\npatient, painstaking field observation and mapping, laid the foundation\r\nof stratigraphy; and Cuvier, by his profound and brilliant studies of\r\nthe wonderful discoveries of extinct mammals in the Eocene basin of\r\nParis, laid the foundations of paleontology. These researches placed\r\nin clearer light than ever before the existence of other time-worlds\r\nbefore the present one. William Smith published his tabular view of the\r\nBritish Strata in 1790, but his map was not completed and published\r\nuntil 1815. Cuvier’s great work on the Organic Remains of the Paris\r\nBasin was published in 1808.\r\n\r\nThus, early in the century the two bases of our science were laid by\r\nSmith and Cuvier. We now proceed to touch lightly only the main steps\r\nof subsequent growth through the century.\r\n\r\nAs, in the previous century and the early part of this, the discussion\r\nwas between the opposite schools of Neptunists and Plutonists, with\r\nthe final result of reconciliation in a more scientific view which\r\ncombined these two surface views into a stereoscopic reality, so now\r\nthe discussions began between catastrophism and uniformitarianism, and\r\nended with a similar final result. Geologists, in the early part of the\r\ncentury, before the study of causes and processes now in operation was\r\ngenerally acknowledged as the only rational basis of a true scientific\r\ngeology, seeing the frequent unconformities in the geological series\r\nand the apparently sudden changes of life forms associated with these\r\nunconformities, were naturally led to the conclusion that the whole\r\nhistory of the earth consisted of a series of sudden and violent\r\ncatastrophes by which the bed of the ocean was suddenly raised and\r\nits waters precipitated on the land as a great wave of translation,\r\ncarrying universal ruin and extermination of all life in its course.\r\nSuch catastrophes were supposed to be followed by periods of quiet,\r\nduring which the new earth was repeopled, by direct act of creation,\r\nwith new forms of life adapted to the new conditions.\r\n\r\nThis view was in perfect accord with the then accepted doctrine of\r\nthe supernatural origin and the permanence of species. Species were\r\nsupposed to have been created at once, out of hand, without natural\r\nprocess, in some place (center of specific origin), spread in all\r\ndirections as far as physical conditions would allow, but remained\r\nunchanged and unchangeable as long as they continued to live or until\r\nanother universal exterminating catastrophe. Species are “medals of\r\ncreation.” They are successive individuals struck from the same die,\r\nuntil the die is worn out or broken. Then a new die is made, and the\r\nprocess of coinage of identical individuals is renewed.\r\n\r\nThus the whole history of the earth was supposed to consist of\r\na succession of alternate supernatural and natural events. The\r\ncatastrophes were supernatural; the times of quiet were natural. The\r\ncreation of new dies or creation of first individuals was supernatural;\r\nthe coinage of individuals of successive generations was natural. But\r\non the whole the successive conditions of physical geography and the\r\nsuccessive faunas and floras were higher and more complex according to\r\na preordained plan. The great apostles of catastrophism were Cuvier\r\nin France and Buckland in England. According to Buckland, the last\r\nof these great catastrophes was the Quaternary or drift period, and\r\nthis period was, by him and by many others since, associated with the\r\nNoachian Deluge.\r\n\r\nLyell opposed this view with all his power. According to him we can not\r\njudge of geological causes and processes except by study of causes and\r\nprocesses now in operation and producing effects under our eyes. The\r\nslow operation of similar causes and processes is sufficient--given\r\ntime enough--to account for all the phenomena in geological history.\r\nThus arose the extreme opposite doctrine of _uniformitarianism_. Things\r\nhave gone on from the beginning and throughout all time much as they\r\nare going on now. This view, of course, required illimitable time, and\r\nwas of great service in enforcing this idea. But, in revulsion from the\r\nprevious idea of catastrophism, it undoubtedly was pushed much too far.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the theory of evolution was incubating in the mind of Darwin.\r\nEven Lyell, while he established the doctrine of slow uniform changes\r\nso far as inorganic Nature was concerned, was still compelled to admit\r\nsupernatural catastrophic changes in organic Nature. Species, even for\r\nLyell, were still immutable--still there were supernatural creation of\r\nfirst individuals, and continuance of similar individuals by natural\r\nprocess of generation. On the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species\r\nby Descent with Modification, Lyell at once embraced the new view\r\nas a completion of his principle of causes now in operation and his\r\ndoctrine of uniformitarianism. In a certain superficial sense evolution\r\nis certainly confirmatory of the doctrine of uniformity of causes and\r\nprocesses in the past and the present, but in a deeper sense it is\r\nquite contrary in its spirit. Uniformitarians of the Lyell school look\r\nupon geology as a chronicle of events--evolutionists as a life history\r\nof the earth. The one regards the slow changes as irregular, uncertain,\r\nwithout progress or purpose or goal; the other as an evolution to\r\nhigher and higher conditions, as a gradual movement onward toward the\r\npresent condition and toward man as its goal. The recognition of this\r\nis only now approaching clearness. If geology is the history of the\r\nevolution of the earth from primal chaos until now, then the conditions\r\nhave changed at every step, and absolute uniformity is impossible.\r\nExtreme uniformitarianism is therefore untenable. Catastrophism and\r\nuniformitarianism are opposite extremes which must be combined and\r\nreconciled. This reconciliation is only now being completed, and we\r\ntherefore put off its discussion for the present. Suffice it to say\r\nnow that geologic thought in this regard has passed through three\r\nstages--catastrophism, uniformitarianism, and evolutionism. And this\r\nlatter is the final stage, because (1) it is a complete reconciliation\r\nbetween the other two, and (2) because it is plastic and indefinitely\r\nmodifiable and progressive, while the other two are equally rigid and\r\nunchangeable by their mutual antagonism.\r\n\r\nWith these fundamental principles in mind, we proceed to touch briefly\r\nthe most important advances during the century.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF EARTH FORMS.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the progressive development of the earth in its greater\r\nfeatures throughout all geologic time by the action of forces resident\r\nin the earth itself preceded the acceptance of the evolution of organic\r\nforms. We have said that the fundamental idea of geology is that of the\r\nevolution of the earth through all time. Now, it was Dana who first\r\nstudied geology wholly from this point of view. For him geology was\r\nthe development of the earth as a unit. Before him, doubtless, geology\r\nwas a kind of history--i. e., a chronicle of thrilling events--but\r\nDana first made it a philosophic history. Before Dana, geology was an\r\naccount of the succession of formations and their fossil contents. Dana\r\nmade it an account of the evolution of earth forms and the concomitant\r\nand resulting evolution of organic forms. It is true that first and for\r\na long time his evolutional conception was incomplete. It is true that\r\nwhile he attributed the evolution of earth forms to natural causes and\r\nprocesses, he still shrank from applying similar causes to the changes\r\nin life forms, but this was the almost necessary result of the then\r\nuniversal belief in the supernatural origin and the unchangeableness\r\nof organic forms. He lived to make his conception of evolution as a\r\nnatural process, both of the earth and of organic forms, complete.\r\n\r\n_Ocean Basins and Continents._--If we divide geological causes and\r\nprocesses into two general kinds as to their origin--viz., internal,\r\nor earth-derived, and external, or sun-derived--evidently the former\r\nis the original and fundamental kind. These determine earth forms,\r\nwhile the other only modify them; these determine the great features,\r\nthe other only the lesser features; the former rough-hews the earth\r\nfeatures, the latter shapes them. It is the effects of these interior\r\nearth forces which are the most important to study. And among these\r\neffects the most fundamentally important of all is the formation of\r\nthose greatest features--the ocean basins and continental arches.\r\nThe most probable view is that they are formed by unequal radial\r\ncontraction in the secular cooling of the earth. The earth was\r\ncertainly at one time an incandescently hot mass, which gradually\r\ncooled and contracted to its present temperature and size. Now, if it\r\nwere perfectly homogeneous both in density and in conductivity in all\r\nparts, then, cooling and contracting equally in every part, it would\r\nretain its symmetric oblate-spheroid form, though diminishing in size.\r\nBut if there were any, the least, heterogeneity either in density or\r\nespecially in conductivity over large areas, then the more conductive\r\nareas, contracting more rapidly toward the center radially, would form\r\nhollows or basins, and the less conductive areas would stand out as\r\nhigher arches. Thus were formed the oceanic basin and the continental\r\narches of the lithosphere. The same causes which produced would\r\ncontinue to increase them, and thus the ocean basins would increase in\r\ndepth and the continents in height.\r\n\r\nThe hydrosphere is still to be added. In the beginning of this process\r\ndoubtless the lithosphere was hot enough to maintain all the water\r\nin the form of vapor in the atmosphere. But when the surface was\r\ncool enough the water would precipitate and partly or wholly cover\r\nthe earth--whether partly or wholly would depend on the amount of\r\nprecipitated water and the amount of inequality which had already\r\ntaken place. The amount of water, as we know, is sufficient, if the\r\ninequalities were removed, to cover the whole surface two and a half\r\nmiles deep. Inasmuch as the forming of the inequalities is progressive\r\nand still going on, it seems improbable that the inequalities had\r\nbecome sufficiently great, at the time of precipitation, to hold the\r\nwaters. If this be so, then the primeval ocean was universal and the\r\nfuture continents existed only as continental banks in the universal\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nHowever this may have been, there seems little doubt that the same\r\ncause which produced the inequalities continued to operate to increase\r\nthem. The ocean basins, so far as these causes are concerned, must\r\nhave become deeper and deeper, and the continents larger and larger.\r\nIn spite of many oscillations producing changes mostly on the margins,\r\nbut sometimes extending over wide areas in the interior of the\r\ncontinent, this, on the whole, seems to be in accordance with the\r\nknown geological history of the earth. If so, then _the oceanic basins\r\nhave always been oceanic basins, and the places of the continents have\r\nalways been substantially the same_. This introduces a subject on which\r\nthere has been much discussion recently--viz.:\r\n\r\n_The Permanency of Ocean Basins._--Closely associated with the\r\nLyellian uniformitarianism was the doctrine of extreme instability\r\nof earth features, especially the forms and places of sea and land.\r\nCrust movements were irregularly oscillating to such a degree that\r\nin the course of geologic history sea and land frequently and\r\ncompletely changed places. Abundant evidence of this was supposed\r\nto be found in the unconformities so frequent in the stratified\r\nseries. The tendency of that time was toward a belief in up-and-down\r\nmovements, back-and-forth changes, without discoverable law, rather\r\nthan progressive onward movement. On first thought it might seem\r\nthat such lawless movement was rather in keeping with catastrophism\r\nthan uniformitarianism. But not so, for the movements are supposed\r\nto be very slow. Again, it might seem on first thought that gradual\r\nprogressive change--in a word, evolution--would be peculiarly in accord\r\nwith uniformitarian ideas. But again not so, because this doctrine\r\nwas, above all, a revulsion from the idea of supernatural purpose or\r\ndesign or goal contained in catastrophism. Uniformitarianism strongly\r\ninclined toward purposelessness, because of its supposed identity with\r\nnaturalism. Thus for a long time, and still with many geologists,\r\nthe tendency is toward a belief in irregular movements without\r\ndiscoverable law, toward instability of even the greatest features of\r\nthe earth--viz., sea basins and continental arches. Geology for them is\r\na chronicle, not a life history.\r\n\r\nThe contrary movement of thought may be said to have commenced with\r\nDana. Dana studied the earth as a unit, as in some sense an organism\r\ndeveloping by forces within itself. The history of the earth is a\r\nlife history moving progressively toward its completion. The forces\r\noriginating oceanic basins and continental arches still continue\r\nto deepen the former and enlarge the latter. From this point of\r\nview, oceanic basins and continental arches must have always been\r\nsubstantially in the same places. Oscillations there have been at\r\nall times and in all places, but they affect mainly the outlines of\r\nthese great features, though sometimes affecting also the interior of\r\ncontinents and mid-sea bottoms, but not sufficiently to change greatly\r\ntheir general form, much less to interchange their places.\r\n\r\nSuch is the doctrine of permanency of oceanic basins. It is undoubtedly\r\na true doctrine, but must not be held in the rigid form characteristic\r\nof early thought. The forces originating oceanic basins still continue\r\nto deepen them and to increase the size and height of continents, but\r\nother forces are at work, some antagonizing (i. e., cutting down the\r\ncontinents and filling up the ocean beds), and still others determined\r\nby causes we little understand, by oscillations over wide areas,\r\ngreatly modifying and often obscuring the effects of the basin-making\r\nmovements. Here, then, we have two kinds of crust movements: the one\r\nfundamental and original, determining the greatest features of the\r\nearth and moving steadily onward in the same direction, ever increasing\r\nthe features which it originates; the other apparently lawless,\r\nuncertain, oscillating over very wide areas, modifying and often\r\nobscuring the effects of the former. The old uniformitarians saw only\r\nthe effects of the latter, because these are most conspicuous; the\r\nnew evolutionists add also the former and show its more fundamental\r\ncharacter, and thus introduce law and order into the previous chaos.\r\nThe former is the one movement which runs ever _in the same direction\r\nthrough all geologic time_. The latter are the most common and\r\nconspicuous now and in all previous geologic time. The former underlies\r\nand conditions and unifies the history; the latter has practically\r\ndetermined all the details of the drama enacted here on the surface\r\nof the earth. Of the causes of the former we know something, though\r\nyet imperfectly. Of the causes of the latter we yet know absolutely\r\nnothing. We have not even begun to speculate profitably on the subject,\r\nand hence the apparent lawlessness of the phenomena. A fruitful theory\r\nof these must be left to the coming century.\r\n\r\n_Mountain Ranges._--If oceanic basins and continental domes constitute\r\nthe greatest features of the earth’s face, and are determined by the\r\nmost fundamental movements of the crust, surely next in importance\r\ncome great mountain ranges. These are the glory of our earth, the\r\nculminating points of scenic beauty and grandeur. But they are so only\r\nbecause they are also the culminating points, the theaters of greatest\r\nactivity, of all geological forces, both igneous and aqueous--igneous\r\nin their formation, and aqueous both in the preparatory sedimentation\r\nand in the final erosive sculpturing into forms of beauty. A theory\r\nof mountain ranges therefore lies at the bases of all theoretical\r\ngeology. To the pre-geologic mind mountains are the type of permanence\r\nand stability. We still speak metaphorically of the _everlasting_\r\nhills. But the first lesson taught by geology is that nothing is\r\npermanent; everything is subject to continuous change by a process of\r\nevolution. Mountains are no exception. We know them in embryo in the\r\nwomb of the ocean. We know the date of their birth; we trace their\r\ngrowth, their maturity, their decay, their death; we even find in the\r\nfolded structure of the rock, as it were, the fossil bones of extinct\r\nmountains. In a word, we are able now to trace the whole life history\r\nof mountains.\r\n\r\nMountains, therefore, have always been a subject of deepest interest\r\nboth to the popular and the scientific mind--an interest intensified\r\nby the splendors of mountain scenery and the perils of mountain\r\nexploration. The study of mountains is therefore coeval with the study\r\nof geology. As early as the beginning of the present century Constant\r\nPrevost observed that most characteristic structure of mountains--viz.,\r\ntheir folded strata--and inferred their formation by lateral pressure.\r\nAll subsequent writers have assumed lateral pressure as somehow\r\nconcerned in the formation of mountains. But that the whole height\r\nof mountains is due wholly to this cause was not generally admitted\r\nor even imagined until recently. It was universally supposed that\r\nmountains were lifted by volcanic forces from beneath, that the lifted\r\nstrata broke along the top of the arch, and melted matter was forced\r\nthrough between the parted strata, pushing them back and folding them\r\non each side. And hence the typical form of mountain ranges is that\r\nof a granite axis along the crest and folded strata on each flank.\r\nBut attention has lately been drawn to the fact that some mountains,\r\nas, for example, the Appalachian, the Uintah, etc., consist of folded\r\nstrata alone, without any granite axis. In such ranges it is plain that\r\nthe whole height is due not to any force acting from below, but to a\r\nlateral pressure crushing and folding the strata, and a corresponding\r\nthickening and bulging of the same along the line of crushing. Then the\r\nidea was applied to _all_ mountain ranges. So soon as the prodigious\r\namount of erosion suffered by mountains, greater often than all that is\r\nleft of them, was fully appreciated, it became evident that the granite\r\naxis so characteristic of mountains was not necessarily pushed up from\r\nbeneath and protruded through the parted strata, but was in many cases\r\nonly a sub-mountain core of igneous matter slowly cooled into granite\r\nand exposed by subsequent erosion greatest along the crest.\r\n\r\nNext, attention was drawn to the enormous thickness of the strata\r\ninvolved in the folded structure of mountains. From this it became\r\nevident that the places of mountains before they were formed were\r\nmarginal sea bottoms off the coasts of continents, and receiving the\r\nwhole washings of the continents. Thus the steps of the process of\r\nmountain formation were (1) accumulation of sediments on offshore sea\r\nbottoms until by _pari passu_ subsidence an enormous thickness was\r\nattained. This is the _preparation_. (2) A yielding along these lines\r\nto the increasing lateral pressure with folding and bulging of the\r\nstrata along the line of yielding, until the mountain emerges above\r\nthe ocean and is added to the land as a coast range. This is mountain\r\n_birth_. (3) As soon as it appears above the water it is attacked by\r\nerosive agents. At first the rising by continuance of the crushing and\r\nbulging is in excess of the erosion, and the mountain grows. This is\r\nmountain _youth_. (4) Then supply and waste balance one another, and we\r\nhave mountain _maturity_. (5) Then the erosive waste exceeds the growth\r\nby up-bulging, and mountain _decay_ begins. (6) Finally, the erosive\r\nforces triumph and the mountain is clean swept away, leaving only the\r\ncomplexly folded rocks of enormous thickness to mark the place of a\r\nformer mountain. This is mountain _death_. Such briefly is the life\r\nhistory of a mountain range.\r\n\r\nIn all this we have said nothing about causes. In this connection there\r\nare two points of especial importance: (1) Why does the yielding to\r\nlateral pressure take place along lines of thick sediments? (2) What is\r\nthe cause of the lateral pressure?\r\n\r\n1. _Cause of Yielding to Lateral Pressure along Lines of Thick\r\nSediments._--The earth was once very hot. It is still very hot within,\r\nand still very slowly cooling. If sediments accumulate upon a sea\r\nbottom the interior heat will tend to rise so as to keep at the same\r\ndistance from the surface. If the sediments are very thick, say five to\r\nten miles, their lower parts will be invaded by a temperature of not\r\nless than 500° to 1,000° F. This temperature, in the presence of water\r\n(the included water of the sediments), would be sufficient to produce\r\nsoftening or even fusion of the sediments and of the sea floor on which\r\nthey rest. This would establish a line of weakness, and therefore a\r\nline of yielding, crushing, folding, bulging, and thus a mountain\r\nrange. In the first formation of a range, therefore, there would\r\nnecessarily be a sub-mountain mass of fused or semifused matter which\r\nby the lateral crushing might be squeezed into cracks or fissures,\r\nforming dikes. But in any case the sub-mountain mass would cool into\r\na granite core which by erosion may be exposed along the crest. The\r\nexplanation seems to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\n2. _Cause of the Lateral Pressure._--No question in geology has been\r\nmore discussed than this, and yet none is more difficult and the\r\nsolution of which is more uncertain. But the most obvious and as\r\nyet the most probable view is that it is the result of the secular\r\ncontraction of the earth which has gone on throughout its whole\r\nhistory, and is still going on.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted by all that in an earth cooling from primal\r\nincandescence there must come a time when the surface, having become\r\nsubstantially cool and receiving heat also from the sun, would no\r\nlonger cool or contract, but, the interior being still incandescently\r\nhot, would continue to cool and contract. The interior, therefore,\r\ncooling and contracting faster than the exterior crust, the latter\r\nfollowing down the ever-shrinking nucleus, would be thrust upon itself\r\nby a lateral or tangential pressure which would be simply irresistible.\r\nIf the earth crust were a hundred times more rigid than it is, it still\r\nmust yield to the enormous pressure. It does yield along its weakest\r\nlines with crushing, folding, bulging, and the formation of mountain\r\nranges.\r\n\r\nThis is the barest outline of the so-called “contractional theory of\r\nmountain formation.” Very many objections have been brought against\r\nit, some of them answerable and completely answered, but the complete\r\nanswer to others must be left to the next century. Perhaps the greatest\r\nobjection of all is the apparent insufficiency of the cause to produce\r\nthe enormous amount of folding found not only in existing mountains but\r\nin the folded structure of rocks where mountains no longer exist. But\r\nit will be observed that I have thus far spoken only of contraction by\r\nloss of heat. Now, not only has this cause been greatly underestimated\r\nby objectors, but, as shown by Davison and especially by Van Hise,\r\nthere are many other and even greater causes of contraction. It would\r\nbe out of place to follow the discussion here. The subject is very\r\ncomplex, and not yet completely settled.\r\n\r\nWe have given the barest outline of the history of mountain ranges and\r\nof the theory of their formation as worked out in the last third of the\r\npresent century, and, I might add, chiefly by American geologists. So\r\ntrue is this, that by some it has been called the “American theory.”\r\n\r\n_Oscillatory Movements of the Earth’s Crust over Wide Areas._--We\r\nhave already spoken of these as modifying the effect of the\r\nocean-basin-making movements, and therefore now touch them very\r\nlightly. These differ from the movements producing oceanic basins\r\non the one hand and mountain ranges on the other, by the fact\r\nthat they are not continuously progressive in one direction, but\r\n_oscillatory_--now up, now down, in the same place. Again, they do not\r\ninvolve contraction of the whole earth, but probably are always more or\r\nless local and compensatory--i. e., rising in one place is compensated\r\nby down-sinking in some other place. Nevertheless, they often\r\naffect very wide areas--sometimes, indeed, of more than continental\r\nextent--as, for example, in the crust movements of the Quaternary\r\nperiod or ice age.\r\n\r\nThese are by far the most frequent and most conspicuous of all\r\ncrust movements--not only now, but also in all geological times. If\r\nocean-basin-forming movements are the underlying cause and condition\r\nof the evolution of the earth, these wide oscillations, by increasing\r\nand decreasing the size and height of continents and changing greatly\r\ntheir contours, have determined all the details of the drama enacted\r\non the surface, and were the determining cause of the varying rates\r\nand directions of the evolution of the organic kingdom. These were the\r\ncause of the unconformities and the corresponding apparent wholesale\r\nchanges in species so common in the rocky strata, and which gave rise\r\nto the doctrine of catastrophism of the early geologists. These also\r\nhave so greatly modified the contours of the continents and their size\r\nby temporary increase or decrease that they have obscured the general\r\nlaw of the steady development of these, and therefore their substantial\r\npermanency.\r\n\r\nAlthough the most important of all crust movements in determining the\r\nwhole history of the earth, and especially of the organic kingdom, we\r\nshall dwell no further on them, because no progress has yet been made\r\nin their explanation. This, too, must be left to the workers of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\n_The Principle of Isostasy._--The principle of static equilibrium as\r\napplied to earth forms was first brought forward (as so many other\r\nvaluable suggestions and anticipations in many departments of science)\r\nby the wonderfully fertile mind of Sir John Herschel, and used by him\r\nin the explanation of the sinking of river deltas under the increasing\r\nweight of accumulating sediments.[C] It was afterward applied to\r\ncontinental masses by Archbishop Pratt[D] and by the Royal Astronomer\r\nProfessor Airy.[E] But for its wide application as a principle in\r\ngeology, its clear definition, and its embodiment in an appropriate\r\nname, we are indebted to Major Dutton, United States Army.[F]\r\n\r\n    [C] Philosophical Magazine, vol. ii, p. 212, 1837; Quarterly\r\n        Journal of Geological Society, vol. ii, p. 548, 1837.\r\n\r\n    [D] Philosophical Magazine, vol. ix, p. 231, and vol. x, p.\r\n        240, 1855.\r\n\r\n    [E] Philosophical Trans., 1855, p. 101.\r\n\r\n    [F] Philosophical Society of Washington, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe principle may be briefly stated as follows: A globe so large as the\r\nearth, under the influence of its own gravity, must behave like a very\r\nstiffly viscous body--that is, the general form of the earth and its\r\ngreatest inequalities must be in substantial static equilibrium. For\r\nexample, the general form of the earth is oblate spheroid, because that\r\nis the only form of equilibrium of a rotating body. Rotation determines\r\na distribution of gravity with latitude which brings about this form.\r\nWith any other form the earth would be in a state of strain to which\r\nit must slowly yield, and finally relieve itself by becoming oblate.\r\nIf the rotation stopped, the earth would accommodate itself to the new\r\ndistribution of gravity and become spherical.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the large inequalities of surface. Oceanic\r\nbasins and continental arches must be in static equilibrium or they\r\ncould not sustain themselves. In order to be in equilibrium the\r\nsub-oceanic material must be as much more dense than the continental\r\nand sub-continental material as the ocean bottoms are lower than\r\nthe continental surfaces. Such static equilibrium, by difference of\r\ndensity, is completely explained by the mode of formation of oceanic\r\nbasins already given.\r\n\r\nSo also plateaus and great mountain ranges are at least partly\r\nsustained by gravitative equilibrium, but partly also by earth\r\nrigidity. It is only the smaller inequalities, such as ridges, peaks,\r\nvalleys, etc., that are sustained by earth rigidity alone.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions are not reached by physical reasonings alone, but are\r\nalso confirmed by experimental investigations. For example, a plumb\r\nline on the plains of India is deflected indeed toward the Himalayas,\r\nas it ought to be, but much less than it would be if the mountain and\r\nsub-mountain mass were not less dense and the sub-oceanic material\r\nmore dense than the average.[G] Again, gravitative determinations by\r\npendulum oscillations, undertaken by the United States along a line\r\nfrom the Atlantic shore to Salt Lake City, show that the largest\r\ninequalities, such as the Appalachian bulge, the Mississippi-basin\r\nhollow, and the Rocky Mountain bulge, are in gravitative\r\nequilibrium--i. e., the mountain and sub-mountain material is as much\r\nlighter as the mountain region is higher than the Mississippi-basin\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n    [G] Pratt, Philosophical Magazine, vol. ix, p. 231, 1855; vol.\r\n        x, p. 340, 1855; vol. xvi, p. 401, 1858.\r\n\r\nNow, so sensitive is the earth to changes of gravity that, given time\r\nenough, it responds to increase or decrease of pressure over large\r\nareas by corresponding subsidence or elevation. Hence, all places where\r\ngreat accumulations of sediment are going on are sinking under the\r\nincreased weight, and, contrarily, all places where excessive erosion\r\nis going on, as, for example, on high plateaus and great mountain\r\nranges, are rising by relief of pressure.\r\n\r\nThis principle of isostasy is undoubtedly a valuable one, which must be\r\nborne in mind in all our reasonings on crust movements, although its\r\nimportance has been exaggerated by some enthusiastic supporters. Its\r\ngreatest importance is not as a cause _initiating_ crust movements or\r\ndetermining the features of the earth, but rather as conditioning and\r\nmodifying the results produced by other causes. The idea belongs wholly\r\nto the latter half of the present century. Commencing about 1840, it\r\nhas grown in clearness and importance to the present time.\r\n\r\n[_To be concluded._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPLICATIONS OF EXPLOSIVES.\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES E. MUNROE,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY, COLUMBIAN UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n[_Concluded._]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUN COTTON SHELL AFTER IMPACT.]\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the range of even the most highly perfected\r\ntorpedo is comparatively short, while their accuracy of travel is low.\r\nBesides, their propelling, controlling, and discharging mechanisms are\r\ncomplicated, delicate, and easily deranged, they are very expensive,\r\nand not only the explosive chamber but the entire system is destroyed\r\nin use. The superiority of gunpowder guns as a means of throwing\r\nprojectiles to great distances with accuracy is well known, and\r\ntheir capacity for safely and efficiently projecting shells filled\r\nwith gunpowder has long been demonstrated. It was obvious that as\r\nthe superior destructive power of dynamite, gun cotton, and other\r\nhigh explosives became known and their commercial manufacture was\r\nassured, attempts would be made to employ them as bursting charges\r\nfor shells. Experiments to demonstrate how this might be done and\r\nwhat effects could be expected were begun more than forty years ago,\r\nand have been continued in many different places from time to time\r\never since; but while it has proved that small charges might be\r\nfired with low velocities and pressures in ordinary shell, and large\r\ncharges in specially constructed shell or in specially prepared forms\r\nof charge, with comparative safety so far as the premature explosion\r\nof the explosive charge itself is concerned, yet these bodies are so\r\nsensitive to the shock resulting from the discharge of the propellant,\r\nthe heat generated by its combustion, and that arising from friction\r\nin the “set-back” of the shell charge and the rotation imparted by\r\nthe rifling, that they can not be safely fired from modern high-power\r\nguns under service conditions, particularly as these explosives all\r\nrequire that the shell shall be fitted with a detonator in order that\r\nthe charge may be fully exploded. The most promising results with\r\nexplosives of this class have been obtained with compressed wet gun\r\ncotton, which has been packed directly in the shell in rigid blocks\r\ncompletely filling the shell cavity, or cut in cubes and cemented in\r\nthe cavity with carnauba wax, for shell filled in the former manner,\r\nbut unfused, were repeatedly fired, in 1887 and 1888, at Newport, R.\r\nI., from 24-pounder Dahlgren howitzers and 20-pounder muzzle-loading\r\nrifles with service charges of powder, and though they were fired\r\npoint blank into the masonry escarpment of the old fort on Rose\r\nIsland, but fifty yards distant from the muzzle, so that the shells\r\nwere broken up or distorted and the gun cotton in them subjected to a\r\npowerful compression, yet not only was there no premature explosion,\r\nbut none of the shell exploded by impact. About the same time fused\r\nshell containing cemented gun cotton were fired in Germany, with an\r\ninitial velocity of fourteen hundred feet per second, and they passed\r\ncompletely through four inches and three quarters of compound armor,\r\nbacked with twenty-four inches of oak, and burst inside the bombproof,\r\nwhile in 1897 fused armor-piercing shells containing wet gun cotton\r\nwere fired from the six-inch quick-firing gun, with a muzzle velocity\r\nof nearly nineteen hundred feet per second, which completely perforated\r\nthree inches of steel and burst behind the plate. Encouraged by these\r\nresults, this system was adopted by our army officials, but, on trial\r\nin larger calibers at Sandy Hook, it gave rise to premature explosions,\r\nand the tale of disaster reached its climax on April 29, 1899, when\r\nCaptain Stuart, of the Ordnance Corps, was superintending the loading\r\nof a twelve-inch torpedo shell with wet gun cotton by compressing\r\nit into the shell, for an explosion resulted which killed four men\r\ninstantly and fatally wounded two others, Captain Stuart being one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIMS-DUDLEY PNEUMATIC GUN, LIMBERED UP.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of the Scientific American.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIMS-DUDLEY PNEUMATIC GUN, IN BATTERY.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of the Scientific American.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYNDALL’S BRONZE BELL-MOUTHED GUN.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the attempts made to use nitroglycerin, dynamite,\r\nexplosive gelatin, and explosives of this class as bursting charges\r\nfor shell fired from service guns is even less satisfactory than that\r\ngiven for gun cotton. It is not surprising, therefore, that inventors\r\nshould have proposed catapults, slings, rotary wheels, and other means\r\nfor projecting these powerful agents into the enemy’s midst, but the\r\nMefford air gun, as mounted on the United States steamship Vesuvius,\r\nand the Sims-Dudley gun, in which a reduced charge of powder is fired\r\nin a chamber exterior to the gun proper, were deemed to possess\r\nsufficient merit to warrant their trial in the field. These devices\r\nwere employed in the recent war with Spain, the pneumatic guns on the\r\nVesuvius being used to throw shells containing three hundred pounds of\r\ngun cotton, while the Sims-Dudley guns were used on land to throw small\r\ncharges of dynamite or explosive gelatin; but, beyond frightening the\r\nenemy by the startling character of their reports, these superficial\r\ncharges produced no serious effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIRROR OR REFLECTOR IN WHICH TO FIRE GUN COTTON.]\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread misapprehension in regard to the devastating\r\neffect of these high explosives, for when unconfined the effect even of\r\nlarge charges of them upon structures is comparatively slight. At the\r\nNaval Ordnance Proving Ground, so long ago as 1884, repeated charges\r\nof dynamite, varying from five pounds to one hundred pounds in weight,\r\nwere detonated on the face of a vertical target consisting of eleven\r\none-inch wrought-iron plates bolted to a twenty-inch oak backing, until\r\n440 pounds of dynamite had been so detonated in contact with it, and\r\nyet the target remained practically uninjured; while at Braamfontein\r\nthe accidental explosion of fifty-five tons of blasting gelatin, which\r\nwas stored in railway vans, excavated but 30,000 tons of soft earth.\r\nThis last may seem a terrible effect, but the amount of explosive\r\ninvolved was enormous and the material one of the most energetic that\r\nwe possess, while if we compare it with the action of explosives when\r\nconfined its effect becomes quite moderate. Thus at Fort Lee, on the\r\nHudson, but two tons of dynamite placed in a chamber in the rock and\r\ntamped brought down 100,000 tons of the rock; at Lamberis, Wales,\r\ntwo tons and a half of gelatin dynamite similarly placed threw out\r\n180,000 tons of rock; and at the Talcen Mawr, in Wales, seven tons of\r\ngunpowder, placed in two chambers in the rock, dislodged from 125,000\r\nto 200,000 tons of rock. We might cite many such examples, but on\r\ncomparing these we find that the gunpowder confined in the interior at\r\nthe Talcen Mawr was over forty-two times as efficient as the explosive\r\ngelatin on the surface at Braamfontein, while the dynamite at Fort Lee\r\nwas over ninety times as destructive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAILROAD TORPEDOES FASTENED ON RAIL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEEL DISKS UPON WHICH GUN COTTON HAS BEEN DETONATED TO\r\nTEST THEIR RESISTANCE TO SHOCK. Midvale steel disks after second fire.]\r\n\r\nConsiderations similar to these led me, in 1885,[H] to point out that\r\nhigh explosives for use in shells must be strongly confined, and in\r\nthe attack on armored ships they should be fired in projectiles that\r\ncan “either penetrate the armor partially and explode in place or\r\npierce it completely and burst inside the ship” to secure the greatest\r\nefficiency. This requires that the projectiles shall be fired at\r\nhigher velocities than can be imparted to them by guns of the kind\r\njust described, and which can only be realized at present in modern\r\nbreech-loading rifles. Although experience has shown the futility of\r\nall our efforts to use gun cotton and nitroglycerin explosives in this\r\nmanner, it has been proved that the nitro-substitution explosives can\r\nbe employed with safety and effect.\r\n\r\n    [H] Van Nostrand’s Engineering Magazine, vol. xxxii, pp. 1-9,\r\n        1885.\r\n\r\nThe nitro-substitution explosives are made from nitrobenzenes,\r\nnitrotoluenes, nitronaphthalenes, nitrophenols, and bodies of a similar\r\ncharacter, and one of them, called joveite, has given excellent results\r\nin this country. After having demonstrated that the destructive effect\r\nof joveite was greater than that of gunpowder, smokeless powder, or gun\r\ncotton, and, by repeated trials under severe conditions, that service\r\nshell loaded with it could be fired from service guns under service\r\nconditions with safety, on November 3, 1897, the naval officials\r\nat Indian Head fired a fused ten-inch Carpenter armor-piercing\r\nprojectile containing 8.25 pounds of joveite, with a velocity of 1,960\r\nfoot-seconds, at a Harveyized nickel-steel plate taken from the armor\r\nfor the United States steamship Kentucky. The shell passed completely\r\nthrough the armor plate, where it was 14.5 inches in thickness, and\r\nburst immediately behind the plate. In a second round an unfused\r\nten-inch Midvale semi-armor-piercing shell containing twenty-eight\r\npounds of joveite was fired with a velocity of 1,925 foot-seconds at\r\nthe same plate where it was sixteen inches thick. The shell penetrated\r\nto a depth of twelve inches, and the heat produced by the upsetting of\r\nthe shell was so great as to explode the joveite, which broke the plate\r\nand burst the shell with tremendous violence. In fact, the explosion\r\nwas so very severe that the heavy base plug of the shell was sheared\r\nlongitudinally, an effect never observed before with any explosive\r\nfired at the proving ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOOTING AN OIL WELL WITH NITROGLYCERIN.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that no accident occurred in any of the many firings,\r\nthat the stability and safety of the explosive are assured, and that\r\nthe explosion has been effected with a well-known and long-used form\r\nof fuse, no provision has yet been made to supply the service with\r\ncharges for its costly armor-piercing projectiles.\r\n\r\nHappily, the force resident in explosives may be applied to the\r\nsaving as well as to the destruction of human life, advantage having\r\nlong since been taken of the penetrating power of the report from\r\nthe discharge of a gun to employ them as signals of distress at sea\r\nor as warnings in foggy weather. The English Lighthouse Board, under\r\nProfessor Tyndall’s guidance, some years ago sought to find the form\r\nof gun best suited to this purpose, and their experiments led them at\r\nfirst to a bronze gun with a bell-shaped mouth. Subsequently, their\r\nattention being called to the sharpness and carrying power of the\r\nreport from detonating gun cotton, an apparatus was devised in which\r\nthe gun cotton was detonated in the focus of a parabolic mirror. The\r\nbest results, however, were attained with rockets carrying gun cotton\r\ncharges arranged to be exploded in mid air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAFE TO BE OPENED BY DETONATION OF NITROGLYCERIN. Before\r\nthe charge was fired.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER FIRING CHARGE.]\r\n\r\nGuns have also been arranged for projecting life-lines between stranded\r\nships and the adjacent shore, and are now employed on a smaller scale\r\nfor conveying lines to the upper stories of our monumental buildings\r\nwhen they are on fire. By means of guns or rockets, projectiles filled\r\nwith oil may be cast to considerable distances from a vessel in a\r\nraging sea, so that the oil, as it diffuses, may still the waters in\r\nher course; while sounding-lines may be thrown far in advance of a\r\nvessel while she is still under way, and the soundings taken without\r\nher laying-to.\r\n\r\nInclosed in shallow tin boxes, which are fixed by lead strips to the\r\ntop of the rail, explosives are used as torpedoes in the railroad\r\nservice to give warning, by the report of their explosion as an engine\r\nruns over them, that another train is on the same track and but a short\r\ndistance ahead, and by this means collisions in fogs or on curves are\r\nfrequently prevented.\r\n\r\nExplosives find applications in many industries. The farmer uses them\r\nin breaking bowlders, grubbing stumps and felling trees, in shaking\r\nthe soil to fit it for deep-soil cultivation, and, in the wine-growing\r\ndistricts, to free it from phylloxera, while the farmer’s friend has\r\ntried by this means, in times of drought, to shake the nerves of Jove\r\nand to divert the hailstorm from its course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAFE PERFORATED BY HOLLOW DYNAMITE CARTRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nThe iron founder uses them in breaking up large castings. The iron\r\nsmelter employs them to clear out obstructions in blast furnaces while\r\nthe latter are still in operation, the dynamite, protected by a clay\r\nenvelope, being inserted in the red-hot mass which clogs the furnace.\r\nThe author has proposed to use the detonating explosives for testing\r\nthe integrity of large masses of metals and their resistance to shock.\r\n\r\nDynamite has been employed in fishing, since submarine explosions of\r\nit will kill or stun fish for a long distance about the charge. This\r\nmethod of fishing, which threatened to deplete the waters, has very\r\nproperly been prohibited by law, but guns are employed for projecting\r\nharpoons in the whale fishery, and have reduced very much the danger\r\nattending this extra-hazardous occupation.\r\n\r\nNitroglycerin, inclosed in tin cans three to five inches in diameter\r\nand five to twenty-five feet in length, is used for shooting oil wells\r\nto free them from the solid paraffins with which they become choked, or\r\nto shake the oil-bearing sandstone so as to produce a greater yield. In\r\nthis work the loaded can, having a detonating cap attached to its top,\r\nis lowered by a wire to the bottom of the well, which is often fifteen\r\nhundred feet or more in depth. A perforated weight is then strung on\r\nthe wire, and when the torpedo is in place the weight is allowed to\r\nfall, strike the cap, and explode the charge.\r\n\r\nDynamite has been used to knock out the blocking from the ways when\r\nlaunching ships. Fired on an iron plate placed on the top of a pile\r\nand covered with a tamping of earth or clay, it has successfully and\r\neconomically replaced the pile driver. It has been found efficient in\r\nexcavating holes in which to plant telegraph and telephone poles; in\r\ndriving water out of quicksands in which foundations are to be laid\r\nor shafts to be driven; in slaughtering cattle; in breaking down ice\r\ndams to prevent inundations; in blowing up buildings to prevent the\r\nspread of conflagrations; in razing unsafe walls of burned buildings;\r\nin destroying wrecks which endanger navigation, and even in freeing\r\nvessels which are hard aground on shoals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLLOW DYNAMITE CARTRIDGE; ELEVATION.]\r\n\r\nAn especially notable instance was in the blasting out of the _débris_\r\nin the river at Johnstown after the frightful flood that occurred\r\nthere, which formed an enormous dam above the bridge and threatened\r\nits existence, and which was successfully and expeditiously removed by\r\nblasting after all other means had been tried in vain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLLOW DYNAMITE CARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\nView from below.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the amount of explosives consumed in the industries\r\nis so great that the quantity employed for military purposes\r\nsinks into insignificance. Yet we have failed to refer to those\r\nindustries--quarrying and mining, and the engineering operations--in\r\nwhich they are most extensively and commonly used, being employed so\r\nlargely in mining alone that it is an almost daily occurrence for\r\nblasts containing twenty, thirty, and even fifty thousand pounds of\r\nexplosives to be used in a single charge; and the system of large\r\nblasts has even become common in hard-rock excavations, such as\r\nquarries and railroad cuttings, while in the blast at the blowing up\r\nof Flood Rock, in New York Harbor, October 10, 1885, over one hundred\r\nand forty-one tons of rack-a-rock, dynamite, and mercury fulminate were\r\nused in a single shot.\r\n\r\nNor have I alluded to the use of explosives by the anarchists in\r\ntheir dastardly outrages, through which the safety of the old and\r\nyoung, feeble and strong, the innocent and the offending, are alike\r\nendangered; but I will touch briefly upon the applications of these\r\npowerful agents in the too-much cultivated industry of safe-robbing,\r\nsince I was called upon some years ago to demonstrate, before a\r\nGovernment commission, how safes might be successfully attacked either\r\nin a burglarious way or by a mob with explosives, meaning by the\r\nburglarious operation that the safe should be made accessible within\r\ntwenty-four hours with means such as a party of men could smuggle into\r\na bank and which might be used without attracting attention or doing\r\nmaterial damage to the building, and by “mob violence,” meaning that\r\nthe vaults are supposed to be in the hands of a mob which has ample\r\ntime and quantities of explosives at command, and does not care how\r\nmuch noise is made or destruction is wrought, provided the treasure is\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRING ON IRON DISK, RESTING ON LEAD DISK, IN TESTING\r\nTHE EFFICIENCY OF GUN COTTON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUN COTTON DISK. With indented inscription, and iron\r\nplate upon which the indented inscription has been reproduced.]\r\n\r\nIn the experiments made in a burglarious way, among others, a\r\nthree-thousand-dollar square safe of the most approved construction was\r\nattacked by inserting in the crevice about the locked door four and\r\neight tenths ounces of nitroglycerin, and in eight minutes after the\r\noperation of loading was begun the charge was fired, with the result\r\nthat the whole of the jamb below the door was blown out and a hole\r\nmade in the door of sufficient size to admit the hand and arm, while\r\nthe doors and divisions of the interior compartments were completely\r\nshattered. On repeating the operation with four ounces and a quarter of\r\nforcite dynamite the door was completely torn off.\r\n\r\nAmong experiments made to demonstrate the resistance of structures\r\nto attack by a mob was one upon a safe twenty-nine inches cube, with\r\nwalls four inches and three quarters thick, made up of plates of iron\r\nand steel, which were re-enforced on each edge so as to make it highly\r\nresisting, yet when a hollow charge of dynamite nine pounds and a half\r\nin weight and untamped was detonated on it a hole three inches in\r\ndiameter was blown clear through the wall, though a solid cartridge of\r\nthe same weight and of the same material produced no material effect.\r\nThe hollow cartridge was made by tying the sticks of dynamite around\r\na tin can, the open mouth of the latter being placed downward, and I\r\nwas led to construct such hollow cartridge for use where a penetrating\r\neffect is desired by the following observations:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLES PRODUCED IN IRON PLATES BY BORED GUN COTTON.]\r\n\r\nIn molding the gun cotton at the torpedo station, as stated above, a\r\nvertical hole was formed in each cylinder or block in which to insert\r\nthe detonator, and in the final press a steel die was laid upon the\r\ncake so that an inscription in letters and figures was forced upon it.\r\nThis inscription was indented in the cylinders and was raised upon the\r\nsurfaces of the blocks. When the gun cotton was fired untamped, in\r\ntesting it, the cylinder or block was usually placed with the inscribed\r\nface resting on a polished iron plate or iron disk, and after firing,\r\nif the gun cotton had detonated it was invariably found that not only\r\nwas a vortex-like cavity produced below the detonator, but that the\r\ninscription on the gun cotton was reproduced on the iron plate, and,\r\nwhat was most singular, when the inscription was indented in the gun\r\ncotton it was indented in the iron plate, and when the inscription was\r\nraised on the surface of the gun cotton it was reproduced raised on\r\nthe surface of the iron plate. In experimentally investigating this\r\nphenomenon I eventually soaked several cylinders in water, so that\r\nI could bore them without danger, and then bored holes of various\r\ndiameters and depths in them, until in the last instance I bored a\r\nvertical hole an inch and three quarters in diameter completely through\r\nthe cylinder. These wet cylinders were each placed on a similar iron\r\nplate, a similar dry disk was placed on each as a primer, and they were\r\nsuccessively fired, when it was found that the deeper and wider the\r\nhole in the gun cotton the deeper and wider were the holes produced\r\nin the iron plate, until when the completely perforated gun cotton\r\ncylinder, from which at least half of the weight of explosive had\r\nbeen removed by the boring, was fired, the iron plate was found to be\r\ncompletely perforated.\r\n\r\nAdvantage was taken of this action of the rapidly moving molecules to\r\nproduce some beautiful effects by interposing laces, coins, leaves from\r\nthe trees, and stencils with various devices cut in them between the\r\nbase of the gun cotton and the iron plate, for after the detonation of\r\nthe gun cotton the objects were found to be reproduced upon the iron\r\nwith the utmost fidelity and in their most delicate parts, and the\r\nimpressions were raised upon the iron as the objects had been before\r\nthe explosion.\r\n\r\nIn one instance a disk of gun cotton was placed in a tin which had\r\nbeen used in canning peas. The disk was covered with water so as to be\r\ncompletely immersed in it, and a second dry disk, with which to fire\r\nit, was placed upon the wet one. The face of the can resting in contact\r\nwith the iron plate was originally the top of the can, through which\r\nthe vegetable had been introduced, and it was consequently grooved\r\nwhere the cover was soldered on, and it also had an irregular drop of\r\nsolder over the vent hole, the solder being raised, therefore, above\r\nthe general level of the face. On firing, the can was completely\r\nvolatilized or comminuted as usual, but the face of the can was\r\nreproduced in every feature and with the original values of the\r\nsurface, the groove being indented in the iron, and the solder being\r\nraised above the rest of the impression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAPLE LEAF REPRODUCED ON IRON PLATE.]\r\n\r\nIn another instance a disk of gun cotton three inches in diameter was\r\nplaced in a tin can five inches in diameter, and the can, which had\r\na smooth bottom, placed on the face of an iron I-beam. The can was\r\nfilled with water so as to just cover the gun cotton, a second dry\r\ngun cotton disk was placed on the wet disk of a primer, both being in\r\nconstant contact with one side of the can, and the system detonated.\r\nAs a result the can and water disappeared and the face of the beam\r\nwas torn off, but on recovering the pieces and matching them it was\r\nfound that not only was the smooth base of the gun cotton and the face\r\nof the can reproduced in the iron, but in the space between the gun\r\ncotton and the side of the can, occupied by the water, three distinct\r\nsets of waves were produced, having an increasing amplitude from the\r\ncenter proceeding outward. It is evident that many curious effects can\r\nbe produced with explosive substances, and I do not doubt that useful\r\napplications will be found through a close study of the phenomena\r\nattending them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA YEAR’S PROGRESS IN THE KLONDIKE.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. ANGELO HEILPRIN.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--Acknowledgment is here made to Mr. E. A. Hegg for the use of\r\n    most of the photographs accompanying this article.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years ago the difficulties of reaching the Klondike were thought to\r\nbe of such a nature as to preclude the probability or even possibility\r\nof Dawson ever becoming a place of permanent habitation. The trials\r\nof the Chilkoot and White Passes were exploited in magazine and\r\njournal from one end of the continent almost to the other, and the\r\nwrecks of humanity, and particularly of the thousands of beasts that\r\nlay scattered along the trail--the tribute to the Sahara turned to\r\nshame--were appealed to as grim testimony of the almost insuperable\r\nbarrier which separated man from the object of his search. To-day,\r\nand since July 6th of the past year (1899), a steam railway traverses\r\nthe full forty-two miles of the White Pass trail, and the traveler\r\nenjoys the beauties of the subarctic landscape in much the way that\r\nhe enjoys the trip through the Alleghany Mountains in the East, or of\r\nthe prairies in the West. Deposited at Bennett, on Lake Bennett, at\r\nvirtually the head of navigation of the mighty Yukon River (otherwise\r\nknown as the Lewes), he engages passage on one of several commodious\r\nsteamers heading down stream or northward, and with one change--at\r\nthe Miles Cañon and White Horse Rapids, where there is a five-mile\r\nportage--reaches Dawson after a voyage, delightful in its change of\r\nscene and novelty of experience, of from four to six days. It is a\r\nfact, therefore, that with a strict timing of departures the traveler\r\nfrom New York may make the journey to Dawson in summer time in twelve\r\ndays, and exceptionally even in less; and the journey has indeed been\r\nmade in eleven days and a half. Such is the change which the effort of\r\nless than two years has accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARTLETT BROTHERS’ PACK TRAIN, DAWSON.]\r\n\r\nThe Dawson of 1899 is no longer the Dawson of 1898, and much less that\r\nof the year previous. The thousands of bateaux that were formerly lined\r\nup against the river front, in rows six deep and more, and comprising\r\nall manner of craft from the small canoe to sliced sections of scows,\r\nhave mostly disappeared, and in their place we now find the graceful\r\nand ungraceful forms of varying types of steamboat. It is no uncommon\r\nthing to find five or more of these larger craft tied up at one time to\r\nthe river front, and the amplitude and majesty of the Mississippi boats\r\ngain but little in a comparison with some of the larger craft of the\r\nYukon River. Overhung signs call attention to the flying queens of the\r\nriver, the Bonanza King, Canadian, and Sibyl, and thousands are offered\r\nupon the result of the race to the White Horse Rapids. So here, as in\r\nthe olden days of the Mississippi, the struggle for supremacy has led\r\nto the opening of the throttle and to the scraping of the fire box.\r\nUpward of a hundred arrivals from down the river were registered at\r\nDawson during the season of open water of 1899.\r\n\r\nDawson has been further put into comparatively close touch with\r\nthe outer world by the entry of the telegraph, and since the early\r\ndays of October messages have been freely going to the seaboard at\r\nSkaguay. It is true that a cableless stretch of hundreds of miles\r\nstill separates this town from the nearest port of importance on the\r\ncontinent, but doubtless before very long even this blank in the line\r\nof communication will have been supplied. It may be first by means\r\nof wireless telegraphy, as it is mooted that the Canadian Government\r\nlooks with favor upon experimentation with the Marconi system; or, what\r\nis more likely, the desired end will be brought about by the laying\r\nof a continuous wire. The extraordinary rapidity with which the five\r\nhundred to six hundred miles of land wire were laid--five and seven\r\nmiles per day--speaks well for the _morale_ of the Canadian sapper and\r\nengineering service.\r\n\r\nIn its commercial and residential aspects the city has made vast\r\nprogress. The days of ingulfing mires are virtually over, and from one\r\nend of the town almost to the other, one may safely tread the streets\r\non secure board sidewalks. Not alone the main street is furnished in\r\nthis way, but also several of the streets running parallel with it, and\r\nparts of streets that run across at right angles. A wise enactment,\r\nnot perhaps absolutely just in its details, has swept off the shacks\r\nand booths from the river side of the front street, and one now enjoys\r\nan almost uninterrupted view of the opposing bank of the stream,\r\nalready marred by giant advertising letters announcing bargain sales in\r\nmerchandise, and directing to particular shops in the metropolis of the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAWSON’S GREAT FIRE, APRIL 26, 1899.]\r\n\r\nThe shops of Dawson have risen to the dignity of establishments having\r\ncorrugated-iron covers, plate-glass fronts, and redwood shelves and\r\ncounters. Following closely upon the pioneer constructions--department\r\nstores, they might be classed--of the Alaska Commercial Company are the\r\ndepots of the North American Trading and Transportation Company, the\r\nAlaska Exploration Company, Ames Mercantile Company, and the Yukoner\r\nCompany, several with retaining warehouses placed beyond the reach of a\r\ncity fire and with dimensions that would lend dignity to locations of\r\nmuch larger size than the emporium of the North. Many of the smaller\r\nshops also carry a varied line of goods, but others are restricted to\r\na specialty, and their wares are now offered at rates which are in the\r\nmain only reasonably in advance of the “high” rates of the Western\r\ncoast towns. There are exceptions to this rule, however, especially\r\nwhere skilled local labor is called into requisition in a manufacture.\r\nThus fourteen dollars for a pair of trousers made to order strikes the\r\nimagination rather forcibly, when a first-grade quality of boot or shoe\r\ncan be obtained for five dollars and six dollars. Really good meals\r\nmay be procured almost everywhere for from a dollar to a dollar and\r\na half, and the best hotels supply twenty-one meals for twenty-five\r\ndollars, and these do not absolutely reject delicacies of one kind\r\nor another. Cow’s milk can now be had as a regular adjunct to coffee,\r\nsince the milcher is no longer a stranger to the country. The price of\r\nrooms in the hotels still remains high--from four to six dollars per\r\nnight, without meals--but the character of these rooms has materially\r\nimproved, even though they would be considered with us decidedly third\r\nrate. In a few establishments of a more private character, lodging for\r\na certain amount of permanency may be had for fifteen dollars the week,\r\nor, where the condition of the surroundings is not closely scanned,\r\nfor even less. A new and capacious hotel, the Hotel Metropole, reared\r\nfrom the wealth of the “King of the Klondike”--Alexander MacDonald--has\r\nrecently been added to those of less pretentious design which served\r\nthe community last year. A heavy cut in rates is promised.\r\n\r\nThe conflagration of April 26th, through which perhaps one quarter\r\nof the business portion of Dawson was burned to the ground, has\r\ngiven opportunity for the introduction of improvements, and the\r\nmost important of these is that which has resulted in the removal\r\nof houses and resorts of evil repute from the heart of the city and\r\nconsigned them and their inmates to a localized area or “tenderloin”\r\ndistrict. Women of refinement may now parade the streets without\r\nhaving their finer sensibilities offended through the public intrusion\r\nof the immorals of the lower world. The tone of the public places of\r\namusement, the theaters and dance houses, has also been in a measure\r\nelevated, even if far from sufficiently so, and some real talent\r\noccasionally sparkles behind the footlights. A new “opera house,” with\r\na seating capacity of perhaps seven hundred or eight hundred, but\r\nadvertised for two thousand, was thrown open to the public last August,\r\nafter a construction, it is claimed, of only two weeks. Its season’s\r\n_répertoire_ included, among other plays, Michael Strogoff and Camille,\r\nboth of which, even in their crudest type of presentation, felt well of\r\nthe public pulse.\r\n\r\nSchool education plays as yet little part in the morals of the\r\nDawsonites. The greed of fortune has left scant time for the\r\nconsideration of educational matters, and what little of school\r\ntraining is imparted to the youth of tender years comes largely in\r\nthe shape of a beneficence from private hands. If the issuance of\r\nnewspapers be properly classed as belonging to education, then Dawson\r\nhas made material advances during the past year, for, in addition to\r\nthe three weeklies which more than supplied all the information that\r\nwas needed to the inhabitants of 1898, it has now a daily (the Dawson\r\nDaily News) and a Sunday paper (The Gleaner), while the pioneer Nugget\r\nhas been converted into a semi-weekly. Some of these journals, which\r\nin typographical detail stand fully equal to many of the foremost\r\njournals of the United States, are devoted largely to a vilification\r\nof the Yukon government, and secondarily to the nonpartisan interests\r\nof the community. But little space is given over to murders and daring\r\ndeeds of robbery, since occurrences of this kind, thanks to the\r\ncontinued vigilance and efficiency of the Northwest Mounted Police, are\r\nall but unknown, and the safety of possessions is as well established\r\nas that of the person. The shooting of an actress by her lover,\r\nfollowed by the suicide of the murderer, furnished the sensation for\r\nthe year; but previous suicides, also in the ranks of the theatrical\r\nprofession, had already paved a way to this form of excitement.\r\n\r\nTwo or more lines of telephone unite Dawson with the nearer mining\r\nregion, and a partial city service has also been established. The\r\ncity remains as yet without an electric-light plant, but it is by no\r\nmeans unlikely that before the present season has passed the darkness\r\nof the winter night will be lifted by the arc light, and much of\r\nthe oppressiveness of the closed season thereby removed. After two\r\nwinters of experience, the Dawsonites continue to think lightly of\r\nthe “terrors” of the cold, and to but few apparently is the extreme\r\nof temperature a deterrent to exercise. Sleighing continues to be a\r\npastime, with the temperature marking 40° to 50° below zero, but only\r\nwith this season does it enter into the category of a fashionable\r\nrecreation. Hitherto dog-sled teams performed the full service of\r\nwinter travel, and divided with skating and “ski”-ing the winter\r\nexercise; but this year the snow causeways will be lively with the\r\njingling of cutter bells and the rapid pacing of the horse.\r\n\r\nOne can not help remarking the vast improvement in the general tone of\r\nDawson society, if by that term we may include all that constitutes\r\nthe population of the city. More particularly is this marked in the\r\ncase of women, among whom it is no longer a rarity to meet with\r\nstrict refinement and culture. Musical _soirées_ register among the\r\nevents of the week, and literary recitals are not exceptional. The\r\nmale portion of the population has also undergone a refining process\r\nthrough the departure of hundreds or even thousands of “bums,” who\r\nonly too late for their comfort discovered that their presence was\r\nneither a necessity to Dawson nor a mainspring to the extraction of\r\ngold from the soil. By their departure the city has probably suffered\r\na decrease in its population of some three thousand to four thousand,\r\nbut has more than received compensation in that stability of purpose\r\nwhich such elimination always insures. As a city of about thirteen\r\nthousand inhabitants, it enters upon its history in the year 1900 with\r\nprinciples cast largely upon a pure business basis, and with a future\r\nthat is bound in with the product of the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIDNIGHT VIEW OF DAWSON, JUNE 21, 1899.]\r\n\r\nThe gold resource of the Klondike region seems fully to sustain the\r\nanticipations which had been put forth touching the product of 1899.\r\nThe better-known creeks, such as the Bonanza, Eldorado, and Hunker,\r\nhave kept well up with their record of the previous year, and give\r\nindications of continuing as important factors in the calculation of\r\noutput for some time to come in the future. The introduction of a\r\ncertain amount of mining machinery, such as steam drills, thawers,\r\nand powerful pumps--applied more particularly to the deposits of\r\nthe benches and hillsides--coupled with a more definite method of\r\nconducting extensive operations on a comparatively economic basis,\r\nhas given fresh impetus to the work of mine holders, and made largely\r\nremunerative that which had promised to be little profitable. A more\r\njust administration of the mining laws has helped to a considerate\r\nfeeling among the miners, and reduced very materially the grievances\r\nwhich formerly fell with thick force upon the offices of the Recorder\r\nand Gold Commissioner. Access is now easily had to the records of\r\nclaims, and individual “cases” receive an early and proper hearing.\r\nElectric plants have been introduced on some of the claims, so that\r\nthere need be no interruption in work for the full twenty-four hours of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nApart from the discovery of rich pay-dirt on creeks and gulches,\r\nsuch as Last Chance (tributary to Hunker), Gold Bottom (tributary to\r\nSulphur), and American, Magnet, and Adams (tributary to the Bonanza),\r\nconcerning which much skepticism was expressed last year, the filling\r\nin of assumed barren gaps in the general line of creeks has done much\r\nto inspire the feeling that more of the broad area is gold-bearing\r\nthan the first surveys and explorations “indicated”--a feeling to\r\nwhich particular confidence has been given by the surprising wealth\r\nwhich has been washed out from the hillsides. For a nearly continuous\r\nfour miles of the “left limit” of the Bonanza, extending northward\r\nfrom Gold Hill at the confluence of the Eldorado to the “forties below\r\ndiscovery,” the crests of the hills at an elevation of some one hundred\r\nand eighty to two hundred feet above the creek are laid bare with the\r\nwork of the shovel, pick, and drill, and the same or a corresponding\r\nstratigraphical height is pierced elsewhere along the stream. Gold\r\nHill (and French Hill, on the Eldorado side), Skookum, Adams, Magnet,\r\nand American Hills, and Monte Cristo, all have their summits capped by\r\nwhat is now familiarly known as the “white layer”--a feature in the\r\nlandscape as interesting to the casual tourist as the construction is\r\nimportant to the more fortunate claim holders who are located here.\r\n\r\nUp to this time no quartz locations determined to be of positive value\r\nhave been located, although a goodly number of “quartz reefs,” “lodes,”\r\nand kidney masses have been staked, restaked, and recorded. Some of\r\nthese have shown gold in small quantity, but in by far the greater\r\nnumber of cases they have proved absolutely barren, and are without\r\npromise of yielding anything. The anticipation of many, naturally\r\nfostered by individual wish and hope, that an originating or “mother”\r\nlode must be present and found somewhere rests without any geological\r\nsupport so far as evidence has been accumulated up to the present\r\ntime, and there is nothing that looks like a promise to the geological\r\neye. At the same time, it would be premature to assert that such a reef\r\nor series of reefs may not be discovered in the future. The hill crests\r\nthat have furnished so much of the white material of the high benches\r\nof the Bonanza and the Eldorado may perhaps be searched with best\r\nadvantage in this direction, and thence extended to the water parting\r\nwhich surrounds or incloses the upper waters of Gay Gulch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLUMBIAN AND THE ELDORADO STARTING FROM DAWSON,\r\nJULY 4, 1899, ON A RACE TO WHITE HORSE RAPIDS.]\r\n\r\nNo estimate, naturally, can yet be put to the total gold supply of\r\nthe Klondike region, but to inquiry that is frequently put regarding\r\nthe future existence of Dawson as an energetic mining camp one can\r\nunhesitatingly answer that this existence is assured for many years to\r\ncome, and there are indications that point to a permanence independent\r\nof the simple supply of gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET SCENE, DAWSON, JULY, 1899.]\r\n\r\nThe earlier conceptions of the extreme severity of the climate of the\r\nYukon Valley forbade the hope of agricultural possibilities, but a more\r\nintimate knowledge of the conditions prevailing in the summer time--a\r\nseason of four to five months’ duration, with daylight and day heat\r\nprotracted far into the normal hours of night--and a comparison of\r\nthese conditions with somewhat similar conditions prevailing elsewhere,\r\nhave given hope not alone of a possibility, but of a probability, and\r\nthere are few to-day who doubt that agriculture may not be practiced\r\nwith at least a legitimate amount of success in many parts of the Yukon\r\nbasin. This probability has, indeed, been already emphasized by Prof.\r\nGeorge Dawson, and the more recent examinations of Alaskan territory,\r\nmade by Colonels Ray and Abercrombie, confirm with a conviction the\r\nreference to American soil. The feeble but more than promising efforts\r\nin agriculture and gardening that were made in the region about Dawson\r\nin 1898 have borne surprising fruit in 1899, and while the results may\r\nnot, for various reasons, have proved in all cases remunerative to\r\nthe “prospector,” they at least clearly demonstrate the possibilities\r\nto which the future may lay claim. Cabbages, turnips, peas, radishes,\r\nlettuce, and beans are now raised to perfection in favored spots along\r\nthe Yukon and Klondike, and on scattered hillsides of the Bonanza and\r\nEldorado, and a good promise is also held out for the potato. In the\r\ncharming spot known as the Acklin Garden, situated on the Klondike\r\nabout two miles from Dawson, oats and barley, sown on April 26th\r\nand May 22d respectively (1899), were grown to beautiful heads, and\r\nharvested in the middle of August. No wheat had ripened up to that\r\ntime, and I suspect that, owing to a light frost which took place\r\non the 19th of the same month, none of this grain came to maturity.\r\nRadishes sown on April 24th were collected on May 20th, and string\r\nbeans, whose seed was scattered on May 26th, were collected on August\r\n1st. Other successful crops were those of beets, onions, and spinach.\r\n\r\nThe exquisite beauty of the flower garden in this spot rivets the\r\nattention of all passers-by, and few there are who do not for a moment\r\nlay aside their packs to enjoy the feast of color that is presented\r\nto them. Poppies of the size and brilliance of those which adorn the\r\nfields about Naples, chrysanthemums, gorgeous dahlias, pansies, the\r\ncornflower, mignonette, and centaurea are part of the outside bloom,\r\nto which Nature “beyond the fence” has fittingly added the wild rose,\r\nanemone, fireweed, and forget-me-not. Such is the aspect of the region\r\nwhich to-day illumines the far North, and carries with itself a hopeful\r\npromise to many and the certainty of disappointment to many more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECLINE OF CRIMINAL JURISPRUDENCE IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nBY GINO C. SPERANZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rights of personal security, personal liberty, and private property\r\nhave been called the “rights of the people of England,” and may be\r\nsaid to constitute the richest heirloom in the Anglo-Saxon family.\r\nWhile, in a certain sense, they belong to all civilized people, yet,\r\nin their practical application, they are peculiarly the creation of\r\nAnglo-Saxon common sense and love of order. The underlying principle of\r\nthese rights, clothed by the Latins in the seductive garb of _Liberté_,\r\n_Egalité_, _Fraternité_, gave us a Reign of Terror, a Commune, and\r\nfinally a doubtful republicanism; but the same principle, embodied in\r\nthe less dazzling formula, “That no man shall be deprived of life,\r\nliberty, or property without due process of law,” produced in the hands\r\nof the Anglo-Saxons more enduring democracies “of the people, by the\r\npeople, and for the people.”\r\n\r\nWith the instinct of a race born for self-government, the Anglo-Saxons\r\nhave ever sought and almost always found the highest safeguard\r\nfor their ancient rights in the courts of law. Between a partisan\r\nLegislature and a tyrannical Executive an honest judiciary has\r\ngenerally been found ready to annul the excesses of the one and to\r\nprevent any infringement by the other; so that it has become a belief,\r\nhaving the force of faith, that in our courts will be found the bulwark\r\nof those liberties which we consider essential to the full enjoyment of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nLaws and courts, however, are after all the creation of men, and, like\r\nall such creations, they are necessarily imperfect and fallible; or,\r\nmore correctly, they are organisms which develop and improve. In other\r\nwords, justice and law are only relatively immutable and perfect.\r\nThey do, indeed, represent, in a sense, abstract perfection, and at\r\nany given time they must be considered the highest criterion of human\r\nconduct. But justice and law are not such divinities that they can\r\nwithdraw themselves from the operation of those forces which we call\r\nprogress. Seriousness, dignity, and venerability are not sufficient\r\nto sustain the majesty of the law; it needs also adaptation to those\r\nhigher conditions and broader views which mark the growth of human\r\nthought. The more we come to look upon law as the standard and gauge of\r\nupright human action, the more do we grow to expect it in consonance\r\nwith the highest dictates of human knowledge and reason, for what is\r\nabove us must represent what is best in us, else it will be neither\r\nrespected nor obeyed. Whenever this consonance is not found, human\r\nbelief in the dignity of the law and in the efficacy of justice ceases.\r\nFor, theoretically at least, law is so near ideal perfection that the\r\nleast defect destroys it entirely; and by this “ideal perfection” is\r\nmeant that _laws must reflect the highest and soundest thought of\r\nevery age_. Laws that fail in this cease to be a power for good; they\r\nare then looked upon either as ridiculous or as oppressive. If the\r\nformer, they defeat their ends by becoming dead laws; if the latter,\r\nthey become a source of disorder and discontent. Hence we see that\r\njurisprudence is essentially evolutionary and progressive, and that\r\nthe majesty of the law does not lie in its age but in its perennial\r\nyouth, or, more correctly, in its successive rejuvenescence. It is\r\ntrue that in China the antiquity of a law is its highest prestige,\r\nbut, as a consequence, Chinese justice is proverbially inefficient and\r\nbarbarous. It therefore follows that the constant study and improvement\r\nof what we have called the safeguards of our fundamental rights should\r\nbe our highest duty, and the object of the care and solicitude of the\r\nState. It is not enough to rest contentedly in the thought that a Magna\r\nCharta, a Petition of Rights, and sundry written constitutions protect\r\nus. Their very existence is but an argument for our eternal vigilance.\r\nNow, the question to be here examined is whether we have exercised that\r\ncare and vigilance which are essential to the free enjoyment of our\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nLet me premise the statement that the protection of the rights of life,\r\nliberty, and property is peculiarly within the province of the criminal\r\nlaw. What constitutes the right of life, liberty, and property can not\r\nbe defined or described, except negatively by a definition of what will\r\nbe deemed its infringements. These we call crimes. To declare what\r\nacts come within the definition of such crimes is the function of the\r\ncriminal courts.\r\n\r\nIt is upon the criminal law, therefore, that we must rely for the\r\nenunciation of what acts shall constitute a breach of the right of\r\nlife, liberty, and property, and it is to the criminal bench and bar\r\nthat we must turn for the correct interpretation and application of\r\nsuch enunciations. Hence the more time and attention we devote to the\r\nstudy of criminal legislation and to the enlightenment of the criminal\r\nbench and bar, the more will the safety of our rights be increased and\r\nstrengthened. Likewise, the more we allow criminal legislation to be\r\nthe product of hasty consideration and the criminal bar to drift into\r\ndisrepute, the more the safety of our rights will be proportionally\r\nweakened.\r\n\r\nThe first question that presents itself is, “_What is done by\r\nour law schools for the study of criminal law?_” The answer is\r\nnot very encouraging. Let us take those law schools which are of\r\nmost importance, either by reason of their curriculum or of their\r\nattendance. Harvard, with a three years’ course, devotes two hours\r\na week for one year to criminal law (including criminal procedure).\r\nAllowing nine months of four weeks each to the scholastic year, and\r\na weekly average of eighteen hours, it will be found that the time\r\ndevoted to the study of criminal law (including procedure) is a little\r\nover _three per cent_ of the entire course. By a similar computation\r\nwe find that Columbia devotes to criminal law (and procedure) a\r\nlittle over _four per cent_ of the entire course, which is about\r\nthe percentage given by Yale and a little lower than that of the\r\nUniversities of Michigan, Cornell, and New York respectively.\r\n\r\nThese computations are based upon figures given in the catalogues of\r\nthose universities, or kindly furnished by the deans. Nothing more\r\neloquent of the decline of the study of criminal jurisprudence in our\r\ncountry could be cited. But the catalogues of these law schools add\r\nfurther proof. At none of them is there a professor whose instruction\r\nis confined solely to criminal law. Nearly all the instructors in\r\ncriminal law devote but a small part of their time (and probably\r\nof their study) to the teaching of this subject. In Columbia the\r\ninstructor in criminal law is professor of international law and\r\ndiplomacy;[I] at Harvard the incumbent of the chair of criminal law\r\nteaches the law of carriers; that of Michigan teaches the law of bills\r\nand notes and of public corporations; that of the New York University\r\nthe law of sales and wills. It is, moreover, a significant fact that\r\nthe faculties of the above-named institutions, while recommending to\r\nlaw students the optional study of political economy, constitutional\r\nhistory, taxation, physical science, English literature, and modern\r\nlanguages as conducive to a higher standard of legal culture, utterly\r\nfail to advise them to pursue courses in criminal anthropology,\r\ncriminology, or penology. In other words, it is deemed advisable that\r\nthe future lawyer should bring to the aid of his civil practice the\r\ncomplementary knowledge of French and history, for instance, but it\r\nis of no importance that he should be acquainted with the results of\r\nmodern criminologic and penologic research. Thus the conclusion is\r\nforced upon us that the study of criminal law, whose importance I have\r\nendeavored to set forth, has become a subject at sufferance in our\r\nuniversities, a practically optional course of little consequence to\r\nthe student, and of no interest to the teacher.\r\n\r\n    [I] This has since been changed; but the change makes the case\r\n        worse, as the new instructor in criminal law teaches not\r\n        only two branches of the law (as under last year’s course),\r\n        but five--viz., Criminal Law, Wills and Administration,\r\n        Common-Law Practice and Pleading Bankruptcy, and Bailments\r\n        and Carriers.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of his legal career the future lawyer is\r\nmade to feel that the field of criminal law is not the one in which\r\nto exercise his best talents. Both the school curriculum and popular\r\nsentiment strengthen this prejudice. To the community at large our\r\ncriminal courts have come to mean places where criminals are sentenced\r\nor rogues saved on technicalities; they have ceased to be centers of\r\njustice, where innocent men are saved and guilty men tried according\r\nto the law of the land. Hence has arisen the popular belief (despite\r\nthe rule that the accused shall be considered innocent until his guilt\r\nis proved), shared in a measure by the bench and bar, that every\r\nman accused of crime is criminal and depraved, and that, therefore,\r\ncontact with him should be avoided. Thus the criminal lawyer, who\r\nnecessarily must come in touch with such alleged crime and depravity,\r\nis practically ostracized not only from the community but also from the\r\ncivil forum.\r\n\r\nThe existence of such prejudice against the criminal bar is most\r\ndeplorable. Men of ability and position will shun criminal practice,\r\nleaving the field clear to unscrupulous shysters. Let it be remembered\r\nthat to a man charged with the commission of a crime and deprived\r\nof his liberty the lawyer appears a savior; that the accused is\r\npractically at his lawyer’s mercy, being under most trying duress and\r\nvery easily influenced. The temptation for unprofessional dealing is\r\nhere at its highest, because of the manifest advantage of the lawyer\r\nwho is able, or whom the client believes to be able, to unlock the\r\nprison doors. It takes men of more than ordinary fiber to persistently\r\nresist such temptation in all its forms. Hence the necessity of upright\r\nand learned men at the criminal bar. But how few are our great criminal\r\npractitioners! How often have I heard lawyers, too young and clientless\r\nto allow themselves preferences, declare most decidedly that they were\r\nwilling to do anything “except criminal law”! They had been trained to\r\nlook upon it not merely as inferior but as degrading practice. Yet it\r\nis common knowledge that in European countries, where less boast is\r\nmade of inalienable rights, it is the ambition of all lawyers to get a\r\nreputation at the criminal bar. It is there, in fact, that reputations\r\nare made.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise in those countries where many would make us believe\r\nthat life, liberty, and property are not as sacredly guarded as in our\r\nown country, that the criminal laws are a constant object of scholarly\r\nstudy and investigation. The great progress made in the study of crime,\r\nthe building up of a criminal science and a criminal sociology, is\r\nalmost exclusively the work of Continental criminologists. Penology\r\nhas indeed engaged our attention, but criminology has been almost\r\npractically ignored by us.\r\n\r\nOf criminal law it was long ago said that, “by reason of the numberless\r\nunforeseen events which the compass of a day may bring forth,” the\r\nknowledge of its provisions “is a matter of universal concern.” Yet,\r\ndespite this “universal concern,” our criminal law has been and still\r\nis inferior to our civil law. I have pointed out at the beginning of\r\nthis article how the majesty of the law depended essentially upon its\r\never-recurring rejuvenescence; that law was a living organism, subject\r\nto change and the forces of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe theories on criminal responsibility and on crime in general, in the\r\nlight of modern medical, anthropologic, and sociologic sciences, have\r\ncompletely supplanted the old doctrines, yet criminal legislation has\r\napparently taken no notice of them. Modern science tells us that our\r\nantiquated tests of criminal responsibility result in sending hundreds\r\nof men to prison who ought to be sent to asylums, but we do nothing to\r\navoid this scandal. Under our system the courts are obliged to let the\r\nconclusions of the learned judges who occupied the bench three hundred\r\nyears ago have more weight than the positive investigations of the men\r\nof science of our day, and so, consciously or unconsciously, numberless\r\ncrimes are committed in the name of _stare decisis_. True it is that in\r\nsome jurisdictions, and notably in New York, the courts have recognized\r\nto some extent the progress of science and its influence upon juridic\r\ntheories. But even in these cases the concession has been made only\r\nin _civil_ cases. Thus Mr. Bishop, in his Criminal Law, is obliged to\r\npoint out that our courts recognize _two kinds of insanity_--to wit,\r\n_civil and criminal irresponsibility_. Why the test to be applied\r\nin the case of the validity of a will should be different from that\r\napplied in the case of murder does not seem very clear. The scientific\r\ntest as to insanity has been oftentimes recognized and applied by our\r\ncivil tribunals, but the criminal judges still cling with unabashed\r\nattachment to the unscientific and unprogressive rule in McNaughten’s\r\ncase. The Guiteau trial, which followed that celebrated decision, added\r\nfresh authority to the English view, and practically made the rule to\r\nbe applied in criminal trials a legal dogma.\r\n\r\nIn an able and exhaustive paper by Mr. J. H. Dougherty on this very\r\nsubject, before the Society of Medical Jurisprudence, the evils of\r\nsuch dogmatism in criminal law are strikingly set forth. “Life,” he\r\nsaid, “should be as sacred as property. While society needs protection\r\nfrom the criminal, it does not require that the protection should be\r\ninsured through the application of a fallacious and discredited legal\r\ndogma.”\r\n\r\nThis is but one example of the unprogressiveness of our criminal\r\njurisprudence. Yet, if we really have the ancient principle of the\r\nright of life and liberty at heart we ought to recognize that this\r\nlegal dogma is a greater menace to the practical abrogation of the\r\nright than the despotism of an unscrupulous executive. For while the\r\nlatter is an infringement of a right which the law forbids, the former\r\nis a breach of a right which the law sanctions. Again, the theories\r\nregarding the object of penal provisions have entirely changed.\r\nPunishment has been scientifically shown to be practically useless\r\neither as a deterrent or as a correctional remedy. Yet our penal codes\r\nare confessedly based on the idea of punishment and retribution. We\r\nhave indeed made some little headway, such as indeterminate sentences\r\nand suspension of judgment, but only in a scattered and tentative way.\r\n\r\nThe additions to or changes in our criminal codes have been unimportant\r\nand unprogressive. What additions are made are slipshod in their\r\nmake-up, at times partisan in intent, seldom in harmony with the\r\nteachings of modern science, and oftentimes in disregard of fundamental\r\nprinciples. Our legislators grant “hearings” before passing a law\r\naffecting the business of a few privileged men and give it due weight;\r\nbut criminal bills, which may affect the public, are generally “rushed\r\nthrough,” probably because of an absolute lack of interest. This is but\r\na repetition of Blackstone’s complaint against criminal legislation in\r\nhis day. “It is never usual in the House of Commons,” he wrote, “even\r\nto read a bill which may affect the property of an individual without\r\nfirst referring it to some of the learned judges and hearing their\r\nreport thereon. And surely equal precaution is necessary when laws are\r\nto be established which may affect the property, liberty, and perhaps\r\nthe lives of thousands.” And he thus concludes his observations: “The\r\nenacting of penalties to which a whole nation should be subject ought\r\nnot to be left as a matter of indifference to the passions or interests\r\nof a few, who upon temporary motives may prefer or support such a bill.”\r\n\r\nThe lack of public interest and of intelligent consideration by the\r\npeople and the bar in criminal problems and criminal legislation are\r\nclearly shown by the paucity of criminal statistical data furnished by\r\nvarious States.\r\n\r\nPenological research is based on an intelligent study of statistics,\r\nand civilized nations, recognizing this fact, have provided elaborate\r\nsystems of records based on the suggestions of statistical science.\r\nBut with us statistical facilities in the field of crime are not\r\nmerely primitive or old-fashioned, but in many cases shamefully\r\nabsent. In reply to requests addressed to the Secretaries of State of\r\nvarious States for official statistics of crimes committed in their\r\nrespective jurisdictions, the answers I received were in a number of\r\ncases negative. The officials mentioned replied that no statistics\r\nwere published by the State in Illinois, Georgia, New Jersey,\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, Maryland, Vermont, California, Idaho, Missouri,\r\nSouth Carolina, Connecticut, Texas, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Mississippi,\r\nVirginia, Colorado, and Kansas. It is true that in some of these\r\nStates this lacuna is filled in by special prison reports or reports\r\nof commissioners or of the attorneys-general. But even in these cases,\r\nas well as in those published officially by the State (Ohio, Indiana,\r\nNew York, Massachusetts, and Louisiana), the information furnished is a\r\nmonument of antiquated methods and of very little value to the student\r\nof criminology. How, then, can we study the grave questions of crime\r\nand criminals without a basis of computation?\r\n\r\nIt may be true, as some claim, that Continental jurists have refined\r\nthe criminal law to an unpractical degree and too much on classic and\r\ntheoretic lines, but it will not be claimed that by adhering to an\r\nold-fashioned and obsolete criminal jurisprudence the Anglo-Saxons\r\nare safeguarding their fundamental liberties. That there is something\r\nessentially wrong, or at least antiquated, with our criminal law is\r\nevidenced by the popular discontent against it, which is too widespread\r\nand insistent to be the result of ignorance or sentiment. If there is\r\ninertia as to changes in the law it is probably because, while feeling\r\nthat there is something wrong, the people either can not define it or\r\nthe conservatism of centuries in this field is unconsciously affecting\r\ntheir better intentions. Who will deny (and I address this question\r\nto lawyers and judges) that, under our system, guilty men escape and\r\ninnocent men suffer in larger numbers than it should be, even allowing\r\nfor the defects inherent in all human systems?--that technicalities and\r\nnot facts often save scoundrels; that unscrupulous lawyers do not avoid\r\nthem, and the best of judges are obliged by legal dogmas to respect\r\nthem? Who will deny (and I address this question to sociologists\r\nand penologists) that the penal provisions of our present laws are\r\ninappropriate, inelastic, and unscientific; that they neither prevent\r\nnor reform; and that the basic principle of our penal codes is still\r\nretribution and punishment? Can it be that the right of life, liberty,\r\nand property is becoming a pious fraud? Of course, it is not claimed\r\nthat we have less liberty now than our fathers had three centuries\r\nago; progress never stops, and each day is something gained; but it\r\nseems clear that the juridic basis and form of our liberties have\r\nnot kept up with the progress of those very liberties. Yet, what we\r\ncall rights must have a counterpart or reflection in our laws. We may,\r\nwhile enjoying those rights, forget that the juridic basis on which\r\nthey stand is crumbling with age. Unless that basis is rejuvenated the\r\nentire edifice must eventually fall. While we are in full possession of\r\nour rights we need no laws to guarantee them; but it is when those laws\r\nare encroached upon that there arises the necessity of juridic sanction\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nThe right of life, liberty, and property constitutes the essence of\r\nthe “law of the land.” But the conception of rights, as we have seen,\r\nchanges and progresses. The law of the land must likewise change and\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nLaws may be the highest and best creation of man’s intellect, but they\r\nare not “hedged in by any divinity.” That is why they are neither\r\ninfallible nor unchangeable. Yet, as the highest and best creation of\r\nman’s intellect, and as the final criterion of human public conduct,\r\nthey should conform to the best thought and to the highest scientific\r\nprogress. If they do not approach this standard they are worse than\r\nuseless, for they become legalized means of oppression. It is then that\r\nJustice needs a bandage over her eyes, not to avoid partiality, but to\r\nhide her shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLIND FISHES OF NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nBY CARL H. EIGENMANN,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF ZOÖLOGY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n    “An investigation into the history of degenerate forms often\r\n    teaches us more of the causes of change in organic Nature than can\r\n    be learned by the study of the progressive ones.”--WEISMANN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe caves of the United States are inhabited by three cave salamanders,\r\ntwo of them with degenerate eyes; by six cave fishes, all with impaired\r\nvision--five of them with rudimentary eyes, one with eyes the most\r\ndegenerate among vertebrates; and by several mammals. It is thus seen\r\nthat among the interesting features of the North American fauna the\r\nblind vertebrates are not the least. Yet during the past twenty-five\r\nyears the only additions to our knowledge, aside from diagnoses of new\r\nspecies, have been a few random notes on the habits and a short account\r\nof the eye of Troglichthys by Kohl.\r\n\r\nVarious classes of vertebrates have blind members, but no large\r\nvertebrate has become blind or permanently taken up its home in caves.\r\nBlatchley reports that a number of cats have established themselves\r\nin Wyandotte Cave, where they bring forth and rear their young. They\r\nhave exterminated the cave rats, and now station themselves in a narrow\r\npassage of the cave and capture bats as they fly through.\r\n\r\nAmong the permanent residents in dark places we have, among mammals,\r\nthe moles, which habitually live in burrows of their own make. In\r\nMammoth Cave lives a rat--Neotoma pennsylvanica. In Marengo Cave,\r\nIndiana, white-footed mice have established themselves. Although with\r\nunimpaired eyes, they have acquired ears and whiskers longer than the\r\nrest of their kind living outside.\r\n\r\nIn Florida occurs a blind lizard--Rhineura floridana. It burrows in the\r\nground, and is colorless and blind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--The cave salamander of the Mississippi Valley\r\n\r\n(_Spelerpes maculicauda_).]\r\n\r\nOf salamanders, one blind species lives in European caves. In the\r\nlarge caves of the eastern United States no blind salamanders have\r\nbeen found, although other species, especially Spelerpes maculicauda,\r\nabound. In the caves of Missouri a veiled-eyed salamander,\r\nTyphlotriton, has been described within recent years by Stejneger.\r\nStill another salamander, Typhlomolge, having rudimentary eyes, has\r\nbeen cast up from an artesian well at San Marcos, Texas, and occurs in\r\nthe cave streams about that place.\r\n\r\nThe most abundant of the blind vertebrates, both in individuals and\r\nin species, are the blind fishes. These, from their geographical\r\ndistribution, may be separated into three groups: (1) Those inhabiting\r\nthe depths of the ocean; (2) those inhabiting dark places along the\r\nshores of the ocean; (3) those inhabiting the underground fresh waters.\r\n\r\nThe fishes, blind or partially blind, living in the depths of the ocean\r\nbordering the American continents, are as follows: 1. Ipnops Murrayi\r\nGünther lives at depths varying from 955 fathoms to 2,158 and has the\r\nvery wide distribution suggested by the localities from which specimens\r\nhave been secured--viz., off the coast of Brazil, near Tristan da\r\nCumba, near Celebes, latitude 24° 36′ north, longitude 84° 51′ west,\r\nand off Bequia. This is the only vertebrate in which no vestige of an\r\neye has been found. Ipnops stands alone in a family. 2. The Brotulidæ\r\nhave several members blind or with very much reduced eyes in various\r\nparts of the globe. Aphyonus mollis G. and B., 955 fathoms, and\r\nAlexeterion parfaiti Vaillant, 5,005 metres, are the only ones found\r\nin the neighborhood of America. 3. The Lophiidæ are represented by\r\nMancalias Schufeldtii Gill, from a depth of 372 fathoms. Other blind\r\nspecies are found in foreign waters, while others with small eyes\r\nare found in American waters. The majority of deep-sea fishes have\r\nwell-developed eyes.\r\n\r\nThe shore fishes have their blind representative in Typhlogobius\r\ncaliforniensis St., which lives under rocks between tide water on the\r\ncoast of southern and Lower California. I have elsewhere described\r\nthe habits of this form. In the fresh-water caves of Cuba two blind\r\nfishes--Stygicola denta Poey and Lucifuga subterraneus Poey--have been\r\nfound. Their relatives live in the ocean, Brotula barbata in Cuban\r\nwaters; some of the others are blind and inhabitants of deep water.\r\n\r\nThe inland fresh-water fishes are represented by Gronias nigrilabris\r\nCope, a catfish from cave streams of eastern Pennsylvania, and by\r\nmembers of the Amblyopsidæ, concerning which a more detailed account is\r\ngiven below.\r\n\r\nTHE AMBLYOPSIDÆ.--The Amblyopsidæ are a small family of fishes allied\r\nto the Cyprinodontidæ. They are found in the Mississippi drainage\r\nbasin and in certain southeastern streams. Three of the members of\r\nthe family, the Chologasters, are provided with well-developed eyes,\r\nwhile four other species are cave fishes in the strictest sense, being\r\nblind and colorless. The distribution of the different members of the\r\nAmblyopsidæ is as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--The larva and adult of the Missouri cave\r\nsalamander (_Typhlotriton_).]\r\n\r\nChologaster cornutus is found in lowland swamps of the Southern States\r\nfrom the Dismal Swamp to the Okefinokee Swamp. Chologaster Agassizii is\r\nfound in subterranean streams in Tennessee and Kentucky. Chologaster\r\npapilliferus has so far been found only in southwestern Illinois.\r\n\r\nAmblyopsis is abundant in the cave streams of the Ohio Valley south of\r\nthe east fork of White River.\r\n\r\nTyphlichthys subterraneus inhabits the region south of the Ohio and\r\neast of the Mississippi. A single specimen of another Typhlichthys\r\nhas been found north of the Ohio River in a well at Corydon, Indiana.\r\nTroglichthys rosæ inhabits the caves west of the Mississippi in\r\nArkansas and Missouri.\r\n\r\nCHOLOGASTER.--Mr. E. B. Forbes secured a school of Chologaster\r\npapilliferus for me, and he wrote: “The little fishes were found\r\nunder stones at the edges of the spring very close to the bluff, and\r\nwhen disturbed they swam back under the cliff.... None were found at\r\nany considerable distance from the face of the cliff.” I found the\r\nChologaster Agassizii to act similarly in the river Styx, in Mammoth\r\nCave. As soon as my net touched the water they darted in under the\r\nledge of rock at the side of the little pool in which I found them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Blind salamander from an artesian well at San\r\nMarcos, Texas (_Typhlomolge_).]\r\n\r\nChologaster papilliferus detects its food entirely by the sense of\r\ntouch. Two which were kept in an aquarium for over a year were starved\r\nfor a few days. They became very nervous, continually swimming along\r\nthe sides of the aquarium. Asellus was introduced. These, even if quite\r\nnear, produced no effect if moving in front of the Chologaster. The\r\nmoment one came in close proximity to the fish from any direction, by\r\na flashlike motion it was seized. None of them were swallowed. The\r\nfish became very alert after the introduction of the sowbugs, and\r\nwhen swimming forward would strike at a part of a leaf if it came in\r\ncontact with the head of the fish. It seemed evident that the eye\r\ngave no information of the character of the object. As Asellus was\r\nnot altogether to their taste, Gammarus was introduced. One of these\r\nswimming rapidly toward the chin of the Chologaster from behind and\r\nbelow was instantly seized when it came in contact with the fish. The\r\neye could not have located the Gammarus at all. The action is in very\r\nstrong contrast to the action of a sunfish, which detects its food by\r\nthe sight. It is undoubtedly this peculiar method of locating and\r\nsecuring food which has enabled the Amblyopsidæ to establish themselves\r\nin caves.\r\n\r\nThe Chologaster in general make-up is like Amblyopsis, but is somewhat\r\nlonger-jointed. It sits with its pectorals extended. When it moves\r\nhorizontally for some distance the pectorals are usually pressed to the\r\nsides, the propelling being done largely by the tail very much after\r\nthe manner of a salamander, which it resembles. In swimming toward the\r\nsurface it uses its pectoral fins chiefly, and the fish usually sinks\r\nto the bottom as soon as its efforts to raise itself are stopped.\r\n\r\nIndividuals kept in aquaria with one end darkened either collected in\r\nthe darkened area floating about, or under leaves or sticks in any part\r\nof the aquarium. They are frequently found under a floating board,\r\nwhere they float with the tops of their heads in contact with the\r\nboard, their bodies slanting downward. They seek the dark, regardless\r\nof the direction of the rays of light. These characteristics they\r\nhave, in great part, in common with the blind members of the family.\r\nThe adult Amblyopsis frequently floats with its head to the top of\r\nthe water, the tail sloping downward, and in swimming along ledges of\r\nrock the top of the head is applied to the ledge. I have captured many\r\nspecimens simply by scraping my net along the surface of a ledge.\r\n\r\nTyphlichthys, living in total darkness, has retained the habit of\r\nstaying under floating boards, sticks, and stones. Miss Hoppin noticed\r\nthat Troglichthys swims with its back to the sides of the aquarium, and\r\nI have repeatedly noted the same in the young of Amblyopsis up to fifty\r\nmillimetres, and the still younger Amblyopsis frequently hides under\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAMBLYOPSIS.--The general impression given by Amblyopsis is that of\r\na skinned catfish swimming on its back. The expressions, “They are\r\ncatfish”; “They look as though they were skinned”; “They are swimming\r\non their backs,” are heard from those who see these fishes for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\nThe largest individual secured by me measured 135 millimetres in total\r\nlength. Individuals as large as this are rare. The usual length of an\r\nadult is about 90 millimetres. One individual was mentioned to me at\r\nMammoth Cave having a length of 200 millimetres!\r\n\r\nAmblyopsis is found in pools in the cave streams it inhabits. I have\r\nsecured as many as twelve from a pool perhaps ten by fifty feet in\r\nsize. Very rarely they are to be found in the riffles connecting the\r\npools. I have seen them lying at the bottom, or swimming, or rather\r\ngliding, through the water like “white aquatic ghosts.” In the aquarium\r\nthey lie at the bottom or at various depths in the water, their axes\r\nmaking various angles with the horizontal, their pectorals folded to\r\ntheir sides. When swimming slowly it is chiefly by the use of the\r\npectorals. The strokes of the pectoral are lazily given, and the fish\r\nglides on after a stroke till its impetus is exhausted, when another\r\nstroke is delivered. The fishes frequently roll slightly from side\r\nto side at the exhaustion of the result of a stroke. When swimming\r\nrapidly the pectorals are folded to the sides, and their locomotion is\r\nthen similar to that of a salamander--by the motion of the tail. They\r\nreadily adjust themselves to different depths, and are usually perfect\r\nphilosophers, quiet, dignified, unconcerned, and imperturbed, entirely\r\ndifferent from such eyed species as minnows and sunfishes which are\r\nsometimes found in caves and which are much more readily disturbed by\r\nany motion in the water, making it almost impossible to capture them\r\nwhen found in the caves. The pectorals are also almost exclusively\r\nused when quietly rising in the water. At such times the pectorals are\r\nextended laterally and then pressed to the sides, beginning with the\r\nupper rays. A downward stroke is delivered in this way not quickly,\r\nbut with apparent lazy deliberation. In swimming the pectorals are\r\nbrought forward upper edge foremost. The center of gravity seems to\r\nbe so placed in regard to their various axes that the fish does not\r\nlose its balance whatever its position. They float horizontally in the\r\nwater without any apparent effort to maintain their position, or with\r\nthe main axis inclined upward, with the snout sometimes touching the\r\nsurface of the water, apparently lifeless. Once one was seen resting on\r\nits tail in a nearly vertical position, and one while quietly swimming\r\nwas once seen to leisurely turn a somersault and swim on undisturbed.\r\nAt another time the same individual rolled completely over. When one of\r\nthem is kept out of the water for a short time it frequently goes in a\r\ncorkscrew-shaped path through the water, continually spinning around\r\nits long axis. In their quiet, floating position it is difficult to\r\ndetermine whether they are alive or not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--_Ipnops Murrayi_, living at a depth of 1,500 to\r\n2,100 fathoms.\r\n\r\nFIG. 5.--_Chlorophthalmus gracilis_, from 1,100 fathoms, off New\r\nZealand.]\r\n\r\nI have not found the slightest difficulty in capturing Amblyopsis\r\nwith a small dip net, either from a boat or while wading through the\r\nsubterranean stream, and I have caught one in the hollow of my hand.\r\nAt such a time all the noise I could make did not affect the fishes\r\nfound swimming in the water. Frequently they were taken in the dip net\r\nwithout apparently noting the vibrations produced in the water until\r\nthey were lifted out of it; very rarely a fish became evidently scared.\r\nSuch a one would dart off a few feet or a few inches, and remain on\r\nthe _qui vive_. If not pursued, it soon swam off quietly; if pursued,\r\nit not infrequently escaped by rapidly darting this way and that;\r\nwhen jumping out of the water, often an abrupt turn in the opposite\r\ndirection from which it started would land it in the net, showing\r\nthat their sense of direction was not very acute. At other times, if\r\ndisturbed by the waves produced by wading, one or another individual\r\nwould follow a ledge of rock to the bottom of the stream, where it\r\nwould hide in a crevice. But very frequently, much more frequently than\r\nnot, no attention was paid either to the commotion produced by the\r\nwading or by the boat and dip net. In general, it may be said that the\r\nfishes in their natural habitat are oblivious to disturbances of the\r\nwater until frightened by some very unusual jar or motion, probably a\r\ntouch with the net, when they become intensely alert. The fact that\r\nthey are not easily frightened suggests the absence of many enemies,\r\nwhile their frantic behavior if once scared gives evidence either that\r\noccasional enemies are present and that they are very dangerous, or\r\nthat the transmission of the instinct of fear is as tenacious as the\r\ntransmission of physical characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--_Brodula barbata_ from Havana, Cuba.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--_Stygicola dentatus_ from the caves of Cuba.]\r\n\r\nContrary to Sloan’s observation, that they detect the presence of a\r\nsolid substance in their path, I have never noticed that those in\r\nconfinement became aware of the proximity of the walls of the aquarium\r\nwhen swimming toward it. Instead, they constantly use the padded,\r\nprojecting lower jaw as bumpers. Even an extremely rapid dart through\r\nthe water seems to be stopped without serious inconvenience by the\r\nprojecting jaw.\r\n\r\nThe first observations on the feeding habit of Amblyopsis are those of\r\nCope. He remarks that “the projecting lower jaw and upward direction\r\nof the mouth render it easy for the fish to feed at the surface of the\r\nwater, where it must obtain much of its food.... This structure also\r\nprobably explains the facts of its being the sole representative of the\r\nfishes in subterranean waters. No doubt many other forms were carried\r\ninto the caverns since the waters first found their way there, but most\r\nof them were like those of our present rivers--deep-water or bottom\r\nfeeders. Such fishes would starve in a cave river, where much of the\r\nfood is carried to them on the surface of the stream.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--_Aphyonus gelatinosus_, 1,400 fathoms, between\r\nAustralia and New Guinea.\r\n\r\nFIG. 9.--_Aphyonus mollis_, 955 fathoms, 24° 36′ north, 84° 5′ west.\r\n\r\nFIG. 10.--_Tauredophidium hextii_, 1,310 fathoms, Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\nFIG. 11.--_Acanthonus armatus_, 1,050 fathoms, mid Pacific, off the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\nFIG. 12.--_Typhlonus nasus_, 2,150 to 2,440 fathoms, north of Australia\r\nand north of Celebes.\r\n\r\nFIG. 13.--_Hephthacara simum_, 902 fathoms, Coromandel coast.\r\n\r\nFIG. 14.--_Alexeterion parfaiti_, 5,005 metres, North Atlantic.]\r\n\r\nThe observations of Cope are entirely erroneous, as we shall see, and\r\nthe speculations based on them naturally fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nDr. Sloan recorded one Amblyopsis which he kept twenty months without\r\nfood. “Some of them would strike eagerly at any small body thrown in\r\nthe water near them, rarely missed it, and in a very short time ejected\r\nit from their mouths with considerable force. I tried to feed them\r\noften with bits of meat and fish-worms, but they retained nothing. On\r\none occasion I missed a small one, and found his tail projecting from\r\nthe mouth of a larger one.”\r\n\r\nWyman found a small-eyed fish in the stomach of an Amblyopsis.\r\n\r\nHoppin was struck by the fact that, if not capable of long fasts,\r\nTroglichthys must live on very small organisms that the unaided eye can\r\nnot discern. Garman found, in the stomachs of Troglichthys collected\r\nby Hoppin in Missouri, species of Asellus, Cambarus, Ceuthophilus, and\r\nCrangonyx.\r\n\r\nAll the specimens of Amblyopsis so far taken by me contained very\r\nlarge fatty bodies in their abdominal cavity, a condition suggesting\r\nabundance of food. The stomachs always contained the _débris_ of\r\ncrustaceans, a closer identification of which was not attempted. One\r\nyoung Amblyopsis disappeared on the way home from the caves, and had\r\nevidently been swallowed by one of the larger ones. A few old ones,\r\nkept in an aquarium from May to July, were seen voiding excrement\r\ntoward the last of their captivity, and their actions at various\r\ntimes suggested that they were scraping the minute organisms from the\r\nside of the aquarium. The young Amblyopsis reared in the aquarium\r\nseemed to feed on the minute forms found in the mud at the bottom\r\nof its aquarium. Some Cœcidotæa placed in the aquarium of the young\r\nsoon disappeared, and the capture of one of these was noted under a\r\nreading glass. The fish was quietly swimming along the side of its\r\naquarium; when it came within about an inch of the crustacean it became\r\nalert, and with the next move of the Cœcidotæa it was captured with\r\na very quick, well-aimed dart on the part of the young fish. Others\r\nwere captured while crawling along the floor of the aquarium. From\r\nall things noted, it seems very probable that Amblyopsis is a bottom\r\nfeeder, and that it also picks food from the walls of the caves. It is\r\nnot at all improbable or impossible that food should be captured at\r\nthe surface or in open water, but there seems no warrant for Cope’s\r\nsupposition that Amblyopsis is a top feeder. I have frequently seen\r\nlarger specimens, which had been in captivity for several weeks, nosing\r\nabout the bottom of the aquarium, with their bodies inclined upward in\r\nthe water and quietly taking in the organic fragments at the bottom.\r\nAn Asellus stirring about at such a time always produced an unusual\r\nalertness.\r\n\r\nThe number of respiratory movements of Amblyopsis averaged nineteen a\r\nminute in five observations, reaching a maximum of thirty in a small\r\nindividual and a minimum of fourteen in a large one. This is in strong\r\ncontrast to Chologaster, the number of whose respiratory motions\r\nreached an average of eighty per minute in five observations, with\r\na minimum of fifty-six and a maximum of one hundred and eight in a\r\nsmall specimen. Dr. Loeb has called my attention to the more rapid\r\nabsorption of oxygen in the light than in the dark; this extended would\r\nprobably mean the more rapid absorption of oxygen through the skin of\r\nlight-colored animals, a matter of doubtful value, however, to species\r\nliving in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe gill filaments are small as compared with the gill cavity.\r\n\r\nOxygenation probably takes place through the skin. Ritter[J] has\r\nsuggested the same for Typhlogobius.\r\n\r\n    [J] Ritter, Museum of Comparative Zoölogy, vol. xxiv, p. 92.\r\n\r\n“Cutaneous respiration is not unique in Typhlogobius and the\r\nAmblyopsidæ. In the viviparous fishes of California the general\r\nsurface, and especially the fins, which have become enormously\r\nenlarged, serve as respiratory organs during the middle and later\r\nperiods of gestation; the fins are a mass of blood-vessels, with merely\r\nsufficient cellular substance to knit them together. There is, however,\r\nno pink coloration.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--_Mancalias Schufeldtii_, 372 fathoms.]\r\n\r\nSkin respiration would account for the extreme resistance to\r\nasphyxiation in Amblyopsis and Typhlogobius. About forty-five\r\nexamples of Amblyopsis were carried in a pail of water four hundred\r\nmiles by rail, with only a partial change of water three times\r\nduring twenty-four hours. A smaller number may be kept for days or\r\nweeks--probably indefinitely--in a pail of water without change. The\r\ncharacteristics of Typhlogobius along this line have been set forth\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nSticks, straws, etc., are never avoided by the fishes even when\r\nperfectly imperturbed. By this I mean that they are never seen to avoid\r\nsuch an object when it is in their path. They swim against it and then\r\nturn. An object falling through the water does not disturb them, even\r\nif it falls on them. A pencil gently moved about in front of them does\r\nnot disturb the fishes much, but if the pencil is held firmly in the\r\nhand it is always perceived, and the fish comes to a dead halt ten or\r\nfifteen millimetres before it reaches such an object. On the other\r\nhand, they may be touched on the back or tail before they start away.\r\nThey glide by each other leisurely and dignified, and if they collide,\r\nas they sometimes do, they usually show no more emotion than when they\r\nrun against a stick. But this indifference is not always displayed, as\r\nwe shall see under the head of breeding habits.\r\n\r\nA number kept in an aquarium with a median partition, in which there\r\nwas a small opening, were readily able to perceive the opening,\r\nswimming directly for it when opposite it. This observation is in\r\ndirect contrast to their inability to perceive solid substances in\r\ntheir path. A sharp tap on the sides of an aquarium in which six\r\nblind fishes were swimming, where they had been for a number of days\r\nundisturbed, in a dark room, caused nearly all of them to dart rapidly\r\nforward. A second tap produced a less unanimous reaction. This repeated\r\non successive days always brought responses from some of the inmates\r\nof the aquarium. Those responding were not necessarily the nearest to\r\nthe center of disturbance, but sometimes at the opposite side of the\r\naquarium or variously distributed through it. After a few days the\r\nfishes took no notice of the tapping by any action observable in the\r\nartificially lighted room.\r\n\r\nSuch tapping on a well-lighted aquarium containing both Chologaster\r\nand Amblyopsis was always perceived by the Amblyopsis, but the only\r\nresponse from these imperturbable philosophers was a slight motion of\r\nthe pectorals, a motion that suggested that their balance had been\r\ndisturbed and that the motion was a rebalancing. Chologaster, on the\r\nother hand, invariably darted about in a frantic manner. One individual\r\nof Amblyopsis floating on the water was repeatedly pushed down by the\r\nfinger without being disturbed. If, however, they are touched on the\r\nside they always rapidly dart away.\r\n\r\nFrom everything observed, it is quite evident that Amblyopsis is not\r\nkeener in perceiving objects or vibrations than other fishes, and\r\nordinarily pays much less attention to them. Whether it possesses a\r\ngreater power of discrimination of vibrations it would be difficult to\r\nsay. It certainly possesses very elaborate tactile organs about the\r\nhead. These tactile organs are probably more serviceable in detecting\r\nand precisely locating prey in the immediate neighborhood than for\r\nanything else. Some observations on young Amblyopsis are of interest in\r\nthis connection.\r\n\r\nThe young, with a large amount of yolk still attached, show a\r\nwell-developed sense of direction. A needle thrust into the water near\r\ntheir heads and in front of them causes a quick reaction, the young\r\nfishes turning and swimming in the opposite direction. They will do\r\nthis two or three times, then, becoming exhausted, will remain at rest.\r\nSometimes an individual will not move until it is actually touched by\r\nthe needle. The needle must come within about three or four millimetres\r\nof the fish before it is noticed. Then, if it produces any result, it\r\ncauses the fish to quickly turn and swim some distance, when it falls\r\nto the bottom again and remains at rest. If the needle is placed\r\nbehind the fish, it will swim directly forward; if at the side or about\r\nthe middle, it causes the fish to swim directly forward or to turn and\r\nswim in a direction opposite the origin of the disturbance. Younger\r\nspecimens have, as yet, no power over the direction of their progress;\r\nthe wiggling of the tail simply produces a gyration, with the yolk as\r\npivot.\r\n\r\nA young blind fish, six months old, swims about in a jerky manner,\r\nchiefly by the use of its pectoral fins. It keeps close to the side\r\nof the vessel, usually with its back to the glass. (The aquarium was\r\na cylindrical jar three hundred millimetres in diameter and three\r\nhundred millimetres high.) It perceives a stick thrust toward it\r\nas readily as a seeing fish can. It always perceives from whatever\r\ndirection it may be approached, and will invariably dart away a short\r\ndistance, sometimes making sharp turns to avoid the stick, and always\r\nsuccessfully. It can be approached from the top nearer than from the\r\nsides or from in front. It does not avoid the sides of the aquarium,\r\nwhich it frequently strikes. It is a bottom feeder; its intestinal\r\ncanal is always partially full.\r\n\r\nA long series of experiments was made on Amblyopsis and Chologaster\r\nto determine their reaction to white and monochromatic light. Without\r\ngoing into the details of these experiments, it may be stated that\r\nAmblyopsis avoids the light, regardless of the direction or the color\r\nof the rays. The same is true of Chologaster, except that they were\r\npositively attracted by the red rays of the spectrum as against the\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nWe owe the first observations on the breeding habits of Amblyopsis to\r\nThompson, who states that a fish “was put in water as soon as captured,\r\nwhere it gave birth to nearly twenty young, which swam about for some\r\ntime, but soon died; ... they were each four lines in length.” Little\r\nor nothing has been added to our knowledge of this subject since that\r\ntime, but the highly interesting supposition of Thompson that they were\r\nviviparous has gained currency, and it is therefore unfortunate that in\r\nthis respect he was in error.\r\n\r\nPutnam adds to the above that, judging from some data in his\r\npossession, the young are born in September and October, and further\r\nalong remarks that they are “undoubtedly” viviparous.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid by the female in under her gill membrane. Here they\r\nremain for perhaps two months, till the yolk is nearly all absorbed.\r\nIf a female with young in her gill pouches is handled, some of the\r\nyoung are sure to escape. This was observed, and gave rise to the idea\r\nthat this fish is viviparous. Eggs have been obtained as early as\r\nMarch 11th and as late as September, and the indications are that the\r\nbreeding season extends throughout the year. The eggs are large--2.3\r\nmillimetres in diameter from membrane to membrane--and about sixty to\r\nseventy are laid at one time.\r\n\r\nCertain structures gain an entirely new significance in the light of\r\nthe breeding habits. These are the enlarged gill cavities, with the\r\nsmall gills, the closely applied branchiostegal membrane, and the\r\nposition of the anus and sexual orifices. The latter are placed just\r\nbehind the gill membrane in such close proximity to it that they can\r\nbe covered by it. It is probable, therefore, that the membrane is\r\ndrawn over the sexual orifice and the eggs deposited directly into the\r\ngill cavity. In an individual thirty-five millimetres long the anus\r\nis situated between the origin of the pectorals; in one twenty-five\r\nmillimetres long it lies between the pectorals and ventrals. In the\r\nyoung it lies behind the ventrals, as in other fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--The embryo of _Typhlogobius_, showing the\r\nwell-developed eye.\r\n\r\nFIG. 17.--A young _Typhlogobius_, times 4-2/9.\r\n\r\nFIG. 18.--Adult _Typhlogobius_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 19.--Adult _Gillichthys-y-cauda_ living in crab holes in San Diego\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nFIG. 20.--Young _Gillichthys mirabilis_ under the same magnification as\r\nFig. 17.]\r\n\r\nIn an aquarium containing six Amblyopsis two took a great antipathy to\r\neach other. Whenever they touched, a vigorous contest began. Frequently\r\nthey came to have a position with broadside to broadside, their heads\r\npointing in opposite directions. At such a time the fight consists\r\nin quick lateral thrusts toward the antagonist to seize him with\r\nthe mouth. The motion is instantly parried by a similar move by the\r\nantagonist. This blind punching may be kept up for a few seconds, when,\r\nby their vigorous motions, they lose each other and jerk themselves\r\nthrough the water from side to side, apparently hunting for each\r\nother. At this time they are very agile, and move with precision. When\r\nthe belligerents meet one above the other, the snapping and punching is\r\nof a different order. While jerking through the water immediately after\r\na round, if one of the belligerents touches one of the neutrals in the\r\naquarium it frequently gives it a punch, but does not follow it up, and\r\nthe unoffending fellow makes haste to get out of the road, the smaller\r\nones doing so most quickly. If, after an interval of a few seconds, a\r\nbelligerent meets a neutral they quietly pass each other without paying\r\nany further attention, whereas if the two belligerents meet again there\r\nis an immediate response. Whether they recognize each other by touch\r\nor by their mutual excitability I do not know. At one time, in another\r\naquarium, I saw one belligerent capture the other by the pectorals.\r\nAfter holding on for a short time it let go, and all differences were\r\nforgotten. The thrust is delivered by a single vigorous flip of the\r\ntail and caudal to one side. These fights were frequently noticed, and\r\nalways occurred between males.\r\n\r\nThe absence of secondary sexual differences in the cave fishes is a\r\nforcible argument in favor of sexual selection as the factor producing\r\nhigh coloration in the males. The absence of secondary sexual\r\ndifferences in cave animals opposes the idea of Geddes and Thompson\r\nthat the differences are the external expression of maleness and\r\nfemaleness.\r\n\r\nAttempts at acclimating Amblyopsis in outside waters have so far\r\nfailed.[K] A few were placed in Turkey Lake, Indiana. They were\r\nsurrounded by a fine wire net, to keep off other fishes. They died in\r\na few days, as the result of attacks of leeches, _saprolegnia_, or\r\nfish mold, and from unknown causes. Others were kept in an elongated\r\nbox sunk into the ground, where fresh spring water flowed through it\r\nconstantly. _Saprolegnia_ sooner or later destroyed all of them. They\r\nlive longest in quiet aquaria, where the water is rarely changed. The\r\nyoung I have secured died, with one exception, within a few weeks. The\r\ndifficulty of rearing the young is not at all insurmountable. They eat\r\nreadily. Their aquaria must be kept free from green plants, and have a\r\nlayer of fine mud, with a few decaying leaves, in the bottom. They will\r\nfeed on minute crustaceans and other micro-organisms. When they have\r\nreached a sufficient size, examples of Asellus are greedily devoured.\r\nFish mold is the bane of the larvæ. Many of them were found with tufts\r\nof the _hyphæ_ growing out of their mouths and gill openings.\r\n\r\n    [K] Since the above was written an apparently successful\r\n        attempt has been made to colonize them in a pool at Winona\r\n        Lake. A record of this colony will be published later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN OF SCIENCE IN PRACTICAL AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\nBY F. W. CLARKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human mind is addicted to the creation of types, a process which\r\nimplies classification and generalization of a somewhat low order. Some\r\nprominent feature of the thing classified is selected for emphasis,\r\nand there is often a degree of exaggeration which leads, in the end,\r\nto caricature. John Bull, Brother Jonathan, the Jew of the comic\r\npapers, and the stage Irishman are examples of this tendency. So, too,\r\na profession or occupation is summed up in one conventional character,\r\nwith a little truth distorted as if seen reflected from the surface of\r\na curved mirror. The likeness is there, but unlike the reality. The\r\nindividual embodiment of the type is rarely, if ever, encountered.\r\n\r\nThe man of science deals with questions which commonly lie outside\r\nof the range of ordinary experience, which often have no immediately\r\ndiscernible relation to the affairs of everyday life, and which\r\nconcentrate the mind upon apparent abstractions to an extraordinary\r\ndegree. Accordingly, the scholar, the scientific investigator, is\r\ntypified as an elderly dreamer in spectacles, who is so uncouth, so\r\nself-forgetful, so absent-minded, and so ignorant of practical matters\r\nas to be hardly more than a child. He is one to be cared for and\r\nhumored, like an imbecile--treated with some consideration, perhaps,\r\non account of his learning, but never to be trusted in the transaction\r\nof business nor in the administration of public affairs. With him, as\r\nan antithesis, is contrasted the practical man, who knows whither his\r\nsteps are tending, who has learned to control others, and who never\r\ndreams of abstractions during office hours, if indeed he troubles\r\nhimself about them at all. The one is thought to be vague, visionary,\r\nand unpractical; the other is deemed efficient, precise, prompt,\r\nand clear. Has this distinction any basis in reality? Do scientific\r\npursuits disqualify a man for administrative responsibility?\r\n\r\nThese questions, like all other legitimate questions, are to be\r\nanswered by evidence, and the popular impression is entitled to no\r\nweight whatever. This evidence is to be found by a study of the thing\r\nitself, the man of science as he actually is; by an examination of\r\nthe training which he receives, the character of the work which he\r\ndoes, and the results which he accomplishes. By this method it will be\r\nfound that the supposed type is purely imaginary, that the workers in\r\nscience exhibit all the variations which are found in any other group\r\nof occupations, that the human race as a whole is their only symbol\r\nor representative. The man of science may be grave or gay, moral\r\nor immoral, social or unsocial, keen or visionary--in short, he may\r\nexemplify any trait of human nature, except the traits of ignorance and\r\nstupidity. He must be intelligent and educated, methodical and exact;\r\napart from these qualifications he may resemble any other man, chosen\r\nfrom any other vocation. Indeed, his nearest analogue is the so-called\r\nman of business, and the chief distinction between the two is that one\r\ndeals with unfamiliar, the other with familiar things.\r\n\r\nThe direct tendency of the scientific training is to develop as fully\r\nas possible the positive traits which have been mentioned. Each\r\nscience is a body of systematic, well-organized knowledge, with clear\r\nfundamental principles and distinct outlines. The study of science\r\nis a continual discouragement of obscurity or vagueness; it is a\r\ndiscipline in the statement and solution of definite problems, and it\r\ntrains one to see things as they are, apart from all irrelevancies. The\r\ntechnicalities of science, so bewildering to the layman, are merely\r\naids to exactness, avoidances of circumlocution--in short, they are\r\npractical devices whereby labor is saved. Economy of effort is one of\r\nthe features in which the scientific training excels.\r\n\r\nThe results of such a training vary, of course, with the individual,\r\nand depend upon his personal peculiarities. A broad man is broadened by\r\nit; a narrow man shuts himself up within the limits of a specialty. To\r\nsome extent specialization is necessary, but there is a wide difference\r\nbetween the man who sees only his own province and one who realizes its\r\nrelations to other fields. The same distinction is found in commercial\r\nlife, and with the same results. The specialist in money, in stocks, in\r\niron, or in cotton may be just as narrow as the specialist in stars,\r\nor reactions, or insects, and know little or nothing of any subject\r\noutside his own. Neither narrowness nor breadth of view is monopolized\r\nby any vocation. The mere fact that men of science rarely devote their\r\nattention to accumulating wealth does not prove them to be unpractical.\r\nThey are not, as a rule, careless or thriftless in money matters;\r\nthey are as likely to handle their financial affairs intelligently\r\nas any one else, but their main business lies in other directions.\r\nIf seldom a millionaire, the man of science is still more seldom a\r\nbankrupt. In wild speculation the so-called practical man takes the\r\nlead, and anything which bears the trade mark of electricity, from\r\nthe electrical refining of sugar to the extraction of gold from sea\r\nwater, can secure from otherwise shrewd financiers the support which\r\na worker in science would contemptuously refuse to give. A few years\r\nago the would-be rain-makers obtained the money for their experiments\r\nfrom men of business, and from Congress even, in spite of advice based\r\nupon scientific knowledge, and failure was the inevitable end. In that\r\nborderland between business and research, which is known as applied\r\nscience, the scientific student is more practical than the financier.\r\nWhen both work together, wealth is produced, but the seedtime of\r\nabstract investigation always precedes the harvest. The commercial\r\nvalue of exact knowledge is often very great, but to the prospective\r\ninvestor this truth is not always evident.\r\n\r\nThe practical value of the scientific training is perhaps most fully\r\nrecognized in Germany. There the importance of the investigator, the\r\napparently abstract scholar, is thoroughly understood, and to his work\r\nthe great industrial advance of Germany is largely attributable. In\r\nchemical and electrical industries this is particularly true, and their\r\ngrowth can be directly traced to the influence of the universities.\r\nThe German professor is a man trained to research, and from among his\r\nstudents many of the best investigators are chosen for service in\r\nthe factories. German competition in the commercial world is to-day\r\nthe bugbear of other European countries, and its success is due,\r\nfirst of all, to the utilization of trained intelligences. In our own\r\ncountry the importance of applied science is fully realized and its\r\nachievements are beyond dispute, but the scholar as yet receives less\r\nconsideration than the commercial expert. The latter is practical, the\r\nformer is regarded as visionary. Accurate knowledge is a good thing,\r\nbut rule-of-thumb experience is often thought to be better. It is only\r\nwhen knowledge and experience join hands that the highest practical\r\nresults are attainable, the one factor tending to advance, the other to\r\nperpetuate, industry. The man of affairs is not a practical man until\r\nhe appreciates the force of these propositions.\r\n\r\nAt bottom the scientific training is a training in clear thought,\r\nprecise statement, accurate observation, the verification of evidence,\r\nand the ascertainment of truth. Why should its recipient be unfitted\r\nfor practical things? Good administration, the effective transaction\r\nof business, implies system, exactness, the judgment of evidence upon\r\nits merits, and the prompt solution of problems as they arise, and to\r\neach of these requisites the scientific education is directly related.\r\nWhat other training is less likely to produce dreamers, or more likely\r\nto develop efficient men? The main distinction between the workers\r\nin science and men of other vocations is one of aim, a difference in\r\nambition, perhaps a difference in the point of view. The scientific\r\nscholar seeks to discover and possibly to apply new truth; and after\r\nthat his ambition is to win the recognition of his fellows, to gain\r\nreputation, rather than to acquire wealth. He may not be indifferent to\r\nthe latter purpose, but it is not his chief end. It is difficult to do\r\nboth things well.\r\n\r\nFor the administration of large interests, involving the control of men\r\nand the building-up of great institutions, men of science have over\r\nand over again demonstrated their fitness. In the scientific societies\r\nof the world they have shown their capacity for organization, and in\r\nthe management of schools and colleges their ability has often been\r\nproved. Among the presidents of universities and technical schools\r\nwho have been drawn from the ranks of science I may mention Eliot,\r\nof Harvard; Gilman, of the Johns Hopkins; Drown, of Lehigh; Jordan,\r\nof the Leland Stanford; Chamberlin, of Wisconsin; Morton, of the\r\nStevens Institute; and Mendenhall, of the Worcester Polytechnic. The\r\nInstitute of Technology in Boston has been directed successively by\r\nRogers, Runkle, Walker, and Crafts; the Columbia School of Mines was\r\nbuilt up by a group of scientific workers, aided by President Barnard;\r\nand the list might be lengthened almost indefinitely. Have these men\r\nfallen below the average of their fellows? Have they not shown at\r\nleast as high administrative ability as has been found elsewhere? The\r\nmere statement of their names is a sufficient answer, and renders\r\nargument unnecessary. With them the scientific training has not been\r\na disqualification, nor even a handicap; it has rather been to their\r\nadvantage, for to it they owe much of the insight, the power to grasp\r\ngreat problems intelligently, the ability to interpret evidence, and\r\nthe tendency to prompt and decisive action, without which successful\r\nadministration is impossible.\r\n\r\nAgain, consider the scientific institutions of the world, the museums\r\nand observatories, and the various governmental organizations in which\r\nscience is recognized. In our own country, the Smithsonian Institution\r\nand National Museum were built up by Henry and Baird, in spite of\r\ngreat and varied difficulties; the Coast Survey was created by Hassler\r\nand Bache; and the Geological Survey was developed by a group of men\r\namong whom Hayden, King, and Powell were pioneers. The last-named\r\norganization has been controlled from the beginning by men of science,\r\nand the Coast Survey has been weak only when under nonscientific\r\nmanagement. The Commission of Fish and Fisheries owes its existence\r\nand a great part of its effectiveness to its creator, Baird; the Army\r\nMedical Museum and Library represents the executive genius of Billings;\r\nand in none of these institutions has partisan politics ever exerted\r\nan appreciable influence. No bureaus of the Government have been more\r\nwisely or more efficiently handled than those which men of science have\r\ncontrolled; in none have there been fewer errors or scandals; there is\r\nnot one in which the essential purpose of its existence has been better\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of excluding the scholar, the investigator, the man\r\nwho knows, the man of scientific training, from his fair share of\r\npublic responsibility, we should do well to call him into service\r\nmore and more. He may be, he often is, averse to administrative work,\r\nfor the reason that it interferes with his chosen occupation, and\r\nhinders the prosecution of research. But his training and his mental\r\nbias are both needed in public affairs, wherein the scientific method\r\nis too often unapplied. In European countries men of high scientific\r\nrank are frequently found in legislative bodies and ministries; men\r\nlike Playfair, Roscoe, and Lubbock in England, Virchow in Germany,\r\nQuintino Sella in Italy, and Berthelot in France. With us in America\r\nthe maker of speeches outranks the thinker in popular esteem, and is\r\ngiven duties to perform in which he may become ridiculous. Both in\r\nlegislation and in diplomacy many questions arise which demand the most\r\ncareful scientific treatment, or which can be answered only by thorough\r\nscientific knowledge, and many of these have been intrusted for\r\nsettlement to men of no specific training whatever. Of late years we\r\nhave had the fur-seal controversy, the question of forest reserves, the\r\nirrigation of our arid lands, problems of sanitation and water supply,\r\nand in each of these the man of science has played a part which was too\r\noften subordinate to that of the politician. In an ideal government\r\nthe two should work together, each supplementing the peculiar ability\r\nof the other. Many details of the tariff, and a notable part of the\r\ncoinage question, require scientific data for their proper settlement,\r\nbut the true expert has not always been consulted. The result of\r\nthis neglect is sometimes seen in courts of law, where questions\r\nof interpretation arise which might have been averted, obscurity\r\nin legislation being often due to the careless use of scientific\r\nterminology or to ignorance of the relations in science between two\r\nbranches of industry. The voice of the trained investigator might well\r\nbe heard in Congress, but his testimony now is limited to the committee\r\nroom. Even there it is received with an attention which is too often\r\nmingled with incredulity. The myth of the dreamer, the visionary, is\r\nmore than half believed.\r\n\r\nThe supposed type, then, is not a type, but an exception--a man of\r\nstraw, which is hardly worth overthrowing. But the belief in it has\r\nbeen and still is mischievous, a hindrance to wise action, an obstacle\r\nto progress. The misconception has worked injury to science. These\r\nwords of protest, therefore, are not wholly superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORENOON AND AFTERNOON.\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES F. DOWD, PH. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of common observation, at different times of the year,\r\nthat the forenoon and afternoon, as to daylight, are of unequal\r\nlength. Along in later autumn the shortness of the afternoons is very\r\nnoticeable, and the shortness of forenoons along in later winter.\r\nWhatever makes common facts more intelligible adds to the general\r\nintelligence and to the general good. It is to this end that the\r\nfollowing brief statements are made.\r\n\r\nNothing is more evident than that the sun requires just as much time\r\nto go from the eastern horizon to the midday meridian as to go from\r\nthat meridian to the western horizon. But, strange to say, there are\r\nbut four days during the whole year in which the sun reaches the midday\r\nmeridian at just twelve o’clock. The true noon point varies from about\r\nfifteen minutes before to about sixteen minutes after twelve o’clock.\r\nThese extreme points in one set of variations fall in the first week\r\nof November and in the second week of February, not to designate exact\r\ndays for years in general.\r\n\r\nThe calendars show that in the latitude of Saratoga (essentially\r\nBoston latitude) on November 3, 1898, the sun rose at 6.30 and set at\r\nfive o’clock, thereby making the forenoon a half hour longer than the\r\nafternoon. On that day the sun reached the midday meridian at 11.45. On\r\nFebruary 13, 1899, the sun rose at just seven o’clock and set at 5.30,\r\nthereby making the afternoon a half hour longer than the forenoon, and\r\non this day the sun reached the midday meridian at 12.15. These are\r\nfacts plainly open to general view, and therefore need no verifying.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the foregoing are not so apparent to common observation.\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the mean or average solar day is the\r\nbasis for all time measurements, therefore its exact length is of\r\nthe greatest importance. Yet the general solar day, from which the\r\naverage one is derived, is a very indefinite term as to its length.\r\nIts length in general may be defined, under view of the sun’s apparent\r\nmotion, as the time extending from the instant that the sun’s center\r\ncrosses any given meridian of the earth on one day to the instant that\r\ncenter crosses the same meridian on the following day--i. e., the time\r\nintervening between these two instants is the length of a solar day.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the sun, however, is only apparent; the actual motion\r\nis in the earth’s revolution upon its axis. We should have one day\r\na year long if the earth did not revolve on its axis at all, since\r\nthe revolution of the earth around the sun once a year would in the\r\ncourse of the year bring all sides facing the sun. Consequently the\r\nearth makes one more revolution upon its axis each year than the number\r\nof solar days in that year, and a little consideration of this fact\r\nwill show that in each solar day the earth makes one full revolution\r\non its axis and about 1/365 of another, which fractional addition is\r\noccasioned by one day’s progress of the earth along its orbit.\r\n\r\nAnother fact needs to be considered. Since the earth’s orbit is in the\r\nform of an ellipse, with the sun at one of the foci, the earth must\r\npass nearer the sun in some parts of its orbit than in others. By the\r\nlaws of gravity, when nearer, the attraction between the earth and sun\r\nis greater, and if this were not balanced by increased velocity along\r\nits orbit the earth would fall into the sun; and, on the other hand,\r\nwhen farther off this attraction is less, and if this were not balanced\r\nby a diminution of velocity along its orbit the earth would fly off\r\ninto space. This varying velocity, together with other complications\r\ntoo technical for a magazine article, gives varying lengths of orbit to\r\nthe several solar days of the year. If the earth’s orbit were laid out\r\nupon paper and, by astronomical calculations, an exact proportionate\r\nsection were marked off for each solar day of the year, the variable\r\nlengths of orbit for the different days of the year would plainly\r\nappear to the eye.\r\n\r\nBut, as before explained, the time of a solar day is the time of one\r\nrevolution of the earth upon its axis, together with the fractional\r\npart of another revolution occasioned by one day’s progress of the\r\nearth along its orbit. Then it must follow that as the daily sections\r\nof the orbit vary in length, the time of the solar day must vary in\r\nlength. No clock could be made to keep the variable time of true solar\r\ndays, and if this were possible, the hour, minute, etc., would be\r\nvariable of length, and hence no standard for time measurements. But\r\nby working a simple arithmetical problem of addition and division an\r\naverage length of day for the year may easily be found. This average\r\nday is the mean solar day adopted. Its time is arbitrary and exact,\r\nforming a perfect standard for all time measurements. From this the\r\nterm _mean time_ gains its significance.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the foregoing earth’s orbit laid out on paper, with\r\nthe true solar days marked off in sections of mathematical exactness,\r\nit will be seen that by dividing each section into two equal parts and\r\nmarking the division point with red ink, the true noon point of each\r\nsolar day in the year will be conspicuous upon the drawing, and in its\r\nproportionate relations in every way. If now we set a pair of dividers\r\nor compasses so that the opening shall reach over the exact space on\r\nthe orbit of one half of the mean solar day, and beginning at the red\r\nnoon point of one of the four days in the year when the true noon falls\r\nat just twelve o’clock--say December 24th--and step the dividers around\r\non the orbit, making a blue point mark at each second step, then as the\r\nblue points vary from the red so will the mean time which our clocks\r\nkeep vary from the true noon of each day of the year.\r\n\r\nVariation in length of forenoon and afternoon, therefore, may be viewed\r\nby common intelligence not only as a fact but as a necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT JORDAN’S “NEMINISM.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY,\r\n          PALO ALTO, CAL.\r\n      POST OFFICE, STANFORD UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\nDEAR DR. YOUMANS:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed, from an anonymous but appreciative source, may interest\r\nyou. It is doubtless true that the philosophy of Neminism goes back to\r\nIndia, through Hegel and Plato, but the high priestess does not know\r\nthis. She made it all out of her own head.\r\n\r\n  Truly yours,\r\n      DAVID S. JORDAN.\r\n\r\n  THE UNIVERSITY OF MENTIPHYSICS,\r\n          LYNN, MASS., _December 6, 1899_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_President David Starr Jordan, Leland Stanford University, California._\r\n\r\nSIR: I have before me the last issue of one of our two or three great\r\nscientific magazines, in which Mr. Giddings lays down the exact method\r\nwe are to follow in sociology, thereby creating the pleasing impression\r\nthat hereafter he intends to stick to it himself. But, sir, I wish to\r\nsay, as a student of “Neminism,” as you call it, that my emotions were\r\nfar less agreeable on perusing your brilliant plagiarism, the doctrine\r\nof _Nihil nemini nocet_, an aphorism which apparently you wish to\r\nmake rival the _Cogito ergo sum_ of the Cartesian philosophy. I will\r\nconcede to you (I being, as it is perhaps necessary for me to remark, a\r\nliterary person) the undoubted right all real literary persons have of\r\nappropriating everything of a literary nature that they can lay their\r\nhands upon; but, while we are in perfect harmony upon this occasion,\r\nin regard to that point, I regret to insist that the thing must be\r\ndone judiciously--_that_ is the art. Any mere plebeian can accumulate\r\nfacts--_that_ is the _raison d’être_ of the plebeian; his duty is to\r\nwork--but the real ethereal literary man, such as the monthly magazines\r\nnourish, must disdain facts and theories and the truth, and must float\r\nin the pure, soft twilight of his own imagination while he writes about\r\npeople who never existed, in a language which nobody can understand.\r\nYet, sir, in your unblushing appropriation of the late Professor\r\nHegel’s dictum of _Sein und nicht Sein sind dieselbe_ (which I presume\r\nyou, sir, to exculpate yourself, will swear you do not understand),\r\nand in your changing that immortal antithesis to your _Nihil nemini\r\nnocet_--in doing all this I declare that you have violated one of the\r\nmost sacred principles, in fact, the very essence of Neminism; for to\r\nsay, as you have said, that nothing hurts nobody, is to say a very\r\ndull, prosaic, vulgar fact which any fool can understand; but to say\r\nthat “to be and not to be are the same” is to say something that is not\r\nonly very beautiful, but, what is far more to the point, is likewise\r\nutterly incomprehensible; yet to do this _is_ the essence of Neminism,\r\nas you yourself have shown.\r\n\r\nAs a confirmed Neminist glorying in his Neminism, as Pascal’s\r\nFather Joseph, the Jesuit, gloried in “interpretation” of the words\r\n“murder” and “charity,” I am, sir (and I hope my frequent use of this\r\nmonosyllable will not annoy you, for the first Neminist, Plato, uses Ω\r\nΣωκρατες [Greek: Ô Sôkrates] quite as frequently, though his expression\r\nrequires four times as much wind or space as mine), I say, then, that I\r\nam always anxious to be thought well of by people who are on top or are\r\ngetting there, in order, to use your own undignified and cruel metaphor\r\nin the Rev. Mr. Lyman Abbott’s journal of news and Christianity, that I\r\nmay continue “to hold down” my position as the janitor and Professor of\r\nLeibnitzian Monadology in the University of Mentiphysics. But there are\r\ntimes, sir, when even a feminist rises above his interest, and, like\r\nRichelieu in the play, exchanges the lion’s and the fox’s skins. In\r\nshort, I beg to inform you that I believe that you, seeing the growing\r\nattachment of the vulgar mob for the _Wissenshaftliche Pädagogie_ of\r\nthe Robinson Crusoeans or concentrationists, have had the thought\r\nto sap the foundations of their success by vulgarizing our noble\r\nmonopoly of Neministic science, and I should not be at all surprised\r\nto see your name, after a little, as the editor of a “Journal of\r\nPsycho-Materno-Kinder Apperceptics,” or of a strictly American “Great\r\nEducator Series,” beginning with Pontiac and ending with Jim Fiske.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps, sir, you are actuated by deeper motives. Our university\r\nhas not yet received the complimentary copy of your work on Imperial\r\nDemocracy, the Government probably holding it back until General\r\nYoung can catch Mr. Aguinaldo, but I see by the publishers’ lists\r\nthat it is out. Now, it is easy to see that if Imperial Democracy\r\ngets within a stone’s throw of China it will get _into_ China, and,\r\nwith your knowledge of Aristotle’s Politics and the Highbinders in\r\nChinatown, you can not have failed to have recognized that Neminism\r\nand Orientalism are very similar. To be or not to be; to be alive or\r\nto be dead; to be drunk or to be sober--’tis all the same for the\r\npeople; ’tis _Nirvana_. You wish to vulgarize Neminism. What follows\r\nyour success? Immediately every State will make it an obligatory study\r\nin the public schools, and when, in the distant future, we meet the\r\nChinamen face to face, we will be ready to exterminate them or be\r\nexterminated by them; for it is an axiom of sociology, which it is\r\nto be hoped Mr. Giddings will see the value of and will in the next\r\nedition of his Social Euclid make number one, that when two societies\r\ncompletely differing in origin, history, manners, institutions, and\r\nlaws come together they start in the more quickly to cut each other’s\r\nthroats when they have a common idea in which they can locate a\r\ndifference, and hence find a logical excuse to begin.\r\n\r\nI would have preferred that our president had taken up this unpleasant\r\ntask of criticising your mischievous efforts to vulgarize our beautiful\r\nscience, which, like the true religion of the Egyptians, should be\r\nretained _sub rosa_ in the temples; but she, as you yourself have\r\nsaid, does not like controversial publicity, and has often remarked\r\nthat our science is like the mushroom, for, though it is the child of\r\ndarkness and Byzantian filth, it is eminently adapted to be retained by\r\nweak stomachs, while for others it may be nauseating. I am, sir, very\r\nrespectfully,\r\n\r\n      ANACHARSIS PANGLOSS, _M. Plane_.\r\n\r\nThough religiously refraining from introducing my own personality\r\nin the foregoing, it being a cardinal point in our science that it\r\nis good form to appear modest--_videri quam esse_, as was said of\r\nCato--I am, nevertheless, obliged to observe that I am not at all in\r\nany way related to the Dr. Pangloss, LL. D., A. S. S., mentioned in\r\nthe play of the Heir at Law, nor yet, though perhaps more spiritually\r\nakin, to that other Dr. Pangloss--Dr. Leibnitz Pangloss, the tutor\r\nof Candide mentioned by the late Monsieur Voltaire of happy memory.\r\nDr. L. Pangloss, a fine old fellow at bottom, was engaged in showing\r\nhow, in the best possible words, a cause always precedes its effect;\r\nfor instance, Monsieur the Baron Thunder den Trockendorf has a nose,\r\nargues he--it will carry spectacles, hence the nose was created for\r\nspectacles, and spectacles are created. It is plain that Dr. L.\r\nPangloss was a scientist. Now, I am a sociologist, and it is the\r\nhope of my life to fill the chair of Monadology in the new American\r\nuniversity, where I intend to show that while the rich are becoming\r\nricher the poor will become richer than the rich in contemplating how\r\nmuch more satisfaction the rich get out of their riches than they, the\r\npoor, get out of their poverty. This, as you will at once recognize,\r\nis in the line of what Mr. Lester Ward calls Dynamic Sociology, and,\r\nthough it is not the acme of the application of dynamics such as that\r\nwhich knocked Hebraism out of Saul of Tarsus, I beg to remind you that,\r\nuntil German science has made further progress in the application of\r\nelectricity, we lack the means of producing the necessary phenomena by\r\nwhich alone such effects can be secured.\r\n\r\n      A. P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrespondence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAITH AND KNOWLEDGE.\r\n\r\n_Editor Popular Science Monthly_:\r\n\r\nSIR: In your editorial, in the issue of September, you speak of “faith\r\nas the organ of religious apprehension.” This suggests some important\r\nfacts that are not always apprehended, or are forgotten. There is no\r\norgan for the discovery, the proof, or the apprehension of truth but\r\nreason, whether facts of Nature or of religion. “Faith” is not a sixth\r\nsense which we do not use in scientific pursuits, but which comes to\r\nour help when we seek for religious truth. Much of the difficulty\r\ncomes from the fact that the word “faith” is ambiguous, having two\r\nmeanings, which are not distinguished. It is (1) simply belief of a\r\nfact because of evidence presented to and apprehended by the reason; or\r\nis it (2) trust, confidence in, belief in, as in a person, resting on\r\nthe belief of that person’s competency and truthfulness, that belief\r\nresting on evidence apprehended by the reason. Because of this “faith”\r\nin the person we accept his testimony as to facts beyond our personal\r\ncognizance, we believe them not because we have discovered them, or\r\nmay be are competent to discover them, but because of our “faith” in\r\na person whom we have seen reason to believe is trustworthy--i. e.,\r\ncompetent and truthful.\r\n\r\nNow, these two meanings of “faith” are often confused, interchanged.\r\nHence the discredit thrown upon belief of religious truth, because an\r\nillegitimate use is made of the place of “faith” in its justification.\r\nAnd writers defending religious belief have been great sinners in this\r\nillegitimate use of “faith.”\r\n\r\nThe place of “faith” is the same in science as in religion--i. e., it\r\nis the condition and justification of our acceptance of truth which is\r\nbeyond our personal cognizance. We accept it because of the testimony\r\nof men in whom we have learned to have faith--e.g., How few of us who\r\naccept the revelations of the spectrum analysis as to the composition\r\nof the stars have any other justification for accepting them than just\r\nthis? We believe them simply because men, whom we, in the exercise\r\nof our reason, have come to believe competent and truthful, tell us\r\nwhat they have seen. We believe on their testimony because we trust\r\nthem. Our process involves three steps: (1) Belief of their competence\r\nthrough appeal to reason; (2) trust in them because of this belief; (3)\r\nbelief of their testimony because of this trust or “faith” in them.\r\nThe only organ we have used is reason, in its initial act of belief of\r\nthe competence and truthfulness of the witnesses. Error in the use of\r\nreason here vitiates all that follows. Correct use of reason here gives\r\na legitimate condition for correct results of the other steps. But\r\nreason must go along with us and guide us in these, that we may come to\r\na rationally accepted belief of the truth.\r\n\r\nHere is the place of “faith” in science, as belief and as trust. By its\r\nuse we accept the great issues of scientific truth which we believe,\r\nand do it legitimately.\r\n\r\nIt is the same in all right acceptance of religious truth. Here appears\r\na person in human history claiming to reveal facts beyond our sphere\r\nof cognizance. Now, the first (1) step is belief in his competence\r\nand truthfulness as a witness, just as in cases of science. His only\r\nappeal is to reason, our only organ for apprehending truth. We, because\r\nof the evidence presented to our reason, believe him competent and\r\ntruthful--i. e., trustworthy--and we take the second step (2), as in\r\ncase of search for scientific truth. We trust him, we have “faith”\r\nin him. Then (3) we believe his testimony as to facts beyond our\r\ncognizance, as to God, as to the inner world and life, as to his\r\nown person and work, and his agency in helping us to the true life.\r\nHere are the same three steps as in our believing the great facts of\r\nscience, and they are equally legitimate, and the belief is equally\r\nlegitimate, and with the same use of “faith” in both cases, which use\r\nis legitimate if we have applied our reason correctly.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that there is this difference in the two cases: We are,\r\nit may be, competent with training to perceive with our reason the\r\nfacts to which the scientists witness, whereas in religion we are not\r\ncompetent by any training, in our present state, to see what Jesus\r\nChrist testified to; therefore the believing him is not legitimate.\r\n\r\nSpace forbids arguing this point, but the writer is confident it can\r\nbe shown that this does not vitiate the process in the least. The\r\nonly point now argued is that reason is the only organ of man for\r\nthe apprehension of truth, and that “faith” acts the same part in\r\nscientific and religious belief.\r\n\r\n      JOHN R. THURSTON.\r\n  WHITINSVILLE, MASS., _September 30, 1899_.\r\n\r\n[The point which our correspondent discusses is one which falls rather\r\nwithin the province of theology or philosophy than within that of\r\nscience. In the article to which he refers we did not distinctly say\r\nthat “faith” was “the organ of religious apprehension.” What we said\r\nwas that _granting_ such was the case, the question still remained to\r\nbe settled where the line should be drawn between faith and knowledge.\r\nWe doubt whether the account which our correspondent gives of faith\r\nwould be widely accepted by those who approach the subject from the\r\ntheological side, while those who approach it from the scientific\r\nside would--at least many of them would--be disposed to consider the\r\nterm one which might better be dispensed with in favor of the less\r\nambiguous word “belief.” Belief is the inclination of the mind toward a\r\nproposition for which absolute or demonstrative proof is wanting, and\r\nit is this condition of mind, it seems to us, that our correspondent\r\nhas in view. Faith in the religious sense, unless we are mistaken, is\r\nsomething different. It is an affirmation made by the human conscience\r\nor consciousness in its own behalf--a certain instinctive recognition\r\nof a presence and power in the universe which, though inaccessible\r\nto scientific investigation, sustains an intimate, profound, and\r\nall-essential relation to man’s moral nature. If trust in an individual\r\never rises to the level of faith in this sense, it is because the\r\ninfluence of the individual harmonizes with and re-enforces the primal\r\ninstinct. That, at least, is how we view the matter.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFISKE’S VIEWS COMPARED.\r\n\r\n_Editor Popular Science Monthly_:\r\n\r\nSIR: Will you permit me to say a few words supplementing your review\r\nof Through Nature to God? To those who have perused Mr. Fiske’s latest\r\nthree scientifico-theological booklets, and also his Cosmic Philosophy,\r\nit can not be new that their author has become entangled in hopeless\r\ncontradictions of himself. The limited space of a letter does not allow\r\nof adducing more than one remarkable passage from Cosmic Philosophy,\r\ndemonstrating the antithesis between the arguments of this work and\r\nMr. Fiske’s latest opinions, these new thoughts having been developed,\r\nas he tells us, by “carrying such a subject about in his mind for”\r\ntwenty-five years. We are told in Through Nature to God (page 12)\r\nthat “it has usually been found necessary to represent the Creator\r\nas finite either in power or in goodness, although the limitation is\r\nseldom avowed, except by writers who have a leaning toward atheism\r\nand take a grim pleasure in pointing out flaws in the constitution\r\nof things. Among modern writers” Comte and Mill are conspicuous for\r\nsuch a “leaning toward atheism.” Then we are informed (page 20) that\r\nthe “shock which such a clear, bold statement gives to our religious\r\nfeelings is no greater than the shock with which it strikes counter\r\nto our modern scientific philosophy.” And a little further on we find\r\nthat “the God which Mr. Mill offers us, shorn of the attribute of\r\nomnipotence, is no God at all.”\r\n\r\nIf the reader will now open Cosmic Philosophy, he is told in vigorous\r\nlanguage (vol. ii, p. 405) that “if there exist a personal Creator of\r\nthe universe who is infinitely intelligent and powerful, he can not be\r\ninfinitely good; if, on the other hand, he be infinite in goodness,\r\nthen he must be lamentably finite in power or in intelligence. By this\r\ntwo-edged difficulty, theology has ever been foiled.” Then (vol. ii,\r\np. 406) Mr. Fiske, quoting from Mill, expresses his entire concurrence\r\nwith the views of this eminent thinker, and adds (vol. ii, p. 407),\r\n“With Mr. Mill, therefore, ‘I will call no being good who is not what\r\nI mean when I apply that epithet to my fellow-creatures.’ And, going a\r\nstep further, I will add that it is impossible to call that being good\r\nwho, existing prior to the phenomenal universe and creating it out of\r\nthe plenitude of infinite power and foreknowledge, endowed it with such\r\nproperties that its material and moral development must inevitably be\r\nattended by the misery of untold millions of sentient creatures for\r\nwhose existence their Creator is ultimately alone responsible.”\r\n\r\nNo comment of mine can show more clearly than the passages cited above\r\nthe “conversion” of Mr. Fiske, against which imputation so much subtle\r\ningenuity is expended in the preface to The Idea of God.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Fiske is merely reviving gross anthropocentric views he\r\nhimself admits. To him, man is “the goal toward which Nature’s work\r\nhas been tending from the first.” But might not also some pithecoid\r\nancestors of ours have deemed themselves the “goal toward which Nature\r\nhad been tending from the first”? What is Nature’s goal in the endless\r\ncycle of evolution in which life is but an infinitesimal part? But with\r\nHuxley I believe that “it would be a new thing in history if _a priori_\r\nphilosophers were daunted by a factious opposition of experience.” Mr.\r\nFiske’s latest writings, as all theodicies, bear testimony to the truth\r\nof Huxley’s scathing remark.\r\n\r\nBut granting, for the sake of the argument, that “in the deepest sense\r\nit is as true as it ever was held to be, that the world was made for\r\nman,” there is an objection to be raised on moral grounds stronger than\r\nany that could be founded on scientific arguments. Had this world been\r\ncreated for man, entailing, as it does, the “misery of untold millions\r\nof sentient creatures,” who but the crassest egotist could worship this\r\nFiskean God of iniquity?\r\n\r\nThe careful student of Thomas Huxley’s works may be surprised to find\r\nThrough Nature to God “consecrated” to the memory of him whose life\r\nwork was devoted to “untiring opposition to that ecclesiastical spirit”\r\nthat shines through every page of Mr. Fiske’s latest writings. I echo\r\nMr. Fiske’s words: “I can never cease to regret that Huxley should have\r\npassed away without seeing my [Mr. Fiske’s] arguments and giving me the\r\nbenefit of his comments.” The last stroke of Huxley’s pen was giving\r\nMr. Balfour “the benefit of his comments”; would that he could have\r\ngiven them to the author of the excursion Through Nature to God!\r\n\r\n      B. A. BEHREND.\r\n  ERIE, PA., _December 5, 1899_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editor Popular Science Monthly_:\r\n\r\nSIR: Your trenchant criticism of Mr. John Fiske’s discussion of the\r\nmystery of evil recalls Mr. Spencer’s reminder that “there is a soul of\r\ntruth in all things erroneous.”\r\n\r\nMr. Fiske certainly has not made it plain that the meaning of the\r\nuniverse is to be found (exclusively) in the higher developments\r\nof love and self-sacrifice; but is it not equally a mistake to say\r\ninferentially that “on a broad view of the world-wide struggle for life\r\nthere are no moral elements to be seen”? If we define morality as the\r\nequivalent merely of love and self-sacrifice, the ever-present love\r\nof mother and, in a degree, of father for the offspring imperatively\r\nnegatives such a conclusion.\r\n\r\nBut morality is something more than love and self-sacrifice. Morality\r\nis right conduct, and right conduct in the last analysis is conformity\r\nto the conditions of existence. The nearer the conformity, the more\r\ncomplete the life, and life approaches completeness only as the\r\nactivities of men cease to be impeded by each other’s aggressions, the\r\nhighest life being reached when men help to complete one another’s\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nConversely, evil must be defined as nonconformity to the conditions of\r\nexistence. Slowly but surely man is learning these conditions, and\r\nas he learns it is not to be doubted that “evil” will lessen. If we\r\naffirm acquisition of knowledge by man, we must postulate a precedent\r\nor “necessary” condition of ignorance. Hence it may be truthfully said\r\nthat evil is a necessary correlative, and in a manner the necessary\r\ncondition of good; and also, I think, that a broad view of the\r\nworldwide struggle for life shows not an absence of moral elements,\r\nbut rather that the ethical is inherent in the very nature of animate\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nWe may not all share Mr. Fiske’s exuberant optimism, and many can not\r\naccept his teleological implications, but of the ultimate triumph of\r\ngood over evil, of knowledge over ignorance, we may not doubt.\r\n\r\n      FRANK M. LOOMIS.\r\n  BUFFALO, _November 10, 1899_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOCATION OF VINLAND.\r\n\r\n_Editor Popular Science Monthly_:\r\n\r\nSIR: I beg to take exception to the exploded Boston theory again\r\nrevived by Miss Cornelia Horsford in the last number of your valuable\r\nmagazine. It is astonishing to notice how little Prof. G. Storm’s\r\nexcellent prize essay and Mr. Reeve’s careful edition of the text\r\nof sagas seem to have availed against the misplaced patriotism that\r\npersists in carrying those Norse explorers down to New England in the\r\nface of the numerous difficulties with which this feat is associated.\r\nIf I am not mistaken, not a single historian or antiquarian of note\r\nhas taken Professor Horsford’s extremely unscientific treatment of the\r\nsagas or his Norse discoveries seriously, and the sober verdict of\r\nMr. Thorsteinn Erlingsson and Dr. V. Gudmundsson on the alleged Norse\r\nruins seems to show that Miss Cornelia Horsford has met with no better\r\nsuccess. To refute all the philological curiosities and illogical\r\nconclusions drawn by Professor Horsford in his ten treatises on the\r\nsubject would, however, require a book of at least five hundred pages,\r\nand nobody seems to think the question important enough to warrant such\r\nan output. The fact that Mr. A. H. Keane, in his recent work, Man, Past\r\nand Present, takes it for granted that the Norsemen met with Eskimos\r\nin New England in the year 1000 seems to prove, however, that this\r\npersistence in defending a baseless supposition is not merely a matter\r\nof innocent patriotism. Fortunately, the current year, which marks the\r\nnine hundredth anniversary of the discovery, will be sure to see some\r\nvaluable new treatises on the subject, and those who are sufficiently\r\ninterested furthermore need only consult the above-mentioned books to\r\ndiscover how many serious objections the New England theory really has\r\nto contend with. Permit me to mention one of them. Cape Cod has, it\r\nis true, one singular feature that suggests the Keel Cape of the best\r\nversion of the Vinland manuscripts--viz., sandy shores. As everybody\r\ncan see for himself, however, by consulting Mr. Reeve’s book, the\r\nexplorers sailed south from Keel Cape on the eastern shore till the\r\ncountry became indented with bays. At the mouth of one of these they\r\nestablished their first winter quarters (the so-called Streamfirth),\r\nand the next fall proceeded still farther south for a considerable time\r\ntill they came to “Hop,” the true Wineland. The extraordinary ease\r\nwith which Professor Horsford, in his book Landfall of Leif Ericson,\r\nundertakes to chop up this version, in order to make the explorers\r\nreturn to Boston from Cape Cod instead of continuing on their course,\r\nis something remarkable in the annals of historical research. But\r\neven then his theory fails utterly to satisfy the critical reader.\r\nThe trouble with most of the writers on this subject, not excluding a\r\nprofessional historian like Prof. John Fiske, is that they have failed\r\nto sift the material or see the force of Professor Storm’s criticism of\r\nthe Flat Island version. This being done, everything falls into line\r\nfor the Nova Scotia theory, due consideration being given to the fact\r\nthat an oral tradition of at least one hundred years intervened between\r\nthe events narrated and the first somewhat extended written record.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, owing to the last-mentioned fact, it is not\r\naltogether impossible that the Norsemen reached New England, it should\r\nbe distinctly understood that such a conclusion can only be drawn on\r\narchæological lines, the test of the sagas pointing clearly in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\n      JUUL DIESERUD.\r\n\r\n  FIELD COLUMBIAN MUSEUM, CHICAGO,\r\n    _December 7, 1899_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor’s Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE WAR SPIRIT._\r\n\r\nIt must be a matter of deep regret to all right-thinking men that\r\nthere should have been during the latter half of the century now\r\nexpiring so marked a revival of the war spirit. In the middle of the\r\ncentury it was thought by many that the world had learned wisdom from\r\nthe terrible experiences of the past, and that with the development\r\nof international trade war would become an outworn mode of settling\r\ninternational controversies. How different a turn things were destined\r\nto take need not here be told. Coming to recent events, however, we\r\nmay say that it is lamentable our own country could not have won by\r\npeaceful means whatever advantages it has secured by its recent war\r\nwith Spain. Equally lamentable is it that Great Britain, the other\r\ngreat representative of Anglo-Saxon civilization, should at this moment\r\nbe engaged in a still bloodier struggle over questions which it is hard\r\nto believe could not have been settled by negotiation. “Whence come\r\nwars and fightings among you?” is a question that was asked very long\r\nago, and we do not know that it is possible to improve on the answer\r\nthen given: “From your lusts.”\r\n\r\nWe do not say that a nation should not resist to the death a distinct\r\naggression on its liberties or its independence. We do not say that\r\nwhen horrors are being enacted in any part of the world force may not\r\nrighteously be employed to arrest them; but it is clear to our mind\r\nthat, in the present age, wars between civilized countries might be\r\nalmost wholly avoided if more reliance were placed upon moral force\r\nand less rein given to the impulse to employ physical force. This is a\r\nmatter for the people in any state enjoying free institutions to take\r\nto heart. Let every man in a time of national difficulty ask himself\r\nthis question: “Do I personally want to have blood shed over this\r\nmatter?” Or this one: “Am I personally indifferent whether or not this\r\ndispute ends in bloodshed?” If a nation or the majority of a nation\r\nwants to have blood shed over a dispute with another nation, or is\r\nindifferent as to whether that shall be the outcome, the discussion\r\nwill be carried on in a very different spirit from what it would be\r\nif there were a pronounced aversion to such a result. With nations,\r\nas with individuals, everything depends upon the spirit and ulterior\r\npurpose with which a question is approached. The cases must be very\r\nfew in which a great nation, safe itself from attack, might not, in\r\nany matter in which minor interests are involved, resolve within\r\nitself that it will not resort to war--that it will work, and continue\r\nto work, on moral lines, trusting that, if it has right on its side,\r\nit will in due time carry its point. If blood cries from the ground\r\nagainst the slayer, what must be the responsibility of those who\r\nheedlessly and ruthlessly give their voices for war, when patience,\r\nmoderation, and disinterestedness would have better accomplished every\r\nlegitimate purpose? Slaughter is slaughter, murder is murder, however\r\nwe may seek to weaken their import by a conventional treatment. War is\r\nmutual murder carried on professionally and systematically. Yet the\r\nprimal command still makes its solemn appeal to the human heart and\r\nconscience: “Thou shalt not kill.”\r\n\r\nIt is, unfortunately, only too easy to cultivate the military spirit\r\nin almost any nation, and the military spirit, it need hardly be said,\r\nis the spirit that seeks quarrels. To the military man war means\r\nexcitement, emulation, reputation, promotion, subject of course to the\r\npossibility of injury or death. No one denies that deeds of heroism and\r\nself-devotion are done on the battlefield; but that men should acquit\r\nthemselves nobly in the field is no compensation for the horrors of a\r\nwar brought on by the predominance of the military spirit.\r\n\r\n  “‘Great fame the Duke of Marlborough won,\r\n      And our good Prince Eugene.’--\r\n  ‘Oh, ’twas a very wicked thing,’\r\n      Said little Wilhelmine.”\r\n\r\nAnd every war is wicked and detestable that could consistently\r\nwith national honor be avoided. When we say “honor” we do not mean\r\n“reputation.” Reputation depends on the canons of judgment prevailing\r\namong those who presume to award it. In a dueling community a man’s\r\nreputation might suffer by declining a challenge, but his honor would\r\nbe intact if he declined from sincere unwillingness to do a wrong act.\r\nThere is much honor sometimes in sacrificing reputation, particularly\r\nthe “bubble reputation” that is won “in the cannon’s mouth.” Every\r\nappeal to the sword weakens the reliance placed upon principles of\r\njustice, and thus undoes a vast amount of the work of peace. When war\r\nis once set on foot, the national judgment is more or less blinded.\r\nTrue, it is the action of a majority of the people only--admitting\r\nthat a majority wanted it--but who is uncompromising enough, when his\r\ncountry’s armies are in the field, to proclaim that they are fighting\r\nin a wrong cause? A few may do it, but they do it at their peril. In\r\nall other matters a minority may censure with any degree of severity\r\nthe policy of the majority, but not in the matter of a war once entered\r\non. Yet how perverting such a situation is to right judgment, and how\r\ninjurious an effect it must have on the rising generation, are only too\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nThese reflections may not at first sight seem to have a very direct\r\nbearing on the interests for which this magazine is supposed to stand,\r\nbut to our mind science, in the broad sense, has no function so\r\nimportant as that of settling the education of the young upon a right\r\n_moral_ basis. No system of education deserves to be called scientific\r\nthat does not place the idea of justice at the very foundation of\r\nhuman life. You can not do this, however, without making it a working\r\nprinciple, and without inculcating a belief in it as such. Applying\r\nthe principle to national affairs, we see at once that a strong nation\r\nwhich desires to be just will take no advantage of its strength in\r\nits dealings with other nations. If it has a demand to make, it will\r\nmake it simply in the name of justice, and cast no sidelong glances at\r\nits up-to-date battle ships or its well-equipped battalions. It will\r\nhave unbounded patience with weaker communities, which, rightly or\r\nwrongly, may seem to think they have right on their side. It will not\r\nbe ashamed to shrink from the shedding of blood. The “young barbarians”\r\nof our public schools are always only too ready to exalt might above\r\nright; but the judicious teacher into whom the true spirit of science\r\nhas entered will seize every favorable opportunity for inculcating the\r\ngreat lesson that the moral law has a way of vindicating itself in the\r\nend, and that the inheritance of the earth has been promised not to the\r\nquarrelsome or the overweening, but to the meek. A generation brought\r\nup on these principles would be slow to make war, and their influence\r\non the world would be in every way powerful for good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_LANGUAGE AND LIFE._\r\n\r\nThe ordinary school education in language and grammar is doubtless\r\nresponsible for the impression which we find existing in so many minds\r\nthat, in all matters of verbal expression, there is some one absolute\r\nstandard of authority to which it implies simply ignorance not to\r\nbow--some supreme court, as it were, empowered to decide for us what\r\nwords we are to use, how we are to pronounce them, and what rules of\r\nsyntax we are to follow. It would be difficult, doubtless, to impart\r\nto children or very young people the wider and more scientific view of\r\nlanguage, inasmuch as they need, in the first place, clear guidance as\r\nregards usage rather than correct theory. The idea, therefore, with\r\nwhich they grow up, if their school studies take any hold upon them\r\nat all and if no wider culture comes to change their way of looking\r\nat things, is that some very wise man made an infallible grammar and\r\nanother very wise man an infallible dictionary, and that no one need be\r\nin doubt in regard to what is orthodox in language who has access to\r\nthese tables of the law. We have known grown-up persons to turn away\r\nwith a very skeptical air, and a kind of look as if they had found out\r\na weak spot in your educational armor, when they were told that really\r\nit was impossible to say which of two pronunciations of a word was\r\nright and which was wrong--that either might be employed without mortal\r\noffense against elegance of speech or good breeding.\r\n\r\nA hidebound view of language tends so much to narrow thought on general\r\nsubjects that it seems to us of importance that the true and scientific\r\nview of the subject should be brought forward whenever opportunity\r\noffers. Mr. William Archer, the well-known English critic, contributed\r\nan article not long ago to the Pall Mall Magazine which might be read\r\nwith much advantage by pedants and purists, and all blind followers of\r\nauthority. He takes the broad ground that language is a transcript,\r\nas it were, of life, and that as life widens and becomes more varied,\r\nlanguage must do the same. It must reflect the fancy, the imagination,\r\nand the humor of the day, and not merely the fancy, imagination, and\r\nhumor of past generations. If we want a language that is fixed and\r\nunalterable in its forms we must seek one that has ceased to be spoken\r\nby men. Even then we can not always get absolute decisions. Cicero is\r\nperhaps the best standard of Latin prose, but no competent critic would\r\nsay that his writing was flawless. We know that grammatical questions\r\nwere much debated among the ancients, and we have no doubt that many\r\nsuch questions were left unsettled. In a living language there must be\r\nunsettled questions. There is a constant struggle for life going on\r\namong the words and phrases with which men endeavor to express their\r\nideas, and, at a given moment, it is impossible to say which shall\r\nprosper, this or that. The word or phrase that prospers--that commends\r\nitself, after adequate trial, for expressiveness, convenience, or\r\neuphony, or for any combination of useful qualities--will survive and\r\nbecome classic; the expression that has nothing special to commend it,\r\nbeyond its novelty and slanginess, will probably pass, after a brief\r\nand partial currency, into the vast limbo of the unfit. All we can say\r\nof a word at a given moment is how far it has actually become current\r\nand what kind of society it keeps. What its fortune will be we can only\r\nguess. Just as in the financial world great fortunes are sometimes\r\nvery suddenly made and names before obscure spring into world-wide\r\nnotoriety, so, in the realm of language, a word of very uncertain\r\nancestry and no social repute may assert its right to recognition and\r\ntake its place among the best.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow from this that it can ever be a matter of\r\nindifference what words we use or what tricks we play with language,\r\nany more than it can be a matter of indifference what personal habits\r\nwe adopt. Language is the clothing of our thoughts, and as such it may\r\nexhibit the same qualities which attach to the clothing of our bodies.\r\nIt may be marked by neatness and propriety, or by slovenliness and\r\nwant of taste. Some men are over-dressed, and some affect over-fine\r\nlanguage. Some go after the latest novelties in the tailoring world,\r\nand some after the latest slang, asserting thereby their resolution\r\nto be up to date. It is needless to draw the parallel further, but\r\nit is evident that there is wide scope in the choice of language for\r\nthe exhibition of personal preference and personal character. We\r\nthink it safe to say that the interests of a language, considered as\r\nan instrument of thought, will be best promoted by those who pay due\r\nrespect to its established forms, and only countenance such neologisms\r\nas make good their claim to acceptance by supplying a real want. Mr.\r\nArcher, in the article we have referred to, states, and we do not\r\ndoubt with truth, that the English language has been greatly enriched\r\nand strengthened by the fact that it has been spoken and written by\r\nmillions of people on this side of the Atlantic, leading an intense and\r\nvigorous life of their own, under conditions very different in many\r\nrespects from those prevailing in the mother country. The language\r\nmoves with a freer step, beats with a stronger pulse, and assumes a\r\nmore imperial bearing from the fact that it expresses the activity and\r\nsums up the life of the foremost communities of the human race in both\r\nhemispheres.\r\n\r\nA great classical scholar not long ago wrote a letter to an English\r\nweekly newspaper expressing a very contemptuous estimate of the French\r\nlanguage, as being only a degraded form of Latin. He thought it a great\r\ndisgrace to the language that it had no better word for “much” than\r\n_beaucoup_, which, as he learnedly explained, came from two Latin words\r\nmeaning “fine” and “blow.” The most cursory examination of any language\r\nwill show that it abounds in just such verbal devices. We do not in\r\nEnglish put the words “great” and “stroke” together, but, using them\r\nseparately, we say “a great stroke” of luck and of many other things\r\nwhen there is no question of “striking” at all. In the same way we\r\nwould say “a great hit,” when there is no question of hitting, except\r\nby remote analogy. Languages grow rich and flexible precisely by the\r\nadoption of such convenient combinations. What they may originally have\r\nmeant becomes a matter of little moment when once they have become\r\nthoroughly accepted and thoroughly expressive. After they have become\r\nwelded together, as sometimes happens, in one word, it is an advantage\r\nrather than otherwise if the separate meanings of their constituent\r\nparts become lost to all except the professional etymologist. As long\r\nas the separate parts retain their separate meaning some sense of\r\nincongruity will sometimes arise in connection with the use of the\r\nterm. Thus to say “a handful of corn” is all right, but one might\r\nfeel that it was not all right to say “a mere handful of men.” Yet it\r\nwould be futile to criticise the expression which has become idiomatic\r\nEnglish. If the word “handful” had parted with its essential meaning\r\nas completely as say the word “troop” has, for all but etymologists,\r\nthere would be no kind of incongruity in its employment for any small\r\nnumber or quantity whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe scientific view of language, then, is that it represents the effort\r\nof mankind to use audible symbols for the expression of thought; that\r\nit follows the development of man’s activity and enlarges with his\r\nenlarging knowledge, and comprehension of things; that while its object\r\nis essentially a practical one it gathers beauty with use and age, and\r\nbegins to react on the minds of its makers; that its makers are the\r\npeople, not the grammarians, these being merely its policemen, who,\r\nuseful in general, are sometimes too officious; that great writers are\r\nthe architects who felicitously arrange materials which the people have\r\ngathered and shaped, placing the best of such materials where they can\r\nbe seen to best advantage; finally, that the language of each nation\r\nis its most precious possession, the record of its civilization, and\r\nthe repository of all that is best in its moral and intellectual life,\r\nand that it is therefore the duty of all who make any pretensions to\r\nliberal training to watch over their heritage and, while allowing all\r\nreasonable scope for further development, to guard it by all means in\r\ntheir power against degradation and pollution. A great people will\r\nhave a great language: when a language shows signs of weakness or\r\ndeclension, there is reason to fear for the civilization of which it is\r\nthe expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFragments of Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n=“Dark Lightning.”=--The attention of meteorologists and photographers\r\nhas been engaged to a considerable extent, within a few months past,\r\nwith the appearance on photographs of lightning of what seemed to\r\nbe dark flashes as well as bright ones. In the effort to account\r\nsatisfactorily for the phenomenon it has been referred to photographic\r\nreversal, due to extreme brilliancy; to a predominance of infra-red\r\nradiations; to the existence of flashes deficient in actinic rays; to\r\nchanges in the density of the air occasioned by the spark, when a dark\r\nline with a light line within it is shown if the air is compressed,\r\nand a light line inclosing a dark one if it is rarefied; and to some\r\nqualities of the photographic plate. The first real light was thrown on\r\nthe subject by some experiments described by Mr. A. W. Clayden, who,\r\nhaving photographed some electric sparks of different intensities,\r\nbefore developing the plates exposed them to the diffused light of\r\na gas flame. The brilliant sparks then yielded images which might\r\neither be called normal with a reversed margin, or reversed with a\r\nnormal core, while the fainter images were completely reversed--or,\r\nin other words, came out darker than the background. The “fogging” of\r\nthe picture, to produce this reversal, must be done after the image of\r\nthe flash is impressed; for if it is done before, the image appears\r\nlighter than the background. This effect, which is called the “Clayden\r\neffect,” is accepted as a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon\r\nby two of the authors who have most studied it--Dr. W. J. S. Lockyer\r\nand Prof. R. W. Wood, of the University of Wisconsin. Professor Wood,\r\non repeating Mr. Clayden’s experiment, obtained dark flashes without\r\nany difficulty, but as they failed to appear when the light of an\r\nincandescent lamp was substituted for the electric spark, he concludes\r\nthat there is something in the spark essential to the reversal. Dr.\r\nLockyer summarizes his conclusion by saying that dark-lightning flashes\r\n“do not exist in Nature, but their appearances on photographs are due\r\nto some chemical action which takes place in the gelatin film.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=“Warming Up.”=--“Warming up” is the expressive term of general\r\ncurrency, which Dr. E. G. Lancaster adopts to denote the process in\r\nwhich one starting on any work in a little while suffers a short\r\nperiod of fatigue, from which he soon recovers, to go on with new and\r\nincreased vigor. This occurs in the course of walks, with students\r\nengaged in earnest reading or in writing, and in animals, as in dogs\r\non the chase, the animals pursued, and racehorses. “It is said of two\r\nfamous trotters, each of which has reduced the world’s record within a\r\nfew years, that the period of warming up was very characteristic....\r\nAthletes, especially ball players, realize the importance of practice\r\njust before the games, to be followed by a slight rest. A pitcher\r\nwould hardly enter the box till he had got his arm in working order\r\nby a few minutes’ practice. Orators often are dull at first, but warm\r\nup. It is said that Wendell Phillips was often hissed for his slow,\r\nuninteresting speech, but rallied to the occasion at such times with\r\nhis masterly oratory.” Dr. Lancaster has experimented on the phenomena,\r\nusing a method like those of Mosso and of Lombard in the psychological\r\nlaboratory at Clark University, and publishes the results, with details\r\nand curves, in the papers of the Colorado College Scientific Society.\r\nHe tried ten or twelve subjects, experimenting on the middle finger\r\nof the right hand, and gaining most of his results from four or five\r\npersons. He finds that warming up is general, but not universal. One\r\nsubject always did his best work first. He likewise showed no warming\r\nup in his mental work. The phenomenon called “second mind” is closely\r\nallied to warming up, but is not the same. The author is of the opinion\r\nthat the importance of this process is greatly misunderstood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Sixty Years’ Improvements in Steamships.=--A review of what has\r\nbeen accomplished in sixty years in the improvement of transatlantic\r\ntraffic, given by Sir William H. White in his address at the British\r\nAssociation on Steam Navigation at High Speeds, shows that speed has\r\nbeen increased from eight and a half to twenty-two and a half knots\r\nan hour, and the time of the voyage has been brought down to about\r\nthirty-eight per cent of what it was in 1838. Ships have been more than\r\ntrebled in length, about doubled in breadth, and increased tenfold in\r\ndisplacement. The number of passengers carried by a steamship has been\r\nenlarged from about one hundred to nearly two thousand. The engine\r\npower has been made forty times as great. The ratio of horse power to\r\nthe weight driven has been quadrupled. The rate of coal consumption\r\nper horse power per hour is now only about one third what it was in\r\n1840. Had the old rate of coal consumption continued, instead of three\r\nthousand tons of coal, nine thousand would have been required for a\r\nvoyage at twenty-two knots. Had the engines been proportionately as\r\nheavy as those in use sixty years ago, they would have weighed about\r\nfourteen thousand tons. In other words, machinery, boilers, and coal\r\nwould have exceeded the total weight of the Campania as she floats\r\nto-day. “There could not be a more striking illustration than this\r\nof the close relation between improvements in marine engineering at\r\nhigh speed. Equally true is it that this development could not have\r\nbeen accomplished but for the use of improved materials and structural\r\narrangements.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=American Advances in Forestry.=--The Department of Agriculture having\r\ndetermined to prepare a book for the Paris Exposition, reviewing\r\nwhat has been accomplished in scientific agriculture in the United\r\nStates, the Division of Forestry will contribute to it a short history\r\nof forestry in the United States, with an account of the efforts of\r\nprivate landholders to apply the principles of forestry. Much more has\r\nbeen accomplished in the United States in the way of forestry than has\r\nbeen supposed. Mr. Pinchot, the forester of the division, holds that\r\nwherever private owners have made the effort to use the merchantable\r\ntimber on their woodland without injuring its productive power, and to\r\nestablish new forests, there has been the intention of true forestry.\r\nThe methods may have been imperfect, but they have tended toward\r\neconomic forest management so far as their object was the continued\r\nuse of the land for producing woods. Among the measures looking in\r\nthis direction Mr. Pinchot mentions in his circular the practice\r\nwhich has been adopted “because it pays,” in some of the spruce lands\r\nof the Northwest, of leaving the small trees standing, so that the\r\nlumbermen can return for a second crop earlier than would otherwise\r\nbe possible; and the adoption by farmers of methods in getting their\r\nwood, for saving the best trees and promoting their growth and that\r\nof the new ones; of keeping sprout lands to be cut over regularly and\r\nsystematically, for periodical renewal, and of tree planting on waste\r\nplaces, hillsides liable to be washed, and the banks of streams. Other\r\nforms of planting are the institution of wind breaks in the treeless\r\nWest, and special plantations for fence posts, etc. A kind of forestry\r\npractice is likewise indicated in the special pains that are taken\r\nby farmers and in lumbering districts to lessen the danger of fires.\r\nForester Pinchot desires that all the information that can be gained be\r\ncommunicated to him for the proposed article.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Professor Putnam on the Origins of the American Races.=--In his\r\naddress as retiring President of the American Association, Prof. F. W.\r\nPutnam, after expressing his high opinion of the late Dr. D. G. Brinton\r\nand his scientific labors, referred to the differences of opinion that\r\nhad existed between them in respect to the origin of the American\r\npeoples, and proceeded to expound his own views on the subject. He\r\nregarded the term “mound-builders” as comprehensive enough to include\r\nall the peoples who had left the marks of their former presence in\r\nthis country. Even the shell heaps could not be regarded as the work\r\nof one people. From the time of the earliest deposits--which were of\r\ngreat antiquity--to the present, such refuse piles had been made and\r\nmany of the sites reoccupied, sometimes even by a different people.\r\nSo with the mounds of earth and stone; many of them are of great\r\nantiquity, while others were made within the historic period, and even\r\nduring the first half of the present century. These works were devoted\r\nto a variety of purposes, and there are many different kinds of them.\r\nBesides the mounds, there are groups of earthworks of a different order\r\nof structure, that must be considered by themselves--great embankments,\r\nfortifications, and singular structures on hills and plateaus that are\r\nin marked contrast to the ordinary conical mounds, and mounds in the\r\nform of animals and of man. The considerable antiquity of these older\r\nearthworks is proved by the accumulation of mold and the forest growth\r\nupon them. “If all mounds of shell, earth, or stone, fortifications\r\non hills, or places of religious and ceremonial rites, are classed,\r\nirrespective of their structure, contents, or time of formation, as\r\nthe work of one people, and that people is designated as the ‘American\r\nIndian’ or the ‘American race,’ and considered the only people ever\r\ninhabiting America north and south, we are simply ... not giving fair\r\nconsideration to differences, while overestimating resemblances.”\r\nCiting analogies between our earthworks and Mexican structures, and\r\nlooking upon the Pueblos as a connecting link, “we must regard the\r\nculture of the builders of the ancient earthworks as one and the same\r\nwith that of ancient Mexico, although modified by environment. Our\r\nnorthern and eastern tribes came in contact with this people when\r\nthey pushed their way southward and westward, and many of their arts\r\nand customs still linger among some of our Indian tribes. It is this\r\nabsorption and admixture of the stocks that has in the course of\r\nthousands of years brought all our peoples into a certain uniformity.\r\nThis does not, however, prove a unity of race.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Heat Insulators.=--Mr. C. L. Norton has made experiments, at the\r\nrequest of Mr. Edward Atkinson, in order to determine the relative\r\nefficiency of several kinds of steam-pipe covering now on the market;\r\nto ascertain the fire risk attendant upon the use of certain methods\r\nand materials employed for insulation of steam pipes; to show the gain\r\nin economy attendant upon the increase of thickness of coverings; and\r\nto find the exact financial return that may be expected from a given\r\noutlay for covering steam pipes. A method of experimentation was\r\nadopted which represented as nearly as practicable the conditions\r\nexisting in the actual use of steam pipes. Of sixteen non-conducting\r\npreparations tried, the most efficient were found to be those made of\r\ncork; next was a cover composed of an inner jacket of earthy material\r\nand an outer jacket of wool felt; and next magnesia. In reference to\r\nthe last substance it is, however, observed that, while it is a most\r\neffective non-conductor, the name has been applied to many compounds\r\nof which the greater part consist of carbonate of lime or plaster of\r\nParis, materials which are not good as heat retardents. Asbestos is\r\nmerely a non-combustible material in which air may be entrapped, but,\r\nwhen non-porous, is a good conductor of heat. Generally speaking, a\r\ncover saves heat enough to pay for itself in a little less than a year\r\nat three hundred and ten ten-hour days, and in about four months at\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five twenty-four-hour days. The decision as to\r\nthe choice of cover must, however, come from other considerations, as\r\nwell as from that of non-conductivity. Ability to withstand the action\r\nof heat for a prolonged period without being destroyed or rendered\r\nless efficient is of vital importance. The cork coverings were found\r\nto respond to this test extremely well, and there can be no question\r\nrespecting magnesia; but Mr. Norton does not consider it safe to put\r\nupon a steam pipe wool, hair, felt, or woolen felt in any form, though\r\nthe danger is not likely to accrue when an inch of fireproof material\r\nstands between the felt and the pipe. In general it may be said that\r\nif five years is the life of a cover, one inch is the most economical\r\nthickness, while a cover which has a life of ten years may to advantage\r\nbe made two inches thick. The method of judging a pipe cover by the\r\nwarmth felt on putting the hand upon it is fallacious; the sensation\r\ndepends so much upon the nature of the surface that it utterly fails to\r\ngive any idea of the actual temperature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Effect of Sea Water on Soil.=--In a paper read at the British\r\nAssociation, 1899, on the chemical effect of the salts of the\r\nsalt-water flood of November 27, 1897, on the east coast of England,\r\nMessrs. T. S. Dymond and F. Hughes recorded the remarkable result that,\r\nalthough the proportion of salt left in the soil was insufficient to\r\nprove injurious to growing crops, the earthworms were entirely removed,\r\nwith the consequence that very few crops were worth harvesting the\r\nfollowing year. In the next year nine tenths of the salt at first\r\npresent had disappeared from the soil, and young worms had again\r\nmade their appearance, but still the condition of the soil remained\r\nunsatisfactory, the rate of percolation of water through the flooded\r\nearth being only one half as rapid as through the unflooded. The\r\nauthors ascribe this to the action of the chlorides of the sea water on\r\nthe silicates of the soil with the formation of silicate of alumina in\r\na gelatinous condition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=The War against Monopolies.=--Mr. Robert Ewen writes, in the\r\nWestminster Review, demanding free bank circulation as likely to\r\nbe a very effective weapon to be used in “the coming contest with\r\nmonopolists.” The subject seems to have attracted official attention\r\nin England in 1875, when Sir Stafford Northcote was Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. As chairman of the committee appointed to inquire into the\r\nworking of the Bank Acts, he submitted a memorandum showing that,\r\nwhile certain items of the monopoly enjoyed by the Bank of England\r\nhad been withdrawn, a residuum of restrictions on issuing banks still\r\nremained unrepealed. Some other countries have found a way of giving\r\nelasticity to the currency by buying in and laying aside their bonds,\r\nas the United States has recently been doing. This can not be done\r\nin Great Britain, because the Bank of England and the other bank\r\nmonopolists block the way. The bank is tied down by acts of Parliament\r\nto buy and sell gold at a fixed price, and this restriction has been\r\na cause of panics, whereas had gold been allowed to rise and fall in\r\nprice, according to supply and demand, and the bank got a free hand in\r\ndealing with that commodity and in issuing legal notes to supply the\r\ncirculating medium, “all would have gone well.” Foreign protectionists\r\nnow have the power to prevent British goods from getting into their\r\nmarkets by imposing heavy duties on them, and at the same time forcing\r\ntheir produce into British markets, because English laws allow\r\nthem to get gold from the English cheaper than their goods can be\r\nobtained. “Suppose a merchant in Britain buys £100,000 worth of corn\r\nfrom America and gives a check on the Bank of England for the amount\r\nof the purchase. The American draws the £100,000 in gold and takes it\r\nhome; he will have to pay no export or import duty thereon--indeed,\r\nthe probability is he may get a premium on the gold in America. But\r\nreverse the transaction: Suppose the British merchant sold £100,000\r\nworth of his goods to America, there would, in the first place, be\r\nthe exorbitant duty imposed there upon our manufactures of from forty\r\nto fifty per cent. Or suppose our merchant wished to buy corn or any\r\nAmerican produce in exchange for his goods in place of bringing money,\r\nthe case would be different--it would tell against the American farmer,\r\nwho would get a less price for his corn, etc., than he would have done\r\nby free trade.” This instance is given “to show how free trade in\r\ngold would bring about free trade and reciprocity between the United\r\nStates and Britain, and is applicable to every other state with which\r\nwe trade.... There should be full scope given to all good banks in\r\nthe country, large or small, to carry on banking business in the best\r\nmodern manner for the benefit of all parties, so as to encourage and\r\ndevelop all trades and industries.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Rats and the Plague.=--In his introductory address at the opening\r\nof the London School of Tropical Medicine, Dr. Manson preached a war\r\nof extermination against rats with the vigor of Cato calling for\r\nthe destruction of Carthage. “Were I asked,” he said, “how I would\r\nprotect a state from plague, I would certainly answer, Exterminate\r\nthe rats as a first and most important measure.” He added, “At the\r\npresent juncture, were I the responsible sanitary head of any town in\r\nEurope, in anticipation of a possibility compared to which in horror\r\nand in destructiveness a general European war would be a trifle, I\r\nwould do my best to have every rat and, if possible, every mouse in\r\nmy district promptly exterminated.” Dr. Manson does not reveal his\r\nplan of campaign. Wholesale poisoning of sewers might have serious\r\ndisadvantages, and there would be difficulties about inveigling the\r\nrodent population of these subterranean health resorts (as some\r\nenthusiasts consider them to be) into a lethal chamber. Are we to cry\r\nhavoc and let slip the _cats_ of war? or to hurl an army of snakes\r\nagainst the foe? In either case we might find ourselves in the awkward\r\nposition of a king who had called a too powerful auxiliary to his aid.\r\nAlready action is being taken on the rat theory of plague. The French\r\nGovernment has ordered that special precautions are to be taken to\r\nprevent the importation of rats in vessels from plague-stricken places.\r\nIt is to be hoped that similar precautions will be taken in regard to\r\nthe transports which convey the Indian contingent to the Cape, or the\r\nsituation there may become complicated by the intervention of an enemy\r\nwho will deal destruction impartially to Boers and to Britons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Forestry in California.=--As a remedy for the devastation of the\r\nforest lands of California, Marsden Manson, having shown that\r\nGovernment administrations with politics in them can not be trusted in\r\nthe matter, recommends that all forest reservations and public lands\r\nupon mountain slopes within the borders of the State be granted to the\r\nUniversity of California in trust, for the purpose of maintaining,\r\ndeveloping, and extending the water supply of those regions forever.\r\nFor this purpose the regents should be empowered to lease, under\r\nproper control, the timber cutting and pasturage privileges of those\r\nareas, and to use the resultant fund to protect the catchment areas,\r\nto maintain a college of practical forestry, to construct reservoirs\r\nat such points as may be necessary to the industries of the State, and\r\ndispose of the water for the benefit of the trust, to acquire mountain\r\nlands to be added to the catchment areas, and to do all such things as\r\nmay maintain wise systems of forest and water conservation and use.\r\nThe extent of income-bearing property which can be made available for\r\nforest preservation and storage of flood waters, Mr. Manson says, is\r\nfar beyond the general idea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Another New Element.=--The mineral pitchblende is distinguished for\r\nits radio-activity, or the property it has of emitting the peculiar\r\nlight-rays which have recently attracted attention. The property\r\nhas been attributed to the presence of uranium, one of the most\r\nradio-active among the known metals. About a year ago the chemists M.\r\nand Madame Curie, examining the different substances in pitchblende,\r\nfound among them two new radiant substances, both more active than\r\nuranium, which they called polonium and radium. Polonium was found\r\nto be closely akin to bismuth, accompanying that metal in all its\r\nreactions, but separable from it by fractionation. Radium resembles\r\nbarium in its chemical reactions. Recently M. A. Debierne, examining\r\none of the products of solution and precipitation of pitchblende,\r\nobserved intensified radio-active properties in a portion containing\r\ntitanium, and on further investigation found still another substance\r\nshowing the principal analytical properties of titanium, but which\r\nemitted extremely active rays. While these rays were comparable with\r\nthose observed from polonium and radium, the chemical properties are\r\nentirely different from those of these substances. Radium, however, is\r\nspontaneously luminous, while the new substance is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR PARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nSome recent experiments were made by Armand Gautier on the amount\r\nof the chlorides contained in sea air. They were conducted at the\r\nlighthouse at Rochedouvres, situated about fifty-five kilometres from\r\nthe coast, during and after the long continuance of a good breeze\r\ndirectly inshore from the Atlantic. The air was drawn through a long\r\ntube containing glasswork, and this well then analyzed. He found that\r\nin a litre of air there was only 0.022 of a gramme of chloride of\r\nsodium. Small as this quantity is, it suffices, perhaps, with the aid\r\nof the traces of sodium present, to give sea air its tonic qualities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second International Congress on Hypnotism is to be held in Paris,\r\nAugust 12 to 16, 1900, Dr. Jules Voisin presiding. The programme of\r\ndiscussions includes such topics as the terminology of hypnotism,\r\nits relations to hysteria, its application to general therapeutics,\r\nthe indications of it and suggestions for the treatment of mental\r\ndisease and alcoholism, its application to general pedagogy and mental\r\northopædics, its value as a means of pathological investigation, its\r\nrelation to the practice of medicine and to jurisprudence, and special\r\nresponsibilities arising from the practice of experimental hypnotism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is from a recent letter to Science by Prof. James H.\r\nHyslop, of Columbia University: “So much has been published far and\r\nwide this last summer about my intention ‘to scientifically demonstrate\r\nthe immortality of the soul within a year,’ that it is due to the facts\r\nbearing upon the choice between materialism and spiritism to say that I\r\nhave never made any such professions as have been alleged. I wish the\r\nscientific public that still has the bad habit of reading and believing\r\nthe newspapers to know that I was careful to deny that I made any such\r\npretensions as were so generally attributed to me. More than one half\r\nthe interviews alleged to have been held with me were the fabrications\r\nof reporters who never saw me, and the other half omitted what I did\r\nsay and published what I did not say.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome novel results have been obtained by M. Baillaud, of the Toulouse\r\nObservatory, France, from recent observations of the annular nebula in\r\nLyra and comparisons with photographs taken in 1890. Among them are\r\nthe discovery of small stars in the central space of the ring, the\r\nexistence of bright points on the ring itself, a more distinct figure\r\nof the central star on the later photographs, giving it the aspect of\r\na true star, and greater brightness in the central space, and certain\r\nchanges in the shape of the edge of the ring, which shows at one\r\npoint, more distinctly than in 1890, an eminence indicating a jet of\r\nmatter escaping from the ring. Other nebulæ, especially that called\r\nthe Dumb-bell and the nebula in the Crown, are spoken of as exhibiting\r\nsimilar phenomena.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Manual-Training School, which is said to be the first\r\nindependent manual-training school in the United States, is now in its\r\nsixteenth year, having been founded in 1883 by the Commercial Club of\r\nChicago. It has been, since 1897, an integral part of the University\r\nof Chicago. While its peculiar feature is manual training, it also\r\nfurnishes instruction in the essential studies of a high-school course.\r\nThe shop work and drawing are eminently practical. The making of a\r\nmachine, such as a lathe or steam engine, is begun by the pupils in the\r\ndrawing room, and is followed by them through the pattern-making shop,\r\nthe foundry, and the forge room, and is perfected in the machine shop.\r\nThe forge tools and engine-lathe tools are made by pupils. The courses\r\nof the school include a business course, a technological course, and a\r\ncollege preparatory course.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology has received, by the will of\r\nMr. Edward Austin, deceased at the age of ninety-four years, a bequest\r\nof $400,000, the interest of which is to be used for the assistance\r\nof needy and meritorious teachers in prosecuting their studies. In\r\naddition to this bequest, the institute received, during 1898, an\r\naccession of $928,000 to its general funds, and one of $46,000 to its\r\nscholarship funds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the recent meeting of the Allied Scientific Societies, at New Haven,\r\nConn., Mr. G. K. Gilbert, of the United States Geological Survey, was\r\nchosen to act as retiring President of the American Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, in place of Prof. Edward Orton, deceased.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the Allied Scientific Societies of the United States was\r\nheld in New Haven, Conn., during holiday week. It was much larger than\r\neither of the meetings previously held, and was attended by nearly five\r\nhundred members, representing ten societies--viz., the American Society\r\nof Naturalists, the Association of American Anatomists, the American\r\nMorphological, Physiological, Psychological, and Chemical Societies,\r\nthe Society for Plant Morphology and Physiology, the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, and the Archæological\r\nAssociation of America. The discussions were all interesting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great Roman Catholic Missionary Society, the Sacred Congregation\r\nof the Propagation of the Faith, is reported to have sent a circular\r\nto all its missionaries urging them to interest themselves in the\r\ncollection of natural-history specimens for scientific societies and\r\ninstitutions. This is intended, it is said, to interest and encourage\r\nmissionaries who have a scientific bent, and to inform the world that\r\nthe Church is not hostile to biological research.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have to record, among the later deaths of men in science, the\r\nnames of Francis Guthrie, formerly Professor of Mathematics in Graaff\r\nReinet College and afterward in South African College till 1898, aged\r\nsixty-eight years; he was interested in botany, on which he gave public\r\nlectures, and, with Harry Bolus, revised the order of Heaths for _Flora\r\ncapensis_; Prof. P. Knuth, botanist and author of researches on the\r\nrelations of insects and flowers and on cross-fertilization, at Kiel,\r\nGermany, aged forty-five years; he had published two of the projected\r\nthree volumes of the _Handbuch der Blüten Biologie_; Prof. R. Yatube,\r\nJapanese botanist; Ferdinand Tiemann, honorary Professor of Chemistry\r\nin the University of Berlin; Alexander McDougall, inventor, sixty years\r\nago, of an atmospheric railway, and since of many useful mechanical and\r\nchemical appliances, at Southport, England; Dr. Camera Pestana, chief\r\nof the Bacteriological Institute at Lisbon, Portugal, of plague, which\r\nhe contracted while experimenting with it at Oporto; and Prof. Elliott\r\nCoues, an American naturalist, most distinguished in ornithology, in\r\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, December 25th, after a surgical\r\noperation, aged sixty-seven years; he had been a professor in Norwich\r\nUniversity, Vermont, and in the National Medical College in Washington,\r\nand had done scientific work while in the military service of the\r\nGovernment, in the Geological Survey, and in the United States Northern\r\nBoundary Commission; and was the author of several books on ornithology\r\nand on the Fur-bearing Animals, besides editing the journals of Lewis\r\nand Clark and other books of American exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS RECEIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgricultural Experiment Stations.
