ALLEN,\r\n\r\nIn the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for the\r\nSouthern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the following work, on the History, Breeding, Management,\r\nDiseases, &c., of Domestic Animals, is to afford the Stock-breeder and\r\nGrazier a connected view of the entire subject in which he has so deep\r\nan interest. The writer has endeavored to compress within the limited\r\nspace assumed as necessary to secure a general circulation and perusal,\r\nsuch principles and practice, and give to each that relative prominence,\r\nwhich it becomes the practical man to observe, to realize the greatest\r\namount of value for the labor and capital devoted to his pursuits.\r\n\r\nTheir history is essential, as it shows their introduction into the\r\nUnited States, their progress during the various stages of their\r\nimprovement, and the comparative value of the improved and ordinary\r\nbreeds. A knowledge of the best mode of breeding and management is of\r\nstill higher importance. The first will enable the breeder to preserve\r\nthe high character of the animals in his hands, or perhaps still farther\r\nto advance them; while proper management and feeding will prevent that\r\ndeterioration and loss from disease, which frequently subtract so much\r\nfrom his profits.\r\n\r\nA larger space has been purposely devoted to the last topics, in\r\npreference to the subject of diseases, as prevention is not only less\r\ntroublesome than cure, but much more economical. Feeding and management,\r\nafter breeding, are really the important objects in view to the\r\nStock-breeder and Grazier, for if these be judiciously attended to,\r\ndisease among the herds will rarely be known.\r\n\r\nThe subject of animal diseases is complicated and little understood; and\r\nto be properly comprehended, requires years close, intelligent study,\r\nunder every advantage for obtaining the necessary information. Nearly\r\nevery disorder assumes various shades of difference, and to remove it\r\neffectually a corresponding change of treatment is required. How absurd\r\nthen the idea, that a compilation of formal remedies, administered by an\r\nunskilful or inexperienced manager, will be of material service in\r\nrescuing his herds or flocks from the ravages of disease. All that can\r\nconsistently be done, is to give a few simple remedies for the most\r\ncommon and well-known ailments, and leave to nature or a professional\r\nfarrier, such as are more complex or unusual.\r\n\r\nThis work (with many subsequent and important additions) constitutes a\r\nsmall part of the \"Compend of American Agriculture,\" the favorable\r\nreception of which, though but recently given to the public, has induced\r\nthe writer to offer this important division of the subject in its\r\npresent detached form.\r\n\r\nNew York, November, 1847\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  Animals, domestic, reared in the U.

A few Asses are bred, but for no other object than to keep up\r\nthe supply of jacks for propagating mules. We have also goats, rabbits,\r\nand the house domestics, the dog and cat; the two former, only in very\r\nlimited numbers, but both the latter much beyond our legitimate wants.\r\nThere have been a few specimens of the Alpaca imported, and an\r\narrangement is now in progress for the introduction of a flock of\r\nseveral hundred, which, if distributed among intelligent and wealthy\r\nagriculturists, as proposed, will test their value for increasing our\r\nagricultural resources. We shall confine ourselves to some general\r\nconsiderations, connected with the first-mentioned and most important of\r\nour domestic animals.\r\n\r\nTheir number as shown by the agricultural statistics collected in 1839,\r\nby order of our General Government, was 15,000,000 neat cattle;\r\n4,335,000 horses and mules, (the number of each not being specified;)\r\n19,311,000 sheep; and 26,300,000 swine. There is much reason to question\r\nthe entire accuracy of these returns, yet there is doubtless an\r\napproximation to the truth. Sheep have greatly increased since that\r\nperiod, and would probably number, the present year, (1848,) not less\r\nthan 30,000,000; and if our own manufactures continue to thrive, and we\r\nshould moreover become wool exporters, of which there is now a\r\nreasonable prospect, an accurate return for 1850, will undoubtedly give\r\nus not less than 33,000,000 for the entire Union. There has been a great\r\nincrease in the value of the other animals enumerated, but not in a\r\nratio corresponding with that of sheep. This is not only manifest in\r\ntheir augmented numbers, but in the gradual and steady improvement of\r\nthe species.\r\n\r\nIt may be safely predicted, that this improvement will not only be\r\nsustained, but largely increased; for there are some intelligent and\r\nspirited breeders to be found in every section of the country, whose\r\nliberal exertions and successful examples are doing much for this\r\nobject. Wherever intelligence and sound judgment are to be found, it\r\nwill be impossible long to resist the effects of a comparison between\r\nanimals, which, on an equal quantity of the same food, with the same\r\nattention and in the same time, will return 50, 20, or even 10 per cent.\r\nmore in their intrinsic value or marketable product, than the ordinary\r\nclass. This improvement has been, relatively, most conspicuous in the\r\nWestern and Southern states; not that the present average of excellence\r\nin their animals surpasses, or even reaches that of the North and East;\r\nbut the latter have long been pursuing this object, with more or less\r\nenergy, and they have for many years had large numbers of excellent\r\nspecimens of each variety; while with few exceptions, if we exclude the\r\nblood-horse or racing nag, the former have, till recently, paid\r\ncomparatively little attention to the improvement of their domestic\r\nanimals. The spirit for improvement through extensive sections, is now\r\nawakened, and the older settled portions of the country may hereafter\r\nexpect competitors, whose success will be fully commensurate with their\r\nown. Before going into the management of the different varieties, we\r\nwill give some general principles and remarks applicable to the\r\ntreatment of all.\r\n\r\n_The purpose for which animals are required_, should be first\r\ndetermined, before selecting such as may be necessary either for\r\nbreeding or use. Throughout the Northeastern states, cows for the dairy,\r\noxen for the yoke, and both for the butcher, are wanted. In much of the\r\nWest and South, beef alone is the principal object; while the dairy is\r\nneglected, and the work of the ox is seldom relied on, except for\r\noccasional drudgery.\r\n\r\nSheep may be wanted almost exclusively for the fleece, or for the fleece\r\nand heavy mutton, or in the neighborhood of markets, for large early\r\nlambs. The pastures and winter food, climate, and other conditions,\r\npresent additional circumstances, which should be well considered before\r\ndetermining on the particular breed, either of cattle or sheep, that\r\nwill best promote the interest of the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe kind of work for which the horse may be wanted, whether as a\r\nroadster, for the saddle, as a heavy team horse, or the horse of all\r\nwork, must be first decided, before selecting the form or character of\r\nthe animal.\r\n\r\nThe range of pig excellence is more circumscribed, as it is only\r\nnecessary to breed such as will yield the greatest amount of valuable\r\ncarcass, within the shortest time, and with the least expense.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES OF BREEDING.\r\n\r\nAll breeding is founded on the principle, that _like begets like_. This\r\nis, however, liable to some exceptions, and is much more generally true\r\nwhen _breeding down_ than when _breeding up_. If two animals (which can\r\nnever be exactly similar in all respects) are requisite to the\r\nperpetuation of the species, it necessarily results, that the progeny\r\nmust differ in a more or less degree from each parent. With wild\r\nanimals, and such of the domestic as are allowed to propagate without\r\nthe interference of art, and whose habits, treatment, and food are\r\nnearly similar to their natural condition, the change through successive\r\ngenerations is scarcely perceptible. It is only when we attempt to\r\nimprove their good qualities, that it is essential carefully to\r\ndetermine, and rigidly to apply, what are adopted as the present\r\nscientific principles of breeding. We cannot believe that we have\r\npenetrated beyond the mere threshold of this art. Unless, then, we\r\nlaunch into experiments, which are necessarily attended with\r\nuncertainty, our duty will be, to take for our guide the most successful\r\npractice of modern times, until further discoveries enable us to modify\r\nor add to such as are already known and adopted. We may assume, then, as\r\nthe present rules for this art,\r\n\r\n1st. That the animals selected for breed, should unite in themselves all\r\nthe good qualities we wish to perpetuate in the offspring.\r\n\r\n2d. These qualities, technically called _points_, should be inbred in\r\nthe animals as far as practicable, by a long line of descent from\r\nparents similarly constituted. The necessity for this rule is evident\r\nfrom the fact, that in mixing different species, and especially\r\nmongrels, with a long-established breed, the latter will most strongly\r\nstamp the issue with its own peculiarities. This is forcibly illustrated\r\nin the case of the Devon cattle, an ancient race, whose color, form, and\r\ncharacteristics are strikingly perpetuated, sometimes to the sixth or\r\neven a later generation. So far is this principle carried by many\r\nexperienced breeders, that they will use an animal of indifferent\r\nexternal appearance, but of approved descent, (_blood_,) in preference\r\nto a decidedly superior one, whose pedigree is imperfect.\r\n\r\n3d. All the conditions of soil, situation, climate, treatment, and food,\r\nshould be favorable to the object sought.\r\n\r\n4th. As a general rule, the female should be relatively larger than the\r\nmale. This gives ample room for the perfect development of the f[oe]tus,\r\neasy parturition, and a large supply of milk for the offspring, at a\r\nperiod in its existence, when food has a greater influence in perfecting\r\ncharacter and form, than at any subsequent time.\r\n\r\n5th. Exceptions to this rule may be made, when greater size is required\r\nthan can be obtained from the female, and especially when more vigor and\r\nhardiness of constitution are desirable. For this purpose, strong\r\nmasculine development in the sire is proper, and if otherwise\r\nunattainable, something of coarseness may be admitted, as this may be\r\nafterwards corrected, and nothing will atone for want of constitution\r\nand strength.\r\n\r\n6th. Pairing should be with a strict reference to correcting the\r\nimperfections of one animal, by a corresponding excellence in the other.\r\n\r\n7th. _Breeding in-and-in_, or propagating from animals nearly allied,\r\nmay be tolerated under certain circumstances, though seldom; and only in\r\nextreme cases between those of the same generation, as brother and\r\nsister. When the animal possesses much stamina and peculiar merit, which\r\nit is desired to perpetuate in the breed, it may be done either in the\r\nascending or descending line, as in breeding the son to the parent, or\r\nthe parent to his own progeny. This has been practised with decided\r\nadvantage, and in some cases has even been continued successively, as\r\nlow as the sixth generation.\r\n\r\n8th. It is always better to avoid close relationship, by the selection\r\nof equally meritorious stock-getters of the same breed, from other\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n9th. Wholesome, nutritious food, at all times sufficient to keep the\r\nanimals steadily advancing, should be provided, but they must never be\r\nallowed to get fat. Of the two evils, starving is preferable to surfeit.\r\nCareful treatment, and the absence of disease, must be always fully\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n10th. Animals should never be allowed to breed either too early or too\r\nlate in life. These periods cannot be arbitrarily laid down, but must\r\ndepend on their time of maturity, the longevity of the breed, and the\r\nstamina of the individual.\r\n\r\n11th. No violent cross, or mixing of distinct breeds, should ever be\r\nadmitted for the purposes of perpetuation, as of cattle of diverse\r\nsizes; horses of unlike characters; the Merino and the long-wools, or\r\neven the long, or short, and the middle-wools. For carcass and\r\nconstitution, these crosses are unexceptionable; and it is a practice\r\nvery common in this country, and judicious enough where the whole\r\nproduce is early destined for the shambles. But when the progeny are\r\ndesigned for breeders, the practice should be branded with unqualified\r\nreprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL FORM AND CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\nWithin certain limits, these may be reduced to a common standard. All\r\nanimals should have a good head, well set up; a clean fine muzzle, and a\r\nblight, clear and full, yet perfectly placid eye. With the exception of\r\nthe dog and cat, whose original nature is ferocity, and whose whole\r\nlife, unless diverted from their natural instincts, is plunder and prey;\r\nand the jockey racehorse, which is required to take the purse, at any\r\nhazard of life or limb to the groom; a mild, quiet eye is indispensable\r\nto the profitable use of the domestic brute. The neck should be well\r\nformed, not too long, tapering to its junction with the head, and\r\ngradually enlarging to a firm, well-expanded attachment to the back,\r\nshoulders, and breast. The back or chine should be short, straight, and\r\nbroad; the ribs springing out from the backbone nearly at right angles,\r\ngiving a rounded appearance to the carcass, and reaching well behind to\r\na close proximity to the hip; tail well set on, and full at its junction\r\nwith the body, yet gradually tapering to fineness; thighs, fore-arms,\r\nand crops well developed; projecting breast or brisket; the fore-legs\r\nstraight, and hind ones properly bent, strong and full where attached to\r\nthe carcass, but small and tapering below; good and sound joints; dense,\r\nstrong bones, but not large; plenty of fine muscle in the right places;\r\nand hair or wool, fine and soft. The chest in all animals should be\r\nfull, for it will be invariably found, that only such will do the most\r\nwork, or fatten easiest on the least food.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lungs.\r\n\r\nFrom the last-mentioned principle, founded on long experience and\r\nobservation, Cline inferred, and he has laid it down as an\r\nincontrovertible position, that the lungs should always be large; and\r\nYouatt expresses the same opinion. This is undoubtedly correct as to\r\nworking beasts, the horse and the ox, which require full and free\r\nrespiration, to enable them to sustain great muscular efforts. But later\r\nphysiologists have assumed, perhaps from closer and more accurate\r\nobservations, that the fattening propensity is in the ratio of the\r\nsmallness of the lungs. Earl Spencer has observed, that this is fully\r\nshown in the pig, the sheep, the ox, and the horse, whose aptitude to\r\nfatten and smallness of lungs, are in the order enumerated.\r\n\r\nThis position is further illustrated by the different breeds of the same\r\nclasses of animals. The Leicester sheep have smaller lungs than the\r\nSouth Down; and it has been found, that a number of the former, on a\r\ngiven quantity of food, and in the same time, reached 28 lbs. a quarter,\r\nwhile the South Downs with a greater consumption of food, attained in\r\nthe same period, only 18 lbs. The Chinese pigs have much smaller lungs\r\nthan the Irish, and the former will fatten to a given weight, on a much\r\nless quantity of food than the latter. (_Playfair._) The principle would\r\nseem to be corroborated by the fact, that animals generally fatten\r\nfaster in proportion to the quantity of food they consume, as they\r\nadvance towards a certain stage of maturity; during all which time, the\r\nsecretion of internal fat is gradually compressing the size, by reducing\r\nthe room for the action of the lungs. Hence, the advantage of carrying\r\nthe fattening beast to an advanced point, by which not only the quality\r\nof carcass is improved, but the quantity is relatively greater for the\r\namount of food consumed. These views are intimately connected, and fully\r\ncorrespond, with the principles of\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPIRATION IN ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nFrom careful experiments, it has been found that all animals daily\r\nconsume a much larger quantity of food than the aggregate of what may\r\nhave been retained in the system, added to what has been expelled in the\r\nf[oe]ces and urine, and what has escaped by perspiration. Boussingault,\r\nwho combines the characteristics of an ingenious chemist, a vigilant\r\nobserver, and a practical agriculturist, made an experiment with a\r\n\"milch-cow and a full-grown horse, which were placed in stalls so\r\ncontrived that the droppings and the urine could be collected without\r\nloss. Before being made the subjects of experiment, the animals were\r\nballasted or fed for a month with the same ration that was furnished to\r\nthem, during the three days and three nights which they passed in the\r\nexperimental stalls. During the month, the weight of the animals did not\r\nvary sensibly, a circumstance which happily enables us to assume that\r\nneither did the weight vary during the seventy-two hours when they were\r\nunder especial observation.\r\n\r\nThe cow was foddered with after-math, hay, and potatoes; the horse with\r\nthe same hay and oats. The quantities of forage were accurately weighed,\r\nand their precise degree of moistness and their composition were\r\ndetermined from average samples. The water drunk was measured, its\r\nsaline and earthy constituents having been previously ascertained. The\r\nexcrementitious matters passed, were of course collected with the\r\ngreatest care; the excrements, the urine, and the milk were weighed, and\r\nthe constitution of the whole estimated from elementary analyses of\r\naverage specimens of each. The results of the two experiments are given\r\nin the table on the next page.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen and hydrogen that are not accounted for in the sum of the\r\nproducts have not disappeared in the precise proportions requisite to\r\nform water; the excess of hydrogen amounts to as many as from 13 to 15\r\ndwts. It is probable that this hydrogen of the food became changed into\r\nwater by combining during respiration with the oxygen of the air.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD CONSUMED BY THE HORSE IN 24 HOURS.\r\n\r\n  Key

perceive a large loss of water, carbon, hydrogen, &c. Nearly all\r\nthis loss of carbon and hydrogen escaped by respiration, while most of\r\nthe water, oxygen, nitrogen, and salts, passed off in perspiration. In\r\nfurther illustration of the subject of respiration, Liebig says, \"from\r\nthe accurate determination of the quantity of carbon daily taken into\r\nthe system in the food, as well as of that proportion of it which passes\r\nout of the body in the f[oe]ces and urine, _unburned_, that is, in some\r\nform uncombined with oxygen, it appears that an adult taking moderate\r\nexercise, consumes 13.9 oz. of carbon daily.\" The foregoing are facts in\r\nthe animal economy, capable of vast practical bearing in the management\r\nof our domestic animals. But before following out these principles to\r\ntheir application, let us briefly examine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Effects of Respiration.\r\n\r\nWe have seen from the experiment of Boussingault, that there is a loss\r\nof 6 lbs. 6 oz. of carbon, and 8 oz. 3 dwt. of hydrogen in the food of\r\nthe horse, and something less in that of the cow, every 24 hours, which\r\nhas not been left in the system, nor has it escaped by the evacuations.\r\nWhat has become of so large an amount of solid matter? It has escaped\r\nthrough the lungs and been converted into air. The carbon and hydrogen\r\nof the food have undergone those various transformations which are\r\npeculiar to the animal economy, digestion, assimilation, &c., which it\r\nis not necessary, nor will our limits permit us here to explain; and\r\nthey appear at last in the veinous blood, which in the course of its\r\ncirculation is brought into the cells of the lungs. The air inhaled is\r\nsent through every part of their innumerable meshes, and is there\r\nseparated from the blood, only by the delicate tissues or membranes\r\nwhich enclose it. A portion of the carbon and hydrogen escapes from the\r\nblood into the air-cells, and at the instant of their contact with the\r\nair, they affect a chemical union with its oxygen, forming carbonic acid\r\nand the vapor of water, which is then expired, and a fresh supply of\r\noxygen is inhaled. This operation is again repeated, through every\r\nsuccessive moment of animal existence.\r\n\r\nBesides other purposes which it is probably designed to subserve, but\r\nwhich have hitherto eluded the keenest research of chemical physiology,\r\none obvious result of respiration is, the elevation of the temperature\r\nof the animal system. By the ever-operating laws of nature, this\r\nchemical union of two bodies in the formation of a third, disengages\r\nlatent heat, which taking place in contact with the blood, is by it\r\ndiffused throughout the whole frame. The effect is precisely analogous\r\nto the combustion of fuel, oils, &c., in the open air.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerspiration\r\n\r\nIs the counteracting agent which modifies this result, and prevents the\r\ninjurious effects, which, under exposure to great external heat, would\r\nensure certain destruction. And this too, it will have been seen, is\r\nprovided at the expense of the animal food. When from excessive heat,\r\ncaused by violent exercise or otherwise, by which respiration is\r\naccelerated and the animal temperature becomes elevated, the papillae of\r\nthe skin pour the limpid fluid through their innumerable ducts, which in\r\nits conversion into vapor, seize upon the animal heat and remove it from\r\nthe system, producing that delicious coolness so grateful to the\r\nlaboring man and beast in a sultry summer's day. These two opposing\r\nprinciples, like the antagonistic operations of the regulator in\r\nmechanics, keep up a perfect balance in the vital machine, and enable\r\nthat entire division of the animal creation, distinguished as\r\nwarm-blooded, including man and the brute, all the feathered tribes, the\r\nwhale, the seal, the walrus, &c., to maintain an equilibrium of\r\ntemperature, whether under the equator or the poles; on the peaks of\r\nChimborazo, the burning sands of Zahara, or plunged in the depths of the\r\nArctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the size of the lungs, and the aptitude of\r\nanimals to fatten, will be more apparent from the fact, that the carbon\r\nand hydrogen which are abstracted, constitute two of the only three\r\nelements of fat. The larger size, the fuller play, and the greater\r\nactivity of the lungs, by exhausting more of the materials of fat, must\r\nnecessarily diminish its formation in the animal system; unless it can\r\nbe shown, which has never yet been done, that the removal of a portion\r\nof the fat-forming principles accelerates the assimilation of the\r\nremainder.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Food which supplies Respiration.\r\n\r\nThis, in the herbivorous animals, after they are deprived of the milk,\r\nwhich furnishes it in abundance, is the starch, gum, sugar, vegetable\r\nfats, and oils that exist in the vegetables, grain, and roots which they\r\nconsume; and in certain cases where there is a deficiency of other\r\nfood, it is sparingly furnished in woody and cellular fibre. All these\r\nsubstances constitute the principal part of dry vegetable food, and are\r\nmade up of three elements, _which in starch, gum, cane-sugar, and\r\ncellular fibre, exist in precisely the same proportions_, viz: 44 per\r\ncent. of carbon, 6.2 of hydrogen, and 40.8 of oxygen.\r\n\r\nGrape sugar, woody fibre, and vegetable and animal fats and oils are\r\nmade up of the same elements, but in different proportions, the last\r\ncontaining much more carbon and hydrogen than those above specified. In\r\nthe fattening animals, it is supposed the vegetable fats and oils are\r\nimmediately transferred to the fat cells, undergoing only such slight\r\nmodification as perfectly adapts them to the animal economy, while\r\nrespiration is supplied by the other enumerated vegetable matters. If\r\nthese last are taken into the stomach beyond the necessary demand for\r\nits object, they too are converted by the animal functions into fat, and\r\nare stored up in the system for future use. But if the supply of the\r\nlatter is insufficient for respiration, it first appropriates the\r\nvegetable fat contained in the food; if this is deficient, it draws on\r\nthe accumulated stores of animal fat already secreted in the system, and\r\nwhen these too are exhausted, it seizes upon what is contained in the\r\ntissues and muscle. When the animal commences drawing upon its own\r\nresources for the support of its vital functions, deterioration begins;\r\nand if long continued, great emaciation succeeds, which is soon followed\r\nby starvation and death.\r\n\r\nThe carnivorous animals are furnished with their respiratory excretions,\r\nfrom the animal fat and fibre which exist in their food, and which the\r\nherbivorae had previously abstracted from the vegetable creation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumstances which augment Respiration.\r\n\r\nThese are, exercise, cold, and an abundant supply of food. Exercise,\r\nbesides exhausting the materials of fat, produces a waste of fibre and\r\ntissue, the muscular and nitrogenized parts of the animal system; and it\r\nis obvious from the foregoing principles, that cold requires a\r\ncorresponding demand for carbon and hydrogen to keep up the vital\r\nwarmth. The consumption of food to the fullest extent required for\r\ninvigorating the frame, creates a desire for activity, and it insensibly\r\ninduces full respiration. The well-fed, active man, unconsciously draws\r\na full, strong breath; while the abstemious and the feeble, unwittingly\r\nuse it daintily, as if it were a choice commodity not to be lavishly\r\nexpended. If the first be observed when sleep has effectually arrested\r\nvolition, the expanded chest will be seen, heaving with the long-drawn,\r\nsonorous breath; while that of the latter will exhibit the gentle repose\r\nof the infant on its mother's breast.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the food of the inhabitants of the polar and\r\nequatorial regions, is strikingly illustrative of the demands both for\r\nbreathing and perspiration. The latter are almost destitute of clothing,\r\nand subsist on their light, juicy, tropical fruits, which contain\r\nscarcely 12 per cent. of carbon, yet furnish all the elements for\r\nabundant perspiration; while the former are imbedded in furs, and devour\r\ngallons of train oil or its equivalent of fat, which contains nearly 80\r\nper cent. of carbon, that is burnt up in respiration to maintain a\r\nnecessary warmth.\r\n\r\nThe bear retires to his den in the beginning of winter, loaded with fat,\r\nwhich he has accumulated from the rich, oily mast abounding in the woods\r\nin autumn. There he lies for months, snugly coiled and perfectly\r\ndormant; the thickness of his shaggy coat, his dry bed of leaves, and\r\nwell-protected den, effectually guarding him from cold, which in\r\naddition to his want of exercise, draw slightly upon respiration to keep\r\nup the vital heat. When the stores of carbon and hydrogen contained in\r\nthe fat are expended, his hunger and cold compel him to leave his\r\nwinter-quarters, again to wander in pursuit of food.\r\n\r\nMany of the swallow tribes, in like manner, hybernate in large hollow\r\ntrees, and for months eke out a torpid, scarcely perceptible existence,\r\nindependent of food. Activity and full respiration, on the return of\r\nspring, demand a support, which is furnished in the myriads of flies\r\nthey daily consume. The toad and frog have repeatedly been found in a\r\ntorpid state, imbedded in limestones, sandstones, and the breccias,\r\nwhere they were probably imprisoned for thousands of years without a\r\nmorsel of food; yet when exposed to the warmth of the vital air and the\r\nstimulus of its oxygen, they have manifested all the activity of their\r\nspecies. This they are enabled to sustain only by an enormous\r\nconsumption of insects.\r\n\r\nDr. Playfair states, that in an experiment made by Lord Ducie, 100 sheep\r\nwere placed in a shed, and ate 20 pounds of Swedes turnips each per day;\r\nanother 100 were placed in the open air, and ate 25 pounds per day; yet\r\nthe former, which had one-fifth less food, weighed, after a few weeks,\r\nthree pounds more per head than the latter. He then fed five sheep in\r\nthe open air, between the 21st November and 1st December. They consumed\r\n90 pounds of food per day, the temperature being at 44 deg., and at the end\r\nof this time, they weighed two pounds less than when first exposed. Five\r\nsheep were then placed under a shed, and allowed to run about in a\r\ntemperature of 49 deg.. At first they consumed 82 pounds per day; then 70\r\npounds, and at the end of the time they had gained 23 pounds. Again,\r\nfive sheep were placed under a shed as before, and not allowed to take\r\nany exercise. They ate at first, 64 pounds of food per day, then 58\r\npounds, and increased in weight 30 pounds. Lastly, five sheep were kept\r\nquiet and covered, and in the dark. They ate 35 pounds per day, and\r\nincreased eight pounds.\r\n\r\nMr. Childers states, that 80 Leicester sheep in the open field, consumed\r\n50 baskets of cut turnips per day, besides oil-cake. On putting them in\r\na shed, they were immediately able to consume only 30 baskets, and soon\r\nafter but 25, being only half the quantity required before, and yet they\r\nfattened as rapidly as when eating the largest quantity. The minimum of\r\nfood, then, required for the support of animals, is attained when\r\nclosely confined in a warm, dark shelter; and the maximum, when running\r\nat large, exposed to all weathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEEDING OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThis should be regulated by a variety of considerations. The young which\r\nmay be destined for maturity, should be supplied with milk from the dam\r\nuntil weaning-time. No food can be substituted for the well-filled udder\r\nof the parent, which is so safe, healthful, and nutritious. If from any\r\ncause there is deficiency or total privation, it must be made up by that\r\nkind of food, meal-gruel, &c., which, in its composition, approaches\r\nnearest in quality to the milk. At a more advanced age, or the time for\r\nweaning, grass, hay, roots, or grain, may be substituted, in quantities\r\nsufficient to maintain a steady but _not a forced growth_. Stuffing can\r\nonly be tolerated in animals which are speedily destined for the\r\nslaughter. Alternately improving and falling back, is injurious to all\r\nstock. _An animal should never be fat but once._ Especially is high\r\nfeeding bad for breeding animals. Much as starving is to be deprecated,\r\nthe prejudicial effects of repletion are still greater. The calf or lamb\r\nintended for the butcher, may be pushed forward with all possible\r\nrapidity. Horses or colts should never exceed a good working or breeding\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurposes fulfilled by different Kinds of Food.\r\n\r\nThe objects designed to be answered by food, are to a certain extent the\r\nsame. All food is intended to meet the demands of respiration and\r\nnutrition, and fattening to a greater or less degree. But some are\r\nbetter suited to one object than others, and it is for the intelligent\r\nfarmer to select such as will most effectually accomplish his particular\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe very young animal requires large quantities of the phosphate of lime\r\nfor the formation of bone; and this is yielded in the milk in larger\r\nproportions than from any other food. The growing animal wants bone,\r\nmuscle, and a certain amount of fat, and these are procured from the\r\ngrasses, roots, and grain; from the former when fed alone, and from the\r\ntwo latter when mixed with hay or grass.\r\n\r\nHorses, cattle, and sheep need hay to qualify the too watery nature of\r\nthe roots, and the too condensed nutritiveness of the grain. Animals\r\nthat are preparing for the shambles, require vegetable oils or fat,\r\nstarch, sugar, or gum. The first is contained in great abundance in flax\r\nand cotton-seed, the sun-flower, and many other of the mucilaginous\r\nseeds. Indian corn is the most fattening grain. The potato contains the\r\ngreatest proportion of starch, and the sugar-beet has large quantities\r\nof sugar, and both consequently are good for stall-feeding. The ripe\r\nsugar-cane is perhaps the most fattening of vegetables, if we except the\r\noily seeds and grain. The Swedes turnip is a good food to commence with\r\nfattening cattle and sheep; but where great ripeness in animals is\r\ndesired, they should be followed with beets, carrots or potatoes, and\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThe table of the average composition of the different crops, which we\r\nsubjoin from Johnston, shows the comparative qualities of various kinds\r\nof food, and it will be found a valuable reference for their nutritive\r\nand fattening qualities. He says, \"In drawing up this table, I have\r\nadopted the proportions of gluten, for the most part, from Boussingault.\r\nSome of them, however, appear to be very doubtful. The proportions of\r\nfatty matter are also very uncertain. With a few exceptions, those above\r\ngiven have been taken from Sprengel, and they are, in general, stated\r\nconsiderably too low. It is an interesting fact, that the proportion of\r\nfatty matter in and immediately under the husk of the grains of corn, is\r\ngenerally much greater than in the substance of the corn itself. Thus I\r\nhave found the pollard of wheat to yield more than twice as much oil as\r\nthe fine flour obtained from the same sample of grain. The four\r\nportions separated by the miller from a superior sample of wheat grown\r\nin the neighborhood of Durham, gave of oil respectively: fine flour, 1.5\r\nper cent.; pollard, 2.4; boxings, 3.6; and bran, 3.3 per cent. Dumas\r\nstates that the husk of oats sometimes yields as much as five or six per\r\ncent. of oil.\" The columns under starch, &c., and fatty matter, denote\r\nthe value for respiration or sustaining life, and the fattening\r\nqualities; that under gluten, the capacity for yielding muscle and\r\nsupporting labor; and saline matter indicates something of the\r\nproportions which are capable of being converted into bones.\r\n\r\n                Water.

An absolute,\r\nunchanging value can never be assumed of any one substance, as the\r\nquality of each must differ with the particular variety, the soil upon\r\nwhich it is grown, the character of the season, the manner of curing,\r\nand other circumstances. An approximate relative value is all that can\r\nbe expected, and this we may hope ere long to obtain, from the spirit of\r\nanalytical research, which is now developed and in successful progress.\r\nMore especially do we need these investigations with _American\r\nproducts_, some of which are but partially cultivated in Europe, whence\r\nwe derive most of our analyses. And many which are there reared, differ\r\nwidely from those produced here, as these also differ from each other.\r\nWhat, for instance, is the character of _meadow hay_? We know that this\r\nvaries as four to one, according to the particular kinds grown; and our\r\nIndian corn has certainly a less range than from five to nine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Changes in the Food of Animals.\r\n\r\nPotatoes, when first ripe, are estimated to be worth, for feeding\r\npurposes, nearly twice as much as when old; and the relative value of\r\nthe different kinds, varies greatly at the same age and under similar\r\nconditions of growth. Perrault ascertained by careful experiment, that\r\nhay, clover, and lucerne lost much of their nutritive qualities by\r\ndrying, and in lucerne this loss amounted to about thirty-five per cent.\r\nThis is an important consideration in the feeding of green and dry\r\nforage. Oats are among the best feed, both for young and working\r\nanimals; but it has been found that they are greatly improved for the\r\nlatter, and perhaps for both, by allowing the new crop to remain till\r\nthe latter part of winter, before feeding.\r\n\r\nThe improvement by steaming and cooking food, is seldom sufficiently\r\nappreciated. Food properly managed, can never be made worse by cooking\r\nfor any stock; although it has not been considered so essential for\r\nworking, and generally, for ruminating animals, as for swine, and such\r\nas were stall-feeding. But the alteration produced in cooking, by\r\nfitting it for a more ready assimilation, must, as a general rule, add\r\nmuch to the value of the food, and the rapid improvement of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe effect of slight fermentation, or souring the food, produces the\r\nsame result. Animals accustomed to this acid food, will reject what is\r\nunprepared when they can get at the former; and we have no doubt, from\r\nour own experience, that there is a saving in thus preparing it, from 20\r\nto 40 per cent. A mixture of food should be supplied to all animals.\r\nLike man, they tire of any constant aliment. For such, especially, as\r\nare fattening, and which it is desirable to mature with the greatest\r\nrapidity, a careful indulgence of their appetite should be studied. They\r\nshould be provided with whatever they most crave, if it be adapted to\r\nthe secretion of fat. Cutting, crushing, and grinding the food; cooking,\r\nsouring, and mixing it, are each by themselves an improvement for\r\nfeeding; and frequently two or more of these preparations combined, are\r\nof great utility in effecting the object proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Profit of Feeding.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, that this consists in a valuable return from the animal\r\nof the food consumed. In the horse, this can only be received in labor\r\nor breeding; in the ox, from labor and flesh; in the cow, from the milk,\r\nthe flesh, and her young. In the sheep, it may be returned in its\r\nfleece, its carcass, or its progeny; and in the swine only by its\r\nprogeny and flesh. The manure we expect from all; and if this be not\r\nsecured and judiciously used, few animals about the farm will be found\r\nto yield a satisfactory profit for their food and attention; though it\r\nis evident, it should form but a small part of the return looked for.\r\n\r\nAnimals are only profitable to the farmer, when they yield a daily\r\nincome, as in their milk or labor; or annually, by their young or\r\nfleece; unless it be in a course of regular improvement, either in their\r\nordinary growth or preparation for the butcher. The animal must consume\r\na certain amount of food merely to keep up its stationary condition, and\r\nto supply the materials for waste, respiration, perspiration, and the\r\nevacuations. These must first be provided for in all cases, before the\r\nfarmer can expect any thing for the food.\r\n\r\nFrequent observation has shown, that an ox will consume about two per\r\ncent, of his weight of hay per day, to maintain his condition. If put to\r\nmoderate labor, an increase of this quantity to three per cent., will\r\nenable him to perform his work, and still maintain his flesh. If to be\r\nfattened, he requires about 41/2 per cent. of his weight daily, in\r\nnutritious food. A cow to remain stationary and give no milk, eats two\r\nper cent. of her weight daily; and if in milk, she will consume three\r\nper cent. If these statements are correct, which it is certain they are\r\nin principle, though they may not be entirely in degree, it will require\r\nthe same food to keep three yoke of cattle in idleness, as two at work;\r\nand the food of every two that are idle, will nearly support one under\r\nthe most rapid condition of fatting. Two cows may be kept in milk, with\r\nthe same feed that will keep three without.\r\n\r\nNo practice is more impolitic, than barely to sustain the stock through\r\nthe winter, or a part of the year, as is the case in too many instances,\r\nand allow them to improve only when turned on grass in summer. Besides\r\nsubjecting them to the risk of disease, consequent upon their privation\r\nof food, nearly half the year is lost in their use, or in maturing them\r\nfor profitable disposal; when if one-third of the stock had been sold,\r\nthe remainder would have been kept in a rapidly improving condition, and\r\nat three years of age, they would probably be of equal value, as\r\notherwise at five or six. It is true that breed has much to do with this\r\nrapid advancement, but breed is useless without food to develop and\r\nmature it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nNEAT OR HORNED CATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe value of our neat cattle exceeds that of any other of the domestic\r\nanimals in the United States. They are as widely disseminated, and more\r\ngenerally useful. Like sheep and all our domestic brutes, they have been\r\nso long and so entirely subject to the control of man, that their\r\noriginal type is unknown. They have been allowed entire freedom from all\r\nhuman direction or restraint for hundreds of years, on the boundless\r\npampas of South America, California, and elsewhere; but when permitted\r\nto resume that natural condition, by which both plants and animals\r\napproximate to the character of their original head, they have scarcely\r\ndeviated in any respect, from the domestic herds from which they are\r\ndescended. From this it may be inferred, that our present races do not\r\ndiffer, in any of their essential features and characteristics, from the\r\noriginal stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious Domestic Breeds.\r\n\r\nCultivation, feed, and climate, have much to do in determining the form,\r\nsize, and character of cattle. In Lithuania, cattle attain an immense\r\nsize, with but moderate pretensions to general excellence, while the\r\nIrish Kerry and Scotch Grampian cows but little exceed the largest\r\nsheep; yet the last are compact and well-made, and yield a good return\r\nfor the food consumed. Every country, and almost every district, has its\r\npeculiar breeds, which by long association have become adapted to the\r\nfood and circumstances of its position, and when found profitable, they\r\nshould be exchanged for others, only after the most thorough trial of\r\nsuperior fitness for the particular location, in those proposed to be\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nMore attention has been paid to the improvement of the various breeds of\r\ncattle in England, than in any other country; and it is there they have\r\nattained the greatest perfection in form and character for the various\r\npurposes to which they are devoted. We have derived, directly from Great\r\nBritain, not only the parent stock from which nearly all our cattle are\r\ndescended, but also most of those fresh importations, to which we have\r\nlooked for improvement on the present race of animals.\r\n\r\nA few choice Dutch cattle, generally black and white, and of large size,\r\ngood forms, and good milkers, with a decided tendency to fatten, have\r\nbeen occasionally introduced among us, but not in numbers sufficient to\r\nkeep up a distinct breed; and in the hands of their importers, or\r\nimmediate successors, their peculiar characteristics have soon become\r\nmerged in those herds by which they were surrounded. Some few French and\r\nSpanish cattle, the descendants of those remote importations, made when\r\nthe colonies of those kingdoms held possession of our northern, western,\r\nand southern frontiers, still exist in those sections; and although\r\npossessing no claims to particular superiority, at least in any that\r\nhave come within our notice, yet they are so well acclimated, and\r\nadapted to their various localities, as to render it inexpedient to\r\nattempt supplanting them, except with such as are particularly\r\nmeritorious.\r\n\r\n\r\nNative Cattle.\r\n\r\nThis is a favorite term with Americans, and comprehends every thing in\r\nthe country, excepting such as are of a pure and distinct breed. It\r\nembraces some of the best, some of the worst, and some of almost every\r\nvariety, shape, color, and character of the bovine race. The designation\r\nhas no farther meaning, than that they are indigenous to the soil, and\r\ndo not belong to any well-defined or distinct variety.\r\n\r\nThe best native cattle of the Union are undoubtedly to be found in the\r\nNortheastern states. Most of the early emigrant cattle in that section\r\nwere from the southern part of England, where the Devon cattle abound;\r\nand though not at the present time bearing a close resemblance to that\r\nbreed, unless it has been impressed upon them by more recent\r\nimportations, yet a large number have that general approximation in\r\ncharacter, features, and color, which entitles them to claim a near\r\nkindred with one of the choicest cultivated breeds. They have the same\r\nsymmetry, but not in general the excessive delicacy of form, which\r\ncharacterizes the Devons; the same intelligence, activity, and vigor in\r\nthe working cattle, and the same tendency to fattening; but they are\r\nusually better for the dairy than their imported ancestors. Some\r\nvaluable intermixtures have occasionally been made among them. Among\r\nthese, there have been many brindled cattle widely disseminated, of\r\ngreat merit as workers, and not often surpassed for the dairy and\r\nshambles.\r\n\r\nThe Herefords have in a few instances been introduced among the eastern\r\ncattle, and apparently with great improvement. The importation made by\r\nAdmiral Coffin, of four choice Hereford bulls and cows, which were\r\npresented to the State Agricultural Society of Massachusetts, nearly\r\nthirty years since, is especially to be mentioned, as resulting in\r\ndecided benefit wherever they were disseminated. Some of the old\r\nYorkshire, or as they are sometimes styled, the long-horned Durhams,\r\nhave been introduced, though these have been isolated individuals and\r\nnever perpetuated as a separate breed. A few small importations have\r\nbeen made of the Short Horns and Ayrshires, but neither of these have\r\nbeen bred in the New England states in distinct herds, to any extent.\r\n\r\nTheir _native breed_ has hitherto, and generally with good reason,\r\npossessed claims on the attention of their owners, which, with some\r\nslight exceptions, it has not been in the power of any rivals to\r\nsupplant. With entire adaptedness to the soil, climate, and wants of the\r\nfarmer, an originally good stock has, in frequent instances, been\r\ncarefully fostered, and the breeding animals selected with a strict\r\nreference to their fitness for perpetuating the most desirable\r\nqualities. As a consequence of this intelligent and persevering policy,\r\nwidely, but not universally pursued, they have a race of cattle, though\r\npossessing considerable diversity of size and color, yet coinciding in a\r\nremarkable degree in the possession of those utilitarian features, which\r\nso justly commend them to our admiration.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding southwestwardly through New York, New Jersey, and\r\nelsewhere, we shall find in this branch of stock, a greater diversity\r\nand less uniform excellence; though they have extensive numbers of\r\nvaluable animals. Here and there will be found a choice collection of\r\nsome favorite foreign breed, which emigrants have brought from their\r\nnative home, as did the Pagan colonists their penates or household gods;\r\nthe cherished associates of early days, and the only relics of their\r\nfather-land. Such are an occasional small herd of polled or hornless\r\ncattle, originally derived from Suffolk or Galloway, excellent both for\r\nthe dairy and shambles; the Kyloe, or West Highland, (Scottish,) a hardy\r\nanimal, unrivalled for beef; the Welsh runt; the Irish cattle; the\r\ncrumpled-horn Alderney, and some others.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Devon\r\n\r\nIs among the oldest distinctly cultivated breeds in this country, as it\r\nundoubtedly is of England, and probably it is the most universal\r\nfavorite. This popularity is well deserved, and it is based upon several\r\nsubstantial considerations. They are beautifully formed, possessing\r\nexcessive fineness and symmetry of frame, yet with sufficient bone and\r\nmuscle to render them perfectly hardy; and they are among the most\r\nvigorous and active of working cattle. They have great uniformity of\r\nappearance in every feature, size, shape, horns, and color. The cows and\r\nbulls appear small, but the ox is much larger; and both he and the dam,\r\non cutting up, are found to weigh much beyond the estimates which an eye\r\naccustomed only to ordinary breeds, would have assigned to them. The\r\nflesh is finely marbled or interspersed with alternate fat and lean, and\r\nis of superior quality and flavor.\r\n\r\nThe cows invariably yield milk of great richness, and when appropriately\r\nbred, none surpass them for the quantity of butter and cheese it yields.\r\nMr. Bloomfield, the manager of the late Lord Leicester's estate at\r\nHolkham, has, by careful attention, somewhat increased the size, without\r\nimpairing the beauty of their form, and so successful has he been in\r\ndeveloping their milking properties, that his average product of butter\r\nfrom each cow, is 4 lbs. per week for the whole year. He has challenged\r\nEngland to milk an equal number of cows of any breed, against 40 pure\r\nDevons, to be selected out of his own herd, without as yet having found\r\na competitor. Although this is not a test of their merits, and by no\r\nmeans decides their superiority, yet it shows the great confidence\r\nreposed in them by their owner. The Devon ox, under six years old, has\r\ncome up to a nett dead weight of 1,593 lbs.; and at three years and\r\nseven months, to 1,316 lbs., with 160 lbs. of rough tallow.\r\n\r\n_Description._ The Devon is of medium size, and so symmetrical, as to\r\nappear small. The color is invariably a deep mahogany red, with usually\r\na white udder and strip under the belly; and the tuft at the end of the\r\ntail is red while they are calves, but white in the older animal. The\r\nhead is small, broad in the forehead, and somewhat indented. The muzzle\r\nis delicate, and both the nose and the rings around the eye, in the pure\r\nbreed, are invariably of a bright, clear orange. The cheeks and face are\r\nthin and fleshless; the horns clear, smooth, and of a yellowish white,\r\nhandsomely curved upward. The neck is small and delicate at its junction\r\nwith the head, but is well expanded in its attachment to the breast and\r\nshoulders. The last has the true slant for activity and strength, in\r\nwhich it excels all other breeds of equal weight. The barrel is round\r\nand deep, with a projecting brisket. The back is broad and level; the\r\nflank full; hips wide; the rumps long; the quarters well developed, and\r\ncapable of holding a great quantity of the most valuable meat. The tail\r\nis on a level with the back, and gracefully tapers like a drum-stick, to\r\nthe tuft on the end. The legs are of peculiar delicacy and fineness, yet\r\npossess great strength. The skin is of medium thickness, of a rich\r\norange hue, pliable to the touch, and covered with a thick coating of\r\nfine, soft, curly hair. The Devon is intelligent, gentle, and tractable;\r\nis good for milk, and unsurpassed for the yoke and for fattening. No\r\nanimal is better suited to our scanty or luxuriant hill pastures than\r\nthe Devon, and none make a better return for the attention and food\r\nreceived. They ensure a rapid improvement when mixed with other cattle,\r\nimparting their color and characteristics in an eminent degree. Several\r\nimportations have been made into this country within the last 30 years,\r\nof the choicest animals, and though not yet numerous in the United\r\nStates, we possess some of the best specimens that exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Short Horns, or Durhams.\r\n\r\nAre decidedly the most showy among the cattle species. They are of all\r\ncolors between a full, deep red, and a pure creamy white; but generally\r\nhave both intermixed in larger or smaller patches, or intimately blended\r\nin a beautiful roan. Black, brown, or brindled, are colors not\r\nrecognised among pure-bred Short Horns. Their form is well-spread,\r\nsymmetrical, and imposing, and capable of sustaining a large weight of\r\nvaluable carcass. The horn was originally branching and turned upward,\r\nbut now frequently has a downward tendency, with the tips pointing\r\ntowards each other. They are light, and comparatively short; clear,\r\nhighly polished, and waxy. The head is finely formed, with a longer\r\nface but not so fine a muzzle as the Devon. The neck is delicately\r\nformed without dewlap, the brisket projecting; and the great depth and\r\nwidth of the chest giving short, well-spread fore-legs. The crops are\r\ngood; back and loin broad and flat; ribs projecting; deep flank and\r\ntwist; tail well set up, strong at the roots and tapering. They have a\r\nthick covering of soft hair, and are mellow to the touch, technically\r\ntermed, _handling well_. They mature early and rapidly for the quantity\r\nof food consumed, yielding largely of good beef with little offal. As a\r\nbreed, they are excellent milkers; though some families of the Short\r\nHorns surpass others in this quality. They are inferior to the Devons,\r\nin their value as working oxen, and in the richness of their milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Short-Horn Bull.]\r\n\r\nThe Short Horns are assigned a high antiquity, by the oldest breeders in\r\nthe counties of Durham and Yorkshire, England, the place of their\r\norigin, and for a long time, of their almost exclusive breeding. From\r\nthe marked and decided improvement which they stamp upon other animals,\r\nthey are evidently an ancient breed, though much the juniors of the\r\nDevon and Hereford. Their highly artificial style, form, and character,\r\nare unquestionably the work of deeply studied and long-continued art;\r\nand to the same degree that they have been moulded in unresisting\r\ncompliance with the dictation of their intelligent breeders, have they\r\ndeparted from that light and more agile form of the Devon, which\r\nconclusively and beyond the possibility of contradiction, marks the more\r\nprimitive race.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPORTATION OF SHORT HORNS INTO THIS COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nThis is claimed to have been previous to 1783. They are the reputed\r\nancestors of many choice animals existing in Virginia, in the latter\r\npart of the last century, and which were known as the _milk breed_; and\r\nsome of these, with others termed the _beef breed_, were taken into\r\nKentucky by Mr. Patton, as early as 1797, and their descendants, a\r\nvaluable race of animals, were much disseminated in the West, and known\r\nas the _Patton stock_.\r\n\r\nThe first authentic importations we have recorded, are those of Mr.\r\nHeaton, into Westchester, N. Y., in 1791 and '96, from the valuable\r\nherds of Messrs. Culley and Colling, which consisted of several choice\r\nbulls and cows. These were for many years bred pure, and their progeny\r\nwas widely scattered. (_American Herd Book._) They were also imparted\r\ninto New York, by Mr. Cox, in 1816; by Mr. Bullock, in 1822; by the late\r\nHon. S. Van Rensselaer in 1823; and immediately after, by Mr. Charles\r\nHenry Hall, of Harlem. Some small importations were made into\r\nMassachusetts between 1817 and '25, by several enterprising\r\nagriculturists, Messrs. Coolidge, Williams, and others; into Connecticut\r\nby Mr. Hall and others; into Pennsylvania by Mr. Powell; and into Ohio\r\nand some other states, by various individuals early in the present\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nShort-Horned Cow.]\r\n\r\nSince the first importations, larger accessions from the best English\r\nherds have been frequently made; and with the nice regard for pedigrees\r\nwhich the introduction of the herd book, and careful purity in breeding\r\nhas produced, the Short Horns have become the most extensive pure-bred\r\nfamily of cattle in the United States.\r\n\r\nDuring the speculative times of 1835 to 1840, they brought high prices,\r\nfrequently from $500 to $1000, and sometimes more. The following years\r\nof financial embarrassment, reduced their market price below their\r\nintrinsic value; but the tide is again turning, and they are now in\r\ndemand, but still at prices far below their utility and merits. They\r\nhave from the first, been favorites in the rich, corn valleys of the\r\nWest, their early maturity and great weight giving them a preference\r\nover any other breed. The only drawback to this partiality, is their\r\ninability, from their form and weight, to reach remote eastern markets\r\nin good condition; an objection now in a great measure remedied, by the\r\nrecent remission of duties on foreign beef in the English market, which\r\nmakes them of nearly equal value where fed, to pack for exportation. On\r\nlight lands and scanty pastures, they will probably never be largely\r\nintroduced. All heavy animals require full forage within a limited\r\ncompass, so as to fill their stomachs at once, and quietly compose\r\nthemselves to their digestion.\r\n\r\nThe weights reached by the Short Horns in England, as given by Mr.\r\nBerry, have been enormous. Two oxen, six years old, weighed nett, 1820\r\nlbs. each. A heifer of three years, and fed on grass and hay alone,\r\nweighed 1260 lbs. A four-year-old steer, fed on hay and turnips only,\r\ndressed 1890 lbs. A cow reached the prodigious weight of 1778 lbs. A\r\nheifer, running with her dam, and on pasture alone, weighed at seven\r\nmonths, 476 lbs. An ox, seven years old, weighed 2362 lbs. From their\r\ncomparatively small numbers in this country, most of them have been\r\nretained for breeders; few, as yet, have been fattened, and such only as\r\nwere decidedly inferior. Such animals as have been extensively produced\r\nby crossing this breed upon our former stocks, have given evidence of\r\ngreat and decided improvement; and the Short Horns, and their grade\r\ndescendants are destined, at no distant day, to occupy a large portion\r\nof the richest feeding grounds in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nHereford Cow]\r\n\r\n\r\nHerefords.\r\n\r\nThis is the only remaining pure breed, which has hitherto occupied the\r\nattention of graziers in this country. Like the Devons, they are\r\nsupposed to be one of the most ancient races of British cattle. Marshall\r\ngives the following description. \"The countenance pleasant, cheerful,\r\nopen; the forehead broad; eye full and lively; horns bright, taper, and\r\nspreading; head small; chap lean; neck long and tapering; chest deep;\r\nbosom broad, and projecting forward; shoulder-bone thin, flat, no way\r\nprotuberant in bone (?) but full and mellow in flesh; chest full; loin\r\nbroad; hips standing wide, and level with the chine; quarters long, and\r\nwide at the neck; rump even with the level of the back, and not\r\ndrooping, nor standing high and sharp above the quarters; tail slender\r\nand neatly haired; barrel round and roomy; the carcass throughout deep\r\nand well spread; ribs broad, standing flat and close on the outer\r\nsurface, forming a smooth, even barrel, the hindmost large and full of\r\nlength; round-bone small, snug, and not prominent; thigh clean, and\r\nregularly tapering; legs upright and short; bone below the knee and hock\r\nsmall; feet of middle size; flank large: flesh everywhere mellow,\r\nsoft, and yielding pleasantly to the touch, especially on the chine, the\r\nshoulder, and the ribs; hide mellow, supple, of a middle thickness, and\r\nloose on the neck and huckle; coat neatly haired, bright and silky;\r\ncolor, a middle red, with a bald face characteristic of the true\r\nHerefordshire breed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nHereford Bull.]\r\n\r\nYouatt further describes them as follows: \"They are usually of a darker\r\nred; some of them are brown, and even yellow, and a few are brindled;\r\nbut they are principally distinguished by their white faces, throats,\r\nand bellies. In a few the white extends to the shoulders. The old\r\nHerefords were brown or red-brown, with not a spot of white about them.\r\nIt is only within the last fifty or sixty years that it has been the\r\nfashion to breed for white faces. Whatever may be thought of the change\r\nof color, the present breed is certainly far superior to the old one.\r\nThe hide is considerably thicker than that of the Devon, and the beasts\r\nare more hardy. Compared with the Devons, they are shorter in the leg,\r\nand also in the carcass; higher, and broader, and heavier in the chine;\r\nrounder and wider across the hips, and better covered with fat; the\r\nthigh fuller and more muscular, and the shoulders larger and coarser.\r\n\r\nThey are not now much used for husbandry, although their form adapts\r\nthem for the heavier work; and they have all the honesty and docility of\r\nthe Devon ox, and greater strength, if not his activity. The\r\nHerefordshire ox fattens speedily at a very early age, and it is\r\ntherefore more advantageous to the farmer, and perhaps to the country,\r\nthat he should go to market at three years old, than be kept longer as a\r\nbeast of draught.\r\n\r\nThey are not as good milkers as the Devons. This is so generally\r\nacknowledged, that while there are many dairies of Devon cows in various\r\nparts of the country, a dairy of Herefords is rarely to be found. To\r\ncompensate for this, they are even more kindly feeders than the Devons.\r\nTheir beef may be objected to by some as being occasionally a little too\r\nlarge in the bone, and the fore-quarters being coarse and heavy; but the\r\nmeat of the best pieces is often very fine-grained and beautifully\r\nmarbled. There are few cattle more prized in the market than the genuine\r\nHerefords.\"\r\n\r\nThere have been several importations of the Herefords into the United\r\nStates, which by crossing with our native cattle, have done great good;\r\nbut with the exception of a few fine animals at the South, we are not\r\naware of their being kept in a state of purity, till the importation of\r\nthe splendid herd. within the last six years, by Messrs. Corning and\r\nSotham of Albany, N. Y. These Herefords are among the very best which\r\nEngland can produce, and come up fully to the description of the\r\nchoicest of the breed. Mr. Sotham, after an experience of several years,\r\nis satisfied with the cows for the dairy; and he has given very\r\nfavorable published statements of the results of their milking\r\nqualities, from which it may be properly inferred, that Youatt drew his\r\nestimates from some herds which were quite indifferent in this property.\r\nThey are peculiarly the grazier's animal, as they improve rapidly and\r\nmature early on medium feed. They are excelled for the yoke, if at all,\r\nonly by the Devons, which, in some features, they strongly resemble.\r\nBoth are probably divergent branches of the same original stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ayrshire\r\n\r\nIs a breed that has been much sought after of late years, from their\r\nreputation for fine dairy qualities. The milk is good both in quantity\r\nand quality, yielding, according to a recent statement of Mr. Tennant,\r\nof Scotland, who owns a large herd, fifteen quarts per day during the\r\nbest of the season, twelve of which made a pound of butter. The product\r\nof the latter averages about 170 pounds per annum to each cow. Another\r\nauthority says, on the best low-land pasture, a good cow yields nearly\r\n4000 quarts per year. This is a large quantity, and implies good cows\r\nand extra feed.\r\n\r\nMr. Cushing, of Massachusetts, who imported several select animals,\r\nwithout regard to their cost, informed us, after three or four years'\r\ntrial, that he did not perceive any superiority in them, over the good\r\nnative cows of that state, for dairy purposes. A large number have been\r\nimported in detached parcels, and scattered through the country. They\r\nare good animals, but seem to combine no valuable properties in a higher\r\ndegree than are to be found in our own good cattle, and especially such\r\nas are produced from a cross of the Short Horn bull of a good milking\r\nfamily, on our native cows. They are evidently a recent breed, and do\r\nnot therefore possess that uniformity of appearance and quality, which\r\nattaches to one of long cultivation.\r\n\r\nMr. Aiton, of Scotland, gives the following account of them. \"The dairy\r\nbreed of Scotland have been formed chiefly by skilful management, within\r\nthe last 50 years; and they are still improving and extending to other\r\ncountries. Till after 1770, the cows in Cunningham were small, ill-fed,\r\nill-shaped, and gave but little milk. Some cows of a larger breed and of\r\na brown and white color, were about that time brought to Ayrshire from\r\nTeeswater, and from Holland, by some of the patriotic noblemen of\r\nAyrshire; and these being put on good pasture, yielded more milk than\r\nthe native breed, and their calves were much sought after by the\r\nfarmers.\"\r\n\r\nWe may fairly infer from the foregoing, which is deemed indisputable\r\nauthority; from the locality of their origin, in the neighborhood of the\r\nShort Horns; and from their general resemblance, both externally and in\r\ntheir general characteristics to the grade animals, that they owe their\r\nprincipal excellence to this long-established breed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CALVES.\r\n\r\nThe safest and least troublesome manner of raising calves, is at the\r\nudder of the dam; and whenever the milk is converted into butter and\r\ncheese, we believe this to be the most economical. The milk of one good\r\ncow is sufficient, with a run of fresh, sweet pasture, to the feeding of\r\ntwo calves at the same time; and if we allow the calves to arrive at\r\nthree or four months of age before weaning, we may safely estimate, that\r\none good cow will yield a quantity of milk in one season, fully\r\nequivalent to bringing up four calves to a weaning age.\r\n\r\nBy keeping the calf on the fresh milk, whether he take it directly from\r\nthe udder, or warm from the pail, all risk of disordered bowels is\r\navoided. The milk is precisely adapted to the perfect health and thrift\r\nof the young, and whenever we substitute for it any other food, we must\r\nwatch carefully that not the slightest mismanagement produces disorder,\r\nlest more is lost by disease or want of improvement, than is gained by\r\nthe milk of which they are robbed.\r\n\r\nThe first milk of the cow after calving, is slightly purgative, which is\r\nessential to cleanse the stomach of the calf. It is, moreover, perfectly\r\nworthless for two or three days, for any other purpose except for swine.\r\nThe calf will seldom take all the milk at first, and whatever is left in\r\nthe bag should be thoroughly removed by the hand. If the calf is\r\ndestined for the butcher, he must have all the milk he wants for at\r\nleast six weeks, and eight or ten is better; and if the cow does not\r\nfurnish enough, he ought to be fed gruel or linseed tea. He must be\r\nclosely confined in a snug, but clean and airy stable, and the darker\r\nthis is, and the more quiet he is kept, the more readily he will fatten.\r\n\r\nIf designed to be reared, the safest and least troublesome method, is to\r\nkeep the calf on new milk. If saving the milk be an object, it is still\r\ndoubtful whether it is not better that he should have a part of it fresh\r\nfrom the cow, and depend for his remaining food on a good grass or\r\nclover pasture, meal, or roots.\r\n\r\nSome farmers never allow the calf to approach the dam, but take it when\r\nfirst dropped, and put a handful of salt in its mouth, which is daily\r\nrepeated till he is put to grass. This has a purgative effect, similar\r\nto the first milk. Flaxseed is then prepared, by boiling a pint in four\r\nto six quarts of water, and diluted with hay tea till it is rather\r\nthicker than milk, and fed at blood heat.\r\n\r\n_Hay tea_ is made, by boiling a pound of sweet, well-cured clover, in\r\none and a half gallons of clean water.\r\n\r\nAs the calf becomes older, oat, barley, rye, or Indian meal may be\r\nscalded and added to the flaxseed.\r\n\r\nWhen the skim-milk is of little consequence, a better way is to withdraw\r\nhim from the cow after three or four days, then scald the milk, adding a\r\nlittle oat meal, and cool to the natural temperature of the milk, and\r\nfeed it. Oats, either crushed or ground, is the best and safest grain\r\nfor all young stock. The milk should not stand more than half a day\r\nbefore feeding to young calves. As they advance in age, it may be fed\r\nrather older, but should never be allowed to become sour; nor should it\r\never be fed cold. Connected with this feed, should be a good range of\r\nshort, sweet pasture, and shelter against both sun and storms. If\r\nexpedient, at about 10 weeks old, he may be safely weaned, but four\r\nmonths' nursing is better for the calf.\r\n\r\nIf allowed too much milk for several months, it is injurious to the\r\nfuture development of the young. It does not distend the stomach\r\nproperly, nor call into use its ruminating habits. Calves thus brought\r\nup, have often proved light-bellied, indifferent feeders, and decidedly\r\ninferior animals. When the calf is removed from the cow, they should be\r\neffectually separated from sight and hearing, as recognition creates\r\nuneasiness, and is an impediment to thrift in both.\r\n\r\nIf there be any deficiency of suitable pasture for the calf, a small\r\nrack and trough should be placed under the shed in his range, and fine\r\nhay put in the former, and wheat bran or oat meal with a little salt in\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases and Remedies.\r\n\r\nFor _disordered bowels_, mix 2 dr. rhubarb, 2 oz. castor oil, and 1/2 dr.\r\nginger, with a little warm milk or gruel; or give 2 oz. castor oil\r\nalone; or 3 oz. of Epsom salts.\r\n\r\nFor _scours_ and _diarrh[oe]a_, a homely remedy is, to administer half a\r\npint of cider, with an equal quantity of blood drawn from the calf's\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nOr, add a little rennet to its food.\r\n\r\nA good remedy is, 1 oz. powdered canella bark; 1 oz. laudanum; 4 oz.\r\nprepared chalk; and one pint water. Mix together, and give a wine-glass\r\nfull or more, according to the size of the calf, three times a day.\r\n\r\n_Costiveness_ is removed by giving pork broth.\r\n\r\nOr, give 3 to 4 oz. Epsom salts, dissolved in 3 pints of water, injected\r\ninto the stomach; and repeat part of this dose every 3 or 4 hours, till\r\nthe desired effect is produced.\r\n\r\nCalves, like all young stock, should be allowed to change their feed\r\ngradually, from new milk to skimmed, or from the latter to other food.\r\nTheir stomachs are delicate, and need gentle, moderate changes, when\r\nnecessary to make them at all. Much depends on the care and attention\r\nthey receive. It is well to have a little resin within its reach.\r\n\r\nA comfortable shelter, with a dry, warm bed, suitable food, regularly\r\ngiven three times a day, at blood heat, and keeping the stomach in\r\nproper order, will do much to bring them forward rapidly, and with a\r\nsmall expenditure of food.\r\n\r\nThe calf requires to be supplied through the winter with an abundance of\r\nfine, sweet hay and roots, the latter either chopped or mashed by a\r\nroller, with the addition of a trifle of meal or oats, and a full supply\r\nof salt and pure water.\r\n\r\nWhen there are larger animals on the premises, the calves ought to be\r\nkept by themselves. They should be sustained on their winter feed\r\nthrough the following spring, until the grass furnishes a good bite on a\r\nwell-compacted sod. The change from hay to grass must be gradual, unless\r\nthe latter is considerably matured. The extreme relaxation of the bowels\r\nfrom the sudden change, frequently produces excessive purging. A slight\r\nand temporary relax from the early spring grass, is not objectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding.\r\n\r\nThe young animals should never be put to breeding under 15 months old,\r\nso as to bring their first calf at two years old nor then, unless they\r\nhave large size and good feed. Much depends on the progress towards\r\nmaturity, and the supply of food in selecting the proper time for\r\nbreeding. Some are as ready for this at a year and a half as others are\r\nat three. Early breeding gives delicacy and symmetry to the form of the\r\nheifer, but it checks its growth; and when it is found to put her back\r\ntoo much, she may be allowed to rest for a few months, or even a year,\r\nto brings her up to the desired standard. These remarks apply\r\nprincipally to choice breeders, or as they are sometimes termed, _fancy\r\nstock_. For ordinary milch cows which have been moderately fed, three\r\nyears is a proper age to come in, after which they must be milked as\r\nregularly, and as late before drying as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreaking Steers\r\n\r\nShould be commenced when two or three years old. Some begin with the\r\ncalf, accustoming him to a light yoke and occasional training. This\r\npractice will do as a pastime for trustworthy boys, as it makes them\r\ngentle and manageable afterwards, but is hardly worth a man's time. If\r\nalways carefully handled when young, they will be found tractable.\r\n\r\nThey should at first be placed behind a pair of well-broke cattle, nor\r\nshould they be put to hard labor until quite grown, strong, and\r\nperfectly accustomed to the yoke. If properly managed, cattle may be\r\ntrained with all the docility, intelligence, and much of the activity of\r\nthe horse. That they are not, is more frequently the fault of their\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Oxen.\r\n\r\nTo procure perfect working cattle, it is necessary to begin with the\r\nproper breed. Many parts of the country furnish such as are well suited\r\nto this purpose. A strong dash of Devon or Hereford blood is desirable,\r\nwhen it needs to be improved. A well-formed, compact, muscular body;\r\nclean, sinewy limbs; strong, dense bones; large, well-formed joints,\r\nwith a mild expressive eye, are essential for good working oxen.\r\n\r\nAfter breaking, they must be led along gently, and taught before they\r\nare required to perform their task; and never put to a load which they\r\ncannot readily move, nor dulled by prolonging exertion beyond that\r\nperiod when it becomes irksome. A generous diet is necessary, to keep up\r\nthe spirit and ability of cattle, when there is hard work to be done.\r\nThe horse and mule are fed with their daily rations of grain when at\r\nhard service, and if the spirit of the ox is to be maintained, he\r\nshould be equally well fed, when as fully employed. Great and permanent\r\ninjury is the result of niggardly feeding and severe toil, exacted from\r\nthe uncomplaining animal. His strength declines, his spirit flags, and\r\nif this treatment be continued, he rapidly becomes the stupid, moping\r\nbrute, which is shown off in degrading contrast with the more spirited\r\nhorse, that performs, it may be, one half the labor, on twice his\r\nrations.\r\n\r\nThe ox should be as little abused by threats and whipping, as by stinted\r\nfeed and overtasked labor. Loud and repeated hallooing, or the severe\r\nuse of the lash, is as impolitic as it is cruel and disgraceful. We\r\nnever witness this barbarity without wishing the brutes could change\r\nplaces, long enough at least to teach the biped that humanity by his own\r\nsufferings which his reason and sensibility have failed to inspire.\r\nClear and intelligible, yet low and gentle words are all that are\r\nnecessary to guide the well-trained, spirited ox. The stick, or whip, is\r\nneeded rather to indicate the precise movement desired, than as a\r\nstimulant or means of punishment. The ox understands a moderate tone\r\nmore perfectly than a boisterous one, for all sounds become indistinct\r\nas they increase.\r\n\r\nIt is of great advantage to have oxen well trained to _backing_. They\r\nmay soon be taught, by beginning with an empty cart on a descent; then\r\non a level; then with an increasing load, or uphill, till the cattle\r\nwill back nearly the same load they will draw.\r\n\r\nSome oxen have a bad trick of _hauling_ or _crowding_. Changing to\r\nopposite sides, longer or shorter yokes, and more than all, gentle\r\ntreatment, are the only remedies, and those not unfrequently fail.\r\nCattle will seldom contract this habit, in the hands of a judicious,\r\ncareful driver. _The yokes_ should be carefully made, and set easy, and\r\nthe bows fitted to the necks and properly attached to the yoke. Cattle\r\nare liable to sore necks if used in a storm; and when subject to this\r\nexposure, they must be well rubbed with grease, where the yoke chafes\r\nthem, and respite from work should be allowed till the necks heal.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Bulls or Vicious Animals.\r\n\r\nIf inclined to be vicious, the bulls should have rings thrust through\r\nthe cartilage of their nose when young. They are to be found at the\r\nagricultural warehouses; and are made of round iron, three-eighths of an\r\ninch diameter, with a joint in one side to open, and when thrust through\r\nthe nose, are fastened in a moment, by a rivet previously prepared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nCattle-Handler.]\r\n\r\nFig. 5 is a _cattle-handler_, consisting of a bar of iron A, eight\r\ninches long, with a ring for a man's hand, which turns on a swivel at B,\r\nand at the other end is a pair of calliper-shaped legs, one stationary,\r\nand the other opening on a joint. The fixed leg is inserted against one\r\nside of the nostril, and the other is pressed upon the opposite side,\r\nand there fastened by a slide, C, when the animal is firmly held for\r\nadministering medicine or performing any operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Fig. 7.\r\n\r\nFor taming savage Animals.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 6 and 7, for _taming a bull_; b, in Fig. 6, is a cap screwed on to\r\nthe tip of the horn; a c, an iron rod hanging on a pivot in the cap,\r\nwith a chain reaching to the ring in the nose. The effect of his\r\nattempting to hook, is illustrated by the various positions of the chain\r\nin Fig. 7. If the rod at a, is pushed in either direction, it jerks up\r\nthe nose in a manner that cures him of his inclination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.\r\n\r\nCattle-Tie.]\r\n\r\nFig. 8, shows a _cattle-tie_.--This is a much more convenient and\r\ncomfortable mode of fastening cattle in the stable, than the common\r\nstanchions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proper time for turning off Cattle.\r\n\r\nThis must depend on their previous feeding and management, the breed,\r\nand the purposes required. The improved breeds and many of their\r\ncrosses, will mature for the butcher as fully at three or four, as\r\ninferior cattle at five to seven years old. If pushed rapidly with\r\nproper food, they will of course be _ripe_ much sooner than if stinted.\r\nWhen cattle have to be purchased for work, or cows for the dairy, it\r\nbecomes an object to keep them as long as they can be made profitable,\r\nand yet be turned off for fattening at a fair price. We have seen active\r\nand spirited oxen in the yoke at 16 or 17; but they seldom do as well\r\nafter 12 or even 10 years. Old cattle are liable to more diseases than\r\nyoung; are less hardy; and they recover more slowly when exposed to\r\nscanty feed or hard usage. They also fatten with more difficulty, and\r\ntheir meat is inferior. When they can be sold advantageously to the\r\nfeeder, and replaced without inconvenience, it is found to be most\r\nprofitable to turn them off at seven or eight years. They will by that\r\ntime have attained full maturity; they will feed rapidly, and make the\r\nlargest amount of good beef. If there are extraordinary milkers among\r\nthe cows, or superior workers among the oxen, it is better to keep them\r\nas long as they maintain their full vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\nFattening Cattle.\r\n\r\nSuch as are designed for the shambles the ensuing fall or winter, may be\r\nallowed to do their spring's labor; or if cows, they may be milked into\r\nsummer after calving, or go farrow during the previous year. They should\r\nearly be put on the best summer feed, and it is better to be\r\noccasionally changed, to give variety and freshness, and keep the animal\r\nin good appetite. Let the fattening animals have the best, and after\r\nthey have cropped it a while, give them a fresh field; and the other\r\nanimals or sheep can follow and clear off the remaining herbage,\r\npreparatory to shutting it up for a new growth. Some prefer an extensive\r\nrange of rich feed, which is unchanged throughout the season; and when\r\nit is not necessary to divide the pasture with the other animals, this\r\nis a good practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\nThree cuts of improved forms, Nos. 9, 10, and 11. The above cuts\r\nillustrate the forms which the most improved beef-cattle should possess.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe selection of Animals for Stall Fattening.\r\n\r\nThis is a nice point, and none without a practised eye and touch, can\r\nchoose such as will make the best return for the food consumed. The\r\ncharacteristics of choice animals, heretofore enumerated, are\r\nparticularly essential in those intended for profitable fattening. But\r\nthe most important of all, is that firm mellowness, and quick elasticity\r\nof touch, which unerringly mark the kindly feeder and profitable\r\nbullock. When other means for ascertaining fail, it is a safe rule to\r\nselect the best-conditioned animals, out of a herd of grass-fed; for if\r\nall were of equal flesh and health, when turned out, those which have\r\nthriven most on their summer pasture, will generally fatten quickest on\r\ntheir fall and winter keep. Only the best should be selected. The\r\nremainder, after consuming the coarser forage, may be at once disposed\r\nof for early use. From repeated trials, it is found that the carcass of\r\nstall-fed animals will barely return the value of the materials\r\nconsumed, and their manure is generally the only compensation for the\r\ntime and attention bestowed. None but choice, thrifty beasts will pay\r\nfor their food and attention, and all others will make their best\r\nreturns, by an immediate disposal, after the surplus fodder is gone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.\r\n\r\nPoints of Cattle Illustrated.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION.--A, forehead; B, face; C, cheek; D, muzzle; E, neck; F,\r\nneck vein; G, shoulder point; H, arm; I, shank; J, gambril, or hock; K,\r\nelbow; L, brisket, bosom, or breast; M, shoulder; N, crops; O, loin; P,\r\nhip, hucks, hocks, or huckles; Q, crupper bone, or sacrum; R, rump, or\r\npin-bone; S, round bone, thurl, or whirl; T, buttock; U, thigh, or\r\ngaskit; V, flank; W, plates; X, back, or chine; Y, throat; Z, chest.]\r\n\r\n\r\nStall-Feeding.\r\n\r\nThis ought to be commenced early in the season. An ox may be fed in a\r\nbox-stall, or if accustomed to a mate, they do better by tying together\r\nwith sufficient room, yet not so near as to allow of injuring each\r\nother. The building should be warm, but not hot; well ventilated, yet\r\nhaving no current of cold air passing through; and as dark as possible.\r\nThe stall ought to be kept clean and dry, and a deep bed of clean straw\r\nis of decided advantage.\r\n\r\nThe ox should be first fed the inferior and most perishable roots with\r\nhis grain and dry forage, and his food should be gradually increased in\r\nrichness, as he advances towards maturity. The food and water should be\r\ngiven three times a day, from thoroughly cleaned mangers or troughs. The\r\nanimal likes a change of food, in which he should be indulged as often\r\nas may be necessary. If he refuses his food, a temporary privation, or\r\nvariety is essential. When the food is changed, he should be moderately\r\nfed at first, till he becomes accustomed to it, as there is otherwise\r\ndanger of cloying, which is always injurious. The moment the animal has\r\ndone feeding, the remainder of the food ought to be at once removed. He\r\nthen lies down, and if undisturbed, rests quietly till the proper hour\r\ninduces him again to look for his accustomed rations. Regularity in the\r\ntime of feeding, is of the utmost consequence. An animal soon becomes\r\nhabituated to a certain hour, and if it be delayed beyond this, he is\r\nrestless and impatient, which are serious obstacles to speedy fattening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nOx cut up.\r\n\r\nFig. 13--Shows the London method of cutting up the carcass--Fig. 1, is\r\nthe loin; 2, rump; 3, aitch or adz-bone; 4, buttock; 5, hock; 6, thick\r\nflank; 7, thin flank; 8, fore-rib; 9, middle rib; 10, cuck-rib; 11,\r\nbrisket; 12, leg of mutton piece; 13, clod or neck; 14, brisket.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.\r\n\r\nSkeleton of an Ox.\r\n\r\n1.

The animal gorges the\r\nfirst stomach with so much food, that its contents cannot be expelled.\r\nInflammation of the membrane takes place, and decomposition of the food\r\nsoon follows. This is known by the distension of the paunch, and\r\ndifficulty of breathing, and unless speedily relieved, suffocation and\r\ndeath will ensue. Both sheep and cattle are subject to it.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._[1]--In its early stages, when not too severe, it has been\r\nremoved by administering some one of the following remedies.\r\n\r\nA pint of gin poured down the throat.\r\n\r\nFrom one to two pints of lamp or other oil.\r\n\r\nStrong brine.\r\n\r\nNew milk with one-fifth its bulk of tar mixed.\r\n\r\nAn egg-shell full of tar forced down the throat, followed by a second,\r\nif the first fails.\r\n\r\nA tablespoonful of volatile spirit of ammonia, diluted with water.\r\n\r\nA wine-glass full of powder, mixed with cold lard and forced in balls\r\ninto the stomach.\r\n\r\nA teaspoonful of unslaked lime dissolved in a pint of warm water, shaken\r\nand given immediately.\r\n\r\nA pint of tolerably strong lye.\r\n\r\n[1] Besides his own experience, the writer has drawn from the N. E.\r\nFarmer, the Albany Cultivator, the American Agriculturist, and other\r\nreliable American and English works, some of the remedies for diseases\r\nherein mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Proper Mode of giving the above Remedies\r\n\r\nIs for a person to hold the horn and cartilage of the nose, while\r\nanother seizes and draws out the tongue as far as possible, when the\r\nmedicine is thrust below the root of the tongue. If liquid, it must be\r\ninserted by the use of a bottle.\r\n\r\n_The probang_ is used when the former remedies are ineffectual. This\r\nconsists of a tarred rope, or a flexible whip-stalk, three-fourths of an\r\ninch in diameter, with a swab or bulbous end. Two persons hold the head\r\nof the animal, so as to keep the mouth in a line with the throat, while\r\na third forces it into the stomach, when the gas finds a passage out. A\r\nstiff leather tube with a lead nozzle pierced with holes, is best for\r\ninsertion, through which the gas will readily escape.\r\n\r\nSome one of the above purgatives should be given after the bloat has\r\nsubsided, and careful feeding for some days must be observed.\r\n\r\nLight gruels are best for allaying inflammation, and restoring the tone\r\nof the stomach.\r\n\r\nWhen no other means are available, the paunch may be tapped with a sharp\r\npenknife, plunging it 11/2 inches forward of the hip bone, towards the\r\nlast rib in the left side. If the hole fills up, put in a large\r\ngoose-quill tube, which to prevent slipping into the wound, may remain\r\nattached to the feather, and the air can escape through a large hole in\r\nthe upper end.\r\n\r\n_Prevention_ is vastly better than cure, and may be always secured, by\r\nnot allowing hungry cattle to fill themselves with clover, roots,\r\napples, &c. When first put upon such feed, it should be when the dew and\r\nrain are off, and their stomachs are already partially filled; and they\r\nshould then be withdrawn before they have gorged themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.\r\n\r\nThe Stomach Pump.]\r\n\r\nThis is a convenient instrument for extracting poisonous substances from\r\nthe stomach. It is also highly useful for administering medicines and\r\ninjections, and if fitted with several tubes, one may suffice for\r\nanimals of any size. It consists of a syringe, _a_, with a side opening\r\nat _b_, and another at the bottom _d_, as shown in Fig. 16. For\r\ninjections, Fig. 15 is used, and the end of the syringe is placed in a\r\nvessel containing the fluid, when a probang or injection-tube is screwed\r\non to the side opening at _b_, through which the fluid is forced into\r\nthe stomach or rectum, as may be required. The probang should be a tube\r\nof thick but elastic leather, and it may be passed into the mouth,\r\nthrough an aperture in a block, placed on edge between the teeth, which\r\nis easily done while a person holds the head of the animal firmly.\r\n\r\n\r\nChoking\r\n\r\nIs frequently relieved by some of the following expedients.\r\n\r\nThe use of the probang or whip-stock, mentioned under the head of\r\n_remedies for Hoven_, by which the root is forced into the stomach.\r\n\r\nA soft root may be crushed so as to allow of swallowing, by holding a\r\nsmooth block against it, and striking with a mallet on the opposite\r\nside.\r\n\r\nIf within arms-length, the root may be removed by hand.\r\n\r\nIt is said this can be done, by tying up the fore-leg with a small cord,\r\nclose to the body, and giving the animal a sudden start with a whip; or\r\nby jerking the fore-leg out forward.\r\n\r\nOr pour down the throat a pint bottle full of soft soap, mixed with\r\nsufficient hot water to make it run freely.\r\n\r\n_Prevention_ consists in cutting the roots; not feeding them when the\r\nanimals are very hungry, and not disturbing them while eating.\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation of the Stomach.\r\n\r\nThis is frequently produced by a sudden change from dry to green food,\r\nand some other causes.\r\n\r\nEpsom salts, castor oil, sulphur, and carbonate of soda, in sufficient\r\nquantity to purge freely, are good remedies.\r\n\r\nIt may be prevented by changing the food gradually.\r\n\r\n\r\nMange, or Scab.\r\n\r\nThis is denoted by the animal rubbing the hair off about the eyes and\r\nother parts. The skin is scaly or scabby, sometimes appearing like a\r\nlarge seed-wart.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Rub the spots with sulphur and lard, after scraping and\r\nwashing with soap.\r\n\r\nWhen the skin is cracked, take sulphur, 1 lb.; turpentine, 1/4 lb.;\r\nunguentum, (or mercurial ointment,) 2 ounces; linseed oil, 1 pint. Melt\r\nthe turpentine and warm the oil, and when partly cooled, stir in the\r\nsulphur; when cold, add the unguentum, mixing all well. Rub this\r\nthoroughly with the hand on the parts affected.\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt this, like scab in sheep and itch in the human species,\r\nwill be found, on close investigation, to be caused by minute insects\r\nlocated in the skin. Salt and water ought, in that case, to be a good\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHollow Horn, or Horn Ail.\r\n\r\nThis is not unfrequently _hollow stomach_, and very often follows\r\nstinted fare, hard usage, and exposure to cold. We have noticed this as\r\nmost prevalent among oxen that have done a severe winter's work.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Bloody urine; swollen udder; shaking the head; eyes and\r\nhead swollen; standing with the head against a fence or barn; eyes dull\r\nand sunken, and horns cold.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Bleed and physic, shelter and feed properly.\r\n\r\nTake a half pint of good vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of salt, one\r\nteaspoonful of pepper, and mix and pour into each ear, holding the head\r\non one side for two minutes.\r\n\r\nBore with a large gimlet on the under side of the horn, three or four\r\ninches from the head; and if hollow, bore nearer the head and let out\r\nall the matter, and syringe two or three times a day with salt and\r\nwater, or soap-suds, or salt and vinegar.\r\n\r\nSpirits of turpentine rubbed in around the base of the horns, will\r\narrest the disease in its incipient stages.\r\n\r\nPour a spoonful of boiling hot brimstone into the cavity between the\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\nPour a teakettle of boiling water on the horns, holding so as to prevent\r\ninjury to the other parts.\r\n\r\nSoot and pepper given internally are good.\r\n\r\n\r\nJaundice, or Yellows.\r\n\r\nThis is owing to gall-stones or calculi, which occasionally accumulate\r\nin large numbers, and is sometimes owing to increased or altered quality\r\nof the bile. It is manifested by the yellowness of the eye and skin, and\r\nhigh color of the urine, and poor appetite.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Bleed, and purge with Epsom salts.\r\n\r\nIf taken in season, 2 ounces of ground mustard may be mixed with a\r\nliquid, and given twice a day.\r\n\r\nGreen food is a good preventive.\r\n\r\n\r\nMad Itch.\r\n\r\nThis disease exists in some of the Western states, and shows itself by\r\njerking of the head, and itching around the nose and base of the horns.\r\nThey will lick their sides and backs, and jerk and hiccup till they fill\r\nthemselves with wind; afterwards they froth at the mouth, and in 24\r\nhours die raving mad.\r\n\r\n_Remedy._--Give as much soot and salt as the animal will eat; soon\r\nafter, give 3/4 or 1 lb. of brimstone or sulphur; and 8 hours after, as\r\nmany salts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBloody Murrain, or Red Water.\r\n\r\nThis disease first shows itself in a cough, then heaving of the flanks,\r\nwith bloody, black, and f[oe]tid evacuations, tenderness over the loins,\r\nand coldness of the horns. Tumors and biles sometimes appear. The animal\r\nholds down the head, moans, is restless, and staggers when walking.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--We have lost several animals by this fatal disease, and are\r\nnot aware of having cured any when severely attacked. In repeated\r\ninstances, we have seen large flukes taken out of the liver, strongly\r\nresembling the common leech, which abounds in many of our swampy lands.\r\nIt is certain that on new, low swamps and clay lands, cattle are most\r\nliable to it; and when they have been subject to repeated attacks in\r\nsuch localities, clearing and draining have checked it.\r\n\r\nYouatt attributes it to certain kinds of forage, which are peculiar to\r\nthe above situations. We are rather inclined to ascribe it to exposure,\r\nto excessive dampness, and especially to miasma; for although the brute\r\ncreation are perhaps less sensitive to these influences than man, yet,\r\nas they are governed by the same unvarying laws of nature, when\r\nsubjected to conditions totally unsuited to their economy, they must\r\nsuffer equally in kind, though probably not in degree, with the more\r\nrefined human frame. But it is evident the disease, its causes, and\r\nremedies, are as yet imperfectly understood.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--However intelligent men may differ as to its causes, all\r\nagree that the animal should first be bled, and then thoroughly purged.\r\nIn obstinate cases, this last is a difficult matter. We have given\r\nrepeated doses of powerful cathartics without producing any effect; and\r\nwhenever the medicine is inoperative, death speedily follows.\r\n\r\nLarge doses of common salt, or Epsom salts dissolved in water, are good\r\npurgatives, and if the animal neglects drinking after taking them, he\r\nshould be drenched with copious draughts of water. These should be\r\nrepeated every few hours, if ineffectual.\r\n\r\nInjections are sometimes useful, when medicine fails to act. These may\r\nbe made of soap and water; or take 2 or 3 gills of oats boiled, 3\r\ndrachms saltpetre, 11/2 oz. linseed oil, mix and use them when warm.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the bowels may be followed with a pint of linseed oil, as\r\nan additional and gentle laxative.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal begins to recover, gentle astringents and tonics may be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n_Preventives._--We have more confidence in preventives than in remedies.\r\nGood keep, shelter, dryness, and clean pastures, will generally prevent\r\nattack. The cattle should at all times be supplied with two or three\r\ntroughs under cover, on the sides and bottoms of which tar should be\r\nplentifully spread. Let equal portions of salt and slaked lime be in\r\none; salt and wood ashes in another; and salt and brimstone in a third.\r\nMany farmers have entirely avoided this disease while using one or more\r\nof these, when they annually lost many by it previously.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoof Ail\r\n\r\nIs indicated by lameness, fever, and a soft swelling just above the\r\nhoof.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Carefully wash the foot in warm soap-suds, and while still\r\ndamp, apply between the claws on the affected part from one to three\r\ngrains of corrosive sublimate. If it does not fully adhere, it must be\r\nmixed with hog's lard, but it should be so applied as to be out of the\r\nreach of the animal's tongue, as it is a powerful poison, and the\r\nextreme irritability of the feet will induce him to lick them.\r\n\r\nThe claw is efficiently cleansed, by drawing a cord briskly through it,\r\nwhen either of the above applications, or blue vitriol put on two or\r\nthree times a day, or spirits of turpentine, will effect a cure.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes cured by putting the animals in the stanchions, and\r\napplying a sharp chisel three-fourths of an inch from the toe, and\r\nstriking it with a mallet till it is cut off. If it does not bleed\r\nfreely, cut off shavings till it does. If the animal is refractory, let\r\na person hold up the opposite foot. Keep them in the stable two or three\r\ndays, and out of the mud for a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nLoss of Cud\r\n\r\nIs loss of appetite, prostration, and general ill-health.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Give a warm bran mash, with good hay, and warm water with\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nAn aloe tincture, made with brandy and ginger, is good.\r\n\r\nAfterwards give good, dry, nourishing food; and bitter infusions,\r\nchamomile flowers, hoarhound, oak bark, &c., in beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nScours, or Diarrh[oe]a.\r\n\r\nA common remedy, is to boil the bark of white oak, white pine, and\r\nbeech, and give a strong infusion in bran. If they refuse to eat it,\r\npour it down. The oak is astringent, and the pine and beech soothing and\r\nhealing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarbles\r\n\r\nAre grubs, the egg of which is deposited in the back of cattle by the\r\ngad-fly, (_[OE]strus bovis._) They are discernible by a protuberance or\r\nswelling on the back. They may be pressed out by the thumb and finger;\r\nor burnt out by plunging a hot wire in them; or a few applications of\r\nstrong brine will remove them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds\r\n\r\nIn cattle are readily healed, when the animal's blood is in good order,\r\nby applying a salve made of 1 oz. green copperas; 2 oz. white vitriol; 2\r\noz. salt; 2 oz. linseed oil; 8 oz. molasses. Boil over a slow fire 15\r\nminutes in a pint of urine, and when almost cold, add 1 oz. oil of\r\nvitriol, and 4 oz. spirits turpentine. Apply it with a feather to the\r\nwound, and cure soon follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk, or Puerperal Fever,\r\n\r\nIs a common disease with cows in high condition, at the time of calving.\r\nIt may, in almost every case, be avoided, by keeping them in moderate\r\nfeed and flesh.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Bleed freely, say 6 to 10 quarts, according to the\r\ncirculation of the blood; then give 1 to 11/2 lbs. of Epsom salts,\r\naccording to the size of the beast, to be repeated in half lb. doses\r\nevery six hours, till she purges freely.\r\n\r\nInjections should always be given when purgatives are tardy in their\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaked Bag\r\n\r\nMay be removed by simmering the bark of the root of bitter-sweet in\r\nlard, till it becomes very yellow. When cool, apply it to the swollen\r\nudder once in 8 or 10 hours; or wash it several times a day in cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA pint of horseradish, fed once a day, cut up with potatoes or meal, is\r\nuseful for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThis is also a tonic, helps the appetite, and is good for oxen subject\r\nto heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nGarget\r\n\r\nIs a more intense degree of inflammation than exists in caked bag and\r\nsore, swollen teats, and shows itself in hard bunches on the udder.\r\n\r\nThe cow should be bled, and take a large dose of physic; then wash the\r\nudder as in caked bag.\r\n\r\nRepeated doses of sulphur is a good remedy.\r\n\r\nGarget, or scoke root, given of the size of a large finger, grated and\r\nfed in their food, is a general application with farmers. The garget\r\nplant grows from three to six feet high, with a purple stalk, and\r\nstrings of berries hanging down between the branches.\r\n\r\n\r\nSore Teats\r\n\r\nMay be healed by rubbing with goose oil, cream, new milk; or make the\r\nsame applications for it as for caked bag. The bag and teats should be\r\nwell cleansed with warm soft water, if to be followed by any ointment.\r\n\r\nThe following application is recommended by Youatt: One ounce of yellow\r\nwax and three of lard; melt together, and when cooling, rub in one\r\nquarter ounce of sugar of lead, and a drachm of alum finely powdered.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarts\r\n\r\nAre of two kinds; the first, on the outer skin, may be removed by\r\nrubbing with camphorated olive oil. The others penetrate into the flesh,\r\nand may be removed by a ligature of fine twine, or silk, or india-rubber\r\ndrawn into a string, and tied tightly around the wart, which falls off\r\nin a few days.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Nitrate of silver, (lunar caustic,) applied to the wart,\r\nwill remove it, but it produces a sore.\r\n\r\nApply a strong wash of alum.\r\n\r\nRub with the juice of milk-weed.\r\n\r\nPoultice with grated carrot.\r\n\r\nCut off the wart with sharp scissors, when the cow is dry. It will bleed\r\nlittle, and soon heal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSore Necks on Working Oxen.\r\n\r\nThese occur when worked in wet weather, or with bad yokes. The _remedy_\r\nis, rub with a healing application. The _preventive_ is, good yokes; the\r\napplication of grease; or a decoction of white or yellow oak bark\r\napplied to the affected parts. Or, a better preventive is a canvass or\r\nleather cap to protect the neck entirely from the storm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bite of Poisonous Snakes\r\n\r\nMay be cured by shaking together equal parts of olive oil and hartshorn,\r\nand rubbing the wound and adjacent parts three or four times a day. For\r\na full-grown animal, one quart of olive oil and an ounce of hartshorn\r\nshould be administered internally, in addition to the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Stings of Bees, Hornets, &c.\r\n\r\nApply warm vinegar and salt, rubbing the parts thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a Forming Tumor.\r\n\r\nRub thoroughly with strong brine, or a solution of sal ammoniac\r\ndissolved in eight times its weight of water. If the tumor comes to a\r\nhead, open it near the bottom with a lancet; or place a seton in it so\r\nas to admit the escape of purulent matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLice and Vermin\r\n\r\nSometimes abound on cattle during the latter part of winter and spring.\r\nThese are generally the result of _mange_, which is itself the effect of\r\nill-feeding and ill-condition. They are removed with the cause. We doubt\r\nif they can be permanently kept off, where the animal is losing flesh\r\nand health.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Restore the health and condition, and sprinkle sand, ashes,\r\nor dirt plentifully around the roots of the horns, and along the ridge\r\nof the neck and back.\r\n\r\nA liberal application of train or other oil has nearly a similar effect.\r\n\r\nNever apply an ointment containing corrosive sublimate or other poison,\r\nas it may be licked by the animal or its fellows, who may thus become\r\nseriously poisoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trembles,\r\n\r\nProducing _milk sickness_ (a most fatal disease) in the human family,\r\nfrom eating the milk or flesh of animals affected by it. This disease,\r\nwhich exists principally in the region of the Wabash River, is supposed\r\nby Dr. Drake to be owing to the _poison oak_, (Rhus Toxicodendron,) or\r\n_poison vine_, (Radicans,) which the animals eat.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The animal mopes, is feverish and costive, but apparently\r\npreserves its appetite. The next stage of the disease is faintness and\r\nvertigo, which is shown when the animal is put upon exertion, being\r\nfollowed by excessive _trembling_ and entire prostration.\r\n\r\n_Remedy._--Almost every cathartic has been tried in vain. Indian corn,\r\nboth dry and green, has been fed to all animals accustomed to eating it,\r\nand when they can be induced to feed upon it freely, purging is\r\ngenerally secured. Rest of the animal is absolutely essential while the\r\ndisease continues, and is itself an effectual remedy in mild cases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides the diseases enumerated, there are occasional epidemics, such as\r\n_black tongue_, _black foot_, or _foot root_, _&c._, which carry off\r\ngreat numbers of animals. Remedies for these are frequently not\r\ndiscovered, and the epidemic is allowed to run its course unchecked. The\r\nonly preventives are such care, food, and management as the experienced\r\nherdsman knows to be best suited to the maintenance of the health and\r\nthrift of his stock.\r\n\r\n_Note._--Some ailments will be found under the head of _diseases_ of the\r\nother animals mentioned in this work, the general resemblance of which\r\nto each other will justify nearly a similar treatment.\r\n\r\nIf intelligent _farriers_ are at hand, they may sometimes be called in\r\nwith advantage; though we acknowledge our distrust of the quackery of\r\nmost of those passing under this title. There is little science or\r\nintelligent study in the composition of this class, the world over; and\r\nmuch of their practice is the merest empiricism. The owner should see to\r\nit, if he employs one of whose attainments he is doubtful, that neither\r\nmedicines nor operations be used, unnecessarily severe or hazardous to\r\nthe animal. Especially, should the diabolical practice be interdicted,\r\nof the abundant and indiscriminate use of poisons, boiling oils,\r\nturpentine, and tar, and the hot iron applied to the sensitive wound or\r\nnaked flesh. If certain or effectual remedies for the removal of disease\r\ncannot he applied, such as augment the suffering or endanger the life of\r\nthe poor dumb things, may at least be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE DAIRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCows for the Dairy.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said on the various characteristics of the different\r\nbreeds of cattle, it must be evident, that no very definite criteria of\r\nexcellence can be given for all good dairy cows. But there are certain\r\npoints in a good milker, that can hardly be mistaken.\r\n\r\nShe should be descended from the best milking stock; her head should be\r\nsmall or of medium size, muzzle fine, and nostrils flexible and\r\nexpanded; face long, slender, and dishing; cheeks thin; eyes full, mild,\r\nand prominent; horns delicate and waxy, and they may be either\r\nbranching, lopped, crumpled, or hornless; long, thin, lively ear, and\r\nthe inside of an orange color; neck thin and small at its junction with\r\nthe head; deep chest, but not too heavy before; back level and broad;\r\nwell ribbed; belly large; low flank; wide thighs, but thin; short legs,\r\nand standing well apart; large milking veins; loose, capacious udder,\r\ncoming well out behind; good teats; loose, mellow skin, of a deep\r\nyellow; and a fine, thick coat of glossy hair; and she must be of a good\r\ndisposition, and free from tricks.\r\n\r\nYet, with all the skill of a well-practised taste in the selection of\r\nanimals, the dairyman will frequently find his theories and results at\r\nsad variance. One may sometimes select a fine animal, with every\r\nappearance of good milking qualities, which is but a medium cow at the\r\npail; and another, that hardly seems worthy of notice, and which sets at\r\ndefiance many established milking points, and all preconceived notions\r\nof symmetry, may yet prove a good milker. A cow that runs to flesh while\r\nin milk, is generally an indifferent animal for the dairy. Perfection\r\nin a cow, consists in converting all she eats into milk while yielding\r\nit, and when dry, in turning all she consumes into valuable meat.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Dairy Cows.\r\n\r\nA cow may have her first calf when between two and three years of age,\r\naccording to her size and development. After calving, she should be\r\nstinted in her food for two or three days, and not fed freely for a\r\nweek. Avoid fat in a breeding cow. Too high feeding is the cause of\r\nmilk-fever, caked bag, garget, and a host of evils; and very poor feed\r\nis almost equally objectionable.\r\n\r\nThe average time of a cow with young, is from 40 to 41 weeks; but they\r\nsometimes go only 34, and occasionally overrun 44.\r\n\r\nA dry, unoccupied stall or yard is best for her to calve in; and if\r\nthere is any serious delay or difficulty in the operation, she may be\r\nassisted by placing the f[oe]tus in the right position, and gently\r\npulling it, with every throe of the dam. After the calf has drawn all he\r\nwants at morning and evening, the bag should be thoroughly and quickly\r\nemptied of all the milk. If strong and vigorous, the calf is the best\r\ndoctor for garget or caked bag. He may be allowed to suck the cow or\r\nnot, at the option of the owner; there are reasons for and against the\r\npractice, as will be seen under the head of rearing calves, and each\r\nperson must determine in his own case on which side the balance lies.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilking.\r\n\r\nThis is an important operation, and on its proper performance depends\r\nmuch of the success of the dairyman. A cow regularly, gently, yet\r\nquickly and thoroughly milked, will give much more than if neglected. If\r\na herd of cows be separated into two divisions, each yielding the same\r\nquantity of milk, and one is given to a good milker, and the other to a\r\nshiftless or lazy one, the latter will speedily reduce his milk much\r\nbelow the quantity obtained by the former; and if the milkers then\r\nexchange cows, they will be found to change quantity too, those before\r\naffording the least, soon giving the most. An indifferent milker ought\r\nnever to be tolerated in a herd, good ones are cheaper at double the\r\nprice. It is best to milk at intervals of about 12 hours; which may be\r\ndone when pastures are convenient, or cows are soiled or fed in the\r\nyard. But as this is not often the case in the season of green food,\r\nthey should be milked early in the morning and turned into pasture, to\r\nfill themselves before the sun is oppressive; and if they are to be kept\r\nup at night, let them browse in the pasture as long as possible, before\r\nthey are brought to the yard.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILK\r\n\r\nIs produced from the females of all the warm-blooded animals, which are\r\nenumerated among the mammaliae. The milk of several animals is employed\r\nfor domestic purposes, among different nations. That of the camel is\r\nused by the Arabs; the milk of the ass by the Spaniards, the Maltese,\r\nand the inhabitants of the Levant; that of the mare by the Cossacks, the\r\nKirgheez, and other Tartars; and that of the goat, the ewe, and the cow,\r\nby most of the ancient, and with few exceptions, by every modern\r\nEuropean nation. Within the last century, however, the use of all\r\nexcepting cow's milk has been almost entirely discarded, among the most\r\nhighly civilized people.\r\n\r\nIf we except some few Welsh and Swiss, or other emigrants, who resort to\r\nthe goat and ewe for their dairy materials, for the first few years of\r\ntheir residence here, the cow is the only animal which is employed in\r\nAmerica for producing milk. For this, she is pre-eminently fitted, and\r\nthe modern improvement of this invaluable animal has carried her product\r\nof milk almost as far as can be reasonably looked for from a given\r\namount of food; and although this is of about the average richness of\r\nthe goat and ewe, and before that of the ass, the quantity she yields is\r\nfrequently as 60 to 1, in favor of the cow, over the first two\r\ncompetitors. As a milk-giving animal, the cow is the best fitted for the\r\npurposes of civilized man; and she is made to contribute, not only to\r\nhis health, his comfort, and his economy, but to many of his choicest\r\nluxuries. Milk contains every element of nutrition necessary to animal\r\nexistence; and man can subsist, with unimpaired health and strength, if\r\nlimited to this food alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constituents of Milk\r\n\r\nAre butter, which varies from 2 to 6 per cent.; casein or cheese,\r\nusually 4 to 5, but sometimes varying from 3 to 15 per cent.; (the last\r\nexcessive quantity, yielded only by the first milk after calving;)\r\nmilk-sugar, 4 to 6; salts or saline matter, 0.2 to 0.6; and water, 80 to\r\n89.\r\n\r\n_There is much diversity in the product and quality of milk_ from cows\r\nof the same breed, the same food, and other circumstances and\r\nconditions, apparently equal. Thus, of a herd of 22, chiefly Ayrshire,\r\none gave 84 quarts in one week, which afforded 31/2 lbs. of butter; two\r\nothers in the same time gave 86, yielding 51/2 lbs.; and a fourth gave 88\r\nquarts, making 7 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe amount of butter, however, which a given quantity of milk will\r\nproduce, is not the only criterion of the value of the milk, except for\r\nthis purpose alone. Some cows will yield more butter, others will\r\nproduce more cheese; while for consumption, another may partially\r\ncompensate, in the increased quantity of milk-sugar, and the saline\r\nmatters, for a deficiency of both the other ingredients. But for dairy\r\npurposes, butter and cheese are the only measure of the value of milk;\r\nand a cow is esteemed good or indifferent, as she gives one or the other\r\nin the greatest abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumstances which modify the Quantity and Character of Milk.\r\n\r\nBesides the accidental variation in the quantity and quality of milk in\r\ndifferent animals, before adverted to, there are many reliable causes\r\nwhich influence both. Of these, parentage has a most decided and uniform\r\ninfluence, frequently modified, however, in the particular individual,\r\nby some personal and controlling causes. But a cow, whose maternal\r\nancestry on both sides are choice milkers, is almost certain to resemble\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFood influences the quantity, rather than the quality. Boussingault\r\ntried numerous experiments, with cows fed on various kinds of food, and\r\nfound the difference hardly appreciable in the quality of milk. Its true\r\nbenefit is to be looked for in the increased quantity, through which,\r\nthe valuable ingredients are distributed in nearly the same proportion,\r\nas when the product is materially lessened. By quality we mean to be\r\nunderstood, the amount of the ingredients, _valuable for nutrition\r\nonly_; for it is certain, that there is a rich aromatic flavor, not only\r\nin milk, but in butter and cheese, which is afforded in various articles\r\nof food, and especially by the fresh green herbage which abounds in the\r\npastures from spring to autumn.\r\n\r\nActivity or rest has a great effect on both quantity and quality. The\r\nless action, and the more quiet and rest, the greater the amount of milk\r\nand butter. But exercise is absolutely essential to the production of\r\ncheese. Butter may be made from cows confined in a stable, but cheese\r\ncan only be profitably made from animals at pasture. It is supposed by\r\nphysiologists, that the exercise in gathering their food, rather than\r\nany peculiarity in its character, is necessary to convert the\r\nnitrogenized tissues into the nitrogenized principle of caseum or\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nThe time from calving, has also its effect. The first milk drawn from a\r\ncow after calving, has been found to yield over 15 per cent. of casein,\r\nwhile in its ordinary state it gives only three to five and a half. As\r\nthe quantity of milk diminishes in a farrow cow, the quality improves\r\nwithin certain limits. Pregnancy affects the quality injuriously, and\r\nespecially towards its latter stages; and a cow that is predisposed to\r\ngiving milk, should be dried off a few weeks before its expiration, as\r\nit is then unfit for use.\r\n\r\nFat cows give poorer milk than such as are moderately lean; and young\r\nanimals do not come up to the maximum of their quality, till after their\r\nthird or fourth calving.\r\n\r\nThe milk first drawn from the udder, will yield only an eighth, and\r\nsometimes even a much less proportion of cream, than the strippings; and\r\nthe milk which is drawn three times a day, is greatly inferior to such\r\nas is taken but once, though the latter is less abundant.\r\n\r\nExcitement, or fretfulness; change of locality, or to a different herd,\r\nwith new companions; separation from her calf; periodical heat;\r\nannoyance from flies, or worry from dogs; exposure to storms, severe\r\ncold, or an oppressive sun, and many similar causes, diminish the\r\nquantity of milk and butter; but some of these may reasonably be\r\nexpected to increase the proportion of its casein.\r\n\r\nDr. Playfair found that the quantity of butter in the evening milk,\r\nafter the cow had been at pasture all day, was 3.7 per cent., while the\r\ncasein was 5.4; after lying quietly all night, the milk from the same\r\ncow, on the following morning, contained 5.6 per cent. of butter, and\r\nonly 3.9 of casein. In stabling the cow, the butter was invariably in\r\ngreater proportion than when allowed to ramble in the pasture; and the\r\ncasein, with a single exception, was equally diminished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.\r\n\r\nLactometer, or Cream Guage.]\r\n\r\nFig. 17, is a number of glass tubes of equal size, set in a frame called\r\na _lactometer_ or _cream guage_. If milk from different cows be set in\r\nthese, the depth of the cream will indicate their comparative richness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCream.\r\n\r\nIf milk be immediately set away in shallow vessels, after being taken\r\nfrom the cow, the cream rises to the surface, carrying with it most of\r\nthe butter contained in the milk, and much of its casein also. Hence,\r\nthe great nutritive properties of buttermilk, which retains the casein\r\nin very large proportions, much of it being rejected by the butter in\r\nits separation from the cream.\r\n\r\nA temperature below 34 deg., will prevent the cream from rising in any\r\nconsiderable quantity, and preserve the milk unaltered for some weeks.\r\nCoagulating the milk from any cause, will equally prevent the separation\r\nof the cream. The elevation of temperature within certain limits,\r\nhastens the separation. Thus, at 50 deg., the cream will mostly have risen\r\nin 36 hours; at 55 deg., in 24; at 68 deg., in 18 or 20; and at 77 deg., in 10 or 12\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nHeating the milk near the boiling point, and then setting it away and\r\nallowing it to remain undisturbed, will soon cause the cream to rise. In\r\nthe celebrated Orange dairy, near Baltimore, Md., this system was\r\npractised, by which, not only most of the cream was secured for butter,\r\nbut in consequence of its rapid separation, the skimmed milk was sent to\r\nmarket within a few hours after being drawn; and the scalding imparted\r\nto it an agreeable flavor and apparent richness, which it did not really\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated clouted cream of Devonshire, England, and the butter made\r\nfrom it, contains an unusual quantity of casein, the consequence of\r\nheating the milk. \"It is prepared by straining the warm milk into large\r\nshallow pans into which a little water has previously been put, allowing\r\nthese to stand from six to twelve hours, and then carefully heating them\r\nover a slow fire, or on a hot plate, till the milk approaches the\r\nboiling point. The milk, however, must not actually boil, nor must the\r\nskin of the cream be broken. The dishes are now removed into the dairy,\r\nand allowed to cool. In summer the cream should be churned on the\r\nfollowing day; in winter it may stand over two days. The quantity of\r\ncream obtained is said to be one-fourth greater by this method, and the\r\nmilk which is left is proportionably poor.\"--[_Johnston._]\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectricity\r\n\r\nHas much to do with the changes in milk, as in all other substances.\r\nGlass milk-pans might, therefore, be supposed to be the best vessels for\r\nkeeping the milk unchanged and sweet.\r\n\r\nIt may possibly not afford any practical result, yet intelligent\r\nexperiments for introducing a stream of electricity might well be\r\njustified, to aid in the separation of the butteraceous particles in the\r\noperation of churning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSour Cream.\r\n\r\nCream, for the purpose of churning, is usually allowed to become sour.\r\nIt ought to be at least one day old, but may with advantage be kept\r\nseveral days in cool weather, if it be previously well freed from milk,\r\nand be frequently stirred to keep it from curdling. This sour cream is\r\nput into the churn, and worked in the usual way until the butter\r\nseparates. This is collected into lumps, well beat and squeezed free\r\nfrom the milk, and in some dairies is washed with pure cold water as\r\nlong as the water is rendered milky. In other localities the butter is\r\nnot washed, but after being well beat, is carefully freed from the\r\nremaining milk by repeated squeezings and dryings with a clean cloth.\r\nBoth methods, no doubt, have their advantages. In the same\r\ncircumstances, the washed butter may be more easily preserved in the\r\nfresh state, while the unwashed butter will probably possess a higher\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Cream\r\n\r\nMay be put into the churn and the butter be obtained, but in most cases\r\nit requires more labor and longer time, without, in the opinion of good\r\njudges, affording in general a finer quality of butter. In all cases the\r\ncream becomes sour during the agitation, and before the butter begins\r\ndistinctly to form.\r\n\r\n\r\nClouted Cream\r\n\r\nThe churning of the clouted cream of this and other countries, forms an\r\nexception to the general rule just stated, that more time is required in\r\nthe churning of sweet creams. Clouted cream may be churned in the\r\nmorning after it is made, that is, within twenty-four hours of the time\r\nwhen the milk was taken from the cow; and from such cream it is well\r\nknown that the butter separates with very great ease. But in this case,\r\nthe heating of the cream has already disposed the oily matter to cohere,\r\nan incipient running together of the globules has probably taken place\r\nbefore the cream is removed from the milk, and hence the comparative\r\nease with which the churning is effected. There is something peculiar in\r\nbutter prepared in this way, as it is known in other countries by the\r\nname of Bohemian butter. It is said to be very agreeable in flavor, but\r\nit must contain more cheesy matter than the butter from ordinary cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nChurning the whole Milk\r\n\r\nIs a much more laborious method, from the difficulty of keeping in\r\nmotion such large quantities of fluid. It has the advantage, however, of\r\ngiving a larger quantity of butter. At Rennes, in Brittany, the milk of\r\nthe previous evening is poured _into the churn_ along with the warm\r\nmorning's milk, and the mixture is allowed to stand for some hours, when\r\nthe whole is churned. In this way it is said that a larger quantity of\r\nbutter is obtained, and of a more delicate flavor.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Glasgow, according to Mr. Aiton, the milk is\r\nallowed to stand six, twelve, or twenty-four hours in the dairy, till\r\nthe whole has cooled, and the cream has risen to the surface. Two or\r\nthree milkings, still sweet, are then poured together with their cream,\r\ninto a large vessel, and are left undisturbed till the whole has become\r\nquite sour, and is completely coagulated. The proper sourness is\r\nindicated by the formation of a stiff _brat_ upon the surface _which has\r\nbecome uneven_. Great care must be taken to keep the brat and curd\r\nunbroken until the milk is about to be churned, for if any of the whey\r\nbe separated, the air gains admission to it and to the curd, and\r\nfermentation is induced. By this fermentation, the quality of the butter\r\nmay or may not be affected, but that of the buttermilk is almost sure to\r\nbe injured.\r\n\r\nIn Holland the practice is a little different. The cream is not allowed\r\nto rise to the surface at all, but the milk is stirred two or three\r\ntimes a day, till it gets sour, and so thick that a wooden spoon will\r\nstand in it. It is then put into the churn, and the working, or the\r\nseparation of the butter is assisted by the addition of a quantity of\r\ncold water. By churning the sour milk in one or other of these ways, the\r\nbutter is said to be \"rich, sound, and well-flavored.\" If it be greater\r\nin quantity, it is, according to Sprengel, because the fatty matter\r\ncarries with it from the milk a larger quantity of casein than it does\r\nin most cases from the cream alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSourness of the Cream.\r\n\r\nFor the production of the best butter, it is necessary that the cream\r\nshould be sufficiently sour before it is put into the churn. Butter made\r\nfrom sweet cream (not clouted) is neither good in quality, nor large in\r\nquantity, and longer time is required in churning. It is an unprofitable\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nFig. 18 is a _Cylindrical Thermometer Churn_, of any required size, with\r\nfalse metal bottom to hold cold or hot water for bringing the cream to\r\nthe proper temperature. A thermometer, permanently set in the side,\r\nindicates the heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuickness in Churning.\r\n\r\nThe more quickly milk or cream is churned, the paler, the softer, and\r\nthe less rich the butter. Cream, according to Mr. Aiton, may be safely\r\nchurned in an hour and a half, while milk ought to obtain from two to\r\nthree hours. The churning ought always to be regular, slower in warm\r\nweather, that the butter may not be soft and white, and quicker in\r\nwinter, that the proper temperature may be kept up.\r\n\r\nA barrel-churn, lately introduced into this country, being placed in a\r\ntrough of water of the proper temperature, readily imparts the degree of\r\nheat required by the milk or cream without the necessity of adding warm\r\nwater to the milk, _and churns the whole in ten or twelve minutes_. It\r\nis said also to give a larger weight of butter from the same quantity of\r\nmilk. If the quality be really as good by this quick churning, the\r\nalleged inferiority in the quality of butter churned quickly in the\r\ncommon churn cannot be due to the mere rapidity of churning alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver-churning.\r\n\r\nWhen the process of churning is continued after the full separation of\r\nthe butter, it loses its fine yellowish, waxy appearance, and becomes\r\nsoft and light-colored. The weight of the butter, however, is\r\nconsiderably increased; and hence, in Lancashire, over-churning is\r\nfrequently practised in the manufacture of fresh butter for immediate\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n\r\nTemperature of the Milk or Cream.\r\n\r\nMuch also depends upon the temperature of the milk or cream when the\r\nchurning is commenced. Cream when put into the churn should never be\r\nwarmer than 55 deg. Fahrenheit It rises during the churning from 4 deg. to 10 deg.\r\nF. above its original temperature. When the whole milk is churned, the\r\ntemperature should be raised to 65 deg. F., which is best done by pouring in\r\nhot water into the churn _while the milk is kept in motion_. In winter,\r\neither of these temperatures may be easily attained. In cold weather it\r\nis often necessary to add hot water to the cream to raise it even to\r\n55 deg.. But in summer, and especially in hot weather, it is difficult, even\r\nin cool and well-ordered dairies, (without the use of ice,) to keep the\r\ncream down to this comparatively low temperature. Hence, if the cream be\r\nthen churned, a second-rate butter, at best, is all that can be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alleged advantages of Churning the entire Milk.\r\n\r\nThe proper temperature can be readily obtained both in winter and\r\nsummer. A hundred gallons of entire milk, will give, in summer, five per\r\ncent. more butter than the cream from the same quantity of milk. Butter\r\nof the best quality can be obtained without difficulty, both in winter\r\nand summer. No special attention to circumstances, or change of method,\r\nis at any time required. The churning in winter and summer is alike\r\nsimple and easy. The butter is not only of the best quality while fresh,\r\nbut is also best for long-keeping, when properly cured or salted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCleanliness in all the operations of the Dairy.\r\n\r\nThis is peculiarly necessary to the manufacture of good butter. Cream is\r\nremarkable for the rapidity with which it absorbs and becomes tainted by\r\nany unpleasant odors. It is very necessary that the air of the dairy\r\nshould be sweet, that it should be often renewed, and that it should be\r\nopen in no direction from which bad odors can come. (_Johnston and other\r\nauthorities._)\r\n\r\nThe statement of J. T. Lansing, who received the first premium for\r\nbutter from the New York State Agricultural Society, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Keep the cows stabled through the inclement season_; feed them from\r\nthree to four times per day with good hay or green stalks; when near\r\ncoming in, add some oats, barley, or corn cracked. In summer, good\r\npasture, with living water accessible at all times, and plenty of salt.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of milk and cream before churning._--Strain the milk in tin\r\npans; place them in a cool cellar for the cream to rise. When\r\nsufficiently risen, separate the cream from the milk; put in stone jars,\r\nwell prepared before churning.\r\n\r\n_The mode of churning in summer._--Rinse the churn with cold water; then\r\nturn in the cream, and add to each jar of cream put in the churn, full\r\none-fourth of the same quantity of cold water. The churn used is a\r\npatent one, moved by hand with a crank, having paddles attached, and so\r\nconstructed as to warm the milk (if too cold) with hot water, without\r\nmixing them together. The milk and cream receive the same treatment in\r\nwinter as in summer; and in churning, use hot instead of cold water, if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n_The method of freeing the butter from the milk_, is to wash the butter\r\nwith cold water, till it shows no color of the milk, by the use of a\r\nladle.\r\n\r\n_Salting the butter._--Use the best kind of Liverpool sack-salt; the\r\nquantity varies according to the state in which the butter is taken from\r\nthe churn; if soft, more; if hard, less; always taking the taste for\r\nthe surest guide. Add no saltpetre, nor other substances.\r\n\r\n_The best time for churning_ is the morning, in hot weather, and to keep\r\nthe butter cool till put down.\r\n\r\n_The best mode of preserving butter_, in and through the summer and\r\nwinter, is as follows:--The vessel is a stone jar, clean and sweet. The\r\nmode of putting it down is to put in a churning of butter, and put on\r\nstrong brine; let it remain on until the next churning is ready to put\r\ndown, and so on till the jar is filled; then cover it with fine salt the\r\nsame to remain on till used.\r\n\r\nMr. McWilliams, of Orange county, the celebrity of whose butter is\r\nunsurpassed, thus details his method of butter-making:\r\n\r\n\"Our practice is not to churn the milk until it becomes thick or\r\nloppered, the milk and cream is then churned together. The temperature\r\nof the milk is about fifty degrees. In warm weather about a quart of\r\ncold water is put in each pan before the milk is strained, so as to keep\r\nit sweet as long as possible. The cellar-floor is brick. This in warm\r\nweather is daily cleansed with cold water. A drain from the cellar\r\ncarries off the water thus applied. The churn is filled about half full\r\nwith milk, with the addition of two pails of cold water before starting\r\nthe churn. In cold weather the same quantity of warm water is applied.\r\nWhen the churning is finished, which usually occupies about two hours of\r\ntime, there are then two more pails of cold water applied to raise the\r\nbutter and cool it.\r\n\r\nThe butter is then taken out of the churn and put in a large tray; this\r\nis immediately filled with cold water, and the butter carefully washed;\r\nafter which the water is thrown off. The butter now undergoes the\r\nprocess of salting; it is then placed in a cool situation, where it\r\nstands about an hour, and is worked carefully over. This finished, it is\r\nplaced in the same situation as before, where it stands three or four\r\nhours, and is again worked over; again replaced for five or six hours,\r\nwhen it is worked over for the third time. It is now replaced, where it\r\nstands till the next morning, and worked over for the fourth time. A\r\nsmall quantity of nitre is then put in the butter. Thus finished, it is\r\nplaced in firkins holding about eighty-five pounds.\r\n\r\nPrevious to packing, the firkin is scalded with hot water, rinsed and\r\ncooled with cold water, then rubbed all around with fine salt; this\r\nprevents the butter from adhering to the sides of the firkin. When the\r\nfirkin is full, a linen cloth is placed over the top of the butter; on\r\nthis cloth a covering of salt is put one inch deep, and cold water\r\nenough added to it to form a brine. It then stands till it is to be sent\r\nto market, when the cloth and salt are removed, the firkin turned down,\r\nthe top of the butter in the keg washed with cold water, and the pickle\r\ndrained off. The firkin is now neatly headed up and sent to market.\"\r\n\r\nThe salt added to the butter should be from 1-24th to 1-28th of its\r\nweight, or about two-thirds of an ounce to a pound, and this must be of\r\nthe best quality. All the buttermilk must be thoroughly extracted by\r\nrepeated washings; and when completed, the butter should be immediately\r\npacked, and not a particle of air allowed to come in contact with it\r\ntill opened for the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE.\r\n\r\nThe Circumstances affecting the Quality of Cheese.\r\n\r\n\"All cheese consists essentially of the curd, mixed with a certain\r\nportion of the fatty matter, and of the sugar of milk. But differences\r\nin the quality of the milk, in the proportion in which the several\r\nconstituents of milk are mixed together, or in the general mode of dairy\r\nmanagement, give rise to varieties of cheese almost without number.\r\nNearly every dairy district produces one or more qualities of cheese\r\npeculiar to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural Differences in the Milk\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that whatever gives rise to natural differences in the\r\nquality of the milk, must affect also that of the cheese prepared from\r\nit. If the milk be poor in butter, so must the cheese be. If the pasture\r\nbe such as to give a milk rich in cream, the cheese will partake of the\r\nsame quality. If the herbage or other food affect the taste of the milk\r\nor cream, it will also modify the flavor of the cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk of Different Animals.\r\n\r\nSo the milk of different animals will give cheese of unlike qualities.\r\nThe ewe-milk cheeses of Tuscany, Naples, and Languedoc, and those of\r\ngoats' milk made on Mont Dor and elsewhere, are celebrated for qualities\r\nwhich are not possessed by cheeses prepared from cows' milk in a similar\r\nway. Buffalo milk also gives a cheese of peculiar qualities, which is\r\nmanufactured in some parts of the Neapolitan territory.\"\r\n\r\nOther kinds of cheese are made from mixtures of the milk of different\r\nanimals. Thus the strong-tasted cheese of Lecca and the celebrated\r\nRoquefort cheese are prepared from mixtures of goat with ewe milk, and\r\nthe cheese of Mont Cenis from both of these mixed with the milk of the\r\ncow.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreamed or Uncreamed Milk.\r\n\r\nStill further differences are produced, according to the proportion of\r\ncream which is left in or is added to the milk. Thus, if cream only be\r\nemployed, we have the rich _cream-cheese_ which must be eaten in a\r\ncomparatively recent state. Or, if the cream of the previous night's\r\nmilking be added to the new milk of the morning, we may have such cheese\r\nas the _Stilton_ of England, or the small, soft, and rich _Brie_\r\ncheeses, so much esteemed in France.\r\n\r\nIf the entire milk only be used, we have such cheeses as the _Cheshire_,\r\nthe _Double Gloucester_, the _Cheddar_, the _Wiltshire_, and the\r\n_Dunlop_ cheeses of Britain, the Kinnegad cheese of Ireland, and the\r\nGouda and Edam cheeses of Holland. Even here, however, it makes a\r\ndifference, whether the warm milk from the cow is curdled alone, as at\r\nGouda and Edam, or whether it is mixed with the milk of the evening\r\nbefore, as is generally done in Cheshire and Ayrshire. Many persons are\r\nof opinion that cream, which has once been separated, can never be so\r\nwell mixed again with the milk, that a portion of the fatty matter shall\r\nnot flow out with the whey and render the cheese less rich.\r\n\r\nIf the cream of the evening's milk be removed, and the skimmed milk\r\nadded to the new milk of the next morning, such cheeses as the _Single\r\nGloucester_ are obtained. If the cream be taken once from _all_ the\r\nmilk, the better kinds of skimmed-milk cheese, such as the Dutch cheese\r\nof Leyden, are prepared; while if the milk be twice skimmed, we have the\r\npoorer cheeses of Friesland and Groningen. If skimmed for three or four\r\ndays in succession, we get the hard and horny cheeses of Essex and\r\nSussex, which often require the axe to break them up.\r\n\r\n\r\nButtermilk Cheese.\r\n\r\nBut poor or butterless cheese will also differ in quality according to\r\nthe state of the milk from which it is extracted. If the new milk be\r\nallowed to stand to throw up its cream, and this be then removed in the\r\nusual way, the ordinary skimmed-milk cheese will be obtained by adding\r\nrennet to the milk. But if, instead of skimming, we allow the milk to\r\nstand till it begins to sour, and then remove the butter by churning the\r\nwhole, we obtain the milk in a sour state, (_buttermilk_.) From this\r\nmilk the curd separates naturally by gentle heating. But being thus\r\nprepared from sour milk, and without the use of rennet, buttermilk\r\ncheese differs more or less in quality from that which is made from\r\nsweet skimmed-milk. The acid in the buttermilk, especially after it has\r\nstood a day or two, is capable of coagulating new milk also; and thus,\r\nby mixing more or less sweet milk with the buttermilk before it is\r\nwarmed, several other qualities of mixed butter and sweet-milk cheese\r\nmay readily be manufactured.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhey Cheese.\r\n\r\nThe whey which separates from the curd, and especially the white whey,\r\nwhich is pressed out towards the last, contains a portion of curd, and\r\nnot unfrequently a considerable quantity of butter also. When the whey\r\nis heated, the curd and butter rise to the surface, and are readily\r\nskimmed off. This curd alone will often yield a cheese of excellent\r\nquality, and so rich in butter, that a very good imitation of Stilton\r\ncheese may sometimes be made with alternate layers of new-milk curd and\r\nthis curd of whey.\r\n\r\n\r\nMixtures of Vegetable Substances with the Milk.\r\n\r\nNew varieties of cheese are formed by mixing vegetable substances with\r\nthe curd. A green decoction of two parts of sage leaves, one of\r\nmarigold, and a little parsley, gives its color to the _green cheese_ of\r\nWiltshire; some even mix up the entire leaves with the curd. The\r\ncelebrated Schabzieger cheese of Switzerland, is made by crushing the\r\nskim-milk cheese after it is several months old to fine powder in a\r\nmill, mixing it then with one-tenth of its weight of fine salt, and\r\none-twentieth of the powdered leaves of the mellilot trefoil,\r\n(_trifolium melilotus cerulea_,) and afterwards with oil or butter,\r\nworking the whole into a paste, which is pressed and carefully dried.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato Cheeses,\r\n\r\nAs they are called, are made in various ways. One pound of sour milk is\r\nmixed with five pounds of boiled potatoes and a little salt, and the\r\nwhole is beat into a pulp, which, after standing five or six days, is\r\nworked up again, and then dried in the usual way. Others mix three parts\r\nof dried boiled potatoes with two of fresh curd, or equal weights, or\r\nmore curd than potato, according to the quality required. Such cheeses\r\nare made in Thuringia, in Saxony, and in other parts of Germany. In\r\nSavoy, an excellent cheese is made by mixing one of the pulp of potatoes\r\nwith three of ewe-milk curd; and in Westphalia, a potato cheese is made\r\nwith skimmed milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparation of Rennet.\r\n\r\nRennet is prepared from the salted stomach or intestines of the sucking\r\ncalf, the unweaned lamb, the young kid, or even the young pig. In\r\ngeneral, however, the stomach of the calf is preferred, and there are\r\nvarious ways of curing and preserving it.\r\n\r\nThe stomach of the newly killed animal contains a quantity of curd\r\nderived from the milk on which it has been fed. In most districts, it is\r\nusual to remove by a gentle washing the curd and slimy matters which are\r\npresent in the stomach, as they are supposed to impart a strong taste to\r\nthe cheese. In Cheshire, the curd is frequently salted separately for\r\nimmediate use. In Ayrshire and Limburg, on the other hand, the curd is\r\nalways left in the stomach and salted along with it. Some even give the\r\ncalf a copious draught of milk shortly before it is killed, in order\r\nthat the stomach may contain a larger quantity of the valuable curd.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalting the Stomach.\r\n\r\nIn the mode of salting the stomach, similar differences prevail. Some\r\nmerely put a few handfuls of salt into and around it, then roll it\r\ntogether, and hang it near the chimney to dry. Others salt it in a\r\npickle for a few days, and then hang it up to dry; while others pack\r\nseveral of them in layers, with much salt both within and without, and\r\npreserve them in a cool place, till the cheese-making season of the\r\nfollowing year. They are then taken out, drained from the brine, spread\r\nupon a table, sprinkled with salt which is rolled in with a wooden\r\nroller, and then hung up to dry. In some foreign countries, the recent\r\nstomach is minced very fine, mixed with salt and bread into a paste, put\r\ninto a bladder, and then dried. In Lombardy, the stomach, after being\r\nsalted and dried, is minced and mixed up with salt, pepper, and a little\r\nwhey or water into a paste, which is preserved for use.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way the stomach or intestine of the calf is prepared and\r\npreserved, the almost universal opinion seems to be, that it should be\r\nkept for 10 or 12 months, before it is capable of yielding the best and\r\nstrongest rennet. If newer than 12 months, the rennet is thought to make\r\nthe cheese heave or swell, and become full of eyes or holes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking the Rennet.\r\n\r\nIn making the rennet, different customs also prevail. In some districts,\r\na bit of the dried stomach is put into half a pint of lukewarm water,\r\nwith as much salt as will lie upon a shilling, is allowed to stand over\r\nnight, and in the morning the infusion is poured into the milk. For a\r\ncheese of 60 lbs. weight, a piece of the size of a dollar will often be\r\nsufficient, though of some skins as much as 10 square inches are\r\nrequired to produce the same effect. It is, however, more common to take\r\nthe entire stomach, and to pour upon them from one to three quarts of\r\nwater for each stomach, and to allow them to infuse for several days. If\r\nonly one has been infused, and the rennet is intended for immediate use,\r\nthe infusion requires only to be skimmed and strained. But if several be\r\ninfused, or as many as have been provided for the whole season, about\r\ntwo quarts of water are taken for each, and, after standing not more\r\nthan two days, the infusion is poured off, and is completely saturated\r\nwith salt. During the summer it is constantly skimmed, and fresh salt\r\nadded from time to time. Or a strong brine may at once be poured upon\r\nthe skins, and the infusion, when the skins are taken out, may be kept\r\nfor a length of time. Some even recommend, that the liquid rennet should\r\nnot be used until it is at least two months old. When thus kept,\r\nhowever, it is indispensable that the water should be fully saturated\r\nwith salt.\r\n\r\nIn Ayrshire, and in some other countries, it is customary to cut the\r\ndried stomach into small pieces, and to put it, with a handful or two of\r\nsalt and one or two quarts of water, into a jar, to allow it to stand\r\nfor two or three days, afterwards to pour upon it another pint for a\r\ncouple of days, to mix the two decoctions, and when strained, to bottle\r\nthe whole for future use. In this state it may be kept for many months.\r\n\r\nIn making rennet, some use pure water only, others prefer clear whey,\r\nothers a decoction of leaves, such as those of the sweetbrier, the\r\ndog-rose, and the bramble, or of aromatic herbs and flowers; while\r\nothers again, put in lemons, cloves, mace, or brandy. These various\r\npractices are adopted for the purpose of making the rennet keep better,\r\nof lessening its unpleasant smell, of preventing any unpleasant taste it\r\nmight give to the curd, or finally of directly improving the flavor of\r\nthe cheese. The acidity of the lemon will, no doubt, increase also the\r\ncoagulating power of any rennet to which it may be added.\r\n\r\nThe rennet thus prepared is poured into the milk previously raised to\r\nthe temperature of 90 deg. or 95 deg. F., and is intimately mixed with it. The\r\nquantity which it is necessary to add varies with the quality of the\r\nrennet, from a tablespoonful to half a pint for 30 or 40 gallons of\r\nmilk. The time necessary for the complete fixing of the curd varies also\r\nfrom 15 minutes to an hour or even an hour and a half. The chief causes\r\nof this variation, are the temperature of the milk, and the quality and\r\nquantity of the rennet employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent Qualities of Cheese.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of new or entire milk, when the rennet is added, should\r\nbe raised to about 95 deg. F.; that of skimmed milk need not be quite so\r\nhigh. If the milk be warmer the curd is hard and tough, if colder, it is\r\nsoft and difficult to obtain free from the whey. When the former happens\r\nto be the case, a portion of the first whey that separates may be taken\r\nout into another vessel, allowed to cool, and then poured in again. If\r\nit prove to have been too cold, hot milk or water may be added to it; or\r\na vessel containing hot water may be put into it before the curdling\r\ncommences; or the first portion of whey that separates may be heated and\r\npoured again upon the curd. The quality of the cheese, however, will\r\nalways be more or less affected, when it happens to be necessary to\r\nadopt any of these remedies. To make the best cheese, the true\r\ntemperature should always be attained as nearly as possible, before the\r\nrennet is added.\r\n\r\n\r\nMode in which the Milk is warmed.\r\n\r\nIf, as is the case in some dairies, the milk be warmed in an iron pot\r\nupon the naked fire, great care must be taken that it is not singed or\r\n_fire-fanged_. A very slight inattention may cause this to be the case,\r\nand the taste of the cheese is sure to be more or less affected by it.\r\nIn Cheshire, the milk is put into a large tin pail, which is plunged\r\ninto a boiler of hot water, and frequently stirred till it is raised to\r\nthe proper temperature. In large dairy establishments, however, the\r\nsafest method is to have a pot with a double bottom, consisting of one\r\npot within another, after the manner of a glue-pot; the space between\r\nthe two being filled with water. The fire applied beneath, thus acts\r\nonly upon the water, and can never, by any ordinary neglect, do injury\r\nto the milk. It is desirable in this heating, not to raise the\r\ntemperature higher than is necessary, as a great heat is apt to give an\r\noiliness to the fatty matter of the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time during which the Curd stands.\r\n\r\nThis is also of importance. It should be broken up as soon as the milk\r\nis fully coagulated. The longer it stands after this, the harder and\r\ntougher it will become.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quality of the Rennet.\r\n\r\nThis is of much importance, not only in regard to the certainty of the\r\ncoagulation, but also to the flavor of the cheese. In some parts of\r\nCheshire, it is usual to take a piece of the dried membrane and steep it\r\novernight with a little salt for the ensuing morning's milk. It is thus\r\nsure to be fresh and sweet, if the dried _maw_ be in good preservation.\r\nBut where it is customary to steep several skins at a time, and to\r\nbottle the rennet for after-use, it is very necessary to saturate the\r\nsolution completely with salt, and to season it with spices, in order\r\nthat it may be preserved in a sweet and wholesome state.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quantity of Rennet added.\r\n\r\nThis ought to be regulated as carefully as the temperature of the milk.\r\nToo much renders the curd tough; too little causes the loss of much\r\ntime, and may permit a larger portion of the butter to separate itself\r\nfrom the curd. It is to be expected also, that when rennet is used in\r\ngreat excess, a portion of it will remain in the curd, and will\r\nnaturally affect the kind and rapidity of the changes it afterwards\r\nundergoes. Thus, it is said to cause the cheese to heave or swell out\r\nfrom fermentation. It is probable, also, that it will affect the flavor\r\nwhich the cheese acquires by keeping. Thus it may be, that the agreeable\r\nor unpleasant taste of the cheeses of certain districts or dairies may\r\nbe less due to the quality of the pastures or of the milk itself, than\r\nto the quantity of rennet with which it has there been customary to\r\ncoagulate the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way in which the Rennet is made.\r\n\r\nThis, no less than its state of preservation and the quantity employed,\r\nmay also influence the flavor or other qualities of the cheese. For\r\ninstance, in the manufacture of a celebrated French cheese, that of\r\nEpoisse, the rennet is prepared as follows:--Four fresh calf-skins, with\r\nthe curd they contain, are well washed in water, chopped into small\r\npieces, and digested in a mixture of 5 quarts of brandy with 15 of\r\nwater, adding at the same time 21/2 lbs. of salt, half an ounce of black\r\npepper, and a quarter of an ounce each of cloves and fennel seeds. At\r\nthe end of six weeks, the liquor is filtered and preserved in\r\nwell-corked bottles, while the membrane is put into salt-water to form a\r\nnew portion of rennet. For making rich cheeses, the rennet should always\r\nbe filtered clear.\r\n\r\nOn Mont d'Or, the rennet is made with white wine and vinegar. An ounce\r\nof common salt is dissolved in a mixture of half a pint of vinegar with\r\n21/2 pints of white wine, and in this solution a prepared goat's stomach\r\nor _a piece of dried pig's bladder_ is steeped for a length of time. A\r\nsingle spoonful of this rennet is said to be sufficient for 45 or 50\r\nquarts of milk. No doubt the acid of the vinegar and of the wine aid the\r\ncoagulating power derived from the membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way in which the Curd is treated.\r\n\r\nIt is usual in our best cheese districts, carefully and slowly to\r\nseparate the curd from the whey, not to hasten the separation, lest a\r\nlarger portion of the fatty matter should be squeezed out of the curd,\r\nand the cheese should thus be rendered poorer than usual. But in some\r\nplaces, the practice prevails of washing the curd with hot water, after\r\nthe whey has been partially separated from it. Thus at Gouda in Holland,\r\nafter the greater part of the whey has been gradually removed, a\r\nquantity of hot water is added, and allowed to remain upon it for at\r\nleast a quarter of an hour. The heat makes the cheese more solid and\r\ncauses it to keep better.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the pear-shaped _caccio-cavallo_ cheeses and the round\r\n_palloni_ cheeses of Gravina, in the Neapolitan territory, are made from\r\ncurd, which after being scalded with boiling whey, is cut into slices,\r\nkneaded in boiling water, worked with the hand till it is perfectly\r\ntenacious and elastic, and then made into shapes. The water in which the\r\ncurd is washed, after standing twenty-four hours, throws up much oily\r\nmatter, which is skimmed off and made into butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Separation of the Whey\r\n\r\nIs a part of the process, upon which the quality of the cheese in a\r\nconsiderable degree depends. In Cheshire, more time and attention is\r\ndevoted to the perfect extraction of the whey than in almost any other\r\ndistrict. Indeed, when it is considered that the whey contains sugar and\r\nlactic acid, which may undergo decomposition, and a quantity of rennet\r\nwhich may bring on fermentation, by both of which processes the flavor\r\nof the cheeses must be considerably affected, it will appear of great\r\nimportance that the whey should be as completely removed from the curd\r\nas it can possibly be. To aid in effecting this, a curd-mill, for\r\nchopping it fine after the whey is _strained_ off, is in use in many of\r\nthe large English dairies, and a very ingenious and effectual pneumatic\r\ncheese-press for sucking out the whey, was lately invented.\r\n\r\nBut the way in which the whey is separated is not a matter of\r\nindifference, and has much influence upon the quality of the cheese.\r\nThus, in Norfolk, according to Marshall, when the curd is fairly set,\r\nthe dairy-maid bares her arm, plunges it into the curd, and with the\r\nhelp of her wooden ladle, breaks up minutely, and intimately mixes the\r\ncurd with the whey. This she does for ten or fifteen minutes, after\r\nwhich the curd is allowed to subside, and the whey is drawn off. By this\r\nagitation, the whey must carry off more of the butter and the cheese\r\nmust be poorer.\r\n\r\nIn Cheshire and Ayrshire, the curd is cut with a knife, but is gently\r\nused and slowly pressed till it is dry enough to be chopped fine, and\r\nthus more of the oily matter is retained. On the same principle, in\r\nmaking the Stilton cheese, the curd is not cut or broken at all, but is\r\npressed gently and with care till the whey gradually drains out. Thus\r\nthe butter and the curd remain intermixed, and the rich cheese of\r\nStilton is the result. Thus, while it is of importance that all the whey\r\nshould be extracted from the curd, yet the quickest way may not be the\r\nbest. More time and care must be bestowed in order to effect this\r\nobject, the richer the cheese we wish to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the milk or of the pastures, may often be blamed for the\r\ndeficiencies in the richness or other qualities of cheese, which are in\r\nreality due to slight but material differences in the mode of\r\nmanufacturing it.\r\n\r\n_The kind of salt_ used, is considered by many to have some effect upon\r\nthe taste of the cheese. Thus the cheese of Gerome, in the Vosges, is\r\nsupposed to derive a peculiar taste from the Lorena salt with which it\r\nis cured. In Holland, the efficacy of one kind of salt over another for\r\nthe curing of cheese is generally acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mode in which the Salt is applied.\r\n\r\nIn making the large Cheshire cheeses, the dried curd, for a single\r\ncheese of sixty pounds, is broken down fine and divided into three equal\r\nportions. One of these is mingled with double the quantity of salt added\r\nto the others, and this is so put into the cheese-vat as to form the\r\ncentral part of the cheese. By this precaution, the after-salting on the\r\nsurface is sure to penetrate deep enough to cure effectually the less\r\nsalted parts.\r\n\r\nIn the counties of Gloucester and Somerset the curd is pressed without\r\nsalt, and the cheese, when formed, is made to absorb the whole of the\r\nsalt afterwards through its surface. This is found to answer well with\r\nthe small and thin cheeses made in those counties, but were it adopted\r\nfor the large cheeses of Cheshire and Dunlop, or even for the pine-apple\r\ncheeses of Wiltshire, there can be no doubt that their quality would\r\nfrequently be injured. It may not be impossible to cause salt to\r\npenetrate into the very heart of a large cheese, but it cannot be easy\r\nin this way to salt the whole cheese equally, while the care and\r\nattention required must be greatly increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddition of Cream or Butter to the Curd.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of improving the quality of cheese, is by the addition of\r\ncream or butter to the dried and crumbled curd. Much diligence, however,\r\nis required fully to incorporate these, so that the cheese may be\r\nuniform throughout. Still this practice gives a peculiar character to\r\nthe cheeses of certain districts. In Italy, they make a cheese _after\r\nthe manner of the English_, into which a considerable quantity of butter\r\nis worked; and the _Reckem_ cheese of Belgium is made by adding half an\r\nounce of butter and the yolk of an _egg_, to every pound of pressed\r\ncurd.\r\n\r\n\r\nSize of the Cheese.\r\n\r\nFrom the same milk, it is obvious that cheeses of different sizes, if\r\ntreated in the same way, will, at the end of a given number of months,\r\npossess qualities in a considerable degree different. Hence, without\r\nsupposing any inferiority, either in the milk or in the general mode of\r\ntreatment, the size usually adopted for the cheeses of a particular\r\ndistrict or dairy, may be the cause of a recognised inferiority in some\r\nquality, which it is desirable that they should possess in a high\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Method of Curing.\r\n\r\nThis has very much influence upon the quality of the cheese. The care\r\nwith which they are salted, the warmth of the place in which they are\r\nkept during the first two or three weeks, the temperature and closeness\r\nof the cheese-room in which they are afterwards preserved, the frequency\r\nof turning, of cleaning from mould, and rubbing with butter; all these\r\ncircumstances exercise a remarkable influence upon the after-qualities\r\nof the cheese. Indeed, in very many instances, the high reputation of a\r\nparticular dairy district or dairy farm, is derived from some special\r\nattention to some or to all of these apparently minor points.\r\n\r\nIn Tuscany, the cheeses, after being hung up for some time at a proper\r\ndistance from the fire, are put to ripen in an underground, cool, and\r\ndamp cellar; and the celebrated French cheeses of Roquefort, are\r\nsupposed to owe much of the peculiar estimation in which they are held,\r\nto the cool and uniform temperature of the subterranean caverns in which\r\nthe inhabitants of the village have long been accustomed to preserve\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmmoniacal Cheese.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the mode of curing, is shown very strikingly in the\r\nsmall ammoniacal cheeses of Brie, which are very much esteemed in Paris.\r\nThey are soft unpressed cheeses, which are allowed to ripen in a room,\r\nthe temperature of which is kept between 60 deg. and 70 deg. Fahrenheit, till\r\nthey begin to undergo the putrefactive fermentation, and emit an\r\nammoniacal odor. They are generally unctuous, and sometimes so small as\r\nnot to weigh more than an ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\nInoculating Cheese.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a cheese, possessed of no very striking taste of its\r\nown, may be inoculated with any flavor we approve, by putting into it\r\nwith a scoop a small portion of the cheese which we are desirous that\r\nit should be made to resemble. Of course, this can apply only to cheeses\r\notherwise of equal richness, for we could scarcely expect to give a\r\nGloucester the flavor of a Stilton, by merely patting into it a small\r\nportion of a rich and esteemed Stilton cheese. [_Johnston and various\r\nother authorities._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.\r\n\r\nCheese-Press.]\r\n\r\nFig. 19 is a _self-acting cheese-press_, light yet strong. The cheese\r\nitself gives a pressure of twelve times its own weight; and if this is\r\ninsufficient, additional weight may be added as required.\r\n\r\nThe following statements were made by those receiving premiums from the\r\nNew York State Agricultural Society:\r\n\r\n\"Number of cows kept, eleven. Cheese made from two milkings, in the\r\nEnglish manner; no addition made of cream. For a cheese of twenty\r\npounds, a piece of rennet about two inches square is soaked about twelve\r\nhours in one pint of water. As rennets differ much in quality, enough\r\nshould be used to coagulate the milk _sufficiently_ in about forty\r\nminutes. No salt is put _into_ the cheese, nor any on the outside during\r\nthe first six or eight hours it is pressed; but a thin coat of fine\r\nLiverpool salt is kept on the outside during the remainder of the time\r\nit remains in press. The cheeses are pressed forty-eight hours, under a\r\nweight of seven or eight cwt. Nothing more is required but to turn the\r\ncheeses once a day on the shelves.\"\r\n\r\n\"The milk is strained in large tubs over night; the cream stirred in\r\nmilk, and in the morning strained in same tub; milk heated to natural\r\nheat; add color and rennet; curd broke fine and whey off, and broke fine\r\nin hoop with fast bottom, and put in strainer; pressed twelve hours;\r\nthen taken from hoop, and salt rubbed on the surface; then put in hoop,\r\nwithout strainer, and pressed forty-eight hours; then put on tables, and\r\nsalt rubbed on surface, and remain in salt six days, for cheese weighing\r\nthirty pounds. The hoops to have holes in the bottom; the crushings are\r\nsaved, and set, and churned, to grease the cheese. The above method is\r\nfor making one cheese per day. As in butter-making, the utmost\r\ncleanliness is required in every part of the cheese-making premises.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSHEEP\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the dog, there is no one of the brute creation\r\nwhich exhibits the diversity of size, color, form, covering, and general\r\nappearance, which characterizes the sheep, and none which occupies a\r\nwider range of climate, or subsists on a greater variety of food. In\r\nevery latitude between the equator and the arctic, he ranges over the\r\nsterile mountains, and through the fertile valleys. He feeds on almost\r\nevery species of edible forage, the cultivated grasses, clovers, cereals\r\nand roots; he browses on aromatic and bitter herbs; he crops the leaves\r\nand bark from the stunted forest shrubs, and the pungent, resinous\r\nevergreens. In some parts of Norway and Sweden, when other resources\r\nfail, he subsists on fish or flesh during their long and rigorous\r\nwinters, and if reduced to necessity, he eats his own wool.\r\n\r\nHe is diminutive like the Orkney, or massive like the Teeswater. He is\r\npolicerate or many horned; he has two large or small spiral horns like\r\nthe Merino, or is polled or hornless like the mutton sheep. He has a\r\nlong tail like our own breeds; a broad tail, like many of the eastern;\r\nor a mere button of a tail, like the fat-rumps, discernible only by the\r\ntouch. His coat is sometimes long and coarse, like the Lincolnshire;\r\nshort and hairy, like those of Madagascar; soft and furry, like the\r\nAngola; or fine and spiral, like the silken Saxon. His color, either\r\npure or fancifully mixed, varies from the white or black of our own\r\ncountry, to every shade of brown, dun, buff, blue, and gray, like the\r\nspotted flocks of the Cape of Good Hope and other parts of Africa and\r\nAsia. This wide diversity is the result of long domestication, under\r\nalmost every conceivable variety of condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nUses.\r\n\r\nAmong the antediluvians, sheep were immolated for sacrificial offerings,\r\nand their fleeces probably furnished them with clothing. Since the\r\ndeluge, their flesh has with all nations been used as a favorite food\r\nfor man. By many of the rude, roving nations of the East, they are\r\nemployed in carrying burdens.\r\n\r\nTheir milk is generally used by the uncivilized, and to some extent by\r\nthe refined nations of Europe, not only as a beverage, but for making\r\ninto cheese, butter, and curds. Job refers to its use, as do Isaiah and\r\nother of the Old Testament writers. Most of the Greek and Roman authors\r\ndescribe its general use and manufacture. The ewe's milk scarcely\r\ndiffers in appearance from that of the cow, but is generally thicker,\r\nand yields a pale, yellowish butter, that is always soft and soon\r\nbecomes rancid. Culley remarks, \"the cheese from their milk is\r\nexceedingly pungent, and for that reason is preferred by many to that\r\nfrom the cow.\" In Wales, the milk is mixed with that of the dairy, and\r\nmakes a tart, palatable cheese. We have never seen it appropriated for\r\ndairy purposes in the United States, except by a few Welsh and Highland\r\nemigrants. The sheep is frequently employed in the dairy regions of this\r\ncountry, at the tread-mill or horizontal wheel, to pump the water, churn\r\nthe milk, or perform other light domestic work.\r\n\r\nThe dignity and importance of the shepherd's vocation have ever been\r\nconspicuous. Abel, the supposed twin-brother of the first-born of the\r\nhuman race, was a \"keeper of sheep;\" and from this, it may be fairly\r\ninferred, that there is no animal which has so long been under the\r\nimmediate control of man. Abraham and his descendants, as well as most\r\nof the ancient patriarchs, were shepherds. Job had 14,000 sheep. It is\r\nsaid of Rachel, the favored mother of the Jewish race, \"she came with\r\nher father's sheep, for she kept them.\" The seven daughters of the\r\npriest of Midian, \"came and drew water for their father's flocks.\"\r\nMoses, the statesman and lawgiver, who \"was learned in all the wisdom of\r\nthe Egyptians, kept the flocks of Jethro, his father-in-law;\" and David,\r\nthe future monarch of Israel, the hero, poet, and divine, was a keeper\r\nof sheep. It was to shepherds, while \"abiding in the field, keeping\r\nwatch over their flocks by night,\" that the birth of the Saviour was\r\nannounced. The root of the Hebrew name for sheep, signifies\r\nfruitfulness, abundance, plenty; as indicating the blessings they were\r\ndestined to confer on the human race. With the sacred writers, they were\r\nthe chosen symbol of purity and the gentler virtues; they were the\r\nvictims of propitiatory sacrifices; and finally, they became the type of\r\nredemption to fallen man. These may not be considered accidental\r\nallusions in a book, whose every feature is full of design.\r\n\r\nNor has the sheep been less the subject of eulogy and attention with\r\nprofane writers. Among these, Homer and Hesiod, Virgil and Theocritus,\r\nintroduced them with evident delight in their pastoral themes; while\r\ntheir heroes and demigods, Hercules and Ulysses, AEneas and Numa,\r\ncarefully perpetuated them throughout their regal domains.\r\n\r\nIn modern times, they have commanded the attention of the most\r\nenlightened nations; and their prosperity has in no instance been\r\nindependent of those useful animals, wherever wool and its manufactures\r\nhave been regarded as essential staples. Spain and Portugal, for more\r\nthan two centuries, were the most enterprising nations of Europe, and\r\nduring that period, they excelled in the production and manufacture of\r\nwool. Flanders, for a time, was before England in the perfection of the\r\narts and the enjoyments of life, and _England then sent the little wool\r\nshe raised to that country to be manufactured_. Her politic sovereigns\r\nsoon found this a losing game, and offered large bounties for the\r\nimportation of artists and machinery. By a systematic and thorough\r\ncourse of legislation, which looked to the utmost protection and\r\naugmentation of wool and woollens, she has carried their production\r\nbeyond any thing the world has ever seen. The small islands of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, in addition to the support of their 26,000,000 of\r\npeople, 15,000,000 of cattle, 2,250,000 horses, 18,000,000 swine, and\r\ninnumerable smaller domestic animals, maintain over 40,000,000 sheep,\r\nworth $250,000,000; and besides manufacturing nearly all their fleeces,\r\nannually import nearly an equal amount from abroad. The sumptuary law\r\nfor burying the dead in woollen, still occupies its place in their\r\nstatute book. And beyond all question, England is the leading power of\r\nthe nineteenth century, in the combination of all those qualities which\r\nconstitute national greatness, civilization, and strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES.\r\n\r\nNaturalists have divided the wild sheep into four varieties. The\r\n_Musimon_, (_Ovis Musimon_,) inhabiting Corsica, Sardinia, and other\r\nislands of the Mediterranean, the mountainous parts of Spain and Greece,\r\nand some other regions bordering upon that inland sea, have been\r\nfrequently domesticated and mixed with the long-cultivated breeds.\r\n\r\nThe _Argali_, (_O. Ammon_,) ranges over the steppes, or elevated plains\r\nof Central Asia, northward and eastward to the ocean. They are larger,\r\nmore hardy, and more untameable than the Musimon.\r\n\r\nThe _Rocky Mountain Sheep_, (_O. Montana_,) frequently called the\r\n_Big-horn_ by our western hunters, is found on the prairies west of the\r\nMississippi, and throughout the wild mountainous regions, extending\r\nthrough California and Oregon to the Pacific. They are larger, but in\r\nother respects resemble the Argali, of which they are probably\r\ndescendants, as they could easily cross upon the ice at Behring's\r\nStraits, from the northeastern coast of Asia. Like the Argali, when\r\ncaught young they are easily tamed; but we are not aware that they have\r\never been bred with the domestic sheep. Before the country was overrun\r\nby the white man, they probably inhabited the region bordering on the\r\nMississippi. Father Hennepin, a French Jesuit, who wrote nearly two\r\nhundred years ago, often speaks of meeting with goats in his travels\r\nthrough what is now the territory embraced by Illinois and Wisconsin.\r\nThe wild, clambering propensities of these animals, occupying the giddy\r\nheights far beyond the reach of the traveller, and the outer coating of\r\nhair (supplied underneath, however, with a thick coating of soft wool)\r\ngives to them much of the appearance of that animal. In summer they are\r\ngenerally found single; but when they descend from their isolated, rocky\r\nheights in winter, they are gregarious, marching in flocks under the\r\nguidance of leaders.\r\n\r\nThe _Bearded Sheep of Africa_ (_O. Tragelaphus_) inhabit the mountains\r\nof Barbary and Egypt. They are covered with a soft, reddish hair, and\r\nhave a mane hanging below the neck, and large locks of hair at the\r\nankle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Domesticated Sheep (_O. Aries_)\r\n\r\nEmbraces all the varieties of the subjugated species. Whether they have\r\ndescended from any one of the wild races, is a question yet\r\nundetermined among naturalists; but however this may be, many of the\r\nvarieties apparently differ less from their wild namesakes than from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe _fat-rumped_ and _the broad-tailed sheep_ are much more extensively\r\ndiffused than any other. They occupy nearly all the southeastern part of\r\nEurope, Western and Central Asia, and Northern Africa. They are supposed\r\nto be the varieties which were propagated by the patriarchs and their\r\ndescendants, the Jewish race. This is inferred from various passages in\r\nthe Pentateuch, Exodus xxix. 22; Leviticus iii. 9; viii. 25; ix. 19, and\r\nsome others, where \"the fat and the rump\" are spoken of in connection\r\nwith offerings, in which the fat was always an acceptable ingredient.\r\nDr. Boothroyd renders one of the foregoing passages, \"the large, fat\r\ntail entire, taken clear to the rump.\" It is certain this variety gives\r\nindisputable evidence of remote and continued subjugation. Their long,\r\npendent, drowsy ears, and the highly artificial posterior developments,\r\nare characteristic of no wild or recently-domesticated race.\r\n\r\nThis breed consists of numerous sub-varieties, differing in all their\r\ncharacteristics of size, fleece, color, &c., with quite as many and\r\nmarked shades of distinction as the modern European varieties. In\r\nMadagascar, they are covered with hair; in the south of Africa, with\r\ncoarse wool; in the Levant, and along the Mediterranean, the wool is\r\ncomparatively fine; and from that of the fat-rumped sheep of Thibet the\r\nexquisite Cashmere shawls are manufactured. Both rams and ewes are\r\nsometimes bred with horns, and sometimes without, and they exhibit a\r\ngreat diversity of color. Some yield a carcass of scarcely 30 lbs.,\r\nwhile others have weighed 200 lbs. dressed. The tail or rump varies\r\ngreatly, according to the purity and style of breeding; some are less\r\nthan one-eighth, while others exceed one-third the entire dressed\r\nweight. The fat of the rump or tail is considered a great delicacy, and\r\nin hot climates resembles oil, and in colder, suet.\r\n\r\nThe broad-tailed sheep were brought into this country, about 50 years\r\nsince, by Commodore Barron and Judge Peters, and bred with the native\r\nflocks. They were called the Tunisian mountain sheep. Some of them were\r\nsubsequently distributed by Col. Pickering, of Massachusetts, among the\r\nfarmers of Pennsylvania; and their mixed descendants were highly prized\r\nas prolific and good nurses, coming early to maturity, attaining large\r\nweights, of a superior quality of carcass, and yielding a heavy fleece\r\nof excellent wool. The principal objection brought against them, was\r\nthe difficulty of propagation, which always required the assistance of\r\nthe shepherd. The lambs were dropped white, red, tawny, bluish, or\r\nblack; but all excepting the black, grew white as they approached\r\nmaturity, retaining some spots of the original color on the cheeks and\r\nlegs, and sometimes having the entire head tawny or black. The few which\r\ndescended from those originally imported into this country, have become\r\nblended with American flocks, and are now scarcely distinguishable from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nNative or Common Sheep of the United States.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, there are no sheep indigenous to North America,\r\nexcepting the _Ovis Montana_, or Rocky Mountain sheep. Before the\r\nintroduction of the improved European breeds, during the present\r\ncentury, our sheep were generally a hardy, long-legged, coarse,\r\nopen-fleeced animal, which yielded, according to attention and feed,\r\nfrom 11/2 to 4 lbs. of indifferent wool. We have seen numerous flocks\r\nwithin the last 20 years, of the pure-bred native, whose bellies were\r\nentirely destitute of wool, and sometimes the whole carcass was bare,\r\nexcepting a mere strip or ridge like a mane, reaching from the head to\r\nthe tail. The wool which was retained on the neck, back, and sides, was\r\nfrequently matted almost as firmly as a leather apron; and that on the\r\nthighs, and sometimes on the sides, was often composed almost wholly of\r\nlong hair.\r\n\r\nAlthough indifferently formed in comparison with the best breeds of the\r\npresent day, being thin in the breast and back, light quartered, and\r\nslow in coming to maturity, they yet possessed some good qualities. They\r\nwere prolific, excellent nurses, tallowed well, and yielded good mutton.\r\nThere were, occasionally, some smutty-nosed or brockle-faced sheep among\r\nthem, distinguished by their additional size, superior merits, and\r\ncourage. These were usually the leaders of the flock, in their marauding\r\nexpeditions on their neighbor's domains; and in common with the others,\r\nthey were eminently adapted to purvey for themselves on the frontier\r\nsettlements. There were, besides, some black or dark chocolate-brown\r\nmembers in every flock, which were much valued by the thrifty housewife\r\nfor their wool, which afforded an economical mixture for jackets, hose,\r\nand trousers, known as sheep's gray.\r\n\r\nOur original stock were principally derived from England, where their\r\ncounterparts may be seen at the present day, in the refuse breeds of\r\nthat country. When these sheep were well selected and properly bred,\r\nthere was rapid and satisfactory improvement, and from such flocks,\r\nmixed with some of the more recently improved varieties, have sprung\r\nmany valuable animals.\r\n\r\nThere was but one exception to this general character of the native\r\nflocks, so far as our observation extended, which was a considerably\r\nnumerous, and, probably, accidental variety, known as the _Otter breed_,\r\nor _Creepers_. These were an excessively duck-legged animal, with\r\nwell-formed bodies, full chest, broad backs, yielding a close heavy\r\nfleece of medium quality of wool. They were deserved favorites where\r\nindifferent stone or wood fences existed, as their power of locomotion\r\nwas absolutely limited to their enclosures, if protected by a fence not\r\nless than two feet high. The quality of their mutton was equal, while\r\ntheir aptitude to fatten was decidedly superior to their longer-legged\r\ncontemporaries. They are probably now nearly or quite extinct.\r\n\r\nAn excellent variety was produced by General Washington, from a cross of\r\na Persian ram, upon the Bakewell, which bore wool 14 inches in length,\r\nsoft and silky, and admirably suited to combing. They were called the\r\nArlington sheep, but they have long since become incorporated with the\r\nother flocks of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Merino.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly one of the most ancient race of sheep extant. The\r\nloose descriptions and indefinite generalities of the ancient writers,\r\nleave much to conjecture on this point; yet we have a few passages from\r\nPliny, Columella, and some other Roman authors, which leave little doubt\r\nthat the Merino was bred in their age, and had even been introduced into\r\nItaly from Greece. It is a matter of history, that the Greeks had choice\r\nbreeds of sheep at an early day, which they might have derived from\r\nEgypt, Tyre, and Asia Minor, as they were intimately connected in\r\ncommerce with those countries, where the woollen manufacture early\r\nreached great perfection. It is supposed that the celebrated Argonautic\r\nexpedition, in quest of the golden fleece, undertaken by the Greeks\r\nnearly 1300 years before Christ, resulted in procuring a valuable race\r\nof sheep from Colchis, in the Euxine.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it is certain that when Augustus extended his\r\npeaceful sceptre over half the known world, the Romans were in\r\npossession of some flocks, bearing fleeces of exceeding fineness and\r\nbeauty. They had been reared in the province of Apulia, on the southeast\r\ncoast of Italy, and were called Tarentine, from Tarentum, the capital of\r\nthe province. Here, then, may have been one branch of the Merino family.\r\n\r\nAnother is undoubtedly described by Pliny, who says, \"the _red fleece of\r\nBaetica_ was of still superior quality, _and had no fellow_.\" All the\r\nSpanish coast on the Mediterranean, of which Baetica formed a\r\nconsiderable part, comprising the modern Spanish provinces of Jaen,\r\nCordova, Seville, Andalusia, and Granada, was early colonized by the\r\nenterprising Greeks; and this _red fleece that had no fellow_, was\r\nprobably introduced by them at an early day, and by their descendants\r\nhad been carried to a still higher degree of perfection than that of\r\nApulia. Columella, the uncle of the writer on agriculture, a wealthy\r\nemigrant to Spain from Italy, A. D. 30, carried with him some of the\r\nTarentine sheep, and thus added to the fine-woolled sheep of Spain.\r\nThese two ancient streams, united perhaps with a third from the more\r\nancient stock of the Euxine, (for Strabo asserts that some of the\r\nfinest-woolled sheep were brought from that region in his time, and sold\r\nfor the enormous sum of $750,) flowed on in an uninterrupted current\r\nover that broad country, and brought down to modern times the unrivalled\r\nrace of the Merino. The limited region of Italy, overrun as it\r\nrepeatedly was by hordes of barbarians during and after the times of the\r\nlate emperors, soon lost her pampered flocks; while the extended regions\r\nof Spain, intersected in every direction by almost impassable mountains,\r\ncould maintain their more hardy race, in defiance of revolution or\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nWhatever distrust may be attached to these scraps of history, which\r\napparently establish the remote antiquity of the Merino, this much is\r\nabsolutely certain, that they are a race whose qualities are inbred, to\r\nan extent surpassed by no others. They have been improved in the general\r\nweight and evenness of their fleece, as in the celebrated flock of\r\nRambouillet; in the uniformity and excessive fineness of fibre, as in\r\nthe Saxons; and in their form and feeding qualities, in various\r\ncountries; but there has never yet been deterioration either in quantity\r\nor quality of fleece or carcass, wherever transported, if supplied with\r\nsuitable food and attention. Most sheep annually shed their wool if\r\nunclipped; while the Merino retains its fleece, sometimes for five\r\nyears, when allowed to remain unshorn. This we conceive affords\r\nconclusive evidence of long-continued breeding among themselves, by\r\nwhich the very constitution of the wool-producing organs beneath the\r\nskin have become permanently established; and this property is\r\ntransmitted to a great extent even among the crosses, thus marking them\r\nas an ancient and peculiar race.\r\n\r\nThe conquest by the Moors of a part of those fine provinces in the south\r\nof Spain, so far from checking, served rather to encourage the\r\nproduction of fine wool. They were not only enterprising, but highly\r\nskilled in the useful arts, and carried on extensive manufactories of\r\nfine woollen goods, which they exported to different countries. After\r\ntheir expulsion in the 15th century, by Ferdinand and Isabella, the\r\nSpaniards preserved these manufactures in part, and sedulously cherished\r\ntheir fine flocks; and knowing the incomparible advantage they had in\r\nthem, their sovereigns, except in a few isolated instances, strictly\r\nprohibited their exportation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExportation of Merinoes from Spain.\r\n\r\nHistory asserts that Henry VIII. of England, by permission of Charles\r\nV., imported 3,000 Spanish sheep; but of what kind is not mentioned,\r\nthey having numerous varieties in Spain. If of the true Merino, it will\r\nexplain the superior quality of the English middle-wools, the Ryeland,\r\nSouth Downs, and some others.\r\n\r\nThe first well-authenticated exportation of the Spanish Merino, was made\r\nto Sweden in 1723, by Alstroemer, which solved the problem of their\r\ncapacity for sustaining their character, on rough fare and in a high\r\nnorthern latitude. Lasteyrie, who wrote fifty years after the experiment\r\nhad been tried, speaks of their improvement, both in carcass and the\r\nquality and quantity of fleece.\r\n\r\nThe next exportation was made to Saxony, in 1765, and consisted of 105\r\nrams and 114 ewes, but from what flocks they were taken, history nowhere\r\nmentions. A second exportation to that country was made in 1778, of 110\r\nthat were variously selected, from the best flocks in Spain. From these\r\nhave descended the high-bred, silken-fleeced Saxons, whose wool stands\r\nconfessedly without a rival.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, the Empress Maria Theresa imported 300 Merinoes into Germany,\r\nand placed them on the imperial farm in Hungary. In 1786, an importation\r\nwas made into Denmark and her provinces; and again, in 1797, another\r\nflock of 300 was brought into the kingdom, and placed at Esserum, about\r\neight leagues from Copenhagen. In 1786, 100 rams and 200 ewes were\r\nimported into Prussia, most of which were allowed to perish from neglect\r\nand disease; but their places were fully made up by later importations.\r\nThe same year, 400 ewes and rams were selected from the choicest Spanish\r\nflocks, and placed on the royal farm of Rambouillet, in France, which\r\nlaid the foundation of the celebrated flock which bears that name.\r\n\r\nA small flock of inferior animals was clandestinely procured by George\r\nIII., of England, in 1788, which attracted little attention. In 1791, a\r\nsmall but choice flock was presented to that monarch by the Cortes of\r\nSpain, which soon acquired high favor among many intelligent breeders. A\r\npart of these were kept pure, and their descendants furnished the superb\r\nflock of 700 Nigrettis, which procured for their owner, Mr. Trimmer, in\r\n1829, the gold medal from the London Society of Arts. Others were mixed\r\nwith different flocks in the kingdom, to the evident improvement of\r\ntheir fleeces.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first importation of Merinoes into the United States,\r\n\r\nWhich resulted in the propagation of a pure breed,[2] was made by\r\nChancellor Livingston, then minister at the court of Versailles, who\r\nsent two choice rams and ewes from the Rambouillet flock, in 1802, to\r\nClaremont, his country seat on the Hudson. In the latter part of the\r\nsame year, Col. Humphreys, our minister in Spain, sent out nearly one\r\nhundred Merinoes, which were followed by more numerous flocks from the\r\nsame and other sources. The largest importations of the Merino, however,\r\nwere made through Mr. Jarvis of Vermont, in 1809, then U. S. Consul in\r\nSpain, and immediately thereafter. He first shipped, as he states, \"200\r\nEscurial, afterwards 1400 Paulars, 1700 Aqueirres, 100 Nigrettis, and\r\nabout 200 Montarcos. 2700 Montarcos were sent out by a Spaniard and a\r\nPortuguese, and about 300 Guadaloupes by others; also 200 to 300\r\nPaulars, by Gen. Downie, to Boston. Of the Montarco flock shipped by\r\nothers, about 2500 came to Boston, Providence, New York, and other\r\nports. All were imported in the latter part of 1809 and '10, and early\r\nin 1811, and were the only Leonese Transhumantes, if we include\r\nHumphreys' and Livingston's, (which I have no doubt were of the same\r\nstock,) that were ever shipped to the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[2] One or more pure Merinoes were imported into Massachusetts, in the\r\nlatter part of the last century, by a citizen of that state, but they\r\nwere soon mixed with other flocks, and resulted in the perpetuation of\r\nno distinct breed.\r\n\r\nFig. 20 is a spirited cut of a variety of the Merino without dewlap, and\r\nwith a long and somewhat open fleece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.\r\n\r\nMerino Buck.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVarieties of the Spanish Sheep.\r\n\r\nBesides several other breeds of sheep in Spain, consisting of long,\r\ncoarse wool, and that of a medium staple, embraced under the different\r\nnames of _Chorinoes_, _Choaroes_ or _Chunahs_, the Merino is\r\ndistinguished by two general divisions; the _Transhumantes_ or\r\ntravelling, and the _Estantes_ or stationary flocks. The former are\r\nsubdivided, according to the Provinces they occupy, into Leonese,\r\nSegovian, and Sorian. Many of the Estantes were of the best quality in\r\nrespect to carcass, constitution, and fleece; and such as were highly\r\nbred and in the hands of intelligent breeders, were not surpassed by any\r\nof the Spanish flocks. There were also many choice sheep among the\r\nSegovian and Sorian Transhumantes, but in general they were decidedly\r\ninferior to those of Leon. These last were universally regarded as the\r\nprime flocks of Spain. They comprised the Escurial, the Paular, the\r\nNigretti, the Aqueirres or Muros, the Montarco, the Guadaloupe,\r\nInfantado, and some others.\r\n\r\nThere is much contradictory testimony as to the comparative merits of\r\nthe last-mentioned flocks, as they were found in Spain; which is owing\r\nin part, doubtless, to the difference in the specimens subjected to\r\nexamination. We subjoin some of the most reliable authorities on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nM. Lasteyrie, who investigated this matter closely, says, \"The\r\nGuadaloupe have the most perfect form, and are likewise celebrated for\r\nthe quantity and quality of their wool. The Paular bear much wool of a\r\nfine quality, but they have a more evident enlargement behind the ears,\r\nand a greater degree of _throatiness_, and the lambs have a coarse hairy\r\nappearance, which is succeeded by excellent wool. The lambs of the\r\nInfantado have the same hairy coat when young. The Nigretti are the\r\nlargest and strongest of all the travelling sheep in Spain.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Livingston says, \"The Escurial is the most perfect of all the\r\ntravelling flocks in Spain; the Guadaloupe for form, fineness and\r\nabundance of the fleece; the Paular with similar fleeces are larger\r\nbodied. Those of Castile and Leon have the largest, with the finest\r\ncoat. Those of Soria are small, with very fine wool; and those also of\r\nValencia, which do not travel, and like the last have fine wool, but of\r\na very short staple.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jarvis, who spent many years in Spain, under every advantage for\r\nstudying them closely, and who also imported, and has since bred large\r\nnumbers of them on his estate in Vermont, gives their characteristics\r\nwith more particularity, and at much greater length: \"The Paulars were\r\nundoubtedly one of the handsomest flocks in Spain. They were of middling\r\nheight, round-bodied, well spread, straight on the back, the neck of the\r\nbucks rising in a moderate curve from the withers to the setting on of\r\nthe head, their head handsome, with aquiline curve of the nose, with\r\nshort, fine, glossy hair on the face, and generally hair on the legs,\r\nthe skin pretty smooth, that is, not rolling up or doubling about the\r\nneck and body, as in some other flocks; the crimp in the wool was not so\r\nshort as in many other flocks, the wool was somewhat longer, but it was\r\nclose and compact, and was soft and silky to the touch, and the surface\r\nwas not so much covered with gum. This flock was originally owned by the\r\nCarthusian friars of Paular, who were the best agriculturists in Spain,\r\nand was sold by that order to the Prince of Peace when he came into\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe Nigretti flock were the tallest Merinoes in Spain, but were not\r\nhandsomely formed, being rather flat-sided, roach-back, and the neck\r\ninclining to sink down from the withers; the wool was somewhat shorter\r\nthan the Paular, and more crimped; the skin was more loose and inclined\r\nto double, and many of them were woolled on their faces and legs down to\r\ntheir hoofs. All the loose-skinned sheep had large dewlaps.\r\n\r\nThe Aqueirres were short-legged, round, broad-bodied, with loose skins,\r\nand were more woolled about their faces and legs than any other flock I\r\never saw; the wool was more crimped than the Paular, and less than the\r\nNigretti, but was thick and soft. This flock formerly belonged to the\r\nMoors of Spain, and at their expulsion was bought by the family of\r\nAqueirres. The wool in England was known as the Muros flock, and was\r\nhighly esteemed. All the bucks of these three flocks had large horns.\r\n\r\nThe Escurials were about as tall as the Paulars, but not quite so round\r\nand broad, being in general rather more slight in their make; their wool\r\nwas crimped, but not quite so thick as the Paular or Nigretti, nor were\r\ntheir skins so loose as the Nigretti and Aqueirres, nor had they so much\r\nwool on the face and legs.\r\n\r\nThe Montarco bore a considerable resemblance to the Escurials. The\r\nEscurial flock had formerly belonged to the crown, but when Philip II.\r\nbuilt the Escurial palace, he gave them to the friars, whom he placed in\r\na convent that was attached to the palace, as a source of revenue. These\r\nfour flocks were moderately gummed.\r\n\r\nThe Guadaloupe flock was rather larger in the bone than the two\r\npreceding, about the same height; but not quite so handsomely formed;\r\ntheir wool was thick and crimped, their skins loose and doubling, their\r\nfaces and legs not materially different from the two latter flocks, but\r\nin general they were more gummed than either of the other flocks. In\r\npoint of fineness, there was very little difference between these six\r\nflocks; and as I have been told by well-informed persons, there is very\r\nlittle difference in this respect among the Leonese Transhumantes in\r\ngeneral. The Escurials, the Montarcos, and the Guadaloupes, were not, in\r\ngeneral, so heavy-horned as the other three flocks, and about one in six\r\nof the bucks were without horns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Saxon,\r\n\r\nWe have before seen, is one of the varieties of the pure-bred Merino,\r\nthe foundation of which was laid by an importation of some of the\r\nchoicest animals into Saxony, in 1765. The great care and attention\r\nbestowed upon these sheep by the Elector, the nobility, and the most\r\nintelligent farmers, soon carried them to a point of uniformity and\r\nexcellence of fleece, never exceeded by the best of the original flocks.\r\nThe breeders were selected with almost exclusive reference to the\r\nquality of the fleece. Great care was taken to prevent exposure\r\nthroughout the year, and they were housed on every slight emergency. The\r\nconsequence of this course of breeding and treatment has been to reduce\r\nthe size and weight of fleece, and partially to impair that hardiness\r\nand vigor of constitution, which universally characterized the original\r\nTranshumantes. In numerous instances, this management resulted in\r\npermanent injury to the character of their flocks, which America has\r\nseverely felt in several importations of worthless animals, and which a\r\ntoo great eagerness for improvement induced her flockmasters to use with\r\nthe Spanish Merinoes and their descendants, as a means for this object,\r\nbut which has resulted in the introduction of fatal diseases and serious\r\ndeterioration in their flocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.\r\n\r\nSaxon Ram.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Importation of Saxons into this Country\r\n\r\nWas made in 1823, of four good rams, two of which went to Boston and the\r\nothers to Philadelphia. The next was made the following year, and\r\nconsisted of 75 rams and ewes, which were brought to Boston, and sold at\r\npublic auction, and were afterwards scattered over the country. Another\r\nlot of 180 followed the next year, to the same place, and was sold in\r\nthe same manner, but at an increased price, some selling as high as $450\r\neach.\r\n\r\nThese prices excited the spirit of speculation, and the following year\r\nwitnessed the importation of near 3,000, many of which were decidedly\r\ninferior. These were all thrown upon the market for the most they would\r\ncommand; and in many instances, the sales not half covering the cost of\r\nimportation, the enterprise was abandoned as a speculation, or\r\ncommercial operation.\r\n\r\nThe late Henry D. Grove, of Hoosic, New York, a native of Germany, and a\r\nhighly intelligent and thoroughly bred shepherd, accompanied some of the\r\nbest early importations to this country. He selected 105 choice animals\r\nfor his own breeding, which he imported in 1827, and 70 more equally\r\ngood, in 1828, and with these he formed the flock from which he bred to\r\nthe time of his decease, in 1844.\r\n\r\nThe average weight of fleece from the entire flock of Mr. Grove, nearly\r\nall of which were ewes and lambs, as stated by him to the writer, in\r\n1842, was 2 lbs. 14 ounces, thoroughly washed on the sheep's back. This\r\nwas realized after a short summer and winter's keep, when the quantity\r\nof hay or its equivalent fed to the sheep did not exceed by actual\r\nweight 11/2 lbs. per day, except to the ewes, which received an additional\r\nquantity just before and after lambing. This treatment was attended with\r\nno disease or loss by death, and with an increase of lambs, equalling\r\none for every ewe.\r\n\r\nIn a flock of pure Saxony sheep owned by Mr. Smith of Connecticut, as\r\nstated in a letter from the owner, published in the American Shepherd,\r\n104 ewes raised 101 lambs, and yielded 341 lbs. of wool, which sold at\r\n70 cents per lb. For the 18 months preceding, he lost but three animals\r\nout of 300, from ordinary casualties. But some flocks of pure Saxony do\r\nnot, in good condition, average 2 lbs. per head.\r\n\r\nA recent importation, (May, 1846,) made by Mr. Taintor of Connecticut,\r\nconsisting of four bucks and four ewes, from the celebrated Saxon flock\r\nof Baron de Spreck, show a size and apparent vigor of constitution,\r\nequalling any of their Merino progenitors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nRambouillet Buck.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rambouillet Flock.\r\n\r\nThis flock was founded in 1786, by Louis XVI., from a selection of 400\r\nof the best Spanish sheep, which were placed on the royal farm at\r\nRambouillet. These, like the Saxon, received all the attention which\r\nintelligence and wealth could bestow, and the consequence was soon\r\nmanifest in their larger size, and the increased weight and uniformity\r\nin the fineness of their fleece; the last improvement being particularly\r\nevident, from the absence of the coarse wool, which in many cases\r\ninfested the quarters; and the jarr or hair, which frequently abounds on\r\nthe flanks, legs, and thighs of the original Merino.\r\n\r\nBesides the crown flocks at Rambouillet, they are found in equal\r\nperfection on several other of the royal farms, especially those of\r\nMalmaison, Perpignan, Arles, Clermont, and some others. These flocks\r\nhave been bred for hardy constitution, large carcass, and heavy fleece,\r\nand of as much fineness as is consistent with large weights, and as\r\nuniform in quality throughout, as possible. Mr. Gilbert, who was\r\nparticularly familiar with them, says, \"almost all the fleeces of the\r\nrams, from two years old and upwards, weigh (unwashed) from 12 to 13\r\nlbs.; but the mean weight, taking the rams and the ewes together, has\r\nnot quite attained to 8 lbs., after deducting the tags and the wool of\r\nthe belly.\" The French pound is about one-twelfth heavier than the\r\nEnglish; but from the general custom of folding the sheep in France,\r\nfeeding them in fallows, and wintering them in houses, the fleece\r\nbecomes very dirty. The loss in washing (fit for manufacturing) is about\r\n60 per cent., so that the clean fleece of the ram will average about 6\r\nlbs., and that of the whole flock something under 4 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Importation of the Rambouillets to this Country.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1801, by M. Dellesert, of Paris, for M. Dupont, then in New\r\nYork, and consisted of four choice rams, only one of which, Don Pedro,\r\nreached this country. He was used among the native ewes near Kingston,\r\nN. Y., for three years, and then transferred to Delaware, where he\r\neffected great improvement among the native flocks. The second was that\r\nmade by the late Chancellor Livingston, before alluded to. There was\r\nanother in 1840, by Mr. Collins, of Connecticut, comprising 30 select\r\newes and 2 rams. All these sheep possessed the characteristics peculiar\r\nto the variety as described.\r\n\r\nA still more recent importation has been made by Mr. Taintor, at the\r\nsame time with that of the Saxons previously mentioned, consisting of 23\r\newes and 3 bucks, variously selected from the choicest flocks of the\r\ndescendants of the Spanish Merino. The rams, though young, are the most\r\npromising animals of their breed, and when full grown, will weigh from\r\n225 to 250 lbs. each. The sire of one was sold the past season for $500.\r\nHe sheared 23 lbs. of unwashed wool. The ewes measured after they were\r\nshorn, from 251/2 to 29 inches in height over the withers. The height of\r\nthe under side of their bodies from the ground, was from 91/2 to 12\r\ninches, which is in the proportion of good American Merino sheep. Their\r\nweights varied, after shearing, from 124 to 153 lbs. Some of them were\r\nquite thin in flesh, the largest especially, which, if in fine condition\r\nwith her fleece on, would weigh at least 200 lbs. The following is the\r\nweight of their fleeces unwashed. The scales used did not mark less\r\nthan one-quarter of a pound, which will account for the absence of odd\r\nounces.\r\n\r\n  No.  17        13 lbs.\r\n   \"   27        15  \"\r\n   \"   64        163/4 \"\r\n   \"   71        141/2 \"\r\n   \"   84        161/2 \"\r\n   \"   87        161/4 \"\r\n   \"   94        17  \"\r\n   \"  100        121/4 \"\r\n   \"  109        17  \"\r\n   \"  110        17  \"\r\n   \"  117        163/4 \"\r\n   \"  118        153/4 \"\r\n   \"  133        143/4 \"\r\n   \"  195        131/2 \"\r\n\r\nIt was the unbiased opinion of several wool-dealers present, that the\r\nshearing above would yield at least 35 lbs. of _cleansed_ wool, fitted\r\nfor manufacturing without further loss, out of every 100 lbs. shorn. The\r\nfourteen ewes yielded 216 lbs. unwashed, which would be equivalent to 75\r\nlbs. 10 oz. thoroughly cleansed, or an average of 5 lbs. 6 oz. per head.\r\nOne-third may be safely added to bring this up to _clean washed_. This\r\nwould make the average, as wool-growers usually dispose of their\r\nfleeces, 7 lbs. 3 oz. per head, a yield totally unprecedented in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Progress of the Merino in the United States.\r\n\r\nThough reaching back but half a century, the Merino flocks of this\r\ncountry have been very fluctuating as to their value, increase, and\r\nimprovement. When first introduced, they were viewed with distrust by\r\nthe majority of our farmers; and it was not till after several years'\r\nexperience of their paramount merits, that they were generally\r\ndisseminated. But the confidence of our flock-masters having once been\r\nsecured, it has never been withdrawn, and they have ever since been\r\ncherished favorites. The prices for choice Merinoes rapidly increased\r\nafter their character was fully established, and Livingston states the\r\naverage price for rams, in 1811, at $1,000, and some were sold at a much\r\nhigher rate.\r\n\r\nThis was the period of the embargo, when our infant manufactures were\r\njust starting into life; and being followed by war with the greatest\r\ncommercial nation of the world, we were thrown entirely on our own\r\nresources for the supply of our woollen and other fabrics, and wool and\r\nsheep maintained their full value till after the return of peace, in\r\n1816. The flooding of our country with foreign goods, under low duties,\r\nwhich succeeded this event, either broke down or effectually paralyzed\r\nour woollen manufactures; and wool, of course, felt the full weight of\r\nthis crushing influence. The Merino rapidly declined in value, till its\r\nprice nearly approximated to that of the native sheep. Their merits had,\r\nhowever, become so conspicuous, that the low prices produced a more\r\ngeneral diffusion, and they and their crosses were thus sown broadcast\r\nover the country.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Saxons, in great numbers, in 1826, many of which\r\nwere excessively diminutive and diseased, and their indiscriminate use\r\nwith our pure-bred Merinoes, was a serious interruption to the career of\r\nimprovement in many of our flocks. Their mixture with the best Saxons\r\nwas no further detrimental, than to reduce the quantity of fleece, and,\r\nto a certain extent, lessen the peculiar hardiness of the original\r\nTranshumantes, which had been fully preserved by their descendants in\r\nthis country. The use of well-selected Saxon rams with Merino flocks,\r\nwas extensively practised, and it is still persisted in by many\r\nintelligent flock-masters, after twenty years' experience, who are\r\nsatisfied that they find it for their interest to continue this style of\r\nbreeding. The animals being smaller, consume less; and they probably\r\nproduce a quantity of wool in proportion to their food, which, from its\r\nimproved and uniform quality, commands a higher price in the market.\r\nWherever they are not sufficiently hardy, they can be bred back towards\r\nthe Spanish Merino standard, by the use of some of the stouter rams.\r\nTheir natures are intrinsically the same. They are only divergent\r\nstreams from the same original fountain, and when again united, they\r\nreadily coalesce and flow onwards, without violence or disorder.\r\n\r\nThe Merino, as might reasonably have been anticipated, when properly\r\nmanaged, has improved from a variety of causes. Though kept scrupulously\r\npure in Spain, they were seldom bred with that refinement of taste or\r\nnice judgment, which distinguishes the accomplished modern breeder.\r\nTheir management was too entirely intrusted to ignorant shepherds or\r\ncareless agents, to secure that close attention which is essential to\r\nimprovement. The sheep had to perform a journey of several hundred miles\r\ntwice in a year, to and from their distant Sierras; and it was\r\nabsolutely essential that strong animals should be selected for\r\nbreeding; and to secure this object, those were frequently used which\r\nwere deficient in the most profitable qualities. They were also closely\r\nbred in-and-in, seldom or never departing from a particular flock to\r\nprocure a fresh cross. Their wild, nomadic life, approaching nearly to\r\nthat of their natural state, and their peculiarly healthful pasturage,\r\nalone prevented a serious deterioration from this cause.\r\n\r\nWhen brought into the United States, the flocks were soon mingled with\r\neach other, and for many years past, probably, not an unmixed descendant\r\nof any distinct original flock could be traced. Abundance of appropriate\r\nfood has been given them, without the labor of long and fatiguing\r\njourneys; and lastly, there has been much care used in the selection of\r\nthe most profitable animals for breed. The spirit of improvement has\r\nbeen recently awakened to this important branch of American husbandry,\r\nand as we already have all the elements within ourselves for its\r\nattainment, if not arrested by any untoward national policy, it will\r\nsoon result in giving us numerous flocks of as choice sheep as the world\r\naffords.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeculiarities of the Merino.\r\n\r\nThe prominent peculiarities of the Merino, are the abundance and\r\nfineness of its fleece; the tenacity with which it is held; its crimped\r\nor spiral form; its felting properties; and the excessive quantity of\r\nyolk, giving to it that softness which distinguishes it from all others.\r\nTheir large horns are common to several other varieties. Their hoofs are\r\nsometimes singularly long, reaching 8 or 10 inches when allowed to grow.\r\nThe horns, hoofs, and wool scarcely differ in their chemical\r\nconstituents; and the peculiar development of the two former, is justly\r\nconsidered as an additional evidence of their wool-bearing properties.\r\n\r\nThe yolk, in most of the sheep, forms, with the dust which adheres to\r\nit, a firm crust on the exterior, and together with the compactness of\r\nthe fleece, it offers considerable resistance to the open hand on being\r\npressed, giving the impression of rigidity. This outer covering repels\r\nthe rain, the snow, and the wind like a coat of mail, thus fitting the\r\nMerino to endure exposure beyond any other sheep. On opening the crust,\r\nthe wool is found of a brilliant, golden hue, sparkling with yolk, and\r\nfirmly held together in masses, hardly distinguishable from the cocoon\r\nof the silk-worm. The wool closely covers every part of the body, and\r\nfrequently the entire legs and head, excepting a part of the face. Still\r\nanother peculiarity of the Merino is its longevity. They attain a great\r\nage when properly managed, and, in healthy localities, sometimes breed\r\ntill 20 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe Merino may be described, generally, as a small-boned, closely made,\r\nmedium-sized sheep, varying from 80 lbs. of live weight, for a small\r\newe, to 160 lbs. for good-sized wethers and rams, in ordinary condition.\r\nThey are light in the shoulders and chest, and altogether are more\r\ndeficient in form than the best mutton sheep. This apparent difference\r\nis materially lessened when both are denuded of their fleece; as the\r\nlonger pile of the latter covers defects, which would manifest\r\nthemselves under the closer covering of the Merino. Yet, with this\r\nseeming deficiency, Young found, in feeding the Merino and Bakewell,\r\nthat the latter ate the most, and gained the least, in the ratio of two\r\nto three. We give the statement as we find it, though it apparently\r\ncontravenes a fundamental principle, which a knowledge of all the\r\ncircumstances of the trial, the peculiarities of the particular animals,\r\n&c., might probably explain satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe mutton is excellent, and it is probably not surpassed by that of any\r\nother sheep. Lord Somerville claims it as a rule, that the quality of\r\nthe flesh in each class of sheep follows that of the wool, and that the\r\nflesh of the short and fine-woolled sheep is closer in the grain and\r\nmore highly flavored than the long-woolled. Sir Joseph Banks says, the\r\nLondon butchers, after having some of the Merinoes, eagerly sought for\r\nmore, from its popularity with their best customers; and it is certain\r\nthat the flavor of our mountain-fed Merino does not suffer in comparison\r\nwith the choicest breeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding Merinoes.\r\n\r\nThe general principles of breeding cattle and sheep, as laid down by the\r\nmost approved authorities, must be taken with some exceptions, when\r\napplied to the Merino. Good form and feeding qualities are desirable in\r\nthis breed, but they are not as essential as with the others. _Wool_ is\r\nthe great object, and if this be sufficiently fine, even, and abundant,\r\nsomething may be abated in the perfection of form. Early maturity, so\r\nmuch sought after in the mutton sheep, cannot be reconciled with the\r\ngreat longevity, and the prolonged productive powers of the Merino. We\r\nmust content ourselves, therefore, with slowly engrafting such\r\nimprovements on the breed, as can be effected without prejudice to his\r\nother good qualities, and look to his crosses with others for such\r\nqualities as are irreconcilable with his nature.\r\n\r\nIt is considered indispensable to the improvement of the Merino, that it\r\nbe not bred too young. A vigorous ewe may bring her first lamb at two\r\nyears old, but it is better that it be deferred till three. The ram\r\nshould never be used till his second year, and then but sparingly. From\r\n21/2 to 6 years old is deemed the most vigorous age, though many may be\r\nsafely used till 8 or 10, and occasionally later. Both ewes and rams\r\nhave been known to breed till 20 years old.\r\n\r\nThe _ram_ should be large, stout, and well made, carrying his weight as\r\ncompactly as possible. The nose should be convex; the face covered with\r\na soft velvety hair; the eye lively and prominent; the veins near the\r\nlachrymal glands, of a clear red; the horns rough; short neck; pendent\r\ndewlap not objectionable; full chest; broad shoulders; broad, level\r\nback; large quarters; tail large and well set up; good legs, and sound\r\nhoofs; with a firm, easy, regular gait; the head carried high, with a\r\nlook of boldness and decision, without in any degree approaching to\r\nwildness or ferocity.\r\n\r\nThe _ewe_ should possess these characteristics generally, with such\r\nmodifications as are suited to the sex. Great care should be taken to\r\nbreed from such as are most perfect in all the essential points of\r\nconstitution, form, and size; and weight, uniformity, and fineness of\r\nfleece. The closest observation is requisite, to select the best in all\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nIn-and-in breeding should be avoided where practicable, which can be\r\ndone where there is a careful registry of the sheep through successive\r\ngenerations. Excessive use of rams can never be permitted without\r\ndecided injury to them and their progeny. In Spain, four rams are\r\nsupplied to every hundred ewes. This limited number is proper enough,\r\nwhere they undergo so much fatigue in travelling, and kept too, as they\r\nare, entirely on grass. But if moderately grained before and during\r\ntheir use, and especially if kept up, and allowed to serve the ewes once\r\nonly, as they come in heat, this number may be largely increased. A\r\nvigorous ram will suffice for 35 to 40 ewes, when running with the\r\nflock; yet his powers would not be more taxed by double or even treble\r\nthis number, if admitted to each but once. Bread is a convenient food\r\nfor the ram while running with the sheep. If he is gentle, which he\r\nshould always be, he will come up readily and eat from the hand, without\r\nexciting the attention of the other sheep, which crowd, and not\r\nunfrequently injure each other when grain is placed before him; or he\r\nmay be stabled at night and fed with grain.\r\n\r\nIf young ewes have stolen lambs, they should be taken away immediately\r\nafter yeaning, and the nourishment supplied to the lamb from the milk\r\nof a cow. The tax of nursing is nearly equal to that of gestation, and\r\nfarther injury to the dam may be avoided by this practice. Merino ewes\r\nhave had the reputation of being indifferent nurses in Spain. This is\r\nowing to their fatigue in travelling, and scanty pasturage, rather than\r\nto any constitutional deficiency. It is a frequent practice there, to\r\nkill a part of the lambs, and put one on to two ewes. This has never\r\nbeen found necessary in the countries where they have been transplanted,\r\nas generous feed for the dams has invariably been found entirely\r\nadequate to their support of the young.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe localities in which Merino Sheep can be profitably kept in the\r\nUnited States,\r\n\r\nAre wherever the pastures are sweet and dry; the climate not excessively\r\nhot; and the land not too valuable for other purposes. Wool is generally\r\nthe great object in the sheep husbandry of this country, and when sheep\r\nfarms are remote from the large markets, the Merino will make much the\r\nmost profitable returns. In the neighborhood of cities, where large and\r\nfat sheep and early lambs bear a high price, the mutton sheep may be\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe South Down.\r\n\r\nThis valuable sheep has been known and bred for a long time on the\r\nchalky downs of England, where it has always maintained the character of\r\na hardy animal, yielding a medium quality of wool, and furnishing mutton\r\nof a superior flavor. It was not, however, till within the last 70\r\nyears, that any considerable attention was devoted to its improvement.\r\nSince that period, its fine points have been remarkably developed, which\r\nis shown in its improved size and form, and its early maturity and\r\nproductiveness. The late Mr. John Ellman, of England, was the first who\r\ntook them thoroughly in hand; and so eminent was his success, that he\r\nfounded a flock which has been the source whence all the best blood has\r\nbeen since derived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.\r\n\r\nSouth Down Buck.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe form and characteristics of the South Downs.\r\n\r\nHis criteria of a good South Down, are as follows:--\"The head small and\r\nhornless; the face speckled or gray, and neither too long nor too short.\r\nThe lips thin, and the space between the nose and the eyes narrow. The\r\nunder jaw, or chap, fine and thin; the ears tolerably wide, and well\r\ncovered with wool, and the forehead also, and the whole space between\r\nthe ears well protected by it, as a defence against the fly. The eye\r\nfull and bright, but not prominent. The orbits of the eye--the eye-cap,\r\nor bone,--not too projecting, that it may not form a fatal obstacle in\r\nlambing. The neck of a medium length, thin towards the head, but\r\nenlarging towards the shoulders, where it should be broad and high, and\r\nstraight in its whole course above and below. The breast should be wide,\r\ndeep, and projecting forwards between the fore-legs, indicating a good\r\nconstitution, and a disposition to thrive. Corresponding with this, the\r\nshoulders should be on a level with the back, and not too wide above;\r\nthey should bow outward from the top to the breast, indicating a\r\nspringing rib beneath, and leaving room for it. The ribs coming out\r\nhorizontally from the spine, and extending far backward, and the last\r\nrib projecting more than the others; the back flat from the shoulders\r\nto the setting on of the tail; the loin broad and flat; the rump long\r\nand broad, and the tail set on high and nearly on a level with the\r\nspine. The hips wide; the space between them and the last rib on either\r\nside as narrow as possible, and the ribs, generally, presenting a\r\ncircular form like a barrel. The belly as straight as the back. The legs\r\nneither too long nor too short. The fore-legs straight from the breast\r\nto the foot; not bending inward at the knee, and standing far apart both\r\nbefore and behind; the hocks having a direction rather outward, and the\r\ntwist, or the meeting of the thighs behind, being particularly full; the\r\nbones fine, yet having no appearance of weakness, and of a speckled or\r\ndark color. The belly well defended with wool, and the wool coming down\r\nbefore and behind to the knee, and to the hock; the wool short, close,\r\ncurled, and fine, and free from spiry projecting fibres.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.\r\n\r\nSouth Down Ewe.]\r\n\r\nOther breeders have commenced where Ellman left off, and have apparently\r\npushed their improvement to its utmost capacity; and especially has this\r\nbeen done by Messrs. Grantham and Webb, the latter of whom, while\r\npreserving all the essential merits of the sheep, has carried the live\r\nweight of breeding rams to 250 lbs., and well-fattened wethers to 200\r\nlbs. dressed weight. Many of the choicest animals have been imported\r\ninto this country, and they are now to be found, in limited numbers, in\r\nalmost every state of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe wool was formerly short, and used only for cloths, flannels, &c. It\r\nhas been considerably lengthened in many of the late flocks, and with\r\nthe improvements in the combing machinery, is now much used in England\r\nas a combing wool. The quantity produced is nearly equal to that of the\r\nMerino flocks when well kept, varying, according to the size and style\r\nof breeding, from 3 to 4 lbs. of clean washed wool, which in quality\r\ndoes not differ materially from half-blood Merino, and sometimes rather\r\nexceeds it. The larger animals, of course, produce fleeces of much\r\ngreater weight, sometimes reaching to 8 or 9 lbs. The South Down will\r\nsubsist on short pasture, but well repays full feeding. It attains early\r\nmaturity, is hardy and prolific, frequently producing two at a birth.\r\nLike all highly-improved English breeds, it is not a long-lived sheep.\r\nIt may be considered in its prime at three. The wethers may be fattened\r\nat 18 to 30 months, and the ewes at 3 to 5 years, when first required as\r\nbreeders. The last are sometimes allowed to come in with a lamb at a\r\nyear, but they cannot be sustained in vigor if put to breeding before\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cheviot\r\n\r\nIs thus described by Blacklock: \"They have a bare head, with a long jaw\r\nand white face, but no horns. Sometimes they have a shade of gray upon\r\nthe nose, approaching to dark at the tip; at others, a tinge of lemon\r\ncolor on the face, but these markings scarcely affect their value. The\r\nlegs are clean, long, and small-boned, and covered with wool to the\r\nhough, but there is a sad want of depth at the breast, and of breadth\r\nboth there and on the chine. A fat carcass weighs from 12 lbs. to 18\r\nlbs. per quarter, and a medium fleece about 3 lbs. The purest specimens\r\nof this breed are to be found on the Scotch side of the Cheviot hills,\r\nand on the high and stony mountain farms which lie between that range\r\nand the sources of the Teviot. These sheep are a capital mountain stock,\r\nprovided the pasture resembles the Cheviot hills, in containing a good\r\nproportion of rich herbage.\"\r\n\r\nThey are eminently adapted to high lands and a severe climate, though\r\nless so than the Black-faced or Heath sheep of Scotland. They have\r\nbecome an American sheep, by their repeated introduction into this\r\ncountry. A late importation of several choice sheep was made by Mr.\r\nCarmichael of New York. The wool on these is from 5 to 7 inches long,\r\ncoarse, but well suited to combing. Like the Downs, it has heretofore\r\nbeen classed among the middle-wools, but these specimens would seem to\r\nindicate that they are verging towards the long-wools.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bakewell or Leicester, the Cotswold and Lincolnshire,\r\n\r\nPossess several qualities in common, and it is only a practiced eye that\r\ncan readily detect the difference. This resemblance arises from a\r\nrecent, common origin. They are all large and hornless; of a pure white;\r\nwith long, coarse, and heavy fleeces; excellent mutton sheep; coming\r\nearly to maturity, and capable of carrying enormous quantities of fat.\r\nThere have been from time immemorial numerous flocks of these large,\r\ncoarse-woolled sheep, existing in certain parts of England, under a\r\nvariety of names, and partaking of some slight peculiarity of features,\r\naccording to the district in which they are bred. Thus, besides those\r\nabove-mentioned, there were the Teeswater, the Romney-Marsh, the\r\nKentish, the Bampton, the Exmoor, &c., all of which were deficient in\r\nform, slow-feeders, and late in coming to maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\nImprovement of the Long-Wools.\r\n\r\nThe late Robert Bakewell first commenced a decided improvement with the\r\nLeicesters, nearly a century since. He began by selecting the choicest\r\nsheep in England, which possessed the essential qualities; and by\r\njudicious feeding and management throughout, he soon brought them up to\r\na character widely differing from the original with which he started. So\r\neminent was his success, that in 1787 he let three rams, for a single\r\nseason, for 1250 pounds, (about $6,200,) and was offered 1050 pounds\r\n(about $5,200) for 20 ewes. Soon after this, he received the enormous\r\nprice of 800 guineas, or $4,000, for the use of two-thirds of a ram for\r\none season, reserving the other third for himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.\r\n\r\nLong-wool Buck.]\r\n\r\nHe reduced the bone and offal or worthless parts of the carcass, and\r\nincreased the weight of the valuable parts, and especially their\r\ntendency to fatten and early maturity. This was effected mainly by a\r\nnice discrimination, which has probably never been surpassed, if it has\r\never been equalled. He selected medium sizes for the breed, with as much\r\nevenness and perfection of form as possible, for he found that\r\nexcellence and profitable feeding qualities were seldom connected with\r\nextra size, large bones, or imperfect form. He also observed the\r\ndisposition to fatten in individuals, and used only such as were\r\nconspicuous in this respect. He relied more than all upon their quality\r\nof _handling_ well, depending even more upon the elastic, mellow touch,\r\nthan upon the most symmetrical figure. He used only the choicest rams, a\r\nlittle under size, while the ewes were of full medium weight. The\r\nprogeny were pushed with a full supply of nutritious food, and\r\nsystematically brought to early maturity.\r\n\r\nConnected with this, was his practice of _in-and-in breeding_, or\r\nbreeding the parent upon the progeny, for several successive\r\ngenerations, which had the tendency still further to refine the bone and\r\noffal, and impress most effectually the desirable characteristics of the\r\nrace. It is even credibly asserted, that he produced rot in such of his\r\nfattening sheep as he wished to mature early for the shambles, as in the\r\nfirst stages of that loathsome disease the fat-secreting organs\r\naccomplish their office more rapidly than in a state of perfect health;\r\nand it at least secured them against breeding when they left his own\r\nhands. It is certain, that Bakewell carried his refining system to such\r\nan extent, as partially to destroy the procreative powers; and he was\r\nsubsequently obliged to introduce new animals, to reinvigorate and\r\ncontinue his flock.\r\n\r\nThe general system of Bakewell, however, was attended with complete\r\nsuccess. He produced a race of animals, not only far beyond what England\r\nhad ever before seen, but which, in all the qualities he endeavored to\r\nestablish, have not been since exceeded; and his _improved Leicesters_\r\nhave come down to the present day as perfect as he left them, showing\r\nconclusively, that he not only formed, but stamped the peculiarities of\r\nthe breed, with a permanence which yet bears witness to his genius. One\r\nof these attained the enormous live weight of 368 lbs., and dressed 248\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cotswold and Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nOther breeders were not slow in following in Bakewell's footsteps with\r\ndifferent breeds, and the Cotswold and Lincolnshire especially, have\r\nbecome the subjects of an equally decided improvement, while the errors\r\nof Bakewell were entirely avoided. They possess a rather more desirable\r\nrobustness, approaching, in some few specimens, almost to coarseness, as\r\ncompared with the finest Leicesters; but they are more hardy and less\r\nliable to disease. They attain as large a size, and yield as great an\r\namount of wool, of about the same value. These breeds scarcely differ\r\nmore from each other, than do flocks of a similar variety, which have\r\nbeen separately bred for several generations. They are prolific, and\r\nwhen well fed, the ewes will frequently produce two lambs at a birth,\r\nfor which they provide liberally from their udder till the time for\r\nweaning. The weight of the fleece varies from 4 to 8 lbs. per head.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeculiarity of long Wool and its Uses.\r\n\r\nThe striking peculiarity of the long-wools, is in the production of a\r\nfleece, which is perfectly adapted, by its length and the absence of the\r\nfelting property, to the manufacture of worsted stuffs, bombazines,\r\nmousseline de laines, &c. This is a branch of manufactures, for which we\r\nhad little material that was suitable, till the introduction of the\r\nlong-wools; and its rapid extension in the United States, within the\r\npast few years, clearly shows that a large and increasing demand for\r\nthis kind of wool will continue at remunerating prices. Besides its uses\r\nfor combing, it is extensively manufactured into blankets, carpeting,\r\nand many other fabrics.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportation of Long-Wools.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Bakewells were imported during the last century; and many\r\nflocks, containing some of the best specimens, have been introduced and\r\nscattered over every section of the country. The largest of any single\r\nimportation of the long-wools, was made by Messrs. Corning & Sotham, in\r\n1842, and immediately preceding, and consisted of 70 or 80 choice\r\nCotswolds.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding the Long-Wools.\r\n\r\nSome information on this subject will be found under the head of\r\n_breeding Merinoes_, and _improvement of the Long-Wools_. The ram and\r\newe should be selected from the best specimens of the breed which is to\r\nbe perpetuated. There are peculiarities of form or appearance in each,\r\nwhich should be carefully observed. A _violent cross_ should never be\r\npermitted for the purpose of perpetuation, as suggested under the head\r\nof _principles of breeding_, in a previous chapter; such as between\r\nthose possessing totally opposite properties, as the Merino and\r\nlong-wools; and there is no conceivable advantage in mixing the\r\nmiddle-wools, South Downs, &c., with either.\r\n\r\nLord Western has long experimented on the blending of the Merino and\r\nlong-wools, through several generations, without any well-defined\r\nresults, nor is it believed to be attainable. There is no evenness or\r\nintegrity of character, either in the animal or fleece, from such\r\nmixtures; nor is it possible to foretel the character of progeny from\r\nthese bastard crosses. The general rule, that like begets like, will not\r\nhold true here, for the animal comes large or small, with a long or\r\nshort fleece, fine or coarse, or intermixed; and this, too, is repeated\r\nthrough numerous generations, when the immediate parents exhibit\r\nproperties altogether unlike the offspring, and which they derive from\r\nsome remote ancestry. This practice will do to produce lambs for the\r\nbutcher, as the consequence of a fresh cross is greater stamina and\r\nthrift; and it is found that lambs thus bred attain an early and full\r\ndevelopment. Thousands of such are annually bred on the banks of the\r\nHudson, Long Island, and around our large cities, and in the worst\r\npossible way, as the large, coarse ram is used on the delicate Saxon\r\newe; yet the lambs thrive and command a good price in the market, and\r\nthe owner is satisfied to pocket the result. But nothing could be more\r\nabsurd than to propagate from such progeny for any other purpose than to\r\nmake early and profitable mutton.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of breeds of similar character, is attended with the best\r\nconsequences. Such was the intermingling of the improved Leicesters with\r\nthe Cotswold and Lincolnshire, by which their former coarseness was\r\nremoved; and such was the use of the latter with the Leicesters, when\r\nthey became impotent and almost worthless, from over-refinement in\r\nbreeding. Good results have followed the mixture of the South and\r\nHampshire Downs. A marked improvement in the Merino in this country, has\r\nbeen claimed by Mr. Jarvis and several others, from the mixture of the\r\nvarious flocks, which for ages had been kept distinct in Spain; and the\r\nsame result is known to have followed a similar course with the\r\nRambouillet and Saxon flocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ewe goes with young\r\n\r\nAbout five months, varying from 145 to 162 days. Each flock-master will\r\nof course determine what is the proper lambing time. For early market,\r\nor when there are few sheep, and those well looked after, the lambs may\r\ncome while the ewes are in the yards, and provision can be made for\r\nthem, by placing such as are heavy in warm stalls. Both the dam and\r\nyoung thus receive a closer attention than they would in the field; and\r\nafter a week's housing, in severe weather, the lamb may be turned out\r\ninto the dry yard, where he will suffer no more, apparently, than the\r\nfull-grown sheep.\r\n\r\nBut with large flocks, early lambing is attended with much trouble, and\r\nit is generally avoided, by deferring it till the weather has become\r\nmore settled, and a full bite of grass will afford the dam a plentiful\r\nsupply of milk. Yet in this case, the young sheep must daily be under\r\nthe eye of the shepherd, who should see that they are well supplied with\r\nfood, and especially that they are brought under cover, in severe or\r\nstormy weather.\r\n\r\n_A ram will serve_ from 20 to 100 ewes in a season, according to his\r\nage, health, feed, and management. A South Down or long-woolled lamb, of\r\n7 or 8 months, is sometimes used; and when this is done, he should be\r\nwell fed, and allowed to run only with a very few ewes. If full-grown\r\nrams are turned into a lean pasture to remain with the ewes, not less\r\nthan four should be put in for every hundred. But if a well-fed ram, in\r\nfull health and vigor, is kept up, and led out to the ewe as she comes\r\ninto heat, and allowed to serve her once only, he will suffice for one\r\nhundred, without injury to himself or progeny. For this purpose, the ram\r\nshould be prepared, not by being fat, for this, neither he nor the ewe\r\nshould ever be; but by being fed with grain for a short time before, and\r\nduring the continuance of the season. The ewes are more likely to come\r\nquickly into heat, and prove prolific, if lightly fed with stimulating\r\nfood at the time.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonably enough conjectured, that if procreation, and the first\r\nperiod of gestation, takes place in cold weather, the f[oe]tus will\r\nsubsequently be fitted for the climate, which rules during the early\r\nstages of its existence. If this be so, and it is certainly in\r\naccordance with the laws of nature, fine-woolled sheep are most likely\r\nto maintain their excellence, by deferring the connection of the male\r\ntill the commencement of cold weather; and in the Northern states, this\r\nis done about the first of December, which brings the yeaning time in\r\nthe last of April or first of May, when the early grass will afford a\r\nlarge supply and good quality of feed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter Management and Food.\r\n\r\nSheep should be brought into winter-quarters soon after the severe\r\nfrosts occur, as these diminish the feed, and materially impair its\r\nnutritious qualities. They ought also to be removed from the\r\ngrass-lands, before they become permanently softened by the rains, as\r\nthey will injuriously affect their comfort and health; and allowing them\r\nto remain is equally objectionable, from their poaching the sod. If the\r\nnumber be large when brought to the yards, they must be divided into\r\nflocks of 50 to 100, according to the size of the yards and sheds. The\r\nyoung and feeble ought to be separated from the others, and the ailing\r\nones placed by themselves; and that no one may suffer from the others,\r\nall should be classed as uniformly as possible as to strength. The yards\r\nmust be dry, well supplied with a trough of fresh water, and with\r\ncomfortable sheds, to which they can retire when they choose.\r\n\r\n\r\nShelters.\r\n\r\nThese, in northern climates, are indispensable to profitable\r\nsheep-raising, and in every latitude north of the Gulf of Mexico they\r\nwould be advantageous. There is policy as well as humanity in the\r\npractice. An animal eats much less when thus protected; he is more\r\nthrifty, less liable to disease, and his manure is richer and more\r\nabundant. The feeding may be done in the open yard in clear weather, and\r\nunder cover in severe storms. The shelters for sheep are variously\r\nconstructed, to suit the taste or circumstances of the flock-master. A\r\nsheep-barn, built upon a side hill, will afford two floors; one\r\nunderneath, surrounded by three sides of wall, should open to the south,\r\nwith sliding or swinging doors to guard against storms; and another may\r\nbe provided above, if the floors are perfectly tight, with proper\r\ngutters to carry off the urine; and sufficient storage for the fodder\r\ncan be furnished by scaffolds overhead. Or they may be constructed with\r\ntwelve or fifteen feet posts on level ground, allowing the sheep to\r\noccupy the lower part, with the fodder stored above.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, however, _thorough ventilation should be provided_, for of\r\nthe two evils of exposure to cold or too great privation of air, the\r\nformer is to be preferred. Sheep cannot long endure close confinement\r\nwithout injury. In all ordinary weather, a shed closely boarded on three\r\nsides, with a tight roof, is sufficient protection; especially, if the\r\nopen side is shielded from bleak winds, or leads into a well-enclosed\r\nyard. If the floors above are used for storage, they should be made\r\ntight, that no hay, chaff, or dust can fall upon the fleece.\r\n\r\n\r\nRacks or Mangers.\r\n\r\nThese are indispensable to economical feeding. If the hay is fed on the\r\nground, the leaves and seeds, the most valuable part of the fodder, are\r\nalmost wholly lost; and when wet, the sheep, in their restlessness while\r\nfeeding, will tread much of it into the mud. To make an economical box\r\nor rack, take six light pieces of scantling, say three inches square,\r\none for each corner, and one for the centre of each side. Boards of pine\r\nor hemlock, 12 or 15 feet long and 12 or 14 inches wide, may then be\r\nnailed on to the bottom of the posts for the sides, which are separated\r\nby similar boards at the ends, 21/2 feet long. Boards 12 inches wide,\r\nraised above the lower ones by a space of 9 to 12 inches, are nailed on\r\nthe sides and ends, which completes the rack. The edges of the opening\r\nshould be made perfectly smooth, to prevent chafing or tearing out the\r\nwool. The largest dimensions above given, are suitable for the large\r\nbreeds, and the smallest for the Saxon, and still smaller are proper for\r\ntheir lambs. These should be set on dry ground, or under the sheds, and\r\nthey can easily be removed wherever necessary.\r\n\r\nSome prefer the racks made with slats, or smooth, upright sticks, in the\r\nform of the usual horse-rack. There is no objection to this, but it\r\nshould always be accompanied by a board trough affixed to the bottom, to\r\ncatch the fine hay which falls in feeding. These may be attached to the\r\nside of a building, or used double. A small lamb requires fifteen inches\r\nof space, and a large sheep two feet, for quiet, comfortable feeding;\r\nand at least this amount of room should be provided around the racks for\r\nevery sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\nTroughs.\r\n\r\nThey may be variously constructed. The most economical are made with two\r\nboards of any convenient length, ten to twelve inches wide. Nail the\r\nlower side of one upon the edge of the other, fastening both into a two\r\nor three inch plank, fifteen inches long and a foot wide, notched in\r\nits upper edge in the form required.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood.\r\n\r\nThere is no better food for sheep, than well-ripened, sound, timothy\r\nhay; though the clovers, and nearly all the cultivated grasses, may be\r\nadvantageously fed. Bean and pea straw are valuable, and especially the\r\nformer, which, if properly cured, they prefer to the best hay; and it is\r\nwell adapted to the production of wool. All the other straws furnish a\r\ngood food, and sheep will thrive on them without hay, when fed with\r\nroots or grain.\r\n\r\nRoots ought to be given them occasionally for a change, and especially\r\nto the ewes after lambing, if this occurs before putting them on to\r\nfresh pasture. They keep the stomach properly distended, the appetite\r\nand general health good; and they render their winter forage nearly\r\nequal to their summer feed.\r\n\r\nMuch grain is not suited to store-sheep. It is too rich, and should be\r\ngiven sparingly except to the lambs, the old ewes, or feeble sheep, or\r\nto restore the rams after hard service. For the above purposes, oats are\r\nthe best; and if any other grain, beans or peas are given, it should be\r\nin small quantities. When there is a deficiency of hay and roots, grain\r\nmay be used with straw.\r\n\r\nThe flock ought to be so fed as to receive the same amount of\r\nnourishment throughout every part of the year. The evenness and value of\r\nthe fleece depends much upon this. When the amount of nutrition is\r\ngreat, the wool-secreting organs are distended, and the fibre becomes\r\nenlarged; when limited, they necessarily contract, and the fibre is\r\nsmall. This produces a want of trueness, which the experienced stapler\r\nreadily detects, and which he does not fail to estimate against the\r\nvalue of the fleece.\r\n\r\nSheep ought to have a full supply of salt, and if accessible, sulphur,\r\nashes, tar, and clay would frequently be nibbled by them when their\r\nstomach required either. Pine or hemlock boughs are a good substitute\r\nfor tar, and afford a most healthful change in the winter-food of sheep.\r\nEntire cleanliness and dryness are also essential to the health of the\r\nflock. The smaller sizes of the Saxon may be well sustained on two\r\npounds of hay, but larger sheep will consume from three and a half to\r\nfour, or even five pounds per day. Sheep, like all other animals when\r\nexposed to cold, will consume much more than if well protected, or than\r\nduring a warmer season.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Care of the Ewes with Young\r\n\r\nIs an important consideration, as the lamb is sometimes the only profit\r\nyielded by the flock; for when fodder is high, or wool low, the fleece\r\nwill barely pay for the food and attention. Pregnant ewes require the\r\nsame food as at all other times; but caution is necessary to prevent\r\ninjury or abortion, which is often the result of excessive fat,\r\nfeebleness, or disease. The first may be remedied by blood-letting and\r\nspare diet; and both the last by restored health and generous food.\r\nSudden fright, as from dogs or strange objects; long or severe journeys;\r\ngreat exertions; unwholesome food; blows in the region of the f[oe]tus,\r\nand some other causes, produce abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeaning.\r\n\r\nMost flocks are turned into the pasture before yeaning time, and the ewe\r\nis then left to nature, which is a good practice, if she is healthy and\r\nthe weather good. But a larger number of lambs will be reared by a\r\ncareful oversight of the ewes, and the use of proper precautions. As\r\ntheir time approaches, which may be known by the springing of the udder\r\nand the enlargement of the natural parts, they should be put by\r\nthemselves at night, in a warm stable or with others in the same\r\ncondition, and well looked after, late and early in the day.\r\n\r\nThey seldom need any assistance, nor should any be rendered, except in\r\ncase of wrong presentation, or feebleness in expelling the f[oe]tus. In\r\nthe former case, the shepherd may apply his thumb and finger, after\r\noiling, to push back the young, and assist in gently turning it till the\r\nnose and fore-feet appear and for the latter, only the slightest aid\r\nshould be rendered, and that to help the throes of the dam.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Lambs.\r\n\r\nWhen lambing in the field, only a few should be together, as the young\r\nsometimes get changed, and the dams refuse to own them. This difficulty\r\nis generally obviated, by holding the ewe till the lamb has sucked two\r\nor three times; or they may be shut up together, and the lamb rubbed\r\nwith a little fine salt. The lamb does not require nourishment for some\r\nhours after its birth; but if the dam refuse to lick it as soon as it\r\nappears, it must be carefully wiped dry. If the weather be cold and the\r\nlamb is dropped in the field, the shepherd should be furnished with\r\nlarge pockets or a well-lined basket, in which it must be placed till\r\nthe ewe is brought to the shed.\r\n\r\nAfter the first day or two, the udders ought to be completely drained of\r\ntheir milk by the hand, so as to prevent swollen or caked bag. In case\r\nof deficiency of milk, the lamb may be supplied from a new milch cow, by\r\nmeans of a sucking-bottle with an air vent, or it may draw a part of its\r\nnourishment from another ewe, which can be held while the lamb is\r\nsucking.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes necessary to substitute a foster-mother, in which case,\r\nthe ewe may be made to own the lamb, by milking from her udder over the\r\nlamb and under his tail, rubbing it on well; or rub the adopted lamb\r\nwith the entrails and contents of the stomach of the dead lamb, or cover\r\nit with the skin. If the ewe proves a bad nurse, or it is desirable to\r\nbring the lambs forward rapidly, they may be early taught to eat boiled\r\noats or other grain, cabbage, roots, and tender hay. Lambs should be\r\nwell fed, as this is important to produce size, constitution, and\r\nperfection of form.\r\n\r\nThe ewes and their young ought to be divided into small flocks, and have\r\na frequent change of pasture. Some careful shepherds adopt the plan of\r\nconfining their lambs, and allow them to suck two or three times a day;\r\nby which they suffer no fatigue, and thrive much faster. But this is\r\ntroublesome and injurious, as the exercise is essential to the health\r\nand constitution of the lamb intended for rearing. It is admissible only\r\nwhen they are wanted for an early market, and by those who rear them for\r\nthis purpose, it is a common practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCastrating and Docking Lambs.\r\n\r\nAfter selecting enough of the choicest rams for stock-getters, the\r\ncastrating may be performed at any time between two and six weeks old,\r\nwhen the lamb is in good health. A cool day should be chosen; or if\r\nwarm, it must be done early in the morning. The best method is for one\r\nperson to hold the lamb firmly between his legs, on an inclined plank\r\nupon which he rests, while another with a sharp knife cuts off about\r\ntwo-thirds of the lower part of the scrotum. The testicles are then\r\ndrawn out till the spermatic cord is reached, which is divided by the\r\nthumb nail; or it is pulled out and cut with a sharp knife. It is\r\nsometimes done by simply opening the scrotum, when the testicles and\r\nspermatic cord are jerked out. The wound should then be rinsed with cold\r\nwater, after which apply lard.\r\n\r\nThe operation of docking is by many deferred till a late period, from\r\napprehension of too much loss of blood; but if the weather be favorable,\r\nand the lamb in good condition, it may be performed at this time with\r\nthe least trouble and without injury. The tail should be laid upon the\r\nplank, the person holding him in the same position as before. With one\r\nhand he draws the skin towards the body, while the other person, with a\r\ntwo-inch chisel and mallet, strikes it off at a blow, between the bone\r\njoints, leaving it one and a half to two inches long. The skin\r\nimmediately slips back over the wound and is soon healed. Ewe lambs\r\nshould be docked closer than the rams. To prevent flies and maggots, and\r\nassist in healing, it is well to apply an ointment composed of lard and\r\ntar, in the proportions of four pounds of the former to one quart of the\r\nlatter. This is also a good application for the scrotum. The lambs\r\nshould be carefully protected from cold and wet till they are perfectly\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTagging, or Clatting,\r\n\r\nIs the removal of such wool as is liable to get fouled, when the sheep\r\nare turned on to the fresh pastures, and of course it should be done\r\njust before leaving their winter quarters. It is most easily\r\naccomplished by placing the animal on a low table, and then holding it\r\nas in shearing, till the operation is performed. All the wool near the\r\nextremity of the sheath, and the scrotum of the males; from the udder of\r\nthe ewes; and from below the dock, the inside of the thighs, and the\r\nlegs of the sheep, should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer Management.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the warm weather approaches, and the grass appears, sheep\r\nbecome restive and impatient for the pasture. This instinct should be\r\nrepressed till the ground has become thoroughly dry, and the grass has\r\nacquired substance. They ought, moreover, to be provided for the change\r\nof food, by the daily use of roots for a few days before turning out. It\r\nwould also check the tendency to excessive purging, which is induced by\r\nthe first spring feed, if they were housed at night, and fed for the\r\nfirst few days with a little sound, sweet hay. They must be provided\r\nwith pure water, salt, &c., as in winter, for though they may sometimes\r\ndo tolerably well without either, yet thrift and freedom from disease\r\nare cheaply secured by this slight attention.\r\n\r\nDry, sweet pastures, and such as abound in aromatic and bitter plants,\r\nare best suited for sheep-walks. No animal, with the exception of the\r\ngoat, crops so great a variety of plants. They eat many which are\r\nrejected by the horse and the ox, and which are even essential to their\r\nown wants. In this respect, they are valuable assistants to the\r\nhusbandman, as they feed greedily on wild mustard, burdocks, thistles,\r\nmarsh-mallows, milkweed, and various other offending plants; and the\r\nMerino exceeds the more recent breeds in the variety of his selections.\r\n\r\nMany prepare artificial pastures for their flocks. This may be done with\r\na number of plants. Winter rye, or wheat sown early in the season, may\r\nbe fed off in the fall, without injury to the crop; and in the following\r\nspring, the rye may be pastured till the stalks shoot up and begin to\r\nform a head. This affords an early and nutritious food. Corn may be sown\r\nbroadcast, or thickly in drills, and either fed off in the fields, or\r\ncut and carried to the sheep in their folds. White mustard is a valuable\r\ncrop for this purpose.\r\n\r\nTo give sheep sufficient variety, it would be better to divide their\r\nrange into smaller ones, and change them as often at least as once a\r\nweek. They seek a favorite resting-place, on a dry, elevated part of the\r\nfield, which soon becomes soiled. By removing them from this for a few\r\ndays, rains will cleanse, or the sun dry it, so as again to make it\r\nsuitable for them. More sheep may be kept, and in better condition,\r\nwhere this practice is adopted, than where they are confined to the same\r\npasture.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashing Sheep.\r\n\r\nIn most of that portion of the Union north of 40 deg., the washing is\r\nperformed from the middle of May till the first of June, according to\r\nthe season and climate. When the streams are _hard_, which is frequently\r\nthe case in limestone regions, it is better to do this immediately after\r\nan abundant rain, by which the lime derived from the springs is\r\nproportionally lessened. The practice of a large majority of our\r\nfarmers, is to drive their sheep to the washing-ground early in the\r\nmorning on a warm day, leaving the lambs behind. The sheep are confined\r\non the bank of the stream by a temporary enclosure; from which they are\r\ntaken, and if not too heavy, are carried into water sufficiently deep to\r\nprevent their touching bottom. They are then washed, by gently squeezing\r\nthe fleece with the hands, after which they are led ashore, and as much\r\nof the water pressed out as possible before letting them go, as the\r\ngreat weight retained in the wool frequently staggers and throws them\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nA good practice is to lead the sheep into the water and saturate the\r\nfleece, after which they are taken ashore. When they commence\r\n_steaming_, they are again led into the water, and washed clean. This\r\ninsures thorough cleansing, where the water is pure. Others make use of\r\na boat, one end of which rests on a bold shore, and the other is in deep\r\nwater. The operator stands in the boat and plunges the animal over the\r\nside, when the washing is performed. It is sometimes done by sinking a\r\ntight hogshead or large box in the water, with heavy weights, in which a\r\nman stands, and the sheep are brought or led to him by another person,\r\nwho walks on a platform reaching from the bank to the hogshead. Either\r\nof the last methods obviates the necessity of standing for a long time\r\nin water, by which colds, rheumatism, &c. are frequently contracted. In\r\nparts of Germany, and sometimes in this country, sheep are forced to\r\nswim across a narrow stream several times, by which the fleece is\r\ntolerably cleaned, if all the water be pressed out when they get to the\r\nland. The yolk being a saponaceous compound, and not an oily matter as\r\nis generally supposed, it readily combines with the water and passes out\r\nof the wool.\r\n\r\nAn excellent practice, when streams are not convenient, is to lead a\r\nsmall ripple of soft water into a tub. To this, a little soap is added,\r\nafter which the sheep are immersed and thoroughly cleansed. Perfect\r\nwhiteness and purity of the fleece is readily secured afterwards, by\r\nthrowing over the sheep a jet of water. This practice has a good effect,\r\nin preventing or removing cutaneous disorders, and destroying ticks or\r\nother vermin.\r\n\r\nMany judicious farmers object to washing sheep, from its tendency to\r\nproduce colds and catarrhal affections, to which sheep are particularly\r\nsubject; but it cannot well be dispensed with, as the wool is always\r\nmore saleable, and if carefully done, need not be attended with injury.\r\nWarm settled weather, however, is indispensable to washing with safety\r\nto the general health of the sheep.\r\n\r\nFig. 26 shows a ewe, with lines indicating the usual method of sorting\r\nwool; number 1 indicating the refina or picklock; 2 and 3, the second\r\nand third qualities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.\r\n\r\nWool Sorting]\r\n\r\n\r\nShearing.\r\n\r\nThe manner of shearing varies with almost every district; but as this is\r\nan art to be acquired under a skilful master, we shall omit particular\r\ndetails on the subject. First clip all the tags and filth, if any\r\nremains or has been accumulated after the tagging in the spring; then\r\ntake off the fleece and spread it with the outside uppermost on a smooth\r\nbench or table, and push the wool carefully together, to render it more\r\ncompact; double the sides over to the centre; throw the clean loose\r\nlocks into the middle, and roll together from each end. This makes a\r\nsmooth, dense package, which is secured by passing a stout twine one or\r\nmore times around the sides and ends. All the wool from the extremities,\r\nshould be closely sheared and saved by itself, before dismissing the\r\nsheep, but not put up with choice fleeces.\r\n\r\n_If wounds are made_, which is sometimes the case with unskilful\r\noperators, a mixture of tar and grease ought to be applied. After\r\nshearing, such horns and hoofs as are likely to be troublesome, should\r\nbe sawed and pared.\r\n\r\nThe _branding_, or _marking_, is essential to distinguish them from\r\nother flocks, and this is done on the shoulder, side, or buttock. A\r\nbrush or marking-iron is used for this purpose, with paint made of\r\nlampblack, to which a little spirits of turpentine is first added, and\r\nthen diluted with linseed or lard oil.\r\n\r\nIf the weather be cool, and especially, if severe storms occur after\r\nwashing or shearing, the flock should be housed. If sultry, they should\r\nhave a cool, shady retreat, where they will be shielded from the flies\r\nand the heat. Blisters and permanent injury to the skin and fleece, are\r\nfrequently the result of such exposure. Shade trees in their pastures,\r\ncontribute much to the comfort of sheep, when exposed to a blazing sun.\r\nA close examination of the skin should be made at shearing, for the\r\ndetection of disease or vermin.\r\n\r\nFor remedies, see article _diseases_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmearing or Salving Sheep\r\n\r\nIs a custom little practised in this country. For cold, elevated, and\r\nbleak exposures, it may be necessary, and it is, therefore, generally\r\nadopted in Scotland. The object is, to prevent cutaneous diseases and\r\nvermin, and furnish additional warmth and protection to the fleeces of\r\nsuch breeds as are deficient in yolk. It is usually performed in the\r\nlatter part of October, but is sometimes done immediately after\r\nshearing.\r\n\r\nThe mixture or salve consists of tar and butter or grease, in different\r\nproportions; 1 gallon of the former to 12, or sometimes 20 lbs. of the\r\nlatter; the greater proportion of tar being required for the younger\r\nsheep, or for more exposed situations. The grease is melted over the\r\nfire, and the tar stirred in, and when sufficiently cool, it is applied\r\nto the whole body of the sheep, by carefully parting the wool and\r\nrubbing it on the skin with the fingers. The above quantity is\r\nsufficient for 30 or 50 sheep, according to their size and the character\r\nof the wool.\r\n\r\nThis application is not required for fine-woolled sheep, whose fleeces\r\nare more appropriately protected by a natural secretion of yolk; and it\r\nis better to omit it in all cases, where the health and comfort of the\r\nanimal do not render it absolutely essential. Mr. Stewart, an\r\nexperienced Scotch shepherd, uses only tallow and train oil, mixed in\r\nequal proportions. He asserts, that the improvement in the growth and\r\nquality of the wool is at least one-third, and it materially benefits\r\nthe condition of the sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaning.\r\n\r\nThe lambs may be weaned from 31/2 to 4 months old. They should be put upon\r\nrich, sweet feed, but not too luxuriant; while the dams are turned upon\r\nthe poorest, and so remote from their young, as to be out of sight and\r\nhearing. The ewes ought to be carefully examined after a day or two, and\r\nif necessary, the milk removed with the hand. If it continues to\r\naccumulate, the ewe may be fed on hay for a few days.\r\n\r\nWhen thoroughly dried off, they should have the best fare, to enable\r\nthem to recover condition for subsequent breeding and wintering. The\r\nfall is a critical period to lose flesh, either for sheep or lambs; and\r\nif any are found deficient, they should be at once provided with extra\r\nfeed and attention. If cold weather overtakes them poor or in\r\nill-health, they will scarcely outlive it; or if by chance they survive,\r\ntheir emaciated carcass, impaired constitution, and scant fleece, will\r\nill repay the food and attention they will have cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time for taking Sheep from the Pastures.\r\n\r\nThis must depend on the state of the weather and food. Severe frosts\r\ndestroy much of the nutriment in the grasses, and they soon after cease\r\nto afford adequate nourishment. Long exposure to cold storms, with such\r\nfood to sustain them, will rapidly reduce their condition. The only safe\r\nrule is to transfer them to their winter-quarters the first day they\r\ncease to thrive abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrafting the Flock,\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of ridding it of the supernumeraries, should be done at\r\nan earlier day. Such of the wethers as have attained their prime, and\r\nthose ewes that have passed it, ought to be withdrawn soon after\r\nshearing, provided with the best feed, and rapidly fitted for the\r\nshambles. If they have been properly pushed on grass, they will be in\r\ngood flesh by the time they are taken from it; and if not intended for\r\nstall-feeding, the sooner they are then disposed of the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nStall-Feeding.\r\n\r\nThis will be lost on an ill-shaped, unthrifty beast. The perfection of\r\nform and health, and the uniform good condition, which characterize the\r\nthrifty one, indicate too plainly to be misunderstood, those which will\r\nbest repay the care of their owner. The selection of any indifferent\r\nanimal for stall-fattening, whether cattle or sheep, will inevitably be\r\nattended with loss. Such ought to be got rid of when first brought from\r\nthe pasture, for the most they will bring.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Sheep for the Prairies.\r\n\r\nWhen destined for the prairies, sheep ought to commence their journey as\r\nearly after shearing as possible. They are then disencumbered of their\r\nfleece, and do not catch and retain as much dust, as when driven later.\r\nFeed is also generally better, and the roads are dry and hard. Young and\r\nhealthy sheep should be selected, with early lambs; or if the latter are\r\ntoo young, and the distance great, they should be left and the ewes\r\ndried off. A large wagon ought to accompany the flock, to carry such as\r\noccasionally give out; or they may be disposed of whenever they become\r\nenfeebled. With good care, a hardy flock may be driven at the rate of 12\r\nor 14 miles a day. Constant watchfulness is requisite, to keep them\r\nhealthy and in good plight. One-half the expense of driving, may be\r\nsaved by the use of well-trained shepherd-dogs.\r\n\r\nWhen arrived at their destination, they must be thoroughly washed, to\r\nfree them from all dirt, and closely examined as to any diseases they\r\nmay have contracted, which, if discovered, should be promptly removed. A\r\nvariety of suitable food and good shelter must be provided, for the\r\nautumn, winter, and spring ensuing, and every necessary attention given\r\nthem. This would be necessary if indigenous to the country; how much\r\nmore so, when they have just undergone a campaign, to which neither they\r\nnor their race have been accustomed!\r\n\r\nSheep cannot be kept on the prairies without much care, artificial food,\r\nand proper attention; and from a false system of economy, hitherto\r\nattempted by many, losses have occurred from disease and mortality in\r\nthe flocks, sufficient to have made ample provision for the comfort and\r\nsecurity of twice the number lost. More especially do they require\r\nproper food and attention, after the first severe frosts set in, which\r\nwither and kill the natural grasses. By nibbling at the _fog_, (the\r\nfrostbitten, dead grass,) they are inevitably subject to constipation,\r\nwhich a bountiful supply of roots, sulphur, &c., is alone sufficient to\r\nremove.\r\n\r\nRoots, grain, and good hay; straw, or corn-stalks, pea or bean vines,\r\nare essential to the preservation of their health and thrift during the\r\nwinter, everywhere north of 39 deg.. In summer, the natural herbage is\r\nsufficient to sustain them in fine condition, till they shall have\r\nacquired a denser population of animals, when it will be found necessary\r\nto stock their meadows with the best varieties of artificial grasses.\r\n\r\nThe prairies seem adapted to the usual varieties of sheep introduced\r\ninto the United States; and of such are the flocks made up, according to\r\nthe taste or judgment of the owners. Shepherd-dogs are invaluable to the\r\nowners of flocks, in those unfenced, illimitable ranges, both as a\r\ndefence against the small prairie-wolf, which prowls around the sheep,\r\nbut which are rapidly thinning off by the settlers; and also as\r\nassistants to the shepherds in driving and herding their flocks on the\r\nopen ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF SHEEP.\r\n\r\nThe dry and healthful climate, the rolling surface, and the sweet and\r\nvaried herbage, which generally prevail in the United States, insure\r\nperfect health to an originally sound and well-selected flock, unless\r\npeculiarly exposed to disease. No country is better suited to sheep,\r\nthan most of the northern and some of the southern parts of our own. In\r\nEurope, and especially in England, where the system of management is\r\nnecessarily in the highest degree artificial, consisting frequently in\r\nearly and continued forcing the system, folding on wet, plowed grounds,\r\nand the excessive use of that watery food, the Swedes turnip, there are\r\nnumerous and fatal diseases. Hence the long list which lumbers the pages\r\nof foreign writers on sheep.\r\n\r\nThe most destructive of these are the rot, and epidemics which are\r\nscarcely known in America, except by report. The diseases incident to\r\nour flocks may generally be considered as casualties, rather than as\r\ninbred, or necessarily arising from the quality of food, or from local\r\ncauses. It may be safely asserted, that with a dry pasture, well stocked\r\nwith varied and nutritious grasses; a clear, running stream; sufficient\r\nshade and protection against severe storms; a constant supply of salt,\r\ntar, and sulphur in summer; good hay, and sometimes roots, with ample\r\nshelters in winter; young sheep, originally sound and healthy, will\r\nseldom or never get diseased on American soil.\r\n\r\nThe few diseases which it may be necessary here to mention, will be\r\ntreated in the simplest manner. Remedies of general application, to be\r\nadministered often by the unskilful and ignorant, must neither be\r\nelaborate nor complicated; and, if expensive, the lives of most sheep\r\nwould be dearly purchased by their application.\r\n\r\nA sheep which the owner has reared or purchased at the ordinary price,\r\nis the only domestic animal which can die without material loss to its\r\nowner. The wool and pelt will, in most instances, repay its cost, while\r\nthe carcasses of other animals will be worthless except for manure. The\r\nloss of sheep from occasional disease, will leave the farmer's pocket in\r\na very different condition from the loss of an equal value in horses or\r\ncattle. Yet humanity, equally with interest, dictates the use of such\r\nsimple remedies for the removal of suffering and disease, as may be\r\nwithin reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiarrh[oe]a or Scours,\r\n\r\nWhen light and not long continued, calls for no remedy. It is a\r\nhealthful provision of nature for the more rapid expulsion of some\r\noffending matter in the system, which, if retained, might lead to\r\ndisease. It is generally owing to improper food, as bad hay or noxious\r\nweeds; to a sudden change, as from dry food to fresh grass; or to an\r\nexcess, as from overloading the stomach; and sometimes, from cold and\r\nwet.\r\n\r\nThe _remedies_ are obvious.\r\n\r\nChange to suitable food in the first two cases; enforce abstinence after\r\nrepletion; and provide warm, dry shelter, with light diet, if owing to\r\nthe latter causes.\r\n\r\nWhen severe or long continued, a dose of castor oil may be given, and\r\nafter its operation, give four grains of opium and one ounce chalk, and\r\nput them on dry food. Wheat-bran or shorts, and oat-meal or flaxseed\r\nground, are both good for ailing lambs and sheep; as are also ripe oats\r\nor wheat, fed in the sheaf, with well cured, sweet hay, and plenty of\r\nsalt. Fresh boughs of the juniper, or pine and hemlock, help to check\r\nthe disorder.\r\n\r\n_Looseness in the larger lambs_ is prevented by having chalk within\r\ntheir reach; or if they refuse it, administer it in their food. When it\r\nhappens soon after birth, place it with the ewe in a warm place, and\r\nfeed the latter with plenty of oats, or other sound grain. If the milk\r\nbe deficient, give the lamb cow's milk scalded, or let it suck the cow.\r\nThe tail is sometimes glued on to the buttocks, while the scours\r\ncontinue. Separate it immediately by the use of warm water, and rub the\r\nparts with dry loam or clay.\r\n\r\n\r\nDysentery.\r\n\r\nThis is a different and frequently a fatal disease, but resembles the\r\nformer in its general symptoms. It is owing to prolonged diarrh[oe]a,\r\nunwholesome or meager food, and other causes. Bleeding and physic should\r\nbe resorted to, after which give warm, nourishing gruel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoven.\r\n\r\n_For description and remedies, see hoven in cattle._\r\n\r\n\r\nBraxy.\r\n\r\nThis is manifested by uneasiness, loathing of food, frequent drinking,\r\ncarrying the head down, drawing the back up, swollen belly, feverish\r\nsymptoms, and avoidance of the flock. It appears mostly in late autumn\r\nand spring, and may be induced by exposure to severe storms, plunging in\r\nwater when hot, and especially by constipation brought on by feeding on\r\nfrostbitten, putrid, or indigestible herbage.\r\n\r\n_Remedies_ are not often successful, unless promptly applied. Bleed\r\nfreely, and to effect this, in consequence of the stagnant state of the\r\nblood, immersion in a tub of hot water may be necessary. Then give two\r\nounces Epsom salts, dissolved in warm water, with a handful of common\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nIf this is unsuccessful, give a clyster made with a pipe-full of\r\ntobacco, boiled for a few minutes in a pint of water. Administer half,\r\nand if this is not effectual, follow with the remainder. Then bed the\r\nanimal in dry straw and cover with blankets, and assist the purgatives\r\nwith warm gruels, followed by laxative provender till\r\nwell.--(_Blacklock._) Thousands of sheep have died on the prairies from\r\nbraxy, induced by exposure and miserable forage. Entire prevention is\r\nsecured by warm, dry shelters, and nutritious, digestible food.\r\n\r\n\r\nCostiveness.\r\n\r\nThis is removed by giving two tablespoonfuls of castor oil every twelve\r\nhours, till the difficulty is removed; or give one ounce Epsom salts.\r\nThis may be assisted by an injection of warm, weak suds and molasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nStretches.\r\n\r\nSheep sometimes stretch out their noses on the ground, and around their\r\nsides, as if in severe pain. This may be caused by an involution of one\r\npart of the intestine within another. When owing to this cause, the\r\ndifficulty is frequently removed by jerking the animal by the hind-legs\r\nseveral times, when the pain disappears.\r\n\r\nBut it is generally occasioned by _costiveness_, which see above. This\r\nmay be prevented by using green food, roots, &c., once a week, or by\r\nallowing them to browse on the evergreens, pines, hemlock, and firs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoison,\r\n\r\nFrom laurel and other plants, is cured by pouring a gill of melted lard\r\ndown the throat, or boil for an hour the twigs of the white ash, and\r\ngive half to one gill of the strong liquor immediately; to be repeated\r\nif not successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation of the Lungs.\r\n\r\nThis is produced by improper exposure to cold and wet. The remedy for\r\nslight affections, is warm, dry shelter, and light food. When severe,\r\nresort must be had to bleeding and purging freely, then to light bran or\r\nlinseed mashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRot.\r\n\r\nThis sometimes causes the death of a million of sheep in a single year\r\nin England, yet it is a disease almost unknown in this country. Foreign\r\nauthorities ascribe it entirely to excessive humidity of climate, wet\r\npastures, or too watery food.\r\n\r\nThe preventives are therefore obvious. After the use of dry food and dry\r\nbedding, one of the best is the abundant use of pure salt. In violent\r\nattacks, early bleeding, followed by a dose of two ounces Epsom salts,\r\nto be repeated if necessary, with a change of diet and location, is all\r\nthat can be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoot-Rot.\r\n\r\nThis is frequently a prevalent disease among American sheep. It is\r\nsometimes spontaneous, but more often produced by contagion. In the\r\nformer case, it is caused by soft, rich, or moist pastures. A dry\r\ngravelly or rocky range, will of course be an effectual preventive when\r\nowing to this cause.\r\n\r\nThe disorder is communicated by the absorbents of the foot coming in\r\ncontact with the suppuration which has been left on the ground from the\r\ndiseased part. Absolute safety against this contagion is secured only by\r\na total avoidance of the walks of the infected animals, till repeated\r\nrains, or what is better, frosts, have disarmed the virus of its\r\nmalignity.\r\n\r\n_Remedies_ are variously compounded, of blue vitriol, verdigris, tar,\r\nspirits of turpentine, alum, saltpetre, salt, lime, copperas,\r\nwhite-lead, antimony, alcohol, urine, vinegar, &c., all of which have\r\nproved effectual.\r\n\r\nThe hoof should first be pared and thoroughly scraped. Then apply a wash\r\nmade of three parts of blue vitriol, one of verdigris pulverized finely,\r\nwith scalding (not boiling) vinegar; stirring briskly till it is of the\r\nconsistence of thin cream, and put it upon the affected part with a\r\npaint brush. It is a good preventive, to apply this to the sound feet of\r\nthe affected animal.\r\n\r\nAnother remedy is to use spirits of turpentine after scraping; and if\r\nthe disease is of long standing, add to the turpentine a strong\r\ndecoction of blue vitriol dissolved in water. The foot should be\r\nexamined every week, and the remedy repeated till perfect soundness is\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nA feather dipped in muriatic or nitric acid, and applied to the parts\r\nafter scraping and cleansing, is a good remedy. When put upon the soles\r\nof _foot-sore_ sheep, it hardens the hoofs, and enables them to travel\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nSheep are sometimes cured by keeping them on a dry surface, and driving\r\nover a barn-floor daily, which is well covered with quicklime. It may\r\nalso be cured by dryness, and repeated washing with soap-suds.\r\n\r\nThe above ailment should not be confounded with a temporary soreness, or\r\ninflammation of the hoof, occasioned by the irritation from the long,\r\nrough grasses which abound in low situations, which is removed with the\r\ncause; or if it continues, apply white paint or tar, after thorough\r\nwashing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrosion of the Flesh by Flies or Maggots,\r\n\r\nMay be cured by first removing the vermin; then wash with Castile soap\r\nand warm soft water, after which apply white-lead with linseed oil. Tar\r\nput on the festering wound corrodes it; but this, or spirits of\r\nturpentine placed on the sound parts near it, keep off the flies by\r\ntheir strong effluvia.\r\n\r\nIf the wound be slight, and the weather moderate, apply a little spirits\r\nof turpentine with a strong decoction of elder bark.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlies on Sheep\r\n\r\nMay be prevented by smearing with a composition made of two pounds lard\r\nor soft grease, one pound sulphur, half pint oil of amber, or oil of\r\ntar, or tar alone. A small spoonful is sufficient for a sheep.--_Genesee\r\nFarmer._\r\n\r\n\r\nProtection from the Gad-Fly.\r\n\r\nIn July, August, and September, in the Northern states, the _gad-fly_\r\n(_[OE]stus ovis_) attacks the nostrils of the sheep, and there deposites\r\nits eggs, which, on being hatched, immediately crawl up and make a\r\nlodgment in the head. They are frequently repelled by laying a thick\r\ncoat of tar on the bottom of the troughs, and sprinkling it with salt.\r\nThe smell of the tar adhering to the nose will drive off the fly. A more\r\neffectual remedy is to apply it thoroughly with a brush to the external\r\npart of the nose.\r\n\r\nIf a few furrows of loose earth are turned up in their pastures, the\r\nsheep will hold their noses to them, and thus keep off the fly.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of grubs in the head, are drooping of the head and ears,\r\ndischarge of bloody and watery matter from the nostrils, and loss of\r\nstrength in the limbs.\r\n\r\nIf worms have made a lodgment, take half a pound of good Scotch snuff,\r\nand two quarts boiling water: stir, and let it stand till cold. Inject\r\nabout a tablespoonful of this liquid and sediment up each nostril, with\r\na syringe. Repeat this three or four times at intervals, from the middle\r\nof October till January: the grubs are then small, and will not have\r\ninjured the sheep. The efficacy of the snuff will be increased, by\r\nadding half an ounce assaf[oe]tida, pounded in a little water. The\r\neffect on the sheep is immediate prostration and apparent death, but\r\nthey will soon recover. A decoction of tobacco will afford a substitute\r\nfor snuff.--_N. Eng. Far._\r\n\r\nBlacklock's remedy is, to half fill the bowl of a pipe with tobacco,\r\nlight it, and then hold the sheep, while a person inserts the stem some\r\ndistance into the nostril, and blows a few whiffs into the nose. The\r\noperation is then repeated with the other nostril.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwollen Mouth\r\n\r\nIs sometimes fatal. It is said to be cured by daubing the lips and mouth\r\nplentifully with tar.--_Albany Cultivator._\r\n\r\n\r\nFoul Noses.\r\n\r\nDip a small swab into tar, then roll in salt. Put some on the nose, and\r\ncompel the sheep to swallow a small quantity.--_American Far._\r\n\r\nA disease indicated by drooping, running at the eyes, weakness in the\r\nback and loins, inability to use the hind legs, was removed by turning\r\nthe sheep into a pasture containing lobelia, (_Indian tobacco._) Dried\r\nlobelia was also given, and produced the same effect.--_Cultivator._\r\n\r\n\r\nScab.\r\n\r\nThis loathsome disease, to which fine-woolled sheep are particularly\r\nliable, is caused, like itch in the human subject, by a small insect, a\r\nspecies of the _acari_. It is first manifest by the rubbing of the\r\nsheep, and soon after by one or more tufts of wool, which is loosened at\r\nthe roots. On feeling the skin, a hard, dry tumor is perceptible. To\r\nprevent contagion, remove the infected sheep to a separate pasture or\r\nyard as soon as discovered.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The Spanish shepherds dissolve a little salt in their\r\nmouth, and drop it upon the infected part.\r\n\r\nWhen the tumor has become enlarged, the wool should be removed closely\r\nto the skin, the scab scraped with a curry-comb, then wash with strong\r\nsoap-suds or ley, and afterwards rub thoroughly with sulphur or\r\nbrimstone, mixed with lard or grease.\r\n\r\nAn effectual remedy is prepared by taking one pound of tobacco, which\r\nadd to 12 quarts ley from wood ashes of sufficient strength for washing,\r\nand four quarts urine; to this add another mixture of a gill high-wines;\r\n1/4 oz. camphor; 1/4 oz. Spanish brown, and 1/2 gill spirits of turpentine. A\r\nsmall quantity of this applied to the sore will never fail.\r\n\r\nImmediately after shearing, scab may readily be cured by immersing the\r\nsheep, (excepting the head,) in a strong decoction of tobacco liquor,\r\nadding a gill of spirits of turpentine for the first, and making a\r\nslight addition of fresh liquid for each sheep, enough to keep up the\r\nstrength of the tobacco and turpentine, and taking care to rub the\r\naffected part thoroughly. For lambs, this liquor should be diluted, but\r\nyet left strong enough to kill ticks in one or two minutes, which may be\r\nascertained by experiment.\r\n\r\nScab is also removed by using a composition of one pound plug tobacco to\r\nthree gallons of water, with lime-water and oil of vitriol added; or a\r\ndecoction of hellebore with vinegar, sulphur, and spirits of\r\nturpentine.--(_H. D. Grove._)\r\n\r\nScab is propagated more by using the same rubbing posts, than by contact\r\nwith each other. Sheep in low condition are more subject to it than\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTicks and Lice\r\n\r\nSometimes infest sheep. Good feeding and shelter is a partial\r\npreventive, but when they have made their lodgment, they must be dipped\r\nin a decoction of tobacco water. The most effectual time for their\r\ndestruction, is a few days after shearing, when they will have left the\r\nnaked bodies of the old ewes, to hide in the fleeces of the lambs. The\r\ndipping in tobacco water, with the addition of a small quantity of\r\nturpentine, is an effectual remedy.\r\n\r\nAfter dipping the sheep or lambs, the liquor should be pressed out from\r\nthe wool, upon an inclined plane, so arranged as again to run into the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\n\r\nPelt-rot\r\n\r\nWill be recognised as one of the staple diseases of our _native sheep_,\r\ndescribed on page 89. The wool in this case falls off, leaving the sheep\r\npartially or almost wholly naked; but this is not accompanied with\r\nsoreness or apparent disease. The animal must be provided with a warm\r\nstall and generous feed, and the naked skin should be anointed with tar\r\nand grease. The preventive is good keeping and shelter.\r\n\r\n\r\nStaggers or Sturdy, and Water in the Head,\r\n\r\nSometimes affect sheep, but more especially lambs under a year old. The\r\nfirst is caused by the _hydatid_. It is considered as an almost\r\nincurable disorder, but is sometimes removed by trepanning.\r\n\r\nChancellor Livingston carefully supplied two thus attacked, with food\r\nfor three months, when nature effected a cure. Removal to dry lands and\r\npurging, is a good precaution when they are first taken.\r\n\r\nAn English lad lately cured one which had been given up, by boring with\r\na gimlet into the soft place on the head, when the water rushed out, and\r\nthe sheep immediately followed the others to the pasture. A\r\ncorrespondent of the Albany Cultivator asserts, that 1/2 a pint of melted\r\nlard poured down the throat, will cure blind staggers in ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbortion\r\n\r\nOccurs sometimes, and is usually caused by excessive fright or exertion,\r\nand sometimes by severe exposure and poor feed. It is seldom fatal,\r\nexcept to the lamb.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Uterus\r\n\r\nIs occasionally protruded after lambing. It should be immediately\r\nreturned, first washing it in warm milk and water, if any dirt adheres\r\nto it. For this, the hand only should be used. After rubbing it with\r\nlard or oil, hold up the hind legs, and gently replace the protruded\r\nparts, then keep the ewe quiet till fully recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Garget, or Caked Bag.\r\n\r\nKeep the bag thoroughly drained of milk, for which purpose the lamb is\r\nthe most efficient. If it is lost, another may be temporarily\r\nsubstituted. Purge freely with Epsom salts, and wash the udder\r\nrepeatedly with very warm water. If matter forms, it should be opened\r\nwith the lancet.\r\n\r\n\r\nBleeding.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing tends so much to the recovery of an animal from a disease in\r\nwhich bleeding is required, as the rapid flow of the blood from a large\r\norifice. Little _impression_ can be made on an acute disease by the slow\r\nremoval of even a large quantity of blood, as the organs have time to\r\naccommodate themselves to the loss, which might, for any good it will\r\ndo, as well be dispensed with. Either bleed rapidly, or not at all. The\r\nnearer the commencement of an ailment, in which you employ bleeding,\r\nthe operation is resorted to, the greater the chance of its doing good.\r\n\r\nBleeding by nicking the under surface of the tail, does very well, where\r\nno great deal of blood is required, but it is not to be thought of if\r\nthe veins of the face or neck can possibly be opened. These are to be\r\ntaken in preference to a vein on the leg, as they are much more readily\r\ngot at. The facial vein commences by small branches on the side of the\r\nface, and runs downwards and backwards to the base of the jaw, where it\r\nmay be felt within two inches of the angle, or opposite the middle\r\ngrinding tooth. It is here that the orifice must be made: the thumb of\r\nthe left hand being held against the vein, so as to prevent the flow of\r\nblood towards the heart, will make it _rise_.\r\n\r\nSome prefer opening the jugular vein, which commences behind the eye and\r\nruns down the side of the neck. This vessel is, however, more difficult\r\nto open than the former, being better covered with wool, and not so\r\neasily exposed or made to swell. _Stringing_ is the mode commonly\r\nresorted to for this end; that is to say, a cord is drawn tightly round\r\nthe neck close to the shoulder, so as to stop the circulation through\r\nthe vein, and render it perceptible to the finger.\r\n\r\nA lancet is the instrument generally used in bleeding, though a\r\nwell-pointed penknife will do at a pinch. The opening must always be\r\nmade obliquely; but before attempting this, the animal must be secured,\r\nby placing it between the operator's legs, with its croup against a\r\nwall. The selected vein is then fixed by the fingers of the operator's\r\nleft hand, so as to prevent its rolling or slipping before the lancet.\r\nHaving fairly entered the vein, the point of the instrument must be\r\nelevated at the same time that it is pushed a little forward, by which\r\nmotion it will be lifted from or cut its way out of the vein.\r\n\r\n_A prescribed quantity of blood should never be drawn_, for the simple\r\nreason that this can never be precisely stated. If the symptoms are\r\nurgent, as in all likelihood they will be, your best plan is not to stop\r\nthe flow of blood till the animal fall or is about to fall. When this\r\noccurs, run a pin through the edges of the orifice, and finish by\r\ntwisting round it a lock of wool.\"--(_Blacklock._)\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge cuts are healed\r\n\r\nBy first sewing and then covering with salve. Smaller ones may be\r\nsecured with an adhesive plaster or bandage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo protect lambs from wolves and foxes,\r\n\r\nSmear the neck plentifully with a mixture of tar and sulphur. Bells are\r\nalso said to guard the flock, as both are excessively wary, and have a\r\ngreat dislike to any thing artificial. Large dogs will keep them at bay.\r\nA better remedy is to kill the marauders, which may be done by inserting\r\nstrychnine in fresh meat and leaving it in their haunts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn nearly all ages and countries, the horse has been the devoted\r\nservant, and the object of the pride and affection of man. Among the\r\nsemi-civilized Tartars of Middle and Northern Asia; the aborigines of\r\nour remote Western prairies, reaching even beyond the Rocky Mountains,\r\nand many other rude nations, his flesh is used for food. Most of the\r\ntribes among the former use the milk for domestic purposes, and\r\nespecially when fermented and changed to an unpleasantly sour and\r\nintoxicating beverage. But throughout the civilized world, with some\r\nslight exceptions, the horse is useful only for his labor. For this\r\npurpose he is pre-eminently fitted by his compact, closely-knit frame;\r\nhis sinewy, muscular limbs; his easy, rapid stride; his general form,\r\nand entire structure and habits.\r\n\r\nHe is found in his wild condition in Central Asia, Siberia, and the\r\ninterior of Africa; and for 300 years he has been turned loose to follow\r\nhis native instincts on the illimitable pampas of South America, and the\r\nwide-spread prairies of Mexico and California. In all these regions he\r\nclosely resembles the medium varieties of the domesticated horse; but as\r\nthe natural result of his freedom, he possesses more fire and spirit\r\nthan any other, except the blood-horse.\r\n\r\nArabia is generally claimed as the original native locality of the\r\nhorse, and as the only source from which he is to be derived in the\r\nrequisite perfection for the highest improvement of the race. But\r\nStrabo, who wrote more than 1,800 years ago, asserts that the horse did\r\nnot then flourish in Arabia, and it was not till some centuries later\r\nthat he attained any decided superiority there. Great attention,\r\nhowever, has been paid in that country, since the era of Mahomet, to\r\nbreeding a light, agile, and enduring frame; intelligence and\r\ntractability of character; and the perpetuation of these qualities by\r\nthe most scrupulous regard for the purity of blood.\r\n\r\nThis is equally true of the Barb or pure-bred horse of Morocco, and\r\nthose of the northern coast of Africa, in Egypt, among the Turks, and\r\nindeed wherever the followers of the Prophet are to be found. It is\r\nunquestionable, that the influence of the Eastern blood among the\r\nchoicest animals of modern Europe, has been followed by great\r\nimprovements in racing stock. Yet it is equally certain, that the\r\nrace-horse, both of England and the United States, has accomplished what\r\nhas never been demonstrated as within the ability of their progenitors;\r\nand on repeated trials with the Eastern horses, he has shown himself\r\nconfessedly their superior in speed, strength, and endurance.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, two English horses ran against the two fleetest Cossacks which\r\ncould be found throughout the entire region of their best blood, and in\r\na continued race of 47 miles, the European took the stakes; Sharper, the\r\nmost successful, performing the distance in 2 hours and 48 minutes.\r\nAbout the same time, Recruit, an English horse of moderate reputation,\r\neasily beat Pyramus, the best Arabian on the Bengal side of India.\r\n\r\nThe Leeds, the Darley, and the Godolphin Arabian; the Lister and\r\nD'Arcey's White Turk, and other noted Eastern horses, would not compare\r\nin performance with many of their descendants. But these, with some\r\nother choice Arabians, on the best mares, and with every advantage for\r\nobtaining celebrity, have succeeded in establishing a fame as just as it\r\nhas been enduring. Yet it must at the same time be remembered, that of\r\nthe innumerable other pure-bred horses which have been tried in Europe,\r\na few only have rescued their names from oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Eastern blood in this country, in comparison with the\r\nbest English, is decidedly in favor of the latter. We have had one horse\r\nof unsurpassed excellence, which a fortunate accident threw upon our\r\nshores a short time previous to 1770. This was the white Barb _Ranger_,\r\nwhich was presented by the Emperor of Morocco, as the choice of his\r\nstud, to an English naval officer for some distinguished service. On his\r\nroute homeward, the animal was set on shore for exercise at an\r\nintermediate port, where in his gambols he broke three of his legs, and\r\nthinking him worthless, his owner gave him to the commander of a New\r\nEngland merchantman, then present. He was readily accepted, and placed\r\nin slings on board of his vessel, and recovered.\r\n\r\nThis animal stood for many years, in the eastern part of Connecticut;\r\nand on their good mares, produced a numerous progeny of unrivalled\r\ncavalry horses, which rendered invaluable services in the troop\r\ncommanded by that consummate partisan, Captain (afterwards General) Lee,\r\nof the Revolution. It is said the favorite white field-horse of General\r\nWashington was of the same stock. He was afterwards sold to Captain\r\nLindsey, as a special favor, and taken, to Virginia, where he produced\r\nsome good racers.\r\n\r\nBussorah, a small sorrel horse, brought into this country in 1819, from\r\nthe head of the Persian Gulf, got many choice roadsters, though no\r\nracers of celebrity.\r\n\r\nThe Narraganset pacers, a race belonging to our Northern states, but for\r\nmany years almost extinct, possessed for a long time an unrivalled\r\nreputation for spirit, endurance, and easy rapid motion under the\r\nsaddle. They are said to have originated from a Spanish horse, many of\r\nwhich are pure descendants of the Barb.\r\n\r\nAs an offset to these isolated examples of success in this country, we\r\nhave numerous instances of the importation of the best Orientals, which\r\nhave been extensively used on some of our superior mares, without any\r\nmarked effect. We shall refer to three prominent importations only.\r\n\r\nThe first consisted of two choice Arabians, or Barbs, selected in Tunis\r\nby General Eaton, and sent to his estate in Massachusetts. The second\r\nwas a present of four choice Barbs, from the Emperor of Morocco to our\r\ngovernment, in 1830; and the third consisted of two Arabians, sent by\r\nthe Imaum of Muscat, near the Persian Gulf, to our government in 1840.\r\nThese were all claimed to be, and no doubt were, of the pure Kochlani,\r\nthe unadulterated line royal; yet none have earned any distinguished\r\nreputation, either by their own performances or those of their\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\nIt is to England we are mainly indebted for the great improvement in our\r\nblood, road, and farm horses. A numerous race of fine horses was reared\r\non that island, long previous to its authentic history; for, in his\r\nfirst invasion Julius Caesar took many of them to Rome, where they\r\nimmediately became great favorites, although she had already plundered\r\nevery region of some of their best breeds.\r\n\r\nWhat might have been the particular merit of the English horse at the\r\ntime of the Norman invasion, is not known, but it is certain that the\r\nSaxon cavalry under Harold were speedily overpowered by William, at the\r\nbattle of Hastings, which at once secured the throne to the Conqueror.\r\nHistory first informs us of the improvement of British horses, by\r\nimportations from abroad during this reign, which consisted of a number\r\nof Spanish stallions. These were supposed to be strongly imbued with the\r\nArabian blood, which had been brought over to that country by the Moors,\r\nwho had founded the Saracenic empire in the Peninsula, three centuries\r\nbefore. More than a century later, John made some importations from\r\nFlanders, to give weight and substance to their draught and cavalry\r\nhorses. The improvement of their various breeds was afterwards pursued,\r\nwith more or less judgment and zeal, by other British monarchs, till\r\nthey reached their highest excellence during the middle of the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFlying Childers, Eclipse, Highflyer, and others on the course, have\r\nprobably exceeded in speed anything ever before accomplished; while the\r\ndraught-horse, the roadster, the hackney, the cavalry-horse, and the\r\nhunter, attained a merit at that time which some judicious authorities\r\nclaim has not been since increased. It is even asserted, that some of\r\nthe more serviceable breeds have been seriously injured by too great an\r\ninfusion of the blood; while the almost universal absence of long heats\r\non the turf has tended to the improvement of speed rather than bottom in\r\nthe race-horse.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the horse in this country has not been a matter of\r\nrecord or history, till within a comparatively recent period. But it has\r\nsilently, and with no little rapidity, been going forward for more than\r\na century, till we have obtained a race of animals, throughout the\r\nEastern and Middle states at least, which probably equal those of any\r\nother country for adaptedness to draught, the road, and the saddle. This\r\nimprovement has been mainly brought about by the importation of some of\r\nthe _best and stoutest of the English blood_. In breeding from these for\r\npurposes of utility, particular reference has been paid to strength,\r\nenduringness, and speed. No horses surpass our best four-mile bloods;\r\nnone equal our trotters; and though much inequality exists in those bred\r\nfor various other uses, yet for profitable service, it is believed, no\r\nequal number of animals elsewhere can exceed those in the region above\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nIt would be a superfluous task to attempt enumerating all the imported\r\nhorses that have contributed to this improvement. Each good animal has\r\ndone something. But among the earlier horses which may be named with\r\ndistinction, as having effected much for our useful beasts, are Lath,\r\nWildair, Slender, Sourkrout, Tallyho, Figure, Bay Richmond, Expedition,\r\nBaronet, and a host of others.\r\n\r\nPre-eminent among these, was imported Messenger. He was foaled in 1780,\r\nimported in 1788, and died in 1808. He stood in different places in New\r\nJersey, and in Dutchess, Westchester, and Queens counties in New York;\r\nand upon the mares derived from the foregoing and other good horses, he\r\ngot a numerous progeny of illustrious descendants. Of these we may name\r\nthose capital stallions, Potomac, Hamlintonian, Bay Figure, Engineer,\r\nMambrino, Tippoo Saib, Columbus, Gunn's, and Bushe's Messenger, and many\r\nothers, which were extensively disseminated over the Northern and Middle\r\nstates; and he has the credit of imparting a large share of his merits\r\nto that nonpareil of horses, his grandson, American Eclipse. His\r\nposterity were so numerous and widely spread, that it may be safely\r\nasserted, that of the best horses bred in the above states, scarcely one\r\ncan now be found which does not trace one or more crosses to this\r\ndistinguished sire. His success in producing roadsters, besides his\r\nblood qualities of speed and endurance, consisted in his great strength,\r\nand the peculiar formation of his limbs, large forehand and deep\r\nquarters, in which he excelled any other of the imported bloods.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of what may be accomplished by judicious breeding\r\nwith the present materials in our hands, we mention one family of the\r\nAmerican roadster, which is strongly tinctured with blood, and which has\r\nattained an enviable notoriety among the choicest of the Northern\r\nhorses. They are derived from the _Morgan horse_ of Vermont, that was\r\nfoaled in Springfield, Mass., in 1793. He was got by True Britton,\r\nsupposed to have been bred by Gen. Delancey of New York, and got by\r\nimported Wildair, (or one of his sons,) a horse of such distinguished\r\nexcellence, as to have been re-exported to England, for the benefit of\r\nhis stock.\r\n\r\nThe Morgan horse stood in Vermont from 1795 till his death, at an\r\nadvanced age. From him and the choice mares of Vermont, descended many\r\nexcellent colts; and his merits were inherited in an eminent degree by\r\nthree of his sons, which stood in the same state and continued the\r\ncareer of improvement commenced by the sire. The result has been the\r\nproduction of a family of roadsters, of much similarity of\r\nappearance[3] and uniformity of character, unsurpassed by any others\r\nfor serviceable qualities.\r\n\r\n[3] Many of the Morgan horses have the steep rump and heavy breast and\r\nneck, which indicate a Norman cross on the side of their dams. These\r\nhave been largely imparted through the French horse in the adjoining\r\nCanadian settlements, but none of these are said to have characterized\r\nthe founder of the race.\r\n\r\nThey are of medium size, from 131/2 to 15 hands high; with a well-formed\r\nhead and neck; high withers; deep chest; round body; short back; long\r\nquarters; broad flat legs; moderately small feet; long wavy mane and\r\ntail; presenting altogether the beau ideal of the road horse. They are\r\nspirited, docile, hardy, and easily kept. They have an easy, rapid trot,\r\nand glide along with a good load, without clatter or apparent effort, at\r\nthe rate of ten or twelve miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThis family of horses has not of course been bred long enough within\r\nthemselves, to have attained to the eminence of a distinct breed. They\r\nare mentioned, merely as a type of what the serviceable roadster ought\r\nto be, and what he may become by the use of the proper instruments for\r\nbreeding. And if the materials already in our hands are intelligently\r\nand perseveringly used, we can produce all we require of horse-flesh.\r\n\r\nBesides our unsurpassed blood-horses, we have others derived from\r\nvarious sources, and especially from the different English breeds, all\r\nof which are variously compounded, with the first and with each other.\r\nOn our northeastern frontier, the _Canadian_ prevails, a bastard but not\r\ndegenerate race, made up of the French Norman and the English or\r\nAmerican. At the extreme South and West, we have the _horse of Spanish\r\norigin_, obtained in his domestic state in Florida and Louisiana; and\r\nfrom another branch of the Spanish, are descended the wild horses of\r\nMexico and the more northern prairies. These are diversified in\r\ncharacter, and generally possess medium size and merit.\r\n\r\nThe _Conestoga_, a heavy roadster, is principally reared in\r\nPennsylvania, and is used for the team and truck. He is an amalgamation\r\nof several breeds, but probably owes a share of his character to the\r\nFlemish horse, for which there was a decided partiality among the\r\nnumerous German emigrants of that state.\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of _ponies_ are to be found in different sections, but\r\nprincipally among the French, the half-breed, and the Indians upon the\r\nfrontiers, who have bred a stunted race from the Canadian or wild-horse,\r\nand such others as could survive the hard usage and scanty winter food\r\nafforded by nature and their rude husbandry. Many of these have\r\nconsiderable beauty and symmetry, and are fleet, hardy, and spirited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.\r\n\r\nNorman Horse.]\r\n\r\nThe _modern Norman_, or mixture of the old French Norman draught-horse,\r\n(heavy-framed, big-limbed, but stout and hardy,) and the Andalusian, a\r\ndescendant of the Moorish barbs, has been introduced within a few years,\r\nand will unquestionably become a very popular horse for many purposes.\r\nHe exhibits the qualities of both ancestry in the proper proportions for\r\nfarm service. He has a thick head; lively, prick ears; short, heavy\r\nneck; large breast and shoulders; strong limbs; well-knit back; large\r\nquarters, with much wavy mane, tail, and fetlock. Like his French\r\nprogenitor, he frequently stands low in the withers, which enables him\r\nto throw great weight into the collar; and the diminished, flattened\r\nleg, the wind and game derived from his Moorish blood, give him much of\r\nthe capacity and endurance of the thorough-bred.\r\n\r\nThe _English cart-horse_ has for a long time made up some of the best,\r\nheavy dray-horses in the country, and late importations have refreshed\r\nthe breed with additional choice specimens. The _Cleveland bay_ has been\r\nintroduced of late, and promises good carriage-horses from our\r\nwell-spread, sizeable mares. The _Norfolk trotter Belfounder_ was\r\nimported many years since, and with our high-bred mares, has produced\r\nmany choice roadsters and trotters.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of our horse-flesh deserving of any notice, is chiefly\r\ncomposed of such as are superior in point of blood. The improvement in\r\nthe American horse, from this source, is conspicuous and decided.\r\nJudicious breeders still look for qualities in the descendants, which\r\nthey sought for in their imported sires, and the infusion of some of the\r\nstoutest of the blood is rapidly gaining an ascendency in the general\r\nstock. Our intelligent agriculturists should look to this subject\r\nclosely, and not permit this system to proceed to an extent that may be\r\nprejudicial to their value as draught-horses, as has been done in some\r\nportions of England and our Southern states.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger from excess of blood, if it be of the right kind; but\r\nit is seldom found combining that fulness and stoutness, and that\r\ndocility and tractableness of disposition, which are essential to the\r\ngig-horse or the horse of all work. Yorke says truly, that \"the\r\nroad-horse may possess different degrees of blood, according to the\r\nnature of the country and the work required of him. [He might have added\r\nwith propriety, _and according to the character of the blood_.] His legs\r\nwill be too slender; his feet too small; his stride too long, and he\r\nwill rarely be able to trot. Three parts, or half, and for the horse of\r\nall work, even less than that, will make a good and useful animal.\" For\r\nthe saddle only, the high-bred, if not disposed to be vicious, is never\r\nobjectionable to an enterprising and accomplished rider. His long\r\nelastic pasterns, giving easy, flexible motions; his quick and almost\r\nelectrical obedience when under thorough discipline; his habitual canter\r\nand high spirit, always commend him for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.\r\n\r\nPoints of a Horse.\r\n\r\n1.

Gullet.--39.\r\nJowl.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the prominent external points of a fine Saddle or Gig Horse,\r\n\r\nAre, a moderately small head, free from fleshiness; fine muzzle and\r\nexpansive nostrils; broad at the throat and wide between the eyes, which\r\ndenotes intelligence and courage; a dished face indicates high breeding,\r\nand sometimes viciousness; a convex or Roman nose frequently betokens\r\nthe reverse; the ears rather long, yet so finely formed as to appear\r\nsmall, and playing quickly like those of a deer; the eyes clear, full,\r\nand confident, with a steady forward look. Glancing them backward or\r\naskance with a sinister expression, and with none or only a slight\r\nmovement of the head, is indicative of a mischievous temper.\r\n\r\nThe neck should be handsomely arched, and fine at the junction with the\r\nhead, while the lower extremity must be full and muscular, and well\r\nexpanded at the breast and shoulders. The latter ought to be high and\r\nrun well back; the withers strong, firmly knit, and smooth; the breast\r\nneither too prominent nor retreating, too wide nor too narrow, and\r\nsupported by a pair of straight fore-legs, standing well apart. The\r\nchest should be deep, and the girth large; the body full, and not drawn\r\nup too much in the flank; the back short, and the hips gathered well\r\ntowards the withers; the loins wide and rising above the spine; the ribs\r\nspringing nearly at right angles from the back, giving roundness to the\r\nbody. The hips ought to be long to the root of the tail, and the latter\r\nmay approach to near the line of the back, which is a mark of good\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nBoth the thigh and hock should be large and muscular; and between the\r\nhock or knee and pastern, the legs should be broad, flat, and short; the\r\nhind legs properly bent, and all well placed under the body; the\r\npasterns of moderate length, and standing slightly oblique; the hoof\r\nhard, smooth, round before, and wide at the heel; the frog large and\r\nsound; and the sole firm and concave. A white hoof is generally tender,\r\neasy to fracture and to lame, and difficult to hold a shoe.\r\n\r\nThe _draught-horse_ ought to differ from the foregoing, in possessing a\r\nheavier and shorter neck; a wider and stouter breast, and low withers,\r\nso as to throw the utmost weight into the collar; a heavier body and\r\nquarters; larger legs and feet; and more upright shoulders and pasterns.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderations which affect the Value of the Horse.\r\n\r\nThe color is not material, provided it be not pied or mealy. No better\r\ncolor for horses can be found than the dark bay or brown, with black\r\nmane, tail, and legs. But most of the other colors are frequently found\r\nwith the best horses.\r\n\r\nHard-mouthed horses, when accompanied with great spirit, are\r\nobjectionable, as they require peculiar bitting and the utmost\r\nvigilance.\r\n\r\nThe paces and action of a horse are important, for if good they give a\r\nmuch greater capacity for performance. Some of these depend on form and\r\nstructure, and are unchangeable; others are the result of breaking. All\r\nhorses should be taught to walk fast, as it is their easiest and most\r\neconomical pace, and it will help them over a great deal of ground in a\r\nday, even with a heavy load, and with comparatively little effort. A\r\nhorse that steps short and digs his toes into the ground, is worthless\r\nas a traveller, and suited only to a ferry-boat or bark-mill.\r\n\r\nIt is important that a horse be good-tempered. If inclined to\r\nviciousness, he should be gently yet firmly managed when it is first\r\napparent. A resort to great severity will be justified, if necessary to\r\nconquer him; for if once allowed to become a habit, it will be difficult\r\nto cure him. Grooms and mischievous stable-boys, frequently do much\r\ninjury by their idle tricks with horses; and when detected, they should\r\nbe discharged at once.\r\n\r\nSome horses are nervous, easily excited, and start at every unusual\r\nnoise or object. Others are restive and fretful, and ever anxious to be\r\non the move. Kindness, and firm, yet mild treatment, by which their\r\nmotions and will are at all times controlled, and their confidence\r\nsecured, are the only remedies.\r\n\r\nOthers are inclined to sluggishness. These should have stimulating food,\r\nand never be overloaded or overworked, and then kept well to their\r\npaces. Whatever they are capable of performing, can be got from them in\r\nthis way only. Habit has great influence with animals, as with man; and\r\nwhen within the compass of his ability, he may be habituated to any\r\nreasonable physical exertion.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding.\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the general principles before enumerated, such animals\r\nshould be selected, as most eminently possess those points which it is\r\ndesired to propagate, and these, they should not only exhibit in\r\nthemselves, but should inherit as far as possible, from a long line of\r\nancestry. For the perpetuation of particular points in progeny, it would\r\nbe safer to rely on the latter quality than the former.\r\n\r\nThe selection of a mare, relatively larger than the horse, is an\r\nimportant rule in breeding, and it is believed that much of the success\r\nof Arabian and other Eastern horses as stock-getters, has resulted from\r\nthe application of this principle. They possess valuable traits, but\r\ncondensed within too small a compass. When such an animal is put to a\r\nwell-bred, larger mare, the f[oe]tus has abundance of room and\r\nnourishment to develop and perfect the circumscribed outlines of the\r\nmale parent, and acquire for itself increased volume and character.\r\n\r\nThe horse ought not to be less than four or five, and the mare one year\r\nolder, before being put to breeding. It would be still better to defer\r\nit for two or three years, or till the frame is fully matured.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gestation of the Mare\r\n\r\nSometimes varies from 44 to 56 weeks, but she usually goes with young\r\nfrom 47 to 50; and it is advisable she should take the horse at a time\r\nwhich will ensure the foaling when the weather is settled, and there is\r\na fresh growth of grass. She will be the better for light working till\r\nnear the time of foaling, if well, but not too abundantly fed. In a few\r\ndays after this, she may resume moderate labor; and if not in the way or\r\ntroublesome, the foal may run with her; but if she is exposed to\r\nheating, it should be confined till she cools, as suckling then is\r\ndecidedly injurious to it.\r\n\r\nThe mare is in danger of slinking her foal from blows and over-exertion,\r\nthe use of smutty grain, foul hay, or offensive objects or smell; and\r\nwhen this has once occurred, which happens usually in the fourth or\r\nfifth month, she should afterwards be generously fed at that period, and\r\nonly moderately worked, to prevent a recurrence of the casualty. When\r\nliable to slinking, the mare should be removed from others in foal, lest\r\na peculiar sympathy should excite an epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mare comes in Heat\r\n\r\nFrom nine to eleven days after foaling, when she should be put to the\r\nhorse, if it be desirable to have a colt the following season. She comes\r\nround at intervals of about nine days.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of the Colt.\r\n\r\nThe colt may be weaned when five to seven months old; and preparatory to\r\nthis, while with the mare, may be taught to feed on fine hay, meal, or\r\noats. When taken away, he should be confined beyond a hearing distance\r\nof the dam, and plentifully supplied with rowen or aftermath hay,\r\ncrushed oats, or wheat shorts. It is economy to provide a warm shelter\r\nthrough the inclement season for all animals, and especially for colts,\r\nwhich, with all other young, should have an abundance of nutritious\r\nfood. They will thus grow evenly and rapidly, and attain a size and\r\nstamina at two years old, they would not otherwise have acquired at\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n\r\nCastrating.\r\n\r\nThe colt should be altered at about one year, but if thin in the neck\r\nand light before, the operation may be deferred to such time as the\r\nrequisite development is secured. Few of the French diligence and farm\r\nhorses, and scarcely any of the Oriental, are ever castrated. They are\r\nthought to be more hardy and enduring; but the slight advantage they may\r\npossibly possess in this respect, would hardly compensate for the\r\ntrouble and inconvenience too frequently arising from their management.\r\n\r\nThe operation should be performed late in the spring or early in autumn,\r\nwhile the weather is mild. If in high condition, the animal must first\r\nbe bled and physicked. If large and fractious, he must be cast. Some\r\nback him into the angle of a worm fence, where he is firmly held by the\r\nhead with a bridle, and the operator accomplishes the object without any\r\ntrouble or material restiveness from the animal while standing. The\r\nscrotum should be opened on both sides, and the testicles cut, or rather\r\nthe cord scraped off, which prevents much bleeding. The wound may be\r\ndressed with a little lard; then turn him loose in a pasture which has a\r\nshelter from sun, wind, or rain. Another method of castrating is by\r\n_torsion_, or twisting.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocking\r\n\r\nIs practised by many, but merely to gratify an absurd and cruel caprice,\r\nwithout a single advantage, and the animal is better in every respect\r\nwith the tail unmutilated. If done at all, it should be when young, and\r\nwith a single stroke of the knife, or chisel and mallet; and if the\r\nweather be favorable, no further attention is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicking.\r\n\r\nThis inhuman custom is now getting unfashionable, and we omit any\r\ndescription of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreaking.\r\n\r\nWhile feeding in the stable, the colt should be gently treated, and\r\naccustomed to the halter and bit, which prepares him for breaking. If\r\npermitted to run with the others while at work, he becomes familiarized\r\nto it, and when harnessed by the side of some of his well-trained mates,\r\nhe seems to consider his discipline rather a privilege than a task. The\r\ncolt may be taken in hand for breaking at three years of age, and\r\nthoroughly broken to light work at four, but should not be put to hard\r\nservice till six or eight. A due regard to humanity and sound judgment,\r\nin thus limiting the burden in his early years, would save much disease\r\nand suffering to the animal, and profit to the owner, by his unimpaired\r\nstrength and prolonged life. The annual loss from neglecting this\r\nprecaution is enormous, which might be entirely avoided by less\r\neagerness to grasp the substance, while as yet the shadow only is within\r\nreach. Many animals are thus broken down at twelve, and are in their\r\ndotage at fifteen, while others of good constitution, if well treated,\r\nperform hard service till thirty.\r\n\r\n\r\nLongevity of the Horse.\r\n\r\nMr. Percival mentions one that died at 62. Mr. Mauran, of New York, has\r\na fine gig and saddle horse, now in his 45th year, sound, spirited, and\r\nplayful as a kitten. He is of a dark brown, with a tanned nose. We never\r\nyet saw a horse with a buff or bear muzzle, that had not great\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nAmerican Eclipse was successfully covering mares in Kentucky at the age\r\nof 32, the result of late and light service till his sinews became fully\r\nmatured. We have frequently seen a large, compact, flea-bitten horse at\r\nwork, dragging a heavy load in a single cart, which was formerly used as\r\none of Governor Maitland's coach-horses, and though upwards of 30, he\r\nwas apparently as sound and vigorous as an overtasked colt of seven or\r\neight.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding.\r\n\r\nThe vigor and duration of the horse depend much on proper feeding. Like\r\nthe cow and sheep, he may be made to subsist on animal food, fish, and\r\nalmost every species of nutritious vegetable. But his natural and proper\r\naliment is the grasses, grain, and roots. In the middle and northern\r\nsections of this country, his dry forage is almost invariably good\r\nmeadow-hay, generally timothy, which is the richest of the cultivated\r\ngrasses. At the South, this is often supplied by the blades of Indian\r\ncorn. But in all the states, a great variety of the grasses and clover\r\nare used.\r\n\r\nWhen put to hard labor, grain ought always to accompany hay in some\r\nform. Of the different kinds of grain, oats are peculiarly the horse's\r\nfood, and they are always safe, digestible, and nutritive. Barley is the\r\nbest substitute for it. Wheat and Indian corn are sometimes given, but\r\nboth are unsuitable; the first is too concentrated, and the last too\r\nheating. They ought to be sparingly used, and only when ground and mixed\r\nwith chaff. The offal of wheat is never objectionable.\r\n\r\nGrain is always more advantageously fed when ground or crushed, and wet\r\nsome time previous to eating; and it is still better when cooked. On\r\nboth sides of the Mediterranean, in the Barbary States, in Spain,\r\nFrance, and Italy, much of the food is given in small baked cakes, and\r\nthe saving in this way is much greater than the expense of preparing it.\r\n\r\nWhen confined to dry food, roots or apples fed once a day are always\r\nbeneficial. They keep the bowels open, the appetite and general health\r\ngood, and contribute largely to the nutriment of the animal. Carrots are\r\nthe best of the roots, as besides giving muscle and working power, they,\r\nmore than any other, improve the wind and prevent all tendency to\r\nheaves. They have even been found effectual in removing an obstinate\r\ncough. By many of the keepers of livery stables, they are always used,\r\nfor which purpose they command the same price as oats. Potatoes,\r\nparsnips, beets, and Swedes turnips, in the order mentioned, are next to\r\nbe preferred. Potatoes are improved by cooking.\r\n\r\nMixtures of food are best, as of cut hay, meal, and roots. Old horses,\r\nor such as are put to hard labor, will do much better if their food be\r\ngiven in the form easiest of digestion. No inconsiderable part of the\r\nvital power is exhausted by the digestion of dry, raw food.\r\n\r\nHorses ought to be fed, and if possible, exercised or worked regularly,\r\nbut never on a full stomach. This is a frequent cause of disease, and\r\nespecially of broken wind. If their food is given at the proper time,\r\nand the horse be allowed to finish it at once, without expecting more,\r\nhe will lie down quietly and digest it. This will be much more\r\nrefreshing to him, than to stand at the rack or trough, nibbling\r\ncontinually at his hay or oats. What remains after he has done feeding,\r\nshould be at once withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThey should have water in summer three times, and in winter twice a day.\r\nSoft or running water is much the best. While working, and they are not\r\ntoo warm, they may have it as often as they desire. Neither should they\r\nbe fed when heated, as the stomach is then fatigued and slightly\r\ninflamed, and is not prepared for digestion till the animal is again\r\ncool. Salt should always be within reach, and we have found an\r\noccasional handful of clean wood-ashes, a preventive of disease and an\r\nassistance to the bowels and appetite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.\r\n\r\nSkeleton of a Horse.\r\n\r\nA The Head.--_a_ The posterior maxillary or under jaw.--_b_ The superior\r\nmaxillary or upper jaw.

The horse in his natural condition is subject to few\r\nailments. It is only in his intensely artificial state, and when made\r\nthe slave of man, that he becomes a prey to disease in almost every\r\nshape. A careful and judicious attention to his diet, water, exercise,\r\nstable, and general management, will prevent many of those to which he\r\nis subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlanders.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most alarming. The first and most marked symptom is a\r\ndischarge from the nostrils of a peculiar character. The disease\r\nproduces inflammation there and in the windpipe, and in aggravated cases\r\npasses down to the lungs, which are soon destroyed.\r\n\r\n_It is propagated_ by contagion, by exposure in humid stables, and is\r\ninduced by hereditary indisposition and great exhaustion. Youatt says,\r\nthere is not a disease which may not lay the foundation for glanders.\r\nThe poison resides in the nasal discharge, not in the breath. When\r\nexposed to it, the mangers should be thoroughly scraped, washed with\r\nsoap and water, and afterwards with chloride of lime. All the clothing\r\nand harness, which may have received any of the contagious matter, must\r\nbe thoroughly cleansed and baked.\r\n\r\n_The best preventives_ are dry, clean, and well-ventilated stables,\r\nproper exercise, green food in summer, and roots in winter.\r\n\r\n_The disease may be arrested_ in its early stages, by turning the animal\r\non a dry pasture, but it is liable to return on subsequent confinement.\r\nIodine has lately been announced as a remedy, but of the certainty of\r\nits effects, we are not aware.\r\n\r\nIt is generally considered incurable, and when thoroughly seated, it may\r\nbe deemed an act both of humanity and economy to terminate the existence\r\nof its victim at once. This course becomes a duty, from the fact that\r\nmany grooms, by their attendance on glandered horses, have been\r\naffected, and though the disease is, in their case, more manageable, yet\r\nit is frequently fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarcy.\r\n\r\nThis is intimately connected with glanders, and the diseases frequently\r\nrun into each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nLampas.\r\n\r\nThis consists in the swelling of the bars of the mouth to a level or\r\neven above the teeth. It may occur from inflammation of the gums;\r\nshedding of the teeth; a febrile tendency, and from over-feeding or want\r\nof exercise. It will generally subside by low dieting and proper\r\nexercise; or it may be at once relieved by lancing the bars with a sharp\r\npenknife.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoll-evil.\r\n\r\nThis arises from some contusion or injury to the head, which produces a\r\nswelling that eventually suppurates. The inflammation may be abated, in\r\nits earliest stages, by a blister; and in its later, by bleeding,\r\nphysic, and cold lotions applied to the part. If these are ineffectual,\r\nand the swelling continues, it should be hastened by poultices, and\r\nwarm, stimulating lotions; and when fully formed, the tumor must be\r\nopened, so as to permit all the matter to run out. Repeated applications\r\nof salt will sometimes cure it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeaves.\r\n\r\nAll those affections, distinguished in the English veterinary works as\r\n_pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs_, _chronic cough_, _thick and\r\nbroken wind_, _consumption_, _&c._, are popularly designated as\r\n_heaves_. To some or all of these the horse may have an hereditary or\r\nconstitutional tendency. Their incipient stages are also induced by a\r\nsudden transition from heat to cold, and sometimes from cold to close\r\nand hot stables; and by a chilly wind or damp stables, especially after\r\nsevere exercise. Feeding on musty, dry hay, or on straw, will produce an\r\nirritation which may lead to heaves.\r\n\r\n_Inflammation of the lungs_ is frequently dangerous, and requires the\r\nimmediate and full use of the lancet. After the inflammation is\r\ndecidedly allayed, by copious bleeding, small doses of aloes may be\r\ngiven, and frequent injections of warm soap and water, which should be\r\nomitted the moment the feces become soft and approaching to the fluid\r\nstate. Blistering the sides and brisket, to be often repeated if\r\notherwise ineffectual, must be resorted to. Convalescence should be\r\nfollowed with sedative medicines, and during all the severe stages of\r\nthe disease, withhold all food, except light gruels after protracted\r\nabstinence. As health returns, put the animal out to grass.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the lungs is sometimes succeeded by a _chronic cough_,\r\nand the other maladies enumerated. When firmly seated, it is incapable\r\nof removal. Its effects can be alleviated, and with suitable food and\r\ntreatment, the horse may be made to do much moderate labor for many\r\nyears, but he can never become sound or sustain great exertion. Equal\r\nand proper temperature, moist, stimulating food, and especially carrots\r\nor potatoes, and moderate exercise, (but never on a full stomach,) and\r\ndry, clean stables, are all the remedies that can be prescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatarrh or Horse Distemper.\r\n\r\nThis sometimes attacks the horse in the spring or fall, and is shown by\r\nsoreness and swelling in the glands of the throat, a cough; difficulty\r\nof swallowing; discharging at the nose; and general prostration. It is\r\nseldom fatal, if properly managed. Give light bran-mashes, purge\r\nthoroughly, and keep warm. If he is violently attacked, he may be bled\r\nwhile fever exists; and blisters or setons may be applied, to reduce the\r\nswelling, if extreme. The disease is contagious, and the animal should\r\nbe at once placed where he cannot communicate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpasmodic Colic.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The attack of colic is usually very sudden. There is often\r\nnot the slightest warning. The horse begins to shift his posture, look\r\nround at his flanks, paw violently, strike his belly with his feet, and\r\ncrouch in a peculiar manner, advancing his hind limbs under him; he will\r\nthen suddenly lie, or rather fall down, and balance himself upon his\r\nback, with his feet resting on his belly. The pain now seems to cease\r\nfor a little while, and he gets up and shakes himself, and begins to\r\nfeed; the respite, however, is but short--the spasm returns more\r\nviolently--every indication of pain is increased--he heaves at the\r\nflanks, breaks out into a profuse perspiration, and throws himself more\r\nrecklessly about. In the space of an hour or two, either the spasms\r\nbegin to relax, and the remissions are of longer duration, or the\r\ntorture is augmented at every paroxysm; the intervals of ease are fewer\r\nand less marked, and inflammation and death supervene. The pulse is but\r\nlittle affected at the commencement, but it soon becomes frequent and\r\ncontracted, and at length is scarcely tangible.\r\n\r\nAmong the _causes_ of colic are, the drinking of cold water when the\r\nhorse is heated. There is not a surer origin of violent spasm than this.\r\nHard water is very apt to produce this effect. Colic will sometimes\r\nfollow the exposure of a horse to the cold air or a cold wind after\r\nstrong exercise. Green food, although, generally speaking, most\r\nbeneficial to the horse, yet, given in too large a quantity, or when he\r\nis hot, will frequently produce gripes. Doses of aloes, both large and\r\nsmall, are not unfrequent causes of colic.\r\n\r\nIn some horses there seems to be a constitutional predisposition to\r\ncolic. They cannot be hardly worked, or exposed to unusual cold, without\r\na fit of it. In many cases, when these horses have died, calculi have\r\nbeen found in some part of the alimentary canal. Habitual costiveness\r\nand the presence of calculi, are frequent causes of spasmodic colic. The\r\nseat of colic is occasionally the duodenum, but oftener the ileum or the\r\njejunum; sometimes, however, both the caecum and colon are affected.\r\nFortunately, we are acquainted with several medicines that allay these\r\nspasms; and the disease often ceases as suddenly as it appeared.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Turpentine is one of the most powerful remedies, especially\r\nin union with opium, and in good warm ale. A solution of aloes will be\r\nadvantageously added to the turpentine and opium. If relief is not\r\nobtained in half an hour, it will be prudent to bleed, for the\r\ncontinuance of violent spasm may produce inflammation. Some\r\npractitioners bleed at first, and it is far from bad practice; for\r\nalthough the majority of cases will yield to turpentine, opium, and\r\naloes, an early bleeding may occasionally prevent the recurrence of\r\ninflammation, or at least mitigate it. If it is clearly a case of colic,\r\nhalf of the first dose may be repeated, with aloes dissolved in warm\r\nwater. The stimulus produced on the inner surface of the bowels by the\r\npurgative, may counteract the irritation that caused the spasm.\r\n\r\nThe belly should be well rubbed with a brush or warm cloth, but not\r\nbruised and injured by the broom-handle rubbed over it, with all their\r\nstrength, by two great fellows. The horse should be walked about or\r\ntrotted moderately. The motion thus produced in the bowels, and the\r\nfriction of one intestine over the other, may relax the spasm, but the\r\nhasty gallop might speedily cause inflammation to succeed to colic.\r\n\r\nClysters of warm water, or containing a solution of aloes, should be\r\ninjected. The patent syringe will here be exceedingly useful. A clyster\r\nof tobacco-smoke may be thrown up as a last resort.\r\n\r\nWhen relief has been obtained, the clothing of the horse, saturated with\r\nperspiration, should be removed, and fresh and dry clothes substituted.\r\nHe should be well littered down in a warm stable or box, and have bran\r\nmashes and lukewarm water for the two or three next days. Some persons\r\ngive gin, or gin and pepper, or even spirit of pimento, in cases of\r\ngripes. This course of proceeding is, however, exceedingly\r\nobjectionable. It may be useful, or even sufficient, in ordinary cases\r\nof colic; but if there should be any inflammation, or tendency to\r\ninflammation, it cannot fail to be highly injurious.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlatulent Colic.\r\n\r\nThis is altogether a different disease from the former. It is not spasm\r\nof the bowels, but inflation of them, from the presence of gas emitted\r\nby undigested food. Whether collected in the stomach, or small or large\r\nintestines, all kinds of vegetable matter are liable to ferment. In\r\nconsequence of this fermentation gas is evolved to a greater or less\r\nextent--perhaps to twenty or thirty times the bulk of the food. This may\r\ntake place in the stomach; and if so, the life of the horse is in\r\nimmediate danger, for the animal has no power to expel this dangerous\r\nflatus by eructation.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_, according to Professor Stewart, are, \"The horse suddenly\r\nslackening his pace, preparing to lie down, or falling down, as if he\r\nwere shot. In the stable he paws the ground with his fore-feet, lies\r\ndown, rolls, starts up all at once, and throws himself down again with\r\ngreat violence, looking wistfully at his flanks, and making many\r\nfruitless attempts to void his urine.\"\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is considerably different from that of spasmodic colic.\r\nThe spirit of pimento would be here allowed, or the turpentine and opium\r\ndrink; but if the pain, and especially the swelling, do not abate, the\r\ngas, which is the cause of it, must be got rid of, or the animal is\r\ninevitably lost. This is usually, or almost invariably, a combination\r\nof hydrogen with some other gas. It has a strong affinity for chlorine.\r\nThen if some compound of chlorine--the chloride of lime--dissolved in\r\nwater, is administered in the form of a drink, the chlorine separates\r\nfrom the lime as soon as it comes in contact with the hydrogen, and\r\nmuriatic gas is formed. This gas, having a strong affinity for water, is\r\nabsorbed by any fluid that may be present, and, quitting its gaseous\r\nform, either disappears, or does not retain a thousandth part of its\r\nformer bulk. All this may be very rapidly accomplished, for the fluid is\r\nquickly conveyed from the mouth to every part of the intestinal canal.\r\n\r\nWhere these two medicines are not at hand, and the danger is imminent,\r\nthe _trochar_ may be used, in order to open a way for the escape of the\r\ngas. The trochar should be small, but longer than that which is used for\r\nthe cow, and the puncture should be made in the middle of the right\r\nflank, for there the large intestines are most easily reached. It is\r\nonly when the practitioner despairs of otherwise saving the life of the\r\nanimal, that this operation should be attempted. Much of the danger\r\nwould be avoided by using a very small trochar, and by withdrawing it as\r\nsoon as the gas has escaped. The wound in the intestines will then\r\nprobably close, from the innate elasticity of the parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation of the Bowels.\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties of this malady. The first is inflammation of the\r\nexternal coats of the intestines, accompanied by considerable fever, and\r\nusually costiveness. The second is that of the internal or mucous coat,\r\nand almost invariably connected with purging. The muscular coat is that\r\nwhich is oftenest affected. Inflammation of the external coats of the\r\nstomach, whether the peritoneal or muscular, or both, is a very frequent\r\nand fatal disease. It speedily runs its course, and it is of great\r\nconsequence that its early symptoms should be known.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--If the horse has been carefully observed, restlessness and\r\nfever will have been seen to precede the attack. In many cases a direct\r\nshivering fit will occur; the mouth will be hot, and the nose red. The\r\nanimal will soon express the most dreadful pain by pawing, striking at\r\nhis belly, looking wildly at his flanks, groaning, and rolling. The\r\npulse will be quickened and small; the ears and legs cold; the belly\r\ntender, and sometimes hot; the breathing quickened; the bowels costive;\r\nand the animal becoming rapidly and fearfully weak.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ of this disease are, first of all and most frequently,\r\nsudden exposure to cold. If a horse that has been highly fed, carefully\r\ngroomed, and kept in a warm stable, is heated with exercise, and has\r\nbeen during some hours without food, and in this state of exhaustion is\r\nsuffered to drink freely of cold water, or is drenched with rain, or\r\nhave his legs and belly washed with cold water, an attack of\r\ninflammation of the bowels will often follow. An overfed horse,\r\nsubjected to severe and long-continued exertion, if his lungs were\r\npreviously weak, will probably be attacked by inflammation of them; but\r\nif the lungs were sound, the bowels will on the following day be the\r\nseat of disease. Stones in the intestines are an occasional cause of\r\ninflammation, and colic neglected or wrongly treated will terminate in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The treatment of inflammation of the bowels, like that of\r\nthe lungs, should be prompt and energetic. The first and most powerful\r\nmeans of cure will be bleeding. From six to eight or ten quarts of\r\nblood, in fact as much as the horse can bear, should be abstracted as\r\nsoon as possible; and the bleeding repeated to the extent of four or\r\nfive quarts more, if the pain is not relieved and the pulse has not\r\nbecome rounder and fuller. The speedy weakness that accompanies this\r\ndisease, should not deter from bleeding largely. That weakness is the\r\nconsequence of violent inflammation of these parts; and if that\r\ninflammation is subdued by the loss of blood, the weakness will\r\ndisappear. The bleeding should be effected on the first appearance of\r\nthe disease, for there is no malady that more quickly runs its course.\r\n\r\nA strong solution of aloes should immediately follow the bleeding, but,\r\nconsidering the irritable state of the intestines at this period,\r\nguarded by opium. This should be quickly followed by back-raking, and\r\ninjections consisting of warm water, or very thin gruel, in which Epsom\r\nsalts or aloes have been dissolved; and too much fluid can scarcely be\r\nthrown up.\r\n\r\nThe horse should likewise be encouraged to drink plentifully of warm\r\nwater or thin gruel; and draughts, each containing a couple of drachms\r\nof dissolved aloes, with a little opium, should be given every six\r\nhours, until the bowels are freely opened. It will now be prudent to\r\nendeavor to excite considerable external inflammation, as near as\r\npossible to the seat of internal disease, and therefore the whole of the\r\nbelly should be blistered.\r\n\r\nIn a well-marked case of this disease, no time should be lost in\r\napplying fomentations, but the blister at once resorted to. The tincture\r\nof Spanish flies, whether made with spirits of wine or turpentine,\r\nshould be thoroughly rubbed in. The legs should be well bandaged, in\r\norder to restore the circulation in them, and thus lessen the flow of\r\nblood to the inflamed part; and, for the same reason, the horse should\r\nbe warmly clothed, but the air of the stable or box should be cool.\r\n\r\nNo grain or hay should be allowed during the disease, but bran mashes,\r\nand green food if it can be procured. The latter will be the best, and\r\nmay be given without the slightest apprehension of danger. When the\r\nhorse begins to recover, a handful of grain may be given two or three\r\ntimes in the day; and, if the weather is warm, he may be turned into a\r\npaddock for a few hours in the middle of the day. Clysters of gruel\r\nshould be continued for three or four days after the inflammation is\r\nbeginning to subside, and good hand-rubbing applied to the legs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second variety of Inflammation of the Bowels\r\n\r\nAffects the internal or mucous coat, and is generally the consequence of\r\nphysic in too great quantity, or of an improper kind. The purging is\r\nmore violent and continues longer than was intended; the animal shows\r\nthat he is suffering great pain; he frequently looks round at his\r\nflanks; his breathing is laborious, and the pulse is quick and small,\r\nand the mouth is hot and the legs and ears are warm.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Unless the purging is excessive, and the pain and distress\r\ngreat, the surgeon should hesitate at giving any astringent medicine at\r\nfirst; but he should plentifully administer gruel or thin starch, or\r\narrow-root, by the mouth and by clyster, removing all hay and grain, and\r\nparticularly green food. He should thus endeavor to soothe the irritated\r\nsurface of the bowels, while he permits all remains of the purgative to\r\nbe carried off. If, however, twelve hours have passed, and the purging\r\nand the pain remain undiminished, he should continue the gruel, adding\r\nto it chalk, catechu, and opium, repeated every six hours. As soon as\r\nthe purging begins to subside, the astringent medicine should be\r\nlessened in quantity, and gradually discontinued.\r\n\r\nBleeding will rarely be necessary, unless the inflammation is very\r\ngreat, and attended by symptoms of general fever. The horse should be\r\nwarmly clothed, and placed in a comfortable stable, and his legs should\r\nbe hand-rubbed and bandaged.\r\n\r\n_Violent purging_, and attended with much inflammation and fever, will\r\noccur from other causes. Green food will frequently purge; and a horse\r\nworked hard upon it will sometimes scour.\r\n\r\nThe _remedy_ is change of diet, or less labor. Young horses will often\r\nbe strongly purged, without any apparent cause. Astringents should be\r\nused with much caution here. It is probably an effort of nature to get\r\nrid of something that offends. A few doses of gruel will assist in\r\neffecting this purpose, and the purging will cease without astringent\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nMany horses that are not _well ribbed home_ (having too great space\r\nbetween the last rib and the hip-bone) are subject to purging, if more\r\nthan usual exertion is required from them. They are recognised by the\r\nterm of _washy_ horses. They are often free and fleet, but destitute of\r\ncontinuance. They should have rather more than the usual allowance of\r\ngrain, with beans, when at work. A cordial ball, with catechu and opium,\r\nwill often be serviceable either before or after a journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysicking.\r\n\r\nWhen a horse comes from grass to dry food, or from the cool, open air to\r\na heated stable, a dose, or even two doses, of physic may be useful to\r\nprevent the tendency to inflammation, which is the necessary consequence\r\nof so sudden and great a change. To a horse that is becoming too fat, or\r\nhas surfeit, grease, or mange, or that is out of condition from\r\ninactivity of the digestive organs, a dose of physic is often most\r\nserviceable. A horse should be carefully prepared for the action of\r\nphysic. Two or three bran mashes given on that or the preceding day, are\r\nfar from sufficient when a horse is about to be physicked, whether to\r\npromote his condition, or in obedience to custom. Mashes should be given\r\nuntil the dung becomes softened. A less quantity of physic will then\r\nsuffice, and it will more quickly pass through the intestines, and be\r\nmore readily diffused over them.\r\n\r\nFive drachms of aloes, given when the dung has thus been softened, will\r\nact more effectually and much more safely than seven drachms, when the\r\nlower intestines are obstructed by hardened feces. On the day on which\r\nthe physic is given, the horse should have walking exercise, or may be\r\ngently trotted for a quarter of an hour twice in the day; but after the\r\nphysic begins to work, he should not be moved from his stall. Exercise\r\nwould then produce gripes, irritation, and, possibly, dangerous\r\ninflammation. A little hay may be put into the rack. As much mash should\r\nbe given as the horse will eat, and as much water, with the coldness of\r\nit taken off, as he will drink. If, however, he obstinately refuses to\r\ndrink warm water, it is better that he should have it cold, than to\r\ncontinue without taking any fluid; but in such case he should not be\r\nsuffered to take more than a quart at a time, with an interval of at\r\nleast an hour between each draught.\r\n\r\nWhen the purging has ceased, or _the physic is set_, a mash should be\r\ngiven once or twice every day until the next dose is taken, between\r\nwhich and the _setting_ of the first, there should be an interval of a\r\nweek. The horse should recover from the languor and debility occasioned\r\nby the first dose, before he is harassed by a second. Eight or ten\r\ntolerably copious motions, will be perfectly sufficient to answer every\r\ngood purpose, although the groom may not be satisfied unless double the\r\nquantity are procured. The consequence of too strong purgation will be,\r\nthat weakness will hang about the animal for several days or weeks, and\r\ninflammation will often ensue from the over-irritation of the intestinal\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nLong-continued custom has made ALOES the almost invariable purgative of\r\nthe horse, and very properly so; for there is no other at once so sure\r\nand so safe. The Barbadoes aloes, although sometimes very dear, should\r\nalone be used. The dose, with a horse properly prepared, will vary from\r\nfour to seven drachms. Custom has assigned the form of a ball to physic,\r\nbut good sense will in due time introduce the solution of aloes, as\r\nacting more speedily, effectually, and safely.\r\n\r\nThe only other purgative on which dependence can be placed is the\r\nCROTON. The farina or meal of the nut is generally used; but from its\r\nacrimony it should be given in the form of ball, with linseed meal. The\r\ndose varies from a scruple to half a drachm. It acts more speedily than\r\nthe aloes, and without the nausea which they produce; but it causes more\r\nwatery stools, and, consequently, more debility.\r\n\r\nLINSEED OIL is an uncertain but safe purgative, in doses from a pound to\r\na pound and a half. OLIVE OIL is more uncertain, but safe; but CASTOR\r\nOIL, that mild aperient in the human being, is both uncertain and\r\nunsafe. EPSOM SALTS are inefficacious, except in the immense dose of a\r\npound and a half, and then they are not always safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorms.\r\n\r\nThe long white worm (_lumbricus teres_) much resembles the common\r\nearth-worm, and being from six to ten inches in length, inhabits the\r\nsmall intestines. It is a formidable looking animal; and if there are\r\nmany of them, they may consume more than can be spared of the nutritive\r\npart of the food, or the mucus of the bowels. A tight skin, and rough\r\ncoat, and tucked-up belly, are sometimes connected with their presence.\r\nThey are then, however, voided in large quantities.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--A dose of physic will sometimes bring away almost\r\nincredible quantities of them. Calomel is frequently given as a\r\nvermifuge. The seldomer this drug is administered to the horse, the\r\nbetter. When the horse can be spared, a strong dose of physic is an\r\nexcellent vermifuge, so far as the long round worm is concerned. But a\r\nbetter medicine, and not interfering with either the feeding or work of\r\nthe horse, is emetic tartar, with ginger, made into a ball with linseed\r\nmeal and treacle, and given every morning, half an hour before the horse\r\nis fed.\r\n\r\nA smaller, darker colored worm, called the needle-worm, or _ascaris_,\r\ninhabits the larger intestines. Hundreds of them sometimes descend into\r\nthe rectum, and immense quantities have been found in the c[oe]cum.\r\nThese are a more serious nuisance than the former, for they cause a very\r\ntroublesome irritation about the fundament, which sometimes sadly annoys\r\nthe horse. Their existence can generally be discovered by a small\r\nportion of mucus, which, hardening, is found adhering to the anus.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Physic will sometimes bring away great numbers of these\r\nworms; but when there is much irritation about the tail, and much of\r\nthis mucus, indicating that they have descended into the rectum, an\r\ninjection of linseed oil, or of aloes dissolved in warm water, will be a\r\nmore effectual remedy. The tape-worm is seldom found in the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nBots.\r\n\r\nWhile they inhabit the stomach of the horse, cannot give the animal any\r\npain, for they have fastened on the cuticular and insensible coat. They\r\ncannot stimulate the stomach and increase its digestive power, for they\r\nare not on the digestive portion of the stomach. They cannot, by their\r\nroughness, assist the trituration or rubbing down of the food, for no\r\nsuch office is performed in that part of the stomach--the food is\r\nsoftened, not rubbed down. They cannot be injurious to the horse, for he\r\nenjoys the most perfect health when the cuticular part of his stomach is\r\nfilled with them, and their presence is not even suspected until they\r\nappear at the anus.\r\n\r\nThey cannot be removed by medicine, because they are not in that part of\r\nthe stomach in which medicine is usually conveyed; and if they were,\r\ntheir mouths are too deeply buried in the mucus for any medicine, that\r\ncan be safely administered, to affect them; and, last of all, in due\r\ncourse of time they detach themselves, and come away. Therefore, the\r\nwise man will leave them to themselves, or content himself with picking\r\nthem off when they collect under the tail and annoy the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWind-galls.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of the fetlock, there are occasionally found\r\nconsiderable enlargements, oftener on the hind-leg than the fore one,\r\nwhich are denominated _wind-galls_. Between the tendons and other parts,\r\nand wherever the tendons are exposed to pressure or friction, and\r\nparticularly about their extremities, little bags or sacs are placed,\r\ncontaining and suffering to ooze slowly from them, a mucous fluid to\r\nlubricate the parts. From undue pressure, and that most frequently\r\ncaused by violent action and straining of the tendons, or often from\r\nsome predisposition about the horse, these little sacs are injured. They\r\ntake on inflammation, and sometimes become large and indurated. There\r\nare few horses perfectly free from them. When they first appear, and\r\nuntil the inflammation subsides, they may be accompanied by some degree\r\nof lameness; but otherwise, except when they attain a great size, they\r\ndo not interfere with the action of the animal, or cause any\r\nconsiderable unsoundness. The farriers used to suppose that they\r\ncontained wind--hence their name, wind-galls; and hence the practice of\r\nopening them, by which dreadful inflammation was often produced, and\r\nmany a valuable horse destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--A slight wind-gall will scarcely be subjected to treatment;\r\nbut if these tumors are numerous and large, and seem to impede the\r\nmotion of the limb, they may be attacked first by bandage. The roller\r\nshould be of flannel, and soft pads should be placed on each of the\r\nenlargements, and bound down tightly upon them. The bandage should also\r\nbe wetted with warm water, two or three times a day, for half an hour\r\neach time. The wind-gall will often diminish or disappear by this\r\ntreatment, but will too frequently return, when the horse is again\r\nhardly worked.\r\n\r\nA blister is a more effectual, but too often temporary remedy. _Firing_\r\nis still more certain, if the tumors are sufficiently large and annoying\r\nto justify our having recourse to measures so severe; for it will not\r\nonly effect the immediate absorption of the fluid, and the reduction of\r\nthe swelling, but, by contracting the skin, will act as a permanent\r\nbandage, and therefore prevent the reappearance of the tumor. The iodine\r\nand mercurial ointments have occasionally been used with advantage, in\r\nthe proportion of three parts of the former to two of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation of the Fetlock.\r\n\r\nThe fetlock-joint is a very complicated one, and from the stress which\r\nis laid on it, and its being the principal seat of motion below the\r\nknee, it is particularly subject to injury. There are not many cases of\r\nsprain of the back-sinew, that are not accompanied by inflammation of\r\nthe ligaments of this joint; and numerous supposed cases of sprain\r\nhigher up, are simple affections of the fetlock. It requires a great\r\ndeal of care, and some experience, to distinguish the one from the\r\nother. The heat about the part, and the point at which the horse least\r\nendures the pressure of the finger, will be the principal guides.\r\n\r\n_Remedy._--Occasionally, by the application of cooling lotions, the\r\ninflammation may be subdued, but at other times, the horse suffers\r\ndreadfully, and is unable to stand. A serious affection of the\r\nfetlock-joint demands prompt treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the fetlock is often bruised by the shoe or the hoof of\r\nthe opposite foot. Many expedients used to be tried to remove this; the\r\ninside heel has been raised and lowered, and the outside raised and\r\nlowered; and sometimes one operation has succeeded, and sometimes the\r\ncontrary; and there was no point so involved in obscurity or so\r\ndestitute of principles to guide the practitioner.\r\n\r\n_Remedy._--The most successful remedy and that which in the great\r\nmajority of cases supersedes all others, is Mr. Turner's shoe, of equal\r\nthickness from heel to toe, and having but one nail, and that near the\r\ntoe, on the inside of the shoe; care being taken that the shoe shall not\r\nextend beyond the edge of the crust, and that the crust shall be rasped\r\na little at the quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSprain of the Coffin-Joint.\r\n\r\nThe proof of this is when the lameness is sudden, and the heat and\r\ntenderness are principally felt round the coronet.\r\n\r\n_Remedy._--Bleeding at the toe, physic, fomentation, and blisters, are\r\nthe usual means adopted. This lameness is not easily removed, even by a\r\nblister; and if removed, like sprains of the fetlock and of the\r\nback-sinews, it is apt to return, and finally produce a great deal of\r\ndisorganization and mischief in the foot. Sprain of the coffin-joint\r\nsometimes becomes a very serious affair. Not being always attended by\r\nany external swelling, and being detected only by heat round the\r\ncoronet, the seat of the lameness is often overlooked by the groom and\r\nthe farrier; and the disease is suffered to become confirmed before its\r\nnature is discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nRingbone.\r\n\r\nThis is a deposite of bony matter in one of the pasterns, and usually\r\nnear the joint. It rapidly spreads, and involves not only the\r\npastern-bones, but the cartilages of the foot, and spreading around the\r\npasterns and cartilages, thus derives its name. When the first deposite\r\nis on the lower pastern, and on both sides of it, and produced by\r\nviolent inflammation of the ligaments of the joints, it is recognised by\r\na slight enlargement, or bony tumor on each side of the foot, and just\r\nabove the coronet.\r\n\r\nHorses with short upright joints, and with small feet and high action,\r\nare oftenest, as may be supposed, the subjects of this disease, which is\r\nthe consequence either of concussion or sprain of the pastern-joints. It\r\nis also more frequent in the hind foot than the fore, because, from the\r\nviolent action of the hind legs in propelling the horse forward, the\r\npasterns are more subject to ligamentary injury behind than before; yet\r\nthe lameness is not so great there, because the disease is confined\r\nprincipally to the ligaments, and the bones have not been injured by\r\nconcussion; while, from the position of the fore limbs, there will\r\ngenerally be in them injury of the bones to be added to that of the\r\nligaments.\r\n\r\n_Remedy._--In its early stage, and when recognised only by a bony\r\nenlargement on both sides of the pastern-joint, or in a few cases on one\r\nside only, the lameness is not very considerable, and it is not\r\nimpossible to remove the disease by active blistering, or by the\r\napplication of the cautery; but there is so much wear and tear in this\r\npart of the animal, that the inflammation and the disposition to the\r\nformation of bone rapidly spread. The pasterns first become connected\r\ntogether by bone instead of ligament, and thence results what is called\r\nan anchylosed or fixed joint. From this joint the disease proceeds to\r\nthe cartilages of the foot, and to the union between the lower pastern,\r\nand the coffin and navicular bones. The motion of these parts likewise\r\nis impeded or lost, and the whole of the foot becomes one mass of spongy\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnlargement of the Hock.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is inflammation, or _sprain of the hock-joint generally_,\r\narising from sudden violent concussion, by some check at speed, or\r\nover-weight, and attended with enlargement of the whole joint, and great\r\ntenderness and lameness.\r\n\r\n_Remedy._--This, however, like all other diffused inflammations, is not\r\nso untractable as an intense one of a more circumscribed nature, and by\r\nrest and fomentation, or, perchance, firing, the limb recovers its\r\naction, and the horse becomes fit for ordinary work. The swelling,\r\nhowever, does not always subside. Enlargement, spread over the whole of\r\nthe hock-joint, remains.\r\n\r\nA horse with an enlarged hock must always be regarded with suspicion. In\r\ntruth, he is unsound. The parts, altered in structure, must be to a\r\ncertain degree weakened. The animal may discharge his usual work during\r\na long period, without return of lameness; but if one of those\r\nemergencies should occur when all his energies require to be exerted,\r\nthe disorganized and weakened part will fail. He may be ridden or driven\r\nmoderately for many a year without inconvenience, yet one extra hard\r\nday's work may lame him forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurb.\r\n\r\nThere are often injuries of particular parts of the hock-joint. _Curb_\r\nis an affection of this kind. It is an enlargement at the back of the\r\nhock, three or four inches below its point. It is either a strain of the\r\nring-like ligament which binds the tendons in their place, or of the\r\nsheath of the tendons; oftener, however, of the ligament than of the\r\nsheath. Any sudden action of the limb of more than usual violence may\r\nproduce it, and therefore horses are found to throw out curbs after a\r\nhardly-contested race, an extraordinary leap, a severe gallop over heavy\r\nground, or a sudden check in the gallop.\r\n\r\nYoung horses are particularly liable to it, and horses that are\r\n_cow-hocked_, whose hocks and legs resemble those of the cow, the hocks\r\nbeing turned inwards, and legs forming a considerable angle outwards.\r\nThis is intelligible enough; for in hocks so formed, the annular\r\nligament must be continually on the stretch, in order to confine the\r\ntendon. Curbs are generally accompanied by considerable lameness at\r\ntheir first appearance, but the swelling is not always great. They are\r\nbest detected by observing the leg sidewise.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The first object in attempting the cure, is to abate\r\ninflammation, and this will be most readily accomplished by cold\r\nevaporating lotions, frequently applied to the part. Equal portions of\r\nspirit of wine, water, and vinegar, will afford an excellent\r\napplication. It will be almost impossible to keep a bandage on. If the\r\nheat and lameness are considerable, it will be prudent to give a dose of\r\nphysic, and to bleed from the subcutaneous vein, whose course is near\r\nit; and whether the injury is of the annular ligament, or the sheath of\r\nthe tendon, more active means will be necessary to perfect a cure.\r\n\r\nEither a liquid blister should be rubbed on the part, consisting of a\r\nvinus or turpentine tincture of cantharides, and this daily applied\r\nuntil some considerable swelling takes place; or, what is the preferable\r\nplan, the hair should be cut off, and the part blistered as soon as the\r\nheat has been subdued. The blister should be repeated, until the\r\nswelling has disappeared, and the horse goes sound.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases it may be necessary _to fire_; but a fair trial,\r\nhowever, should be given to milder measures. If the iron is used, it\r\nshould be applied in straight lines.\r\n\r\nThere are few lamenesses in which absolute and long-continued rest is\r\nmore requisite. It leaves the parts materially weakened, and, if the\r\nhorse is soon put to work again, the lameness will frequently return. No\r\nhorse that has had curbs, should be put even to ordinary work in less\r\nthan a month after the apparent cure; and, even then he should very\r\ngradually resume his former habits.\r\n\r\nA horse with a curb, is manifestly unsound, or generally condemned as\r\nunsound. Curb is also an hereditary complaint; and therefore a horse\r\nthat has once suffered from it, should always be regarded with\r\nsuspicion, especially if either of the parents have exhibited it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBone Spavin.\r\n\r\nThis is an affection of the bones of the hock-joint. Spavined horses are\r\ngenerally capable of slow work. They are equal to the greater part of\r\nthe work of the farm, and therefore they should not always be rejected\r\nby the small farmer, as they may generally be procured at a small price.\r\nThese horses are not only capable of agricultural work, but they\r\ngenerally improve under it. The lameness in some degree abates, and even\r\nthe bony tumor to a certain degree lessens. There is sufficient moderate\r\nmotion and friction of the limb to rouse the absorbents to action, and\r\ncause them to take up a portion of the bony matter thrown out, but not\r\nenough to renew or prolong inflammation. It cannot be said that the plow\r\naffords a _cure_ for spavin, but the spavined horse often materially\r\nimproves while working at it. For fast work, and for work that must be\r\nregularly performed, spavined horses are not well calculated; for this\r\nlameness behind produces great difficulty in rising, and the\r\nconsciousness that he will not be able to rise without painful effort,\r\noccasionally prevents the horse from lying down at all; and the animal\r\nthat cannot rest well, cannot long travel far or fast.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The treatment of spavin is simple enough, but far from\r\nbeing always effectual. The owner of the horse will neither consult his\r\nown interest, nor the dictates of humanity, if he suffers the chisel and\r\nmallet, or the gimlet, or the pointed iron, or arsenic to be used; yet\r\nmeasures of considerable severity must be resorted to. Repeated blisters\r\nwill usually cause either the absorption of the bony deposite, or the\r\nabatement or removal of the inflammation of the ligaments, or, as a last\r\nresource, the heated iron may be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwelled Legs.\r\n\r\nThe fore-legs, but oftener the hind ones, and especially in coarse\r\nhorses, are sometimes subject to considerable enlargement. Occasionally,\r\nwhen the horse does not seem to labor under any other disease, and\r\nsometimes from an apparent shifting of disease from other parts, the\r\nhind legs suddenly swell to an enormous degree from the hock, and almost\r\nfrom the stifle to the fetlock, attended by a greater or less degree of\r\nheat, and tenderness of the skin, and sometimes excessive and very\r\npeculiar lameness. The pulse likewise becomes quick and hard, and the\r\nhorse evidently labors under considerable fever. It is acute\r\ninflammation of the cellular substance of the legs, and that most sudden\r\nin its attack, and most violent n its degree, and therefore attended by\r\nthe effusion of a considerable quantity of fluid into the cellular\r\nmembrane. It occurs in young horses, and in those which are over-fed and\r\nlittle exercised.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Fomentation, diuretics, or purgatives, or, if there is much\r\nfever, a moderate bleeding, will often relieve the distention almost as\r\nsuddenly as it appeared. Mild cases will generally yield to their\r\ninfluence; but, if the animal has been neglected, the treatment must be\r\ndecisive. If the horse is in high condition, these should be preceded or\r\naccompanied by bleeding; but if there are any symptoms of debility,\r\nbleeding would only increase the want of tone in the vessels.\r\n\r\nHorses taken from grass and brought into close stables, very speedily\r\nhave swelled legs, because the difference of food and increase of\r\nnutriment rapidly increase the quantity of the circulating fluid, while\r\nthe want of exercise takes away the means by which it might be got rid\r\nof. The remedy here is sufficiently plain.\r\n\r\nSwelled legs, however, may proceed from general debility. They may be\r\nthe consequence of starvation, or disease that has considerably weakened\r\nthe animal; and these parts, being farthest from the centre of\r\ncirculation, are the first to show the loss of power by the accumulation\r\nof fluid in them. Here the means of cure would be to increase the\r\ngeneral strength, with which the extremities would sympathize. Mild\r\ndiuretics and tonics would therefore be evidently indicated.\r\n\r\nHorses in the spring and fall are subject to swelled legs. The powers of\r\nthe constitution are principally employed in providing a new coat for\r\nthe animal, and the extremities have not their share of vital influence.\r\nMingled cordials and diuretics are indicated here; the diuretic to\r\nlessen the quantity of the circulating fluid, and the cordial to\r\ninvigorate the frame.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrease.\r\n\r\nSwelled legs, although distinct from grease, is a disease that is apt to\r\ndegenerate into it. Grease is a specific inflammation of the skin of the\r\nheels, sometimes of the fore-feet, but oftener of the hinder ones. Bad\r\nstable management is the true cause of it. Grease is a local complaint.\r\nThe heel should be well but gently washed with soap and water, and as\r\nmuch of the scurf detached as is easily removable. An ointment should\r\nbe applied, to supple, cool, and heal the part.\r\n\r\nWhen _cracks_ appear, the mode of treatment will depend on their extent\r\nand depth. If the cracks are deep, with an ichorous discharge and\r\nconsiderable lameness, it will be necessary to poultice the heel. A\r\npoultice of linseed meal will be generally effective, unless the\r\ndischarge is thin and offensive, when an ounce of finely-powdered\r\ncharcoal should be mixed with the linseed meal; or a poultice of\r\ncarrots, boiled soft and mashed. After the chaps or cracks have healed,\r\nthe legs will sometimes continue gorged and swelled. A flannel bandage,\r\nevenly applied over the whole of the swelled part, will be very\r\nserviceable; or should the season admit of it, a run at grass,\r\nparticularly spring grass, should be allowed.\r\n\r\nThe feeding should likewise vary with the case, but with these rules,\r\nwhich admit of no exception; that green food should be given, and more\r\nespecially carrots, when they are not too expensive; and mashes, if the\r\nhorse will eat them; and never the full allowance of grain.\r\n\r\nWalking exercise should be resorted to as soon as the horse is able to\r\nbear it, and this by degrees may be increased to a gentle trot.\r\n\r\nFrom bad stable-management at first, and neglect during the disease, a\r\nyet worse kind of grease occasionally appears. The ulceration extends\r\nover the skin of the heel and the fetlock, and a fungus springs from the\r\nsurface of both, highly sensible, bleeding at the slightest touch, and\r\ninterspersed with scabs. By degrees portions of the fungus begin to be\r\ncovered with a horny substance, protruding in the form of knobs, and\r\ncollected together in bunches. These are known by the name of _grapes_.\r\nA f[oe]tid and very peculiar exudation, proceeds from nearly the whole\r\nof the unnatural substance. The horse evidently suffers much, and is\r\ngradually worn down by the discharge. The assistance of a veterinary\r\nsurgeon is here indispensable.\r\n\r\nSome horses are more subject to grease than others, particularly\r\ndraught-horses, both heavy and light, but particularly the former, and\r\nif they have no degree of _blood_ in them. It was the experience of\r\nthis, which partly contributed to the gradual change of coach and other\r\ndraught-horses to those of a lighter breed. In the great majority of\r\ncases, grease arises from mismanagement and neglect.\r\n\r\nEvery thing that has a tendency to excite inflammation in the skin of\r\nthe heel is a cause of grease. Therefore want of exercise is a frequent\r\nsource of this disease. When high feeding is added to irregular or\r\ndeficient exercise, the disease is evidently still more likely to be\r\nproduced. Want of cleanliness in the stable is a fruitful source of\r\ngrease. When the heels are imbedded in filth, they are weakened by the\r\nconstant moisture surrounding them. The absurd practice of washing the\r\nfeet and legs of horses when they come from their work, and either\r\ncarelessly sponging them down afterwards, or leaving them to dry as they\r\nmay, is, however, the most common origin of grease.\r\n\r\nWhen the horse is warmed by his work, and the heels share in the warmth,\r\nthe momentary cold of washing may not be injurious, if the animal is\r\nimmediately rubbed dry; yet even this would be better avoided; but to\r\nwash out the heels, and then leave them partially dry or perfectly wet,\r\nand suffering from the extreme cold that is produced by evaporation from\r\na moist and wet surface, is the most absurd, dangerous, and injurious\r\npractice that can be imagined. It is worse, when the post-horse or the\r\nplow-horse is plunged up to his belly in the river or pond immediately\r\nafter his work.\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting the Hair from the Heels.\r\n\r\nCustom has very properly retained the hair on our farm-horses. Nature\r\nwould not have given it had it not been useful. It guards the heel from\r\nbeing injured by the inequalities of the plowed field, and prevents the\r\ndirt, in which the heels are constantly enveloped, from reaching, and\r\ncaking on, and irritating the skin. When the horse is carefully tended\r\nafter his work is over, and his legs quickly and completely dried, the\r\nless hair he has about them the better, for then both the skin and the\r\nhair can be made perfectly dry before evaporation begins, or proceeds so\r\nfar as to deprive the legs of their heat. Grease is the child of\r\nnegligence and mismanagement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSetons\r\n\r\nAre pieces of tape or cord, passed, by means of an instrument resembling\r\na large needle, either through abscesses, or the base of ulcers with\r\ndeep sinuses, or between the skin and the muscular or other substances\r\nbeneath. They are retained there by the ends being tied together, or by\r\na knot at each end. The tape is moved in the wound twice or thrice in\r\nthe day, and occasionally wetted with spirits of turpentine, or some\r\nacrid fluid, in order to increase the inflammation which it produces,\r\nor the discharge which is intended to be established.\r\n\r\n_In abscesses_, such as occur in the withers or the poll, and when\r\npassed from the summit to the very bottom of the swelling, setons are\r\nhighly useful by discharging the purulent fluid, and suffering any fresh\r\nquantity of it that may be secreted to flow out; and, by the degree of\r\ninflammation which they excite on the interior of the tumor, stimulating\r\nit to throw out healthy granulations, which gradually occupy and fill\r\nthe hollow. In deep fistulous wounds they are indispensable, for except\r\nsome channel is made through which the matter may flow from the bottom\r\nof the wound, it will continue to penetrate deeper into the part, and\r\nthe healing process will never be accomplished. On these accounts, a\r\nseton passing through the base of the ulcer in poll-evil and fistulous\r\nwithers is so beneficial.\r\n\r\n\"Setons are sometimes useful by promoting a discharge in the\r\nneighborhood of an inflamed part, and thus diverting and carrying away a\r\nportion of the fluids which distend or overload the vessels of that\r\npart; thus, a seton is placed with considerable advantage in the cheek,\r\nwhen the eyes are much inflamed.\"--(_Youatt._)\r\n\r\n\r\nFounder,\r\n\r\nOr inflammation of the foot, arises from various causes; excessive\r\nexertion, great heat, and particularly when followed by drinking cold\r\nwater, or overloading the stomach in any way, sudden transition from\r\ngreat cold to excessive heat, and change of inflammation from some other\r\npart.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--When the attack is severe and confined to the fore-feet,\r\nYouatt recommends removing the shoe and paring the hoof as much as\r\npossible, taking four quarts of blood from each toe, placing the feet in\r\nwarm water, and afterwards applying soft poultices of linseed meal to\r\nthe whole foot and pastern. If this is ineffectual, take three quarts of\r\nblood from each foot the succeeding day. It may then be necessary to\r\nblister the foot and coronet. The animal should be kept on green food or\r\nlight mashes, and allowed to run on grass without labor. An effectual\r\ncure has followed from taking off the shoe, and applying lard, raised to\r\nthe boiling point, to every part of the foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoison\r\n\r\nFrom weeds, sometimes gives to horses ulcerated tongues and lips, and\r\nswollen legs and sheath. If there be much inflammation, bleeding should\r\nbe resorted to, then give daily bran mashes, with Glauber salts in doses\r\nof 1/2 to 11/2 pounds, according to the size of the horse, with half a\r\nteaspoonful of saltpetre. Washing the ulcerated parts with warm\r\nsoap-suds, copperas, and sugar-of-lead may follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpidemics among Horses,\r\n\r\nSometimes occur, producing great mortality. One of these was prevalent\r\nin the neighborhood of New York, in 1846, termed a _malarious congestive\r\nfever_, staggers, or apoplexy, which destroyed many valuable animals. It\r\noccurred during the heat of summer, and was principally confined to such\r\nas were at pasture. By many it was attributed to excessive heat and\r\nexposure at night. The animals that were opened, appeared sound in all\r\nrespects excepting the brain, which exhibited one mass of clotted blood.\r\n\r\nThe _remedy_ found to be the most effectual, consisted in taking about\r\none quart of blood from the head, swathing it with cloths saturated with\r\ncold water, and giving two drachms daily of calomel. The horse should be\r\nkept in a cool stable.\r\n\r\nA similar disease in Spain is cured by copious bleeding, and swathing\r\nthe head in blankets constantly wet with hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation of the Eyes.\r\n\r\nShut up in a dark stable, and feed on fresh-cut grass and bran mashes.\r\nBleed freely from the mouth, and give 11/2 lbs. Glauber salts, 2 drachms\r\nnitre, and 15 grains tartarized antimony, dissolved in a bucket of\r\nwater, which the animal will drink when thirsty. This to be repeated\r\ndaily till purging is effected. If it fails, bleed from the large veins\r\njust below the eye, taking 15 to 20 ounces of blood.--(_Dr. Campbell._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sting of Hornets,\r\n\r\nBees, or snakes, may be relieved by immediate external application of\r\nstrong spirits of hartshorn: salt and vinegar are also good.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Sprains,\r\n\r\nTake a mixture of one ounce sweet oil, four ounces spirits of hartshorn,\r\nhalf an ounce oil of thyme, and rub with it frequently. The remedies\r\nmentioned below are also effectual for sprains.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a Bruise or Blow.\r\n\r\nApply hot water a long time with wet cloths. Beef brine is an excellent\r\nlotion for both sprains and bruises. A veteran among horses, claims,\r\nthat it will almost set a joint or heal a fracture. Wormwood or tansy\r\nlotions are also good.\r\n\r\n\r\nFistula.\r\n\r\nThis is frequently cured by repeated applications of salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds\r\n\r\nShould be washed twice a day with clean, soft water, or with a little\r\nCastile soap added, and then rub with whale-oil. This answers for all\r\nseasons, keeps off flies, restores the hair, and of the original color.\r\n\r\n\r\nGalls,\r\n\r\nOr wounds on the back from the saddle, are most effectually healed by\r\nwhite-lead, moistened with sweet-oil or milk. The saddle ought always to\r\nfit easily and be well padded, and it should be taken off and the\r\nanimal's back washed at every baiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nShoeing.\r\n\r\nThis is an important operation, and should never be attempted but under\r\nthe supervision of an experienced person; nor ought the shoes to remain\r\nso long as to produce contraction of the hoof, which is followed by\r\nlameness and corns. They should be reset as often as every five or six\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nContraction of the Foot.\r\n\r\nThis is also caused by standing on the dry stable for some days. In this\r\ncase, the hoof should be stopped with fresh cow-manure and clay, or with\r\na thick felt, soaked in water, and cut to suit the foot. This is also a\r\ngood application over night, for horses that have accomplished a hard\r\nday's work on a dry road.\r\n\r\n\r\nLitter.\r\n\r\nThis is not objectionable to the feet, if clean and not too damp. Some\r\nsuppose this the cause of contraction, but it is the reverse. It is\r\nbesides of great benefit when shook out for a bed, by inducing the\r\nhorse to rest himself. He is thus enabled to do more work, and with a\r\nless expenditure of food.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorns.\r\n\r\nIn the angle between the bars and the quarters, the horn of the sole has\r\nsometimes a red appearance, and is more spongy and softer than at any\r\nother part. The horse flinches when this portion of the horn is pressed\r\nupon, and occasional or permanent lameness is produced. This disease of\r\nthe foot is termed _corns_; bearing this resemblance to the corn of the\r\nhuman being, that it is produced by pressure, and is a cause of\r\nlameness. When corns care neglected, so much inflammation is produced in\r\nthat part of the sensible sole, that suppuration follows, and to that,\r\n_quittor_ succeeds, and the matter either undermines the horny sole, or\r\nis discharged at the coronet.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The cure of old corns is difficult; for as all shoeing has\r\nsome tendency to produce pressure here, the habit of throwing out this\r\ndiseased horn is difficult to get rid of when once contracted; recent\r\ncorns, however, will yield to good shoeing. The first thing to be done\r\nis well to pare out the angle between the crust and the bars. Two\r\nobjects are answered by this; the extent of the disease will be\r\nascertained, and one cause of it removed. A very small drawing-knife\r\nmust be used for this purpose. The corn must be pared out to the very\r\nbottom, taking care not to wound the sole. It may then be discovered\r\nwhether there is any effusion of blood or matter underneath. If this is\r\nsuspected, an opening must be made through the horn, the matter\r\nevacuated, the separated horn taken away, the course and extent of the\r\nsinuses explored, and introduce into them a _saturated solution of\r\nsulphate of zinc_, by means of a small syringe. Place over this dressing\r\nthe common cataplasm, or the turpentine ointment, and renew the\r\napplication every twenty-four hours. Three or four such applications\r\ncomplete a cure.\r\n\r\nShould there be no collection of fluid, the butyr of antimony should be\r\napplied over the whole extent of the corn, after the horn has been\r\nthinned as closely as possible. The object of this is to stimulate the\r\nsole to throw out more healthy horn. In bad cases, a bar-shoe may be put\r\non, so chambered that there shall be no pressure on the diseased part.\r\nThis may be worn for one or two shoeings, but not constantly, for there\r\nare few frogs that would bear the constant pressure of the bar-shoe;\r\nand the want of pressure on the heel, generally occasioned by their use,\r\nwould produce a softened and bulbous state of the heels, that would of\r\nitself be an inevitable source of lameness. Turning out to grass, after\r\nthe horn is a little grown, first with a bar-shoe, and afterwards with\r\nthe shoe fettered on one side, or with tips, will often be serviceable.\r\nA horse that has once had corns to any considerable extent should, at\r\nevery shoeing, have the seat of corn well pared out, and the butyr of\r\nantimony applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Over-reach\r\n\r\nIs a tread upon the heel of the coronet of the fore foot, by the shoe of\r\nthe corresponding hind foot, and either inflicted by the toe, or by the\r\ninner edge of the inside of the shoe.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ is the bevelling, or rounding off of the\r\ninside edge or rim of the hind shoes.\r\n\r\n_The cure_ is the cutting away of the loose parts, the application of\r\nFriar's balsam, and protection from the dirt.\r\n\r\n\r\nForging, or Clicking,\r\n\r\n\"Is a singular species of over-reaching. The horse, in the act of\r\ntrotting, strikes the toes of the hind shoes against the fore one. This\r\nnoise of the clicking is unpleasant, and the trick or habit is not\r\naltogether free from danger. It is most frequent in young horses, and is\r\nattributable to too great activity, or length of stride in the hind\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The rider may do something by keeping the head of the horse\r\nwell up; but the smith may effect more by making the hind shoes of\r\nclicking horses short in the toe, and having the web broad. When they\r\nare too long, they are apt to be torn off; when too narrow, the hind\r\nfoot may bruise the sole of the fore one, or may be locked fast between\r\nthe branches of the fore shoe.\"--_Youatt._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bearing Rein\r\n\r\nIs a matter of much controversy; some claiming that it should be\r\nentirely abolished, while others as strenuously contend for its almost\r\nuniversal use. Nimrod, who is deemed perfectly competent authority,\r\ninsists on its use with fast roadsters and coach-horses. With\r\nteam-horses, it may generally be dispensed with, and always should be in\r\nascending hills, as it materially diminishes their capacity for\r\nexertion. The fault in its use is its excessive tightness, and when\r\nstanding, the horse ought never to be tormented with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.\r\n\r\nSafety Rein illustrated.]\r\n\r\n_Directions for use of Safety Rein._--In putting on the rein for a gig,\r\nkeep the buckle to the left hand, or near side; that will place the\r\nloop, which is on the middle of the rein, below the hook or head of the\r\nbridle, which prevents it from being thrown out by the motion of the\r\nhorse's head. For a pair of horses, keep the two short chapes outmost,\r\nand the loops on the middle downward. For saddle, keep the buckle to the\r\nleft hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the rein is used either for running, rearing, kicking, or going\r\nbackward, it should be applied suddenly with a strong arm, keeping up\r\nthe pressure until the horse is still; it should then be relieved\r\nsuddenly, at the same time motioning the horse to go on. If he is only a\r\nrunaway he will obey it at once, such horses being generally of a\r\nwilling, good temper. After the horse has been a few times firmly\r\ngripped with it, use it occasionally, instead of the bit-rein, to stop\r\nhim on ordinary occasions; this will remind the horse of his subjection,\r\nand will accustom the rider or driver to the ready and accurate use of\r\nit in case of an emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bit\r\n\r\nIs a frequent cause of injury to the mouth of the horse, fretting and\r\nteasing him, and in many cases inducing permanent injury and\r\nviciousness. It should never be made annoying to the horse beyond the\r\nabsolute necessity for his proper restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Unruly Stud may be controlled\r\n\r\nBy passing the rein from the ring on the off-side over the head and\r\nthrough the left ring. This gives a purchase to the groom which the\r\nhorse cannot resist.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlinds\r\n\r\nHave for a long time been fashionable, but in few cases are necessary,\r\nwhile in nearly all they are decidedly injurious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.\r\n\r\nThe Crib Biter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crib Biter.\r\n\r\nThis small instrument is made entirely of iron, and riveted firmly to\r\nthe head-stall. It answers the threefold purpose, to prevent biting,\r\ncrib-biting, and wind-sucking. All of the foregoing are bad habits for\r\nhorses, for which there is no effectual cure, but in adopting the use of\r\nthe above implement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stable\r\n\r\nIs an important matter connected with the proper management of horses.\r\nThis should be as much as possible of a uniform temperature, cool in\r\nsummer, warm in winter, and always clean, dry, and well-ventilated. But\r\nno air must be allowed to blow directly upon the animal. The horse is a\r\nnative of a warm climate, and ought to be well protected against cold.\r\nThe stable should be neither too light nor too dark, nor must the light\r\never be admitted before the eye of the horse. For judicious and extended\r\narrangement of stables, and management of horses, the inquiring reader\r\nis referred to _Stewart's Stable Economy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ASS, THE MULE, AND THE COMPARATIVE LABOR OF WORKING ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASS\r\n\r\nIs a native of Arabia, Persia, and the central parts of Asia and Africa.\r\nLike the horse, he goes in troops and displays great natural sagacity,\r\nactivity, and courage. Job says, \"He scorneth the multitude of the city,\r\nneither regardeth the crying of the driver.\" Like the horse, too, he has\r\nfrom time immemorial been tamed, and become the faithful servant of man;\r\nbut unlike him, he is subject to few maladies, is hardy and enduring,\r\nand subsists and even thrives on coarse and scanty forage. Thus Job says\r\nof his natural haunts, \"Whose house I have made the _wilderness_, and\r\nthe _barren land_ his dwellings; the range of the _mountains_ is his\r\npasture, and he searcheth after _every green thing_.\" Xenophon, in his\r\nAnabasis, a thousand years later, says of one of the Asiatic deserts\r\nthrough which he passed with the army of Cyrus, \"that it was full of\r\nwormwood; if any other kinds of shrubs or reeds grew there, they had all\r\nan aromatic smell; but no trees appeared. Of wild creatures, the most\r\nnumerous are _wild asses_, which our horses sometimes chased; but the\r\nwild asses exceeded them much in speed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVarieties.\r\n\r\nThe different breeds of asses are supposed to be quite as numerous as\r\nthose of the horse. Four distinct races are mentioned in the earliest\r\nscriptures. In modern times we find a similar diversity. There are two\r\nkinds in Persia, the largest a slow, heavy brute, used only for burdens;\r\nthe other smaller and more spirited, and used for the saddle. In Egypt,\r\na considerable though less marked difference exists, those near the\r\nDelta being inferior to those which are bred in Upper Egypt and Nubia.\r\nIn Spain, a difference in size and spirit prevails, greater even than in\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nThe _Zebra_ is nearly allied in size, shape, and character to the wild\r\nass, but his untameable ferocity has hitherto effectually bid defiance,\r\nalike to the scourges and caresses, the frowns and the favors of man.\r\n\r\nArabia produces some of the most spirited and hardy asses, but their\r\nsize, like that of their horses, is too small for purposes of the\r\ngreatest utility. The Maltese Jack is by American breeders deemed the\r\nchoicest animal from which to propagate. He is evidently of Arabian\r\ndescent, and possesses all the good qualities of his ancestry, with\r\nconsiderable additional size.\r\n\r\nWe have several varieties, all of which are imported, as there are no\r\nnatives of the Western Continent. The early importations were\r\nprincipally made from the Azores, and Cape de Verd Islands, and were\r\nmostly of an inferior character. A superior Maltese Jack was presented\r\nto Gen. Washington, in 1787, by La Fayette, and is believed to be the\r\nfirst ever sent to this country. Mr. Custis describes him as of moderate\r\nsize, clean-limbed, possessing great activity, the fire and ferocity of\r\na tiger, of a dark brown and nearly black, with white belly and muzzle,\r\nand manageable only by one groom, nor then safely. He lived to a great\r\nage. His mules were all active, spirited, and serviceable, and when from\r\nstout mares, attained considerable size.\r\n\r\nA Spanish Jack and Jennet were also presented to Washington about the\r\nsame time, by the King of Spain. The first is characterized by the same\r\nauthority, as a huge, ill-shapen animal, nearly 16 hands high, very\r\nlarge head, clumsy limbs, and to all appearance little calculated for\r\nactive service; he was of a gray color, and not much valued for his\r\nmules, which were unwieldy and dull. From the Maltese Jack and Spanish\r\nJennet, which approach the size of the large Spanish Jack, was bred a\r\nvaluable animal, _Compound_, which partook of all the good qualities of\r\nthe sire, with the weight of the dam. From him descended many of the\r\nbest mules of Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nMany other valuable importations followed these animals, and it is\r\nbelieved we have for many years had as fine specimens of the ass as the\r\nworld affords.\r\n\r\nJennets, or she-asses, are used among us principally for breeding Jacks,\r\nand of course are not numerous. They are sometimes, though seldom, bred\r\nto the horse. It is difficult to induce the horse to notice them, and\r\nthe produce, which is called a _hinny_, is less hardy and useful than\r\nthe mule. The milk of the she-ass is lighter and more digestible than\r\nthat of any other animal, and in former times was in great request for\r\ninvalids.\r\n\r\nThe ass is occasionally used in the cart, or as a beast of burden. Such\r\nas are employed for these purposes are generally of an inferior kind,\r\nand are only used for the lightest work. They may sometimes be seen\r\namong the fishmongers and small vegetable dealers about our city\r\nmarkets, but little larger than a Newfoundland dog or Shetland pony,\r\ntrundling along a light cart with a wheelbarrow load. In ancient times\r\nthey have been, and in foreign countries--even at the present time, they\r\nare extensively used. But the most enlightened of the moderns have\r\nadopted the mule as the proper and almost exclusive substitute for the\r\nass; and it would show a still greater intelligence and economy, if it\r\nmuch more extensively took the place of the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MULE\r\n\r\nIs the hybrid produced by the ass with the mare. How early this animal\r\nwas bred, is uncertain, but we know he was in high repute in the reign\r\nof David, near 3,000 years ago, for he was rode by Absalom, the favorite\r\nprince of Israel, on the field of battle. They have from time immemorial\r\nbeen bred in various parts of the East, on the borders of the\r\nMediterranean, and throughout Spain, Portugal, and other countries, many\r\nof them being of splendid appearance and of fine qualities. In these\r\ncountries, they are frequently used by the grandees and nobles, and\r\nindeed by royalty itself; and however much they may be undervalued\r\nelsewhere, when they are finely bred and trained, and richly\r\ncaparisoned, they exhibit a stateliness and bearing, that few of the\r\nhighest bred horses can match.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding Mules in the United States,\r\n\r\nWas commenced with much spirit in some of the New England states, soon\r\nafter the American revolution. The object was not to breed them for\r\ntheir own use, but only as an article of commerce. They were at first\r\nshipped exclusively to the West Indies; and afterwards to the South and\r\nWest, for employment in the various work of the plantation. Indifferent\r\nanimals, both as sires and dams, were used at first, as any thing which\r\nbore the name of mule, then commanded a ready sale. The progeny were\r\nnecessarily inferior brutes, and viewed with almost universal derision;\r\nand being considered the type of their race, a prejudice was excited\r\nagainst them, which more than half a century has not been sufficient to\r\ndispel.\r\n\r\nAmong a few thinking men at the North, they have been adopted and made\r\nhighly useful in the various duties of the farm. They have been largely\r\nintroduced at the South and West, but principally in the slave states,\r\nwhere the management of the team devolves upon the ignorant and\r\nheedless. It is there, and in other and hotter climates, that the\r\nsuperior merits of the mule over the horse as a laboring animal, are\r\npeculiarly manifest. In many instances they are indifferently fed,\r\nhardly worked, and greatly neglected by their drivers; yet they sustain\r\nthemselves for years, in defiance of usage that would annihilate two\r\ngenerations of horses. Their powers have been largely increased and\r\ntheir merits improved, by the introduction of some of the best Maltese\r\nand Spanish Jacks, and the use of large, blood mares. The propriety of\r\nthis course is seen in the value of the product; for while some of the\r\ninferior are unsaleable at $50, others of the same age, and reared under\r\nthe same circumstances of keep and condition, could not be purchased for\r\n$150.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Breeding, Rearing, and Management of Mules\r\n\r\nIs similar to that of colts. They will be found, equally with horses, to\r\nrepay generous keep and attention, by their increased and rapid growth.\r\nBut they should not be pampered by high feed, as it not only has a\r\ntendency to produce disease, but to form habits of fastidiousness, which\r\nmaterially lessens their economical feeding in after life. The diseases\r\nto which mules are subjected, (which are always few, and if properly\r\nmanaged will seldom or ever occur,) require a treatment like that of\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n_The breeding from mules_ has sometimes been questioned, but it has been\r\ndemonstrated in several instances. Neither the sexual development nor\r\npropensities are wanting, but they are seldom indulged with effect. Mr.\r\nKilby, of Virginia, states in the Farmer's Register, that a mare mule\r\nbrought two colts from a young horse, which they closely resembled. The\r\nfirst was a male, and died, apparently with staggers, which no treatment\r\ncould arrest, at six months old. The second was a female, 16 months\r\nyounger than the first, marked like the sire, being jet-black,\r\nexcepting a white foot and star in the forehead, and died at a year old,\r\nafter two days' illness, notwithstanding the utmost care was bestowed\r\nupon it. Successful propagation of this hybrid, however, beyond the\r\nfirst cross, seems to be incompatible with the fixed laws of nature.\r\n\r\nWith a view of encouraging the substitution of mules for a part of the\r\nhorses now employed in American husbandry, we give the following\r\ntestimony from experienced individuals, of great intelligence and\r\ncareful observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF MULE OVER HORSE LABOR.\r\n\r\nThe official report of an agricultural committee in South Carolina, in\r\n1824, says:--\"The annual expense of keeping a horse is equal to his\r\nvalue. A horse at four years old would not often bring more than his\r\ncost. Two mules can be raised at less expense than one horse. The mule\r\nis fit for service earlier, and if of sufficient size, will perform as\r\nmuch labor as the horse; and if attended to when first put to work, his\r\ngait and habits may be formed to suit the owner.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy, who used them near Boston for 30 years, and to such an\r\nextent as to have had more labor performed by them probably than any\r\nperson in New England, says:--\"I am convinced the small breed of mules\r\nwill consume less in proportion to the labor they are capable of\r\nperforming than the larger race, but I shall confine myself to the\r\nlatter in my comparison, such as stand 141/2 to 16 hands, and are capable\r\nof performing any work a horse is usually put to. From repeated\r\nexperiments, I have found that three mules of this description, which\r\nwere constantly at work, consumed about the same quantity of hay, and\r\nonly one-fourth the provender, which was given to two middling-size\r\ncoach-horses, only moderately worked. I am satisfied a large-sized mule\r\nwill not consume more than three-fifths to two-thirds the food to keep\r\nhim in good order, that will be necessary for a horse performing the\r\nsame labor. The expense of shoeing a mule the year round, does not\r\nexceed one-third that of the horse, his hoofs being harder, more horny,\r\nand so slow in their growth, that shoes require no removal, and hold on\r\ntill worn out; and the wear from the lightness of the animal is much\r\nless.\r\n\r\nMules have been lost by feeding on cut straw and corn meal; in no other\r\ninstance have I known disease in them, except by inflammation of the\r\nintestines, caused by the grossest exposure to cold and wet, and\r\nexcessive drinking cold water, after severe labor, and while in a high\r\nstate of perspiration. It is not improbable a farmer may work the same\r\nteam of mules for twenty years, without having a farrier's bill\r\npresented to him.\r\n\r\nIn my experience of thirty years, I have never found but one mule\r\ninclined to be vicious, and he might have been easily subdued while\r\nyoung. I have always found them truer pullers and quicker travellers,\r\nwith a load, than horses. Their vision and hearing are much more\r\naccurate. I have used them in my family carriage, in a gig, and under\r\nthe saddle; and have never known one to start or run from any object or\r\nnoise, a fault in the horse, that continually causes the maiming and\r\ndeath of numerous human beings.\r\n\r\nThe mule is more steady in his draught, and less likely to waste his\r\nstrength than the horse, hence more suitable to work with oxen; and as\r\nhe walks faster, he will habituate them to a faster gait. In plowing\r\namong crops, his feet being small and following each other so much more\r\nin a line, he seldom treads down the ridges or crops. The facility of\r\ninstructing him to obey implicitly the voice of the driver is\r\nastonishing. The best plowed tillage land I ever saw, I have had\r\nperformed by two mules tandem, without lines or driver. The mule is\r\ncapable of enduring labor in a temperature of heat that would be\r\ndestructive to a horse.\r\n\r\nAlthough a large mule will consume something over one-half the food of a\r\nhorse, yet the saving in shoeing, farrying, and insurance against\r\ndiseases and accidents, will amount to at least one-half. In addition,\r\nthe owner may rely with tolerable certainty on the continuance of his\r\nmule capital for thirty years; whereas the horse owner must, at the end\r\nof fifteen years, look to his crops, his acres, or a bank for the\r\nrenewal of his. The longevity of a mule is so proverbial, that a\r\npurchaser seldom inquires his age. Pliny mentions one 80 years old; and\r\nDr. Rees, two in England, that reached the age of 70. I saw one\r\nperforming his labor in a cane-mill in the West Indies, which the owner\r\nassured me was 40 years old. I have now a mare-mule 25 years old, that I\r\nhave had in constant work for 21 years. She has often within a year\r\ntaken a ton weight in a wagon to Boston, five miles, and manifests no\r\ndiminution of her powers. A neighbor has one 28 years old, which he\r\nwould not exchange for any horse in the country. One in Maryland, 35\r\nyears old, is now as capable of labor as at any former period.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hood of Maryland, in the American Farmer, estimates the annual\r\nexpense of a horse for 12 months, at $44, and that of a mule at $22,\r\njust half price, and his working age at more than twice that of the\r\nhorse, and that too after 30 years' experience in keeping both.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the Baltimore Patriot, asserts that \"Col. John E.\r\nHoward had a pair of mules that worked 30 years, after which they were\r\nsold to a carter in the city, and performed hard service for several\r\nyears longer. Many mules 25 years old, and now in this country, perform\r\nwell. Many have been at hard work for 12 or 15 years, and would now sell\r\nfor $100 each. They are not subject to the colt's ailments, the\r\nglanders, heaves, yellow-water, and colic, like horses; and seldom are\r\nafflicted with spavin, ringbones, or bots; and they will not founder.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Shelby says, \"he has known mules to travel 12 miles within the\r\nhour in light harness, and has himself driven a pair 45 miles in six\r\nhours, stopping an hour by the way.\" Four match mules have been sold in\r\nthis country for $1,000. They were of course superior animals, and made\r\nelegant coach-horses. These animals were driven 80 miles in a day\r\nwithout injury; and they proved a first-rate team for many years.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellicott, of the Patuxent Furnaces, asserts that, \"out of about 100\r\nmules at the works, we have not lost on an average one in two years.\r\nBleeding at the mouth will cure them of nearly every disease, and by\r\nbeing turned out on pasture, they will recover from almost every\r\naccident. I do not recollect we have ever had a wind-broken one. They\r\nare scarcely ever defective in the hoof, and though kept shod, it is not\r\nas important as with the horse. Their skin is tougher than that of the\r\nhorse, consequently they are not as much worried by flies, nor do they\r\nsuffer so much with the heat of summer.\"\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing testimony may be added that of the late Judge Hinckley\r\nof Massachusetts; a shrewd and close observer through a long life of 84\r\nyears. He bred mules at an early day, and always kept a team of them for\r\nhis farm work, much preferring them to horses for this purpose, after an\r\nexperience of 50 years. He had a pair nearly 30 years old, which, with\r\nlight pasturage in summer, and with a moderate supply of hay with little\r\ngrain in winter, and no grooming, performed all the drudgery, though he\r\nkept his stable full of horses besides. They outlived successive\r\ngenerations of horses, and though the latter were often sick and out of\r\ncondition, the mules never were. One from his stock, 45 years old, was\r\nsold for the same price paid for a lot of young mules, being at that\r\nmature age perfectly able to perform his full share of labor.\r\n\r\nFor the caravans that pass over the almost inaccessible ranges which\r\nform the continuation of the Rocky Mountains, and the extensive arid\r\nplains that lie between and west of them, on the route from Santa Fe to\r\nCalifornia, mules are the only beasts of burden used in these exhausting\r\nand perilous adventures. Their value may be estimated from the\r\ncomparative prices of mules and horses; for while a good horse may be\r\nbought for $10 to $20, a good mule is worth $50 to $75.\r\n\r\nDr. Lyman, who recently passed through those regions, informs us that\r\ntheir caravan left Santa Fe with about 150 mules, 15 or 20 horses, all\r\nbeasts of burden, and two choice blood-horses, which were led and\r\ntreated with peculiar care. On the route, all the working-horses died\r\nfrom exhaustion and suffering; the two bloods that had been so carefully\r\nattended, but just survived; yet of the whole number of mules but 8 or\r\n10 gave out. A mule 36 years of age was as strong, enduring, and\r\nperformed as hard labor, as any one in the caravan. When thirst\r\ncompelled them to resort for successive days to the saline waters, which\r\nare the only ones furnished by those sterile plains, the horses were at\r\nonce severely, and not unfrequently fatally affected; while the mules,\r\nthough suffering greatly from the change, yet seldom were so much\r\ninjured as to require any remission of their labor.\r\n\r\nThe mules sent to the Mexican possessions from our western states,\r\nMissouri, Tennessee, and Kentucky, are considered of much more value\r\nthan such as are bred from the native (usually wild) mares. The\r\ndifference probably arises, in part, from the Mexicans using jacks so\r\ninferior to most of the stock animals used by the citizens of those\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nMare mules are estimated in those regions at one-third more than horse\r\nmules. The reason assigned for this is, that after a day's journey of\r\nexcessive fatigue, there is a larger quantity of blood secreted in the\r\nbladder, which the female, owing to her larger passage, voids at once,\r\nand without much apparent suffering, while the male does not get rid of\r\nit, frequently, till after an hour of considerable pain. The effect of\r\nthis difference is seen in the loss of flesh and strength in the male to\r\nan extent far beyond that of the female.\r\n\r\n_The method of reducing refractory mules_ in the northern Mexican\r\npossessions, is for the person to grasp them firmly by the ears, while\r\nanother whips them severely on the fore-legs and belly.\r\n\r\n_Estimated annual saving to the United States from the employment of\r\nmules in the place of horses._--To sum up the advantages of working\r\nmules over horses, we shall have as advantages: 1. They are more easily,\r\nsurely, and cheaply raised. 2. They are maintained, after commencing\r\nwork, for much less than the cost of keeping horses. 3. They are not\r\nsubject to many of the diseases of the horse, and to others only in a\r\nmitigated degree, and even these are easily cured in the mule. 4. They\r\nattain a greater age, and their average working years are probably twice\r\nthat of the horse.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, there were reported to be 4,335,669 horses and mules in the\r\nUnion, no discrimination having been made between them. Suppose the\r\ntotal number at the present time is 4,650,000, and that of these 650,000\r\nare mules. If we deduct one-fourth, supposed to be required for the\r\npurposes of breed, fancy-horses, &c., we shall have 3,000,000 horses,\r\nwhose places may be equally well supplied by the same number of mules.\r\nWe have seen that Mr. Hood, of Maryland, estimates the expense of a\r\nworking horse at $44 per annum, (not an over estimate for the Atlantic\r\nstates,) while that of the mule is $22. The difference is $22, which it\r\nis proper to reduce to meet the much lower rate of keeping at the West.\r\nIf we put the difference at $10, we shall find the saving in the keep,\r\nshoeing, farriery, &c., by substituting mules for the 3,000,000 horses\r\nthat can be dispensed with, will be $30,000,000 per annum. But this is\r\nnot all.\r\n\r\nThe working age of the horse will not exceed an average of eight years,\r\nwhile that of the mule is probably over sixteen. To the difference of\r\nkeep, then, must be added the annual waste of the capital invested in\r\nthe animal. A mule is more cheaply raised to working age than a horse,\r\nbut allowing them to cost equally, we shall have the horse exhausting\r\none-eighth of his capital annually for his decay, when the mule is using\r\nup but one-sixteenth; and if we allow $48 as the first cost of both\r\nanimals, we shall find the horse wasting $6 annually for this item,\r\nwhile the mule deteriorates but $3, making an additional item of\r\n$9,000,000. This will give an aggregate of $39,000,000, as the annual\r\nsaving to the United States by substituting good mules for three-fourths\r\nof the horses now used in this country. When will our farmers have the\r\ngood sense to make this change? It may be fairly answered, when they\r\nshall prefer utility, interest, and a just taste, to a diseased fancy;\r\nfor though we admit the superiority in appearance of the race of horses\r\nover mules, we deny that a bad horse looks better or even as well as a\r\ngood mule; and with the same keep and attention, a good mule will\r\noutwork and outlook most horses of any breed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe comparative Economy of Horse and Ox Labor.\r\n\r\nThis is a question which has been often discussed, and when with candor,\r\nthe conclusion has generally been in favor of ox-labor. The different\r\nemployments, the variety of situation, the season, and the kind of stock\r\nreared on the farm, are all questions which should be fully considered\r\nin arriving at their true comparative advantages. Most farmers would\r\nfind it for their interest to keep teams of each, where there is\r\nemployment for more than one; or if this be not the case, the preference\r\nshould be given to that which is best suited in all respects to their\r\nparticular position.\r\n\r\nIf work upon the road is required, a horse team will generally be best.\r\nTheir superiority will consist principally in their greater speed; for\r\neven with a heavy load, they will be able to trot occasionally, and when\r\ndriven without it, they may increase their pace to nearly double the\r\nnatural gait of the ox. This will amount to a large annual saving in the\r\ntime of the driver when steadily employed. The same is true when\r\nremoving manures or crops on the farm to remote distances, over a smooth\r\nsurface, which admits of trotting with the empty wagon. Harrowing ought\r\nalways to be done with a quick team, as a violent stroke of the teeth\r\nbreaks the clods and pulverizes the earth much better than when slowly\r\ndragged.\r\n\r\nBut we should assume in this comparison, that oxen shall not only be\r\nwell adapted to their work by their natural formation, like the\r\nHereford, the Devon, and others equally good, but also that they be well\r\ntrained, well managed, accustomed to quick movements, and as well fed\r\nand looked after as horses. We shall then find their walk equal to a\r\nquick horse team, and that in this case the horse will have no advantage\r\nover the ox in harrowing. For plowing, the teams are on a par, as a good\r\nox team will do as much in a day in cool weather as horses.\r\n\r\n_The situation of the farm_ may materially affect this estimate. In a\r\nwarm climate, horses, and more especially mules, would be more\r\nserviceable than oxen, as they are capable of enduring much greater\r\nheat with impunity. If the farm be small and convenient to market, the\r\nlabor may, in general, be best accomplished by oxen, as little\r\ntravelling will be required. So, too, if the land be stony or rough, the\r\nplowing and harrowing will be more kindly and patiently done by oxen\r\nthan by spirited horses. Other considerations will suggest themselves as\r\naffecting the comparative economy of this labor.\r\n\r\n_The time of work_ is to be fully considered. If much and heavy work be\r\nrequired in summer, as is often the case in plowing extensive wheat\r\nfarms, horses are to be preferred; yet if the ox-team be started at\r\nearly dawn, and worked briskly four or five hours, and then turned out\r\nto rest with a supply of suitable food, they may again commence when the\r\nextreme heat has abated, and accomplish a day's work that few horses\r\nwill exceed. During the season of muddy roads, the horse, with his\r\nbroad, compact foot, and longer leg, has a decided advantage over the\r\nox. If the ox draws by the yoke, (which on the whole is the best mode,)\r\nhe is liable to a sore neck when working in wet or snowy weather, and at\r\nsuch times he is overmatched by his competitor.\r\n\r\n_The kind of stock raised on the farm_ has an important bearing on this\r\nquestion. Some farms are devoted to rearing horses, and some exclusively\r\nto rearing cattle. These occasionally remain on hand after they are fit\r\nfor market, from the want of a profitable demand. They can then be\r\nemployed not only without injury, but in consequence of the thorough\r\ntraining thus secured, with positive benefit to their future value.\r\n\r\nEven if intended for the shambles, the well-developed ox may\r\nadvantageously be put to light work at three, after which it may be\r\ngradually increased till he is six or eight, and during all this time he\r\nwill be improving. After doing an early spring's work, he may then be\r\nturned on to good pasture, and if followed with proper stall-feeding, he\r\nwill in the latter part of the winter or spring yield a tender,\r\nbetter-flavored, and more profitable carcass, than can be procured by\r\nany other mode of fattening.\r\n\r\nThe first cost of oxen is less than that of horses, and they are at all\r\ntimes cheaply reared on the coarser herbage of the farm. The expense of\r\nworking-gear, tackle, and shoeing, is much less than with horses. They\r\nare subject to fewer diseases, and these are more within the reach of\r\nordinary medicines. The cost of food is also less, and while the horse\r\nis depreciating, the ox is increasing in value till eight or nine years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nAccidents are less frequent with oxen, from their slower movements; and\r\nwhen they occur, the ox may be turned out to fatten, and still be worth\r\nas much for this purpose as for the yoke. A permanent injury to the\r\nhorse is perhaps a total loss of the beast, with a large farrier's bill\r\nin addition, for which there is nothing to liquidate it but the hide.\r\n\r\nThe small farmer can make out a most serviceable team, by putting a\r\nsingle horse before a yoke of cattle. If well trained, they will soon\r\naccommodate themselves to each other's pace, and work as advantageously\r\ntogether as an entire team of either class would do alone.\r\n\r\nBulls are frequently put to the draught, and when they have not other\r\nservices that fully test their powers, they cannot be better employed.\r\nHeifers and cows are sometimes worked, but hitherto they have not been\r\nused to any extent in this country. In the absence of other animals,\r\nthey might perform light work to advantage, but severe labor would stint\r\ntheir growth or impair their milk beyond the benefit derived from it.\r\nThe _spayed heifer_ is an exception to the foregoing remark, and by many\r\nis esteemed even more useful than an ox of equal weight.\r\n\r\nWe have no definite statements of the comparative money value of the\r\nlabor of oxen and horses. But in England repeated trials have been made,\r\nand while some have discovered no advantage in the employment of oxen\r\nover horses, others have proved them decidedly superior. One Anglesey\r\nfarmer found in an experience of three years, with 12 horses and 20\r\noxen, which accomplished an equal amount of work, that he had saved by\r\nthe latter, $1150.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts prove the subject to be one of sufficient\r\nimportance, to justify the closest investigation of every farmer to\r\ndetermine for himself the comparative value of ox, horse, or mule labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSWINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hog is a cosmopolite of almost every zone, though his natural\r\nhaunts, like those of the hippopotamus, the elephant, the rhinoceros,\r\nand most of the thick-skinned animals, are in warm climates. They are\r\nmost abundant in China, the East Indies, and the immense range of\r\nislands which extends over the whole Southern and Pacific Oceans; but\r\nthey are also numerous throughout Europe, from its southern coast to the\r\nRussian dominions within the Arctic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Boar.]\r\n\r\nIn the United States, swine have been an object of attention since its\r\nearliest settlement, and whenever a profitable market could be found for\r\npork abroad, it has been exported to the full extent of the demand. For\r\nnear twenty years following the commencement of the general European\r\nwars, soon after the organization of our national government, it was a\r\ncomparatively large article of commerce; but from that time, exports\r\nhave not been justified to any extent, till within the last two years,\r\nsince which, a material reduction in the British import duty on pork,\r\nlard, and hams, has again brought it up as a prominent article of trade\r\nwith that country. The recent use which has been made of the carcass in\r\nconverting it into lard oil, has still further increased its\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nSwine are reared in very part of the Union, and when properly managed,\r\nalways at a fair profit. At the extreme North; in the neighborhood of\r\nlarge markets; and on such of the Southern plantations as are\r\nparticularly suited to sugar or rice, they should not be raised beyond\r\nthe number required for the consumption of the coarse or refuse food\r\nproduced. Swine are advantageously kept in connection with a dairy or\r\norchard, as with little additional food besides what is thus afforded,\r\nthey can be put into good condition for the butcher. But it is on the\r\nrich bottoms and other lands of the West, where Indian corn is raised in\r\nprofusion, and at small expense, that they can be reared in the greatest\r\nnumbers and yield the largest profit. The Sciota, Miami, Wabash,\r\nIllinois, and other valleys, and extensive tracts in Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, Missouri, and some adjoining states, have for many years\r\ntaken the lead in the production of swine; and it is probable the\r\nclimate and soil, which are peculiarly suited to their rapid growth, as\r\nwell as that of their appropriate food, will enable them forever to\r\nremain the leading pork-producers of the North American continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeds of Swine.\r\n\r\nThe breeds cultivated in this country are numerous, and like our native\r\ncattle, they embrace many of the best, and a few of the worst to be\r\nfound among the species. Great attention has for many years been paid to\r\ntheir improvement in the Eastern states, and nowhere are there better\r\nspecimens than in many of their yards. This spirit has rapidly extended\r\nWest and South; and among most of the intelligent farmers who make them\r\na leading object of attention, on their rich corn grounds, swine have\r\nattained a high degree of excellence. This does not consist in the\r\nintroduction and perpetuity of any distinct races, so much as in the\r\nbreeding up to a desirable size and aptitude for fattening, from such\r\nmeritorious individuals of any breed, or their crosses, as come within\r\ntheir reach.\r\n\r\nFig. 33, represents an English breed of hogs, a century or more ago:\r\nthough coarse and slouch-eared, it is yet the portrait of a tolerable\r\nhog, and far before many of the swine that still maintain their\r\nascendency in various parts of the European continent. This breed is\r\nnearly extinct, having been crossed successively by the Chinese and\r\nother good breeds, thus diminishing the size and materially improving\r\nits thrift and tendency to fattening. We have few such animals in the\r\nUnited States, though we have many that are worse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.\r\n\r\nOld English Hog.]\r\n\r\nThe _Byefield_, some 30 years ago, was a valuable hog in the Eastern\r\nstates, and did much good among the species generally. They are white,\r\nwith fine curly hair, well made and compact, moderate in size and\r\nlength, with broad backs, and at 15 months attaining some 300 to 350\r\nlbs. net.\r\n\r\nThe _Bedford_ or _Woburn_ is a breed originating with the Duke of\r\nBedford, on his estate at Woburn, and brought to their perfection,\r\nprobably, by judicious crosses of the China hog, on some of the best\r\nEnglish swine. A pair was sent by the duke to this country, as a present\r\nto Gen. Washington, but they were dishonestly sold by the messenger in\r\nMaryland, in which state and Pennsylvania they were productive of much\r\ngood at an early day, by their extensive distribution through different\r\nstates. Several other importations of this breed have been made at\r\nvarious times, and especially by the spirited masters of the Liverpool\r\npacket ships, in the neighborhood of New York. They are a large, spotted\r\nanimal, well made, and inclining to early maturity and fattening. They\r\nare an exceedingly valuable hog, but are nearly extinct both in England\r\nand this country, as a breed.\r\n\r\nThe _Leicesters_ are a large, white hog, generally coarse in the bone\r\nand hair, great eaters, and slow in maturing. Some varieties of this\r\nbreed differ essentially in these particulars, and mature early on a\r\nmoderate amount of food. The crosses with smaller compact breeds, are\r\ngenerally thrifty, desirable animals. _Other large breeds_ deserving\r\ncommendation in this country, are the large _Miami white_, the\r\n_Yorkshire white_, and the _Kenilworth_, each frequently attaining, when\r\ndressed, a weight of 600 to 800 lbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.\r\n\r\nChina Hog.]\r\n\r\nThe _Chinese_ is among the smaller varieties, and without doubt is the\r\nparent stock of the best European and American swine. They necessarily\r\nvary in appearance, size, shape, and color, from the diversity in the\r\nstyle of breeding, and the various regions from which they are derived.\r\n\r\nThe Fig. represents the pure China pig, and is a striking likeness of\r\nmany of the imported and their immediate descendants that we have seen\r\nin this country. They are too small an animal for general use, and\r\nrequire to be mixed with larger breeds to produce the most profitable\r\ncarcass for the market. For the purpose of refining the coarse breeds,\r\nno animal has ever been so successful as this. They are fine-boned,\r\nshort, and very compact, with bellies almost touching the ground, light\r\nhead and ears, fine muzzle, of great docility and quietness, small\r\nfeeders, and producing much meat for the quantity of food consumed.\r\n\r\nFrom the rapidity with which generations of this animal are multiplied,\r\nthe variety of other breeds on which they are crossed, and the treatment\r\nto which they are subjected, it is not surprising that their descendants\r\nshould rapidly assume distinct features. They furnish not only a strong\r\ndash of blood in the best class of large breeds, but in such of the\r\nsmaller as have any pretensions to merit, they constitute the greater\r\npart of the improvement. Such are the _Neapolitan_, the _Essex\r\nhalf-black_, the _Grass breed_, and some others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.\r\n\r\nBerkshire Hog.]\r\n\r\nThe _Berkshires_ are an ancient English breed, formerly of large size,\r\nslow feeders, and late in maturing. Their color was a buff or sandy\r\nground, with large black spots, and the feet, lower part of the legs,\r\nand tuft on the tail, buff. The latter color has given place, in most\r\nof the modern age, to white in the same parts. This variation, with the\r\nmore important ones of early maturity and good feeding properties, are\r\nby Professor Low ascribed to a Chinese cross, which has added the only\r\ncharacteristic in which they were before deficient.\r\n\r\nThey were first introduced and reared as a distinct breed in this\r\ncountry by Mr. Brentnall, of Orange Co., and Mr. Hawes, of Albany, N.\r\nYork. In their hands, and those of other skilful breeders, their merits\r\nwere widely promulgated. No other breeds have been so extensively\r\ndiffused in the United States, within comparatively so brief a period,\r\nas the Berkshires, since 1832, and they have produced a marked\r\nimprovement in many of our former races.\r\n\r\nThey weigh variously, from 250 to 400 lbs. net, at 16 months, according\r\nto their food and style of breeding; and some full-grown have dressed to\r\nmore than 800 lbs. They particularly excel in their hams, which are\r\nround, full, and heavy, and contain a large proportion of lean, tender,\r\nand juicy meat, of the best flavor.\r\n\r\nNone of our improved breeds afford long, coarse hair or bristles; and it\r\nis a gratifying evidence of our decided improvement in this department\r\nof domestic animals, that our brush-makers are under the necessity of\r\nimporting most of what they use from Russia and northern Europe. This\r\nimprovement is manifest not only in the hair, but in the skin, which is\r\nsoft and mellow to the touch; in the finer bones, shorter head, upright\r\nears, dishing face, delicate muzzle, and mild eye; and in the short\r\nlegs, low flanks, deep and wide chest, broad back, and early maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding.\r\n\r\nSwine should not be allowed to breed before 12 or 15 months old, unless\r\nthe animals are large and coarse, when they may be put to it somewhat\r\nyounger. Not only choice individuals, but such as are well descended,\r\nshould be selected for the purpose of breeding. The sow should be in\r\ngood condition, but not fat, nor approaching to it; and a proper degree\r\nof exercise is essential to the development of the f[oe]tus and the\r\nhealth of the parent; for which reason, she should have an extended\r\nrange connected with her pen.\r\n\r\nThe sow goes with young about 114 days. A week before the time comes\r\nround, a comfortable, quiet place should be prepared for her under\r\ncover, and well-protected from cold, if the weather be severe; or if\r\nwarm, a range in a pasture with an open shed to retire to, is\r\nsufficient. Too much litter for bedding must be avoided, and no change\r\nor disturbance of the sow permitted, till two or three weeks after\r\npigging, as the restlessness thereby produced may result in the loss of\r\nthe pigs. The sow should be fed only with a small quantity of the\r\nlightest food or thin gruel, for two or three days, nor put on full feed\r\nfor a week. If inclined to eat her pigs, she should be fed two or three\r\ntimes with raw pork or fresh meat. The pigs may be taught to crack oats\r\nor soaked corn after three weeks, and if provided with a trough\r\ninaccessible to the dam, they will soon learn to feed on milk and other\r\nfood, preparatory to weaning. This may take place when they are 8 or 10\r\nweeks old; and to prevent injury to the sow, let one or two remain with\r\nher a few days longer, and when finally removed, if her bag appears to\r\nbe full, they may be allowed to drain the milk after 20 or 30 hours. The\r\nsow should be restricted to a light, dry diet for a few days at this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement and Fattening.\r\n\r\nThere are but two objects in keeping swine, for breeding and for\r\nslaughter, and their management is consequently simple. Those designed\r\nfor breeding, should be kept in growing condition, on light food, and\r\nhave every advantage for exercise. Such as are destined exclusively for\r\nfattening, ought to be steadily kept to the object.\r\n\r\nIt is the usual, though a bad practice in this country, to let spring\r\npigs run at large for the first 15 months, with such food as is\r\nconvenient; and if fed at all, it is only to keep them in moderate\r\ngrowth till the second autumn. They are then put up to fatten, and in\r\nthe course of 60 or 90 days are fed off and slaughtered. During this\r\nbrief period, they gain from 50 to 100 per cent. more of dressed weight\r\nthan in the 15 or 18 months preceding: nor even then do they yield a\r\ngreater average weight than is often attained by choice, thrifty pigs,\r\nwhich have been well-fed from weaning to the age of 8 or 9 months.\r\n\r\nThree pigs of the Bedford breed, when precisely 71/2 months old, dressed\r\n230, 235, and 2381/2 lbs. Two of the Berkshire and Leicester breeds, at 9\r\nmonths, dressed 304 and 310 lbs. Three others of the Berkshire and Grass\r\nbreeds, 7 months and 27 days old weighed 240, 250, and 257 lbs. net.\r\nInnumerable instances could be adduced of similar weights, gained\r\nwithin the same time, with a good breed of animals under judicious\r\ntreatment. We have no one accurate account of the food consumed, so as\r\nto determine the relative profit of short or long feeding. But that an\r\nanimal must consume much more in 18 or 20 months to produce the same\r\nquantity of dressed meat, which is made by others of 8 or 9 months, does\r\nnot admit of a doubt.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that an ox requires but little more than double the\r\nquantity of food to fatten, that is necessary for supporting existence.\r\nIf we apply this principle to swine, and state the quantity of food\r\nwhich will fatten the pig rapidly, to be three times as great as for the\r\nsupport of life, we shall find that the pig will fatten in 7 months, on\r\nthe same food he would consume to keep him alive for 21. This is based\r\non the supposition that both animals are of equal size. But the pig that\r\nmatures and is slaughtered at 7 months, has only a moderate capacity for\r\neating. During the early stages of his growth, his size and the\r\nconsequent incapacity of the digestive organs, prevent the consumption\r\nof the same quantity which the larger animal requires; and his\r\naccumulating fat, his limited respiration, consequent upon the\r\ncompression of his lungs, and his indisposition to exercise, all\r\nconspire to keep the consumption of food within the smallest possible\r\nlimit. This result, in the absence of any experiment, must be\r\nconjectural entirely; but we believe that experiments will show, that of\r\ntwo thrifty pigs from the same litter, one of which is properly fed to\r\nhis utmost capacity for 7 months, and the other fed with precisely\r\ndouble the quantity of similar food for 21 months, the first will yield\r\nmore carcass and of a better and more profitable quality than the\r\nlatter, which has consumed 100 per cent. the most.\r\n\r\nThe food is only one item in this calculation. The oldest requires the\r\nmost attention, is liable to more accidents and disease, besides the\r\nloss of interest. We are necessarily forced to the conclusion, that by\r\nfar the cheapest mode of wintering pigs is in the pork-barrel. We can\r\nreadily anticipate one objection to this practice, which is the want of\r\nfood at the requisite season of the year to fatten them. This can be\r\nobviated, by reserving enough of the previous year's grain, to keep the\r\nanimal in a rapidly thriving state, till the next crop matures\r\nsufficiently to feed.\r\n\r\nIn the rich corn regions, on its beginning to ripen, as it does in\r\nAugust, the fields are fenced off into suitable lots, and large herds\r\nare successively turned into them, to consume the grain at their\r\nleisure. They waste nothing except the stalks, which in that region of\r\nplenty are considered of little value, and they are still useful as\r\nmanure for succeeding crops; and whatever grain is left by them, leaner\r\ndroves which follow, will readily glean. Peas, early buckwheat, and\r\napples, may be fed on the ground in the same way.\r\n\r\nThere is an improvement in the character of the grain from a few months'\r\nkeeping, which is fully equivalent to the interest of the money and cost\r\nof storage. If fattened early in the season, they will consume less food\r\nto make an equal amount of flesh than in colder weather; they will\r\nrequire less attention; and generally, early pork will command the\r\nhighest price in market.\r\n\r\nIt is most economical, to provide the swine with a fine clover pasture\r\nto run in during the spring and summer; and they ought also to have\r\naccess to the orchard, to pick up all the unripe and superfluous fruit\r\nthat falls. They should also have the wash of the house and the dairy,\r\nto which add meal, and sour in large tubs or barrels. Not less than\r\none-third, and perhaps more, of the whole grain fed to swine, is saved\r\nby grinding and cooking or souring. Yet care must be observed that the\r\nsouring be not carried so far as to injure the food by putrefaction. A\r\nmixture of meal and water, with the addition of yeast or such remains of\r\na former fermentation as adhere to the side or bottom of the vessel, and\r\nexposure to a temperature between 68 deg. and 77 deg. will produce immediate\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nIn this process there are five stages. The _saccharine_, by which the\r\nstarch and gum of the vegetables, in their natural condition, are\r\nconverted into sugar; the _vinous_, which changes the sugar into\r\nalcohol; the _mucilaginous_, sometimes taking the place of the vinous,\r\nand occurring when the sugar solution, or fermenting principle is weak,\r\nproducing a slimy, glutinous product; the _acetic_, forming vinegar,\r\nfrom the vinous or alcoholic stage; and the _putrefactive_, which\r\ndestroys all the nutritive principles and converts them into a poison.\r\nThe precise point in fermentation when the food becomes most profitable\r\nfor feeding, has not yet been satisfactorily determined; but that it\r\nshould stop short of the putrefactive, and probably the full maturity of\r\nthe acetic, is certain.\r\n\r\nThe roots for fattening animals ought to be washed, and steamed or\r\nboiled; and when not intended to be fermented, the meal may be scalded\r\nwith the roots. A small quantity of salt should be added. Potatoes are\r\nthe best roots for swine; then parsnips; orange or red carrots, white or\r\nBelgian; sugar beets; mangel-wurzel; ruta-bagas; and the white turnips,\r\nin the order mentioned. The nutritive properties of turnips are diffused\r\nthrough so large a bulk, that we doubt if they can ever be fed to\r\nfattening swine with advantage; and they will barely sustain lift when\r\nfed to them uncooked.\r\n\r\nThere is a great loss in feeding roots to fattening swine, without\r\ncooking. When unprepared grain is fed, it should be on a full stomach,\r\nto prevent imperfect mastication, and consequent loss of the food. It is\r\nbetter indeed to have it always before them. The animal machine is an\r\nexpensive one to keep in motion, and it should be the object of the\r\nfarmer to put his food in the most available condition for its immediate\r\nconversion into fat and muscle.\r\n\r\nSwine ought to be kept perfectly dry and clean, and provided with a warm\r\nshelter, to which they can retire at pleasure. This will greatly hasten\r\nthe fattening and economize the food. They thrive better and are\r\ngenerally less subject to disease, when long confined in yards, by\r\nhaving a clear running stream always accessible, to wallow in. This is\r\none of the best preventives of vermin and cutaneous diseases. A hog\r\nought to have three apartments, one each for sleeping, eating, and\r\nevacuations, of which the last may occupy the lowest, and the first the\r\nhighest level, so that nothing shall be drained, and as little carried\r\ninto the first two as possible. They must be regularly fed three times a\r\nday, and if there is a surplus, it should be removed at once. If they\r\nare closely confined in pens, give them as much charcoal twice a week as\r\nthey will eat. This corrects any tendency to disorders of the stomach.\r\nRotten wood is an imperfect substitute for charcoal.\r\n\r\nGraves, scraps, or cracklings, as they are variously called, the\r\nresiduum of rough lard or tallow, after expressing the fat, are a good\r\nchange and an economical food. Some animal food, although not essential,\r\nis always acceptable to swine. When about to finish them off, many feed\r\nfor a few weeks on hard corn. This is proper when slops or indifferent\r\nfood has been given, and meal cannot be conveniently procured; but when\r\nfattened on sound roots and meal, it is a wasteful practice, as the\r\nanimal thus falls behind his accustomed growth. It is better to give him\r\nan occasional feed of the raw grain, for a change, and to sharpen his\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\n_The products furnished by the carcass of swine_ are numerous. Every\r\npart of the animal is used for food, and it admits of a far greater\r\nvariety of preparation for the table, than any other flesh. From the\r\nremotest antiquity to the present time, and in every grade of barbarous\r\nand civilized life, it has been esteemed as one of the choicest\r\ndelicacies of the epicure.\r\n\r\n_Lard-oil_ (_oleine_) has, within a few years, given to pork a new and\r\nprofitable use, by which the value of the carcass is greatly increased.\r\nAt some of the large pork-packing depots of the West, one-third of the\r\nwhole quantity has been thus disposed of. This has withdrawn a large\r\namount of pork from the market, and prevented the depression which must\r\notherwise have occurred.\r\n\r\nWhere the oil is required, the whole carcass, after taking out the hams\r\nand shoulders, is placed in a tub having two bottoms, the upper one\r\nperforated with holes, on which the pork is laid, and then tightly\r\ncovered. Steam, at a high temperature, is then admitted into the tub,\r\nand in a short time all the fat is extracted and falls upon the lower\r\nbottom. The remaining mass is bones and scraps. The last is fed to pigs,\r\npoultry, or dogs, or affords the best kind of manure. The bones are\r\neither used for manure, or are converted into animal charcoal, worth\r\nabout three cents per pound, which is valuable for various purposes in\r\nthe arts. When the object is to obtain lard of a fine quality, the\r\nanimal is first skinned, and the adhering fat carefully scraped off. The\r\noily, viscid matter of the skin is thus avoided. When tanned, the skin\r\nmakes a valuable leather. An aggregate weight of 1790 lbs. from four\r\nwell-fattened animals, after taking out the hams and shoulders, say\r\nabout 400 lbs., gave within a fraction of 1200 lbs. of the best lard.\r\n\r\n_Stearine and Oleine._--Lard and all fatty matters consist of three\r\nprinciples, of which stearine contains the stearic and margaric acids,\r\nboth of which, when separated, are solid, and used as inferior\r\nsubstitutes for wax or spermaceti candles. The other, oleine, is fluid\r\nat a low temperature, and in American commerce, is known as _lard-oil_.\r\nIt is very pure, and extensively used for machinery, lamps, and most of\r\nthe purposes for which olive or spermaceti oils are used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCuring Hams and Pork.\r\n\r\nAfter dressing, the carcass should be allowed to hang till perfectly\r\ndrained and cool, when it may be cut up and salted. The usual way is to\r\npack the pork in clean salt, adding brine to the barrel when filled. But\r\nit may be dry salted, by rubbing it in thoroughly on every side of each\r\npiece, with a strong leather rubber firmly secured to the palm of the\r\nright hand. The pieces are then thrown into heaps and sprinkled with\r\nsalt, and occasionally turned till cured; or it may at once be packed in\r\ndry casks, which are occasionally rolled to bring the salt into contact\r\nwith every part.\r\n\r\n\r\nHams and Shoulders\r\n\r\nMay be cured in the same manner, either dry or in pickle, but with\r\ndifferently arranged materials. The following is a good pickle for 200\r\nlbs. Take 14 lbs. of Turk Island salt; 1/2 lb. of saltpetre; 2 qts. of\r\nmolasses, or 4 lbs. of brown sugar, with water enough to dissolve them.\r\nBring the liquor to the scalding point, and skim off all the impurities\r\nwhich rise to the top. When cold, pour it upon the ham, which should be\r\nperfectly cool but not frozen, and closely packed; and if not sufficient\r\nto cover it, add enough pure water for this purpose. Some extensive\r\npackers in Cincinnati and elsewhere, who send choice hams to market, add\r\npepper, allspice, cinnamon, nutmegs, or mace and cloves.\r\n\r\nThe hams may remain six or eight weeks in this pickle, then hung up in\r\nthe smoke-house, with the small end down, and smoked from 10 to 20 days,\r\naccording to the quantity of smoke. The fire should not be near enough\r\nto heat the hams. In Holland and Westphalia, the fire is made in the\r\ncellar, and the smoke carried by a flue into a cool, dry chamber. This\r\nis undoubtedly the best method of smoking. The hams should at all times\r\nbe dry and cool, or their flavor will suffer. Green sugar-maple chips\r\nare best for smoke; next to them are hickory, sweet-birch, corn-cobs,\r\nwhite-ash, or beech.\r\n\r\nThe smoke-house is the best place to keep hams till wanted. If removed,\r\nthey should be kept cool, dry, and free from flies. A canvass-cover for\r\neach, saturated with lime, which may be put on with a whitewash brush,\r\nis a perfect protection against flies. When not to be kept long, they\r\nmay be packed in dry salt, or even in sweet brine, without injury. A\r\ncommon method is to pack in dry oats, baked sawdust, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF SWINE.\r\n\r\nMortifying as the fact may be to human pride, it is nevertheless\r\ncertain, that the internal arrangements, the viscera, digestive organs,\r\nomnivorous propensities, and the general physiological structure of the\r\nhog and the bear, more nearly resemble man, than any other animal. Many\r\nof their diseases may therefore be expected to be a modification of\r\nthose of the human species, and require a similar treatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.\r\n\r\nSkeleton of a Pig.\r\n\r\nA Maxilla inferior, vel posterior; lower jaw.--B Dentes; the teeth.--C\r\nOssa nasi; the nasal bones.--D Maxilla superior, vel anterior; upper\r\njaw.--E Os frontis; the frontal bone.--F Orbiculus; the orbit or socket\r\nof the eye.--G Os occipitis; the occipital bone.--H Atlas; the first\r\nvertebra of the neck.--I Vertebrae colli, vel cervicales; the vertebrae of\r\nthe neck.--J Vertebrae dorsi, vel dorsales; the vertebrae of the back.--K\r\nVertebrae lumborum, vel lumbales; the vertebrae of the loins.--L Ossa\r\ncoccygis; the bones of the tail.--_a_ Scapula; the shoulder-blade.--_b_\r\nHumerus; the round shoulder-bone.--_c_ Sternum; the breastbone.--_d_\r\nUlna; the elbow.--_e_ Radius; the bone of the fore-arm.--_f_ Os\r\nnaviculare: the navicular bone.--_g_ Phalanges vel ossa pedis; the first\r\nand second bones of the foot.--_h_ Phalanges, vel ossa pedis; the bones\r\nof the hoof.--_i_ Pelvis, (ossa innorninata;) the haunch bones.--_j_ Os\r\nfemoris; the thigh-bone.--_k_ Patella; the stifle-bone.--_l_ Tibia; the\r\nupper bone of the leg--_m_ Tarsus, (one of which is the (N) os calcis;)\r\nthe hock-bones.--_n_ Os naviculare; the navicular bone.--_o_ Digiti, vel\r\nphalanges, (ossa pedis;) the first digits of the foot.--_p_ Digiti, vel\r\nphalanges, (ossa pedis;) the second digits of the foot.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPulmonary Affections, Colds, Coughs, and Measles.\r\n\r\nTo each of these, swine are peculiarly liable, and, as with most other\r\nevils, prevention of disease in swine is more easy and economical than\r\ncure. A dry warm bed, free from winds or storms, and suitable food, will\r\nmost effectually prevent any injuries, or fatal attacks. The hog has\r\nlittle external covering to protect him against cold. Nature has\r\nprovided this immediately within the skin, in the deep layer of fat\r\nwhich surrounds the full, plump hog. Fat is one of the best\r\nnon-conductors of heat, and the pig which is well-fed bids defiance to\r\nthe intense cold, which would produce great suffering, and consequent\r\ndisease, in the ill-conditioned animal. By the observance of a proper\r\nmedium between too much fat or lean, for the store or breeding swine,\r\nand providing them with comfortable beds and proper feed, nearly all\r\ndiseases will be avoided.\r\n\r\nFor _Coughs and Inflammation of the Lungs_, bleeding should immediately\r\nbe resorted to, after which give gentle purges of castor oil, or Epsom\r\nsalts; and this should be followed with a dose of antimonial powders--2\r\ngrains, mixed with half a drachm of nitre.\r\n\r\nFor _Costiveness_ or loss of appetite, sulphur is an excellent remedy,\r\ngiven in a light mess.\r\n\r\n_Itch_ may be cured by anointing with equal parts of lard and brimstone.\r\nRubbing-posts, and a running stream to wallow in are preventives.\r\n\r\nThe _Kidney Worm_ is frequently fatal; and always produces weakness of\r\nthe loins and hind legs, usually followed by entire prostration. A pig\r\nthus far gone, is hardly worth the trouble of recovering, even where\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\n_Preventives_, are general thrift, a range in a good pasture, and a dose\r\nof half a pint of wood-ashes every week or fortnight in their food. A\r\nsmall quantity of saltpetre, spirits of turpentine, or tar, will effect\r\nthe same object. When attacked, apply spirits of turpentine to the\r\nloins, and administer calomel carefully; or give half a tablespoonful of\r\ncopperas daily for one or two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlind Staggers.\r\n\r\nThis is generally confined to pigs, and manifests itself in foaming at\r\nthe mouth, rearing on their hind legs, champing and grinding their\r\nteeth, and apparent blindness. The proper remedies are bleeding and\r\npurging freely, and these frequently fail. Many nostrums have been\r\nsuggested, but few are of any utility. It is important to keep the\r\nissues on the inside of the fore-legs, just below the knee, thoroughly\r\ncleansed.\r\n\r\nThe _tails_ of young pigs frequently _drop_ or _rot off_, which is\r\nattended with no further disadvantage to the animal than the loss of the\r\nmember. The _remedies_ are, to give a little brimstone or sulphur in the\r\nfood of the dam; or rub oil or grease daily on the affected parts. It\r\nmay be detected by a roughness or scabbiness at the point where\r\nseparation is likely to occur.\r\n\r\n_Bleeding._--The most convenient mode, is from an artery just above the\r\nknee, on the inside of the fore-arm. It may be drawn more copiously from\r\nthe roof of the mouth. The flow of blood may usually be stopped, by\r\napplying a sponge or cloth with cold water.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of swine, though not numerous, are formidable, and many of\r\nthem soon become fatal. They have not been the subject of particular\r\nscientific study, and most of the remedies applied, are rather the\r\nresult of casual or hap-hazard suggestion, than of well-digested\r\ninference, from long-continued and accurate observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFARM-DOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo grazing farm is complete without one or more intelligent,\r\nwell-trained dogs, adapted to the various wants of their owners; and the\r\ngeneral taste has made their presence almost universal in every rural\r\nhousehold. The dog is peculiarly the friend of man. Many other animals\r\nhave a temporary though feeble attachment to him, which seems the result\r\nrather of constant companionship, or the selfishness of dependence, than\r\nany well-settled affection towards a master.\r\n\r\nThe dog alone, of all the brute creation, seems capable of a\r\ndisinterested, self-sacrificing affection; and this, united with his\r\nusefulness and adaptedness to all climes and countries, has made him a\r\nfavorite in every quarter of the globe. Since this animal is the\r\nhabitual tenant of the farm, and, when suited to his peculiar duties,\r\ncan be made of great utility by the assistance he is capable of\r\naffording in its management, we deem it entirely appropriate to our\r\nsubject to indicate such of the species as are deserving the farmer's\r\nattention. Discarding all ideas of fancy or sportsmanship, and looking\r\nto utility alone, we may safely affirm that the farmer needs only such\r\nas may be found in the four breeds of the Newfoundland, the Shepherd's\r\nand Drover's dog, and the Terrier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.\r\n\r\nNewfoundland Dog.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland Dog.\r\n\r\nThis dog, of which we give a portrait, is always above medium height,\r\nand frequently is of the largest size. He is long-haired and shaggy, and\r\nhas a thick coat of fine, soft fur, beneath the outer covering, which is\r\nalmost impenetrable by water. His color is most frequently black; often\r\nspotted and partially flecked or grayish; and occasionally buff. The\r\nNewfoundland is of the Spaniel family, but derives its name from the\r\nisland where it has been bred for centuries, to the great advantage of\r\nits inhabitants. There are two varieties: the large, used in the north,\r\ncalled the Labrador; and the smaller, more docile and intelligent, of\r\nthe south, called the St. John's. They are employed by the islanders,\r\nand the people of the neighboring coast, in drawing their sleds and\r\ncarts loaded with fish, wood, &c. They aid them in various ways in their\r\nfishing operations; they are strong, courageous, and watchful; and with\r\nslight training, they are scarcely inferior to the best hunting-dogs in\r\npursuing the wild game that abounds in those high northern latitudes.\r\nThese estimable qualities, coupled with their uniform good-nature, have\r\nalways made them favorites with the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland is an excellent watch-dog; sagacious in discriminating\r\nbetween a friend and a foe, and with courage and strength to follow out\r\nhis prompt and judicious conclusions. He is easily trained for the\r\ndrover, to whom he is frequently a great assistant; and with a scent\r\nsufficiently acute to pursue game, he is readily broken in as a useful\r\ncompanion to the sportsman. He can also be made serviceable in the\r\nvarious duties of the farm: destroying noxious vermin, taking the cattle\r\nand horses to the field or water, drawing a light load, churning the\r\nbutter, &c. It is true, he has not all the sagacity of the Poodle, whose\r\nintelligence approaches nearer to human reason than any other of the\r\nbrute creation. But if he has not that quick apprehension, which too\r\noften leads, as in the case of forward children, to the attainment of\r\nevery worthless accomplishment and the indulgence of every loaferish\r\nhabit, he seems to have a sedate, well-formed judgment, which makes all\r\nhis wit available for some useful purpose. He is unsurpassed as a\r\nwater-dog; and his courageous efforts, wherever an opportunity has been\r\nafforded, in rescuing numberless human beings from a watery grave,\r\ntogether with his unswerving fidelity and devotion, commend him as the\r\nprince of the canine family.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shepherd's Dog.\r\n\r\nThis animal, of which we give a beautiful portrait on the next page, of\r\nthe long-haired Scottish breed, belongs to the same family as the\r\nNewfoundland and Poodle, which embraces the most intelligent and useful\r\nof the canine species. There are two classes of these dogs, which differ\r\nwidely in their size and characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe larger is of great size and courage, and when protected by a stout\r\nleather collar studded with spikes, is a full match for the wolf. These\r\nare used by the Spanish and Mexican shepherds, on their wild sierras, as\r\neffective guards against the attacks of all marauders, and are\r\nessentially the same race as the far-famed dogs of Mount St. Bernard.\r\nThey are not sufficiently gentle for guides, and the shepherds who\r\nemploy them rely on some well-trained wethers or goats to lead the flock\r\nat their call. Some have been imported into this country, but on account\r\nof their headstrong and ferocious character, and occasional depredations\r\nupon the flocks, they have been found unsuited to our wants, except on\r\nthe borders of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe Colley or Scottish sheep-dog, the English, and those extensively\r\nused upon the continent, differ much in their form and appearance, but\r\nagree in their intelligence, docility, and usefulness. They are of\r\nmedium size, with a sharp nose, broad forehead, and small upright ear;\r\nthey are both shaggy and smooth-haired, with a bushy tail, and much hair\r\nabout the neck; variously colored, though more frequently inclined to\r\nblack or darkly spotted and gray; and one branch of the family is\r\nentirely destitute of a tail. They possess an instinctive sagacity for\r\nthe management of sheep; and in company with a well-trained dog, under\r\nthe direction of the shepherd, they soon become entirely competent to\r\nthe control of the flock. They perceive his wishes by a word or sign,\r\nand with almost the speed of the greyhound, dart off to execute them.\r\nAccounts of their performances have been frequently related, which seem\r\nalmost incredible to those unacquainted with their peculiar character.\r\nThe following anecdote, often told by the gifted poet, Mr. James Hogg,\r\nmore generally known by the soubriquet of the Ettrick Shepherd, will\r\nshow their capacity more fully than any description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.\r\n\r\nShepherd's Dog]\r\n\r\n\"On one night, a large flock of lambs that were under the Ettrick\r\nShepherd's care, frightened by something, scampered away in three\r\ndifferent directions across the hills, in spite of all that he could do\r\nto keep them together. 'Sirrah,' said the shepherd, 'they're a' awa!' It\r\nwas too dark for the dog and his master to see each other at any\r\nconsiderable distance, but Sirrah understood him, and set off after the\r\nfugitives. The night passed on, and Hogg and his assistant traversed\r\nevery neighboring hill in anxious but fruitless search for the lambs;\r\nbut he could hear nothing of them nor of the dog, and he was returning\r\nto his master with the doleful intelligence that he had lost all his\r\nlambs. 'On our way home, however,' says he, 'we discovered a lot of\r\nlambs at the bottom of a deep ravine called the Flesh Cleuch, and the\r\nindefatigable Sirrah standing in front of them, looking round for some\r\nrelief, but still true to his charge. We concluded that it was one of\r\nthe divisions which Sirrah had been unable to manage, until he came to\r\nthat commanding situation. But what was our astonishment when we\r\ndiscovered that not one lamb of the flock was missing! How he had got\r\nall the divisions collected in the dark, is beyond my comprehension. The\r\ncharge was left entirely to himself from midnight until the rising sun;\r\nand, if all the shepherds in the forest had been there to have assisted\r\nhim, they could not have effected it with greater promptitude. All that\r\nI can say is, that I never felt so grateful to any creature under the\r\nsun as I did to my honest Sirrah that morning.'\"\r\n\r\nThey are quiet and good-natured, never inclined to roam or neglect their\r\nduties, and as little disposed to injure the animals intrusted to their\r\nkeeping. They have almost the intelligence of the shepherd in discerning\r\nthe vagaries of the flock, and ten times his efficiency in driving it.\r\nNo extensive sheep-walks, unless closely hemmed in by impassable fences,\r\nshould be without one or more of these useful animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Drover's Dog.\r\n\r\nThis animal is shown in the annexed figure. He is closely allied to the\r\nsheep-dog, from which he derives all his intelligence and capacity,\r\ndiffering only in being somewhat larger and heavier, which is essential\r\nto his controlling the sturdier bullocks under his charge. His\r\nadditional size is acquired by crossing with some of the stouter races,\r\nsuch as the Newfoundland or the pointer, and even the bull-dog and large\r\nshaggy terrier have sometimes been resorted to for a strain of that\r\nindomitable courage and game, which is frequently requisite to the\r\nproper discharge of his duties. He requires more training than the\r\nsheep-dog, as his peculiar instincts are rather to the management of the\r\nflock than the herd; but when fairly broken in, he is equally expert in\r\nits management. The drover's dog may also be useful for watching, if\r\ncrossed with a reference to this object, which the sheep-dog seldom is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.\r\n\r\nDrover's Dog.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Terrier.\r\n\r\nThis, in addition to the foregoing, is the only dog necessary to the\r\nfarm. He is needed principally for his great sagacity and indefatigable\r\nperseverance in exterminating rats and other vermin, that frequently\r\ncongregate in swarms around the farmer's premises, producing such an\r\naggregate of annoyance and devastation. Other dogs may occasionally be\r\ngood ratters, but the terrier takes to them from instinct, as the\r\nNewfoundland does to the water, or the sheep-dog to his flock. He has\r\ngreat ingenuity and activity in ferreting out and capturing his prey,\r\nand whenever a fair opportunity is afforded, he seldom fails of success.\r\nThe famous English terrier, Billy, on two occasions, killed 100 rats in\r\na ring at each time, in an average of less than six and a half minutes.\r\n\r\nThe terrier is usually below the medium size, but sometimes fully comes\r\nup to or even exceeds it. He is smooth-haired or rough according to the\r\nbreed, of which there are several, each claiming to be equally pure.\r\nBesides his capacity for the destruction of small game, his innate love\r\nfor the sport renders him a valuable assistant in keeping off vagrant\r\ncattle from the premises; and his quick ear, habitual watchfulness, and\r\nprompt courage, fully qualify him, to the extent of his size, for an\r\nexcellent watch-dog.\r\n\r\nThe fancy of country residents may incline them to keep a variety of\r\nother dogs than are herein enumerated, some of which, with good\r\ntraining, can be made partial assistants to their masters. But it is\r\nunnecessary to specify the various breeds that may possibly be of some\r\nuse on the farm, as the slight crossing they will be likely to have,\r\nequally with their opportunities and the attention bestowed upon them,\r\nwill serve materially to develop or obscure their peculiar instincts.\r\nThe Spaniel family and its crosses will be found to combine the greatest\r\nintelligence, fidelity, and aptitude to learn; the hound has the keenest\r\nscent and greatest endurance in the pursuit of game; while the bull-dog\r\nhas the most courage, sullen ferocity, and strength. Each may\r\noccasionally be wanted for a strain of blood for some particular\r\nobjects; and this is especially necessary from the bull-dog in the\r\nmanagement of refractory cattle, or to give the terrier greater\r\nstoutness and courage.\r\n\r\nThe absurd custom of keeping from one to a dozen dogs, untrained for any\r\nvaluable purpose, or supernumeraries even if capable of rendering\r\noccasional service, ought to be abandoned by every rational man. Besides\r\nthe great annual cost, the danger of communicating rabies or madness is\r\nsufficient to justify a legal restraint on their numbers. The sad havoc\r\nthey commit on the flocks, demands the extermination by law of every dog\r\nthat is guilty, whether\r\n\r\n    Mongrel, puppy, whelp, or hound,\r\n    Or cur of low degree.\r\n\r\nAnd even if it includes the _fides Achates_, or parlor companions,\r\n\r\n    Tray, Blanche, and Sweetheart,\r\n\r\nthe work of extirpation should proceed, to the extent of curtailing this\r\nbranch of farm-stock to its wholesome and legitimate proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPOULTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nChoice varieties of fowls add a pleasant feature to the farm premises.\r\nThey engage the attention and sympathy of the juvenile farmers, and the\r\ntime bestowed in the poultry yard keeps them from mischief: it is an\r\nagreeable and salutary relief from toil and study, and elicits the\r\ntaste, the judgment, and the kindlier feelings of humanity, which are to\r\nbe matured in the future accomplished breeder. When properly managed,\r\npoultry are a source of considerable profit, yielding more for the food\r\nthey consume, than any other stock, although their value is not often\r\nconsidered. The agricultural statistics of the United States, for 1839,\r\ngive us over $12,000,000 in poultry, and it probably exceeds $15,000,000\r\nat the present time. It is estimated by McQueen, that the poultry of\r\nEngland exceeds $40,000,000, and yet McCulloch says she imports\r\n60,000,000 eggs annually from France, (McQueen states it at near\r\n70,000,000;) and from other parts of the continent, 25,000,000; besides\r\n80,000,000 imported from Ireland. Poultry, then, ceases to be an\r\nunimportant object of agricultural attention, and assumes its\r\nappropriate place among the other staples of the farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHens\r\n\r\nAre the most numerous and profitable, and the most generally useful of\r\nthe feathered tribe. The hen is peculiarly an egg-producing bird. She\r\nhas the same predisposition for laying, that the cow has for secreting\r\nmilk. Some breeds are better adapted for this object than others: but in\r\nall that have ever come within our notice, the proper food and\r\ncircumstances are alone wanting, to produce a reasonable quantity of\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nThe _egg_ consists of three distinct parts; the shell, the white, and\r\nthe yolk. A good-sized egg will weigh 1,000 grains, of which about 107\r\nare shell, 604 are white, and 289 are yolk. Of the shell, 97 per cent.\r\nis carbonate of lime, 1 per cent. phosphate of lime and magnesia, and 2\r\nper cent. albumen. The white consists of 12 per cent. of albumen, 2.7 of\r\nmucus, 0.3 of salts, and 85 of water. The yolk has about 17.4 per cent.\r\nof albumen, 28.6 of yellow oil, 54 of water, with a trace of sulphur and\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are the constituents of eggs, which have been formed when\r\nthe bird has free access to the various articles which constitute her\r\nnatural food. But they vary with circumstances. When full-fed and denied\r\nall access to lime, she will form an egg without the shell, and deliver\r\nit enclosed in the membrane or sack which always surrounds the white,\r\nwhen covered by the shell. When scantily fed, they will frequently lay;\r\nbut from a deficiency of nutriment, the egg will be meager and watery,\r\nand possess but a small portion of the nutritious qualities peculiar to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo produce the largest number of good eggs, several conditions are\r\nimportant; and they must especially have an abundance of the right kind\r\nof food. This is the most readily obtained in part from animal food. In\r\nwarm weather, when they have a free range, they can generally supply\r\ntheir wants in the abundance of insects, earth-worms, and other animal\r\nmatters within their reach. The large proportion of albumen contained in\r\ntheir eggs, requires that much of their food should be highly\r\nnitrogenized, and when they cannot procure this in animal matter, it\r\nmust be given in grains containing it.\r\n\r\nIf to the usual qualities of hens, a breed of peculiar elegance, of\r\ngraceful form, and beautiful plumage, be added, together with entire\r\nadaptation to the economical purposes required, good layers and good\r\ncarcass, we have a combination of utility, luxury, and taste in this\r\nbird, which should commend them as general favorites. They can\r\neverywhere be kept with advantage, except in dense cities. A hen that\r\ncosts a shilling or two, if provided with a suitable range, will consume\r\n30 or 40 cents worth of food, and produce from 80 to 150 eggs per annum,\r\nworth three or four times the cost of feed and attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Food\r\n\r\nOf hens may consist of different kinds of grain, either broken, ground,\r\nor cooked; roots, and especially boiled potatoes, are nutritious and\r\neconomical; green herbage as clover and most of the grasses, chickweed,\r\nlettuce, cabbage, &c., will supply them with much of their food, if\r\nfresh and tender.\r\n\r\nFig. 40, is a Food fountain. The grain is placed in the hopper, which is\r\nclosely covered, and the grain falls into the bottom below. It is\r\naccessible on four sides by spring doors, which are thrown open by the\r\nweight of the fowl on the connecting spring. One is shown as opened by\r\nthe fowl in stepping up to feed. This is a protection against dirt and\r\nvermin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.\r\n\r\nFood Fountain.]\r\n\r\nThough not absolutely essential to them, yet nothing contributes so much\r\nto their laying, as unsalted, animal food. This is a natural aliment, as\r\nis shown by the avidity with which they pounce on every fly, insect, or\r\nearth-worm which comes within their reach. It would not of course pay to\r\nsupply them with valuable flesh, but the blood and offal of the\r\nslaughter-houses, refuse meat of all kinds, and especially the scraps or\r\ncracklings to be had at the inciters' shops, after soaking for a few\r\nhours in warm water, is one of the best and most economical kinds of\r\nfood. Such with boiled meal is a very fattening food. Grain is at all\r\ntimes best for them when cooked, as they will lay more, fatten quicker,\r\nand eat much less when fed to them in this state; and it may be thus\r\nused unground, with the same advantage to the fowls as if first crushed,\r\nas their digestive organs are certain to extract the whole nutriment.\r\nAll grain is good for them, including millet, rice, the oleaginous\r\nseeds, as the sun-flower, flax, hemp, &c. It is always better to afford\r\nthem a variety of grains where they can procure them at their option,\r\nand select as their appetite craves.\r\n\r\nThey are also fond of milk, and especially when it has become curdled;\r\nand indeed scarcely any edible escapes their notice. They carefully pick\r\nup most of the waste garbage around the premises, and glean much of\r\ntheir subsistence from what would otherwise become offensive; and by\r\ntheir destruction of innumerable insects and worms, they render great\r\nassistance to the gardener. Of course their ever-busy propensity for\r\nscratching, is indiscriminately indulged just after the seeds have been\r\nsown and while the plants are young, which renders it necessary that\r\nthey be confined in some close yard for a time; yet this should be as\r\ncapacious as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.\r\n\r\nWater Fountain.]\r\n\r\nWater is placed in the cask as represented in the Fig., and it is then\r\nclosely stopped, except an opening through a tube leading into a vessel\r\nbelow. As the water is exhausted from this, it descends from the cask\r\nabove, and a supply is thus at all times within reach of the poultry.\r\n\r\nTheir food is better when given to them warm, not hot, and there should\r\nalways be a supply before them to prevent gorging. It is better to be\r\nplaced on shelves or suspended boxes or hoppers, which are variously and\r\ncheaply constructed, to keep it clean and out of the reach of rats.\r\nBesides their food, hens ought to be at all times abundantly supplied\r\nwith clean water, egg or pounded oyster shells, old mortar or slacked\r\nlime. If not allowed to run at large, where they can help themselves,\r\nthey must also be furnished with gravel to assist their digestion; and a\r\nbox or bed of ashes, sand, and dust, is equally essential to roll in for\r\nthe purpose of ridding themselves of vermin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.\r\n\r\nPoultry House]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hen-house\r\n\r\nMay be constructed in various ways to suit the wishes of the owner, and\r\nwhen tastefully built it is an ornament to the premises, It should be\r\nperfectly dry throughout, properly lighted, and capable of being made\r\ntight and warm in winter, yet afford all the ventilation desirable at\r\nany season. In this, arrange the nests in boxes on the sides, in such a\r\nmanner as to humor the instinct of the hen for concealment when she\r\nresorts to them. When desirable to set the hen, these nests may be so\r\nplaced as to shut out the others, yet open into another yard or beyond\r\nthe enclosure, so that they can take an occasional stroll and help\r\nthemselves to food, &c. This prevents other hens laying in their nests,\r\nwhile setting; and it may be easily managed, by having their boxes\r\nplaced on the wall of the building, with a moveable door made to open\r\non either side at pleasure. Hens will lay equally well without a\r\nnest-egg, but when broken up, they ramble off and form new nests, if\r\nthey are not confined. They will lay if kept from the cock, but it is\r\ndoubtful if they will thus yield as many eggs. Hens disposed to set at\r\nimproper times, should be dismissed from the common yard, so as to be\r\nout of reach of the nests, and plentifully fed till weaned from this\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.\r\n\r\nEgg-Hatcher, or Eccalobeon.]\r\n\r\nFig. 43 represents an egg-hatcher or Eccalobeon, made of different\r\nsizes, with shelves so arranged as to hold from 200 to 800 eggs without\r\ntouching each other. The outer box is a non-conductor, so as to retain\r\nthe heat conveyed to every part by water tubes, connected by a reservoir\r\nbelow, the bottom of which is heated by the flame from a spirit-lamp.\r\nThe temperature is indicated by a thermometer on the door inside, which\r\nshould be made equal to that of the hen, say about 106 deg. Fahrenheit. Her\r\nnatural temperature is somewhat elevated by the feverish condition of\r\nthe bird at the period of incubation.\r\n\r\n_Chickens_ require to be kept warm and dry, for a few days after\r\nhatching, and they may be fed with hard-boiled eggs, crumbs of bread or\r\npudding, and milk or water, and allowed to scratch in the gravel in\r\nfront of the hen, which should be confined in a coop for the first three\r\nor four weeks. After this, they may be turned loose, when they will\r\nthrive on any thing the older ones eat. Many use them for the table when\r\nthey are but a few weeks old; but they are unfit for this purpose, till\r\nthey have attained full maturity.\r\n\r\nThe white-legs are preferred by some, from the whiteness and apparent\r\ndelicacy of the meat; but the yellow-legged are the richest and most\r\nhighly-flavored. The color of the feathers does not seem to affect the\r\nquality of the flesh or their character for laying. If we consider the\r\nchemical principles of the absorption and retention of heat, we should\r\nassume the white coat to be best, as it is coolest in summer when\r\nexposed to the sun, and warmest in winter. Yet some of the white breeds\r\nare delicate, and do not bear rough usage or exposure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.\r\n\r\nThe Dorking]\r\n\r\n\r\nVarieties.\r\n\r\nThese differ materially in their sizes, shapes, and colors.\r\n\r\nThe _Dorking_ is esteemed one of the best, being large, well formed and\r\nhardy, good layers and nurses, and yielding an excellent carcass. They\r\nare both white and speckled, and generally have five toes.\r\n\r\nThe _Poland_ is both white and black, with a large tuft, generally of\r\nwhite feathers, on the head. They are of good size, and excellent\r\nlayers, but are seldom inclined to set, which makes them peculiarly\r\ndesirable for such as wish eggs only.\r\n\r\nThe _Dominique_ is a speckled fowl, of barely medium size, compact,\r\nhardy, good layers, and valuable for the table. The _Bucks county\r\nfowls_, heretofore principally reared near Philadelphia, possess but\r\nmoderate pretensions to notice, except in their immense size, a brace of\r\ncapons having been fattened to 191/4 lbs. when dressed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.\r\n\r\nThe Bantam.]\r\n\r\nThe _Bantam_ is but little larger than a pigeon, and is usually of a\r\npure white, but is sometimes speckled. It is generally feathered to the\r\ntoes, but may be bred with clean legs. It is very domestic, and a\r\npleasant little bird around the premises, and is not unprofitable. The\r\n_Game cock_ is of medium weight, and yields good flesh, but is a poor\r\nlayer, and an undesirable tenant for the farm-yard. Besides these, there\r\nare many fanciful varieties, as the _Creeper_, with excessively short\r\nlegs; the _Rumpless_, without a tail; the _Frizzled_, with irregular\r\nfeathers turned towards the head; the _Silky_ or _Merino_ fowl, with\r\nbrown or buff down, instead of feathers; the _Negro_, with its black\r\ncrest, wattles, skin, legs, and feathers; the _Java_ and _Cochin China_,\r\nof great size; several varieties of the _Top-knot_, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diseases of Hens.\r\n\r\nThese are not numerous or complicated, and may be mostly avoided by\r\nproper treatment and food, which are indicated with sufficient\r\nminuteness in the foregoing observations.\r\n\r\n_Gapes_ or _Pip_ is generally owing to drinking unwholesome or dirty\r\nwater. Remove the white blister on the tip of the tongue, and wash with\r\nsharp vinegar, diluted with warm water; or compel the bird to swallow a\r\nlarge lump of fresh butter, mixed with Scotch snuff. It has been cured\r\nby opening the mouth and forcing a pigeon feather, with a tuft of the\r\nfeathers left on the end, (the others having been stripped off,) down\r\nthe windpipe, and gently turning it as withdrawn, to be repeated the\r\nfollowing day if necessary. This detaches large numbers of a slender red\r\nworm, collected in the larynx of the throat, which impedes respiration\r\nand swallowing. A little spirits of turpentine mixed with the food is a\r\npreventive; as are also clean, whitewashed premises, and good food.\r\nAfter these attacks, feed for a few days with light food, soaked bran\r\nand cabbage, or lettuce chopped fine.\r\n\r\n_Roup_, _Catarrh_, or _swelled head_, is shown by feverish symptoms,\r\nswollen eyelids, frequently terminating in blindness, rattling in the\r\nthroat, and temporary strangulation. These are accompanied with a highly\r\noffensive watery discharge, from the mouth and nostrils, loss of\r\nappetite, and much thirst. They should be placed near the fire; their\r\nhead bathed in warm Castile soap-suds, or milk and water. Stimulating\r\nfood, as flour or barley-meal, mustard and grated ginger, mixed and\r\nforced down the throat, Boswell says, has been effectual in their speedy\r\nrestoration. This, like many other diseases, is contagious, and when it\r\nappears, the bird should be at once separated from the flock.\r\n\r\n_Flux_ is cured by the yolk of an egg boiled hard; and boiled barley\r\nsoaked in wine.\r\n\r\n_Costiveness_ is removed by giving bran and water with a little honey;\r\nor give a small dose of castor oil.\r\n\r\n_Vermin_ are destroyed by giving them clean sand and ashes to roll in,\r\nadding a little quicklime if necessary.\r\n\r\n_Entire cleanliness_ is necessary for the avoidance of this and other\r\ndiseases. A perfectly dry range is also essential, nor should there be\r\ntoo many together, as this is a fruitful source of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKEY.\r\n\r\nThis bird was unknown to the civilized world till the discovery of this\r\nContinent. It was found here both in its wild and domesticated state;\r\nand still occupies the whole range of the western hemisphere, though the\r\nwild turkey disappears as the country becomes settled. The wild is\r\nlarger than the domesticated bird, sometimes weighing over 30 lbs.\r\ndressed. The color of the male is generally a greenish brown,\r\napproaching to black, and of a rich, changeable, metallic lustre. The\r\nhen is marked somewhat like the cock, but with duller hues.\r\nDomestication through successive generations dims the brilliancy of\r\ntheir plumage, and lessens their size and hardiness. It also produces a\r\nvariety of colors, though they are mostly of a black, buff, pure white,\r\nor speckled.\r\n\r\nThey give evidence of the comparative recency of their domestication, in\r\nthe instinct which frequently impels the cock to brood and take care of\r\nthe young. Nothing is more common than for the male bird to supply the\r\nplace of the hen, when any accident befalls her, and to bring up a\r\nfamily of young chicks with an equally instinctive regard for their\r\nhelplessness and safety.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of this bird, both wild and tame, is exceedingly delicate and\r\npalatable; and though not possessing the high game flavor of some of the\r\nsmaller wild-fowl, and especially of the aquatic, as the canvass-back\r\nduck, &c., it exceeds them in its digestibility and healthfulness. The\r\nturkey is useful principally for its flesh, as it seldom lays over a\r\nnest-full of eggs in one season, when they brood on these and bring up\r\ntheir young. If full-fed, and their first eggs are withdrawn from them,\r\nthey frequently lay a second time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding.\r\n\r\nThose intended for breeders should be compact, vigorous, and large,\r\nwithout being long-legged. They should be daily, yet lightly fed through\r\nthe winter, on grain and roots, and some animal food is always\r\nacceptable and beneficial to them. They are small eaters, and without\r\ncaution will soon get too fat. One vigorous male will suffice for a\r\nflock of 10 or 12 hens, and a single connection is sufficient for each.\r\nThey begin to lay on the approach of warm weather, laying once a day, or\r\nevery other day, till they have completed their litter; which in the\r\nyoung or indifferently fed, may be 10 or 12, and in the older ones,\r\nsometimes reaches 20. The hen is sly in secreting her nest, but usually\r\nselects a dry, well-protected place. She is an inveterate setter, and\r\ncarefully hatches most of her eggs.\r\n\r\nThe young may be allowed to remain for 24 hours without eating, then fed\r\nwith hard-boiled eggs made fine, or crumbs of wheat bread. Boiled milk,\r\ncurds, and buttermilk afford an excellent food. As they get stronger,\r\noat or barley-meal is suitable, but Indian-meal, uncooked, is hurtful to\r\nthem when quite young. They are very tender, and will bear neither cold\r\nnor wet, and it is of course necessary to confine the old one for the\r\nfirst few weeks. When able to shift for themselves, they may wander over\r\nthe fields at pleasure; and from their great fondness for insects, they\r\nwill rid the meadows of innumerable grasshoppers, bugs, and beetles,\r\nwhich often do incalculable damage to the farmer. Early chickens are\r\nsufficiently grown to fatten the latter part of autumn or the beginning\r\nof winter, which is easily done on any of the grains or boiled roots.\r\nBoth are better for being cooked. They require a higher roosting-place\r\nthan hens, and are impatient of too close confinement, preferring the\r\nridge of a barn, or a lofty tree, to the circumscribed limits of the\r\nordinary poultry-house. When rightly managed and fed, turkeys are\r\nsubject to few maladies; and even these, careful attention will soon\r\nremove.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACOCK AND GUINEA-HEN.\r\n\r\nThe _Peacock_ is undoubtedly the most showy of the feathered race. It is\r\na native of the southern part of Asia, and is still found wild in the\r\nislands of Java and Ceylon, and some parts of the interior of Africa.\r\nThey are an ornament to the farm premises, and are useful in destroying\r\nreptiles, insects, and garbage; but they are quarrelsome in the\r\npoultry-yard, and destructive in the garden. Their flesh is coarse and\r\ndark, and they are worthless as layers. The brilliant silvery green and\r\ntheir ever-varying colors give place to an entire white, in one of the\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nThe _Guinea-hen_ is a native of Africa and the southern part of Asia,\r\nwhere it abounds in its wild state. Most of them are beautifully and\r\nuniformly speckled; but occasionally they are white on the breast, like\r\nthe Pintados of the West India Islands, and some are entirely white.\r\nThey are unceasingly garrulous; and their excessively pugnacious\r\ncharacter renders them uncomfortable inmates with the other poultry.\r\nTheir flesh, though high-colored, is delicate and palatable, but, like\r\nthe peacock, they are indifferent layers. Both are natives of a warm\r\nclimate, and the young are tender and rather difficult to rear. Neither\r\nof these birds is a general favorite, and we omit further notice of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSE.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of the goose. Main enumerates twenty-two, most\r\nof which are wild; and the tame are again variously subdivided. The\r\n_common white_ and _gray_ are the most numerous and profitable. The\r\n_white Bremen_ is much larger, often weighing over 20 lbs. net. It is of\r\na beautiful snowy plumage, is domestic and reared without difficulty,\r\nthough not as prolific and hardy as the former. The _China Goose_ is\r\nsmaller than the gray, and one of the most beautiful of the family,\r\npossessing much of the gracefulness and general appearance of the swan.\r\nIt is prolific and tolerably hardy, but has not thus far been a\r\nsuccessful rival with the first. The _Guinea_ or _African goose_ is the\r\nlargest of the species, and equals the size of the swan, often dressing\r\nover 25 lbs. It is a majestic and graceful bird, and very ornamental to\r\nwater scenery. Several other varieties are domesticated in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding.\r\n\r\nGeese pair frequently at one year old, and rear their young; but with\r\nsome kinds, especially of the wild, this is deferred till two and\r\nsometimes three. They require a warm, dry place for their nests, and\r\nwhen undisturbed, they will sit steadily; and if the eggs have not been\r\npreviously chilled or addled, they will generally hatch them all, if\r\nkept on the nest. To insure this, it is sometimes necessary to withdraw\r\nthe first hatched, to prevent the old ones wandering before all are out.\r\nThe young should be kept in a warm sheltered place till two or three\r\nweeks old, if the weather be cold or unsettled. The best food for the\r\ngoslings, is barley or oat, or boiled Indian meal and bread. Milk is\r\nalso good for them. They require green food, and are fond of lettuce,\r\nyoung clover, and fresh tender grass; and after a few weeks, if they\r\nhave a free range on this, they will forage for themselves.\r\n\r\nGeese are not a profitable bird to raise, unless in places where they\r\ncan procure their own subsistence, or at least during the greater part\r\nof the year. This they are enabled to do, wherever there are extensive\r\ncommons of unpastured lands, or where there are streams or ponds, lakes\r\nor marshes with shoal sedgy banks. In these, they will live and fatten\r\nthroughout the year, if unobstructed by ice. They may be fed on all\r\nkinds of grain and edible roots, but it is more economical to give them\r\ntheir food cooked. The well-fattened gosling affords one of the most\r\nsavory dishes for the table.\r\n\r\nGeese live to a great age. They have been known to exceed 100 years. If\r\nallowed a free range on good food and clean water, they will seldom get\r\ndiseased. When well fed, they yield nearly a pound of good feathers in a\r\nseason, at three or four pluckings; and the largest varieties even\r\nexceed this quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCKS\r\n\r\nAre more hardy and independent of attention than the goose, and they are\r\ngenerally the most profitable. They are omnivorous, and greedily eat\r\nevery thing which will afford them nourishment, though they seldom\r\nforage on the grasses like the goose, when they can procure other food.\r\nThey are peculiarly carnivorous, and devour all kinds of meat, putrid or\r\nfresh; and are especially fond of fish, and such insects, worms, and\r\nother creeping things, as they can find imbedded in the mud or\r\nelsewhere. They will often distend their crop with young frogs, almost\r\nto the ordinary size of their bodies. Their indiscriminate appetite\r\noften renders them unfit for the table, unless fattened out of the reach\r\nof garbage and offensive matters. An English admiral used to resort to\r\nwell-fattened rats for his fresh meat when at sea, and justified his\r\ntaste by saying, they were more cleanly feeders than ducks, which were\r\ngeneral favorites.\r\n\r\nThe most profitable for domestic use, is undoubtedly the _common black\r\nduck_. They lay profusely in the spring, when well fed, often producing\r\n40 or 50 eggs, and sometimes a greater number, if kept from setting.\r\nThey are much larger than those of the hen, and equally rich and\r\nnourishing, but far less delicate. They are careless in their habits,\r\nand generally drop their eggs wherever they happen to be through the\r\nnight, whether in the water, the road, or farm-yard; and as might be\r\nexpected from such prodigality of character, they are indifferent\r\nsetters and nurses.\r\n\r\nThe _ducklings_ are better reared by setting the eggs under a sedate,\r\nexperienced hen, as the longer time necessary for hatching, requires\r\npatience in the foster-mother to develop the young chick. They should be\r\nconfined for a few days, and away from the water. At first they may be\r\nfed with bread, or pudding made from boiled oat, barley, or Indian meal;\r\nand they soon acquire strength and enterprise enough to shift for\r\nthemselves, if afterwards supplied with pond or river water. They are\r\nfit for the table when fully grown, and well fattened on clean grain.\r\nThis is more economically accomplished by feeding it cooked.\r\n\r\n_The varieties_ of ducks are almost innumerable. Main describes 31, and\r\nsome naturalists number over 100. Besides the black duck above\r\ndescribed, several others, as the _light gray_, the _white duck_, and\r\nsome of the _tufted_, are prolific, hardy, and profitable.\r\n\r\nWe omit further notice of other varieties; and of the swan, brant,\r\npigeons, &c., as not profitable for general rearing, and only suited to\r\nornamental grounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes\r\n\r\nPage 49; Figure 14 caption: \"Sessamoid\" changed to \"Sesamoid\" (18.\r\nSesamoid bones.)\r\n\r\nPage 59: \"he\" changed to \"be\" (effectual remedies for the removal of\r\ndisease cannot be applied)\r\n\r\nPage 174: added missing open quotes (\"Setons are sometimes useful ...)\r\n\r\nPage 215: \"When-full fed\" changed to \"When full-fed\" (When full-fed and\r\ndenied all access to lime, ...)",
