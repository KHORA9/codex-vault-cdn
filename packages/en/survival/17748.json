The wild buffalo is practically\r\ngone forever, and in a few more years, when the whitened bones of the\r\nlast bleaching skeleton shall have been picked up and shipped East for\r\ncommercial uses, nothing will remain of him save his old, well-worn\r\ntrails along the water-courses, a few museum specimens, and regret for\r\nhis fate. If his untimely end fails even to point a moral that shall\r\nbenefit the surviving species of mammals _which are now being\r\nslaughtered in like manner_, it will be sad indeed.\r\n\r\nAlthough _Bison americanus_ is a true bison, according to scientific\r\nclassification, and not a buffalo, the fact that more than sixty\r\nmillions of people in this country unite in calling him a \"buffalo,\" and\r\nknow him by no other name, renders it quite unnecessary for me to\r\napologize for following, in part, a harmless custom which has now become\r\nso universal that all the naturalists in the world could not change it\r\nif they would.\r\n\r\nW. T. H.\r\n\r\nTHE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON,\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM T. HORNADAY,\r\n\r\n_Superintendent of the National Zoological Park._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.--LIFE HISTORY OF THE BISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. DISCOVERY OF THE SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the American bison, as first made by Europeans,\r\noccurred in the menagerie of a heathen king.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1521, when Cortez reached Anahuac, the American bison was\r\nseen for the first time by civilized Europeans, if we may be permitted\r\nto thus characterize the horde of blood thirsty plunder seekers who\r\nfought their way to the Aztec capital. With a degree of enterprise that\r\nmarked him as an enlightened monarch, Montezuma maintained, for the\r\ninstruction of his people, a well-appointed menagerie, of which the\r\nhistorian De Solis wrote as follows (1724):\r\n\r\n\"In the second Square of the same House were the Wild Beasts, which were\r\neither presents to Montezuma, or taken by his Hunters, in strong Cages\r\nof Timber, rang'd in good Order, and under Cover: Lions, Tygers, Bears,\r\nand all others of the savage Kind which New-Spain produced; among which\r\nthe greatest Rarity was the Mexican Bull; a wonderful composition of\r\ndivers Animals. It has crooked Shoulders, with a Bunch on its Back like\r\na Camel; its Flanks dry, its Tail large, and its Neck cover'd with Hair\r\nlike a Lion. It is cloven footed, its Head armed like that of a Bull,\r\nwhich it resembles in Fierceness, with no less strength and Agility.\"\r\n\r\nThus was the first seen buffalo described. The nearest locality from\r\nwhence it could have come was the State of Coahuila, in northern Mexico,\r\nbetween 400 and 500 miles away, and at that time vehicles were unknown\r\nto the Aztecs. But for the destruction of the whole mass of the written\r\nliterature of the Aztecs by the priests of the Spanish Conquest, we\r\nmight now be reveling in historical accounts of the bison which would\r\nmake the oldest of our present records seem of comparatively recent\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nNine years after the event referred to above, or in 1530, another\r\nSpanish explorer, Alvar Nuñez Cabeza, afterwards called Cabeza de\r\nVaca--or, in other words \"Cattle Cabeza,\" the prototype of our own\r\ndistinguished \"Buffalo Bill\"--was wrecked on the Gulf coast, west of\r\nthe delta of the Mississippi, from whence he wandered westward through\r\nwhat is now the State of Texas. In southeastern Texas he discovered the\r\nAmerican bison on his native heath. So far as can be ascertained, this\r\nwas the earliest discovery of the bison in a wild state, and the\r\ndescription of the species as recorded by the explorer is of historical\r\ninterest. It is brief and superficial. The unfortunate explorer took\r\nvery little interest in animated nature, except as it contributed to the\r\nsum of his daily food, which was then the all-important subject of his\r\nthoughts. He almost starved. This is all he has to say:[1]\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Davis' Spanish Conquest of New Mexico. 1869. P. 67.]\r\n\r\n\"Cattle come as far as this. I have seen them three times, and eaten of\r\ntheir meat. I think they are about the size of those in Spain. They have\r\nsmall horns like those of Morocco, and the hair long and flocky, like\r\nthat of the merino. Some are light brown (_pardillas_) and others black.\r\nTo my judgment the flesh is finer and sweeter than that of this country\r\n[Spain]. The Indians make blankets of those that are not full grown, and\r\nof the larger they make shoes and bucklers. They come as far as the\r\nsea-coast of Florida [now Texas], and in a direction from the north, and\r\nrange over a district of more than 400 leagues. In the whole extent of\r\nplain over which they roam, the people who live bordering upon it\r\ndescend and kill them for food, and thus a great many skins are\r\nscattered throughout the country.\"\r\n\r\nCoronado was the next explorer who penetrated the country of the\r\nbuffalo, which he accomplished from the west, by way of Arizona and New\r\nMexico. He crossed the southern part of the \"Pan-handle\" of Texas, to\r\nthe edge of what is now the Indian Territory, and returned through the\r\nsame region. It was in the year 1542 that he reached the buffalo\r\ncountry, and traversed the plains that were \"full of crooke-backed oxen,\r\nas the mountaine Serena in Spaine is of sheepe.\" This is the description\r\nof the animal as recorded by one of his followers, Castañeda, and\r\ntranslated by W. W. Davis:[2]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: The Spanish Conquest of New Mexico. Davis. 1869. Pp. 206-7.]\r\n\r\n\"The first time we encountered the buffalo, all the horses took to\r\nflight on seeing them, for they are horrible to the sight.\r\n\r\n\"They have a broad and short face, eyes two palms from each other, and\r\nprojecting in such a manner sideways that they can see a pursuer. Their\r\nbeard is like that of goats, and so long that it drags the ground when\r\nthey lower the head. They have, on the anterior portion of the body, a\r\nfrizzled hair like sheep's wool; it is very fine upon the croup, and\r\nsleek like a lion's mane. Their horns are very short and thick, and can\r\nscarcely be seen through the hair. They always change their hair in May,\r\nand at this season they really resemble lions. To make it drop more\r\nquickly, for they change it as adders do their skins, they roll among\r\nthe brush-wood which they find in the ravines.\r\n\r\n\"Their tail is very short, and terminates in a great tuft. When they run\r\nthey carry it in the air like scorpions. When quite young they are\r\ntawny, and resemble our calves; but as age increases they change color\r\nand form.\r\n\r\n\"Another thing which struck us was that all the old buffaloes that we\r\nkilled had the left ear cloven, while it was entire in the young; we\r\ncould never discover the reason of this.\r\n\r\n\"Their wool is so fine that handsome clothes would certainly be made of\r\nit, but it can not be dyed for it is tawny red. We were much surprised\r\nat sometimes meeting innumerable herds of bulls without a single cow,\r\nand other herds of cows without bulls.\"\r\n\r\nNeither De Soto, Ponce de Leon, Vasquez de Ayllon, nor Pamphilo de\r\nNarvaez ever saw a buffalo, for the reason that all their explorations\r\nwere made south of what was then the habitat of that animal. At the time\r\nDe Soto made his great exploration from Florida northwestward to the\r\nMississippi and into Arkansas (1539-'41) he did indeed pass through\r\ncountry in northern Mississippi and Louisiana that was afterward\r\ninhabited by the buffalo, but at that time not one was to be found\r\nthere. Some of his soldiers, however, who were sent into the northern\r\npart of Arkansas, reported having seen buffalo skins in the possession\r\nof the Indians, and were told that live buffaloes were to be found 5 or\r\n6 leagues north of their farthest point.\r\n\r\nThe earliest discovery of the bison in Eastern North America, or indeed\r\nanywhere north of Coronado's route, was made somewhere near Washington,\r\nDistrict of Columbia, in 1612, by an English navigator named Samuel\r\nArgoll,[3] and narrated as follows:\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I had unladen this corne, I set my men to the felling of\r\nTimber, for the building of a Frigat, which I had left half finished at\r\nPoint Comfort, the 19. of March: and returned myself with the ship into\r\nPembrook [Potomac] River, and so discovered to the head of it, which is\r\nabout 65 leagues into the Land, and navigable for any ship. And then\r\nmarching into the Countrie, I found great store of Cattle as big as\r\nKine, of which the Indians that were my guides killed a couple, which we\r\nfound to be very good and wholesome meate, and are very easie to be\r\nkilled, in regard they are heavy, slow, and not so wild as other beasts\r\nof the wildernesse.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Purchas: His Pilgrimes. (1625.) Vol. IV, p. 1765. \"A letter of\r\nSir Samuel Argoll touching his Voyage to Virginia, and actions there.\r\nWritten to Master Nicholas Hawes, June, 1613.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the narrative of the explorer affords no clew\r\nto the precise locality of this interesting discovery, but since it is\r\ndoubtful that the mariner journeyed very far on foot from the head of\r\nnavigation of the Potomac, it seems highly probable that the first\r\nAmerican bison seen by Europeans, other than the Spaniards, was found\r\nwithin 15 miles, or even less, of the capital of the United States, and\r\npossibly within the District of Columbia itself.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the white man with the buffalo on the northern\r\nboundary of that animal's habitat occurred in 1679, when Father\r\nHennepin ascended the St. Lawrence to the great lakes, and finally\r\npenetrated the great wilderness as far as western Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe next meeting with the buffalo on the Atlantic slope was in October,\r\n1729, by a party of surveyors under Col. William Byrd, who were engaged\r\nin surveying the boundary between North Carolina and Virginia.\r\n\r\nAs the party journeyed up from the coast, marking the line which now\r\nconstitutes the interstate boundary, three buffaloes were seen on\r\nSugar-Tree Creek, but none of them were killed.\r\n\r\nOn the return journey, in November, a bull buffalo was killed on\r\nSugar-Tree Creek, which is in Halifax County, Virginia, within 5 miles\r\nof Big Buffalo Creek; longitude 78° 40' W., and 155 miles from the\r\ncoast.[4] \"It was found all alone, tho' Buffaloes Seldom are.\" The meat\r\nis spoken of as \"a Rarity,\" not met at all on the expedition up. The\r\nanimal was found in thick woods, which were thus feelingly described:\r\n\"The woods were thick great Part of this Day's Journey, so that we were\r\nforced to scuffle hard to advance 7 miles, being equal in fatigue to\r\ndouble that distance of Clear and Open Ground.\" One of the creeks which\r\nthe party crossed was christened Buffalo Creek, and \"so named from the\r\nfrequent tokens we discovered of that American Behemoth.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Westover Manuscript. Col. William Byrd. Vol. I, p. 178.]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1733, on another surveying expedition, Colonel Byrd's party\r\nhad the good fortune to kill another buffalo near Sugar-Tree Creek,\r\nwhich incident is thus described:[5]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Vol. II, pp. 24, 25.]\r\n\r\n\"We pursued our journey thro' uneven and perplext woods, and in the\r\nthickest of them had the Fortune to knock down a Young Buffalo 2 years\r\nold. Providence threw this vast animal in our way very Seasonably, just\r\nas our provisions began to fail us. And it was the more welcome, too,\r\nbecause it was change of dyet, which of all Varietys, next to that of\r\nBed-fellows, is the most agreeable. We had lived upon Venison and Bear\r\ntill our stomachs loath'd them almost as much as the Hebrews of old did\r\ntheir Quails. Our Butchers were so unhandy at their Business that we\r\ngrew very lank before we cou'd get our Dinner. But when it came, we\r\nfound it equal in goodness to the best Beef. They made it the longer\r\nbecause they kept Sucking the Water out of the Guts in imitation of the\r\nCatauba Indians, upon the belief that it is a great Cordial, and will\r\neven make them drunk, or at least very Gay.\"\r\n\r\nA little later a solitary bull buffalo was found, _but spared_,[6] the\r\nearliest instance of the kind on record, and which had few successors to\r\nkeep it company.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: _Ib._, p. 28.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe range of the American bison extended over about one-third of the\r\nentire continent of North America. Starting almost at tide-water on the\r\nAtlantic coast, it extended westward through a vast tract of dense\r\nforest, across the Alleghany Mountain system to the prairies along the\r\nMississippi, and southward to the Delta of that great stream. Although\r\nthe great plains country of the West was the natural home of the\r\nspecies, where it flourished most abundantly, it also wandered south\r\nacross Texas to the burning plains of northeastern Mexico, westward\r\nacross the Rocky Mountains into New Mexico, Utah, and Idaho, and\r\nnorthward across a vast treeless waste to the bleak and inhospitable\r\nshores of the Great Slave Lake itself. It is more than probable that had\r\nthe bison remained unmolested by man and uninfluenced by him, he would\r\neventually have crossed the Sierra Nevadas and the Coast Range and taken\r\nup his abode in the fertile valleys of the Pacific slope.\r\n\r\nHad the bison remained for a few more centuries in undisturbed\r\npossession of his range, and with liberty to roam at will over the North\r\nAmerican continent, it is almost certain that several distinctly\r\nrecognizable varieties would have been produced. The buffalo of the hot\r\nregions in the extreme south would have become a short-haired animal\r\nlike the gaur of India and the African buffalo. The individuals\r\ninhabiting the extreme north, in the vicinity of Great Slave Lake, for\r\nexample, would have developed still longer hair, and taken on more of\r\nthe dense hairyness of the musk ox. In the \"wood\" or \"mountain buffalo\"\r\nwe already have a distinct foreshadowing of the changes which would have\r\ntaken place in the individuals which made their permanent residence upon\r\nrugged mountains.\r\n\r\nIt would be an easy matter to fill a volume with facts relating to the\r\ngeographical distribution of _Bison americanus_ and the dates of its\r\noccurrence and disappearance in the multitude of different localities\r\nembraced within the immense area it once inhabited. The capricious\r\nshiftings of certain sections of the great herds, whereby large areas\r\nwhich for many years had been utterly unvisited by buffaloes suddenly\r\nbecame overrun by them, could be followed up indefinitely, but to little\r\npurpose. In order to avoid wearying the reader with a mass of dates and\r\nreferences, the map accompanying this paper has been prepared to show at\r\na glance the approximate dates at which the bison finally disappeared\r\nfrom the various sections of its habitat. In some cases the date given\r\nis coincident with the death of the last buffalo known to have been\r\nkilled in a given State or Territory; in others, where records are\r\nmeager, the date given is the nearest approximation, based on existing\r\nrecords. In the preparation of this map I have drawn liberally from Mr.\r\nJ. A. Allen's admirable monograph of \"The American Bison,\" in which the\r\nauthor has brought together, with great labor and invariable accuracy, a\r\nvast amount of historical data bearing upon this subject. In this\r\nconnection I take great pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to\r\nProfessor Allen's work.\r\n\r\nWhile it is inexpedient to include here all the facts that might be\r\nrecorded with reference to the discovery, existence, and ultimate\r\nextinction of the bison in the various portions of its former habitat,\r\nit is yet worth while to sketch briefly the extreme limits of its range.\r\nIn doing this, our starting point will be the Atlantic slope east of the\r\nAlleghanies, and the reader will do well to refer to the large map.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.--There is no indisputable evidence that the bison\r\never inhabited this precise locality, but it is probable that it did. In\r\n1612 Captain Argoll sailed up the \"Pembrook River\" to the head of\r\nnavigation (Mr. Allen believes this was the James River, and not the\r\nPotomac) and marched inland a few miles, where he discovered buffaloes,\r\nsome of which were killed by his Indian guides. If this river was the\r\nPotomac, and most authorities believe that it was, the buffaloes seen by\r\nCaptain Argoll might easily have been in what is now the District of\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nAdmitting the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the\r\nPembrook River of Captain Argoll, there is yet another bit of history\r\nwhich fairly establishes the fact that in the early part of the\r\nseventeenth century buffaloes inhabited the banks of the Potomac between\r\nthis city and the lower falls. In 1624 an English fur trader named Henry\r\nFleet came hither to trade with the Anacostian Indians, who then\r\ninhabited the present site of the city of Washington, and with the\r\ntribes of the Upper Potomac. In his journal (discovered a few years\r\nsince in the Lambeth Library, London) Fleet gave a quaint description of\r\nthe city's site as it then appeared. The following is from the\r\nexplorer's journal:\r\n\r\n\"Monday, the 25th June, we set sail for the town of Tohoga, where we\r\ncame to an anchor 2 leagues short of the falls. * * * This place,\r\nwithout question, is the most pleasant and healthful place in all this\r\ncountry, and most convenient for habitation, the air temperate in summer\r\nand not violent in winter. It aboundeth with all manner of fish. The\r\nIndians in one night commonly will catch thirty sturgeons in a place\r\nwhere the river is not above 12 fathoms broad, and as for deer,\r\nbuffaloes, bears, turkeys, the woods do swarm with them. * * * The 27th\r\nof June I manned my shallop and went up with the flood, the tide rising\r\nabout 4 feet at this place. We had not rowed above 3 miles, but we might\r\nhear the falls to roar about 6 miles distant.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Charles Burr Todd's \"Story of Washington,\" p. 18. New York,\r\n1889.]\r\n\r\nMARYLAND.--There is no evidence that the bison ever inhabited Maryland,\r\nexcept what has already been adduced with reference to the District of\r\nColumbia. If either of the references quoted may be taken as conclusive\r\nproof, and I see no reason for disputing either, then the fact that the\r\nbison once ranged northward from Virginia into Maryland is fairly\r\nestablished. There is reason to expect that fossil remains of _Bison\r\namericanus_ will yet be found both in Maryland and the District of\r\nColumbia, and I venture to predict that this will yet occur.\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA.--Of the numerous references to the occurrence of the bison in\r\nVirginia, it is sufficient to allude to Col. William Byrd's meetings\r\nwith buffaloes in 1620, while surveying the southern boundary of the\r\nState, about 155 miles from the coast, as already quoted; the references\r\nto the discovery of buffaloes on the eastern side of the Virginia\r\nmountains, quoted by Mr. Allen from Salmon's \"Present State of\r\nVirginia,\" page 14 (London, 1737), and the capture _and domestication_\r\nof buffaloes in 1701 by the Huguenot settlers at Manikintown, which was\r\nsituated on the James River, about 14 miles above Richmond. Apparently,\r\nbuffaloes were more numerous in Virginia than in any other of the\r\nAtlantic States.\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA.--Colonel Byrd's discoveries along the interstate\r\nboundary between Virginia and North Carolina fixes the presence of the\r\nbison in the northern part of the latter State at the date of the\r\nsurvey. The following letter to Prof. G. Brown Goode, dated Birdsnest\r\npost-office, Va., August 6, 1888, from Mr. C. R. Moore, furnishes\r\nreliable evidence of the presence of the buffalo at another point in\r\nNorth Carolina: \"In the winter of 1857 I was staying for the night at\r\nthe house of an old gentleman named Houston. I should judge he was\r\nseventy then. He lived near Buffalo Ford, on the Catawba River, about 4\r\nmiles from Statesville, N. C. I asked him how the ford got its name. He\r\ntold me that his grandfather told him that when he was a boy the buffalo\r\ncrossed there, and that when the rocks in the river were bare they would\r\neat the moss that grew upon them.\" The point indicated is in longitude\r\n81° west and the date not far from 1750.\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA.--Professor Allen cites numerous authorities, whose\r\nobservations furnish abundant evidence of the existence of the buffalo\r\nin South Carolina during the first half of the eighteenth century. From\r\nthese it is quite evident that in the northwestern half of the State\r\nbuffaloes were once fairly numerous. Keating declares, on the authority\r\nof Colhoun, \"and we know that some of those who first settled the\r\nAbbeville district in South Carolina, in 1756, found the buffalo\r\nthere.\"[8] This appears to be the only definite locality in which the\r\npresence of the species was recorded.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: Long's Expedition to the Source of the St. Peter's River, 1823,\r\nII, p. 26.]\r\n\r\nGEORGIA.--The extreme southeastern limit of the buffalo in the United\r\nStates was found on the coast of Georgia, near the mouth of the Altamaha\r\nRiver, opposite St. Simon's Island. Mr. Francis Moore, in his \"Voyage to\r\nGeorgia,\" made in 1736 and reported upon in 1744,[9] makes the following\r\nobservation:\r\n\r\n[Note 9: Coll. Georgia Hist. Soc., I, p. 117.]\r\n\r\n\"The island [St. Simon's] abounds with deer and rabbits. There are no\r\nbuffalo in it, though there are large herds upon the main.\" Elsewhere in\r\nthe same document (p. 122) reference is made to buffalo-hunting by\r\nIndians on the main-land near Darien.\r\n\r\nIn James E. Oglethorpe's enumeration (A. D. 1733) of the wild beasts of\r\nGeorgia and South Carolina he mentions \"deer, elks, bears, wolves, and\r\nbuffaloes.\"[10]\r\n\r\n[Note 10: Ibid., I, p. 51.]\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Moore's voyage to Georgia the interior was almost\r\nwholly unexplored, and it is almost certain that had not the \"large\r\nherds of buffalo on the main-land\" existed within a distance of 20 or 30\r\nmiles or less from the coast, the colonists would have had no knowledge\r\nof them; nor would the Indians have taken to the war-path against the\r\nwhites at Darien \"under pretense of hunting buffalo.\"\r\n\r\nALABAMA.--Having established the existence of the bison in northwestern\r\nGeorgia almost as far down as the center of the State, and in\r\nMississippi down to the neighborhood of the coast, it was naturally\r\nexpected that a search of historical records would reveal evidence that\r\nthe bison once inhabited the northern half of Alabama. A most careful\r\nsearch through all the records bearing upon the early history and\r\nexploration of Alabama, to be found in the Library of Congress, failed\r\nto discover the slightest reference to the existence of the species in\r\nthat State, or even to the use of buffalo skins by any of the Alabama\r\nIndians. While it is possible that such a hiatus really existed, in this\r\ninstance its existence would be wholly unaccountable. I believe that the\r\nbuffalo once inhabited the northern half of Alabama, even though history\r\nfails to record it.\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI.--At the beginning of the eighteenth century,\r\nbuffaloes were plentiful in southern Mississippi and Louisiana, not only\r\ndown to the coast itself, from Bay St. Louis to Biloxi, but even in the\r\nvery Delta of the Mississippi, as the following record shows. In a\r\n\"Memoir addressed to Count de Pontchartrain,\" December 10, 1697, the\r\nauthor, M. de Remonville, describes the country around the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, now the State of Louisiana, and further says:[11]\r\n\r\n\"A great abundance of wild cattle are also found there, which might be\r\ndomesticated by rearing up the young calves.\" Whether these animals were\r\nbuffaloes might be considered an open question but for the following\r\nadditional information, which affords positive evidence: \"The trade in\r\nfurs and peltry would be immensely valuable and exceedingly profitable.\r\nWe could also draw from thence a great quantity of buffalo hides every\r\nyear, as the plains are filled with the animals.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same volume, page 47, in a document entitled \"Annals of Louisiana\r\nfrom 1698 to 1722, by M. Penicaut\" (1698), the author records the\r\npresence of the buffalo on the Gulf coast on the banks of the Bay St.\r\nLouis, as follows: \"The next day we left Pea Island, and passed through\r\nthe Little Rigolets, which led into the sea about three leagues from the\r\nBay of St. Louis. We encamped at the entrance of the bay, near a\r\nfountain of water that flows from the hills, and which was called at\r\nthis time Belle Fountain. We hunted during several days upon the coast\r\nof this bay, and filled our boats with the meat of the deer, buffaloes,\r\nand other wild game which we had killed, and carried it to the fort\r\n(Biloxi).\"\r\n\r\n[Note 11: Hist. Coll. of Louisiana and Florida, B. F. French, 1869,\r\nfirst series, p. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of the buffalo at Natchez is recorded,[12] and also (p.\r\n115) at the mouth of Red River, as follows: \"We ascended the Mississippi\r\nto Pass Manchac, where we killed fifteen buffaloes. The next day we\r\nlanded again, and killed eight more buffaloes and as many deer.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 12: Ibid., pp. 88-91.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of the buffalo in the Delta of the Mississippi was observed\r\nand recorded by D'Iberville in 1699.[13]\r\n\r\n[Note 13: Hist. Coll. of Louisiana and Florida, French, second series,\r\np. 58.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Claiborne,[14] the Choctaws have an interesting tradition\r\nin regard to the disappearance of the buffalo from Mississippi. It\r\nrelates that during the early part of the eighteenth century a great\r\ndrought occurred, which was particularly severe in the prairie region.\r\nFor three years not a drop of rain fell. The Nowubee and Tombigbee\r\nRivers dried up and the forests perished. The elk and buffalo, which up\r\nto that time had been numerous, all migrated to the country beyond the\r\nMississippi, and never returned.\r\n\r\n[Note 14: Mississippi as a Province, Territory, and State, p. 484.]\r\n\r\nTEXAS.--It will be remembered that it was in southeastern Texas, in all\r\nprobability within 50 miles of the present city of Houston, that the\r\nearliest discovery of the American bison on its native heath was made in\r\n1530 by Cabeza de Vaca, a half-starved, half-naked, and wholly wretched\r\nSpaniard, almost the only surviving member of the celebrated expedition\r\nwhich burned its ships behind it. In speaking of the buffalo in Texas at\r\nthe earliest periods of which we have any historical record, Professor\r\nAllen says: \"They were also found in immense herds on the coast of\r\nTexas, at the Bay of St. Bernard (Matagorda Bay), and on the lower part\r\nof the Colorado (Rio Grande, according to some authorities), by La\r\nSalle, in 1685, and thence northwards across the Colorado, Brazos, and\r\nTrinity Rivers.\" Joutel says that when in latitude 28° 51' \"the sight\r\nof abundance of goats and bullocks, differing in shape from ours, and\r\nrunning along the coast, heightened our earnestness to be ashore.\" They\r\nafterwards landed in St. Louis Bay (now called Matagorda Bay), where\r\nthey found buffaloes in such numbers on the Colorado River that they\r\ncalled it La Rivière aux Boeufs.[15] According to Professor Allen, the\r\nbuffalo did not inhabit the coast of Texas east of the mouth of the\r\nBrazos River.\r\n\r\n[Note 15: The American Bisons, Living and Extinct, p. 132.]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious coincidence that the State of Texas, wherein the\r\nearliest discoveries and observations upon the bison were made, should\r\nalso now furnish a temporary shelter for one of the last remnants of the\r\ngreat herd.\r\n\r\nMEXICO.--In regard to the existence of the bison south of the Rio\r\nGrande, in old Mexico, there appears to be but one authority on record,\r\nDr. Berlandier, who at the time of his death left in MS. a work on the\r\nmammals of Mexico. At one time this MS. was in the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, but it is there no longer, nor is its fate even\r\nascertainable. It is probable that it was burned in the fire that\r\ndestroyed a portion of the Institution in 1865. Fortunately Professor\r\nAllen obtained and published in his monograph (in French) a copy of that\r\nportion of Dr. Berlandier's work relating to the presence of the bison\r\nin Mexico,[16] of which the following is a translation:\r\n\r\n[Note 16: The American Bisons, pp. 129-130.]\r\n\r\n\"In Mexico, when the Spaniards, ever greedy for riches, pushed their\r\nexplorations to the north and northeast, it was not long before they met\r\nwith the buffalo. In 1602 the Franciscan monks who discovered Nuevo Leon\r\nencountered in the neighborhood of Monterey numerous herds of these\r\nquadrupeds. They were also distributed in Nouvelle Biscaye (States of\r\nChihuahua and Durango), and they sometimes advanced to the extreme south\r\nof that country. In the eighteenth century they concentrated more and\r\nmore toward the north, but still remained very abundant in the\r\nneighborhood of the province of Bexar. At the commencement of the\r\nnineteenth century we see them recede gradually in the interior of the\r\ncountry to such an extent that they became day by day scarcer and\r\nscarcer about the settlements. Now, it is not in their periodical\r\nmigrations that we meet them near Bexar. Every year in the spring, in\r\nApril or May, they advance toward the north, to return again to the\r\nsouthern regions in September and October. The exact limits of these\r\nannual migrations are unknown; it is, however, probable that in the\r\nnorth they never go beyond the banks of the Rio Bravo, at least in the\r\nStates of Cohahuila and Texas. Toward the north, not being checked by\r\nthe currents of the Missouri, they progress even as far as Michigan, and\r\nthey are found in summer in the Territories and interior States of the\r\nUnited States of North America. The route which these animals follow in\r\ntheir migrations occupies a width of several miles, and becomes so\r\nmarked that, besides the verdure destroyed, one would believe that the\r\nfields had been covered with manure.\r\n\r\n\"These migrations are not general, for certain bands do not seem to\r\nfollow the general mass of their kin, but remain stationary throughout\r\nthe whole year on the prairies covered with a rich vegetation on the\r\nbanks of the Rio de Guadelupe and the Rio Colorado of Texas, not far\r\nfrom the shores of the Gulf, to the east of the colony of San Felipe,\r\nprecisely at the same spot where La Salle and his traveling companions\r\nsaw them two hundred years before. The Rev. Father Damian Mansanet saw\r\nthem also as in our days on the shores of Texas, in regions which have\r\nsince been covered with the habitations, hamlets, and villages of the\r\nnew colonists, and from whence they have disappeared since 1828.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF BUFFALO BULL From specimen in the National Museum\r\nGroup. Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the\r\npublishers.]\r\n\r\n\"From the observations made on this subject we may conclude that the\r\nbuffalo inhabited the temperate zone of the New World, and that they\r\ninhabited it at all times. In the north they never advanced beyond the\r\n48th or 58th degree of latitude, and in the south, although they may\r\nhave reached as low as 25°, they scarcely passed beyond the 27th or\r\n28th degree (north latitude), at least in the inhabited and known\r\nportions of the country.\"\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO.--In 1542 Coronado, while on his celebrated march, met with\r\nvast herds of buffalo on the Upper Pecos River, since which the presence\r\nof the species in the valley of the Pecos has been well known. In\r\ndescribing the journey of Espejo down the Pecos River in the year 1584,\r\nDavis says (Spanish Conquest of New Mexico, p. 260): \"They passed down a\r\nriver they called _Rio de las Vacas_, or the River of Oxen [the river\r\nPecos, and the same Cow River that Vaca describes, says Professor\r\nAllen], and was so named because of the great number of buffaloes that\r\nfed upon its banks. They traveled down this river the distance of 120\r\nleagues, all the way passing through great herds of buffaloes.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Allen locates the western boundary of the buffalo in New\r\nMexico even as far west as the western side of Rio Grande del Norte.\r\n\r\nUTAH.--It is well known that buffaloes, though in very small numbers,\r\nonce inhabited northeastern Utah, and that a few were killed by the\r\nMormon settlers prior to 1840 in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake. In the\r\nmuseum at Salt Lake City I was shown a very ancient mounted head of a\r\nbuffalo bull which was said to have been killed in the Salt Lake Valley.\r\nIt is doubtful that such was really fact. There is no evidence that the\r\nbison ever inhabited the southwestern half of Utah, and, considering the\r\ngeneral sterility of the Territory as a whole previous to its\r\ndevelopment by irrigation, it is surprising that any buffalo in his\r\nsenses would ever set foot in it at all.\r\n\r\nIDAHO.--The former range of the bison probably embraced the whole of\r\nIdaho. Fremont states that in the spring of 1824 \"the buffalo were\r\nspread in immense numbers over the Green River and Bear River Valleys,\r\nand through all the country lying between the Colorado, or Green River\r\nof the Gulf of California, and Lewis' Fork of the Columbia River, the\r\nmeridian of Fort Hall then forming the western limit of their range.\"\r\n[In J. K. Townsend's \"Narrative of a Journey across the Rocky\r\nMountains,\" in 1834, he records the occurrence of herds near the Mellade\r\nand Boise and Salmon Rivers, ten days' journey--200 miles--west of Fort\r\nHall.] The buffalo then remained for many years in that country, and\r\nfrequently moved down the valley of the Columbia, on both sides of the\r\nriver, as far as the Fishing Falls. Below this point they never\r\ndescended in any numbers. About 1834 or 1835 they began to diminish very\r\nrapidly, and continued to decrease until 1838 or 1840, when, with the\r\ncountry we have just described, they entirely abandoned all the waters\r\nof the Pacific north of Lewis's Fork of the Columbia [now called Snake]\r\nRiver. At that time the Flathead Indians were in the habit of finding\r\ntheir buffalo on the heads of Salmon River and other streams of the\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nOREGON.--The only evidence on record of the occurrence of the bison in\r\nOregon is the following, from Professor Allen's memoir (p. 119):\r\n\"Respecting its former occurrence in eastern Oregon, Prof. O. C. Marsh,\r\nunder date of New Haven, February 7, 1875, writes me as follows: 'The\r\nmost western point at which I have myself observed remains of the\r\nbuffalo was in 187 on Willow Creek, eastern Oregon, among the foot hills\r\nof the eastern side of the Blue Mountains. This is about latitude 44°.\r\nThe bones were perfectly characteristic, although nearly decomposed.'\"\r\n\r\nThe remains must have been those of a solitary and very enterprising\r\nstraggler.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES (British).--At two or three points only did\r\nthe buffaloes of the British Possessions cross the Rocky Mountain\r\nbarrier toward British Columbia. One was the pass through which the\r\nCanadian Pacific Railway now runs, 200 miles north of the international\r\nboundary. According to Dr. Richardson, the number of buffaloes which\r\ncrossed the mountains at that point were sufficiently noticeable to\r\nconstitute a feature of the fauna on the western side of the range. It\r\nis said that buffaloes also crossed by way of the Kootenai Pass, which\r\nis only a few miles north of the boundary line, but the number which did\r\nso must have been very small.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected from the character of the country, the favorite\r\nrange of the bison in British America was the northern extension of the\r\ngreat pasture region lying between the Missouri River and Great Slave\r\nLake. The most northerly occurrence of the bison is recorded as an\r\nobservation of Franklin in 1820 at Slave Point, on the north side of\r\nGreat Slave Lake. \"A few frequent Slave Point, on the north side of the\r\nlake, but this is the most northern situation in which they were\r\nobserved by Captain Franklin's party.\"[17]\r\n\r\n[Note 17: Sabine, Zoological Appendix to \"Franklin's Journey,\" p. 668.]\r\n\r\nDr. Richardson defined the eastern boundary of the bison's range in\r\nBritish America as follows: \"They do not frequent any of the districts\r\nformed of primitive rocks, and the limits of their range to the\r\neastward, within the Hudson's Bay Company's territories, may be\r\ncorrectly marked on the map by a line commencing in longitude 97°, on\r\nthe Red River, which flows into the south end of Lake Winnipeg, crossing\r\nthe Saskatchewan to the westward of the Basquian Hill, and running\r\nthence by the Athapescow to the east end of Great Slave Lake.\" Their\r\nmigrations westward were formerly limited to the Rocky Mountain range,\r\nand they are still unknown in New Caledonia and on the shores of the\r\nPacific to the north of the Columbia River; but of late years they have\r\nfound out a passage across the mountains near the sources of the\r\nSaskatchewan, and their numbers to the westward are annually\r\nincreasing.[18]\r\n\r\n[Note 18: Fauna Boreali-Americana, vol. 1, p, 279-280.]\r\n\r\n_Great Slave Lake._--That the buffalo inhabited the southern shore of\r\nthis lake as late as 1871 is well established by the following letter\r\nfrom Mr. E. W. Nelson to Mr. J. A. Allen, under date of July 11,\r\n1877:[19] \"I have met here [St. Michaels, Alaska] two gentlemen who\r\ncrossed the mountains from British Columbia and came to Fort Yukon\r\nthrough British America, from whom I have derived some information about\r\nthe buffalo (_Bison americanus_) which will be of interest to you. These\r\ngentlemen descended the Peace River, and on about the one hundred and\r\neighteenth degree of longitude made a portage to Hay River, directly\r\nnorth. On this portage they saw thousands of buffalo skulls, and old\r\ntrails, in some instances 2 or 3 feet deep, leading east and west. They\r\nwintered on Hay River near its entrance into Great Slave Lake, and here\r\nfound the buffalo still common, occupying a restricted territory along\r\nthe southern border of the lake. This was in 1871. They made inquiry\r\nconcerning the large number of skulls seen by them on the portage, and\r\nlearned that about fifty years before, snow fell to the estimated depth\r\nof 14 feet, and so enveloped the animals that they perished by\r\nthousands. It is asserted that these buffaloes are larger than those of\r\nthe plains.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 19: American Naturalist, xi, p. 624.]\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA AND WISCONSIN.--A line drawn from Winnipeg to Chicago, curving\r\nslightly to the eastward in the middle portion, will very nearly define\r\nthe eastern boundary of the buffalo's range in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nILLINOIS AND INDIANA.--The whole of these two States were formerly\r\ninhabited by the buffalo, the fertile prairies of Illinois being\r\nparticularly suited to their needs. It is doubtful whether the range of\r\nthe species extended north of the northern boundary of Indiana, but\r\nsince southern Michigan was as well adapted to their support as Ohio or\r\nIndiana, their absence from that State must have been due more to\r\naccident than design.\r\n\r\nOHIO.--The southern shore of Lake Erie forms part of the northern\r\nboundary of the bison's range in the eastern United States. La Hontan\r\nexplored Lake Erie in 1687 and thus describes its southern shore: \"I can\r\nnot express what quantities of Deer and Turkeys are to be found in these\r\nWoods, and in the vast Meads that lye upon the South side of the Lake.\r\nAt the bottom of the Lake we find beeves upon the Banks of two pleasant\r\nRivers that disembogue into it, without Cataracts or Rapid\r\nCurrents.\"[20] It thus appears that the southern shore of Lake Erie\r\nforms part of the northern boundary of the buffalo's range in the\r\neastern United States.\r\n\r\n[Note 20: J. A. Allen's _American Bisons_, p. 107.]\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.--In regard to the presence of the bison in any portion of the\r\nState of New York, Professor Allen considers the evidence as fairly\r\nconclusive that it once existed in western New York, not only in the\r\nvicinity of the eastern end of Lake Erie, where now stands the city of\r\nBuffalo, at the mouth of a large creek of the same name, but also on the\r\nshore of Lake Ontario, probably in Orleans County. In his monograph of\r\n\"The American Bisons,\" page 107, he gives the following testimony and\r\nconclusions on this point:\r\n\r\n\"The occurrence of a stream in western New York, called Buffalo Creek,\r\nwhich empties into the eastern end of Lake Erie, is commonly viewed as\r\ntraditional evidence of its occurrence at this point, but positive\r\ntestimony to this effect has thus far escaped me.\r\n\r\n\"This locality, if it actually came so far eastward, must have formed\r\nthe eastern limit of its range along the lakes. I have found only highly\r\nquestionable allusions to the occurrence of buffaloes along the southern\r\nshore of Lake Ontario. Keating, on the authority of Colhoun, however,\r\nhas cited a passage from Morton's \"New English Canaan\" as proof of their\r\nformer existence in the neighborhood of this lake. Morton's statement is\r\nbased on Indian reports, and the context gives sufficient evidence of\r\nthe general vagueness of his knowledge of the region of which he was\r\nspeaking. The passage, printed in 1637 is as follows: They [the Indians]\r\nhave also made descriptions of great heards of well growne beasts that\r\nlive about the parts of this lake [Erocoise] such as the Christian world\r\n(untill this discovery) hath not bin made acquainted with. These Beasts\r\nare of the bignesse of a Cowe, their flesh being very good foode, their\r\nhides good lether, their fleeces very usefull, being a kinde of wolle as\r\nfine almost as the wolle of the Beaver, and the Salvages doe make\r\ngarments thereof. It is tenne yeares since first the relation of these\r\nthings came to the eares of the English.' The 'beast' to which allusion\r\nis here made [says Professor Allen] is unquestionably the buffalo, but\r\nthe locality of Lake 'Erocoise' is not so easily settled. Colhoun\r\nregards it, and probably correctly, as identical with Lake Ontario. * *\r\n* The extreme northeastern limit of the former range of the buffalo\r\nseems to have been, as above stated, in western New York, near the\r\neastern end of Lake Erie. That it probably ranged thus far there is fair\r\nevidence.\"\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA.--From the eastern end of Lake Erie the boundary of the\r\nbison's habitat extends south into western Pennsylvania, to a marsh\r\ncalled Buffalo Swamp on a map published by Peter Kalm in 1771. Professor\r\nAllen says it \"is indicated as situated between the Alleghany River and\r\nthe West Branch of the Susquehanna, near the heads of the Licking and\r\nToby's Creeks (apparently the streams now called Oil Creek and Clarion\r\nCreek).\" In this region there were at one time thousands of buffaloes.\r\nWhile there is not at hand any positive evidence that the buffalo ever\r\ninhabited the southwestern portion of Pennsylvania, its presence in the\r\nlocality mentioned above, and in West Virginia generally, on the south,\r\nfurnishes sufficient reason for extending the boundary so as to include\r\nthe southwestern portion of the State and connect with our starting\r\npoint, the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ABUNDANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the quadrupeds that have lived upon the earth, probably no other\r\nspecies has ever marshaled such innumerable hosts as those of the\r\nAmerican bison. It would have been as easy to count or to estimate the\r\nnumber of leaves in a forest as to calculate the number of buffaloes\r\nliving at any given time during the history of the species previous to\r\n1870. Even in South Central Africa, which has always been exceedingly\r\nprolific in great herds of game, it is probable that all its quadrupeds\r\ntaken together on an equal area would never have more than equaled the\r\ntotal number of buffalo in this country forty years ago.\r\n\r\nTo an African hunter, such a statement may seem incredible, but it\r\nappears to be fully warranted by the literature of both branches of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nNot only did the buffalo formerly range eastward far into the forest\r\nregions of western New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, the Carolinas, and\r\nGeorgia, but in some places it was so abundant as to cause remark. In\r\nMr. J. A. Allen's valuable monograph[21] appear a great number of\r\ninteresting historical references on this subject, as indeed to every\r\nother relating to the buffalo, a few of which I will take the liberty of\r\nquoting.\r\n\r\n[Note 21: All who are especially interested in the life history of the\r\nbuffalo, both scientific and economical, will do well to consult Mr.\r\nAllen's monograph, \"The American Bisons, Living and Extinct,\" if it be\r\naccessible. Unfortunately it is a difficult matter for the general\r\nreader to obtain it. A reprint of the work as originally published, but\r\nomitting the map, plates, and such of the subject-matter as relates to\r\nthe extinct species, appears in Hayden's \"Report of the Geological\r\nSurvey of the Territories,\" for 1875 (pp. 443-587), but the volume has\r\nfor several years been out of print.\r\n\r\nThe memoir as originally published has the following titles:\r\n\r\n_Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Kentucky.| N.

Unfortunately both are of greater rarity than the reprint\r\nreferred to above.]\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the spot where the town of Clarion now stands, in\r\nnorthwestern Pennsylvania, Mr. Thomas Ashe relates that one of the first\r\nsettlers built his log cabin near a salt spring which was visited by\r\nbuffaloes in such numbers that \"he supposed there could not have been\r\nless than two thousand in the neighborhood of the spring.\" During the\r\nfirst years of his residence there, the buffaloes came in droves of\r\nabout three hundred each.\r\n\r\nOf the Blue Licks in Kentucky, Mr. John Filson thus wrote, in 1784: \"The\r\namazing herds of buffaloes which resort thither, by their size and\r\nnumber, fill the traveller with amazement and terror, especially when\r\nhe beholds the prodigious roads they have made from all quarters, as if\r\nleading to some populous city; the vast space of land around these\r\nsprings desolated as if by a ravaging enemy, and hills reduced to\r\nplains; for the land near these springs is chiefly hilly. * * * I have\r\nheard a hunter assert he saw above one thousand buffaloes at the Blue\r\nLicks at once; so numerous were they before the first settlers had\r\nwantonly sported away their lives.\" Col. Daniel Boone declared of the\r\nRed River region in Kentucky, \"The buffaloes were more frequent than I\r\nhave seen cattle in the settlements, browzing on the leaves of the cane,\r\nor cropping the herbage of those extensive plains, fearless because\r\nignorant of the violence of man. Sometimes we saw hundreds in a drove,\r\nand the numbers about the salt springs were amazing.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Ramsey, where Nashville now stands, in 1770 there were\r\n\"immense numbers of buffalo and other wild game. The country was crowded\r\nwith them. Their bellowings sounded from the hills and forest.\" Daniel\r\nBoone found vast herds of buffalo grazing in the valleys of East\r\nTennessee, between the spurs of the Cumberland mountains.\r\n\r\nMarquette declared that the prairies along the Illinois River were\r\n\"covered with buffaloes.\" Father Hennepin, in writing of northern\r\nIllinois, between Chicago and the Illinois River, asserted that \"there\r\nmust be an innumerable quantity of wild bulls in that country, since the\r\nearth is covered with their horns. * * * They follow one another, so\r\nthat you may see a drove of them for above a league together. * * *\r\nTheir ways are as beaten as our great roads, and no herb grows therein.\"\r\n\r\nJudged by ordinary standards of comparison, the early pioneers of the\r\nlast century thought buffalo were abundant in the localities mentioned\r\nabove. But the herds which lived east of the Mississippi were\r\ncomparatively only mere stragglers from the innumerable mass which\r\ncovered the great western pasture region from the Mississippi to the\r\nRocky Mountains, and from the Rio Grande to Great Slave Lake. The town\r\nof Kearney, in south central Nebraska, may fairly be considered the\r\ngeographical center of distribution of the species, as it originally\r\nexisted, but ever since 1800, and until a few years ago, the center of\r\npopulation has been in the Black Hills of southwestern Dakota.\r\n\r\nBetween the Rocky Mountains and the States lying along the Mississippi\r\nRiver on the west, from Minnesota to Louisiana, the whole country was\r\none vast buffalo range, inhabited by millions of buffaloes. One could\r\nfill a volume with the records of plainsmen and pioneers who penetrated\r\nor crossed that vast region between 1800 and 1870, and were in turn\r\nsurprised, astounded, and frequently dismayed by the tens of thousands\r\nof buffaloes they observed, avoided, or escaped from. They lived and\r\nmoved as no other quadrupeds ever have, in great multitudes, like grand\r\narmies in review, covering scores of square miles at once. They were so\r\nnumerous they frequently stopped boats in the rivers, threatened to\r\noverwhelm travelers on the plains, and in later years derailed\r\nlocomotives and cars, until railway engineers learned by experience the\r\nwisdom of stopping their trains whenever there were buffaloes crossing\r\nthe track. On this feature of the buffalo's life history a few detailed\r\nobservations may be of value.\r\n\r\nNear the mouth of the White River, in southwestern Dakota, Lewis and\r\nClark saw (in 1806) a herd of buffalo which caused them to make the\r\nfollowing record in their journal:\r\n\r\n\"These last animals [buffaloes] are now so numerous that from an\r\neminence we discovered more than we had ever seen before at one time;\r\nand if it be not impossible to calculate the moving multitude, which\r\ndarkened the whole plains, we are convinced that twenty thousand would\r\nbe no exaggerated number.\"\r\n\r\nWhen near the mouth of the Yellowstone, on their way down the Missouri,\r\na previous record had been made of a meeting with other herds:\r\n\r\n\"The buffalo now appear in vast numbers. A herd happened to be on their\r\nway across the river [the Missouri]. Such was the multitude of these\r\nanimals that although the river, including an island over which they\r\npassed, was a mile in length, the herd stretched as thick as they could\r\nswim completely from one side to the other, and the party was obliged to\r\nstop for an hour. They consoled themselves for the delay by killing four\r\nof the herd, and then proceeded till at the distance of 45 miles they\r\nhalted on an island, below which two other herds of buffalo, as numerous\r\nas the first, soon after crossed the river.\"[22]\r\n\r\n[Note 22: Lewis and Clark's Exped., II, p. 395.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most vivid picture ever afforded of the former abundance of\r\nbuffalo is that given by Col. R. I. Dodge in his \"Plains of the Great\r\nWest,\" p. 120, _et seq._ It is well worth reproducing entire:\r\n\r\n\"In May, 1871, I drove in a light wagon from Old Fort Zara to Fort\r\nLarned, on the Arkansas, 34 miles. At least 25 miles of this distance\r\nwas through one immense herd, composed of countless smaller herds of\r\nbuffalo then on their journey north. The road ran along the broad level\r\n'bottom,' or valley, of the river. * * *\r\n\r\n\"The whole country appeared one great mass of buffalo, moving slowly to\r\nthe northward; and it was only when actually among them that it could be\r\nascertained that the apparently solid mass was an agglomeration of\r\ninnumerable small herds, of from fifty to two hundred animals, separated\r\nfrom the surrounding herds by greater or less space, but still\r\nseparated. The herds in the valley sullenly got out of my way, and,\r\nturning, stared stupidly at me, sometimes at only a few yards' distance.\r\nWhen I had reached a point where the hills were no longer more than a\r\nmile from the road, the buffalo on the hills, seeing an unusual object\r\nin their rear, turned, stared an instant, then started at full speed\r\ndirectly towards me, stampeding and bringing with them the numberless\r\nherds through which they passed, and pouring down upon me all the herds,\r\nno longer separated, but one immense compact mass of plunging animals,\r\nmad with fright, and as irresistible as an avalanche.\r\n\r\n\"The situation was by no means pleasant. Reining up my horse (which was\r\nfortunately a quiet old beast that had been in at the death of many a\r\nbuffalo, so that their wildest, maddest rush only caused him to cock his\r\nears in wonder at their unnecessary excitement), I waited until the\r\nfront of the mass was within 50 yards, when a few well-directed shots\r\nfrom my rifle split the herd, and sent it pouring off in two streams to\r\nmy right and left. When all had passed me they stopped, apparently\r\nperfectly satisfied, though thousands were yet within reach of my rifle\r\nand many within less than 100 yards. Disdaining to fire again, I sent my\r\nservant to cut out the tongues of the fallen. This occurred so\r\nfrequently within the next 10 miles, that when I arrived at Fort Larned\r\nI had twenty-six tongues in my wagon, representing the greatest number\r\nof buffalo that my conscience can reproach me for having murdered on any\r\nsingle day. I was not hunting, wanted no meat, and would not voluntarily\r\nhave fired at these herds. I killed only in self-preservation and fired\r\nalmost every shot from the wagon.\"\r\n\r\nAt my request Colonel Dodge has kindly furnished me a careful estimate\r\nupon which to base a calculation of the number of buffaloes in that\r\ngreat herd, and the result is very interesting. In a private letter,\r\ndated September 21, 1887, he writes as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The great herd on the Arkansas through which I passed could not have\r\naveraged, _at rest_, over fifteen or twenty individuals to the acre, but\r\nwas, from my own observation, not less than 25 miles wide, and from\r\nreports of hunters and others it was about five days in passing a given\r\npoint, or not less than 50 miles deep. From the top of Pawnee Rock I\r\ncould see from 6 to 10 miles in almost every direction. This whole vast\r\nspace was covered with buffalo, looking at a distance like one compact\r\nmass, the visual angle not permitting the ground to be seen. I have seen\r\nsuch a sight a great number of times, but never on so large a scale.\r\n\r\n\"That was the last of the great herds.\"\r\n\r\nWith these figures before us, it is not difficult to make a calculation\r\nthat will be somewhere near the truth of the number of buffaloes\r\nactually seen in one day by Colonel Dodge on the Arkansas River during\r\nthat memorable drive, and also of the number of head in the entire herd.\r\n\r\nAccording to his recorded observation, the herd extended along the river\r\nfor a distance of 25 miles, which was in reality the width of the vast\r\nprocession that was moving north, and back from the road as far as the\r\neye could reach, on both sides. It is making a low estimate to consider\r\nthe extent of the visible ground at 1 mile on either side. This gives a\r\nstrip of country 2 miles wide by 25 long, or a total of 50 square miles\r\ncovered with buffalo, averaging from fifteen to twenty to the acre.[23]\r\nTaking the lesser number, in order to be below the truth rather than\r\nabove it, we find that the number actually seen on that day by Colonel\r\nDodge was in the neighborhood of 480,000, not counting the additional\r\nnumber taken in at the view from the top of Pawnee Rock, which, if\r\nadded, would easily bring the total up to a round half million!\r\n\r\n[Note 23: On the plains of Dakota, the Rev. Mr. Belcourt (Schoolcraft's\r\nN. A. Indians, IV, p. 108) once counted two hundred and twenty-eight\r\nbuffaloes, a part of a great herd, feeding on a single acre of ground.\r\nThis of course was an unusual occurrence with buffaloes not stampeding,\r\nbut practically at rest. It is quite possible also that the extent of\r\nthe ground may have been underestimated.]\r\n\r\nIf the advancing multitude had been at all points 50 miles in length (as\r\nit was known to have been in some places at least) by 25 miles in width,\r\nand still averaged fifteen head to the acre of ground, it would have\r\ncontained the enormous number of 12,000,000 head. But, judging from the\r\ngeneral principles governing such migrations, it is almost certain that\r\nthe moving mass advanced in the shape of a wedge, which would make it\r\nnecessary to deduct about two-third from the grand total, which would\r\nleave 4,000,000 as our estimate of the actual number of buffaloes in\r\nthis great herd, which I believe is more likely to be below the truth\r\nthan above it.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the men of the West of those days, both white and red,\r\nthought it would be impossible to exterminate such a mighty multitude.\r\nThe Indians of some tribes believed that the buffaloes issued from the\r\nearth continually, and that the supply was necessarily inexhaustible.\r\nAnd yet, in four short years the southern herd was almost totally\r\nannihilated.\r\n\r\nWith such a lesson before our eyes, confirmed in every detail by living\r\ntestimony, who will dare to say that there will be an elk, moose,\r\ncaribou, mountain sheep, mountain goat, antelope, or black-tail deer\r\nleft alive in the United States in a wild state fifty years from this\r\ndate, ay, or even twenty-five?\r\n\r\nMr. William Blackmore contributes the following testimony to the\r\nabundance of buffalo in Kansas:[24]\r\n\r\n[Note 24: Plains of the Great West, p. xvi.]\r\n\r\n\"In the autumn of 1868, whilst crossing the plains on the Kansas Pacific\r\nRailroad, for a distance of upwards of 120 miles, between Ellsworth and\r\nSheridan, we passed through an almost unbroken herd of buffalo. The\r\nplains were blackened with them, and more than once the train had to\r\nstop to allow unusually large herds to pass. * * * In 1872, whilst on a\r\nscout for about a hundred miles south of Fort Dodge to the Indian\r\nTerritory, we were never out of sight of buffalo.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty years hence, when not even a bone or a buffalo-chip remains above\r\nground throughout the West to mark the presence of the buffalo, it may\r\nbe difficult for people to believe that these animals ever existed in\r\nsuch numbers as to constitute not only a serious annoyance, but very\r\noften a dangerous menace to wagon travel across the plains, and also to\r\nstop railway trains, and even throw them off the track. The like has\r\nprobably never occurred before in any country, and most assuredly never\r\nwill again, if the present rate of large game destruction all over the\r\nworld can be taken as a foreshadowing of the future. In this connection\r\nthe following additional testimony from Colonel Dodge (\"Plains of the\r\nGreat West,\" p. 121) is of interest:\r\n\r\n\"The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad was then [in 1871-'72] in\r\nprocess of construction, and nowhere could the peculiarity of the\r\nbuffalo of which I am speaking be better studied than from its trains.\r\nIf a herd was on the north side of the track, it would stand stupidly\r\ngazing, and without a symptom of alarm, although the locomotive passed\r\nwithin a hundred yards. If on the south side of the track, even though\r\nat a distance of 1 or 2 miles from it, the passage of a train set the\r\nwhole herd in the wildest commotion. At full speed, and utterly\r\nregardless of the consequences, it would make for the track on its line\r\nof retreat. If the train happened not to be in its path, it crossed the\r\ntrack and stopped satisfied. If the train was in its way, each\r\nindividual buffalo went at it with the desperation of despair, plunging\r\nagainst or between locomotive and cars, just as its blind madness\r\nchanced to direct it. Numbers were killed, but numbers still pressed on,\r\nto stop and stare as soon as the obstacle had passed. After having\r\ntrains thrown off the track twice in one week, conductors learned to\r\nhave a very decided respect for the idiosyncrasies of the buffalo, and\r\nwhen there was a possibility of striking a herd 'on the rampage' for the\r\nnorth side of the track, the train was slowed up and sometimes stopped\r\nentirely.\"\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration, reproduced from the \"Plains of the Great\r\nWest,\" by the kind permission of the author, is, in one sense, ocular\r\nproof that collisions between railway trains and vast herds of buffaloes\r\nwere so numerous that they formed a proper subject for illustration. In\r\nregard to the stoppage of trains and derailment of locomotives by\r\nbuffaloes, Colonel Dodge makes the following allusion in the private\r\nletter already referred to: \"There are at least a hundred reliable\r\nrailroad men now employed on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad\r\nwho were witnesses of, and sometimes sufferers from, the wild rushes of\r\nbuffalo as described on page 121 of my book. I was at the time stationed\r\nat Fort Dodge, and I was personally cognizant of several of these\r\n'accidents.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLAUGHTER OF BUFFALO ON THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD.\r\nReproduced from \"The Plains of the Great West,\" by permission of the\r\nauthor, Col. R. I. Dodge.]\r\n\r\nThe following, from the ever pleasing pen of Mr. Catlin, is of decided\r\ninterest in this connection:\r\n\r\n\"In one instance, near the mouth of White River, we met the most immense\r\nherd crossing the Missouri River [in Dakota], and from an imprudence got\r\nour boat into imminent danger amongst them, from which we were highly\r\ndelighted to make our escape. It was in the midst of the 'running\r\nseason,' and we had heard the 'roaring' (as it is called) of the herd\r\nwhen we were several miles from them. When we came in sight, we were\r\nactually terrified at the immense numbers that were streaming down the\r\ngreen hills on one side of the river, and galloping up and over the\r\nbluffs on the other. The river was filled, and in parts blackened with\r\ntheir heads and horns, as they were swimming about, following up their\r\nobjects, and making desperate battle whilst they were swimming. I deemed\r\nit imprudent for our canoe to be dodging amongst them, and ran it ashore\r\nfor a few hours, where we laid, waiting for the opportunity of seeing\r\nthe river clear, but we waited in vain. Their numbers, however, got\r\nsomewhat diminished at last, and we pushed off, and successfully made\r\nour way amongst them. From the immense numbers that had passed the river\r\nat that place, they had torn down the prairie bank of 15 feet in height,\r\nso as to form a sort of road or landing place, where they all in\r\nsuccession clambered up. Many in their turmoil had been wafted below\r\nthis landing, and unable to regain it against the swiftness of the\r\ncurrent, had fastened themselves along in crowds, hugging close to the\r\nhigh bank under which they were standing. As we were drifting by these,\r\nand supposing ourselves out of danger, I drew up my rifle and shot one\r\nof them in the head, which tumbled into the water, and brought with him\r\na hundred others, which plunged in, and in a moment were swimming about\r\nour canoe, and placing it in great danger. No attack was made upon us,\r\nand in the confusion the poor beasts knew not, perhaps, the enemy that\r\nwas amongst them; but we were liable to be sunk by them, as they were\r\nfuriously hooking and climbing on to each other. I rose in my canoe, and\r\nby my gestures and hallooing kept them from coming in contact with us\r\nuntil we were out of their reach.\"[25]\r\n\r\n[Note 25: Catlin's North American Indians, II, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. CHARACTER OF THE SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _The buffaloes rank amongst ruminants._--With the American people,\r\nand through them all others, familiarity with the buffalo has bred\r\ncontempt. The incredible numbers in which the animals of this species\r\nformerly existed made their slaughter an easy matter, so much so that\r\nthe hunters and frontiersmen who accomplished their destruction have\r\nhanded down to us a contemptuous opinion of the size, character, and\r\ngeneral presence of our bison. And how could it be otherwise than that a\r\nman who could find it in his heart to murder a majestic bull bison for a\r\nhide worth only a dollar should form a one-dollar estimate of the\r\ngrandest ruminant that ever trod the earth? Men who butcher African\r\nelephants for the sake of their ivory also entertain a similar estimate\r\nof their victims.\r\n\r\nWith an acquaintance which includes fine living examples of all the\r\nlarger ruminants of the world except the musk-ox and the European bison,\r\nI am sure that the American bison is the grandest of them all. His only\r\nrivals for the kingship are the Indian bison, or gaur (_Bos gaurus_), of\r\nSouthern India, and the aurochs, or European bison, both of which\r\nreally surpass him in height, if not in actual balk also. The aurochs is\r\ntaller, and possesses a larger pelvis and heavier, stronger\r\nhindquarters, but his body is decidedly smaller in all its proportions,\r\nwhich gives him a lean and \"leggy\" look. The hair on the head, neck, and\r\nforequarters of the aurochs is not nearly so long or luxuriant as on the\r\nsame parts of the American bison. This covering greatly magnifies the\r\nactual bulk of the latter animal. Clothe the aurochs with the wonderful\r\npelage of our buffalo, give him the same enormous chest and body, and\r\nthe result would be a magnificent bovine monster, who would indeed stand\r\nwithout a rival. But when first-class types of the two species are\r\nplaced side by side it seems to me that _Bison americanus_ will easily\r\nrank his European rival.\r\n\r\nThe gaur has no long hair upon any part of his body or head. What little\r\nhair he has is very short and thin, his hindquarters being almost naked.\r\nI have seen hundreds of these animals at short range, and have killed\r\nand skinned several very fine specimens, one of which stood 5 feet 10\r\ninches in height at the shoulders. But, despite his larger bulk, his\r\nappearance is not nearly so striking and impressive as that of the male\r\nAmerican bison. He seems like a huge ox running wild.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent dark brown frontlet and beard of the buffalo, the shaggy\r\ncoat of hair upon the neck, hump, and shoulders, terminating at the\r\nknees in a thick mass of luxuriant black locks, to say nothing of the\r\ndense coat of finer fur on the body and hindquarters, give to our\r\nspecies not only an apparent height equal to that of the gaur, but a\r\ngrandeur and nobility of presence which are beyond all comparison\r\namongst ruminants.\r\n\r\nThe slightly larger bulk of the gaur is of little significance in a\r\ncomparison of the two species; for if size alone is to turn the scale,\r\nwe must admit that a 500-pound lioness, with no mane whatever, is a more\r\nmajestic looking animal than a 450-pound lion, with a mane which has\r\nearned him his title of king of beasts.\r\n\r\n2. _Change of form in captivity._--By a combination of unfortunate\r\ncircumstances, the American bison is destined to go down to posterity\r\nshorn of the honor which is his due, and appreciated at only half his\r\nworth. The hunters who slew him were from the very beginning so absorbed\r\nin the scramble for spoils that they had no time to measure or weigh\r\nhim, nor even to notice the majesty of his personal appearance on his\r\nnative heath.\r\n\r\nIn captivity he fails to develop as finely as in his wild state, and\r\nwith the loss of his liberty he becomes a tame-looking animal. He gets\r\nfat and short-bodied, and the lack of vigorous and constant exercise\r\nprevents the development of bone and muscle which made the prairie\r\nanimal what he was.\r\n\r\nFrom observations made upon buffaloes that have been reared in\r\ncaptivity, I am firmly convinced that confinement and\r\nsemi-domestication are destined to effect striking changes in the form\r\nof _Bison americanus_. While this is to be expected to a certain extent\r\nwith most large species, the changes promise to be most conspicuous in\r\nthe buffalo. The most striking change is in the body between the hips\r\nand the shoulders. As before remarked, it becomes astonishingly short\r\nand rotund, and through liberal feeding and total lack of exercise the\r\nmuscles of the shoulders and hindquarters, especially the latter, are\r\nbut feebly developed.\r\n\r\nThe most striking example of the change of form in the captive buffalo\r\nis the cow in the Central Park Menagerie, New York. Although this animal\r\nis fully adult, and has given birth to three fine calves, she is small,\r\nastonishingly short-bodied, and in comparison with the magnificently\r\ndeveloped cows taken in 1886 by the writer in Montana, she seems almost\r\nlike an animal of another species.\r\n\r\nBoth the live buffaloes in the National Museum collection of living\r\nanimals are developing the same shortness of body and lack of muscle,\r\nand when they attain their full growth will but poorly resemble the\r\nsplendid proportions of the wild specimens in the Museum mounted group,\r\neach of which has been mounted from a most careful and elaborate series\r\nof post-mortem measurements. It may fairly be considered, however, that\r\nthe specimens taken by the Smithsonian expedition were in every way more\r\nperfect representatives of the species than have been usually taken in\r\ntimes past, for the simple reason that on account of the muscle they had\r\ndeveloped in the numerous chases they had survived, and the total\r\nabsence of the fat which once formed such a prominent feature of the\r\nanimal, they were of finer form, more active habit, and keener\r\nintelligence than buffaloes possessed when they were so numerous. Out of\r\nthe millions which once composed the great northern herd, those\r\nrepresented the survival of the fittest, and their existence at that\r\ntime was chiefly due to the keenness of their senses and their splendid\r\nmuscular powers in speed and endurance.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions it is only natural that animals of the highest\r\nclass should be developed. On the other hand, captivity reverses all\r\nthese conditions, while yielding an equally abundant food supply.\r\n\r\nIn no feature is the change from natural conditions to captivity more\r\neasily noticeable than in the eye. In the wild buffalo the eye is always\r\ndeeply set, well protected by the edge of the bony orbit, and perfect in\r\nform and expression. The lids are firmly drawn around the ball, the\r\nopening is so small that the white portion of the eyeball is entirely\r\ncovered, and the whole form and appearance of the organ is as shapely\r\nand as pleasing in expression as the eye of a deer.\r\n\r\nIn the captive the various muscles which support and control the eyeball\r\nseem to relax and thicken, and the ball protrudes far beyond its normal\r\nplane, showing a circle of white all around the iris, and bulging out in\r\na most unnatural way. I do not mean to assert that this is common in\r\ncaptive buffaloes generally, but I have observed it to be disagreeably\r\nconspicuous in many.\r\n\r\nAnother change which takes place in the form of the captive buffalo is\r\nan arching of the back in the middle, which has a tendency to make the\r\nhump look lower at the shoulders and visibly alters the outline of the\r\nback. This tendency to \"hump up\" the back is very noticeable in domestic\r\ncattle and horses during rainy weather. While a buffalo on his native\r\nheath would seldom assume such an attitude of dejection and misery, in\r\ncaptivity, especially if it be anything like close confinement, it is\r\noften to be observed, and I fear will eventually become a permanent\r\nhabit. Indeed, I think it may be confidently predicted that the time\r\nwill come when naturalists who have never seen a wild buffalo will\r\ncompare the specimens composing the National Museum group with the\r\nliving representatives to be seen in captivity and assert that the\r\nformer are exaggerations in both form and size.\r\n\r\n3. _Mounted Specimens in Museums._--Of the \"stuffed\" specimens to be\r\nfound in museums, all that I have ever seen outside of the National\r\nMuseum and even those within that institution up to 1886, were \"stuffed\"\r\nin reality as well as in name. The skins that have been rammed full of\r\nstraw or excelsior have lost from 8 to 12 inches in height at the\r\nshoulders, and the high and sharp hump of the male has become a huge,\r\nthick, rounded mass like the hump of a dromedary, and totally unlike the\r\nhump of a bison. It is impossible for any taxidermist to stuff a\r\nbuffalo-skin with loose materials and produce a specimen which fitly\r\nrepresents the species. The proper height and form of the animal can be\r\nsecured and retained only by the construction of a manikin, or statue,\r\nto carry the skin. In view of this fact, which surely must be apparent\r\nto even the most casual observer, it is to be earnestly hoped that here\r\nno one in authority will ever consent to mount or have mounted a\r\nvaluable skin of a bison in any other way than over a properly\r\nconstructed manikin.\r\n\r\n4. _The Calf._--The breeding season of the buffalo is from the 1st of\r\nJuly to the 1st of October. The young cow does not breed until she is\r\nthree years old, and although two calves are sometimes produced at a\r\nbirth, one is the usual number. The calves are born in April, May, and\r\nJune, and sometimes, though rarely, as late as the middle of August. The\r\ncalf follows its mother until it is a year old, or even older. In May,\r\n1886, the Smithsonian expedition captured a calf alive, which had been\r\nabandoned by its mother because it could not keep up with her. The\r\nlittle creature was apparently between two and three weeks old, and was\r\ntherefore born about May 1. Unlike the young of nearly all other\r\n_Bovidæ_, the buffalo calf during the first months of its existence is\r\nclad with hair of a totally different color from that which covers him\r\nduring the remainder of his life. His pelage is a luxuriant growth of\r\nrather long, wavy hair, of a uniform brownish-yellow or \"sandy\" color\r\n(cinnamon, or yellow ocher, with a shade of Indian yellow) all over the\r\nhead, body, and tail, in striking contrast with the darker colors of the\r\nolder animals. On the lower half of the leg it is lighter, shorter, and\r\nstraight. On the shoulders and hump the hair is longer than on the\r\nother portions, being 11/2 inches in length, more wavy, and already\r\narranges itself in the tufts, or small bunches, so characteristic in the\r\nadult animal.\r\n\r\nOn the extremity of the muzzle, including the chin, the hair is very\r\nshort, straight, and as light in color as the lower portions of the leg.\r\nStarting on the top of the nose, an inch behind the nostrils, and\r\nforming a division between the light yellowish muzzle and the more\r\nreddish hair on the remainder of the head, there is an irregular band of\r\ndark, straight hair, which extends down past the corner of the mouth to\r\na point just back of the chin, where it unites. From the chin backward\r\nthe dark band increases in breadth and intensity, and continues back\r\nhalf way to the angle of the jaw. At that point begins a sort of under\r\nmane of wavy, dark-brown hair, nearly 3 inches long, and extends back\r\nalong the median line of the throat to a point between the fore legs,\r\nwhere it abruptly terminates. From the back of the head another streak\r\nof dark hair extends backward along the top of the neck, over the hump,\r\nand down to the lumbar region, where it fades out entirely. These two\r\ndark bands are in sharp contrast to the light sandy hair adjoining.\r\n\r\nThe tail is densely haired. The tuft on the end is quite luxuriant, and\r\nshows a center of darker hair. The hair on the inside of the ear is\r\ndark, but that on the outside is sandy.\r\n\r\nThe naked portion of the nose is light Vandyke-brown, with a pinkish\r\ntinge, and the edge of the eyelid the same. The iris is dark brown. The\r\nhorn at three months is about 1 inch in length, and is a mere little\r\nblack stub. In the male, the hump is clearly defined, but by no means so\r\nhigh in proportion as in the adult animal. The hump of the calf from\r\nwhich this description is drawn is of about the same relative angle and\r\nheight as that of an adult cow buffalo. The specimen itself is well\r\nrepresented in the accompanying plate.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of this specimen in the flesh were as follows:\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|       BISON AMERICANUS.

The first signs of the change, however, appear about a month\r\nearlier than that, in the darkening of the mane under the throat, and\r\nalso on the top of the neck.[26]\r\n\r\n[Note 26: Our captive had, in some way, bruised the skin on his\r\nforehead, and in June all the hair came off the top of his head, leaving\r\nit quite bald. We kept the skin well greased with porpoise oil, and by\r\nthe middle of July a fine coat of black hair had grown out all over the\r\nsurface that had previously been bare.]\r\n\r\nBy the 1st of August the red hair on the body begins to fall off in\r\nsmall patches, and the growth of fine, new, dark hair seems to actually\r\ncrowd off the old. As is the case with the adult animals, the shortest\r\nhair is the first to be shed, but the change of coat takes place in\r\nabout half the time that it occupies in the older animals.\r\n\r\nBy the 1st of October the transformation is complete, and not even a\r\npatch of the old red hair remains upon the new suit of brown. This is\r\nfar from being the case with the old bulls and cows, for even up to the\r\nlast week in October we found them with an occasional patch of the old\r\nhair still clinging to the new, on the back or shoulders.\r\n\r\nLike most young animals, the calf of the buffalo is very easily tamed,\r\nespecially if taken when only a few weeks old. The one captured in\r\nMontana by the writer, resisted at first as stoutly as it was able, by\r\nbutting with its head, but after we had tied its legs together and\r\ncarried it to camp, across a horse, it made up its mind to yield\r\ngracefully to the inevitable, and from that moment became perfectly\r\ndocile. It very soon learned to drink milk in the most satisfactory\r\nmanner, and adapted itself to its new surroundings quite as readily as\r\nany domestic calf would have done. Its only cry was a low-pitched,\r\npig-like grunt through the nose, which was uttered only when hungry or\r\nthirsty.\r\n\r\nI have been told by old frontiersmen and buffalo-hunters that it used to\r\nbe a common practice for a hunter who had captured a young calf to make\r\nit follow him by placing one of his fingers in its mouth, and allowing\r\nthe calf to suck at it for a moment. Often a calf has been induced in\r\nthis way to follow a horseman for miles, and eventually to join his camp\r\noutfit. It is said that the same result has been accomplished with\r\ncalves by breathing a few times into their nostrils. In this connection\r\nMr. Catlin's observations on the habits of buffalo calves are most\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n\"In pursuing a large herd of buffaloes at the season when their calves\r\nare but a few weeks old, I have often been exceedingly amused with the\r\ncurious maneuvers of these shy little things. Amidst the thundering\r\nconfusion of a throng of several hundreds or several thousands of these\r\nanimals, there will be many of the calves that lose sight of their dams;\r\nand being left behind by the throng, and the swift-passing hunters, they\r\nendeavor to secrete themselves, when they are exceedingly put to it on a\r\nlevel prairie, where naught can be seen but the short grass of 6 or 8\r\ninches in height, save an occasional bunch of wild sage a few inches\r\nhigher, to which the poor affrighted things will run, and dropping on\r\ntheir knees, will push their noses under it and into the grass, where\r\nthey will stand for hours, with their eyes shut, imagining themselves\r\nsecurely hid, whilst they are standing up quite straight upon their hind\r\nfeet, and can easily be seen at several miles distance. It is a familiar\r\namusement with us, accustomed to these scenes, to retreat back over the\r\nground where we have just escorted the herd, and approach these little\r\ntrembling things, which stubbornly maintain their positions, with\r\ntheir noses pushed under the grass and their eyes strained upon us, us\r\nwe dismount from our horses and are passing around them. From this fixed\r\nposition they are sure not to move until hands are laid upon them, and\r\nthen for the shins of a novice we can extend our sympathy; or if he can\r\npreserve the skin on his bones from the furious buttings of its head, we\r\nknow how to congratulate him on his signal success and good luck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From photograph of group in National Museum. Engraved by\r\nR. H. Carson. BUFFALO COW, CALF (FOUR MONTHS OLD), AND YEARLING.\r\nReproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the\r\npublishers.]\r\n\r\n\"In these desperate struggles for a moment, the little thing is\r\nconquered, and makes no further resistance. And I have often, in\r\nconcurrence with a known custom of the country, held my hands over the\r\neyes of the calf and breathed a few strong breaths into its nostrils,\r\nafter which I have, with my hunting companions, rode several miles into\r\nour encampment with the little prisoner busily following the heels of my\r\nhorse the whole way, as closely and as affectionately as its instinct\r\nwould attach it to the company of its dam.\r\n\r\n\"This is one of the most extraordinary things that I have met with in\r\nthe habits of this wild country, and although I had often heard of it,\r\nand felt unable exactly to believe it, I am now willing to bear\r\ntestimony to the fact from the numerous instances which I have witnessed\r\nsince I came into the country. During the time that I resided at this\r\npost [mouth of the Tetón River] in the spring of the year, on my way up\r\nthe river, I assisted (in numerous hunts of the buffalo with the fur\r\ncompany's men) in bringing in, in the above manner, several of these\r\nlittle prisoners, which sometimes followed for 5 or 6 miles close to our\r\nhorse's heels, and even into the fur company's fort, and into the stable\r\nwhere our horses were led. In this way, before I left the headwaters of\r\nthe Missouri, I think we had collected about a dozen, which Mr. Laidlaw\r\nwas successfully raising with the aid of a good milch cow.\"[27]\r\n\r\n[Note 27: North American Indians, I, 255.]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that such cases as the above were\r\nexceptional, even with the very young calves, which alone exhibited the\r\ntrait described. Such instances occurred only when buffaloes existed in\r\nsuch countless numbers that man's presence and influence had not\r\naffected the character of the animal in the least. No such instances of\r\ninnocent stupidity will ever be displayed again, even by the youngest\r\ncalf. The war of extermination, and the struggle for life and security\r\nhave instilled into the calf, even from its birth, a mortal fear of both\r\nmen and horses, and the instinct to fly for life. The calf captured by\r\nour party was not able to run, but in the most absurd manner it butted\r\nour horses as soon as they came near enough, and when Private Moran\r\nattempted to lay hold of the little fellow it turned upon him, struck\r\nhim in the stomach with its head, and sent him sprawling into the\r\nsage-brush. If it had only possessed the strength, it would have led us\r\na lively chase.\r\n\r\nDuring 1886 four other buffalo calves were either killed or caught by\r\nthe cowboys on the Missouri-Yellowstone divide, in the Dry Creek\r\nregion. All of them ran the moment they discovered their enemies. Two\r\nwere shot and killed. One was caught by a cowboy named Horace Brodhurst,\r\near marked, and turned loose. The fifth one was caught in September on\r\nthe Porcupine Creek round-up. He was then about five months old, and\r\nbeing abundantly able to travel he showed a clean pair of heels. It took\r\nthree fresh horses, one after another, to catch him, and his final\r\ncapture was due to exhaustion, and not to the speed of any of his\r\npursuers. The distance covered by the chase, from the point where his\r\nfirst pursuer started to where the third one finally lassoed him, was\r\nconsidered to be at least 15 miles. But the capture came to naught, for\r\non the following day the calf died from overexertion and want of milk.\r\n\r\nColonel Dodge states that the very young calves of a herd have to depend\r\nupon the old bulls for protection, and seldom in vain. The mothers\r\nabandon their offspring on slight provocation, and even none at all\r\nsometimes, if we may judge from the condition of the little waif that\r\nfell into our hands. Had its mother remained with it, or even in its\r\nneighborhood, we should at least have seen her, but she was nowhere\r\nwithin a radius of 5 miles at the time her calf was discovered. Nor did\r\nshe return to look for it, as two of us proved by spending the night in\r\nthe sage-brush at the very spot where the calf was taken. Colonel Dodge\r\ndeclares that \"the cow seems to possess scarcely a trace of maternal\r\ninstinct, and, when frightened, will abandon and run away from her calf\r\nwithout the slightest hesitation. * * * When the calves are young they\r\nare always kept in the center of each small herd, while the bulls\r\ndispose themselves on the outside.\"[28]\r\n\r\n[Note 28: Plains of the Great West, pp. 124, 125.]\r\n\r\nApparently the maternal instinct of the cow buffalo was easily mastered\r\nby fear. That it was often manifested, however, is proven by the\r\nfollowing from Audubon and Bachman:[29]\r\n\r\n[Note 29: Quadrupeds of North America, vol. II, pp. 38, 39.]\r\n\r\n\"Buffalo calves are drowned from being unable to ascend the steep banks\r\nof the rivers across which they have just swam, as the cows cannot help\r\nthem, although they stand near the bank, and will not leave them to\r\ntheir fate unless something alarms them.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion Mr. Kipp, of the American Fur Company, caught eleven\r\ncalves, their dams all the time standing near the top of the bank.\r\nFrequently, however, the cows leave the young to their fate, when most\r\nof them perish. In connection with this part of the subject, we may add\r\nthat we were informed, when on the Upper Missouri River, that when the\r\nbanks of that river were practicable for cows, and their calves could\r\nnot follow them, they went down again, after having gained the top, and\r\nwould remain by them until forced away by the cravings of hunger. When\r\nthus forced by the necessity of saving themselves to quit their young,\r\nthey seldom, if ever, return to them. When a large herd of these wild\r\nanimals are crossing a river, the calves or yearlings manage to get on\r\nthe backs of the cows, and are thus conveyed safely over.\"\r\n\r\n5. _The Yearling._--During the first five months of his life, the calf\r\nchanges its coat completely, and becomes in appearance a totally\r\ndifferent animal. By the time he is six months old he has taken on all\r\nthe colors which distinguish him in after life, excepting that upon his\r\nfore quarters. The hair on the head has started out to attain the\r\nluxuriant length and density which is so conspicuous in the adult, and\r\nits general color is a rich dark brown, shading to black under the chin\r\nand throat. The fringe under the neck is long, straight, and black, and\r\nthe under parts, the back of the fore arm, the outside of thigh, and the\r\ntail-tuft are all black.\r\n\r\nThe color of the shoulder, the side, and upper part of the hind quarter\r\nis a peculiar smoky brown (\"broccoli brown\" of Ridgway), having in\r\nconnection with the darker browns of the other parts a peculiar faded\r\nappearance, quite as if it were due to the bleaching power of the sun.\r\nOn the fore quarters there is none of the bright straw color so\r\ncharacteristic of the adult animal. Along the top of the neck and\r\nshoulders, however, this color has at last begun to show faintly. The\r\nhair on the body is quite luxuriant, both in length and density, in both\r\nrespects quite equaling, if not even surpassing, that of the finest\r\nadults. For example, the hair on the side of the mounted yearling in the\r\nMuseum group has a length of 2 to 21/2 inches, while that on the same\r\nregion of the adult bull, whose pelage is particularly fine, is recorded\r\nas being 2 inches only.\r\n\r\nThe horn is a straight, conical spike from 4 to 6 inches long, according\r\nto age, and perfectly black. The legs are proportionally longer and\r\nlarger in the joints than those of the full-grown animal. The\r\ncountenance of the yearling is quite interesting. The sleepy, helpless,\r\ninnocent expression of the very young calf has given place to a\r\nwide-awake, mischievous look, and he seems ready to break away and run\r\nat a second's notice.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of the yearling in the Museum group are as follows:\r\n\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|BISON AMERICANUS.

The curve of the horn is generally hidden in\r\nthe hair, and the only part visible is the straight, terminal spike.\r\nUsually the spike points diverge from each other, but often they are\r\nparallel, and also perpendicular. In the fourth year, however, the\r\npoints of the horns begin to curve inward toward each other, describing\r\nequal arcs of the same circle, as if they were going to meet over the\r\ntop of the head.\r\n\r\nIn the handsome young \"spike\" bull in the Museum group, the hair on the\r\nshoulders has begun to take on the length, the light color, and tufted\r\nappearance of the adult, beginning at the highest point of the hump and\r\ngradually spreading. Immediately back of this light patch the hair is\r\nlong, but dark and woolly in appearance. The leg tufts have doubled in\r\nlength, and reveal the character of the growth that may be finally\r\nexpected. The beard has greatly lengthened, as also has the hair upon\r\nthe bridge of the nose, the forehead, ears, jaws, and all other portions\r\nof the head except the cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe \"spike\" period of a buffalo is a most interesting one. Like a\r\nseventeen-year-old boy, the young bull shows his youth in so many ways\r\nit is always conspicuous, and his countenance is so suggestive of a\r\nhalf-bearded youth it fixes the interest to a marked degree. He is\r\nactive, alert, and suspicious, and when he makes up his mind to run the\r\nhunter may as well give up the chase.\r\n\r\nBy a strange fatality, our spike bull appears to be the only one in any\r\nmuseum, or even in preserved existence, as far as can be ascertained.\r\nOut of the twenty-five buffaloes killed and preserved by the Smithsonian\r\nexpedition, ten of which were adult bulls, this specimen was the only\r\nmale between the yearling and the adult ages. An effort to procure\r\nanother entire specimen of this age from Texas yielded only two spike\r\nheads. It is to be sincerely regretted that more specimens representing\r\nthis very interesting period of the buffalo's life have not been\r\npreserved, for it is now too late to procure wild specimens.\r\n\r\nThe following are the post-mortem dimensions of our specimen:\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                        BISON AMERICANUS.                      |\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|(\"Spike\" bull, two years old; taken October 14, 1886.

But the head\r\nis irresistible in its claims to precedence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIKE BULL. From the group in the National Museum.\r\nReproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the\r\npublishers.]\r\n\r\nIt must be observed at this point that in many respects this animal is\r\nan exceptionally fine one. In actual size of frame, and in quantity and\r\nquality of pelage, it is far superior to the average, even of wild\r\nbuffaloes when they were most numerous and at their best.[30] In one\r\nrespect, however, that of actual bulk, it is believed that this specimen\r\nmay have often been surpassed. When buffaloes were numerous, and not\r\nrequired to do any great amount of running in order to exist, they were,\r\nin the autumn months, very fat. Audubon says: \"A large bison bull will\r\ngenerally weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, and a fat cow about 1,200 pounds.\r\nWe weighed one of the bulls killed by our party, and found it to reach\r\n1,727 pounds, although it had already lost a good deal of blood. This\r\nwas an old bull, and not fat. It had probably weighed more at some\r\nprevious period.\"[31] Our specimen when killed (by the writer, December\r\n6, 1886) was in full vigor, superbly muscled, and well fed, but he\r\ncarried not a single pound of fat. For years the never-ceasing race for\r\nlife had utterly prevented the secretion of useless and cumbersome fat,\r\nand his \"subsistence\" had gone toward the development of useful muscle.\r\nHaving no means by which to weigh him, we could only estimate his\r\nweight, in which I called for the advice of my cowboys, all of whom were\r\nmore or less familiar with the weight of range cattle, and one I\r\nregarded as an expert. At first the estimated weight of the animal was\r\nfixed at 1,700 pounds, but with a constitutional fear of estimating over\r\nthe truth, I afterward reduced it to 1,600 pounds. This I am now well\r\nconvinced was an error, for I believe the first figure to have been\r\nnearer the truth.\r\n\r\n[Note 30: In testimony whereof the following extract from a letter\r\nwritten by General Stewart Van Vliet, on March 10, 1897, to Professor\r\nBaird, is of interest:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR PROFESSOR: On the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant I\r\nsaw General Sheridan, and yesterday we called on your taxidermist and\r\nexamined the buffalo bull he is setting up for the Museum. I don't think\r\nI have ever seen a more splendid specimen in my life. General Sheridan\r\nand I have seen millions of buffalo on the plains in former times. I\r\nhave killed hundreds, but I never killed a larger animal than the one in\r\nthe possession of your taxidermist.\"]\r\n\r\n[Note 31: Quadrupeds of North America, vol. II, p. 44.]\r\n\r\nIn mounting the skin of this animal, we endeavored by every means in our\r\npower, foremost of which were three different sets of measurements,\r\ntaken from the dead animal, one set to check another, to reproduce him\r\nwhen mounted in exactly the same form he possessed in life--muscular,\r\nbut not fat.\r\n\r\nThe color of the body and hindquarters of a buffalo is very peculiar,\r\nand almost baffles intelligent description. Audubon calls it \"between a\r\ndark umber and liver-shining brown.\" I once saw a competent artist\r\nexperiment with his oil-colors for a quarter of an hour before he\r\nfinally struck the combination which exactly matched the side of our\r\nlarge bull. To my eyes, the color is a pale gray-brown or smoky gray.\r\nThe range of individual variation is considerable, some being uniformly\r\ndarker than the average type, and others lighter. While the under parts\r\nof most adults are dark brown or blackish brown, others are actually\r\nblack. The hair on the body and hinder parts is fine, wavy on the\r\noutside, and woolly underneath, and very dense. Add to this the\r\nthickness of the skin itself, and the combination forms a covering that\r\nis almost impervious to cold.\r\n\r\nThe entire fore quarter region, _e. g._, the shoulders, the hump, and\r\nthe upper part of the neck, is covered with a luxuriant growth of pale\r\nyellow hair (Naples yellow + yellow ocher), which stands straight out in\r\na dense mass, disposed in handsome tufts. The hair is somewhat woolly in\r\nits nature, and the ends are as even as if the whole mass had lately\r\nbeen gone over with shears and carefully clipped. This hair is 4 inches\r\nin length. As the living animal moved his head from side to side, the\r\nhair parted in great vertical furrows, so deep that the skin itself\r\nseemed almost in sight. As before remarked, to comb this hair would\r\nutterly destroy its naturalness, and it should never be done under any\r\ncircumstances. Standing as it does between the darker hair of the body\r\non one side and the almost black mass of the head on the other, this\r\nlight area is rendered doubly striking and conspicuous by contrast. It\r\nnot only covers the shoulders, but extends back upon the thorax, where\r\nit abruptly terminates on a line corresponding to the sixth rib.\r\n\r\nFrom the shoulder-joint downward, the color shades gradually into a dark\r\nbrown until at the knee it becomes quite black. The huge fore-arm is\r\nlost in a thick mass of long, coarse, and rather straight hair 10 inches\r\nin length. This growth stops abruptly at the knee, but it hangs within 6\r\ninches of the hoof. The front side of this mass is blackish brown, but\r\nit rapidly shades backward and downward into jet-black.\r\n\r\nThe hair on the top of the head lies in a dense, matted mass, forming a\r\nperfect crown of rich brown (burnt sienna) locks, 16 inches in length,\r\nhanging over the eyes, almost enveloping both horns, and spreading back\r\nin rich, dark masses upon the light-colored neck.\r\n\r\nOn the cheeks the hair is of the same blackish brown color, but\r\ncomparatively short, and lies in beautiful waves. On the bridge of the\r\nnose the hair is about 6 inches in length and stands out in a thick,\r\nuniform, very curly mass, which always looks as if it had just been\r\ncarefully combed.\r\n\r\nImmediately around the nose and mouth the hair is very short, straight\r\nand stiff, and lies close to the skin, which leaves the nostrils and\r\nlips fully exposed. The front part of the chin is similarly clad, and\r\nits form is perfectly flat, due to the habit of the animal in feeding\r\nupon the short, crisp buffalo grass, in the course of which the chin is\r\npressed flat against the ground. The end of the muzzle is very massive,\r\nmeasuring 2 feet 2 inches in circumference just back of the nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe hair of the chin-beard is coarse, perfectly straight, jet black, and\r\n111/2 inches in length on our old bull.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a bull is met with who is a genuine Esau amongst his kind.\r\nI once saw a bull, of medium size but fully adult, whose hair was a\r\nwonder to behold. I have now in my possession a small lock of hair which\r\nI plucked from his forehead, and its length is 221/2 inches. His horns\r\nwere entirely concealed by the immense mass of long hair that nature had\r\npiled upon his head, and his beard was as luxuriant as his frontlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULL BUFFALO IN NATIONAL MUSEUM GROUP. Drawn by Ernest E.\r\nThompson.]\r\n\r\nThe nostril opening is large and wide. The color of the hairless\r\nportions of the nose and mouth is shiny Vandyke brown and black, with a\r\nstrong tinge of bluish-purple, but this latter tint is not noticeable\r\nsave upon close examination, and the eyelid is the same. The iris is of\r\nan irregular pear-shaped outline, 1-5/16 inches in its longest diameter,\r\nvery dark, reddish brown in color, with a black edging all around it.\r\nOrdinarily no portion of the white eyeball is visible, but the broad\r\nblack band surrounding the iris, and a corner patch of white, is\r\nfrequently shown by the turning of the eye. The tongue is bluish purple,\r\nas are the lips inside.\r\n\r\nThe hoofs and horns are, in reality, jet black throughout, but the horn\r\noften has at the base a scaly, dead appearance on the outside, and as\r\nthe wrinkles around the base increase with age and scale up and gather\r\ndirt, that part looks gray. The horns of bulls taken in their prime are\r\nsmooth, glossy black, and even look as if they had been half polished\r\nwith oil.\r\n\r\nAs the bull increases in age, the outer layers of the horn begin to\r\nbreak off at the tip and pile up one upon another, until the horn has\r\nbecome a thick, blunt stub, with only the tip of what was once a neat\r\nand shapely point showing at the end. The bull is then known as a\r\n\"stub-horn,\" and his horns increase in roughness and unsightliness as he\r\ngrows older. From long rubbing on the earth, the outer curve of each\r\nhorn is gradually worn flat, which still further mars its symmetry.\r\n\r\nThe horns serve as a fair index of the age of a bison. After he is three\r\nyears old, the bison adds each year a ring around the base of his horns,\r\nthe same as domestic cattle. If we may judge by this, the horn begins to\r\nbreak when the bison is about ten or eleven years old, and the stubbing\r\nprocess gradually continues during the rest of his life. Judging by the\r\nteeth, and also the oldest horns I have seen, I am of the opinion that\r\nthe natural life time of the bison is about twenty-five years; certainly\r\nno less.\r\n\r\n+--------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                   BISON AMERICANUS.                    |\r\n|                (Male, eleven years old.                |\r\n|           Taken December 6, 1866.

The hair on the\r\nlower joints of the leg is in turn lighter, being about the same shade\r\nas that on the loins. The fore-arm is concealed in a mass of almost\r\nblack hair, which gradually shades lighter from the elbow upward and\r\nalong the whole region of the humerus. On the shoulder itself the hair\r\nis pale yellow or straw-color (Naples yellow + yellow ocher), which\r\nextends down in a point toward the elbow. From the back of the head a\r\nconspicuous baud of curly, dark-brown hair extends back like a mane\r\nalong the neck and to the top of the hump, beyond which it soon fades\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe hair on the head is everywhere a rich burnt-sienna brown, except\r\naround the corners of the mouth, where it shades into black.\r\n\r\nThe horns of the cow bison are slender, but solid for about two-thirds\r\nof their length from the tip, ringed with age near their base, and quite\r\nblack. Very often they are imperfect in shape, and out of every five\r\npairs at least one is generally misshapen. Usually one horn is\r\n\"crumpled,\" _e. g._, dwarfed in length and unnaturally thickened at the\r\nbase, and very often one horn is found to be merely an unsightly,\r\nmisshapen stub.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From a photograph.

Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by\r\npermission of the publishers.]\r\n\r\nThe udder of the cow bison is very small, as might be expected of an\r\nanimal which must do a great deal of hard traveling, but the milk is\r\nsaid to be very rich. Some authorities declare that it requires the\r\nmilk of two domestic cows to satisfy one buffalo calf, but this, I\r\nthink, is an error. Our calf began in May to consume 6 quarts of\r\ndomestic milk daily, which by June 10 had increased to 8, and up to July\r\n10, 9 quarts was the utmost it could drink. By that time it began to eat\r\ngrass, but the quantity of milk disposed of remained about the same.\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                       BISON AMERICANUS.                       |\r\n|(Adult cow, eight years old.

While most Rocky Mountain hunters consider the\r\nbison of the mountains quite distinct from that of the plains, it must\r\nbe remarked that no two authorities quite agree in regard to the\r\ndistinguishing characters of the variety they recognize. Colonel Dodge\r\nstates that \"His body is lighter, whilst his legs are shorter, but much\r\nthicker and stronger, than the plains animal, thus enabling him to\r\nperform feats of climbing and tumbling almost incredible in such a huge\r\nand unwieldy beast.\"[32]\r\n\r\n[Note 32: Plains of the Great West, p. 144.]\r\n\r\nThe belief in the existence of a distinct mountain variety is quite\r\ncommon amongst hunters and frontiersmen all along the eastern slope the\r\nRocky Mountains as far north as the Peace River. In this connection the\r\nfollowing from Professor Henry Youle Hind[33] is of general interest:\r\n\r\n[Note 33: Red River, Assinniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition, II p.\r\n104-105.]\r\n\r\n\"The existence of two kinds of buffalo is firmly believed by many\r\nhunters at Red River; they are stated to be the prairie buffalo and the\r\nbuffalo of the woods. Many old hunters with whom I have conversed on\r\nthis subject aver that the so-called wood buffalo is a distinct species,\r\nand although they are not able to offer scientific proofs, yet the\r\ndifference in size, color, hair, and horns, are enumerated as the\r\nevidence upon which they base their statement. Men from their youth\r\nfamiliar with these animals in the great plains, and the varieties which\r\nare frequently met with in large herds, still cling to this opinion. The\r\nbuffalo of the plains are not always of the dark and rich bright brown\r\nwhich forms their characteristic color. They are sometimes seen from\r\nwhite to almost black, and a gray buffalo is not at all uncommon.\r\nBuffalo emasculated by wolves are often found on the prairies, where\r\nthey grow to an immense size; the skin of the buffalo ox is recognized\r\nby the shortness of the wool and by its large dimensions. The skin of\r\nthe so-called wood buffalo is much larger than that of the common\r\nanimal, the hair is very short, mane or hair about the neck short and\r\nsoft, and altogether destitute of curl, which is the common feature in\r\nthe hair or wool of the prairie animal. Two skins of the so-called wood\r\nbuffalo, which I saw at Selkirk Settlement, bore a very close\r\nresemblance to the skin of the Lithuanian bison, judging from the\r\nspecimens of that species which I have since had an opportunity of\r\nseeing in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\"The wood buffalo is stated to be very scarce, and only found north of\r\nthe Saskatchewan and on the flanks of the Rocky Mountains. It never\r\nventures into the open plains. The prairie buffalo, on the contrary,\r\ngenerally avoids the woods in summer and keeps to the open country; but\r\nin winter they are frequently found in the woods of the Little Souris,\r\nSaskatchewan, the Touchwood Hills, and the aspen groves on the\r\nQu'Appelle. There is no doubt that formerly the prairie buffalo ranged\r\nthrough open woods almost as much as he now does through the prairies.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison S. Young, an officer of the Hudson's Bay Fur Company,\r\nstationed at Fort Edmonton, writes me as follows in a letter dated\r\nOctober 22, 1887: \"In our district of Athabasca, along the Salt River,\r\nthere are still a few wood buffalo killed every year; but they are fast\r\ndiminishing in numbers, and are also becoming very shy.\"\r\n\r\nIn Prof. John Macoun's \"Manitoba and the Great Northwest,\" page 342,\r\nthere occurs the following reference to the wood buffalo: \"In the winter\r\nof 1870 the last buffalo were killed north of Peace River; but in 1875\r\nabout one thousand head were still in existence between the Athabasca\r\nand Peace Rivers, north of Little Slave Lake. These are called wood\r\nbuffalo by the hunters, but diner only in size from those of the plain.\"\r\n\r\nIn the absence of facts based on personal observations, I may be\r\npermitted to advance an opinion in regard to the wood buffalo. There is\r\nsome reason for the belief that certain changes of form may have taken\r\nplace in the buffaloes that have taken up a permanent residence in\r\nrugged and precipitous mountain regions. Indeed, it is hardly possible\r\nto understand how such a radical change in the habitat of an animal\r\ncould fail, through successive generations, to effect certain changes in\r\nthe animal itself. It seems to me that the changes which would take\r\nplace in a band of plains buffaloes transferred to a permanent mountain\r\nhabitat can be forecast with a marked degree of certainty. The changes\r\nthat take place under such conditions in cattle, swine, and goats are\r\nwell known, and similar causes would certainly produce similar results\r\nin the buffalo.\r\n\r\nThe scantier feed of the mountains, and the great waste of vital energy\r\ncalled for in procuring it, would hardly produce a larger buffalo than\r\nthe plains-fed animal, who acquires an abundance of daily food of the\r\nbest quality with but little effort.\r\n\r\nWe should expect to see the mountain buffalo smaller in body than the\r\nplains animal, with better leg development, and particularly with\r\nstronger hind quarters. The pelvis of the plains buffalo is surprisingly\r\nsmall and weak for so large an animal. Beyond question, constant\r\nmountain climbing is bound to develop a maximum of useful muscle and\r\nbone and a minimum of useless fat. If the loss of mane sustained by the\r\nAfrican lions who live in bushy localities may be taken as an index, we\r\nshould expect the bison of the mountains, especially the \"wood buffalo,\"\r\nto lose a great deal of his shaggy frontlet and mane on the bushes and\r\ntrees which surrounded him. Therefore, we would naturally expect to find\r\nthe hair on those parts shorter and in far less perfect condition than\r\non the bison of the treeless prairies. By reason of the more shaded\r\ncondition of his home, and the decided mitigation of the sun's\r\nfierceness, we should also expect to see his entire pelage of a darker\r\ntone. That he would acquire a degree of agility and strength unknown in\r\nhis relative of the plain is reasonably certain. In the course of many\r\ncenturies the change in his form might become well defined, constant,\r\nand conspicuous; but at present there is apparently not the slightest\r\nground for considering that the \"mountain buffalo\" or \"wood buffalo\" is\r\nentitled to rank even as a variety of _Bison americanus_.\r\n\r\nColonel Dodge has recorded some very interesting information in regard\r\nto the \"mountain, or wood buffalo,\" which deserves to be quoted\r\nentire.[34]\r\n\r\n[Note 34: Plains of the Great West, p. 144-147.]\r\n\r\n\"In various portions of the Rocky Mountains, especially in the region of\r\nthe parks, is found an animal which old mountaineers call the 'bison.'\r\nThis animal bears about the same relation to a plains buffalo as a\r\nsturdy mountain pony does to an American horse. His body is lighter,\r\nwhilst his legs are shorter, but much thicker and stronger, than the\r\nplains animal, thus enabling him to perform feats of climbing and\r\ntumbling almost incredible in such a huge and apparently unwieldy beast.\r\n\r\n\"These animals are by no means plentiful, and are moreover excessively\r\nshy, inhabiting the deepest, darkest defiles, or the craggy, almost\r\nprecipitous, sides of mountains inaccessible to any but the most\r\npracticed mountaineers.\r\n\r\n\"From the tops of the mountains which rim the parks the rains of ages\r\nhave cut deep gorges, which plunge with brusque abruptness, but\r\nnevertheless with great regularity, hundreds or even thousands of feet\r\nto the valley below. Down the bottom of each such gorge a clear, cold\r\nstream of purest water, fertilizing a narrow belt of a few feet of\r\nalluvial, and giving birth and growth, to a dense jungle of spruce,\r\nquaking asp, and other mountain trees. One side of the gorge is\r\ngenerally a thick forest of pine, while the other side is a meadow-like\r\npark, covered with splendid grass. Such gorges are the favorite haunt of\r\nthe mountain buffalo. Early in the morning he enjoys a bountiful\r\nbreakfast of the rich nutritious grasses, quenches his thirst with the\r\nfinest water, and, retiring just within the line of jungle, where,\r\nhimself unseen, he can scan the open, he crouches himself in the long\r\ngrass and reposes in comfort and security until appetite calls him to\r\nhis dinner late in the evening. Unlike their plains relative, there is\r\nno stupid staring at an intruder. At the first symptom of danger they\r\ndisappear like magic in the thicket, and never stop until far removed\r\nfrom even the apprehension of pursuit. I have many times come upon their\r\nfresh tracks, upon the beds from which they had first sprung in alarm,\r\nbut I have never even seen one.\r\n\r\n\"I have wasted much time and a great deal of wind in vain endeavors to\r\nadd one of these animals to my bag. My figure is no longer adapted to\r\nmountain climbing, and the possession of a bison's head of my own\r\nkilling is one of my blighted hopes.\r\n\r\n\"Several of my friends have been more fortunate, but I know of no\r\nsportsman who has bagged more than one.[35]\r\n\r\n[Note 35: Foot-note by William Blackmore: \"The author is in error here,\r\nas in a point of the Tarryall range of mountains, between Pike's Peak\r\nand the South Park, in the autumn of 1871, two mountain buffaloes were\r\nkilled in one afternoon. The skin of the finer was presented to Dr.\r\nFrank Buckland.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Old mountaineers and trappers have given me wonderful accounts of the\r\nnumber of these animals in all the mountain region 'many years ago;' and\r\nI have been informed by them, that their present rarity is due to the\r\ngreat snow-storm of 1844-'45, of which I have already spoken as\r\ndestroying the plains buffalo in the Laramie country.\r\n\r\n\"One of my friends, a most ardent and pertinacious sportsman, determined\r\non the possession of a bison's head, and, hiring a guide, plunged into\r\nthe mountain wilds which separate the Middle from South Park. After\r\nseveral days fresh tracks were discovered. Turning their horses loose on\r\na little gorge park, such as described, they started on foot on the\r\ntrail; for all that day they toiled and scrambled with the utmost\r\ncaution--now up, now down, through deep and narrow gorges and pine\r\nthickets, over bare and rocky crags, sleeping where night overtook them.\r\nBetimes next morning they pushed on the trail, and about 11 o'clock,\r\nwhen both were exhausted and well-nigh disheartened, their route was\r\nintercepted by a precipice. Looking over, they descried, on a projecting\r\nledge several hundred feet below, a herd of about 20 bisons lying down.\r\nThe ledge was about 300 feet at widest, by probably 1,000 feet long. Its\r\ninner boundary was the wall of rock on the top of which they stood; its\r\nouter appeared to be a sheer precipice of at least 200 feet. This ledge\r\nwas connected with the slope of the mountain by a narrow neck. The wind\r\nbeing right, the hunters succeeded in reaching this neck unobserved. My\r\nfriend selected a magnificent head, that of a fine bull, young but full\r\ngrown, and both fired. At the report the bisons all ran to the far end\r\nof the ledge and plunged over.\r\n\r\n\"Terribly disappointed, the hunters ran to the spot, and found that they\r\nhad gone down a declivity, not actually a precipice, but so steep that\r\nthe hunters could not follow them.\r\n\r\n\"At the foot lay a bison. A long, a fatiguing detour brought them to the\r\nspot, and in the animal lying dead before him my friend recognized his\r\nbull--his first and last mountain buffalo. Hone but a true sportsman can\r\nappreciate his feelings.\r\n\r\n\"The remainder of the herd was never seen after the great plunge, down\r\nwhich it is doubtful if even a dog could have followed unharmed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the issue of Forest and Stream of June 14, 1888, Dr. R. W. Shufeldt,\r\nin an article entitled \"The American Buffalo,\" relates a very\r\ninteresting experience with buffaloes which were pronounced to be of the\r\n\"mountain\" variety, and his observations on the animals are well worth\r\nreproducing here. The animals (eight in number) were encountered on the\r\nnorthern slope of the Big Horn Mountains, in the autumn of 1877. \"We\r\ncame upon them during a fearful blizzard of heavy hail, during which our\r\nanimals could scarcely retain their feet. In fact, the packer's mule\r\nabsolutely lay down on the ground rather than risk being blown down the\r\nmountain side, and my own horse, totally unable to face such a violent\r\nblow and the pelting hail (the stones being as large as big marbles),\r\npositively stood stock-still, facing an old buffalo bull that was not\r\nmore than 25 feet in front of me. * * * Strange to say, this fearful\r\ngust did not last more than ten minutes, when it stopped as suddenly as\r\nit had commenced, and I deliberately killed my old buffalo at one shot,\r\njust where he stood, and, separating two other bulls from the rest,\r\ncharged them down a rugged ravine. They passed over this and into\r\nanother one, but with less precipitous sides and no trees in the way,\r\nand when I was on top of the intervening ridge I noticed that the\r\nlargest bull had halted in the bottom. Checking my horse, an excellent\r\nbuffalo hunter, I fired down at him without dismounting. The ball merely\r\nbarked his shoulder, and to my infinite surprise he turned and charged\r\nme up the hill. * * * Stepping to one side of my horse, with the\r\ncharging and infuriated bull not 10 feet to my front, I fired upon him,\r\nand the heavy ball took him square in the chest, bringing him to his\r\nknees, with a gush of scarlet blood from his mouth and nostrils. * * *\r\n\r\n\"Upon examining the specimen, I found it to be an old bull, apparently\r\nsmaller and very much blacker than the ones I had seen killed on the\r\nplains only a day or so before. Then I examined the first one I had\r\nshot, as well as others which were killed by the packer from the same\r\nbunch, and I came to the conclusion that they were typical\r\nrepresentatives of the variety known as the 'mountain buffalo,' a form\r\nmuch more active in movement, of slighter limbs, blacker, and far more\r\ndangerous to attack. My opinion in the premises remains unaltered\r\nto-day. In all this I may be mistaken, but it was also the opinion held\r\nby the old buffalo hunter who accompanied me, and who at once remarked\r\nwhen he saw them that they were 'mountain buffalo,' and not the plains\r\nvariety. * * *\r\n\r\n\"These specimens were not actually measured by me in either case, and\r\ntheir being considered smaller only rested upon my judging them by my\r\neye. But they were of a softer pelage, black, lighter in limb, and when\r\ndiscovered were in the timber, on the side of the Big Horn Mountains.\"\r\n\r\nThe band of bison in the Yellowstone Park must, of necessity, be of the\r\nso-called \"wood\" or \"mountain\" variety, and if by any chance one of its\r\nmembers ever dies of old age, it is to be hoped its skin may be\r\ncarefully preserved and sent to the National Museum to throw some\r\nfurther light on this question.\r\n\r\n11. _The shedding of the winter pelage._--In personal appearance the\r\nbuffalo is subject to striking, and even painful, variations, and the\r\nestimate an observer forms of him is very apt to depend upon the time of\r\nthe year at which the observation is made. Toward the end of the winter\r\nthe whole coat has become faded and bleached by the action of the sun,\r\nwind, snow, and rain, until the freshness of its late autumn colors has\r\ntotally disappeared. The bison takes on a seedy, weathered, and rusty\r\nlook. But this is not a circumstance to what happens to him a little\r\nlater. Promptly with the coming of the spring, if not even in the last\r\nweek of February, the buffalo begins the shedding of his winter coat. It\r\nis a long and difficult task, and with commendable energy he sets about\r\nit at the earliest possible moment. It lasts him more than half the\r\nyear, and is attended with many positive discomforts.\r\n\r\nThe process of shedding is accomplished in two ways: by the new hair\r\ngrowing into and forcing off the old, and by the old hair falling off in\r\ngreat patches, leaving the skin bare. On the heavily-haired\r\nportions--the head, neck, fore quarters, and hump--the old hair stops\r\ngrowing, dies, and the new hair immediately starts through the skin and\r\nforces it off. The new hair grows so rapidly, and at the same time so\r\ndensely, that it forces itself into the old, becomes hopelessly\r\nentangled with it, and in time actually lifts the old hair clear of the\r\nskin. On the head the new hair is dark brown or black, but on the neck,\r\nfore quarters, and hump it has at first, and indeed until it is 2 inches\r\nin length, a peculiar gray or drab color, mixed with brown, totally\r\ndifferent from its final and natural color. The new hair starts first on\r\nthe head, but the actual shedding of the old hair is to be seen first\r\nalong the lower parts of the neck and between the fore legs. The\r\nheavily-haired parts are never bare, but, on the contrary, the amount of\r\nhair upon them is about the same all the year round. The old and the new\r\nhair cling together with provoking tenacity long after the old coat\r\nshould fall, and on several of the bulls we killed in October there were\r\npatches of it still sticking tightly to the shoulders, from which it\r\nhad to be forcibly plucked away. Under all such patches the new hair was\r\nof a different color from that around them.\r\n\r\nThe other process of shedding takes place on the body and hind quarters,\r\nfrom which the old hair loosens and drops off in great woolly flakes a\r\nfoot square, more or less. The shedding takes place very unevenly, the\r\nold hair remaining much longer in some places than in others. During\r\nApril, May, and June the body and hind quarters present a most ludicrous\r\nand even pitiful spectacle. The island-like patches of persistent old\r\nhair alternating with patches of bare brown skin are adorned (?) by\r\ngreat ragged streamers of loose hair, which flutter in the wind like\r\nsignals of distress. Whoever sees a bison at this period is filled with\r\na desire to assist nature by plucking off the flying streamers of old\r\nhair; but the bison never permits anything of the kind, however good\r\none's intentions may be. All efforts to dislodge the old hair are\r\nresisted to the last extremity, and the buffalo generally acts as if the\r\nintention were to deprive him of his skin itself. By the end of June, if\r\nnot before, the body and hind quarters are free from the old hair, and\r\nas bare as the hide of a hippopotamus. The naked skin has a shiny brown\r\nappearance, and of course the external anatomy of the animal is very\r\ndistinctly revealed. But for the long hair on the fore quarters, neck,\r\nand head the bison would lose all his dignity of appearance with his\r\nhair. As it is, the handsome black head, which is black with new hair as\r\nearly as the first of May, redeems the animal from utter homeliness.\r\n\r\nAfter the shedding of the body hair, the naked skin of the buffalo is\r\nburned by the sun and bitten by flies until he is compelled to seek a\r\npool of water, or even a bed of soft mud, in which to roll and make\r\nhimself comfortable. He wallows, not so much because he is so fond of\r\neither water or mud, but in self-defense; and when he emerges from his\r\nwallow, plastered with mud from head to tail, his degradation is\r\ncomplete. He is then simply not fit to be seen, even by his best\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nBy the first of October, a complete and wonderful transformation has\r\ntaken place. The buffalo stands forth clothed in a complete new suit of\r\nhair, fine, clean, sleek, and bright in color, not a speck of dirt nor a\r\nlock awry anywhere. To be sure, it is as yet a trifle short on the body,\r\nwhere it is not over an inch in length, and hardly that; but it is\r\ngrowing rapidly and getting ready for winter.\r\n\r\nFrom the 20th of November to the 20th of December the pelage is at its\r\nvery finest. By the former date it has attained its full growth, its\r\ncolors are at their brightest, and nothing has been lost either by the\r\nelements or by accidental causes. To him who sees an adult bull at this\r\nperiod, or near it, the grandeur of the animal is irresistibly felt.\r\nAfter seeing buffaloes of all ages in the spring and summer months the\r\ncontrast afforded by those seen in October, November, and December was\r\nmost striking and impressive. In the later period, as different\r\nindividuals were wounded and brought to bay at close quarters, their\r\nhair was so clean and well-kept, that more than once I was led to\r\nexclaim: \"He looks as if he had just been combed.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked, however, that the long hair of the head and fore\r\nquarters is disposed in locks or tufts, and to comb it in reality would\r\nutterly destroy its natural and characteristic appearance.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the pelage of the domesticated bison, the only\r\nrepresentatives of the species which will be found alive ten years\r\nhence, will in all likelihood develop differently from that of the wild\r\nanimal, it may some time in the future be of interest to know the\r\nlength, by careful measurement, of the hair found on carefully-selected\r\ntypical wild specimens. To this end the following measurements are\r\ngiven. It must be borne in mind that these specimens were not chosen\r\nbecause their pelage was particularly luxuriant, but rather because they\r\nare fine average specimens.\r\n\r\nThe hair of the adult bull is by no means as long as I have seen on a\r\nbison, although perhaps not many have greatly surpassed it. It is with\r\nthe lower animals as with man--the length of the hairy covering is an\r\nindividual character only. I have in my possession a tuft of hair, from\r\nthe frontlet of a rather small bull bison, which measures 221/2 inches\r\nin length. The beard on the specimen from which this came was\r\ncorrespondingly long, and the entire pelage was of wonderful length and\r\ndensity.\r\n\r\nLENGTH OF THE HAIR OF BISON AMERICANUS.\r\n\r\n[Measurements, in inches, of the pelage of the specimens composing the\r\ngroup in the National Museum.]\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                    |Old    |Old     |Spike   |Young   |Yearling|Young |\r\n|                    |bull,  |cow,    |bull,   |cow,    |calf,   |calf, |\r\n|                    |killed |killed  |killed  |killed  |killed  |four  |\r\n|                    |Dec. 6.|Nov. 18.|Oct. 14.|Oct. 14.|Oct. 31.|months|\r\n|Length of:          |       |        |        |        |        |old.  |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+\r\n|hair on the shoulder|       |        |        |        |        |      |\r\n|(over scapula)      |   33/4  |   43/4   |   31/2   |   31/4   |   3    |  11/2  |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+\r\n|hair on top of hump |   61/2  |   7    |   51/4   |   51/2   |   41/2   |  2   |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+\r\n|hair on the middle  |       |        |        |        |        |      |\r\n|of the side         |   2   |   11/2   |   21/2   |   11/2   |   21/4   |  11/4  |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+\r\n|hair on the         |       |        |        |        |        |      |\r\n|hind quarter        |   13/4  |   11/4   |    3/4   |    3/4   |   2    |  1   |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+\r\n|hair on the         |       |        |        |        |        |      |\r\n|forehead            |  16   |   81/2   |   61/2   |   5    |   31/2   |   1/2  |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+\r\n|the chin beard      |  111/2  |   91/2   |   63/4   |   5    |   5    |  0   |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+\r\n|the breast tuft     |   8   |   81/2   |   8    |   6    |   5    |  3   |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+\r\n|tuft on fore leg    |  101/2  |   8    |   8    |   41/2   |   3    |  11/2  |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------+\r\n|the tail tuft       |  19   |  15    |  15    |  13    |   71/2   |  41/2  |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n_Albinism._--Cases of albinism in the buffalo were of extremely rare\r\noccurrence. I have met many old buffalo hunters, who had killed\r\nthousands and seen scores of thousands of buffaloes, yet never had seen\r\na white one. From all accounts it appears that not over ten or eleven\r\nwhite buffaloes, or white buffalo skins, were ever seen by white men.\r\nPied individuals were occasionally obtained, but even they were rare.\r\nAlbino buffaloes were always so highly prized that not a single one, so\r\nfar as I can learn, ever had the good fortune to attain adult size,\r\ntheir appearance being so striking, in contrast with the other members\r\nof the herd, as to draw upon them an unusual number of enemies, and\r\ncause their speedy destruction.\r\n\r\nAt the New Orleans Exposition, in 1884-'85, the Territory of Dakota\r\nexhibited, amongst other Western quadrupeds, the mounted skin of a\r\ntwo-year-old buffalo which might fairly be called an albino. Although\r\nnot really white, it was of a uniform dirty cream-color, and showed not\r\na trace of the bison's normal color on any part of its body.\r\n\r\nLieut. Col. S. C. Kellogg, U. S. Army, has on deposit in the National\r\nMuseum a tanned skin which is said to have come from a buffalo. It is\r\nfrom an animal about one year old, and the hair upon it, which is short,\r\nvery curly or wavy, and rather coarse, is pure white. In length and\r\ntexture the hair does not in any one respect resemble the hair of a\r\nyearling buffalo save in one particular,--along the median line of the\r\nneck and hump there is a rather long, thin mane of hair, which has the\r\npeculiar woolly appearance of genuine buffalo hair on those parts. On\r\nthe shoulder portions of the skin the hair is as short as on the hind\r\nquarters. I am inclined to believe this rather remarkable specimen came\r\nfrom a wild half-breed calf, the result of a cross between a white\r\ndomestic cow and a buffalo bull. At one time it was by no means uncommon\r\nfor small bunches of domestic cattle to enter herds of buffalo and\r\nremain there permanently.\r\n\r\nI have been informed that the late General Marcy possessed a white\r\nbuffalo skin. If it is still in existence, and is really _white_, it is\r\nto be hoped that so great a rarity may find a permanent abiding place in\r\nsome museum where the remains of _Bison americanus_ are properly\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE HABITS OF THE BUFFALO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the buffalo's daily life and habits should begin with the\r\n\"running season.\" This period occupied the months of August and\r\nSeptember, and was characterized by a degree of excitement and activity\r\nthroughout the entire herd quite foreign to the ease-loving and even\r\nslothful nature which was so noticeable a feature of the bison's\r\ncharacter at all other times.\r\n\r\nThe mating season occurred when the herd was on its summer range. The\r\nspring calves were from two to four months old. Through continued\r\nfeasting on the new crop of buffalo-grass and bunch-grass--the most\r\nnutritious in the world, perhaps--every buffalo in the herd had grown\r\nround-sided, fat, and vigorous. The faded and weather-beaten suit of\r\nwinter hair had by that time fallen off and given place to the new coat\r\nof dark gray and black, and, excepting for the shortness of his hair,\r\nthe buffalo was in prime condition.\r\n\r\nDuring the \"running season,\" as it was called by the plainsmen, the\r\nwhole nature of the herd was completely changed. Instead of being broken\r\nup into countless small groups and dispersed over a vast extent of\r\nterritory, the herd came together in a dense and confused mass of many\r\nthousand individuals, so closely congregated as to actually blacken the\r\nface of the landscape. As if by a general and irresistible impulse,\r\nevery straggler would be drawn to the common center, and for miles on\r\nevery side of the great herd the country would be found entirely\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nAt this time the herd itself became a seething mass of activity and\r\nexcitement. As usual under such conditions, the bulls were half the time\r\nchasing the cows, and fighting each other during the other half. These\r\nactual combats, which were always of short duration and over in a few\r\nseconds after the actual collision took place, were preceded by the\r\nusual threatening demonstrations, in which the bull lowers his head\r\nuntil his nose almost touches the ground, roars like a fog-horn until\r\nthe earth seems to fairly tremble with the vibration, glares madly upon\r\nhis adversary with half-white eyeballs, and with his forefeet paws up\r\nthe dry earth and throws it upward in a great cloud of dust high above\r\nhis back. At such times the mingled roaring--it can not truthfully be\r\ndescribed as lowing or bellowing--of a number of huge bulls unite and\r\nform a great volume of sound like distant thunder, which has often been\r\nheard at a distance of from 1 to 3 miles. I have even been assured by\r\nold plainsmen that under favorable atmospheric conditions such sounds\r\nhave been heard five miles.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the extreme frequency of combats between the bulls\r\nduring this season, their results were nearly always harmless, thanks to\r\nthe thickness of the hair and hide on the head and shoulders, and the\r\nstrength of the neck.\r\n\r\nUnder no conditions was there ever any such thing as the pairing off or\r\nmating of male and female buffaloes for any length of time. In the\r\nentire process of reproduction the bison's habits were similar to those\r\nof domestic cattle. For years the opinion was held by many, in some\r\ncases based on misinterpreted observations, that in the herd the\r\nidentity of each family was partially preserved, and that each old bull\r\nmaintained an individual harem and group of progeny of his own. The\r\nobservations of Colonel Dodge completely disprove this very interesting\r\ntheory; for at best it was only a picturesque fancy, ascribing to the\r\nbison a degree of intelligence which he never possessed.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the breeding season the herd quickly settles down to its\r\nnormal condition. The mass gradually resolves itself into the numerous\r\nbands or herdlets of from twenty to a hundred individuals, so\r\ncharacteristic of bison on their feeding grounds, and these gradually\r\nscatter in search of the best grass until the herd covers many square\r\nmiles of country.\r\n\r\nIn his search for grass the buffalo displayed but little intelligence or\r\npower of original thought. Instead of closely following the divides\r\nbetween water courses where the soil was best and grass most abundant,\r\nhe would not hesitate to wander away from good feeding-grounds into\r\nbarren \"bad lands,\" covered with sage-brush, where the grass was very\r\nthin and very poor. In such broken country as Montana, Wyoming, and\r\nsouthwestern Dakota, the herds, on reaching the best grazing grounds on\r\nthe divides, would graze there day after day until increasing thirst\r\ncompelled them to seek for water. Then, actuated by a common impulse,\r\nthe search for a water-hole was begun in a business-like way. The leader\r\nof a herd, or \"bunch,\" which post was usually filled by an old cow,\r\nwould start off down the nearest \"draw,\" or stream-heading, and all the\r\nrest would fall into line and follow her. From the moment this start was\r\nmade there was no more feeding, save as a mouthful of grass could be\r\nsnatched now and then without turning aside. In single file, in a line\r\nsometimes half a mile long and containing between one and two hundred\r\nbuffaloes, the procession slowly marched down the coulée, close\r\nalongside the gully as soon as the water-course began to cut a pathway\r\nfor itself. When the gully curved to right or left the leader would\r\ncross its bed and keep straight on until the narrow ditch completed its\r\nwayward curve and came back to the middle of the coulée. The trail of a\r\nherd in search of water is usually as good a piece of engineering as\r\ncould be executed by the best railway surveyor, and is governed by\r\nprecisely the same principles. It always follows the level of the\r\nvalley, swerves around the high points, and crosses the stream\r\nrepeatedly in order to avoid climbing up from the level. The same trail\r\nis used again and again by different herds until the narrow path, not\r\nover a foot in width, is gradually cut straight down into the soil to a\r\ndepth of several inches, as if it had been done by a 12-inch\r\ngrooving-plane. By the time the trail has been worn down to a depth of 6\r\nor 7 inches, without having its width increased in the least, it is no\r\nlonger a pleasant path to walk in, being too much like a narrow ditch.\r\nThen the buffaloes abandon it and strike out a new one alongside, which\r\nis used until it also is worn down and abandoned.\r\n\r\nTo day the old buffalo trails are conspicuous among the very few classes\r\nof objects which remain as a reminder of a vanished race. The herds of\r\ncattle now follow them in single file just as the buffaloes did a few\r\nyears ago, as they search for water in the same way. In some parts of\r\nthe West, in certain situations, old buffalo trails exist which the wild\r\nherds wore down to a depth of 2 feet or more.\r\n\r\nMile after mile marched the herd, straight down-stream, bound for the\r\nupper water-hole. As the hot summer drew on, the pools would dry up one\r\nby one, those nearest the source being the first to disappear. Toward\r\nthe latter part of summer, the journey for water was often a long one.\r\nHole after hole would be passed without finding a drop of water. At last\r\na hole of mud would be found, below that a hole with a little muddy\r\nwater, and a mile farther on the leader would arrive at a shallow pool\r\nunder the edge of a \"cut bank,\" a white, snow-like deposit of alkali on\r\nthe sand encircling its margin, and incrusting the blades of grass and\r\nrushed that grew up from the bottom. The damp earth around the pool was\r\ncut up by a thousand hoof-prints, and the water was warm, strongly\r\nimpregnated with alkali, and yellow with animal impurities, but it was\r\n_water_. The nauseous mixture was quickly surrounded by a throng of\r\nthirsty, heated, and eager buffaloes of all ages, to which the oldest\r\nand strongest asserted claims of priority. There was much crowding and\r\nsome fighting, but eventually all were satisfied. After such a long\r\njourney to water, a herd would usually remain by it for some hours,\r\nlying down, resting, and drinking at intervals until completely\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nHaving drunk its fill, the herd would never march directly back to the\r\nchoice feeding grounds it had just left, but instead would leisurely\r\nstroll off at a right angle from the course it came, cropping for awhile\r\nthe rich bunch grasses of the bottom-lands, and then wander across the\r\nhills in an almost aimless search for fresh fields and pastures new.\r\nWhen buffaloes remained long in a certain locality it was a common thing\r\nfor them to visit the same watering-place a number of times, at\r\nintervals of greater or less duration, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen undisturbed on his chosen range, the bison used to be fond of lying\r\ndown for an hour or two in the middle of the day, particularly when fine\r\nweather and good grass combined to encourage him in luxurious habits. I\r\nonce discovered with the field glass a small herd of buffaloes lying\r\ndown at midday on the slope of a high ridge, and having ridden hard for\r\nseveral hours we seized the opportunity to unsaddle and give our horses\r\nan hour's rest before making the attack. While we were so doing, the\r\nherd got up, shifted its position to the opposite side of the ridge, and\r\nagain laid down, every buffalo with his nose pointing to windward.\r\n\r\nOld hunters declare that in the days of their abundance, when feeding on\r\ntheir ranges in fancied security, the younger animals were as playful as\r\nwell-fed domestic calves. It was a common thing to see them cavort and\r\nfrisk around with about as much grace as young elephants, prancing and\r\nrunning to and fro with tails held high in air \"like scorpions.\"\r\n\r\nBuffaloes are very fond of rolling in dry dirt or even in mud, and this\r\nhabit is quite strong in captive animals. Not only is it indulged in\r\nduring the shedding season, but all through the fall and winter. The two\r\nlive buffaloes in the National Museum are so much given to rolling, even\r\nin rainy weather, that it is necessary to card them every few days to\r\nkeep them presentable.\r\n\r\nBulls are much more given to rolling than the cows, especially after\r\nthey have reached maturity. They stretch out at full length, rub their\r\nheads violently to and fro on the ground, in which the horn serves as\r\nthe chief point of contact and slides over the ground like a\r\nsled-runner. After thoroughly scratching one side on mother earth they\r\nroll over and treat the other in like manner. Notwithstanding his sharp\r\nand lofty hump, a buffalo bull can roll completely over with as much\r\nease as any horse.\r\n\r\nThe vast amount of rolling and side-scratching on the earth indulged in\r\nby bull buffaloes is shown in the worn condition of the horns of every\r\nold specimen. Often a thickness of half an inch is gone from the upper\r\nhalf of each horn on its outside curve, at which point the horn is worn\r\nquite flat. This is well illustrated in the horns shown in the\r\naccompanying plate, fig. 6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEVELOPMENT OF THE HORNS OF THE AMERICAN BISON.\r\n\r\n1. The Calf. 2. The Yearling. 3. Spike Bull, 2 years old.\r\n4. Spike Bull, 3 years old. 5. Bull, 4 years old.\r\n6. Bull, 11 years old. 7. Old \"stub-horn\" Bull, 20 years old.]\r\n\r\nMr. Catlin[36] affords some very interesting and valuable information in\r\nregard to the bison's propensity for wollowing in mad, and also the\r\norigin of the \"fairy circles,\" which have caused so much speculation\r\namongst travelers:\r\n\r\n[Note 36: North American Indians, vol. I, p. 249, 250.]\r\n\r\n\"In the heat of summer, these huge animals, which no doubt suffer very\r\nmuch with the great profusion of their long and shaggy hair, or fur,\r\noften graze on the low grounds of the prairies, where there is a little\r\nstagnant water lying amongst the grass, and the ground underneath being\r\nsaturated with it, is soft, into which the enormous bull, lowered down\r\nupon one knee, will plunge his horns, and at last his head, driving up\r\nthe earth, and soon making an excavation in the ground into which the\r\nwater filters from amongst the grass, forming for him in a few moments a\r\ncool and comfortable bath, into which he plunges like a hog in his mire.\r\n\r\n\"In this delectable laver he throws himself flat upon his side, and\r\nforcing himself violently around, with his horns and his huge hump on\r\nhis shoulders presented to the sides, he ploughs up the ground by his\r\nrotary motion, sinking himself deeper and deeper in the ground,\r\ncontinually enlarging his pool, in which he at length becomes nearly\r\nimmersed, and the water and mud about him mixed into a complete mortar,\r\nwhich changes his color and drips in streams from every part of him as\r\nhe rises up upon his feet, a hideous monster of mud and ugliness, too\r\nfrightful and too eccentric to be described!\r\n\r\n\"It is generally the leader of the herd that takes upon him to make this\r\nexcavation, and if not (but another one opens the ground), the leader\r\n(who is conqueror) marches forward, and driving the other from it\r\nplunges himself into it; and, having cooled his sides and changed his\r\ncolor to a walking mass of mud and mortar, he stands in the pool until\r\ninclination induces him to step out and give place to the next in\r\ncommand who stands ready, and another, and another, who advance forward\r\nin their turns to enjoy the luxury of the wallow, until the whole band\r\n(sometimes a hundred or more) will pass through it in turn,[37] each one\r\nthrowing his body around in a similar manner and each one adding a\r\nlittle to the dimensions of the pool, while he carries away in his hair\r\nan equal share of the clay, which dries to a gray or whitish color and\r\ngradually falls off. By this operation, which is done perhaps in the\r\nspace of half an hour, a circular excavation of fifteen or twenty feet\r\nin diameter and two feet in depth is completed and left for the water to\r\nrun into, which soon fills it to the level of the ground.\r\n\r\n[Note 37: In the District of Columbia work-house we have a counterpart\r\nof this in the public bath-tub, wherein forty prisoners were seen by a\r\n_Star_ reporter to bathe one after another in the same water!]\r\n\r\n\"To these sinks, the waters lying on the surface of the prairies are\r\ncontinually draining and in them lodging their vegetable deposits, which\r\nafter a lapse of years fill them up to the surface with a rich soil,\r\nwhich throws up an unusual growth of grass and herbage, forming\r\nconspicuous circles, which arrest the eye of the traveler and are\r\ncalculated to excite his surprise for ages to come.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the last century, when the bison inhabited\r\nKentucky and Pennsylvania, the salt springs of those States were\r\nresorted to by thousands of those animals, who drank of the saline\r\nwaters and licked the impregnated earth. Mr. Thomas Ashe[38] affords us\r\na most interesting account, from the testimony of an eye witness, of the\r\nbehavior of a bison at a salt spring. The description refers to a\r\nlocality in western Pennsylvania, where \"an old man, one of the first\r\nsettlers of this country, built his log house on the immediate borders\r\nof a salt spring. He informed me that for the first several seasons the\r\nbuffaloes paid him their visits with the utmost regularity; they\r\ntraveled in single files, always following each other at equal\r\ndistances, forming droves, on their arrival, of about 300 each.\r\n\r\n[Note 38: Travels in America in 1806. London, 1808.]\r\n\r\n\"The first and second years, so unacquainted were these poor brutes with\r\nthe use of this man's house or with his nature, that in a few hours they\r\n_rubbed_ the house completely down, taking delight in turning the logs\r\noff with their horns, while he had some difficulty to escape from being\r\ntrampled under their feet or crushed to death in his own ruins. At that\r\nperiod he supposed there could not have been less than 2,000 in the\r\nneighborhood of the spring. They sought for no manner of food, but only\r\nbathed and drank three or four times a day and rolled in the earth, or\r\nreposed with their flanks distended in the adjacent shades; and on the\r\nfifth and sixth days separated into distinct droves, bathed, drank, and\r\ndeparted in single files, according to the exact order of their arrival.\r\nThey all rolled successively in the same hole, and each thus carried\r\naway a coat of mud to preserve the moisture on their skin and which,\r\nwhen hardened and baked in the sun, would resist the stings of millions\r\nof insects that otherwise would persecute these peaceful travelers to\r\nmadness or even death.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a fixed habit with the great buffalo herds to move southward from\r\n200 to 400 miles at the approach of winter. Sometimes this movement was\r\naccomplished quietly and without any excitement, but at other times it\r\nwas done with a rush, in which considerable distances would be gone over\r\non the double quick. The advance of a herd was often very much like that\r\nof a big army, in a straggling line, from four to ten animals abreast.\r\nSometimes the herd moved forward in a dense mass, and in consequence\r\noften came to grief in quicksands, alkali bogs, muddy crossings, and on\r\ntreacherous ice. In such places thousands of buffaloes lost their lives,\r\nthrough those in the lead being forced into danger by pressure of the\r\nmass coming behind. In this manner, in the summer of 1867, over two\r\nthousand buffaloes, out of a herd of about four thousand, lost their\r\nlives in the quicksands of the Platte River, near Plum Creek, while\r\nattempting to cross. One winter, a herd of nearly a hundred buffaloes\r\nattempted to cross a lake called Lac-qui-parle, in Minnesota, upon the\r\nice, which gave way, and drowned the entire herd. During the days of the\r\nbuffalo it was a common thing for voyagers on the Missouri River to see\r\nbuffaloes hopelessly mired in the quicksands or mud along the shore,\r\neither dead or dying, and to find their dead bodies floating down the\r\nriver, or lodged on the upper ends of the islands and sand-bars.\r\n\r\nSuch accidents as these: it may be repeated, were due to the great\r\nnumber of animals and the momentum of the moving mass. The forced\r\nmarches of the great herds were like the flight of a routed army, in\r\nwhich helpless individuals were thrust into mortal peril by the\r\nirresistible force of the mass coming behind, which rushes blindly on\r\nafter their leaders. In this way it was possible to decoy a herd toward\r\na precipice and cause it to plunge over en masse, the leaders being\r\nthrust over by their followers, and all the rest following of their own\r\nfree will, like the sheep who cheerfully leaped, one after another,\r\nthrough a hole in the side of a high bridge because their bell-wether\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\nBut it is not to be understood that the movement of a great herd,\r\nbecause it was made on a run, necessarily partook of the nature of a\r\nstampede in which a herd sweeps forward in a body. The most graphic\r\naccount that I ever obtained of facts bearing on this point was\r\nfurnished by Mr. James McNaney, drawn from his experience on the\r\nnorthern buffalo range in 1882. His party reached the range (on Beaver\r\nCreek, about 100 miles south of Glendive) about the middle of November,\r\nand found buffaloes already there; in fact they had begun to arrive from\r\nthe north as early as the middle of October. About the first of December\r\nan immense herd arrived from the north. It reached their vicinity one\r\nnight, about 10 o'clock, in a mass that seemed to spread everywhere. As\r\nthe hunters sat in their tents, loading cartridges and cleaning their\r\nrifles, a low rumble was heard, which gradually increased to \"a\r\nthundering noise,\" and some one exclaimed, \"There! that's a big herd of\r\nbuffalo coming in!\" All ran out immediately, and hallooed and discharged\r\nrifles to keep the buffaloes from running over their tents. Fortunately,\r\nthe horses were picketed some distance away in a grassy coulée, which\r\nthe buffaloes did not enter. The herd came at a jog trot, and moved\r\nquite rapidly. \"In the morning the whole country was black with\r\nbuffalo.\" It was estimated that 10,000 head were in sight. One immense\r\ndetachment went down on to a \"flat\" and laid down. There it remained\r\nquietly, enjoying a long rest, for about ten days. It gradually broke up\r\ninto small bands, which strolled off in various directions looking for\r\nfood, and which the hunters quietly attacked.\r\n\r\nA still more striking event occurred about Christmas time at the same\r\nplace. For a few days the neighborhood of McNaney's camp had been\r\nentirely deserted by buffaloes, not even one remaining. But one morning\r\nabout daybreak a great herd which was traveling south began to pass\r\ntheir camp. A long line of moving forms was seen advancing rapidly from\r\nthe northwest, coming in the direction of the hunters' camp. It\r\ndisappeared in the creek valley for a few moments, and presently the\r\nleaders suddenly came in sight again at the top of \"a rise\" a few\r\nhundred yards away, and came down the intervening slope at full speed,\r\nwithin 50 yards of the two tents. After them came a living stream of\r\nfollowers, all going at a gallop, described by the observer as \"a long\r\nlope,\" from four to ten buffaloes abreast. Sometimes there would be a\r\nbreak in the column of a minute's duration, then more buffaloes would\r\nappear at the brow of the hill, and the column went rushing by as\r\nbefore. The calves ran with their mothers, and the young stock got over\r\nthe ground with much less exertion than the older animals. For about\r\nfour hours, or until past 11 o'clock, did this column of buffaloes\r\ngallop past the camp over a course no wider than a village street. Three\r\nmiles away toward the south the long dark line of bobbing humps and\r\nhind quarters wound to the right between two hills and disappeared. True\r\nto their instincts, the hunters promptly brought out their rifles, and\r\nbegan to fire at the buffaloes as they ran. A furious fusilade was kept\r\nup from the very doors of the tents, and from first to last over fifty\r\nbuffaloes were killed. Some fell headlong the instant they were hit, but\r\nthe greater number ran on until their mortal wounds compelled them to\r\nhalt, draw off a little way to one side, and finally fall in their death\r\nstruggles.\r\n\r\nMr. McNaney stated that the hunters estimated the number of buffaloes\r\n_on that portion_ of the range that winter (1881-'82) at 100,000.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, and in fact reasonably certain, that such forced-march\r\nmigrations as the above were due to snow-covered pastures and a scarcity\r\nof food on the more northern ranges. Having learned that a journey south\r\nwill bring him to regions of less snow and more grass, it is but natural\r\nthat so lusty a traveler should migrate. The herds or bands which\r\nstarted south in the fall months traveled more leisurely, with frequent\r\nhalts to graze on rich pastures. The advance was on a very different\r\nplan, taking place in straggling lines and small groups dispersed over\r\nquite a scope of country.\r\n\r\nUnless closely pursued, the buffalo never chose to make a journey of\r\nseveral miles through hilly country on a continuous run. Even when\r\nfleeing from the attack of a hunter, I have often had occasion to notice\r\nthat, if the hunter was a mile behind, the buffalo would always walk\r\nwhen going uphill; but as soon as the crest was gained he would begin to\r\nrun, and go down the slope either at a gallop or a swift trot. In former\r\ntimes, when the buffalo's world was wide, when retreating from an attack\r\nhe always ran against the wind, to avoid running upon a new danger,\r\nwhich showed that he depended more upon his sense of smell than his\r\neye-sight. During the last years of his existence, however, this habit\r\nalmost totally disappeared, and the harried survivors learned to run for\r\nthe regions which offered the greatest safety. But even to-day, if a\r\nTexas hunter should go into the Staked Plains, and descry in the\r\ndistance a body of animals running against the wind, he would, without a\r\nmoment's hesitation, pronounce them buffaloes, and the chances are that\r\nhe would be right.\r\n\r\nIn winter the buffalo used to face the storms, instead of turning tail\r\nand \"drifting\" before them helplessly, as domestic cattle do. But at the\r\nsame time, when beset by a blizzard, he would wisely seek shelter from\r\nit in some narrow and deep valley or system of ravines. There the herd\r\nwould lie down and wait patiently for the storm to cease. After a heavy\r\nfall of snow, the place to find the buffalo was in the flats and creek\r\nbottoms, where the tall, rank bunch-grasses showed their tops above the\r\nsnow, and afforded the best and almost the only food obtainable.\r\n\r\nWhen the snow-fall was unusually heavy, and lay for a long time on the\r\nground, the buffalo was forced to fast for days together, and sometimes\r\neven weeks. If a warm day came, and thawed the upper surface of the snow\r\nsufficiently for succeeding cold to freeze it into a crust, the outlook\r\nfor the bison began to be serious. A man can travel over a crust through\r\nwhich the hoofs of a ponderous bison cut like chisels and leave him\r\nfloundering belly-deep. It was at such times that the Indians hunted him\r\non snow-shoes, and drove their spears into his vitals as he wallowed\r\nhelplessly in the drifts. Then the wolves grew fat upon the victims\r\nwhich they, also, slaughtered almost without effort.\r\n\r\nAlthough buffaloes did not often actually perish from hunger and cold\r\nduring the severest winters (save in a few very exceptional cases), they\r\noften came out in very poor condition. The old bulls always suffered\r\nmore severely than the rest, and at the end of winter were frequently in\r\nmiserable plight.\r\n\r\nUnlike most other terrestrial quadrupeds of America, so long as he could\r\nroam at will the buffalo had settled migratory habits.[39] While the elk\r\nand black-tail deer change their altitude twice a year, in conformity\r\nwith the approach and disappearance of winter, the buffalo makes a\r\nradical change of latitude. This was most noticeable in the great\r\nwestern pasture region, where the herds were most numerous and their\r\nmovements most easily observed.\r\n\r\n[Note 39: On page 248 of his \"North American Indians,\" vol. I, Mr.\r\nCatlin declares pointedly that \"these animals are, truly speaking,\r\ngregarious, but not migratory; they graze in immense and almost\r\nincredible numbers at times, and roam about and over vast tracts of\r\ncountry from east to west and from west to east as often as from north\r\nto south, which has often been supposed they naturally and habitually\r\ndid to accommodate themselves to the temperature of the climate in the\r\ndifferent latitudes.\" Had Mr. Catlin resided continuously in any one\r\nlocality on the great buffalo range, he would have found that the\r\nbuffalo had decided migratory habits. The abundance of proof on this\r\npoint renders it unnecessary to eater fully into the details of the\r\nsubject.]\r\n\r\nAt the approach of winter the whole great system of herds which ranged\r\nfrom the Peace River to the Indian Territory moved south a few hundred\r\nmiles, and wintered under more favorable circumstances than each band\r\nwould have experienced at its farthest north. Thus it happened that\r\nnearly the whole of the great range south of the Saskatchewan was\r\noccupied by buffaloes even in winter.\r\n\r\nThe movement north began with the return of mild weather in the early\r\nspring. Undoubtedly this northward migration was to escape the heat of\r\ntheir southern winter range rather than to find better pasture; for as a\r\ngrazing country for cattle all the year round, Texas is hardly\r\nsurpassed, except where it is overstocked. It was with the buffaloes a\r\nmatter of choice rather than necessity which sent them on their annual\r\npilgrimage northward.\r\n\r\nCol. R. I. Dodge, who has made many valuable observations on the\r\nmigratory habits of the southern buffaloes, has recorded the\r\nfollowing:[40]\r\n\r\n\"Early in spring, as soon as the dry and apparently desert prairie had\r\nbegun to change its coat of dingy brown to one of palest green, the\r\nhorizon would begin to be dotted with buffalo, single or in groups of\r\ntwo or three, forerunners of the coming herd. Thicker and thicker and in\r\nlarger groups they come, until by the time the grass is well up the\r\nwhole vast landscape appears a mass of buffalo, some individuals\r\nfeeding, others standing, others lying down, but the herd moving slowly,\r\nmoving constantly to the northward. * * * Some years, as in 1871, the\r\nbuffalo appeared to move northward in one immense column oftentimes from\r\n20 to 50 miles in width, and of unknown depth from front to rear. Other\r\nyears the northward journey was made in several parallel columns, moving\r\nat the same rate, and with their numerous flankers covering a width of a\r\nhundred or more miles.\r\n\r\n\"The line of march of this great spring migration was not always the\r\nsame, though it was confined within certain limits. I am informed by old\r\nfrontiersmen that it has not within twenty-five years crossed the\r\nArkansas River east of Great Bend nor west of Big Sand Creek. The most\r\nfavored routes crossed the Arkansas at the mouth of Walnut Creek, Pawnee\r\nFork, Mulberry Creek, the Cimarron Crossing, and Big Sand Creek.\r\n\r\n\"As the great herd proceeds northward it is constantly depleted, numbers\r\nwandering off to the right and left, until finally it is scattered in\r\nsmall herds far and wide over the vast feeding grounds, where they pass\r\nthe summer.\r\n\r\n\"When the food in one locality fails they go to another, and towards\r\nfall, when the grass of the high prairie becomes parched by the heat and\r\ndrought, they gradually work their way back to the south, concentrating\r\non the rich pastures of Texas and the Indian Territory, whence, the same\r\ninstinct acting on all, they are ready to start together on the\r\nnorthward march as soon as spring starts the grass.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 40: Our Wild Indians, p. 283, _et seq._]\r\n\r\nSo long as the bison held undisputed possession of the great plains his\r\nmigratory habits were as above--regular, general, and on a scale that\r\nwas truly grand. The herds that wintered in Texas, the Indian Territory,\r\nand New Mexico probably spent their summers in Nebraska, southwestern\r\nDakota, and Wyoming. The winter herds of northern Colorado, Wyoming,\r\nNebraska, and southern Dakota went to northern Dakota and Montana, while\r\nthe great Montana herds spent the summer on the Grand Coteau des\r\nPrairies lying between the Saskatchewan and the Missouri. The two great\r\nannual expeditions of the Red River half-breeds, which always took place\r\nin summer, went in two directions from Winnipeg and Pembina--one, the\r\nWhite Horse Plain division, going westward along the Qu'Appelle to the\r\nSaskatchewan country, and the other, the Red River division, southwest\r\ninto Dakota. In 1840 the site of the present city of Jamestown, Dakota,\r\nwas the northeastern limit of the herds that summered in Dakota, and the\r\ncountry lying between that point and the Missouri was for years the\r\nfavorite hunting ground of the Red River division.\r\n\r\nThe herds which wintered on the Montana ranges always went north in the\r\nearly spring, usually in March, so that during the time the hunters were\r\nhauling in the hides taken on the winter hunt the ranges were entirely\r\ndeserted. It is equally certain, however, that a few small bauds\r\nremained in certain portions of Montana throughout the summer. But the\r\nmain body crossed the international boundary, and spent the summer on\r\nthe plains of the Saskatchewan, where they were hunted by the\r\nhalf-breeds from the Red River settlements and the Indians of the\r\nplains. It is my belief that in this movement nearly all the buffaloes\r\nof Montana and Dakota participated, and that the herds which spent the\r\nsummer in Dakota, where they were annually hunted by the Red River\r\nhalf-breeds, came up from Kansas, Colorado, and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the calves were born on the summer ranges, many were\r\nbrought forth en route. It was the habit of the cows to retire to a\r\nsecluded spot, if possible a ravine well screened from observation,\r\nbring forth their young, and nourish and defend them until they were\r\nstrong enough to join the herd. Calves were born all the time from March\r\nto July, and sometimes even as late as August. On the summer ranges it\r\nwas the habit of the cows to leave the bulls at calving time, and thus\r\nit often happened that small herds were often seen composed of bulls\r\nonly. Usually the cow produced but one calf, but twins were not\r\nuncommon. Of course many calves were brought forth in the herd, but the\r\nfavorite habit of the cow was as stated. As soon as the young calves\r\nwere brought into the herd, which for prudential reasons occurred at the\r\nearliest possible moment, the bulls assumed the duty of protecting them\r\nfrom the wolves which at all times congregated in the vicinity of a\r\nherd, watching for an opportunity to seize a calf or a wounded buffalo\r\nwhich might be left behind. A calf always follows its mother until its\r\nsuccessor is appointed and installed, unless separated from her by force\r\nof circumstances. They suck until they are nine months old, or even\r\nolder, and Mr. McNaney once saw a lusty calf suck its mother (in\r\nJanuary) on the Montana range several hours after she had been killed\r\nfor her skin.\r\n\r\nWhen a buffalo is wounded it leaves the herd immediately and goes off as\r\nfar from the line of pursuit as it can get, to escape the rabble of\r\nhunters, who are sure to follow the main body. If any deep ravines are\r\nat hand the wounded animal limps away to the bottom of the deepest and\r\nmost secluded one, and gradually works his way up to its very head,\r\nwhere he finds himself in a perfect cul-de-sac, barely wide enough to\r\nadmit him. Here he is so completely hidden by the high walls and\r\nnumerous bends that his pursuer must needs come within a few feet of his\r\nhorns before his huge bulk is visible. I have more than once been\r\nastonished at the real impregnability of the retreats selected by\r\nwounded bison. In following up wounded bulls in ravine headings it\r\nalways became too dangerous to make the last stage of the pursuit on\r\nhorseback, for fear of being caught in a passage so narrow as to insure\r\na fatal accident to man or horse in case of a sudden discovery of the\r\nquarry. I have seen wounded bison shelter in situations where a single\r\nbull could easily defend himself from a whole pack of wolves, being\r\ncompletely walled in on both sides and the rear, and leaving his foes no\r\npoint of attack save his head and horns.\r\n\r\nBison which were nursing serious wounds most often have gone many days\r\nat a time without either food or water, and in this connection it may be\r\nmentioned that the recuperative power of a bison is really wonderful.\r\nJudging from the number of old leg wounds, fully healed, which I have\r\nfound in freshly killed bisons, one may be tempted to believe that a\r\nbison never died of a broken leg. One large bull which I skeletonized\r\nhad had his humerus shot squarely in two, but it had united again more\r\nfirmly than ever. Another large bull had the head of his left femur and\r\nthe hip socket shattered completely to pieces by a big ball, but he had\r\nentirely recovered from it, and was as lusty a runner as any bull we\r\nchased. We found that while a broken leg was a misfortune to a buffalo,\r\nit always took something more serious than that to stop him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE FOOD OF THE BISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obviously impossible to enumerate all the grasses which served the\r\nbison as food on his native heath without presenting a complete list of\r\nall the plants of that order found in a given region; but it is at least\r\ndesirable to know which of the grasses of the great pasture region were\r\nhis favorite and most common food. It was the nutritious character and\r\nmarvelous abundance of his food supply which enabled the bison to exist\r\nin such absolutely countless numbers as characterized his occupancy of\r\nthe great plains. The following list comprises the grasses which were\r\nthe bison's principal food, named in the order of their importance:\r\n\r\n_Bouteloua oligostachya_ (buffalo, grama, or mesquite grass).--This\r\nremarkable grass formed the _pièce de résistance_ of the bison's bill\r\nof fare in the days when he flourished, and it now comes to us daily in\r\nthe form of beef produced of primest quality and in greatest quantity on\r\nwhat was until recently the great buffalo range. This grass is the most\r\nabundant and widely distributed species to be found in the great pasture\r\nregion between the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and the\r\nnineteenth degree of west longitude. It is the principal grass of the\r\nplains from Texas to the British Possessions, and even in the latter\r\nterritory it is quite conspicuous. To any one but a botanist its first\r\nacquaintance means a surprise. Its name and fame lead the unacquainted\r\nto expect a grass which is tall, rank, and full of \"fodder,\" like the\r\n\"blue joint\" (_Andropogon provincialis_). The grama grass is very short,\r\nthe leaves being usually not more than 2 or 3 inches in length and\r\ncrowded together at the base of the stems. The flower stalk is about a\r\nfoot in height, but on grazed lands are eaten off and but seldom seen.\r\nThe leaves are narrow and inclined to curl, and lie close to the ground.\r\nInstead of developing a continuous growth, this grass grows in small,\r\nirregular patches, usually about the size of a man's hand, with narrow\r\nstrips of perfectly bare ground between them. The grass curls closely\r\nupon the ground, in a woolly carpet or cushion, greatly resembling a\r\nlayer of Florida moss. Even in spring-time it never shows more color\r\nthan a tint of palest green, and the landscape which is dependent upon\r\nthis grass for color is never more than \"a gray and melancholy waste.\"\r\nUnlike the soft, juicy, and succulent grasses of the well-watered\r\nportions of the United States, the tiny leaves of the grama grass are\r\nhard, stiff, and dry. I have often noticed that in grazing neither\r\ncattle nor horses are able to bite off the blades, but instead each leaf\r\nis pulled out of the tuft, seemingly by its root.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its dry and uninviting appearance, this grass is highly\r\nnutritious, and its fat-producing qualities are unexcelled. The heat of\r\nsummer dries it up effectually without destroying its nutritive\r\nelements, and it becomes for the remainder of the year excellent hay,\r\ncured on its own roots. It affords good grazing all the year round, save\r\nin winter, when it is covered with snow, and even then, if the snow is\r\nnot too deep, the buffaloes, cattle, and horses paw down through it to\r\nreach the grass, or else repair to wind-swept ridges and hill-tops,\r\nwhere the snow has been blown off and left the grass partly exposed.\r\nStock prefer it to all the other grasses of the plains.\r\n\r\nOn bottom-lands, where moisture is abundant, this grass develops much\r\nmore luxuriantly, growing in a close mass, and often to a height of a\r\nfoot or more, if not grazed down, when it is cut for hay, and sometimes\r\nyields 11/2 tons to the acre. In Montana and the north it is generally\r\nknown as \"buffalo-grass,\" a name to which it would seem to be fully\r\nentitled, notwithstanding the fact that this name is also applied, and\r\nquite generally, to another species, the next to be noticed.\r\n\r\n_Buchloë dactyloides_ (Southern buffalo-grass).--This species is next\r\nin value and extent of distribution to the grama grass. It also is found\r\nall over the great plains south of Nebraska and southern Wyoming, but\r\nnot further north, although in many localities it occurs so sparsely as\r\nto be of little account. A single bunch of it very greatly resembles\r\n_Bouteloua oligostachya_, but its general growth is very different. It\r\nis very short, its general mass seldom rising more than 3 inches above\r\nthe ground. It grows in extensive patches, and spreads by means of\r\nstolons, which sometimes are 2 feet in length, with joints every 3 or 4\r\ninches. Owing to its southern distribution this might well be named the\r\nSouthern buffalo grass, to distinguish it from the two other species of\r\nhigher latitudes, to which the name \"buffalo\" has been fastened forever.\r\n\r\n_Stipa spartea_ (Northern buffalo-grass; wild oat).--This grass is found\r\nin southern Manitoba, westwardly across the plains to the Rocky\r\nMountains, and southward as far as Montana, where it is common in many\r\nlocalities. On what was once the buffalo range of the British\r\nPossessions this rank grass formed the bulk of the winter pasturage, and\r\nin that region is quite as famous as our grama grass. An allied species\r\n(_Stipa viridula_, bunch-grass) is \"widely diffused over our Rocky\r\nMountain region, extending to California and British America, and\r\nfurnishing a considerable part of the wild forage of the region\" _Stipa\r\nspartea_ bears an ill name among stockmen on account of the fact that at\r\nthe base of each seed is a very hard and sharp-pointed callus, which\r\nunder certain circumstances (so it is said) lodges in the cheeks of\r\ndomestic animals that feed upon this grass when it is dry, and which\r\ncause much trouble. But the buffalo, like the wild horse and half-wild\r\nrange cattle, evidently escaped this annoyance. This grass is one of the\r\ncommon species over a wide area of the northern plains, and is always\r\nfound on soil which is comparatively dry. In Dakota, Minnesota, and\r\nnorthwest Iowa it forms a considerable portion of the upland prairie\r\nhay.\r\n\r\nOf the remaining grasses it is practically impossible to single out any\r\none as being specially entitled to fourth place in this list. There are\r\nseveral species which flourish in different localities, and in many\r\nrespects appear to be of about equal importance as food for stock. Of\r\nthese the following are the most noteworthy:\r\n\r\n_Aristida purpurea_ (Western beard-grass; purple \"bunch-grass\" of\r\nMontana).--On the high, rolling prairies of the Missouri-Yellowstone\r\ndivide this grass is very abundant. It grows in little solitary bunches,\r\nabout 6 inches high, scattered through the curly buffalo-grass\r\n(_Bouteloua oligostachya_). Under more favorable conditions it grows to\r\na height of 12 to 18 inches. It is one of the prettiest grasses of that\r\nregion, and in the fall and winter its purplish color makes it quite\r\nnoticeable. The Montana stockmen consider it one of the most valuable\r\ngrasses of that region for stock of all kinds. Mr. C. M. Jacobs assured\r\nme that the buffalo used to be very fond of this grass, and that\r\n\"wherever this grass grew in abundance there were the best\r\nhunting-grounds for the bison.\" It appears that _Aristida purpurea_ is\r\nnot sufficiently abundant elsewhere in the Northwest to make it an\r\nimportant food for stock; but Dr. Vesey declares that it is \"abundant on\r\nthe plains of Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas.\"\r\n\r\n_Koeleria cristata._--Very generally distributed from Texas and New\r\nMexico to the British Possessions; sand hills and arid soils; mountains,\r\nup to 8,000 feet.\r\n\r\n_Poa tenuifolia_ (blue-grass of the plains and mountains).--A valuable\r\n\"bunch-grass,\" widely distributed throughout the great pasture region;\r\ngrows in all sorts of soils and situations; common in the Yellowstone\r\nPark.\r\n\r\n_Festuca scabrella_ (bunch-grass).--One of the most valuable grasses of\r\nMontana and the Northwest generally; often called the \"great\r\nbunch-grass.\" It furnishes excellent food for horses and cattle, and is\r\nso tall it is cut in large quantities for hay. This is the prevailing\r\nspecies on the foot-hills and mountains generally, up to an altitude of\r\n7,000 feet, where it is succeeded by _Festuca ovina_.\r\n\r\n_Andropogon provincialis_ (blue stem).--An important species, extending\r\nfrom eastern Kansas and Nebraska to the foot-hills of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and from Northern Texas to the Saskatchewan; common in\r\nMontana on alkali flats and bottom lands generally. This and the\r\npreceding species were of great value to the buffalo in winter, when the\r\nshorter grasses were covered with snow.\r\n\r\n_Andropogon scoparius_ (bunch grass; broom sedge; wood-grass).--Similar\r\nto the preceding in distribution and value, but not nearly so tall.\r\n\r\nNone of the buffalo grasses are found in the mountains. In the mountain\r\nregions which have been visited by the buffalo and in the Yellowstone\r\nPark, where to-day the only herd remaining in a state of nature is to be\r\nfound (though not by the man with a gun), the following are the grasses\r\nwhich form all but a small proportion of the ruminant food: _Koeleria\r\ncristata_; _Poa tenuifolia_ (Western blue-grass); _Stipa viridula_\r\n(feather-grass); _Stipa comata_; _Agropyrum divergens_; _Agropyrum\r\ncaninum_.\r\n\r\nWhen pressed by hunger, the buffalo used to browse on certain species of\r\nsage-brush, particularly _Atriplex canescens_ of the Southwest. But he\r\nwas discriminating in the matter of diet, and as far as can be\r\nascertained he was never known to eat the famous and much-dreaded \"loco\"\r\nweed (_Astragalus molissimus_), which to ruminant animals is a veritable\r\ndrug of madness. Domestic cattle and horses often eat this plant; where\r\nit is abundant, and become demented in consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. MENTAL CAPACITY AND DISPOSITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) _Reasoning from cause to effect._--The buffalo of the past was an\r\nanimal of a rather low order of intelligence, and his dullness of\r\nintellect was one of the important factors in his phenomenally swift\r\nextermination. He was provokingly slow in comprehending the existence\r\nand nature of the dangers that threatened his life, and, like the stupid\r\nbrute that he was, would very often stand quietly and see two or three\r\nscore, or even a hundred, of his relatives and companions shot down\r\nbefore his eyes, with no other feeling than one of stupid wonder and\r\ncuriosity. Neither the noise nor smoke of the still-hunter's rifle, the\r\nfalling, struggling, nor the final death of his companions conveyed to\r\nhis mind the idea of a danger to be fled from, and so the herd stood\r\nstill and allowed the still-hunter to slaughter its members at will.\r\n\r\nLike the Indian, and many white men also, the buffalo seemed to feel\r\nthat their number was so great it could never be sensibly diminished.\r\nThe presence of such a great multitude gave to each of its individuals a\r\nfeeling of security and mutual support that is very generally found in\r\nanimals who congregate in great herds. The time was when a band of elk\r\nwould stand stupidly and wait for its members to be shot down one after\r\nanother; but it is believed that this was due more to panic than to a\r\nlack of comprehension of danger.\r\n\r\nThe fur seals who cover the \"hauling grounds\" of St. Paul and St. George\r\nIslands, Alaska, in countless thousands, have even less sense of danger\r\nand less comprehension of the slaughter of thousands of their kind,\r\nwhich takes place daily, than had the bison. They allow themselves to be\r\nherded and driven off landwards from the hauling-ground for half a mile\r\nto the killing-ground, and, finally, with most cheerful indifference,\r\npermit the Aleuts to club their brains out.\r\n\r\nIt is to be added that whenever and wherever seals or sea-lions inhabit\r\na given spot, with but few exceptions, it is an easy matter to approach\r\nindividuals of the herd. The presence of an immense number of\r\nindividuals plainly begets a feeling of security and mutual support. And\r\nlet not the bison or the seal be blamed for this, for man himself\r\nexhibits the same foolish instinct. Who has not met the woman of mature\r\nyears and full intellectual vigor who is mortally afraid to spend a\r\nnight entirely alone in her own house, but is perfectly willing to do\r\nso, and often does do so without fear, when she can have the company of\r\none small and helpless child, or, what is still worse, three or four of\r\nthem! But with the approach of extermination, and the utter breaking up\r\nof all the herds, a complete change has been wrought in the character of\r\nthe bison. At last, but alas! entirely too late, the crack of the rifle\r\nand its accompanying puff of smoke conveyed to the slow mind of the\r\nbison a sense of deadly danger to himself. At last he recognized man,\r\nwhether on foot or horseback, or peering at him from a coulée, as his\r\nmortal enemy. At last he learned to run. In 1886 we found the scattered\r\nremnant of the great northern herd the wildest and most difficult\r\nanimals to kill that we had ever hunted in any country. It had been only\r\nthrough the keenest exercise of all their powers of self-preservation\r\nthat those buffaloes had survived until that late day, and we found\r\nthem almost as swift as antelopes and far more wary. The instant a\r\nbuffalo caught sight of a man, even though a mile distant, he was off at\r\nthe top of his speed, and generally ran for some wild region several\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\nIn our party was an experienced buffalo-hunter, who in three years had\r\nslaughtered over three thousand head for their hides. He declared that\r\nif he could ever catch a \"bunch\" at rest he could \"get a stand\" the same\r\nas he used to do, and kill several head before the rest would run. It so\r\nhappened that the first time we found buffaloes we discovered a bunch of\r\nfourteen head, lying in the sun at noon, on the level top of a low\r\nbutte, all noses pointing up the wind. We stole up within range and\r\nfired. At the instant the first shot rang out up sprang every buffalo as\r\nif he had been thrown upon his feet by steel springs, and in a second's\r\ntime the whole bunch was dashing away from us with the speed of\r\nrace-horses.\r\n\r\nOur buffalo-hunter declared that in chasing buffaloes we could count\r\nwith certainty upon their always running against the wind, for this had\r\nalways been their habit. Although this was once their habit, we soon\r\nfound that those who now represent the survival of the fittest have\r\nlearned better wisdom, and now run (1) away from their pursuer and (2)\r\ntoward the best hiding place. Now they pay no attention whatever to the\r\ndirection of the wind, and if a pursuer follows straight behind, a\r\nbuffalo may change his course three or four times in a 10-mile chase. An\r\nold bull once led one of our hunters around three-quarters of a circle\r\nwhich had a diameter of 5 or 6 miles.\r\n\r\nThe last buffaloes were mentally as capable of taking care of themselves\r\nas any animals I ever hunted. The power of original reasoning which they\r\nmanifested in scattering all over a given tract of rough country, like\r\nhostile Indians when hotly pressed by soldiers, in the Indian-like\r\nmanner in which they hid from sight in deep hollows, and, as we finally\r\nproved, in _grazing only in ravines and hollows_, proved conclusively\r\nthat _but for the use of fire-arms_ those very buffaloes would have been\r\nactually safe from harm by man, and that they would have increased\r\nindefinitely. As they were then, the Indians' arrows and spears could\r\nnever have been brought to bear upon them, save in rare instances, for\r\nthey had thoroughly learned to dread man and fly from him for their\r\nlives. Could those buffaloes have been protected from rifles and\r\nrevolvers the resultant race would have displayed far more active mental\r\npowers, keener vision, and finer physique than the extinguished race\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nIn fleeing from an enemy the buffalo ran against the wind, in order that\r\nhis keen scent might save him from the disaster of running upon new\r\nenemies; which was an idea wholly his own, and not copied by any other\r\nanimal so far as known.\r\n\r\nBut it must be admitted that the buffalo of the past was very often a\r\nmost stupid reasoner. He would deliberately walk into a quicksand,\r\nwhere hundreds of his companions were already ingulfed and in their\r\ndeath-struggle. He would quit feeding, run half a mile, and rush\r\nheadlong into a moving train of cars that happened to come between him\r\nand the main herd on the other side of the track. He allowed himself to\r\nbe impounded and slaughtered by a howling mob in a rudely constructed\r\npen, which a combined effort on the part of three or four old bulls\r\nwould have utterly demolished at any point. A herd of a thousand\r\nbuffaloes would allow an armed hunter to gallop into their midst, very\r\noften within arm's-length, when any of the bulls nearest him might\r\neasily have bowled him over and had him trampled to death in a moment.\r\nThe hunter who would ride in that manner into a herd of the Cape\r\nbuffaloes of Africa (_Bubalus caffer_) would be unhorsed and killed\r\nbefore he had gone half a furlong.\r\n\r\n(2) _Curiosity._--The buffalo of the past possessed but little\r\ncuriosity; he was too dull to entertain many unnecessary thoughts. Had\r\nhe possessed more of this peculiar trait, which is the mark of an\r\ninquiring mind, he would much sooner have accomplished a comprehension\r\nof the dangers that proved his destruction. His stolid indifference to\r\neverything he did not understand cost him his existence, although in\r\nlater years he displayed more interest in his environment. On one\r\noccasion in hunting I staked my success with an old bull I was pursuing\r\non the chance that when he reached the crest of a ridge his curiosity\r\nwould prompt him to pause an instant to look at me. Up to that moment he\r\nhad had only one quick glance at me before he started to run. As he\r\nclimbed the slope ahead of me, in full view, I dismounted and made ready\r\nto fire the instant he should pause to look at me. As I expected, he did\r\ncome to a fall stop on the crest of the ridge, and turned half around to\r\nlook at me. But for his curiosity I should have been obliged to fire at\r\nhim under very serious disadvantages.\r\n\r\n(3) _Fear._--With the buffalo, fear of man is now the ruling passion.\r\nSays Colonel Dodge: \"He is as timid about his flank and rear as a raw\r\nrecruit. When traveling nothing in front stops him, but an unusual\r\nobject in the rear will send him to the right-about [toward the main\r\nbody of the herd] at the top of his speed.\"\r\n\r\n(4) _Courage._--It was very seldom that the buffalo evinced any courage\r\nsave that of despair, which even cowards possess. Unconscious of his\r\nstrength, his only thought was flight, and it was only when brought to\r\nbay that he was ready to fight. Now and then, however, in the chase, the\r\nbuffalo turned upon his pursuer and overthrew horse and rider. Sometimes\r\nthe tables were completely turned, and the hunter found his only safety\r\nin flight. During the buffalo slaughter the butchers sometimes had\r\nnarrow escapes from buffaloes supposed to be dead or mortally wounded,\r\nand a story comes from the great northern range south of Glendive of a\r\nhunter who was killed by an old bull whose tongue he had actually cut\r\nout in the belief that he was dead.\r\n\r\nSometimes buffalo cows display genuine courage in remaining with their\r\ncalves in the presence of danger, although in most cases they left their\r\noffspring to their fate. During a hunt for live buffalo calves,\r\nundertaken by Mr. C. J. Jones of Garden City, Kans., in 1886, and very\r\ngraphically described by a staff correspondent of the American Field in\r\na series of articles in that journal under the title of \"The Last of the\r\nBuffalo,\" the following remarkable incident occurred:[41]\r\n\r\n[Note 41: American Field, July 24, 1886, p. 78.]\r\n\r\n\"The last calf was caught by Carter, who roped it neatly as Mr. Jones\r\ncut it out of the herd and turned it toward him. This was a fine heifer\r\ncalf, and was apparently the idol of her mother's heart, for the latter\r\ncame very near making a casualty the price of the capture. As soon as\r\nthe calf was roped, the old cow left the herd and charged on Carter\r\nviciously, as he bent over his victim. Seeing the danger, Mr. Jones rode\r\nin at just the nick of time, and drove the cow off for a moment; but she\r\nreturned again and again, and finally began charging him whenever he\r\ncame near; so that, much as he regretted it, he had to shoot her with\r\nhis revolver, which he did, killing her almost immediately.\"\r\n\r\nThe mothers of the thirteen other calves that were caught by Mr. Jones's\r\nparty allowed their offspring to be \"cut out,\" lassoed, and tied, while\r\nthey themselves devoted all their energies to leaving them as far behind\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n(5) _Affection._--While the buffalo cows manifested a fair degree of\r\naffection for their young, the adult bulls of the herd often displayed a\r\nsense of responsibility for the safety of the calves that was admirable,\r\nto say the least. Those who have had opportunities for watching large\r\nherds tell us that whenever wolves approached and endeavored to reach a\r\ncalf the old bulls would immediately interpose and drive the enemy away.\r\nIt was a well-defined habit for the bulls to form the outer circle of\r\nevery small group or section of a great herd, with the calves in the\r\ncenter, well guarded from the wolves, which regarded them as their most\r\nchoice prey.\r\n\r\nColonel Dodge records a remarkable incident in illustration of the\r\nmanner in which the bull buffaloes protected the calves of the herd.[42]\r\n\r\n[Note 42: Plains of the Great West, p. 125.]\r\n\r\n\"The duty of protecting the calves devolved almost entirely on the\r\nbulls. I have seen evidences of this many times, but the most remarkable\r\ninstance I have ever heard of was related to me by an army surgeon, who\r\nwas an eye-witness.\r\n\r\n\"He was one evening returning to camp after a day's hunt, when his\r\nattention was attracted by the curious action of a little knot of six or\r\neight buffalo. Approaching sufficiently near to see clearly, he\r\ndiscovered that this little knot were all bulls, standing in a close\r\ncircle, with their heads outwards, while in a concentric circle at some\r\n12 or 15 paces distant sat, licking their chaps in impatient expectancy,\r\nat least a dozen large gray wolves (excepting man, the most dangerous\r\nenemy of the buffalo).\r\n\r\n\"The doctor determined to watch the performance. After a few moments\r\nthe knot broke up, and, still keeping in a compact mass, started on a\r\ntrot for the main herd, some half a mile oft\". To his very great\r\nastonishment, the doctor now saw that the central and controlling figure\r\nof this mass was a poor little calf so newly born as scarcely to be able\r\nto walk. After going 50 or 100 paces the calf laid down, the bulls\r\ndisposed themselves in a circle as before, and the wolves, who had\r\ntrotted along on each side of their retreating supper, sat down and\r\nlicked their chaps again; and though the doctor did not see the finale,\r\nit being late and the camp distant, he had no doubt that the noble\r\nfathers did their whole duty by their offspring, and carried it safely\r\nto the herd.\"\r\n\r\n(6) _Temper._--I have asked many old buffalo hunters for facts in regard\r\nto the temper and disposition of herd buffaloes, and all agree that they\r\nare exceedingly quiet, peace loving, and even indolent animals at all\r\ntimes save during the rutting season. Says Colonel Dodge: \"The habits of\r\nthe buffalo are almost identical with those of the domestic cattle.\r\nOwing either to a more pacific disposition, or to the greater number of\r\nbulls, there, is very little fighting, even at the season when it might\r\nbe expected. I have been among them for days, have watched their conduct\r\nfor hours at a time, and with the very best opportunities for\r\nobservation, but have never seen a regular combat between bulls. They\r\nfrequently strike each other with their horns, but this seems to be a\r\nmere expression of impatience at being crowded.\"\r\n\r\nIn referring to the \"running season\" of the buffalo, Mr. Catlin says:\r\n\"It is no uncommon thing at this season, at these gatherings, to see\r\nseveral thousands in a mass eddying and wheeling about under a cloud of\r\ndust, which is raised by the bulls as they are pawing in the dirt, or\r\nengaged in desperate combats, as they constantly are, plunging and\r\nbutting at each other in a most furious manner.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the disposition of the buffalo is anything but vicious.\r\nBoth sexes yield with surprising readiness to the restraints of\r\ncaptivity, and in a remarkably short time become, if taken young, as\r\nfully domesticated as ordinary cattle. Buffalo calves are as easily\r\ntamed as domestic ones, and make very interesting pets. A prominent\r\ntrait of character in the captive buffalo is a mulish obstinacy or\r\nheadstrong perseverance under certain circumstances that is often very\r\nannoying. When a buffalo makes up his mind to go through a fence, he is\r\nvery apt to go through, either peaceably or by force, as occasion\r\nrequires. Fortunately, however, the captive animals usually accept a\r\nfence in the proper spirit, and treat it with a fair degree of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. VALUE OF THE BUFFALO TO MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may fairly be supposed that if the people of this country could have\r\nbeen made to realize the immense money value of the great buffalo herds\r\nas they existed in 1870, a vigorous and successful effort would have\r\nbeen made to regulate and restrict the slaughter. The fur seal of\r\nAlaska, of which about 100,000 are killed annually for their skins,\r\nyield an annual revenue to the Government of $100,000 and add $900,000\r\nmore to the actual wealth of the United States. It pays to protect those\r\nseals, and we mean to protect them against all comers who seek their\r\nunrestricted slaughter, no matter whether the poachers be American,\r\nEnglish, Russian, or Canadian. It would be folly to do otherwise, and if\r\nthose who would exterminate the fur seal by shooting them in the water\r\nwill not desist for the telling, then they must by the compelling.\r\n\r\nThe fur seal is a good investment for the United States, and their\r\nnumber is not diminishing. As the buffalo herds existed in 1870, 500,000\r\nhead of bulls, young and old, could have been killed every year for a\r\nscore of years without sensibly diminishing the size of the herds. At a\r\nlow estimate these could easily have been made to yield various products\r\nworth $5 each, as follows: Kobe, $2.50; tongue, 20 cents; meat of\r\nhindquarters, $2; bones, horns, and hoofs, 25 cents; total, $5. And the\r\namount annually added to the wealth of the United States would have been\r\n$2,500,000.\r\n\r\nOn all the robes taken for the market, say, 200,000, the Government\r\ncould have collected a tax of 50 cents each, which would have yielded a\r\nsum doubly sufficient to have maintained a force of mounted police fully\r\ncompetent to enforce the laws regulating the slaughter. Had a contract\r\nfor the protection of the buffalo been offered at $50,000 per annum, ay,\r\nor even half that sum, an army of competent men would have competed for\r\nit every year, and it could have been carried out to the letter. But, as\r\nyet, the American people have not learned to spend money for the\r\nprotection of valuable game; and by the time they do learn it, there\r\nwill be no game to protect.\r\n\r\nEven despite the enormous waste of raw material that ensued in the\r\nutilization of the buffalo product, the total cash value of all the\r\nmaterial derived from this source, if it could only be reckoned up,\r\nwould certainly amount to many millions of dollars--perhaps twenty\r\nmillions, all told. This estimate may, to some, seem high, but when we\r\nstop to consider that in eight years, from 1876 to 1884, a single firm,\r\nthat of Messrs. J. & A. Boskowitz, 105 Greene street, New York, paid out\r\nthe enormous sum of $923,070 (nearly one million) for robes and hides,\r\nand that in a single year (1882) another firm, that of Joseph Ullman,\r\n165 Mercer street, New York, paid out $216,250 for robes and hides, it\r\nmay not seem so incredible.\r\n\r\nHad there been a deliberate plan for the suppression of all statistics\r\nrelating to the slaughter of buffalo in the United States, and what it\r\nyielded, the result could not have been more complete barrenness than\r\nexists to-day in regard to this subject. There is only one railway\r\ncompany which kept its books in such a manner as to show the kind and\r\nquantity of its business at that time. Excepting this, nothing is known\r\ndefinitely.\r\n\r\nFortunately, enough facts and figures were recorded during the hunting\r\noperations of the Red River half-breeds to enable us, by bringing them\r\nall together, to calculate with sufficient exactitude the value of the\r\nbuffalo to them from 1820 to 1840. The result ought to be of interest to\r\nall who think it is not worth while to spend money in preserving our\r\ncharacteristic game animals.\r\n\r\nIn Ross's \"Red River Settlement,\" pp. 242-273, and Schoolcraft's \"North\r\nAmerican Indians,\" Part iv, pp. 101-110, are given detailed accounts of\r\nthe conduct and results of two hunting expeditions by the half-breeds,\r\nwith many valuable statistics. On this data we base our calculation.\r\n\r\nTaking the result of one particular day's slaughter as an index to the\r\nmethods of the hunters in utilizing the products of the chase, we find\r\nthat while \"not less than 2,500 animals were killed,\" out of that number\r\nonly 375 bags of pemmican and 240 bales of dried meat were made. \"Now,\"\r\nsays Mr. Ross,\" making all due allowance for waste, 750 animals would\r\nhave been ample for such a result. What, then, we might ask, became of\r\nthe remaining 1,750! * * * Scarcely one-third in number of the animals\r\nkilled is turned to account.\"\r\n\r\nA bundle of dried meat weighs 60 to 70 pounds, and a bag of pemmican 100\r\nto 110 pounds. If economically worked up, a whole buffalo cow yields\r\nhalf a bag of pemmican (about 55 pounds) and three-fourths of a bundle\r\nof dried meat (say 45 pounds). The most economical calculate that from\r\neight to ten cows are required to load a single Red River cart. The\r\nproceeds of 1,776 cows once formed 228 bags of pemmican, 1,213 bales of\r\ndried meat, 166 sacks of tallow, each weighing 200 pounds, 556 bladders\r\nof marrow weighing 12 pounds each, and the value of the whole was\r\n$8,160. The total of the above statement is 132,057 pounds of buffalo\r\nproduct for 1,776 cows, or within a fraction of 75 pounds to each cow.\r\nThe bulls and young animals killed were not accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe expedition described by Mr. Ross contained 1,210 carts and 620\r\nhunters, and returned with 1,089,000 pounds of meat, making 900 pounds\r\nfor each cart, and 200 pounds for each individual in the expedition, of\r\nall ages and both sexes. Allowing, as already ascertained, that of the\r\nabove quantity of product every 75 pounds represents one cow saved and\r\ntwo and one third buffaloes wasted, it means that 14,520 buffaloes were\r\nkilled and utilized and 33,250 buffaloes were killed and eaten fresh or\r\nwasted, and 47,770 buffaloes were killed by 620 hunters, or an average\r\nof 77 buffaloes to each hunter. The total number of buffaloes killed for\r\neach cart was 39.\r\n\r\nAllowing, what was actually the case, that every buffalo killed would,\r\nif properly cared for, have yielded meat, fat, and robe worth at least\r\n$5, the total value of the buffaloes slaughtered by that expedition\r\namounted to $258,850, and of which the various products actually\r\nutilized represented a cash value of $72,001 added to the wealth of the\r\nRed River half-breeds.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 there went 540 carts to the buffalo plains; in 1825, 680; in\r\n1830, 820; in 1835, 970; in 1840, 1,210.\r\n\r\nFrom 1820 to 1825 the average for each year was 610; from 1825 to 1830,\r\n750; from 1830 to 1835, 895; from 1835 to 1840, 1,000.\r\n\r\nAccepting the statements of eye-witnesses that for every buffalo killed\r\ntwo and one-third buffaloes are wasted or eaten on the spot, and that\r\nevery loaded cart represented thirty-nine dead buffaloes which were\r\nworth when utilized $5 each, we have the following series of totals:\r\n\r\nFrom 1820 to 1825 five expeditions, of 610 carts each, killed 118,950\r\nbuffaloes, worth $594,750.\r\n\r\nFrom 1825 to 1830 five expeditions, of 750 carts each, killed 146,250\r\nbuffaloes, worth $731,250.\r\n\r\nFrom 1830 to 1835 five expeditions, of 895 carts each, killed 174,525\r\nbuffaloes, worth $872,625.\r\n\r\nFrom 1835 to 1840 five expeditions, of 1,090 carts each, killed 212,550\r\nbuffaloes, worth $1,062,750.\r\n\r\nTotal number of buffaloes killed in twenty years,[43] $652,275; total\r\nvalue of buffaloes killed in twenty years,[43] $3,261,375; total value\r\nof the product utilized[43] and added to the wealth of the settlements,\r\n$978,412.\r\n\r\n[Note 43: By the Red River half-breeds only.]\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo has his seal, which yields nearly everything that he\r\nrequires; the Korak of Siberia depends for his very existence upon his\r\nreindeer; the Ceylon native has the cocoa-nut palm, which leaves him\r\nlittle else to desire, and the North American Indian had the American,\r\nbison. If any animal was ever designed by the hand of nature for the\r\nexpress purpose of supplying, at one stroke, nearly all the wants of an\r\nentire race, surely the buffalo was intended for the Indian.\r\n\r\nAnd right well was this gift of the gods utilized by the children of\r\nnature to whom it came. Up to the time when the United States Government\r\nbegan to support our Western Indians by the payment of annuities and\r\nfurnishing quarterly supplies of food, clothing, blankets, cloth, tents,\r\netc., the buffalo had been the main dependence of more than 50,000\r\nIndians who inhabited the buffalo range and its environs. Of the many\r\ndifferent uses to which the buffalo and his various parts were, put by\r\nthe red man, the following were the principal ones:\r\n\r\nThe body of the buffalo yielded fresh meat, of which thousands of tons\r\nwere consumed; dried meat, prepared in summer for winter use; pemmican\r\n(also prepared in summer), of meat, fat, and berries; tallow, made up\r\ninto large balls or sacks, and kept in store; marrow, preserved in\r\nbladders; and tongues, dried and smoked, and eaten as a delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the buffalo yielded a robe, dressed with the hair on, for\r\nclothing and bedding; a hide, dressed without the hair, which made a\r\nteepee cover, when a number were sewn together; boats, when sewn\r\ntogether in a green state, over a wooden framework. Shields, made from\r\nthe thickest portions, as rawhide; ropes, made up as rawhide; clothing\r\nof many kinds; bags for use in traveling; coffins, or winding sheets for\r\nthe dead, etc.\r\n\r\nOther portions utilized were sinews, which furnished fiber for ropes,\r\nthread, bow-strings, snow-shoe webs, etc.; hair, which was sometimes\r\nmade into belts and ornaments; \"buffalo chips,\" which formed a valuable\r\nand highly-prized fuel; bones, from which many articles of use and\r\nornament were made; horns, which were made into spoons, drinking\r\nvessels, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter the United States Government began to support the buffalo-hunting\r\nIndians with annuities and supplies, the woolen blanket and canvas tent\r\ntook the place of the buffalo robe and the skin-covered teepee, and\r\n\"Government beef\" took the place of buffalo meat. But the slaughter of\r\nbuffaloes went on just the same, and the robes and hides taken were\r\ntraded for useless and often harmful luxuries, such as canned\r\nprovisions, fancy knickknacks, whisky, fire-arms of the most approved\r\npattern, and quantities of fixed ammunition. During the last ten years\r\nof the existence of the herds it is an open question whether the buffalo\r\ndid not do our Indians more harm than good. Amongst the Crows, who were\r\nliberally provided for by the Government, horse racing was a common\r\npastime, and the stakes were usually dressed buffalo robes.[44]\r\n\r\n[Note 44: On one occasion, which is doubtless still remembered with\r\nbitterness by many a Crow of the Custer Agency, my old friend Jim\r\nMcNaney backed his horse Ogalalla against the horses of the whole Crow\r\ntribe. The Crows forthwith formed a pool, which consisted of a huge pile\r\nof buffalo robes, worth about $1,200, and with it backed their best\r\nrace-horse. He was forthwith \"beaten out of sight\" by Ogalalla, and\r\nanother grievance was registered against the whites.]\r\n\r\nThe total disappearance of the buffalo has made no perceptible\r\ndifference in the annual cost of the Indians to the Government. During\r\nthe years when buffaloes were numerous and robes for the purchase of\r\nfire-arms and cartridges were plentiful, Indian wars were frequent, and\r\nalways costly to the Government. The Indians were then quite\r\nindependent, because they could take the war path at any time and live\r\non buffalo indefinitely. Now, the case is very different. The last time\r\nSitting Bull went on the war-path and was driven up into Manitoba, he\r\nhad the doubtful pleasure of living on his ponies and dogs until he\r\nbecame utterly starved out. Since his last escapade, the Sioux have been\r\ncompelled to admit that the game is up and the war-path is open to them\r\nno longer. Should they wish to do otherwise they know that they could\r\nsurvive only by killing cattle, and cattle that are guarded by cowboys\r\nand ranchmen are no man's game. Therefore, while we no longer have to\r\npay for an annual campaign in force against hostile Indians, the total\r\nabsence of the buffalo brings upon the nation the entire support of the\r\nIndian, and the cash outlay each year is as great as ever.\r\n\r\nThe value of the American bison to civilized man can never be\r\ncalculated, nor even fairly estimated. It may with safety be said,\r\nhowever, that it has been probably tenfold greater than most persons\r\nhave ever supposed. It would be a work of years to gather statistics of\r\nthe immense bulk of robes and hides, undoubtedly amounting to millions\r\nin the aggregate; the thousands of tons of meat, and the train-loads of\r\nbones which have been actually utilized by man. Nor can the effect of\r\nthe bison's presence upon the general development of the great West ever\r\nbe calculated. It has sunk into the great sum total of our progress, and\r\nwell nigh lost to sight forever.\r\n\r\nAs a mere suggestion of the immense value of \"the buffalo product\" at\r\nthe time when it had an existence, I have obtained from two of our\r\nleading fur houses in New York City, with branches elsewhere, a detailed\r\nstatement of their business in buffalo robes and hides during the last\r\nfew years of the trade. They not only serve to show the great value of\r\nthe share of the annual crop that passed through their hands, but that\r\nof Messrs. J. & A. Boskowitz is of especial value, because, being\r\ncarefully itemized throughout, it shows the decline and final failure of\r\nthe trade in exact figures. I am under many obligations to both these\r\nfirms for their kindness in furnishing the facts I desired, and\r\nespecially to the Messrs. Boskowitz, who devoted considerable time and\r\nlabor to the careful compilation of the annexed statement of their\r\nbusiness in buffalo skins.\r\n\r\n_Memorandum of buffalo robes and hides bought by Messrs J. & A.\r\nBoskowitz, 101-105 Greene Street, New York, and 202 Lake street,\r\nChicago, from 1876 to 1884._\r\n\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|Year | Buffalo robes.  | Buffalo hides. |\r\n|     |Number.| Cost.   | Number.|Cost.  |\r\n+-----+-------+---------+--------+-------+\r\n|1876 | 31,838|  $39,620|   None.|   ... |\r\n|1877 |  9,353|   35,560|   None.|   ... |\r\n|1878 | 41,268|  150,600|   None.|   ... |\r\n|1879 | 28,613|  110,420|   None.|   ... |\r\n|1880 | 34,901|  176,200|   4,570|$13,140|\r\n|1881 | 23,355|  151,800|  26,601| 89,030|\r\n|1882 |  2,124|   15,600|  15,464| 44,140|\r\n|1883 |  6,690|   29,770|  21,869| 67,190|\r\n|1884 |  None.|      ...|     529|  1,720|\r\n+-----+-------+---------+--------+-------+\r\n|Total|177,142|$709,570 |  69,033|215,220|\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nTotal number of buffalo skins handled in nine years, 246,175; total\r\ncost, $924,790.\r\n\r\nI have also been favored with some very interesting facts and figures\r\nregarding the business done in buffalo skins by the firm of Mr. Joseph\r\nUllman, exporter and importer of furs and robes, of 165-107 Mercer\r\nstreet, New York, and also 353 Jackson street, St. Paul, Minnesota. The\r\nfollowing letter was written me by Mr. Joseph Ullman on November 12,\r\n1887, for which I am greatly indebted:\r\n\r\n\"Inasmuch as you particularly desire the figures for the years 1880-'86,\r\nI have gone through my buffalo robe and hide accounts of those years,\r\nand herewith give you approximate figures, as there are a good many\r\nthings to be considered which make it difficult to give exact figures.\r\n\r\n\"In 1881 we handled about 14,000 hides, average cost about $3.50, and\r\n12,000 robes, average cost about $7.50.\r\n\r\n\"In 1882 we purchased between 35,000 and 40,000 hides, at an average\r\ncost of about $3.50, and about 10,000 robes, at an average cost of about\r\n$8.50.\r\n\r\n\"In 1883 we purchased from 6,000 to 7,000 hides and about 1,500 to 2,000\r\nrobes at a slight advance in price against the year previous.\r\n\r\n\"In 1884 we purchased less than 2,500 hides, and in my opinion these\r\nwere such as were carried over from the previous season in the\r\nNorthwest, and were not fresh-slaughtered skins. The collection of robes\r\nthis season was also comparatively small, and nominally robes carried\r\nover from 1883.\r\n\r\n\"In 1885 the collection of hides amounted to little or nothing.\r\n\r\n\"The aforesaid goods were all purchased direct in the Northwest, that is\r\nto say, principally in Montana, and shipped in care of our branch house\r\nat St. Paul, Minnesota, to Joseph Ullman, Chicago. The robes mentioned\r\nabove were Indian-tanned robes and were mainly disposed of to the\r\njobbing trade both East and West.\r\n\r\n\"In 1881 and the years prior, the hides were divided into two kinds,\r\nviz, robe hides, which were such as had a good crop of fur and were\r\nserviceable for robe purposes, and the heavy and short-furred bull\r\nhides. The former were principally sold to the John S. Way Manufacturing\r\nCompany, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and to numerous small robe tanners,\r\nwhile the latter were sold for leather purposes to various hide-tanners\r\nthroughout the United States and Canada, and brought 51/2 to 81/2 cents per\r\npound. A very large proportion of these latter were tanned by the Wilcox\r\nTanning Company, Wilcox, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\"About the fall of 1882 we established a tannery for buffalo robes in\r\nChicago, and from that time forth we tanned all the good hides which we\r\nreceived into robes and disposed of them in the same manner as the\r\nIndian-tanned robes.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that I am called upon to express an opinion as to the\r\nbenefit or disadvantage of the extermination of the buffalo, but\r\nnevertheless take the liberty to say that I think that some proper law\r\nrestricting the unpardonable slaughter of the buffalo should have been\r\nenacted at the time. It is a well-known fact that soon after the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad opened up that portion of the country, thereby\r\nmaking the transportation of the buffalo hides feasible, that is to say,\r\nreducing the cost of freight, thousands upon thousands of buffaloes were\r\nkilled for the sake of the hide alone, while the carcasses were left to\r\nrot on the open plains.\r\n\r\n\"The average prices paid the buffalo hunters [from 1880 to 1884] was\r\nabout as follows: For cow hides [robes!], $3; bull hides, $2.50;\r\nyearlings, $1.50; calves, 75 cents; and the cost of getting the hides to\r\nmarket brought the cost up to about $3.50 per hide.\"\r\n\r\nThe amount actually paid out by Joseph Ullman, in four years, for\r\nbuffalo robes and hides was about $310,000, and this, too, long after\r\nthe great southern herd had ceased to exist, and when the northern herd\r\nfurnished the sole supply. It thus appears that during the course of\r\neight years business (leaving out the small sum paid out in 1884), on\r\nthe part of the Messrs. Boskowitz, and four years on that of Mr. Joseph\r\nUllman, these two firms alone paid out the enormous sum of $1,233,070\r\nfor buffalo robes and hides which they purchased to sell again at a good\r\nprofit. By the time their share of the buffalo product reached the\r\nconsumers it must have represented an actual money value of about\r\n$2,000,000.\r\n\r\nBesides these two firms there were at that time many others who also\r\nhandled great quantities of buffalo skins and hides for which they paid\r\nout immense sums of money. In this country the other leading firms\r\nengaged in this business were I. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton; P. B.\r\nWeare & Co., Chicago; Obern, Hoosick & Co., Chicago and Saint Paul;\r\nMartin Bates & Co., and Messrs. Shearer, Nichols & Co. (now Hurlburt,\r\nShearer & Sanford), of New York. There were also many others whose names\r\nI am now unable to recall.\r\n\r\nIn the British Possessions and Canada the frontier business was largely\r\nmonopolized by the Hudson's Bay Fur Company, although the annual\r\n\"output\" of robes and hides was but small in comparison with that\r\ngathered in the United States, where the herds were far more numerous.\r\nEven in their most fruitful locality for robes--the country south of the\r\nSaskatchewan--this company had a very powerful competitor in the firm of\r\nI. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton, which secured the lion's share of the\r\nspoil and sent it down the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that the utilization of the buffalo product, even so\r\nfar as it was accomplished, resulted in the addition of several millions\r\nof dollars to the wealth of the people of the United States. That the\r\ntotal sum, could it be reckoned up, would amount to at least fifteen\r\nmillions, seems reasonably certain; and my own impression is that twenty\r\nmillions would be nearer the mark. It is much to be regretted that the\r\nexact truth can never be known, for in this age of universal slaughter a\r\nknowledge of the cash value of the wild game of the United States that\r\nhas been killed up to date might go far toward bringing about the actual\r\nas well as the theoretical protection of what remains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUTILIZATION OF THE BUFFALO BY WHITE MEN.\r\n\r\n_Robes._--Ordinarily the skin of a large ruminant is of little value in\r\ncomparison with the bulk of toothsome flesh it covers. In fattening\r\ndomestic cattle for the market, the value of the hide is so\r\ninsignificant that it amounts to no more than a butcher's perquisite in\r\nreckoning up the value of the animal. With the buffalo, however, so\r\nenormous was the waste of the really available product that probably\r\nnine-tenths of the total value derived from the slaughter of the animal\r\ncame from his skin alone. Of this, about four-fifths came from the\r\nutilization of the furry robe and one-fifth from skins classed as\r\n\"hides,\" which were either taken in the summer season, when the hair was\r\nvery short or almost absent, and used for the manufacture of leather and\r\nleather goods, or else were the poorly-furred skins of old bulls.\r\n\r\nThe season for robe-taking was from October 15 to February 15, and a\r\nlittle later in the more northern latitudes. In the United States the\r\nhair of the buffalo was still rather short up to the first of November;\r\nbut by the middle of November it was about at its finest as to length,\r\ndensity, color, and freshness. The Montana hunters considered that the\r\nfinest robes were those taken from November 15 to December 15. Before\r\nthe former date the hair had not quite attained perfection in length,\r\nand after the latter it began to show wear and lose color. The winter\r\nstorms of December and January began to leave their mark upon the robes\r\nby the 1st of February, chiefly by giving the hair a bleached and\r\nweathered appearance. By the middle of February the pelage was decidedly\r\non the wane, and the robe-hunter was also losing his energy. Often,\r\nhowever, the hunt was kept up until the middle of March, until either\r\nthe deterioration of the quality of the robe, the migration of the herds\r\nnorthward, or the hunter's longing to return \"to town\" and \"clean up,\"\r\nbrought the hunt to an end.\r\n\r\nOn the northern buffalo range, the hunter, or \"buffalo skinner,\" removed\r\nthe robe in the following manner:\r\n\r\nWhen the operator had to do his work alone, which was almost always the\r\ncase, he made haste to skin his victims while they were yet warm, if\r\npossible, and before _rigor mortis_ had set in; but, at all hazards,\r\nbefore they should become hard frozen. With a warm buffalo he could\r\neasily do his work single-handed, but with one rigid or frozen stiff it\r\nwas a very different matter.\r\n\r\nHis first act was to heave the carcass over until it lay fairly upon its\r\nback, with its feet up in the air. To keep it in that position he\r\nwrenched the head violently around to one side, close against the\r\nshoulder, at the point where the hump was highest and the tendency to\r\nroll the greatest, and used it very effectually as a chock to keep the\r\nbody from rolling back upon its side. Having fixed the carcass in\r\nposition he drew forth his steel, sharpened his sharp-pointed\r\n\"ripping-knife,\" and at once proceeded to make all the opening cuts in\r\nthe skin. Each leg was girdled to the bone, about 8 inches above the\r\nhoof, and the skin of the leg ripped open from that point along the\r\ninside to the median line of the body. A long, straight cut was then\r\nmade along the middle of the breast and abdomen, from the root of the\r\ntail to the chin. In skinning cows and young animals, nothing but the\r\nskin of the forehead and nose was left on the skull, the skin of the\r\nthroat and cheeks being left on the hide; but in skinning old bulls, on\r\nwhose heads the skin was very thick and tough, the whole head was left\r\nunskinned, to save labor and time. The skin of the neck was severed in a\r\ncircle around the neck, just behind the ears. It is these huge heads of\r\nbushy brown hair, looking, at a little distance, quite black, in sharp\r\ncontrast with the ghastly whiteness of the perfect skeletons behind\r\nthem, which gives such a weird and ghostly appearance to the lifeless\r\nprairies of Montana where the bone-gatherer has not yet done his perfect\r\nwork. The skulls of the cows and young buffaloes are as clean and bare\r\nas if they had been carefully macerated, and bleached by a skilled\r\nosteologist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. A DEAD BULL. From a photograph by L. A. Huffman.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. BUFFALO SKINNERS AT WORK. From a photograph by\r\nL. A. Huffman.]\r\n\r\nThe opening cuts having been made, the broad-pointed \"skinning-knife\"\r\nwas duly sharpened, and with it the operator fell to work to detach the\r\nskin from the body in the shortest possible time. The tail was always\r\nskinned and left on the hide. As soon as the skin was taken off it was\r\nspread out on a clean, smooth, and level spot of ground, and stretched\r\nto its fullest extent, inside uppermost. On the northern range, very few\r\nskins were \"pegged out,\" _i. e._, stretched thoroughly and held by means\r\nof wooden pegs driven through the edges of the skin into the earth. It\r\nwas practiced to a limited extent on the southern range during the\r\nlatter part of the great slaughter, when buffaloes were scarce and time\r\nabundant. Ordinarily, however, there was no time for pegging, nor were\r\npegs available on the range to do the work with. A warm skin stretched\r\non the curly buffalo-grass, hair side down, sticks to the ground of\r\nitself until it has ample time to harden. On the northern range the\r\nskinner always cut the initials of his outfit in the thin subcutaneous\r\nmuscle which was always found adhering to the skin on each side, and\r\nwhich made a permanent and very plain mark of ownership.\r\n\r\nIn the south, the traders who bought buffalo robes on the range\r\nsometimes rigged up a rude press, with four upright posts and a huge\r\nlever, in which robes that had been folded into a convenient size were\r\npressed into bales, like bales of cotton. These could be transported by\r\nwagon much more economically than could loose robes. An illustration of\r\nthis process is given in an article by Theodore R. Davis, entitled \"The\r\nBuffalo Range,\" in _Harper's Magazine_ for January, 1869, Vol. xxxviii,\r\np. 163. The author describes the process as follows:\r\n\r\n\"As the robes are secured, the trader has them arranged in lots of ten\r\neach, with but little regard for quality other than some care that\r\nparticularly fine robes do not go too many in one lot. These piles are\r\nthen pressed into a compact bale by means of a rudely constructed affair\r\ncomposed of saplings and a chain.\"\r\n\r\nOn the northern range, skins were not folded until the time came to haul\r\nthem in. Then the hunter repaired to the scene of his winter's work,\r\nwith a wagon surmounted by a hay-rack (or something like it), usually\r\ndrawn by four horses. As the skins were gathered up they were folded\r\nonce, lengthwise down the middle, with the hair inside. Sometimes as\r\nmany as 100 skins were hauled at one load by four horses.\r\n\r\nOn one portion of the northern range the classification of buffalo\r\npeltries was substantially as follows: Under the head _of robes_ was\r\nincluded all cow skins taken during the proper season, from one year old\r\nupward, and all bull skins from one to three years old. Bull skins over\r\nthree years of age were classed as _hides_, and while the best of them\r\nwere finally tanned and used as robes, the really poor ones were\r\nconverted into leather. The large robes, when tanned, were used very\r\ngenerally throughout the colder portions of North America as sleigh\r\nrobes and wraps, and for bedding in the regions of extreme cold. The\r\nsmall robes, from the young animals, and likewise many large robes, were\r\nmade into overcoats, at once the warmest and the most cumbersome that\r\never enveloped a human being. Thousands of old bull robes were tanned\r\nwith the hair on, and the body portions were made into overshoes, with\r\nthe woolly hair inside--absurdly large and uncouth, but very warm.\r\n\r\nI never wore a pair of buffalo overshoes without being torn by\r\nconflicting emotions--mortification at the ridiculous size of my\r\ncombined foot-gear, big boots inside of huge overshoes, and supreme\r\ncomfort derived from feet that were always warm.\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary robe, the hunters and fur buyers of Montana\r\nrecognized four special qualities, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe \"beaver robe,\" with exceedingly fine, wavy fur, the color of a\r\nbeaver, and having long, coarse, straight hairs coming through it. The\r\nlatter were of course plucked out in the process of manufacture. These\r\nwere very rare. In 1882 Mr. James McNaney took one, a cow robe, the only\r\none out of 1,200 robes taken that season, and sold it for $75, when\r\nordinary robes fetched only $3.50.\r\n\r\nThe \"black-and-tan robe\" is described as having the nose, flanks, and\r\ninside of fore legs black-and-tan (whatever that may mean), while the\r\nremainder of the robe is jet black.\r\n\r\nA \"buckskin robe\" is from what is always called a \"white buffalo,\" and\r\nis in reality a dirty cream color instead of white. A robe of this\r\ncharacter sold in Miles City in 1882 for $200, and was the only one of\r\nthat character taken on the northern range during that entire winter. A\r\nvery few pure white robes have been taken, so I have been told, chiefly\r\nby Indians, but I have never seen one.\r\n\r\nA \"blue robe\" or \"mouse-colored (?) robe\" is one on which the body color\r\nshows a decidedly bluish cast, and at the same time has long, fine fur.\r\nOut of his 1,200 robes taken in 1882, Mr. McNaney picked out 12 which\r\npassed muster as the much sought for blue robes, and they sold at $16\r\neach.\r\n\r\nAs already intimated, the price paid on the range for ordinary buffalo\r\nskins varied according to circumstances, and at different periods, and\r\nin different localities, ranged all the way from 65 cents to $10. The\r\nlatter figure was paid in Texas in 1887 for the last lot of \"robes\" ever\r\ntaken. The lowest prices ever paid were during the tremendous slaughter\r\nwhich annihilated the southern herd. Even as late as 1876, in the\r\nsouthern country, cow robes brought on the range only from 65 to 90\r\ncents, and bull robes $1.15. On the northern range, from 1881 to 1883,\r\nthe prices paid were much higher, ranging from $2.50 to $4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. FIVE MINUTES' WORK. Photographed by L. A. Huffman.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. SCENE ON THE NORTHERN BUFFALO RANGE. Photographed\r\nby L. A. Huffman.]\r\n\r\nA few hundred dressed robes still remain in the hands of some of the\r\nlargest fur dealers in New York, Chicago, and Montreal, which can be\r\npurchased at prices much lower than one would expect, considering the\r\ncircumstances. In 1888, good robes, Indian tanned, were offered in New\r\nYork at prices ranging from $15 to $30, according to size and quality,\r\nbut in Montreal no first-class robes were obtainable at less than $40.\r\n\r\n_Hides._--Next in importance to robes was the class of skins known\r\ncommercially as hides. Under this head were classed all skins which for\r\nany reason did not possess the pelage necessary to a robe, and were\r\ntherefore fit only for conversion into leather. Of these, the greater\r\nportion consisted of the skins of old bulls on which the hair was of\r\npoor quality and the skin itself too thick and heavy to ever allow of\r\nits being made into a soft, pliable, and light-weight robe. The\r\nremaining portion of the hides marketed were from buffaloes killed in\r\nspring and summer, when the body and hindquarters ware almost naked.\r\nApparently the quantity of summer-killed hides marketed was not very\r\ngreat, for it was only the meanest and most unprincipled ones of the\r\ngrand army of buffalo-killers who were mean enough to kill buffaloes in\r\nsummer simply for their hides. It is said that at one time\r\nsummer-killing was practiced on the southern range to an extent that\r\nbecame a cause for alarm to the great body of more respectable hunters,\r\nand the practice was frowned upon so severely that the wretches who\r\nengaged in it found it wise to abandon it.\r\n\r\n_Bones._--Next in importance to robes and hides was the bone product,\r\nthe utilization of which was rendered possible by the rigorous climate\r\nof the buffalo plains. Under the influence of the wind and sun and the\r\nextremes of heat and cold, the flesh remaining upon a carcass dried up,\r\ndisintegrated, and fell to dust, leaving the bones of almost the entire\r\nskeleton as clean and bare as if they had been stripped of flesh by some\r\npowerful chemical process. Very naturally, no sooner did the live\r\nbuffaloes begin to grow scarce than the miles of bleaching' bones\r\nsuggested the idea of finding a use for them. A market was readily found\r\nfor them in the East, and the prices paid per ton were sufficient to\r\nmake the business of bone-gathering quite remunerative. The bulk of the\r\nbone product was converted into phosphate for fertilizing purposes, but\r\nmuch of it was turned into carbon for use in the refining of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of bones became a common industry as early as 1872, during\r\nwhich year 1,135,300 pounds were shipped over the Atchison, Topeka and\r\nSanta Fé Railroad. In the year following the same road shipped 2,743,100\r\npounds, and in 1874 it handled 6,914,950 pounds more. This trade\r\ncontinued from that time on until the plains have been gleaned so far\r\nback from the railway lines that it is no longer profitable to seek\r\nthem. For that matter, however, it is said that south of the Union\r\nPacific nothing worth the seeking now remains.\r\n\r\nThe building of the Northern Pacific Railway made possible the shipment\r\nof immense quantities of dry bones. Even as late as 1886 overland\r\ntravelers saw at many of the stations between Jamestown, Dakota, and\r\nBillings, Montana, immense heaps of bones lying alongside the track\r\nawaiting shipment. In 1885 a single firm shipped over 200 tons of bones\r\nfrom Miles City.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Missouri River was gleaned by teamsters who gathered\r\nbones from as far back as 100 miles and hauled them to the river for\r\nshipment on the steamers. An operator who had eight wagons in the\r\nbusiness informed me that in order to ship bones on the river steamers\r\nit was necessary to crush them, and that for crushed bones, shipped in\r\nbags, a Michigan fertilizer company paid $18 per ton. Uncrushed bones,\r\nshipped by the railway, sold for $12 per ton.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to ascertain the total amount or value of the bone\r\nproduct, but it is certain that it amounted to many thousand tons, and\r\nin value must have amounted to some hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r\nBut for the great number of railroads, river steamers, and sea-going\r\nvessels (from Texas ports) engaged in carrying this product, it would\r\nhave cut an important figure in the commerce of the country, but owing\r\nto the many interests between which it was divided it attracted little\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n_Meat._--The amount of fresh buffalo meat cured and marketed was really\r\nvery insignificant. So long as it was to be had at all it was so very\r\nabundant that it was worth only from 2 to 3 cents per pound in the\r\nmarket, and many reasons combined to render the trade in fresh buffalo\r\nmeat anything but profitable. Probably not more than one one-thousandth\r\nof the buffalo meat that might have been saved and utilized was saved.\r\nThe buffalo carcasses that were wasted on the great plains every year\r\nduring the two great periods of slaughter (of the northern and southern\r\nherds) would probably have fed to satiety during the entire time more\r\nthan a million persons.\r\n\r\nAs to the quality of buffalo meat, it may be stated in general terms\r\nthat it differs in no way whatever from domestic beef of the same age\r\nproduced by the same kind of grass. Perhaps there is no finer grazing\r\nground in the world than Montana, and the beef it produces is certainly\r\nentitled to rank with the best. There are many persons who claim to\r\nrecognize a difference between the taste of buffalo meat and domestic\r\nbeef; but for my part I do not believe any difference really exists,\r\nunless it is that the flesh of the buffalo is a little sweeter and more\r\njuicy. As for myself, I feel certain I could not tell the difference\r\nbetween the flesh of a three-year old buffalo and that of a domestic\r\nbeef of the same age, nor do I believe any one else could, even on a\r\nwager. Having once seen a butcher eat an elephant steak in the belief\r\nthat it was beef from his own shop, and another butcher eat _loggerhead\r\nturtle_ steak for beef, I have become somewhat skeptical in regard to\r\nthe intelligence of the human palate.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of experiment, during our hunt for buffalo we had buffalo\r\nmeat of all ages, from one year up to eleven, cooked in as many\r\ndifferent ways as our culinary department could turn out. We had it\r\nbroiled, fried with batter, roasted, boiled, and stewed. The last\r\nmethod, when employed upon slices of meat that had been hacked from a\r\nfrozen hind-quarter, produced results that were undeniably tough and not\r\nparticularly good. But it was an unfair way to cook any kind of meat,\r\nand may be guarantied to spoil the finest beef in the world.\r\n\r\nHump meat from a cow buffalo not too old, cut in slices and fried in\r\nbatter, _a la cowboy_, is delicious--a dish fit for the gods. We had\r\ntongues in plenty, but the ordinary meat was so good they were not half\r\nappreciated. Of course the tenderloin was above criticism, and even the\r\nround steaks, so lightly esteemed by the epicure, were tender and juicy\r\nto a most satisfactory degree.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the meat of the buffalo has a coarser texture or\r\n\"grain\" than domestic beef. Although I expected to find such to be the\r\ncase, I found no perceptible difference whatever, nor do I believe that\r\nany exists. As to the distribution of fat I am unable to say, for the\r\nreason that our buffaloes were not fat.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that the distribution of fat through the meat, so\r\ncharacteristic of the shorthorn breeds, and which has been brought about\r\nonly by careful breeding, is not found in either the beef of the buffalo\r\nor common range cattle. In this respect, shorthorn beef no doubt\r\nsurpasses both the others mentioned, but in all other points, texture,\r\nflavor, and general tenderness, I am very sure it does not.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake for a traveler to kill a patriarchal old bull\r\nbuffalo, and after attempting to masticate a small portion of him to\r\nrise up and declare that buffalo meat is coarse, tough, and dry. A\r\ndomestic bull of the same age would taste as tough. It is probably only\r\nthose who have had the bad taste to eat bull-beef who have ever found\r\noccasion to asperse the reputation of _Bison americanus_ as a beef\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nUntil people got tired of them, buffalo tongues were in considerable\r\ndemand, and hundreds, if not even thousands, of barrels of them were\r\nshipped east from the buffalo country.\r\n\r\n_Pemmican._--Out of the enormous waste of good buffalo flesh one product\r\nstands forth as a redeeming feature--pemmican. Although made almost\r\nexclusively by the half-breeds and Indians of the Northwest it\r\nconstituted a regular article of commerce of great value to overland\r\ntravelers, and was much sought for as long as it was produced. Its\r\npeculiar \"staying powers,\" due to the process of its manufacture, which\r\nyielded a most nourishing food in a highly condensed form, made it of\r\ninestimable value to the overland traveler who must travel light or not\r\nat all. A handful of pemmican was sufficient food to constitute a meal\r\nwhen provisions were at all scarce. The price of pemmican in Winnipeg\r\nwas once as low as 2d. per pound, but in 1883 a very small quantity\r\nwhich was brought in sold at 10 cents per pound. This was probably the\r\nlast buffalo pemmican made. H. M. Robinson states that in 1878 pemmican\r\nwas worth 1s. 3d. per pound.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of pemmican, as performed by the Red River half-breeds,\r\nwas thus described by the Rev. Mr. Belcourt, a Catholic priest, who once\r\naccompanied one of the great buffalo-hunting expeditions:[45]\r\n\r\n[Note 45: Schoolcraft's History, Condition and Prospects of the Indian\r\nTribes, iv, p. 107.]\r\n\r\n\"Other portions which are destined to be made into pimikehigan, or\r\npemmican, are exposed to an ardent heat, and thus become brittle and\r\neasily reducible to small particles by the use of a flail, the\r\nbuffalo-hide answering the purpose of a threshing-floor. The fat or\r\ntallow, being cut up and melted in large kettles of sheet iron, is\r\npoured upon this pounded meat, and the whole mass is worked together\r\nwith shovels until it is well amalgamated, when it is pressed, while\r\nstill warm, into bags made of buffalo skin, which are strongly sewed up,\r\nand the mixture gradually cools and becomes almost as hard as a rock. If\r\nthe fat used in this process is that taken from the parts containing the\r\nudder, the meat is called fine pemmican. In some cases, dried fruits,\r\nsuch as the prairie pear and cherry, are intermixed, which forms what is\r\ncalled seed pemmican. Tho lovers of good eating judge the first\r\ndescribed to be very palatable; the second, better; the third,\r\nexcellent. A taurean of pemmican weighs from 100 to 110 pounds. Some\r\nidea may be formed of the immense destruction of buffalo by these people\r\nwhen it is stated that a whole cow yields one-half a bag of pemmican and\r\nthree fourths of a bundle of dried meat; so that the most economical\r\ncalculate that from eight to ten cows are required for the load of a\r\nsingle vehicle.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident from the testimony of disinterested travelers that\r\nordinary pemmican was not very palatable to one unaccustomed to it as a\r\nregular article of food. To the natives, however, especially the\r\nCanadian _voyageur_, it formed one of the most valuable food products of\r\nthe country, and it is said that the demand for it was generally greater\r\nthan the supply.\r\n\r\n_Dried, or \"jerked\" meat._--The most popular and universal method of\r\ncuring buffalo meat was to cut it into thin flakes, an inch or less in\r\nthickness and of indefinite length, and without salting it in the least\r\nto hang it over poles, ropes, wicker-frames, or even clumps of standing\r\nsage brush, and let it dry in the sun. This process yielded the famous\r\n\"jerked\" meat so common throughout the West in the early days, from the\r\nRio Grande to the Saskatchewan. Father Belcourt thus described the\r\ncuring process as it was practiced by the half-breeds and Indians of the\r\nNorthwest:\r\n\r\n\"The meat, when taken to camp, is cut by the women into long strips\r\nabout a quarter of an inch thick, which are hung upon the lattice-work\r\nprepared for that purpose to dry. This lattice-work is formed of small\r\npieces of wood, placed horizontally, transversely, and equidistant from\r\neach other, not unlike an immense gridiron, and is supported by wooden\r\nuprights (trepieds). In a few days the meat is thoroughly desiccated,\r\nwhen it is bent into proper lengths and tied into bundles of 60 or 70\r\npounds weight. This is called dried meat (viande seche). To make the\r\nhide into parchment (so called) it is stretched on a frame, and then\r\nscraped on the inside with a piece of sharpened bone and on the outside\r\nwith a small but sharp-curved iron, proper to remove the hair. This is\r\nconsidered, likewise, the appropriate labor of women. The men break the\r\nbones, which are boiled in water to extract the marrow to be used for\r\nfrying and other culinary purposes. The oil is then poured into the\r\nbladder of the animal, which contains, when filled, about 12 pounds,\r\nbeing the yield of the marrow-bones of two buffaloes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Northwest Territories dried meat, which formerly sold at 2_d._\r\nper pound, was worth in 1878 10_d._ per pound.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have myself prepared quite a quantity of jerked buffalo meat,\r\nI never learned to like it. Owing to the absence of salt in its curing,\r\nthe dried meat when pounded and made into a stew has a \"far away\" taste\r\nwhich continually reminds one of hoofs and horns. For all that, and\r\ndespite its resemblance in flavor to Liebig's Extract of Beef, it is\r\nquite good, and better to the taste than ordinary pemmican.\r\n\r\nThe Indians formerly cured great quantities of buffalo meat in this\r\nway--in summer, of course, for use in winter--but the advent of that\r\npopular institution called \"Government beef\" long ago rendered it\r\nunnecessary for the noble red man to exert his squaw in that once\r\nhonorable field of labor.\r\n\r\nDuring the existence of the buffalo herds a few thrifty and enterprising\r\nwhite men made a business of killing buffaloes in summer and drying the\r\nmeat in bulk, in the same manner which to-day produces our popular\r\n\"dried beef.\" Mr. Allen states that \"a single hunter at Hays City\r\nshipped annually for some years several hundred barrels thus prepared,\r\nwhich the consumers probably bought for ordinary beef.\"\r\n\r\n_Uses of bison's hair._--Numerous attempts have been made to utilize the\r\nwoolly hair of the bison in the manufacture of textile fabrics. As early\r\nas 1729 Col. William Byrd records the fact that garments were made of\r\nthis material, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Hair growing upon his Head and Neck is long and Shagged, and so\r\nSoft that it will spin into Thread not unlike Mohair, and might be wove\r\ninto a sort of Camlet. Some People have Stockings knit of it, that would\r\nhave served an Israelite during his forty Years march thro' the\r\nWilderness.\"[46]\r\n\r\n[Note 46: Westover MSS., i, p. 172.]\r\n\r\nIn 1637 Thomas Morton published, in his \"New English Canaan,\" p. 98,[47]\r\nthe following reference to the Indians who live on the southern shore of\r\nLake Erocoise, supposed to be Lake Ontario:\r\n\r\n[Note 47: Quoted by Professor Allen, \"American Bisons,\" p. 107.]\r\n\r\n\"These Beasts [buffaloes, undoubtedly] are of the bignesse of a Cowe,\r\ntheir flesh being very good foode, their hides good lether, their\r\nfleeces very usefull, being a kind of wolle, as fine as the wolle of the\r\nBeaver, and the Salvages doe make garments thereof.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Allen quotes a number of authorities who have recorded\r\nstatements in regard to the manufacture of belts, garters, scarfs,\r\nsacks, etc., from buffalo wool by various tribes of Indians.[48] He also\r\ncalls attention to the only determined efforts ever made by white men on\r\na liberal scale for the utilization of buffalo \"wool\" and its\r\nmanufacture into cloth, an account of which appears in Ross's \"Red River\r\nSettlement,\" pp. 69-72. In 1821 some of the more enterprising of the Red\r\nRiver (British) colonists conceived the idea of making fortunes out of\r\nthe manufacture of woolen goods from the fleece of the buffalo, and for\r\nthat purpose organized the Buffalo Wool Company, the principal object of\r\nwhich was declared to be \"to provide a substitute for wool, which\r\nsubstitute was to be the wool of the wild buffalo, which was to be\r\ncollected in the plains and manufactured both for the use of the\r\ncolonists and for export.\" A large number of skilled workmen of various\r\nkinds were procured from England, and also a plant of machinery and\r\nmaterials. When too late, it was found that the supply of buffalo wool\r\nobtainable was utterly insufficient, the raw wool costing the company\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ per pound, and cloth which it cost the company £2 10_s._\r\nper yard to produce was worth only 4_s._ 6_d._ per yard in England. The\r\nhistorian states that universal drunkenness on the part of all concerned\r\naided very materially in bringing about the total failure of the\r\nenterprise in a very short time.\r\n\r\n[Note 48: The American Bison, p. 197.]\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to manufacture the fine, woolly fur of the bison\r\ninto cloth or knitted garments, provided a sufficient supply of the raw\r\nmaterial could be obtained (which is and always has been impossible),\r\nnothing could be more visionary than an attempt to thus produce salable\r\ngarments at a profit.\r\n\r\nArticles of wearing apparel made of buffalo's hair are interesting as\r\ncuriosities, for their rarity makes them so, but that is the only end\r\nthey can ever serve so long as there is a sheep living.\r\n\r\nIn the National Museum, in the section of animal products, there is\r\ndisplayed a pair of stockings made in Canada from the finest buffalo\r\nwool, from the body of the animal. They are thick, heavy, and full of\r\nthe coarse, straight hairs, which it seems can never be entirely\r\nseparated from the fine wool. In general texture they are as coarse as\r\nthe coarsest sheep's wool would produce.\r\n\r\nWith the above are also displayed a rope-like lariat, made by the\r\nComanche Indians, and a smaller braided lasso, seemingly a sample more\r\nthan a full-grown lariat, made by the Otoe Indians of Nebraska. Both of\r\nthe above are made of the long, dark-brown hair of the head and\r\nshoulders, and in spite of the fact that they have been twisted as hard\r\nas possible, the ends of the hairs protrude so persistently that the\r\nsurface of each rope is extremely hairy.\r\n\r\n_Buffalo chips._--Last, but by no means least in value to the traveler\r\non the treeless plains, are the droppings of the buffalo, universally\r\nknown as \"buffalo chips.\" When over one year old and thoroughly dry,\r\nthis material makes excellent fuel. Usually it occurs only where\r\nfire-wood is unobtainable, and thousands of frontiersmen have a million\r\ntimes found it of priceless value. When dry, it catches easily, burns\r\nreadily, and makes a hot fire with but very little smoke, although it is\r\nrapidly consumed. Although not as good for a fire as even the poorest\r\ntimber it is infinitely better than sage-brush, which, in the absence of\r\nchips, is often the traveler's last resort.\r\n\r\nIt usually happens that chips are most-abundant in the sheltered\r\ncreek-bottoms and near the water-holes, the very situations which\r\ntravelers naturally select for their camps. In these spots the herds\r\nhave gathered either for shelter in winter or for water in summer, and\r\nremained in a body for some hours. And now, when the cowboy on the\r\nround-up, the surveyor, or hunter, who must camp out, pitches his tent\r\nin the grassy coulée or narrow creek-bottom, his first care is to start\r\nout with his largest gunning bag to \"rustle some buffalo chips\" for a\r\ncampfire. He, at least, when he returns well laden with the spoil of his\r\nhumble chase, still has good reason to remember the departed herd with\r\nfeelings of gratitude. Thus even the last remains of this most useful\r\nanimal are utilized by man in providing for his own imperative wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE BISON TO CATTLE-GROWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The bison in captivity and domestication._--Almost from time immemorial\r\nit has been known that the American bison takes kindly to captivity,\r\nherds contentedly with domestic cattle, and crosses with them with the\r\nutmost readiness. It was formerly believed, and indeed the tradition\r\nprevails even now to quite an extent, that on account of the hump on the\r\nshoulders a domestic cow could not give birth to a half-breed calf. This\r\nbelief is entirely without foundation, and is due to theories rather\r\nthan facts.\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments in buffalo breeding have been made, and the subject\r\nis far from being a new one. As early as 1701 the Huguenot settlers at\r\nManikintown, on the James River, a few miles above Richmond, began to\r\ndomesticate buffaloes. It is also a matter of historical record that in\r\n1786, or thereabouts, buffaloes were domesticated and bred in captivity\r\nin Virginia, and Albert Gallatin states that in some of the northwestern\r\ncounties the mixed breed was quite common. In 1815 a series of elaborate\r\nand valuable experiments in cross-breeding the buffalo and domestic\r\ncattle was begun by Mr. Robert Wickliffe, of Lexington, Ky., and\r\ncontinued by him for upwards of thirty years.[49]\r\n\r\n[Note 49: For a full account of Mr. Wickliffe's experiments, written\r\nby himself, see Audubon and Bachman's \"Quadrupeds of North America,\"\r\nvol. ii, pp. 52-54.]\r\n\r\nQuite recently the buffalo-breeding operations of Mr. S. L. Bedson, of\r\nStony Mountain, Manitoba, and Mr. C. J. Jones, of Garden City, Kans.,\r\nhave attracted much attention, particularly for the reason that the\r\nefforts of both these gentlemen have been directed toward the practical\r\nimprovement of the present breeds of range cattle. For this reason the\r\nimportance of the work in which they are engaged can hardly be\r\noverestimated, and the results already obtained by Mr. Bedson, whose\r\nexperiments antedate those of Mr. Jones by several years, are of the\r\ngreatest interest to western cattle-growers. Indeed, unless the stock of\r\npure-blood buffaloes now remaining proves insufficient for the purpose,\r\nI fully believe that we will gradually see a great change wrought in the\r\ncharacter of western cattle by the introduction of a strain of buffalo\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe experiments which have been made thus far prove conclusively that--\r\n\r\n(1) The male bison crosses readily with the opposite sex of domestic\r\ncattle, but a buffalo cow has never been known to produce a half-breed\r\ncalf.\r\n\r\n(2) The domestic cow produces a half-breed calf successfully.\r\n\r\n(3) The progeny of the two species is fertile to any extent, yielding\r\nhalf-breeds, quarter, three-quarter breeds, and so on.\r\n\r\n(4) The bison breeds in captivity with perfect regularity and success.\r\n\r\n_Need of an improvement in range cattle._--Ever since the earliest days\r\nof cattle-ranching in the West, stockmen have had it in their power to\r\nproduce a breed which would equal in beef-bearing qualities the best\r\nbreeds to be found upon the plains, and be so much better calculated to\r\nsurvive the hardships of winter, that their annual losses would have\r\nbeen very greatly reduced. Whenever there is an unusually severe winter,\r\nsuch as comes about three times in every decade, if not even oftener,\r\nrange cattle perish by thousands. It is an absolute impossibility for\r\nevery ranchman who owns several thousand, or even several hundred, head\r\nof cattle to provide hay for them, even during the severest portion of\r\nthe winter season, and consequently the cattle must depend wholly upon\r\ntheir own resources. When the winter is reasonably mild, and the snows\r\nnever very deep, nor lying too long at a time on the ground, the cattle\r\nlive through the winter with very satisfactory success. Thanks to the\r\nwind, it usually happens that the falling snow is blown off the ridges\r\nas fast as it falls, leaving the grass sufficiently uncovered for the\r\ncattle to feed upon it. If the snow-fall is universal, but not more than\r\na few inches in depth, the cattle paw through it here and there, and eke\r\nout a subsistence, on quarter rations it may be, until a friendly\r\nchinook wind sets in from the southwest and dissolves the snow as if by\r\nmagic in a few hours' time.\r\n\r\nBut when a deep snow comes, and lies on the ground persistently, week in\r\nand week out, when the warmth of the sun softens and moistens its\r\nsurface sufficiently for a returning cold wave to freeze it into a hard\r\ncrust, forming a universal wall of ice between the luckless steer and\r\nhis only food, the cattle starve and freeze in immense numbers. Being\r\ntotally unfitted by nature to survive such unnatural conditions, it is\r\nnot strange that they succumb.\r\n\r\nUnder present conditions the stockman simply stakes his cattle against\r\nthe winter elements and takes his chances on the results, which are\r\ngoverned by circumstances wholly beyond his control. The losses of the\r\nfearful winter of 1886-'87 will probably never be forgotten by the\r\ncattlemen of the great Western grazing ground. In many portions of\r\nMontana and Wyoming the cattlemen admitted a loss of 50 per cent of\r\ntheir cattle, and in some localities the loss was still greater. The\r\nsame conditions are liable to prevail next winter, or any succeeding\r\nwinter, and we may yet see more than half the range cattle in the West\r\nperish in a single month.\r\n\r\nYet all this time the cattlemen have had it in their power, by the\r\neasiest and simplest method in the world, to introduce a strain of hardy\r\nnative blood in their stock which would have made it capable of\r\nsuccessfully resisting a much greater degree of hunger and cold. It is\r\nreally surprising that the desirability of cross-breeding the buffalo\r\nand domestic cattle should for so long a time have been either\r\noverlooked or disregarded. While cattle-growers generally have shown the\r\ngreatest enterprise in producing special breeds for milk, for butter, or\r\nfor beef, cattle with short horns and cattle with no horns at all, only\r\ntwo or three men have had the enterprise to try to produce a breed\r\nparticularly hardy and capable.\r\n\r\nA buffalo can weather storms and outlive hunger and cold which would\r\nkill any domestic steer that ever lived. When nature placed him on the\r\ntreeless and blizzard-swept plains, she left him well equipped to\r\nsurvive whatever natural conditions he would have to encounter. The most\r\nstriking feature of his entire _tout ensemble_ is his magnificent suit\r\nof hair and fur combined, the warmest covering possessed by any\r\nquadruped save the musk-ox. The head, neck, and fore quarters are\r\nclothed with hide and hair so thick as to be almost, if not entirely,\r\nimpervious to cold. The hair on the body and hind quarters is long,\r\nfine, very thick, and of that peculiar woolly quality which constitutes\r\nthe best possible protection against cold. Let him who doubts the warmth\r\nof a good buffalo robe try to weather a blizzard with something else,\r\nand then try the robe. The very form of the buffalo--short, thick legs,\r\nand head hung very near the ground--suggests most forcibly a special\r\nfitness to wrestle with mother earth for a living, snow or no snow. A\r\nbuffalo will flounder for days through deep snow-drifts without a morsel\r\nof food, and survive where the best range steer would literally freeze\r\non foot, bolt upright, as hundreds did in the winter of 1886-'87. While\r\nrange cattle turn tail to a blizzard and drift helplessly, the buffalo\r\nfaces it every time, and remains master of the situation.\r\n\r\nIt has for years been a surprise to me that Western stockmen have not\r\nseized upon the opportunity presented by the presence of the buffalo to\r\nimprove the character of their cattle. Now that there are no longer any\r\nbuffalo calves to be had on the plains for the trouble of catching them,\r\nand the few domesticated buffaloes that remain are worth fabulous\r\nprices, we may expect to see a great deal of interest manifested in this\r\nsubject, and some costly efforts made to atone for previous lack of\r\nforethought.\r\n\r\n_The character of the buffalo-domestic hybrid._--The subjoined\r\nillustration from a photograph kindly furnished by Mr. C. J. Jones,\r\nrepresents a ten months' old half-breed calf (male), the product of a\r\nbuffalo bull and domestic cow. The prepotency of the sire is apparent at\r\nthe first glance, and to so marked an extent that the illustration would\r\npass muster anywhere as having been drawn from a full-blood buffalo. The\r\nhead, neck, and hump, and the long woolly hair that covers them,\r\nproclaim the buffalo in every line. Excepting that the hair on the\r\nshoulders (below the hump) is of the same length as that on the body and\r\nhind quarters, there is, so far as one can judge from an excellent\r\nphotograph, no difference whatever observable between this lusty young\r\nhalf-breed and a full blood buffalo calf of the same age and sex. Mr.\r\nJones describes the color of this animal as \"iron-gray,\" and remarks:\r\n\"You will see how even the fur is, being as long on the hind parts as on\r\nthe shoulders and neck, very much unlike the buffalo, which is so shaggy\r\nabout the shoulders and so thin farther back.\" Upon this point it is to\r\nbe remarked that the hair on the body of a yearling or two year-old\r\nbuffalo is always very much longer in proportion to the hair on the\r\nforward parts than it is later in life, and while the shoulder hair is\r\nalways decidedly longer than that back of it, during the first two years\r\nthe contrast is by no means so very great. A reference to the memoranda\r\nof hair measurements already given will afford precise data on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIn regard to half-breed calves, Mr. Bedson states in a private letter\r\nthat \"the hump does not appear until several months after birth.\"\r\n\r\nAltogether, the male calf described above so strongly resembles a\r\npure-blood buffalo as to be generally mistaken for one; the form of the\r\nadult half-blood cow promptly proclaims her origin. The accompanying\r\nplate, also from a photograph supplied by Mr. Jones, accurately\r\nrepresents a half-breed cow, six years old, weighing about 1,800 pounds.\r\nHer body is very noticeably larger in proportion than that of the cow\r\nbuffalo, her pelvis much heavier, broader, and more cow-like, therein\r\nbeing a decided improvement upon the small and weak hind quarters of the\r\nwild species. The hump is quite noticeable, but is not nearly so high as\r\nin the pure buffalo cow. The hair on the fore quarters, neck, and head\r\nis decidedly shorter, especially on the head; the frontlet and chin\r\nbeard being conspicuously lacking. The tufts of long, coarse, black hair\r\nwhich clothe the fore-arm of the buffalo cow are almost absent, but\r\napparently the hair on the body and hind quarters has lost but little,\r\nif any, of its length, density, and fine, furry quality. The horns are\r\ndecidedly cow-like in their size, length, and curvature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALF-BREED (BUFFALO-DOMESTIC) CALF.--HERD OF C. J. JONES,\r\nGARDEN CITY, KANSAS. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.]\r\n\r\nRegarding the general character of the half-breed buffalo, and his herd\r\nin general, Mr. Bedson writes me as follows, in a letter dated September\r\n12, 1888:\r\n\r\n\"The nucleus of my herd consisted of a young buffalo bull and four\r\nheifer calves, which I purchased in 1877, and the increase from these\r\nfew has been most rapid, as will be shown by a tabular statement farther\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"Success with the breeding of the pure buffalo was followed by\r\nexperiments in crossing with the domestic animal. This crossing has\r\ngenerally been between a buffalo bull and an ordinary cow, and with the\r\nmost encouraging results, since it had been contended by many that\r\nalthough the cow might breed a calf from the buffalo, yet it would be at\r\nthe expense of her life, owing to the hump on a buffalo's shoulder; but\r\nthis hump does not appear until several months after birth. This has\r\nbeen proved a fallacy respecting _this herd_ at least, for calving has\r\nbeen attended with no greater percentage of losses than would be\r\nexperienced in ranching with the ordinary cattle. Buffalo cows and\r\ncrosses have dropped calves at as low a temperature as 20° below zero,\r\nand the calves were sturdy and healthy.\r\n\r\n\"The half breed resulting from the cross as above mentioned has been\r\nagain crossed with the thoroughbred buffalo bull, producing a three\r\nquarter breed animal closely resembling the buffalo, the head and robe\r\nbeing quite equal, if not superior. The half-breeds are very prolific.\r\nThe cows drop a calf annually. They are also very hardy indeed, as they\r\ntake the instinct of the buffalo during the blizzards and storms, and do\r\nnot drift like native cattle. They remain upon the open prairie during\r\nour severest winters, while the thermometer ranges from 30 to 40 degrees\r\nbelow zero, with little or no food except what they rustled on the\r\nprairie, and no shelter at all. In nearly all the ranching parts of\r\nNorth America foddering and housing of cattle is imperative in a more or\r\nless degree,[50] creating an item of expense felt by all interested in\r\ncattle-raising; but the buffalo [half]breed retains all its native\r\nhardihood, needs no housing, forages in the deepest snows for its own\r\nfood, yet becomes easily domesticated, and consequently needs but little\r\nherding. Therefore the progeny of the buffalo is easily reared, cheaply\r\nfed, and requires no housing in winter; three very essential points in\r\nstock-raising.\r\n\r\n[Note 50: On nearly all the great cattle ranches of the United States\r\nit is absolutely impossible, and is not even attempted.--W. T. H.]\r\n\r\n\"They are always in good order, and I consider the meat of the\r\nhalf-breed much preferable to domestic animals, while the robe is very\r\nfine indeed, the fur being evened up on the hind parts, the same as on\r\nthe shoulders. During the history of the herd, accident and other causes\r\nhave compelled the slaughtering of one or two, and in these instances\r\nthe carcasses have sold for 18 cents per pound; the hides in their\r\ndressed state for $50 to $75 each. A half-breed buffalo ox (four years\r\nold, crossed with buffalo bull and Durham cow) was killed last winter,\r\nand weighed 1,280 pounds dressed beef. One pure buffalo bull now in my\r\nherd weighs fully 2,000 pounds, and a [half]breed bull 1,700 to 1,800\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\"The three-quarter breed is an enormous animal in size, and has an extra\r\ngood robe, which will readily bring $40 to $50 in any market where there\r\nis a demand for robes. They are also very prolific, and I consider them\r\nthe coming cattle for our range cattle for the Northern climate, while\r\nthe half and quarter breeds will be the animals for the more Southern\r\ndistrict. The half and three-quarter breed cows, when really matured,\r\nwill weigh from 1,400 to 1,800 pounds.\r\n\r\n\"I have never crossed them except with a common grade of cows, while I\r\nbelieve a cross with the Galloways would produce the handsomest robe\r\never handled, and make the best range cattle in the world. I have not\r\nhad time to give my attention to my herd, more than to let them range on\r\nthe prairies at will. By proper care great results can be accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nHon. C. J. Jones, of Garden City, Kans., whose years of experience with\r\nthe buffalo, both as old-time hunter, catcher, and breeder, has earned\r\nfor him the sobriquet of \"Buffalo Jones,\" five years ago became deeply\r\ninterested in the question of improving range cattle by crossing with\r\nthe buffalo. With characteristic Western energy he has pursued the\r\nsubject from that time until the present, having made five trips to the\r\nrange of the only buffaloes remaining from the great southern herd, and\r\ncaptured sixty-eight buffalo calves and eleven adult cows with which to\r\nstart a herd. In a short article published in the Farmers' Review\r\n(Chicago, August 22, 1888), Mr. Jones gives his views on the value of\r\nthe buffalo in cross-breeding as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In all my meanderings I have not found a place but I could count more\r\ncarcasses [of cattle] than living animals. Who has not ridden over some\r\nof the Western railways and counted dead cattle by the thousands? The\r\ngreat question is, Where can we get a race of cattle that will stand\r\nblizzards, and endure the drifting snow, and will not be driven with the\r\nstorms against the railroad fences and pasture fences, there to perish\r\nfor the want of nerve to face the northern winds for a few miles, to\r\nwhere the winter grasses could be had in abundance? Realizing these\r\nfacts, both from observation and pocket, we pulled on our 'thinking\r\ncap,' and these points came vividly to our mind:\r\n\r\n\"(1) We want an animal that is hardy.\r\n\r\n\"(2) We want an animal with nerve and endurance.\r\n\r\n\"(3) We want an animal that faces the blizzards and endures the storms.\r\n\r\n\"(4) We want an animal that will rustle the prairies, and not yield to\r\ndiscouragement.\r\n\r\n\"(5) We want an animal that will fill the above bill, and make good\r\nbeef and plenty of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALF-BREED (BUFFALO-DOMESTIC) COW.--HERD OF C. J. JONES,\r\nGARDEN CITY, KANSAS. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.]\r\n\r\n\"All the points above could easily be found in the buffalo, excepting\r\nthe fifth, and even that is more than filled as to the quality, but not\r\nin quantity. Where is the 'old timer' who has not had a cut from the\r\nhump or sirloin of a fat buffalo cow in the fall of the year, and where\r\nis the one who will not make affidavit that it was the best meat he ever\r\nate? Yes, the fat was very rich, equal to the marrow from the bone of\r\ndomestic cattle. * * *\r\n\r\n\"The great question remained unsolved as to the quantity of meat from\r\nthe buffalo. I finally heard of a half-breed buffalo in Colorado, and\r\nimmediately set out to find it. I traveled at least 1,000 miles to find\r\nit, and found a five-year-old half-breed cow that had been bred to\r\ndomestic bulls and had brought forth two calves--a yearling and a\r\nsucking calf that gave promise of great results.\r\n\r\n\"The cow had never been fed, but depended altogether on the range, and\r\nwhen I saw her, in the fall of 1883. I estimated her weight at 1,800\r\npounds. She was a brindle, and had a handsome robe even in September;\r\nshe had as good hind quarters as ordinary cattle; her foreparts were\r\nheavy and resembled the buffalo, yet not near so much of the hump. The\r\noffspring showed but very little of the buffalo, yet they possessed a\r\nwoolly coat, which showed clearly that they were more than domestic\r\ncattle. * * *\r\n\r\n\"What we can rely on by having one-fourth, one-half, and three-fourths\r\nbreeds might be analyzed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We can depend upon a race of cattle unequaled in the world for\r\nhardiness and durability; a good meat-bearing animal; the best and only\r\nfur-bearing animal of the bovine race; the animal always found in a\r\nstorm where it is overtaken by it; a race of cattle so clannish as never\r\nto separate and go astray; the animal that can always have free range,\r\nas they exist where no other animal can live; the animal that can water\r\nevery third day and keep fat, ranging from 20 to 30 miles from water; in\r\nfact, they are the perfect animal for the plains of North America.\r\nOne-fourth breeds for Texas, one-half breeds for Colorado and Kansas,\r\nand three-fourths breeds for more northern country, is what will soon be\r\nsought after more than any living animal. Then we will never be\r\nconfronted with dead carcarsses from starvation, exhaustion, and lack of\r\nnerve, as in years gone by.\"\r\n\r\n_The bison as a beast of burden._--On account of the abundance of horses\r\nfor all purposes throughout the entire country, oxen are so seldom used\r\nthey almost constitute a curiosity. There never has existed a necessity\r\nto break buffaloes to the yoke and work them like domestic oxen, and so\r\nfew experiments have been made in this direction that reliable data on\r\nthis subject is almost wholly wanting. While at Miles City, Mont., I\r\nheard of a German \"granger\" who worked a small farm in the Tongue River\r\nValley, and who once had a pair of cow buffaloes trained to the yoke.\r\nIt was said that they were strong, rapid walkers, and capable of\r\nperforming as much work as the best domestic oxen, but they were at\r\ntimes so uncontrollably headstrong and obstinate as to greatly detract\r\nfrom their usefulness. The particular event of their career on which\r\ntheir historian dwelt with special interest occurred when their owner\r\nwas hauling a load of potatoes to town with them. In the course of the\r\nlong drive the buffaloes grew very thirsty, and upon coming within sight\r\nof the water in the river they started for it in a straight course. The\r\nshouts and blows of the driver only served to hasten their speed, and\r\npresently, when they reached the edge of the high bank, they plunged\r\ndown it without the slightest hesitation, wagon, potatoes, and all, to\r\nthe loss of everything except themselves and the drink they went after!\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Wickliffe states that trained buffaloes make satisfactory\r\noxen. \"I have broken them to the yoke, and found them capable of making\r\nexcellent oxen; and for drawing wagons, carts, or other heavily laden\r\nvehicles on long journeys they would, I think, be greatly preferable to\r\nthe common ox.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that, in the absence of horses, the buffalo would make\r\na much more speedy and enduring draught animal than the domestic ox,\r\nalthough it is to be doubted whether he would be as strong. His weaker\r\npelvis and hind quarters would surely count against him under certain\r\ncircumstances, but for some purposes his superior speed and endurance\r\nwould more than counterbalance that defect.\r\n\r\nBISON HERDS AND INDIVIDUALS IN CAPTIVITY AND DOMESTICATION, JANUARY 1,\r\n1889.\r\n\r\n_Herd of Mr. S. L. Bedson, Stony Mountain, Manitoba._--In 1877 Mr.\r\nBedson purchased 5 buffalo calves, 1 bull, and 4 heifers, for which he\r\npaid $1,000. In 1888 his herd consisted of 23 full-blood bulls, 35 cows,\r\n3 half-breed cows, 5 half-breed bulls, and 17 calves, mixed and\r\npure;[51] making a total of 83 head. These were all produced from the\r\noriginal 5, no purchases having been made, nor any additions made in any\r\nother way. Besides the 83 head constituting the herd when it was sold, 5\r\nwere killed and 9 given away, which would otherwise make a total of 97\r\nhead produced since 1877. In November, 1888, this entire herd was\r\npurchased, for $50,000, by Mr. C. J. Jones, and added to the already\r\nlarge herd owned by that gentleman in Kansas.\r\n\r\n[Note 51: In summing up the total number of buffaloes and mixed-breeds\r\nnow alive in captivity, I have been obliged to strike an average on this\r\nlot of calves \"mixed and pure,\" and have counted twelve as being of pure\r\nbreed and five mixed, which I have reason to believe is very near the\r\ntruth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG HALF-BREED (BUFFALO-DOMESTIC) BULL.--HERD OF C. J.\r\nJONES, GARDEN CITY, KANSAS. Drawn by Ernest E. Thompson.]\r\n\r\n_Herd of Mr. C. J. Jones, Garden City, Kans._--Mr. Jones's original herd\r\nof 57 buffaloes constitute a living testimonial to his individual\r\nenterprise, and to his courage, endurance, and skill in the chase. The\r\nmajority of the individuals composing the herd he himself ran down,\r\nlassoed, and tied with his own hands. For the last five years Mr. Jones\r\nhas made an annual trip, in June, to the uninhabited \"panhandle\" of\r\nTexas, to capture calves out of the small herd of from one hundred to\r\ntwo hundred head which represented the last remnant of the great\r\nsouthern herd. Each of these expeditious involved a very considerable\r\noutlay in money, an elaborate \"outfit\" of men, horses, vehicles, camp\r\nequipage, and lastly, but most important of all, a herd of a dozen fresh\r\nmilch cows to nourish the captured calves and keep them from dying of\r\nstarvation and thirst. The region visited was fearfully barren, almost\r\nwithout water, and to penetrate it was always attended by great\r\nhardship. The buffaloes were difficult to find, but the ground was good\r\nfor running, being chiefly level plains, and the superior speed of the\r\nrunning horses always enabled the hunters to overtake a herd whenever\r\none was sighted, and to \"cut out\" and lasso two, three, or four of its\r\ncalves. The degree of skill and daring displayed in these several\r\nexpeditions are worthy of the highest admiration, and completely surpass\r\nanything I have ever seen or read of being accomplished in connection\r\nwith hunting, or the capture of live game. The latest feat of Mr. Jones\r\nand his party comes the nearest to being incredible. During the month of\r\nMay, 1888, they not only captured seven calves, but also _eleven adult\r\ncows_, of which some were lassoed in full career on the prairie, thrown,\r\ntied, and hobbled! The majority, however, were actually \"rounded up,\"\r\nherded, and held in control until a bunch of tame buffaloes was driven\r\ndown to meet them, so that it would thus be possible to drive all\r\ntogether to a ranch. This brilliant feat can only be appreciated as it\r\ndeserves by those who have lately hunted buffalo, and learned by dear\r\nexperience the extent of their wariness, and the difficulties, to say\r\nnothing of the dangers, inseparably connected with their pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe result of each of Mr. Jones's five expeditions is as follows: In\r\n1884 no calves found; 1885, 11 calves captured, 5 died, 6 survived;\r\n1886, 14 calves captured, 7 died, 7 survived; 1887, 36 calves captured,\r\n6 died, 30 survived; 1888, 7 calves captured, all survived; 1888, 11 old\r\ncows captured, all survived. Total, 79 captures, 18 losses, 57\r\nsurvivors.\r\n\r\nThe census of the herd is exactly as follows: Adult cows, 11; three-year\r\nolds, 7, of which 2 are males and 5 females; two-year olds, 4, of which\r\nall are males; yearling, 28, of which 15 are males and 13 females;\r\ncalves, 7, of which 3 are males and 4 females. Total herd, 57; 24 males\r\nand 33 females. To this, Mr. Jones's original herd, must now be added\r\nthe entire herd formerly owned by Mr. Bedson.\r\n\r\nRespecting his breeding operations Mr. Jones writes: \"My oldest [bull]\r\nbuffaloes are now three years old, and I am breeding one hundred\r\ndomestic cows to them this year. Am breeding the Galloway cows quite\r\nextensively; also some Shorthorns, Herefords, and Texas cows. I expect\r\nbest results from the Galloways. If I can get the black luster of the\r\nlatter and the fur of a buffalo, I will have a robe that will bring more\r\nmoney than we get for the average range steer.\"\r\n\r\nIn November, 1888, Mr. Jones purchased Mr. Bedson's entire herd, and in\r\nthe following mouth proceeded to ship a portion of it to Kansas City.\r\nThirty-three head were separated from the remainder of the herd on the\r\nprairie near Stony Mountain, 12 miles from Winnipeg, and driven to the\r\nrailroad. Several old bulls broke away en route and ran back to the\r\nherd, and when the remainder were finally corraled in the pens at the\r\nstock-yards \"they began to fight among themselves, and some fierce\r\nencounters were waged between the old bulls. The younger cattle were\r\nraised on the horns of their seniors, thrown in the air, and otherwise\r\ngored.\" While on the way to St. Paul three of the half-breed buffaloes\r\nwere killed by their companions. On reaching Kansas City and unloading\r\nthe two cars, 13 head broke away from the large force of men that\r\nattempted to manage them, stampeded through the city, and finally took\r\nrefuge in the low-lands along the river. In due time, however, all were\r\nrecaptured.\r\n\r\nSince the acquisition of this northern herd and the subsequent press\r\ncomment that it has evoked, Mr. Jones has been almost overwhelmed with\r\nletters of inquiry in regard to the whole subject of buffalo breeding,\r\nand has found it necessary to print and distribute a circular giving\r\nanswers to the many inquiries that have been made.\r\n\r\n_Herd of Mr. Charles Allard, Flathead Indian Reservation,\r\nMontana._--This herd was visited in the autumn of 1888 by Mr. G. O.\r\nShields, of Chicago, who reports that it consists of thirty-five head of\r\npure-blood buffaloes, of which seven are calves of 1888, six are\r\nyearlings, and six are two-year olds. Of the adult animals, four cows\r\nand two bulls are each fourteen years old, \"and the beards of the bulls\r\nalmost sweep the ground as they walk.\"\r\n\r\n_Herd of Hon. W. F. Cody (\"Buffalo Bill\")._--The celebrated \"Wild West\r\nShow\" has, ever since its organization, numbered amongst its leading\r\nattractions a herd of live buffaloes of all ages. At present this herd\r\ncontains eighteen head, of which fourteen were originally purchased of\r\nMr. H. T. Groome, of Wichita, Kansas, and have made a journey to London\r\nand back. As a proof of the indomitable persistence of the bison in\r\nbreeding under most unfavorable circumstances, the fact that four of the\r\nmembers of this herd are calves which were born in 1888 in London, at\r\nthe American Exposition, is of considerable interest.\r\n\r\nThis herd is now (December, 1888) being wintered on General Beale's\r\nfarm, near the city of Washington. In 1886-'87, while the Wild West Show\r\nwas at Madison Square Garden, New York City, its entire herd of twenty\r\nbuffaloes was carried off by pleuro-pneumonia. It is to be greatly\r\nfeared that sooner or later in the course of its travels the present\r\nherd will also disappear, either through disease or accident.\r\n\r\n_Herd of Mr. Charles Goodnight, Clarendon, Texas._--Mr. Goodnight writes\r\nthat he has \"been breeding buffaloes in a small way for the past ten\r\nyears,\" but without giving any particular attention to it. At present\r\nhis herd consists of thirteen head, of which two are three-year old\r\nbulls and four are calves. There are seven cows of all ages, one of\r\nwhich is a half-breed.\r\n\r\n_Herd at the Zoological Society's Gardens, Philadelphia, Arthur E.\r\nBrown, superintendent._--This institution is the fortunate possessor of\r\na small herd of ten buffaloes, of which four are males and six females.\r\nTwo are calves of 1877. In 1886 the Gardens sold an adult bull and cow\r\nto Hon. W. F. Cody for $300.\r\n\r\n_Herd at Bismarck Grove, Kansas, owned by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa\r\nFé Railroad Company._--A small herd of buffaloes has for several years\r\npast been kept at Bismarck Grove as an attraction to visitors. At\r\npresent it contains ten head, one of which is a very large bull, another\r\nin a four-year-old bull, six are cows of various ages, and two are\r\ntwo-year olds. In 1885 a large bull belonging to this herd grew so\r\nvicious and dangerous that it was necessary to kill him.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account of this herd was published in the\r\nKansas City Times of December 8, 1888:\r\n\r\n\"Thirteen years ago Colonel Stanton purchased a buffalo bull calf for $8\r\nand two heifers for $25. The descendants of these three buffaloes now\r\nfound at Bismarck Grove, where all were born, number in all ten. There\r\nwere seventeen, but the rest have died, with the exception of one, which\r\nwas given away. They are kept in an inclosure containing about 30 acres\r\nimmediately adjoining the park, and there may be seen at any time. The\r\nsight is one well worth a trip and the slight expense that may attach to\r\nit, especially to one who has never seen the American bison in his\r\nnative state.\r\n\r\n\"The present herd includes two fine bull calves dropped last spring, two\r\nheifers, five cows, and a bull six years old and as handsome as a\r\npicture. The latter has been named Cleveland, after the colonel's\r\nfavorite Presidential candidate. The entire herd is in as fine condition\r\nas any beef cattle, though they were never fed anything but hay and are\r\nnever given any shelter. In fact they don't take kindly to shelter, and\r\nwhether a blizzard is blowing, with the mercury 20 degrees below zero,\r\nor the sun pouring down his scorching rays, with the thermometer 110\r\ndegrees above, they set their heads resolutely toward storm or sun and\r\ntake their medicine as if they liked it. Hon. W. F. Cody, \"Buffalo\r\nBill,\" tried to buy the whole herd two years ago to take to Europe with\r\nhis Wild West Show, but they were not for sale at his own figures, and,\r\nindeed, there is no anxiety to dispose of them at any figures. The\r\nrailroad company has been glad to furnish them pasturage for the sake of\r\nadding to the attractions of the park, in which there are also\r\nforty-three head of deer, including two as fine bucks as ever trotted\r\nover the national deer trail toward the salt-licks in northern Utah.\r\n\r\n\"While the bison at Bismark Grove are splendid specimens of their class,\r\n\"Cleveland\" is decidedly the pride of the herd, and as grand a creature\r\nas ever trod the soil of Kansas on four legs. He is just six years old\r\nand is a perfect specimen of the kings of the plains. There is royal\r\nblood in his veins, and his coat is finer than the imperial purple. It\r\nis not possible to get at him to measure his stature and weight. He must\r\nweigh fully 3,000 pounds, and it is doubtful if there is to-day living\r\non the face of the earth a handsomer buffalo bull than he. \"Cleveland's\"\r\ndisposition is not so ugly as old Barney's was, but at certain seasons\r\nhe is very wild, and there is no one venturesome enough to go into the\r\ninclosure. It is then not altogether safe to even look over the high and\r\nheavy board fence at him, for he is likely to make a run for the\r\nvisitor, as the numerous holes in the fence where he has knocked off the\r\nboards will testify.\"\r\n\r\n_Herd of Mr. Frederick Dupree, Cheyenne Indian Agency, near Fort\r\nBennett, Dakota._--This herd contains at present nine pure-blood\r\nbuffaloes, five of which are cows and seven mixed bloods. Of the former,\r\nthere are two adult bulls and four adult cows. Of the mixed blood\r\nanimals, six are half-breeds and one a quarter-breed buffalo.\r\n\r\nMr. Dupree obtained the nucleus of his herd in 1882, at which time he\r\ncaptured five wild calves about 100 miles west of Fort Bennett. Of\r\nthese, two died after two months of captivity and a third was killed by\r\nan Indian in 1885.\r\n\r\nMr. D. F. Carlin, of the Indian service, at Fort Bennett, has kindly\r\nfurnished me the following information respecting this herd, under date\r\nof November 1, 1888:\r\n\r\n\"The animals composing this herd are all in fine condition and are quite\r\ntame. They keep by themselves most of the time, except the oldest bull\r\n(six years old), who seems to appreciate the company of domestic cattle\r\nmore than that of his own family. Mr. Dupree has kept one half-breed\r\nbull as an experiment; he thinks it will produce a hardy class of\r\ncattle. His half-breeds are all black, with one exception, and that is a\r\nroan; but they are all built like the buffalo, and when young they grunt\r\nmore like a hog than like a calf, the same as a full-blood buffalo.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dupree has never lost a [domestic] cow in giving birth to a\r\nhalf-breed calf, as was supposed by many people would be the case. There\r\nhave been no sales from this herd, although the owner has a standing\r\noffer of $650 for a cow and bull. The cows are not for sale at any\r\nprice.\"\r\n\r\n_Herd at Lincoln Park, Chicago, Mr. W. P. Walker, superintendent._--This\r\nvery interesting and handsomely-kept herd is composed of seven\r\nindividuals of the following character: One bull eight years old, one\r\nbull four years old, two cows eight years old, two cows two years old in\r\nthe spring of 1888, and one female calf born in the spring of 1888.\r\n\r\n_Zoological Gardens, Cincinnati, Ohio._--This collection contains four\r\nbison, an adult bull and cow, and one immature specimen.\r\n\r\n_Dr. V. T. McGillicuddy, Rapid City, Dakota_, has a herd of four pure\r\nbuffaloes and one half-breed. Of the former, the two adults, a bull and\r\ncow seven years old, were caught by Sioux Indians near the Black Hills\r\nfor the owner in the spring of 1882. The Indians drove two milch cows to\r\nthe range to nourish the calves when caught. These have produced two\r\ncalves, one of which, a bull, is now three years old, and the other is a\r\nyearling heifer.\r\n\r\n_Central Park Menagerie, New York, Dr. W. A. Conklin, director._--This\r\nmuch-visited collection contains four bison, an adult bull and cow, a\r\ntwo-year-old calf, and a yearling.\r\n\r\n_Mr. John H. Starin, Glen Inland, near New York City._--There are four\r\nbuffaloes at this summer resort.\r\n\r\n_The U. S. National Museum, Washington, District of Columbia._--The\r\ncollection of the department of living animals at this institution\r\ncontains two fine young buffaloes; a bull four years old in July, 1888,\r\nand a cow three years old in May of the same year. These animals were\r\ncaptured in western Nebraska, when they were calves, by H. R. Jackett,\r\nof Ogalalla, and kept by him on his ranch until 1885. In April, 1888,\r\nHon. Eugene G. Blackford, of New York, purchased them of Mr. Frederick\r\nD. Nowell, of North Platte, Nebraska, for $100 for the pair, and\r\npresented them to the National Museum, in the hope that they might form\r\nthe nucleus of a herd to be owned and exhibited by the United States\r\nGovernment in or near the city of Washington. The two animals were\r\nreceived in Ogalalla by Mr. Joseph Palmer, of the National Museum, and\r\nby him they were brought on to Washington in May, in fine condition.\r\nSince their arrival they have been exhibited to the public in a\r\ntemporary inclosure on the Smithsonian Grounds, and have attracted much\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n_Mr. B. C. Winston, of Hamline, Minnesota_, owns a pair of buffaloes,\r\none of which, a young bull, was caught by him in western Dakota in the\r\nspring of 1886, soon after its birth. The cow was purchased at Rosseau,\r\nDakota Territory, a year later, for $225.\r\n\r\n_Mr. I. P. Butler, of Colorado, Texas_, is the owner of a young bull\r\nbuffalo and a half-breed calf.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Jesse Huston, of Miles City, Montana_, owns a fine five-year-old\r\nbull buffalo.\r\n\r\n_Mr. L. F. Gardner, of Bellwood, Oregon_, is the owner of a large adult\r\nbull.\r\n\r\n_The Riverside Ranch Company, south of Mandan, Dakota_, owns a pair of\r\nfull-blood buffaloes.\r\n\r\n_In Dakota_, in the hands of parties unknown, there are four full-blood\r\nbuffaloes.\r\n\r\n_Mr. James R. Hitch, of Optima, Indian Territory_, has a pair of young\r\nbuffaloes, which he has offered for sale for $750.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Joseph A. Hudson, of Estell, Nebraska_, owns a three-year-old bull\r\nbuffalo, which is for sale.\r\n\r\nIn other countries there are live specimens of _Bison americanus_\r\nreported as follows: two at Belleview Gardens, Manchester, England; one\r\nat the Zoological Gardens, London; one at Liverpool, England (purchased\r\nof Hon. W. F. Cody in 1888); two at the Zoological Gardens, Dresden; one\r\nat the Zoological Gardens, Calcutta.\r\n\r\n+--------------------------------------------------+\r\n|   _Statistics of full-blood buffaloes       |    |\r\n|     in captivity January 1, 1889._          |    |\r\n+---------------------------------------------+----+\r\n|Number kept for breeding purposes            | 216|\r\n|Number kept for exhibition                   |  40|\r\n|                                             | ---|\r\n|     Total pure-blood buffaloes in captivity | 256|\r\n|Wild buffaloes under Government              |    |\r\n|protection in the Yellowstone Park           | 200|\r\n|Number of mixed-breed buffalo-domestics      |  40|\r\n+--------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThere are, without doubt, a few half-breeds in Manitoba of which I have\r\nno account.

CAUSES OF THE EXTERMINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe causes which led to the practical extinction (in a wild state, at\r\nleast) of the most economically valuable wild animal that ever inhabited\r\nthe American continent, are by no means obscure. It is well that we\r\nshould know precisely what they were, and by the sad fate of the buffalo\r\nbe warned in time against allowing similar causes to produce the same\r\nresults with our elk, antelope, deer, moose, caribou, mountain sheep,\r\nmountain goat, walrus, and other animals. It will be doubly deplorable\r\nif the remorseless slaughter we have witnessed during the last twenty\r\nyears carries with it no lessons for the future. A continuation of the\r\nrecord we have lately made as wholesale game butchers will justify\r\nposterity in dating us back with the mound-builders and cave-dwellers,\r\nwhen man's only known function was to slay and eat.\r\n\r\nThe primary cause of the buffalo's extermination, and the one which\r\nembraced all others, was the descent of civilization, with all its\r\nelements of destructiveness, upon the whole of the country inhabited by\r\nthat animal. From the Great Slave Lake to the Rio Grande the home of the\r\nbuffalo was everywhere overrun by the man with a gun; and, as has ever\r\nbeen the case, the wild creatures were gradually swept away, the largest\r\nand most conspicuous forms being the first to go.\r\n\r\nThe secondary causes of the extermination of the buffalo may be\r\ncatalogued as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Man's reckless greed, his wanton destructiveness, and improvidence\r\nin not husbanding such resources as come to him from the hand of nature\r\nready made.\r\n\r\n(2) The total and utterly inexcusable absence of protective measures and\r\nagencies on the part of the National Government and of the West States\r\nand Territories.\r\n\r\n(3) The fatal preference on the part of hunters generally, both white\r\nand red, for the robe and flesh of the cow over that furnished by the\r\nbull.\r\n\r\n(4) The phenomenal stupidity of the animals themselves, and their\r\nindifference to man.\r\n\r\n(5) The perfection of modern breech-loading rifles and other sporting\r\nfire-arms in general.\r\n\r\nEach of these causes acted against the buffalo with its fall force, to\r\noffset which there was _not even one_ restraining or preserving\r\ninfluence, and it is not to be wondered at that the species went down\r\nbefore them. Had any one of these conditions been eliminated the result\r\nwould have been reached far less quickly. Had the buffalo, for example,\r\npossessed one-half the fighting qualities of the grizzly bear he would\r\nhave fared very differently, but his inoffensiveness and lack of courage\r\nalmost leads one to doubt the wisdom of the economy of nature so far as\r\nit relates to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. METHODS OF SLAUGHTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _The still-hunt._--Of all the deadly methods of buffalo slaughter,\r\nthe still-hunt was the deadliest. Of all the methods that were\r\nunsportsmanlike, unfair, ignoble, and utterly reprehensible, this was in\r\nevery respect the lowest and the worst. Destitute of nearly every\r\nelement of the buoyant excitement and spice of danger that accompanied\r\ngenuine buffalo hunting on horseback, the still-hunt was mere butchery\r\nof the tamest and yet most cruel kind. About it there was none of the\r\ntrue excitement of the chase; but there was plenty of greedy eagerness\r\nto \"down\" as many \"head\" as possible every day, just as there is in\r\nevery slaughter-house where the killers are paid so much per head.\r\nJudging from all accounts, it was about as exciting and dangerous work\r\nas it would be to go out now and shoot cattle on the Texas or Montana\r\nranges. The probabilities are, however, that shooting Texas cattle would\r\nbe the most dangerous; for, instead of running from a man on foot, as\r\nthe buffalo used to do, range cattle usually charge down upon him, from\r\nmotives of curiosity, perhaps, and not infrequently place his life in\r\nconsiderable jeopardy.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo owes his extermination very largely to his own unparalleled\r\nstupidity; for nothing else could by any possibility have enabled the\r\nstill-hunters to accomplish what they did in such an incredibly short\r\ntime. So long as the chase on horseback was the order of the day, it\r\nordinarily required the united efforts of from fifteen to twenty-five\r\nhunters to kill a thousand buffalo in a single season; but a single\r\nstill-hunter, with a long-range breech-loader, who knew how to make a\r\n\"sneak\" and get \"a stand on a bunch,\" often succeeded in killing from\r\none to three thousand in one season by his own unaided efforts. Capt.\r\nJack Brydges, of Kansas, who was one of the first to begin the final\r\nslaughter of the southern herd, killed, by contract, one thousand one\r\nhundred and forty-two buffaloes in six weeks.\r\n\r\nSo long as the buffalo remained in large herds their numbers gave each\r\nindividual a feeling of dependence upon his fellows and of general\r\nsecurity from harm, even in the presence of strange phenomena which he\r\ncould not understand. When he heard a loud report and saw a little cloud\r\nof white smoke rising from a gully, a clump of sage-brash, or the top of\r\na ridge, 200 yards away, he wondered what it meant, and held himself in\r\nreadiness to follow his leader in case she should run away. But when the\r\nleader of the herd, usually the oldest cow, fell bleeding upon the\r\nground, and no other buffalo promptly assumed the leadership of the\r\nherd, instead of acting independently and fleeing from the alarm, he\r\nmerely did as he saw the others do, and waited his turn to be shot.\r\nLatterly, however, when the herds were totally broken up, when the few\r\nsurvivors were scattered in every direction, and it became a case of\r\nevery buffalo for himself, they became wild and wary, ever ready to\r\nstart off at the slightest alarm, and run indefinitely. Had they shown\r\nthe same wariness seventeen years ago that the survivors have manifested\r\nduring the last three or four years, there would now be a hundred\r\nthousand head alive instead of only about three hundred in a wild and\r\nunprotected state.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the merciless war that had been waged against the\r\nbuffalo for over a century by both whites and Indians, and the steady\r\ndecrease of its numbers, as well as its range, there were several\r\nmillion head on foot, not only up to the completion of the Union Pacific\r\nRailway, but as late as the year 1870. Up to that time the killing done\r\nby white men had been chiefly for the sake of meat, the demand for robes\r\nwas moderate, and the Indians took annually less than one hundred\r\nthousand for trading. Although half a million buffaloes were killed by\r\nIndians, half-breeds, and whites, the natural increase was so very\r\nconsiderable as to make it seem that the evil day of extermination was\r\nyet far distant.\r\n\r\nBut by a coincidence which was fatal to the buffalo, with the building\r\nof three lines of railway through the most populous buffalo country\r\nthere came a demand for robes and hides, backed up by an unlimited\r\nsupply of new and marvellously accurate breech-loading rifles and fixed\r\nammunition. And then followed a wild rush of hunters to the buffalo\r\ncountry, eager to destroy as many head as possible in the shortest time.\r\nFor those greedy ones the chase on horseback was \"too slow\" and too\r\nunfruitful. That was a retail method of killing, whereas they wanted to\r\nkill by wholesale. From their point of view, the still-hunt or \"sneak\"\r\nhunt was the method _par excellence_. If they could have obtained\r\nGatling guns with which to mow down a whole herd at a time, beyond a\r\ndoubt they would have gladly used them.\r\n\r\nThe still-hunt was seen at its very worst in the years 1871, 1872, and\r\n1873, on the southern buffalo range, and ten years later at its best in\r\nMontana, on the northern. Let us first consider it at its best, which in\r\nprinciple was bad enough.\r\n\r\nThe great rise in the price of robes which followed the blotting out of\r\nthe great southern herd at once put buffalo-hunting on a much more\r\ncomfortable and respectable business basis in the North than it had ever\r\noccupied in the South, where prices had all along been phenomenally low.\r\n\r\nIn Montana it was no uncommon thing for a hunter to invest from $1,000\r\nto $2,000 in his \"outfit\" of horses, wagons, weapons, ammunition,\r\nprovisions, and sundries.\r\n\r\nOne of the men who accompanied the Smithsonian Expedition for Buffalo,\r\nMr. James McNaney, of Miles City, Montana, was an ex-buffalo banter, who\r\nhad spent three seasons on the northern range, killing buffalo for their\r\nrobes, and his standing as a hunter was of the best. A brief description\r\nof his outfit and its work during its last season on the range\r\n(1882-'83) may fairly be taken as a typical illustration of the life and\r\nwork of the still-hunter at its best. The only thing against it was the\r\nextermination of the buffalo.\r\n\r\nDuring the winters of 1880 and 1881 Mr. McNaney had served in Maxwell's\r\noutfit as a hunter, working by the month, but his success in killing was\r\nsuch that he decided to work the third year on his own account. Although\r\nat that time only seventeen years of age, he took an elder brother as a\r\npartner, and purchased an outfit in Miles City, of which the following\r\nwere the principal items: Two wagons, 2 four-horse teams, 2\r\nsaddle-horses, 2 wall-tents, 1 cook-stove with pipe, 1 40-90 Sharp's\r\nrifle (breech-loading), 1 45-70 Sharps rifle (breech-loading), 1 45-120\r\nSharps rifle (breech-loading), 50 pounds gunpowder, 550 pounds lead,\r\n4,500 primers, 600 brass shells, 4 sheets patch-paper, 60 Wilson\r\nskinning knives, 3 butcher's steels, 1 portable grindstone, flour,\r\nbacon, baking-powder, coffee, sugar, molasses, dried apples, canned\r\nvegetables, beans, etc., in quantity.\r\n\r\nThe entire cost of the outfit was about $1,400. Two men were hired for\r\nthe season at $50 per month, and the party started from Miles City on\r\nNovember 10, which was considered a very late start. The usual time of\r\nsetting out for the range was about October 1.\r\n\r\nThe outfit went by rail northeastward to Terry, and from thence across\r\ncountry south and east about 100 miles, around the head of O'Fallon\r\nCreek to the head of Beaver Creek, a tributary of the Little Missouri. A\r\ngood range was selected, without encroachment upon the domains of the\r\nhunters already in the field, and the camp was made near the bank of the\r\ncreek, close to a supply of wood and water, and screened from distant\r\nobservation by a circle of hills and ridges. The two rectangular\r\nwall-tents were set up end to end, with the cook-stove in the middle,\r\nwhere the ends came together. In one tent the cooking and eating was\r\ndone, and the other contained the beds.\r\n\r\nIt was planned that the various members of the party should cook turn\r\nabout, a week at a time, but one of them soon developed such a rare and\r\nconspicuous talent for bread-making and general cookery that he was\r\nelected by acclamation to cook during the entire season. To the other\r\nthree members fell the hunting. Each man hunted separately from the\r\nothers, and skinned all the animals that his rifle brought down.\r\n\r\nThere were buffalo on the range when the hunters arrived, and the\r\nkilling began at once. At daylight the still-hunter sallied forth on\r\nfoot, carrying in his hand his huge Sharps rifle, weighing from 16 to 19\r\npounds, with from seventy-five to one hundred loaded cartridges in his\r\ntwo belts or his pockets. At his side, depending from his belt, hung his\r\n\"hunter's companion,\" a flat leather scabbard, containing a ripping\r\nknife, a skinning knife, and a butcher's steel upon which to sharpen\r\nthem. The total weight carried was very considerable, seldom less than\r\n36 pounds, and often more.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as it was highly important to move camp as seldom as possible\r\nin the course of a season's work, the hunter exercised the greatest\r\nprecaution in killing his game, and had ever before his mind the\r\nnecessity of doing his killing without frightening away the survivors.\r\n\r\nWith ten thousand buffaloes on their range, it was considered the height\r\nof good luck to find a \"bunch\" of fifty head in a secluded \"draw\" or\r\nhollow, where it was possible to \"make a kill\" without disturbing the\r\nbig herd.\r\n\r\nThe still-hunter usually went on foot, for when buffaloes became so\r\nscarce as to make it necessary for him to ride his occupation was\r\npractically gone. At the time I speak of, the hunter seldom had to walk\r\nmore than 3 miles from camp to find buffalo, in case there were any at\r\nall on his range, and it was usually an advantage to be without a horse.\r\nFrom the top of a ridge or high butte the country was carefully scanned,\r\nand if several small herds were in sight the one easiest to approach was\r\nselected as the one to attack. It was far better to find a herd lying\r\ndown or quietly grazing, or sheltering from a cold wind, than to find it\r\ntraveling, for while a hard run of a mile or two often enabled the\r\nhunter to \"head off\" a moving herd and kill a certain number of animals\r\nout of it, the net results were never half so satisfactory as with herds\r\nabsolutely at rest.\r\n\r\nHaving decided upon an attack, the hunter gets to leeward of his game,\r\nand approaches it according to the nature of the ground. If it is in a\r\nhollow, he secures a position at the top of the nearest ridge, as close\r\nas he can get. If it is in a level \"flat,\" he looks for a gully up which\r\nhe can skulk until within good rifle-shot. If there is no gully, he may\r\nbe obliged to crawl half a mile on his hands and knees, often through\r\nsnow or amongst beds of prickly pear, taking advantage of even such\r\nscanty cover as sage-brush affords. Some Montana still-hunters adopted\r\nthe method of drawing a gunny-sack over the entire upper half of the\r\nbody, with holes cut for the eyes and arms, which simple but\r\nunpicturesque arrangement often enabled the hunter to approach his\r\ngame much more easily and more closely than would otherwise have been\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STILL-HUNTING BUFFALOES ON THE NORTHERN RANGE.\r\nFrom a painting by J. H. Moser, in the National Museum.]\r\n\r\nHaving secured a position within from 100 to 250 yards of his game\r\n(often the distance was much greater), the hunter secures a comfortable\r\nrest for his huge rifle, all the time keeping his own person thoroughly\r\nhidden from view, estimates the distance, carefully adjusts his sights,\r\nand begins business. If the herd is moving, the animal in the lead is\r\nthe first one shot, close behind the fore leg and about a foot above the\r\nbrisket, which sends the ball through the lungs. If the herd is at rest,\r\nthe oldest cow is always supposed to be the leader, and she is the one\r\nto kill first. The noise startles the buffaloes, they stare at the\r\nlittle cloud of white smoke and feel inclined to run, but seeing their\r\nleader hesitate they wait for her. She, when struck, gives a violent\r\nstart forward, but soon stops, and the blood begins to run from her\r\nnostrils in two bright crimson streams. In a couple of minutes her body\r\nsways unsteadily, she staggers, tries hard to keep her feet, but soon\r\ngives a lurch sidewise and falls. Some of the other members of the herd\r\ncome around her and stare and sniff in wide-eyed wonder, and one of the\r\nmore wary starts to lead the herd away. But before she takes half a\r\ndozen steps \"bang!\" goes the hidden rifle again, and her leadership is\r\nended forever. Her fall only increases the bewilderment of the survivors\r\nover a proceeding which to them is strange and unaccountable, because\r\nthe danger is not visible. They cluster around the fallen ones, sniff at\r\nthe warm blood, bawl aloud in wonderment, and do everything but run\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the hunter is to not fire too rapidly, but to attend\r\nclosely to business, and every time a buffalo attempts to make off,\r\nshoot it down. One shot per minute was a moderate rate of firing, but\r\nunder pressure of circumstances two per minute could be discharged with\r\ndeliberate precision. With the most accurate hunting rifle ever made, a\r\n\"dead rest,\" and a large mark practically motionless, it was no wonder\r\nthat nearly every shot meant a dead buffalo. The vital spot on a buffalo\r\nwhich stands with its side to the hunter is about a foot in diameter,\r\nand on a full-grown bull is considerably more. Under such conditions as\r\nthe above, which was called getting \"a stand,\" the hunter nurses his\r\nvictims just as an angler plays a big fish with light tackle, and in the\r\nmost methodical manner murders them one by one, either until the last\r\none falls, his cartridges are all expended, or the stupid brutes come to\r\ntheir senses and run away. Occasionally the poor fellow was troubled by\r\nhaving his rifle get too hot to use, but if a snow-bank was at hand he\r\nwould thrust the weapon into it without ceremony to cool it off.\r\n\r\nA success in getting a stand meant the slaughter of a good-sized herd. A\r\nhunter whom I met in Montana, Mr. Harry Andrews, told me that he once\r\nfired one hundred and fifteen shots from one spot and killed sixty-three\r\nbuffalo in less than an hour. The highest number Mr. McNaney ever knew\r\nof being killed in one stand was ninety-one head, but Colonel Dodge\r\nonce counted one hundred and twelve carcasses of buffalo \"inside of a\r\nsemicircle of 200 yards radius, all of which were killed by one man from\r\nthe same spot, and in less than three-quarters of an hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"kill\" being completed, the hunter then addressed himself to the\r\ntask of skinning his victims. The northern hunters were seldom guilty of\r\nthe reckless carelessness and lack of enterprise in the treatment of\r\nrobes which at one time was so prominent a feature of work on the\r\nsouthern range. By the time white men began to hunt for robes on the\r\nnorthern range, buffalo were becoming comparatively scarce, and robes\r\nwere worth from $2 to $4 each. The fur-buyers had taught the hunters,\r\nwith the potent argument of hard cash, that a robe carefully and neatly\r\ntaken off, stretched, and kept reasonably free from blood and dirt, was\r\nworth more money in the market than one taken off in a slovenly manner,\r\nand contrary to the nicer demands of the trade. After 1880, buffalo on\r\nthe northern range were skinned with considerable care, and amongst the\r\nrobe-hunters not one was allowed to become a loss when it was possible\r\nto prevent it. Every full-sized cow robe was considered equal to $3.50\r\nin hard cash, and treated accordingly. The hunter, or skinner, always\r\nstretched every robe out on the ground to its fullest extent while it\r\nwas yet warm, and cut the initials of his employer in the thin\r\nsubcutaneous muscle which always adhered to the inside of the skin. A\r\nwarm skin is very elastic, and when stretched upon the ground the hair\r\nholds it in shape until it either dries or freezes, and so retains its\r\nfull size. On the northern range skins were so valuable that many a\r\ndispute arose between rival outfits over the ownership of a dead\r\nbuffalo, some of which produced serious results.\r\n\r\n2. _The chase on horseback or \"running buffalo.\"_--Next to the\r\nstill-hunt the method called \"running buffalo\" was the most fatal to the\r\nrace, and the one most universally practiced. To all hunters, save\r\ngreedy white men, the chase on horseback yielded spoil sufficient for\r\nevery need, and it also furnished sport of a superior kind--manly,\r\nexhilarating, and well spiced with danger. Even the horses shared the\r\nexcitement and eagerness of their riders.\r\n\r\nSo long as the weapons of the Indian consisted only of the bow and arrow\r\nand the spear, he was obliged to kill at close quarters or not at all.\r\nAnd even when fire-arms were first placed in his hands their caliber was\r\nso small, the charge so light, and the Indian himself so poor a marksman\r\nat long range, that his best course was still to gallop alongside the\r\nherd on his favorite \"buffalo horse\" and kill at the shortest possible\r\nrange. From all accounts, the Red River half-breeds, who hunted almost\r\nexclusively with fire-arms, never dreamed of the deadly still hunt, but\r\nalways killed their game by \"running\" it.\r\n\r\nIn former times even the white men of the plains did the most of their\r\nbuffalo hunting on horseback, using the largest-sized Colt's revolver,\r\nsometimes one in each hand, until the repeating-rifle made its\r\nappearance, which in a great measure displaced the revolver in running\r\nbuffalo. But about that time began the mad warfare for \"robes\" and\r\n\"hides,\" and the only fair and sportsmanlike method of hunting was\r\ndeclared too slow for the greedy buffalo-skinners.\r\n\r\nThen came the cold-blooded butchery of the still-hunt. From that time on\r\nthe buffalo as a game animal steadily lost caste. It soon came to be\r\nuniversally considered that there was no sport in hunting buffalo. True\r\nenough of still-hunting, where the hunter sneaks up and shoots them down\r\none by one at such long range the report of his big rifle does not even\r\nfrighten them away. So far as sportsmanlike fairness is concerned, that\r\nmethod was not one whit more elevated than killing game by poison.\r\n\r\nBat the chase on horseback was a different thing. Its successful\r\nprosecution demanded a good horse, a bold rider, a firm seat, and\r\nperfect familiarity with weapons. The excitement of it was intense, the\r\ndangers not to be despised, and, above all, the buffalo had a fair show\r\nfor his life, or partially so, at least. The mode of attack is easily\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nWhenever the hunters discovered a herd of buffalo, they usually got to\r\nleeward of it and quietly rode forward in a body, or stretched out in a\r\nregular skirmish line, behind the shelter of a knoll, perhaps, until\r\nthey had approached the herd as closely as could be done without\r\nalarming it. Usually the unsuspecting animals, with a confidence due\r\nmore to their great numbers than anything else, would allow a party of\r\nhorsemen to approach within from 200 to 400 yards of their flankers, and\r\nthen they would start off on a slow trot. The hunters then put spurs to\r\ntheir horses and dashed forward to overtake the herd as quickly as\r\npossible. Once up with it, each hunter chooses the best animal within\r\nhis reach, chases him until his flying steed carries him close\r\nalongside, and then the arrow or the bullet is sent into his vitals. The\r\nfatal spot is from 12 to 18 inches in circumference, and lies\r\nimmediately back of the fore leg, with its lowest point on a line with\r\nthe elbow.\r\n\r\nThis, the true chase of the buffalo, was not only exciting, but\r\ndangerous. It often happened that the hunter found himself surrounded by\r\nthe flying herd, and in a cloud of dust, so that neither man nor horse\r\ncould see the ground before them. Under such circumstances fatal\r\naccidents to both men and horses were numerous. It was not an uncommon\r\nthing for half-breeds to shoot each other in the excitement of the\r\nchase; and, while now and then a wounded bull suddenly turned upon his\r\npursuer and overthrew him, the greatest number of casualties were from\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\nOf the dangers involved in running buffalo Colonel Dodge writes as\r\nfollows:[52]\r\n\r\n[Note 52: Plains of the Great West, p. 127.]\r\n\r\n\"The danger is not so much from the buffalo, which rarely makes an\r\neffort to injure his pursuer, as from the fact that neither man nor\r\nhorse can see the ground, which may be rough and broken, or perforated\r\nwith prairie-dog or gopher holes. This danger is so imminent, that a man\r\nwho runs into a herd of buffalo may be said to take his life in his\r\nhand. I have never known a man hurt by a buffalo in such a chase. I have\r\nknown of at least six killed, and a very great many more or less\r\ninjured, some very severely, by their horses falling with them.\"\r\n\r\nOn this point Catlin declares that to engage in running buffalo is \"at\r\nthe hazard of every bone in one's body, to feel the fine and thrilling\r\nexhilaration of the chase for a moment, and then as often to upbraid and\r\nblame himself for his folly and imprudence.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to my first experience in \"running buffalo\" I had entertained a\r\nmortal dread of ever being called upon to ride a chase across a\r\nprairie-dog town. The mouth of a prairie-dog's burrow is amply large to\r\nreceive the hoof of a horse, and the angle at which the hole descends\r\ninto the earth makes it just right for the leg of a running horse to\r\nplunge into up to the knee and bring down both horse and rider\r\ninstantly; the former with a broken leg, to say the least of it. If the\r\nrider sits loosely, and promptly resigns his seat, he will go flying\r\nforward, as if thrown from a catapult, for 20 feet or so, perhaps to\r\nescape with a few broken bones, and perhaps to have his neck broken, or\r\nhis skull fractured on the hard earth. If he sticks tightly to his\r\nsaddle, his horse is almost certain to fall upon him, and perhaps kill\r\nhim. Judge, then, my feelings when the first bunch of buffalo we started\r\nheaded straight across the largest prairie-dog town I had ever seen up\r\nto that time. And not only was the ground honey-combed with gaping round\r\nholes, but it was also crossed here and there by treacherous ditch-like\r\ngullies, cut straight down into the earth to an uncertain depth, and so\r\nnarrow as to be invisible until it was almost time to leap across them.\r\n\r\nBut at such a time, with the game thundering along a few rods in\r\nadvance, the hunter thinks of little else except getting up to it. He\r\nlooks as far ahead as possible, and helps his horse to avoid dangers,\r\nbut to a great extent the horse must guide himself. The rider plies his\r\nspurs and looks eagerly forward, almost feverish with excitement and\r\neagerness, but at the same time if he is wise he _expects_ a fall, and\r\nholds himself in readiness to take the ground with as little damage as\r\nhe can.\r\n\r\nMr. Catlin gives a most graphic description of a hunting accident, which\r\nmay fairly be quoted in full as a type of many such. I must say that I\r\nfully sympathize with M. Chardon in his estimate of the hardness of the\r\nground he fell upon, for I have a painful recollection of a fall I had\r\nfrom which I arose with the settled conviction that the ground in\r\nMontana is the hardest in the world! It seemed more like falling upon\r\ncast-iron than prairie turf.\r\n\r\n\"I dashed along through the thundering mass as they swept away over the\r\nplain, scarcely able to tell whether I was on a buffalo's back or my\r\nhorse, hit and hooked and jostled about, till at length I found myself\r\nalongside my game, when I gave him a shot as I passed him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHASE ON HORSEBACK. From a painting in the National\r\nMuseum by George Catlin.]\r\n\r\nI saw guns flash about me in several directions, but I heard them\r\nnot. Amidst the trampling throng Mons. Chardon had wounded a stately\r\nbull, and at this moment was passing him with his piece leveled for\r\nanother shot. They were both at full speed and I also, within the\r\nreach of the muzzle of my gun, when the bull instantly turned,\r\nreceiving the horse upon his horns, and the ground received poor\r\nChardon, who made a frog's leap of some 20 feet or more over the\r\nbull's back and almost under my horse's heels. I wheeled my horse as\r\nsoon as possible and rode back where lay poor Chardon, gasping to\r\nstart his breath again, and within a few paces of him his huge\r\nvictim, with his heels high in the air, and the horse lying across\r\nhim. I dismounted instantly, but Chardon was raising himself on his\r\nhands, with his eyes and mouth full of dirt, and feeling for his gun,\r\nwhich lay about 30 feet in advance of him. 'Heaven spare you! are you\r\nhurt, Chardon?' 'Hi-hic--hic--hic--hic--no;--hic--no--no, I believe\r\nnot. Oh, this is not much, Mons. Cataline--this is nothing new--but\r\nthis is a d--d hard piece of ground here--hic--oh! hic!' At this the\r\npoor fellow fainted, but in a few moments arose, picked up his gun,\r\ntook his horse by the bit, which then opened _its_ eyes, and with a\r\n_hic_ and a ugh--_ughk!_--sprang upon its feet, shook off the dirt,\r\nand here we were, all upon our legs again, save the bull, whose fate\r\nhad been more sad than that of either.\"[53]\r\n\r\n[Note 53: North American Indians, I, pp. 25-26.]\r\n\r\nThe following passage from Mr. Alexander Ross's graphic description of a\r\ngreat hunt,[54] in which about four hundred hunters made an onslaught\r\nupon a herd, affords a good illustration of the dangers in running\r\nbuffalo:\r\n\r\n[Note 54: Red River Settlement, p. 256.]\r\n\r\n\"On this occasion the surface was rocky and full of badger-holes.\r\nTwenty-three horses and riders were at one moment all sprawling on the\r\nground; one horse, gored by a bull, was killed on the spot; two more\r\nwere disabled by the fall; one rider broke his shoulder-blade; another\r\nburst his gun and lost three of his fingers by the accident; and a third\r\nwas struck on the knee by an exhausted ball. These accidents will not be\r\nthought overnumerous, considering the result, for in the evening no less\r\nthan thirteen hundred and seventy-five tongues were brought into camp.\"\r\n\r\nIt really seems as if the horses of the plains entered willfully and\r\nknowingly into the war on the doomed herds. But for the willingness and\r\neven genuine eagerness with which the \"buffalo horses\" of both white men\r\nand Indians entered into the chase, hunting on horseback would have been\r\nattended with almost insurmountable difficulties, and the results would\r\nhave been much less fatal to the species. According to all accounts the\r\nhorses of the Indians and half-breeds were far better trained than those\r\nof their white rivals, no doubt owing to the fact that the use of the\r\nbow, which required the free use of both hands, was only possible when\r\nthe horse took the right coarse of his own free will or else could be\r\nguided by the pressure of the knees. If we may believe the historians of\r\nthat period, and there is not the slightest reason to doubt them, the\r\n\"buffalo horses\" of the Indians displayed almost as much intelligence\r\nand eagerness in the chase as did their human riders. Indeed, in\r\n\"running buffalo\" with only the bow and arrow, nothing but the willing\r\nco-operation of the horse could have possibly made this mode of hunting\r\neither satisfactory or successful.\r\n\r\nIn Lewis and Clarke's Travels, volume II, page 387, appears the\r\nfollowing record:\r\n\r\n\"He [Sergeant Pryor] had found it almost impossible with two men to\r\ndrive on the remaining horses, for as soon as they discovered a herd of\r\nbuffaloes the loose horses immediately set off in pursuit of them, and\r\nsurrounded the buffalo herd with almost as much skill as their riders\r\ncould have done. At last he was obliged to send one horseman forward and\r\ndrive all the buffaloes from the route.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. H. H. Sibley, who once accompanied the Red River half-breeds on\r\ntheir annual hunt, relates the following[55]:\r\n\r\n\"One of the hunters fell from his saddle, and was unable to overtake his\r\nhorse, which continued the chase as if he of himself could accomplish\r\ngreat things, so much do these animals become imbued with a passion for\r\nthis sport! On another occasion a half-breed left his favorite steed at\r\nthe camp, to enable him to recruit his strength, enjoining upon his wife\r\nthe necessity of properly securing the animal, which was not done. Not\r\nrelishing the idea of being left behind, he started after us and soon\r\nwas alongside, and thus he continued to keep pace with the hunters in\r\ntheir pursuit of the buffalo, seeming to await with impatience the fall\r\nof some of them to the earth. The chase ended, he came neighing to his\r\nmaster, whom he soon singled out, although the men were dispersed here\r\nand there for a distance of miles.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 55: Schoolcraft's \"North American Indians,\" 108.]\r\n\r\nCol. R. I. Dodge, in his Plains of the Great West, page 129, describes a\r\nmeeting with two Mexican buffalo-hunters whose horses were so fleet and\r\nso well trained that whenever a herd of buffalo came in sight, instead\r\nof shooting their game wherever they came up with it, the one having the\r\nbest horse would dash into the herd, cut out a fat two-year old, and,\r\nwith the help of his partner, then actually drive it to their camp\r\nbefore shooting it down. \"They had a fine lot of meat and a goodly pile\r\nof skins, and they said that every buffalo had been driven into camp and\r\nkilled as the one I saw. 'It saves a heap of trouble packing the meat to\r\ncamp,' said one of them, naively.\"\r\n\r\nProbably never before in the history of the world, until civilized man\r\ncame in contact with the buffalo, did whole armies of men march out in\r\ntrue military style, with officers, flags, chaplains, and rules of war,\r\nand make war on wild animals. No wonder the buffalo has been\r\nexterminated. So long as they existed north of the Missouri in any\r\nconsiderable number, the half-breeds and Indians of the Manitoba Red\r\nRiver settlement used to gather each year in a great army, and go with\r\ncarts to the buffalo range. On these great hunts, which took place every\r\nyear from about the 15th of June to the 1st of September, vast numbers\r\nof buffalo were killed, and the supply was finally exhausted. As if\r\nHeaven had decreed the extirpation of the species, the half-breed\r\nhunters, like their white robe-hunting rivals farther south, always\r\nkilled _cows_ in preference to bulls so long as a choice was possible,\r\nthe very course best calculated to exterminate any species in the\r\nshortest possible time.\r\n\r\nThe army of half-breeds and Indians which annually went forth from the\r\nRed River settlement to make war on the buffalo was often far larger\r\nthan the army with which Cortez subdued a great empire. As early as 1846\r\nit had become so great, that it was necessary to divide it into two\r\ndivisions, one of which, the White Horse Plain division, was accustomed\r\nto go west by the Assinniboine River to the \"rapids crossing-place,\" and\r\nfrom there in a southwesterly direction. The Red River division went\r\nsouth to Pembina, and did the most of their hunting in Dakota. The two\r\ndivisions sometimes met (says Professor Hind), but not intentionally. In\r\n1849 a Mr. Flett took a census of the White Horse Plain division, in\r\nDakota Territory, and found that it contained 603 carts, 700\r\nhalf-breeds, 200 Indians, 600 horses, 200 oxen, 400 dogs, and 1 cat.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Red River Settlement\" Mr. Alexander Ross gives the following\r\ncensus of the number of carts assembled in camp for the buffalo hunt at\r\nfive different-periods:\r\n\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|_Number of carts assembled|\r\n|   for the first trip._   |\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|In 1820      |         540|\r\n|In 1825      |         680|\r\n|In 1830      |         820|\r\n|In 1835      |         970|\r\n|In 1840      |       1,210|\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe expedition which was accompanied by Rev. Mr. Belcourt, a Catholic\r\npriest, whose account is set forth in the Hon. Mr. Sibley's paper on the\r\nbuffalo,[56] was a comparatively small one, which started from Pembina,\r\nand very generously took pains not to spoil the prospects of the great\r\nRed River division, which was expected to take the field at the same\r\ntime. This, therefore, was a small party, like others which had already\r\nreached the range; but it contained 213 carts, 55 hunters and their\r\nfamilies, making 60 lodges in all. This party killed 1,776 cows (bulls\r\nnot counted, many of which were killed, though \"not even a tongue was\r\ntaken\"), which yielded 228 bags of pemmican, 1,213 bales of dried meat,\r\n166 sacks of tallow, and 556 bladders full of marrow. But this was very\r\nmoderate slaughter, being about 33 buffalo to each family. Even as late\r\nas 1872, when buffalo were getting scarce, Mr. Grant[57] met a\r\nhalf-breed family on the Qu'Appelle, consisting of man, wife, and seven\r\nchildren, whose six carts were laden with the meat and robes yielded by\r\n_sixty_ buffaloes; that number representing this one hunter's share of\r\nthe spoils of the hunt.\r\n\r\n[Note 56: Schoolcraft, pp. 101-110.]\r\n\r\n[Note 57: Ocean to Ocean, p. 116.]\r\n\r\nTo afford an idea of the truly military character of those Red River\r\nexpeditions, I have only to quote a page from Prof. Henry Youle\r\nHind:[58]\r\n\r\n[Note 58: Assinniboine and Saskatch. Exp. Exped., II, p. 111.]\r\n\r\n\"After the start from the settlement has been well made, and all\r\nstragglers or tardy hunters have arrived, a great council is held and a\r\npresident elected. A number of captains are nominated by the president\r\nand people jointly. The captains then proceed to appoint their own\r\npolicemen, the number assigned to each not exceeding ten. Their duties\r\nare to see that the laws of the hunt are strictly carried out. In 1840,\r\nif a man ran a buffalo without permission before the general hunt began,\r\nhis saddle and bridle were cut to pieces for the first offense; for the\r\nsecond offense his clothes were cut off his back. At the present day\r\nthese punishments are changed to a fine of 20 shillings for the first\r\noffense. No gun is permitted to be fired when in the buffalo country\r\nbefore the 'race' begins. A priest sometimes goes with the hunt, and\r\nmass is then celebrated in the open prairies.\r\n\r\n\"At night the carts are placed in the form of a circle, with the horses\r\nand cattle inside the ring, and it is the duty of the captains and their\r\npolicemen to see that this is rightly done. All laws are proclaimed in\r\ncamp, and relate to the hunt alone. All camping orders are given by\r\nsignal, a flag being carried by the guides, who are appointed by\r\nelection. Each guide has his tarn of one day, and no man can pass a\r\nguide on duty without subjecting himself to a fine of 5 shillings. No\r\nhunter can leave the camp to return home without permission, and no one\r\nis permitted to stir until any animal or property of value supposed to\r\nbe lost is recovered. The policemen, at the order of their captains, can\r\nseize any cart at night-fall and place it where they choose for the\r\npublic safety, but on the following morning they are compelled to bring\r\nit back to the spot from which they moved it the previous evening. This\r\npower is very necessary, in order that the horses may not be stampeded\r\nby night attacks of the Sioux or other Indian tribes at war with the\r\nhalf-breeds. A heavy fine is imposed in case of neglect in extinguishing\r\nfires when the camp is broken up in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"In sight of buffalo all the hunters are drawn up in line, the\r\npresident, captains, and police being a few yards in advance,\r\nrestraining the impatient hunters. 'Not yet! Not yet!' is the subdued\r\nwhisper of the president. The approach to the herd is cautiously made.\r\n'Now!' the president exclaims; and as the word leaves his lips the\r\ncharge is made, and in a few minutes the excited half-breeds are amongst\r\nthe bewildered buffalo.\"\r\n\r\n\"After witnessing one buffalo hunt,\" says Prof. John Macoun, \"I can not\r\nblame the half-breed and the Indian for leaving the farm and wildly\r\nmaking for the plains when it is reported that buffalo have crossed the\r\nborder.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"great fall hunt\" was a regular event with about all the Indian\r\ntribes living within striking distance of the buffalo, in the course of\r\nwhich great numbers of buffalo were killed, great quantities of meat\r\ndried and made into pemmican, and all the skins taken were tanned in\r\nvarious ways to suit the many purposes they were called upon to serve.\r\n\r\nMr. Francis La Flesche informs me that during the presence of the\r\nbuffalo in western Nebraska and until they were driven south by the\r\nSioux, the fall hunt of the Omahas was sometimes participated in by\r\nthree hundred lodges, or about 3,000 people all told, six hundred of\r\nwhom were warriors, and each of whom generally killed about ten\r\nbuffaloes. The laws of the hunt were very strict and inexorable. In\r\norder that all participants should have an equal chance, it was decreed\r\nthat any hunter caught \"still-hunting\" should be soundly flogged. On one\r\noccasion an Indian was discovered in the act, but not caught. During the\r\nchase which was made to capture him many arrows were fired at him by the\r\npolice, but being better mounted than his pursuers he escaped, and kept\r\nclear of the camp during the remainder of the hunt. On another occasion\r\nan Omaha, guilty of the same offense, was chased, and in his effort to\r\nescape his horse fell with him in a coulée and broke one of his legs. In\r\nspite of the sad plight of the Omaha, his pursuers came up and flogged\r\nhim, just as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nAfter the invention of the Colt's revolver, and breech-loading rifles\r\ngenerally, the chase on horseback speedily became more fatal to the\r\nbison than it ever had been before. With such weapons, it was possible\r\nto gallop into the midst of a flying herd and, during the course of a\r\nrun of 2 or 3 miles, discharge from twelve to forty shots at a range of\r\nonly a few yards, or even a few feet. In this kind of hunting the heavy\r\nNavy revolver was the favorite weapon, because it could be held in one\r\nhand and fired with far greater precision than could a rifle held in\r\nboth hands. Except in the hands of an expert, the use of the rifle was\r\nlimited, and often attended with risk to the hunter; but the revolver\r\nwas good for all directions; it could very often be used with deadly\r\neffect where a rifle could not have been used at all, and, moreover, it\r\nleft the bridle-hand free. Many cavalrymen and hunters were able to use\r\na revolver with either hand, or one in each hand. Gen. Lew. Wallace\r\npreferred the Smith and Wesson in 1867, which he declared to be \"the\r\nbest of revolvers\" then.\r\n\r\nIt was his marvelous skill in shooting buffaloes with a rifle, from the\r\nback of a galloping horse, that earned for the Hon. W. F. Cody the\r\nsobriquet by which he is now familiarly known to the world--\"Buffalo\r\nBill.\" To the average hunter on horseback the galloping of the horse\r\nmakes it easy for him to aim at the heart of a buffalo and shoot clear\r\nover its back. No other shooting is so difficult, or requires such\r\nconsummate dexterity as shooting with any kind of a gun, especially a\r\nrifle, from the back of a running horse. Let him who doubts this\r\nstatement try it for himself and he will doubt no more. It was in the\r\nchase of the buffalo on horseback, armed with a rifle, that \"Buffalo\r\nBill\" acquired the marvelous dexterity with the rifle which he has since\r\nexhibited in the presence of the people of two continents. I regret that\r\ncircumstances have prevented my obtaining the exact figures of the great\r\nkill of buffaloes that Mr. Cody once made in a single run, in which he\r\nbroke all previous records in that line, and fairly earned his title. In\r\n1867 he entered into a contract with the Kansas Pacific Railway, then in\r\ncourse of construction through western Kansas, at a monthly salary of\r\n$500, to deliver all the buffalo meat that would be required by the army\r\nof laborers engaged in building the road. In eighteen mouths he killed\r\n4,280 buffaloes.\r\n\r\n3. _Impounding or Killing in Pens._--At first thought it seems hard to\r\nbelieve that it was ever possible for Indians to build pens and drive\r\nwild buffaloes into them, as cowboys now corral their cattle, yet such\r\nwholesale catches were of common occurrence among the Plains Crees of\r\nthe south Saskatchewan country, and the same general plan was pursued,\r\nwith slight modifications, by the Indians of the Assinniboine,\r\nBlackfeet, and Gros Ventres, and other tribes of the Northwest. Like the\r\nkeddah elephant-catching operations in India, this plan was feasible\r\nonly in a partially wooded country, and where buffalo were so numerous\r\nthat their presence could be counted upon to a certainty. The \"pound\"\r\nwas simply a circular pen, having a single entrance; but being unable to\r\nconstruct a gate of heavy timbers, such as is made to drop and close the\r\nentrance to an elephant pen, the Indians very shrewdly got over the\r\ndifficulty by making the opening at the edge of a perpendicular bank 10\r\nor 12 feet high, easy enough for a buffalo to jump down, but impossible\r\nfor him to scale afterward. It is hardly probable that Indians who were\r\nexpert enough to attack and kill buffalo on foot would have been tempted\r\nto undertake the labor that building a pound always involved, had it not\r\nbeen for the wild excitement attending captures made in this way, and\r\nwhich were shared to the fullest possible extent by warriors, women, and\r\nchildren alike.\r\n\r\nThe best description of this method which has come under our notice is\r\nthat of Professor Hind, who witnessed its practice by the Plains Crees,\r\non the headwaters of the Qu'Appelle River, in 1858. He describes the\r\npound he saw as a fence, constructed of the trunks of trees laced\r\ntogether with green withes, and braced on the outside by props,\r\ninclosing a circular space about 120 feet in diameter. It was placed in\r\na pretty dell between sand-hills, and leading from it in two diverging\r\nrows (like the guiding wings of an elephant pen) were the two rows of\r\nbushes which the Indians designate \"dead men,\" which serve to guide the\r\nbuffalo into the pound. The \"dead men\" extended a distance of 4 miles\r\ninto the prairie. They were placed about 50 feet apart, and the two\r\nrows gradually diverged until at their extremities they were from 11/2\r\nto 2 miles apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CREE INDIANS IMPOUNDING BUFFALOES. Reproduced from Prof.\r\nH. Y. Hind's--\"Red River, Assinniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition.\"]\r\n\r\n\"When the skilled hunters are about to bring in a herd of buffalo from\r\nthe prairie,\" says Professor Hind, \"they direct the course of the gallop\r\nof the alarmed animals by confederates stationed in hollows or small\r\ndepressions, who, when the buffalo appear inclined to take a direction\r\nleading from the space marked out by the 'dead men,' show themselves for\r\na moment and wave their robes, immediately hiding again. This serves to\r\nturn the buffalo slightly in another direction, and when the animals,\r\nhaving arrived between the rows of 'dead men,' endeavor to pass through\r\nthem, Indians stationed here and there behind a 'dead man' go through\r\nthe same operation, and thus keep the animals within the narrowing\r\nlimits of the converging lines. At the entrance to the pound there is a\r\nstrong trunk of a tree placed about a foot from the ground, and on the\r\ninner side an excavation is made sufficiently deep to prevent the\r\nbuffalo from leaping back when once in the pound. As soon as the animals\r\nhave taken the fatal spring, they begin to gallop round and round the\r\nring fence, looking for a chance to escape, but with the utmost silence\r\nwomen and children on the outside hold their robes before every orifice\r\nuntil the whole herd is brought in; then they climb to the top of the\r\nfence, and, with the hunters who have followed closely in the rear of\r\nthe buffalo, spear or shoot with bows and arrows or fire-arms at the\r\nbewildered animals, rapidly becoming frantic with rage and terror,\r\nwithin the narrow limits of the pound.\r\n\r\n\"A dreadful scene of confusion and slaughter then begins; the oldest and\r\nstrongest animals crush and toss the weaker; the shouts and screams of\r\nthe excited Indians rise above the roaring of the bulls, the bellowing\r\nof the cows, and the piteous moaning of the calves. The dying struggles\r\nof so many huge and powerful animals crowded together create a revolting\r\nand terrible scene, dreadful from the excess of its cruelty and waste of\r\nlife, but with occasional displays of wonderful brute strength and rage;\r\nwhile man in his savage, untutored, and heathen state shows both in deed\r\nand expression how little he is superior to the noble beasts he so\r\nwantonly and cruelly destroys.\"[59]\r\n\r\n[Note 59: Assinniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition, p. 358.]\r\n\r\nThe last scene of the bloody tragedy is thus set forth a week later:\r\n\r\n\"Within the circular fence ... lay, tossed in every conceivable\r\nposition, over two hundred dead buffalo. [The exact number was 240.]\r\nFrom old bulls to calves of three months' old, animals of every age were\r\nhuddled together in all the forced attitudes of violent death. Some lay\r\non their backs, with eyes starting from their heads and tongue thrust\r\nout through clotted gore. Others were impaled on the horns of the old\r\nand strong bulls. Others again, which had been tossed, were lying with\r\nbroken backs, two and three deep. One little calf hung suspended on the\r\nhorns of a bull which had impaled it in the wild race round and round\r\nthe pound. The Indians looked upon the dreadful and sickening sight\r\nwith evident delight, and told how such and such a bull or cow had\r\nexhibited feats of wonderful strength in the death-struggle. The flesh\r\nof many of the cows had been taken from them, and was drying in the sun\r\non stages near the tents. It is needless to say that the odor was\r\noverpowering, and millions of large blue flesh-flies, humming and\r\nbuzzing over the putrefying bodies, was not the least disgusting part of\r\nthe spectacle.\"\r\n\r\nIt is some satisfaction to know that when the first \"run\" was made, ten\r\ndays previous, the herd of two hundred buffaloes was no sooner driven\r\ninto the pound than a wary old bull espied a weak spot in the fence,\r\ncharged it at full speed, and burst through to freedom and the prairie,\r\nfollowed by the entire herd.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem to-day, this wholesale method of destroying\r\nbuffalo was once practiced in Montana. In his memoir on \"The American\r\nBison,\" Mr. J. A. Allen states that as late as 1873, while journeying\r\nthrough that Territory in charge of the Yellowstone Expedition, he\r\n\"several times met with the remains of these pounds and their converging\r\nfences in the region above the mouth of the Big Horn River.\" Mr. Thomas\r\nSimpson states that in 1840 there were three camps of Assinniboine\r\nIndians in the vicinity of Carlton House, each of which had its buffalo\r\npound into which they drove forty or fifty animals daily.\r\n\r\n4. _The \"Surround.\"_--During the last forty years the final\r\nextermination of the buffalo has been confidently predicted by not only\r\nthe observing white man of the West, but also nearly all the Indians and\r\nhalf-breeds who formerly depended upon this animal for the most of the\r\nnecessities, as well as luxuries, of life. They have seen the great\r\nherds driven westward farther and farther, until the plains were left\r\ntenantless, and hunger took the place of feasting on the choice tid-bits\r\nof the chase. And is it not singular that during this period the Indian\r\ntribes were not moved by a common impulse to kill sparingly, and by the\r\nexercise of a reasonable economy in the chase to make the buffalo last\r\nas long as possible.\r\n\r\nBut apparently no such thoughts ever entered their minds, so far as\r\n_they themselves_ were concerned. They looked with jealous eyes upon the\r\nwhite hunter, and considered him as much of a robber as if they had a\r\nbrand on every buffalo. It has been claimed by some authors that the\r\nIndians killed with more judgment and more care for the future than did\r\nthe white man, but I fail to find any evidence that such was ever the\r\nfact. They all killed wastefully, wantonly, and always about five times\r\nas many head as were really necessary for food. It was always the same\r\nold story, whenever a gang of Indians needed meat a whole herd was\r\nslaughtered, the choicest portions of the finest animals were taken, and\r\nabout 75 per cent of the whole left to putrefy and fatten the wolves.\r\nAnd now, as we read of the appalling slaughter, one can scarcely repress\r\nthe feeling of grim satisfaction that arises when we also read that many\r\nof the ex-slaughterers are almost starving for the millions of pounds\r\nof fat and juicy buffalo meat they wasted a few years ago. Verily, the\r\nbuffalo is in a great measure avenged already.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from Mr. Catlin's \"North American Indians,\"[60] I,\r\npage 199-200, serves well to illustrate not only a very common and very\r\ndeadly Indian method of wholesale slaughter--the \"surround\"--but also\r\nto show the senseless destructiveness of Indians even when in a state of\r\nsemi-starvation, which was brought upon them by similar acts of\r\nimprovidence and wastefulness.\r\n\r\n[Note 60: H. Mis. 600, pt. 2-31]\r\n\r\n\"The Minatarees, as well as the Mandans, had suffered for some months\r\npast for want of meat, and had indulged in the most alarming fears that\r\nthe herds of buffalo were emigrating so far off from them that there was\r\ngreat danger of their actual starvation, when it was suddenly announced\r\nthrough the village one morning at an early hour that a herd of\r\nbuffaloes was in sight. A hundred or more young men mounted their\r\nhorses, with weapons in hand, and steered their course to the prairies.\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\"The plan of attack, which in this country is familiarly called a\r\nsurround, was explicitly agreed upon, and the hunters, who were all\r\nmounted on their 'buffalo horses' and armed with bows and arrows or long\r\nlances, divided into two columns, taking opposite directions, and drew\r\nthemselves gradually around the herd at a mile or more distance from\r\nthem, thus forming a circle of horsemen at equal distances apart, who\r\ngradually closed in upon them with a moderate pace at a signal given.\r\nThe unsuspecting herd at length 'got the wind' of the approaching enemy\r\nand fled in a mass in the greatest confusion. To the point where they\r\nwere aiming to cross the line the horsemen were seen, at full speed,\r\ngathering and forming in a column, brandishing their weapons, and\r\nyelling in the most frightful manner, by which they turned the black and\r\nrushing mass, which moved off in an opposite direction, where they were\r\nagain met and foiled in a similar manner, and wheeled back in utter\r\nconfusion; by which time the horsemen had closed in from all directions,\r\nforming a continuous line around them, whilst the poor affrighted\r\nanimals were eddying about in a crowded and confused mass, hooking and\r\nclimbing upon each other, when the work of death commenced. I had rode\r\nup in the rear and occupied an elevated position at a few rods'\r\ndistance, from which I could (like the general of a battlefield) survey\r\nfrom my horse's back the nature and the progress of the grand _mêlée_,\r\nbut (unlike him) without the power of issuing a command or in any way\r\ndirecting its issue.\r\n\r\n\"In this grand turmoil [see illustration] a cloud of dust was soon\r\nraised, which in parts obscured the throng where the hunters were\r\ngalloping their horses around and driving the whizzing arrows or their\r\nlong lances to the hearts of these noble animals; which in many\r\ninstances, becoming infuriated with deadly wounds in their sides,\r\nerected their shaggy manes over their bloodshot eyes and furiously\r\nplunged forward at the sides of their assailants' horses, sometimes\r\ngoring them to death at a lunge and putting their dismounted riders to\r\nflight for their lives. Sometimes their dense crowd was opened, and the\r\nblinded horsemen, too intent on their prey amidst the cloud of dust,\r\nwere hemmed and wedged in amidst the crowding beasts, over whose backs\r\nthey were obliged to leap for security, leaving their horses to the fate\r\nthat might await them in the results of this wild and desperate war.\r\nMany were the bulls that turned upon their assailants and met them with\r\ndesperate resistance, and many were the warriors who were dismounted and\r\nsaved themselves by the superior muscles of their legs; some who were\r\nclosely pursued by the bulls wheeled suddenly around, and snatching the\r\npart of a buffalo robe from around their waists, threw it over the horns\r\nand eyes of the infuriated beast, and darting by its side drove the\r\narrow or the lance to its heart; others suddenly dashed off upon the\r\nprairie by the side of the affrighted animals which had escaped from the\r\nthrong, and closely escorting them for a few rods, brought down their\r\nheart's blood in streams and their huge carcasses upon the green and\r\nenameled turf.\r\n\r\n\"In this way this grand hunt soon resolved itself into a desperate\r\nbattle, _and in the space of fifteen minutes resulted in the total\r\ndestruction of the whole herd_, which in all their strength and fury\r\nwere doomed, like every beast and living thing else, to fall before the\r\ndestroying hands of mighty man.\r\n\r\n\"I had sat in trembling silence upon my horse and witnessed this\r\nextraordinary scene, which allowed not one of these animals to escape\r\nout of my sight. Many plunged off upon the prairie for a distance, but\r\nwere overtaken and killed, and although I could not distinctly estimate\r\nthe number that were slain, yet I am sure that some hundreds of these\r\nnoble animals fell in this grand _mêlée_. * * * Amongst the poor\r\naffrighted creatures that had occasionally dashed through the ranks of\r\ntheir enemy and sought safety in flight upon the prairie (and in some\r\ninstances had undoubtedly gained it), I saw them stand awhile, looking\r\nback, when they turned, and, as if bent on their own destruction,\r\nretraced their steps, and mingled themselves and their deaths with those\r\nof the dying throng. Others had fled to a distance on the prairies, and\r\nfor want of company, of friends or of foes, had stood and gazed on till\r\nthe battle-scene was over, seemingly taking pains to stay and hold their\r\nlives in readiness for their destroyers until the general destruction\r\nwas over, when they fell easy victims to their weapons, making the\r\nslaughter complete.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be noticed that _every animal_ of this entire herd of several\r\nhundred was slain on the spot, and there is no room to doubt that at\r\nleast half (possibly much more) of the meat thus taken was allowed to\r\nbecome a loss. People who are so utterly senseless as to wantonly\r\ndestroy their own source of food, as the Indians have done, certainly\r\ndeserve to starve.\r\n\r\nThis \"surround\" method of wholesale slaughter was also practiced by\r\nthe Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Sioux, Pawnees, Ornabas, and probably many\r\nother tribes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SURROUND. From a painting in the National Museum by\r\nGeorge Catlin.]\r\n\r\n5. _Decoying and Driving._--Another method of slaughtering by wholesale\r\nis thus described by Lewis and Clarke, I, 235. The locality indicated\r\nwas the Missouri River, in Montana, just above the mouth of Judith\r\nRiver:\r\n\r\n\"On the north we passed a precipice about 120 feet high, under which lay\r\nscattered the fragments of at least one hundred carcasses of buffaloes,\r\nalthough the water which had washed away the lower part of the hill,\r\nmust have carried off many of the dead. These buffaloes had been chased\r\ndown a precipice in a way very common on the Missouri, and by which vast\r\nherds are destroyed in a moment. The mode of hunting is to select one of\r\nthe most active and fleet young men, who is disguised by a buffalo skin\r\nround his body; the skin of the head with the ears and horns fastened on\r\nhis own head in such a way as to deceive the buffaloes. Thus dressed, he\r\nfixes himself at a convenient distance between a herd of buffaloes and\r\nany of the river precipices, which sometimes extend for some miles.\r\n\r\n\"His companions in the mean time get in the rear and side of the herd,\r\nand at a given signal show themselves, and advance towards the\r\nbuffaloes. They instantly take alarm, and, finding the hunters beside\r\nthem, they run toward the disguised Indian or decoy, who leads them on\r\nat full speed toward the river, when, suddenly securing himself in some\r\ncrevice of the cliff which he had previously fixed on, the herd is left\r\non the brink of the precipice; it is then in vain for the foremost to\r\nretreat or even to stop; they are pressed on by the hindmost rank, who,\r\nseeing no danger but from the hunters, goad on those before them till\r\nthe whole are precipitated and the shore is strewed with their dead\r\nbodies. Sometimes in this perilous seduction the Indian is himself\r\neither trodden under foot by the rapid movements of the buffaloes, or,\r\nmissing his footing in the cliff, is urged down the precipice by the\r\nfalling herd. The Indians then select as much meat as they wish, and the\r\nrest is abandoned to the wolves, and creates a most dreadful stench.\"\r\n\r\nHarper's Magazine, volume 38, page 147, contains the following from the\r\npen of Theo. E. Davis, in an article entitled \"The Buffalo Range:\"\r\n\r\n\"As I have previously stated, the best hunting on the range is to be\r\nfound between the Platte and Arkansas Rivers. Here I have seen the\r\nIndians have recourse to another method of slaughtering buffalo in a\r\nvery easy, but to me a cruel way, for where one buffalo is killed\r\nseveral are sure to be painfully injured; but these, too, are soon\r\nkilled by the Indians, who make haste to lance or shoot the cripples.\r\n\r\n\"The mode of hunting is somewhat as follows: A herd is discovered\r\ngrazing on the table-lands. Being thoroughly acquainted with the\r\ncountry, the Indians are aware of the location of the nearest point\r\nwhere the table land is broken abruptly by a precipice which descends a\r\nhundred or more feet. Toward this 'devil-jump' the Indians head the\r\nherd, which is at once driven pell mell to and over the precipice.\r\nMeanwhile a number of Indians have taken their way by means of routes\r\nknown to them, and succeed in reaching the cañon through which the\r\ncrippled buffalo are running in all directions. These are quickly\r\nkilled, so that out of a very considerable band of buffalo but few\r\nescape, many having been killed by the fall and others dispatched while\r\nlimping off. This mode of hunting is sometimes indulged in by\r\nharum-scarum white men, but it is done more for deviltry than anything\r\nelse. I have never known of its practice by army officers or persons who\r\nprofessed to hunt buffalo as a sport.\"\r\n\r\n6. _Hunting on Snow-shoes._--\"In the dead of the winters,\" says Mr.\r\nCatlin,[61] \"which are very long and severely cold in this country,\r\nwhere horses can not be brought into the chase with any avail, the\r\nIndian runs upon the surface of the snow by aid of his snow-shoes, which\r\nbuoy him up, while the great weight of the buffaloes sinks them down to\r\nthe middle of their sides, and, completely stopping their progress,\r\ninsures them certain and easy victims to the bow or lance of their\r\npursuers. The snow in these regions often lies during the winter to the\r\ndepth of 3 and 4 feet, being blown away from the tops and sides of the\r\nhills in many places, which are left bare for the buffaloes to graze\r\nupon, whilst it is drifted in the hollows and ravines to a very great\r\ndepth, and rendered almost entirely impassable to these huge animals,\r\nwhich, when closely pursued by their enemies, endeavor to plunge through\r\nit, but are soon wedged in and almost unable to move, where they fall an\r\neasy prey to the Indian, who runs up lightly upon his snow-shoes and\r\ndrives his lance to their hearts. The skins are then stripped off, to be\r\nsold to the fur traders, and the carcasses left to be devoured by the\r\nwolves. [Owing to the fact that the winter's supply of meat was procured\r\nand dried in the summer and fall months, the flesh of all buffalo killed\r\nin winter was allowed to become a total loss.] This is the season in\r\nwhich the greatest number of these animals are destroyed for their\r\nrobes; they are most easily killed at this time, and their hair or fur,\r\nbeing longer and more abundant, gives greater value to the robe.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 61: North American Indians, I, 253.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. PROGRESS OF THE EXTERMINATION.\r\n\r\nA. THE PERIOD OF DESULTORY DESTRUCTION, FROM 1730 TO 1830.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIANS ON SNOW-SHOES HUNTING BUFFALOES.\r\nFrom a painting in the National Museum by George Catlin.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of the buffalo from all the country east of the\r\nMississippi was one of the inevitable results of the advance of\r\ncivilization. To the early pioneers who went forth into the wilderness\r\nto wrestle with nature for the necessities of life, this valuable animal\r\nmight well have seemed a gift direct from the hand of Providence. During\r\nthe first few years of the early settler's life in a new country, the\r\nfew domestic animals he had brought with him were far too valuable to\r\nbe killed for food, and for a long period he looked to the wild animals\r\nof the forest and the prairie for his daily supply of meat. The time was\r\nwhen no one stopped to think of the important part our game animals\r\nplayed in the settlement of this country, and even now no one has\r\nattempted to calculate the lessened degree of rapidity with which the\r\nstar of empire would have taken its westward way without the bison,\r\ndeer, elk, and antelope. The Western States and Territories pay little\r\nheed to the wanton slaughter of deer and elk now going on in their\r\nforests, but the time will soon come when the \"grangers\" will enter\r\nthose regions and find the absence of game a very serious matter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the bison was the first wild species to disappear before the\r\nadvance of civilization, he served a good purpose at a highly critical\r\nperiod. His huge bulk of toothsome flesh fed many a hungry family, and\r\nhis ample robe did good service in the settler's cabin and sleigh in\r\nwinter weather. By the time game animals had become scarce, domestic\r\nherds and flocks had taken their place, and hunting became a pastime\r\ninstead of a necessity.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, from the time the bison was first seen by white\r\nmen he has always been a conspicuous prize, and being the largest of the\r\nland quadrupeds, was naturally the first to disappear. Every man's hand\r\nhas been against him. While his disappearance from the eastern United\r\nStates was, in the main, due to the settler who killed game as a means\r\nof subsistence, there were a few who made the killing of those animals a\r\nregular business. This occurred almost exclusively in the immediate\r\nvicinity of salt springs, around which the bison congregated in great\r\nnumbers, and made their wholesale slaughter of easy accomplishment. Mr.\r\nThomas Ashe[62] has recorded some very interesting facts and\r\nobservations on this point. In speaking of an old man who in the latter\r\npart of the last century built a log house for himself \"on the immediate\r\nborders of a salt spring,\" in western Pennsylvania, for the purpose of\r\nkilling buffaloes out of the immense droves which frequented that spot,\r\nMr. Ashe says:\r\n\r\n[Note 62: Travels in America in 1806. London, 1808.]\r\n\r\n\"In the first and second years this old man, with some companions,\r\nkilled from six to seven hundred of these noble creatures merely for the\r\nsake of their skins, which to them were worth only 2 shillings each; and\r\nafter this 'work of death' they were obliged to leave the place till the\r\nfollowing season, or till the wolves, bears, panthers, eagles, rooks,\r\nravens, etc., had devoured the carcasses and abandoned the place for\r\nother prey. In the two following years the same persons killed great\r\nnumbers out of the first droves that arrived, skinned them, and left\r\ntheir bodies exposed to the sun and air; but they soon had reason to\r\nrepent of this, for the remaining droves, as they came up in succession,\r\nstopped, gazed on the mangled and putrid bodies, sorrowfully moaned or\r\nfuriously lowed aloud, and returned instantly to the wilderness in an\r\nunusual run, without tasting their favorite spring or licking the\r\nimpregnated earth, which was also once their most agreeable occupation;\r\nnor did they nor any of their race ever revisit the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\"The simple history of this spring is that of every other in the settled\r\nparts of this Western World; the carnage of beasts was everywhere the\r\nsame. I met with a man who had killed two thousand buffaloes with his\r\nown hand, and others no doubt have done the same thing. In consequence\r\nof such proceedings not one buffalo is at this time to be found east of\r\nthe Mississippi, except a few domesticated by the curious, or carried\r\nthrough the country on a public show.\"\r\n\r\nBut, fortunately, there is no evidence that such slaughter as that\r\ndescribed by Mr. Ashe was at all common, and there is reason for the\r\nbelief that until within the last forty years the buffalo was sacrificed\r\nin ways conducive to the greatest good of the greatest number.\r\n\r\nFrom Coronado to General Frémont there has hardly been an explorer of\r\nUnited States territory who has not had occasion to bless the bison, and\r\nits great value to mankind can hardly be overestimated, although by many\r\nit can readily be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of the bison from the eastern United States was due to\r\nits consumption as food. It was very gradual, like the march of\r\ncivilization, and, under the circumstances, absolutely inevitable. In a\r\ncountry so thickly peopled as this region speedily became, the mastodon\r\ncould have survived extinction about as easily as the bison. Except when\r\nthe latter became the victim of wholesale slaughter, there was little\r\nreason to bemoan his fate, save upon grounds that may be regarded purely\r\nsentimental. He served a most excellent purpose in the development of\r\nthe country. Even as late as 1875 the farmers of eastern Kansas were in\r\nthe habit of making trips every fall into the western part of that State\r\nfor wagon loads of buffalo meat as a supply for the succeeding winter.\r\nThe farmers of Texas, Nebraska, Dakota, and Minnesota also drew largely\r\nupon the buffalo as long as the supply lasted.\r\n\r\nThe extirpation of the bison west of the Rocky Mountains was due to\r\nlegitimate hunting for food and clothing rather than for marketable\r\npeltries. In no part of that whole region was the species ever numerous,\r\nalthough in the mountains themselves, notably in Colorado, within easy\r\nreach of the great prairies on the east, vast numbers were seen by the\r\nearly explorers and pioneers. But to the westward, away from the\r\nmountains, they were very rarely met with, and their total destruction\r\nin that region was a matter of easy accomplishment. According to Prof.\r\nJ. A. Allen the complete disappearance of the bison west of the Rocky\r\nMountains took place between 1838 and 1840.\r\n\r\nB. THE PERIOD OF SYSTEMATIC SLAUGHTER, FROM 1830 TO 1838.\r\n\r\nWe come now to a history which I would gladly leave unwritten. Its\r\nrecord is a disgrace to the American people in general, and the\r\nTerritorial, State, and General Government in particular. It will cause\r\nsucceeding generations to regard us as being possessed of the leading\r\ncharacteristics of the savage and the beast of prey--cruelty and greed.\r\nWe will be likened to the blood-thirsty tiger of the Indian jungle, who\r\nslaughters a dozen bullocks at once when he knows he can eat only one.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, at least, the white men who engaged in the systematic\r\nslaughter of the bison were savages just as much as the Piegan Indians,\r\nwho would drive a whole herd over a precipice to secure a week's rations\r\nof meat for a single village. The men who killed buffaloes for their\r\ntongues and those who shot them from the railway trains for sport were\r\nmurderers. In no way does civilized man so quickly revert to his former\r\nstate as when he is alone with the beasts of the field. Give him a gun\r\nand something which he may kill without getting himself in trouble, and,\r\npresto! he is instantly a savage again, finding exquisite delight in\r\nbloodshed, slaughter, and death, if not for gain, then solely for the\r\njoy and happiness of it. There is no kind of warfare against game\r\nanimals too unfair, too disreputable, or too mean for white men to\r\nengage in if they can only do so with safety to their own precious\r\ncarcasses. They will shoot buffalo and antelope from running railway\r\ntrains, drive deer into water with hounds and cut their throats in cold\r\nblood, kill does with fawns a week old, kill fawns by the score for\r\ntheir spotted skins, slaughter deer, moose, and caribou in the snow at a\r\npitiful disadvantage, just as the wolves do; exterminate the wild ducks\r\non the whole Atlantic seaboard with punt guns for the metropolitan\r\nmarkets; kill off the Rocky Mountain goats for hides worth only 50 cents\r\napiece, destroy wagon loads of trout with dynamite, and so on to the end\r\nof the chapter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most gigantic task ever undertaken on this continent in the\r\nline of game-slaughter was the extermination of the bison in the great\r\npasture region by the hide-hunters. Probably the brilliant rapidity and\r\nsuccess with which that lofty undertaking was accomplished was a matter\r\nof surprise even to those who participated in it. The story of the\r\nslaughter is by no means a long one.\r\n\r\nThe period of systematic slaughter of the bison naturally begins with\r\nthe first organized efforts in that direction, in a business-like,\r\nwholesale way. Although the species had been steadily driven westward\r\nfor a hundred years by the advancing settlements, and had during all\r\nthat time been hunted for the meat and robes it yielded, its\r\nextermination did not begin in earnest until 1820, or thereabouts. As\r\nbefore stated, various persons had previous to that time made buffalo\r\nkilling a business in order to sell their skins, but such instances were\r\nvery exceptional. By that time the bison was totally extinct in all the\r\nregion lying east of the Mississippi River except a portion of\r\nWisconsin, where it survived until about 1830. In 1820 the first\r\norganized buffalo hunting expedition on a grand scale was made from the\r\nRed River settlement, Manitoba, in which five hundred and forty carts\r\nproceeded to the range. Previous to that time the buffaloes were found\r\nnear enough to the settlements around Fort Garry that every settler\r\ncould hunt independently; but as the herds were driven farther and\r\nfarther away, it required an organized effort and a long journey to\r\nreach them.\r\n\r\nThe American Fur Company established trading posts along the Missouri\r\nRiver, one at the mouth of the Tetón River and another at the mouth of\r\nthe Yellowstone. In 1826 a post was established at the eastern base of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, at the head of the Arkansas River, and in 1832\r\nanother was located in a corresponding situation at the head of the\r\nSouth Fork of the Platte, close to where Denver now stands. Both the\r\nlatter were on what was then the western border of the buffalo range.\r\nElsewhere throughout the buffalo country there were numerous other\r\nposts, always situated as near as possible to the best hunting ground,\r\nand at the same time where they would be most accessible to the hunters,\r\nboth white and red.\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed, the Indians were encouraged to kill buffaloes for\r\ntheir robes, and this is what Mr. George Catlin wrote at the mouth of\r\nthe Tetón River (Pyatt County, Dakota) in 1832 concerning this\r\ntrade:[63]\r\n\r\n\"It seems hard and cruel (does it not?) that we civilized people, with\r\nall the luxuries and comforts of the world about us, should be drawing\r\nfrom the backs of these useful animals the skins for our luxury, leaving\r\ntheir carcasses to be devoured by the wolves; that we should draw from\r\nthat country some one hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand of their\r\nrobes annually, the greater part of which are taken from animals that\r\nare killed expressly for the robe, at a season when the meat is not\r\ncured and preserved, and for each of which skins the Indian has received\r\nbut a pint of whisky! Such is the fact, and that number, or near it, are\r\nannually destroyed, in addition to the number that is necessarily killed\r\nfor the subsistence of three hundred thousand Indians, who live chiefly\r\nupon them.\"\r\n\r\nThe author further declared that the fur trade in those \"great western\r\nrealms\" was then limited chiefly to the purchase of buffalo robes.\r\n\r\n1. _The Red River half-breeds._--In June, 1840, when the Red River\r\nhalf-breeds assembled at Pembina for their annual expedition against the\r\nbuffalo, they mustered as follows:\r\n\r\n+-------------------------------------+\r\n|Carts                          |1,210|\r\n+-------------------------+-----+-----+\r\n|Hunters                  |  620|     |\r\n+-------------------------+-----+     |\r\n|Women                    |  650|1,630|\r\n+-------------------------+-----+     |\r\n|Boys and girls           |  360|     |\r\n+-------------------------+-----+-----+\r\n|Horses (buffalo runners)       |  403|\r\n+-------------------------------+-----+\r\n|Dogs                           |  542|\r\n+-------------------------------+-----+\r\n|Cart horses                    |  655|\r\n+-------------------------------+-----+\r\n|Draught oxen                   |  586|\r\n+-------------------------------+-----+\r\n|Skinning knives                |1,240|\r\n+-------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe total value of the property employed in this expedition and the\r\nworking time occupied by it (two months) amounted to the enormous sum of\r\n£24,000.\r\n\r\n[Note 63: North American Indians, I, p. 263.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the bison formerly ranged to Fort Garry (near Winnipeg), they\r\nhad been steadily killed off and driven back, and in 1840 none were\r\nfound by the expedition until it was 250 miles from Pembina, which is\r\nsituated on the Red River, at the international boundary. At that time\r\nthe extinction of the species from the Red River to the Cheyenne was\r\npractically complete. The Red River settlers, aided, of course, by the\r\nIndians of that region, are responsible for the extermination of the\r\nbison throughout northeastern Dakota as far as the Cheyenne River,\r\nnorthern Minnesota, and the whole of what is now the province of\r\nManitoba. More than that; as the game grew scarce and retired farther\r\nand farther, the half-breeds, who despised agriculture as long as there\r\nwas a buffalo to kill, extended their hunting operations westward along\r\nthe Qu'Appelle until they encroached upon the hunting-grounds of the\r\nPlain Crees, who lived in the Saskatchewan country.\r\n\r\nThus was an immense inroad made in the northern half of the herd which\r\nhad previously covered the entire pasture region from the Great Slave\r\nLake to central Texas. This was the first visible impression of the\r\nsystematic killing which began in 1820. Up to 1840 it is reasonably\r\ncertain, as will be seen by figures given elsewhere, that by this\r\nbusiness-like method of the half-breeds, at least 652,000 buffaloes were\r\ndestroyed by them alone.\r\n\r\nEven as early as 1840 the Red River hunt was prosecuted through Dakota\r\nsouthwestwardly to the Missouri River and a short distance beyond it.\r\nHere it touched the wide strip of territory, bordering that stream,\r\nwhich was even then being regularly drained of its animal resources by\r\nthe Indian hunters, who made the river their base of operations, and\r\nwhose robes were shipped on its steam-boats.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that these annual Red River expeditions into Dakota were\r\nkept up as late as 1847, and as long thereafter as buffaloes were to be\r\nfound in any number between the Cheyenne and the Missouri. At the same\r\ntime, the White Horse Plains division, which hunted westward from Fort\r\nGarry, did its work of destruction quite as rapidly and as thoroughly as\r\nthe rival expedition to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the Plains Crees, inhabiting the country around the headwaters\r\nof the Qu'Appelle River (250 miles due west from Winnipeg), assembled in\r\ncouncil, and \"determined that in consequence of promises often made and\r\nbroken by the white men and half-breeds, and the rapid destruction by\r\nthem of the buffalo they fed on, they would not permit either white men\r\nor half-breeds to hunt in their country, or travel through it, except\r\nfor the purpose of trading for their dried meat, pemmican, skins and\r\nrobes.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the Crees reported that between the two branches of the\r\nSaskatchewan buffalo were \"very scarce.\" Professor Hind's expedition saw\r\nonly one buffalo in the whole course of their journey from Winnipeg\r\nuntil they reached Sand Hill Lake, at the head of the Qu'Appelle, near\r\nthe south branch of the Saskatchewan, where the first herd was\r\nencountered. Although the species was not totally extinct on the\r\nQu'Appelle at that time, it was practically so.\r\n\r\n2. _The country of the Sioux._--The next territory completely\r\ndepopulated of buffaloes by systematic hunting was very nearly the\r\nentire southern half of Dakota, southwestern Minnesota, and northern\r\nNebraska as far as the North Platte. This vast region, once the favorite\r\nrange for hundreds of thousands of buffaloes, had for many years been\r\nthe favorite hunting ground of the Sioux Indians of the Missouri, the\r\nPawnees, Omahas, and all other tribes of that region. The settlement of\r\nIowa and Minnesota presently forced into this region the entire body of\r\nMississippi Sioux from the country west of Prairie du Chien and around\r\nFort Snelling, and materially hastened the extermination of all the game\r\nanimals which were once so abundant there. It is absolutely certain that\r\nif the Indians had been uninfluenced by the white traders, or, in other\r\nwords, had not been induced to take and prepare a large number of robes\r\nevery year for the market, the species would have survived very much\r\nlonger than it did. But the demand quickly proved to be far greater than\r\nthe supply. The Indians, of course, found it necessary to slaughter\r\nannually a great number of buffaloes for their own wants--for meat,\r\nrobes, leather, teepees, etc. When it came to supplementing this\r\nnecessary slaughter by an additional fifty thousand or more every year\r\nfor marketable robes, it is no wonder that the improvident savages soon\r\nfound, when too late, that the supply of buffaloes was not\r\ninexhaustible. Naturally enough, they attributed their disappearance to\r\nthe white man, who was therefore a robber, and a proper subject for the\r\nscalping-knife. Apparently it never occurred to the minds of the Sioux\r\nthat they themselves were equally to blame; it was always _the paleface_\r\nwho killed the buffaloes; and it was always _Sioux_ buffaloes that they\r\nkilled. The Sioux seemed to feel that they held a chattel mortgage on\r\nall the buffaloes north of the Platte, and it required more than one\r\npitched battle to convince them otherwise.\r\n\r\nUp to the time when the great Sioux Reservation was established in\r\nDakota (1875-'77), when 33,739 square miles of country, or nearly the\r\nwhole southwest quarter of the Territory, was set aside for the\r\nexclusive occupancy of the Sioux, buffaloes were very numerous\r\nthroughout that entire region. East of the Missouri River, which is the\r\neastern boundary of the Sioux Reservation, from Bismarck all the way\r\ndown, the species was practically extinct as early as 1870. But at the\r\ntime when it became unlawful for white hunters to enter the territory of\r\nthe Sioux nation there were tens of thousands of buffaloes upon it, and\r\ntheir subsequent slaughter is chargeable to the Indians alone, save as\r\nto those which migrated into the hunting grounds of the whites.\r\n\r\n3. _Western railways, and their part in the extermination of the\r\nbuffalo._--The building of a railroad means the speedy extermination of\r\nall the big game along its line. In its eagerness to attract the public\r\nand build up \"a big business,\" every new line which traverses a country\r\ncontaining game does its utmost, by means of advertisements and posters,\r\nto attract the man with a gun. Its game resorts are all laid bare, and\r\nthe market hunters and sportsmen swarm in immediately, slaying and to\r\nslay.\r\n\r\nWithin the last year the last real retreat for our finest game, the only\r\nremaining stronghold for the mountain sheep, goat, caribou, elk, and\r\ndeer--northwestern Montana, northern Idaho, and thence westward--has\r\nbeen laid open to the very heart by the building of the St. Paul,\r\nMinneapolis and Manitoba Railway, which runs up the valley of the Milk\r\nRiver to Fort Assinniboine, and crosses the Rocky Mountains through Two\r\nMedicine Pass. Heretofore that region has been so difficult to reach\r\nthat the game it contains has been measurably secure from general\r\nslaughter; but now it also must \"go.\"\r\n\r\nThe marking out of the great overland trail by the Argonauts of '49 in\r\ntheir rush for the gold fields of California was the foreshadowing of\r\nthe great east-and-west breach in the universal herd, which was made\r\ntwenty years later by the first transcontinental railway.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers who \"crossed the plains\" in those days killed buffaloes for\r\nfood whenever they could, and the constant harrying of those animals\r\nexperienced along the line of travel, soon led them to retire from the\r\nproximity of such continual danger. It was undoubtedly due to this cause\r\nthat the number seen by parties who crossed the plains in 1849 and\r\nsubsequently, was surprisingly small. But, fortunately for the\r\nbuffaloes, the pioneers who would gladly have halted and turned aside\r\nnow and then for the excitement of the chase, were compelled to hurry\r\non, and accomplish the long journey while good weather lasted. It was\r\nowing to this fact, and the scarcity of good horses, that the buffaloes\r\nfound it necessary to retire only a few miles from the wagon route to\r\nget beyond the reach of those who would have gladly hunted them.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen Varner, of Indianola, Illinois, has kindly furnished me with\r\nthe following facts in regard to the presence of the buffalo, as\r\nobserved by him during his journey westward, over what was then known as\r\nthe Oregon Trail.\r\n\r\n\"The old Oregon trail ran from Independence, Missouri, to old Fort\r\nLaramie, through the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains, and thence up to\r\nSalt Lake City. We left Independence on May C, 1849, and struck the\r\nPlatte River at Grand Island. The trail had been traveled but very\r\nlittle previous to that year. We saw no buffaloes whatever until we\r\nreached the forks of the Platte, on May 20, or thereabouts. There we saw\r\nseventeen head. From that time on we saw small bunches now and then;\r\nnever more than forty or fifty together. We saw no great herds anywhere,\r\nand I should say we did not see over five hundred head all told. The\r\nmost western point at which we saw buffaloes was about due north of\r\nLaramie Peak, and it must have been about the 20th of June. We killed\r\nseveral head for meat during our trip, and found them all rather thin\r\nin flesh. Plainsmen who claimed to know, said that all the buffaloes we\r\nsaw had wintered in that locality, and had not had time to get fat. The\r\nannual migration from the south had not yet begun, or rather had not yet\r\nbrought any of the southern buffaloes that far north.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few years the tide of overland travel became so great, that the\r\nbuffaloes learned to keep away from the dangers of the trail, and many a\r\npioneer has crossed the plains without ever seeing a live buffalo.\r\n\r\n4. _The division of the universal herd._--Until the building of the\r\nfirst transcontinental railway made it possible to market the \"buffalo\r\nproduct,\" buffalo hunting as a business was almost wholly in the hands\r\nof the Indians. Even then, the slaughter so far exceeded the natural\r\nincrease that the narrowing limits of the buffalo range was watched with\r\nanxiety, and the ultimate extinction of the species confidently\r\npredicted. Even without railroads the extermination of the race would\r\nhave taken place eventually, but it would have been delayed perhaps\r\ntwenty years. With a recklessness of the future that was not to be\r\nexpected of savages, though perhaps perfectly natural to civilized white\r\nmen, who place the possession of a dollar above everything else, the\r\nIndians with one accord singled out the _cows_ for slaughter, because\r\ntheir robes and their flesh better suited the fastidious taste of the\r\nnoble redskin. The building of the Union Pacific Railway began at Omaha\r\nin 1865, and during that year 40 miles were constructed. The year\r\nfollowing saw the completion of 265 miles more, and in 1867 245 miles\r\nwere added, which brought it to Cheyenne. In 1868, 350 miles were built,\r\nand in 1869 the entire line was open to traffic.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, when Maj. J. W. Powell and Prof. A. H. Thompson crossed the\r\nplains by means of the Union Pacific Railway as far as it was\r\nconstructed and thence onward by wagon, they saw during the entire trip\r\nonly one live buffalo, a solitary old bull, wandering aimlessly along\r\nthe south bank of the Platte River.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the Union Pacific Railway divided forever the\r\nbuffaloes of the United States into two great herds, which thereafter\r\nbecame known respectively as the northern and southern herds. Both\r\nretired rapidly and permanently from the railway, and left a strip of\r\ncountry over 50 miles wide almost uninhabited by them. Although many\r\nthousand buffaloes were killed by hunters who made the Union Pacific\r\nRailway their base of operations, the two great bodies retired north and\r\nsouth so far that the greater number were beyond striking distance from\r\nthat line.\r\n\r\n5. _The destruction of the southern herd._--The geographical center of\r\nthe great southern herd during the few years of its separate existence\r\nprevious to its destruction was very near the present site of Garden\r\nCity, Kansas. On the east, even as late as 1872, thousands of buffaloes\r\nranged within 10 miles of Wichita, which was then the headquarters of a\r\ngreat number of buffalo-hunters, who plied their occupation vigorously\r\nduring the winter. On the north the herd ranged within 25 miles of the\r\nUnion Pacific, until the swarm of hunters coming down from the north\r\ndrove them farther and farther south. On the west, a few small bands\r\nranged as far as Pike's Peak and the South Park, but the main body\r\nranged east of the town of Pueblo, Colorado. In the southwest, buffaloes\r\nwere abundant as far as the Pecos and the Staked Plains, while the\r\nsouthern limit of the herd was about on a line with the southern\r\nboundary of New Mexico. Regarding this herd, Colonel Dodge writes as\r\nfollows: \"Their most prized feeding ground was the section of country\r\nbetween the South Platte and Arkansas rivers, watered by the Republican,\r\nSmoky, Walnut, Pawnee, and other parallel or tributary streams, and\r\ngenerally known as the Republican country. Hundreds of thousands went\r\nsouth from here each winter, but hundreds of thousands remained. It was\r\nthe chosen home of the buffalo.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the range of the northern herd covered about twice as much\r\nterritory as did the southern, the latter contained probably twice as\r\nmany buffaloes. The number of individuals in the southern herd in the\r\nyear 1871 must have been at least three millions, and most estimates\r\nplace the total much higher than that.\r\n\r\nDuring the years from 1866 to 1871, inclusive, the Atchison, Topeka and\r\nSanta Fé Railway and what is now known as the Kansas Pacific, or Kansas\r\ndivision of the Union Pacific Railway, were constructed from the\r\nMissouri River westward across Kansas, and through the heart of the\r\nsouthern buffalo range. The southern herd was literally cut to pieces by\r\nrailways, and every portion of its range rendered easily accessible.\r\nThere had always been a market for buffalo robes at a fair price, and as\r\nsoon as the railways crossed the buffalo country the slaughter began.\r\nThe rush to the range was only surpassed by the rush to the gold mines\r\nof California in earlier years. The railroad builders, teamsters,\r\nfortune-seekers, \"professional\" hunters, trappers, guides, and every one\r\nout of a job turned out to hunt buffalo for hides and meat. The\r\nmerchants who had already settled in all the little towns along the\r\nthree great railways saw an opportunity to make money out of the buffalo\r\nproduct, and forthwith began to organize and supply hunting parties with\r\narms, ammunition, and provisions, and send them to the range. An immense\r\nbusiness of this kind was done by the merchants of Dodge City (Fort\r\nDodge), Wichita, and Leavenworth, and scores of smaller towns did a\r\ncorresponding amount of business in the same line. During the years 1871\r\nto 1874 but little else was done in that country except buffalo killing.\r\nCentral depots were established in the best buffalo country, from whence\r\nhunting parties operated in all directions. Buildings were erected for\r\nthe curing of meat, and corrals were built in which to heap up the\r\nimmense piles of buffalo skins that accumulated. At Dodge City, as late\r\nas 1878, Professor Thompson saw a lot of baled buffalo skins in a\r\ncorral, the solid cubical contents of which he calculated to equal 120\r\ncords.\r\n\r\nAt first the utmost wastefulness prevailed. Every one wanted to kill\r\nbuffalo, and no one was willing to do the skinning and curing. Thousands\r\nupon thousands of buffaloes were killed for their tongues alone, and\r\nnever skinned. Thousands more were wounded by unskillful marksmen and\r\nwandered off to die and become a total loss. But the climax of\r\nwastefulness and sloth was not reached until the enterprising\r\nbuffalo-butcher began to skin his dead buffaloes by horse-power. The\r\nprocess is of interest, as showing the depth of degradation to which a\r\nman can fall and still call himself a hunter. The skin of the buffalo\r\nwas ripped open along the belly and throat, the legs cut around at the\r\nknees, and ripped up the rest of the way. The skin of the neck was\r\ndivided all the way around at the back of the head, and skinned back a\r\nfew inches to afford a start. A stout iron bar, like a hitching post,\r\nwas then driven through the skull and about 18 inches into the earth,\r\nafter which a rope was tied very firmly to the thick skin of the neck,\r\nmade ready for that purpose. The other end of this rope was then hitched\r\nto the whiffletree of a pair of horses, or to the rear axle of a wagon,\r\nthe horses were whipped up, and the skin was forthwith either torn in\r\ntwo or torn off the buffalo with about 50 pounds of flesh adhering to\r\nit. It soon became apparent to even the most enterprising buffalo\r\nskinner that this method was not an unqualified success, and it was\r\npresently abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter which began in 1871 was prosecuted with great vigor and\r\nenterprise in 1872, and reached its heighten 1873. By that time, the\r\nbuffalo country fairly swarmed with hunters, each, party putting forth\r\nits utmost efforts to destroy more buffaloes than its rivals. By that\r\ntime experience had taught the value of thorough organization, and the\r\nbutchering was done in a more business-like way. By a coincidence that\r\nproved fatal to the bison, it was just at the beginning of the slaughter\r\nthat breech-loading, long-range rifles attained what was practically\r\nperfection. The Sharps 40-90 or 45-120, and the Remington were the\r\nfavorite weapons of the buffalo-hunter, the former being the one in most\r\ngeneral use. Before the leaden hail of thousands of these deadly\r\nbreech-loaders the buffaloes went down at the rate of several thousand\r\ndaily during the hunting season.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1871 and 1872 the most wanton wastefulness prevailed.\r\nColonel Dodge declares that, though hundreds of thousands of skins were\r\nsent to market, they scarcely indicated the extent of the slaughter.\r\nThrough want of skill in shooting and want of knowledge in preserving\r\nthe hides of those slain by green hunters, _one hide sent to market\r\nrepresented three, four, or even five dead buffalo_. The skinners and\r\ncurers knew so little of the proper mode of curing hides, that at least\r\nhalf of those actually taken were lost. In the summer and fall of 1872\r\none hide sent to market represented at least _three_ dead buffalo. This\r\ncondition of affairs rapidly improved; but such was the furor for\r\nslaughter, and the ignorance of all concerned, that every hide sent to\r\nmarket in 1871 represented no less than _five_ dead buffalo.\r\n\r\nBy 1873 the condition of affairs had somewhat improved, through better\r\norganization of the hunting parties and knowledge gained by experience\r\nin curing. For all that, however, buffaloes were still so exceedingly\r\nplentiful, and shooting was so much easier than skinning, the latter was\r\nlooked upon as a necessary evil and still slighted to such an extent\r\nthat every hide actually sold and delivered represented two dead\r\nbuffaloes.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the slaughterers began to take alarm at the increasing scarcity\r\nof buffalo, and the skinners, having a much smaller number of dead\r\nanimals to take care of than ever before, were able to devote more time\r\nto each subject and do their work properly. As a result, Colonel Dodge\r\nestimated that during 1874, and from that time on, one hundred skins\r\ndelivered represented not more than one hundred and twenty-five dead\r\nbuffaloes; but that \"no parties have ever got the proportion lower than\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nThe great southern herd was slaughtered by still-hunting, a method which\r\nhas already been fully described. A typical hunting party is thus\r\ndescribed by Colonel Dodge:[64]\r\n\r\n\"The most approved party consisted of four men--one shooter, two\r\nskinners, and one man to cook, stretch hides, and take care of camp.\r\nWhere buffalo were very plentiful the number of skinners was increased.\r\nA light wagon, drawn by two horses or mules, takes the outfit into the\r\nwilderness, and brings into camp the skins taken each day. The outfit is\r\nmost meager: a sack of flour, a side of bacon, 5 pounds of coffee, tea,\r\nand sugar, a little salt, and possibly a few beans, is a month's supply.\r\nA common or \"A\" tent furnishes shelter; a couple of blankets for each\r\nman is a bed. One or more of Sharps or Remington's heaviest sporting\r\nrifles, and an unlimited supply of ammunition, is the armament; while a\r\ncoffee-pot, Dutch-oven, frying-pan, four tin plates, and four tin cups\r\nconstitute the kitchen and table furniture.\r\n\r\n\"The skinning knives do duty at the platter, and 'fingers were made\r\nbefore forks.' Nor must be forgotten one or more 10-gallon kegs for\r\nwater, as the camp may of necessity be far away from a stream. The\r\nsupplies are generally furnished by the merchant for whom the party is\r\nworking, who, in addition, pays each of the party a specified percentage\r\nof the value of the skins delivered. The shooter is carefully selected\r\nfor his skill and knowledge of the habits of the buffalo. He is captain\r\nand leader of the party. When all is ready, he plunges into the\r\nwilderness, going to the center of the best buffalo region known to him,\r\nnot already occupied (for there are unwritten regulations recognized as\r\nlaws, giving to each hunter certain rights of discovery and occupancy).\r\nArrived at the position, he makes his camp in some hidden ravine or\r\nthicket, and makes all ready for work.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 64: Plains of the Great West, p. 134.]\r\n\r\nOf course the slaughter was greatest along the lines of the three great\r\nrailways--the Kansas Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé, and the\r\nUnion Pacific, about in the order named. It reached its height in the\r\nseason of 1873. During that year the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé\r\nRailroad carried out of the buffalo country 251,443 robes, 1,017,600\r\npounds of meat, and 2,743,100 pounds of bones. The end of the southern\r\nherd was then near at hand. Could the southern buffalo range have been\r\nroofed over at that time it would have made one vast charnel-house.\r\nPutrifying carcasses, many of them with the hide still on, lay thickly\r\nscattered over thousands of square miles of the level prairie, poisoning\r\nthe air and water and offending the sight. The remaining herds had\r\nbecome mere scattered bands, harried and driven hither and thither by\r\nthe hunters, who now swarmed almost as thickly as the buffaloes. A\r\ncordon of camps was established along the Arkansas River, the South\r\nPlatte, the Republican, and the few other streams that contained water,\r\nand when the thirsty animals came to drink they were attacked and driven\r\naway, and with the most fiendish persistency kept from slaking their\r\nthirst, so that they would again be compelled to seek the river and come\r\nwithin range of the deadly breech-loaders. Colonel Dodge declares that\r\nin places favorable to such warfare, as the south bank of the Platte, a\r\nherd of buffalo has, by shooting at it by day and by lighting fires and\r\nfiring guns at night, been kept from water until it has been entirely\r\ndestroyed. In the autumn of 1873, when Mr. William Blackmore traveled\r\nfor some 30 or 40 miles along the north bank of the Arkansas River to\r\nthe east of Port Dodge, \"there was a continuous line of putrescent\r\ncarcasses, so that the air was rendered pestilential and offensive to\r\nthe last degree. The hunters had formed a line of camps along the banks\r\nof the river, and had shot down the buffalo, night and morning, as they\r\ncame to drink. In order to give an idea of the number of these\r\ncarcasses, it is only necessary to mention that I counted sixty-seven on\r\none spot not covering 4 acres.\"\r\n\r\nWhite hunters were not allowed to hunt in the Indian Territory, but the\r\nsouthern boundary of the State of Kansas was picketed by them, and a\r\nherd no sooner crossed the line going north than it was destroyed. Every\r\nwater-hole was guarded by a camp of hunters, and whenever a thirsty herd\r\napproached, it was promptly met by rifle-bullets.\r\n\r\nDuring this entire period the slaughter of buffaloes was universal. The\r\nman who desired buffalo meat for food almost invariably killed five\r\ntimes as many animals as he could utilize, and after cutting from each\r\nvictim its very choicest parts--the _tongue alone_, possibly, or perhaps\r\nthe hump and hind quarters, one or the other, or both--fully four-fifths\r\nof the really edible portion of the carcass would be left to the wolves.\r\nIt was no uncommon thing for a man to bring in two barrels of salted\r\nbuffalo tongues, without another pound of meat or a solitary robe. The\r\ntongues were purchased at 25 cents each and sold in the markets farther\r\neast at 50 cents. In those days of criminal wastefulness it was a very\r\ncommon thing for buffaloes to be slaughtered for their tongues alone.\r\nMr. George Catlin[65] relates that a few days previous to his arrival at\r\nthe mouth of the Tetón River (Dakota), in 1832, \"an immense herd of\r\nbuffaloes had showed themselves on the opposite side of the river,\"\r\nwhereupon a party of five or six hundred Sioux Indians on horseback\r\nforded the river, attacked the herd, recrossed the river about sunset,\r\nand came into the fort with fourteen hundred fresh buffalo tongues,\r\nwhich were thrown down in a mass, and for which they required only a few\r\ngallons of whisky, which was soon consumed in \"a little harmless\r\ncarouse.\" Mr. Catlin states that from all that he could learn not a skin\r\nor a pound of meat, other than the tongues, was saved after this awful\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\n[Note 65: North American Indians, I, 256.]\r\n\r\nJudging from all accounts, it is making a safe estimate to say that\r\nprobably no fewer than fifty thousand buffaloes have been killed for\r\ntheir tongues alone, and the most of these are undoubtedly chargeable\r\nagainst white men, who ought to have known better.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said about the slaughter of buffaloes by foreign\r\nsportsmen, particularly Englishmen; but I must say that, from all that\r\ncan be ascertained on this point, this element of destruction has been\r\ngreatly exaggerated and overestimated. It is true that every English\r\nsportsman who visited this country in the days of the buffalo always\r\nresolved to have, and did have, \"a buffalo hunt,\" and usually under the\r\nauspices of United States Army officers. Undoubtedly these parties did\r\nkill hundreds of buffaloes, but it is very doubtful whether the\r\naggregate of the number slain by foreign sportsmen would run up higher\r\nthan ten thousand. Indeed, for myself, I am well convinced that there\r\nare many old ex-still-hunters yet living, each of whom is accountable\r\nfor a greater number of victims than all buffaloes killed by foreign\r\nsportsmen would make added together. The professional butchers were very\r\nmuch given to crying out against \"them English lords,\" and holding up\r\ntheir hands in holy horror at buffaloes killed by them for their heads,\r\ninstead of for hides to sell at a dollar apiece; but it is due the\r\nAmerican public to say that all this outcry was received at its true\r\nvalue and deceived very few. By those in possession of the facts it was\r\nrecognized as \"a blind,\" to divert public opinion from the real\r\nculprits.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it is very true that many men who were properly classed as\r\nsportsmen, in contradistinction from the pot-hunters, did engage in\r\nuseless and inexcusable slaughter to an extent that was highly\r\nreprehensible, to say the least. A sportsman is not supposed to kill\r\ngame wantonly, when it can be of no possible use to himself or any one\r\nelse, but a great many do it for all that. Indeed, the sportsman who\r\nkills sparingly and conscientiously is rather the exception than the\r\nrule. Colonel Dodge thus refers to the work of some foreign sportsmen:\r\n\r\n\"In the fall of that year [1872] three English gentlemen went out with\r\nme for a short hunt, and in their excitement bagged more buffalo than\r\nwould have supplied a brigade.\" As a general thing, however, the\r\nprofessional sportsmen who went out to have a buffalo hunt for the\r\nexcitement of the chase and the trophies it yielded, nearly always found\r\nthe bison so easy a victim, and one whose capture brought so little\r\nglory to the hunter, that the chase was voted very disappointing, and\r\nsoon abandoned in favor of nobler game. In those days there was no more\r\nto boast of in killing a buffalo than in the assassination of a Texas\r\nsteer.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, the hide-hunters, white and red, but especially white, who\r\nwiped out the great southern herd in four short years. The prices\r\nreceived for hides varied considerably, according to circumstances, but\r\nfor the green or undressed article it usually ranged from 50 cents for\r\nthe skins of calves to $1.25 for those of adult animals in good\r\ncondition. Such prices seem ridiculously small, but when it is\r\nremembered that, when buffaloes were plentiful it was no uncommon thing\r\nfor a hunter to kill from forty to sixty head in a day, it will readily\r\nbe seen that the _chances_ of making very handsome profits were\r\nsufficient to tempt hunters to make extraordinary exertions. Moreover,\r\neven when the buffaloes were nearly gone, the country was overrun with\r\nmen who had absolutely nothing else to look to as a means of livelihood,\r\nand so, no matter whether the profits were great or small, so long as\r\nenough buffaloes remained to make it possible to get a living by their\r\npursuit, they were hunted down with the most determined persistency and\r\npertinacity.\r\n\r\n6. _Statistics of the slaughter._--The most careful and reliable\r\nestimate ever made of results of the slaughter of the southern buffalo\r\nherd is that of Col. Richard Irving Dodge, and it is the only one I know\r\nof which furnishes a good index of the former size of that herd.\r\nInasmuch as this calculation was based on actual statistics,\r\nsupplemented by personal observations and inquiries made in that region\r\nduring the great slaughter, I can do no better than to quote Colonel\r\nDodge almost in full.[66]\r\n\r\n[Note 66: Plains of the Great West, pp. 139-144.]\r\n\r\nThe Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad furnished the following\r\nstatistics of the buffalo product carried by it during the years 1872,\r\n1873, and 1874:\r\n\r\n+----------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                 _Buffalo product._                 |\r\n+----------------------------------------------------+\r\n|      | No. of skins |               |              |\r\n|Year. |   carried.   | Meat carried. | Bone carried.|\r\n+----------------------------------------------------+\r\n|      |              |  Pounds.      |   Pounds.    |\r\n|1872  |    165,721   |        ...    |   1,135,300  |\r\n|1873  |    251,443   |  1,617,600    |   2,743,100  |\r\n|1874  |     42,289   |    632,800    |   6,914,950  |\r\n+------|--------------|---------------|--------------+\r\n|Total |    459,453   |  2,250,400    |  10,793,350  |\r\n+----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe officials of the Kansas Pacific and Union Pacific railroads either\r\ncould not or would not furnish any statistics of the amount of the\r\nbuffalo product carried by their lines during this period, and it became\r\nnecessary to proceed without the actual figures in both cases. Inasmuch\r\nas the Kansas Pacific road cuts through a portion of the buffalo country\r\nwhich was in every respect as thickly inhabited by those animals as the\r\nregion traversed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé, it seemed\r\nabsolutely certain that the former road hauled out fully as many hides\r\nas the latter, if not more, and its quota is so set down. The Union\r\nPacific line handled a much smaller number of buffalo hides than either\r\nof its southern rivals, but Colonel Dodge believes that this, \"with the\r\nsmaller roads which touch the buffalo region, taken together, carried\r\nabout as much as either of the two principal buffalo roads.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Dodge considers it reasonably certain that the statistics\r\nfurnished by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé road represent only\r\none-third of the entire buffalo product, and there certainly appears to\r\nbe good ground for this belief. It is therefore in order to base further\r\ncalculations upon these figures.\r\n\r\nAccording to evidence gathered on the spot by Colonel Dodge during the\r\nperiod of the great slaughter, one hide sent to market in 1872\r\nrepresented three dead buffaloes, in 1873 two, and in 1874 one hundred\r\nskins delivered represented one hundred and twenty-five dead animals.\r\nThe total slaughter by white men was therefore about as below:\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|Year.|Hides    |Hides      |Total      |Total     |Total       |\r\n|     |shipped  |shipped    |number of  |number    |of buffaloes|\r\n|     |by A., T.|by other   |buffaloes  |killed and|slaughtered |\r\n|     |and S.

In the\r\nsummer they killed for the hairless hides to use for lodges and for\r\nleather, and in the autumn they slaughtered for robes and meat, but\r\nparticularly robes, which were all they could offer the white trader in\r\nexchange for his goods. They were too lazy and shiftless to cure much\r\nbuffalo meat, and besides it was not necessary, for the Government fed\r\nthem. In regard to the number of buffaloes of the southern herd killed\r\nby the Indians, Colonel Dodge arrives at an estimate, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is much more difficult to estimate the number of dead buffalo\r\nrepresented by the Indian-tanned skins or robes sent to market. This\r\nnumber varies with the different tribes, and their greater or less\r\ncontact with the whites. Thus, the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and Kiowas of\r\nthe southern plains, having less contact with whites, use skins for\r\ntheir lodges, clothing, bedding, par-fléches, saddles, lariats, for\r\nalmost everything. The number of robes sent to market represent only\r\nwhat we may call the foreign exchange of these tribes, and is really not\r\nmore than one-tenth of the skins taken. To be well within bounds I will\r\nassume that one robe sent to market by these Indians represents six dead\r\nbuffaloes.\r\n\r\n\"Those bands of Sioux who live at the agencies, and whose peltries are\r\ntaken to market by the Union Pacific Railroad, live in lodges of cotton\r\ncloth furnished by the Indian Bureau. They use much civilized clothing,\r\nbedding, boxes, ropes, etc. For these luxuries they must pay in robes,\r\nand as the buffalo range is far from wide, and their yearly 'crop'\r\nsmall, more than half of it goes to market.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving out of the account at this point all consideration of the\r\nkilling done north of the Union Pacific Railroad, Colonel Dodge's\r\nfigures are as follows:\r\n\r\n_Southern buffaloes slaughtered by southern Indians._\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                                         |Sent to   |No. of dead |\r\n|                Indians.                 |market.   |buffaloes   |\r\n|                                         |          |represented.|\r\n+-----------------------------------------+----------+------------+\r\n|                                         |          |            |\r\n|Kiowas, Comanches, Cheyennes, Arapahoes, |          |            |\r\n|and other Indians whose robes go over the|          |            |\r\n|Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad   |  19,000  |  114,000   |\r\n|Sioux at agencies, Union Pacific Railroad|  10,000  |   16,000   |\r\n|                                         +----------+------------+\r\n|Total slaughtered per annum              |  29,000  |  130,000   |\r\n|Total for the three years 1872-1874      |     ...  |  390,000   |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the fact that during those years an\r\nimmense number of buffaloes were killed by the farmers of eastern Kansas\r\nand Nebraska for their meat. Mr. William Mitchell, of Wabaunsee, Kansas,\r\nstated to the writer that \"in those days, when buffaloes were plentiful\r\nin western Kansas, pretty much everybody made a trip West in the fall\r\nand brought back a load of buffalo meat. Everybody had it in abundance\r\nas long as buffaloes remained in any considerable number. Very few skins\r\nwere saved; in fact, hardly any, for the reason that nobody knew how to\r\ntan them, and they always spoiled. At first a great many farmers tried\r\nto dress the green hides that they brought back, but they could not\r\nsucceed, and finally gave up trying. Of course, a great deal of the meat\r\nkilled was wasted, for only the best parts were brought back.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wichita (Kansas) _World_ of February 9, 1889, contains the following\r\nreference:\r\n\r\n\"In 1871 and 1872 the buffalo ranged within 10 miles of Wichita, and\r\ncould be counted by the thousands. The town, then in its infancy, was\r\nthe headquarters for a vast number of buffalo-hunters, who plied their\r\noccupation vigorously during the winter. The buffalo were killed\r\nprincipally for their hides, and daily wagon trains arrived in town\r\nloaded with them. Meat was very cheap in those days; fine, tender\r\nbuffalo steak selling from 1 to 2 cents per pound. * * * The business\r\nwas quite profitable for a time, but a sudden drop in the price of hides\r\nbrought them down as low as 25 and 50 cents each. * * * It was a very\r\ncommon thing in those days for people living in Wichita to start out in\r\nthe morning and return by evening with a wagon load of buffalo meat.\"\r\n\r\nUnquestionably a great many thousand buffaloes were killed annually by\r\nthe settlers of Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado, and\r\nthe mountain Indians living west of the great range. The number so slain\r\ncan only be guessed at, for there is absolutely no data on which to\r\nfound an estimate. Judging merely from the number of people within reach\r\nof the range, it may safely be estimated that the total number of\r\nbuffaloes slaughtered annually to satisfy the wants of this\r\nheterogeneous element could not have been less than fifty thousand, and\r\nprobably was a much higher number. This, for the three years, would make\r\none hundred and fifty thousand, and the grand total would therefore be\r\nabout as follows:\r\n\r\n+------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|        _The slaughter of the southern herd._         |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|Killed by \"professional\" white hunters in |           |\r\n|  1872, 1873, and 1874                    | 3,158,730 |\r\n|Killed by Indians, same period            |   390,000 |\r\n|Killed by settlers and mountain Indians   |   150,000 |\r\n|                                          | --------- |\r\n|     Total slaughter in three years       | 3,098,730 |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThese figures seem incredible, but unfortunately there is not the\r\nslightest reason for believing they are too high. There are many men now\r\nliving who declare that during the great slaughter they each killed from\r\ntwenty-five hundred to three thousand buffaloes every year. With\r\nthousands of hunters on the range, and such possibilities of slaughter\r\nbefore each, it is, after all, no wonder that an average of nearly a\r\nmillion and a quarter of buffaloes fell each year during that bloody\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nBy the close of the hunting season of 1875 the great southern herd had\r\nceased to exist. As a body, it had been utterly annihilated. The main\r\nbody of the survivors, numbering about ten thousand head, fled\r\nsouthwest, and dispersed through that great tract of wild, desolate, and\r\ninhospitable country stretching southward from the Cimarron country\r\nacross the \"Public Land Strip,\" the Pan-handle of Texas, and the Llano\r\nEstacado, or Staked Plain, to the Pecos River. A few small bands of\r\nstragglers maintained a precarious existence for a few years longer on\r\nthe headwaters of the Republican River and in southwestern Nebraska,\r\nnear Ogalalla, where calves were caught alive as late as 1885. Wild\r\nbuffaloes were seen in southwestern Kansas for the last time in 1886,\r\nand the two or three score of individuals still living in the Canadian\r\nRiver country of the Texas Pan-handle are the last wild survivors of the\r\ngreat Southern herd.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the fugitives which survived the great slaughter of\r\n1871-'74 continued to attract hunters who were very \"hard up,\" who\r\npursued them, often at the risk of their own lives, even into the\r\nterrible Llano Estacado. In Montana in 1886 I met on a cattle ranch an\r\nex-buffalo-hunter from Texas, named Harry Andrews, who from 1874 to 1876\r\ncontinued in pursuit of the scattered remnants of the great southern\r\nherd through the Pan-handle of Texas and on into the Staked Plain\r\nitself. By that time the market had become completely overstocked with\r\nrobes, and the prices received by Andrews and other hunters was only 65\r\ncents each for cow robes and $1.15 each for bull robes, delivered on the\r\nrange, the purchaser providing for their transportation to the railway.\r\nBut even at those prices, which were so low as to make buffalo killing\r\nseem like downright murder, Mr. Andrews assured me that he \"made big\r\nmoney.\" On one occasion, when he \"got a stand\" on a large bunch of\r\nbuffalo, he fired one hundred and fifteen shots from one spot, and\r\nkilled sixty-three buffaloes in about an hour.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 buffalo hunting as a business ceased forever in the Southwest,\r\nand so far as can be ascertained, but one successful hunt for robes has\r\nbeen made in that region since that time. That occurred in the fall and\r\nwinter of 1887, about 100 miles north of Tascosa, Texas, when two\r\nparties, one of which was under the leadership of Lee Howard, attacked\r\nthe only band of buffaloes left alive in the Southwest, and which at\r\nthat time numbered about two hundred head. The two parties killed\r\nfifty-two buffaloes, of which ten skins were preserved entire for\r\nmounting. Of the remaining forty-two, the heads were cut off and\r\npreserved for mounting and the skins were prepared as robes. The\r\nmountable skins were finally sold at the following prices: Young cows,\r\n$50 to $60; adult cows, $75 to $100; adult bull, $150. The unmounted\r\nheads sold as follows: Young bulls, $25 to $30; adult bulls, $50; young\r\ncows, $10 to $12; adult cows, $15 to $25. A few of the choicest robes\r\nsold at $20 each, and the remainder, a lot of twenty eight, of prime\r\nquality and in excellent condition, were purchased by the Hudson's Bay\r\nFur Company for $350.\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of the great southern herd. In 1871 it contained\r\ncertainly no fewer than three million buffaloes, and by the beginning of\r\n1875 its existence as a herd had utterly ceased, and nothing but\r\nscattered, fugitive bands remained.\r\n\r\n7. _The Destruction of the Northern Herd._--Until the building of the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railway there were but two noteworthy outlets for the\r\nbuffalo robes that were taken annually in the Northwestern Territories\r\nof the United States. The principal one was the Missouri River, and the\r\nYellowstone River was the other. Down these streams the hides were\r\ntransported by steam-boats to the nearest railway shipping point. For\r\nfifty years prior to the building of the Northern Pacific Railway in\r\n1880-'82, the number of robes marketed every year by way of these\r\nstreams was estimated variously at from fifty to one hundred thousand.\r\nA great number of hides taken in the British Possessions fell into the\r\nhands of the Hudson's Bay Company, and found a market in Canada.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1881, the Sioux City (Iowa) _Journal_ contained the following\r\ninformation in regard to the buffalo robe \"crop\" of the previous hunting\r\nseason--the winter of 1880-'81:\r\n\r\n\"It is estimated by competent authorities that one hundred thousand\r\nbuffalo hides will be shipped out of the Yellowstone country this\r\nseason. Two firms alone are negotiating for the transportation of\r\ntwenty-five thousand hides each. * * * Most of our citizens saw the big\r\nload of buffalo hides that the _C. K. Peck_ brought down last season, a\r\nload that hid everything about the boat below the roof of the hurricane\r\ndeck. There were ten thousand hides in that load, and they were all\r\nbrought out of the Yellowstone on one trip and transferred to the _C. K.\r\nPeck_. How such a load could have been piled on the little _Terry_ not\r\neven the men on the boat appear to know. It hid every part of the boat,\r\nbarring only the pilot-house and smoke-stacks. But such a load will not\r\nbe attempted again. For such boats as ply the Yellowstone there are at\r\nleast fifteen full loads of buffalo hides and other pelts. Reckoning one\r\nthousand hides to three car loads, and adding to this fifty cars for the\r\nother pelts, it will take at least three hundred and fifty box-cars to\r\ncarry this stupendous bulk of peltry East to market. These figures are\r\nnot guesses, but estimates made by men whose business it is to know\r\nabout the amount of hides and furs awaiting shipment.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing like it has ever been known in the history of the fur trade.\r\nLast season the output of buffalo hides was above the average, and last\r\nyear only about thirty thousand hides came out of the Yellowstone\r\ncountry, or less than a third of what is there now awaiting shipment The\r\npast severe winter caused the buffalo to bunch themselves in a few\r\nvalleys where there was pasturage, and there the slaughter went on all\r\nwinter. There was no sport about it, simply shooting down the\r\nfamine-tamed animals as cattle might be shot down in a barn-yard. To the\r\ncredit of the Indians it can be said that they killed no more than they\r\ncould save the meat from. The greater part of the slaughter was done by\r\nwhite hunters, or butchers rather, who followed the business of killing\r\nand skinning buffalo by the mouth, leaving the carcasses to rot.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of the great division made by the Union Pacific Railway the\r\nnorthern body of buffalo extended from the valley of the Platte River\r\nnorthward to the southern shore of Great Slave Lake, eastward almost to\r\nMinnesota, and westward to an elevation of 8,000 feet in the Rocky\r\nMountains. The herds were most numerous along the central portion of\r\nthis region (see map), and from the Platte Valley to Great Slave Lake\r\nthe range was continuous. The buffalo population of the southern half of\r\nthis great range was, according to all accounts, nearly three times as\r\ngreat as that of the northern half. At that time, or, let us say, 1870,\r\nthere were about four million buffaloes south of the Platte River, and\r\nprobably about one million and a half north of it. I am aware that the\r\nestimate of the number of buffaloes in the great northern herd is\r\nusually much higher than this, but I can see no good grounds for making\r\nit so. To my mind, the evidence is conclusive that, although the\r\nnorthern herd ranged over such an immense area, it was numerically less\r\nthan half the size of the overwhelming multitude which actually crowded\r\nthe southern range, and at times so completely consumed the herbage of\r\nthe plains that detachments of the United States Army found it difficult\r\nto find sufficient grass for their mules and horses.[67]\r\n\r\n[Note 67: As an instance of this, see _Forest and Stream_, vol. II,\r\np. 184: \"Horace Jones, the interpreter here [Fort Sill], says that on\r\nhis first trip along the line of the one hundredth meridian, in 1859,\r\naccompanying Major Thomas--since our noble old general--they passed\r\ncontinuous herds for over 60 miles, which left so little grass behind\r\nthem that Major Thomas was seriously troubled about his horses.\"]\r\n\r\nThe various influences which ultimately led to the complete blotting out\r\nof the great northern herd were exerted about as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the British Possessions, where the country was immense and game of\r\nall kinds except buffalo very scarce indeed; where, in the language of\r\nProfessor Kenaston, the explorer, \"there was a great deal of country\r\naround every wild animal,\" the buffalo constituted the main dependence\r\nof the Indians, who would not cultivate the soil at all, and of the\r\nhalf-breeds, who would not so long as they could find buffalo. Under\r\nsuch circumstances the buffaloes of the British Possessions were hunted\r\nmuch more vigorously and persistently than those of the United States,\r\nwhere there was such an abundant supply of deer, elk, antelope, and\r\nother game for the Indians to feed upon, and a paternal government to\r\nsupport them with annuities besides. Quite contrary to the prevailing\r\nidea of the people of the United States, viz., that there were great\r\nherds of buffaloes in existence in the Saskatchewan country long after\r\nours had all been destroyed, the herds of British America had been\r\nalmost totally exterminated by the time the final slaughter of our\r\nnorthern herd was inaugurated by the opening of the Northern Pacific\r\nRailway in 1880. The Canadian Pacific Railway played no part whatever in\r\nthe extermination of the bison in the British Possessions, for it had\r\nalready taken place. The half-breeds of Manitoba, the Plains Crees of\r\nQu'Appelle, and the Blackfeet of the South Saskatchewan country swept\r\nbare a great belt of country stretching east and west between the Rocky\r\nMountains and Manitoba. The Canadian Pacific Railway found only\r\nbleaching bones in the country through which it passed. The buffalo had\r\ndisappeared from that entire region before 1879 and left the Blackfeet\r\nIndians on the verge of starvation. A few thousand buffaloes still\r\nremained in the country around the headwaters of the Battle River,\r\nbetween the North and South Saskatchewan, but they were surrounded and\r\nattacked from all sides, and their numbers diminished very rapidly until\r\nall were killed.\r\n\r\nThe latest information I have been able to obtain in regard to the\r\ndisappearance of this northern band has been kindly furnished by Prof.\r\nC. A. Kenaston, who in 1881, and also in 1883, made a thorough\r\nexploration of the country between Winnipeg and Fort Edmonton for the\r\nCanadian Pacific Railway Company. His four routes between the two points\r\nnamed covered a vast scope of country, several hundred miles in width.\r\nIn 1881, at Moose Jaw, 75 miles southeast of The Elbow of the South\r\nSaskatchewan, he saw a party of Cree Indians, who had just arrived from\r\nthe northwest with several carts laden with fresh buffalo meat. At Fort\r\nSaskatchewan, on the North Saskatchewan River, just above Edmonton, he\r\nsaw a party of English sportsmen who had recently been hunting on the\r\nBattle and Red Deer Rivers, between Edmonton and Fort Kalgary, where\r\nthey had found buffaloes, and killed as many as they cared to slaughter.\r\nIn one afternoon they killed fourteen, and could have killed more had\r\nthey been more blood-thirsty. In 1883 Professor Kenaston found the fresh\r\ntrail of a band of twenty-five or thirty buffaloes at The Elbow of the\r\nSouth Saskatchewan. Excepting in the above instances he saw no further\r\ntraces of buffalo, nor did he hear of the existence of any in all the\r\ncountry he explored. In 1881 he saw many Cree Indians at Fort Qu'Appelle\r\nin a starving condition, and there was no pemmican or buffalo meat at\r\nthe fort. In 1883, however, a little pemmican found its way to Winnipeg,\r\nwhere it sold at 15 cents per pound; an exceedingly high price. It had\r\nbeen made that year, evidently in the mouth of April, as he purchased it\r\nin May for his journey.\r\n\r\nThe first really alarming impression made on our northern herd was by\r\nthe Sioux Indians, who very speedily exterminated that portion of it\r\nwhich had previously covered the country lying between the North Platte\r\nand a line drawn from the center of Wyoming to the center of Dakota. All\r\nalong the Missouri River from Bismarck to Fort Benton, and along the\r\nYellowstone to the head of navigation, the slaughter went bravely on.\r\nAll the Indian tribes of that vast region--Sioux, Cheyennes, Crows,\r\nBlackfeet, Bloods, Piegans, Assinniboines, Gros Ventres, and\r\nShoshones--found their most profitable business and greatest pleasure\r\n(next to scalping white settlers) in hunting the buffalo. It took from\r\neight to twelve buffalo hides to make a covering for one ordinary\r\nteepee, and sometimes a single teepee of extra size required from twenty\r\nto twenty-five hides.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of our northwestern Territories marketed about seventy-five\r\nthousand buffalo robes every year so long as the northern herd was large\r\nenough to afford the supply. If we allow that for every skin sold to\r\nwhite traders four others were used in supplying their own wants, which\r\nmust be considered a very moderate estimate, the total number of\r\nbuffaloes slaughtered annually by those tribes must have been about\r\nthree hundred and seventy-five thousand.\r\n\r\nThe end which so many observers had for years been predicting really\r\nbegan (with the northern herd) in 1876, two years after the great\r\nannihilation which had taken place in the South, although it was not\r\nuntil four years later that the slaughter became universal over the\r\nentire range. It is very clearly indicated in the figures given in a\r\nletter from Messrs. I. G. Baker & Co., of Fort Benton, Montana, to the\r\nwriter, dated October 6, 1887, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"There were sent East from the year 1876 from this point about\r\nseventy-five thousand buffalo robes. In 1880 it had fallen to about\r\ntwenty thousand, in 1883 not more than five thousand, and in 1884 none\r\nwhatever. We are sorry we can not give you a better record, but the\r\ncollection of hides which exterminated the buffalo was from the\r\nYellowstone country on the Northern Pacific, instead of northern\r\nMontana.\"\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the final slaughter of our northern herd may be dated\r\nabout 1880, by which time the annual robe crop of the Indians had\r\ndiminished three-fourths, and when summer killing for hairless hides\r\nbegan on a large scale. The range of this herd was surrounded on three\r\nsides by tribes of Indians, armed with breech-loading rifles and\r\nabundantly supplied with fixed ammunition. Up to the year 1880 the\r\nIndians of the tribes previously mentioned killed probably three times\r\nas many buffaloes as did the white hunters, and had there not been a\r\nwhite hunter in the whole Northwest the buffalo would have been\r\nexterminated there just as surely, though not so quickly by perhaps ten\r\nyears, as actually occurred. Along the north, from the Missouri River to\r\nthe British line, and from the reservation in northwestern Dakota to the\r\nmain divide of the Rocky Mountains, a distance of 550 miles as the crow\r\nflies, the country was one continuous Indian reservation, inhabited by\r\neight tribes, who slaughtered buffalo in season and out of season, in\r\nwinter for robes and in summer for hides and meat to dry. In the\r\nSoutheast was the great body of Sioux, and on the Southwest the Crows\r\nand Northern Cheyennes, all engaged in the same relentless warfare. It\r\nwould have required a body of armed men larger than the whole United\r\nStates Army to have withstood this continuous hostile pressure without\r\nultimate annihilation.\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered, therefore, that the American Indian is as much\r\nresponsible for the extermination of our northern herd of bison as the\r\nAmerican citizen. I have yet to learn of an instance wherein an Indian\r\nrefrained from excessive slaughter of game through motives of economy,\r\nor care for the future, or prejudice against wastefulness. From all\r\naccounts the quantity of game killed by an Indian has always been\r\nlimited by two conditions only--lack of energy to kill more, or lack of\r\nmore game to be killed. White men delight in the chase, and kill for the\r\n\"sport\" it yields, regardless of the effort involved. Indeed, to a\r\ngenuine sportsman, nothing in hunting is \"sport\" which is not obtained\r\nat the cost of great labor. An Indian does not view the matter in that\r\nlight, and when he has killed enough to supply his wants, he stops,\r\nbecause he sees no reason why he should exert himself any further. This\r\nhas given rise to the statement, so often repeated, that the Indian\r\nkilled only enough buffaloes to supply his wants. If an Indian ever\r\nattempted, or even showed any inclination, to husband the resources of\r\nnature in any way, and restrain wastefulness on _the part of Indians_,\r\nit would be gratifying to know of it.\r\n\r\nThe building of the Northern Pacific Railway across Dakota and Montana\r\nhastened the end that was fast approaching; but it was only an incident\r\nin the annihilation of the northern herd. Without it the final result\r\nwould have been just the same, but the end would probably not have been\r\nreached until about 1888.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific Railway reached Bismarck, Dakota, on the Missouri\r\nRiver, in the year 1876, and from that date onward received for\r\ntransportation eastward all the buffalo robes and hides that came down\r\nthe two rivers, Missouri and Yellowstone.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Northern Pacific Railway Company kept no separate\r\naccount of its buffalo product business, and is unable to furnish a\r\nstatement of the number of hides and robes it handled. It is therefore\r\nimpossible to even make an estimate of the total number of buffaloes\r\nkilled on the northern range during the six years which ended with the\r\nannihilation of that herd.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the business done by the Northern Pacific Railway, and the\r\nprecise points from whence the bulk of the robes were shipped, the\r\nfollowing letter from Mr. J. M. Hannaford, traffic manager of the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad, under date of September 3, 1887, is of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"Your communication, addressed to President Harris, has been referred to\r\nme for the information desired.\r\n\r\n\"I regret that our accounts are not so kept as to enable me to furnish\r\nyou accurate data; but I have been able to obtain the following general\r\ninformation, which may prove of some value to you:\r\n\r\n\"From the years 1876 and 1880 our line did not extend beyond Bismarck,\r\nwhich was the extreme easterly shipping point for buffalo robes and\r\nhides, they being brought down the Missouri River from the north for\r\nshipment from that point. In the years 1876, 1877, 1878, and 1879 there\r\nwere handled at that point yearly from three to four thousand bales of\r\nrobes, about one-half the bales containing ten robes and the other half\r\ntwelve robes each. During these years practically no hides were shipped.\r\nIn 1880 the shipment of hides, dry and untanned, commenced,[68] and in\r\n1881 and 1882 our line was extended west, and the shipping points\r\nincreased, reaching as far west as Terry and Sully Springs, in Montana.\r\nDuring these years, 1880, 1881, and 1882, which practically finished the\r\nshipments of hides and robes, it is impossible for me to give you any\r\njust idea of the number shipped. The only figures obtainable are those\r\nof 1881, when over seventy-five thousand dry and untanned buffalo hides\r\ncame down the river for shipment from Bismarck. Some robes were also\r\nshipped from this point that year, and a considerable number of robes\r\nand hides were shipped from several other shipping points.\r\n\r\n[Note 68: It is to be noted that hairless hides, _taken from buffaloes\r\nkilled in summer_, are what the writer refers to. It was not until 1881,\r\nwhen the end was very near, that hunting buffalo in summer as well as\r\nwinter became a wholesale business. What hunting can be more disgraceful\r\nthan the slaughter of females and young _in summer_, when skins are\r\nalmost worthless.]\r\n\r\n\"The number of pounds of buffalo meat shipped over our line has never\r\ncut any figure, the bulk of the meat having been left on the prairie, as\r\nnot being of sufficient value to pay the cost of transportation.\r\n\r\n\"The names of the extreme eastern and western stations from which\r\nshipments were made are as follows: In 1880, Bismarck was the only\r\nshipping point. In 1881, Glendive, Bismarck, and Beaver Creek. In 1882,\r\nTerry and Sully Springs, Montana, were the chief shipping points, and in\r\nthe order named, so far as numbers and amount of shipments are\r\nconcerned. Bismarck on the east and Forsyth on the west were the two\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\n\"Up to the year 1880, so long as buffalo were killed only for robes, the\r\nbands did not decrease very materially; but beginning with that year,\r\nwhen they were killed for their hides as well, a most indiscriminate\r\nslaughter commenced, and from that time on they disappeared very\r\nrapidly. Up to the year 1881 there were two large bands, one south of\r\nthe Yellowstone and the other north of that river. In the year mentioned\r\nthose south of the river were driven north and never returned, having\r\njoined the northern band, and become practically extinguished.\r\n\r\n\"Since 1882 there have, of course, been occasional shipments both of\r\nhides and robes, but in such small quantities and so seldom that they\r\ncut practically no figure, the bulk of them coming probably from north\r\nMissouri points down the river to Bismarck.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the northern buffalo range embraced the following streams; The\r\nMissouri and all its tributaries, from Port Shaw, Montana, to Fort\r\nBennett, Dakota, and the Yellowstone and all its tributaries. Of this\r\nregion, Miles City, Montana, was the geographical center. The grass was\r\ngood over the whole of it, and the various divisions of the great herd\r\nwere continually shifting from one locality to another, often making\r\njourneys several hundred miles at a time. Over the whole of this vast\r\narea their bleaching bones lie scattered (where they have not as yet\r\nbeen gathered up for sale) from the Upper Marias and Milk Rivers, near\r\nthe British boundary, to the Platte, and from the James River, in\r\ncentral Dakota, to an elevation of 8,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains.\r\nIndeed, as late as October, 1887, I gathered up on the open common,\r\nwithin half a mile of the Northern Pacific Railway depot at the city of\r\nHelena, the skull, horns, and numerous odd bones of a large bull buffalo\r\nwhich had been killed there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE THE MILLIONS HAVE GONE. From a painting by J. H.\r\nMoser in the National Museum.]\r\n\r\nOver many portions of the northern range the traveler may even now ride\r\nfor days together without once being out of sight of buffalo\r\ncarcasses, or bones. Such was the case in 1886 in the country lying\r\nbetween the Missouri and the Yellowstone, northwest of Miles City. Go\r\nwherever we might, on divides, into bad lands, creek bottoms, or on the\r\nhighest plateaus, we always found the inevitable and omnipresent grim\r\nand ghastly skeleton, with hairy head, dried-up and shriveled nostrils,\r\nhalf-skinned legs stretched helplessly upon the gray turf, and the bones\r\nof the body bleached white as chalk.\r\n\r\nThe year 1881 witnessed the same kind of a stampede for the northern\r\nbuffalo range that occurred just ten years previously in the south. At\r\nthat time robes were worth from two to three times as much as they ever\r\nhad been in the south, the market was very active, and the successful\r\nhunter was sure to reap a rich reward as long as the buffaloes lasted.\r\nAt that time the hunters and hide-buyers estimated that there were five\r\nhundred thousand buffaloes within a radius of 150 miles of Miles City,\r\nand that there were still in the entire northern herd not far from one\r\nmillion head. The subsequent slaughter proved that these estimates were\r\nprobably not far from the truth. In that year Fort Custer was so nearly\r\noverwhelmed by a passing herd that a detachment of soldiers was ordered\r\nout to turn the herd away from the post. In 1882 an immense herd\r\nappeared on the high, level plateau on the north side of the Yellowstone\r\nwhich overlooks Miles City and Fort Keogh in the valley below. A squad\r\nof soldiers from the Fifth Infantry was sent up on the bluff, and in\r\nless than an hour had killed enough buffaloes to load six four-mule\r\nteams with meat. In 1886 there were still about twenty bleaching\r\nskeletons lying in a group on the edge of this plateau at the point\r\nwhere the road from the ferry reaches the level, but all the rest had\r\nbeen gathered up.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 there were, so it is estimated by men who were in the country,\r\nno fewer than five thousand white hunters and skinners on the northern\r\nrange. Lieut. J. M. T. Partello declares that \"a cordon of camps, from\r\nthe Upper Missouri, where it bends to the west, stretched toward the\r\nsetting sun as far as the dividing line of Idaho, completely blocking in\r\nthe great ranges of the Milk River, the Musselshell, Yellowstone, and\r\nthe Marias, and rendering it impossible for scarcely a single bison to\r\nescape through the chain of sentinel camps to the Canadian northwest.\r\nHunters of Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado drove the poor hunted animals\r\nnorth, directly into the muzzles of the thousands of repeaters ready to\r\nreceive them. * * * Only a few short years ago, as late as 1883, a herd\r\nof about seventy-five thousand crossed the Yellowstone River a few miles\r\nsouth of here [Fort Keogh], scores of Indians, pot-hunters, and white\r\nbutchers on their heels, bound for the Canadian dominions, where they\r\nhoped to find a haven of safety. Alas! not five thousand of that mighty\r\nmass ever lived to reach the British border line.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say (at least to the satisfaction of old hunters)\r\nwhich were the most famous hunting grounds on the northern range.\r\nLieutenant Partello states that when he hunted in the great triangle\r\nbounded by the three rivers, Missouri, Musselshell, and Yellowstone, it\r\ncontained, to the best of his knowledge and belief, two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand buffaloes. Unquestionably that region yielded an immense\r\nnumber of buffalo robes, and since the slaughter _thousands of tons_ of\r\nbones have been gathered up there. Another favorite locality was the\r\ncountry lying between the Powder River and the Little Missouri,\r\nparticularly the valleys of Beaver and O'Fallon Creeks. Thither went\r\nscores of \"outfits\" and hundreds of hunters and skinners from the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railway towns from Miles City to Glendive. The hunters\r\nfrom the towns between Glendive and Bismarck mostly went south to Cedar\r\nCreek and the Grand and Moreau Rivers. But this territory was also the\r\nhunting ground of the Sioux Indians from the great reservation farther\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThousands upon thousands of buffaloes were killed on the Milk and Marias\r\nRivers, in the Judith Basin, and in northern Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe method of slaughter has already been fully described under the head\r\nof \"the still-hunt,\" and need not be recapitulated. It is some\r\ngratification to know that the shocking and criminal wastefulness which\r\nwas so marked a feature of the southern butchery was almost wholly\r\nunknown in the north. Robes were worth from $1.50 to $3.50, according to\r\nsize and quality, and were removed and preserved with great care. Every\r\none hundred robes marketed represented not more than one hundred and ten\r\ndead buffaloes, and even this small percentage of loss was due to the\r\nescape of wounded animals which afterward died and were devoured by the\r\nwolves. After the skin was taken off the hunter or skinner stretched it\r\ncarefully upon the ground, inside uppermost, cut his initials in the\r\nadherent subcutaneous muscle, and left it until the season for hauling\r\nin the robes, which was always done in the early spring, immediately\r\nfollowing the hunt.\r\n\r\nAs was the case in the south, it was the ability of a single hunter to\r\ndestroy an entire bunch of buffalo in a single day that completely\r\nannihilated the remaining thousands of the northern herd before the\r\npeople of the United States even learned what was going on. For example,\r\none hunter of my acquaintance, Vic. Smith, the most famous hunter in\r\nMontana, killed one hundred and seven buffaloes in one \"stand,\" in about\r\none hour's time, and without shifting his point of attack. This occurred\r\nin the Red Water country, about 100 miles northeast of Miles City, in\r\nthe winter of 1881-'82. During the same season another hunter, named\r\n\"Doc.\" Aughl, killed eighty-five buffaloes at one \"stand,\" and John\r\nEdwards killed seventy-five. The total number that Smith claims to have\r\nkilled that season is \"about five thousand.\" Where buffaloes were at all\r\nplentiful, every man who called himself a hunter was expected to kill\r\nbetween one and two thousand during the hunting season--from November to\r\nFebruary--and when the buffaloes were to be found it was a comparatively\r\neasy thing to do.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1882 the thousands of bison that still remained alive\r\non the range indicated above, and also marked out on the accompanying\r\nmap, were distributed over that entire area very generally. In February\r\nof that year a Fort Benton correspondent of _Forest and Stream_ wrote as\r\nfollows: \"It is truly wonderful how many buffalo are still left.\r\nThousands of Indians and hundreds of white men depend on them for a\r\nliving. At present nearly all the buffalo in Montana are between Milk\r\nRiver and Bear Paw Mountains. There are only a few small bands between\r\nthe Missouri and the Yellowstone.\" There were plenty of buffalo on the\r\nUpper Marias River in October, 1882. In November and December there were\r\nthousands between the Missouri and the Yellowstone Rivers. South of the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railway the range during the hunting season of 1882-'83\r\nwas thus defined by a hunter who has since written out the \"Confessions\r\nof a Buffalo Butcher\" for _Forest and Stream_ (vol. xxiv, p. 489): \"Then\r\n[October, 1882] the western limit was defined in a general way by Powder\r\nRiver, and extending eastward well toward the Missouri and south to\r\nwithin 60 or 70 miles of the Black Hills. It embraces the valleys of all\r\ntributaries to Powder River from the east, all of the valleys of Beaver\r\nCreek, O'Fallon Creek, and the Little Missouri and Moreau Rivers, and\r\nboth forks of the Cannon Ball for almost half their length. This immense\r\nterritory, lying almost equally in Montana and Dakota, had been occupied\r\nduring the winters by many thousands of buffaloes from time immemorial,\r\nand many of the cows remained during the summer and brought forth their\r\nyoung undisturbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe three hunters composing the party whose record is narrated in the\r\ninteresting sketch referred to, went out from Miles City on October 23,\r\n1882, due east to the bad lands between the Powder River and O'Fallon\r\nCreek, and were on the range all winter. They found comparatively few\r\nbuffaloes, and secured only two hundred and eighty-six robes, which they\r\nsold at an average price of $2.20 each. They saved and marketed a large\r\nquantity of meat, for which they obtained 3 cents per pound. They found\r\nthe whole region in which they hunted fairly infested with Indians and\r\nhalf-breeds, all hunting buffalo.\r\n\r\nThe hunting season which began in October, 1882, and ended in February,\r\n1883, finished the annihilation of the great northern herd, and left but\r\na few small bauds of stragglers, numbering only a very few thousand\r\nindividuals all told. A noted event of the season was the retreat\r\nnorthward across the Yellowstone of the immense herd mentioned by\r\nLieutenant Partello as containing seventy-five thousand head; others\r\nestimated the number at fifty thousand; and the event is often spoken of\r\nto-day by frontiersmen who were in that region at the time. Many think\r\nthat the whole great body went north into British territory, and that\r\nthere is still a goodly remnant of it in some remote region between the\r\nPeace River and the Saskatchewan, or somewhere there, which will yet\r\nreturn to the United States. Nothing could be more illusory than this\r\nbelief. In the first place, the herd never reached the British line,\r\nand, if it had, it would have been promptly annihilated by the hungry\r\nBlackfeet and Cree Indians, who were declared to be in a half-starved\r\ncondition, through the disappearance of the buffalo, as early as 1879.\r\n\r\nThe great herd that \"went north\" was utterly extinguished by the white\r\nhunters along the Missouri River and the Indians living north of it. The\r\nonly vestige of it that remained was a band of about two hundred\r\nindividuals that took refuge in the labyrinth of ravines and creek\r\nbottoms that lie west of the Musselshell between Flat Willow and Box\r\nElder Creeks, and another band of about seventy-five which settled in\r\nthe bad lands between the head of the Big Dry and Big Porcupine Creeks,\r\nwhere a few survivors were found by the writer in 1886.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Northern Pacific Railway, a band of about three hundred\r\nsettled permanently in and around the Yellowstone National Park, but in\r\na very short time every animal outside of the protected limits of the\r\npark was killed, and whenever any of the park buffaloes strayed beyond\r\nthe boundary they too were promptly killed for their heads and hides. At\r\npresent the number remaining in the park is believed by Captain Harris,\r\nthe superintendent, to be about two hundred; about one-third of which is\r\ndue to breeding in the protected territory.\r\n\r\nIn the southeast the fate of that portion of the herd is well known. The\r\nherd which at the beginning of the hunting season of 1883 was known to\r\ncontain about ten thousand head, and ranged in western Dakota, about\r\nhalf way between the Black Hills and Bismarck, between the Moreau and\r\nGrand Rivers, was speedily reduced to about one thousand head. Vic.\r\nSmith, who was \"in at the death,\" says there were eleven hundred, others\r\nsay twelve hundred. Just at this juncture (October, 1883) Sitting Bull\r\nand his whole band of nearly one thousand braves arrived from the\r\nStanding Sock Agency, and in two days' time slaughtered the entire herd.\r\nVic. Smith and a host of white hunters took part in the killing of this\r\nlast ten thousand, and he declares that \"when we got through the hunt\r\nthere was not a hoof left. That wound up the buffalo in the Far West,\r\nonly a stray bull being seen here and there afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, not even the buffalo hunters themselves were at the\r\ntime aware of the fact that the end of the hunting season of 1882-'83\r\nwas also the end of the buffalo, at least as an inhabitant of the plains\r\nand a source of revenue. In the autumn of 1883 they nearly all outfitted\r\nas usual, often at an expense of many hundreds of dollars, and blithely\r\nsought \"the range\" that had up to that time been so prolific in robes.\r\nThe end was in nearly every case the same--total failure and bankruptcy.\r\nIt was indeed hard to believe that not only the millions, but also the\r\nthousands, had actually gone, and forever.\r\n\r\nI have found it impossible to ascertain definitely the number of robes\r\nand hides shipped from the northern range during the last years of the\r\nslaughter, and the only reliable estimate I have obtained was made for\r\nme, alter much consideration and reflection, by Mr. J. N. Davis, of\r\nMinneapolis, Minnesota. Mr. Davis was for many years a buyer of furs,\r\nrobes, and hides on a large scale throughout our Northwestern\r\nTerritories, and was actively engaged in buying up buffalo robes as long\r\nas there were any to buy. In reply to a letter asking for statistics, he\r\nwrote me as follows, on September 27, 1887:\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to give the exact number of robes and hides shipped\r\nout of Dakota and Montana from 1876 to 1883, or the exact number of\r\nbuffalo in the northern herd; but I will give you as correct an account\r\nas any one can. In 1876 it was estimated that there were half a million\r\nbuffaloes within a radius of 150 miles of Miles City. In 1881 the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad was built as far west as Glendive and Miles\r\nCity. At that time the whole country was a howling wilderness, and\r\nIndians and wild buffalo were too numerous to mention. The first\r\nshipment of buffalo robes, killed by white men, was made that year, and\r\nthe stations on the Northern Pacific Railroad between Miles City and\r\nMandan sent out about fifty thousand hides and robes. In 1882 the number\r\nof hides and robes bought and shipped was about two hundred thousand,\r\nand in 1883 forty thousand. In 1884 I shipped from Dickinson, Dakota\r\nTerritory, the only car load of robes that went East that year, and it\r\nwas the last shipment ever made.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time the majority of the ex-hunters cherished the fond\r\ndelusion that the great herd had only \"gone north\" into the British\r\nPossessions, and would eventually return in great force. Scores of\r\nrumors of the finding of herds floated about, all of which were eagerly\r\nbelieved at first. But after a year or two had gone by without the\r\nappearance of a single buffalo, and likewise without any reliable\r\ninformation of the existence of a herd of any size, even in British\r\nterritory, the butchers of the buffalo either hung up their old Sharps\r\nrifles, or sold them for nothing to the gun-dealers, and sought other\r\nmeans of livelihood. Some took to gathering up buffalo bones and selling\r\nthem by the ton, and others became cowboys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE BISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of the buffalo down to the very point of extermination has\r\nbeen so very generally condemned, and the general Government has been so\r\nunsparingly blamed for allowing such a massacre to take place on the\r\npublic domain, it is important that the public should know all the facts\r\nin the case. To the credit of Congress it must be said that several very\r\ndetermined efforts were made between the years 1871 and 1876 looking\r\ntoward the protection of the buffalo. The failure of all those\r\nwell-meant efforts was due to our republican form of Government. Had\r\nthis Government been a monarchy the buffalo would have been protected;\r\nbut unfortunately in this case (perhaps the only one on record wherein a\r\nking could have accomplished more than the representatives of the\r\npeople) the necessary act of Congress was so hedged in and beset by\r\nobstacles that it never became an accomplished fact. Even when both\r\nhouses of Congress succeeded in passing a suitable act (June 23, 1874)\r\nit went to the President in the last days of the session only to be\r\npigeon-holed, and die a natural death.\r\n\r\nThe following is a complete history of Congressional legislation in\r\nregard to the protection of the buffalo from wanton slaughter and\r\nultimate extinction. The first step taken in behalf of this persecuted\r\nanimal was on March 13, 1871, when Mr. McCormick, of Arizona, introduced\r\na bill (H. R. 157), which was ordered to be printed. Nothing further was\r\ndone with it. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted, etc._, That, excepting for the purpose of using the meat\r\nfor food or preserving the akin, it shall be unlawful for any person to\r\nkill the bison, or buffalo, found anywhere upon the public lands of the\r\nUnited States; and for the violation of this law the offender shall,\r\nupon conviction before any court of competent jurisdiction, be liable to\r\na fine of $100 for each animal killed, one-half of which sum shall, upon\r\nits collection, be paid to the informer.\r\n\r\nOn February 14, 1872, Mr. Cole, of California, introduced in the Senate\r\nthe following resolution, which was considered by unanimous consent and\r\nagreed to:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the Committee on Territories be directed to inquire\r\ninto the expediency of enacting a law for the protection of the buffalo,\r\nelk, antelope, and other useful animals running wild in the Territories\r\nof the United States against indiscriminate slaughter and extermination,\r\nand that they report by bill or otherwise.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 1872, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, introduced a bill in\r\nthe Senate (S. 655) restricting the killing of the buffalo upon the\r\npublic lauds; which was read twice by its title and referred to the\r\nCommittee on Territories.\r\n\r\nOn April 5, 1872, Mr. B. C. McCormick, of Arizona, made a speech in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, while it was in Committee of the Whole, on the\r\nrestriction of the killing of buffalo.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned a then recent number of _Harper's Weekly_, in which were\r\nillustrations of the slaughter of buffalo, and also read a partly\r\nhistorical extract in regard to the same. He related how, when he was\r\nonce snow-bound upon the Kansas Pacific Railroad, the buffalo furnished\r\nfood for himself and fellow-passengers. Then he read the bill introduced\r\nby him March 13, 1871, and also copies of letters furnished him by Henry\r\nBergh, president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty\r\nto Animals, which were sent to the latter by General W. B. Hazen, Lieut.\r\nCol. A. G. Brackett, and E. W. Wynkoop. He also read a statement by\r\nGeneral Hazen to the effect that he knew of a man who killed ninety-nine\r\nbuffaloes with his own hand in one day. He also spoke on the subject of\r\ncross-breeding the buffalo with common cattle, and read an extract in\r\nregard to it from the San Francisco _Post_.[69]\r\n\r\n[Note 69: Congressional Globe (Appendix), second session Forty-second\r\nCongress.]\r\n\r\nOn April 6, 1872, Mr. McCormick asked leave to have printed in the\r\nGlobe some remarks he had prepared regarding restricting the killing of\r\nbuffalo, which was granted.[70]\r\n\r\n[Note 70: Congressional Globe, April 6, 1872, Forty-second Congress,\r\nsecond session.]\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 1874, Mr. Fort, of Illinois, introduced a bill (H. R. 921)\r\nto prevent the useless slaughter of buffalo within the Territories of\r\nthe United States; which was read and referred to the Committee on the\r\nTerritories.[71]\r\n\r\n[Note 71: Congressional Record, vol. 2, part 1, Forty-third Congress,\r\np. 371.]\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 1874, this bill was reported to the House from the\r\nCommittee on the Territories, with a recommendation that it be\r\npassed.[72]\r\n\r\n[Note 72: Congressional Record, vol. 2, part 3, Forty-third Congress,\r\nfirst session, pp. 2105, 2109.]\r\n\r\nThe first section of the bill provided that it shall be unlawful for any\r\nperson, who is not an Indian, to kill, wound, or in any way destroy any\r\nfemale buffalo of any age, found at large within the boundaries of any\r\nof the Territories of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe second section provided that it shall be, in like manner, unlawful\r\nfor any such person to kill, wound, or destroy in said Territories any\r\ngreater number of male buffaloes than are needed for food by such\r\nperson, or than can be used, cured, or preserved for the food of other\r\npersons, or for the market. It shall in like manner be unlawful for any\r\nsuch person, or persons, to assist, or be in any manner engaged or\r\nconcerned in or about such unlawful killing, wounding, or destroying of\r\nany such buffaloes; that any person who shall violate the provisions of\r\nthe act shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay to the United States the\r\nsum of $100 for each offense (and each buffalo so unlawfully killed,\r\nwounded, or destroyed shall be and constitute a separate offense), and\r\non a conviction of a second offense may be committed to prison for a\r\nperiod not exceeding thirty days; and that all United States judges,\r\njustices, courts, and legal tribunals in said Territories shall have\r\njurisdiction in cases of the violation of the law.\r\n\r\nMr. Cox said he had been told by old hunters that it was impossible to\r\ntell the sex of a running buffalo; and he also stated that the bill gave\r\npreference to the Indians.\r\n\r\nMr. Fort said the object was to prevent early extermination; that\r\nthousands were annually slaughtered for skins alone, and thousands for\r\ntheir tongues alone; that perhaps hundreds of thousands are killed every\r\nyear in utter wantonness, with no object for such destruction. He had\r\nbeen told that the sexes could be distinguished while they were\r\nrunning.[73]\r\n\r\n[Note 73: I know of no greater affront that could be offered to the\r\nintelligence of a genuine buffalo-hunter than to accuse him of not\r\nknowing enough to tell the sex of a buffalo \"on the run\" by its form\r\nalone.--W. T. H.]\r\n\r\nThis bill does not prohibit any person joining in a reasonable chase and\r\nhunt of the buffalo.\r\n\r\nSaid Mr. Fort, \"So far as I am advised, gentlemen upon this floor\r\nrepresenting all the Territories are favorable to the passage of this\r\nbill.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cox wanted the clause excepting the Indians from the operations of\r\nthe bill stricken out, and stated that the Secretary of the Interior had\r\nalready said to the House that the civilization of the Indian was\r\nImpossible while the buffalo remained on the plains.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk read for Mr. McCormick the following extract from the _New\r\nMexican_, a paper published in Santa Fé:\r\n\r\nThe buffalo slaughter, which has been going on the past few years on the\r\nplains, and which increases every year, is wantonly wicked, and should\r\nbe stopped by the most stringent enactments and most vigilant\r\nenforcements of the law. Killing these noble animals for their hides\r\nsimply, or to gratify the pleasure of some Russian duke or English lord,\r\nis a species of vandalism which can not too quickly be checked. United\r\nStates surveying parties report that there are two thousand hunters on\r\nthe plains killing these animals for their hides. One party of sixteen\r\nhunters report having killed twenty-eight thousand buffaloes during the\r\npast summer. It seems to us there is quite as much reason why the\r\nGovernment should protect the buffaloes as the Indians.\r\n\r\nMr. McCormick considered the subject important, and had not a doubt of\r\nthe fearful slaughter. He read the following extract from a letter that\r\nhe had received from General Hazen:\r\n\r\nI know a man who killed with his own hand ninety-nine buffaloes in one\r\nday, without taking a pound of the meat. The buffalo for food has an\r\nintrinsic value about equal to an average Texas beef, or say $20. There\r\nare probably not less than a million of these animals on the western\r\nplains. If the Government owned a herd of a million oxen they would at\r\nleast take steps to prevent this wanton slaughter. The railroads have\r\nmade the buffalo so accessible as to present a case not dissimilar.\r\n\r\nHe agreed with Mr. Cox that some features of the bill would probably be\r\nimpracticable, and moved to amend it. He did not believe any bill would\r\nentirely accomplish the purpose, but he desired that such wanton\r\nslaughter should be stopped.\r\n\r\nSaid he, \"It would have been well both for the Indians and the white men\r\nif an enactment of this kind had been placed on our statute-books years\r\nago. * * * I know of no one act that would gratify the red men more.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holman expressed surprise that Mr. Cox should make any objection to\r\nparts of the measure. The former regarded the bill as \"an effort in a\r\nmost commendable direction,\" and trusted that it would pass.\r\n\r\nMr. Cox said he would not have objected to the bill but from the fact\r\nthat it was partial in its provisions. He wanted a bill that would\r\nimpose a penalty on every man, red, white, or black, who may wantonly\r\nkill these buffaloes.\r\n\r\nMr. Potter desired to know whether more buffaloes were slaughtered by\r\nthe Indians than by white men.\r\n\r\nMr. Fort thought the white men were doing the greatest amount of\r\nkilling.\r\n\r\nMr. Eldridge thought there would be just as much propriety in killing\r\nthe fish in our rivers as in destroying the buffalo in order to compel\r\nthe Indians to become civilized.\r\n\r\nMr. Conger said: \"As a matter of fact, every man knows the range of the\r\nbuffalo has grown more and more confined year after year; that they have\r\nbeen driven westward before advancing civilization.\" But he opposed the\r\nbill!\r\n\r\nMr. Hawley, of Connecticut, said: \"I am glad to see this bill. I am in\r\nfavor of this law, and hope it will pass.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lowe favored the bill, and thought that the buffalo ought to be\r\nprotected for proper utility.\r\n\r\nMr. Cobb thought they ought to be protected for the settlers, who\r\ndepended partly on them for food.\r\n\r\nMr. Parker, of Missouri, intimated that the policy of the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior was a sound one, and that the buffaloes ought to be\r\nexterminated, to prevent difficulties in civilizing the Indians.\r\n\r\nSaid Mr. Conger, \"I do not think the measure will tend at all to protect\r\nthe buffalo.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McCormick replied: \"This bill will not prevent the killing of\r\nbuffaloes for any useful purpose, but only their wanton destruction.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kasson said: \"I wish to say one word in support of this bill,\r\nbecause I have had some experience as to the manner in which these\r\nbuffaloes are treated by hunters. The buffalo is a creature of vast\r\nutility, * * *. This animal ought to be protected; * * *.\"\r\n\r\nThe question being taken on the passage of the bill, there were--ayes\r\n132, noes not counted.\r\n\r\nSo the bill was passed.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 1874, this bill (H. R. 921) came up in the Senate.[74]\r\n\r\n[Note 74: Congressional Globe, Vol. 2, part 6, Forty-third Congress,\r\nfirst session.]\r\n\r\nMr. Harvey moved, as an amendment, to strike out the words \"who is not\r\nan Indian.\"\r\n\r\nSaid Mr. Hitchcock, \"That will defeat the bill.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Frelinghuysen said: \"That would prevent the Indians from killing the\r\nbuffalo on their own ground. I object to the bill.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sargent said: \"I think we can pass the bill in the right shape\r\nwithout objection. Let us take it up. It is a very important one.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Frelinghuysen withdrew his objection.\r\n\r\nMr. Harvey thought it was a very important bill, and withdrew his\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nThe bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to a third reading, read\r\nthe third time, and passed. It went to President Grant for signature,\r\nand expired in his hands at the adjournment of that session of Congress.\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 1874, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 1689) to tax\r\nbuffalo hides; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means.\r\n\r\nOn June 10, 1874, Mr. Dawes, from the Committee on Ways and Means,\r\nreported back the bill adversely, and moved that it be laid on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nMr. Fort asked to have the bill referred to the Committee of the\r\nWhole, and it was so referred.\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 1874, Mr. R. C. McCormick, of Arizona, introduced in the\r\nHouse a bill (H. R. 1728) restricting the killing of the bison, or\r\nbuffalo, on the public lands; which was referred to the Committee on the\r\nPublic Lands, and never heard of more.\r\n\r\nOn January 31, 1876, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 1719) to prevent\r\nthe useless slaughter of buffaloes within the Territories of the United\r\nStates, which was referred to the Committee on the Territories.[75]\r\n\r\n[Note 75: Forty-fourth Congress, first session, vol. 4, part 2, pp.\r\n1237-1241.]\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Territories reported back the bill without\r\namendment on February 23, 1876.[76] Its provisions were in every respect\r\nidentical with those of the bill introduced by Mr. Fort in 1874, and\r\nwhich passed both houses.\r\n\r\n[Note 76: Forty-fourth Congress first session, vol. 4, part 1, p. 773.]\r\n\r\nIn support of it Mr. Fort said: \"The intention and object of this bill\r\nis to preserve them [the buffaloes] for the use of the Indians, whose\r\nhomes are upon the public domain, and to the frontiersmen, who may\r\nproperly use them for food. * * * They have been and are now being\r\nslaughtered in large numbers. * * * Thousands of these noble brutes are\r\nannually slaughtered out of mere wontonness. * * * This bill, just as it\r\nis now presented, passed the last Congress. It was not vetoed, but fell,\r\nas I understand, merely for want of time to consider it after having\r\npassed both houses.\" He also intimated that the Government was using a\r\ngreat deal of money for cattle to furnish the Indians, while the buffalo\r\nwas being wantonly destroyed, whereas they might be turned to their\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nMr. Crounse wanted the words \"who is not an Indian\" struck out, so as to\r\nmake the bill general. He thought Indians were to blame for the wanton\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nMr. Fort thought the amendment unnecessary, and stated that he was\r\ninformed that the Indians did not destroy the buffaloes wantonly.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunnell thought the bill one of great importance.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk read for him a letter from A. G. Brackett, lieutenant-colonel,\r\nSecond United States Cavalry, stationed at Omaha Barracks, in which was\r\na very urgent request to have Congress interfere to prevent the\r\nwholesale slaughter then going on.\r\n\r\nMr. Reagan thought the bill proper and right. He knew from personal\r\nexperience how the wanton slaughtering was going on, and also that the\r\nIndians were _not_ the ones who did it.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend, of New York, saw no reason why a white man should not be\r\nallowed to kill a female buffalo as well as an Indian. He said it would\r\nbe impracticable to have a separate law for each.\r\n\r\nMr. Maginnis did not agree with him. He thought the bill ought to pass\r\nas it stood.\r\n\r\nMr. Throckmorton thought that while the intention of the bill was a\r\ngood one, yet it was mischievous and difficult to enforce, and would\r\nalso work hardship to a large portion of our frontier people. He had\r\nseveral objections. He also thought a cow buffalo could not be\r\ndistinguished at a distance.\r\n\r\nMr. Hancock, of Texas, thought the bill an impolicy, and that the sooner\r\nthe buffalo was exterminated the better.\r\n\r\nMr. Fort replied by asking him why all the game--deer, antelope,\r\netc.--was not slaughtered also. Then he went on to state that to\r\nexterminate the buffalo would be to starve innocent children of the red\r\nman, and to make the latter more wild and savage than he was already.\r\n\r\nMr. Baker, of Indiana, offered the following amendment as a substitute\r\nfor the one already offered:\r\n\r\n_Provided_, That any white person who shall employ, hire, or procure,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, any Indian to kill any buffalo forbidden to be\r\nkilled by this act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished\r\nin the manner provided in this act.\r\n\r\nMr. Fort stated that a certain clause in his bill covered the object of\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenks offered the following amendment:\r\n\r\nStrike out in the fourth line of the second section the word \"can\" and\r\ninsert \"shall;\" and in the second line of the same section insert the\r\nword \"wantonly\" before \"kill;\" so that the clause will read:\r\n\r\n\"That it shall be in like manner unlawful for any such person to\r\nwantonly kill, wound, or destroy in the said Territories any greater\r\nnumber of male buffaloes than are needed for food by such person, or\r\nthan shall be used, cured, or preserved for the food of other persons,\r\nor for the market.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Conger said: \"I think the whole bill is unwise. I think it is a\r\nuseless measure.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hancock said: \"I move that the bill and amendment be laid on the\r\ntable.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion to lay the bill upon the table was defeated, and the\r\namendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. Conger called for a division on the passage of the bill. The House\r\ndivided, and there were--ayes 93, noes 48. He then demanded tellers, and\r\nthey reported--ayes 104, noes 36. So the bill was passed.\r\n\r\nOn February 25, 1876, the bill was reported to the Senate, and referred\r\nto the Committee on Territories, from whence it never returned.\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1876, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R. 2767) to tax\r\nbuffalo hides; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means,\r\nand never heard of afterward.\r\n\r\nThis was the last move made in Congress in behalf of the buffalo. The\r\nphilanthropic friends of the frontiersman, the Indian, and of the\r\nbuffalo himself, despaired of accomplishing the worthy object for which\r\nthey had so earnestly and persistently labored, and finally gave up the\r\nfight. At the very time the effort in behalf of buffalo protection was\r\nabandoned the northern herd still flourished, and might have been\r\npreserved from extirpation.\r\n\r\nAt various times the legislatures of a few of the Western States and\r\nTerritories enacted laws vaguely and feebly intended to provide some\r\nsort of protection to the fast disappearing animals. One of the first\r\nwas the game law of Colorado, passed in 1872, which declared that the\r\nkillers of game should not leave any flesh to spoil. The western game\r\nlaws of those days amounted to about as much as they do now; practically\r\nnothing at all. I have never been able to learn of a single instance,\r\nsave in the Yellowstone Park, wherein a western hunter was prevented by\r\nso simple and innocuous a thing as a game law from killing game. Laws\r\nwere enacted, but they were always left to enforce themselves. The idea\r\nof the frontiersman (the average, at least) has always been to kill as\r\nmuch game as possible before some other fellow gets a chance at it, _and\r\nbefore it is all killed off_! So he goes at the game, and as a general\r\nthing kills all he can while it lasts, and with it feeds himself and\r\nfamily, his dogs, and even his hogs, to repletion. I knew one Montana\r\nman north of Miles City who killed for his own use twenty-six black-tail\r\ndeer in one season, and had so much more venison than he could consume\r\nor give away that a great pile of carcasses lay in his yard until spring\r\nand spoiled.\r\n\r\nDuring the existence of the buffalo it was declared by many an\r\nimpossibility to stop or prevent the slaughter. Such an accusation of\r\nweakness and imbecility on the part of the General Government is an\r\ninsult to our strength and resources. The protection of game is now and\r\nalways has been simply a question of money. A proper code of game laws\r\nand a reasonable number of salaried game-wardens, sworn to enforce them\r\nand punish all offenses against them, would have afforded the buffalo as\r\nmuch protection as would have been necessary to his continual existence.\r\nTo be sure, many buffaloes would have been killed on the sly in spite of\r\nlaws to the contrary, but it was wholesale slaughter that wrought the\r\nextermination, and that could easily have been prevented. A tax of 50\r\ncents each on buffalo robes would have maintained a sufficient number of\r\ngame-wardens to have reasonably regulated the killing, and maintained\r\nfor an indefinite period a bountiful source of supply of food, and also\r\nraiment for both the white man of the plains and the Indian. By\r\njudicious management the buffalo could have been made to yield an annual\r\nrevenue equal to that we now receive from the fur-seals--$100,000 per\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nDuring the two great periods of slaughter--1870-'75 and 1880-'84--the\r\nprincipal killing grounds were as well known as the stock-yards of\r\nChicago. Had proper laws been enacted, and had either the general or\r\nterritorial governments entered with determination upon the task of\r\nrestricting the killing of buffaloes to proper limits, their enforcement\r\nwould have been, in the main, as simple and easy as the collection of\r\ntaxes. Of course the solitary hunter in a remote locality would have\r\nbowled over his half dozen buffaloes in secure defiance of the law; but\r\nsuch desultory killing could not have made much impression on the great\r\nmass for many years. The business-like, wholesale slaughter, wherein\r\none hunter would openly kill five thousand buffaloes and market perhaps\r\ntwo thousand hides, could easily have been stopped forever. Buffalo\r\nhides could not have been dealt in clandestinely, for many reasons, and\r\nhad there been no sale for ill-gotten spoils the still-hunter would have\r\ngathered no spoils to sell. It was an undertaking of considerable\r\nmagnitude, and involving a cash outlay of several hundred dollars to\r\nmake up an \"outfit\" of wagons, horses, arms and ammunition, food, etc.,\r\nfor a trip to \"the range\" after buffaloes. It was these wholesale\r\nhunters, both in the North and the South, who exterminated the species,\r\nand to say that all such undertakings could not have been effectually\r\nprevented by law is to accuse our law-makers and law-officers of\r\nimbecility to a degree hitherto unknown. There is nowhere in this\r\ncountry, nor in any of the waters adjacent to it, a living species of\r\nany kind which the United States Government can not fully and\r\nperpetually protect from destruction by human agencies if it chooses to\r\ndo so. The destruction of the buffalo was a loss of wealth perhaps\r\ntwenty times greater than the sum it would have cost to conserve it, and\r\nthis stupendous waste of valuable food and other products was committed\r\nby one class of the American people and permitted by another with a\r\nprodigality and wastefulness which even in the lowest savages would be\r\ninexcusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. COMPLETENESS OF THE EXTERMINATION.\r\n\r\n(May 1, 1889.)\r\n\r\nAlthough the existence of a few widely-scattered individuals enables us\r\nto say that the bison is not yet absolutely extinct in a wild state,\r\nthere is no reason to hope that a single wild and unprotected individual\r\nwill remain alive ten years hence. The nearer the species approaches to\r\ncomplete extermination, the more eagerly are the wretched fugitives\r\npursued to the death whenever found. Western hunters are striving for\r\nthe honor (?) of killing the last buffalo, which, it is to be noted, has\r\nalready been slain about a score of times by that number of hunters.\r\n\r\nThe buffaloes still alive in a wild state are so very few, and have been\r\nso carefully \"marked down\" by hunters, it is possible to make a very\r\nclose estimate of the total number remaining. In this enumeration the\r\nsmall herd in the Yellowstone National Park is classed with other herds\r\nin captivity and under protection, for the reason that, had it not been\r\nfor the protection afforded by the law and the officers of the Park, not\r\none of these buffaloes would be living to-day. Were the restrictions of\r\nthe law removed now, every one of those animals would be killed within\r\nthree months. Their heads alone are worth from $25 to $50 each to\r\ntaxidermists, and for this reason every buffalo is a prize worth the\r\nhunter's winning. Had it not been for stringent laws, and a rigid\r\nenforcement of them by Captain Harris, the last of the Park buffaloes\r\nwould have been shot years ago by Vic. Smith, the Rea Brothers, and\r\nother hunters, of whom there is always an able contingent around the\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the death of a buffalo is now such an event that it\r\nis immediately chronicled by the Associated Press and telegraphed all\r\nover the country. By reason of this, and from information already in\r\nhand, we are able to arrive at a very fair understanding of the present\r\ncondition of the species in a wild state.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1886, the Smithsonian expedition left about fifteen\r\nbuffaloes alive in the bad lands of the Missouri-Yellowstone divide, at\r\nthe head of Big Porcupine Creek. In 1887 three of these were killed by\r\ncowboys, and in 1888 two more, the last death recorded being that of an\r\nold bull killed near Billings. There are probably eight or ten\r\nstragglers still remaining in that region, hiding in the wildest and\r\nmost broken tracts of the bad lands, as far as possible from the cattle\r\nranches, and where even cowboys seldom go save on a round-up. From the\r\nfact that no other buffaloes, at least so far as can be learned, have\r\nbeen killed in Montana during the last two years, I am convinced that\r\nthe bunch referred to are the last representatives of the species\r\nremaining in Montana.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1886 Mr. B. C. Winston, while on a hunting trip about\r\n75 miles west of Grand Rapids, Dakota, saw seven buffaloes--five adult\r\nanimals and two calves; of which he killed one, a large bull, and caught\r\na calf alive. On September 11, 1888, a solitary bull was killed 3 miles\r\nfrom the town of Oakes, in Dickey County. There are still three\r\nindividuals in the unsettled country lying between that point and the\r\nMissouri, which are undoubtedly the only wild representatives of the\r\nrace east of the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nOn April 28, 1887, Dr. William Stephenson, of the United States Army,\r\nwrote me as follows from Pilot Butte, about 30 miles north of Rock\r\nSprings, Wyoming:\r\n\r\n\"There are undoubtedly buffalo within 50 or 60 miles of here, two having\r\nbeen killed out of a band of eighteen some ten days since by cowboys,\r\nand another band of four seen near there. I hear from cattlemen of their\r\nbeing seen every year north and northeast of here.\"\r\n\r\nThis band was seen once in 1888. In February, 1889, Hon. Joseph M.\r\nCarey, member of Congress from Wyoming, received a letter informing him\r\nthat this band of buffaloes, consisting of twenty-six head, had been\r\nseen grazing in the Red Desert of Wyoming, and that the Indians were\r\npreparing to attack it. At Judge Carey's request the Indian Bureau\r\nissued orders which it was hoped would prevent the slaughter. So, until\r\nfurther developments, we have the pleasure of recording the presence of\r\ntwenty-six wild buffaloes in southern Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThere are no buffaloes whatever in the vicinity of the Yellowstone Park,\r\neither in Wyoming, Montana, or Idaho, save what wander out of that\r\nreservation, and when any do, they are speedily killed.\r\n\r\nThere is a rumor that there are ten or twelve mountain buffaloes still\r\non foot in Colorado, in a region called Lost Park, and, while it lacks\r\nconfirmation, we gladly accept it as a fact. In 1888 Mr. C. B. Cory, of\r\nBoston, saw in Denver, Colorado, eight fresh buffalo skins, which it was\r\nsaid had come from the region named above. In 1885 there was a herd of\r\nabout forty \"mountain buffalo\" near South Park, and although some of the\r\nnumber may still survive, the indications are that the total number of\r\nwild buffaloes in Colorado does not exceed twenty individuals.\r\n\r\nIn Texas a miserable remnant of the great southern herd still remains in\r\nthe \"Pan-handle country,\" between the two forks of the Canadian River.\r\nIn 1886 about two hundred head survived, which number by the summer of\r\n1887 had been reduced to one hundred, or less. In the hunting season of\r\n1887-'88 a ranchman named Lee Howard fitted out and led a strong party\r\ninto the haunts of the survivors, and killed fifty-two of them. In May,\r\n1888, Mr. C. J. Jones again visited this region for the purpose of\r\ncapturing buffaloes alive. His party found, from first to last,\r\nthirty-seven buffaloes, of which they captured eighteen head, eleven\r\nadult cows and seven calves; the greatest feat ever accomplished in\r\nbuffalo-hunting. It is highly probable that Mr. Jones and his men saw\r\nabout all the buffaloes now living in the Pan-handle country, and it\r\ntherefore seems quite certain that not over twenty-five individuals\r\nremain. These are so few, so remote, and so difficult to reach, it is to\r\nbe hoped no one will consider them worth going after, and that they will\r\nbe left to take care of themselves. It is greatly to be regretted that\r\nthe State of Texas does not feel disposed to make a special effort for\r\ntheir protection and preservation.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the existence of wild buffaloes in the British Possessions,\r\nthe statements of different authorities are at variance, by far the\r\nlarger number holding the opinion that there are in all the Northwest\r\nTerritory only a few almost solitary stragglers. But there is still good\r\nreason for the hope, and also the belief, that there still remain in\r\nAthabasca, between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers, at least a few\r\nhundred \"wood buffalo.\" In a very interesting and well-considered\r\narticle in the London _Field_ of November 10, 1888, Mr. Miller Christy\r\nquotes all the available positive evidence bearing on this point, and I\r\ngladly avail myself of the opportunity to reproduce it here:\r\n\r\n\"The Hon. Dr. Schulz, in the recent debate on the Mackenzie River basin,\r\nin the Canadian senate, quoted Senator Hardisty, of Edmonton, of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company, to the effect that the wood buffalo still existed\r\nin the region in question. 'It was,' he said, 'difficult to estimate how\r\nmany; but probably five or six hundred still remain in scattered bands.'\r\nThere had been no appreciable difference in their numbers, he thought,\r\nduring the last fifteen years, as they could not be hunted on horseback,\r\non account of the wooded character of the country, and were, therefore,\r\nvery little molested. They are larger than the buffalo of the great\r\nplains, weighing at least 150 pounds more. They are also coarser haired\r\nand straighter horned.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor also quoted Mr. Frank Oliver, of Edmonton, to the effect\r\nthat the wood buffalo still exists in small numbers between the Lower\r\nPeace and Great Slave Rivers, extending westward from the latter to the\r\nSalt River in latitude 60 degrees, and also between the Peace and\r\nAthabasca Rivers. He states that 'they are larger than the prairie\r\nbuffalo, and the fur is darker, but practically they are the same\r\nanimal.' ...Some buffalo meat is brought in every winter to the Hudson's\r\nBay Company's posts nearest the buffalo ranges.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Schulz further stated that he had received the following testimony\r\nfrom Mr. Donald Ross, of Edmonton: The wood buffalo still exists in the\r\nlocalities named. About 1870 one was killed as far west on Peace River\r\nas Port Dunvegan. They are quite different from the prairie buffalo,\r\nbeing nearly double the size, as they will dress fully 700 pounds.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent to most observers, I think, that Mr. Ross's\r\nstatement in regard to the size of the wood buffalo is a random shot.\r\n\r\nIn a private letter to the writer, under date of October 22, 1887, Mr.\r\nHarrison S. Young, of the Hudson's Bay Company's post at Edmonton,\r\nwrites as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The buffalo are not yet extinct in the Northwest. There are still some\r\nstray ones on the prairies away to the south of this, but they must be\r\nvery few. I am unable to find any one who has personal knowledge of the\r\nkilling of one during the last two years, though I have since the\r\nreceipt of your letter questioned a good many half-breeds on the\r\nsubject. In our district of Athabasca, along the Salt River, there are\r\nstill a few wood buffalo killed every year, but they are fast\r\ndiminishing in numbers and are also becoming very shy.\"\r\n\r\nIn his \"Manitoba and the Great Northwest\" Prof. John Macoun has this to\r\nsay regarding the presence of the wood buffalo in the region referred\r\nto:\r\n\r\n\"The wood buffalo, when I was on the Peace River in 1875, were confined\r\nto the country lying between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers north of\r\nlatitude 57° 30', or chiefly in the Birch Hills. They were also said to\r\nbe in some abundance on the Salt and Hay Rivers, running into the Save\r\nRiver north of Peace River. The herds thirteen years ago [now nineteen]\r\nwere supposed to number about one thousand, all told. I believe many\r\nstill exist, as the Indians of that region eat fish, which are much\r\neasier procured than either buffalo or moose, and the country is much\r\ntoo difficult for white men.\"\r\n\r\nAll this evidence, when carefully considered, resolves itself into\r\nsimply this and no more: The only evidence in favor of the existence of\r\nany live buffaloes between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers is in the form\r\nof very old rumors, most of them nearly fifteen years old; time enough\r\nfor the Indians to have procured fire-arms in abundance and killed all\r\nthose buffaloes two or three times over.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller Christy takes \"the mean of the estimates,\" and assumes that\r\nthere are now about five hundred and fifty buffaloes in the region\r\nnamed. If we are to believe in the existence there of any stragglers his\r\nestimate is a fair one, and we will gladly accept it.

Already there have been three\r\nor four that almost deserve special mention. The first appeared in\r\nMarch, 1887, when various Western newspapers published a circumstantial\r\naccount of how a herd of about three hundred buffaloes swam the Missouri\r\nRiver about 10 miles above Bismarck, near the town of Painted Woods, and\r\nran on in a southwesterly direction. A letter of inquiry, addressed to\r\nMr. S. A. Peterson, postmaster at Painted Woods, elicited the following\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n\"The whole rumor is false, and without any foundation. I saw it first in\r\nthe ---- newspaper, where I believe it originated.\"\r\n\r\nIn these days of railroads and numberless hunting parties, there is not\r\nthe remotest possibility of there being anywhere in the United States a\r\nherd of a hundred, or even fifty, buffaloes which has escaped\r\nobservation. Of the eighty-five head still existing in a wild state it\r\nmay safely be predicted that not even one will remain alive five years\r\nhence. A buffalo is now so great a prize, and by the ignorant it is\r\nconsidered so great an honor(!) to kill one, that extraordinary\r\nexertions will be made to find and shoot down without mercy the \"last\r\nbuffalo.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no possible chance for the race to be perpetuated in a wild\r\nstate, and in a few years more hardly a bone will remain above ground to\r\nmark the existence of the must prolific mammalian species that ever\r\nexisted, so far as we know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. EFFECTS OF THE EXTERMINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe buffalo supplied the Indian with food, clothing, shelter, bedding,\r\nsaddles, ropes, shields, and innumerable smaller articles of use and\r\nornament In the United States a paternal government takes the place of\r\nthe buffalo in supplying all these wants of the red man, and it costs\r\nseveral millions of dollars annually to accomplish the task.\r\n\r\nThe following are the tribes which depended very largely--some almost\r\nwholly--upon the buffalo for the necessities, and many of the luxuries,\r\nof their savage life until the Government began to support them:\r\n\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n|Sioux                        |30,561|\r\n|Crow                         | 3,226|\r\n|Piegan, Blood, and Blackfeet | 2,026|\r\n|Cheyenne                     | 3,477|\r\n|Gros Ventres                 |   856|\r\n|Arickaree                    |   517|\r\n|Mandan                       |   283|\r\n|Bannack and Shoshone         | 2,001|\r\n|Nez Percé                    | 1,460|\r\n|Assinniboine                 | 1,688|\r\n|Kiowas and Comanches         | 2,756|\r\n|Arapahoes                    | 1,217|\r\n|Apache                       |   332|\r\n|Ute                          |   978|\r\n|Omaha                        | 1,160|\r\n|Pawnee                       |   998|\r\n|Winnebago                    | 1,222|\r\n|                             |------|\r\n|    Total                    |54,758|\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThis enumeration (from the census of 1886) leaves entirely out of\r\nconsideration many thousands of Indians living in the Indian Territory\r\nand other portions of the Southwest, who drew an annual supply of meat\r\nand robes from the chase of the buffalo, notwithstanding the fact that\r\ntheir chief dependence was upon agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of what was once the buffalo country are not starving and\r\nfreezing, for the reason that the United States Government supplies them\r\nregularly with beef and blankets in lieu of buffalo. Does any one\r\nimagine that the Government could not have regulated the killing of\r\nbuffaloes, and thus maintained the supply, for far less money than it\r\nnow costs to feed and clothe those 54,758 Indians!\r\n\r\nHow is it with the Indians of the British Possessions to-day?\r\n\r\nProf. John Maconn writes as follows in his \"Manitoba and the Great\r\nNorthwest,\" page 342:\r\n\r\n\"During the last three years [prior to 1883] the great herds have been\r\nkept south of our boundary, and, as the result of this, our Indians have\r\nbeen on the verge of starvation. When the hills were covered with\r\ncountless thousands [of buffaloes] in 1877, the Blackfeet were dying of\r\nstarvation in 1879.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1886-'87, destitution and actual starvation\r\nprevailed to an alarming extent among certain tribes of Indians in the\r\nNorthwest Territory who once lived bountifully on the buffalo. A\r\nterrible tale of suffering in the Athabasca and Peace River country has\r\nrecently (1888) come to the minister of the interior of the Canadian\r\ngovernment, in the form of a petition signed by the bishop of that\r\ndiocese, six clergymen and missionaries, and several justices of the\r\npeace. It sets forth that \"owing to the destruction of game, the\r\nIndians, both last winter and last summer, have been in a state of\r\nstarvation. They are now in a complete state of destitution, and are\r\nutterly unable to provide themselves with clothing, shelter, ammunition,\r\nor food for the coming winter.\" The petition declares that on account of\r\nstarvation, and consequent cannibalism, a party of twenty-nine Cree\r\nIndians was reduced to three in the winter of 1886.[77] Of the Fort\r\nChippewyan Indians, between twenty and thirty starved to death last\r\nwinter, and the death of many more was hastened by want of food and by\r\nfamine diseases. Many other Indians--Crees, Beavers, and Chippewyans--at\r\nalmost all points where there are missions or trading posts, would\r\ncertainly have starved to death but for the help given them by the\r\ntraders and missionaries at those places. It is now declared by the\r\nsigners of the memorial that scores of families, having lost their heads\r\nby starvation, are now perfectly helpless, and during the coming winter\r\nmust either starve to death or eat one another unless help comes.\r\nHeart-rending stories of suffering and cannibalism continue to come in\r\nfrom what was once the buffalo plains.\r\n\r\n[Note 77: It was the Cree Indians who used to practice impounding\r\nbuffaloes, slaughtering a penful of two hundred head at a time with most\r\nfiendish glee, and leaving all but the very choicest of the meat to\r\nputrefy.]\r\n\r\nIf ever thoughtless people were punished for their reckless\r\nimprovidence, the Indians and half-breeds of the Northwest Territory are\r\nnow paying the penalty for the wasteful slaughter of the buffalo a few\r\nshort years ago. The buffalo is his own avenger, to an extent his\r\nremorseless slayers little dreamed he ever could be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. PRESERVATION OF THE SPECIES FROM ABSOLUTE EXTINCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is reason to fear that unless the United States Government takes\r\nthe matter in hand and makes a special effort to prevent it, the\r\npure-blood bison will be lost irretrievably through mixture with\r\ndomestic breeds and through in-and-in breeding.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Yellowstone Park herd is, to say the least, highly\r\nuncertain. A distinguished Senator, who is deeply interested in\r\nlegislation for the protection of the National Park reservation, has\r\ndeclared that the pressure from railway corporations, which are seeking\r\na foot-hold in the park, has become so great and so aggressive that he\r\nfears the park will \"eventually be broken up.\" In any such event, the\r\ndestruction of the herd of park buffaloes would be one of the very first\r\nresults. If the park is properly maintained, however, it is to be hoped\r\nthat the buffaloes now in it will remain there and increase\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nAs yet there are only two captive buffaloes in the possession of the\r\nGovernment, viz, those in the Department of Living Animals of the\r\nNational Museum, presented by Hon. E. G. Blackford, of New York. The\r\nbuffaloes now in the Zoological Gardens of the country are but few in\r\nnumber, and unless special pains be taken to prevent it, by means of\r\njudicious exchanges, from time to time, these will rapidly deteriorate\r\nin size, and within a comparatively short time run out entirely, through\r\ncontinued in-and-in breeding. It is said that even the wild aurochs in\r\nthe forests of Lithuania are decreasing in size and, in number from this\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nWith private owners of captive buffaloes, the temptations to produce\r\ncross-breeds will be so great that it is more than likely the breeding\r\nof pure-blood buffaloes will be neglected. Indeed, unless some stockman\r\nlike Mr. C. J. Jones takes particular pains to protect his full blood\r\nbuffaloes, and keep the breed absolutely pure, in twenty years there\r\nwill not be a pure-blood animal of that species on any stock farm in\r\nthis country. Under existing conditions, the constant tendency of the\r\nnumerous domestic forms is to absorb and utterly obliterate the few wild\r\nones.\r\n\r\nIf we may judge from the examples set as by European governments, it is\r\nclearly the duty of our Government to act in this matter, and act\r\npromptly, with a degree of liberality and promptness which can not be\r\notherwise than highly gratifying to every American citizen and every\r\nfriend of science throughout the world. The Fiftieth Congress, at its\r\nlast session, responded to the call made upon it, and voted $200,000 for\r\nthe establishment of a National Zoological Park in the District of\r\nColumbia on a grand scale. One of the leading purposes it is destined to\r\nserve is the preservation and breeding in comfortable, and so far as\r\nspace is concerned, luxurious captivity of a number of fine specimens of\r\nevery species of American quadruped now threatened with\r\nextermination.[78]\r\n\r\n[Note 78: It is indeed an unbounded satisfaction to be able to now\r\nrecord the fact that this important task, in which every American\r\ncitizen has a personal interest, is actually to be undertaken. Last year\r\nwe could only way it ought to be undertaken. In its accomplishment, the\r\nGovernment expects the co-operation of private individuals all over the\r\ncountry in the form of gifts of desirable living animals, for no\r\ngovernment could afford to purchase all the animals necessary for a\r\ngreat Zoological Garden, provide for their wants in a liberal way, and\r\nyet give the public free access to the collection, as is to be given to\r\nthe National Zoological Park.]\r\n\r\nAt least eight or ten buffaloes of pure breed should be secured very\r\nsoon by the Zoological Park Commission, by gift if possible, and cared\r\nfor with special reference to keeping the breed absolutely pure, and\r\n_keeping the herd from deteriorating and dying out through in-and-in\r\nbreeding_.\r\n\r\nThe total expense would be trifling in comparison with the importance of\r\nthe end to be gained, and in that way we might, in a small measure,\r\natone for our neglect of the means which would have protected the great\r\nherds from extinction. In this way, by proper management, it will be not\r\nonly possible but easy to preserve fine living representatives of this\r\nimportant species for centuries to come.\r\n\r\nThe result of continuing in-breeding is certain extinction. Its progress\r\nmay be so slow as to make no impression upon the mind of a herd-owner,\r\nbut the end is only a question of time. The fate of a majority of the\r\nherds of British wild cattle (_Bos urus_) warn us what to expect with\r\nthe American bison under similar circumstances. Of the fourteen herds of\r\nwild cattle which were in existence in England and Scotland during the\r\nearly part of the present century, direct descendants of the wild herds\r\nfound in Great Britain, nine have become totally extinct through in\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nThe five herds remaining are those at Somerford Park, Blickling Hall,\r\nWoodbastwick, Chartley, and Chillingham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.--THE SMITHSONIAN EXPEDITION FOR MUSEUM SPECIMENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE EXPLORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first three months of the year 1886 it was ascertained by the\r\nwriter, then chief taxidermist of the National Museum, that the\r\nextermination of the American bison had made most alarming progress. By\r\nextensive correspondence it was learned that the destruction of all the\r\nlarge herds, both North and South, was already an accomplished fact.\r\nWhile it was generally supposed that at least a few thousand individuals\r\nstill inhabited the more remote and inaccessible regions of what once\r\nconstituted the great northern buffalo range, it was found that the\r\nactual number remaining in the whole United States was probably less\r\nthan three hundred.\r\n\r\nBy some authorities who were consulted it was considered an\r\nimpossibility to procure a large series of specimens anywhere in this\r\ncountry, while others asserted positively that there were no wild\r\nbuffaloes south of the British possessions save those in the Yellowstone\r\nNational Park. Canadian authorities asserted with equal positiveness\r\nthat none remained in their territory.\r\n\r\nA careful inventory of the specimens in the collection of the National\r\nMuseum revealed the fact that, with the exception of one mounted female\r\nskin, another unmounted, and one mounted skeleton of a male buffalo, the\r\nMuseum was actually without presentable specimens of this most important\r\nand interesting mammal.\r\n\r\nBesides those mentioned above, the collection contained only two old,\r\nbadly mounted, and dilapidated skins, (one of which had been taken in\r\nsummer, and therefore was not representative), an incomplete skeleton,\r\nsome fragmentary skulls of no value, and two mounted heads. Thus it\r\nappeared that the Museum was unable to show a series of specimens, good\r\nor bad, or even one presentable male of good size.\r\n\r\nIn view of this alarming state of affairs, coupled with the already\r\ndeclared extinction of _Bison americanus_, the Secretary of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, Prof. Spencer F. Baird, determined to send a\r\nparty into the field at once to find wild buffalo, if any were still\r\nliving, and in case any were found to collect a number of specimens.\r\nSince it seemed highly uncertain whether any other institution, or any\r\nprivate individual, would have the opportunity to collect a large supply\r\nof specimens before it became too late, it was decided by the Secretary\r\nthat the Smithsonian Institution should undertake the task of providing\r\nfor the future as liberally as possible. For the benefit of the smaller\r\nscientific museums of the country, and for others which will come into\r\nexistence during the next half century, it was resolved to collect at\r\nall hazards, in case buffalo could be found, between eighty and one\r\nhundred specimens of various kinds, of which from twenty to thirty\r\nshould be skins, an equal number should be complete skeletons, and of\r\nskulls at least fifty.\r\n\r\nIn view of the great scarcity of buffalo and the general belief that it\r\nmight be a work of some months to find any specimens, even if it were\r\npossible to find any at all, it was determined not to risk the success\r\nof the undertaking by delaying it until the regular autumn hunting\r\nseason, but to send a party into the field at once to prosecute a\r\nsearch. It was resolved to discover at all hazards the whereabouts of\r\nany buffalo that might still remain in this country in a wild state,\r\nand, if possible, to reach them before the shedding of their winter\r\npelage. It very soon became apparent, however, that the latter would\r\nprove an utter impossibility.\r\n\r\nLate in the month of April a letter was received from Dr. J. C. Merrill,\r\nUnited States Army, dated at Huntley, Montana, giving information of\r\nreports that buffalo were still to be found in three localities in the\r\nNorthwest, viz: on the headwaters of the Powder River, Wyoming; in\r\nJudith Basin, Montana; and on Big Dry Creek, also in Montana. The\r\nreports in regard to the first two localities proved to be erroneous. It\r\nwas ascertained to a reasonable certainty that there still existed in\r\nsouthwestern Dakota a small band of six or eight wild buffaloes, while\r\nfrom the Pan-handle of Texas there came reports of the existence there,\r\nin small scattered hands, of about two hundred head. The buffalo known\r\nto be in Dakota were far too few in number to justify a long and\r\nexpensive search, while those in Texas, on the Canadian River, were too\r\ndifficult to reach to make it advisable to hunt them save as a last\r\nresort. It was therefore decided to investigate the localities named in\r\nthe Northwest.\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of the Secretary of War, an order was sent to the\r\nofficer commanding the Department of Dakota, requesting him to furnish\r\nthe party, through the officers in command at Forts Keogh, Maginnis, and\r\nMcKinney, such field transportation, escort, and camp equipage as might\r\nbe necessary, and also to sell to the party such commissary stores as\r\nmight be required, at cost price, plus 10 per cent. The Secretary of the\r\nInterior also favored the party with an order, directing all Indian\r\nagents, scouts, and others in the service of the Department to render\r\nassistance as far as possible when called upon.\r\n\r\nIn view of the public interest attaching to the results of the\r\nexpedition, the railway transportation of the party to and from Montana\r\nwas furnished entirely without cost to the Smithsonian Institution. For\r\nthese valuable courtesies we gratefully acknowledge our obligations to\r\nMr. Frank Thomson, of the Pennsylvania Railroad; Mr. Roswell Miller, of\r\nthe Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul; and Mr. Robert Harris, of the\r\nNorthern Pacific.\r\n\r\nUnder orders from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the\r\nwriter left Washington on May 6, accompanied by A. H. Forney, assistant\r\nin the department of taxidermy, and George H. Hedley, of Medina, New\r\nYork. It had been decided that Miles City, Montana, might properly be\r\ntaken as the first objective point, and that town was reached on May 9.\r\n\r\nDiligent inquiry in Miles City and at Fort Keogh, 2 miles distant,\r\nrevealed the fact that no one knew of the presence of any wild buffalo\r\nanywhere in the Northwest, save within the protected limits of the\r\nYellowstone Park. All inquiries elicited the same reply: \"There are no\r\nbuffalo any more, and you can't get any anywhere.\" Many persons who were\r\nconsidered good authority declared most positively that there was not a\r\nlive buffalo in the vicinity of Big Dry Creek, nor anywhere between the\r\nYellowstone and Missouri Rivers. An army officer from Fort Maginnis\r\ntestified to the total absence of buffalo in the Judith Basin, and\r\nranchmen from Wyoming asserted that none remained in the Powder River\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nJust at this time it was again reported to us, and most opportunely\r\nconfirmed by Mr. Henry E. Phillips, owner of the =LU=-bar ranch on\r\nLittle Dry Creek, that there still remained a chance to find a few\r\nbuffalo in the country lying south of the Big Dry. On the other hand,\r\nother persons who seemed to be fully informed regarding that very region\r\nand the animal life it contained, assured us that not a single buffalo\r\nremained there, and that a search in that direction would prove\r\nfruitless. But the balance of evidence, however, seemed to lie in favor\r\nof the Big Dry country, and we resolved to hunt through it with all\r\npossible dispatch.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of May 13 we crossed the Yellowstone and started\r\nnorthwest up the trail which leads along Sunday Creek. Our entire party\r\nconsisted of the two assistants already mentioned, a non-commissioned\r\nofficer, Sergeant Garone, and four men from the Fifth Infantry acting as\r\nescort; Private Jones, also from the Fifth Infantry, detailed to act as\r\nour cook, and a teamster. Our conveyance consisted of a six-mule team,\r\nwhich, like the escort, was ordered out for twenty days only, and\r\nprovided accordingly. Before leaving Miles City we purchased two\r\nsaddle-horses for use in hunting, the equipments for which were\r\nfurnished by the ordnance department at Fort Keogh.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two days' travel through the bad lands north of the\r\nYellowstone no mammals were seen save prairie-dogs and rabbits. On the\r\nthird day a few antelope were seen, but none killed. It is to be borne\r\nin mind that this entire region is absolutely treeless everywhere save\r\nalong the margins of the largest streams. Bushes are also entirely\r\nabsent, with the exception of sage-brush, and even that does not occur\r\nto any extent on the divides.\r\n\r\nOn the third day two young buck antelopes were shot at the Red Buttes.\r\nOne had already commenced to shed his hair, but the other had not quite\r\nreached that point. We prepared the skin of the first specimen and the\r\nskeleton of the other. This was the only good antelope skin we obtained\r\nin the spring, those of all the other specimens taken being quite\r\nworthless on account of the looseness of the hair. During the latter\r\npart of May, and from that time on until the long winter hair is\r\ncompletely shed, it falls off in handfuls at the slightest pressure,\r\nleaving the skin clad only with a thin growth of new, mouse-colored hair\r\nan eighth of an inch long.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching Little Dry Creek and hunting through the country on the\r\nwest side of it nearly to its confluence with the Big Dry we turned\r\nsouthwest, and finally went into permanent camp on Phillips Creek, 8\r\nmiles above the =LU=-bar ranch and 4 miles from the Little Dry. At that\r\npoint we were about 80 miles from Miles City.\r\n\r\nFrom information furnished us by Mr. Phillips and the cowboys in his\r\nemploy, we were assured that about thirty-five head of buffalo ranged in\r\nthe bad lands between Phillips Creek and the Musselshell River and south\r\nof the Big Dry. This tract of country was about 40 miles long from east\r\nto west by 25 miles wide, and therefore of about 1,000 square miles in\r\narea. Excepting two temporary cowboy camps it was totally uninhabited by\r\nman, treeless, without any running streams, save in winter and spring,\r\nand was mostly very hilly and broken.\r\n\r\nIn this desolate and inhospitable country the thirty-five buffaloes\r\nalluded to had been seen, first on Sand Creek, then at the head of the\r\nBig Porcupine, again near the Musselshell, and latest near the head of\r\nthe Little Dry. As these points were all from 15 to 30 miles distant\r\nfrom each other, the difficulty of finding such a small herd becomes\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nAlthough Phillips Creek was really the eastern boundary of the buffalo\r\ncountry, it was impossible for a six-mule wagon to proceed beyond it, at\r\nleast at that point. Having established a permanent camp, the Government\r\nwagon and its escort returned to Fort Keogh, and we proceeded to hunt\r\nthrough the country between Sand Creek and the Little Dry. The absence\r\nof nearly all the cowboys on the spring round-up, which began May 20,\r\nthreatened to be a serious drawback to us, as we greatly needed the\r\nservices of a man who was acquainted with the country. We had with us as\r\na scout and guide a Cheyenne Indian, named Dog, but it soon became\r\napparent that he knew no more about the country than we did.\r\nFortunately, however, we succeeded in occasionally securing the services\r\nof a cowboy, which was of great advantage to us.\r\n\r\nIt was our custom to ride over the country daily, each day making a\r\ncircuit through a new locality, and covering as much ground as it was\r\npossible to ride over in a day. It was also our custom to take trips of\r\nfrom two to four days in length, during which we carried our blankets\r\nand rations upon our horses and camped wherever night overtook us,\r\nprovided water could be found.\r\n\r\nOur first success consisted in the capture of a buffalo calf, which from\r\nexcessive running had become unable to keep up with its mother, and had\r\nbeen left behind. The calf was caught alive without any difficulty, and\r\nwhile two of the members of our party carried it to camp across a horse,\r\nthe other two made a vigorous effort to discover the band of adult\r\nanimals. The effort was unsuccessful, for, besides the calf, no other\r\nbuffaloes were seen.\r\n\r\nTen days after the above event two bull buffaloes were met with on the\r\nLittle Dry, 15 miles above the =LU=-bar ranch, one of which was\r\novertaken and killed, but the other got safely away. The shedding of the\r\nwinter coat was in full progress. On the head, neck, and shoulders the\r\nold hair had been entirely replaced by the new, although the two coats\r\nwere so matted together that the old hair clung in tangled masses to the\r\nother. The old hair was brown and weather-beaten, but the new, which was\r\nfrom 3 to 6 inches long, had a peculiar bluish-gray appearance. On the\r\nhead the new hair was quite black, and contrasted oddly with the lighter\r\ncolor. On the body and hind quarters there were large patches of skin\r\nwhich were perfectly bare, between which lay large patches of old,\r\nwoolly, brown hair. This curious condition gave the animal a very\r\nunkempt and \"seedy\" appearance, the effect of which was heightened by\r\nthe long, shaggy locks of old, weather beaten hair which clung to the\r\nnew coat of the neck and shoulders like tattered signals of distress,\r\nready to be blown away by the first gust of wind.\r\n\r\nThis specimen was a large one, measuring 5 feet 4 inches in height.\r\nInasmuch as the skin was not in condition to mount, we took only the\r\nskeleton, entire, and the skin of the head and neck.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the calf and the death of this bull proved conclusively\r\nthat there were buffaloes in that region, and also that they were\r\nbreeding in comparative security. The extent of the country they had to\r\nrange over made it reasonably certain that their number would not be\r\ndiminished to any serious extent by the cowboys on the spring round-up,\r\nalthough it was absolutely certain that in a few months the members of\r\nthat band would all be killed. The report of the existence of a herd of\r\nthirty-five head was confirmed later by cowboys, who had actually seen\r\nthe animals, and killed two of them merely for sport, as usual. They\r\nsaved a few pounds of hump meat, and all the rest became food for the\r\nwolves and foxes.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore resolved to leave the buffaloes entirely unmolested\r\nuntil autumn, and then, when the robes would be in the finest condition,\r\nreturn for a hunt on a liberal scale. Accordingly, it was decided to\r\nreturn to Washington without delay, and a courier was dispatched with a\r\nrequest for transportation to carry our party back to Fort Keogh.\r\n\r\nWhile awaiting the arrival of the wagons, a cowboy in the employ of the\r\nPhillips Land and Cattle Company killed a solitary bull buffalo about 15\r\nmiles west of our camp, near Sand Creek. This animal had completely shed\r\nthe hair on his body and hind quarters. In addition to the preservation\r\nof his entire skeleton, we prepared the skin also, as an example of the\r\ncondition of the buffalo immediately after shedding.\r\n\r\nOn June 6 the teams from Fort Keogh arrived, and we immediately returned\r\nto Miles City, taking with us our live buffalo calf, two fresh buffalo\r\nskeletons, three bleached skeletons, seven skulls, one skin entire, and\r\none head skin, in addition to a miscellaneous collection of skins and\r\nskeletons of smaller mammals and birds. On reaching Miles City we\r\nhastily packed and shipped our collection, and, taking the calf with us,\r\nreturned at once to Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE HUNT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 24 I arrived at Miles City a second time, fully equipped\r\nfor a protracted hunt for buffalo; this time accompanied only by W.\r\nHarvey Brown, a student of the University of Kansas, as field assistant,\r\nhaving previously engaged three cowboys as guides and hunters--Irwin\r\nBoyd, James McNaney, and L. S. Russell. Messrs. Boyd and Russell were in\r\nMiles City awaiting my arrival, and Mr. McNaney joined us in the field a\r\nfew days later. Mr. Boyd acted as my foreman during the entire hunt, a\r\nposition which he filled to my entire satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThanks to the energy and good-will of the officers at Fort Keogh, of\r\nwhich Lieutenant-Colonel Cochran was then in command, our\r\ntransportation, camp equipage, and stores were furnished without an\r\nhour's delay. We purchased two months' supplies of commissary stores, a\r\nteam, and two saddle-horses, and hired three more horses, a light wagon,\r\nand a set of double harness. Each of the cowboys furnished one horse; so\r\nthat in our outfit we had ten head, a team, and two good saddle-horses\r\nfor each hunter. The worst feature of the whole question of subsistence\r\nwas the absolute necessity of hauling a supply of grain from Miles City\r\ninto the heart of the buffalo country for our ten horses. For such work\r\nas they had to encounter it was necessary to feed them constantly and\r\nliberally with oats in order to keep them in condition to do their work.\r\nWe took with us 2,000 pounds of oats, and by the beginning of November\r\nas much more had to be hauled up to us.\r\n\r\nThirty six hours after our arrival in Miles City our outfit was\r\ncomplete, and we crossed the Yellowstone and started up the Sunday Creek\r\ntrail. We had from Fort Keogh a six-mule team, an escort of four men, in\r\ncharge of Sergeant Bayliss, and an old veteran of more than twenty\r\nyears' service, from the Fifth Infantry, Private Patrick McCanna, who\r\nwas detailed to act as cook and camp-guard for our party during our stay\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nOn September 29 we reached Tow's ranch, the =HV=, on Big Dry Creek\r\n(erroneously called Big Timber Creek on most maps of Montana), at the\r\nmouth of Sand Creek, which here flows into it from the southwest. This\r\npoint is said to be 90 miles from Miles City. Here we received our\r\nfreight from the six-mule wagon, loaded it with bleached skeletons and\r\nskulls of buffalo, and started it back to the post. One member of the\r\nescort, Private C. S. West, who was then on two months' furlough,\r\nelected to join our party for the hunt, and accordingly remained with us\r\nto its close. Leaving half of our freight stored at the =HV= ranch, we\r\nloaded the remainder upon our own wagon, and started up Sand Creek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH MAP OF THE HUNT FOR BUFFALO. MONTANA 1886.]\r\n\r\nAt this point the hunt began. As the wagon and extra horses proceeded up\r\nthe Sand Creek trail in the care of W. Harvey Brown, the three cowboys\r\nand I paired off, and while two hunted through the country along the\r\nsouth side of the creek, the others took the north. The whole of the\r\ncountry bordering Sand Creek, quite up to its source, consists of rugged\r\nhills and ridges, which sometimes rise to considerable height, cut\r\nbetween by great yawning ravines and hollows, such as persecuted game\r\nloves to seek shelter in. Inasmuch as the buffalo we were in search of\r\nhad been seen hiding in those ravines, it became necessary to search\r\nthrough them with systematic thoroughness; a proceeding which was very\r\nwearing upon our horses. Along the south side of Sand Creek, near its\r\nsource, the divide between it and Little Dry Creek culminates in a chain\r\nof high, flat-topped buttes, whose summits bear a scanty growth of\r\nstunted pines, which serve to make them conspicuous landmarks. On some\r\nmaps these insignificant little buttes are shown as mountains, under the\r\nname of \"Piny Buttes.\"\r\n\r\nIt was our intention to go to the head of Sand Creek, and beyond, in\r\ncase buffaloes were not found earlier. Immediately westward of its\r\nsource there is a lofty level plateau, about 3 miles square, which, by\r\ncommon consent, we called the High Divide. It is the highest ground\r\nanywhere between the Big Dry and the Yellowstone, and is the starting\r\npoint of streams that run northward into the Missouri and Big Dry,\r\neastward into Sand Creek and the Little Dry, southward into Porcupine\r\nCreek and the Yellowstone, and westward into the Musselshell. On three\r\nsides--north, east, and south--it is surrounded by wild and rugged butte\r\ncountry, and its sides are scored by intricate systems of great yawning\r\nravines and hollows, steep-sided and very deep, and bad lands of the\r\nworst description.\r\n\r\nBy the 12th of October the hunt had progressed up Sand Creek to its\r\nsource, and westward across the High Divide to Calf Creek, where we\r\nfound a hole of wretchedly bad water and went into permanent camp. We\r\nconsidered that the spot we selected would serve us as a key to the\r\npromising country that lay on three sides of it, and our surmise that\r\nthe buffalo were in the habit of hiding in the heads of those great\r\nravines around the High Divide soon proved to be correct. Our camp at\r\nthe head of Calf Creek was about 20 miles east of the Musselshell River,\r\n40 miles south of the Missouri, and about 135 miles from Miles City, as\r\nthe trail ran. Four miles north of us, also on Calf Creek, was the line\r\ncamp of the =STV= ranch, owned by Messrs. J. H. Conrad & Co., and 18\r\nmiles east, near the head of Sand Creek, was the line camp of the\r\n=N=-bar ranch, owned by Mr. Newman. At each of these camps there were\r\ngenerally from two to four cowboys. From all these gentlemen we received\r\nthe utmost courtesy and hospitality on all occasions, and all the\r\ninformation in regard to buffalo which it was in their power to give. On\r\nmany occasions they rendered us valuable assistance, which is hereby\r\ngratefully acknowledged.\r\n\r\nWe saw no buffalo, nor any signs of any, until October 13. On that day,\r\nwhile L. S. Russell was escorting our second load of freight across the\r\nHigh Divide, he discovered a band of seven buffaloes lying in the head\r\nof a deep ravine. He fired upon them, but killed none, and when they\r\ndashed away he gave chase and followed them 2 or 3 miles. Being mounted\r\non a tired horse, which was unequal to the demands of the chase, he was\r\nfinally distanced by the herd, which took a straight course and ran due\r\nsouth. As it was then nearly night, nothing further could be done that\r\nday except to prepare for a vigorous chase on the morrow. Everything was\r\ngot in perfect readiness for an early start, and by daybreak the\r\nfollowing morning the three cowboys and the writer were mounted on our\r\nbest horses, and on our way through the bad lands to take up the trail\r\nof the seven buffaloes.\r\n\r\nShortly after sunrise we found the trail, not far from the head of Calf\r\nCreek, and followed it due south. We left the rugged butte region behind\r\nus, and entered a tract of country quite unlike anything we had found\r\nbefore. It was composed of a succession of rolling hills and deep\r\nhollows, smooth enough on the surface, to all appearances, but like a\r\ndesert of sand-hills to traverse. The dry soil was loose and crumbly,\r\nlike loose ashes or scoriæ, and the hoofs of our horses sank into it\r\nhalf-way to the fetlocks at every step. But there was another feature\r\nwhich was still worse. The whole surface of the ground was cracked and\r\nseamed with a perfect net-work of great cracks, into which our horses\r\nstepped every yard or so, and sank down still farther, with many a\r\ntiresome wrench of the joints. It was terrible ground to go over. To\r\nmake it as bad as possible, a thick growth of sage-brush or else\r\ngrease-wood was everywhere present for the horses to struggle through,\r\nand when it came to dragging a loaded wagon across that 12-mile stretch\r\nof \"bad grounds\" or \"gumbo ground,\" as it was called, it was killing\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the character of this ground, in one way it was a\r\nbenefit to us. Owing to its looseness on the surface we were able to\r\ntrack the buffaloes through it with the greatest ease, whereas on any\r\nother ground in that country it would have been almost impossible. We\r\nfollowed the trail due south for about 20 miles, which brought us to the\r\nhead of a small stream called Taylor Creek. Here the bad grounds ended,\r\nand in the grassy country which lay beyond, tracking was almost\r\nimpossible. Just at noon we rode to a high point, and on scanning the\r\nhills and hollows with the binocular discovered the buffaloes lying at\r\nrest on the level top of a small butte 2 miles away. The original bunch\r\nof seven had been joined by an equal number.\r\n\r\nWe crept up to within 200 yards of the buffaloes, which was as close as\r\nwe could go, fired a volley at them just as they lay, and did not even\r\nkill a calf! Instantly they sprang up and dashed away at astonishing\r\nspeed, heading straight for the sheltering ravines around the High\r\nDivide.\r\n\r\nWe had a most exciting and likewise dangerous chase after the herd\r\nthrough a vast prairie-dog town, honey-combed with holes just right for\r\na running horse to thrust a leg in up to the knee and snap it off like a\r\npipe-stem, and across fearfully wide gullies that either had to be\r\nleaped or fallen into. McNaney killed a fine old bull and a beautiful\r\ntwo year old, or \"spike\" bull, out of this herd, while I managed to kill\r\na cow and another large old bull, making four for that day, all told.\r\nThis herd of fourteen head was the largest that we saw during the entire\r\nhunt.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, when we were on the spot with the wagon to skin our game\r\nand haul in the hides, four more buffaloes were discovered within 2\r\nmiles of us, and while I worked on one of the large bull skins to save\r\nit from spoiling, the cowboys went after the buffalo, and by a really\r\nbrilliant exploit killed them all. The first one to fall was an old cow,\r\nwhich was killed at the beginning of the chase, the next was an old\r\nbull, who was brought down about 5 miles from the scene of the first\r\nattack, then 2 miles farther on a yearling calf was killed. The fourth\r\nbuffalo, an immense old bull, was chased fully 12 miles before he was\r\nfinally brought down.\r\n\r\nThe largest bull fell about 8 miles from our temporary camp, in the\r\nopposite direction from that in which our permanent camp lay, and at\r\nabout 3 o'clock in the afternoon. There not being time enough in which\r\nto skin him completely and reach our rendezvous before dark, Messrs.\r\nMcNaney and Boyd dressed the carcass to preserve the meat, partly\r\nskinned the legs, and came to camp.\r\n\r\nAs early as possible the next morning we drove to the carcass with the\r\nwagon, to prepare both skin and skeleton and haul them in. When we\r\nreached it we found that during the night a gang of Indians had robbed\r\nus of our hard-earned spoil. They had stolen the skin and all the\r\neatable meat, broken up the leg-bones to get at the marrow, and even cut\r\nout the tongue. And to injury the skulking thieves had added insult.\r\nThrough laziness they had left the head unskinned, but on one side of it\r\nthey had smeared the hair with red war-paint, the other side they had\r\ndaubed with yellow, and around the base of one horn they had tied a\r\nstrip of red flannel as a signal of defiance. Of course they had left\r\nfor parts unknown, and we never saw any signs of them afterward. The\r\ngang visited the =LU=-bar ranch a few days later, so we learned\r\nsubsequently. It was then composed of eleven braves(!), who claimed to\r\nbe Assinniboines, and were therefore believed to be Piegans, the most\r\nnotorious horse and cattle thieves in the Northwest.\r\n\r\nOn October 22d Mr. Russell ran down in a fair chase a fine bull buffalo,\r\nand killed him in the rough country bordering the High Divide on the\r\nsouth. This was the ninth specimen. On the 26th we made an other trip\r\nwith the wagon to the Buffalo Buttes, as, for the sake of convenience,\r\nwe had named the group of buttes near which eight head had already been\r\ntaken. While Mr. Brown and I were getting the wagon across the bad\r\ngrounds, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd discovered a solitary bull buffalo\r\nfeeding in a ravine within a quarter of a mile of our intended camping\r\nplace, and the former stalked him and killed him at long range. The\r\nbuffalo had all been attracted to that locality by some springs which\r\nlay between two groups of hills, and which was the only water within a\r\nradius of about 15 miles. In addition to water, the grass around the\r\nBuffalo Buttes was most excellent.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time we shot antelope and coyotes whenever an\r\nopportunity offered, and preserved the skins and skeletons of the finest\r\nuntil we had obtained a very fine series of both. At this season the\r\npelts of these animals were in the finest possible condition, the hair\r\nhaving attained its maximum length and density, and, being quite new,\r\nhad lost none of its brightness of color, either by wear or the action\r\nof the weather. Along Sand Creek and all around the High Divide antelope\r\nwere moderately plentiful (but really scarce in comparison with their\r\nformer abundance), so much so that had we been inclined to slaughter we\r\ncould have killed a hundred head or more, instead of the twenty that we\r\nshot as specimens and for their flesh. We have it to say that from first\r\nto last not an antelope was killed which was not made use of to the\r\nfullest extent.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of October, Mr. Boyd and I discovered a buffalo cow and\r\nyearling calf in the ravines north of the High Divide, within 3 miles of\r\nour camp, and killed them both. The next day Private West arrived with a\r\nsix mule team from Fort Keogh, in charge of Corporal Clafer and three\r\nmen. This wagon brought us another 2,000 pounds of oats and various\r\ncommissary stores. When it started back, on November 3, we sent by it\r\nall the skins and skeletons of buffalo, antelope, etc., which we had\r\ncollected up to that date, which made a heavy load for the six mules. On\r\nthis same day Mr. McNaney killed two young cow buffaloes in the bad\r\nlands south of the High Divide, which brought our total number up to\r\nfourteen.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 3d the weather turned very cold, and on the day\r\nfollowing we experienced our first snow-storm. By that time the water in\r\nthe hole, which up to that time had supplied our camp, became so thick\r\nwith mud and filth that it was unendurable; and having discovered a fine\r\npool of pure water in the bottom of a little cañon on the southern slope\r\nof the High Divide we moved to it forthwith. It was really the upper\r\nspring of the main fork of the Big Porcupine, and a finer situation for\r\na camp does not exist in that whole region. The spot which nature made\r\nfor us was sheltered on all sides by the high walls of the cañon, within\r\neasy reach of an inexhaustible supply of good water, and also within\r\nreach of a fair supply of dry fire-wood, which we found half a mile\r\nbelow. This became our last permanent camp, and its advantages made up\r\nfor the barrenness and discomfort of our camp on Calf Creek. Immediately\r\nsouth of us, and 2 miles distant there rose a lofty conical butte about\r\n600 feet high, which forms a very conspicuous landmark from the south.\r\nWe were told that it was visible from 40 miles down the Porcupine.\r\nStrange to say, this valuable landmark was without a name, so far as we\r\ncould learn; so, for our own convenience, we christened it Smithsonian\r\nButte.\r\n\r\nThe two buffalo cows that Mr. McNaney killed just before we moved our\r\ncamp seemed to be the last in the country, for during the following week\r\nwe scouted for 15 miles in three directions, north, east, and south,\r\nwithout finding as much as a hoof-print. At last we decided to go away\r\nand give that country absolute quiet for a week, in the hope that some\r\nmore buffalo would come into it. Leaving McCanna and West to take care\r\nof the camp, we loaded a small assortment of general equipage into the\r\nwagon and pulled about 25 miles due west to the Musselshell River.\r\n\r\nWe found a fine stream of clear water, flowing over sand and pebbles,\r\nwith heavy cottonwood timber and thick copses of willow along its banks,\r\nwhich afforded cover for white-tailed deer. In the rugged brakes, which\r\nled from the level river bottom into a labyrinth of ravines and gullies,\r\nridges and hog-backs, up to the level of the high plateau above, we\r\nfound a scanty growth of stunted cedars and pines, which once sheltered\r\ngreat numbers of mule deer, elk, and bear. Now, however, few remain, and\r\nthese are very hard to find. Even when found, the deer are nearly always\r\nyoung. Although we killed five mule deer and five white-tails, we did\r\nnot kill even one fine buck, and the only one we saw on the whole trip\r\nwas a long distance off. We saw fresh tracks of elk, and also grizzly\r\nbear, but our most vigorous efforts to discover the animals themselves\r\nalways ended in disappointment. The many bleaching skulls and antlers of\r\nelk and deer, which we found everywhere we went, afforded proof of what\r\nthat country had been as a home for wild animals only a few years ago.\r\nWe were not a little surprised at finding the fleshless carcasses of\r\nthree head of cattle that had been killed and eaten by bears within a\r\nfew months.\r\n\r\nIn addition to ten deer, we shot three wild geese, seven sharp-tailed\r\ngrouse, eleven sage grouse, nine Bohemian waxwings, and a magpie, for\r\ntheir skeletons. We made one trip of several miles up the Musselshell,\r\nand another due west, almost to the Bull Mountains, but no signs of\r\nbuffalo were found. The weather at this time was quite cold, the\r\nthermometer registering 6 degrees below zero; but, in spite of the fact\r\nthat we were without shelter and had to bivouac in the open, we were,\r\ngenerally speaking, quite comfortable.\r\n\r\nHaving found no buffalo by the 17th, we felt convinced that we ought to\r\nreturn to our permanent camp, and did so on that day. Having brought\r\nback nearly half a wagon-load of specimens in the flesh or half skinned,\r\nit was absolutely necessary that I should remain at camp all the next\r\nday. While I did so, Messrs. McNaney and Boyd rode over to the Buffalo\r\nButtes, found four fine old buffalo cows, and, after a hard chase,\r\nkilled them all.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, this was the most brilliant piece of work of\r\nthe entire hunt. As the four cows dashed past the hunters at the Buffalo\r\nButtes, heading for the High Divide, fully 20 miles distant, McNaney\r\nkilled one cow, and two others went off wounded. Of course the cowboys\r\ngave chase. About 12 miles from the starting-point one of the wounded\r\ncows left her companions, was headed off by Boyd, and killed. About 6\r\nmiles beyond that one, McNaney overhauled the third cow and killed her,\r\nbut the fourth one got away for a short time. While McNaney skinned the\r\nthird cow and dressed the carcass to preserve the meat, Boyd took their\r\nnow thoroughly exhausted horses to camp and procured fresh mounts. On\r\nreturning to McNaney they set out in pursuit of the fourth cow, chased\r\nher across the High Divide, within a mile or so of our camp, and into\r\nthe ravines on the northern slope, where she was killed. She met her\r\ndeath nearly if not quite 25 miles from the spot where the first one\r\nfell.\r\n\r\nThe death of these four cows brought our number of buffaloes up to\r\neighteen, and made us think about the possibilities of getting thirty.\r\nAs we were proceeding to the Buffalo Buttes on the day after the \"kill\"\r\nto gather in the spoil, Mr. Brown and I taking charge of the wagon,\r\nMessrs. McNaney and Boyd went ahead in order to hunt. When within about\r\n5 miles of the Buttes we came unexpectedly upon our companions, down in\r\na hollow, busily engaged in skinning another old cow, which they had\r\ndiscovered traveling across the bad grounds, waylaid, and killed.\r\n\r\nWe camped that night on our old ground at the Buffalo Buttes, and\r\nalthough we all desired to remain a day or two and hunt for more\r\nbuffalo, the peculiar appearance of the sky in the northwest, and the\r\ncondition of the atmosphere, warned us that a change of weather was\r\nimminent. Accordingly, the following morning we decided without\r\nhesitation that it was best to get back to camp that day, and it soon\r\nproved very fortunate for us that we so decided.\r\n\r\nFeeling that by reason of my work on the specimens I had been deprived\r\nof a fair share of the chase, I arranged for Mr. Boyd to accompany the\r\nwagon on the return trip, that I might hunt through the bad lands west\r\nof the Buffalo Buttes, which I felt must contain some buffalo. Mr.\r\nRussell went northeast and Mr. McNaney accompanied me. About 4 miles\r\nfrom our late camp we came suddenly upon a fine old solitary bull,\r\nfeeding in a hollow between two high and precipitous ridges. After a\r\nshort but sharp chase I succeeded in getting a fair shot at him, and\r\nkilled him with a ball which broke his left humerus and passed into his\r\nlungs. He was the only large bull killed on the entire trip by a single\r\nshot. He proved to be a very fine specimen, measuring 5 feet 6 inches in\r\nheight at the shoulders. The wagon was overtaken and called back to get\r\nthe skin, and while it was coming I took a complete series of\r\nmeasurements and sketches of him as he lay.\r\n\r\nAlthough we removed the skin very quickly, and lost no time in again\r\nstarting the wagon to our permanent camp, the delay occasioned by the\r\ndeath of our twentieth buffalo,--which occurred on November 20,\r\nprecisely two months from the date of our leaving Washington to collect\r\ntwenty buffalo, it possible,--caused us all to be caught in a\r\nsnow-storm, which burst upon us from the northwest. The wagon had to be\r\nabandoned about 12 miles from camp in the bad lands. Mr. Brown packed\r\nthe bedding on one of the horses and rode the other, he and Boyd\r\nreaching camp about 9 o'clock that night in a blinding snow-storm. Of\r\ncoarse the skins in the wagon were treated with preservatives and\r\ncovered up. It proved to be over a week that the wagon and its load had\r\nto remain thus abandoned before it was possible to get to it and bring\r\nit to camp, and even then the task was one of great difficulty. In this\r\nconnection I can not refrain from recording the fact that the services\r\nrendered by Mr. W. Harvey Brown on all such trying occasions as the\r\nabove were invaluable. He displayed the utmost zeal and intelligence,\r\nnot only in the more agreeable kinds of work and sport incident to the\r\nhunt, but also in the disagreeable drudgery, such as team-driving and\r\nworking on half-frozen specimens in bitter cold weather.\r\n\r\nThe storm which set in on the 20th soon developed into a regular\r\nblizzard. A fierce and bitter cold wind swept down from the northwest,\r\ndriving the snow before it in blinding gusts. Had our camp been poorly\r\nsheltered we would have suffered, but at it was we were fairly\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nHaving thus completed our task (of getting twenty buffaloes), we were\r\nanxious to get out of that fearful country before we should get caught\r\nin serious difficulties with the weather, and it was arranged that\r\nPrivate C. S. West should ride to Fort Keogh as soon as possible, with a\r\nrequest for transportation. By the third day, November 23, the storm had\r\nabated sufficiently that Private West declared his willingness to start.\r\nIt was a little risky, but as he was to make only 10 miles the first day\r\nand stop at the =N=-bar camp on Sand Creek, it was thought safe to let\r\nhim go. He dressed himself warmly, took my revolver, in order not to be\r\nhampered with a rifle, and set out.\r\n\r\nThe next day was clear and fine, and we remarked it as an assurance of\r\nMr. West's safety during his ride from Sand Creek to the =LU=-bar ranch,\r\nhis second stopping-place. The distance was about 25 miles, through bad\r\nlands all the way, and it was the only portion of the route which caused\r\nme anxiety for our courier's safety. The snow on the levels was less\r\nthan 6 inches deep, the most of it having been blown into drifts and\r\nhollows; but although the coulées were all filled level to the top, our\r\ncourier was a man of experience and would know how to avoid them.\r\n\r\nThe 25th day of November was the most severe day of the storm, the\r\nmercury in our sheltered cañon sinking to -16 degrees. We had hoped to\r\nkill at least five more buffaloes by the time Private West should arrive\r\nwith the wagons; but when at the end of a week the storm had spent\r\nitself, the snow was so deep that hunting was totally impossible save in\r\nthe vicinity of camp, where there was nothing to kill. We expected the\r\nwagons by the 3d of December, but they did not come that day nor within\r\nthe next three. By the 6th the snow had melted off sufficiently that a\r\nbuffalo hunt was once more possible, and Mr. McNaney and I decided to\r\nmake a final trip to the Buffalo Buttes. The state of the ground made it\r\nimpossible for us to go there and return the same day, so we took a\r\npack-horse and arranged to camp out.\r\n\r\nWhen a little over half-way to our old rendezvous we came upon three\r\nbuffaloes in the bad grounds, one of which was an enormous old bull, the\r\nnext largest was an adult cow, and the third a two-year-old heifer. Mr.\r\nMcNaney promptly knocked down the old cow, while I devoted my attention\r\nto the bull; but she presently got up and made off unnoticed at the\r\nprecise moment Mr. McNaney was absorbed in watching my efforts to bring\r\ndown the old bull. After a short chase my horse carried me alongside my\r\nbuffalo, and as he turned toward me I gave him a shot through the\r\nshoulder, breaking the fore leg and bringing him promptly to the ground.\r\nI then turned immediately to pursue the young cow, but by that time she\r\nhad got on the farther side of a deep gully which was filled with snow,\r\nand by the time I got my horse safely across she had distanced me. I\r\nthen rode back to the old bull. When he saw me coming he got upon his\r\nfeet and ran a short distance, but was easily overtaken. He then stood\r\nat bay, and halting within 30 yards of him I enjoyed the rare\r\nopportunity of studying a live bull buffalo of the largest size on foot\r\non his native heath. I even made an outline sketch of him in my\r\nnote-book. Having studied his form and outlines as much as was really\r\nnecessary, I gave him a final shot through the lungs, which soon ended\r\nhis career.\r\n\r\nThis was a truly magnificent specimen in every respect. He was a\r\n\"stub-horn\" bull, about eleven years old, much larger every way than any\r\nof the others we collected. His height at the shoulder was 5 feet 8\r\ninches perpendicular, or 2 inches more than the next largest of our\r\ncollection. His hair was in remarkably fine condition, being long, fine,\r\nthick, and well colored. The hair in his frontlet is 16 inches in\r\nlength, and the thick coat of shaggy, straw-colored tufts which covered\r\nhis neck and shoulders measured 4 inches. His girth behind the fore leg\r\nwas 8 feet 4 inches, and his weight was estimated at 1,600 pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TROPHIES OF THE HUNT. Mounted by the author in the U. S.\r\nNational Museum. Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by\r\npermission of the publishers.]\r\n\r\nI was delighted with our remarkably good fortune in securing such a\r\nprize, for, owing to the rapidity with which the large buffaloes are\r\nbeing found and killed off these days, I had not hoped to capture a\r\nreally old individual. Nearly every adult bull we took carried old\r\nbullets in his body, and from this one we took four of various sizes\r\nthat had been fired into him on various occasions. One was found\r\nsticking fast in one of the lumbar vertebræ.[79]\r\n\r\n[Note 79: This specimen is now the commanding figure of the group of\r\nbuffalo which has recently been placed on exhibition in the Museum.]\r\n\r\nAfter a chase of several miles Mr. McNaney finally overhauled his cow\r\nand killed her, which brought the number of buffaloes taken on the fall\r\nhunt up to twenty-two. We spent the night at the Buffalo Buttes and\r\nreturned to camp the next day. Neither on that day nor the one following\r\ndid the wagons arrive, and on the evening of the 8th we learned from the\r\ncowboys of the =N=-bar camp on Sand Creek that our courier, Private West,\r\nhad not been seen or heard from since he left their camp on November 24,\r\nand evidently had got lost and frozen to death in the bad lands.\r\n\r\nThe next day we started out to search for Private West, or news of him,\r\nand spent the night with Messrs. Brodhurst and Andrews, at their camp on\r\nSand Creek. On the 10th, Mr. McNaney and I hunted through the bad lands\r\nover the course our courier should have taken, while Messrs. Russell and\r\nBrodhurst looked through the country around the head of the Little Dry.\r\nWhen McNaney and I reached the =LU=-bar ranch that night we were greatly\r\nrejoiced at finding that West was alive, although badly frost-bitten,\r\nand in Fort Keogh.\r\n\r\nIt appears that instead of riding due east to the =LU=-bar ranch, he\r\nlost his way in the bad lands, where the buttes all look alike when\r\ncovered with snow, and rode southwest. It is at all times an easy matter\r\nfor even a cowboy to get lost in Montana if the country is new to him,\r\nand when there is snow on the ground the difficulty of finding one's way\r\nis increased tenfold. There is not only the danger of losing one's way,\r\nbut the still greater danger of getting ingulfed in a deep coulée full\r\nof loose snow, which may easily cause both horse and rider to perish\r\nmiserably. Even the most experienced riders sometimes ride into coulées\r\nwhich are level full of snow and hidden from sight.\r\n\r\nPrivate West's experience was a terrible one, and also a wonderful case\r\nof self-preservation. It shows what a man with a cool head and plenty of\r\ngrit can go through and live. When he left us he wore two undershirts, a\r\nheavy blanket shirt, a soldier's blouse and overcoat, two pairs of\r\ndrawers, a pair of soldier's woolen trousers, and a pair of overalls. On\r\nhis feet he wore three pairs of socks, a pair of _low shoes_ with canvas\r\nleggins, and he started with his feet tied up in burlaps. His head and\r\nhands were also well protected. He carried a 38-caliber revolver, but,\r\nby a great oversight, only six matches. When he left the =N=-bar camp,\r\ninstead of going due east toward the =LU=-bar ranch, he swung around and\r\nwent southwest, clear around the head of the Little Dry, and finally\r\nstruck the Porcupine south of our camp. The first night out he made a\r\nfire with sage-brush, and kept it going all night. The second night he\r\nalso had a fire, but it took his last match to make it. During the first\r\nthree days he had no food, but on the fourth he shot a sage-cock with\r\nhis revolver, and ate it raw. This effort, however, cost him his last\r\ncartridge. Through hard work and lack of food his pony presently gave\r\nout, and necessitated long and frequent stops for rest. West's feet\r\nthreatened to freeze, and he cut off the skirts of his overcoat to wrap\r\nthem with, in place of the gunny sacking, that had been worn to rags.\r\nBeing afraid to go to sleep at night, he slept by snatches in the\r\nwarmest part of the day, while resting his horse.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th day he began to despair of succor, although he still toiled\r\nsouthward through the bad lands toward the Yellowstone, where people\r\nlived. On the envelopes which contained my letters he kept a diary of\r\nhis wanderings, which could tell his story when the cowboys would find\r\nhis body on the spring round-up.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the sixth day he found a trail and followed it until\r\nnearly night, when he came to Cree's sheep ranch, and found the solitary\r\nranchman at home. The warm-hearted frontiersman gave the starving\r\nwanderers, man and horse, such a welcome as they stood in need of. West\r\nsolemnly declares that in twenty-four hours he ate a whole sheep. After\r\ntwo or three days of rest and feeding both horse and rider were able to\r\ngo on, and in course of time reached Fort Keogh.\r\n\r\nWithout the loss of a single day Colonel Gibson started three teams and\r\nan escort up to us, and notwithstanding his terrible experience, West\r\nhad the pluck to accompany them as guide. His arrival among us once more\r\nwas like the dead coming to life again. The train reached our camp on\r\nthe 13th, and on the 15th we pulled out for Miles City, loaded to the\r\nwagon-bows with specimens, forage, and camp plunder.\r\n\r\nFrom our camp down to the =HV= ranch, at the mouth of Sand Creek, the\r\ntrail was in a terrible condition. But, thanks to the skill and judgment\r\nof the train-master, Mr. Ed. Haskins, and his two drivers, who also knew\r\ntheir business well, we got safely and in good time over the dangerous\r\npart of our road. Whenever our own tired and overloaded team got stuck\r\nin the mud, or gave out, there was always a pair of mules ready to hitch\r\non and help us out. As a train-master, Mr. Haskins was a perfect model,\r\nskillful, pushing, good-tempered, and very obliging.\r\n\r\nFrom the =HV= ranch to Miles City the trail was in fine condition, and\r\nwe went in as rapidly as possible, fearing to be caught in the\r\nsnow-storm which threatened us all the way in. We reached Miles City on\r\nDecember 20, with our collection complete and in fine condition, and the\r\nnext day a snow-storm set in which lasted until the 25th, and resulted\r\nin over a foot of snow. The ice running in the Yellowstone stopped all\r\nthe ferry-boats, and it was with good reason that we congratulated\r\nourselves on the successful termination of our hunt at that particular\r\ntime. Without loss of time Mr. Brown and I packed our collection, which\r\ntilled twenty-one large cases, turned in our equipage at Fort Keogh,\r\nsold our horses, and started on our homeward journey. In due course of\r\ntime the collection reached the Museum in good condition, and a series\r\nof the best specimens it contains has already been mounted.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is proper to acknowledge our great indebtedness to the\r\nSecretary of War for the timely co-operation of the War Department,\r\nwhich rendered the expedition possible. Our thanks are due to the\r\nofficers who were successively in command at Fort Keogh during our work,\r\nCol. John D. Wilkins, Col. George M. Gibson, and Lieut. Col. M. A.\r\nCochran, and their various staff officers; particularly Lieut. C. B.\r\nThompson, quartermaster, and Lieut. H. K. Bailey, adjutant. It is due\r\nthese officers to state that everything we asked for was cheerfully\r\ngranted with a degree of promptness which contributed very greatly to\r\nthe success of the hunt, and lightened its labors very materially.\r\n\r\nI have already acknowledged our indebtedness to the officers of the\r\nPennsylvania; the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul; and Northern Pacific\r\nrailways for the courtesies so liberally extended in our emergency. I\r\ntake pleasure in adding that all the officers and employés of the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railway with whom we had any relations, particularly\r\nMr. C. S. Fee, general passenger and ticket agent, treated our party\r\nwith the utmost kindness and liberality throughout the trip. We are in\r\nlike manner indebted to the officers of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St.\r\nPaul Railway for valuable privileges granted with the utmost cordiality.\r\n\r\nOur thanks are also due to Dr. J. C. Merrill, and to Mr. Henry R.\r\nPhillips, of the Phillips Land and Cattle Company, on Little Dry Creek,\r\nfor valuable information at a critical moment, and to the latter for\r\nhospitality and assistance in various ways, at times when both were\r\nkeenly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCounting the specimens taken in the spring, our total catch of buffalo\r\namounted to twenty-five head, and constituted as complete and fine a\r\nseries as could be wished for. I am inclined to believe that in size and\r\ngeneral quality of pelage the adult bull and cow selected and mounted\r\nfor our Museum group are not to be surpassed, even if they are ever\r\nequaled, by others of their kind.\r\n\r\nThe different ages and sexes were thus represented in our collection: 10\r\nold bulls, 1 young bull, 7 old cows, 4 young cows, 2 yearling calves, 1\r\nthree-months calf[80]; total, 25 specimens.\r\n\r\n[Note 80: Caught alive, but died in captivity July 26, 1886, and now in\r\nthe mounted group.]\r\n\r\nOur total collection of specimens of _Bison americanus_, including\r\neverything taken, contained the following: 24 fresh skins, 1 head skin,\r\n8 fresh skeletons, 8 dry skeletons, 51 dry skulls, 2 foetal young;\r\ntotal, 94 specimens.\r\n\r\nOur collection as a whole also included a fine series of skins and\r\nskeletons of antelope, deer of two species, coyotes, jack rabbits, sage\r\ngrouse (of which we prepared twenty-four rough skeletons for the\r\nDepartment of Comparative Anatomy), sharp tailed grouse, and specimens\r\nof all the other species of birds and small mammals to be found in that\r\nregion at that season. From this _matériel_ we now have on exhibition\r\nbesides the group of buffaloes, a family group of antelope, another of\r\ncoyotes, and another of prairie dogs, all with natural surroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE MOUNTED GROUP IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the Smithsonian expedition for bison which appeals most\r\nstrongly to the general public is the huge group of six choice specimens\r\nof both sexes and all ages, mounted with natural surroundings, and\r\ndisplayed in a superb mahogany case. The dimensions of the group are as\r\nfollows: Length, 16 feet; width, 12 feet, and height, 10 feet. The\r\nsubjoined illustration is a very fair representation of the principal\r\none of its four sides, and the following admirable description (by Mr.\r\nHarry P. Godwin), from the Washington _Star_ of March 10, 1888, is both\r\ngraphic and accurate:\r\n\r\nA SCENE FROM MONTANA--SIX OF MR. HORNADAY'S BUFFALOES FORM A PICTURESQUE\r\nGROUP--A BIT OF THE WILD WEST REPRODUCED AT THE NATIONAL\r\nMUSEUM--SOMETHING NOVEL IN THE WAY OF TAXIDERMY--REAL BUFFALO-GRASS,\r\nREAL MONTANA DIRT, AND REAL BUFFALOES.\r\n\r\nA little bit of Montana--a small square patch from the wildest part of\r\nthe wild West--has been transferred to the National Museum. It is so\r\nlittle that Montana will never miss it, but enough to enable one who has\r\nthe faintest glimmer of imagination to see it all for himself--the\r\nhummocky prairie, the buffalo-grass, the sage-brush, and the buffalo. It\r\nis as though a little group of buffalo that have come to drink at a pool\r\nhad been suddenly struck motionless by some magic spell, each in a\r\nnatural attitude, and then the section of prairie, pool, buffalo, and\r\nall had been carefully cut out and brought to the National Museum. All\r\nthis is in a huge glass case, the largest ever made for the Museum. This\r\ncase and the space about it, at the south end of the south hall, has\r\nbeen inclosed by high screens for many days while the taxidermist and\r\nhis assistants have been at work. The finishing touches were put on\r\nto-day, and the screens will be removed Monday, exposing to view what is\r\nregarded as a triumph of the taxidermist's art. The group, with its\r\naccessories, has been prepared so as to tell in an attractive way to the\r\ngeneral visitor to the Museum the story of the buffalo, but care has\r\nbeen taken at the same time to secure an accuracy of detail that will\r\nsatisfy the critical scrutiny of the most technical naturalist.\r\n\r\nTHE ACCESSORIES.\r\n\r\nThe pool of water is a typical alkaline water-hole, such as are found on\r\nthe great northern range of bison, and are resorted to for water by wild\r\nanimals in the fall when the small streams are dry. The pool is in a\r\ndepression in the dry bed of a coulée or small creek. A little mound\r\nthat rises beside the creek has been partially washed away by the water,\r\nleaving a crumbling bank, which shows the strata of the earth, a very\r\nthin layer of vegetable soil, beneath a stratum of grayish earth, and a\r\nlayer of gravel, from which protrude a fossil bone or two. The whole\r\nbank shows the marks of erosion by water. Near by the pool a small\r\nsection of the bank has fallen. A buffalo trail passes by the pool in\r\nfront. This is a narrow path, well beaten down, depressed, and bare of\r\ngrass. Such paths were made by herds of bison all over their pasture\r\nregion as they traveled down water-courses, in single file, searching\r\nfor water. In the grass some distance from the pool lie the bleaching\r\nskulls of two buffalo who have fallen victims to hunters who have\r\ncruelly lain in wait to get a shot at the animals as they come to\r\ndrink. Such relics, strewn all over the plain, tell the story of the\r\nextermination of the American bison. About the pool and the sloping\r\nmound grow the low buffalo-grass, tufts of tall bunch-grass and\r\nsage-brush, and a species of prickly pear. The pool is clear and\r\ntranquil. About its edges is a white deposit of alkali. These are the\r\nscenic accessories of the buffalo group, but they have an interest\r\nalmost equal to that of the buffaloes themselves, for they form really\r\nand literally a genuine bit of the West. The homesick Montana cowboy,\r\nfar from his wild haunts, can here gaze upon his native sod again; for\r\nthe sod, the earth that forms the face of the bank, the sage-brush, and\r\nall were brought from Montana--all except the pool. The pool is a glassy\r\ndelusion, and very perfect in its way. One sees a plant growing beneath\r\nthe water, and in the soft, oozy bottom, near the edge, are the deep\r\nprints made by the fore feet of a big buffalo bull. About the soft,\r\nmoist earth around the pool, and in the buffalo trail are the\r\nfoot-tracks of the buffalo that have tramped around the pool, some of\r\nthose nearest the edge having filled with water.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIX BUFFALOES.\r\n\r\nThe group comprises six buffaloes. In front of the pool, as if just\r\ngoing to drink, is the huge buffalo bull, the giant of his race, the\r\nlast one that was secured by the Smithsonian party in 1888, and the one\r\nthat is believed to be the largest specimen of which there is authentic\r\nrecord. Near by is a cow eight years old, a creature that would be\r\nconsidered of great dimensions in any other company than that of the big\r\nbull. Near the cow is a suckling calf, four months old. Upon the top of\r\nthe mound is a \"spike\" bull, two and a half years old; descending the\r\nmound away from the pool is a young cow three years old, on one side,\r\nand on the other a male calf a year and a half old. All the members of\r\nthe group are disposed in natural attitudes. The young cow is snuffing\r\nat a bunch of tall grass; the old bull and cow are turning their heads\r\nin the same direction apparently, as if alarmed by something\r\napproaching; the others, having slaked their thirst, appear to be moving\r\ncontentedly away. The four months' old calf was captured alive and\r\nbrought to this city. It lived for some days in the Smithsonian grounds,\r\nbut pined for its prairie home, and finally died. It is around the great\r\nbull that the romance and main interest of the group centers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if Providence had ordained that this splendid animal,\r\nperfect in limb, noble in size, should be saved to serve as a monument\r\nto the greatness of his race, that once roamed the prairies in myriads.\r\nBullets found in his body showed that he had been chased and hunted\r\nbefore, but fate preserved him for the immortality of a Museum exhibit.\r\nHis vertical height at the shoulders is 5 feet 8 inches. The thick hair\r\nadds enough to his height to make it full 6 feet. The length of his head\r\nand body is 9 feet 2 inches, his girth 8 feet 4 inches and his weight\r\nis, or was, about 1,600 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TAXIDERMIST'S OBJECT LESSONS.\r\n\r\nThis group, with its accessories, is, in point of size, about the\r\nbiggest thing ever attempted by a taxidermist. It was mounted by Mr.\r\nHornaday, assisted by Messrs. J. Palmer and A. H. Forney. It represents\r\na new departure in mounting specimens for museums. Generally such\r\nspecimens have been mounted singly, upon a flat surface. The American\r\nmammals, collected by Mr. Hornaday, will be mounted in a manner that\r\nwill make each piece or group an object lesson, telling something of the\r\nhistory and the habits of the animal. The first group produced as one of\r\nthe results of the Montana hunt comprised three coyotes. Two of them are\r\nstruggling, and one might almost say snarling, over a bone. They do not\r\nstand on a painted board, but on a little patch of soil. Two other\r\ngroups designed by Mr. Hornaday, and executed by Mr. William Palmer, are\r\nabout to be placed in the Museum. One of these represents a family of\r\nprairie-dogs. They are disposed about a prairie-dog mound. One sits on\r\nits haunches eating; others are running about. Across the mouth of the\r\nburrow, just ready to disappear into it, is another one, startled for\r\nthe moment by the sudden appearance of a little burrowing owl that has\r\nalighted on one side of the burrow. The owl and the dog are good friends\r\nand live together in the same burrow, but there appears to be strained\r\nrelations between the two for the moment.\r\n\r\nMAP ILLUSTRATING THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON.\r\nPrepared by W.
