The\r\n     son of a physician, he studied medicine in Edinburgh, and after\r\n     obtaining his degree of M.B., in 1873, he settled at Goole,\r\n     Yorkshire. Fired by the unfinished work of Braid, Bernheim and\r\n     Liébeault, he began, in 1889, a series of hypnotic researches,\r\n     which, together with a number of successful experiments he had\r\n     privately conducted, created considerable stir in the medical\r\n     world. Abandoning his general practice and settling in London in\r\n     1892, Dr. Bramwell became one of the foremost authorities in the\r\n     country on hypnotism as a curative agent. His Works include many\r\n     valuable treatises, the most important being \"Hypnotism: its\r\n     History, Practice and Theory,\" published in 1903, and here\r\n     summarised for the WORLD'S GREATEST BOOKS by Dr. Bramwell himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Pioneers of Hypnotism_\r\n\r\nJust as chemistry arose from alchemy, astronomy from astrology, so\r\nhypnotism had its origin in mesmerism. Phenomena such as Mesmer\r\ndescribed had undoubtedly been observed from early times, but to his\r\nwork, which extended from 1756 to his death, in 1815, we owe the\r\nscientific interest which, after much error and self-deception, finally\r\nled to what we now term hypnotism.\r\n\r\nJohn Elliotson (1791-1868), the foremost physician of his day, was the\r\nleader of the mesmeric movement in England. In 1837, after seeing\r\nDupotet's work, he commenced to experiment at University College\r\nHospital, and continued, with remarkable success, until ordered to\r\ndesist by the council of the college. Elliotson felt the insult keenly,\r\nindignantly resigned his appointments, and never afterwards entered the\r\nhospital he had done so much to establish. Despite the persistent and\r\nvirulent attacks of the medical press, he continued his mesmeric\r\nresearches up to the time of his death, sacrificing friends, income and\r\nreputation to his beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe fame of mesmerism spread to India, where, in 1845, James Esdaile\r\n(1808-1859), a surgeon in the East India Company, determined to\r\ninvestigate the subject. He was in charge of the Native Hospital at\r\nHooghly, and successfully mesmerised a convict before a painful\r\noperation. Encouraged by this, he persevered, and, at the end of a year,\r\nreported 120 painless operations to the government. Investigations were\r\ninstituted, and Esdaile was placed in charge of a hospital at Calcutta,\r\nfor the express purpose of mesmeric practice; he continued to occupy\r\nsimilar posts until he left India in 1851. He recorded 261 painless\r\ncapital operations and many thousand minor ones, and reduced the\r\nmortality for the removal of the enormous tumours of elephantiasis from\r\n50 to 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Elliotson and Esdaile, the phenomena of mesmerism were\r\nentirely physical in origin. They were supposed to be due to the action\r\nof a vital curative fluid, or peculiar physical force, which, under\r\ncertain circumstances, could be transmitted from one human being to\r\nanother. This was usually termed the \"od,\" or \"odylic,\" force; various\r\ninanimate objects, such as metals, crystals and magnets, were supposed\r\nto possess it, and to be capable of inducing and terminating the\r\nmesmeric state, or of exciting or arresting its phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe name of James Braid (1795-1860) is familiar to all students of\r\nhypnotism. Braid was a Scottish surgeon, practising in Manchester, where\r\nhe had already gained a high reputation as a skilful surgeon, when, in\r\n1841, he first began to investigate mesmerism. He successfully\r\ndemonstrated that the phenomena were entirely subjective. He published\r\n\"Neurypnology, or the Rationale of Nervous Sleep,\" in 1843, and invented\r\nthe terminology we now use. This was followed by other more or less\r\nimportant works, of which I have been able to trace forty-one, but all\r\nhave been long out of print.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteen years Braid devoted to the study of hypnotism, his\r\nviews underwent many changes and modifications. In his first theory, he\r\nexplained hypnosis from a physical standpoint; in the second, he\r\nconsidered it to be a condition of involuntary monoideism and\r\nconcentration, while his third theory differed from both. He recognised\r\nthat reason and volition were unimpaired, and that the attention could\r\nbe simultaneously directed to more points than one. The condition,\r\ntherefore, was not one of monoideism. He realised more and more that the\r\nstate was a conscious one, and that the losses of memory which followed\r\non waking could always be restored in subsequent hypnoses. Finally, he\r\ndescribed as \"double consciousness\" the condition he had first termed\r\n\"hypnotic,\" then \"monoideistic.\"\r\n\r\nBraid maintained an active interest in hypnotism up to his death, and,\r\nindeed, three days before it, sent his last MS. to Dr. Azam, of\r\nBordeaux, \"as a mark of esteem and regard.\" Sympathetic notices appeared\r\nin the press after his death, all of which bore warm testimony to his\r\nprofessional character. Although hypnotic work practically ceased in\r\nEngland at Braid's death, the torch he had lighted passed into France.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Dr. A.A. Liébeault (1823-1900) began to study hypnotism\r\nseriously, and four years later gave up general practice, settled in\r\nNancy, and practised hypnotism gratuitously among the poor. For twenty\r\nyears his labours were unrecognised, then Bernheim (one of whose\r\npatients Liébeault had cured) came to see him, and soon became a zealous\r\npupil. The fame of the Nancy school spread, Liébeault's name became\r\nknown throughout the world, and doctors flocked to study the new\r\ntherapeutic method.\r\n\r\nWhile Liébeault's work may justly be regarded as a continuation of\r\nBraid's, there exists little difference between the theories of Charcot\r\nand the Salpêtrière school and those of the later mesmerists.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Theory of Hypnotism_\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of Braid's latest theories: (1) Hypnosis\r\ncould not be induced by physical means alone. (2) Hypnotic and so-called\r\nmesmeric phenomena were subjective in origin, and both were excited by\r\ndirect or by indirect suggestion. (3) Hypnosis was characterised by\r\nphysical as well as by psychical changes. (4) The simultaneous\r\nappearance of several phenomena was recognised, and much importance was\r\nattached to the intelligent action of a secondary consciousness. (5)\r\nVolition was unimpaired, moral sense increased, and suggested crime\r\nimpossible. (6) _Rapport_ was a purely artificial condition created by\r\nsuggestion. (7) The importance of direct verbal suggestion was fully\r\nrecognised, as also the mental influence of physical methods. Suggestion\r\nwas regarded as the device used for exciting the phenomena, and not\r\nconsidered as sufficient to explain them. (8) Important differences\r\nexisted between hypnosis and normal sleep. (9) Hypnotic phenomena might\r\nbe induced without the subject having passed through any condition\r\nresembling sleep. (10) The mentally healthy were the easiest, the\r\nhysterical the most difficult, to influence.\r\n\r\nIn England, during Braid's lifetime, his earlier views were largely\r\nadopted by certain well-known men of science, particularly by Professors\r\nW.B. Carpenter and J. Hughes Bennett, but they appear to have known\r\nlittle or nothing of his latest theories. Bennett's description of the\r\nprobable mental and physical conditions involved in the state Braid\r\ndescribed as \"monoideism\" is specially worthy of note. Not only is it\r\ninteresting in itself, but it serves also as a standard of comparison\r\nwith which to measure the theories of later observers, who have\r\nattempted to explain hypnosis by cerebral inhibition, psychical\r\nautomatism, or both these conditions combined.\r\n\r\n(a) _Physiological._--According to Bennett, hypnosis was characterised\r\nby alterations in the functional activity of the nerve tubes of the\r\nwhite matter of the cerebral lobes. He suggested that a certain\r\nproportion of these became paralysed through continued monotonous\r\nstimulation; while the action of others was consequently exalted. As\r\nthese tubes connected the cerebral ganglion-cells, suspension of their\r\nfunctions was assumed to bring with it interruption of the connection\r\nbetween the ganglion-cells.\r\n\r\n(b) _Psychical._--From the psychical side, he explained the phenomena of\r\nhypnosis by the action of predominant and unchecked ideas. These were\r\nable to obtain prominence from the fact that other ideas, which, under\r\nordinary circumstances, would have controlled their development, did not\r\narise, because the portion of the brain with which the latter were\r\nassociated had its action temporarily suspended--_i.e._, the connection\r\nbetween the ganglion-cells was broken, owing to the interrupted\r\nconnection between the \"fibres of association.\" Thus, he said, the\r\nremembrance of a sensation could always be called up by the brain; but,\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, from the exercise of judgment, comparison,\r\nand other mental faculties, we knew it was only a remembrance. When\r\nthese faculties were exhausted, the suggested idea predominated, and the\r\nindividual believed in its reality. Thus, he attributed to the faculties\r\nof the mind a certain power of correcting the fallacies which each of\r\nthem was likely to fall into; just as the illusions of one sense were\r\ncapable of being detected by the healthy use of the other senses. There\r\nwere mental and sensorial illusions, the former caused by predominant\r\nideas and corrected by proper reasoning, the latter caused by perversion\r\nof one sense and corrected by the right application of the others.\r\n\r\nIn hypnosis, according to this theory, a suggested idea obtained\r\nprominence and caused mental and sensorial illusions, because the check\r\naction--the inhibitory power--of certain higher centres had been\r\ntemporarily suspended. These theories were first published by Professor\r\nBennett in 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Hypnotic Induction_\r\n\r\nThe methods by which hypnosis is induced have been classed as follows:\r\n(1) physical; (2) psychical; (3) those of the magnetisers. The modern\r\noperator, whatever his theories may be, borrows his technique from\r\nMesmer and Liébeault with equal impartiality, and thus renders\r\nclassification impossible. The members of the Nancy school, while\r\nasserting that everything is due to suggestion, do not hesitate to use\r\nphysical means, and, if these fail, Bernheim has recourse to narcotics.\r\n\r\nThe following is now my usual method: I rarely begin treatment the first\r\ntime I see a patient, but confine myself to making his acquaintance,\r\nhearing his account of his case, and ascertaining his mental attitude\r\nwith regard to suggestion. I usually find, from the failure of other\r\nmethods of treatment, that he is more or less sceptical as to the chance\r\nof being benefited. I endeavour to remove all erroneous ideas, and\r\nrefuse to begin treatment until the patient is satisfied of the safety\r\nand desirability of the experiment. I never say I am certain of being\r\nable to influence him, but explain how much depends on his mental\r\nattitude and power of carrying out my directions. I further explain to\r\nthe patient that next time he comes to see me I shall ask him to close\r\nhis eyes, to concentrate his attention on some drowsy mental picture,\r\nand try to turn it away from me. I then make suggestions of two kinds:\r\nthe first refer to the condition I wish to induce while he is actually\r\nin the armchair, thus, \"Each time you see me, you will find it easier to\r\nconcentrate your attention on something restful. I do not wish you to go\r\nto sleep, but if you can get into the drowsy condition preceding natural\r\nsleep, my suggestions are more likely to be responded to.\" I explain\r\nthat I do not expect this to happen at once, although it does occur in\r\nrare instances, but it is the repetition of the suggestions made in this\r\nparticular way which brings about the result. Thus, from the very first\r\ntreatment, the patient is subjected to two distinct processes, the\r\nobject of one being to induce the drowsy, suggestible condition, that of\r\nthe other to cure or relieve disease.\r\n\r\nI wish particularly to mention that although I speak of hypnotism and\r\nhypnosis--and it is almost impossible to avoid doing so--I rarely\r\nattempt to induce so-called hypnosis, and find that patients respond to\r\ntreatment as readily, and much more quickly, now that I start curative\r\nsuggestions and treatment simultaneously, than they did in the days when\r\nI waited until hypnosis was induced before making curative suggestions.\r\n\r\nI have obtained good results in treating all forms of hysteria,\r\nincluding _grande hysterie_, neurasthenia, certain forms of insanity,\r\ndipsomania and chronic alcoholism, morphinomania and other drug habits,\r\nvicious and degenerate children, obsessions, stammering, chorea,\r\nseasickness, and all other forms of functional nervous disturbances.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to discuss the different theories in detail here, but I\r\nwill briefly summarise the more important points, (1) Hypnotism, as a\r\nscience, rests on the recognition of the subjective nature of its\r\nphenomena. (2) The theories of Charcot and the Salpêtrière school are\r\npractically a reproduction of mesmeric error. (3) Liébeault and his\r\nfollowers combated the views of the Salpêtrière school and successfully\r\nsubstituted their own, of which the following are the important points:\r\n(_a_) Hypnosis is a physiological condition, which can be induced in the\r\nhealthy. (_b_) In everyone there is a tendency to respond to suggestion,\r\nbut in hypnosis this condition is artificially increased. (_c_)\r\nSuggestion explains all. Despite the fact that the members of the Nancy\r\nschool regard the condition as purely physiological and simply an\r\nexaggeration of the normal, they consider it, in its profound stages at\r\nall events, a form of automatism.\r\n\r\nThese and other views of the Nancy school have been questioned by\r\nseveral observers. As Myers justly pointed out, although suggestion is\r\nthe artifice used to excite the phenomena, it does not create the\r\ncondition on which they depend. The peculiar state which enables the\r\nphenomena to be evoked is the essential thing, not the signal which\r\nprecedes their appearance.\r\n\r\nWithin recent times another theory has arisen, which, instead of\r\nexplaining hypnotism by the arrested action of some of the brain centres\r\nwhich subserve normal life, attempts to do so by the arousing of certain\r\npowers over which we normally have little or no control. This theory\r\nappears under different names, \"Double Consciousness,\" \"Das Doppel-Ich,\"\r\netc., and the principle on which it depends is largely admitted by\r\nscience. William James, for example, says: \"In certain persons, at\r\nleast, the total possible consciousness may be split into parts which\r\nco-exist, but mutually ignore each other.\"\r\n\r\nThe clearest statement of this view was given by the late Frederic\r\nMyers; he suggested that the stream of consciousness in which we\r\nhabitually lived was not our only one. Possibly our habitual\r\nconsciousness might be a mere selection from a multitude of thoughts\r\nand sensations--some, at least, equally conscious with those we\r\nempirically knew. No primacy was granted by this theory to the ordinary\r\nwaking self, except that among potential selves it appeared the fittest\r\nto meet the needs of common life. As a rule, the waking life was\r\nremembered in hypnosis, and the hypnotic life forgotten in the waking\r\nstate; this destroyed any claim of the primary memory to be the sole\r\nmemory. The self below the threshold of ordinary consciousness Myers\r\ntermed the \"subliminal consciousness,\" and the empirical self of common\r\nexperience the \"supraliminal.\" He held that to the subliminal\r\nconsciousness and memory a far wider range, both of physiological and\r\npsychical activity, was open than to the supraliminal. The latter was\r\ninevitably limited by the need of concentration upon recollections\r\nuseful in the struggle for existence; while the former included much\r\nthat was too rudimentary to be retained in the supraliminal memory of an\r\norganism so advanced as that of man. The recollection of processes now\r\nperformed automatically and needing no supervision, passed out of the\r\nsupraliminal memory, but might be retained by the subliminal. The\r\nsubliminal, or hypnotic, self could exercise over the vaso-motor and\r\ncirculatory systems a degree of control unparalleled in waking life.\r\n\r\nThus, according to the Nancy school, the deeply hypnotised subject\r\nresponds automatically to suggestion before his intellectual centres\r\nhave had time to bring their inhibitory action into play; but, on the\r\nother hand, in the subliminal consciousness theory, volition and\r\nconsciousness are recognised to be unimpaired in hypnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--Curative Value of Hypnotism_\r\n\r\nThe intelligent action of the secondary self may be illustrated by the\r\nexecution of certain post-hypnotic acts. Thus, one of my patients who,\r\nat a later period, consented to become the subject of experiment,\r\ndeveloped an enormously increased power of time appreciation. If told,\r\nduring hypnosis, for example, that she was to perform some specific act\r\nin the waking state at the expiration of a complicated number of\r\nminutes, as, for example, 40,825, she generally carried out the\r\nsuggestion with absolute accuracy. In this and similar experiments,\r\nthree points were noted. (1) The arithmetical problems were far beyond\r\nher normal powers; (2) she normally possessed no special faculty for\r\nappreciating time; (3) her waking consciousness retained no recollection\r\nof the experimental suggestions or of anything else that had occurred\r\nduring hypnosis.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the exact value of suggestion in connection\r\nwith other forms of treatment. There are one or two broad facts which\r\nought to be kept in mind.\r\n\r\n1. Suggestion is a branch of medicine, which is sometimes combined by\r\nthose who practise it with other forms of treatment. Thus it is often\r\ndifficult to say what proportion of the curative results is due to\r\nhypnotism and what to other remedies.\r\n\r\n2. On the other hand, many cases of functional nervous disorder have\r\nrecovered under suggestive treatment after the continued failure of\r\nother methods. Further, the diseases which are frequently cured are\r\noften those in which drugs are of little or no avail. For example, what\r\nmedicine would one prescribe for a man in good physical health who had\r\nsuddenly become the prey of an obsession? Such patients are rarely\r\ninsane; they recognise that the idea which torments them is morbid; but\r\nyet they are powerless to get rid of it.\r\n\r\n3. In estimating the results of suggestive treatment, it must not be\r\nforgotten that the majority of cases are extremely unfavourable ones. As\r\nthe value of suggestion and its freedom from danger become more fully\r\nrecognised, it will doubtless be employed in earlier stages of disease.\r\n\r\n4. It should be clearly understood that the object of all suggestive\r\ntreatment ought to be the development of the patient's will power and\r\ncontrol of his own organism. Much disease would be prevented if we could\r\ndevelop and control moral states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUFFON\r\n\r\nNatural History\r\n\r\n     Georges Louis Leclerc, created in 1773 Comte de Buffon, was born at\r\n     Montbard, in France, on September 7, 1707. Evincing a marked bent\r\n     for science he became, in 1739, director of the Jardin du Roi and\r\n     the King's Museum in Paris. He had long contemplated the\r\n     preparation of a complete History of Nature, and now proceeded to\r\n     carry out the work. The first three volumes of the \"Histoire\r\n     Naturelle, Générale et Particulière\" appeared in 1749, and other\r\n     volumes followed at frequent intervals until his death at Paris on\r\n     April 16, 1788. Buffon's immense enterprise was greeted with\r\n     abounding praise by most of his contemporaries. On July 1, 1752, he\r\n     was elected to the French Academy in succession to Languet de\r\n     Gergy, Archbishop of Sens, and, at his reception on August 25 in\r\n     the following year, pronounced the oration in which occurred the\r\n     memorable aphorism, \"Le style est l'homme même\" (The style is the\r\n     very man). Buffon also anticipated Thomas Carlyle's definition of\r\n     genius (\"which means the transcendent capacity of taking trouble,\r\n     first of all\") by his famous axiom, \"Le génie n'est autre chose\r\n     qu'une grande aptitude à la patience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scope of the Work_\r\n\r\nBuffon planned his \"Natural History\" on an encyclopaedic scale. His\r\npoint of view was unique. Natural history in its widest sense, he tells\r\nus, embraces every object in the visible universe. The obvious divisions\r\nof the subject, therefore, are, first, the earth, the air, and the\r\nwater; then the animals--quadrupeds, birds, fishes, and so\r\non--inhabiting each of these \"elements,\" to use the phrase of his day.\r\nNow, Buffon argued, if man were required to give some account of the\r\nanimals by which he was surrounded, of course he would begin with those\r\nwith which he was most familiar, as the horse, the dog, the cow. From\r\nthese he would proceed to the creatures with which he was less familiar,\r\nand finally deal--through the medium of travellers' tales and other\r\nsources of information--with the denizens of field, forest and flood in\r\nforeign lands. In similar fashion he would consider the plants,\r\nminerals, and other products of Nature, in addition to recounting the\r\nmarvels revealed to him by astronomy.\r\n\r\nWhatever its defects on the scientific side, Buffon's plan was\r\nsimplicity itself, and was adopted largely, if not entirely, in\r\nconsequence of his contempt--real or affected--for the systematic method\r\nof the illustrious Linnæus. Having charted his course, the rest was\r\nplain sailing. He starts with the physical globe, discussing the\r\nformation of the planets, the features of the earth--mountains, rivers,\r\nseas, lakes, tides, currents, winds, volcanoes, earthquakes, islands,\r\nand so forth--and the effects of the encroachment and retreat of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nAnimate nature next concerns him. After comparing animals, plants and\r\nminerals, he proceeds to study man literally from the cradle to the\r\ngrave, garnishing the narrative with those incursions into the domains\r\nof psychology, physiology and hygiene, which, his detractors insinuated,\r\nrendered his work specially attractive and popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--The Four-Footed Animals_\r\n\r\nSuch questions occupied the first three volumes, and the ground was now\r\ncleared for the celebrated treatise on Quadrupeds, which filled no fewer\r\nthan twelve volumes, published at various dates from 1753 (vol. iv.) to\r\n1767 (vol. xv., containing the New World monkeys, indexes, and the\r\nlike). Buffon's _modus operandi_ saved him from capital blunders. Though\r\ninordinately vain--\"I know but five great geniuses,\" he once said;\r\n\"Newton, Bacon, Leibniz, Montesquieu, and myself\"--he was quite\r\nconscious of his own limitations, and had the common-sense to entrust to\r\nDaubenton the description of the anatomy and other technical matters as\r\nto which his own knowledge was comparatively defective. He reserved to\r\nhimself what may be called the \"literary\" aspect of his theme, recording\r\nthe place of each animal in history, and relating its habits with such\r\ngusto as his ornate and grandiose style permitted.\r\n\r\nAfter a preliminary dissertation on the nature of animals, Buffon\r\nplunges into an account of those that have been domesticated or tamed.\r\nPreference of place is given to the horse, and his method of treatment\r\nis curiously anticipatory of modern lines. Beginning with some notice of\r\nthe horse in history, he goes on to describe its appearance and habits\r\nand the varieties of the genus, ending (by the hand of Daubenton) with\r\nan account of its structure and physiology. As evidence of the pains he\r\ntook to collect authority for his statements, it is of interest to\r\nmention that he illustrates the running powers of the English horse by\r\nciting the instance of Thornhill, the postmaster of Stilton, who, in\r\n1745, wagered he would ride the distance from Stilton to London thrice\r\nin fifteen consecutive hours. Setting out from Stilton, and using eight\r\ndifferent horses, he accomplished his task in 3 hours 51 minutes. In the\r\nreturn journey he used six horses, and took 3 hours 52 minutes. For the\r\nthird race he confined his choice of horses to those he had already\r\nridden, and, selecting seven, achieved the distance in 3 hours 49\r\nminutes. He performed the undertaking in 11 hours and 32 minutes. \"I\r\ndoubt,\" comments Buffon, \"whether in the Olympic Games there was ever\r\nwitnessed such rapid racing as that displayed by Mr. Thornhill.\"\r\n\r\nJustice having been done to it, the horse gives place to the ass, ox,\r\nsheep, goat, pig, dog, and cat, with which he closes the account of the\r\ndomesticated animals, to which three volumes are allotted. It is\r\nnoteworthy that Buffon frequently, if not always, gives the synonyms of\r\nthe animals' names in other languages, and usually supports his textual\r\nstatements by footnote references to his authorities.\r\n\r\nWhen he comes to the Carnivores--\"les animaux nuisibles\"--the defects of\r\nBuffon's higgledy-piggledy plan are almost ludicrously evident, for\r\nflesh-eaters, fruit-eaters, insect-eaters, and gnawers rub shoulders\r\nwith colossal indifference. Doubtless, however, this is to us all the\r\nmore conspicuous, because use and wont have made readers of the present\r\nday acquainted with the advantages of classification, which it is but\r\nfair to recognise has been elaborated and perfected since Buffon's time.\r\n\r\nAs his gigantic task progressed, Buffon's difficulties increased. At the\r\nbeginning of vol. xii. (1764) he intimates that, with a view to break\r\nthe monotony of a narrative in which uniformity is an unavoidable\r\nfeature, he will in future, from time to time, interrupt the general\r\ndescription by discourses on Nature and its effects on a grand scale.\r\nThis will, he naively adds, enable him to resume \"with renewed courage\"\r\nhis account of details the investigation of which demands \"the calmest\r\npatience, and affords no scope for genius.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--The Birds_\r\n\r\nScarcely had he finished the twelve volumes of Quadrupeds when Buffon\r\nturned to the Birds. If this section were less exacting, yet it made\r\nenormous claims upon his attention, and nine volumes were occupied\r\nbefore the history of the class was concluded. Publication of \"Des\r\nOiseaux\" was begun in 1770, and continued intermittently until 1783. But\r\ntroubles dogged the great naturalist. The relations between him and\r\nDaubenton had grown acute, and the latter, unwilling any longer to put\r\nup with Buffon's love of vainglory, withdrew from the enterprise to\r\nwhich his co-operation had imparted so much value. Serious illness,\r\nalso, and the death of Buffon's wife, caused a long suspension of his\r\nlabours, which were, however, lightened by the assistance of Guéneau de\r\nMontbéliard.\r\n\r\nOne stroke of luck he had, which no one will begrudge the weary Titan.\r\nJames Bruce, of Kinnaird, on his return from Abyssinia in 1773, spent\r\nsome time with Buffon at his château in Montbard, and placed at his\r\ndisposal several of the remarkable discoveries he had made during his\r\ntravels. Buffon was not slow to appreciate this godsend. Not only did\r\nhe, quite properly, make the most of Bruce's disinterested help, but he\r\nalso expressed the confident hope that the British Government would\r\ncommand the publication of Bruce's \"precious\" work. He went on to pay a\r\ncompliment to the English, and so commit them to this enterprise. \"That\r\nrespectable nation,\" he asserts, \"which excels all others in discovery,\r\ncan but add to its glory in promptly communicating to the world the\r\nresults of the excellent travellers' researches.\"\r\n\r\nStill unfettered by any scheme of classification, either scientific or\r\nlogical, Buffon begins his account of the birds with the eagles and\r\nowls. To indicate his course throughout the vast class, it will suffice\r\nto name a few of the principal birds in the order in which he takes them\r\nafter the birds of prey. These, then, are the ostrich, bustard, game\r\nbirds, pigeons, crows, singing birds, humming birds, parrots, cuckoos,\r\nswallows, woodpeckers, toucans, kingfishers, storks, cranes, secretary\r\nbird, herons, ibis, curlews, plovers, rails, diving birds, pelicans,\r\ncormorants, geese, gulls, and penguins. With the volume dealing with the\r\npicarian birds (woodpeckers) Buffon announces the withdrawal of Guéneau\r\nde Montbéliard, and his obligations for advice and help to the Abbé\r\nBexon (1748-1784), Canon of Sainte Chapelle in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Supplement and Sequel_\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the Birds volumes were passing through the press,\r\nBuffon also issued periodically seven volumes of a supplement\r\n(1774-1789), the last appearing posthumously under the editorship of\r\nCount Lacépède. This consisted of an olla podrida of all sorts of\r\npapers, such as would have won the heart of Charles Godfrey Leland. The\r\nnature of the hotchpotch will be understood from a recital of some of\r\nits contents, in their chronological order. It opened with an\r\nintroduction to the history of minerals, partly theoretical (concerning\r\nlight, heat, fire, air, water, earth, and the law of attraction), and\r\npartly experimental (body heat, heat in minerals, the nature of\r\nplatinum, the ductility of iron). Then were discussed incandescence,\r\nfusion, ships' guns, the strength and resistance of wood, the\r\npreservation of forests and reafforestation, the cooling of the earth,\r\nthe temperature of planets, additional observations on quadrupeds\r\nalready described, accounts of animals not noticed before, such as the\r\ntapir, quagga, gnu, nylghau, many antelopes, the vicuña, Cape ant-eater,\r\nstar-nosed mole, sea-lion, and others; the probabilities of life (a\r\nsubject on which the author plumed himself), and his essay on the Epochs\r\nof Nature.\r\n\r\nNor did these concurrent series of books exhaust his boundless energy\r\nand ingenuity, for in the five years preceding his death (1783-1788), he\r\nproduced his \"Natural History of Minerals\" in five volumes, the last of\r\nwhich was mainly occupied with electricity, magnetism, and the\r\nloadstone. It is true that the researches of modern chemists have\r\nwrought havoc with Buffon's work in this field; but this was his\r\nmisfortune rather than his fault, and leaves untouched the quantity of\r\nhis output.\r\n\r\nBuffon invoked the aid of the artist almost from the first, and his\r\n\"Natural History\" is illustrated by hundreds of full-page copper-plate\r\nengravings, and embellished with numerous elegant headpiece designs. The\r\nfigures of the animals are mostly admirable examples of portraiture,\r\nthough the classical backgrounds lend a touch of the grotesque to many\r\nof the compositions. Illustrations of anatomy, physiology, and other\r\nfeatures of a technical character are to be numbered by the score, and\r\nare, of course, indispensable in such a work. The _editio princeps_ is\r\ncherished by collectors because of the 1,008 coloured plates (\"Planches\r\nEnluminées\") in folio, the text itself being in quarto, by the younger\r\nDaubenton, whose work was spiritedly engraved by Martinet. Apparently\r\nanxious to illustrate one section exhaustively rather than several\r\nsections in a fragmentary manner, the artist devoted himself chiefly to\r\nthe birds, which monopolise probably nine-tenths of the plates, and to\r\nwhich he may also have been attracted by their gorgeous plumages.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the labourer's task was over, his scientific friends thought\r\nthe best monument which they could raise to his memory was to complete\r\nhis \"Natural History.\" This duty was discharged by two men, who, both\r\nwell qualified, worked, however, on independent lines. Count Lacépède,\r\nadhering to the format of the original, added two volumes on the\r\nReptiles (1788-1789), five on the Fishes (1798-1803), and one on the\r\nCetaceans (1804). Sonnini de Manoncourt (1751-1812), feeling that this\r\nedition, though extremely handsome, was cumbersome, undertook an\r\nentirely new edition in octavo. This was begun in 1797, and finished in\r\n1808. It occupied 127 volumes, and, Lacépède's treatises not being\r\navailable, Sonnini himself dealt with the Fishes (thirteen volumes) and\r\nWhales (one volume), P.A. Latreille with the Crustaceans and Insects\r\n(fourteen volumes), Denys-Montfort with the Molluscs (six volumes), F.M.\r\nDandin with the Reptiles (eight volumes), and C.F. Brisseau-Mirbel and\r\nN. Jolyclerc with the Plants (eighteen volumes). Sonnini's edition\r\nconstituted the cope-stone of Buffon's work, and remained the best\r\nedition, until the whole structure was thrown down by the views of later\r\nnaturalists, who revolutionised zoology.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--Place and Doctrine_\r\n\r\nBuffon may justly be acclaimed as the first populariser of natural\r\nhistory. He was, however, unscientific in his opposition to systems,\r\nwhich, in point of fact, essentially elucidated the important doctrine\r\nthat a continuous succession of forms runs throughout the animal\r\nkingdom. His recognition of this principle was, indeed, one of his\r\ngreatest services to the science.\r\n\r\nAnother of his wise generalisations was that Nature proceeds by unknown\r\ngradations, and consequently cannot adapt herself to formal analysis,\r\nsince she passes from one species to another, and often from one genus\r\nto another, by shades of difference so delicate as to be wholly\r\nimperceptible.\r\n\r\nIn Buffon's eyes Nature is an infinitely diversified whole which it is\r\nimpossible to break up and classify. \"The animal combines all the powers\r\nof Nature; the forces animating it are peculiarly its own; it wishes,\r\ndoes, resolves, works, and communicates by its senses with the most\r\ndistant objects. One's self is a centre where everything agrees, a point\r\nwhere all the universe is reflected, a world in miniature.\" In natural\r\nhistory, accordingly, each animal or plant ought to have its own\r\nbiography and description.\r\n\r\nLife, Buffon also held, abides in organic molecules. \"Living beings are\r\nmade up of these molecules, which exist in countless numbers, which may\r\nbe separated but cannot be destroyed, which pierce into brute matter,\r\nand, working there, develop, it may be animals, it may be plants,\r\naccording to the nature of the matter in which they are lodged. These\r\nindestructible molecules circulate throughout the universe, pass from\r\none being to another, minister to the continuance of life, provide for\r\nnutrition and the growth of the individual, and determine the\r\nreproduction of the species.\"\r\n\r\nBuffon further taught that the quantity and quality of life pass from\r\nlower to higher stages--in Tennysonian phrase, men \"rise on\r\nstepping-stones of their dead selves to higher things\"--and showed the\r\nunity and structure of all beings, of whom man is the most perfect type.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that Buffon in a measure anticipated Lamarck and\r\nDarwin. He had already foreseen the mutability of species, but had not\r\nsucceeded in proving it for varieties and races. If he asserted that the\r\nspecies of dog, jackal, wolf and fox were derived from a single one of\r\nthese species, that the horse came from the zebra, and so on, this was\r\nfar from being tantamount to a demonstration of the doctrine. In fact,\r\nhe put forward the mutability of species rather as probable theory than\r\nas established truth, deeming it the corollary of his views on the\r\nsuccession and connection of beings in a continuous series.\r\n\r\nSome case may be made out for regarding Buffon as the founder of\r\nzoogeography; at all events he was the earliest to determine the natural\r\nhabitat of each species. He believed that species changed with climate,\r\nbut that no kind was found throughout all the globe. Man alone has the\r\nprivilege of being everywhere and always the same, because the human\r\nrace is one. The white man (European or Caucasian), the black man\r\n(Ethiopian), the yellow man (Mongol), and the red man (American) are\r\nonly varieties of the human species. As the Scots express it with wonted\r\npith, \"We're a' Jock Tamson's bairns.\"\r\n\r\nAs to his geological works, Buffon expounded two theories of the\r\nformation of the globe. In his \"Théorie de la Terre\" he supported the\r\nNeptunists, who attributed the phenomena of the earth to the action of\r\nwater. In his \"Epoques de la Nature\" he amplified the doctrines of\r\nLeibniz, and laid down the following propositions: (1) The earth is\r\nelevated at the equator and depressed at the poles in accordance with\r\nthe laws of gravitation and centrifugal force; (2) it possesses an\r\ninternal heat, apart from that received from the sun; (3) its own heat\r\nis insufficient to maintain life; (4) the substances of which the earth\r\nis composed are of the nature of glass, or can be converted into glass\r\nas the result of heat and fusion--that is, are verifiable; (5)\r\neverywhere on the surface, including mountains, exist enormous\r\nquantities of shells and other maritime remains.\r\n\r\nTo the theses just enumerated Buffon added what he called the\r\n\"monuments,\" or what Hugh Miller, a century later, more aptly described\r\nas the Testimony of the Rocks. From a consideration of all these things,\r\nBuffon at length arrived at his succession of the Epochs, or Seven Ages\r\nof Nature, namely: (1) the Age of fluidity, or incandescence, when the\r\nearth and planets assumed their shape; (2) the Age of cooling, or\r\nconsolidation, when the rocky interior of the earth and the great\r\nvitrescible masses at its surface were formed; (3) the Age when the\r\nwaters covered the face of the earth; (4) the Age when the waters\r\nretreated and volcanoes became active; (5) the Age when the elephant,\r\nhippopotamus, rhinoceros, and other giants roamed through the northern\r\nhemisphere; (6) the Age of the division of the land into the vast areas\r\nnow styled the Old and the New Worlds; and (7) the Age when Man\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT CHAMBERS\r\n\r\nVestiges of Creation\r\n\r\n     Robert Chambers was born in Peebles, Scotland, July 10, 1802, and\r\n     died at St. Andrews on March 17, 1871. He was partner with his\r\n     brother in the publishing firm of W. & R. Chambers, was editor of\r\n     \"Chambers's Journal,\" and was author of several works when he\r\n     published anonymously, in October 1844, the work by which his name\r\n     will always be remembered, \"Vestiges of the Natural History of\r\n     Creation.\" His previous works, some thirty in number, did not deal\r\n     with science, and his labour in preparing his masterpiece was\r\n     commensurate with the courage which such an undertaking involved.\r\n     When the book was published, such interest and curiosity as to its\r\n     authorship were aroused that we have to go back to the publication\r\n     of \"Waverley\" for a parallel. Little else was talked about in\r\n     scientific circles. The work was violently attacked by many hostile\r\n     critics, F.W. Newman, author of an early review, being a\r\n     conspicuous exception. In the historical introduction to the\r\n     \"Origin of Species,\" Darwin speaks of the \"brilliant and powerful\r\n     style\" of the \"Vestiges,\" and says that \"it did excellent service\r\n     in this country in calling attention to the subject, in removing\r\n     prejudice, and in thus preparing the ground for the reception of\r\n     analogous views.\" Darwin's idea of selection as the key to the\r\n     history of species does not occur in the \"Vestiges,\" which belongs\r\n     to the Lamarckian school of unexamined belief in the hereditary\r\n     transmission of the effects of use and disuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--The Reign of Universal Law_\r\n\r\nThe stars are suns, and we can trace amongst them the working of the\r\nlaws which govern our sun and his family. In these universal laws we\r\nmust perceive intelligence; something of which the laws are but as the\r\nexpressions of the will and power. The laws of Nature cannot be regarded\r\nas primary or independent causes of the phenomena of the physical world.\r\nWe come, in short, to a Being beyond Nature--its author, its God;\r\ninfinite, inconceivable, it may be, and yet one whom these very laws\r\npresent to us with attributes showing that our nature is in some way a\r\nfaint and far-cast shadow of His, while all the gentlest and the most\r\nbeautiful of our emotions lead us to believe that we are as children in\r\nHis care and as vessels in His hand. Let it then be understood--and this\r\nfor the reader's special attention--that when natural law is spoken of\r\nhere, reference is made only to the mode in which the Divine Power is\r\nexercised. It is but another phrase for the action of the ever-present\r\nand sustaining God.\r\n\r\nViewing Nature in this light, the pursuit of science is but the seeking\r\nof a deeper acquaintance with the Infinite. The endeavour to explain any\r\nevents in her history, however grand or mysterious these may be, is only\r\nto sit like a child at a mother's knee, and fondly ask of the things\r\nwhich passed before we were born; and in modesty and reverence we may\r\neven inquire if there be any trace of the origin of that marvellous\r\narrangement of the universe which is presented to our notice. In this\r\ninquiry we first perceive the universe to consist of a boundless\r\nmultitude of bodies with vast empty spaces between. We know of certain\r\nmotions among these bodies; of other and grander translations we are\r\nbeginning to get some knowledge. Besides this idea of locality and\r\nmovement, we have the equally certain one of a former soft and more\r\ndiffused state of the materials of these bodies; also a tolerably clear\r\none as to gravitation having been the determining cause of both locality\r\nand movement. From these ideas the general one naturally suggested to us\r\nis--a former stage in the frame of material things, perhaps only a point\r\nin progress from some other, or a return from one like the\r\npresent--universal space occupied with gasiform matter. This, however,\r\nwas of irregular constitution, so that gravitation caused it to break up\r\nand gather into patches, producing at once the relative localities of\r\nastral and solar systems, and the movements which they have since\r\nobserved, in themselves and with regard to each other--from the daily\r\nspinning of single bodies on their own axes, to the mazy dances of vast\r\nfamilies of orbs, which come to periods only in millions of years.\r\n\r\nHow grand, yet how simple the whole of this process--for a God only to\r\nconceive and do, and yet for man, after all, to trace out and ponder\r\nupon. Truly must we be in some way immediate to the august Father, who\r\ncan think all this, and so come into His presence and council, albeit\r\nonly to fall prostrate and mutely adore.\r\n\r\nNot only are the orbs of space inextricably connected in the manner\r\nwhich has been described, but the constitution of the whole is uniform,\r\nfor all consist of the same chemical elements. And now, in our version\r\nof the romance of Nature, we descend from the consideration of\r\norb-filled space and the character of the universal elements, to trace\r\nthe history of our own globe. And we find that this falls significantly\r\ninto connection with the primary order of things suggested by Laplace's\r\ntheory of the origin of the solar system in a vast nebula or fire-mist,\r\nwhich for ages past has been condensing under the influence of\r\ngravitation and the radiation of its heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--History of the Earth's Crust_\r\n\r\nWhen we study the earth's crust we find that it consists of layers or\r\nstrata, laid down in succession, the earlier under the influence of\r\nheat, the later under the influence of water. These strata in their\r\norder might be described as a record of the state of life upon our\r\nplanet from an early to a comparatively recent period. It is truly such\r\na record, but not one perfectly complete.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we find a noteworthy and significant sequence. We learn\r\nthat there was dry land long before the occurrence of the first fossils\r\nof land plants and animals. In different geographical formations we\r\nfind various species, though sometimes the same species is found in\r\ndifferent formations, having survived the great earth changes which the\r\nrecord of the rocks indicates. There is an unbroken succession of animal\r\nlife from the beginning to the present epoch. Low down, where the\r\nrecords of life begin, we find an era of backboneless animals only, and\r\nthe animal forms there found, though various, are all humble in their\r\nrespective lines of gradation.\r\n\r\nThe early fishes were low, both with respect to their class as fishes,\r\nand the order to which they belong--that of the cartilaginous or gristly\r\nfishes. In all the orders of ancient animals there is an ascending\r\ngradation of character from first to last. Further, there is a\r\nsuccession from low to high types in fossil plants, from the earliest\r\nstrata in which they are found to the highest. Several of the most\r\nimportant living species have left no record of themselves in any\r\nformation beyond what are, comparatively speaking, modern. Such are the\r\nsheep and the goat, and such, above all, is our own species. Compared\r\nwith many humbler animals, man is a being, as it were, of yesterday.\r\n\r\nThus concludes the wondrous section of the earth's history which is told\r\nby geology. It takes up our globe at an early stage in the formation of\r\nits crust--conducts it through what we have every reason to believe were\r\nvast spaces of time, in the course of which many superficial changes\r\ntook place, and vegetable and animal life was gradually evolved--and\r\ndrops it just at the point when man was apparently about to enter on the\r\nscene. The compilation of such a history, from materials of so\r\nextraordinary a character, and the powerful nature of the evidence which\r\nthese materials afford, are calculated to excite our admiration, and the\r\nresult must be allowed to exalt the dignity of science as a product of\r\nman's industry and his reason.\r\n\r\nIt is now to be remarked that there is nothing in the whole series of\r\noperations displayed in inorganic geology which may not be accounted for\r\nby the agency of the ordinary forces of Nature. Those movements of\r\nsubterranean force which thrust up mountain ranges and upheaved\r\ncontinents stand in inextricable connection, on the one hand, with the\r\nvolcanoes which are yet belching forth lavas and shaking large tracts of\r\nground, as, on the other, with the primitive incandescent state of the\r\nearth. Those forces which disintegrated the early rocks, of which\r\ndetritus formed new beds at the bottom of the sea, are still seen at\r\nwork to the same effect.\r\n\r\nTo bring these truths the more nearly before us, it is possible to make\r\na substance resembling basalt in a furnace; limestone and sandstone have\r\nboth been formed from suitable materials in appropriate receptacles; the\r\nphenomena of cleavage have, with the aid of electricity, been simulated\r\non a small scale, and by the same agent crystals are formed. In short,\r\nthe remark which was made regarding the indifference of the cosmical\r\nlaws to the scale on which they operated is to be repeated regarding the\r\ngeological.\r\n\r\nA common furnace will sometimes exemplify the operation of forces which\r\nhave produced the Giant's Causeway; and in a sloping ploughed field\r\nafter rain we may often observe, at the lower end of a furrow, a handful\r\nof washed and neatly deposited mud or sand, capable of serving as an\r\nillustration of the way in which Nature has produced the deltas of the\r\nNile and Ganges. In the ripple-marks on sandy beaches of the present day\r\nwe see Nature's exact repetition of the operations by which she\r\nimpressed similar features on the sandstones of the carboniferous era.\r\nEven such marks as wind-slanted rain would in our day produce on\r\ntide-deserted sands have been read upon tablets of the ancient strata.\r\n\r\nIt is the same Nature--that is to say, God through or in the manner of\r\nNature--working everywhere and in all time, causing the wind to blow,\r\nand the rain to fall, and the tide to ebb and flow, inconceivable ages\r\nbefore the birth of our race, as now. So also we learn from the conifers\r\nof those old ages that there were winter and summer upon earth, before\r\nany of us lived to liken the one to all that is genial in our own\r\nnature, or to say that the other breathed no airs so unkind as man's\r\ningratitude. Let no one suppose there is any necessary disrespect for\r\nthe Creator in thus tracing His laws in their minute and familiar\r\noperations. There is really no true great and small, grand and familiar,\r\nin Nature. Such only appear when we thrust ourselves in as a point from\r\nwhich to start in judging. Let us pass, if possible, beyond immediate\r\nimpressions, and see all in relation to Cause, and we shall chastenedly\r\nadmit that the whole is alike worshipful.\r\n\r\nThe Creator, then, is seen to have formed our earth, and effected upon\r\nit a long and complicated series of changes, in the same manner in which\r\nwe find that he conducts the affairs of Nature before our living eyes;\r\nthat is, in the manner of natural law. This is no rash or unauthorised\r\naffirmation. It is what we deduce from the calculation of a Newton and a\r\nLaplace on the one hand, and from the industrious observation of facts\r\nby a Murchison and a Lyell on the other. It is a point of stupendous\r\nimportance in human knowledge; here at once is the whole region of the\r\ninorganic taken out of the dominion of marvel, and placed under an idea\r\nof Divine regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--The History of the Earth's Life_\r\n\r\nMixed up, however, with the geological changes, and apparently as final\r\nobject connected with the formation of the globe itself, there is\r\nanother set of phenomena presented in the course of our history--the\r\ncoming into existence, namely, of a long suite of living things,\r\nvegetable and animal, terminating in the families which we still see\r\noccupying the surface. The question arises: In what manner has this set\r\nof phenomena originated? Can we touch at and rest for a moment on the\r\npossibility of plants and animals having likewise been produced in a\r\nnatural way, thus assigning immediate causes of but one character for\r\neverything revealed to our sensual observation; or are we at once to\r\nreject this idea, and remain content, either to suppose that creative\r\npower here acted in a different way, or to believe unexaminingly that\r\nthe inquiry is one beyond our powers? Taking the last question first, I\r\nwould reply that I am extremely loth to imagine that there is anything\r\nin Nature which we should, for any reason, refrain from examining. If we\r\ncan infer aught from the past history of science, it is that the whole\r\nof Nature is a legitimate field for the exercise of our intellectual\r\nfaculties; that there is a connection between this knowledge and our\r\nwell-being; and that, if we may judge from things once despaired of by\r\nour inquiring reason, but now made clear and simple, there is none of\r\nNature's mysteries which we may not hopefully attempt to penetrate. To\r\nremain idly content to presume a various class of immediate causes for\r\norganic Nature seems to me, on this ground, equally objectionable.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the other question the idea has several times arisen\r\nthat some natural course was observed in the production of organic\r\nthings, and this even before we were permitted to attain clear\r\nconclusions regarding inorganic nature. It was always set quickly aside\r\nas unworthy of serious consideration. The case is different now, when we\r\nhave admitted law in the whole domain of the inorganic.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the absurdities into which we should be led must strike every\r\nreflecting mind. The Eternal Sovereign arranges a solar or an astral\r\nsystem, by dispositions imparted primordially to matter; he causes, by\r\nthe same means, vast oceans to join and continents to rise, and all the\r\ngrand meteoric agencies to proceed in ceaseless alternation, so as to\r\nfit the earth for a residence of organic beings. But when, in the course\r\nof these operations, fuci and corals are to be, for the first time,\r\nplaced in these oceans, a change in his plan of administration is\r\nrequired. It is not easy to say what is presumed to be the mode of his\r\noperations. The ignorant believe the very hand of Deity to be at work.\r\nAmongst the learned, we hear of \"creative fiats,\" \"interferences,\"\r\n\"interpositions of the creative energy,\" all of them very obscure\r\nphrases, apparently not susceptible of a scientific explanation, but all\r\ntending simply to this: that the work was done in a marvellous way, and\r\nnot in the way of Nature.\r\n\r\nBut we need not assume two totally distinct modes of the exercise of the\r\ndivine power--one in the course of inorganic nature and the other in\r\nintimately connected course of organic nature.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when all the evidence is surveyed, it seems difficult to resist\r\nthe impression that vestiges, at least, are seen of the manner and\r\nmethod of the Creator in this part of His work. It appears to be a case\r\nin which rigid proof is hardly to be looked for. But such evidences as\r\nexist are remarkably consistent and harmonious. The theory pointed to\r\nconsorts with everything else which we have learned accurately regarding\r\nthe history of the universe. Science has not one positive affirmation on\r\nthe other side. Indeed, the view opposed to it is not one in which\r\nscience is concerned; it appears as merely one of the prejudices formed\r\nin the non-age of our race.\r\n\r\nFor the history, then, of organic nature, I embrace, not as a proved\r\nfact, but as a rational interpretation of things as far as science has\r\nrevealed them, the idea of progressive development. We contemplate the\r\nsimplest and most primitive types of being as giving birth to a type\r\nsuperior to it; this again producing the next higher, and so on to the\r\nhighest. We contemplate, in short, a universal gestation of Nature, like\r\nthat of the individual being, and attended as little by circumstances of\r\na miraculous kind as the silent advance of an ordinary mother from one\r\nweek to another of her pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThus simple--after ages of marvelling--appears organic creation, while\r\nyet the whole phenomena are, in another point of view, wonders of the\r\nhighest kind, being the undoubted results of ordinances arguing the\r\nhighest attributes of foresight, skill and goodness on the part of their\r\nDivine Author.\r\n\r\nIf, finally, we study the mind of man, we find that its Almighty Author\r\nhas destined it, like everything else, to be developed from inherent\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nThus the whole appears complete on one principle. The masses of space\r\nare formed by law; law makes them in due time theatres of existence for\r\nplants and animals; sensation, disposition, intellect, are all in like\r\nmanner sustained in action by law.\r\n\r\nIt is most interesting to observe into how small a field the whole of\r\nthe mysteries of Nature thus ultimately resolve themselves. The\r\ninorganic has been thought to have one final comprehensive\r\nlaw--gravitation. The organic, the other great department of mundane\r\nthings, rests in like manner on one law, and that is--development. Nor\r\nmay even these be after all twain, but only branches of one still more\r\ncomprehensive law, the expression of a unity flowing immediately from\r\nthe One who is first and last.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--The Future and its Meaning_\r\n\r\nThe question whether the human race will ever advance far beyond its\r\npresent position in intellect and morals is one which has engaged much\r\nattention. Judging from the past, we cannot reasonably doubt that great\r\nadvances are yet to be made; but, if the principle of development be\r\nadmitted, these are certain, whatever may be the space of time required\r\nfor their realisation. A progression resembling development may be\r\ntraced in human nature, both in the individual and in large groups of\r\nmen. Not only so, but by the work of our thoughtful brains and busy\r\nhands we modify external nature in a way never known before. The\r\nphysical improvements wrought by man upon the earth's surface I conceive\r\nas at once preparations for, and causes of, the possible development of\r\nhigher types of humanity, beings less strong in the impulsive parts of\r\nour nature, more strong in the reasoning and moral, more fitted for the\r\ndelights of social life, because society will then present less to dread\r\nand more to love.\r\n\r\nThe history and constitution of the world have now been hypothetically\r\nexplained, according to the best lights which a humble individual has\r\nfound within the reach of his perceptive and reasoning faculties.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a system in which all is regularity and order, and all\r\nflows from, and is obedient to, a divine code of laws of unbending\r\noperation. We are to understand from what has been laid before us that\r\nman, with his varied mental powers and impulses, is a natural problem of\r\nwhich the elements can be taken cognisance of by science, and that all\r\nthe secular destinies of our race, from generation to generation, are\r\nbut evolutions of a law statuted and sustained in action by an all-wise\r\nDeity.\r\n\r\nThere may be a faith derived from this view of Nature sufficient to\r\nsustain us under all sense of the imperfect happiness, the calamities,\r\nthe woes and pains of this sphere of being. For let us but fully and\r\ntruly consider what a system is here laid open to view and we cannot\r\nwell doubt that we are in the hands of One who is both able and willing\r\nto do us the most entire justice. Surely, in such a faith we may well\r\nrest at ease, even though life should have been to us but a protracted\r\nmalady. Thinking of all the contingencies of this world as to be in time\r\nmelted into or lost in some greater system, to which the present is only\r\nsubsidiary, let us wait the end with patience and be of good cheer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGES CUVIER\r\n\r\nThe Surface of the Globe\r\n\r\n     Georges Cuvier was born Aug. 24, 1769, at Montbéliard, France. He\r\n     had a brilliant academic career at Stuttgart Academy, and in 1795,\r\n     at the age of twenty-six, he was appointed assistant professor of\r\n     comparative anatomy at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris,\r\n     and was elected a member of the National Institute. From this date\r\n     onwards to his death in 1832, his scientific industry was\r\n     remarkable. Both as zoologist and palæontologist he must be\r\n     regarded as one of the greatest pioneers of science. He filled many\r\n     important scientific posts, including the chair of Natural History\r\n     in the Collège de France, and a professorship at the Jardin des\r\n     Plantes. In 1808 he was made member of the Council of the Imperial\r\n     University; and in 1814, President of the Council of Public\r\n     Instruction. In 1826 he was made grand officer of the Legion of\r\n     Honour, and five years later was made a peer of France. The\r\n     \"Discours sur les Révolutions de la Surface du Globe,\" published in\r\n     1825, is essentially a preliminary discourse to the author's\r\n     celebrated work, \"Recherches sur les Ossemens fossiles de\r\n     Quadrupèdes.\" It is an endeavour to trace the relationship between\r\n     the changes which have taken place on the surface of the globe and\r\n     the changes which have taken place in its animal inhabitants, with\r\n     especial reference to the evidence afforded by fossil remains of\r\n     quadrupeds. \"It is apparent,\" Cuvier writes, \"that the bones of\r\n     quadrupeds conduct us, by various reasonings, to more precise\r\n     results than any other relics of organised bodies.\" The two books\r\n     together may be considered the first really scientific\r\n     palæontology.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Effects of Geological Change_\r\n\r\nMy first object will be to show how the fossil remains of the\r\nterrestrial animals are connected with the theory of the earth. I shall\r\nafterwards explain the principles by which fossil bones may be\r\nidentified. I shall give a rapid sketch of new species discovered by the\r\napplication of these principles. I shall then show how far these\r\nvarieties may extend, owing to the influence of the climate and\r\ndomestication. I shall then conceive myself justified in concluding that\r\nthe more considerable differences which I have discovered are the\r\nresults of very important catastrophes. Afterwards I shall explain the\r\npeculiar influence which my researches should exercise on the received\r\nopinions concerning the revolutions of the globe. Finally, I shall\r\nexamine how far the civil and religious history of nations accords with\r\nthe results of observation on the physical history of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen we traverse those fertile plains, where tranquil waters cherish, as\r\nthey flow, an abundant vegetation, and where the soil, trod by a\r\nnumerous people, adorned with flourishing villages, rich cities, and\r\nsuperb monuments, is never disturbed save by the ravages of war, or the\r\noppression of power, we can hardly believe that Nature has also had her\r\ninternal commotions. But our opinions change when we dig into this\r\napparently peaceful soil, or ascend its neighboring hills. The lowest\r\nand most level soils are composed of horizontal strata, and all contain\r\nmarine productions to an innumerable extent. The hills to a very\r\nconsiderable height are composed of similar strata and similar\r\nproductions. The shells are sometimes so numerous as to form the entire\r\nmass of the soil, and all quarters of the globe exhibit the same\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe time is past when ignorance could maintain that these remains of\r\norganised bodies resulted from the caprice of Nature, and were\r\nproductions formed in the bosom of the earth by its generative powers;\r\nfor a scrupulous comparison of the remains shows not the slightest\r\ndifference between the fossil shells and those that are now found in the\r\nocean. It is clear, then, that they inhabited the sea, and that they\r\nwere deposited by the sea in the places where they are now found; and it\r\nfollows, too, that the sea rested in these places long enough to form\r\nregular, dense, vast deposits of aquatic animals.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the sea, accordingly, must have undergone some change either\r\nin extent or situation.\r\n\r\nFurther, we find under the horizontal strata, _inclined_ strata. Thus\r\nthe sea, previously to the formation of the horizontal strata, must have\r\nformed others, which have been broken, inclined, and overturned by some\r\nunknown causes.\r\n\r\nMore than this, we find that the fossils vary with the depth of the\r\nstrata, and that the fossils of the deeper and more ancient strata\r\nexhibit a formation proper to themselves; and we find in some of the\r\nstrata, too, remains of terrestrial life.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is thus plain that the animal life in the sea has varied,\r\nand that parts of the earth's surface have been alternately dry land and\r\nocean. The very soil, which terrestrial animals at present inhabit has a\r\nhistory of previous animal life, and then submersion under the sea.\r\n\r\nThe reiterated irruptions and retreats of the sea have not all been\r\ngradual, but, on the contrary, they have been produced by sudden\r\ncatastrophes. The last catastrophe, which inundated and again left dry\r\nour present continents, left in the northern countries the carcasses of\r\nlarge quadrupeds, which were frozen, and which are preserved even to the\r\npresent day, with their skin, hair and flesh. Had they not been frozen\r\nthe moment they were killed, they must have putrefied; and, on the other\r\nhand, the intense frost could not have been the ordinary climatic\r\ncondition, for they could not have existed at such low temperatures. In\r\nthe same instant, then, in which these animals perished the climate\r\nwhich they inhabited must have undergone a complete revolution.\r\n\r\nThe ruptures, the inclinations, the overturnings of the more ancient\r\nstrata, likewise point to sudden and violent changes.\r\n\r\nAnimal life, then, has been frequently disturbed on this earth by\r\nterrific catastrophes. Living beings innumerable have perished. The\r\ninhabitants of the dry land have been engulfed by deluges; and the\r\ntenants of the water, deserted by their element, have been left to\r\nperish from drought.\r\n\r\nEven ancient rocks formed or deposited before the appearance of life on\r\nthe earth show signs of terrific violence.\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained by some that the causes now at work altering the\r\nface of the world are sufficient to account for all the changes through\r\nwhich it has passed: but that is not so. None of the agents Nature now\r\nemploys--rain, thaw, rivers, seas, volcanoes--would have been adequate\r\nto produce her ancient works.\r\n\r\nTo explain the external crust of the world, we require causes other than\r\nthose present in operation, and a thousand extraordinary theories have\r\nbeen advanced. Thus, according to one philosopher, the earth has\r\nreceived in the beginning a uniform light crust which caused the abysses\r\nof the ocean, and was broken to produce the Deluge. Another supposed the\r\nDeluge to be caused by the momentary suspension of the cohesion of\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nEven accomplished scientists and philosophers have advanced impossible\r\nand contradictory theories.\r\n\r\nAll attempts at explanation have been stultified by an ignorance of the\r\nfacts to be explained, or by a partial survey of them, and especially by\r\na neglect of the evidence afforded by fossils. How was it possible not\r\nto perceive that the theory of the earth owes its origin to fossils\r\nalone? They alone, in truth, inform us with any certainty that the earth\r\nhas not always had the same covering, since they certainly must have\r\nlived upon its surface before they were buried in its depths. If there\r\nwere only strata without fossils, one might maintain that the strata had\r\nall been formed together. Hitherto, in fact, philosophers have been at\r\nvariance on every point save one, and that is that the sea has changed\r\nits bed; and how could this have been known except for fossils?\r\n\r\nFrom this consideration I was led to study fossils; and since the field\r\nwas immense I was obliged to specialise in one department of fossils,\r\nand selected for study the fossil bones of quadrupeds. I made this\r\nselection because only from a study of fossil quadrupeds can one hope to\r\nascertain the number and periods and contents of irruptions of the sea;\r\nand because, since the number of quadrupeds is limited, and most\r\nquadrupeds known, we have better means of assuring ourselves if the\r\nfossil remains are remains of extinct or extant animals. Animals such as\r\nthe griffin, the cartazonon, the unicorn, never lived, and there are\r\nprobably very few quadrupeds now living which have not been found by\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBut though the study of fossil quadruped be enlightening, it has its own\r\nspecial difficulties. One great difficulty arises from the fact that it\r\nis very rare to find a fossil skeleton approaching to a complete state.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, there is a principle in comparative anatomy which\r\nlessens this difficulty. Every organised being constitutes a complete\r\nand compact system with all its parts in mutual correspondence. None of\r\nits parts can be changed without changing other parts, and consequently\r\neach part, taken separately, indicates the others.\r\n\r\nThus, if the intestines of an animal are made to digest raw flesh, its\r\njaws must be likewise constructed to devour prey, its claws to seize and\r\ntear it, its teeth to rend it, its limbs to overtake it, its organs of\r\nsense to discern it afar. Again, in order to enable the jaw to seize\r\nwith facility, a certain form of condyle is necessary, and the zygomatic\r\narch must be well developed to give attachment to the masseter muscle.\r\nAgain, the muscles of the neck must be powerful, whence results a\r\nspecial form in the vertebræ and the occiput, where the muscles are\r\nattached. Yet again, in order that the claws may be effective, the\r\ntoe-bones must have a certain form, and must have muscles and tendons\r\ndistributed in a certain way. In a word, the form of the tooth\r\nnecessitates the form of the condyle, of the shoulder-blade, and of the\r\nclaws, of the femur, and of all the other bones, and all the other bones\r\ntaken separately will give the tooth. In this manner anyone who is\r\nscientifically acquainted with the laws of organic economy may from a\r\nfragment reconstruct the whole animal. The mark of a cloven hoof is\r\nsufficient to tell the form of the teeth and jaws and vertebræ and\r\nleg-bones and thigh-bones and pelvis of the animal. The least fragment\r\nof bone, the smallest apophysis, has a determinative character in\r\nrelation to the class, the order, the genus, and species to which it may\r\nbelong. This is so true that, if we have only a single extremity of bone\r\nwell preserved, we may, with application and a skilful use of analogy\r\nand exact comparison, determine all those points with as much certainty\r\nas if we were in possession of the entire animal. By the application of\r\nthese principles we have identified and classified the fossil remains of\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty mammalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--What the Fossils Teach_\r\n\r\nAn examination of the fossils on the lines I have indicated shows that\r\nout of one hundred and fifty mammiferous and oviparous quadrupeds,\r\nninety are unknown to present naturalists, and that in the older layers\r\nsuch oviparous quadrupeds as the ichthyosauri and plesiosauri abound.\r\nThe fossil elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and the mastodons\r\nare not found in the more ancient layers. In fact, the species which\r\nappear the same as ours are found only in superficial deposits.\r\n\r\nNow, it cannot be held that the present races of animals differ from\r\nthe ancient races merely by modifications produced by local\r\ncircumstances and change of climate--for if species gradually changed,\r\nwe must find traces of these gradual modifications, and between the\r\npalæotheria and the present species we should have discovered some\r\nintermediate formation; but to the present time none of these have\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nWhy have not the bowels of the earth preserved the monuments of so\r\nremarkable a genealogy unless it be that the species of former ages were\r\nas constant as our own, or at least because the catastrophe that\r\ndestroyed them had not left them time to give evidence of the changes?\r\n\r\nFurther, an examination of animals shows that though their superficial\r\ncharacteristics, such as colour and size, are changeable, yet their more\r\nradical characteristics do not change. Even the artificial breeding of\r\ndomestic animals can produce only a limited degree of variation. The\r\nmaximum variation known at the present time in the animal kingdom is\r\nseen in dogs, but in all the varieties the relations of the bones remain\r\nthe same and the shape of the teeth undergoes no palpable change.\r\n\r\nI know that some naturalists rely much on the thousands of ages which\r\nthey can accumulate with a stroke of the pen; but there is nothing which\r\nproves that time will effect any more than climate and a state of\r\ndomestication. I have endeavoured to collect the most ancient documents\r\nof the forms of animals. I have examined the engravings of animals\r\nincluding birds on the numerous columns brought from Egypt to Rome. M.\r\nSaint Hilaire collected all the mummies of animals he could obtain in\r\nEgypt--cats, ibises, birds of prey, dogs, monkeys, crocodiles, etc.--and\r\nwe cannot find any more difference between them and those of the present\r\nday than between human mummies of that date and skeletons of the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, then, in known facts which can support the opinion\r\nthat the new genera discovered among fossils--the palæotheria,\r\nanoplotheria, megalonyces, mastodontes, pterodactyli, ichthyosauri,\r\netc.--could have been the sources of any animals now existing, which\r\nwould differ only by the influence of time or climate.\r\n\r\nAs yet no human bones have been discovered in the regular layers of the\r\nsurface of the earth, so that man probably did not exist in the\r\ncountries where fossil bones are found at the epoch of the revolutions\r\nwhich buried these bones, for there cannot be assigned any reason why\r\nmankind should have escaped such overwhelming catastrophes, or why human\r\nremains should not be discovered. Man _may_ have inhabited some confined\r\ntract of country which escaped the catastrophe, but his establishment in\r\nthe countries where the fossil remains of land animals are found--that\r\nis to say, in the greatest part of Europe, Asia, and America--is\r\nnecessarily posterior not only to the revolutions which covered these\r\nbones, but even to those which have laid open the strata which envelop\r\nthem; whence it is clear that we can draw neither from the bones\r\nthemselves nor from the rocks which cover them any argument in favour of\r\nthe antiquity of the human species in these different countries. On the\r\ncontrary, in closely examining what has taken place on the surface of\r\nthe globe, since it was left dry for the last time, we clearly see that\r\nthe last revolution, and consequently the establishment of present\r\nsociety, cannot be very ancient. An examination of the amount of\r\nalluvial matter deposited by rivers, of the progress of downs, and of\r\nother changes on the surface of the earth, informs us clearly that the\r\npresent state of things did not commence at a very remote period.\r\n\r\nThe history of nations confirms the testimony of the fossils and of the\r\nrocks. The chronology of none of the nations of the West can be traced\r\nunbroken farther back than 3,000 years. The Pentateuch, the most ancient\r\ndocument the world possesses, and all subsequent writings allude to a\r\nuniversal deluge, and the Pentateuch and Vedas and Chou-king date this\r\ncatastrophe as not more than 5,400 years before our time. Is it possible\r\nthat mere chance gave a result so striking as to make the traditional\r\norigin of the Assyrian, Indian, and Chinese monarchies agree in being as\r\nremote as 4,000 or 5,000 years back? Would the ideas of nations with so\r\nlittle inter-communication, whose language, religion, and laws have\r\nnothing in common, agree on this point if they were not founded on\r\ntruth? Even the American Indians have their Noah or Deucalion, like the\r\nIndians, Babylonians, and Greeks.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the long existence of ancient nations is attested by\r\ntheir progress in astronomy. But this progress has been much\r\nexaggerated. But what would this astronomy prove even if it were more\r\nperfect? Have we calculated the progress which a science would make in\r\nthe bosom of nations which had no other? If among the multitude of\r\npersons solely occupied with astronomy, even then, all that these people\r\nknew might have been discovered in a few centuries, when only 300 years\r\nintervened between Copernicus and Laplace.\r\n\r\nAgain, it has been pretended that the zodiacal figures on ancient\r\ntemples give proof of a remote antiquity; but the question is very\r\ncomplicated, and there are as many opinions as writers, and certainly no\r\nconclusions against the newness of continents and nations can be based\r\non such evidence. The zodiac itself has been considered a proof of\r\nantiquity, but the arguments brought forward are undoubtedly unsound.\r\n\r\nEven if these various astronomical proofs were as certain as they are\r\nunconvincing, what conclusion could we draw against the great\r\ncatastrophe so indisputably demonstrated? We should only have the right\r\nto conclude that astronomy was among the sciences preserved by those\r\npersons whom the catastrophe spared.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if there be anything determined in geology, it is that\r\nthe surface of our globe has been subjected to a revolution within 5,000\r\nyears, and that this revolution buried the countries formerly inhabited\r\nby man and modern animals, and left the bottom of the former sea dry as\r\na habitation for the few individuals it spared. Consequently, our\r\npresent human societies have arisen since this catastrophe.\r\n\r\nBut the countries now inhabited had been inhabited before, as fossils\r\nshow, by animals, if not by mankind, and had been overwhelmed by a\r\nprevious deluge; and, indeed, judging by the different orders of animal\r\nfossils we find, they had perhaps undergone two or three irruptions of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN\r\n\r\nThe Origin of Species\r\n\r\n     Charles Robert Darwin was born at Shrewsbury, England, Feb. 12,\r\n     1809, of a family distinguished on both sides. Abandoning medicine\r\n     for natural history, he joined H.M.S. Beagle in 1831 on the five\r\n     years' voyage, which he described in \"The Voyage of the Beagle,\"\r\n     and to which he refers in the introduction to his masterpiece. The\r\n     \"Origin of Species\" containing, in the idea of natural selection,\r\n     the distinctive contribution of Darwin to the theory of organic\r\n     evolution, was published in November, 1859. In only one brief\r\n     sentence did he there allude to man, but twelve years later he\r\n     published the \"Descent of Man,\" in which the principles of the\r\n     earlier volume found their logical outcome. In other works Darwin\r\n     added vastly to our knowledge of coral reefs, organic variation,\r\n     earthworms, and the comparative expression of the emotions in man\r\n     and animals. Darwin died in ignorance of the work upon variation\r\n     done by his great contemporary, Gregor Mendel, whose work was\r\n     rediscovered in 1900. \"Mendelism\" necessitates much modification of\r\n     Darwin's work, which, however, remains the maker of the greatest\r\n     epoch in the study of life and the most important contribution to\r\n     that study ever made. Its immortal author died on April 19, 1882,\r\n     and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Creation or Evolution?_\r\n\r\nWhen on board H.M.S. Beagle as naturalist, I was much struck with\r\ncertain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting South\r\nAmerica, and in the geographical relations of the present to the past\r\ninhabitants of that continent. These facts, as will be seen in the\r\nlatter chapters of this volume, seemed to throw some light on the origin\r\nof species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of\r\nour greatest philosophers. On my return home, in 1837, it occurred to me\r\nthat something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently\r\naccumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly\r\nhave any bearing on it. After five years' work, I allowed myself to\r\nspeculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged\r\nin 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions which then seemed to me\r\nprobable. From that period to the present day I have steadily pursued\r\nthe same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these\r\npersonal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in\r\ncoming to a decision.\r\n\r\nIn considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a\r\nnaturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on\r\ntheir embryological relations, their geographical distribution,\r\ngeological succession, and other such facts, might come to the\r\nconclusion that species had not been independently created, but had\r\ndescended, like varieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such a\r\nconclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it\r\ncould be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have\r\nbeen modified so as to acquire that perfection of structure and\r\nco-adaptation which justly excites our admiration.\r\n\r\nNaturalists continually refer to external conditions, such as climate,\r\nfood, etc., as the only possible cause of variation. In one limited\r\nsense, as we shall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is\r\npreposterous to attribute to mere external conditions the structure, for\r\ninstance, of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so\r\nadmirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees. In the case\r\nof the mistletoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which\r\nhas seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has\r\nflowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain\r\ninsects to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally\r\npreposterous to account for the structure of the parasite, with its\r\nrelations to several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external\r\nconditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into\r\nthe means of modification and co-adaptation. At the beginning of my\r\nobservations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of\r\ndomesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best\r\nchance of making out this obscure problem. Nor have I been disappointed;\r\nin this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that\r\nour knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication,\r\nafforded the best and safest clue. I may venture to express my\r\nconviction of the high value of such studies, although they have been\r\nvery commonly neglected by naturalists.\r\n\r\nAlthough much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can\r\nentertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate\r\njudgment of which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists\r\nuntil recently entertained, and which I formerly entertained--namely,\r\nthat each species has been independently created--is erroneous. I am\r\nfully convinced that species are not immutable, but that those belonging\r\nto what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other\r\nand generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged\r\nvarieties of any one species are the descendants of that species.\r\nFurthermore, I am also convinced that Natural Selection has been the\r\nmost important, but not the exclusive, means of modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Variation and Selection_\r\n\r\nAll living beings vary more or less from one another, and though\r\nvariations which are not inherited are unimportant for us, the number\r\nand diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of\r\nslight and those of considerable physiological importance, are endless.\r\n\r\nNo breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance; that like\r\nproduces like is his fundamental belief. Doubts have been thrown on\r\nthis principle only by theoretical writers. When any deviation of\r\nstructure often appears, and we see it in the father and child, we\r\ncannot tell whether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on\r\nboth; but when amongst individuals, apparently exposed to the same\r\nconditions, any very rare deviation, due to some extraordinary\r\ncombination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say, once amongst\r\nseveral million individuals--and it re-appears in the child, the mere\r\ndoctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nEveryone must have heard of cases of albinism, prickly skin, hairy\r\nbodies, etc., appearing in members of the same family. If strange and\r\nrare deviations of structure are really inherited, less strange and\r\ncommoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable. Perhaps\r\nthe correct way of viewing the whole subject would be to look at the\r\ninheritance of every character whatever as the rule, and non-inheritance\r\nas the anomaly.\r\n\r\nThe laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown. No one can\r\nsay why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same\r\nspecies, or in different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes\r\nnot so; why the child often reverts in certain characters to its\r\ngrandfather or grandmother, or more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity\r\nis often transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone,\r\nmore commonly but not exclusively to the like sex.\r\n\r\nThe fact of heredity being given, we have evidence derived from human\r\npractice as to the influence of selection. There are large numbers of\r\ndomesticated races of animals and plants admirably suited in various\r\nways to man's use or fancy--adapted to the environment of which his need\r\nand inclination are the most essential constituents. We cannot suppose\r\nthat all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as\r\nwe now see them; indeed, in many cases, we know that this has not been\r\ntheir history. The key is man's power of accumulative selection. Nature\r\ngives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions\r\nuseful to him. In this sense he may be said to have made for himself\r\nuseful breeds.\r\n\r\nThe great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. It\r\nis certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a\r\nsingle lifetime, modified to a large extent their breeds of cattle and\r\nsheep. What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the\r\nenormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have\r\nbeen exported to almost every quarter of the world. The same principles\r\nare followed by horticulturists, and we see an astonishing improvement\r\nin many florists' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are\r\ncompared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe practice of selection is far from being a modern discovery. The\r\nprinciple of selection I find distinctly given in an ancient Chinese\r\nencyclopædia. Explicit rules are laid down by some of the Roman\r\nclassical writers. It is clear that the breeding of domestic animals was\r\ncarefully attended to in ancient times, and is now attended to by the\r\nlowest savages. It would, indeed, have been a strange fact had attention\r\nnot been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of good and bad qualities\r\nis so obvious.\r\n\r\nStudy of the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants leads to\r\nthe following conclusions. Changed conditions of life are of the highest\r\npossible importance in causing variability, both by acting directly on\r\nthe organisation, and indirectly by affecting the reproductive system.\r\nSpontaneous variation of unknown origin plays its part. Some, perhaps a\r\ngreat, effect may be attributed to the increased use or disuse of parts.\r\n\r\nThe final result is thus rendered infinitely complex. In some cases the\r\nintercrossing of aboriginally distinct species appears to have played\r\nan important part in the origin of our breeds. When several breeds have\r\nonce been formed in any country, their occasional intercrossing, with\r\nthe aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation of\r\nnew sub-breeds; but the importance of crossing has been much\r\nexaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are\r\npropagated by seed. Over all these causes of change, the accumulative\r\naction of selection, whether applied methodically and quickly, or\r\nunconsciously and slowly, but more efficiently, seems to have been the\r\npredominant power.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Variation Under Nature_\r\n\r\nBefore applying these principles to organic beings in a state of nature,\r\nwe must ascertain whether these latter are subject to any variation. We\r\nfind variation everywhere. Individual differences, though of small\r\ninterest to the systematist, are of the highest importance for us, for\r\nthey are often inherited; and they thus afford materials for natural\r\nselection to act and accumulate, in the same manner as man accumulates\r\nin any given direction individual differences in his domesticated\r\nproductions. Further, what we call varieties cannot really be\r\ndistinguished from species in the long run, a fact which we can clearly\r\nunderstand if species once existed as varieties, and thus originated.\r\nBut the facts are utterly inexplicable if species are independent\r\ncreations.\r\n\r\nHow have all the exquisite adaptations of one part of the body to\r\nanother part, and to the conditions of life, and of one organic being to\r\nanother being, been perfected? For everywhere we find these beautiful\r\nadaptations.\r\n\r\nThe answer is to be found in the struggle for life. Owing to this\r\nstruggle, variations, however slight, and from whatever cause\r\nproceeding, if they be in any degree profitable to the individuals of a\r\nspecies in their infinitely complex relations to other organic beings\r\nand to their physical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation\r\nof such individuals, and will generally be inherited by the offspring.\r\nThe offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for,\r\nof the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but\r\na small number can survive. I have called this principle, by which each\r\nslight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural\r\nSelection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.\r\nBut the expression, often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival\r\nof the Fittest, is more accurate.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that man, by selection, can certainly produce great\r\nresults, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the\r\naccumulation of slight but useful variations given to him by the hand of\r\nNature. Natural Selection is a power incessantly ready for action, and\r\nis as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts as the works of\r\nNature are to those of Art.\r\n\r\nAll organic beings are exposed to severe competition. Nothing is easier\r\nthan to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or\r\nmore difficult--at least, I have found it so--than constantly to bear\r\nthis conclusion in mind. Yet, unless it be thoroughly engrained in the\r\nmind, the whole economy of Nature, with every fact of distribution,\r\nrarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or\r\nquite misunderstood. We behold the face of Nature bright with gladness;\r\nwe often see superabundance of food. We do not see, or we forget, that\r\nthe birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or\r\nseeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely\r\nthese songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by\r\nbirds or beasts of prey. We do not always bear in mind that, though food\r\nmay be superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nA struggle for existence, the term being used in a large, general, and\r\nmetaphorical sense, inevitably follows from the high rate at which all\r\norganic beings tend to increase.\r\n\r\nEvery being, which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or\r\nseeds, must suffer destruction during some period of its life, and\r\nduring some season or occasional year; otherwise, on the principle of\r\ngeometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately\r\ngreat that no country could support the product. Hence, as more\r\nindividuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in every\r\ncase be a struggle for existence, either one individual with another of\r\nthe same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with\r\nthe physical conditions of life. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied\r\nwith manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in\r\nthis case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential\r\nrestraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing,\r\nmore or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would\r\nnot hold them.\r\n\r\nThere is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally\r\nincreases at so high a rate that, if not destroyed, the earth would soon\r\nbe covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding man has\r\ndoubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in less than a thousand\r\nyears, there would literally not be standing-room for his progeny.\r\nLinnæus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only two\r\nseeds--and there is no plant so unproductive as this--and their\r\nseedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there\r\nwould be a million plants. The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder\r\nof all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its\r\nprobable minimum rate of natural increase. It will be safest to assume\r\nthat it begins breeding when thirty years old, and goes on breeding\r\nuntil ninety years old, bringing forth six young in the interval, and\r\nsurviving till one hundred years old. If this be so, after a period of\r\nfrom 740 to 750 years there would be nearly nineteen million elephants\r\nalive, descended from the first pair.\r\n\r\nThe causes which check the natural tendency of each species to increase\r\nare most obscure. Eggs or very young animals seem generally to suffer\r\nmost, but this is not invariably the case. With plants there is a vast\r\ndestruction of seeds. The amount of food for each species of course\r\ngives the extreme limit to which each can increase; but very frequently\r\nit is not the obtaining food, but the serving as prey to other animals,\r\nwhich determines the average number of a species. Climate is important,\r\nand periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought seem to be the most\r\neffective of all checks.\r\n\r\nThe relations of all animals and plants to each other in the struggle\r\nfor existence are most complex, and often unexpected. Battle within\r\nbattle must be continually recurring with varying success; and yet in\r\nthe long run the forces are so nicely balanced that the face of Nature\r\nremains for long periods of time uniform, though assuredly the merest\r\ntrifle would give the victory to one organic being over another.\r\nNevertheless, so profound is our ignorance, and so high our presumption,\r\nthat we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and\r\nas we do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world,\r\nor invent laws on the duration of the forms of life!\r\n\r\nThe struggle for life is most severe between individuals and varieties\r\nof the same species. The competition is most severe between allied forms\r\nwhich fill nearly the same place in the economy of Nature. But great is\r\nour ignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings. All that we\r\ncan do is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving\r\nto increase in a geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its\r\nlife, during some season of the year, during each generation or at\r\nintervals, has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction.\r\nWhen we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full\r\nbelief that the war of Nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt,\r\nthat death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and\r\nthe happy survive and multiply.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--The Survival of the Fittest_\r\n\r\nHow will the struggle for existence act in regard to variation? Can the\r\nprinciple of selection, which we have seen is so potent in the hands of\r\nman, apply under Nature? I think we shall see that it can act most\r\nefficiently. Let the endless number of slight variations and individual\r\ndifferences occurring in our domestic productions, and, in a lesser\r\ndegree, in those under Nature, be borne in mind, as well as the strength\r\nof the hereditary tendency. Under domestication, it may be truly said\r\nthat the whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic.\r\n\r\nBut the variability, which we almost universally meet with in our\r\ndomestic productions, is not directly produced by man; he can neither\r\noriginate variations nor prevent their occurrence; he can only preserve\r\nand accumulate such as do occur. Unintentionally he exposes organic\r\nbeings to new and changing conditions of life, and variability ensues;\r\nbut similar changes of condition might and do occur under Nature.\r\n\r\nLet it also be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting\r\nare the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to\r\ntheir physical conditions of life, and consequently what infinitely\r\nvaried diversities of structure might be of use to each being under\r\nchanging conditions of life. Can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing\r\nwhat variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other\r\nvariations, useful in some way to each being in the great complex battle\r\nof life, should occur in the course of many successive generations? If\r\nsuch do occur, can we doubt, remembering that many more individuals are\r\nborn than can possibly survive, that individuals having any advantage\r\nover others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating\r\ntheir kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in\r\nthe least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation\r\nof favourable individual differences and variations, and the destruction\r\nof those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the\r\nSurvival of the Fittest.\r\n\r\nThe term is too frequently misapprehended. Variations neither useful nor\r\ninjurious would not be affected by natural selection. It is not asserted\r\nthat natural selection induces variability. It implies only the\r\npreservation of such varieties as arise and are beneficial to the being\r\nunder its conditions of life. Again, it has been said that I speak of\r\nnatural selection as an active Power or Deity; but who objects to an\r\nauthor speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of\r\nthe planets? It is difficult to avoid personifying the word Nature; but\r\nI mean by Nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural\r\nlaws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us.\r\n\r\nAs man can produce, and certainly has produced, a great result by his\r\nmethodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not natural\r\nselection effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters;\r\nNature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural preservation or\r\nsurvival of the fittest, cares nothing for appearances, except in so far\r\nas they are useful to any being. She can act on every internal organ, on\r\nevery shade of constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of\r\nlife. Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the\r\nbeing which she tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by\r\nher, as is implied by the fact of their selection. Man keeps the natives\r\nof many climates in the same country; he seldom exercises each selected\r\ncharacter in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a\r\nshort-beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed\r\nor long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with\r\nlong and short wool to the same climate.\r\n\r\nMan does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females.\r\nHe does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but protects during\r\neach varying season, as far as lies in his power, all his productions.\r\nHe often begins his selection by some half-monstrous form; or at least\r\nby some modification prominent enough to catch the eye or to be plainly\r\nuseful to him.\r\n\r\nBut under Nature, the slightest differences of structure or constitution\r\nmay well turn the nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so\r\nbe preserved. How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! How short\r\nhis time! And, consequently, how poor will be his results compared with\r\nthose accumulated by Nature during whole geological periods! Can we\r\nwonder that Nature's productions should be far \"truer\" in character than\r\nman's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the\r\nmost complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of\r\nfar higher workmanship?\r\n\r\nIt may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly\r\nscrutinising, throughout the world, the slightest variations; rejecting\r\nthose that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are good; silently\r\nand insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the\r\nimprovement of each organic being in relation to its organic and\r\ninorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in\r\nprogress until the hand of time has marked the lapse of ages, and then\r\nso imperfect is our view into long-past geological ages that we see only\r\nthat the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were.\r\n\r\nAlthough natural selection can act only through and for the good of\r\neach being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider\r\nas of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on.\r\n\r\nNatural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to\r\nthe parent, and of the parent in relation to the young. In social\r\nanimals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit\r\nof the whole community, if the community profits by the selected change.\r\nWhat natural selection cannot do is to modify the structure of one\r\nspecies, without giving it any advantage, for the good of another\r\nspecies; and though statements to this effect may be found in works of\r\nnatural history, I cannot find one case which will bear investigation.\r\n\r\nA structure used only once in an animal's life, if of high importance to\r\nit, might be modified to any extent by natural selection; for instance,\r\nthe great jaws possessed by certain insects, used exclusively for\r\nopening the cocoon, or the hard tip to the beak of unhatched birds, used\r\nfor breaking the egg. It has been asserted that of the best short-beaked\r\ntumbler pigeons a greater number perish in the egg than are able to get\r\nout of it; so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching. Now, if\r\nNature had to make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short for the\r\nbird's own advantage, the process of modification would be very slow,\r\nand there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of all the\r\nyoung birds within the egg, for all with weak beaks would inevitably\r\nperish; or more easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness of\r\nthe shell being known to vary like every other structure.\r\n\r\nWith all beings there must be much fortuitous destruction, which can\r\nhave little or no influence on the course of natural selection. For\r\ninstance, a vast number of eggs or seeds are annually devoured, and\r\nthese could be modified through natural selection only if they varied\r\nin some manner which protected them from their enemies. Yet many of\r\nthese eggs or seeds would perhaps, if not destroyed, have yielded\r\nindividuals better adapted to their conditions of life than any of those\r\nwhich happened to survive. So, again, a vast number of mature animals\r\nand plants, whether or not they be the best adapted to their conditions,\r\nmust be annually destroyed by accidental causes, which would not be in\r\nthe least degree mitigated by certain changes of structure or\r\nconstitution which would in other ways be beneficial to the species.\r\n\r\nBut let the destruction of the adults be ever so heavy, if the number\r\nwhich can exist in any district be not wholly kept down by such\r\ncauses--or, again, let the destruction of eggs or seeds be so great that\r\nonly a hundredth or a thousandth part are developed--yet of those which\r\ndo survive, the best adapted individuals, supposing there is any\r\nvariability in a favourable direction, will tend to propagate their kind\r\nin larger numbers than the less well adapted.\r\n\r\nOn our theory the continued existence of lowly organisms offers no\r\ndifficulty; for natural selection does not necessarily include\r\nprogressive development; it only takes advantage of such variations as\r\narise and are beneficial to each creature under its complex relations of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe mere lapse of time by itself does nothing, either for or against\r\nnatural selection. I state this because it has been erroneously asserted\r\nthat the element of time has been assumed by me to play an all-important\r\npart in modifying species, as if all the forms of life were necessarily\r\nundergoing change through some innate law.\r\n\r\n\r\n_V.--Sexual Selection_\r\n\r\nThis form of selection depends, not on a struggle for existence in\r\nrelation to other organic beings or to external conditions, but on a\r\nstruggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for\r\nthe possession of the other sex. The result is not death to the\r\nunsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. Sexual selection is,\r\ntherefore, less rigorous than natural selection. Generally, the most\r\nvigorous males, those which are best fitted for their places in Nature,\r\nwill leave most progeny. But, in many cases, victory depends not so much\r\non general vigour as on having special weapons, confined to the male\r\nsex. A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of\r\nleaving numerous offspring. Sexual selection, by always allowing the\r\nvictor to breed, might surely give indomitable courage, length to the\r\nspur, and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, in nearly\r\nthe same manner as does the brutal cock-fighter by the careful selection\r\nof his best cocks.\r\n\r\nHow low in the scale of Nature the law of battle descends I know not.\r\nMale alligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling\r\nround, like Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females;\r\nmale salmons have been observed fighting all day long; male stag-beetles\r\nsometimes bear wounds from the mandibles of other males; the males of\r\ncertain other insects have been frequently seen fighting for a\r\nparticular female who sits by, an apparently unconcerned beholder of the\r\nstruggle, and then retires with the conqueror. The war is, perhaps,\r\nseverest between the males of the polygamous animals, and these seem\r\noftenest provided with special weapons. The males of carnivorous animals\r\nare already well armed, though to them special means of defence may be\r\ngiven through means of sexual selection, as the mane of the lion and the\r\nhooked jaw of the salmon. The shield may be as important for victory as\r\nthe sword or spear.\r\n\r\nAmongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character. All\r\nthose who have attended to the subject believe that there is the\r\nseverest rivalry between the males of many species to attract, by\r\nsinging, the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of paradise, and\r\nsome others, congregate; and successive males display with the most\r\nelaborate care, and show off in the best manner, their gorgeous plumage;\r\nthey likewise perform strange antics before the females, which, standing\r\nby as spectators, at last choose the most attractive partner.\r\n\r\nIf man can in a short time give beauty and an elegant carriage to his\r\nbantams, according to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason\r\nto doubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of\r\ngenerations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their\r\nstandard of beauty, might produce a marked effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_VI.--The Struggle for Existence_\r\n\r\nUnder domestication we see much variability, caused, or at least\r\nexcited, by changed conditions of life; but often in so obscure a manner\r\nthat we are tempted to consider the variations as spontaneous.\r\nVariability is governed by many complex laws--by correlated growth,\r\ncompensation, the increased use and disuse of parts, and the definite\r\naction of the surrounding conditions. There is much difficulty in\r\nascertaining how largely our domestic productions have been modified;\r\nbut we may safely infer that the amount has been large, and that\r\nmodifications can be inherited for long periods. As long as the\r\nconditions of life remain the same, we have reason to believe that a\r\nmodification, which has already been inherited for many generations, may\r\ncontinue to be inherited for an almost infinite number of generations.\r\nOn the other hand, we have evidence that variability, when it has once\r\ncome into play, does not cease under domestication for a very long\r\nperiod; nor do we know that it ever ceases, for new varieties are still\r\noccasionally produced by our oldest domesticated productions.\r\n\r\nVariability is not actually caused by man; he only unintentionally\r\nexposes organic beings to new conditions of life, and then Nature acts\r\non the organisation and causes it to vary. But man can and does select\r\nthe variations given to him by Nature, and thus accumulates them in any\r\ndesired manner. He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or\r\npleasure. He may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously by\r\npreserving the individuals most useful or pleasing to him without an\r\nintention of altering the breed.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that he can influence the character of a breed by\r\nselecting, in each successive generation, individual differences so\r\nslight as to be inappreciable except by an educated eye. This\r\nunconscious process of selection has been the agency in the formation of\r\nthe most distinct and useful domestic breeds. That many breeds produced\r\nby man have to a large extent the character of natural species is shown\r\nby the inextricable doubts whether many of them are varieties or\r\naboriginally distinct species.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently\r\nunder domestication should not have acted under Nature. In the survival\r\nof favoured individuals and races, during the constantly recurrent\r\nstruggle for existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of\r\nselection. The struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high\r\ngeometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings.\r\nThis high rate of increase is proved by calculation; by the rapid\r\nincrease of many animals and plants during a succession of peculiar\r\nseasons and when naturalised in new countries. More individuals are born\r\nthan can possibly survive. A grain in the balance may determine which\r\nindividuals shall live and which shall die; which variety or species\r\nshall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally become\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nAs the individuals of the same species come in all respects into the\r\nclosest competition with each other, the struggle will generally be\r\nmost severe between them; it will be almost equally severe between the\r\nvarieties of the same species, and next in severity between the species\r\nof the same genus. On the other hand, the struggle will often be severe\r\nbetween beings remote in the scale of Nature. The slightest advantage in\r\ncertain individuals, at any age or during any season, over those with\r\nwhich they come into competition, or better adaptation, in however\r\nslight a degree, to the surrounding physical conditions, will, in the\r\nlong run, turn the balance.\r\n\r\nWith animals having separated sexes, there will be in most cases a\r\nstruggle between the males for the possession of the females. The most\r\nvigorous males, or those which have most successfully struggled with\r\ntheir conditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. But success\r\nwill often depend on the males having special weapons, or means of\r\ndefence, or charms; and a slight advantage will lead to victory.\r\n\r\nAs geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical\r\nchanges, we might have expected to find that organic beings have varied\r\nunder Nature in the same way as they have varied under domestication.\r\nAnd if there has been any variability under Nature, it would be an\r\nunaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into play. It has\r\noften been asserted, but the assertion is incapable of proof, that the\r\namount of variation under Nature is a strictly limited quantity. Man,\r\nthough acting on external characters alone, and often capriciously, can\r\nproduce within a short period a great result by adding up mere\r\nindividual differences in his domestic productions; and everyone admits\r\nthat species present individual differences. But, besides such\r\ndifferences, all naturalists admit that natural varieties exist, which\r\nare considered sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record in\r\nsystematic works.\r\n\r\nNo one has drawn any clear distinction between individual differences\r\nand slight varieties, or between more plainly marked varieties and\r\nsub-species and species. On separate continents, and on different parts\r\nof the same continent when divided by barriers of any kind, what a\r\nmultitude of forms exist which some experienced naturalists rank as\r\nvarieties, others as geographical races or sub-species, and others as\r\ndistinct, though closely allied species!\r\n\r\nIf, then, animals and plants do vary, let it be ever so slightly or\r\nslowly, why should not variations or individuals, differences which are\r\nin any way beneficial, be preserved and accumulated through natural\r\nselection, or the survival of the fittest? If man can, by patience,\r\nselect variations useful to him, why, under changing and complex\r\nconditions of life, should not variations useful to Nature's living\r\nproducts often arise, and be preserved, or selected? What limit can be\r\nput to this power, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the\r\nwhole constitution, structure, and habits of each creature--favouring\r\nthe good and rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to this power, in\r\nslowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nIn the future I see open fields for far more important researches.\r\nPsychology will be based on the foundation already well laid by Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer--that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power\r\nand capacity by gradation. Much light will be thrown on the origin of\r\nman and his history.\r\n\r\nAuthors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view\r\nthat each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords\r\nbetter with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator\r\nthat the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants\r\nof the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those\r\ndetermining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all\r\nbeings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some\r\nfew beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system\r\nwas deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the\r\npast, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its\r\nunaltered likeness to a distant futurity.\r\n\r\nOf the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to\r\na far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are\r\ngrouped shows that the greater number of species in each genus, and all\r\nthe species in many genera, have left no descendants, but have become\r\nutterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as\r\nto foretell that it will be the common and widely-spread species,\r\nbelonging to the larger and dominant groups within each class, which\r\nwill ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all\r\nthe living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived\r\nlong before the Cambrian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary\r\nsuccession by generation has never once been broken, and that no\r\ncataclysm has desolated the whole world. We may look with some\r\nconfidence to a secure future of great length. As natural selection\r\nworks solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental\r\nendowments will tend to progress towards perfection.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many\r\nplants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various\r\ninsects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth,\r\nand to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different\r\nfrom each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner,\r\nhave all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in\r\nthe largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance, which is\r\nalmost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct\r\naction of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a ratio of\r\nincrease so high as to lead to a struggle for life, and, as a\r\nconsequence, to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character\r\nand the Extinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of Nature,\r\nfrom famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of\r\nconceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly\r\nfollows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several\r\npowers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms,\r\nor into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according\r\nto the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms\r\nmost beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR HUMPHRY DAVY\r\n\r\nElements of Chemical Philosophy\r\n\r\n     Humphry Davy, the celebrated natural philosopher, was born Dec. 17,\r\n     1778, at Penzance, England. At the age of seventeen he became an\r\n     apothecary's apprentice, and at the age of nineteen assistant at\r\n     Dr. Beddoes's pneumatic institution at Bristol. During researches\r\n     at the pneumatic institution he discovered the physiological\r\n     effects of \"laughing gas,\" and made so considerable a reputation as\r\n     a chemist that at the age of twenty-two he was appointed lecturer,\r\n     and a year later professor, at the Royal Institution. For ten\r\n     years, from 1803, he was engaged in agricultural researches, and in\r\n     1813 published his \"Elements of Agricultural Chemistry.\" During the\r\n     same decade he conducted important investigations into the nature\r\n     of chemical combination, and succeeded in isolating the elements\r\n     potassium, sodium, strontium, magnesium, and chlorine. In 1812 he\r\n     was knighted, and married Mrs. Apreece, _née_ Jane Kerr. In 1815 he\r\n     investigated the nature of fire-damp and invented the Davy safety\r\n     lamp. In 1818 he received a baronetcy, and two years later was\r\n     elected President of the Royal Society. On May 29, 1829, he died at\r\n     Geneva. Davy's \"Elements of Chemical Philosophy,\" of which a\r\n     summary is given here, was published in one volume in 1812, being\r\n     the substance of lectures delivered before the Board of\r\n     Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Forms and Changes of Matter_\r\n\r\nThe forms and appearances of the beings and substances of the external\r\nworld are almost infinitely various, and they are in a state of\r\ncontinued alteration. In general, matter is found in four forms, as (1)\r\nsolids, (2) fluids, (3) gases, (4) ethereal substances.\r\n\r\n1. _Solids._ Solids retain whatever mechanical form is given to them;\r\ntheir parts are separated with difficulty, and cannot readily be made to\r\nunite after separation. They may be either elastic or non-elastic, and\r\ndiffer in hardness, in colour, in opacity, in density, in weight, and,\r\nif crystalline, in crystalline form.\r\n\r\n2. _Fluids._ Fluids, when in small masses, assume the spherical form;\r\ntheir parts possess freedom of motion; they differ in density and\r\ntenacity, in colour, and in opacity. They are usually regarded as\r\nincompressible; at least, a very great mechanical force is required to\r\ncompress them.\r\n\r\n3. _Gases._ Gases exist free in the atmosphere, but may be confined.\r\nTheir parts are highly movable; they are compressible and expansible,\r\nand their volumes are inversely as the weight compressing them. All\r\nknown gases are transparent, and present only two or three varieties of\r\ncolour; they differ materially in density.\r\n\r\n4. _Ethereal Substances._ Ethereal substances are known to us only in\r\ntheir states of motion when acting upon our organs of sense, or upon\r\nother matter, and are not susceptible of being confined. It cannot be\r\ndoubted that there is such matter in motion in space. Ethereal matter\r\ndiffers either in its nature, or in its affections by motion, for it\r\nproduces different effects; for instance, radiant heat, and different\r\nkinds of light.\r\n\r\nAll these forms of matter are under the influence of active forces, such\r\nas gravitation, cohesion, heat, chemical and electrical attraction, and\r\nthese we must now consider.\r\n\r\n1. _Gravitation._ When a stone is thrown into the atmosphere, it rapidly\r\ndescends towards the earth. This is owing to gravitation. All the great\r\nbodies in the universe are urged towards each other by a similar force.\r\nBodies mutually gravitate towards each other, but the smaller body\r\nproportionately more than the larger one; hence the power of gravity is\r\nsaid to vary directly as the mass. Gravitation also varies with\r\ndistance, and acts inversely as the square of the distance.\r\n\r\n2. _Cohesion._ Cohesion is the force which preserves the forms of\r\nsolids, and gives globularity to fluids. It is usually said to act only\r\nat the surface of bodies or by their immediate contact; but this does\r\nnot seem to be the case. It certainly acts with much greater energy at\r\nsmall distances, but the spherical form of minute portions of fluid\r\nmatter can be produced only by the attractions of all the parts of which\r\nthey are composed, for each other; and most of these attractions must be\r\nexerted at sensible distances, so that gravitation and cohesion may be\r\nmere modifications of the same general power of attraction.\r\n\r\n3. _Heat._ When a body which occasions the sensation of heat on our\r\norgans is brought into contact with another body which has no such\r\neffect, the hot body contracts and loses to a certain extent its power\r\nof communicating heat; and the other body expands. Different solids and\r\nfluids expand very differently when heated, and the expansive power of\r\nliquids, in general, is greater than that of solids.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the density of bodies must be diminished by\r\nexpansion; and in the case of fluids and gases, the parts of which are\r\nmobile, many important phenomena depend upon this circumstance. For\r\ninstance, if heat be applied to fluids and gases, the heated parts\r\nchange their places and rise, and the currents in the ocean and\r\natmosphere are due principally to this movement. There are very few\r\nexceptions to the law of the expansion of bodies at the time they become\r\ncapable of communicating the sensation of heat, and these exceptions\r\nseem to depend upon some chemical change in the constitution of bodies,\r\nor on their crystalline arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe power which bodies possess of communicating or receiving heat is\r\nknown as _temperature_, and the temparature of a body is said to be high\r\nor low with respect to another in proportion as it occasions an\r\nexpansion or contraction of its parts.\r\n\r\nWhen equal volumes of different bodies of different temperatures are\r\nsuffered to remain in contact till they acquire the same temperature, it\r\nis found that this temperature is not a mean one, as it would be in the\r\ncase of equal volumes of the same body. Thus if a pint of quicksilver\r\nat 100° be mixed with a pint of water at 50°, the resulting temperature\r\nis not 75°, but 70°; the mercury has lost thirty degrees, whereas the\r\nwater has only gained twenty degrees. This difference is said to depend\r\non the different _capacities_ of bodies for heat.\r\n\r\nNot only do different bodies vary in their capacity for heat, but they\r\nlikewise acquire heat with very different degrees of celerity. This last\r\ndifference depends on the different power of bodies for _conducting_\r\nheat, and it will be found that as a rule the densest bodies, with the\r\nleast capacity for heat, are the best conductors.\r\n\r\nHeat, or the power of repulsion, may be considered as the _antagonist_\r\npower to the attraction of cohesion. Thus solids by a certain increase\r\nof temperature become fluids, and fluids gases; and, _vice versâ_, by a\r\ndiminution of temperature, gases become fluids, and fluids solids.\r\n\r\nProofs of the conversion of solids, fluids, or gases into ethereal\r\nsubstances are not distinct. Heated bodies become luminous and give off\r\nradiant heat, which affects the bodies at a distance, and it may\r\ntherefore be held that particles are thrown off from heated bodies with\r\ngreat velocity, which, by acting on our organs, produce the sensations\r\nof heat or light, and that their motion, communicated to the particles\r\nof other bodies, has the power of expanding them. It may, however, be\r\nsaid that the radiant matters emitted by bodies in ignition are specific\r\nsubstances, and that common matter is not susceptible of assuming this\r\nform; or it may be contended that the phenomena of radiation do in fact,\r\ndepend upon motions communicated to subtile matter everywhere existing\r\nin space.\r\n\r\nThe temperatures at which bodies change their states from fluids to\r\nsolids, though in general definite, are influenced by a few\r\ncircumstances such as motion and pressure.\r\n\r\nWhen solids are converted into fluids, or fluids into gases, there is\r\nalways a loss of heat of temperature; and, _vice versâ_, when gases are\r\nconverted into fluids, or fluids into solids, there is an increase of\r\nheat of temperature, and in this case it is said that _latent_ heat is\r\nabsorbed or given out.\r\n\r\nThe expansion due to heat has been accounted for by supposing a subtile\r\nfluid, or _caloric_, capable of combining with bodies and of separating\r\ntheir parts from each other, and the absorption and liberation of latent\r\nheat can be explained on this principle. But many other facts are\r\nincompatible with the theory. For instance, metal may be kept hot for\r\nany length of time by friction, so that if _caloric_ be pressed out it\r\nmust exist in an inexhaustible quantity. Delicate experiments have shown\r\nthat bodies, when heated, do not increase in weight.\r\n\r\nIt seems possible to account for all the phenomena of heat, if it be\r\nsupposed that in solids the particles are in a constant state of\r\nvibratory motion, the particles of the hottest bodies moving with the\r\ngreatest velocity and through the greatest space; that in fluids and\r\ngases the particles have not only vibratory motion, but also a motion\r\nround their own axes with different velocities, and that in ethereal\r\nsubstances the particles move round their own axes and separate from\r\neach other, penetrating in right lines through space. Temperature may be\r\nconceived to depend upon the velocity of the vibrations, increase of\r\ncapacity on the motion being performed in greater space; and the\r\ndiminution of temperature during the conversion of solids into fluids or\r\ngases may be explained on the idea of the loss of vibratory motion in\r\nconsequence of the revolution of particles round their axes at the\r\nmoment when the body becomes fluid or aeriform, or from the loss of\r\nrapidity of vibration in consequence of the motion of particles through\r\ngreater space.\r\n\r\n4. _Chemical Attraction._ Oil and water will not _combine_; they are\r\nsaid to have no chemical _attraction_ or _affinity_ for each other. But\r\nif oil and solution of potassa in water be mixed, the oil and the\r\nsolution blend and form a soap; and they are said to attract each other\r\nchemically or to have a _chemical affinity_ for each other. It is a\r\ngeneral character of chemical combination that it changes the qualities\r\nof the bodies. Thus, corrosive and pungent substances may become mild\r\nand tasteless; solids may become fluids, and solids and fluids gases.\r\n\r\nNo body will act chemically upon another body at any sensible distance;\r\napparent contact is necessary for chemical action. A freedom of motion\r\nin the parts of the bodies or a want of cohesion greatly assists action,\r\nand it was formerly believed that bodies cannot act chemically upon each\r\nother unless one of them be fluid or gaseous.\r\n\r\nDifferent bodies unite with different degrees of force, and hence one\r\nbody is capable of separating others from certain of their combinations,\r\nand in consequence mutual decompositions of different compounds take\r\nplace. This has been called _double affinity_, or _complex chemical\r\naffinity_.\r\n\r\nAs in all well-known compounds the proportions of the elements are in\r\ncertain definite ratios to each other, it is evident that these ratios\r\nmay be expressed by numbers; and if one number be employed to denote the\r\nsmallest quantity in which a body combines, all other quantities of the\r\nsame body will be multiples of this number, and the smallest proportions\r\ninto which the undecomposed bodies enter into union being known, the\r\nconstitution of the compounds they form may be learnt, and the element\r\nwhich unites chemically in the smallest quantity being expressed by\r\nunity, all the other elements may be represented by the relations of\r\ntheir quantities to unity.\r\n\r\n5. _Electrical Attraction._ A piece of dry silk briskly rubbed against a\r\nwarm plate of polished flint glass acquires the property of adhering to\r\nthe glass, and both the silk and the glass, if apart from each other,\r\nattract light substances. The bodies are said to be _electrically\r\nexcited_. Probably, all bodies which differ from each other become\r\nelectrically excited when rubbed and pressed together. The electrical\r\nexcitement seems of two kinds. A pith-ball touched by glass excited by\r\nsilk repels a pith-ball touched by silk excited by metals. Electrical\r\nexcitement of the same nature as that in glass excited by silk is known\r\nas _vitreous_ or _positive_, and electrical excitement of the opposite\r\nnature is known as _resinous_ or _negative_.\r\n\r\nA rod of glass touched by an electrified body is electrified only round\r\nthe point of contact. A rod of metal, on the contrary, suspended on a\r\nrod of glass and brought into contact with an electrical surface,\r\ninstantly becomes electrical throughout. The glass is said to be a\r\n_non-conductor_, or _insulating substance_; the metal a _conductor_.\r\n\r\nWhen a non-conductor or imperfect conductor, provided it be a thin plate\r\nof matter placed upon a conductor, is brought in contact with an excited\r\nelectrical body, the surface opposite to that of contact gains the\r\nopposite electricity from that of the excited body, and if the plate be\r\nremoved it is found to possess two surfaces in opposite states. If a\r\nconductor be brought into the neighbourhood of an excited body--the air,\r\nwhich is a non-conductor, being between them--that extremity of the\r\nconductor which is opposite to the excited body gains the opposite\r\nelectricity; and the other extremity, if opposite to a body connected\r\nwith the ground, gains the same electricity, and the middle point is not\r\nelectrical at all. This is known as _induced_ electricity.\r\n\r\nThe common exhibition of electrical effects is in attractions and\r\nrepulsions; but electricity also produces chemical phenomena. If a piece\r\nof zinc and copper in contact with each other at one point be placed in\r\ncontact at other points with the same portion of water, the zinc will\r\ncorrode, and attract oxygen from the water much more rapidly than if it\r\nhad not been in contact with the copper; and if sulphuric acid be added,\r\nglobules of inflammable air are given off from the copper, though it is\r\nnot dissolved or acted upon.\r\n\r\nChemical phenomena in connection with electrical effects can be shown\r\neven better by combinations in which the electrical effects are\r\nincreased by alterations of different metals and fluids--the so-called\r\n_voltaic batteries_. Such are the decomposing powers of such batteries\r\nthat not even insoluble compounds are capable of resisting their energy,\r\nfor even glass, sulphate of baryta, fluorspar, etc., are slowly acted\r\nupon, and the alkaline, earthy, or acid matter carried to the poles in\r\nthe common order.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful voltaic combinations are formed by substances that act\r\nchemically with most energy upon each other, and such substances as\r\nundergo no chemical changes in the combination exhibit no electrical\r\npowers. Hence it was supposed that the electrical powers of metals were\r\nentirely due to chemical changes; but this is not the case, for contact\r\nproduces electricity even when no chemical change can be observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Radiant or Ethereal Matter_\r\n\r\nWhen similar thermometers are placed in different parts of the solar\r\nbeam, it is found that different effects are produced in the differently\r\ncoloured rays. The greatest heat is exhibited in the red rays, the least\r\nin the violet rays; and in a space beyond the red rays, where there is\r\nno visible light, the increase of temperature is greatest of all.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it is evident that matter set in motion by the sun has\r\nthe power of producing heat without light, and that its rays are less\r\nrefrangible than the visible rays. The invisible rays that produce heat\r\nare capable of reflection as well as refraction in the same manner as\r\nthe visible rays.\r\n\r\nRays capable of producing heat with and without light proceed not only\r\nfrom the sun, but also from bodies at the surface of the globe under\r\npeculiar agencies or changes. If, for instance, a thermometer be held\r\nnear an ignited body, it receives an impression connected with an\r\nelevation of temperature; this is partly produced by the conducting\r\npowers of the air, and partly by an impulse which is instantaneously\r\ncommunicated, even to a considerable distance. This effect is called the\r\nradiation of terrestrial heat.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the temperatures of bodies are affected by rays\r\nproducing heat is different for different substances, and is very much\r\nconnected with their colours. The bodies that absorb most light, and\r\nreflect least, are most heated when exposed either to solar or\r\nterrestrial rays. Black bodies are, in general, more heated than red;\r\nred more than green; green more than yellow; and yellow more than white.\r\nMetals are less heated than earthy or stony bodies, or than animal or\r\nvegetable matters. Polished surfaces are less heated than rough\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\nThe bodies that have their temperatures most easily raised by heat rays\r\nare likewise those that are most easily cooled by their own radiation,\r\nor that at the same temperature emit most heat-making rays. Metals\r\nradiate less heat than glass, glass less than vegetable substances, and\r\ncharcoal has the highest radiating powers of any body as yet made the\r\nsubject of experiment.\r\n\r\nRadiant matter has the power of producing chemical changes partly\r\nthrough its heating power, and partly through some other specific and\r\npeculiar influence. Thus chlorine and hydrogen detonate when a mixture\r\nof them is exposed to the solar beams, even though the heat is\r\ninadequate to produce detonation.\r\n\r\nIf moistened silver be exposed to the different rays of the solar\r\nspectrum, it will be found that no effect is produced upon it by the\r\nleast refrangible rays which occasion heat without light; that a slight\r\ndiscoloration only will be produced by the red rays; that the effect of\r\nblackening will be greater towards the violet end of the spectrum; and\r\nthat in a space beyond the violet, where there is no sensible heat or\r\nlight, the chemical effect will be very distinct. There seem to be rays,\r\ntherefore, more refrangible than the rays producing light and heat.\r\n\r\nThe general facts of the refraction and effects of the solar beam offer\r\nan analogy to the agencies of electricity.\r\n\r\nIn general, in Nature the effects of the solar rays are very compounded.\r\nHealthy vegetation depends upon the presence of the solar beams or of\r\nlight, and while the heat gives fluidity and mobility to the vegetable\r\njuices, chemical effects are likewise occasioned, oxygen is separated\r\nfrom them, and inflammable compounds are formed. Plants deprived of\r\nlight become white and contain an excess of saccharine and aqueous\r\nparticles; and flowers owe the variety of their hues to the influence of\r\nthe solar beams. Even animals require the presence of the rays of the\r\nsun, and their colours seem to depend upon the chemical influence of\r\nthese rays.\r\n\r\nTwo hypotheses have been invented to account for the principal\r\noperations of radiant matter. In the first it is supposed that the\r\nuniverse contains a highly rare elastic substance, which, when put into\r\na state of undulation, produces those effects on our organs of sight\r\nwhich constitute the sensations of vision and other phenomena caused by\r\nsolar and terrestrial rays. In the second it is conceived that particles\r\nare emitted from luminous or heat-making bodies with great velocity, and\r\nthat they produce their effects by communicating their motions to\r\nsubstances, or by entering into them and changing their composition.\r\n\r\nNewton has attempted to explain the different refrangibility of the rays\r\nof light by supposing them composed of particles differing in size. The\r\nsame great man has put the query whether light and common matter are not\r\nconvertible into each other; and, adopting the idea that the phenomena\r\nof sensible heat depend upon vibrations of the particles of bodies,\r\nsupposes that a certain intensity of vibrations may send off particles\r\ninto free space, and that particles in rapid motion in right lines, in\r\nlosing their own motion, may communicate a vibratory motion to the\r\nparticles of terrestrial bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHAEL FARADAY\r\n\r\nExperimental Researches in Electricity\r\n\r\n     Michael Faraday was the son of a Yorkshire blacksmith, and was born\r\n     in London on September 22, 1791. At the age of twenty he became\r\n     assistant to Sir Humphry Davy, whose lectures he had attended at\r\n     the Royal Institution. Here he worked for the rest of his laborious\r\n     life, which closed on August 25, 1867. The fame of Faraday, among\r\n     those whose studies qualify them for a verdict, has risen steadily\r\n     since his death, great though it then was. His researches were of\r\n     truly epoch-making character, and he was the undisputed founder of\r\n     the modern science of electricity, which is rapidly coming to\r\n     dominate chemistry itself. Faraday excelled as a lecturer, and\r\n     could stand even the supreme test of lecturing to children.\r\n     Faraday's \"Experimental Researches in Electricity\" is a record of\r\n     some of the most brilliant experiments in the history of science.\r\n     In the course of his investigations he made discoveries which have\r\n     had momentous consequences. His discovery of the mutual relation of\r\n     magnets and of wires conducting electric currents was the beginning\r\n     of the modern dynamo and all that it involves; while his\r\n     discoveries of electric induction and of electrolysis were of equal\r\n     significance. Most of the researches are too technical for\r\n     epitomisation; but those given are representative of his manner and\r\n     methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Atmospheric Magnetism_\r\n\r\nIt is to me an impossible thing to perceive that two-ninths of the\r\natmosphere by weight is a highly magnetic body, subject to great changes\r\nin its magnetic character, by variations in its temperature and\r\ncondensation or rarefaction, without being persuaded that it has much to\r\ndo with the variable disposition of the magnetic forces upon the surface\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nThe earth is a spheroidal body consisting of paramagnetic and\r\ndiamagnetic substances irregularly disposed and intermingled; but for\r\nthe present the whole may be considered a mighty compound magnet. The\r\nmagnetic force of this great magnet is known to us only on the surface\r\nof the earth and water of our planet, and the variations in the magnetic\r\nlines of force which pass in or across this surface can be measured by\r\ntheir action on small standard magnets; but these variations are limited\r\nin their information, and do not tell us whether the cause is in the air\r\nabove or the earth beneath.\r\n\r\nThe lines of force issue from the earth in the northern and southern\r\nparts and coalesce with each other over the equatorial, as would be the\r\ncase in a globe having one or two short magnets adjusted in relation to\r\nits axis, and it is probable that the lines of force in their circuitous\r\ncourse may extend through space to tens of thousands of miles. The lines\r\nproceed through space with a certain degree of facility, but there may\r\nbe variations in space, _e.g._, variations in its temperature which\r\naffect its power of transmitting the magnetic influence.\r\n\r\nBetween the earth and space, however, is interposed the atmosphere, and\r\nat the bottom of the atmosphere we live. The atmosphere consists of four\r\nvolumes of nitrogen and one of oxygen uniformly mixed and acting\r\nmagnetically as a single medium. The _nitrogen_ of the air is, as\r\nregards the magnetic force, neither paramagnetic nor diamagnetic,\r\nwhether dense or rare, or at high or low temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe _oxygen_ of the air, on the other hand, is highly paramagnetic,\r\nbeing, bulk for bulk, equivalent to a solution of protosulphate of iron,\r\ncontaining of the crystallised salt seventeen times the weight of the\r\noxygen. It becomes less paramagnetic, volume for volume, as it is\r\nrarefied, and apparently in the simple proportion of its rarefaction,\r\nthe temperature remaining the same. When its temperature is raised--the\r\nexpansion consequent thereon being permitted--it loses very greatly its\r\nparamagnetic force, and there is sufficient reason to conclude that when\r\nits temperature is lowered its paramagnetic condition is exalted. These\r\ncharacters oxygen preserves even when mingled with the nitrogen in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nHence the atmosphere is a highly magnetic medium, and this medium is\r\nchanged in its magnetic relations by every change in its density and\r\ntemperature, and must affect both the intensity and direction of the\r\nmagnetic force emanating from the earth, and may account for the\r\nvariations which we find in terrestrial magnetic power.\r\n\r\nWe may expect as the sun leaves us on the west some magnetic effect\r\ncorrespondent to that of the approach of a body of cold air from the\r\neast. Again, the innumerable circumstances that break up more or less\r\nany average arrangement of the air temperatures may be expected to give\r\nnot merely differences in the regularity, direction, and degree of\r\nmagnetic variation, but, because of vicinity, differences so large as to\r\nbe many times greater than the mean difference for a given short period,\r\nand they may also cause irregularities in the times of their occurrence.\r\nYet again, the atmosphere diminishes in density upwards, and this\r\ndiminution will affect the transmission of the electric force.\r\n\r\nThe result of the _annual variation_ that may be expected from the\r\nmagnetic constitution and condition of the atmosphere seems to me to be\r\nof the following kind.\r\n\r\nSince the axis of the earth's rotation is inclined 23° 28' to the plane\r\nof the ecliptic, the two hemispheres will become alternately warmer and\r\ncooler than each other. The air of the cooled hemisphere will conduct\r\nmagnetic influence more freely than if in the mean state, and the lines\r\nof force passing through it will increase in amount, whilst in the other\r\nhemisphere the warmed air will conduct with less readiness than before,\r\nand the intensity will diminish. In addition to this effect of\r\ntemperature, there ought to be another due to the increase of the\r\nponderable portion of the air in the cooled hemisphere, consequent on\r\nits contraction and the coincident expansion of the air in the warmer\r\nhalf, both of which circumstances tend to increase the variation in\r\npower of the two hemispheres from the normal state. Then, as the earth\r\nrolls on its annual journey, that which was at one time the cooler\r\nbecomes the warmer hemisphere, and in its turn sinks as far below the\r\naverage magnetic intensity as it before had stood above it, while the\r\nother hemisphere changes its magnetic condition from less to more\r\nintense.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Electro-Chemical Action_\r\n\r\nThe theory of definite electrolytical or electro-chemical action appears\r\nto me to touch immediately upon the absolute quantity of electricity\r\nbelonging to different bodies. As soon as we perceive that chemical\r\npowers are definite for each body, and that the electricity which we can\r\nloosen from each body has definite chemical action which can be\r\nmeasured, we seem to have found the link which connects the proportion\r\nof that we have evolved to the proportion belonging to the particles in\r\ntheir natural state.\r\n\r\nNow, it is wonderful to observe how small a quantity of a compound body\r\nis decomposed by a certain quantity of electricity. One grain of water,\r\nfor instance, acidulated to facilitate conduction, will require an\r\nelectric current to be continued for three minutes and three-quarters to\r\neffect its decomposition, and the current must be powerful enough to\r\nkeep a platina wire 1/104 inch in thickness red hot in the air during\r\nthe whole time, and to produce a very brilliant and constant star of\r\nlight if interrupted anywhere by charcoal points. It will not be too\r\nmuch to say that this necessary quantity of electricity is equal to a\r\nvery powerful flash of lightning; and yet when it has performed its full\r\nwork of electrolysis, it has separated the elements of only a single\r\ngrain of water.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the relation between the conduction of the\r\nelectricity and the decomposition of the water is so close that one\r\ncannot take place without the other. If the water be altered only in\r\nthat degree which consists in its having the solid instead of the fluid\r\nstate, the conduction is stopped and the decomposition is stopped with\r\nit. Whether the conduction be considered as depending upon the\r\ndecomposition or not, still the relation of the two functions is equally\r\nintimate.\r\n\r\nConsidering this close and twofold relation--namely, that without\r\ndecomposition transmission of electricity does not occur, and that for a\r\ngiven definite quantity of electricity passed an equally definite and\r\nconstant quantity of water or other matter is decomposed; considering\r\nalso that the agent, which is electricity, is simply employed in\r\novercoming electrical powers in the body subjected to its action, it\r\nseems a probable and almost a natural consequence that the quantity\r\nwhich passes is the equivalent of that of the particles separated;\r\n_i.e._, that if the electrical power which holds the elements of a grain\r\nof water in combination, or which makes a grain of oxygen and hydrogen\r\nin the right proportions unite into water when they are made to combine,\r\ncould be thrown into a current, it would exactly equal the current\r\nrequired for the separation of that grain of water into its elements\r\nagain; in other words, that the electricity which decomposes and that\r\nwhich is evolved by the decomposition of a certain quantity of matter\r\nare alike.\r\n\r\nThis view of the subject gives an almost overwhelming idea of the\r\nextraordinary quantity or degree of electric power which naturally\r\nbelongs to the particles of matter, and the idea may be illustrated by\r\nreference to the voltaic pile.\r\n\r\nThe source of the electricity in the voltaic instrument is due almost\r\nentirely to chemical action. Substances interposed between its metals\r\nare all electrolytes, and the current cannot be transmitted without\r\ntheir decomposition. If, now, a voltaic trough have its extremities\r\nconnected by a body capable of being decomposed, such as water, we shall\r\nhave a continuous current through the apparatus, and we may regard the\r\npart where the acid is acting on the plates and the part where the\r\ncurrent is acting upon the water as the reciprocals of each other. In\r\nboth parts we have the two conditions, _inseparable in such bodies as\r\nthese_: the passing of a current, and decomposition. In the one case we\r\nhave decomposition associated with a current; in the other, a current\r\nfollowed by decomposition.\r\n\r\nLet us apply this in support of my surmise respecting the enormous\r\nelectric power of each particle or atom of matter.\r\n\r\nTwo wires, one of platina, and one of zinc, each one-eighteenth of an\r\ninch in diameter, placed five-sixteenths of an inch apart, and immersed\r\nto the depth of five-eighths of an inch in acid, consisting of one drop\r\nof oil of vitriol and four ounces of distilled water at a temperature of\r\nabout 60° Fahrenheit, and connected at the other ends by a copper wire\r\neighteen feet long, and one-eighteenth of an inch in thickness, yielded\r\nas much electricity in little more than three seconds of time as a\r\nLeyden battery charged by thirty turns of a very large and powerful\r\nplate electric machine in full action. This quantity, although\r\nsufficient if passed at once through the head of a rat or cat to have\r\nkilled it, as by a flash of lightning, was evolved by the mutual action\r\nof so small a portion of the zinc wire and water in contact with it that\r\nthe loss of weight by either would be inappreciable; and as to the water\r\nwhich could be decomposed by that current, it must have been insensible\r\nin quantity, for no trace of hydrogen appeared upon the surface of the\r\nplatina during these three seconds. It would appear that 800,000 such\r\ncharges of the Leyden battery would be necessary to decompose a single\r\ngrain of water; or, if I am right, to equal the quantity of electricity\r\nwhich is naturally associated with the elements of that grain of water,\r\nendowing them with their mutual chemical affinity.\r\n\r\nThis theory of the definite evolution and the equivalent definite action\r\nof electricity beautifully harmonises the associated theories of\r\ndefinite proportions and electro-chemical affinity.\r\n\r\nAccording to it, the equivalent weights of bodies are simply those\r\nquantities of them which contain equal quantities of electricity, or\r\nhave naturally equal electric powers, it being the electricity which\r\n_determines_ the equivalent number, _because_ it determines the\r\ncombining force. Or, if we adopt the atomic theory or phraseology, then\r\nthe atoms of bodies which are equivalent to each other in their ordinary\r\nchemical action have equal quantities of electricity naturally\r\nassociated with them. I cannot refrain from recalling here the beautiful\r\nidea put forth, I believe, by Berzelius in his development of his views\r\nof the electro-chemical theory of affinity, that the heat and light\r\nevolved during cases of powerful combination are the consequence of the\r\nelectric discharge which is at the moment taking place. The idea is in\r\nperfect accordance with the view I have taken of the quantity of\r\nelectricity associated with the particles of matter.\r\n\r\nThe definite production of electricity in association with its definite\r\naction proves, I think, that the current of electricity in the voltaic\r\npile is sustained by chemical decomposition, or, rather, by chemical\r\naction, and not by contact only. But here, as elsewhere, I beg to\r\nreserve my opinion as to the real action of contact.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, however, that chemical action is the source of electricity,\r\nwhat an infinitely small fraction of that which is active do we obtain\r\nand employ in our voltaic batteries! Zinc and platina wires\r\none-eighteenth of an inch in diameter and about half an inch long,\r\ndipped into dilute sulphuric acid, so weak that it is not sensibly sour\r\nto the tongue, or scarcely sensitive to our most delicate test papers,\r\nwill evolve more electricity in one-twentieth of a minute than any man\r\nwould willingly allow to pass through his body at once.\r\n\r\nThe chemical energy represented by the satisfaction of the chemical\r\naffinities of a grain of water and four grains of zinc can evolve\r\nelectricity equal in quantity to that of a powerful thunderstorm. Nor is\r\nit merely true that the quantity is active; it can be directed--made to\r\nperform its full equivalent duty. Is there not, then, great reason to\r\nbelieve that, by a closer investigation of the development and action of\r\nthis subtile agent, we shall be able to increase the power of our\r\nbatteries, or to invent new instruments which shall a thousandfold\r\nsurpass in energy those we at present possess?\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--The Gymnotus, or Electric Eel_\r\n\r\nWonderful as are the laws and phenomena of electricity when made evident\r\nto us in inorganic or dead matter, their interest can bear scarcely any\r\ncomparison with that which attaches to the same force when connected\r\nwith the nervous system and with life.\r\n\r\nThe existence of animals able to give the same concussion to the living\r\nsystem as the electrical machine, the voltaic battery, and the\r\nthunderstorm being made known to us by various naturalists, it became\r\nimportant to identify their electricity with the electricity produced by\r\nman from dead matter. In the case of the _Torpedo_ [a fish belonging to\r\nthe family of Electric Rings] this identity has been fully proved, but\r\nin the case of the _Gymnotus_ the proof has not been quite complete, and\r\nI thought it well to obtain a specimen of the latter fish.\r\n\r\nA gymnotus being obtained, I conducted a series of experiments. Besides\r\nthe hands two kinds of collectors of electricity were used--one with a\r\ncopper disc for contact with the fish, and the other with a plate of\r\ncopper bent into saddle shape, so that it might enclose a certain\r\nextent of the back and sides of the fish. These conductors, being put\r\nover the fish, collected power sufficient to produce many electric\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nSHOCK. The shock was very powerful when the hands were placed one near\r\nthe head and the other near the tail, and the nearer the hands were\r\ntogether, within certain limits, the less powerful was the shock. The\r\ndisc conductors conveyed the shock very well when the hands were wetted.\r\n\r\nGALVANOMETER. A galvanometer was readily affected by using the saddle\r\nconductors, applied to the anterior and posterior parts of the gymnotus.\r\nA powerful discharge of the fish caused a deflection of thirty or forty\r\ndegrees. The deflection was constantly in a given direction, the\r\nelectric current being always from the anterior part of the animal\r\nthrough the galvanometer wire to the posterior parts. The former were,\r\ntherefore, for the time externally positive and the latter negative.\r\n\r\nMAKING A MAGNET. When a little helix containing twenty-two feet of\r\nsilked wire wound on a quill was put into a circuit, and an annealed\r\nsteel needle placed in the helix, the needle became a magnet; and the\r\ndirection of its polarity in every cast indicated a current from the\r\nanterior to the posterior parts of the gymnotus.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION. Polar decomposition of a solution of iodide of\r\npotassium was easily obtained.\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF HEAT. Using a Harris' thermo-electrometer, we thought we\r\nwere able, in one instance, to observe a feeble elevation of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nSPARK. By suitable apparatus a spark was obtained four times.\r\n\r\nSuch were the general electric phenomena obtained from the gymnotus, and\r\non several occasions many of the phenomena were obtained together. Thus,\r\na magnet was made, a galvanometer deflected, and, perhaps, a wire heated\r\nby one single discharge of the electric force of the animal. When the\r\nshock is strong, it is like that of a large Leyden battery charged to a\r\nlow degree, or that of a good voltaic battery of, perhaps, one hundred\r\nor more pairs of plates, of which the circuit is completed for a moment\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured by experiment to form some idea of the quantity of\r\nelectricity, and came to the conclusion that a single medium discharge\r\nof the fish is at least equal to the electricity of a Leyden battery of\r\nfifteen jars, containing 3,500 square inches of glass coated on both\r\nsides, charged to its highest degree. This conclusion is in perfect\r\naccordance with the degree of deflection which the discharge can produce\r\nin a galvanometer needle, and also with the amount of chemical\r\ndecomposition produced in the electrolysing experiments.\r\n\r\nThe gymnotus frequently gives a double and even a triple shock, with\r\nscarcely a sensible interval between each discharge.\r\n\r\nAs at the moment of shock the anterior parts are positive and the\r\nposterior negative, it may be concluded that there is a current from the\r\nformer to the latter through every part of the water which surrounds the\r\nanimal, to a considerable distance from its body. The shock which is\r\nfelt, therefore, when the hands are in the most favourable position is\r\nthe effect of a very small portion only of the electricity which the\r\nanimal discharges at the moment, by far the largest portion passing\r\nthrough the surrounding water.\r\n\r\nThis enormous external current must be accompanied by some effect within\r\nthe fish _equivalent_ to a current, the direction of which is from the\r\ntail towards the head, and equal to the sum of _all these external_\r\nforces. Whether the process of evolving or exciting the electricity\r\nwithin the fish includes the production of the internal current, which\r\nis not necessarily so quick and momentary as the external one, we cannot\r\nat present say; but at the time of the shock the animal does not\r\napparently feel the electric sensation which he causes in those around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe gymnotus can stun and kill fish which are in very various relations\r\nto its own body. The extent of surface which the fish that is about to\r\nbe struck offers to the water conducting the electricity increases the\r\neffect of the shock, and the larger the fish, accordingly, the greater\r\nmust be the shock to which it will be subjected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chemical History of a Candle\r\n\r\n     \"The Chemical History of a Candle\" was the most famous course in\r\n     the long and remarkable series of Christmas lectures, \"adapted to a\r\n     juvenile auditory,\" at the Royal Institution, and remains a\r\n     rarely-approached model of what such lectures should be. They were\r\n     illustrated by experiments and specimens, but did not depend upon\r\n     these for coherence and interest. They were delivered in 1860-61,\r\n     and have just been translated, though all but half-a-century old,\r\n     into German.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Candles and their Flames_\r\n\r\nThere is not a law under which any part of this universe is governed\r\nthat does not come into play in the phenomena of the chemical history of\r\na candle. There is no better door by which you can enter into the study\r\nof natural philosophy than by considering the physical phenomena of a\r\ncandle.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my boys and girls, I must first tell you of what candles are\r\nmade. Some are great curiosities. I have here some bits of timber,\r\nbranches of trees particularly famous for their burning. And here you\r\nsee a piece of that very curious substance taken out of some of the bogs\r\nin Ireland, called _candle-wood_--a hard, strong, excellent wood,\r\nevidently fitted for good work as a resister of force, and yet withal\r\nburning so well that, where it is found, they make splinters of it, and\r\ntorches, since it burns like a candle, and gives a very good light\r\nindeed. And in this wood we have one of the most beautiful illustrations\r\nof the general nature of a candle that I can possibly give. The fuel\r\nprovided, the means of bringing that fuel to the place of chemical\r\naction, the regular and gradual supply of air to that place of\r\naction--heat and light all produced by a little piece of wood of this\r\nkind, forming, in fact, a natural candle.\r\n\r\nBut we must speak of candles as they are in commerce. Here are a couple\r\nof candles commonly called dips. They are made of lengths of cotton cut\r\noff, hung up by a loop, dipped into melted tallow, taken out again and\r\ncooled; then re-dipped until there is an accumulation of tallow round\r\nthe cotton. However, a candle, you know, is not now a greasy thing like\r\nan ordinary tallow candle, but a clean thing; and you may almost scrape\r\noff and pulverise the drops which fall from it without soiling anything.\r\n\r\nThe candle I have in my hand is a stearine candle, made of stearine from\r\ntallow. Then here is a sperm candle, which comes from the purified oil\r\nof the spermaceti whale. Here, also, are yellow beeswax and refined\r\nbeeswax from which candles are made. Here, too, is that curious\r\nsubstance called paraffin, and some paraffin candles made of paraffin\r\nobtained from the bogs of Ireland. I have here also a substance brought\r\nfrom Japan, a sort of wax which a kind friend has sent me, and which\r\nforms a new material for the manufacture of candles.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the light of the candle. We will light one or two, and set\r\nthem at work in the performance of their proper function. You observe a\r\ncandle is a very different thing from a lamp. With a lamp you take a\r\nlittle oil, fill your vessel, put in a little moss, or some cotton\r\nprepared by artificial means, and then light the top of the wick. When\r\nthe flame runs down the cotton to the oil, it gets stopped, but it goes\r\non burning in the part above. Now, I have no doubt you will ask, how is\r\nit that the oil, which will not burn of itself, gets up to the top of\r\nthe cotton, where it will burn? We shall presently examine that; but\r\nthere is a much more wonderful thing about the burning of a candle than\r\nthis. You have here a solid substance with no vessel to contain it; and\r\nhow is it that this solid substance can get up to the place where the\r\nflame is? Or, when it is made a fluid, then how is it that it keeps\r\ntogether? This is a wonderful thing about a candle.\r\n\r\nYou see, then, in the first instance, that a beautiful cup is formed. As\r\nthe air comes to the candle, it moves upwards by the force of the\r\ncurrent which the heat of the candle produces, and it so cools all the\r\nsides of the wax, tallow, or fuel as to keep the edge much cooler than\r\nthe part within; the part within melts by the flame that runs down the\r\nwick as far as it can go before it is stopped, but the part on the\r\noutside does not melt. If I made a current in one direction, my cup\r\nwould be lopsided, and the fluid would consequently run over--for the\r\nsame force of gravity which holds worlds together, holds this fluid in a\r\nhorizontal position. You see, therefore, that the cup is formed by this\r\nbeautifully regular ascending current of air playing upon all sides,\r\nwhich keeps the exterior of the candle cool. No fuel would serve for a\r\ncandle which has not the property of giving this cup, except such fuel\r\nas the Irish bogwood, where the material itself is like a sponge, and\r\nholds its own fuel.\r\n\r\nYou see now why you have such a bad result if you burn those beautiful\r\nfluted candles, which are irregular, intermittent in their shape, and\r\ncannot therefore have that nicely-formed edge to the cup which is the\r\ngreat beauty in a candle. I hope you will now see that the perfection of\r\na process--that is, its utility--is the better point of beauty about it.\r\nIt is not the best-looking thing, but the best-acting thing which is the\r\nmost advantageous to us. This good-looking candle is a bad burning one.\r\nThere will be a guttering round about it because of the irregularity of\r\nthe stream of air and the badness of the cup which is formed thereby.\r\n\r\nYou may see some pretty examples of the action of the ascending current\r\nwhen you have a little gutter run down the side of a candle, making it\r\nthicker there than it is elsewhere. As the candle goes on burning, that\r\nkeeps its place and forms a little pillar sticking up by the side,\r\nbecause, as it rises higher above the rest of the wax or fuel, the air\r\ngets better round it, and it is more cooled and better able to resist\r\nthe action of the heat at a little distance. Now, the greatest mistakes\r\nand faults with regard to candles, as in many other things, often bring\r\nwith them instruction which we should not receive if they had not\r\noccurred. You will always remember that whenever a result happens,\r\nespecially if it be new, you should say: \"What is the cause? Why does it\r\noccur?\" And you will in the course of time find out the reason.\r\n\r\nThen there is another point about these candles which will answer a\r\nquestion--that is, as to the way in which this fluid gets out of the\r\ncup, up to the wick, and into the place of combustion. You know that the\r\nflames on these burning wicks in candles made of beeswax, stearine, or\r\nspermaceti, do not run down to the wax or other matter, and melt it all\r\naway, but keep to their own right place. They are fenced off from the\r\nfluid below, and do not encroach on the cup at the sides.\r\n\r\nI cannot imagine a more beautiful example than the condition of\r\nadjustment under which a candle makes one part subserve to the other to\r\nthe very end of its action. A combustible thing like that, burning away\r\ngradually, never being intruded upon by the flame, is a very beautiful\r\nsight; especially when you come to learn what a vigorous thing flame is,\r\nwhat power it has of destroying the wax itself when it gets hold of it,\r\nand of disturbing its proper form if it come only too near.\r\n\r\nBut how does the flame get hold of the fuel? There is a beautiful point\r\nabout that. It is by what is called capillary attraction that the fuel\r\nis conveyed to the part where combustion goes on, and is deposited\r\nthere, not in a careless way, but very beautifully in the very midst of\r\nthe centre of action which takes place around it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--The Brightness of the Candle_\r\n\r\nAir is absolutely necessary for combustion; and, what is more, I must\r\nhave you understand that _fresh_ air is necessary, or else we should be\r\nimperfect in our reasoning and our experiments. Here is a jar of air. I\r\nplace it over a candle, and it burns very nicely in it at first, showing\r\nthat what I have said about it is true; but there will soon be a change.\r\nSee how the flame is drawing upwards, presently fading, and at last\r\ngoing out. And going out, why? Not because it wants air merely, for the\r\njar is as full now as it was before, but it wants pure, fresh air. The\r\njar is full of air, partly changed, partly not changed; but it does not\r\ncontain sufficient of the fresh air for combustion.\r\n\r\nSuppose I take a candle, and examine that part of it which appears\r\nbrightest to our eyes. Why, there I get these black particles, which are\r\njust the smoke of the candle; and this brings to mind that old\r\nemployment which Dean Swift recommended to servants for their amusement,\r\nnamely, writing on the ceiling of a room with a candle. But what is that\r\nblack substance? Why, it is the same carbon which exists in the candle.\r\nIt evidently existed in the candle, or else we should not have had it\r\nhere. You would hardly think that all those substances which fly about\r\nLondon in the form of soots and blacks are the very beauty and life of\r\nthe flame. Here is a piece of wire gauze which will not let the flame go\r\nthrough it, and I think you will see, almost immediately, that, when I\r\nbring it low enough to touch that part of the flame which is otherwise\r\nso bright, it quells and quenches it at once, and allows a volume of\r\nsmoke to rise up.\r\n\r\nWhenever a substance burns without assuming the vaporous state--whether\r\nit becomes liquid or remains solid--it becomes exceedingly luminous.\r\nWhat I say is applicable to all substances--whether they burn or whether\r\nthey do not burn--that they are exceedingly bright if they retain their\r\nsolid state when heated, and that it is to this presence of solid\r\nparticles in the candle-flame that it owes its brilliancy.\r\n\r\nI have here a piece of carbon, or charcoal, which will burn and give us\r\nlight exactly in the same manner as if it were burnt as part of a\r\ncandle. The heat that is in the flame of a candle decomposes the vapour\r\nof the wax, and sets free the carbon particles--they rise up heated and\r\nglowing as this now glows, and then enter into the air. But the\r\nparticles when burnt never pass off from a candle in the form of carbon.\r\nThey go off into the air as a perfectly invisible substance, about which\r\nwe shall know hereafter.\r\n\r\nIs it not beautiful to think that such a process is going on, and that\r\nsuch a dirty thing as charcoal can become so incandescent? You see, it\r\ncomes to this--that all bright flames contain these solid particles; all\r\nthings that burn and produce solid particles, either during the time\r\nthey are burning, as in the candle, or immediately after being burnt, as\r\nin the case of the gunpowder and iron-filings--all these things give us\r\nthis glorious and beautiful light.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--The Products of Combustion_\r\n\r\nWe observe that there are certain products as the result of the\r\ncombustion of a candle, and that of these products one portion may be\r\nconsidered as charcoal, or soot; that charcoal, when afterwards burnt,\r\nproduces some other product--carbonic acid, as we shall see; and it\r\nconcerns us very much now to ascertain what yet a third product is.\r\n\r\nSuppose I take a candle and place it under a jar. You see that the sides\r\nof the jar become cloudy, and the light begins to burn feebly. It is the\r\nproducts, you see, which make the light so dim, and this is the same\r\nthing which makes the sides of the jar so opaque. If you go home and\r\ntake a spoon that has been in the cold air, and hold it over a\r\ncandle--not so as to soot it--you will find that it becomes dim, just as\r\nthat jar is dim. If you can get a silver dish, or something of that\r\nkind, you will make the experiment still better. It is _water_ which\r\ncauses the dimness, and we can make it, without difficulty, assume the\r\nform of a liquid.\r\n\r\nAnd so we can go on with almost all combustible substances, and we find\r\nthat if they burn with a flame, as a candle, they produce water. You may\r\nmake these experiments yourselves. The head of a poker is a very good\r\nthing to try with, and if it remains cold long enough over the candle,\r\nyou may get water condensed in drops on it; or a spoon, or a ladle, or\r\nanything else may be used, provided it be clean, and can carry off the\r\nheat, and so condense the water.\r\n\r\nAnd now--to go into the history of this wonderful production of water\r\nfrom combustibles, and by combustion--I must first of all tell you that\r\nthis water may exist in different conditions; and although you may now\r\nbe acquainted with all its forms, they still require us to give a little\r\nattention to them for the present, so that we may perceive how the\r\nwater, whilst it goes through its protean changes, is entirely and\r\nabsolutely the same thing, whether it is produced from a candle, by\r\ncombustion, or from the rivers or ocean.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, water, when at the coldest, is ice. Now, we speak of water\r\nas water; whether it be in its solid, or liquid, or gaseous state, we\r\nspeak of it chemically as water.\r\n\r\nWe shall not in future be deceived, therefore, by any changes that are\r\nproduced in water. Water is the same everywhere, whether produced from\r\nthe ocean or from the flame of the candle. Where, then, is this water\r\nwhich we get from a candle? It evidently comes, as to part of it, from\r\nthe candle; but is it within the candle beforehand? No! It is not in the\r\ncandle; and it is not in the air round about the candle, which is\r\nnecessary for its combustion. It is neither in one nor the other, but it\r\ncomes from their conjoint action, a part from the candle, a part from\r\nthe air. And this we have now to trace.\r\n\r\nIf we decompose water we can obtain from it a gas. This is hydrogen--a\r\nbody classed amongst those things in chemistry which we call elements,\r\nbecause we can get nothing else out of them. A candle is not an\r\nelementary body, because we can get carbon out of it; we can get this\r\nhydrogen out of it, or at least out of the water which it supplies. And\r\nthis gas has been so named hydrogen because it is that element which, in\r\nassociation with another, generates water.\r\n\r\nHydrogen gives rise to no substance that can become solid, either during\r\ncombustion or afterwards, as a product of its combustion. But when it\r\nburns it produces water only; and if we take a cold glass and put it\r\nover the flame, it becomes damp, and you have water produced immediately\r\nin appreciable quantity, and nothing is produced by its combustion but\r\nthe same water which you have seen the flame of a candle produce. This\r\nhydrogen is the only thing in Nature that furnishes water as the sole\r\nproduct of combustion.\r\n\r\nWater can be decomposed by electricity, and then we find that its other\r\nconstituent is the gas oxygen in which, as can easily be shown, a candle\r\nor a lamp burns much more brilliantly than it does in air, but produces\r\nthe same products as when it burns in air. We thus find that oxygen is\r\na constituent of the air, and by burning something in the air we can\r\nremove the oxygen therefrom, leaving behind for our study the nitrogen,\r\nwhich constitutes about four-fifths of the air, the oxygen accounting\r\nfor nearly all the rest.\r\n\r\nThe other great product of the burning of a candle is carbonic acid--a\r\ngas formed by the union of the carbon of the candle and the oxygen of\r\nthe air. Whenever carbon burns, whether in a candle or in a living\r\ncreature, it produces carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--Combustion and Respiration_\r\n\r\nNow I must take you to a very interesting part of our subject--to the\r\nrelation between the combustion of a candle and that living kind of\r\ncombustion which goes on within us. In every one of us there is a living\r\nprocess of combustion going on very similar to that of a candle. For it\r\nis not merely true in a poetical sense--the relation of the life of man\r\nto a taper. A candle will burn some four, five, six, or seven hours.\r\nWhat, then, must be the daily amount of carbon going up into the air in\r\nthe way of carbonic acid? What a quantity of carbon must go from each of\r\nus in respiration! A man in twenty-four hours converts as much as seven\r\nounces of carbon into carbonic acid; a milch cow will convert seventy\r\nounces, and a horse seventy-nine ounces, solely by the act of\r\nrespiration. That is, the horse in twenty-four hours burns seventy-nine\r\nounces of charcoal, or carbon, in his organs of respiration to supply\r\nhis natural warmth in that time.\r\n\r\nAll the warm-blooded animals get their warmth in this way, by the\r\nconversion of carbon; not in a free state, but in a state of\r\ncombination. And what an extraordinary notion this gives us of the\r\nalterations going out in our atmosphere! As much as 5,000,000 pounds of\r\ncarbonic acid is formed by respiration in London alone in twenty-four\r\nhours. And where does all this go? Up into the air. If the carbon had\r\nbeen like lead or iron, which, in burning, produces a solid substance,\r\nwhat would happen? Combustion would not go on. As charcoal burns, it\r\nbecomes a vapour and passes off into the atmosphere, which is the great\r\nvehicle, the great carrier, for conveying it away to other places. Then,\r\nwhat becomes of it?\r\n\r\nWonderful is it to find that the change produced by respiration, which\r\nseems so injurious to us, for we cannot breathe air twice over, is the\r\nvery life and support of plants and vegetables that grow upon the\r\nsurface of the earth. It is the same also under the surface in the great\r\nbodies of water, for fishes and other animals respire upon the same\r\nprinciple, though not exactly by contact with the open air. They respire\r\nby the oxygen which is dissolved from the air by the water, and form\r\ncarbonic acid; and they all move about to produce the one great work of\r\nmaking the animal and vegetable kingdoms subservient to each other.\r\n\r\nAll the plants growing upon the surface of the earth absorb carbon.\r\nThese leaves are taking up their carbon from the atmosphere, to which we\r\nhave given it in the form of carbonic acid, and they are prospering.\r\nGive them a pure air like ours, and they could not live in it; give them\r\ncarbon with other matters, and they live and rejoice. So are we made\r\ndependent not merely upon our fellow-creatures, but upon our\r\nfellow-existers, all Nature being tied by the laws that make one part\r\nconduce to the good of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUSTE FOREL\r\n\r\nThe Senses of Insects\r\n\r\n     Auguste Forel, who in 1909 retired from the Chair of Morbid\r\n     Psychology in the University of Zürich, was born on September 1,\r\n     1848, and is one of the greatest students of the minds and senses\r\n     of the lower animals and mankind. Among his most famous works are\r\n     his \"Hygiene of Nerves and Mind,\" his great treatise on the whole\r\n     problem of sex in human life, of which a cheap edition entitled\r\n     \"Sexual Ethics\" is published, his work on hypnotism, and his\r\n     numerous contributions to the psychology of insects. The chief\r\n     studies of this remarkable and illustrious student and thinker for\r\n     many decades past have been those of the senses and mental\r\n     faculties of insects. He has recorded the fact that his study of\r\n     the beehive led him to his present views as to the right\r\n     constitution of the state--views which may be described as\r\n     socialism with a difference. His work on insects has served the\r\n     study of human psychology, and is in itself the most important\r\n     contribution to insect psychology ever made by a single student.\r\n     Only within the last two years has the work of Forel, long famous\r\n     on the European Continent, begun to be known abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Insect Activity and Instinct_\r\n\r\nThis subject is one of great interest, as much from the standpoint of\r\nbiology as from that of comparative psychology. The very peculiar\r\nmechanism of instincts always has its starting-point in sensations. To\r\ncomprehend this mechanism it is essential to understand thoroughly the\r\norgans of sense and their special functions.\r\n\r\nIt is further necessary to study the co-ordination which exists between\r\nthe action of the different senses, and leads to their intimate\r\nconnection with the functions of the nerve-centres, that is to say, with\r\nthe specially instinctive intelligence of insects. The whole question\r\nis, therefore, a chapter of comparative psychology, a chapter in which\r\nit is necessary to take careful note of every factor, to place oneself,\r\nso to speak, on a level with the mind of an insect, and, above all, to\r\navoid the anthropomorphic errors with which works upon the subject are\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the other extreme must equally be\r\navoided--\"anthropophobia,\" which at all costs desires to see in every\r\nliving organism a \"machine,\" forgetting that a \"machine\" which lives,\r\nthat is to say, which grows, takes in nutriment, and strikes a balance\r\nbetween income and expenditure, which, in a word, continually\r\nreconstructs itself, is not a \"machine,\" but something entirely\r\ndifferent. In other words, it is necessary to steer clear of two\r\ndangers. We must avoid (1) identifying the mind of an insect with our\r\nown, but, above all, (2) imagining that we, with what knowledge we\r\npossess, can reconstruct the mind by our chemical and physical laws.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have to recognise the fact that this mind, and the\r\nsensory functions which put it on its guard, are derived, just as with\r\nour human selves, from the primitive protoplasmic life. This life, so\r\nfar as it is specialised in the nervous system by nerve irritability and\r\nits connections with the muscular system, is manifested under two\r\naspects. These may be likened to two branches of one trunk.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Automatic_ or _instinctive_ activity. This, though perfected by\r\nrepetition, is definitely inherited. It is uncontrollable and constant\r\nin effect, adapted to the circumstances of the special life of the race\r\nin question. It is this curious instinctive adaptation--which is so\r\nintelligent when it carries out its proper task, so stupid and incapable\r\nwhen diverted to some other purpose--that has deceived so many\r\nscientists and philosophers by its insidious analogy with humanly\r\nconstructed machines.\r\n\r\nBut, automatic as it may appear, instinct is not invariable. In the\r\nfirst place, it presents a racial evolution which of itself alone\r\nalready demonstrates a certain degree of plasticity from generation to\r\ngeneration. It presents, further, individual variations which are more\r\ndistinct as it is less deeply fixed by heredity. Thus the divergent\r\ninstincts of two varieties, _e.g._, of insects, present more individual\r\nvariability and adaptability than do those instincts common to all\r\nspecies of a genus. In short, if we carefully study the behaviour of\r\neach individual of a species of insects with a developed brain (as has\r\nbeen done by P. Huber, Lubbock, Wasmann, and myself, among others, for\r\nbees, wasps, and ants), we are not long in finding noteworthy\r\ndifferences, especially when we put the instinct under abnormal\r\nconditions. We then force the nervous activity of these insects to\r\npresent a second and plastic aspect, which to a large extent has been\r\nhidden from us under their enormously developed instinct.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _plastic_ or _adaptive_ activity is by no means, as has been\r\nso often suggested, a derivative of instinct. It is primitive. It is\r\neven the fundamental condition of the evolution of life. The living\r\nbeing is distinguished by its power of adaptation; even the amoeba is\r\nplastic. But in order that one individual may adapt itself to a host of\r\nconditions and possibilities, as is the case with the higher mammals and\r\nespecially with man, the brain requires an enormous quantity of nerve\r\nelements. But this is not the case with the fixed and specialised\r\nadaptation of instinct.\r\n\r\nIn secondary automatism, or habit, which we observe in ourselves, it is\r\neasy to study how this activity, derived from plastic activity, and ever\r\nbecoming more prompt, complex, and sure (technical habits), necessitates\r\nless and less expenditure of nerve effort. It is very difficult to\r\nunderstand how inherited instinct, hereditary automatism, could have\r\noriginated from the plastic activities of our ancestors. It seems as if\r\na very slow selection, among individuals best adapted in consequence of\r\nfortunate parentage, might perhaps account for it.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, every animal possesses two kinds of activity in varying\r\ndegrees, sometimes one, sometimes the other predominating. In the lowest\r\nbeings they are both rudimentary. In insects, special automatic activity\r\nreaches the summit of development and predominance; in man, on the\r\ncontrary, with his great brain development, plastic activity is elevated\r\nto an extraordinary height, above all by language, and before all by\r\nwritten language, which substitutes graphic fixation for secondary\r\nautomatism, and allows the accumulation outside the brain of the\r\nknowledge of past generations, thus serving his plastic activity, at\r\nonce the adapter and combiner of what the past has bequeathed to it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the families, _genera_, and species of insects, the\r\ndevelopment of different senses varies extremely. We meet with most\r\nstriking contrasts, and contrasts which have not been sufficiently\r\nnoticed. Certain insects, dragon-flies, for instance, live almost\r\nentirely by means of sight. Others are blind, or almost blind, and\r\nsubsist exclusively by smell and taste (insects inhabiting caves, most\r\nworking ants). Hearing is well developed in certain forms (crickets,\r\nlocusts), but most insects appear not to hear, or to hear with\r\ndifficulty. Despite their thick, chitinous skeleton, almost all insects\r\nhave extremely sensitive touch, especially in the antennæ, but not\r\nconfined thereto.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary to bear in mind the mental faculties of\r\ninsects in order to judge with a fair degree of accuracy how they use\r\ntheir senses. We shall return to that point when summing up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--The Vision of Insects_\r\n\r\nIn vision we are dealing with a certain definite stimulus--light, with\r\nits two modifications, colour and motion. Insects have two sets of\r\norgans for vision, the faceted eye and the so-called simple eye, or\r\nocellus. These have been historically derived from one and the same\r\norgan. In order to exercise the function of sight the facets need a\r\ngreater pencil of light rays by night than by day. To obtain the same\r\nresult we dilate the pupil. But nocturnal insects are dazzled by the\r\nlight of day, and diurnal insects cannot see by night, for neither\r\npossess the faculty of accommodation. Insects are specially able to\r\nperceive motion, but there are only very few insects that can see\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\nFor example, I watched one day a wasp chasing a fly on the wall of a\r\nveranda, as is the habit of this insect at the end of summer and in the\r\nautumn. She dashed violently in flight at the flies sitting on the wall,\r\nwhich mostly escaped. She continued her pursuit with remarkable\r\npertinacity, and succeeded on several occasions in catching a fly, which\r\nshe killed, mutilated, and bore away to her nest. Each time she quickly\r\nreturned to continue the hunt.\r\n\r\nIn one spot of the wall was stuck a black nail, which was just the size\r\nof a fly, and I saw the wasp very frequently deceived by this nail, upon\r\nwhich she sprang, leaving it as soon as she perceived her error on\r\ntouching it. Nevertheless, she made the same mistake with the nail\r\nshortly after. I have often made similar observations. We may certainly\r\nconclude that the wasp saw something of the size of a fly, but without\r\ndistinguishing the details; therefore she saw it indistinctly. Evidently\r\na wasp does not only perceive motion; she also distinguishes the size of\r\nobjects. When I put dead flies on a table to be carried off by another\r\nwasp, she took them, one after another, as well as spiders and other\r\ninsects of but little different size placed by their side. On the other\r\nhand, she took no notice of insects much larger or much smaller put\r\namong the flies.\r\n\r\nMost entomologists have observed with what ingenuity and sureness\r\ndragon-flies distinguish, follow, and catch the smallest insects on the\r\nwing. Of all insects, they have the best sight. Their enormous convex\r\neyes have the greatest number of facets. Their number has been estimated\r\nat 12,000, and even at 17,000. Their aerial chases resemble those of the\r\nswallows. By trying to catch them at the edge of a large pond, one can\r\neasily convince oneself that the dragon-flies amuse themselves by making\r\nsport of the hunter; they will always allow one to approach just near\r\nenough to miss catching them. It can be seen to what degree they are\r\nable to measure the distance and reach of their enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is an absolute fact that dragon-flies, unless it is cold or in the\r\nevening, always manage to fly at just that distance at which the student\r\ncannot touch them; and they see perfectly well whether one is armed with\r\na net or has nothing but his hands; one might even say that they measure\r\nthe length of the handle of the net, for the possession of a long handle\r\nis no advantage. They fly just out of reach of one's instrument,\r\nwhatever trouble one may give oneself by hiding it from them and\r\nsuddenly lunging as they fly off. Whoever watches butterflies and flies\r\nwill soon see that these insects also can measure the distance of such\r\nobjects as are not far from them. The males and females of bees and ants\r\ndistinguish one another on the wing. It is rare for an individual to\r\nlose sight of the swarm or to miss what it pursues flying. It has been\r\nproved that the sense of smell has nothing to do with this matter. Thus\r\ninsects, though without any power of accommodation for light or\r\ndistance, are able to perceive objects at different distances.\r\n\r\nIt is known that many insects will blindly fly and dash against a lamp\r\nat night, until they burn themselves. It has often been wrongly thought\r\nthat they are fascinated. We ought first to remember that natural\r\nlights, concentrated at one point like our artificial lights, are\r\nextremely rare in Nature. The light of day, which is the light of wild\r\nanimals, is not concentrated at one point. Insects, when they are in\r\ndarkness--underground, beneath bark or leaves--are accustomed to reach\r\nthe open air, where the light is everywhere diffused, by directing\r\nthemselves towards the luminous point. At night, when they fly towards a\r\nlamp, they are evidently deceived, and their small brains cannot\r\ncomprehend the novelty of this light concentrated at one spot.\r\nConsequently, their fruitless efforts are again and again renewed\r\nagainst the flame, and the poor innocents end by burning themselves.\r\nSeveral domestic insects, which have become little by little adapted to\r\nartificial light in the course of generations, no longer allow\r\nthemselves to be deceived thereby. This is the case with house-flies.\r\n\r\nBees distinguish all colours, and seldom confound any but blue and\r\ngreen; while wasps scarcely react to differences of colour, but note\r\nbetter the shape of an object, and note, for instance, where the place\r\nof honey is; so that a change of colour on the disc whereon the honey is\r\nplaced hardly upsets them. Further, wasps have a better sense of smell\r\nthan bees.\r\n\r\nThe chief discovery regarding the vision of insects made in the last\r\nthirty years is that of Lubbock, who proved that ants perceive the\r\nultra-violet rays of the spectrum, which we are unable, or almost\r\nunable, to perceive.\r\n\r\nIt has lately been proved also that many insects appreciate light by the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThey do not see as clearly as we do; but when they possess\r\nwell-developed compound eyes they appreciate size, and more or less\r\ndistinctly the contours of objects.\r\n\r\nAnts have a great faculty for recognition, which probably testifies to\r\ntheir vision and visual memory. Lubbock observed ants which actually\r\nrecognised each other after more than a year of separation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Smell, Taste, Hearing, Pain_\r\n\r\nSmell is very important in insects. It is difficult for us to judge of,\r\nsince man is of all the vertebrates except the whales, perhaps, the one\r\nin which this sense is most rudimentary. We can evidently, therefore,\r\nform only a feeble idea of the world of knowledge imparted by a smell to\r\na dog, a mole, a hedgehog, or an insect. The instruments of smell are\r\nthe antennæ. A poor ant without antennæ is as lost as a blind man who is\r\nalso deaf and dumb. This appears from its complete social inactivity,\r\nits isolation, its incapacity to guide itself and to find its food. It\r\ncan, therefore, be boldly supposed that the antennæ and their power of\r\nsmell, as much on contact as at a distance, constitute the social sense\r\nof ants, the sense which allows them to recognise one another, to tend\r\nto their larvæ, and mutually help one another, and also the sense which\r\nawakens their greedy appetites, their violent hatred for every being\r\nforeign to the colony, the sense which principally guides them--a little\r\nhelped by vision, especially in certain species--in the long and patient\r\ntravels which they have to undertake, which makes them find their way\r\nback, find their plant-lice, and all their other means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nAs the philosopher Herbert Spencer has well pointed out, the visceral\r\nsensations of man, and those internal senses which, like smell, can only\r\nmake an impression of one kind as regards space--two simultaneous odours\r\ncan only be appreciated by us as a mixture--are precisely those by which\r\nwe can gain little or no information relative to space. Our vision, on\r\nthe contrary, which localises the rays from various distant points of\r\nspace on various distinct points of our retina at the same time, is our\r\nmost relational sense, that which gives us the most vast ideas of space.\r\n\r\nBut the antennæ of insects are an olfactory organ turned inside out,\r\nprominent in space, and, further, very mobile. This allows us to suppose\r\nthat the sense of smell may be much more relational than ours, that the\r\nsensations thence derived give them ideas of space and of direction\r\nwhich may be qualitatively different from ours.\r\n\r\nTaste exists in insects, and has been very widely written on, but\r\nsomewhat inconclusively. The organs of taste probably are to be found in\r\nthe jaws and at the base of the tongue. This sense can be observed in\r\nants, bees, and wasps; and everyone has seen how caterpillars especially\r\nrecognise by taste the plants which suit them.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on the hearing of insects; but, in my judgment,\r\nonly crickets and several other insects of that class appear to perceive\r\nsounds. Erroneous views have been due to confusing hearing with\r\nmechanical vibrations.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that the specialisation of the organ of hearing has\r\nreached in man a delicacy of detail which is evidently not found again\r\nin lower vertebrates.\r\n\r\nPain is much less developed in insects than in warm-blooded vertebrates.\r\nOtherwise, one could not see either an ant, with its abdomen or antennæ\r\ncut off, gorge itself with honey; or a humble-bee, in which the antennæ\r\nand all the front of the head had been removed, go to find and pillage\r\nflowers; or a spider, the foot of which had been broken, feed\r\nimmediately on this, its own foot, as I myself have seen; or, finally, a\r\ncaterpillar, wounded at the \"tail\" end, devour itself, beginning behind,\r\nas I have observed more than once.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--Insect Reason and Passions_\r\n\r\nInsects reason, and the most intelligent among them, the social\r\nhymenoptera, especially the wasps and ants, even reason much more than\r\none is tempted to believe when one observes the regularly recurring\r\nmechanism of their instincts. To observe and understand these\r\nreasonings well, it is necessary to mislead their instinct. Further, one\r\nmay remark little bursts of plastic judgment, of combinations--extremely\r\nlimited, it is true--which, in forcing them an instant from the beaten\r\ntrack of their automatism, help them to overcome difficulties, and to\r\ndecide between two dangers. From the point of view of instinct and\r\nintelligence, or rather of reason, there are not, therefore, absolute\r\ncontrasts between the insect, the mammal, and the man.\r\n\r\nFinally, insects have passions which are more or less bound up with\r\ntheir instincts. And these passions vary enormously, according to the\r\nspecies. I have noted the following passions or traits of character\r\namong ants: choler, hatred, devotion, activity, perseverance, and\r\ngluttony. I have added thereto the discouragement which is sometimes\r\nshown in a striking manner at the time of a defeat, and which can become\r\nreal despair; the fear which is shown among ants when they are alone,\r\nwhile it disappears when they are numerous. I can add further the\r\nmomentary temerity whereby certain ants, knowing the enemy to be\r\nweakened and discouraged, hurl themselves alone in the midst of the\r\nblack masses of enemies larger than themselves, hustling them without\r\ntaking the least further precaution.\r\n\r\nWhen we study the manners of an insect, it is necessary for us to take\r\naccount of its mental faculties as well as of its sense organs.\r\nIntelligent insects make better use of their senses, especially by\r\ncombining them in various ways. It is possible to study such insects in\r\ntheir homes in a more varied and more complete manner, allowing greater\r\naccuracy of observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGALILEO\r\n\r\nDialogues on the System of the World\r\n\r\n     Galileo Galilei, famous as an astronomer and as an experimental\r\n     physicist, was born at Pisa, in Italy, Feb. 18, 1564. His talents\r\n     were most multifarious and remarkable; but his mathematical and\r\n     mechanical genius was dominant from the first. As a child he\r\n     constructed mechanical toys, and as a young man he made one of his\r\n     most important discoveries, which was that of the pendulum as an\r\n     agent in the measurement of time, and invented the hydrostatic\r\n     balance, by which the specific gravity of solid bodies might be\r\n     ascertained. At the age of 24 a learned treatise on the centre of\r\n     gravity of solids led to a lectureship at Pisa University. Driven\r\n     from Pisa by the enmity of Aristotelians, he went to Padua\r\n     University, where he invented a kind of thermometer, a proportional\r\n     compass, a microscope, and a telescope. The last invention bore\r\n     fruit in astronomical discoveries, and in 1610 he discovered four\r\n     of the moons of Jupiter. His promulgation of the Copernican\r\n     doctrine led to renewed attacks by the Aristotelians, and to\r\n     censure by the Inquisition. (See Religion, vol. xiii.)\r\n     Notwithstanding this censure, he published in 1632 his \"Dialogues\r\n     on the System of the World.\" The interlocutors in the \"Dialogues,\"\r\n     with the exception of Salviatus, who expounds the views of the\r\n     author himself, represent two of Galileo's early friends. For the\r\n     \"Dialogues\" he was sentenced by the Inquisition to incarceration at\r\n     its pleasure, and enjoined to recite penitential psalms once a week\r\n     for three years. His life thereafter was full of sorrow, and in\r\n     1637 blindness added to his woes; but the fire of his genius still\r\n     burnt on till his death on January 8, 1642.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Does the Earth Move_\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: Now, let Simplicius propound those doubts which dissuade him\r\nfrom believing that the earth may move, as the other planets, round a\r\nfixed centre.\r\n\r\nSIMPLICIUS: The first and greatest difficulty is that it is impossible\r\nboth to be in a centre and to be far from it. If the earth move in a\r\ncircle it cannot remain in the centre of the zodiac; but Aristotle,\r\nPtolemy and others have proved that it is in the centre of the zodiac.\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: There is no question that the earth cannot be in the centre\r\nof a circle round whose circumference it moves. But tell me what centre\r\ndo you mean?\r\n\r\nSIMPLICIUS: I mean the centre of the universe, of the whole world, of\r\nthe starry sphere.\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: No one has ever proved that the universe is finite and\r\nfigurative; but granting that it is finite and spherical, and has\r\ntherefore a centre, we have still to give reasons why we should believe\r\nthat the earth is at its centre.\r\n\r\nSIMPLICIUS: Aristotle has proved in a hundred ways that the universe is\r\nfinite and spherical.\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: Aristotle's proof that the universe was finite and spherical\r\nwas derived essentially from the consideration that it moved; and seeing\r\nthat centre and figure were inferred by Aristotle from its mobility, it\r\nwill be reasonable if we endeavour to find from the circular motions of\r\nmundane bodies the centre's proper place. Aristotle himself came to the\r\nconclusion that all the celestial spheres revolve round the earth, which\r\nis placed at the centre of the universe. But tell me, Simplicius,\r\nsupposing Aristotle found that one of the two propositions must be\r\nfalse, and that either the celestial spheres do not revolve or that the\r\nearth is not the centre round which they revolve, which proposition\r\nwould he prefer to give up?\r\n\r\nSIMPLICIUS: I believe that the Peripatetics----\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: I do not ask the Peripatetics, I ask Aristotle. As for the\r\nPeripatetics, they, as humble vassals of Aristotle, would deny all the\r\nexperiments and all the observations in the world; nay, would also\r\nrefuse to see them, and would say that the universe is as Aristotle\r\nwriteth, and not as Nature will have it; for, deprived of the shield of\r\nhis authority, with what do you think they would appear in the field?\r\nTell me, therefore, what Aristotle himself would do.\r\n\r\nSIMPLICIUS: To tell you the truth, I do not know how to decide which is\r\nthe lesser inconvenience.\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: Seeing you do not know, let us examine which would be the\r\nmore rational choice, and let us assume that Aristotle would have chosen\r\nso. Granting with Aristotle that the universe has a spherical figure and\r\nmoveth circularly round a centre, it is reasonable to believe that the\r\nstarry orbs move round the centre of the universe or round some separate\r\ncentre?\r\n\r\nSIMPLICIUS: I would say that it were much more reasonable to believe\r\nthat they move with the universe round the centre of the universe.\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: But they move round the sun and not round the earth;\r\ntherefore the sun and not the earth is the centre of the universe.\r\n\r\nSIMPLICIUS: Whence, then, do you argue that it is the sun and not the\r\nearth that is the centre of the planetary revolutions?\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: I infer that the earth is not the centre of the planetary\r\nrevolutions because the planets are at different times at very different\r\ndistances from the earth. For instance, Venus, when it is farthest off,\r\nis six times more remote from us than when it is nearest, and Mars rises\r\nalmost eight times as high at one time as at another.\r\n\r\nSIMPLICIUS: And what are the signs that the planets revolve round the\r\nsun as centre?\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: We find that the three superior planets--Mars, Jupiter, and\r\nSaturn--are always nearest to the earth when they are in opposition to\r\nthe sun, and always farthest off when they are in conjunction; and so\r\ngreat is this approximation and recession that Mars, when near, appears\r\nvery nearly sixty times greater than when remote. Venus and Mercury also\r\ncertainly revolve round the sun, since they never move far from it, and\r\nappear now above and now below it.\r\n\r\nSAGREDUS: I expect that more wonderful things depend on the annual\r\nrevolution than upon the diurnal rotation of the earth.\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: YOU do not err therein. The effect of the diurnal rotation of\r\nthe earth is to make the universe seem to rotate in the opposite\r\ndirection; but the annual motion complicates the particular motions of\r\nall the planets. But to return to my proposition. I affirm that the\r\ncentre of the celestial convolutions of the five planets--Saturn,\r\nJupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, and likewise of the earth--is the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nAs for the moon, it goes round the earth, and yet does not cease to go\r\nround the sun with the earth. It being true, then, that the five planets\r\ndo move about the sun as a centre, rest seems with so much more reason\r\nto belong to the said sun than to the earth, inasmuch as in a movable\r\nsphere it is more reasonable that the centre stand still than any place\r\nremote from the centre.\r\n\r\nTo the earth, therefore, may a yearly revolution be assigned, leaving\r\nthe sun at rest. And if that be so, it follows that the diurnal motion\r\nlikewise belongs to the earth; for if the sun stood still and the earth\r\ndid not rotate, the year would consist of six months of day and six\r\nmonths of night. You may consider, likewise, how, in conformity with\r\nthis scheme, the precipitate motion of twenty-four hours is taken away\r\nfrom the universe; and how the fixed stars, which are so many suns, are\r\nmade, like our sun, to enjoy perpetual rest.\r\n\r\nSAGREDUS: The scheme is simple and satisfactory; but, tell me, how is it\r\nthat Pythagoras and Copernicus, who first brought it forward, could make\r\nso few converts?\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: If you know what frivolous reasons serve to make the vulgar,\r\ncontumacious and indisposed to hearken, you would not wonder at the\r\npaucity of converts. The number of thick skulls is infinite, and we need\r\nneither record their follies nor endeavour to interest them in subtle\r\nand sublime ideas. No demonstrations can enlighten stupid brains.\r\n\r\nMy wonder, Sagredus, is different from yours. You wonder that so few are\r\nbelievers in the Pythagorean hypothesis; I wonder that there are any to\r\nembrace it. Nor can I sufficiently admire the super-eminence of those\r\nmen's wits that have received and held it to be true, and with the\r\nsprightliness of their judgments have offered such violence to their\r\nsenses that they have been able to prefer that which their reason\r\nasserted to that which sensible experience manifested. I cannot find any\r\nbounds for my admiration how that reason was able, in Aristarchus and\r\nCopernicus, to commit such a rape upon their senses, as in despite\r\nthereof to make herself mistress of their credulity.\r\n\r\nSAGREDUS: Will there still be strong opposition to the Copernican\r\nsystem?\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: Undoubtedly; for there are evident and sensible facts to\r\noppose it, requiring a sense more sublime than the common and vulgar\r\nsenses to assist reason.\r\n\r\nSAGREDUS: Let us, then, join battle with those antagonistic facts.\r\n\r\nSALVIATUS: I am ready. In the first place, Mars himself charges hotly\r\nagainst the truth of the Copernican system. According to the Copernican\r\nsystem, that planet should appear sixty times as large when at its\r\nnearest as when at its farthest; but this diversity of magnitude is not\r\nto be seen. The same difficulty is seen in the case of Venus. Further,\r\nif Venus be dark, and shine only with reflected light, like the moon, it\r\nshould show lunar phases; but these do not appear.\r\n\r\nFurther, again, the moon prevents the whole order of the Copernican\r\nsystem by revolving round the earth instead of round the sun. And there\r\nare other serious and curious difficulties admitted by Copernicus\r\nhimself. But even the three great difficulties I have named are not\r\nreal. As a matter of fact, Mars and Venus do vary in magnitude as\r\nrequired by theory, and Venus does change its shape exactly like the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nSAGREDUS: But how came this to be concealed from Copernicus and revealed\r\nto you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR FRANCIS GALTON\r\n\r\nEssays in Eugenics\r\n\r\n     Sir Francis Galton, born at Birmingham, England, in 1822, was a\r\n     grandson of Dr. Erasmus Darwin. He graduated from Trinity College,\r\n     Cambridge, in 1844. Galton travelled in the north of Africa, on the\r\n     White Nile and in the western portion of South Africa between 1844\r\n     and 1850. Like his immortal cousin, Charles Darwin, Sir Francis\r\n     Galton is a striking instance of a man of great and splendid\r\n     inheritance, who, also inheriting wealth, devotes it and his powers\r\n     to the cause of humanity. He published several books on heredity,\r\n     the first of which was \"Hereditary Genius.\" The next \"Inquiries\r\n     into Human Faculty,\" which was followed by \"Natural Inheritance.\"\r\n     The \"Essays in Eugenics\" include all the most recent work of Sir\r\n     Francis Galton since his return to the subject of eugenics in 1901.\r\n     This volume has just been published by the Eugenics Education\r\n     Society, of which Sir Francis Galton is the honorary president. As\r\n     epitomised for this work, the \"Essays\" have been made to include a\r\n     still later study by the author, which will be included in future\r\n     editions of the book. The epitome has been prepared by special\r\n     permission of the Eugenics Education Society, and those responsible\r\n     hope that it will serve in some measure to neutralise the\r\n     outrageous, gross, and often wilful misrepresentations of eugenics\r\n     of which many popular writers are guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--The Aims and Methods of Eugenics_\r\n\r\nThe following essays help to show something of the progress of eugenics\r\nduring the last few years, and to explain my own views upon its aims and\r\nmethods, which often have been, and still sometimes are, absurdly\r\nmisrepresented. The practice of eugenics has already obtained a\r\nconsiderable hold on popular estimation, and is steadily acquiring the\r\nstatus of a practical question, and not that of a mere vision in Utopia.\r\n\r\nThe power by which eugenic reform must chiefly be effected is that of\r\npublic opinion, which is amply strong enough for that purpose whenever\r\nit shall be roused. Public opinion has done as much as this on many past\r\noccasions and in various countries, of which much evidence is given in\r\nthe essay on restrictions in marriage. It is now ordering our acts more\r\nintimately than we are apt to suspect, because the dictates of public\r\nopinion become so thoroughly assimilated that they seem to be the\r\noriginal and individual to those who are guided by them. By comparing\r\nthe current ideas at widely different epochs and under widely different\r\ncivilisations, we are able to ascertain what part of our convictions is\r\nreally innate and permanent, and what part has been acquired and is\r\ntransient.\r\n\r\nIt is, above all things, needful for the successful progress of eugenics\r\nthat its advocates should move discreetly and claim no more efficacy on\r\nits behalf than the future will justify; otherwise a reaction will be\r\njustified. A great deal of investigation is still needed to show the\r\nlimit of practical eugenics, yet enough has been already determined to\r\njustify large efforts being made to instruct the public in an\r\nauthoritative way, with the results hitherto obtained by sound\r\nreasoning, applied to the undoubted facts of social experience.\r\n\r\nThe word \"eugenics\" was coined and used by me in my book \"Human\r\nFaculty,\" published as long ago as 1883. In it I emphasised the\r\nessential brotherhood of mankind, heredity being to my mind a very real\r\nthing; also the belief that we are born to act, and not to wait for help\r\nlike able-bodied idlers, whining for doles. Individuals appear to me as\r\nfinite detachments from an infinite ocean of being, temporarily endowed\r\nwith executive powers. This is the only answer I can give to myself in\r\nreply to the perpetually recurring questions of \"why? whence? and\r\nwhither?\" The immediate \"whither?\" does not seem wholly dark, as some\r\nlittle information may be gleaned concerning the direction in which\r\nNature, so far as we know of it, is now moving--namely, towards the\r\nevolution of mind, body, and character in increasing energy and\r\nco-adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe ideas have long held my fancy that we men may be the chief, and\r\nperhaps the only executives on earth; that we are detached on active\r\nservice with, it may be only illusory, powers of free-will. Also that we\r\nare in some way accountable for our success or failure to further\r\ncertain obscure ends, to be guessed as best we can; that though our\r\ninstructions are obscure they are sufficiently clear to justify our\r\ninterference with the pitiless course of Nature whenever it seems\r\npossible to attain the goal towards which it moves by gentler and\r\nkindlier ways.\r\n\r\nThere are many questions which must be studied if we are to be guided\r\naright towards the possible improvement of mankind under the existing\r\nconditions of law and sentiment. We must study human variety, and the\r\ndistribution of qualities in a nation. We must compare the\r\nclassification of a population according to social status with the\r\nclassification which we would make purely in terms of natural quality.\r\nWe must study with the utmost care the descent of qualities in a\r\npopulation, and the consequences of that marked tendency to marriage\r\nwithin the class which distinguishes all classes. Something is to be\r\nlearnt from the results of examinations in universities and colleges.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to study the degree of correspondence that may exist\r\nbetween promise in youth, as shown in examinations, and subsequent\r\nperformance. Let me add that I think the neglect of this inquiry by the\r\nvast army of highly educated persons who are connected with the present\r\nhuge system of competitive examination to be gross and unpardonable.\r\nUntil this problem is solved we cannot possibly estimate the value of\r\nthe present elaborate system of examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Restrictions in Marriage_\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to meet an objection that has been repeatedly urged\r\nagainst the possible adoption of any system of eugenics, namely, that\r\nhuman nature would never brook interference with the freedom of\r\nmarriage. But the question is how far have marriage restrictions proved\r\neffective when sanctified by the religion of the time, by custom, and by\r\nlaw. I appeal from armchair criticism to historical facts. It will be\r\nfound that, with scant exceptions, marriage customs are based on social\r\nexpediency and not on natural instincts. This we learn when we study the\r\nfact of monogamy, and the severe prohibition of polygamy, in many times\r\nand places, due not to any natural instinct against the practice, but to\r\nconsideration of the social well-being. We find the same when we study\r\nendogamy, exogamy, Australian marriages, and the control of marriage by\r\ntaboo.\r\n\r\nThe institution of marriage, as now sanctified by religion and\r\nsafeguarded by law in the more highly civilised nations, may not be\r\nideally perfect, nor may it be universally accepted in future times, but\r\nit is the best that has hitherto been devised for the parties primarily\r\nconcerned, for their children, for home life, and for society. The\r\ndegree of kinship within which marriage is prohibited is, with one\r\nexception, quite in accordance with modern sentiment, the exception\r\nbeing the disallowal of marriage with the sister of a deceased wife, the\r\npropriety of which is greatly disputed and need not be discussed here.\r\nThe marriage of a brother and sister would excite a feeling of loathing\r\namong us that seems implanted by nature, but which, further inquiry will\r\nshow, has mainly arisen from tradition and custom.\r\n\r\nThe evidence proves that there is no instinctive repugnance felt\r\nuniversally by man to marriage within the prohibited degrees, but that\r\nits present strength is mainly due to what I may call immaterial\r\nconsiderations. It is quite conceivable that a non-eugenic marriage\r\nshould hereafter excite no less loathing than that of a brother and\r\nsister would do now.\r\n\r\nThe dictates of religion in respect to the opposite duties of leading\r\ncelibate lives, and of continuing families, have been contradictory. In\r\nmany nations it is and has been considered a disgrace to bear no\r\nchildren, and in other nations celibacy has been raised to the rank of a\r\nvirtue of the highest order. During the fifty or so generations that\r\nhave elapsed since the establishment of Christianity, the nunneries and\r\nmonasteries, and the celibate lives of Catholic priests, have had vast\r\nsocial effects, how far for good and how far for evil need not be\r\ndiscussed here. The point I wish to enforce is the potency, not only of\r\nthe religious sense in aiding or deterring marriage, but more especially\r\nthe influence and authority of ministers of religion in enforcing\r\ncelibacy. They have notoriously used it when aid has been invoked by\r\nmembers of the family on grounds that are not religious at all, but\r\nmerely of family expediency. Thus at some times and in some Christian\r\nnations, every girl who did not marry while still young was practically\r\ncompelled to enter a nunnery, from which escape was afterwards\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to let the imagination run wild on the supposition of a\r\nwhole-hearted acceptance of eugenics as a national religion; that is, of\r\nthe thorough conviction by a nation that no worthier object exists for\r\nman than the improvement of his own race, and when efforts as great as\r\nthose by which nunneries and monasteries were endowed and maintained\r\nshould be directed to fulfil an opposite purpose. I will not enter\r\nfurther into this. Suffice it to say, that the history of conventual\r\nlife affords abundant evidence on a very large scale of the power of\r\nreligious authority in directing and withstanding the tendencies of\r\nhuman nature towards freedom in marriage.\r\n\r\nSeven different forms of marriage restriction may be cited to show what\r\nis possible. They are monogamy, endogamy, exogamy, Australian marriages,\r\ntaboo, prohibited degrees, and celibacy. It can be shown under each of\r\nthese heads how powerful are the various combinations of immaterial\r\nmotives upon marriage selection, how they may all become hallowed by\r\nreligion, accepted as custom, and enforced by law. Persons who are born\r\nunder their various rules live under them without any objection. They\r\nare unconscious of their restrictions, as we are unaware of the tension\r\nof the atmosphere. The subservience of civilised races to their several\r\nreligious superstitions, customs, authority, and the rest, is frequently\r\nas abject as that of barbarians.\r\n\r\nThe same classes of motives that direct other races direct ours; so a\r\nknowledge of their customs helps us to realise the wide range of what we\r\nmay ourselves hereafter adopt, for reasons as satisfactory to us in\r\nthose future times, as theirs are or were to them at the time when they\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Eugenic Qualities of Primary Importance_\r\n\r\nThe following is offered as a contribution to the art of justly\r\nappraising the eugenic values of different qualities. It may fairly be\r\nassumed that the presence of certain inborn traits is requisite before a\r\nclaim to eugenic rank can be justified, because these qualities are\r\nneeded to bring out the full values of such special faculties as broadly\r\ndistinguish philosophers, artists, financiers, soldiers, and other\r\nrepresentative classes. The method adopted for discovering the qualities\r\nin question is to consider groups of individuals, and to compare the\r\nqualities that distinguish such groups as flourish or prosper from\r\nothers of the same kind that decline or decay. This method has the\r\nadvantage of giving results more free from the possibility of bias than\r\nthose derived from examples of individual cases.\r\n\r\nIn what follows I shall use the word \"community\" in its widest sense,\r\nas including any group of persons who are connected by a common\r\ninterest--families, schools, clubs, sects, municipalities, nations, and\r\nall intermediate social units. Whatever qualities increase the\r\nprosperity of most or every one of these, will, as I hold, deserve a\r\nplace in the first rank of eugenic importance.\r\n\r\nMost of us have experience, either by direct observation or through\r\nhistorical reading, of the working of several communities, and are\r\ncapable of forming a correct picture in our minds of the salient\r\ncharacteristics of those that, on the one hand, are eminently\r\nprosperous, and of those that, on the other hand, are as eminently\r\ndecadent. I have little doubt that the reader will agree with me that\r\nthe members of prospering communities are, as a rule, conspicuously\r\nstrenuous, and that those of decaying or decadent ones are conspicuously\r\nslack. A prosperous community is distinguished by the alertness of its\r\nmembers, by their busy occupations, by their taking pleasure in their\r\nwork, by their doing it thoroughly, and by an honest pride in their\r\ncommunity as a whole. The members of a decaying community are, for the\r\nmost part, languid and indolent; their very gestures are dawdling and\r\nslouching, the opposite of smart. They shirk work when they can do so,\r\nand scamp what they undertake. A prosperous community is remarkable for\r\nthe variety of the solid interests in which some or other of its members\r\nare eagerly engaged, but the questions that agitate a decadent community\r\nare for the most part of a frivolous order.\r\n\r\nProsperous communities are also notable for enjoyment of life; for\r\nthough their members must work hard in order to procure the necessary\r\nluxuries of an advanced civilisation, they are endowed with so large a\r\nstore of energy that, when their daily toil is over, enough of it\r\nremains unexpended to allow them to pursue their special hobbies during\r\nthe remainder of the day. In a decadent community the men tire easily,\r\nand soon sink into drudgery; there is consequently much languor among\r\nthem, and little enjoyment of life.\r\n\r\nI have studied the causes of civic prosperity in various directions and\r\nfrom many points of view, and the conclusion at which I have arrived is\r\nemphatic, namely, that chief among those causes is a large capacity for\r\nlabour--mental, bodily, or both--combined with eagerness for work. The\r\ncourse of evolution in animals shows that this view is correct in\r\ngeneral. The huge lizards, incapable of rapid action, unless it be brief\r\nin duration and associated with long terms of repose, have been\r\nsupplanted by birds and mammals possessed of powers of long endurance.\r\nThese latter are so constituted as to require work, becoming restless\r\nand suffering in health when precluded from exertion.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, overlook the fact that the influence of\r\ncircumstance on a community is a powerful factor in raising its tone. A\r\ncause that catches the popular feeling will often rouse a potentially\r\ncapable nation from apathy into action. A good officer, backed by\r\nadequate supplies of food and with funds for the regular payment of his\r\ntroops, will change a regiment even of ill-developed louts and hooligans\r\ninto a fairly smart and well-disciplined corps. But with better material\r\nas a foundation, the influence of a favourable environment is\r\ncorrespondingly increased, and is less liable to impairment whenever the\r\nenvironment changes and becomes less propitious. Hence, it follows that\r\na sound mind and body, enlightened, I should add, with an intelligence\r\nabove the average, and combined with a natural capacity and zeal for\r\nwork, are essential elements in eugenics. For however famous a man may\r\nbecome in other respects, he cannot, I think, be justly termed eugenic\r\nif deficient in the qualities I have just named.\r\n\r\nEugenists justly claim to be true philanthropists, or lovers of mankind,\r\nand should bestir themselves in their special province as eagerly as\r\nthe philanthropists, in the current and very restricted meaning of that\r\nword, have done in theirs. They should interest themselves in such\r\nfamilies of civic worth as they come across, especially in those that\r\nare large, making friends both with the parents and the children, and\r\nshowing themselves disposed to help to a reasonable degree, as\r\nopportunity may offer, whenever help is really needful. They should\r\ncompare their own notes with those of others who are similarly engaged.\r\nThey should regard such families as an eager horticulturist regards beds\r\nof seedlings of some rare variety of plant, but with an enthusiasm of a\r\nfar more patriotic kind. For, since it has been shown that about 10 per\r\ncent. of the individuals born in one generation provide half the next\r\ngeneration, large families that are also eugenic may prove of primary\r\nimportance to the nation and become its most valuable asset.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--Practical Eugenics_\r\n\r\nThe following are some views of my own relating to that large province\r\nof eugenics which is concerned with favouring the families of those who\r\nare exceptionally fit for citizenship. Consequently, little or nothing\r\nwill here be said relating to what has been well termed by Dr. Saleeby\r\n\"negative\" eugenics, namely, the hindrance of the marriages and the\r\nproduction of offspring by the exceptionally unfit. The latter is\r\nunquestionably the more pressing subject, but it will soon be forced on\r\nthe attention of the legislature by the recent report of the Royal\r\nCommission on the Feeble-minded.\r\n\r\nWhatever scheme of action is proposed for adoption must be neither\r\nUtopian nor extravagant, but accordant throughout with British sentiment\r\nand practice.\r\n\r\nBy \"worth\" I mean the civic worthiness, or the value to the state, of a\r\nperson. Speaking only for myself, if I had to classify persons according\r\nto worth, I should consider each of them under the three heads of\r\nphysique, ability and character, subject to the provision that\r\ninferiority in any one of the three should outweigh superiority in the\r\nother two. I rank physique first, because it is not only very valuable\r\nin itself and allied to many other good qualities, but has the\r\nadditional merit of being easily rated. Ability I place second on\r\nsimilar grounds, and character third, though in real importance it\r\nstands first of all.\r\n\r\nThe power of social opinion is apt to be underrated rather than\r\noverrated. Like the atmosphere which we breathe and in which we move,\r\nsocial opinion operates powerfully without our being conscious of its\r\nweight. Everyone knows that governments, manners, and beliefs which were\r\nthought to be right, decorous, and true at one period have been judged\r\nwrong, indecorous, and false at another; and that views which we have\r\nheard expressed by those in authority over us in early life tend to\r\nbecome axiomatic and unchangeable in mature life.\r\n\r\nIn circumscribed communities especially, social approval and disapproval\r\nexert a potent force. Is it, then, I ask, too much to expect that when a\r\npublic opinion in favour of eugenics has once taken sure hold of such\r\ncommunities, the result will be manifested in sundry and very effective\r\nmodes of action which are as yet untried?\r\n\r\nSpeaking for myself only, I look forward to local eugenic action in\r\nnumerous directions, of which I will now specify one. It is the\r\naccumulation of considerable funds to start young couples of \"worthy\"\r\nqualities in their married life, and to assist them and their families\r\nat critical times. The charitable gifts to those who are the reverse of\r\n\"worthy\" are enormous in amount. I am not prepared to say how much of\r\nthis is judiciously spent, or in what ways, but merely quote the fact to\r\njustify the inference that many persons who are willing to give freely\r\nat the prompting of a sentiment based upon compassion might be\r\npersuaded to give largely also in response to the more virile desire of\r\npromoting the natural gifts and the national efficiency of future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_V.--Eugenics as a Factor in Religion_\r\n\r\nEugenics strengthen the sense of social duty in so many important\r\nparticulars that the conclusions derived from its study ought to find a\r\nwelcome home in every tolerant religion. It promotes a far-sighted\r\nphilanthropy, the acceptance of parentage as a serious responsibility,\r\nand a higher conception of patriotism. The creed of eugenics is founded\r\nupon the idea of evolution; not on a passive form of it, but on one that\r\ncan, to some extent, direct its own course.\r\n\r\nPurely passive, or what may be styled mechanical evolution displays the\r\nawe-inspiring spectacle of a vast eddy of organic turmoil, originating\r\nwe know not how, and travelling we know not whither. It forms a\r\ncontinuous whole, but it is moulded by blind and wasteful\r\nprocesses--namely, by an extravagant production of raw material and the\r\nruthless rejection of all that is superfluous, through the blundering\r\nsteps of trial and error.\r\n\r\nThe condition at each successive moment of this huge system, as it\r\nissues from the already quiet past and is about to invade the still\r\nundisturbed future, is one of violent internal commotion. Its elements\r\nare in constant flux and change.\r\n\r\nEvolution is in any case a grand phantasmagoria, but it assumes an\r\ninfinitely more interesting aspect under the knowledge that the\r\nintelligent action of the human will is, in some small measure, capable\r\nof guiding its course. Man has the power of doing this largely so far as\r\nthe evolution of humanity is concerned; he has already affected the\r\nquality and distribution of organic life so widely that the changes on\r\nthe surface of the earth, merely through his disforestings and\r\nagriculture, would be recognisable from a distance as great as that of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\nAs regards the practical side of eugenics, we need not linger to reopen\r\nthe unending argument whether man possesses any creative power of will\r\nat all, or whether his will is not also predetermined by blind forces or\r\nby intelligent agencies behind the veil, and whether the belief that man\r\ncan act independently is more than a mere illusion.\r\n\r\nEugenic belief extends the function of philanthropy to future\r\ngenerations; it renders its action more pervading than hitherto, by\r\ndealing with families and societies in their entirety, and it enforces\r\nthe importance of the marriage covenant by directing serious attention\r\nto the probable quality of the future offspring. It sternly forbids all\r\nforms of sentimental charity that are harmful to the race, while it\r\neagerly seeks opportunity for acts of personal kindness. It strongly\r\nencourages love and interest in family and race. In brief, eugenics is a\r\nvirile creed, full of hopefulness, and appealing to many of the noblest\r\nfeelings of our nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERNST HAECKEL\r\n\r\nThe Evolution of Man\r\n\r\n     Ernst Haeckel, who was born in Potsdam, Germany, Feb. 16, 1834,\r\n     descends from a long line of lawyers and politicians. To his\r\n     father's annoyance, he turned to science, and graduated in\r\n     medicine. After a long tour in Italy in 1859, during which he\r\n     wavered between art and science, he decided for zoology, and made a\r\n     masterly study of a little-known group of sea-animalcules, the\r\n     Radiolaria. In 1861 he began to teach zoology at Jena University.\r\n     Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" had just been translated into German,\r\n     and he took up the defence of Darwinism against almost the whole of\r\n     his colleagues. His first large work on evolution, \"General\r\n     Morphology,\" was published in 1866. He has since published\r\n     forty-two distinct works. He is not only a master of zoology, but\r\n     has a good command of botany and embryology. Haeckel's \"Evolution\r\n     of Man\" (Anthropogenie), is generally accepted as being his most\r\n     important production. Published in 1874, at a time when the theory\r\n     of natural evolution had few supporters in Germany, the work was\r\n     hailed with a storm of controversy, one celebrated critic declaring\r\n     that it was a blot on the escutcheon of Germany. From the hands of\r\n     English scientists, however, the treatise received a warm welcome.\r\n     Darwin said he would probably never have written his \"Descent of\r\n     Man\" had Haeckel published his work earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--The Science of Man_\r\n\r\nThe natural history of mankind, or anthropology, must always excite the\r\nmost lively interest, and no part of the science is more attractive than\r\nthat which deals with the question of man's origin. In order to study\r\nthis with full profit, we must combine the results of two sciences,\r\nontogeny (or embryology) and phylogeny (the science of evolution). We do\r\nthis because we have now discovered that the forms through which the\r\nembryo passes in its development correspond roughly to the series of\r\nforms in its ancestral development. The correspondence is by no means\r\ncomplete or precise, since the embryonic life itself has been modified\r\nin the course of time; but the general law is now very widely accepted.\r\nI have called it \"the biogenetic law,\" and will constantly appeal to it\r\nin the course of this study.\r\n\r\nIt is only in recent times that the two sciences have advanced\r\nsufficiently to reveal the correspondence of the two series of forms.\r\nAristotle provided a good foundation for embryology, and made some\r\ninteresting discoveries, but no progress was made in the science for\r\n2,000 years after him. Then the Reformation brought some liberty of\r\nresearch, and in the seventeenth century several works were written on\r\nembryology.\r\n\r\nFor more than a hundred years the science was still hampered by the lack\r\nof good microscopes. It was generally believed that all the organs of\r\nthe body existed, packed in a tiny point of space, in the germ. About\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, Caspar Friedrich Wolff discovered\r\nthe true development; but his work was ignored, and it was only fifty\r\nyears later that modern embryology began to work on the right line. K.E.\r\nvon Baer made it clear that the fertilised ovum divides into a group of\r\ncells, and that the various organs of the body are developed from these\r\nlayers of cells, in the way I shall presently describe.\r\n\r\nThe science of phylogeny, or, as it is popularly called, the evolution\r\nof species, had an equally slow growth. On the ground of the Mosaic\r\nnarrative, no less than in view of the actual appearance of the living\r\nworld, the great naturalist Linné (1735) set up the dogma of the\r\nunchangeability of species. Even when quite different remains of animals\r\nwere discovered by the advancing science of geology, they were forced\r\ninto the existing narrow framework of science by Cuvier. Sir Charles\r\nLyell completely undid the fallacious work of Cuvier, but in the\r\nmeantime the zoologists themselves were moving toward the doctrine of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nJean Lamarck made the first systematic attempt to expound the theory in\r\nhis \"Zoological Philosophy\" (1809). He suggested that animals modified\r\ntheir organs by use or disuse, and that the effect of this was\r\ninherited. In the course of time these inherited modifications reached\r\nsuch a pitch that the organism fell into a new \"species.\" Goethe also\r\nmade some remarkable contributions to the science of evolution. But it\r\nwas reserved for Charles Darwin to win an enduring place in science for\r\nthe theory. \"The Origin of Species\" (1859) not only sustained it with a\r\nwealth of positive knowledge which Lamarck did not command, but it\r\nprovided a more luminous explanation in the doctrine of natural\r\nselection. Huxley (1863) followed with an application of the law to man,\r\nand in 1866 I gave a comprehensive sketch of its application throughout\r\nthe whole animal world. In 1874 I published the first edition of the\r\npresent work.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of evolution is now a vital part of biology, and we might\r\naccept the evolution of man as a special deduction from the general law.\r\nThree great groups of evidence impose that law on us. The first group\r\nconsists of the facts of palæontology, or the fossil record of past\r\nanimal life. Imperfect as the record is, it shows us a broad divergence\r\nof successively changing types from a simple common root, and in some\r\ncases exhibits the complete transition from one type to another. The\r\nnext document is the evidence of comparative anatomy. This science\r\ngroups the forms of living animals in such a way that we seem to have\r\nthe same gradual divergence of types from simple common ancestors. In\r\nparticular, it discovers certain rudimentary organs in the higher\r\nanimals, which can only be understood as the shrunken relics of organs\r\nthat were once useful to a remote ancestor. Thus, man has still the\r\nrudiment of the third eyelid of his shark-ancestor. The third document\r\nis the evidence of embryology, which shows us the higher organism\r\nsubstantially reproducing, in its embryonic development, the long\r\nseries of ancestral forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Man's Embryonic Development_\r\n\r\nThe first stage in the development of any animal is the tiny speck of\r\nplasm, hardly visible to the naked eye, which we call the ovum, or\r\negg-cell. It is a single cell, recalling the earliest single-celled\r\nancestor of all animals. In its immature form it is not unlike certain\r\nmicroscopic animalcules known as _amoeboe_. In its mature form it is\r\nabout 1/125th of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nWhen the male germ has blended with the female in the ovum, the new cell\r\nslowly divides into two, with a very complicated division of the\r\nmaterial composing its nucleus. The two cells divide into four, the four\r\ninto eight, and so on until we have a round cluster of cells, something\r\nlike a blackberry in shape.\r\n\r\nThis _morula_, as I have called it, reproduces the next stage in the\r\ndevelopment of life. As all animals pass through it, our biogenetic law\r\nforces us to see in it an ancestral stage; and in point of fact we have\r\nanimals of this type living in Nature to-day. The round cluster becomes\r\nfilled with fluid, and we have a hollow sphere of cells, which I call\r\nthe _blastula_. The corresponding early ancestor I name the _Blastæa_,\r\nand again we find examples of it, like the _Volvox_ of the ponds, in\r\nNature to-day.\r\n\r\nThe next step is very important. The hollow sphere closes in on itself,\r\nas when an india rubber ball is pressed into the form of a cup. We have\r\nthen a vase-shaped body with two layers of cells, an inner and an outer,\r\nand an opening. The inner layer we call the entoderm, the outer the\r\nectoderm; and the \"primitive mouth\" is known as the blastopore. In the\r\nhigher animals a good deal of food-yolk is stored up in the germ, and so\r\nthe vase-shaped structure has been flattened and altered. It has,\r\nhowever, been shown that all embryos pass through this stage\r\n(gastrulation), and we again infer the existence of a common ancestor of\r\nthat type--the _Gastræa_. The lowest group of many-celled animals--the\r\ncorals, jelly-fishes, and anemones--are essentially of that structure.\r\n\r\nThe embryo now consists of two layers of cells, the \"germ-layers,\" an\r\ninner and outer. As the higher embryo develops, a third layer of cells\r\nnow pushes between the two. We may say, broadly, that from this middle\r\nlayer are developed most of the animal organs of the body; from the\r\ninternal germ-layer is developed the lining of the alimentary canal and\r\nits dependent glands; from the outer layer are formed the skin and the\r\nnervous system--which developed originally in the skin.\r\n\r\nThe embryo of man and all the other higher animals now develops a\r\ncavity, a pair of pouches, by the folding of the layer at the primitive\r\nmouth. Sir E. Ray Lankester, and Professor Balfour, and other students,\r\ntraced this formation through the whole embryonic world, and we are\r\ntherefore again obliged to see in it a reminiscence of an ancestral\r\nform--a primitive worm-like animal, of a type we shall see later. The\r\nnext step is the formation of the first trace of what will ultimately be\r\nthe backbone. It consists at first of a membraneous tube, formed by the\r\nfolding of the inner layer along the axis of the embryo-body. Later this\r\ntube will become cartilage, and in the higher animals the cartilage will\r\ngive place to bone.\r\n\r\nThe other organs of the body now gradually form from the germ-layers,\r\nprincipally by the folding of the layers into tubes. A light area\r\nappears on the surface of the germ. A streak or groove forms along its\r\naxis, and becomes the nerve-cord running along the back. Cube-shaped\r\nstructures make their appearance on either side of it; these prove to be\r\nthe rudiments of the vertebræ--or separate bones of the backbone--and\r\ngradually close round the cord. The heart is at first merely a\r\nspindle-shaped enlargement of the main ventral blood-vessel. The nose is\r\nat first only a pair of depressions in the skin above the mouth.\r\n\r\nWhen the human embryo is only a quarter of an inch in length, it has\r\ngill-clefts and gill-arches in the throat like a fish, and no limbs. The\r\nheart--as yet with only the simple two-chambered structure of a fish's\r\nheart--is up in the throat--as in the fish--and the principal arteries\r\nrun to the gill-slits. These structures never have any utility in man or\r\nthe other land-animals, though the embryo always has them for a time.\r\nThey point clearly to a fish ancestor.\r\n\r\nLater, they break up, the limbs sprout out like blunt fins at the sides,\r\nand the long tail begins to decrease. By the twelfth week the human\r\nframe is perfectly formed, though less than two inches long. Last of\r\nall, it retains its resemblance to the ape. In the embryonic apparatus,\r\ntoo, man closely resembles the higher ape.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Our Ancestral Tree_\r\n\r\nThe series of forms which we thus trace in man's embryonic development\r\ncorresponds to the ancestral series which we would assign to man on the\r\nevidence of palæontology and comparative anatomy. At one time, the\r\ntracing of this ancestral series encountered a very serious check. When\r\nwe examined the groups of living animals, we found none that illustrated\r\nor explained the passage from the non-backboned--invertebrate--to the\r\nbackboned--vertebrate--animals. This gap was filled some years ago by\r\nthe discovery of the lancelet--_Amphioxus_--and the young of the\r\nsea-squirt--_Ascidia_. The lancelet has a slender rod of cartilage along\r\nits back, and corresponds very closely with the ideal I have sketched of\r\nour primitive backboned ancestor. It may be an offshoot from the same\r\ngroup. The sea-squirt further illustrates the origin of the backbone,\r\nsince it has a similar rod of cartilage in its youth, and loses it, by\r\ndegeneration, in its maturity.\r\n\r\nIn this way the chief difficulty was overcome, and it was possible to\r\nsketch the probable series of our ancestors. It must be well understood\r\nthat not only is the whole series conjectural, but no living animal must\r\nbe regarded as an ancestral form. The parental types have long been\r\nextinct, and we may, at the most, use very conservative living types to\r\nillustrate their nature, just as, in the matter of languages, German is\r\nnot the parent, but the cousin of Anglo-Saxon, or Greek of Latin. The\r\noriginal parental languages are lost. But a language like Sanscrit\r\nsurvives to give us a good idea of the type.\r\n\r\nThe law of evolution is based on such a mass of evidence that we may\r\njustly draw deductions from it, where the direct evidence is incomplete.\r\nThis is especially necessary in the early part of our ancestral tree,\r\nbecause the fossil record quite fails us. For millions of years the\r\nearly soft-bodied animals left no trace in the primitive mud, which time\r\nhas hardened into rocks, and we are restricted to the evidence of\r\nembryology and of comparative zoology. This suffices to give us a\r\ngeneral idea of the line of development.\r\n\r\nIn nature to-day, one of the lowest animal forms is a tiny speck of\r\nliving plasm called the _amoeba_. We have still more elementary forms,\r\nsuch as the minute particles which make up the bluish film on damp\r\nrocks, but they are of a vegetal character, or below it. They give us\r\nsome idea of the very earliest forms of life; minute living particles,\r\nwith no organs, down to the ten-thousandth part of an inch in diameter.\r\nThe amoeba represents the lowest animal, and, as we saw, the ovum in\r\nmany cases resembles an amoeba. We therefore take some such one-celled\r\ncreature as our first animal ancestor. Taking food in at all parts of\r\nits surface, having no permanent organs of locomotion, and reproducing\r\nby merely splitting into two, it exhibits the lowest level of animal\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe next step in development would be the clustering together of these\r\nprimitive microbes as they divided. This is actually the stage that\r\ncomes next in the development of the germ, and it is the next stage\r\nupward in the existing animal world. We assume that these clusters of\r\nmicrobes--or cells, as we will now call them--bent inward, as we saw the\r\nembryo do, and became two-layered, cup-shaped organisms, with a hollow\r\ninterior (primitive stomach) and an aperture (primitive mouth). The\r\ninner cells now do the work of digestion alone; the outer cells effect\r\nlocomotion, by means of lashes like oars, and are sensitive. This is, in\r\nthe main, the structure of the next great group of animals, the hydra,\r\ncoral, meduca, and anemone. They have remained at this level, though\r\nthey have developed, special organs for stinging their prey and bringing\r\nthe food into their mouths.\r\n\r\nBoth zoology and the appearance of the embryo point to a worm-like\r\nanimal as the next stage. Constant swimming in the water would give the\r\nanimal a definite head, with special groups of nerve-cells, a definite\r\ntail, and a two-sided or evenly-balanced body.\r\n\r\nWe mean that those animals would be fittest to live, and multiply most,\r\nwhich developed this organisation. Sense-organs would now appear in the\r\nhead, in the form of simple depressions, lined with sensitive cells, as\r\nthey do in the embryo; and a clump of nerve-cells within would represent\r\nthe primitive brain. In the vast and varied worm-group we find\r\nillustrations of nearly every step in this process of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe highest type of worm-like creature, the acorn-headed\r\nworm--_Balanoglossus_--takes us an important step further. It has\r\ngill-openings for breathing, and a cord of cartilage down its back. We\r\nsaw that the human embryo has a gill-apparatus, and that, comparing the\r\nlancelet and the sea-squirt, the backbone must have begun as a string of\r\ncartilage-cells. We are now on firmer ground, for there is no doubt that\r\nall the higher land-animals come from a fish ancestor. The shark, one of\r\nthe most primitive of fishes in organisation, probably best suggests\r\nthis ancestor to us. In fact, in the embryonic development of the human\r\nface there is a clear suggestion of the shark.\r\n\r\nUp to this period the story of evolution had run its course in the sea.\r\nThe area of dry land was now increasing, and certain of the primitive\r\nfishes adapted themselves to living on land. They walked on their fins,\r\nand used their floating-bladders--large air-bladders in the fish, for\r\nrising in the water--to breathe air. We not only have fishes of this\r\ntype in Australia to-day, but we have the fossil remains of similar\r\nfishes in the Old Red Sandstone rocks. From mud-fish the amphibian would\r\nnaturally develop, as it did in the coal-forest period. Walking on the\r\nfins would strengthen the main stem, the broad paddle would become\r\nuseless, and we should get in time the bony five-toed limb. We have many\r\nof these giant salamander forms in the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe reptile now evolved from the amphibian, and a vast reptile\r\npopulation spread over the earth. From one of these early reptiles the\r\nbirds were evolved. Geology furnishes the missing link between the bird\r\nand the reptile in the _Archæopteryx_, a bird with teeth, claws on its\r\nwings, and a reptilian tail. From another primitive reptile the\r\nimportant group of the mammals was evolved. We find what seem to be the\r\ntransitional types in the rocks of South Africa. The scales gave way to\r\ntufts of hair, the heart evolved a fourth chamber, and thus supplied\r\npurer blood (warm blood), the brain profited by the richer food, and the\r\nmother began to suckle the young. We have still a primitive mammal of\r\nthis type in the duck-mole, or duck-billed platypus (_Ornithorhyncus_)\r\nof Australia. There are grounds for thinking that the next stage was an\r\nopossum-like animal, and this led on to the lowest ape-like being, the\r\nlemur. Judging from the fossil remains, the black lemur of Madagascar\r\nbest suggests this ancestor.\r\n\r\nThe apes of the Old and New Worlds now diverged from this level, and\r\nsome branch of the former gave rise to the man-like apes and man. In\r\nbodily structure and embryonic development the large apes come very\r\nclose to man, and two recent discoveries have put their\r\nblood-relationship beyond question. One is that experiments in the\r\ntransfusion of blood show that the blood of the man-like ape and man\r\nhave the same action on the blood of lower animals. The other is that we\r\nhave discovered, in Java, several bones of a being which stands just\r\nmidway between the highest living ape and lowest living race of men.\r\nThis ape-man (_Pithecanthropus_) represents the last of our animal and\r\nfirst of our human ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--Evolution of Separate Organs_\r\n\r\nSo far, we have seen how the human body as a whole develops through a\r\nlong series of extinct ancestors. We may now take the various systems of\r\norgans one by one, and, if we are careful to consult embryology as well\r\nas zoology, we can trace the manner of their development. It is, in\r\naccordance with our biogenetic law, the same in the embryo, as a rule,\r\nas in the story of past evolution.\r\n\r\nWe take first the nervous system. In the lowest animals, as in the early\r\nstages of the embryo, there are no nerve-cells. In the embryo the\r\nnerve-cells develop from the outer, or skin layer, of cells. This,\r\nthough strange as regards the human nervous system, is a correct\r\npreservation of the primitive seat of the nerves. It was the surface of\r\nthe animal that needed to be sensitive in the primitive organism. Later,\r\nwhen definite connecting nerves were formed, only special points in the\r\nsurface, protected by coverings which did not interfere with the\r\nsensitiveness, needed to be exposed, and the nerves transmitted the\r\nimpressions to the central brain.\r\n\r\nThis development is found in the animal world to-day. In such animals as\r\nthe hydra we find the first crude beginning of unorganised nerve-cells.\r\nIn the jelly-fish we find nerve-cells clustered into definite sensitive\r\norgans. In the lower worms we have the beginning of organs of smell and\r\nvision. They are at first merely blind, sensitive pits in the skin, as\r\nin the embryo. The ear has a peculiar origin. Up to the fish level there\r\nis no power of hearing. There is merely a little stone rolling in a\r\nsensitive bed, to warn the animal of its movement from side to side. In\r\nthe higher animals this evolves into the ear.\r\n\r\nThe glands of the skin (sweat, fat, tears, etc.) appear at first as\r\nblunt, simple ingrowths. The hair first appears in tufts, representing\r\nthe scales, from underneath which they were probably evolved. The thin\r\ncoat of hair on the human body to-day is an ancestral inheritance. This\r\nis well shown by the direction of the hairs on the arm. As on the ape's\r\narm, both on the upper and lower arm, they grow toward the elbow. The\r\nape finds this useful in rain, using his arms like a thatched roof, and\r\non our arm this can only be a reminiscence of the habits of an ape\r\nancestor.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the spinal cord first appears as a tube in the axis of\r\nthe back, and the cartilaginous column closes round it. All bone appears\r\nfirst as membrane, then cartilage, and finally ossifies. This is the\r\norder both in past evolution and in present embryonic development. The\r\nbrain is at first a bulbous expansion of the spinal nerve-cord. It is at\r\nfirst simple, but gradually, both in the scale of nature and in the\r\nembryo, divides into five parts. One of these parts, the cerebrum, is\r\nmainly connected with mental life. We find it increasing in size, in\r\nproportion to the animal's intelligence, until in man it comes to cover\r\nthe whole of the brain. When we remove it from the head of the mammal,\r\nwithout killing the animal, we find all mental life suspended, and the\r\nwhole vitality used in vegetative functions.\r\n\r\nIn the evolution of the bony system we find the same correspondence of\r\nembryology and evolution. The main column is at first a rod of\r\ncartilage. In time the separate cubes appear which are to form the\r\nvertebræ of the flexible column. The skull develops in the same way.\r\nJust as the brain is a specially modified part of the nerve-rod, the\r\nskull is only a modified part of the vertebral column. The bones that\r\ncompose it are modified vertebræ, as Goethe long ago suspected. The\r\nskull of the shark gives us a hint of the way in which the modification\r\ntook place, and the formation of the skull in the embryo confirms it.\r\n\r\nThat adult man is devoid of that prolongation of the vertebral column\r\nwhich we call a tail is not a distinctive peculiarity. The higher apes\r\nare equally without it. We find, however, that the human embryo has a\r\nlong tail, much longer than the legs, when they are developing. At\r\ntimes, moreover, children are born with tails--perfect tails, with\r\nnerves and muscles, which they move briskly under emotion, and these\r\nhave to be amputated. The development of the limb from the fin offers no\r\nserious difficulty to the osteologist. All the higher animals descend\r\nfrom a five-toed ancestor. The whale has taken again to the water, and\r\nreconverted its limb into a paddle. The bones of the front feet still\r\nremain under the flesh. Animals of the horse type have had the central\r\ntoe strengthened, for running purposes, at the expense of the rest. The\r\nserpent has lost its limbs from disuse, but in the python a rudimentary\r\nlimb-bone is still preserved.\r\n\r\nThe alimentary system, blood-vessel system, and reproductive system\r\nhave been evolved gradually in the same way. The stomach is at first the\r\nwhole cavity in the animal. Later it becomes a straight, simple tube,\r\nstrengthened by a gullet in front. The liver is an outgrowth from this\r\ntube; the stomach proper is a bulbous expansion of its central part,\r\nlater provided with a valve. The kidneys are at first simple channels in\r\nthe skin for drainage, then closed tubes, which branch out more and\r\nmore, and then gather into our compact kidneys. We thus see that the\r\nbuilding up of the human body from a single cell is a substantial\r\nepitome of the long story of evolution, which occupied many millions of\r\nyears. We find man bearing in his body to-day traces of organs which\r\nwere useful to a remote ancestor, but of no advantage, and often a\r\nsource of mischief to himself. We learn that the origin of man, instead\r\nof being placed a few thousand years ago, must be traced back to the\r\npoint where, hundreds of thousands of years ago, he diverged from his\r\nape-cousins, though he retains to-day the plainest traces of that\r\nrelationship. Body and mind--for the development of mind follows with\r\nthe utmost precision on the development of brain--he is the culmination\r\nof a long process of development. His spirit is a form of energy\r\ninseparably bound up with the substance of his body. His evolution has\r\nbeen controlled by the same \"eternal, iron laws\" as the development of\r\nany other body--the laws of heredity and adaptation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HARVEY\r\n\r\nOn the Motion of the Heart and Blood\r\n\r\n     William Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood, was\r\n     born at Folkestone, England, on April 1, 1578. After graduating\r\n     from Caius College, Cambridge, he studied at Padua, where he had\r\n     the celebrated anatomist, Fabricius of Aquapendente, for his\r\n     master. In 1615 he was elected Lumleian lecturer at the College of\r\n     Physicians, and three years later was appointed physician\r\n     extraordinary to King James I. In 1628, twelve years after his\r\n     first statement of it in his lectures, he published at Frankfurt,\r\n     in Latin, \"An Anatomical Disquisition on the Motion of the Heart\r\n     and Blood,\" in which he maintained that there is a circulation of\r\n     the blood. Moreover, he distinguished between the pulmonary\r\n     circulation, from the right side of the heart to the left through\r\n     the lungs, and the systemic circulation from the left side of the\r\n     heart to the right through the rest of the body. Further, he\r\n     maintained that it was the office of the heart to maintain this\r\n     circulation by its alternate _diastole_ (expansion) and _systole_\r\n     (contraction) throughout life. This discovery was, says Sir John\r\n     Simon, the most important ever made in physiological science. It is\r\n     recorded that after his publication of it Harvey lost most of his\r\n     practice. Harvey died on June 3, 1657.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Motions of the Heart in Living Animals_\r\n\r\nWhen first I gave my mind to vivisections as a means of discovering the\r\nmotions and uses of the heart, I found the task so truly arduous that I\r\nwas almost tempted to think, with Fracastorius, that the motion of the\r\nheart was only to be comprehended by God. For I could neither rightly\r\nperceive at first when the systole and when the diastole took place, nor\r\nwhen and where dilation and contraction occurred, by reason of the\r\nrapidity of the motion, which, in many animals, is accomplished in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, coming and going like a flash of lightning. At\r\nlength it appeared that these things happen together or at the same\r\ninstant: the tension of the heart, the pulse of its apex, which is felt\r\nexternally by its striking against the chest, the thickening of its\r\nwalls, and the forcible expulsion of the blood it contains by the\r\nconstriction of its ventricles.\r\n\r\nHence the very opposite of the opinions commonly received appears to be\r\ntrue; inasmuch as it is generally believed that when the heart strikes\r\nthe breast and the pulse is felt without, the heart is dilated in its\r\nventricles and is filled with blood. But the contrary of this is the\r\nfact; that is to say, the heart is in the act of contracting and being\r\nemptied. Whence the motion, which is generally regarded as the diastole\r\nof the heart, is in truth its systole. And in like manner the intrinsic\r\nmotion of the heart is not the diastole but the systole; neither is it\r\nin the diastole that the heart grows firm and tense, but in the systole;\r\nfor then alone when tense is it moved and made vigorous. When it acts\r\nand becomes tense the blood is expelled; when it relaxes and sinks\r\ntogether it receives the blood in the manner and wise which will by and\r\nby be explained.\r\n\r\nFrom divers facts it is also manifest, in opposition to commonly\r\nreceived opinions, that the diastole of the arteries corresponds with\r\nthe time of the heart's systole; and that the arteries are filled and\r\ndistended by the blood forced into them by the contraction of the\r\nventricles. It is in virtue of one and the same cause, therefore, that\r\nall the arteries of the body pulsate, _viz._, the contraction of the\r\nleft ventricle in the same way as the pulmonary artery pulsates by the\r\ncontraction of the right ventricle.\r\n\r\nI am persuaded it will be found that the motion of the heart is as\r\nfollows. First of all, the auricle contracts and throws the blood into\r\nthe ventricle, which, being filled, the heart raises itself straightway,\r\nmakes all its fibres tense, contracts the ventricles and performs a\r\nbeat, by which beat it immediately sends the blood supplied to it by the\r\nauricle into the arteries; the right ventricle sending its charge into\r\nthe lungs by the vessel called _vena arteriosa_, but which, in structure\r\nand function, and all things else, is an artery; the left ventricle\r\nsending its charge into the aorta, and through this by the arteries to\r\nthe body at large.\r\n\r\nThe grand cause of hesitation and error in this subject appears to me to\r\nhave been the intimate connection between the heart and the lungs. When\r\nmen saw both the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins losing\r\nthemselves in the lungs, of course it became a puzzle to them to know\r\nhow the right ventricle should distribute the blood to the body, or the\r\nleft draw it from the _venæ cavæ_. Or they have hesitated because they\r\ndid not perceive the route by which the blood is transferred from the\r\nveins to the arteries, in consequence of the intimate connection between\r\nthe heart and lungs. And that this difficulty puzzled anatomists not a\r\nlittle when in their dissections they found the pulmonary artery and\r\nleft ventricle full of black and clotted blood, plainly appears when\r\nthey felt themselves compelled to affirm that the blood made its way\r\nfrom the right to the left ventricle by sweating through the septum of\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\nHad anatomists only been as conversant with the dissection of the lower\r\nanimals as they are with that of the human body, the matters that have\r\nhitherto kept them in perplexity of doubt would, in my opinion, have met\r\nthem freed from every kind of difficulty. And first in fishes, in which\r\nthe heart consists of but a single ventricle, they having no lungs, the\r\nthing is sufficiently manifest. Here the sac, which is situated at the\r\nbase of the heart, and is the part analogous to the auricle in man,\r\nplainly throws the blood into the heart, and the heart in its turn\r\nconspicuously transmits it by a pipe or artery, or vessel analogous to\r\nan artery; these are facts which are confirmed by simple ocular\r\nexperiment. I have seen, farther, that the same thing obtained most\r\nobviously.\r\n\r\nAnd since we find that in the greater number of animals, in all indeed\r\nat a certain period of their existence, the channels for the\r\ntransmission of the blood through the heart are so conspicuous, we have\r\nstill to inquire wherefore in some creatures--those, namely, that have\r\nwarm blood and that have attained to the adult age, man among the\r\nnumber--we should not conclude that the same thing is accomplished\r\nthrough the substance of the lungs, which, in the embryo, and at a time\r\nwhen the functions of these organs is in abeyance, Nature effects by\r\ndirect passages, and which indeed she seems compelled to adopt through\r\nwant of a passage by the lungs; or wherefore it should be better (for\r\nNature always does that which is best) that she should close up the\r\nvarious open routes which she had formerly made use of in the embryo,\r\nand still uses in all other animals; not only opening up no new apparent\r\nchannels for the passage of the blood therefore, but even entirely\r\nshutting up those which formerly existed in the embryos of those animals\r\nthat have lungs. For while the lungs are yet in a state of inaction,\r\nNature uses the two ventricles of the heart as if they formed but one\r\nfor the transmission of the blood. The condition of the embryos of those\r\nanimals which have lungs is the same as that of those animals which have\r\nno lungs.\r\n\r\nThus, by studying the structure of the animals who are nearer to and\r\nfurther from ourselves in their modes of life and in the construction of\r\ntheir bodies, we can prepare ourselves to understand the nature of the\r\npulmonary circulation in ourselves, and of the systemic circulation\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Systemic Circulation_\r\n\r\nWhat remains to be said is of so novel and unheard of a character that I\r\nnot only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble\r\nlest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much do wont and custom\r\nthat become as another nature, and doctrine once sown that hath struck\r\ndeep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men.\r\n\r\nAnd, sooth to say, when I surveyed my mass of evidence, whether derived\r\nfrom vivisections and my previous reflections on them, or from the\r\nventricles of the heart and the vessels that enter into and issue from\r\nthem, the symmetry and size of these conduits--for Nature, doing nothing\r\nin vain, would never have given them so large a relative size without a\r\npurpose; or from the arrangement and intimate structure of the valves in\r\nparticular and of the many other parts of the heart in general, with\r\nmany things besides; and frequently and seriously bethought me and long\r\nrevolved in my mind what might be the quantity of blood which was\r\ntransmitted, in how short a time its passage might be effected and the\r\nlike; and not finding it possible that this could be supplied by the\r\njuices of the ingested aliment without the veins on the one hand\r\nbecoming drained, and the arteries on the other getting ruptured through\r\nthe excessive charge of blood, unless the blood should somehow find its\r\nway from the arteries into the veins, and so return to the right side of\r\nthe heart; when I say, I surveyed all this evidence, I began to think\r\nwhether there might not be _a motion as it were in a circle_.\r\n\r\nNow this I afterwards found to be true; and I finally saw that the\r\nblood, forced by the action of the left ventricle into the arteries, was\r\ndistributed to the body at large, and its several parts, in the same\r\nmanner as it is sent through the lungs, impelled by the right ventricle\r\ninto the pulmonary artery; and that it then passed through the veins and\r\nalong the _vena cava_, and so round to the left ventricle in the manner\r\nalready indicated; which motion we may be allowed to call circular, in\r\nthe same way as Aristotle says that the air and the rain emulate the\r\ncircular motion of the superior bodies. For the moist earth, warmed by\r\nthe sun, evaporates; the vapours drawn upwards are condensed, and\r\ndescending in the form of rain moisten the earth again. And by this\r\narrangement are generations of living things produced; and in like\r\nmanner, too, are tempests and meteors engendered by the circular motion\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd so in all likelihood does it come to pass in the body through the\r\nmotion of the blood. The various parts are nourished, cherished,\r\nquickened by the warmer, more perfect, vaporous, spirituous, and, as I\r\nmay say, alimentive blood; which, on the contrary, in contact with these\r\nparts becomes cooled, coagulated, and, so to speak, effete; whence it\r\nreturns to its sovereign, the heart, as if to its source, or to the\r\ninmost home of the body, there to recover its state of excellence or\r\nperfection. Here it resumes its due fluidity, and receives an infusion\r\nof natural heat--powerful, fervid, a kind of treasury of life--and is\r\nimpregnated with spirits and, it might be said, with balsam; and thence\r\nit is again dispersed. And all this depends upon the motion and action\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Confirmations of the Theory_\r\n\r\nThree points present themselves for confirmation, which, being\r\nestablished, I conceive that the truth I contend for will follow\r\nnecessarily and appear as a thing obvious to all.\r\n\r\nThe first point is this. The blood is incessantly transmitted by the\r\naction of the heart from the _vena cava_ to the arteries in such\r\nquantity that it cannot be supplied from the ingesta, and in such wise\r\nthat the whole mass must very quickly pass through the organ.\r\n\r\nLet us assume the quantity of blood which the left ventricle of the\r\nheart will contain when distended to be, say, two ounces (in the dead\r\nbody I have found it to contain upwards of two ounces); and let us\r\nsuppose, as approaching the truth, that the fourth part of its charge\r\nis thrown into the artery at each contraction. Now, in the course of\r\nhalf an hour the heart will have made more than one thousand beats.\r\nMultiplying the number of drachms propelled by the number of pulses, we\r\nshall have one thousand half-ounces sent from this organ into the\r\nartery; a larger quantity than is contained in the whole body. This\r\ntruth, indeed, presents itself obviously before us when we consider what\r\nhappens in the dissection of living animals. The great artery need not\r\nbe divided, but a very small branch only (as Galen even proves in regard\r\nto man), to have the whole of the blood in the body, as well that of the\r\nveins as of the arteries, drained away in the course of no long\r\ntime--some half hour or less.\r\n\r\nThe second point is this. The blood, under the influence of the arterial\r\npulse, enters, and is impelled in a continuous, equable, and incessant\r\nstream through every part and member of the body in much larger quantity\r\nthan were sufficient for nutrition, or than the whole mass of fluids\r\ncould supply.\r\n\r\nI have here to cite certain experiments. Ligatures are either very tight\r\nor of middling tightness. A ligature I designate as tight, or perfect,\r\nwhen it is drawn so close about an extremity that no vessel can be felt\r\npulsating beyond it. Such ligatures are employed in the removal of\r\ntumours; and in these cases, all afflux of nutriment and heat being\r\nprevented by the ligature, we see the tumours dwindle and die, and\r\nfinally drop off. Now let anyone make an experiment upon the arm of a\r\nman, either using such a fillet as is employed in bloodletting, or\r\ngrasping the limb tightly with his hand; let a ligature be thrown about\r\nthe extremity and drawn as tightly as can be borne. It will first be\r\nperceived that beyond the ligature the arteries do not pulsate, while\r\nabove it the artery begins to rise higher at each diastole and to swell\r\nwith a kind of tide as it strove to break through and overcome the\r\nobstacle to its current.\r\n\r\nThen let the ligature be brought to that state of middling tightness\r\nwhich is used in bleeding, and it will be seen that the hand and arm\r\nwill instantly become deeply suffused and extended, and the veins show\r\nthemselves tumid and knotted. Which is as much as to say that when the\r\narteries pulsate the blood is flowing through them, but where they do\r\nnot pulsate they cease from transmitting anything. The veins again being\r\ncompressed, nothing can flow through them; the certain indication of\r\nwhich is that below the ligature they are much more tumid than above it.\r\n\r\nWhence is this blood? It must needs arrive by the arteries. For that it\r\ncannot flow in by the veins appears from the fact that the blood cannot\r\nbe forced towards the heart unless the ligature be removed. Further,\r\nwhen we see the veins below the ligature instantly swell up and become\r\ngorged when from extreme tightness it is somewhat relaxed, the arteries\r\nmeanwhile continuing unaffected, this is an obvious indication that the\r\nblood passes from the arteries into the veins, and not from the veins\r\ninto the arteries, and that there is either an anastomosis of the two\r\norders of vessels, or pores in the flesh and solid parts generally that\r\nare permeable to the blood.\r\n\r\nAnd now we understand wherefore in phlebotomy we apply our fillet above\r\nthe part that is punctured, not below it. Did the flow come from above,\r\nnot from below, the bandage in this case would not only be of no\r\nservice, but would prove a positive hindrance. And further, if we\r\ncalculate how many ounces flow through one arm or how many pass in\r\ntwenty or thirty pulsations under the medium ligature, we shall perceive\r\nthat a circulation is absolutely necessary, seeing that the quantity\r\ncannot be supplied immediately from the ingesta, and is vastly more than\r\ncan be requisite for the mere nutrition of the parts.\r\n\r\nAnd the third point to be confirmed is this. That the veins return this\r\nblood to the heart incessantly from all parts and members of the body.\r\n\r\nThis position will be made sufficiently clear from the valves which are\r\nfound in the cavities of the veins themselves, from the uses of these,\r\nand from experiments cognisable by the senses. The celebrated Hieronymus\r\nFabricius, of Aquapendente, first gave representations of the valves in\r\nthe veins, which consist of raised or loose portions of the inner\r\nmembranes of these vessels of extreme delicacy and a sigmoid, or\r\nsemi-lunar shape. Their office is by no means explained when we are told\r\nthat it is to hinder the blood, by its weight, from flowing into\r\ninferior parts; for the edges of the valves in the jugular veins hang\r\ndownwards, and are so contrived that they prevent the blood from rising\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nThe valves, in a word, do not invariably look upwards, but always\r\ntowards the trunks of the veins--towards the seat of the heart. They are\r\nsolely made and instituted lest, instead of advancing from the extreme\r\nto the central parts of the body, the blood should rather proceed along\r\nthe veins from the centre to the extremities; but the delicate valves,\r\nwhile they readily open in the right direction, entirely prevent all\r\nsuch contrary motion, being so situated and arranged that if anything\r\nescapes, or is less perfectly obstructed by the flaps of the one above,\r\nthe fluid passing, as it were, by the chinks between the flaps, it is\r\nimmediately received on the convexity of the one beneath, which is\r\nplaced transversely with reference to the former, and so is effectually\r\nhindered from getting any farther. And this I have frequently\r\nexperienced in my dissections of veins. If I attempted to pass a probe\r\nfrom the trunk of the veins into one of the smaller branches, whatever\r\ncare I took I found it impossible to introduce it far any way by reason\r\nof the valves; whilst, on the contrary, it was most easy to push it\r\nalong in the opposite direction, from without inwards, or from the\r\nbranches towards the trunks and roots.\r\n\r\nAnd now I may be allowed to give in brief my view of the circulation of\r\nthe blood, and to propose it for general adoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Conclusion_\r\n\r\nSince all things, both argument and ocular demonstration, show that the\r\nblood passes through the lungs and heart by the action of the\r\nventricles; and is sent for distribution to all parts of the body, where\r\nit makes its way into the veins and pores of the flesh; and then flows\r\nby the veins from the circumference on every side to the centre, from\r\nthe lesser to the greater veins; and is by them finally discharged into\r\nthe _vena cava_ and right auricle of the heart, and this in such a\r\nquantity or in such a flux and reflux, thither by the arteries, hither\r\nby the veins, as cannot possibly be supplied by the ingesta, and is much\r\ngreater than can be required for mere purposes of nutrition; therefore,\r\nit is absolutely necessary to conclude that the blood in the animal body\r\nis impelled in a circle and is in a state of ceaseless motion; and that\r\nthis is the act, or function, which the heart performs by means of its\r\npulse, and that it is the sole and only end of the motion and\r\ncontraction of the heart. For it would be very difficult to explain in\r\nany other way to what purpose all is constructed and arranged as we have\r\nseen it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN HERSCHEL\r\n\r\nOutlines of Astronomy\r\n\r\n     Sir John Frederick William Herschel, only child--and, as an\r\n     astronomer, almost the only rival--of Sir William Herschel, was\r\n     born at Slough, in Ireland, on March 7, 1792. At first privately\r\n     educated, in 1813 he graduated from St. John's College, Cambridge,\r\n     as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman. He chose the law as\r\n     his profession; but in 1816 reported that, under his father's\r\n     direction, he was going \"to take up stargazing.\" He then began a\r\n     re-examination of his father's double stars. In 1825 he wrote that\r\n     he was going to take nebulæ under his especial charge. He embarked\r\n     in 1833 with his family for the Cape; and his work at Feldhausen,\r\n     six miles from Cape Town, marked the beginning of southern sidereal\r\n     astronomy. The result of his four years' work there was published\r\n     in 1847. From 1855 he devoted himself at Collingwood to the\r\n     collection and revival of his father's and his own labours. His\r\n     \"Outlines of Astronomy,\" published in 1849, and founded on an\r\n     earlier \"Treatise on Astronomy\" of 1833, was an outstanding\r\n     success. Herschel's long and happy life, every day of which added\r\n     its share to his scientific services, came to an end on May 11,\r\n     1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--The Wonders of the Milky Way_\r\n\r\nThere is no science which draws more largely than does astronomy on that\r\nintellectual liberality which is ready to adopt whatever is demonstrated\r\nor concede whatever is rendered highly probable, however new and\r\nuncommon the points of view may be in which objects the most familiar\r\nmay thereby become placed. Almost all its conclusions stand in open and\r\nstriking contradiction with those of superficial and vulgar observation,\r\nand with what appears to everyone the most positive evidence of his\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly anything which sets in a stronger light the inherent\r\npower of truth over the mind of man, when opposed by no motives of\r\ninterest or passion, than the perfect readiness with which all its\r\nconclusions are assented to as soon as their evidence is clearly\r\napprehended, and the tenacious hold they acquire over our belief when\r\nonce admitted.\r\n\r\nIf the comparison of the apparent magnitude of the stars with their\r\nnumber leads to no immediately obvious conclusion, it is otherwise when\r\nwe view them in connection with their local distribution over the\r\nheavens. If indeed we confine ourselves to the three or four brightest\r\nclasses, we shall find them distributed with a considerable approach to\r\nimpartiality over the sphere; a marked preference, however, being\r\nobservable, especially in the southern hemisphere, to a zone or belt\r\npassing through _epsilon_ Orionis and _alpha_ Crucis. But if we take in\r\nthe whole amount visible to the naked eye we shall perceive a great\r\nincrease of numbers as we approach the borders of the Milky Way. And\r\nwhen we come to telescopic magnitudes we find them crowded beyond\r\nimagination along the extent of that circle and of the branches which it\r\nsends off from it; so that, in fact, its whole light is composed of\r\nnothing but stars of every magnitude from such as are visible to the\r\nnaked eye down to the smallest points of light perceptible with the best\r\ntelescopes.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena agree with the supposition that the stars of our\r\nfirmament, instead of being scattered indifferently in all directions\r\nthrough space, form a stratum of which the thickness is small in\r\ncomparison with its length and breadth; and in which the earth occupies\r\na place somewhere about the middle of its thickness and near the point\r\nwhere it subdivides into two principal laminæ inclined at a small angle\r\nto each other. For it is certain that to an eye so situated the apparent\r\ndensity of the stars, supposing them pretty equally scattered through\r\nthe space they occupy, would be least in the direction of the visual ray\r\nperpendicular to the lamina, and greatest in that of its breadth;\r\nincreasing rapidly in passing from one to the other direction, just as\r\nwe see a slight haze in the atmosphere thickening into a decided\r\nfog-bank near the horizon by the rapid increase of the mere length of\r\nthe visual ray.\r\n\r\nSuch is the view of the construction of the starry firmament taken by\r\nSir William Herschel, whose powerful telescopes first effected a\r\ncomplete analysis of this wonderful zone, and demonstrated the fact of\r\nits entirely consisting of stars.\r\n\r\nSo crowded are they in some parts of it that by counting the stars in a\r\nsingle field of his telescope he was led to conclude that 50,000 had\r\npassed under his review in a zone two degrees in breadth during a single\r\nhour's observation. The immense distances at which the remoter regions\r\nmust be situated will sufficiently account for the vast predominance of\r\nsmall magnitudes which are observed in it.\r\n\r\nThe process of gauging the heavens was devised by Sir William Herschel\r\nfor this purpose. It consisted simply in counting the stars of all\r\nmagnitudes which occur in single fields of view, of fifteen minutes in\r\ndiameter, visible through a reflecting telescope of 18 inches aperture,\r\nand 20 feet focal length, with a magnifying power of 180 degrees, the\r\npoints of observation being very numerous and taken indiscriminately in\r\nevery part of the surface of the sphere visible in our latitudes.\r\n\r\nOn a comparison of many hundred such \"gauges,\" or local enumerations, it\r\nappears that the density of starlight (or the number of stars existing\r\non an average of several such enumerations in any one immediate\r\nneighbourhood) is least in the pole of the Galactic circle [_i.e._, the\r\ngreat circle to which the course of the Milky Way most nearly conforms:\r\n_gala_ = milk], and increases on all sides down to the Milky Way itself,\r\nwhere it attains its maximum. The progressive rate of increase in\r\nproceeding from the pole is at first slow, but becomes more and more\r\nrapid as we approach the plane of that circle, according to a law from\r\nwhich it appears that the mean density of the stars in the galactic\r\ncircle exceeds, in a ratio of very nearly 30 to 1, that in its pole, and\r\nin a proportion of more than 4 to 1 that in a direction 15 degrees\r\ninclined to its plane.\r\n\r\nAs we ascend from the galactic plane we perceive that the density\r\ndecreases with great rapidity. So far we can perceive no flaw in this\r\nreasoning if only it be granted (1) that the level planes are continuous\r\nand of equal density throughout; and (2) that an absolute and definite\r\nlimit is set to telescopic vision, beyond which, if stars exist, they\r\nelude our sight, and are to us as if they existed not. It would appear\r\nthat, with an almost exactly similar law of apparent density in the two\r\nhemispheres, the southern were somewhat richer in stars than the\r\nnorthern, which may arise from our situation not being precisely in the\r\nmiddle of its thickness, but somewhat nearer to its northern surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Penetrating Infinite Space_\r\n\r\nWhen examined with powerful telescopes, the constitution of this\r\nwonderful zone is found to be no less various than its aspect to the\r\nnaked eye is irregular. In some regions the stars of which it is\r\ncomposed are scattered with remarkable uniformity over immense tracts,\r\nwhile in others the irregularity of their distribution is quite as\r\nstriking, exhibiting a rapid succession of closely clustering rich\r\npatches separated by comparatively poor intervals, and indeed in some\r\ninstances absolutely dark and _completely_ void of any star even of the\r\nsmallest telescopic magnitude. In some places not more than 40 or 50\r\nstars on an average occur in a \"gauge\" field of 15 minutes, while in\r\nothers a similar average gives a result of 400 or 500.\r\n\r\nNor is less variety observable in the character of its different\r\nregions in respect of the magnitude of the stars they exhibit, and the\r\nproportional numbers of the larger and smaller magnitudes associated\r\ntogether, than in respect of their aggregate numbers. In some, for\r\ninstance, extremely minute stars, though never altogether wanting, occur\r\nin numbers so moderate as to lead us irresistibly to the conclusion that\r\nin these regions we are _fairly through_ the starry stratum, since it is\r\nimpossible otherwise (supposing their light not intercepted) that the\r\nnumbers of the smaller magnitudes should not go on increasing _ad\r\ninfinitum_.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, moreover, the ground of the heavens, as seen between the\r\nstars, is for the most part perfectly dark, which again would not be the\r\ncase if innumerable multitudes of stars, too minute to be individually\r\ndiscernible, existed beyond. In other regions we are presented with the\r\nphenomenon of an almost uniform degree of brightness of the individual\r\nstars, accompanied with a very even distribution of them over the ground\r\nof the heavens, both the larger and smaller magnitudes being strikingly\r\ndeficient. In such cases it is equally impossible not to perceive that\r\nwe are looking through a sheet of stars nearly of a size and of no great\r\nthickness compared with the distance which separates them from us. Were\r\nit otherwise we should be driven to suppose the more distant stars were\r\nuniformly the larger, so as to compensate by their intrinsic brightness\r\nfor their greater distance, a supposition contrary to all probability.\r\n\r\nIn others again, and that not infrequently, we are presented with a\r\ndouble phenomenon of the same kind--_viz._, a tissue, as it were, of\r\nlarge stars spread over another of very small ones, the intermediate\r\nmagnitudes being wanting, and the conclusion here seems equally evident\r\nthat in such cases we look through two sidereal sheets separated by a\r\nstarless interval.\r\n\r\nThroughout by far the larger portion of the extent of the Milky Way in\r\nboth hemispheres the general blackness of the ground of the heavens on\r\nwhich its stars are projected, and the absence of that innumerable\r\nmultitude and excessive crowding of the smallest visible magnitudes, and\r\nof glare produced by the aggregate light of multitudes too small to\r\naffect the eye singly, which the contrary supposition would appear to\r\nnecessitate, must, we think, be considered unequivocal indications that\r\nits dimensions, _in directions where those conditions obtain_, are not\r\nonly not infinite, but that the space-penetrating power of our\r\ntelescopes suffices fairly to pierce through and beyond it.\r\n\r\nIt is but right, however, to warn our readers that this conclusion has\r\nbeen controverted, and that by an authority not lightly to be put aside,\r\non the ground of certain views taken by Olbers as to a defect of perfect\r\ntransparency in the celestial spaces, in virtue of which the light of\r\nthe more distant stars is enfeebled more than in proportion to their\r\ndistance. The extinction of light thus originating proceeding in\r\ngeometrical ratio, while the distance increases in arithmetical, a\r\nlimit, it is argued, is placed to the space-penetrating power of\r\ntelescopes far within that which distance alone, apart from such\r\nobscuration, would assign.\r\n\r\nIt must suffice here to observe that the objection alluded to, if\r\napplicable to any, is equally so to every part of the galaxy. We are not\r\nat liberty to argue that at one part of its circumference our view is\r\nlimited by this sort of cosmical veil, which extinguishes the smaller\r\nmagnitudes, cuts off the nebulous light of distant masses, and closes\r\nour view in impenetrable darkness; while at another we are compelled, by\r\nthe clearest evidence telescopes can afford, to believe that star-strewn\r\nvistas _lie open_, exhausting their powers and stretching out beyond\r\ntheir utmost reach, as is proved by that very phenomenon which the\r\nexistence of such a veil would render impossible--_viz._, infinite\r\nincrease of number and diminution of magnitude, terminating in complete\r\nirresolvable nebulosity.\r\n\r\nSuch is, in effect, the spectacle afforded by a very large portion of\r\nthe Milky Way in that interesting region near its point of bifurcation\r\nin Scorpio, where, through the hollows and deep recesses of its\r\ncomplicated structure, we behold what has all the appearance of a wide\r\nand indefinitely prolonged area strewed over with discontinuous masses\r\nand clouds of stars, which the telescope at last refuses to analyse.\r\nWhatever other conclusions we may draw, this must anyhow be regarded as\r\nthe direction of the greatest linear extension of the ground-plan of the\r\ngalaxy. And it would appear to follow also that in those regions where\r\nthat zone is clearly resolved into stars well separated and _seen\r\nprojected on a black ground_, and where, by consequence, it is certain,\r\nif the foregoing views be correct, that we look out beyond them into\r\nspace, the smallest visible stars appear as such not by reason of\r\nexcessive distance, but of inferiority of size or brightness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Variable, Temporary and Binary Stars_\r\n\r\nWherever we can trace the law of periodicity we are strongly impressed\r\nwith the idea of rotatory or orbitual motion. Among the stars are\r\nseveral which, though in no way distinguishable from others by any\r\napparent change of place, nor by any difference of appearance in\r\ntelescopes, yet undergo a more or less regular periodical increase and\r\ndiminution of lustre, involving in one or two cases a complete\r\nextinction and revival. These are called periodic stars. The longest\r\nknown, and one of the most remarkable, is the star _Omicron_ in the\r\nconstellation Cetus (sometimes called Mira Ceti), which was first\r\nnoticed as variable by Fabricius in 1596. It appears about twelve times\r\nin eleven years, remains at its greatest brightness about a fortnight,\r\nbeing then on some occasions equal to a large star of the second\r\nmagnitude, decreases during about three months, till it becomes\r\ncompletely invisible to the naked eye, in which state it remains about\r\nfive months, and continues increasing during the remainder of its\r\nperiod. Such is the general course of its phases. But the mean period\r\nabove assigned would appear to be subject to a cyclical fluctuation\r\nembracing eighty-eight such periods, and having the effect of gradually\r\nlengthening and shortening alternately those intervals to the extent of\r\ntwenty-five days one way and the other. The irregularities in the degree\r\nof brightness attained at the maximum are also periodical.\r\n\r\nSuch irregularities prepare us for other phenomena of stellar variation\r\nwhich have hitherto been reduced to no law of periodicity--the phenomena\r\nof temporary stars which have appeared from time to time in different\r\nparts of the heavens blazing forth with extraordinary lustre, and after\r\nremaining awhile, apparently immovable, have died away and left no\r\ntrace. In the years 945, 1264, and 1572 brilliant stars appeared in the\r\nregion of the heavens between Cepheus and Cassiopeia; and we may suspect\r\nthem, with Goodricke, to be one and the same star with a period of 312,\r\nor perhaps 156 years. The appearance of the star of 1572 was so sudden\r\nthat Tycho Brahe, a celebrated Dutch astronomer, returning one evening\r\nfrom his laboratory to his dwellinghouse, was surprised to find a group\r\nof country people gazing at a star which he was sure did not exist half\r\nan hour before. This was the star in question. It was then as bright as\r\nSirius, and continued to increase till it surpassed Jupiter when\r\nbrightest, and was visible at midday. It began to diminish in December\r\nof the same year, and in March 1574 had entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn 1803 it was announced by Sir William Herschel that there exist\r\nsidereal systems composed of two stars revolving about each other in\r\nregular orbits, and constituting which may be called, to distinguish\r\nthem from double stars, which are only optically double, binary stars.\r\nThat which since then has been most assiduously watched, and has offered\r\nphenomena of the greatest interest, is _gamma Virginis_. It is a star of\r\nthe vulgar third magnitude, and its component individuals are very\r\nnearly equal, and, as it would seem, in some slight degree variable. It\r\nhas been known to consist of two stars since the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, the distance being then between six and seven\r\nseconds, so that any tolerably good telescope would resolve it. When\r\nobserved by Herschel in 1780 it was 5.66 seconds, and continued to\r\ndecrease gradually and regularly, till at length, in 1836, the two stars\r\nhad approached so closely as to appear perfectly round and single under\r\nthe highest magnifying power which could be applied to most excellent\r\ninstruments--the great refractor of Pulkowa alone, with a magnifying\r\npower of a thousand, continuing to indicate, by the wedge-shaped form of\r\nthe disc of the star, its composite nature.\r\n\r\nBy estimating the ratio of its length to its breadth, and measuring the\r\nformer, M. Struve concludes that at this epoch the distance of the two\r\nstars, centre from centre, might be stated at .22 seconds. From that\r\ntime the star again opened, and is now again a perfectly easily\r\nseparable star. This very remarkable diminution, and subsequent\r\nincrease, of distance has been accompanied by a corresponding and\r\nequally remarkable increase and subsequent diminution of relative\r\nangular motion. Thus in 1783 the apparent angular motion hardly amounted\r\nto half a degree per annum; while in 1830 it had decreased to 5 degrees,\r\nin 1834 to 20 degrees, in 1835 to 40 degrees, and about the middle of\r\n1836 to upwards of 70 degrees per annum, or at the rate of a degree in\r\nfive days.\r\n\r\nThis is in entire conformity with the principles of dynamics, which\r\nestablish a necessary connection between the angular velocity and the\r\ndistance, as well in the apparent as in the real orbit of one body\r\nrevolving about another under the influence of mutual attraction; the\r\nformer varying inversely as the square of the latter, in both orbits,\r\nwhatever be the curve described and whatever the law of the attractive\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nIt is not with the revolutions of bodies of a planetary or cometary\r\nnature round a solar centre that we are concerned; it is that of sun\r\nround sun--each perhaps, at least in some binary systems, where the\r\nindividuals are very remote and their period of revolution very long,\r\naccompanied by its train of planets and their satellites, closely\r\nshrouded from our view by the splendour of their respective suns, and\r\ncrowded into a space bearing hardly a greater proportion to the enormous\r\ninterval which separates them than the distances of the satellites of\r\nour planets from their primaries bear to their distances from the sun\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nA less distinctly characterised subordination would be incompatible with\r\nthe stability of their systems and with the planetary nature of their\r\norbits. Unless close under the protecting wing of their immediate\r\nsuperior, the sweep of their other sun, in its perihelion passage round\r\ntheir own, might carry them off or whirl them into orbits utterly\r\nincompatible with conditions necessary for the existence of their\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--The Nebulæ_\r\n\r\nIt is to Sir William Herschel that we owe the most complete analysis of\r\nthe great variety of those objects which are generally classed as\r\nnebulæ. The great power of his telescopes disclosed the existence of an\r\nimmense number of these objects before unknown, and showed them to be\r\ndistributed over the heavens not by any means uniformly, but with a\r\nmarked preference to a certain district extending over the northern pole\r\nof the galactic circle. In this region, occupying about one-eighth of\r\nthe surface of the sphere, one-third of the entire nebulous contents of\r\nthe heavens are situated.\r\n\r\nThe resolvable nebulæ can, of course, only be considered as clusters\r\neither too remote, or consisting of stars intrinsically too faint, to\r\naffect us by their individual light, unless where two or three happen to\r\nbe close enough to make a joint impression and give the idea of a point\r\nbrighter than the rest. They are almost universally round or oval, their\r\nloose appendages and irregularities of form being, as it were,\r\nextinguished by the distance, and only the general figure of the\r\ncondensed parts being discernible. It is under the appearance of objects\r\nof this character that all the greater globular clusters exhibit\r\nthemselves in telescopes of insufficient optical power to show them\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe first impression which Halley and other early discoverers of\r\nnebulous objects received from their peculiar aspect was that of a\r\nphosphorescent vapour (like the matter of a comet's tail), or a gaseous\r\nand, so to speak, elementary form of luminous sidereal matter. Admitting\r\nthe existence of such a medium, Sir W. Herschel was led to speculate on\r\nits gradual subsidence and condensation, by the effect of its own\r\ngravity, into more or less regular spherical or spheroidal forms, denser\r\n(as they must in that case be) towards the centre.\r\n\r\nAssuming that in the progress of this subsidence local centres of\r\ncondensation subordinate to the general tendency would not be wanting,\r\nhe conceived that in this way solid nuclei might arise whose local\r\ngravitation still further condensing, and so absorbing the nebulous\r\nmatter each in its immediate neighbourhood, might ultimately become\r\nstars, and the whole nebula finally take on the state of a cluster of\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nAmong the multitude of nebulæ revealed by his telescope every stage of\r\nthis process might be considered as displayed to our eyes, and in every\r\nmodification of form to which the general principle might be conceived\r\nto apply. The more or less advanced state of a nebula towards its\r\nsegregation into discrete stars, and of these stars themselves towards a\r\ndenser state of aggregation round a central nucleus, would thus be in\r\nsome sort an indication of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT\r\n\r\nCosmos, a Sketch of the Universe\r\n\r\n     Frederick Henry Alexander von Humboldt was born in Berlin on\r\n     September 14, 1769. In 1788 he made the acquaintance of George\r\n     Forster, one of Captain Cook's companions, and geological\r\n     excursions made with him were the occasion of his first\r\n     publications, a book on the nature of basalt. His work in the\r\n     administration of mines in the principalities of Bayreuth and\r\n     Anspach furnished materials for a treatise on fossil flora; and in\r\n     1827, when he was residing in Paris, he gave to the world his\r\n     \"Voyage to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent,\" which\r\n     embodies the results of his investigations in South America. Two\r\n     years later he organised an expedition to Asiatic Russia, charging\r\n     himself with all the scientific observations. But his principal\r\n     interest lay in the accomplishment of that physical description of\r\n     the universe for which all his previous studies had been a\r\n     preparation, and which during the years 1845 to 1848 appeared under\r\n     the comprehensive title of \"Cosmos, or Sketch of a Physical\r\n     Description of the Universe.\" Humboldt died on May 6, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--The Physical Study of the World_\r\n\r\nThe natural world may be opposed to the intellectual, or nature to art\r\ntaking the latter term in its higher sense as embracing the\r\nmanifestations of the intellectual power of man; but these\r\ndistinctions--which are indicated in most cultivated languages--must not\r\nbe suffered to lead to such a separation of the domain of physics from\r\nthat of the intellect as would reduce the physics of the universe to a\r\nmere assemblage of empirical specialities. Science only begins for man\r\nfrom the moment when his mind lays hold of matter--when he tries to\r\nsubject the mass accumulated by experience to rational combinations.\r\n\r\nScience is mind applied to nature. The external world only exists for us\r\nso far as we conceive it within ourselves, and as it shapes itself\r\nwithin us into the form of a contemplation of nature. As intelligence\r\nand language, thought and the signs of thought, are united by secret and\r\nindissoluble links, so, and almost without our being conscious of it,\r\nthe external world and our ideas and feelings melt into each other.\r\n\"External phenomena are translated,\" as Hegel expresses it in his\r\n\"Philosophy of History,\" \"in our internal representation of them.\" The\r\nobjective world, thought by us, reflected in us, is subjected to the\r\nunchanging, necessary, and all-conditioning forms of our intellectual\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the mind exerts itself on the elements furnished to it\r\nby the perceptions of the senses. Thus, in the youth of nations there\r\nmanifests itself in the simplest intuition of natural facts, in the\r\nfirst efforts made to comprehend them, the germ of the philosophy of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIf the study of physical phenomena be regarded in its bearings not on\r\nthe material wants of man, but on his general intellectual progress, its\r\nhighest result is found in the knowledge of those mutual relations which\r\nlink together the general forces of nature. It is the intuitive and\r\nintimate persuasion of the existence of these relations which at once\r\nenlarges and elevates our views and enhances our enjoyment. Such\r\nextended views are the growth of observation, of meditation, and of the\r\nspirit of the age, which is ever reflected in the operations of the\r\nhuman mind whatever may be their direction.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when man, in interrogating nature, began to experiment or\r\nto produce phenomena under definite conditions, and to collect and\r\nrecord the fruits of his experience--so that investigation might no\r\nlonger be restricted by the short limits of a single life--the\r\nphilosophy of nature laid aside the vague and poetic forms with which\r\nshe had at first been clothed, and has adopted a more severe character.\r\n\r\nThe history of science teaches us how inexact and incomplete\r\nobservations have led, through false inductions, to that great number\r\nof erroneous physical views which have been perpetuated as popular\r\nprejudices among all classes of society. Thus, side by side with a solid\r\nand scientific knowledge of phenomena, there has been preserved a system\r\nof pretended results of observation, the more difficult to shake because\r\nit takes no account of any of the facts by which it is overturned.\r\n\r\nThis empiricism--melancholy inheritance of earlier times--invariably\r\nmaintains whatever axioms it has laid down; it is arrogant, as is\r\neverything that is narrow-minded; while true physical philosophy,\r\nfounded on science, doubts because it seeks to investigate\r\nthoroughly--distinguishes between that which is certain and that which\r\nis simply probable--and labours incessantly to bring its theories nearer\r\nto perfection by extending the circle of observation. This assemblage of\r\nincomplete dogmas bequeathed from one century to another, this system of\r\nphysics made up of popular prejudices, is not only injurious because it\r\nperpetuates error with all the obstinacy of ill-observed facts, but also\r\nbecause it hinders the understanding from rising to the level of great\r\nviews of nature.\r\n\r\nInstead of seeking to discover the _mean_ state around which, in the\r\nmidst of apparent independence and irregularity, the phenomena really\r\nand invariably oscillate, this false science delights in multiplying\r\napparent exceptions to the dominion of fixed laws, and seeks, in organic\r\nforms and the phenomena of nature, other marvels than those presented by\r\ninternal progressive development, and by regular order and succession.\r\nEver disinclined to recognise in the present the analogy of the past, it\r\nis always disposed to believe the order of nature suspended by\r\nperturbations, of which it places the seat, as if by chance, sometimes\r\nin the interior of the earth, sometimes in the remote regions of space.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--The Inductive Method_\r\n\r\nThe generalisation of laws which were first applied to smaller groups of\r\nphenomena advances by successive gradations, and their empire is\r\nextended, and their evidence strengthened, so long as the reasoning\r\nprocess is directed to really analogous phenomena. Empirical\r\ninvestigation begins by single perceptions, which are afterwards classed\r\naccording to their analogy or dissimilarity. Observation is succeeded at\r\na much later epoch by experiment, in which phenomena are made to arise\r\nunder conditions previously determined on by the experimentalist, guided\r\nby preliminary hypotheses, or a more or less just intuition of the\r\nconnection of natural objects and forces.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by observation and experiment lead by the path of\r\ninduction and analogy to the discovery of empirical laws, and these\r\nsuccessive phases in the application of human intellect have marked\r\ndifferent epochs in the life of nations. It has been by adhering closely\r\nto this inductive path that the great mass of facts has been accumulated\r\nwhich now forms the solid foundation of the natural sciences.\r\n\r\nTwo forms of abstraction govern the whole of this class of\r\nknowledge--_viz._, the determination of quantitative relations,\r\naccording to number and magnitude; and relations of quality, embracing\r\nthe specific properties of heterogeneous matter.\r\n\r\nThe first of these forms, more accessible to the exercise of thought,\r\nbelongs to the domain of mathematics; the other, more difficult to\r\nseize, and apparently more mysterious, to that of chemistry. In order to\r\nsubmit phenomena to calculation, recourse is had to a hypothetical\r\nconstruction of matter by a combination of molecules and atoms whose\r\nnumber, form, position, and polarity determine, modify, and vary the\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nWe are yet very far from the time when a reasonable hope could be\r\nentertained of reducing all that is perceived by our senses to the unity\r\nof a single principle; but the partial solution of the problem--the\r\ntendency towards a general comprehension of the phenomena of the\r\nuniverse--does not the less continue to be the high and enduring aim of\r\nall natural investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Distribution of Matter in Space_\r\n\r\nA physical cosmography, or picture of the universe, should begin, not\r\nwith the earth, but with the regions of space--the distribution of\r\nmatter in the universe.\r\n\r\nWe see matter existing in space partly in the form of rotating and\r\nrevolving spheroids, differing greatly in density and magnitude, and\r\npartly in the form of self-luminous vapour dispersed in shining nebulous\r\nspots or patches. The nebulæ present themselves to the eye in the form\r\nof round, or nebulous discs, of small apparent magnitude, either single\r\nor in pairs, which are sometimes connected by a thread of light; when\r\ntheir diameters are greater their forms vary--some are elongated, others\r\nhave several branches, some are fan-shaped, some annular, the ring being\r\nwell defined and the interior dark. They are supposed to be undergoing\r\nvarious and progressive changes of form, as condensation proceeds around\r\none or more nuclei in conformity with the laws of gravitation. Between\r\ntwo and three thousand of such unresolvable nebulæ have already been\r\ncounted, and their positions determined.\r\n\r\nIf we leave the consideration of the attenuated vaporous matter of the\r\nimmeasurable regions of space, whether existing in a dispersed state as\r\na cosmical ether without form or limits, or in the shape of nebulæ, and\r\npass to those portions of the universe which are condensed into solid\r\nspheres or spheroids, we approach a class of phenomena exclusively\r\ndesignated as stars or as the sidereal universe. Here, too, we find\r\ndifferent degrees of solidity or density in the agglomerated matter.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the regions of space to one of the island-studded seas of\r\nour planet, we may imagine we see matter distributed in groups, whether\r\nof unresolvable nebulæ of different ages condensed around one or more\r\nnuclei, or in clusters of stars, or in stars scattered singly. Our\r\ncluster of stars, or the island in space to which we belong, forms a\r\nlens-shaped, flattened, and everywhere detached stratum, whose major\r\naxis is estimated at seven or eight hundred, and its minor axis at a\r\nhundred and fifty times, the distance of Sirius. If we assume that the\r\nparallax of Sirius does not exceed that accurately determined for the\r\nbrightest stars in Centaur (0.9128 sec.), it will follow that light\r\ntraverses one distance of Sirius in three years, while nine years and a\r\nquarter are required for the transmission of the light of the star 61\r\nCygni, whose considerable proper motion might lead to the inference of\r\ngreat proximity.\r\n\r\nOur cluster of stars is a disc of comparatively small thickness divided,\r\nat about a third its length, into two branches; we are supposed to be\r\nnear this division, and nearer to the region of Sirius than to that of\r\nthe constellation of the Eagle; almost in the middle of the starry\r\nstratum in the direction of its thickness.\r\n\r\nThe place of our solar system and the form of the whole lens are\r\ninferred from a kind of scale--_i.e._, from the different number of\r\nstars seen in equal telescopic fields of view. The greater or less\r\nnumber of stars measures the relative depth of the stratum in different\r\ndirections; giving in each case, like the marks on a sounding-line, the\r\ncomparative length of visual ray required to reach the bottom; or, more\r\nproperly, as above and below do not here apply, the outer limit of the\r\nsidereal stratum.\r\n\r\nIn the direction of the major axis, where the greater number of stars\r\nare placed behind each other, the remoter ones appear closely crowded\r\ntogether, and, as it were, united by a milky radiance, and present a\r\nzone or belt projected on the visible celestial vault. This narrow belt\r\nis divided into branches; and its beautiful, but not uniform brightness,\r\nis interrupted by some dark places. As seen by us on the apparent\r\nconcave celestial sphere, it deviates only a few degrees from a great\r\ncircle, we being near the middle of the entire starry cluster, and\r\nalmost in the plane of the Milky Way. If out planetary system were far\r\noutside the cluster, the Milky Way would appear to telescopic vision as\r\na ring, and at a still greater distance as a resolvable disc-shaped\r\nnebula.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--On Earth History_\r\n\r\nThe succession and relative age of different geological formations are\r\ntraced partly by the order of superposition of sedimentary strata, of\r\nmetamorphic beds, and of conglomerates, but most securely by the\r\npresence of organic remains and their diversities of structure. In the\r\nfossiliferous strata are inhumed the remains of the floras and faunas of\r\npast ages. As we descend from stratum to stratum to study the relations\r\nof superposition, we ascend in the order of time, and new worlds of\r\nanimal and vegetable existence present themselves to the view.\r\n\r\nIn our ignorance of the laws under which new organic forms appear from\r\ntime to time upon the surface of the globe, we employ the expression\r\n\"new creations\" when we desire to refer to the historical phenomena of\r\nthe variations which have taken place at intervals in the animals and\r\nplants that have inhabited the basins of the primitive seas and the\r\nuplifted continents.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes happened that extinct species have been preserved\r\nentire, even to the minutest details of their tissues and articulations.\r\nIn the lower beds of the Secondary Period, the lias of Lyme Regis, a\r\nsepia has been found so wonderfully preserved that a part of the black\r\nfluid with which the animal was provided myriads of years ago to conceal\r\nitself from its enemies has actually served at the present time to draw\r\nits picture. In other cases such traces alone remain as the impression\r\nwhich the feet of animals have left on wet sand or mud over which they\r\npassed when alive, or the remains of their undigested food (coprolites).\r\n\r\nThe analytical study of the animal and vegetable kingdoms of the\r\nprimitive world has given rise to two distinct branches of science; one\r\npurely morphological, which occupies itself in natural and physiological\r\ndescriptions, and in the endeavour to fill up from extinct forms the\r\nchasms which present themselves in the series of existing species; the\r\nother branch, more especially geological considers the relations of the\r\nfossil remains to the superposition and relative age of the sedimentary\r\nbeds in which they are found. The first long predominated; and the\r\nsuperficial manner which then prevailed of comparing fossil and existing\r\nspecies led to errors of which traces still remain in the strange\r\ndenominations which were given to certain natural objects. Writers\r\nattempted to identify all extinct forms with living species, as, in the\r\nsixteenth century, the animals of the New World were confounded by false\r\nanalogies with those of the Old.\r\n\r\nIn studying the relative age of fossils by the order of superposition of\r\nthe strata in which they are found, important relations have been\r\ndiscovered between families and species (the latter always few in\r\nnumbers) which have disappeared and those which are still living. All\r\nobservations concur in showing that the fossil floras and faunas differ\r\nfrom the present animal and vegetable forms the more widely in\r\nproportion as the sedimentary beds to which they belong are lower, or\r\nmore ancient.\r\n\r\nThus great variations have successively taken place in the general\r\ntypes of organic life, and these grand phenomena, which were first\r\npointed out by Cuvier, offer numerical relations which Deshayes and\r\nLyell have made the object of researches by which they have been\r\nconducted to important results, especially as regards the numerous and\r\nwell-preserved fossils of the Tertiary formation. Agassiz, who has\r\nexamined 1,700 species of fossil fishes, and who estimates at 8,000 the\r\nnumber of living species which have been described, or which are\r\npreserved in our collections, affirms that, with the exception of one\r\nsmall fossil fish peculiar to the argillaceous geodes of Greenland, he\r\nhas never met in the Transition, Secondary, or Tertiary strata with any\r\nexample of this class specifically identical with any living fish; and\r\nhe adds the important remark that even in the lower Tertiary formations\r\na third of the fossil fishes of the _calcaire grossier_ and of the\r\nLondon clay belong to extinct families.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that fishes, which are the oldest vertebrates, first appear\r\nin the Silurian strata, and are found in all the succeeding formations\r\nup to the birds of the Tertiary Period. Reptiles begin in like manner in\r\nthe magnesian limestone, and if we now add that the first mammalia are\r\nmet with in Oolite, the Stonefield slate; and that the first remains of\r\nbirds have been found in the deposits of the cretaceous period, we shall\r\nhave indicated the inferior limits, according to our present knowledge,\r\nof the four great divisions of the vertebrates.\r\n\r\nIn regard to invertebrate animals, we find corals and some shells\r\nassociated in the oldest formations with very highly organised\r\ncephalopodes and crustaceans, so that widely different orders of this\r\npart of the animal kingdom appear intermingled; there are, nevertheless,\r\nmany isolated groups belonging to the same order in which determinate\r\nlaws are discoverable. Whole mountains are sometimes found to consist of\r\na single species of fossil goniatites, trilobites, or nummulites.\r\n\r\nWhere different genera are intermingled, there often exists a\r\nsystematic relation between the series of organic forms and the\r\nsuperposition of the formations; and it has been remarked that the\r\nassociation of certain families and species follows a regular law in the\r\nsuperimposed strata of which the whole constitutes one formation. It has\r\nbeen found that the waters in the most distant parts of the globe were\r\ninhabited at the same epochs by testaceous animals corresponding, at\r\nleast in generic character, with European fossils.\r\n\r\nStrata defined by their fossil contents, or by the fragments of other\r\nrocks which they include, form a geological horizon by which the\r\ngeologist may recognise his position, and obtain safe conclusions in\r\nregard to the identity or relative antiquity of formations, the\r\nperiodical repetition of certain strata--their parallelism--or their\r\nentire suppression. If we would thus comprehend in its greatest\r\nsimplicity the general type of the sedentary formations, we find in\r\nproceeding successively from below upwards: (1) The Transition group,\r\nincluding the Silurian and Devonian (Old Red Sandstone) systems; (2) the\r\nLower Trias, comprising mountain limestone, the coal measures, the lower\r\nnew red sandstone, and the magnesian limestone; (3) the Upper Trias,\r\ncomposing the bunter, or variegated sandstone, the muschelkalk, and the\r\nKeuper sandstone; (4) the Oolitic, or Jurassic series, including Lias;\r\n(5) the Cretaceous series; (6) the Tertiary group, as represented in its\r\nthree stages by the _calcaire grossier_ and other beds of the Paris\r\nbasin, the lignites, or brown coal of Germany, and the sub-Apennine\r\ngroup of Italy.\r\n\r\nTo these succeed transported soils (_alluvium_), containing the gigantic\r\nbones of ancient mammalia, such as the mastodons, the dinotherium, and\r\nthe megatheroid animals, among which is the mylodon of Owen, an animal\r\nupwards of eleven feet in length, allied to the sloth. Associated with\r\nthese extinct species are found the fossil remains of animals still\r\nliving: elephants, rhinoceroses, oxen, horses, and deer. Near Bogota, at\r\nan elevation of 8,200 French feet above the level of the sea, there is a\r\nfield filled with the bones of mastodon (_Campo de Gigantes_), in which\r\nI have had careful excavations made. The bones found on the table-lands\r\nof Mexico belong to the true elephants of extinct species. The minor\r\nrange of the Himalaya, the Sewalik hills, contain, besides numerous\r\nmastodons, the sivatherium and the gigantic land-tortoise\r\n(_Colossochelys_), more than twelve feet in length and six in height, as\r\nwell as remains belonging to still existing species of elephants,\r\nrhinoceroses, and giraffes. It is worthy of notice that these fossils\r\nare found in a zone which enjoys the tropical climate supposed to have\r\nprevailed at the period of the mastodons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_V.--The Permanence of Science_\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been regarded as a discouraging consideration that,\r\nwhile works of literature being fast-rooted in the depths of human\r\nfeeling, imagination and reason suffer little from the lapse of time, it\r\nis otherwise with works which treat of subjects dependent on the\r\nprogress of experimental knowledge. The improvement of instruments, and\r\nthe continued enlargement of the field of observation, render\r\ninvestigations into natural phenomena and physical laws liable to become\r\nantiquated, to lose their interest, and to cease to be read.\r\n\r\nLet none who are deeply penetrated with a true and genuine love of\r\nnature, and with a lively appreciation of the true charm and dignity of\r\nthe study of her laws, ever view with discouragement or regret that\r\nwhich is connected with the enlargement of the boundaries of our\r\nknowledge. Many and important portions of this knowledge, both as\r\nregards the phenomena of the celestial spaces and those belonging to our\r\nown planet, are already based on foundations too firm to be lightly\r\nshaken; although in other portions general laws will doubtless take the\r\nplace of those which are more limited in their application, new forces\r\nwill be discovered, and substances considered as simple will be\r\ndecomposed, while others will become known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES HUTTON\r\n\r\nThe Theory of the Earth\r\n\r\n     James Hutton, the notable Scotch geologist, was born at Edinburgh\r\n     on June 3, 1726. In 1743 he was apprenticed to a Writer to the\r\n     Signet; but his apprenticeship was of short duration and in the\r\n     following year he began to study medicine at Edinburgh University,\r\n     and in 1749 graduated as an M.D. Later he determined to study\r\n     agriculture, and went, in 1752, to live with a Norfolk farmer to\r\n     learn practical farming. He did not devote himself entirely to\r\n     agriculture, but gave a considerable amount of his time to chemical\r\n     and geological researches. His geological researches culminated in\r\n     his great work, \"The Theory of the Earth,\" published at Edinburgh\r\n     in 1795. In this work he propounds the theory that the present\r\n     continents have been formed at the bottom of the sea by the\r\n     precipitation of the detritus of former continents, and that the\r\n     precipitate had been hardened by heat and elevated above the sea by\r\n     the expansive power of heat. He died on March 26, 1797. Other works\r\n     are his \"Theory of Rain,\" \"Elements of Agriculture,\" \"Natural\r\n     Philosophy,\" and \"Nature of Coal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Origin and Consolidation of the Land_\r\n\r\nThe solid surface of the earth is mainly composed of gravel, of\r\ncalcareous, and argillaceous strata. Sand is separated by streams and\r\ncurrents, gravel is formed by the attrition of stones agitated in water,\r\nand argillaceous strata are deposited by water containing argillaceous\r\nmaterial. Accordingly, the solid earth would seem to have been mainly\r\nproduced by water, wind, and tides, and this theory is confirmed by the\r\ndiscovery that all the masses of marble and limestone are composed of\r\nthe calcareous matter of marine bodies. All these materials were, in the\r\nfirst place, deposited at the bottom of the sea, and we have to\r\nconsider, firstly, how they were consolidated; and secondly, how they\r\ncame to be dry land, elevated above the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that consolidation may have been effected either through\r\nthe concretion of substances dissolved in water or through fusion by\r\nfire. Consolidation through the concretion of substances dissolved in\r\nthe sea is unlikely, for, in the first place, there are strata, such as\r\nsiliceous matter, which are insoluble, and which could not therefore\r\nhave been in solution; and, in the second place, the appearance of the\r\nstrata is contrary to this supposition. Consolidation was probably\r\neffected by heat and fusion. All the substances in the earth may be\r\nrendered fluid by heat, and all the appearances in the earth's crust are\r\nconsistent with the consolidation and crystallisation of fused\r\nsubstances. Not only so, but we find rents and separations and veins in\r\nthe strata, such as would naturally occur in strata consolidated by the\r\ncooling of fused masses, and other phenomena pointing to fusion by heat.\r\nWe may conclude, then, that all the solid strata of the globe have been\r\nhardened from a state of fusion.\r\n\r\nBut how were these strata raised up from the bottom of the sea and\r\ntransformed into dry land? Even as heat was the consolidating power, so\r\nheat was also probably the elevating power. The power of heat for the\r\nexpansion of bodies is, as we know, unlimited, and the expansive power\r\nof heat was certainly competent to raise the strata above the sea. Heat\r\nwas certainly competent, and if we examine the crust of the earth we\r\nfind evidence that heat was used.\r\n\r\nIf the strata cemented by the heat of fusion were created by the\r\nexpansive power of heat acting from below, we should expect to find\r\nevery species of fracture, dislocation, and contortion in those bodies,\r\nand every degree of departure from a horizontal towards a vertical\r\nposition. And this is just what we do find. From horizontal, the strata\r\nare frequently found vertical; from continuous, broken, and separated in\r\nevery possible direction; and from a plane, bent and doubled. The theory\r\nis confirmed by an examination of the veins and fissures of the earth\r\nwhich contain matter foreign to the strata they traverse, and evidently\r\nforced into them as a fluid under great pressure. Active volcanoes, and\r\nextinct volcanoes, and the marks everywhere of volcanic action likewise\r\nsupport the theory of expansion and elevation by heat. A volcano is not\r\nmade on purpose to frighten superstitious people into fits of piety and\r\ndevotion; it is to be considered as a spiracle of a subterranean\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nSuch being the manner of the formation of the crust of the world, can we\r\nform any judgment of its duration and durability? If we could measure\r\nthe rate of the attrition of the present continents, we might estimate\r\nthe duration of the older continents whose attrition supplied the\r\nmaterial for the present dry land. But as we cannot measure the\r\nwearing-away of the land, we can merely state generally, first, that the\r\npresent dry land required an indefinitely long period for its formation;\r\nsecond, that the previous dry land which supplied material for its\r\nformation required equal time to make; third, that there is at present\r\nland forming at the bottom of the sea which in time will appear above\r\nthe surface; fourth, that we find no vestige of a beginning, or of an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nGranite has in its own nature no claim to originality, for it is found\r\nto vary greatly in its composition. But, further, it is certain that\r\ngranite, or a species of the same kind of stone, is found stratified. It\r\nis the _granit feuilletée_ of M. de Sauffure, and, if I mistake not, is\r\ncalled _gneiss_ by the Germans. Granite being thus found stratified, the\r\nmasses of this stone cannot be allowed to any right of priority over the\r\nschistus, its companion in Alpine countries.\r\n\r\nLack of stratification, then, cannot be considered a proof of primitive\r\nrock. Nor can lack of organized bodies, such as shells, in these rocks,\r\nbe considered a proof; for the traces of organized bodies may be\r\nobliterated by the many subsequent operations of the mineral region. In\r\nany case, signs of organized bodies are sometimes found in \"primitive\"\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nNor can metallic veins, found plentifully in \"primitive\" mountains,\r\nprove anything, for mineral veins are found in various strata.\r\n\r\nWe maintain that _all_ the land was produced from fused substances\r\nelevated from the bottom of the sea. But we do not hold that all parts\r\nof the earth have undergone exactly similar and simultaneous\r\nvicissitudes; and in respect to the changes which various parts of the\r\nland have undergone we may distinguish between primary and secondary\r\nstrata. Nothing is more certain than that there have been several\r\nrepeated operations of the mineralising power exerted upon the strata in\r\nparticular places, and all those mineral operations tend to\r\nconsolidation. It is quite possible that \"primitive\" masses which differ\r\nfrom the ordinary strata of the globe have been twice subjected to\r\nmineral operations, having been first consolidated and raised as land,\r\nand then submerged in order to be again fused and elevated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--The Nature of Mineral Coal_\r\n\r\nMineral, or fossil, coal is a species of stratum distinguished by its\r\ninflammable and combustible nature. We find that it differs in respect\r\nto its purity, and also in respect to its inflammability. As is well\r\nknown, some coals have almost no earthy ash, some a great deal; and,\r\nagain, some coals burn with much smoke and fire, while others burn like\r\ncoke. Where, then, did coal come from, and how can we account for its\r\ndifferent species?\r\n\r\nA substance proper for the formation of coaly matter is found in\r\nvegetable bodies. But how did it become mixed with earthy matter?\r\n\r\nVegetable bodies may be resolved into bituminous or coaly matter either\r\nby means of fire or by means of water. Both may be used by nature in\r\nthe formation of coal.\r\n\r\nBy the force of subterranean heat vegetable matter may have been charred\r\nat the bottom of the sea, and the oleaginous, bituminous, and fuliginous\r\nsubstances diffused through the sea as a result of the burning may have\r\nbeen deposited at the bottom of the sea as coal. Further, the bituminous\r\nmatter from the smoke of vegetable substances burned on land would\r\nultimately be deposited from the atmosphere and settle at the bottom of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nMany of the rivers contain in solution an immense quantity of\r\ninflammable vegetable substance, and this is carried into the sea, and\r\nprecipitated there.\r\n\r\nFrom these two sources, then, the sea gets bituminous material, and this\r\nmaterial, condensed and consolidated by compression and by heat, at the\r\nbottom of the sea, would form a black body of a most uniform structure,\r\nbreaking with a polished surface, and burning with more or less smoke or\r\nflame in proportion as it be distilled less or more by subterranean\r\nheat. And such a body exactly represents our purest fossil coal, which\r\ngives the most heat and leaves the least ash.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the bituminous material in suspension in the sea would be\r\nmixed more or less with argillaceous, calcareous, and other earthy\r\nsubstances; and these being precipitated along with the bituminous\r\nmatter would form layers of impure coal with a considerable amount of\r\nash.\r\n\r\nBut there is still a third source of coal. Vegetable bodies macerated in\r\nwater, and consolidated by compression, form a body almost\r\nindistinguishable from some species of coal, as is seen in peat\r\ncompressed under a great load of earth; and there can be no doubt that\r\ncoal sometimes originates in this way, for much fossil coal shows\r\nabundance of vegetable bodies in its composition.\r\n\r\nThere remains only to consider the change in the disposition of coal\r\nstrata. Coal strata, which had been originally in a horizontal position,\r\nare now found sometimes standing erect, even perpendicular. This, also,\r\nis consistent with our theory of the earth. Indeed, there is not a\r\nsubstance in the mineral kingdom in which the action of subterranean\r\nheat is better shown. These strata are evidently a deposit of\r\ninflammable substances which all come originally from vegetable bodies.\r\nIn this stage of their formation they must all contain volatile\r\noleaginous constituents. But some coal strata contain no volatile\r\nconstituents, and the disappearance of the volatile oleaginous\r\nsubstances must have been produced by distillation, proceeding perhaps\r\nunder the restraining force of immense compression.\r\n\r\nWe cannot doubt that such distillation does take place in the mineral\r\nregions, when we consider that in most places of the earth we find the\r\nevident effects of such distillation in the naphtha and petroleum that\r\nare constantly emitted along with water in certain springs. We have,\r\ntherefore, sufficient proof of this operation of distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--The Disintegration and Dissolution of Land_\r\n\r\nWhether we examine the mountain or the plain, whether we consider the\r\ndisintegration of the rocks or the softer strata of the earth, whether\r\nwe regard the shores of seas or the central plains of continents,\r\nwhether we contemplate fertile lands or deserts, we find evidence of a\r\ngeneral dissolution and decay of the solid surface of the globe. Every\r\ngreat river and deep valley gives evidence of the attrition of the land.\r\nThe purpose of the dry land is to sustain a system of plants and\r\nanimals; and for this purpose a soil is required, and to make a soil the\r\nsolid strata must be crumbled down. The earth is nothing more than an\r\nindefinite number of soils and situations suitable for various animals\r\nand plants, and it must consist of both solid rock and tender earth, of\r\nboth moist and dry districts; for all these are requisite for the world\r\nwe inhabit.\r\n\r\nBut not only is the solid rock crumbling into soil by the action of air\r\nand water, but the soil gradually progresses towards the sea, and sooner\r\nor later the sea must swallow up the land. Vegetation and masses of\r\nsolid rock retard the seaward flow of the soil; but they merely retard,\r\nthey cannot wholly prevent. In proportion as the mountains are\r\ndiminished, the haugh, or plain, between them grows more wide, and also\r\non a lower level; but while there is a river running on a plain, and\r\nfloods produced in the seasons of rain, there is nothing stable in the\r\nconstitution of the surface of the land.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the earth which I propound is founded upon the great\r\ncatastrophes that can happen to the earth. It supposes strata raised\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea and elevated into mountainous continents.\r\nBut, between the catastrophes, it requires nothing further than the\r\nordinary everyday effects of air and water. Every shower of rain, every\r\nstream, participates in the dissolution of the land, and helps to\r\ntransport to the sea the material for future continents.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious waste of the land we see in places has seemed to some to\r\nrequire some other explanation; but I maintain that the natural\r\noperations of air and water would suffice in time to produce the effects\r\nobserved. It is true that the wastage would be slow; but slow\r\ndestruction of rock with gradual formation of soil is just what is\r\nrequired in the economy of nature. A world sustaining plants and animals\r\nrequires continents which endure for more than a day.\r\n\r\nIf this continent of land, first collected in the sea, is to remain a\r\nhabitable earth, and to resist the moving waters of the globe, certain\r\ndegrees of solidity or consolidation must be given to that collection of\r\nloose materials; and certain degrees of hardness must be given to\r\nbodies which are soft and incoherent, and consequently so extremely\r\nperishable in the situation in which they are now placed.\r\n\r\nBut, at the same time that this earth must have solidity and hardness to\r\nresist the sudden changes which its moving fluids would occasion, it\r\nmust be made subject to decay and waste upon the surface exposed to the\r\natmosphere; for such an earth as were made incapable of change, or not\r\nsubject to decay, would not afford that fertile soil which is required\r\nin the system of this world--a soil on which depends the growth of\r\nplants and life of animals--the end of its intention.\r\n\r\nNow, we find this earth endued precisely with such degree of hardness\r\nand consolidation as qualifies it at the same time to be a fruitful\r\nearth, and to maintain its station with all the permanency compatible\r\nwith the nature of things, which are not formed to remain unchangeable.\r\n\r\nThus we have a view of the most perfect wisdom in the contrivance of\r\nthat constitution by which the earth is made to answer, in the best\r\nmanner possible, the purpose of its intention, that is, to maintain and\r\nperpetuate a system of vegetation, or the various races of useful\r\nplants, or a system of living animals, which are in their turn\r\nsubservient to a system still infinitely more important--I mean a system\r\nof intellect. Without fertility in the earth, many races of plants and\r\nanimals would soon perish, or be extinct; and with permanency in our\r\nland it were impossible for the various tribes of plants and animals to\r\nbe dispersed over the surface of a changing earth. The fact is that\r\nfertility, adequate to the various ends in view, is found in all the\r\nquarters of the world, or in every country of the earth; and the\r\npermanency of our land is such as to make it appear unalterable to\r\nmankind in general and even to impose upon men of science, who have\r\nendeavoured to persuade us that this earth is not to change.\r\n\r\nNothing but supreme power and wisdom could have reconciled those two\r\nopposite ends of intention, so as both to be equally pursued in the\r\nsystem of nature, and so equally attained as to be imperceptible to\r\ncommon observation, and at the same time a proper object of the human\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMARCK\r\n\r\nZoological Philosophy\r\n\r\n     Jean Baptiste de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck, was born in Picardy,\r\n     France, Aug. I, 1744, the cadet of an ancient but impoverished\r\n     house. It was his father's desire that he should enter the Church,\r\n     but his inclination was for a military life; and having, at the age\r\n     of seventeen, joined the French army under De Broglie, he had\r\n     within twenty-four hours the good fortune so to distinguish himself\r\n     as to win his commission. When the Museum of Natural History was\r\n     brought into existence in 1794 he was sufficiently well-known as a\r\n     naturalist to be entrusted with the care of the collections of\r\n     invertebrates, comprising insects, molluscs, polyps, and worms.\r\n     Here he continued to lecture until his death in 1829. Haeckel,\r\n     classifying him in the front rank with Goethe and Darwin,\r\n     attributes to him \"the imperishable glory of having been the first\r\n     to raise the theory of descent to the rank of an independent\r\n     scientific theory.\" The form of his theory was announced in 1801,\r\n     but was not given in detail to the world until 1809, by the\r\n     publication of his \"Zoological Philosophy\" (\"Philosophie\r\n     Zoologique\"). The Lamarckian theory of the hereditary transmission\r\n     of characters acquired by use, disuse, etc., has still a following,\r\n     though it is controverted by the schools of Darwin and Weissmann.\r\n     Lamarck died on December 18, 1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--The Ladder of Life_\r\n\r\nIf we look backwards down the ladder of animal forms we find a\r\nprogressive degradation in the organisation of the creatures comprised;\r\nthe organisation of their bodies becomes simpler, the number of their\r\nfaculties less. This well-recognised fact throws a light upon the order\r\nin which nature has produced the animals; but it leaves unexplained the\r\nfact that this gradation, though sustained, is irregular. The reason\r\nwill become clear if we consider the effects produced by the infinite\r\ndiversity of conditions in different parts of the globe upon the\r\ngeneral form, the limbs, and the very organisation of the animals in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIt will, in fact, be evident that the state in which we find all animals\r\nis the product, on the one hand, of the growing composition of the\r\norganisation which tends to form a regular gradation; and that, for the\r\nrest, it results from a multitude of circumstances which tend\r\ncontinually to destroy the regularity of the gradation in the\r\nincreasingly composite nature of the organism.\r\n\r\nNot that circumstances can effect any modification directly. But changed\r\ncircumstances produce changed wants, changed wants changed actions. If\r\nthe new wants become constant the animals acquire new habits, which are\r\nno less constant than the wants which gave rise to them. And such new\r\nhabits will necessitate the use of one member rather than another, or\r\neven the cessation of the use of a member which has lost its utility.\r\n\r\nWe will look at some familiar examples of either case. Among vegetables,\r\nwhich have no actions, and therefore no habits properly so called, great\r\ndifferences in the development of the parts do none the less arise as a\r\nconsequence of changed circumstances; and these differences cause the\r\ndevelopment of certain of them, while they attenuate others and cause\r\nthem to disappear. But all this is caused by changes in the nutrition of\r\nthe plant, in its absorptions and transpirations, in the quantity of\r\nheat and light, of air and moisture, which it habitually receives; and,\r\nlastly, by the superiority which certain of its vital movements may\r\nassert over the others. There may arise between individuals of the same\r\nspecies, of which some are placed in favourable, others amid\r\nunfavourable, conditions, a difference which by degrees becomes very\r\nnotable.\r\n\r\nSuppose that circumstances keep certain individuals in an ill-nourished\r\nor languid state. Their internal organisation will at length be\r\nmodified, and these individuals will engender offspring which will\r\nperpetuate the modifications thus acquired, and thus will in the end\r\ngive place to a race quite distinct from that of which the individual\r\nmembers come together always under circumstances favourable to their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if a seed of some meadow flower is carried to dry and\r\nstony ground, where it is exposed to the winds and there germinates, the\r\nconsequence will be that the plant and its immediate offspring, being\r\nalways ill-nourished, will give rise to a race really different from\r\nthat which lives in the field; yet this, none the less, will be its\r\nprogenitor. The individuals of this race will be dwarfed; and their\r\norgans, some being increased at the expense of the rest, will show\r\ndistinctive proportions. What nature does in a long time we do every day\r\nourselves. Every botanist knows that the vegetables transplanted to our\r\ngardens out of their native soil undergo such changes as render them at\r\nlast unrecognisable.\r\n\r\nConsider, again, the varieties among our domestic fowls and pigeons, all\r\nof them brought into existence by being raised in diverse circumstances\r\nand different countries, and such as might be sought in vain in a state\r\nof nature. It is matter of common knowledge that if we raise a bird in a\r\ncage, and keep it there for five or six years, it will be unable to fly\r\nif restored to liberty. There has, indeed, been no change as yet in the\r\nform of its members; but if for a long series of generations individuals\r\nof the same race had been kept caged for a considerable time, there is\r\nno room for doubt that the very form of their limbs would little by\r\nlittle have undergone notable alteration. Much more would this be the\r\ncase if their captivity had been accompanied by a marked change of\r\nclimate, and if these individuals had by degrees accustomed themselves\r\nto other sorts of food and to other measures for acquiring it. Such\r\ncircumstances, taken constantly together, would have formed insensibly a\r\nnew and clearly denned race.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows, in regard to plants, how the change of\r\nsome important circumstance may tend to change the various parts of\r\nthese living bodies.\r\n\r\nSo long as the _ranunculus aquatilis_, the water buttercup, is under\r\nwater its leaves are all finely indented, and the divisions are\r\nfurnished with capillaries; but as soon as the stalk of the plant\r\nreaches the surface the leaves, which develop in the air, are broadened\r\nout, rounded, and simply lobed. If the plant manages to spring up in a\r\nsoil that is merely moist, and not covered with water, the stems will be\r\nshort, and none of the leaves will show these indentations and\r\ncapillaries. You have then the _ranunculus hederaceus_, which botanists\r\nregard as a distinct species.\r\n\r\nAmong animals changes take place more slowly, and it is therefore more\r\ndifficult to determine their cause. The strongest influence, no doubt,\r\nis that of environment. Places far apart are different, and--which is\r\ntoo commonly ignored--a given place changes its climate and quality with\r\ntime, though so slowly in respect of human life that we attribute to it\r\nperfect stability. Hence it arises that we have not only extreme\r\nchanges, but also shadowy ones between the extremes.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the order of things changes so gradually that man cannot\r\nobserve the change directly, and the animal tribes in every place\r\npreserve their habits for a long time; whence arises the apparent\r\nconstancy of what we call species--a constancy which has given birth in\r\nus to the idea that these races are as old as nature.\r\n\r\nBut the surface of the habitable globe varies in nature, situation, and\r\nclimate, in every variety of degrees. The naturalist will perceive that\r\njust in proportion as the environment is notably changed will the\r\nspecies change their characters.\r\n\r\nIt must always be recognised:\r\n\r\n(1) That every considerable and constant change in the environment of a\r\nrace of animals works a real change in their wants.\r\n\r\n(2) That every change in their wants necessitates new actions to supply\r\nthem, and consequently new habits.\r\n\r\n(3) That every new want calling for new actions for its satisfaction\r\naffects the animal in one of two ways. Either it has to make more\r\nfrequent use of some particular member, and this will develop the part\r\nand cause it to increase in size; or it must employ new members which\r\nwill grow in the animal insensibly in response to the inward yearning to\r\nsatisfy these wants. And this I will presently prove from known facts.\r\n\r\nHow the new wants have been able to attain satisfaction, and how the new\r\nhabits have been acquired, it will be easy to see if regard be had to\r\nthe two following laws, which observation has always confirmed.\r\n\r\n     FIRST LAW.--In every animal which has not arrived at the term of\r\n     its developments, the more frequent and sustained use of any organ\r\n     strengthens, develops, and enlarges that organ, and gives it a\r\n     power commensurate with the duration of this employment of it. On\r\n     the other hand, constant disuse of such organ weakens it by\r\n     degrees, causes it to deteriorate, and progressively diminishes its\r\n     faculties, so that in the end it disappears.\r\n\r\n     SECOND LAW.--All qualities naturally acquired by individuals as the\r\n     result of circumstances to which their race is exposed for a\r\n     considerable time, or as a consequence of a predominant employment\r\n     or the disuse of a certain organ, nature preserves to individual\r\n     offspring; provided that the acquired modifications are common to\r\n     the two sexes, or, at least, to both parents of the individual\r\n     offspring.\r\n\r\nNaturalists have observed that the members of animals are adapted to\r\ntheir use, and thence have concluded hitherto that the formation of the\r\nmembers has led to their appropriate employment. Now, this is an error.\r\nFor observation plainly shows that, on the contrary, the development of\r\nthe members has been caused by their need and use; that these have\r\ncaused them to come into existence where they were wanting.\r\n\r\nBut let us examine the facts which bear upon the effects of employment\r\nor disuse of organs resulting from the habits which a race has been\r\ncompelled to form.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--The Penalties of Disuse_\r\n\r\nPermanent disuse of an organ as a consequence of acquired habits\r\ngradually impoverishes it, and in the end causes it to disappear, or\r\neven annihilates it altogether.\r\n\r\nThus vertebrates, which, in spite of innumerable particular\r\ndistinctions, are alike in the plan of their organisation, are generally\r\narmed with teeth. Yet those of them which by circumstances have acquired\r\nthe habit of swallowing their prey without mastication have been liable\r\nto leave their teeth undeveloped. Consequently, the teeth have either\r\nremained hidden between the bony plates of the jaws, or have even been,\r\nin the course of time, annihilated.\r\n\r\nThe whale was supposed to have no teeth at all till M. Geoffrey found\r\nthem hidden in the jaws of the foetus. He has also found in birds the\r\ngroove in which teeth might be placed, but without any trace of the\r\nteeth themselves. A similar case to that of the whale is the ant-eater\r\n(_nyomecophaga_), which has long given up the practice of mastication.\r\n\r\nEyes in the head are an essential part of the organisation of\r\nvertebrates. Yet the mole, which habitually makes no use of the sense of\r\nsight, has eyes so small that they can hardly be seen; and the aspalax,\r\nwhose habits-resemble a mole's, has totally lost its sight, and shows\r\nbut vestiges of eyes. So also the proteus, which inhabits dark caves\r\nunder water.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, since the animals in question belong to a type of which\r\neyes are an essential part, it is clear that the impoverishment, and\r\neven the total disappearance, of these organs are the results of long\r\ncontinued disuse.\r\n\r\nWith hearing, the case is otherwise. Sound traverses everything.\r\nTherefore, wherever an animal dwells it may exercise this faculty. And\r\nso no vertebrate lacks it, and we never find it re-appearing in any of\r\nthe lower ranges. Sight disappears, re-appears, and disappears again,\r\naccording as circumstances deny or permit its exercise.\r\n\r\nFour legs attached to its skeleton are part of the reptile type; and\r\nserpents, particularly as between them and the fishes come the\r\nbatrachians--frogs, etc.--ought to have four legs.\r\n\r\nBut serpents, having acquired the habit of gliding along the ground, and\r\nconcealing themselves amid the grass, their bodies, as a consequence of\r\nconstantly repeated efforts to lengthen themselves out in order to pass\r\nthrough narrow passages, have acquired considerable length of body which\r\nis out of all proportion to their breadth.\r\n\r\nNow, feet would have been useless to these animals, and consequently\r\nwould have remained unemployed; for long legs would have interfered with\r\ntheir desire to go on their bellies; and short legs, being limited in\r\nnumber to four, would have been incapable of moving their bodies. Thus\r\ntotal disuse among these races of animals has caused the parts which\r\nhave fallen into disuse totally to disappear.\r\n\r\nMany insects, which by their order and genus should have wings, lack\r\nthem more or less completely for similar reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--The Advantages of Use_\r\n\r\nThe frequent use of an organ, if constant and habitual, increases its\r\npowers, develops it, and makes it acquire dimensions and potency such\r\nas are not found among animals which use it less.\r\n\r\nOf this principle, the web-feet of some birds, the long legs and neck of\r\nthe stork, are examples. Similarly, the elongated tongue of the\r\nant-eater, and those of lizards and serpents.\r\n\r\nSuch wants, and the sustained efforts to satisfy them, have also\r\nresulted in the displacement of organs. Fishes which swim habitually in\r\ngreat masses of water, since they need to see right and left of them,\r\nhave the eyes one upon either side of the head. Their bodies, more or\r\nless flat, according to species, have their edges perpendicular to the\r\nplane of the water; and their eyes are so placed as to be one on either\r\nside of the flattened body. But those whose habits bring them constantly\r\nto the banks, especially sloping banks, have been obliged to lie over\r\nupon the flattened surface in order to approach more nearly. In this\r\nposition, in which more light falls on the upper than on the under\r\nsurface, and their attention is more particularly fixed upon what is\r\ngoing on above than on what is going on below them, this want has forced\r\none of the eyes to undergo a kind of displacement, and to keep the\r\nstrange position which it occupies in the head of a sole or a turbot.\r\nThe situation is not symmetrical because the mutation is not complete.\r\nIn the case of the skate, however, it is complete; for in these fish the\r\ntransverse flattening of the body is quite horizontal, no less than that\r\nof the head. And so the eyes of a skate are not only placed both of them\r\non the upper surface, but have become symmetrical.\r\n\r\nSerpents need principally to see things above them, and, in response to\r\nthis need, the eyes are placed so high up at the sides of the head that\r\nthey can see easily what is above them on either side, while they can\r\nsee in front of them but a very little distance. To compensate for this,\r\nthe tongue, with which they test bodies in their line of march, has been\r\nrendered by this habit thin, long, and very contractile, and even, in\r\nmost species, has been split so as to be able to test more than one\r\nobject at a time. The same custom has resulted similarly in the\r\nformation of an opening at the end of the muzzle by which the tongue may\r\nbe protruded without any necessity for the opening of the jaws.\r\n\r\nThe effect of use is curiously illustrated in the form and figure of the\r\ngiraffe. This animal, the largest of mammals, is found in the interior\r\nof Africa, where the ground is scorched and destitute of grass, and has\r\nto browse on the foliage of trees. From the continual stretching thus\r\nnecessitated over a great space of time in all the individuals of the\r\nrace, it has resulted that the fore legs have become longer than the\r\nhind legs, and that the neck has become so elongated that the giraffe,\r\nwithout standing on its hind legs, can raise its head to a height of\r\nnearly twenty feet. Observation of all animals will furnish similar\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nNone, perhaps, is more striking than that of the kangaroo. This animal,\r\nwhich carries its young in an abdominal pouch, has acquired the habit of\r\ncarrying itself upright upon its hind legs and tail, and of moving from\r\nplace to place in a series of leaps, during which, in order not to hurt\r\nits little ones, it preserves its upright posture. Observe the result.\r\n\r\n(1) Its front limbs, which it uses very little, resting on them only in\r\nthe instant during which it quits its erect posture, have never acquired\r\na development in proportion to the other parts; they have remained thin,\r\nlittle, and weak.\r\n\r\n(2) The hind legs, almost continually in action, whether to bear the\r\nweight of the whole body or to execute its leaps, have, on the contrary,\r\nobtained a considerable development; they are very big and very strong.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, the tail, which we observe to be actively employed, both to\r\nsupport the animal's weight and to execute its principal movements, has\r\nacquired at its base a thickness and a strength that are extremely\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nWhen the will determines an animal to a certain action, the organs\r\nconcerned are forthwith stimulated by a flow of subtle fluids, which are\r\nthe determining cause of organic changes and developments. And\r\nmultiplied repetitions of such acts strengthen, extend, and even call\r\ninto being the organs necessary to them. Now, every change in an organ\r\nwhich has been acquired by habitual use sufficient to originate it is\r\nreproduced in the offspring if it is common to both the individuals\r\nwhich have come together for the reproduction of their species. In the\r\nend, this change is propagated and passes to all the individuals which\r\ncome after and are submitted to the same conditions, without its being\r\nnecessary that they should acquire it in the original manner.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, in the union of disparate couples, the disparity is\r\nnecessarily opposed to the constant propagation of such qualities and\r\noutward forms. This is why man, who is exposed to such diversity of\r\nconditions, does not preserve and propagate the qualities or the\r\naccidental defects which he has been in the way of acquiring. Such\r\npeculiarities will be produced only in case two individuals who share\r\nthem unite; these will produce offspring bearing similar\r\ncharacteristics, and, if successive generations restrict themselves to\r\nsimilar unions, a distinct race will then be formed. But perpetual\r\nintermixture will cause all characters acquired through particular\r\ncircumstances to disappear. If it were not for the distances which\r\nseparate the races of men, such intermixture would quickly obliterate\r\nall national distinctions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--The Conclusion_\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the conclusion to which we have come. It is a fact that\r\nevery genus and species of animal has its characteristic habits combined\r\nwith an organisation perfectly in harmony with them. From the\r\nconsideration of this fact one of two conclusions must follow, and that\r\nthough neither of them can be proved.\r\n\r\n(1) The conclusion admitted hitherto--that nature (or its Author) in\r\ncreating the animals has foreseen all the possible sets of circumstances\r\nin which they would have to live, has given to each species a constant\r\norganisation, and has shaped its parts in a determined and invariable\r\nway so that every species is compelled to live in the districts and the\r\nclimates where it is actually formed, and to keep the habits by which it\r\nis actually known.\r\n\r\n(2) My own conclusion--that nature has produced in succession all the\r\nanimal species, beginning with the more imperfect, or the simpler, and\r\nending with the more perfect; that in so doing it has gradually\r\ncomplicated their organisation; and that of these animals, dispersed\r\nover the habitable globe, every species has acquired, under the\r\ninfluence of the circumstances amid which it is found, the habits and\r\nmodifications of form which we associate with it.\r\n\r\nTo prove that the second of these hypotheses is unfounded, it will be\r\nnecessary, first, to prove that the surface of the globe never varies in\r\ncharacter, in exposure, situation, whether elevated or sheltered,\r\nclimate, etc.; and, secondly, to prove that no part of the animal world\r\nundergoes, even in the course of long periods of time, any modification\r\nthrough change of circumstances, or as a consequence of a changed manner\r\nof life and action.\r\n\r\nNow, a single fact which establishes that an animal, after a long period\r\nof domestication, differs from the wild stock from which it derives, and\r\nthat among the various domesticated members of a species may be found\r\ndifferences no less marked between individuals which, have been\r\nsubjected to one use and those which have been subjected to another,\r\nmakes it certain that the former conclusion is not consistent with the\r\nlaws of nature, and that the second is.\r\n\r\nEverything, therefore, concurs to prove my assertion, to wit--that it is\r\nnot form, whether of the body or of the parts, which gives rise to the\r\nhabits of animals and their manner of life; but that, on the contrary,\r\nin the habits, the manner of living, and all the other circumstances of\r\nenvironment, we have those things which in the course of time have built\r\nup animal bodies with all their members. With new forms new faculties\r\nhave been acquired, and little by little nature has come to shape\r\nanimals and all living things in their present forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHANN LAVATER\r\n\r\nPhysiognomical Fragments\r\n\r\n     Johann Caspar Lavater, the Swiss theologian, poet, and\r\n     physiognomist, was born at Zürich on November 15, 1741. He began\r\n     his public life at the age of twenty-one as a political reformer.\r\n     Five years later he appeared as a poet, and published a volume of\r\n     poetry which was very favourably received. During the next five\r\n     years he produced a religious work, which was considered heretical,\r\n     although its mystic, religious enthusiasm appealed to a\r\n     considerable audience. His fame, however, rests neither on his\r\n     poetry nor on his theology, but on his physiognomical studies,\r\n     published in four volumes between 1775-78 under the title\r\n     \"Physiognomical Fragments for the Advancement of Human Knowledge\r\n     and Human Life\" (\"Physiognomische Fragmente zur Beförderung des\r\n     Menschenkenntniss und Menschenliebe\"). The book is diffuse and\r\n     inconsequent, but it contains many shrewd observations with respect\r\n     to physiognomy and has had no little influence on popular opinion\r\n     in this matter. Lavater died on January 2, 1801.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--The Truth of Physiognomy_\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of the truth of physiognomy. All countenances, all\r\nforms, all created beings, are not only different from each other in\r\ntheir classes, races, kinds, but are also individually distinct. It is\r\nindisputable that all men estimate all things whatever by their external\r\ntemporary superficies--that is to say, by their physiognomy. Is not all\r\nnature physiognomy, superficies and contents, body and spirit, external\r\neffect and internal power? There is not a man who does not judge of all\r\nthings that pass through his hands by their physiognomy--there is not a\r\nman who does not more or less, the first time he is in company with a\r\nstranger, observe, estimate, compare, judge him according to\r\nappearances. When each apple, each apricot, has a physiognomy peculiar\r\nto itself, shall man, the lord of the earth, have none?\r\n\r\nMan is the most perfect of all earthly creatures. In no other creature\r\nare so wonderfully united the animal, the intellectual, and the moral.\r\nAnd man's organisation peculiarly distinguishes him from all other\r\nbeings, and shows him to be infinitely superior to all those other\r\nvisible organisms by which he is surrounded. His head, especially his\r\nface, convinces the accurate observer, who is capable of investigating\r\ntruth, of the greatness and superiority of his intellectual qualities.\r\nThe eye, the expression, the cheeks, the mouth, the forehead, whether\r\nconsidered in a state of entire rest, or during their innumerable\r\nvarieties of motion--in fine, whatever is understood by physiognomy--are\r\nthe most expressive, the most convincing picture of interior sensations,\r\ndesires, passions, will, and of all those properties which so much exalt\r\nmoral above animal life.\r\n\r\nAlthough the physiological, intellectual, and moral are united in man,\r\nyet it is plain that each of these has its peculiar station where it\r\nmore especially unfolds itself and acts.\r\n\r\nIt is, beyond contradiction, evident that, though physiological or\r\nanimal life displays itself through all the body, and especially through\r\nall the animal parts, yet it acts more conspicuously in the arm, from\r\nthe shoulder to the ends of the fingers.\r\n\r\nIt is not less evident that intellectual life, or the powers of the\r\nunderstanding and the mind, make themselves most apparent in the\r\ncircumference and form of the solid parts of the head, especially the\r\nforehead; though they will discover themselves to the attentive and\r\naccurate eye in every part and point of the human body, by the\r\ncongeniality and harmony of the various parts. Is there any occasion to\r\nprove that the power of thinking resides not in the foot, nor in the\r\nhand, nor in the back, but in the head and its internal parts?\r\n\r\nThe moral life of man particularly reveals itself in the lines, marks,\r\nand transitions of the countenance. His moral powers and desires, his\r\nirritability, sympathy, and antipathy, his facility of attracting or\r\nrepelling the objects that surround him--these are all summed up in, and\r\npainted upon, his countenance when at rest.\r\n\r\nNot only do mental and moral traits evince themselves in the\r\nphysiognomy, but also health and sickness; and I believe that by\r\nrepeatedly examining the firm parts and outlines of the bodies and\r\ncountenances of the sick, disease might be diagnosed, and even that\r\nliability to disease might be predicted in particular cases.\r\n\r\nThe same vital powers that make the heart beat and the fingers move,\r\nroof the skull and arch the finger-nails. From the head to the back,\r\nfrom the shoulder to the arm, from the arm to the hand, from the hand to\r\nthe finger, each depends on the other, and all on a determinate effect\r\nof a determinate power. Through all nature each determinate power is\r\nproductive of only such and such determinate effects. The finger of one\r\nbody is not adapted to the hand of another body. The blood in the\r\nextremity of the finger has the character of the blood in the heart. The\r\nsame congeniality is found in the nerves and in the bones. One spirit\r\nlives in all. Each member of the body, too, is in proportion to the\r\nwhole of which it is a part. As from the length of the smallest member,\r\nthe smallest joint of the finger, the proportion of the whole, the\r\nlength and breadth of the body may be found; so also may the form of the\r\nwhole be found from the form of each single part. When the head is long,\r\nall is long; when the head is round, all is round; when the head is\r\nsquare, all is square.\r\n\r\nOne form, one mind, one root appertain to all. Each organised body is so\r\nmuch a whole that, without discord, destruction, or deformity, nothing\r\ncan be added or subtracted. Those, therefore, who maintain that\r\nconclusion cannot be drawn from a part to the whole labour under error,\r\nfailing to comprehend the harmony of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Physiognomy and the Features_\r\n\r\nThe Forehead. The form, height, arching, proportion, obliquity, and\r\nposition of the skull, or bone of the forehead, show the propensity of\r\nthought, power of thought, and sensibility of man. The position, colour,\r\nwrinkles, tension of the skin of the forehead, show the passions and\r\npresent state of the mind. The bones indicate the power, the skin the\r\napplication of power.\r\n\r\nI consider the outline and position of the forehead to be the most\r\nimportant feature in physiognomy. We may divide foreheads into three\r\nprincipal classes--the retreating, the perpendicular, and the\r\nprojecting, and each of these classes has a multitude of variations.\r\n\r\nA few facts with respect to foreheads may now be given.\r\n\r\nThe higher the forehead, the more comprehension and the less activity.\r\n\r\nThe more compressed, short, and firm the forehead, the more compression\r\nand firmness, and the less volatility in the man.\r\n\r\nThe more curved and cornerless the outline, the more tender and flexible\r\nthe character; and the more rectilinear, the more pertinacious and\r\nsevere the character.\r\n\r\nPerfect perpendicularity implies lack of understanding, but gently\r\narched at top, capacity for cold, tranquil, profound thought.\r\n\r\nA projecting forehead indicates imbecility, immaturity, weakness,\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\nA retreating forehead, in general, denotes superior imagination, wit,\r\nacuteness.\r\n\r\nA forehead round and prominent above, straight below, and, on the whole,\r\nperpendicular, shows much understanding, life, sensibility, ardour.\r\n\r\nAn oblique, rectilinear forehead is ardent and vigorous.\r\n\r\nArched foreheads appear properly to be feminine.\r\n\r\nA forehead neither too perpendicular nor too retreating, but a happy\r\nmean, indicates the post-perfect character of wisdom.\r\n\r\nI might also state it as an axiom that straight lines considered as\r\nsuch, and curves considered as such, are related as power and weakness,\r\nobstinacy and flexibility, understanding and sensation.\r\n\r\nI have seen no man with sharp, projecting eyebones who was not inclined\r\nto vigorous thinking and wise planning.\r\n\r\nYet, even lacking sharpness, a head may be excellent if the forehead\r\nsink like a perpendicular wall upon horizontal eyebrows, and be greatly\r\nrounded towards the temples.\r\n\r\nPerpendicular foreheads, projecting so as not to rest immediately upon\r\nthe nose, and small, wrinkled, short, and shining, indicate little\r\nimagination, little understanding, little sensation.\r\n\r\nForeheads with many angular, knotty protuberances denote perseverance\r\nand much vigorous, firm, harsh, oppressive, ardent activity.\r\n\r\nIt is a sure sign of a clear, sound understanding and a good temperament\r\nwhen the profile of the forehead has two proportionate arches, the lower\r\nof which projects.\r\n\r\nEyebones with well-marked, firm arches I never saw but in noble and\r\ngreat men.\r\n\r\nSquare foreheads with extensive temples and firm eyebones show\r\ncircumspection and steadiness of character.\r\n\r\nPerpendicular wrinkles, if natural, denote application and power.\r\nHorizontal wrinkles and those broken in the middle or at the extremities\r\ngenerally denote negligence or want of power.\r\n\r\nPerpendicular, deep indentings in the forehead between the eyebrows, I\r\nnever met save in men of sound understanding and free and noble minds,\r\nunless there were some positively contradictory feature.\r\n\r\nA blue frontal vein, in the form of a Y, when in an open, smooth,\r\nwell-arched forehead, I have only found in men of extraordinary talents\r\nand of ardent and generous character.\r\n\r\nThe following are the traits of a perfectly beautiful, intelligent, and\r\nnoble forehead.\r\n\r\nIn length it must equal the nose, or the under part of the face. In\r\nbreadth it must be either oval at the top-like the foreheads of most of\r\nthe great men of England--or nearly square. It must be free from\r\nunevenness and wrinkles, yet be able to wrinkle when deep in thought,\r\nafflicted by pain, or moved by indignation. It must retreat above and\r\nproject beneath. The eyebones must be simple, horizontal, and, if seen\r\nfrom above, must present a simple curve. There should be a small cavity\r\nin the centre, from above to below, and traversing the forehead so as to\r\nseparate it into four divisions perceptible in a clear descending light.\r\nThe skin must be more clear on the forehead than in other parts of the\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nForeheads short, wrinkled, and knotty, are incapable of durable\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nBe not discouraged though a friend, an enemy, a child, or a brother\r\ntransgress, for so long as he have a good, well-proportioned, open\r\nforehead there is still hope of improvement.\r\n\r\nTHE EYES AND EYEBROWS. Blue eyes are generally more indicative of\r\nweakness and effeminacy than brown or black. Certainly there are many\r\npowerful men with blue eyes, but I find more strength, manhood, thought\r\nwith brown.\r\n\r\nCholeric men have eyes of every colour, but rather brown or greenish\r\nthan blue. A propensity to green is an almost decisive token of ardour,\r\nfire, and courage.\r\n\r\nWide open eyes, with the white visible, I have often observed both in\r\nthe timid and phlegmatic, and in the courageous and rash.\r\n\r\nMeeting eyebrows were supposed to be the mark of craft, but I do not\r\nbelieve them to have this significance. Angular, strong, interrupted\r\neyebrows denote fire and productive activity. The nearer the eyebrows to\r\nthe eyes, the more earnest, deep, and firm the character. Eyebrows\r\nremote from each other denote warm, open, quick sensations. White\r\neyebrows signify weakness; and dark brown, firmness. The motion of the\r\neyebrows contains numerous expressions, especially of ignoble passions.\r\n\r\nTHE NOSE. I have generally considered the nose the foundation or\r\nabutment of the brain, for upon this the whole power of the arch of the\r\nforehead rests. A beautiful nose will never be found accompanying an\r\nugly countenance. An ugly person may have fine eyes, but not a handsome\r\nnose.\r\n\r\nI have never seen a nose with a broad back, whether arched or\r\nrectilinear, that did not belong to an extraordinary man. Such a nose\r\nwas possessed by Swift, Cæsar Borgia, Titian, etc. Small nostrils are\r\nusually an indubitable sign of unenterprising timidity. The open,\r\nbreathing nostril is as certain a token of sensibility.\r\n\r\nTHE MOUTH AND LIPS. The contents of the mind are communicated to the\r\nmouth. How full of character is the mouth! As are the lips, so is the\r\ncharacter. Firm lips, firm character; weak lips, weak character.\r\nWell-defined, large, and proportionate lips, the middle line of which is\r\nequally serpentine on both sides, and easy to be drawn, are never seen\r\nin a bad, mean, common, false, vicious countenance. A lipless mouth,\r\nresembling a single line, denotes coldness, industry, a love of order,\r\nprecision, house-wifery, and, if it be drawn upwards at the two ends,\r\naffectation, pretension, vanity, malice. Very fleshy lips have always to\r\ncontend with sensuality and indolence. Calm lips, well closed, without\r\nconstraint, and well delineated, certainly betoken consideration,\r\ndiscretion, and firmness. Openness of mouth speaks complaint, and\r\ncloseness, endurance.\r\n\r\nTHE CHIN. From numerous experiments, I am convinced that the projecting\r\nchin ever denotes something positive, and the retreating something\r\nnegative. The presence or absence of strength in man is often signified\r\nby the chin.\r\n\r\nI have never seen sharp indentings in the middle of the chin save in men\r\nof cool understanding, unless when something evidently contradictory\r\nappeared in the countenance. The soft, fat, double chin generally points\r\nout the epicure; and the angular chin is seldom found save in discreet,\r\nwell-disposed, firm men. Flatness of chin speaks the cold and dry;\r\nsmallness, fear; and roundness, with a dimple, benevolence.\r\n\r\nSKULLS. HOW much may the anatomist see in the mere skull of man! How\r\nmuch more the physiognomist! And how much more still the anatomist who\r\nis a physiognomist! If shown the bald head of Cæsar, as painted by\r\nRubens or Titian or Michael Angelo, what man would fail to notice the\r\nrocky capacity which characterises it, and to realise that more ardour\r\nand energy must be expected than from a smooth, round, flat head? How\r\ncharacteristic is the skull of Charles XII.! How different from the\r\nskull of his biographer Voltaire! Compare the skull of Judas with the\r\nskull of Christ, after Holbein, and I doubt whether anyone would fail to\r\nguess which is the skull of the wicked betrayer and which the skull of\r\nthe innocent betrayed. And who is unacquainted with the statement in\r\nHerodotus that it was possible on the field of battle to distinguish the\r\nskulls of the effeminate Medes from the skulls of the manly Persians?\r\nEach nation, indeed, has its own characteristic skull.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Nation, Sex, and Family_\r\n\r\nNATIONAL PHYSIOGNOMY. It is undeniable that there is a national\r\nphysiognomy as well as national character. Compare a negro and an\r\nEnglishman, a native of Lapland and an Italian, a Frenchman and an\r\ninhabitant of Tierra del Fuego. Examine their forms, countenances,\r\ncharacters, and minds. This difference will be easily seen, though it\r\nwill sometimes be very difficult to describe it scientifically.\r\n\r\nThe following infinitely little is what I have hitherto observed in the\r\nforeigners with whom I have conversed.\r\n\r\nI am least able to characterise the French, They have no traits so bold\r\nas the English, nor so minute as the Germans. I know them chiefly by\r\ntheir teeth and their laugh. The Italians I discover by the nose, small\r\neyes, and projecting chin. The English by their foreheads and eyebrows.\r\nThe Dutch by the rotundity of their heads and the weakness of the hair.\r\nThe Germans by the angles and wrinkles round the eyes and in the cheeks.\r\nThe Russians by the snub nose and their light-coloured or black hair.\r\n\r\nI shall now say a word concerning Englishmen in particular. Englishmen\r\nhave the shortest and best-arched foreheads--that is to say, they are\r\narched only upwards, and, towards the eyebrows, either gently recline or\r\nare rectilinear. They seldom have pointed, usually round, full noses.\r\nTheir lips are usually large, well defined, beautifully curved. Their\r\nchins are round and full. The outline of their faces is in general\r\nlarge, and they never have those numerous angles and wrinkles by which\r\nthe Germans are so especially distinguished. Their complexion is fairer\r\nthan that of the Germans.\r\n\r\nAll Englishwomen whom I have known personally, or by portrait, appear to\r\nbe composed of marrow and nerve. They are inclined to be tall, slender,\r\nsoft, and as distant from all that is harsh, rigorous, or stubborn as\r\nheaven is from earth.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss have generally no common physiognomy or national character,\r\nthe aspect of fidelity excepted. They are as different from each other\r\nas nations the most remote.\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSIOGNOMICAL RELATION OF THE SEXES. Generally speaking, how much\r\nmore pure, tender, delicate, irritable, affectionate, flexible, and\r\npatient is woman than man. The primary matter of which woman is\r\nconstituted appears to account for this difference. All her organs are\r\ntender, yielding, easily wounded, sensible, and receptive; they are made\r\nfor maternity and affection. Among a thousand women, there is hardly one\r\nwithout these feminine characteristics.\r\n\r\nThis tenderness and sensibility, the light texture of their fibres and\r\norgans, render them easy to tempt and to subdue, and yet their charms\r\nare more potent than the strength of man. Truly sensible of purity,\r\nbeauty and symmetry, woman does not always take time to reflect on\r\nspiritual life, spiritual death, spiritual corruption.\r\n\r\nThe woman does not think profoundly; profound thought is the prerogative\r\nof the man; but women feel more. They rule with tender looks, tears, and\r\nsighs, but not with passion and threats, unless they are monstrosities.\r\nThey are capable of the sweetest sensibility, the deepest emotion, the\r\nutmost humility, and ardent enthusiasm. In their faces are signs of\r\nsanctity which every man honours.\r\n\r\nOwing to their extreme sensibility and their incapacity for accurate\r\ninquiry and firm decision, they may easily become fanatics.\r\n\r\nThe love of women, strong as it is, is very changeable; but their hatred\r\nis almost incurable, and is only to be overcome by persistent and artful\r\nflattery. Men usually see things as a whole, whereas women take more\r\ninterest in details.\r\n\r\nWomen have less physical courage than men. Man hears the bursting\r\nthunders, views the destructive bolt with serene aspect, and stands\r\nerect amid the fearful majesty of the torrent. But woman trembles at the\r\nlightning and thunder, and seeks refuge in the arms of man.\r\n\r\nWoman is formed for pity and religion; and a woman without religion is\r\nmonstrous; and a woman who is a freethinker is more disgusting than a\r\nwoman with a beard.\r\n\r\nWoman is not a foundation on which to build. She is the gold, silver,\r\nprecious stones, wood, hay, stubble--the materials for building on the\r\nmale foundation. She is the leaven, or, more expressly, she is oil to\r\nthe vinegar of man. Man singly is but half a man, only half human--a\r\nking without a kingdom. Woman must rest upon the man, and man can be\r\nwhat he ought to be only in conjunction with the woman.\r\n\r\nSome of the principal physiognomical contrasts may be summarised here.\r\n\r\nMan is the most firm; woman the most flexible.\r\n\r\nMan is the straightest; woman the most bending.\r\n\r\nMan stands steadfast; woman gently retreats.\r\n\r\nMan surveys and observes; woman glances and feels.\r\n\r\nMan is serious; woman is gay.\r\n\r\nMan is the tallest and broadest; woman the smallest and weakest.\r\n\r\nMan is rough and hard; woman is smooth and soft.\r\n\r\nMan is brown; woman is fair.\r\n\r\nThe hair of the man is strong and short; the hair of woman is pliant and\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nMan has most straight lines; woman most curved.\r\n\r\nThe countenance of man, taken in profile, is not so often perpendicular\r\nas that of woman.\r\n\r\nFAMILY PHYSIOGNOMY. The resemblance between parents and children is very\r\ncommonly remarkable. Family physiognomical resemblance is as undeniable\r\nas national physiognomical resemblance. To doubt this is to doubt what\r\nis self-evident.\r\n\r\nWhen children, as they increase in years, visibly increase in their\r\nphysical resemblance to their parents, we cannot doubt that resemblance\r\nin character also increases. Howsoever much the character of children\r\nmay seem to differ from that of their parents, yet this difference will\r\nbe found to be due to great difference in external circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTUS VON LIEBIG\r\n\r\nAnimal Chemistry\r\n\r\n     Baron Freiherr Justus von Liebig, one of the most illustrious\r\n     chemists of his age, was born on May 12, 1803, at Darmstadt,\r\n     Germany, the son of a drysalter. It was in his father's business\r\n     that his interest in chemistry first awoke, and at fifteen he\r\n     became an apothecary's assistant. Subsequently, he went to\r\n     Erlangen, where he took his doctorate in 1822; and afterwards, in\r\n     Paris, was admitted to the laboratory of Gay-Lussac as a private\r\n     pupil. In 1824 he was appointed a teacher of chemistry in the\r\n     University of Giessen in his native state. Here he lived for\r\n     twenty-eight years a quiet life of incessant industry, while his\r\n     fame spread throughout Europe. In 1845 he was raised to the\r\n     hereditary rank of baron, and seven years later was appointed by\r\n     the Bavarian government to the professorship of chemistry in the\r\n     University of Munich. Here he died on April 18, 1873. The treatise\r\n     on \"Animal Chemistry, or Organic Chemistry in its Relations to\r\n     Physiology and Pathology,\" published in 1842, sums up the results\r\n     of Liebig's investigations into the immediate products of animal\r\n     life. He was the first to demonstrate that the only source of\r\n     animal heat is that produced by the oxidation of the tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Chemical Needs of Life_\r\n\r\nAnimals, unlike plants, require highly organised atoms for nutriment;\r\nthey can subsist only upon parts of an organism. All parts of the animal\r\nbody are produced from the fluid circulating within its organism. A\r\ndestruction of the animal body is constantly proceeding, every motion is\r\nthe result of a transformation of its structure; every thought, every\r\nsensation is accompanied by a change in the composition of the substance\r\nof the brain. Food is applied either in the increase of the mass of a\r\nstructure (nutrition) or in the replacement of a structure wasted\r\n(reproduction).\r\n\r\nEqually important is the continual absorption of oxygen from the\r\natmosphere. All vital activity results from the mutual action of the\r\noxygen of the atmosphere and the elements of food. According to\r\nLavoisier, an adult man takes into his system every year 827 lb. of\r\noxygen, and yet he does not increase in weight. What, then, becomes of\r\nthis oxygen?--for no part of it is again expired as oxygen. The carbon\r\nand hydrogen of certain parts of the body have entered into combination\r\nwith the oxygen introduced through the lungs and through the skin, and\r\nhave been given out in the form of carbonic acid and the vapour of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNow, an adult inspires 32-1/2 oz. of oxygen daily; this will convert the\r\ncarbon of 24 lb. of blood (80 per cent. water) into carbonic acid. He\r\nmust, therefore, take as much nutriment as will supply the daily loss.\r\nAnd, in fact, it is found that he does so; for the average amount of\r\ncarbon in the daily food of an adult man is 14 oz., which requires 37\r\noz. of oxygen for its conversion into carbonic acid. The amount of food\r\nnecessary for the support of the animal body must be in direct ratio to\r\nthe quantity of oxygen taken into the system. A bird deprived of food\r\ndies on the third day; while a serpent, which inspires a mere trace of\r\noxygen, can live without food for three months. The number of\r\nrespirations is less in a state of rest than in exercise, and the amount\r\nof food necessary in both conditions must vary also.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the chest being a constant quantity, we inspire the same\r\nvolume of air whether at the pole or at the equator; but the weight of\r\nair, and consequently of oxygen, varies with the temperature. Thus, an\r\nadult man takes into the system daily 46,000 cubic inches of oxygen,\r\nwhich, if the temperature be 77° F., weighs 32-1/2 oz., but when the\r\ntemperature sinks to freezing-point will weigh 35 oz. It is obvious,\r\nalso, that in an equal number of respirations we consume more oxygen at\r\nthe level of the sea than on a mountain. The quantity of oxygen inspired\r\nand carbonic acid expired must, therefore, vary with the height of the\r\nbarometer. In our climate the difference between summer and winter in\r\nthe carbon expired, and therefore necessary for food, is as much as\r\none-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--The Cause of Animal Heat_\r\n\r\nNow, the mutual action between the elements of food and the oxygen of\r\nthe air is the source of animal heat.\r\n\r\nThis heat is wholly due to the combustion of the carbon and hydrogen in\r\nthe food consumed. Animal heat exists only in those parts of the body\r\nthrough which arterial blood (and with it oxygen in solution)\r\ncirculates; hair, wool, or feathers, do not possess an elevated\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nAs animal heat depends upon respired oxygen, it will vary according to\r\nthe respiratory apparatus of the animal. Thus the temperature of a child\r\nis 102° F., while that of an adult is 99-1/2° F. That of birds is higher\r\nthan that of quadrupeds or that of fishes or amphibia, whose proper\r\ntemperature is 3° F higher than the medium in which they live. All\r\nanimals, strictly speaking, are warm-blooded; but in those only which\r\npossess lungs is their temperature quite independent of the surrounding\r\nmedium. The temperature of the human body is the same in the torrid as\r\nin the frigid zone; but the colder the surrounding medium the greater\r\nthe quantity of fuel necessary to maintain its heat.\r\n\r\nThe human body may be aptly compared to the furnace of a laboratory\r\ndestined to effect certain operations. It signifies nothing what\r\nintermediate forms the food, or fuel, of the furnace may assume; it is\r\nfinally converted into carbonic acid and water. But in order to sustain\r\na fixed temperature in the furnace we must vary the quantity of fuel\r\naccording to the external temperature.\r\n\r\nIn the animal body the food is the fuel; with a proper supply of oxygen\r\nwe obtain the heat given out during its oxidation or combustion. In\r\nwinter, when we take exercise in a cold atmosphere, and when\r\nconsequently the amount of inspired oxygen increases, the necessity for\r\nfood containing carbon and hydrogen increases in the same ratio; and by\r\ngratifying the appetite thus excited, we obtain the most efficient\r\nprotection against the most piercing cold. A starving man is soon frozen\r\nto death; and everyone knows that the animals of prey in the Arctic\r\nregions far exceed in voracity those in the torrid zone. In cold and\r\ntemperate climates, the air, which incessantly strives to consume the\r\nbody, urges man to laborious efforts in order to furnish the means of\r\nresistance to its action, while in hot climates the necessity of labour\r\nto provide food is far less urgent.\r\n\r\nOur clothing is merely the equivalent for a certain amount of food.\r\n\r\nThe more warmly we are clothed the less food we require. If in hunting\r\nor fishing we were exposed to the same degree of cold as the Samoyedes\r\nwe could with ease consume ten pounds of flesh, and perhaps half a dozen\r\ntallow candles into the bargain. The macaroni of the Italian, and the\r\ntrain oil of the Greenlander and the Russian, are fitted to administer\r\nto their comfort in the climate in which they have been born.\r\n\r\nThe whole process of respiration appears most clearly developed in the\r\ncase of a man exposed to starvation. Currie mentions the case of an\r\nindividual who was unable to swallow, and whose body lost 100 lb. in one\r\nmonth. The more fat an animal contains the longer will it be able to\r\nexist without food, for the fat will be consumed before the oxygen of\r\nthe air acts upon the other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThere are various causes by which force or motion may be produced. But\r\nin the animal body we recognise as the ultimate cause of all force only\r\none cause, the chemical action which the elements of the food and the\r\noxygen of the air mutually exercise on each other. The only known\r\nultimate cause of vital force, either in animals or in plants, is a\r\nchemical process. If this be prevented, the phenomena of life do not\r\nmanifest themselves, or they cease to be recognisable by our senses. If\r\nthe chemical action be impeded, the vital phenomena must take new forms.\r\n\r\nThe heat evolved by the combustion of carbon in the body is sufficient\r\nto account for all the phenomena of animal heat. The 14 oz. of carbon\r\nwhich in an adult are daily converted into carbonic acid disengage a\r\nquantity of heat which would convert 24 lb. of water, at the temperature\r\nof the body, into vapour. And if we assume that the quantity of water\r\nvaporised through the skin and lungs amounts to 3 lb., then we have\r\nstill a large quantity of heat to sustain the temperature of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--The Chemistry of Blood-Making_\r\n\r\nPhysiologists conceive that the various organs in the body have\r\noriginally been formed from blood. If this be admitted, it is obvious\r\nthat those substances alone can be considered nutritious that are\r\ncapable of being transformed into blood.\r\n\r\nWhen blood is allowed to stand, it coagulates and separates into a\r\nwatery fluid called serum, and into the clot, which consists principally\r\nof fibrine. These two bodies contain, in all, seven elements, among\r\nwhich sulphur, phosphorus, and nitrogen are found; they contain also the\r\nearth of bones. The serum holds in solution common salt and other salts\r\nof potash and soda, of which the acids are carbonic, phosphoric, and\r\nsulphuric acids. Serum, when heated, coagulates into a white mass called\r\nalbumen. This substance, along with the fibrine and a red colouring\r\nmatter in which iron is a constituent, constitute the globules of blood.\r\n\r\nAnalysis has shown that fibrine and albumen are perfectly identical in\r\nchemical composition. They may be mutually converted into each other. In\r\nthe process of nutrition both may be converted into muscular fibre, and\r\nmuscular fibre is capable of being reconverted into blood.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the animal body which form parts of organs contain\r\nnitrogen. The principal ingredients of blood contain 17 per cent. of\r\nnitrogen, and there is no part of an active organ that contains less\r\nthan 17 per cent. of this element.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive process is simplest in the case of the carnivora, for\r\ntheir nutriment is chemically identical in composition with their own\r\ntissues. The digestive apparatus of graminivorous animals is less\r\nsimple, and their food contains very little nitrogen. From what\r\nconstituents of vegetables is their blood produced?\r\n\r\nChemical researches have shown that all such parts of vegetables as can\r\nafford nutriment to animals contain certain constituents which are rich\r\nin nitrogen; and experience proves that animals require for their\r\nnutrition less of these parts of plants in proportion as they abound in\r\nthe nitrogenised constituents. These important products are specially\r\nabundant in the seeds of the different kinds of grain, and of peas,\r\nbeans, and lentils. They exist, however, in all plants, without\r\nexception, and in every part of plants in larger or smaller quantity.\r\nThe nitrogenised compounds of vegetables are called vegetable fibrine,\r\nvegetable albumen, and vegetable casein. All other nitrogenised\r\ncompounds occurring in plants are either rejected by animals or else\r\nthey occur in the food in such very small proportion that they cannot\r\npossibly contribute to the increase of mass in the animal body.\r\n\r\nThe chemical analysis of these three substances has led to the\r\ninteresting result that they contain the same organic elements, united\r\nin the same proportion by weight; and--which is more remarkable--that\r\nthey are identical in composition with the chief constituents of\r\nblood--animal fibrine and animal albumen. By identity, be it remarked,\r\nis not here meant merely similarity, but that even in regard to the\r\npresence and relative amounts of sulphur, phosphorus, and phosphate of\r\nlime no difference can be observed.\r\n\r\nHow beautifully simple then, by the aid of these discoveries, appears\r\nthe process of nutrition in animals, the formation of their organs, in\r\nwhich vitality chiefly resides. Those vegetable constituents which are\r\nused by animals to form blood contain the essential ingredients of blood\r\nready formed. In point of fact, vegetables produce in their organism the\r\nblood of all animals; for the carnivora, in consuming the blood and\r\nflesh of the graminivora, consume, strictly speaking, the vegetable\r\nprinciples which have served for the nourishment of the latter. In this\r\nsense we may say the animal organism gives to blood only its form; and,\r\nfurther, that it is incapable of forming blood out of other compounds\r\nwhich do not contain the chief ingredients of that fluid.\r\n\r\nAnimal and vegetable life are, therefore, closely related, for the first\r\nsubstance capable of affording nutriment to animals is the last product\r\nof the creative energy of vegetables. The seemingly miraculous in the\r\nnutritive power of vegetables disappears in a great degree, for the\r\nproduction of the constituents of blood cannot appear more surprising\r\nthan the occurrence of the principal ingredient of butter in palm-oil\r\nand of horse-fat and train-oil in certain of the oily seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--Food the Fuel of Life_\r\n\r\nWe have still to account for the use in food of substances which are\r\ndestitute of nitrogen but are known to be necessary to animal life. Such\r\nsubstances are starch, sugar, gum, and pectine. In all of these we find\r\na great excess of carbon, with oxygen and hydrogen in the same\r\nproportion as water. They therefore add an excess of carbon to the\r\nnitrogenised constituents of food, and they cannot possibly be employed\r\nin the production of blood, because the nitrogenised compounds contained\r\nin the food already contain exactly the amount of carbon which is\r\nrequired for the production of fibrine and albumen. Now, it can be shown\r\nthat very little of the excess of this carbon is ever expelled in the\r\nform either of solid or liquid compounds; it must be expelled,\r\ntherefore, in the gaseous state. In short, these compounds are solely\r\nexpended in the production of animal heat, being converted by the oxygen\r\nof the air into carbonic acid and water. The food of carnivorous animals\r\ndoes not contain non-nitrogenised matters, so that the carbon and\r\nhydrogen necessary for the production of animal heat are furnished in\r\nthem from the waste of their tissues.\r\n\r\nThe transformed matters of the organs are obviously unfit for the\r\nfurther nourishment of the body--that is, for the increase or\r\nreproduction of the mass. They pass through the absorbent and lymphatic\r\nvessels into the veins, and their accumulation in these would soon put a\r\nstop to the nutritive process were it not that the blood has to pass\r\nthrough a filtering apparatus, as it were, before reaching the heart.\r\nThe venous blood, before returning to the heart, is made to pass through\r\nthe liver and the kidneys, which separate from it all substances\r\nincapable of contributing to nutrition. The new compounds containing the\r\nnitrogen of the transformed organs, being utterly incapable of further\r\napplication in the system, are expelled from the body. Those which\r\ncontain the carbon of the transformed tissues are collected in the\r\ngall-bladder as bile, a compound of soda which, being mixed with water,\r\npasses through the duodenum and mixes with chyme. All the soda of the\r\nbile, and ninety-nine-hundredths of the carbonaceous matter which it\r\ncontains, retain the capacity of re-absorption by the absorbents of the\r\nsmall and large intestines--a capacity which has been proved by direct\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe globules of the blood, which in themselves can be shown to take no\r\nshare in the nutritive process, serve to transport the oxygen which they\r\ngive up in their passage through the capillary vessels. Here the current\r\nof oxygen meets with the carbonaceous substances of the transformed\r\ntissues, and converts their carbon into carbonic acid, their hydrogen\r\ninto water. Every portion of these substances which escapes this process\r\nof oxidation is sent back into the circulation in the form of bile,\r\nwhich by degrees completely disappears.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that in the system of the graminivora, whose food contains\r\nrelatively so small a proportion of the constituents of blood, the\r\nprocess of metamorphosis in existing tissues, and consequently their\r\nrestoration or reproduction, must go on far less rapidly than in the\r\ncarnivora. Otherwise, a vegetation a thousand times as luxuriant would\r\nnot suffice for their sustenance. Sugar, gum, and starch, which form so\r\nlarge a proportion of their food, would then be no longer necessary to\r\nsupport life in these animals, because in that case the products of\r\nwaste, or metamorphosis of organised tissues, would contain enough\r\ncarbon to support the respiratory process.\r\n\r\nWhen exercise is denied to graminivorous and omnivorous animals this is\r\ntantamount to a deficient supply of oxygen. The carbon of the food, not\r\nmeeting with a sufficient supply of oxygen to consume it, passes into\r\nother compounds containing a large excess of carbon--or, in other words,\r\nfat is produced. Fat is thus an abnormal production, resulting from a\r\ndisproportion of carbon in the food to that of the oxygen respired by\r\nthe lungs or absorbed by the skin. Wild animals in a state of nature do\r\nnot contain fat. The production of fat is always a consequence of a\r\ndeficient supply of oxygen, for oxygen is absolutely indispensable for\r\nthe dissipation of excess of carbon in the food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_V.--Animal Life-Chemistry_\r\n\r\nThe substances of which the food of man is composed may be divided into\r\ntwo classes--into nitrogenised and non-nitrogenised. The former are\r\ncapable of conversion into blood, the latter incapable of this\r\ntransformation. Out of those substances which are adapted to the\r\nformation of blood are formed all the organised tissues. The other class\r\nof substances in the normal state of health serve to support the process\r\nof respiration. The former may be called the plastic elements of\r\nnutrition; the latter, elements of respiration.\r\n\r\nAmong the former we may reckon--vegetable fibrine, vegetable albumen,\r\nvegetable casein, animal flesh, animal blood.\r\n\r\nAmong the elements of respiration in our food are--fat, starch, gum,\r\ncane sugar, grape-sugar, sugar of milk, pectine, bassorine, wine, beer,\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogenised constituents of vegetable food have a composition\r\nidentical with that of the constituents of the blood.\r\n\r\nNo nitrogenised compound the composition of which differs from that of\r\nfibrine, albumen, and casein, is capable of supporting the vital process\r\nin animals.\r\n\r\nThe animal organism undoubtedly possesses the power of forming from the\r\nconstituents of its blood the substance of its membranes and cellular\r\ntissue, of the nerves and brain, of the organic part of cartilages and\r\nbones. But the blood must be supplied to it ready in everything but its\r\nform--that is, in its chemical composition. If this is not done, a\r\nperiod is put to the formation of blood, and, consequently, to life.\r\n\r\nThe whole life of animals consists of a conflict between chemical forces\r\nand the vital power. In the normal state of the body of an adult these\r\nstand in equilibrium: that is, there is equilibrium between the\r\nmanifestations of the causes of waste and the causes of supply. Every\r\nmechanical or chemical agency which disturbs the restoration of this\r\nequilibrium is a cause of disease.\r\n\r\nDeath is that condition in which chemical or mechanical powers gain the\r\nascendancy, and all resistance on the part of the vital force ceases.\r\nThis resistance never entirely departs from living tissues during life.\r\nSuch deficiency in resistance is, in fact, a deficiency in resistance to\r\nthe action of the oxygen of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nDisease occurs when the sum of vital force, which tends to neutralise\r\nall causes of disturbance, is weaker than the acting cause of\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nShould there be formed in the diseased parts, in consequence of the\r\nchange of matter, from the elements of the blood or of the tissue, new\r\nproducts which the neighbouring parts cannot employ for their own vital\r\nfunctions; should the surrounding parts, moreover, be unable to convey\r\nthese products to other parts where they may undergo transformation,\r\nthen these new products will suffer, at the place where they have been\r\nformed, a process of decomposition analogous to putrefaction.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases, medicine removes these diseased conditions by exciting\r\nin the vicinity of the diseased part, or in any convenient situation, an\r\nartificial diseased state (as by blisters), thus diminishing by means of\r\nartificial disturbance the resistance offered to the external causes of\r\nchange in these parts by the vital force. The physician succeeds in\r\nputting an end to the original diseased condition when the disturbance\r\nartificially excited (or the diminution of resistance in another part)\r\nexceeds in amount the diseased state to be overcome.\r\n\r\nThe accelerated change of matter and the elevated temperature in the\r\ndiseased part show that the resistance offered by the vital force to the\r\naction of oxygen is feebler than in the healthy state. But this\r\nresistance only ceases entirely when death takes place. By the\r\nartificial diminution of resistance in another part, the resistance in\r\nthe diseased organ is not, indeed, directly strengthened; but the\r\nchemical action, the cause of the change of matter, is diminished in the\r\ndiseased part, being directed to another part, where the physician has\r\nsucceeded in producing a still more feeble resistance to the change of\r\nmatter, to the action of oxygen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES LYELL\r\n\r\nThe Principles of Geology\r\n\r\n     Sir Charles Lyell, the distinguished geologist, was born at\r\n     Kinnordy, Forfarshire, Scotland, Nov. 14, 1797. It was at Oxford\r\n     that his scientific interest was first aroused, and after taking an\r\n     M.A. degree in 1821 he continued his scientific studies, becoming\r\n     an active member of the Geological and Linnæan Societies of London.\r\n     In 1826 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and two years\r\n     later went with Sir Roderick Murchison on a tour of Europe, and\r\n     gathered evidence for the theory of geological uniformity which he\r\n     afterwards promulgated. In 1830 he published his great work,\r\n     \"Principles of Geology: Being an Attempt to Explain the Former\r\n     Changes of the Earth's Surface by References to Causes now in\r\n     Action,\" which converted almost the whole geological world to the\r\n     doctrine of uniformitarianism, and may be considered the foundation\r\n     of modern geology. Lyell died in London on February 22, 1875.\r\n     Besides his great work, he also published \"The Elements of\r\n     Geology,\" \"The Antiquity of Man,\" \"Travels in North America,\" and\r\n     \"The Student's Elements of Geology.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Uniformity in Geological Development_\r\n\r\nAccording to the speculations of some writers, there have been in the\r\npast history of the planet alternate periods of tranquillity and\r\nconvulsion, the former enduring for ages, and resembling the state of\r\nthings now experienced by man; the other brief, transient, and\r\nparoxysmal, giving rise to new mountains, seas, and valleys,\r\nannihilating one set of organic beings, and ushering in the creation of\r\nanother. These theories, however, are not borne out by a fair\r\ninterpretation of geological monuments; but, on the contrary, nature\r\nindicates no such cataclysms, but rather progressive uniformity.\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks have been supposed to afford evidence of ancient paroxysms\r\nof nature, but we cannot consider igneous rocks proof of any\r\nexceptional paroxysms. Rather, we find ourselves compelled to regard\r\nigneous rocks as an aggregate effect of innumerable eruptions, of\r\nvarious degrees of violence, at various times, and to consider mountain\r\nchains as the accumulative results of these eruptions. The incumbent\r\ncrust of the earth is never allowed to attain that strength and\r\ncoherence which would be necessary in order to allow the volcanic force\r\nto accumulate and form an explosive charge capable of producing a grand\r\nparoxysmal eruption. The subterranean power, on the contrary, displays,\r\neven in its most energetic efforts, an intermittent and mitigated\r\nintensity. There are no proofs that the igneous rocks were produced more\r\nabundantly at remote periods.\r\n\r\nNor can we find proof of catastrophic discontinuity when we examine\r\nfossil plants and fossil animals. On the contrary, we find a progressive\r\ndevelopment of organic life at successive geological periods.\r\n\r\nIn Palæozoic strata the entire want of plants of the most complex\r\norganisation is very striking, for not a single dicotyledonous\r\nangiosperm has yet been found, and only one undoubted monocotyledon. In\r\nSecondary, or Mesozoic, times, palms and some other monocotyledons\r\nappeared; but not till the Upper Cretaceous era do we meet with the\r\nprincipal classes and orders of the vegetable kingdom as now known.\r\nThrough the Tertiary ages the forms were perpetually changing, but\r\nalways becoming more and more like, generically and specifically, to\r\nthose now in being. On the whole, therefore, we find progressive\r\ndevelopment of plant life in the course of the ages.\r\n\r\nIn the case of animal life, progression is equally evident.\r\nPalæontological research leads to the conclusion that the invertebrate\r\nanimals flourished before the vertebrate, and that in the latter class\r\nfish, reptiles, birds, and mammalia made their appearance in a\r\nchronological order analogous to that in which they would be arranged\r\nzoologically according to an advancing scale of perfection in their\r\norganisation. In regard to the mammalia themselves, they have been\r\ndivided by Professor Owen into four sub-classes by reference to\r\nmodifications of their brain. The two lowest are met with in the\r\nSecondary strata. The next in grade is found in Tertiary strata. And the\r\nhighest of all, of which man is the sole representative, has not yet\r\nbeen detected in deposits older than the Post-Tertiary.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in passing from the older to the newer members of the\r\nTertiary system we meet with many chasms, but none which separate\r\nentirely, by a broad line of demarcation, one state of the organic world\r\nfrom another. There are no signs of an abrupt termination of one fauna\r\nand flora, and the starting into life of new and wholly distinct forms.\r\nAlthough we are far from being able to demonstrate geologically an\r\ninsensible transition from the Eocene to the Miocene, or even from the\r\nlatter to the recent fauna, yet the more we enlarge and perfect our\r\ngeneral survey the more nearly do we approximate to such a continuous\r\nseries, and the more gradually are we conducted from times when many of\r\nthe genera and nearly all the species were extinct to those in which\r\nscarcely a single species flourished which we do not know to exist at\r\npresent. We must remember, too, that many gaps in animal and floral life\r\nwere due to ordinary climatic and geological factors. We could, under no\r\ncircumstances, expect to meet with a complete ascending series.\r\n\r\nThe great vicissitudes in climate which the earth undoubtedly\r\nexperienced, as shown by geological records, have been held to be\r\nthemselves proof of sudden violent revolutions in the life-history of\r\nthe world. But all the great climatic vicissitudes can be accounted for\r\nby the action of factors still, in operation--subsidences and elevations\r\nof land, alterations in the relative proportions and position of land\r\nand water, variations in the relative position of our planet to the sun\r\nand other heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the conclusion is inevitable that from the remotest period\r\nthere has been one uniform and continuous system of change in the\r\nanimate and inanimate world, and accordingly every fact collected\r\nrespecting the factors at present at work in forming and changing the\r\nworld, affords a key to the interpretation of its part. And thus,\r\nalthough we are mere sojourners on the surface of the planet, chained to\r\na mere point in space, enduring but for a moment of time, the human mind\r\nis enabled not only to number worlds beyond the unassisted ken of mortal\r\neye, but to trace the events of indefinite ages before the creation of\r\nour race, and to penetrate into the dark secrets of the ocean and the\r\nheart of the solid globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Changes in the Inorganic World now in Progress_\r\n\r\nThe great agents of change in the inorganic world may be divided into\r\ntwo principal classes--the aqueous and the igneous. To the aqueous\r\nbelong rain, rivers, springs, currents, and tides, and the action of\r\nfrost and snow; to the igneous, volcanoes and earthquakes. Both these\r\nclasses are instruments of degradation as well as of reproduction. But\r\nthey may also be regarded as antagonist forces, since the aqueous agents\r\nare incessantly labouring to reduce the inequalities of the earth's\r\nsurface to a level; while the igneous are equally active in restoring\r\nthe unevenness of the external crust, partly by heaping up new matter in\r\ncertain localities, and partly by depressing one portion of the earth's\r\nenvelope and forcing out another.\r\n\r\nWe will treat in the first place of the aqueous agents.\r\n\r\nRAIN AND RIVERS. When one considers that in some parts of the world as\r\nmuch as 500 or 600 inches of rain may fall annually, it is easy to\r\nbelieve that rain _qua_ rain may be a denuding and plastic agent, and in\r\nsome parts of the world we find evidence of its action in earth pillars\r\nor pyramids. The best example of earth pillars is seen near Botzen, in\r\nthe Tyrol, where there are hundreds of columns of indurated mud, varying\r\nin height from 20 feet to 100 feet. These columns are usually capped by\r\na single stone, and have been separated by rain from the terrace of\r\nwhich they once formed a part.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, however, rain acts through rivers. The power of rivers to\r\ndenude and transport is exemplified daily. Even a comparatively small\r\nstream when swollen by rain may move rocks tons in weight, and may\r\ntransport thousands of tons of gravel. The greatest damage is done when\r\nrivers are dammed by landslips or by ice. In 1818 the River Dranse was\r\nblocked by ice, and its upper part became a lake. In the hot season the\r\nbarrier of ice gave way, and the torrent swept before it rocks, forests,\r\nhouses, bridges, and cultivated land. For the greater part of its course\r\nthe flood resembled a moving mass of rock and mud rather than of water.\r\nSome fragments of granite rock of enormous size, which might be compared\r\nto houses, were torn out and borne down for a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\nThe rivers of unmelted ice called the glaciers act more slowly, but they\r\nalso have the power of transporting gravel, sand, and boulders to great\r\ndistances, and of polishing and scoring their rocky channels. Icebergs,\r\ntoo, are potent geological agents. Many of them are loaded with 50,000\r\nto 100,000 tons of rock and earth, which they may carry great distances.\r\nAlso in their course they must break, and polish, and scratch the peaks\r\nand points of submarine mountains.\r\n\r\nCoast ice, likewise, may transport rocks and earth. Springs also must be\r\nconsidered as geological agents affecting the face of the globe.\r\n\r\nBut running water not only denudes it, but also creates land, for\r\nlakes, seas, rivers are seen to form deltas. That Egypt was the gift of\r\nthe Nile was the opinion of the Egyptian priests, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that the fertility of the alluvial plain above Cairo, and the very\r\nexistence of the delta below that city, are due to the action of that\r\ngreat river, and to its power of transporting mud from the interior of\r\nAfrica and depositing it on its inundated plains as well as on that\r\nspace which has been reclaimed from the Mediterranean and converted into\r\nland. The delta of the Ganges and Brahmapootra is more than double that\r\nof the Nile. Even larger is the delta of the Mississippi, which has been\r\ncalculated to be 12,300 square miles in area.\r\n\r\nTIDES AND CURRENTS. The transporting and destroying and constructive\r\npower of tides and currents is, in many respects, analogous to that of\r\nrivers, but extends to wider areas, and is, therefore, of more\r\ngeological importance. The chief influence of the ocean is exerted at\r\nmoderate depths below the surface on all areas which are slowly rising,\r\nor attempting, as it were, to rise above the sea; but its influence is\r\nalso seen round the coast of every continent and island.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the igneous agents that act on the earth's\r\nsurface. These agents are chiefly volcanoes and earthquakes, and we find\r\nthat both usually occur in particular parts of the world. At various\r\ntimes and at various places within historical times volcanic eruptions\r\nand earthquakes have both proved their potency to alter the face of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe principal geological facts and theories with regard to volcanoes and\r\nearthquakes are as follows.\r\n\r\nThe primary causes of the volcano and the earthquake are to a great\r\nextent the same, and connected with the development of heat and chemical\r\naction at various depths in the interior of the globe.\r\n\r\nVolcanic heat has been supposed to be the result of the original high\r\ntemperature of the molten planet, and the planet has been supposed to\r\nlose heat by radiation. Recent inquiries, however, suggest that the\r\napparent loss of heat may arise from the excessive local development of\r\nvolcanic action.\r\n\r\nWhatever the original shape of our planet, it must in time have become\r\nspheroidal by the gradual operation of centrifugal force acting on\r\nyielding materials brought successively within its action by aqueous and\r\nigneous causes.\r\n\r\nThe heat in mines and artesian wells increases as we descend, but not in\r\nuniform ratio in different regions. Increase at a uniform ratio would\r\nimply such heat in the central nucleus as must instantly fuse the crust.\r\n\r\nAssuming that there are good astronomical grounds for inferring the\r\noriginal fluidity of the planet, yet such pristine fluidity need not\r\naffect the question of volcanic heat, for the volcanic action of\r\nsuccessive periods belongs to a much more modern state of the globe, and\r\nimplies the melting of different parts of the solid crust one after the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe supposed great energy of the volcanic forces in the remoter periods\r\nis by no means borne out by geological observations on the quantity of\r\nlava produced by single eruptions in those several periods.\r\n\r\nThe old notion that the crystalline rocks, whether stratified or\r\nunstratified, such as granite and gneiss, were produced in the lower\r\nparts of the earth's crust at the expense of a central nucleus slowly\r\ncooling from a state of fusion by heat has now had to be given up, now\r\nthat granite is found to be of all ages, and now that we know the\r\nmetamorphic rocks to be altered sedimentary strata, implying the\r\ndenudation of a previously solidified crust.\r\n\r\nThe powerful agency of steam or aqueous vapour in volcanic eruptions\r\nleads us to compare its power of propelling lava to the surface with\r\nthat which it exerts in driving water up the pipe of an Icelandic\r\ngeyser. Various gases also, rendered liquid by pressure at great depths,\r\nmay aid in causing volcanic outbursts, and in fissuring and convulsing\r\nthe rocks during earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe chemical character of the products of recent eruptions suggests that\r\nlarge bodies of salt water gain access to the volcanic foci. Although\r\nthis may not be the primary cause of volcanic eruptions, which are\r\nprobably due to the aqueous vapour intimately mixed with molten rock,\r\nyet once the crust is shattered through, the force and frequency of\r\neruptions may depend in some measure on the proximity of large bodies of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe permanent elevation and subsidence of land now observed, and which\r\nmay have been going on through past ages, may be connected with the\r\nexpansion and contraction of parts of the solid crust, some of which\r\nhave been cooling from time to time, while others have been gaining\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nIn the preservation of the average proportion of land and sea, the\r\nigneous agents exert a conservative power, restoring the unevenness of\r\nthe surface which the levelling power of water in motion would tend to\r\ndestroy. If the diameter of the planet remains always the same, the\r\ndownward movements of the crust must be somewhat in excess, to\r\ncounterbalance the effects of volcanoes and mineral springs, which are\r\nalways ejecting material so as to raise the level of the surface of the\r\nearth. Subterranean movements, therefore, however destructive they may\r\nbe during great earthquakes, are essential to the well-being of the\r\nhabitable surface, and even to the very existence of terrestrial and\r\naquatic species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Changes of the Organic World now in Progress_\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Lamarck introduced the idea of transmutation of species,\r\nsuggesting that by changes in habitat, climate, and manner of living one\r\nspecies may, in the course of generations, be transformed into a new\r\nand distinct species.\r\n\r\nIn England, however, the idea remained dormant till in 1844 a work\r\nentitled the \"Vestiges of Creation\" reinforced it with many new facts.\r\nIn this work the unity of plan exhibited by the whole organic creation,\r\nfossil and recent, and the mutual affinities of all the different\r\nclasses of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, were declared to be in\r\nharmony with the idea of new forms having proceeded from older ones by\r\nthe gradually modifying influence of environment. In 1858 the theory was\r\nput on a new and sound basis by Wallace and Darwin, who added the\r\nconception of natural selection, suggesting that variations in species\r\nare naturally produced, and that the variety fittest to survive in the\r\nsevere struggle for existence must survive, and transmit the\r\nadvantageous variation, implying the gradual evolution of new species.\r\nFurther, Darwin showed that other varieties may be perpetuated by sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nOn investigating the geographical distribution of animals and plants we\r\nfind that the extent to which the species of mammalia, birds, insects,\r\nlandshells, and plants (whether flowering or cryptogamous) agree with\r\ncontinental species; or the degree in which those of different islands\r\nof the same group agree with each other has an unmistakable relation to\r\nthe known facilities enjoyed by each class of crossing the ocean. Such a\r\nrelationship accords well with the theory of variation and natural\r\nselection, but with no other hypothesis yet suggested for explaining the\r\norigin of species.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said of the changes which are always going on in the\r\nhabitable surface of the world, and the manner in which some species are\r\nconstantly extending their range at the expense of others, it is evident\r\nthat the species existing at any particular period may, in the course of\r\nages, become extinct one after the other.\r\n\r\nIf such, then, be the law of the organic world, if every species is\r\ncontinually losing some of its varieties, and every genus some of its\r\nspecies, it follows that the transitional links which once, according to\r\nthe doctrine of transmutation, must have existed, will, in the great\r\nmajority of cases, be missing. We learn from geological investigations\r\nthat throughout an indefinite lapse of ages the whole animate creation\r\nhas been decimated again and again. Sometimes a single representative\r\nalone remains of a type once dominant, or of which the fossil species\r\nmay be reckoned by hundreds. We rarely find that whole orders have\r\ndisappeared, yet this is notably the case in the class of reptiles,\r\nwhich has lost some orders characterised by a higher organisation than\r\nany now surviving in that class. Certain genera of plants and animals\r\nwhich seem to have been wholly wanting, and others which were feebly\r\nrepresented in the Tertiary period, are now rich in species, and appear\r\nto be in such perfect harmony with the present conditions of existence\r\nthat they present us with countless varieties, confounding the zoologist\r\nor botanist who undertakes to describe or classify them.\r\n\r\nWe have only to reflect on the causes of extinction, and we at once\r\nforesee the time when even in these genera so many gaps will occur, so\r\nmany transitional forms will be lost, that there will no longer be any\r\ndifficulty in assigning definite limits to each surviving species. The\r\nblending, therefore, of one generic or specific form into another must\r\nbe an exception to the general rule, whether in our own time or in any\r\nperiod of the past, because the forms surviving at any given moment will\r\nhave been exposed for a long succession of antecedent periods to those\r\npowerful causes of extinction which are slowly but incessantly at work\r\nin the organic and inorganic worlds.\r\n\r\nThey who imagine that, if the theory of transmutation be true, we ought\r\nto discover in a fossil state all the intermediate links by which the\r\nmost dissimilar types have been formerly connected together, expect a\r\npermanence and completeness of records such as is never found. We do not\r\nfind even that all recently extinct plants have left memorials of their\r\nexistence in the crust of the earth; and ancient archives are certainly\r\nextremely defective. To one who is aware of the extreme imperfection of\r\nthe geological record, the discovery of one or two missing links is a\r\nfact of small significance; but each new form rescued from oblivion is\r\nan earnest of the former existence of hundreds of species, the greater\r\npart of which are irrevocably lost.\r\n\r\nA somewhat serious cause of disquiet and alarm arises out of the\r\nsupposed bearing of this doctrine of the origin of species by\r\ntransmutation on the origin of man, and his place in nature. It is\r\nclearly seen that there is such a close affinity, such an identity in\r\nall essential points, in our corporeal structure, and in many of our\r\ninstincts and passions with those of the lower animals--that man is so\r\ncompletely subjected to the same general laws of reproduction, increase,\r\ngrowth, disease, and death--that if progressive development, spontaneous\r\nvariation, and natural selection have for millions of years directed the\r\nchanges of the rest of the organic world, we cannot expect to find that\r\nthe human race has been exempted from the same continuous process of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nSuch a near bond of connection between man and the rest of the animate\r\ncreation is regarded by many as derogatory to our dignity. But we have\r\nalready had to exchange the pleasing conceptions indulged in by poets\r\nand theologians as to the high position in the scale of being held by\r\nour early progenitors for humble and more lowly beginnings, the joint\r\nlabours of the geologist and archæologist having left us in no doubt of\r\nthe ignorance and barbarism of Palæolithic man.\r\n\r\nIt is well, too, to remember that the high place we have reached in the\r\nscale of being has been gained step by step, by a conscientious study\r\nof natural phenomena, and by fearlessly teaching the doctrines to which\r\nthey point. It is by faithfully weighing evidence without regard to\r\npreconceived notions, by earnestly and patiently searching for what is\r\ntrue, not what we wish to be true, that we have attained to that\r\ndignity, which we may in vain hope to claim through the rank of an ideal\r\nparentage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES CLERK MAXWELL\r\n\r\nA Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism\r\n\r\n     James Clerk Maxwell, the first professor of experimental physics at\r\n     Cambridge, was born at Edinburgh on November 13, 1831, and before\r\n     he was fifteen was already famous as a writer of scientific papers.\r\n     In 1854 he graduated at Cambridge as second wrangler. Two years\r\n     later he became professor of natural philosophy at Marischal\r\n     College, Aberdeen. Vacating his chair in 1860 for one at King's\r\n     College, London, Maxwell contributed largely to scientific\r\n     literature. His great lifework, however, is his famous \"Treatise on\r\n     Electricity and Magnetism,\" which was published in 1873, and is, in\r\n     the words of a critic, \"one of the most splendid monuments ever\r\n     raised by the genius of a single individual.\" It was in this work\r\n     that he constructed his famous theory if electricity in which\r\n     \"action at a distance\" should be replaced by \"action through a\r\n     medium,\" and first enunciated the principles of an electro-magnetic\r\n     theory of light which has formed the basis of nearly all modern\r\n     physical science. He died on November 5, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--The Nature of Electricity_\r\n\r\nLet a piece of glass and a piece of resin be rubbed together. They will\r\nbe found to attract each other. If a second piece of glass be rubbed\r\nwith a second piece of resin, it will be found that the two pieces of\r\nglass repel each other and that the two pieces of resin are also\r\nrepelled from one another, while each piece of glass attracts each piece\r\nof resin. These phenomena of attraction and repulsion are called\r\nelectrical phenomena, and the bodies which exhibit them are said to be\r\n\"electrified,\" or to be \"charged with electricity.\"\r\n\r\nBodies may be electrified in many other ways, as well as by friction.\r\nWhen bodies not previously electrified are observed to be acted on by an\r\nelectrified body, it is because they have become \"electrified by\r\ninduction.\" If a metal vessel be electrified by induction, and a second\r\nmetallic body be suspended by silk threads near it, and a metal wire be\r\nbrought to touch simultaneously the electrified body and the second\r\nbody, this latter body will be found to be electrified. Electricity has\r\nbeen transferred from one body to the other by means of the wire.\r\n\r\nThere are many other manifestations of electricity, all of which have\r\nbeen more or less studied, and they lead to the formation of theories of\r\nits nature, theories which fit in, to a greater or less extent, with the\r\nobserved facts. The electrification of a body is a physical quantity\r\ncapable of measurement, and two or more electrifications can be combined\r\nexperimentally with a result of the same kind as when two quantities are\r\nadded algebraically. We, therefore, are entitled to use language fitted\r\nto deal with electrification as a quantity as well as a quality, and to\r\nspeak of any electrified body as \"charged with a certain quantity of\r\npositive or negative electricity.\"\r\n\r\nWhile admitting electricity to the rank of a physical quantity, we must\r\nnot too hastily assume that it is, or is not, a substance, or that it\r\nis, or is not, a form of energy, or that it belongs to any known\r\ncategory of physical quantities. All that we have proved is that it\r\ncannot be created or annihilated, so that if the total quantity of\r\nelectricity within a closed surface is increased or diminished, the\r\nincrease or diminution must have passed in or out through the closed\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThis is true of matter, but it is not true of heat, for heat may be\r\nincreased or diminished within a closed surface, without passing in or\r\nout through the surface, by the transformation of some form of energy\r\ninto heat, or of heat into some other form of energy. It is not true\r\neven of energy in general if we admit the immediate action of bodies at\r\na distance.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another reason which warrants us in asserting that\r\nelectricity, as a physical quantity, synonymous with the total\r\nelectrification of a body, is not, like heat, a form of energy. An\r\nelectrified system has a certain amount of energy, and this energy can\r\nbe calculated. The physical qualities, \"electricity\" and \"potential,\"\r\nwhen multiplied together, produce the quantity, \"energy.\" It is\r\nimpossible, therefore, that electricity and energy should be quantities\r\nof the same category, for electricity is only one of the factors of\r\nenergy, the other factor being \"potential.\"\r\n\r\nElectricity is treated as a substance in most theories of the subject,\r\nbut as there are two kinds of electrification, which, being combined,\r\nannul each other, a distinction has to be drawn between free electricity\r\nand combined electricity, for we cannot conceive of two substances\r\nannulling each other. In the two-fluid theory, all bodies, in their\r\nunelectrified state, are supposed to be charged with equal quantities of\r\npositive and negative electricity. These quantities are supposed to be\r\nso great than no process of electrification has ever yet deprived a body\r\nof all the electricity of either kind. The two electricities are called\r\n\"fluids\" because they are capable of being transferred from one body to\r\nanother, and are, within conducting bodies, extremely mobile.\r\n\r\nIn the one-fluid theory everything is the same as in the theory of two\r\nfluids, except that, instead of supposing the two substances equal and\r\nopposite in all respects, one of them, generally the negative one, has\r\nbeen endowed with the properties and name of ordinary matter, while the\r\nother retains the name of the electric fluid. The particles of the fluid\r\nare supposed to repel each other according to the law of the inverse\r\nsquare of the distance, and to attract those of matter according to the\r\nsame law. Those of matter are supposed to repel each other and attract\r\nthose of electricity. This theory requires us, however, to suppose the\r\nmass of the electric fluid so small that no attainable positive or\r\nnegative electrification has yet perceptibly increased or diminished the\r\nmass or the weight of a body, and it has not yet been able to assign\r\nsufficient reasons why the positive rather than the negative\r\nelectrification should be supposed due to an _excess_ quantity of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I look for additional light on the nature of\r\nelectricity from a study of what takes place in the space intervening\r\nbetween the electrified bodies. Some of the phenomena are explained\r\nequally by all the theories, while others merely indicate the peculiar\r\ndifficulties of each theory. We may conceive the relation into which the\r\nelectrified bodies are thrown, either as the result of the state of the\r\nintervening medium, or as the result of a direct action between the\r\nelectrified bodies at a distance. If we adopt the latter conception, we\r\nmay determine the law of the action, but we can go no further in\r\nspeculating on its cause.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we adopt the conception of action through a\r\nmedium, we are led to inquire into the nature of that action in each\r\npart of the medium. If we calculate on this hypothesis the total energy\r\nresiding in the medium, we shall find it equal to the energy due to the\r\nelectrification of the conductors on the hypothesis of direct action at\r\na distance. Hence, the two hypotheses are mathematically equivalent.\r\n\r\nOn the hypothesis that the mechanical action observed between\r\nelectrified bodies is exerted through and by means of the medium, as the\r\naction of one body on another by means of the tension of a rope or the\r\npressure of a rod, we find that the medium must be in a state of\r\nmechanical stress. The nature of the stress is, as Faraday pointed out,\r\na tension along the lines of force combined with an equal pressure in\r\nall directions at right angles to these lines. This distribution of\r\nstress is the only one consistent with the observed mechanical action on\r\nthe electrified bodies, and also with the observed equilibrium of the\r\nfluid dielectric which surrounds them. I have, therefore, assumed the\r\nactual existence of this state of stress.\r\n\r\nEvery case of electrification or discharge may be considered as a\r\nmotion in a closed circuit, such that at every section of the circuit\r\nthe same quantity of electricity crosses in the same time; and this is\r\nthe case, not only in the voltaic current, where it has always been\r\nrecognised, but in those cases in which electricity has been generally\r\nsupposed to be accumulated in certain places. We are thus led to a very\r\nremarkable consequence of the theory which we are examining, namely,\r\nthat the motions of electricity are like those of an _incompressible_\r\nfluid, so that the total quantity within an imaginary fixed closed\r\nsurface remains always the same.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar features of the theory as developed in this book are as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThat the energy of electrification resides in the dielectric medium,\r\nwhether that medium be solid or gaseous, dense or rare, or even deprived\r\nof ordinary gross matter, provided that it be still capable of\r\ntransmitting electrical action.\r\n\r\nThat the energy in any part of the medium is stored up in the form of a\r\nconstraint called polarisation, dependent on the resultant electromotive\r\nforce (the difference of potentials between two conductors) at the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThat electromotive force acting on a dielectric produces what we call\r\nelectric displacement.\r\n\r\nThat in fluid dielectrics the electric polarisation is accompanied by a\r\ntension in the direction of the lines of force combined with an equal\r\npressure in all directions at right angles to the lines of force.\r\n\r\nThat the surfaces of any elementary portion into which we may conceive\r\nthe volume of the dielectric divided must be conceived to be\r\nelectrified, so that the surface density at any point of the surface is\r\nequal in magnitude to the displacement through that point of the surface\r\n_reckoned inwards_.\r\n\r\nThat, whatever electricity may be, the phenomena which we have called\r\nelectric displacement is a movement of electricity in the same sense as\r\nthe transference of a definite quantity of electricity through a wire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Theories of Magnetism_\r\n\r\nCertain bodies--as, for instance, the iron ore called loadstone, the\r\nearth itself, and pieces of steel which have been subjected to certain\r\ntreatment--are found to possess the following properties, and are called\r\nmagnets.\r\n\r\nIf a magnet be suspended so as to turn freely about a vertical axis, it\r\nwill in general tend to set itself in a certain azimuth, and, if\r\ndisturbed from this position, it will oscillate about it.\r\n\r\nIt is found that the force which acts on the body tends to cause a\r\ncertain line in the body--called the axis of the magnet--to become\r\nparallel to a certain line in space, called the \"direction of the\r\nmagnetic force.\"\r\n\r\nThe ends of a long thin magnet are commonly called its poles, and like\r\npoles repel each other; while unlike poles attract each other. The\r\nrepulsion between the two magnetic poles is in the straight line joining\r\nthem, and is numerically equal to the products of the strength of the\r\npoles divided by the square of the distance between them; that is, it\r\nvaries as the inverse square of the distance. Since the form of the law\r\nof magnetic action is identical with that of electric action, the same\r\nreasons which can be given for attributing electric phenomena to the\r\naction of one \"fluid,\" or two \"fluids\" can also be used in favour of the\r\nexistence of a magnetic matter, fluid or otherwise, provided new laws\r\nare introduced to account for the actual facts.\r\n\r\nAt all parts of the earth's surface, except some parts of the polar\r\nregions, one end of a magnet points in a northerly direction and the\r\nother in a southerly one. Now a bar of iron held parallel to the\r\ndirection of the earth's magnetic force is found to become magnetic. Any\r\npiece of soft iron placed in a magnetic field is found to exhibit\r\nmagnetic properties. These are phenomena of _induced_ magnetism. Poisson\r\nsupposes the magnetism of iron to consist in a separation of the\r\nmagnetic fluids within each magnetic molecule. Weber's theory differs\r\nfrom this in assuming that the molecules of the iron are always magnets,\r\neven before the application of the magnetising force, but that in\r\nordinary iron the magnetic axes of the molecules are turned\r\nindifferently in every direction, so that the iron as a whole exhibits\r\nno magnetic properties; and this theory agrees very well with what is\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe theories establish the fact that magnetisation is a phenomenon, not\r\nof large masses of iron, but of molecules; that is to say, of portions\r\nof the substance so small that we cannot by any mechanical method cut\r\nthem in two, so as to obtain a north pole separate from the south pole.\r\nWe have arrived at no explanation, however, of the nature of a magnetic\r\nmolecule, and we have therefore to consider the hypothesis of\r\nAmpère--that the magnetism of the molecule is due to an electric current\r\nconstantly circulating in some closed path within it.\r\n\r\nAmpère concluded that if magnetism is to be explained by means of\r\nelectric currents, these currents must circulate within the molecules of\r\nthe magnet, and cannot flow from one molecule to another. As we cannot\r\nexperimentally measure the magnetic action at a point within the\r\nmolecule, this hypothesis cannot be disproved in the same way that we\r\ncan disprove the hypothesis of sensible currents within the magnet. In\r\nspite of its apparent complexity, Ampère's theory greatly extends our\r\nmathematical vision into the interior of the molecules.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--The Electro-Magnetic Theory of Light_\r\n\r\nWe explain electro-magnetic phenomena by means of mechanical action\r\ntransmitted from one body to another by means of a medium occupying the\r\nspace between them. The undulatory theory of light also assumes the\r\nexistence of a medium. We have to show that the properties of the\r\nelectro-magnetic medium are identical with those of the luminiferous\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\nTo fill all space with a new medium whenever any new phenomena are to be\r\nexplained is by no means philosophical, but if the study of two\r\ndifferent branches of science has independently suggested the idea of a\r\nmedium; and if the properties which must be attributed to the medium in\r\norder to account for electro-magnetic phenomena are of the same kind as\r\nthose which we attribute to the luminiferous medium in order to account\r\nfor the phenomena of light, the evidence for the physical existence of\r\nthe medium is considerably strengthened.\r\n\r\nAccording to the theory of emission, the transmission of light energy is\r\neffected by the actual transference of light-corpuscles from the\r\nluminous to the illuminated body. According to the theory of undulation\r\nthere is a material medium which fills the space between the two bodies,\r\nand it is by the action of contiguous parts of this medium that the\r\nenergy is passed on, from one portion to the next, till it reaches the\r\nilluminated body. The luminiferous medium is therefore, during the\r\npassage of light through it, a receptacle of energy. This energy is\r\nsupposed to be partly potential and partly kinetic, and our theory\r\nagrees with the undulatory theory in assuming the existence of a medium\r\ncapable of becoming a receptacle for two forms of energy.\r\n\r\nNow, the properties of bodies are capable of quantitative measurement.\r\nWe therefore obtain the numerical value of some property of the\r\nmedium--such as the velocity with which a disturbance is propagated in\r\nit, which can be calculated from experiments, and also observed directly\r\nin the case of light. If it be found that the velocity of propagation of\r\nelectro-magnetic disturbance is the same as the velocity of light, we\r\nhave strong reasons for believing that light is an electro-magnetic\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, found that the velocity of light and the velocity of\r\npropagation of electro-magnetic disturbance are quantities of the same\r\norder of magnitude. Neither of them can be said to have been determined\r\naccurately enough to say that one is greater than the other. In the\r\nmeantime, our theory asserts that the quantities are equal, and assigns\r\na physical reason for this equality, and it is not contradicted by the\r\ncomparison of the results, such as they are.\r\n\r\nLorenz has deduced from Kirchoff's equations of electric currents a new\r\nset of equations, indicating that the distribution of force in the\r\nelectro-magnetic field may be considered as arising from the mutual\r\naction of contiguous elements, and that waves, consisting of transverse\r\nelectric currents, may be propagated, with a velocity comparable with\r\nthat of light, in non-conducting media. These conclusions are similar to\r\nmy own, though obtained by an entirely different method.\r\n\r\nThe most important step in establishing a relation between electric and\r\nmagnetic phenomena and those of light must be the discovery of some\r\ninstance in which one set of phenomena is affected by the other. Faraday\r\nsucceeded in establishing such a relation, and the experiments by which\r\nhe did so are described in the nineteen series of his \"Experimental\r\nResearches.\" Suffice it to state here that he showed that in the case of\r\naray of plane-polarised light the effect of the magnetic force is to\r\nturn the plane of polarisation round the direction of the ray as an\r\naxis, through a certain angle.\r\n\r\nThe action of magnetism on polarised light leads to the conclusion that\r\nin a medium under the action of a magnetic force, something belonging to\r\nthe same mathematical class as an angular velocity, whose axis is in the\r\ndirection of the magnetic force, forms part of the phenomenon. This\r\nangular velocity cannot be any portion of the medium of sensible\r\ndimensions rotating as a whole. We must, therefore, conceive the\r\nrotation to be that of very small portions of the medium, each rotating\r\non its own axis.\r\n\r\nThis is the hypothesis of molecular vortices. The displacements of the\r\nmedium during the propagation of light will produce a disturbance of the\r\nvortices, and the vortices, when so disturbed, may react on the medium\r\nso as to affect the propagation of the ray. The theory proposed is of a\r\nprovisional kind, resting as it does on unproved hypotheses relating to\r\nthe nature of molecular vortices, and the mode in which they are\r\naffected by the displacement of the medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--Action at a Distance_\r\n\r\nThere appears to be some prejudice, or _a priori_ objection, against the\r\nhypothesis of a medium in which the phenomena of radiation of light and\r\nheat, and the electric actions at a distance, take place. It is true\r\nthat at one time those who speculated as to the cause of physical\r\nphenomena were in the habit of accounting for each kind of action at a\r\ndistance by means of a special æthereal fluid, whose function and\r\nproperty it was to produce these actions. They filled all space three\r\nand four times over with æthers of different kinds, the properties of\r\nwhich consisted merely to \"save appearances,\" so that more rational\r\ninquirers were willing to accept not only Newton's definite law of\r\nattraction at a distance, but even the dogma of Cotes that action at a\r\ndistance is one of the primary properties of matter, and that no\r\nexplanation can be more intelligible than this fact. Hence the\r\nundulatory theory of light has met with much opposition, directed not\r\nagainst its failure to explain the phenomena, but against its assumption\r\nof the existence of a medium in which light is propagated.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical expression for electro-dynamic action led, in the mind\r\nof Gauss, to the conviction that a theory of the propagation of electric\r\naction would in time be found to be the very keystone of\r\nelectro-dynamics. Now, we are unable to conceive of propagation in time,\r\nexcept either as the flight of a material substance through space or as\r\nthe propagation of a condition of motion or stress in a medium already\r\nexisting in space.\r\n\r\nIn the theory of Neumann, the mathematical conception called potential,\r\nwhich we are unable to conceive as a material substance, is supposed to\r\nbe projected from one particle to another, in a manner which is quite\r\nindependent of a medium, and which, as Neumann has himself pointed out,\r\nis extremely different from that of the propagation of light. In other\r\ntheories it would appear that the action is supposed to be propagated in\r\na manner somewhat more similar to that of light.\r\n\r\nBut in all these theories the question naturally occurs: \"If something\r\nis transmitted from one particle to another at a distance, what is its\r\ncondition after it had left the one particle, and before it reached the\r\nother?\" If this something is the potential energy of the two particles,\r\nas in Neumann's theory, how are we to conceive this energy as existing\r\nin a point of space coinciding neither with the one particle nor with\r\nthe other? In fact, whenever energy is transmitted from one body to\r\nanother in time, there must be a medium or substance in which the energy\r\nexists after it leaves one body, and before it reaches the other, for\r\nenergy, as Torricelli remarked, \"is a quintessence of so subtile a\r\nnature that it cannot be contained in any vessel except the inmost\r\nsubstance of material things.\"\r\n\r\nHence all these theories lead to the conception of a medium in which the\r\npropagation takes place, and if we admit this medium as an hypothesis, I\r\nthink we ought to endeavour to construct a mental representation of all\r\nthe details of its action, and this has been my constant aim in this\r\ntreatise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIE METCHNIKOFF\r\n\r\nThe Nature of Man\r\n\r\n     Elie Metchnikoff, Sub-Director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris,\r\n     was born May 15, 1845, in the province of Kharkov, Russia, and has\r\n     worked at the Pasteur Institute since 1888. The greater part of\r\n     Metchnikoff's work is concerned with the most intimate processes of\r\n     the body, and notably the means by which it defends itself from the\r\n     living agents of disease. He is, indeed, the author of a standard\r\n     treatise entitled \"Immunity in Infective Diseases.\" His early work\r\n     in zoology led him to study the water-flea, and thence to discover\r\n     that the white cells of the human blood oppose, consume, and\r\n     destroy invading microbes. Latterly, Metchnikoff has devoted\r\n     himself in some measure to more general and especially\r\n     philosophical studies, the outcome of which is best represented by\r\n     the notable volume on \"The Nature of Man,\" which was published at\r\n     Paris in 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Disharmonies in Nature_\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the real advance made by science, it cannot be disputed\r\nthat a general uneasiness disturbs the whole world to-day, and the\r\nfrequency of suicide is increased greatly among civilised peoples. Yet\r\nif science turns to study human nature, there may be grounds for hope.\r\nThe Greeks held human nature and the human body in high esteem, and\r\namong the Romans such a philosopher as Seneca said, \"Take nature as your\r\nguide, for so reason bids you and advises you; to live happily is to\r\nlive naturally.\" In our own day Herbert Spencer has expressed again the\r\nGreek ideal, seeking the foundation of morality in human nature itself.\r\n\r\nBut it has often been taught that human nature is composed of two\r\nhostile elements, a body and a soul. The soul alone was to be honoured,\r\nwhile the body was regarded as the vile source of evils. This doctrine\r\nhas had many disastrous consequences, and it is not surprising that in\r\nconsequence of it celibacy should have been regarded as the ideal state.\r\nArt fell from the Greek ideal until the Renaissance, with its return to\r\nthat ideal, brought new vigour. When the ancient spirit was born again\r\nits influence reached science and even religion, and the Reformation was\r\na defence of human nature. The Lutheran doctrines resumed the principle\r\nof a \"development as complete as possible of all the natural powers\" of\r\nman, and compulsory celibacy was abolished.\r\n\r\nThe historical diversity of opinion regarding human nature is what has\r\nled me to the attempt to give an exposition of human nature in its\r\nstrength and in its weakness. But, before dealing with the man himself,\r\nwe must survey the lower forms of life.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the organised world, before the appearnace of man, teach us\r\nthat though we find change and development, development does not always\r\ntake a progressive march. We are bound to believe, for instance, that\r\nthe latest products of evolution are not human beings, but certain\r\nparasites which live only upon, or in, the human body. The law in nature\r\nis not of constant progress, but of constant tendency towards\r\nadaptation. Exquisite adaptations, or harmonies, in nature are\r\nconstantly met with in the world of living beings. But, on the other\r\nhand, any close investigation of organisation and life reveals that\r\nbeside many most perfect harmonies, there are facts which prove the\r\nexistence of incomplete harmony, or even absolute disharmony.\r\nRudimentary and useless organs are widely distributed. Many insects are\r\nexquisitely adapted for sucking the nectar of flowers; many others would\r\nwish to do the same, but their want of adaptation baffles them.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that an instinct, or any other form of disharmony, leading\r\nto destruction, cannot increase or even endure very long. The perversion\r\nof the maternal instinct, tending to abandonment of the young, is\r\ndestructive to the stock. In consequence, individuals affected by it do\r\nnot have the opportunity of transmitting the perversion. If all rabbits,\r\nor a majority of them, left their young to die through neglect, it is\r\nevident that the species would soon die out. On the contrary, mothers\r\nguided by their instinct to nourish and foster their offspring will\r\nproduce a vigorous generation capable of transmitting the healthy\r\nmaternal instinct so essential for the preservation of the species. For\r\nsuch a reason harmonious characters are more abundant in nature than\r\ninjurious peculiarities. The latter, because they are injurious to the\r\nindividual and to the species, cannot perpetuate themselves\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nIn this way there comes about a constant selection of characters. The\r\nuseful qualities are handed down and preserved, while noxious characters\r\nperish and so disappear. Although disharmonies tend to the destruction\r\nof a species, they may themselves disappear without having destroyed the\r\nrace in which they occur.\r\n\r\nThis continuous process of natural selection, which offers so good an\r\nexplanation of the transmutation and origin of species by means of\r\npreservation of useful and destruction of harmful characters, was\r\ndiscovered by Darwin and Wallace, and was established by the splendid\r\nresearches of the former of these.\r\n\r\nLong before the appearance of man on the face of the earth, there were\r\nsome happy beings well adapted to their environment, and some unhappy\r\ncreatures that followed disharmonious instincts so as to imperil or to\r\ndestroy their lives. Were such creatures capable of reflection and\r\ncommunication, plainly the fortunate among them, such as orchids and\r\ncertain wasps, would be on the side of the optimists; they would declare\r\nthis the best of all possible worlds, and insist that to secure\r\nhappiness it is necessary only to follow natural instincts. On the other\r\nhand, the disharmonious creatures, those ill adapted to the conditions\r\nof life, would be pessimistic philosophers. Consider the case of the\r\nladybird, driven by hunger and with a preference for honey, which\r\nsearches for it on flowers and meets only with failure, or of insects\r\ndriven by their instincts into the flames, only to lose their wings and\r\ntheir lives; such creatures, plainly, would express as their idea of the\r\nworld that it was fashioned abominably, and that existence was a\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Disharmonies in Man_\r\n\r\nAs for man, the creature most interesting to us, in what category does\r\nhe fall? Is he a being whose nature is in harmony with the conditions in\r\nwhich he has to live, or is he out of harmony with his environment? A\r\ncritical examination is needed to answer these questions, and to such an\r\nexamination the pages to follow are devoted.\r\n\r\nScience has proved that man is closely akin to the higher monkeys or\r\nanthropoid apes--a fact which we must reckon with if we are to\r\nunderstand human nature. The details of anatomy which show the kinship\r\nbetween man and the apes are numerous and astonishing. All the facts\r\nbrought to light during the last forty years have supported this truth,\r\nand no single fact has been brought against it. Quite lately it has been\r\nshown that there are remarkable characters in the blood, such that,\r\nthough by certain tests the fluid part of human blood can be readily\r\ndistinguished from that of any other creature, the anthropoid apes, and\r\nthey alone, furnish an exception to this rule. There is thus verily a\r\nclose blood-relationship between the human species and the anthropoid\r\napes.\r\n\r\nBut how man arose we do not know. It is probable that he owes his origin\r\nto a mutation--a sudden change comparable with that which De Vries\r\nobserved in the case of the evening primrose. The new creature possessed\r\na brain of abnormal size placed in a spacious cranium which allowed a\r\nrapid development of intellectual faculties. This peculiarity would be\r\ntransmitted to the descendants, and as it was a very considerable\r\nadvantage in the struggle for existence, the new race would hold its\r\nown, propagate, and prevail.\r\n\r\nAlthough he is a recent arrival on the earth, man has already made great\r\nprogress, as compared with his ancestors the anthropoid apes, and we\r\nlearn the same if we compare the higher and lower races of mankind. Yet\r\nthere remain many disharmonies in the organisation of man, as, for\r\ninstance, in his digestive system. A simple instance of this kind is\r\nfurnished by the wisdom teeth. The complete absence of all four wisdom\r\nteeth has no influence on mastication, and their presence is very\r\nfrequently the source of illness and danger. In man they are indeed\r\nrudimentary organs, providing another proof of our simian origin. The\r\nvermiform appendix, so frequently the cause of illness and death, is\r\nanother rudimentary organ in the human body, together with the part of\r\nthe digestive canal to which it is attached. The organ is a very old\r\npart of the constitution of mammals, and it is because it has been\r\npreserved long after its function has disappeared that we find it\r\noccurring in the body of man.\r\n\r\nI believe that not only the appendix, but a very large part of the\r\nalimentary canal is superfluous, and worse than superfluous. It is, of\r\ncourse, of great importance to the horse, the rabbit, and some other\r\nmammals that live exclusively on grain and herbage. The latter part of\r\nthe alimentary canal, however, must be regarded as one of the organs\r\npossessed by man and yet harmful to his health and life. It is the cause\r\nof a series of misfortunes. The human stomach also is of little value,\r\nand can easily be dispensed with, as surgery has proved. It is because\r\nwe inherit our alimentary canal from creatures of different dietetic\r\nhabits that it is impossible for us to take our nutriment in the most\r\nperfect form. If we were only to eat substances that could be almost\r\ncompletely absorbed, serious complications would be produced. A\r\nsatisfactory system of diet has to make allowance for this, and in\r\nconsequence of the structure of the alimentary canal has to include in\r\nthe food bulky and indigestible materials, such as vegetables. Lastly,\r\nit may be noted that the instinct of appetite in man is largely\r\naberrant. The widespread results of alcoholism show plainly the\r\nprevalent existence in man of a want of harmony between the instinct for\r\nchoosing food and the instinct of preservation.\r\n\r\nFar stronger than the social instinct, and far older, is the love of\r\nlife and the instinct of self-preservation. Devices for the protection\r\nof life were developed long before the evolution of mankind, and it is\r\nquite certain that animals, even those highest in the scale of life, are\r\nunconscious of the inevitability of death and the ultimate fate of all\r\nliving things. This knowledge is a human acquisition. It has long been\r\nrecognised that the old attach a higher value to life than do the young.\r\nThe instinctive love of life and fear of death are of importance in the\r\nstudy of human nature, impossible to over-estimate.\r\n\r\nThe instinctive love of life is preserved in the aged in its strongest\r\nform. I have carefully studied the aged to make certain on this point.\r\nIt is a terrible disharmony that the instinctive love of life should\r\nmanifest itself so strongly when death is felt to be so near at hand.\r\nHence the religions of all times have been concerned with the problem of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Science the Only Remedy for Human Disharmonies_\r\n\r\nIn religion and in philosophy throughout their whole history we find\r\nattempts to combat the ills arising from the disharmonies of the human\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nAncient and modern philosophies, like ancient and modern religions, have\r\nconcerned themselves with the attempt to remedy the ills of human\r\nexistence, and instinctive fear of death has always ensured that great\r\nattention has been paid to the doctrine of immortality.\r\n\r\nScience, the youngest daughter of knowledge, has begun to investigate\r\nthe great problems affecting humanity. Her first steps, taken along the\r\nlines first clearly laid down by Bacon, were slow and halting. But\r\nmedical science has lately made great progress, and has gone very far to\r\ncontrol disease, especially in consequence of the work of Pasteur. It is\r\nsaid that science has failed because, for instance, tuberculosis\r\npersists, but tuberculosis is propagated not because of the failure of\r\nscience, but because of the ignorance and stupidity of the population.\r\nTo diminish the spread of tuberculosis, of typhoid fever, of dysentery,\r\nand of many other diseases, it is necessary only to follow the rules of\r\nscientific hygiene without waiting for specific remedies.\r\n\r\nScience offers us much hope also when it is directed to the study of old\r\nage and the phenomena which lead to death.\r\n\r\nMan, who is the descendant of some anthropoid ape, has inherited a\r\nconstitution adapted to an environment very different from that which\r\nnow surrounds him. He is possessed of a brain very much more highly\r\ndeveloped than that of his ancestors, and has entered on a new path in\r\nthe evolution of the higher organisms. The sudden change in his natural\r\nconditions has brought about a large series of organic disharmonies,\r\nwhich become more and more acutely felt as he becomes more intelligent\r\nand more sensitive; and thus there has arisen a number of sorrows which\r\npoor humanity has tried to relieve by all the means in its power.\r\nHumanity in its misery has put question after question to science, and\r\nhas lost patience at the slowness of the advance of knowledge. It has\r\ndeclared that the answers already found by science are futile and of\r\nlittle interest. But science, confident of its methods, has quietly\r\ncontinued to work. Little by little the answers to some of the\r\nquestions that have been set have begun to appear.\r\n\r\nMan, because of the fundamental disharmonies in his constitution, does\r\nnot develop normally. The earlier phases of his development are passed\r\nthrough with little trouble; but after maturity greater or lesser\r\nabnormality begins, and ends in old age and death that are premature and\r\npathological. Is not the goal of existence the accomplishment of a\r\ncomplete and physiological cycle in which occurs a normal old age,\r\nending in the loss of the instinct of life and the appearance of the\r\ninstinct of death? But before attaining the normal end, coming after the\r\nappearance of the instinct of death, a normal life must be lived; a life\r\nfilled all through with the feeling that comes from the accomplishment\r\nof function. Science has been able to tell us that man, the descendant\r\nof animals, has good and evil qualities in his nature, and that his life\r\nis made unhappy by the evil qualities.\r\n\r\nBut the constitution of man is not immutable, and perhaps it may be\r\nchanged for the better. Morality should be based not on human nature in\r\nits existing condition, but on ideal human nature, as it may be in the\r\nfuture. Before all things, it is necessary to try to amend the evolution\r\nof human life, that is to say, to transform its disharmonies into\r\nharmonies. This task can be undertaken only by science, and to science\r\nthe opportunity of accomplishing it must be given. Before it is possible\r\nto reach the goal mankind must be persuaded that science is all-powerful\r\nand that the deeply-rooted existing superstitions are pernicious. It\r\nwill be necessary to reform many customs and many institutions that now\r\nseem to rest on enduring foundations. The abandonment of much that is\r\nhabitual, and a revolution in the mode of education, will require long\r\nand painful effort. But the conviction that science alone is able to\r\nredress the disharmonies of the human constitution will lead directly to\r\nthe improvement of education and to the solidarity of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prolongation of Life\r\n\r\n     Professor Metchnikoff's volume, on \"The Prolongation of Life:\r\n     Studies in Optimistic Philosophy,\" was published in 1907, and is in\r\n     some respects the most original of his works. In it he carries much\r\n     further the arguments and the studies to which he made brief\r\n     allusion in \"The Nature of Man,\" and he lays down certain\r\n     principles for the prolongation of life which have been put into\r\n     practice by a large number of people during the last two or three\r\n     years, and are steadily gaining more attention. Sour milk as an\r\n     article of diet appears to have a peculiar value in arresting the\r\n     supposed senile changes which are largely due to auto-intoxication\r\n     or self-poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Senile Debility_\r\n\r\nWhen we study old age in man and the lower animals, we observe certain\r\nfeatures common to both. But often among vertebrates there are found\r\nanimals whose bodies withstand the ravages of time much better than that\r\nof man. I think it a fair inference that senility, that precocious\r\nsenescence which is one of the greatest sorrows of humanity, is not so\r\nprofoundly seated in the constitution of the higher animals as has\r\ngenerally been supposed. The first facts which we must accept are that\r\nhuman beings who reach extreme old age may preserve their mental\r\nqualities, notwithstanding serious physical decay, and that certain of\r\nthe higher animals can resist the influence of time much longer than is\r\nthe case with man under present conditions.\r\n\r\nMany theories have been advanced regarding the cause of senility. It is\r\ncertain that many parts of the body continue to thrive and grow even in\r\nold age, as, for instance, the nails and hair. But I believe that I have\r\nproved that in many parts of the body, especially the higher elements,\r\nsuch as nervous and muscular cells, there is a destruction due to the\r\nactivity of the white cells of the blood. I have shown also that the\r\nblanching of the hair in old age is due to the activity of these white\r\ncells, which destroy the hair pigment. Progressive muscular debility is\r\nan accompaniment of old age; physical work is seldom given to men over\r\nsixty years of age, as it is notorious that they are less capable of it.\r\nTheir muscular movements are feebler, and soon bring on fatigue; their\r\nactions are slow and painful. Even old men whose mental vigour is\r\nunimpaired admit their muscular weakness. The physical correlate of this\r\ncondition is an actual atrophy of the muscles, and has for long been\r\nknown to observers. I have found that the cause of this atrophy is the\r\nconsumption of the muscle fibres by what I call phagocytes, or eating\r\ncells, a certain kind of white blood cells.\r\n\r\nIn the case of certain diseases we find symptoms, which look like\r\nprecocious senility, due to the poison of the disease. It is no mere\r\nanalogy to suppose that human senescence is the result of a slow but\r\nchronic poisoning of the organism. Such poisons, if not completely\r\ndestroyed or got rid of, weaken the tissues, the functions of which\r\nbecome altered or enfeebled in which the latter have the advantage. But\r\nwe must make further studies before we can answer the question whether\r\nour senescence can be ameliorated.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the life of animals varies within very wide limits. As a\r\ngeneral rule, small animals do not live so long as large ones, but there\r\nis no absolute relation between size and longevity, since parrots,\r\nravens, and geese live much longer than many mammals, and than some much\r\nlarger birds. Buffon long ago argued that the total duration of life\r\nbore some definite relation to the length of the period of growth, but\r\nfurther inquiry shows that such a relation cannot be established.\r\nNevertheless, there is something intrinsic in each kind of animal which\r\nsets a definite limit to the length of years it can attain. The purely\r\nphysiological conditions which determine this limit leave room for a\r\nconsiderable amount of variation in longevity. Duration of life,\r\ntherefore, is a character which can be influenced by the environment.\r\n\r\nThe duration of life in mammals is relatively shorter than in birds, and\r\nin the so-called cold-blooded vertebrates. No indication as to the cause\r\nof this difference can be found elsewhere than in the organs of\r\ndigestion. Mammals are the only group of vertebrate animals in which the\r\nlarge intestine is much developed. This part of the alimentary canal is\r\nnot important, for it fulfils no notable digestive function. On the\r\nother hand, it accommodates among the intestinal flora many microbes\r\nwhich damage health by poisoning the body with their products. Among the\r\nintestinal flora there are many microbes which are inoffensive, but\r\nothers are known to have pernicious properties, and auto-intoxication,\r\nor self-poisoning, is the cause of the ill-health which may be traced to\r\ntheir activity. It is indubitable that the intestinal microbes or their\r\npoisons may reach the system generally, and bring harm to it. I infer\r\nfrom the facts that the more the digestive tract is charged with\r\nmicrobes, the more it is a source of harm capable of shortening life. As\r\nthe large intestine not only is that part of the digestive tube most\r\nrichly charged with microbes, but is relatively more capacious in\r\nmammals than in any other vertebrates, it is a just inference that the\r\nduration of life of mammals has been notably shortened as the result of\r\nchronic poisoning from an abundant intestinal flora.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to study the duration of human life, it is impossible to\r\naccept the view that the high mortality between the ages of seventy and\r\nseventy-five indicates a natural limit to human life. The fact that many\r\nmen from seventy to seventy-five years old are well preserved, both\r\nphysically and intellectually, makes it impossible to regard that age as\r\nthe natural limit of human life. Philosophers such as Plato, poets such\r\nas Goethe and Victor Hugo, artists such as Michael Angelo, Titian, and\r\nFranz Hals, produced some of their most important works when they had\r\npassed what some regard as the limit of life. Moreover, deaths of people\r\nat that age are rarely due to senile debility. Centenarians are really\r\nnot rare. In France, for instance, nearly 150 centenarians die every\r\nyear, and extreme longevity is not limited to the white races. Women\r\nmore frequently become centenarians than men--a fact which supports the\r\ngeneral proposition that male mortality is always greater than that of\r\nthe other sex.\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that most centenarians have been people who were\r\npoor or in humble circumstances, and whose life has been extremely\r\nsimple. It may well be said that great riches do not bring a very long\r\nlife. Poverty generally brings with it sobriety, especially in old age,\r\nand sobriety is certainly favourable to long life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--The Study of Natural Death_\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to find how little science really knows about death. By\r\nnatural death I mean to denote death due to the nature of the organism,\r\nand not to disease. We may ask whether natural death really occurs,\r\nsince death so frequently comes by accident or by disease; and certainly\r\nthe longevity of many plants is amazing. Such ages as three, four, and\r\nfive thousand years are attributed to the baobab at Cape Verd, certain\r\ncypresses, and the sequoias of California. It is plain that among the\r\nlower and higher plants there are cases where natural death does not\r\nexist; and, further, so far as I can ascertain, it looks as if poisons\r\nproduced by their own bodies were the cause of natural death among the\r\nhigher plants where it does occur.\r\n\r\nIn the human race cases of what may be called natural death are\r\nextremely rare; the death of old people is usually due to infectious\r\ndisease, particularly pneumonia, or to apoplexy. The close analogy\r\nbetween natural death and sleep supports my view that it is due to an\r\nauto-intoxication of the organism, since it is very probable that sleep\r\nis due to \"poisoning\" by the products of organic activity.\r\n\r\nAlthough the duration of the life of man is one of the longest amongst\r\nmammals, men find it too short. Ought we to listen to the cry of\r\nhumanity that life is too short, and that it will be well to prolong it?\r\nIf the question were merely one of prolonging the life of old people,\r\nwithout modifying old age itself, the answer would be doubtful. It must\r\nbe understood, however, that the prolongation of life will be associated\r\nwith the preservation of intelligence and of the power to work. When we\r\nhave reduced or abolished such causes of precocious senility as\r\nintemperance and disease, it will no longer be necessary to give\r\npensions at the age of sixty or seventy years. The cost of supporting\r\nthe old, instead of increasing, will diminish progressively. We must use\r\nall our endeavors to allow men to complete their normal course of life,\r\nand to make it possible for old men to play their parts as advisers and\r\njudges, endowed with their long experience of life.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial suggestions have been made for the prolongation of\r\nlife. Many elixirs have been sought and supposed to have been found, but\r\ngeneral hygienic measures have been the most successful in prolonging\r\nlife and in lessening the ills of old age. That is the teaching of Sir\r\nHerman Weber, himself of very great age, who advises general hygienic\r\nprinciples, and especially moderation in all respects. He advises us to\r\navoid alcohol and other stimulants, as well as narcotics and soothing\r\ndrugs. Certainly the prolongation of life which has come to pass in\r\nrecent centuries must be attributed to the advance of hygiene; and if\r\nhygiene was able to prolong life when little developed, as was the case\r\nuntil recently, we may well believe that with our greater knowledge a\r\nmuch better result will be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--The Use of Lactic Acid_\r\n\r\nThe general measures of hygiene directed against infectious diseases\r\nplay a part in prolonging the lives of old people; but, in addition to\r\nthe microbes which invade the body from outside, there is a rich source\r\nof harm in microbes which inhabit the body. The most important of these\r\nbelong to the intestinal flora which is abundant and varied. Now the\r\nattempt to destroy the intestinal microbes by the use of chemical agents\r\nhas little chance of success, and the intestine itself may be harmed\r\nmore than the microbes. If, however, we observe the new-born child we\r\nfind that, when suckled by its mother, its intestinal microbes are very\r\ndifferent and much fewer than if it be fed with cows' milk. I am\r\nstrongly convinced that it is advantageous to protect ourselves by\r\ncooking all kinds of food which, like cows' milk, are exposed to the\r\nair. It is well-known that other means--as, for instance, the use of\r\nlactic acid--will prevent food outside the body from going bad. Now as\r\nlactic fermentation serves so well to arrest putrefaction in general,\r\nwhy should it not be used for the same purpose within the digestive\r\ntube? It has been clearly proved that the microbes which produce lactic\r\nacid can, and do, control the growth of other microbes within the body,\r\nand that the lactic microbe is so much at home in the human body that it\r\nis to be found there several weeks after it has been swallowed.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial human beings have absorbed quantities of lactic\r\nmicrobes by consuming in the uncooked condition substances such as\r\nsoured milk, kephir, sauerkraut, or salted cucumbers, which have\r\nundergone lactic fermentation. By these means they have unknowingly\r\nlessened the evil consequences of intestinal putrefaction. The fact that\r\nso many races make soured milk and use it copiously is an excellent\r\ntestimony to its usefulness, and critical inquiry shows that longevity,\r\nwith few traces of senility, is conspicuous amongst peoples who use sour\r\nmilk extensively.\r\n\r\nA reader who has little knowledge of such matters may be surprised by my\r\nrecommendation to absorb large quantities of microbes, as the general\r\nbelief is that microbes are all harmful. This belief, however, is\r\nerroneous. There are many useful microbes, amongst which the lactic\r\nbacilli have an honourable place. If it be true that our precocious and\r\nunhappy old age is due to poisoning of the tissues, the greater part of\r\nthe poison coming from the large intestine, inhabited by numberless\r\nmicrobes, it is clear that agents which arrest intestinal putrefaction\r\nmust at the same time postpone and ameliorate old age. This theoretical\r\nview is confirmed by the collection of facts regarding races which live\r\nchiefly on soured milk, and amongst which great ages are common.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--An Ideal Old Age_\r\n\r\nAs I have shown in the \"Nature of Man,\" the human constitution as it\r\nexists to-day, being the result of a long evolution and containing a\r\nlarge animal element, cannot furnish the basis of rational morality. The\r\nconception which has come down from antiquity to modern times, of a\r\nharmonious activity of all the organs, is no longer appropriate to\r\nmankind. Organs which are in course of atrophy must not be re-awakened,\r\nand many natural characters which, perhaps, were useful in the case of\r\nanimals, must be made to disappear in men.\r\n\r\nHuman nature which, like the constitutions of other organisms, is\r\nsubject to evolution, must be modified according to a definite ideal.\r\nJust as a gardener or stock-raiser is not content with the existing\r\nnature of the plants and animals with which he is occupied, but modifies\r\nthem to suit his purposes, so also the scientific philosopher must not\r\nthink of existing human nature as immutable, but must try to modify it\r\nfor the advantage of mankind. As bread is the chief article in the human\r\nfood, attempts to improve cereals have been made for a very long time,\r\nbut in order to obtain results much knowledge is necessary. To modify\r\nthe nature of plants, it is necessary to understand them well, and it is\r\nnecessary to have an ideal to be aimed at. In the case of mankind the\r\nideal of human nature, towards which we ought to press, may be formed.\r\nIn my opinion this ideal is \"orthobiosis\"--that is to say, the\r\ndevelopment of human life, so that it passes through a long period of\r\nold age in active and vigorous health, leading to a final period in\r\nwhich there shall be present a sense of satiety of life, and a wish for\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nJust as we must study the nature of plants before trying to realise our\r\nideal, so also varied and profound knowledge is the first requisite for\r\nthe ideal of moral conduct. It is necessary not only to know the\r\nstructure and functions of the human organism, but to have exact ideas\r\non human life as it is in society. Scientific knowledge is so\r\nindispensable for moral conduct that ignorance must be placed among the\r\nmost immoral acts. A mother who rears her child in defiance of good\r\nhygiene, from want of knowledge, is acting immorally towards her\r\noffspring, notwithstanding her feeling of sympathy. And this also is\r\ntrue of a government which remains in ignorance of the laws which\r\nregulate human life and human society.\r\n\r\nIf the human race come to adopt the principles of orthobiosis, a\r\nconsiderable change in the qualities of men of different ages will\r\nfollow. Old age will be postponed so much that men of from sixty to\r\nseventy years of age will retain their vigour, and will not require to\r\nask assistance in the fashion now necessary. On the other hand, young\r\nmen of twenty-one years of age will no longer be thought mature or ready\r\nto fulfil functions so difficult as taking a share in public affairs.\r\nThe view which I set forth in the \"Nature of Man\" regarding the danger\r\nwhich comes from the present interference of young men in political\r\naffairs has since then been confirmed in the most striking fashion.\r\n\r\nIt is easily intelligible that in the new conditions such modern idols\r\nas universal suffrage, public opinion, and the _referendum_, in which\r\nthe ignorant masses are called on to decide questions which demand\r\nvaried and profound knowledge, will last no longer than the old idols.\r\nThe progress of human knowledge will bring about the replacement of such\r\ninstitutions by others, in which applied morality will be controlled by\r\nthe really competent persons. I permit myself to suppose that in these\r\ntimes scientific training will be much more general than it is just now,\r\nand that it will occupy the place which it deserves in education and in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nOur intelligence informs us that man is capable of much, and, therefore,\r\nwe hope that he may be able to modify his own nature and transform his\r\ndisharmonies into harmonies. It is only human will that can attain this\r\nideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGH MILLER\r\n\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone\r\n\r\n     Hugh Miller was born in Cromarty, in the North of Scotland, October\r\n     10, 1802. From the time he was seventeen until he was thirty-four,\r\n     he worked as a common stone-mason, although devoting his leisure\r\n     hours to independent researches in natural history, for which he\r\n     formed a taste early in life. He became interested in journalism,\r\n     and was editor of the Edinburgh \"Witness,\" when, in 1840, he\r\n     published the contents of the volume issued a year later as \"The\r\n     Old Red Sandstone.\" The book deals with its author's most\r\n     distinctive work, namely, finding fossils that tell much of the\r\n     history of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, and fixing in the\r\n     geological scale the place to which the larger beds of remains\r\n     found in the system belong. Besides being a practical and original\r\n     geologist, Miller had a fine imaginative power, which enabled him\r\n     to reconstruct the past from its ruinous relics. The fact that he\r\n     unfortunately set himself the task of combating the theory of\r\n     evolution, which was fast gaining ground in his day, should not\r\n     blind us to the high value of his geological experiences. The\r\n     results of his observations provide some of the most cogent proofs\r\n     of the theory he disputed. Late in life Miller's mind gave way, and\r\n     he put an end to his own life on December 24, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--A Stone-mason's Researches_\r\n\r\nMy advice to young working men desirous of bettering their\r\ncircumstances, and adding to the amount of their enjoyment, is to seek\r\nhappiness in study. Learn to make a right use of your eyes; the\r\ncommonest things are worth looking at--even stones, weeds, and the most\r\nfamiliar animals. There are none of the intellectual or moral faculties,\r\nthe exercise of which does not lead to enjoyment; hence it is that\r\nhappiness bears so little reference to station.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago I made my first acquaintance with a life of labour and\r\nrestraint. I was but a slim, loose-jointed boy at the time, fond of the\r\npretty intangibilities of romance, and of dreaming when broad awake;\r\nand, woful change! I was now going to work in a quarry. I was going to\r\nexchange all my day-dreams for the kind of life in which men toil every\r\nday that they may be enabled to eat, and eat every day that they may be\r\nenabled to toil!\r\n\r\nThat first day was no very formidable beginning of the course of life I\r\nhad so much dreaded. To be sure, my hands were a little sore, and I felt\r\nnearly as much fatigued as if I had been climbing among the rocks; but I\r\nhad wrought and been useful, and had yet enjoyed the day fully as much\r\nas usual. I was as light of heart next morning as any of my\r\nbrother-workmen. That night, arising out of my employment, I found I had\r\nfood enough for thought without once thinking of the unhappiness of a\r\nlife of labour.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day I picked up a nodular mass of blue limestone,\r\nand laid it open by a stroke of the hammer. Wonderful to relate, it\r\ncontained inside a beautifully finished piece of sculpture, one of the\r\nvolutes, apparently, of an Ionic capital. Was there another such\r\ncuriosity in the whole world? I broke open a few other nodules of\r\nsimilar appearance, and found that there might be. In one of these there\r\nwere what seemed to be scales of fishes and the impressions of a few\r\nminute bivalves, prettily striated; in the centre of another there was\r\nactually a piece of decayed wood.\r\n\r\nOf all nature's riddles these seemed to me to be at once the most\r\ninteresting and the most difficult to expound. I treasured them\r\ncarefully up, and was told by one of the workmen to whom I showed them\r\nthat there was a part of the shore, about two miles further to the west,\r\nwhere curiously shaped stones, somewhat like the heads of\r\nboarding-pikes, were occasionally picked up, and that in his father's\r\nday the country people called them thunderbolts. Our first half-holiday\r\nI employed in visiting the place where the thunderbolts had fallen so\r\nthickly, and found it a richer scene of wonder than I could have\r\nfancied even in my dreams.\r\n\r\nMy first year of labour came to a close, and I found that the amount of\r\nmy happiness had not been less than in the last of my boyhood. My\r\nknowledge had increased in more than the ratio of former seasons; and as\r\nI had acquired the skill of at least the common mechanic, I had fitted\r\nmyself for independence.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity, once fully awakened, remained awake, and my opportunities\r\nof gratifying it have been tolerably ample. I have been an explorer of\r\ncaves and ravines, a loiterer along sea-shores, a climber among rocks, a\r\nlabourer in quarries. My profession was a wandering one. I remember\r\npassing direct, on one occasion, from the wild western coast of\r\nRoss-shire, where the Old Red Sandstone leans at a high angle against\r\nthe prevailing quartz of the district, to where, on the southern skirts\r\nof Midlothian, the Mountain Limestone rises amid the coal. I have\r\nresided one season on a raised beach of the Moray Firth. I have spent\r\nthe season immediately following amid the ancient granite and contorted\r\nschists of the central Highlands. In the north I have laid open by\r\nthousands the shells and lignites of the oolite; in the south I have\r\ndisinterred from their matrices of stone or of shale the huge reds and\r\ntree ferns of the carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nI advise the stone-mason to acquaint himself with geology. Much of his\r\ntime must be spent amid the rocks and quarries of widely separated\r\nlocalities, and so, in the course of a few years he may pass over the\r\nwhole geological scale, and this, too, with opportunities of observation\r\nat every stage which can be shared with him by only the gentleman of\r\nfortune who devotes his whole time to study. Nay, in some respects, his\r\nadvantages are superior to those of the amateur, for the man whose\r\nemployments have to be carried on in the same formation for months,\r\nperhaps years, enjoys better opportunities of arriving at just\r\nconclusions. There are formations which yield their organisms slowly to\r\nthe discoverer, and the proofs which establish their place in the\r\ngeological scale more tardily still. I was acquainted with the Old Red\r\nSandstone of Ross and Cromarty for nearly ten years ere I ascertained\r\nthat it is richly fossiliferous; I was acquainted with it for nearly ten\r\nyears more ere I could assign its fossils to their exact place in the\r\nscale. Nature is vast and knowledge limited, and no individual need\r\ndespair of adding to the general fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Bridging Life's Gaps_\r\n\r\n\"The Old Red Sandstone,\" says a Scottish geologist in a digest of some\r\nrecent geological discoveries, \"has hitherto been considered as\r\nremarkably barren of fossils.\" Only a few years have gone by since men\r\nof no low standing in the science disputed the very existence of this\r\nformation--or system, rather, for it contains at least three distinct\r\nformations. There are some of our British geologists who still regard it\r\nas a sort of debatable tract, entitled to no independent status, a sort\r\nof common which should be divided.\r\n\r\nIt will be found, however, that this hitherto neglected system yields in\r\nimportance to none of the others, whether we take into account its\r\namazing depth, the great extent to which it is developed both at home\r\nand abroad, the interesting links which it furnishes in the geological\r\nscale, or the vast period of time which it represents. There are\r\nlocalities in which the depth of the Old Red Sandstone fully equals the\r\nelevation of Mount Etna over the level of the sea, and in which it\r\ncontains three distinct groups of organic remains, the one rising in\r\nbeautiful progression over the other.\r\n\r\nMy first statement regarding the system must be much the reverse of the\r\none just quoted, for the fossils are remarkably numerous and in a state\r\nof high preservation. I have a hundred solid proofs by which to\r\nestablish the truth of the assertion within less than a yard of me. Half\r\nmy closet walls are covered with the peculiar fossils of the Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone; and certainly a stranger assemblage of forms has rarely\r\nbeen grouped together--creatures whose very type is lost, fantastic and\r\nuncouth, which puzzle the naturalist to assign them even to their class;\r\nboat-like animals, furnished with oars and a rudder; fish, plated over,\r\nlike the tortoise, above and below, with a strong armour of bone, and\r\nfurnished with but one solitary rudder-like fin; other fish with the\r\nmembranes of their fins thickly covered with scales; creatures bristling\r\nover with thorns; others glistening in an enamelled coat, as if\r\nbeautifully japanned; the tail in every instance among the less\r\nequivocal shapes formed not equally, as in existing fish, on each side\r\nthe central vertebral column, but chiefly on the lower side--the column\r\nsending out its diminished vertebræ to the extreme termination of the\r\nfin. All the forms testify of a remote antiquity. The figures on a\r\nChinese vase or an Egyptian obelisk are scarce more unlike what now\r\nexists in nature than are the fossils of the Lower Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\nLamarck, on the strength of a few striking facts which prove that to a\r\ncertain extent the instincts of species may be improved and heightened,\r\nhas concluded that there is a natural progress from the inferior orders\r\nof being towards the superior, and that the offspring of creatures low\r\nin the scale may belong to a different and nobler species a few thousand\r\nyears hence. Never was there a fancy so wild and extravagant. The\r\nprinciple of adaptation still leaves the vegetable a vegetable, and the\r\ndog a dog. It is true that it is a law of nature that the chain of being\r\nis in some degree a continuous chain, and the various classes of\r\nexistence shade into each other. All the animal families have their\r\nconnecting links. Geology abounds with creatures of the intermediate\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nFishes seem to have been the master existences of two great geological\r\nsystems, mayhap of three, ere the age of reptiles began. Now, fishes\r\ndiffer very much among themselves, some ranking nearly as low as worms,\r\nsome nearly as high as reptiles; and we find in the Old Red Sandstone\r\nseries of links which are wanting in the present creation, and the\r\nabsence of which occasions a wide gap between the two grand divisions of\r\nfishes, the bony and the cartilaginous.\r\n\r\nOf all the organisms of the system one of the most extraordinary is the\r\npterichthys, or winged fish, which the writer had the pleasure of\r\nintroducing to the acquaintance of geologists. Had Lamarck been the\r\ndiscoverer he would unquestionably have held that he had caught a fish\r\nalmost in the act of wishing itself into a bird. There are wings which\r\nwant only feathers, a body which seems to have been as well adapted for\r\npassing through the air as through water, and a tail with which to\r\nsteer.\r\n\r\nMy first idea regarding it was that I had discovered a connecting\r\nlink-between the tortoise and the fish. I submitted some of my specimens\r\nto Mr. Murchison, and they furnished him with additional data by which\r\nto construct the calculations he was then making respecting fossils, and\r\nthey added a new and very singular link to the chain of existence in its\r\nrelation to human knowledge. Agassiz confirmed the conclusions of\r\nMurchison in almost every particular, deciding at once that the creature\r\nmust have been a fish.\r\n\r\nNext to the pterichthys of the Lower Old Red Sandstone I shall place its\r\ncontemporary the coccosteus of Agassiz--a fish which in some respects\r\nmust have resembled it. Both were covered with an armour of thickly\r\ntubercled bony plates, and both furnished with a vertebrated tail. The\r\ncoccosteus seems to have been most abundant. Another of the families of\r\nthe ichthyolites of the Old Red Sandstone--the cephalaspis--seems\r\nalmost to constitute a connecting link between fishes and crustaceans.\r\nIn the present creation fishes are either osseous or cartilaginous, that\r\nis, with bony skeletons, or with a framework of elastic,\r\nsemi-transparent animal matter, like the shark; and the ichthyolites of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone unite these characteristics, resembling in some\r\nrespects the osseous and in others the cartilaginous tribes. Agassiz at\r\nonce confirmed my suspicion that the ichthyolites of the Old Red\r\nSandstone were intermediate. Though it required skill to determine the\r\nplace of the pterichthys and coccosteus there could be no mistaking the\r\nosteolepis--it must have been a fish, and a handsome one, too. But while\r\nits head resembled the heads of the bony fishes, its tail differed in no\r\nrespects from the tails of the cartilaginous ones. And so through the\r\ndiscovery of extinct species the gaps between existing species have been\r\nbridged.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Place-Fixing in the Dim Past_\r\n\r\nThe next step was to fix the exact place of the ichthyolites in the\r\ngeological scale, and this I was enabled to do by finding a large and\r\ncomplete bed _in situ_. Its true place is a little more than a hundred\r\nfeet above the top, and not much more than a hundred yards above the\r\nbase of the great conglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone in Scotland and in England has its lower, middle,\r\nand upper groups--three distinct formations. As the pterichthys and\r\ncoccosteus are the characteristic ichthyolites of the Lower Old Red\r\nformation, so the cephalaspis distinguishes the middle or coronstone\r\ndivision of the system in England. When we pass to the upper formation,\r\nwe find the holoptychius the most characteristic fossil.\r\n\r\nThese fossils are found in a degree of entireness which depends less on\r\ntheir age than on the nature of the rock in which they occur. Limestone\r\nis the preserving salt of the geological world, and the conservative\r\nqualities of the shales and stratified clays of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone are not much inferior to limestone itself; while in the Upper\r\nOld Red the beds of consolidated sand are much less conservative of\r\norganic remains. The older fossils, therefore, can be described almost\r\nas minutely as the existence of the present creation, whereas the newer\r\nfossils exist, except in a few rare cases, as fragments, and demand the\r\npowers of a Cuvier or an Agassiz to restore them to their original\r\ncombinations. On the other hand, while the organisms of the Lower Old\r\nRed are numerous and well preserved, those of the Upper Old Red are much\r\ngreater in individual size. In short, the fish of the lower ocean must\r\nhave ranged in size between a stickleback and a cod; whereas some of the\r\nfish of the ocean of the Upper Sandstone were covered with scales as\r\nlarge as oyster shells, and were armed with teeth that rivalled in size\r\nthose of the crocodile.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--Fish as Nature's Last Word_\r\n\r\nI will now attempt to present to the reader the Old Red Sandstone as it\r\nexisted in time--during the succeeding periods of its formation, and\r\nwhen its existences lived and moved as the denizens of primeval oceans.\r\nWe pass from the cemetery with its heaps of bones to the ancient city\r\nfull of life and animation in all its streets and dwellings.\r\n\r\nBefore we commence our picture, two great geological periods have come\r\nto their close, and the floor of the widely spread ocean is occupied to\r\nthe depth of many thousand feet by the remains of bygone existences. The\r\nrocks of these two earlier periods are those of the Cambrian and\r\nSilurian groups. The lower--Cambrian, representative of the first\r\nglimmering twilight of being--must be regarded as a period of\r\nuncertainty. It remains for future discoverers to determine regarding\r\nthe shapes of life that burrowed in its ooze or careered through the\r\nincumbent waters.\r\n\r\nThere is less doubt respecting the existences of the Silurian rocks.\r\nFour distinct platforms of being range in it, the one over the other,\r\nlike the stories of a building. Life abounded on all these platforms,\r\nand in shapes the most wonderful. In the period of the Upper Silurian\r\nfish, properly so called, and of a very perfect organisation, had taken\r\nprecedence of the crustacean. These most ancient beings of their class\r\nwere cartilaginous fishes, and they appear to have been introduced by\r\nmyriads. Such are the remains of what seem to have been the first\r\nvertebrata.\r\n\r\nThe history of the period represented by the Old Red Sandstone seems, in\r\nwhat now forms the northern half of Scotland, to have opened amid\r\nconfusion and turmoil. The finely laminated Tilestones of England were\r\ndeposited evidently in a calm sea. During the contemporary period the\r\nspace which now includes Orkney, Lochness, Dingwall, Gamrie, and many a\r\nthousand square miles besides, was the scene of a shallow ocean,\r\nperplexed by powerful currents and agitated by waves. A vast stratum of\r\nwater-rolled pebbles, varying in depth from a hundred feet to a hundred\r\nyards, remains, in a thousand different localities, to testify to the\r\ndisturbing agencies of this time of commotion, though it is difficult to\r\nconceive how the bottom of any sea could have been so violently and\r\nequally agitated for so greatly extended a space.\r\n\r\nThe period of this shallow and stormy ocean passed, and the bottom,\r\ncomposed of the identical conglomerate which now forms the summit of\r\nsome of our loftiest mountains, sank to a depth so profound as to be\r\nlittle affected by tides and tempests. During this second period there\r\ntook place a vast deposit of coarse sandstone strata, and the subsidence\r\ncontinued until fully ninety feet had overlaid the conglomerate in\r\nwaters perfectly undisturbed. And here we find the first proof that this\r\nancient ocean literally swarmed with life--that its bottom was covered\r\nwith miniature forests of algae, and its waters darkened by immense\r\nshoals of fish. I have seen the ichthyolite bed where they were as\r\nthickly covered with fossil remains as I have ever seen a fishing-bank\r\ncovered with herrings.\r\n\r\nAt this period some terrible catastrophe involved in sudden destruction\r\nthe fish of an area at least a hundred miles from boundary to boundary,\r\nperhaps much more. The same platform in Orkney as in Cromarty is strewn\r\nthick with remains which exhibit unequivocally the marks of violent\r\ndeath. In what could it have originated? By what quiet but potent agency\r\nof destruction could the innumerable existences of an area perhaps ten\r\nthousand miles in extent be annihilated at once, and yet the medium in\r\nwhich they lived be left undisturbed by its operations? The thought has\r\noften struck me that calcined lime, cast out as ashes from some distant\r\ncrater and carried by the winds, might have been the cause of the widely\r\nspread destruction to which the fossil organisms testify. I have seen\r\nthe fish of a small trouting stream, over which a bridge was in the\r\ncourse of building, destroyed in a single hour, for a full mile below\r\nthe erection, by a few troughfuls of lime that fell into the water when\r\nthe centring was removed.\r\n\r\nThe period of death passed, and over the innumerable dead there settled\r\na soft muddy sediment. For an unknown space of time, represented in the\r\nformation by a deposit about fifty feet in thickness, the waters of the\r\ndepopulated area seem to have remained devoid of life. A few scales and\r\nplates then begin to appear. The fish that had existed outside the chasm\r\nseem to have gradually gained upon it as their numbers increased.\r\n\r\nThe work of deposition went on and sandstone was overlaid by stratified\r\nclay. This upper bed had also its organisms, but the circumstances were\r\nless favourable to the preservation of entire ichthyolites than those in\r\nwhich the organisms were wrapped up in their stony coverings. Age\r\nfollowed age, generations were entombed in ever-growing depositions.\r\nVast periods passed, and it seemed as if the power of the Creator had\r\nreached its extreme limit when fishes had been called into existence,\r\nand our planet was destined to be the dwelling-place of no nobler\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe curtain rises, and the scene is new. The myriads of the lower\r\nformation have disappeared, and we are surrounded on an upper platform\r\nby the existences of a later creation. Shoals of cephalaspides,\r\nfeathered with fins, sweep past. We see the distant gleam of scales,\r\nthat some of the coats glitter with enamel, that others bristle over\r\nwith minute thorny points. A huge crustacean, of uncouth proportions,\r\nstalks over the weedy bottoms, or burrows in the hollows of the banks.\r\nAges and centuries pass--who can sum up their number?--for the depth of\r\nthis middle formation greatly exceeds that of the other two.\r\n\r\nThe curtain rises. A last day had at length come to the period of the\r\nmiddle formation, and in an ocean roughened by waves and agitated by\r\ncurrents we find new races of existences. We may mark the clumsy bulk of\r\nthe Holoptychius conspicuous in the group. The shark family have their\r\nrepresentative as before; a new variety of the pterichthys spreads out\r\nits spear-like wings at every alarm, like its predecessor of the lower\r\nformation. Fish still remained the lords of creation, and their bulk, at\r\nleast, had become immensely more great. We began with an age of dwarfs,\r\nwe end with an age of giants, which is carried on into the lower coal\r\nmeasures. We pursue our history no further?\r\n\r\nHas the last scene in the series arisen? Cuvier asked the question,\r\nhesitated, and then decided in the negative, for he was too intimately\r\nacquainted with the works of the Creator to think of limiting His power,\r\nand he could anticipate a coming period in which man would have to\r\nresign his post of honour to some nobler and wiser creature, the monarch\r\nof a better and happier world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ISAAC NEWTON\r\n\r\nPrincipia\r\n\r\n     Sir Isaac Newton was born at Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England,\r\n     Dec. 25, 1642, the son of a small landed proprietor. For the famous\r\n     episode of the falling apple, Voltaire, who admirably explained his\r\n     system for his countrymen, is responsible. It was in 1680 that\r\n     Newton discovered how to calculate the orbit of a body moving under\r\n     a central force, and showed that if the force varied as the inverse\r\n     square of the distance, the orbit would be an ellipse with the\r\n     centre of force in one focus. The great discovery, which made the\r\n     writing of his \"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\"\r\n     possible, was that the attraction between two spheres is the same\r\n     as it would be if we supposed each sphere condensed to a point at\r\n     its centre. The book was published as a whole in 1687. Of its\r\n     author it was said by Lagrange that not only was he the greatest\r\n     genius that ever existed, but also the most fortunate, \"for we\r\n     cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.\"\r\n     Newton died on March 20, 1727.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur design (writes Newton in his preface) not respecting arts but\r\nphilosophy, and our subject not manual but natural powers, we consider\r\nthose things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the\r\nresistance of fluids and the like forces, whether attractive or\r\nimpulsive; and, therefore, we offer this work as the mathematical\r\nprinciples of philosophy, for all the difficulty of philosophy seems to\r\nconsist in this--from the phenomena of motions to investigate the forces\r\nof nature, and from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena, and\r\nto this end the general propositions in the first and second book are\r\ndirected. In the third book, we give an example of this in the\r\nexplication of the system of the world; for by the propositions\r\nmathematically demonstrated in the former books, we in the third derive\r\nfrom the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity with which bodies\r\ntend to the sun and the several planets. Then from these forces, by\r\nother propositions which are also mathematical, we deduce the motions of\r\nthe planets, the comets, the moon, and the sea.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject I had (he says) composed the third book in a popular\r\nmethod, that it might be read by many, but afterward, considering that\r\nsuch as had not sufficiently entered into the principles could not\r\neasily discern the strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the\r\nprejudices to which they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to\r\nprevent the disputes which might be raised upon such accounts, I chose\r\nto reduce the substance of this book into the form of Propositions (in\r\nthe mathematical way). So that this third book is composed both \"in\r\npopular method\" and in the form of mathematical propositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books I and II_\r\n\r\nThe principle of universal gravitation, namely, \"That every particle of\r\nmatter is attracted by or gravitates to every other particle of matter\r\nwith a force inversely proportional to the squares of their distances,\"\r\nis the discovery which characterises the \"Principia.\" This principle the\r\nauthor deduced from the motion of the moon and the three laws of Kepler;\r\nand these laws in turn Newton, by his greater law, demonstrated to be\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nFrom the first law of Kepler, namely, the proportionality of the areas\r\nto the times of their description, Newton inferred that the force which\r\nretained the planet in its orbit was always directed to the sun. From\r\nthe second, namely, that every planet moves in an ellipse with the sun\r\nas one of foci, he drew the more general inference that the force by\r\nwhich the planet moves round that focus varies inversely as the square\r\nof its distance therefrom. He demonstrated that a planet acted upon by\r\nsuch a force could not move in any other curve than a conic section; and\r\nhe showed when the moving body would describe a circular, an elliptical,\r\na parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit. He demonstrated, too, that this force\r\nor attracting, gravitating power resided in even the least particle; but\r\nthat in spherical masses it operates as if confined to their centres, so\r\nthat one sphere or body will act upon another sphere or body with a\r\nforce directly proportional to the quantity of matter and inversely as\r\nthe square of the distance between their centres, and that their\r\nvelocities of mutual approach will be in the inverse ratio of their\r\nquantities of matter. Thus he outlined the universal law.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The System of the World_\r\n\r\nIt was the ancient opinion of not a few (writes Newton in Book III.) in\r\nthe earliest ages of philosophy that the fixed stars stood immovable in\r\nthe highest parts of the world; that under the fixed stars the planets\r\nwere carried about the sun; that the earth, as one of the planets,\r\ndescribed an annual course about the sun, while, by a diurnal motion, it\r\nwas in the meantime revolved about its own axis; and that the sun, as\r\nthe common fire which served to warm the whole, was fixed in the centre\r\nof the universe. It was from the Egyptians that the Greeks derived their\r\nfirst, as well as their soundest notions of philosophy. It is not to be\r\ndenied that Anaxagoras, Democritus and others would have it that the\r\nearth possessed the centre of the world, but it was agreed on both sides\r\nthat the motions of the celestial bodies were performed in spaces\r\naltogether free and void of resistance. The whim of solid orbs was[1] of\r\nlater date, introduced by Endoxus, Calippus and Aristotle, when the\r\nancient philosophy began to decline.\r\n\r\nAs it was the unavoidable consequence of the hypothesis of solid orbs\r\nwhile it prevailed that the comets must be thrust down below the moon,\r\nso no sooner had the late observations of astronomers restored the\r\ncomets to their ancient places in the higher heavens than these\r\ncelestial spaces were at once cleared of the encumbrance of solid orbs,\r\nwhich by these observations were broken to pieces and discarded for\r\never.\r\n\r\nWhence it was that the planets came to be retained within any certain\r\nbounds in these free spaces, and to be drawn off from the rectilinear\r\ncourses, which, left to themselves, they should have pursued, into\r\nregular revolutions in curvilinear orbits, are questions which we do not\r\nknow how the ancients explained; and probably it was to give some sort\r\nof satisfaction to this difficulty that solid orbs were introduced.\r\n\r\nThe later philosophers pretend to account for it either by the action of\r\ncertain vortices, as Kepler and Descartes, or by some other principle of\r\nimpulse or attraction, for it is most certain that these effects must\r\nproceed from the action of some force or other. This we will call by the\r\ngeneral name of a centripetal force, as it is a force which is directed\r\nto some centre; and, as it regards more particularly a body in that\r\ncentre, we call it circum-solar, circum-terrestrial, circum-jovial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Centre-Seeking Forces_\r\n\r\nThat by means of centripetal forces the planets may be retained in\r\ncertain orbits we may easily understand if we consider the motions of\r\nprojectiles, for a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight\r\nforced out of the rectilinear path, which, by the projection alone, it\r\nshould have pursued, and made to describe a curve line in the air; and\r\nthrough that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground, and the\r\ngreater the velocity is with which it is projected the further it goes\r\nbefore it falls to earth. We can, therefore, suppose the velocity to be\r\nso increased that it would describe an arc of 1, 2, 5, 10, 100, 1,000\r\nmiles before it arrived at the earth, till, at last, exceeding the\r\nlimits of the earth, it should pass quite by it without touching it.\r\n\r\nAnd because the celestial motions are scarcely retarded by the little or\r\nno resistance of the spaces in which they are performed, to keep up the\r\nparity of cases, let us suppose either that there is no air about the\r\nearth or, at least, that it is endowed with little or no power of\r\nresisting.\r\n\r\nAnd since the areas which by this motion it describes by a radius drawn\r\nto the centre of the earth have previously been shown to be proportional\r\nto the times in which they are described, its velocity when it returns\r\nto the point from which it started will be no less than at first; and,\r\nretaining the same velocity, it will describe the same curve over and\r\nover by the same law.\r\n\r\nBut if we now imagine bodies to be projected in the directions of lines\r\nparallel to the horizon from greater heights, as from 5, 10, 100, 1,000\r\nor more miles, or, rather, as many semi-diameters of the earth, those\r\nbodies, according to their different velocity and the different force of\r\ngravity in different heights, will describe arcs either concentric with\r\nthe earth or variously eccentric, and go on revolving through the\r\nheavens in those trajectories just as the planets do in their orbs.\r\n\r\nAs when a stone is projected obliquely, the perpetual deflection thereof\r\ntowards the earth is a proof of its gravitation to the earth no less\r\ncertain than its direct descent when suffered to fall freely from rest,\r\nso the deviation of bodies moving in free spaces from rectilinear paths\r\nand perpetual deflection therefrom towards any place, is a sure\r\nindication of the existence of some force which from all quarters impels\r\nthose bodies towards that place.\r\n\r\nThat there are centripetal forces actually directed to the bodies of\r\nthe sun, of the earth, and other planets, I thus infer.\r\n\r\nThe moon revolves about our earth, and by radii drawn to its centre\r\ndescribes areas nearly proportional to the times in which they are\r\ndescribed, as is evident from its velocity compared with its apparent\r\ndiameter; for its motion is slower when its diameter is less (and\r\ntherefore its distance greater), and its motion is swifter when its\r\ndiameter is greater.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions of the satellites of Jupiter about the planet are more\r\nregular; for they describe circles concentric with Jupiter by equable\r\nmotions, as exactly as our senses can distinguish.\r\n\r\nAnd so the satellites of Saturn are revolved about this planet with\r\nmotions nearly circular and equable, scarcely disturbed by any\r\neccentricity hitherto observed.\r\n\r\nThat Venus and Mercury are revolved about the sun is demonstrable from\r\ntheir moon-like appearances. And Venus, with a motion almost uniform,\r\ndescribes an orb nearly circular and concentric with the sun. But\r\nMercury, with a more eccentric motion, makes remarkable approaches to\r\nthe sun and goes off again by turns; but it is always swifter as it is\r\nnear to the sun, and therefore by a radius drawn to the sun still\r\ndescribes areas proportional to the times.\r\n\r\nLastly, that the earth describes about the sun, or the sun about the\r\nearth, by a radius from one to the other, areas exactly proportional to\r\nthe times is demonstrable from the apparent diameter of the sun compared\r\nwith its apparent motion.\r\n\r\nThese are astronomical experiments; from which it follows that there are\r\ncentripetal forces actually directed to the centres of the earth, of\r\nJupiter, of Saturn, and of the sun.[2]\r\n\r\nThat these forces decrease in the duplicate proportion of the distances\r\nfrom the centre of every planet appears by Cor. vi., Prop. iv., Book\r\nI.[3] for the periodic times of the satellites of Jupiter are one to\r\nanother in the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances from the\r\ncentre of this planet. Cassini assures us that the same proportion is\r\nobserved in the circum-Saturnal planets. In the circum-solar planets\r\nMercury and Venus, the same proportional holds with great accuracy.\r\n\r\nThat Mars is revolved about the sun is demonstrated from the phases\r\nwhich it shows and the proportion of its apparent diameters; for from\r\nits appearing full near conjunction with the sun and gibbous in its\r\nquadratures,[4] it is certain that it travels round the sun. And since\r\nits diameter appears about five times greater when in opposition to the\r\nsun than when in conjunction therewith, and its distance from the earth\r\nis reciprocally as its apparent diameter, that distance will be about\r\nfive times less when in opposition to than when in conjunction with the\r\nsun; but in both cases its distance from the sun will be nearly about\r\nthe same with the distance which is inferred from its gibbous appearance\r\nin the quadratures. And as it encompasses the sun at almost equal\r\ndistances, but in respect of the earth is very unequally distant, so by\r\nradii drawn to the sun it describes areas nearly uniform; but by radii\r\ndrawn to the earth it is sometimes swift, sometimes stationary, and\r\nsometimes retrograde.\r\n\r\nThat Jupiter in a higher orbit than Mars is likewise revolved about the\r\nsun with a motion nearly equable as well in distance as in the areas\r\ndescribed, I infer from Mr. Flamsted's observations of the eclipses of\r\nthe innermost satellite; and the same thing may be concluded of Saturn\r\nfrom his satellite by the observations of Mr. Huyghens and Mr. Halley.\r\n\r\nIf Jupiter was viewed from the sun it would never appear retrograde or\r\nstationary, as it is seen sometimes from the earth, but always to go\r\nforward with a motion nearly uniform. And from the very great inequality\r\nof its apparent geocentric motion we infer--as it has been previously\r\nshown that we may infer--that the force by which Jupiter is turned out\r\nof a rectilinear course and made to revolve in an orbit is not directed\r\nto the centre of the earth. And the same argument holds good in Mars and\r\nin Saturn. Another centre of these forces is, therefore, to be looked\r\nfor, about which the areas described by radii intervening may be\r\nequable; and that this is the sun, we have proved already in Mars and\r\nSaturn nearly, but accurately enough in Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe distances of the planets from the sun come out the same whether,\r\nwith Tycho, we place the earth in the centre of the system, or the sun\r\nwith Copernicus; and we have already proved that, these distances are\r\ntrue in Jupiter. Kepler and Bullialdus have with great care determined\r\nthe distances of the planets from the sun, and hence it is that their\r\ntables agree best with the heavens. And in all the planets, in Jupiter\r\nand Mars, in Saturn and the earth, as well as in Venus and Mercury, the\r\ncubes of their distances are as the squares of their periodic times;\r\nand, therefore, the centripetal circum-solar force throughout all the\r\nplanetary regions decreases in the duplicate proportion of the distances\r\nfrom the sun. Neglecting those little fractions which may have arisen\r\nfrom insensible errors of observation, we shall always find the said\r\nproportion to hold exactly; for the distances of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,\r\nthe Earth, Venus, and Mercury from the sun, drawn from the observations\r\nof astronomers, are (Kepler) as the numbers 951,000, 519,650, 152,350,\r\n100,000, 70,000, 38,806; or (Bullialdus) as the numbers 954,198,\r\n522,520, 152,350, 100,000, 72,398, 38,585; and from the periodic times\r\nthey come out 953,806, 520,116, 152,399, 100,000, 72,333, 38,710. Their\r\ndistances, according to Kepler and Bullialdus, scarcely differ by any\r\nsensible quantity, and where they differ most the differences drawn from\r\nthe periodic times fall in between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earth as a Centre_\r\n\r\nThat the circum-terrestrial force likewise decreases in the duplicate\r\nproportion of the distances, I infer thus:\r\n\r\nThe mean distance of the moon from the centre of the earth is, we may\r\nassume, sixty semi-diameters of the earth; and its periodic time in\r\nrespect of the fixed stars 27 days 7 hr. 43 min. Now, it has been shown\r\nin a previous book that a body revolved in our air, near the surface of\r\nthe earth supposed at rest, by means of a centripetal force which should\r\nbe to the same force at the distance of the moon in the reciprocal\r\nduplicate proportion of the distances from the centre of the earth, that\r\nis, as 3,600 to 1, would (secluding the resistance of the air) complete\r\na revolution in 1 hr. 24 min. 27 sec.\r\n\r\nSuppose the circumference of the earth to be 123,249,600 Paris feet,\r\nthen the same body deprived of its circular motion and falling by the\r\nimpulse of the same centripetal force as before would in one second of\r\ntime describe 15-1/12 Paris feet. This we infer by a calculus formed\r\nupon Prop. xxxvi. (\"To determine the times of the descent of a body\r\nfalling from a given place\"), and it agrees with the results of Mr.\r\nHuyghens's experiments of pendulums, by which he demonstrated that\r\nbodies falling by all the centripetal force with which (of whatever\r\nnature it is) they are impelled near the surface of the earth do in one\r\nsecond of time describe 15-1/12 Paris feet.\r\n\r\nBut if the earth is supposed to move, the earth and moon together will\r\nbe revolved about their common centre of gravity. And the moon (by Prop,\r\nlx.) will in the same periodic time, 27 days 7 hr. 43 min., with the\r\nsame circum-terrestrial force diminished in the duplicate proportion of\r\nthe distance, describe an orbit whose semi-diameter is to the\r\nsemi-diameter of the former orbit, that is, to the sixty semi-diameters\r\nof the earth, as the sum of both the bodies of the earth and moon to the\r\nfirst of two mean proportionals between this sum and the body of the\r\nearth; that is, if we suppose the moon (on account of its mean apparent\r\ndiameter 31-1/2 min.) to be about 1/42 of the earth, as 43 to (42 +\r\n42^2)^1/3 or as about 128 to 127. And, therefore, the semi-diameter of\r\nthe orbit--that is, the distance of the centres of the moon and\r\nearth--will in this case be 60-1/2 semi-diameters of the earth, almost\r\nthe same with that assigned by Copernicus; and, therefore, the duplicate\r\nproportion of the decrement of the force holds good in this distance.\r\n(The action of the sun is here disregarded as inconsiderable.)\r\n\r\nThis proportion of the decrement of the forces is confirmed from the\r\neccentricity of the planets, and the very slow motion of their apsides;\r\nfor in no other proportion, it has been established, could the\r\ncircum-solar planets once in every revolution descend to their least,\r\nand once ascend to their greatest distance from the sun, and the places\r\nof those distances remain immovable. A small error from the duplicate\r\nproportion would produce a motion of the apsides considerable in every\r\nrevolution, but in many enormous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tides_\r\n\r\nWhile the planets are thus revolved in orbits about remote centres, in\r\nthe meantime they make their several rotations about their proper axes:\r\nthe sun in 26 days, Jupiter in 9 hr. 56 min., Mars in 24-2/3 hr., Venus\r\nin 23 hr., and in like manner is the moon revolved about its axis in 27\r\ndays 7 hr. 43 min.; so that this diurnal motion is equal to the mean\r\nmotion of the moon in its orbit; upon which account the same face of the\r\nmoon always respects the centre about which this mean motion is\r\nperformed--that is, the exterior focus of the moon's orbit nearly.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the diurnal revolutions of the planets the matter which\r\nthey contain endeavours to recede from the axis of this motion; and\r\nhence the fluid parts, rising higher towards the equator than about the\r\npoles, would lay the solid parts about the equator under water if those\r\nparts did not rise also; upon which account the planets are something\r\nthicker about the equator than about the poles.\r\n\r\nAnd from the diurnal motion and the attractions of the sun and moon our\r\nsea ought twice to rise and twice to fall every day, as well lunar as\r\nsolar. But the two motions which the two luminaries raise will not\r\nappear distinguished but will make a certain mixed motion. In the\r\nconjunction or opposition of the luminaries their forces will be\r\nconjoined and bring on the greatest flood and ebb. In the quadratures\r\nthe sun will raise the waters which the moon depresseth and depress the\r\nwaters which the moon raiseth; and from the difference of their forces\r\nthe smallest of all tides will follow.\r\n\r\nBut the effects of the lumniaries depend upon their distances from the\r\nearth, for when they are less distant their effects are greater and when\r\nmore distant their effects are less, and that in the triplicate\r\nproportion of their apparent diameters. Therefore it is that the sun in\r\nwinter time, being then in its perigee, has a greater effect, whether\r\nadded to or subtracted from that of the moon, than in the summer season,\r\nand every month the moon, while in the perigee raiseth higher tides than\r\nat the distance of fifteen days before or after when it is in its\r\napogee.\r\n\r\nThe fixed stars being at such vast distances from one another, can\r\nneither attract each other sensibly nor be attracted by our sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comets_\r\n\r\nThere are three hypotheses about comets. For some will have it that they\r\nare generated and perish as often as they appear and vanish; others that\r\nthey come from the regions of the fixed stars, and are near by us in\r\ntheir passage through the sytem of our planets; and, lastly, others that\r\nthey are bodies perpetually revolving about the sun in very eccentric\r\norbits.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, the comets, according to their different velocities,\r\nwill move in conic sections of all sorts; in the second they will\r\ndescribe hyperbolas; and in either of the two will frequent\r\nindifferently all quarters of the heavens, as well those about the poles\r\nas those towards the ecliptic; in the third their motions will be\r\nperformed in eclipses very eccentric and very nearly approaching to\r\nparabolas. But (if the law of the planets is observed) their orbits will\r\nnot much decline from the plane of the ecliptic; and, so far as I could\r\nhitherto observe, the third case obtains; for the comets do indeed\r\nchiefly frequent the zodiac, and scarcely ever attain to a heliocentric\r\nlatitude of 40 degrees. And that they move in orbits very nearly\r\nparabolical, I infer from their velocity; for the velocity with which a\r\nparabola is described is everywhere to the velocity with which a comet\r\nor planet may be revolved about the sun in a circle at the same\r\ndistance in the subduplicate ratio of 2 to 1; and, by my computation,\r\nthe velocity of comets is found to be much about the same. I examined\r\nthe thing by inferring nearly the velocities from the distances, and the\r\ndistances both from the parallaxes and the phenomena of the tails, and\r\nnever found the errors of excess or defect in the velocities greater\r\nthan what might have arisen from the errors in the distances collected\r\nafter that manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR RICHARD OWEN\r\n\r\nAnatomy of Vertebrates\r\n\r\n     Sir Richard Owen, the great naturalist, was born July 20, 1804, at\r\n     Lancaster, England, and received his early education at the grammar\r\n     school of that town. Thence he went to Edinburgh University. In\r\n     1826 he was admitted a member of the English College of Surgeons,\r\n     and in 1829 was lecturing at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London,\r\n     where he had completed his studies. His \"Memoir on the Pearly\r\n     Nautillus,\" published in 1832, placed him, says Huxley, \"at a bound\r\n     in the front rank of anatomical monographers,\" and for sixty-two\r\n     years the flow of his contributions to scientific literature never\r\n     ceased. In 1856 he was appointed to take charge of the natural\r\n     history departments of the British Museum, and before long set\r\n     forth views as to the inadequacy of the existing accommodation,\r\n     which led ultimately to the foundation of the buildings now devoted\r\n     to this purpose in South Kensington. Owen died on December 18,\r\n     1892. His great book, \"Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the\r\n     Vertebrates,\" was completed in 1868, and since Cuvier's\r\n     \"Comparative Anatomy,\" is the most monumental treatise on the\r\n     subject by any one man. Although much of the classification adopted\r\n     by Owen has not been accepted by other zoologists, yet the work\r\n     contains an immense amount of information, most of which was gained\r\n     from Owen's own personal observations and dissections.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Biological Questions of 1830_\r\n\r\nAt the close of my studies at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, in 1831, I\r\nreturned strongly moved to lines of research bearing upon the then\r\nprevailing phases of thought on some biological questions.\r\n\r\nThe great master in whose dissecting rooms I was privileged to work held\r\nthat species were not permanent as a fact established inductively on a\r\nwide basis of observation, by which comparative osteology had been\r\ncreated. Camper and Hunter suspected the species might be transitory;\r\nbut Cuvier, in defining the characters of his anaplotherium and\r\npalæotherium, etc., proved the fact. Of the relation of past to present\r\nspecies, Cuvier had not an adequate basis for a decided opinion.\r\nObservation of changes in the relative position of land and sea\r\nsuggested to him one condition of the advent of new species on an island\r\nor continent where old species had died out. This view he illustrates by\r\na hypothetical case of such succession, but expressly states: \"I do not\r\nassert that a new creation was necessary to produce the species now\r\nexisting, but only that they did not exist in the same regions, and must\r\nhave come from elsewhere.\" Geoffrey Saint Hilaire opposed to Cuvier's\r\ninductive treatment of the question the following expression of belief:\r\n\"I have no doubt that existing animals are directly descended from the\r\nanimals of the antediluvian world,\" but added, \"it is my belief that the\r\nseason has not yet arrived for a really satisfying knowledge of\r\ngeology.\"\r\n\r\nThe main collateral questions argued in their debates appeared to me to\r\nbe the following:\r\n\r\nUnity of plan or final purpose, as a governing condition of organic\r\ndevelopment?\r\n\r\nSeries of species, uninterrupted or broken by intervals?\r\n\r\nExtinction, cataclysmal or regulated?\r\n\r\nDevelopment, by epigenesis or evolution?\r\n\r\nPrimary life, by miracle or secondary law?\r\n\r\nCuvier held the work of organisation to be guided and governed by final\r\npurpose or adaptation. Geoffrey denied the evidence of design and\r\ncontended for the principle which he called \"unity of composition,\" as\r\nthe law of organisation. Most of his illustrations were open to the\r\ndemonstration of inaccuracy; and the language by which disciples of the\r\nkindred school of Schelling illustrated in the animal structure the\r\ntranscendental idea of the whole in every part seemed little better than\r\nmystical jargon. With Cuvier, answerable parts occurred in the\r\nzoological scale because they had to perform similar functions.\r\n\r\nAs, however, my observations and comparisons accumulated, they enforced\r\na reconsideration of Cuvier's conclusions. To demonstrate the evidence\r\nof the community of organisation I found the artifice of an archetype\r\nvertebrate animal essential; and from the demonstration of its\r\nprinciple, which I then satisfied myself was associated with and\r\ndominated by that of \"adaptation to purpose,\" the step was inevitable to\r\nthe conception of the operation of a secondary cause of the entire\r\nseries of species, such cause being the servant of predetermining\r\nintelligent will.\r\n\r\nBut besides \"derivation\" or \"filiation\" another principle influencing\r\norganisation became recognisable, to which I gave the name of\r\n\"irrelative repetition,\" or \"vegetative repetition.\" The demonstrated\r\nconstitution of the vertebrate endoskeleton as a series of essentially\r\nsimilar segments appeared to me to illustrate the law of irrelative\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\nThese results of inductive research swayed me in rejecting direct or\r\nmiraculous creation, and in recognising a \"natural law or secondary\r\ncause\" as operative in the production of species \"in orderly succession\r\nand progression.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Succession of Species, Broken or Linked?_\r\n\r\nTo the hypothesis that existing are modifications of extinct species,\r\nCuvier replied that traces of modification were due from the fossil\r\nworld. \"You ought,\" he said, \"to be able to show the intermediate forms\r\nbetween the palæotherium and existing hoofed quadrupeds.\"\r\n\r\nThe progress of palæontology since 1830 has brought to light many\r\nmissing links unknown to the founder of the science. The discovery of\r\nthe remains of the hipparion supplied one of the links required by\r\nCuvier, and it is significant that the remains of such three-toed horses\r\nare found only in deposits of that tertiary period which intervene\r\nbetween the older palæotherian one and the newer strata in which the\r\nmodern horse first appears to have lost its lateral hooflets.\r\n\r\nThe molar series of the horse includes six large complex grinders\r\nindividually recognisable by developmental characters. The\r\nrepresentative of the first premolar is minute and soon shod. Its\r\nhomologue in palæotherium is functionally developed and retained, that\r\ntype-dentition being adhered to. In hipparion this tooth is smaller than\r\nin palæotherium, but functional and permanent. The transitory and\r\nsingularly small and simple denticle in the horse exemplifies the\r\nrudiment of an ancestral structure in the same degree as do the hoofless\r\nsplint-bones; just as the spurious hoofs dangling therefrom in hipparion\r\nare retained rudiments of the functionally developed lateral hoofs in\r\nthe broader foot of palæotherium.\r\n\r\nOther missing links of this series of species have also been supplied.\r\n\r\nHow then is the origin of these intermediate gradations to be\r\ninterpreted? If the alternative--species by miracle or by law--be\r\napplied to palæotherium, paloplotherium, anchitherium, hipparion, equus,\r\nI accept the latter without misgiving, and recognise such law as\r\ncontinuously operative throughout tertiary time.\r\n\r\nIn respect to its law of operation we may suppose Lamarck to say, \"as\r\nthe surface of the earth consolidated, the larger and more produced\r\nmid-hoof of the old three-toed pachyderius took a greater share in\r\nsustaining the animal's weight; and more blood being required to meet\r\nthe greater demand of the more active mid-toe, it grew; whilst, the\r\nside-toes, losing their share of nourishment and becoming more and more\r\nwithdrawn from use, shrank\"--and so on. Mr. Darwin, I conceive, would\r\nmodify this by saying that some individuals of palæotherium happening to\r\nbe born with a larger and longer middle toe, and with shorter and\r\nsmaller side-toes, such variety was better adapted to prevailing altered\r\nconditions of the earth's surface than the parental form; and so on,\r\nuntil finally the extreme equine modifications of foot came to be\r\n\"naturally selected.\" But the hypothesis of appetency and volition, as\r\nof natural selection, are less applicable, less intelligible, in\r\nconnection with the changes in the teeth.\r\n\r\nI must further observe that to say the palæotherium has graduated into\r\nequus by \"natural selection\" is an explanation of the process of the\r\nsame kind and value as that by which the secretion of bile was\r\nattributed to the \"appetency\" of the liver for the elements of bile.\r\nOne's surprise is that such explanatory devices should not have died out\r\nwith the \"archeus faber,\" the \"nisus formations,\" and other\r\nself-deceiving, world-beguiling simulacra of science, with the last\r\ncentury; and that a resuscitation should have had any success in the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the facts on which any reasonable or intelligible\r\nconception can be formed of the mode of operation of the derivative law\r\nexemplified in the series linking on palæotherium to equus? A very\r\nsignificant one is the following. A modern horse occasionally comes into\r\nthe world with the supplementary ancestral hoofs. From Valerius Maximus,\r\nwho attributes the variety to Bucephalus downwards, such \"polydactyle\"\r\nhorses have been noted as monsters and marvels. In one of the latest\r\nexamples, the inner splint-bone, answering to the second metacarpal of\r\nthe pentadactyle foot, supported phalanges and a terminal hoof\r\nresembling the corresponding one in hipparion. And the pairing of horses\r\nwith the meterpodials bearing, according to type, phalanges and hoofs\r\nmight restore the race of hipparions.\r\n\r\nNow, the fact suggesting such possibility teaches that the change would\r\nbe sudden and considerable; it opposes the idea that species are\r\ntransmuted by minute and slow degrees. It also shows that a species\r\nmight originate independently of the operation of any external\r\ninfluence; that change of structure would precede that of use and\r\nhabit; that appetency, impulse, ambient medium, fortuitous fitness of\r\nsurrounding circumstances, or a personified \"selecting nature\" would\r\nhave had no share in the transmutative act.\r\n\r\nThus I have been led to recognise species as exemplifying the continuous\r\noperation of natural law, or secondary cause; and that not only\r\nsuccessively but progressively; \"from the first embodiment of the\r\nvertebrate idea under its old ichthyic vestment until it became arrayed\r\nin the glorious garb of the human form.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_III.--Extinction--Cataclysmal or Regulated_\r\n\r\nIf the species of palæothere, paloplothere, anchithere, hipparion, and\r\nhorse be severally deemed due to remotely and successively repeated acts\r\nof creation; the successive going out of such species must have been as\r\nmiraculous as their coming in. Accordingly, in Cuvier's \"Discourse on\r\nRevolutions of the Earth's Surface\" we have a section of \"Proofs that\r\nthese revolutions have been numerous,\" and another of \"Proofs that these\r\nrevolutions have been sudden.\" But as the discoveries of palæontologists\r\nhave supplied the links between the species held to have perished by the\r\ncataclysms, so each successive parcel of geological truth has tended to\r\ndissipate the belief in the unusually sudden and violent nature of the\r\nchanges recognisable in the earth's surface. In specially directing my\r\nattention to this moot point, whilst engaged in investigations of fossil\r\nremains, I was led to recognise one cause of extinction as being due to\r\ndefeat in the contest which the individual of each species had to\r\nmaintain against the surrounding agencies which might militate against\r\nits existence. This principle has received a large and most instructive\r\naccession of illustrations from the labours of Charles Darwin; but he\r\naims to apply it not only to the extinction but to the origin of\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nAlthough I fail to recognise proof of the latter bearing of the battle\r\nof life, the concurrence of so much evidence in favour of extinction by\r\nlaw is, in like measure, corroborative of the truth of the ascription of\r\nthe origin of species to a secondary cause.\r\n\r\nWhat spectacle can be more beautiful than that of the inhabitants of the\r\ncalm expanse of water of an atoll encircled by its ring of coral rock!\r\nLeaving locomotive frequenters of the calcarious basin out of the\r\nquestion, we may ask, Was direct creation after the dying out of its\r\nresult as a \"rugose coral\" repeated to constitute the succeeding and\r\nsuperseding \"tabulate coral\"? Must we also invoke the miraculous power\r\nto initiate every distinct species of both rugosa and tabulata? These\r\ngrand old groups have had their day and are utterly gone. When we\r\nendeavour to conceive or realise such mode of origin, not of them only\r\nbut of their manifold successors, the miracle, by the very\r\nmultiplication of its manifestations, becomes incredible--inconsistent\r\nwith any worthy conception of an all-seeing, all-provident Omnipotence.\r\n\r\nBeing unable to accept the volitional hypothesis (of Lamarck) or the\r\nselective force exerted by outward circumstances (Darwin), I deem an\r\ninnate tendency to deviate from parental type, operating through periods\r\nof adequate duration, to be the most probable way of operation of the\r\nsecondary law whereby species have been derived one from another.\r\n\r\nAccording to my derivative hypothesis a change takes place first in the\r\nstructure of the animal, and this, when sufficiently advanced, may lead\r\nto modifications of habits. But species owe as little to the accidental\r\nconcurrence of environing circumstances as kosmos depends upon a\r\nfortuitous concourse of atoms. A purposive route of development and\r\nchange of correlation and inter-dependence, manifesting intelligent\r\nwill, is as determinable in the succession of races as in the\r\ndevelopment and organisation of the individual.\r\n\r\nDerivation holds that every species changes in time, by virtue of\r\ninherent tendencies thereto. Natural selection holds that no such change\r\ncan take place without the influence of altered external circumstances\r\neducing or eliciting such change.\r\n\r\nDerivation sees among the effects of the innate tendency to change,\r\nirrespective of altered surrounding circumstances, a manifestation of\r\ncreative power in the variety and beauty of the results; and, in the\r\nultimate forthcoming of a being susceptible of appreciating such beauty,\r\nevidence of the preordaining of such relation of power to the\r\nappreciation. Natural selection acknowledges that if power or beauty, in\r\nitself, should be a purpose in creation, it would be absolutely fatal to\r\nit as a hypothesis.\r\n\r\nNatural selection sees grandeur in the \"view of life, with its several\r\npowers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms\r\nor into one.\" Derivation sees, therein, a narrow invocation of a special\r\nmiracle and an unworthy limitation of creative power, the grandeur of\r\nwhich is manifested daily, hourly, in calling into life many forms, by\r\nconversion of physical and chemical into vital modes of force, under as\r\nmany diversified conditions of the requisite elements to be so combined.\r\n\r\nNatural selection leaves the subsequent origin and succession of species\r\nto the fortuitous concurrence of outward conditions; derivation\r\nrecognises a purpose in the defined and preordained course, due to\r\ninnate capacity or power of change, by which homogeneously-created\r\nprotozoa have risen to the higher forms of plants and animals.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of derivation rests upon conclusions from four great\r\nseries of inductively established facts, together with a probable result\r\nof facts of a fifth class; the hypothesis of natural selection totters\r\non the extension of a conjectural condition explanatory of extinction to\r\nthe origination of species, inapplicable in that extension to the\r\nmajority of organisms, and not known or observed to apply to the origin\r\nof any species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV.--Epigenesis or Evolution?_\r\n\r\nThe derivative origin of species, then, being at present the most\r\nadmissible one, and the retrospective survey of such species showing\r\nconvergence, as time recedes, to more simplified or generalised\r\norganisations, the result to which the suggested train of thought\r\ninevitably leads is very analogous in each instance. If to kosmos or the\r\nmundane system have been allotted powers equivalent to the development\r\nof the several grades of life, may not the demonstrated series of\r\nconversions of force have also included that into the vital form?\r\n\r\nIn the last century, physiologists were divided as to the principle\r\nguiding the work of organic development.\r\n\r\nThe \"evolutionists\" contended that the new being preexisted in a\r\ncomplete state of formation, needing only to be vivified by impregnation\r\nin order to commence the series of expansions or disencasings,\r\nculminating in the independent individual.\r\n\r\nThe \"epigenesists\" held that both the germ and its subsequent organs\r\nwere built up of juxtaposed molecules according to the operation of a\r\ndevelopmental force, or \"nisus formations.\"\r\n\r\nAt the present day the question may seem hardly worth the paper on which\r\nit is referred to. Nevertheless, \"pre-existence of germs\" and evolution\r\nare logically inseparable from the idea of species by primary\r\nmiraculously-created individuals. Cuvier, therefore, maintained both as\r\nfirmly as did Haller. In the debates of 1830 I remained the thrall of\r\nthat dogma in regard to the origin of single-celled organisms whether in\r\nor out of body. Every result of formfaction, I believed, with most\r\nphysiologists, to be the genetic outcome of a pre-existing \"cell.\" The\r\nfirst was due to miraculous interposition and suspension of ordinary\r\nlaws; it contained potentially all future possible cells.\r\nCell-development exemplified evolution of pre-existing germs, the\r\nprogeny of the primary cell. They progagated themselves by\r\nself-division, or by \"proliferation\" of minutes granules or atoms,\r\nwhich, when properly nourished, again multiplied by self-division, and\r\ngrew to the likeness of the parent cells.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me more consistent with the present phase of dynamical\r\nscience and the observed graduations of living things to suppose the\r\nsarcode or the \"protogenal\" jelly-speck should be formable through the\r\nconcurrence of conditions favouring such combination of their elements,\r\nand involving a change of force productive of their contractions and\r\nextensions, molecular attractions, and repulsions--and the sarcode has\r\nso become, from the period when its irrelative repetitions resulted in\r\nthe vast indefinite masses of the \"eozoon,\" exemplifying the earliest\r\nprocess of \"formification\" or organic crystallisation--than that all\r\nexisting sarcodes or \"protogenes\" are the result of genetic descent from\r\na germ or cell due to a primary act of miraculous interposition.\r\n\r\nI prefer, while indulging in such speculations, to consider the various\r\ndaily nomogeneously developed forms of protozoal or protistal jellies,\r\nsarcodes, and single-celled organisms, to have been as many roots from\r\nwhich the higher grades have ramified than that the origin of the whole\r\norganic creation is to be referred, as the Egyptian priests did that of\r\nthe universe, to a single egg.\r\n\r\nAmber or steel, when magnetised, seem to exercise \"selection\"; they do\r\nnot attract all substances alike. A speck of protogenal jelly or\r\nsarcode, if alive, shows analogous relations to certain substances; but\r\nthe soft yielding tissue allows the part next the attractive matter to\r\nmove thereto, and then, by retraction, to draw such matter into the\r\nsarcodal mass, which overspreads, dissolves, and assimilates it. The\r\nterm \"living\" in the one case is correlative with the term \"magnetic\" in\r\nthe other. A man perceives ripe fruit; he stretches out his hand,\r\nplucks, masticates, swallows, and digests it.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises whether the difference between such series of\r\nactions in the man and the attractive and assimilative movement of the\r\namæba be greater or less than the difference between these acts of the\r\namæba and the attracting and retaining acts of the magnet.\r\n\r\nThe question, I think, may be put with some confidence as to the quality\r\nof the ultimate reply whether the amæbal phenomena are so much more\r\ndifferent, or so essentially different, from the magnetic phenomena than\r\nthey are from the mammalian phenomena, as to necessitate the invocation\r\nof a special miracle for their manifestation. It is analogically\r\nconceivable that the same cause which has endowed His world with power\r\nconvertible into magnetic, electric, thermotic and other forms or modes\r\nof force, has also added the conditions of conversion into the vital\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nFrom protozoa or protista to plants and animals the graduation is closer\r\nthan from magnetised iron to vitalised sarcode. From reflex acts of the\r\nnervous system animals rise to sentient and volitional ones. And with\r\nthe ascent are associated brain-cells progressively increasing in size\r\nand complexity. Thought relates to the \"brain\" of man as does\r\nelectricity to the nervous \"battery\" of the torpedo; both are forms of\r\nforce and the results of action of their respective organs.\r\n\r\nEach sensation affects a cerebral fibre, and, in so affecting it, gives\r\nit the faculty of repeating the action, wherein memory consists and\r\nsensation in a dream.\r\n\r\nIf the hypothesis of an abstract entity produces psychological phenomena\r\nby playing upon the brain as a musician upon his instrument be rejected,\r\nand these phenomena be held to be the result of cerebral actions, an\r\nobjection is made that the latter view is \"materialistic\" and adverse to\r\nthe notion of an independent, indivisible, \"immaterial,\" mental\r\nprinciple or soul.\r\n\r\nBut in the endeavour to comprehend clearly and explain the functions of\r\nthe combination of forces called \"brain,\" the physiologist is hindered\r\nand troubled by the views of the nature of those cerebral forces which\r\nthe needs of dogmatic theology have imposed on mankind. How long\r\nphysiologists would have entertained the notion of a \"life,\" or \"vital\r\nprinciple,\" as a distinct entity if freed from this baneful influence\r\nmay be questioned; but it can be truly affirmed that physiology has now\r\nestablished and does accept the truth of that statement of Locke--\"the\r\nlife, whether of a material or immaterial substance, is not the\r\nsubstance itself, but an affection of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUDOLF VIRCHOW\r\n\r\nCellular Pathology\r\n\r\n     Rudolf Virchow, the son of a small farmer and shopkeeper, was born\r\n     at Schivelbein, in Pomerania, on October 13, 1821. He graduated in\r\n     medicine at Berlin, and was appointed lecturer at the University,\r\n     but his political enthusiasm brought him into disfavour. In 1849 he\r\n     was removed to Wurzburg, where he was made professor of pathology,\r\n     but in 1856 he returned to Berlin as Professor and Director of the\r\n     Pathological Institute, and there acquired world-wide fame. His\r\n     celebrated work, \"Cellular Pathology as based on Histology,\"\r\n     published in 1856, marks a distinct epoch in the science. Virchow\r\n     established what Lord Lister describes as \"the true and fertile\r\n     doctrine that every morbid structure consists of cells which have\r\n     been derived from pre-existing cells as a progeny.\" Virchow was not\r\n     only distinguished as a pathologist, he also gained considerable\r\n     fame as an archæologist and anthropologist. During the wars of 1866\r\n     and 1870-71, he equipped and drilled hospital corps and ambulance\r\n     squads, and superintended hospital trains and the Berlin military\r\n     hospital. War over, he directed his attention to sanitation and the\r\n     sewage problems of Berlin. Virchow was a voluminous author on a\r\n     variety of subjects, perhaps his most well-known works being\r\n     \"Famine Fever\" and \"Freedom of Science.\" He died on September 5,\r\n     1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cell and the Tissues_\r\n\r\nThe chief point in the application of Histology to Pathology is to\r\nobtain recognition of the fact that the cell is really the ultimate\r\nmorphological element in which there is any manifestation of life.\r\n\r\nIn certain respects animal cells differ from vegetable cells; but in\r\nessentials they are the same; both consist of matter of a nitrogenous\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine a simple cell, we find we can distinguish morphological\r\nparts. In the first place, we find in the cell a round or oval body\r\nknown as the nucleus. Occasionally the nucleus is stallate or angular;\r\nbut as a rule, so long as cells have vital power, the nucleus maintains\r\na nearly constant round or oval shape. The nucleus in its turn, in\r\ncompletely developed cells, very constantly encloses another structure\r\nwithin itself--the so-called nucleolus. With regard to the question of\r\nvital form, it cannot be said of the nucleolus that it appears to be an\r\nabsolute essential, and in a considerable number of young cells it has\r\nas yet escaped detection. On the other hand, we regularly meet with it\r\nin fully-developed, older forms, and it therefore seems to mark a higher\r\ndegree of development in the cell.\r\n\r\nAccording to the view which was put forward in the first instance by\r\nSchleiden, and accepted by Schwann, the connection between the three\r\nco-existent cell-constituents was long thought to be of this nature:\r\nthat the nucleolus was the first to show itself in the development of\r\ntissues, by separating out of a formative fluid (blastema,\r\ncyto-blastema), that it quickly attained a certain size, that then fine\r\ngranules were precipitated out of the blastema and settled around it,\r\nand that about these there condensed a membrane. In this way a nucleus\r\nwas formed about which new matter gradually gathered, and in due time\r\nproduced a little membrane. This theory of the formation of the cell is\r\ndesignated the theory of free cell formation--a theory which has been\r\nnow almost entirely abandoned.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that the nucleus plays an extremely important part\r\nwithin the cell--a part less connected with the function and specific\r\noffice of the cell, than with its maintenance and multiplication as a\r\nliving part. The specific (animal) function is most distinctly\r\nmanifested in muscles, nerves, and gland cells, the peculiar actions of\r\nwhich--contraction, sensation, and secretion--appear to be connected in\r\nno direct manner with the nuclei. But the permanency of the cell as an\r\nelement seems to depend on nucleus, for all cells which lose their\r\nnuclei quickly die, and break up, and disappear.\r\n\r\nEvery organism, whether vegetable or animal, must be regarded as a\r\nprogressive total, made up of a larger or smaller number of similar or\r\ndissimilar cells. Just as a tree constitutes a mass arranged in a\r\ndefinite manner in which, in every single part, in the leaves as in the\r\nroot, in the trunk as in the blossom, cells are discovered to be the\r\nultimate elements, so it is with the forms of animal life. Every animal\r\npresents itself as a sum of vital unities, every one of which manifests\r\nall the characteristics of life. The characteristics and unity of life\r\ncannot be limited to any one particular spot in an organism (for\r\ninstance, to the brain of a man) but are to be found only in the\r\ndefinite, constantly recurring structure, which every individual element\r\ndisplays. A so-called individual always represents an arrangement of a\r\nsocial kind, in which a number of individual existences are mutually\r\ndependent, but in such a way that every element has its own special\r\naction, and even though it derive its stimulus to activity from other\r\nparts, yet alone affects the actual performance of its duties.\r\n\r\nBetween cells there is a greater or less amount of a homogeneous\r\nsubstance--the _intercellular substance_. According to Schwann, the\r\nintercellular substance was cyto-blastema destined for the development\r\nof new cells; I believe this is not so, I believe that the intercellular\r\nsubstance is dependent in a certain definite manner upon the cells, and\r\nthat certain parts of it belong to one cell and parts to another.\r\n\r\nAt various times, fibres, globules, and elementary granules, have been\r\nregarded as histological starting-points. Now, however, we have\r\nestablished the general principle that no development of any kind begins\r\n_de novo_ and that as spontaneous generation is impossible in the case\r\nof entire organisms, so also it is impossible in the case of individual\r\nparts. No cell can build itself up out of non-cellular material. Where a\r\ncell arises, there a cell must have previously existed (omnis cellula e\r\ncellula), just as an animal can spring only from an animal, and a plant\r\nonly from a plant. No developed tissues can be traced back to anything\r\nbut a cell.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to classify tissues, a very simple division offers itself. We\r\nhave (a) tissues which consist exclusively of cells, where cell lies\r\nclose to cell. (b) Tissues in which the cells are separated by a certain\r\namount of intercellular substance. (c) Tissues of a high or peculiar\r\ntype, such as the nervous and muscular systems and vessels. An example\r\nof the first class is seen in the _epithelial_ tissues. In these, cell\r\nlies close to cell, with nothing between.\r\n\r\nThe second class is exemplified in the _connective_ tissues--tissues\r\ncomposed of intercellular substance in which at certain intervals cells\r\nlie embedded.\r\n\r\nMuscles, nerves, and vessels form a somewhat heterogeneous group. The\r\nidea suggests itself that we have in all three structures to deal with\r\nreal tubes filled with more or less movable contents. This view is,\r\nhowever, inadequate, since we cannot regard the blood as analogous to\r\nthe medullary substance of the nerve, or contractile substance of a\r\nmuscular fasciculus.\r\n\r\nThe elements of muscle have generally been regarded as the most simple.\r\nIf we examine an ordinary red muscle, we find it to be composed of a\r\nnumber of cylindrical fibres, marked with transverse and longitudinal\r\nstriæ. If, now, we add acetic acid, we discover also tolerably large\r\nnuclei with nucleoli. Thus we obtain an appearance like an elongated\r\ncell, and there is a tendency to regard the primitive fasciculus as\r\nhaving sprung from a single cell. To this view I am much inclined.\r\n\r\nPathological tissues arise from normal tissues; and there is no form of\r\nmorbid growth which cannot in its elements be traced back to some model\r\nwhich had previously maintained an independent existence in the economy.\r\nA classification, also, of pathological growths may be made on exactly\r\nthe same plan as that which we have suggested in the case of the normal\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nutrition, Blood, and Lymph. Pus_\r\n\r\nNutritive material is carried to the tissues by the blood; but the\r\nmaterial is accepted by the tissues only in accordance with their\r\nrequirements for the moment, and is conveyed to the individual districts\r\nin suitable quantities. The muscular elements of the arteries have the\r\nmost important influence upon the quantity of the blood distributed, and\r\ntheir elastic elements ensure an equable stream; but it is chiefly the\r\nsimple homogeneous membrane of the capillaries that influences the\r\npermeation of the fluids. Not all the peculiarities, however, in the\r\ninterchange of nutritive material are to be attributed to the capillary\r\nwall, for no doubt there are chemical affinities which enable certain\r\nparts specially to attract certain substances from the blood. We know,\r\nfor example, that a number of substances are introduced into the body\r\nwhich have special affinities for the nerve tissues, and that certain\r\nmaterials are excreted by certain organs. We are therefore compelled to\r\nconsider the individual elements as active agents of the attraction. If\r\nthe living element be altered by disease, then it loses its power of\r\nspecific attraction.\r\n\r\nI do not regard the blood as the cause of chronic dyscrasiæ; for I do\r\nnot regard the blood as a permanent tissue independently regenerating\r\nand propagating itself, but as a fluid in a state of constant dependence\r\nupon other parts. I consider that every dyscrasia _is dependent upon a\r\npermanent supply of noxious ingredients from certain sources_. As a\r\ncontinual ingestion of injurious food is capable of vitiating the blood,\r\nin like manner persistent disease in a definite organ is able to furnish\r\nthe blood with a continual supply of morbid materials.\r\n\r\nThe essential point, therefore, is to search for the _local sources_ of\r\nthe different dyscrasiæ which cause disorders of the blood, for every\r\npermanent change which takes place in the condition of the circulating\r\njuices must be derived from definite organs or tissues.\r\n\r\nThe blood contains certain morphological elements. It contains a\r\nsubstance, _fibrine_, which appears as fibrillac when the blood clots,\r\nand red and colourless blood corpuscles.\r\n\r\nThe red blood corpuscles contain no nuclei except at certain periods of\r\nthe development of the embyro. They are lighter or darker red according\r\nto the oxygen they contain. When treated with concentrated fluids they\r\nshrivel; when treated with diluted fluids they swell. They are rather\r\ncoin-shaped, and when a drop of blood is quiet they are usually found\r\naggregated in rows, like rouleaux of money.\r\n\r\nThe colourless corpuscles are much less numerous than the red\r\ncorpuscles--only one to 300--but they are larger, and contain nuclei.\r\nWhen blood coagulates the white corpuscles sink more slowly and appear\r\nas a lighter coloured layer on the top of the clot.\r\n\r\nPus cells are very like colourless corpuscles, and the relation between\r\nthe two has been much debated. A pus cell can be distinguished from a\r\ncolourless blood cell only by its mode of origin. If it have an origin\r\nexternal to the blood, it must be pus; if it originate in the blood, it\r\nmust be considered to be a blood cell.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of its development, a white blood corpuscle is seen\r\nto modify by division; but in fully-developed blood such division is\r\nnever seen. It is probable that colourless white corpuscles are given to\r\nthe adult blood by the lymphatic glands. Every irritation of a part\r\nwhich is freely connected with lymphatic glands increases the number of\r\ncolourless cells in the blood. Any excessive increase from this source I\r\nhave designated _leucocytosis_.\r\n\r\nIn the first months of the embryo the red cell multiplies by division.\r\nIn adult life the mode of its multiplication is unknown. They, also, are\r\nprobably formed in the lymphatic glands and spleen.\r\n\r\nIn a disease I have named _leukæmia_, the colourless blood cells\r\nincrease in number enormously. In such cases there is always disease of\r\nthe spleen, and very often of the lymphatic glands.\r\n\r\nThese facts can hardly, I think, be interpreted in any other manner than\r\nby supposing that the spleen and lymphatic glands are intimately\r\nconcerned in the production of the formed elements of the blood.\r\n\r\nBy _pyæmia_ is meant pus corpuscles in the blood. But most cases of\r\nso-called pyæmia are really cases in which there is an increase of white\r\nblood corpuscles, and it is doubtful whether such a condition as pus in\r\nthe blood does ever occur. In the extremely rare cases, in which pus\r\nbreaks through into the veins, purulent ingredients may, without doubt,\r\nbe conveyed into the blood, but in such cases the introduction of pus\r\noccurs for the most part but once, and there is no persistent pyæmia.\r\nEven when clots in veins break down and form matter like pus, it will be\r\nfound that the matter is not really pus, and contains no pus cells.\r\n\r\n_Chlorosis_ is a condition in which there is a diminution of the\r\ncellular elements of the blood, due probably to their deficient\r\nformation in the spleen and lymphatic glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vital Processes and Their Relation to Disease. Inflammation_\r\n\r\nThe study of the histology of the nervous system shows that in all parts\r\nof the body a splitting up into a number of small centres takes place,\r\nand that nowhere does a single central point susceptible of anatomical\r\ndemonstration exist from which the operations of the body are directed.\r\nWe find in the nervous systems definite little cells which serve as\r\ncentres of motion, but we do not find any single ganglion cell in which\r\nalone all movement in the end originates. The most various individual\r\nmotor apparatuses are connected with the most various individual motor\r\nganglion cells. Sensations are certainly collected in definite ganglion\r\ncells. Still, among them, too, we do not find any single ganglion cell\r\nwhich can be in any way designated the centre of all sensation, but we\r\nagain meet with a great number of very minute centres. All the\r\noperations which have their source in the nervous system, and there\r\ncertainly are a very great number of them, do not allow us to recognise\r\na unity anywhere else than in our own consciousness. An anatomical or\r\nphysiological unity has at least as yet been nowhere demonstrated.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk of life we mean vital activity. Now, every vital action\r\nsupposes an excitation or irritation. The irritability of the part is\r\nthe criterion by which we judge whether it be alive or not. Our notion\r\nof the death of a part is based upon nothing more or less than\r\nthis--that we can no longer detect any irritability in it. If we now\r\nproceed with our analysis of what is to be included in the notion of\r\nexcitability, we at once discover, that the different actions which can\r\nbe provoked by the influence of any external agency are essentially of\r\nthree kinds. The result of an excitation or irritation may, according to\r\ncircumstances, be either a merely functional process, or a more or less\r\nincreased nutrition of the part, _or_ a formative process giving rise to\r\na greater or less number of new elements. These differences manifest\r\nthemselves more or less distinctly according as the particular tissues\r\nare more or less capable of responding to the one or other kinds of\r\nexcitation. It certainly cannot be denied that the processes may not be\r\ndistinctly defined, and that between the nutritive and formative\r\nprocesses, and also between the functional and nutritive ones there are\r\ntransitional stages; still, when they are typically performed, there is\r\na very marked difference between them, and considerable differences in\r\nthe internal changes undergone by the excited parts.\r\n\r\nIn inflammation all three irritative processes occur side by side.\r\nIndeed, we may frequently see that when the organ itself is made up of\r\ndifferent parts, one part of the tissue undergoes functional or\r\nnutritive, another formative, changes. If we consider what happens in a\r\nmuscle we see that a chemical or traumatic stimulus produces a\r\nfunctional irritation of the primitive fasciculi, with contraction of\r\nthe muscle followed by nutritive changes. On the other hand, in the\r\ninterstitial connective tissue which binds the individual fasciculi of\r\nthe muscle together, real new formations are readily produced, commonly\r\npus. In this manner the three forms of irritation may be distinguished\r\nin one part.\r\n\r\nThe formative process is always preceded by nutritive enlargement due to\r\nirritation of the part, and has no connection with irritation of the\r\nnerves. Of course there may be also an irritation of the nerves, but\r\nthis, if we do not take function into account, has no causal connection\r\nwith the processes going on in the tissue proper, but is merely a\r\ncollateral effect of the original disturbance.\r\n\r\nBesides these active processes of function, nutrition, and new\r\nformation, there occur passive processes. Passive processes are called\r\nthose changes in cells whereby they either lose a portion of their\r\nsubstance, or are so completely destroyed, that a loss of substance, a\r\ndiminution of the sum total of the constituents of the body is produced.\r\nTo this class belong fatty degeneration of cells, affection of arteries,\r\ncalcification, and ossification of arteries, amyloid degeneration, and\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\nIt will now be necessary to consider inflammation at more length. The\r\ntheory of inflammation has passed through various stages. At first heat\r\nwas considered as its essential and dominant feature, then redness,\r\nthen exudative swelling; while the speculative neuropathologists\r\nconsider pain the _fons et origo_ of the condition.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe that irritation must be taken as the\r\nstarting-point in the consideration of inflammation. We cannot conceive\r\nof inflammation without an irritating stimulus, and the first question\r\nis, what conception we are to form of such a stimulus.\r\n\r\nAn inflammatory stimulus is a stimulus which acts either directly or\r\nthrough the medium of the blood upon the composition and constitution of\r\na part in such a way as to enable it to attract to itself a larger\r\nquantity of matter than usual and to transform it according to\r\ncircumstances. Every form of inflammation with which we are acquainted\r\nmay be explained in this way. It may be assumed that inflammation begins\r\nfrom the moment that this increased absorption of matters into the\r\ntissue takes place, and the further transformation of these matters\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed that hyperæmia is not the essential feature of\r\ninflammation, for inflammation occurs in non-vascular as well as in\r\nvascular parts, and the inflammatory processes are practically the same\r\nin both instances.\r\n\r\nNor is inflammatory exudation the essential feature of inflammation. I\r\nam of the opinion that there is no specific inflammatory exudation at\r\nall, but that the exudation we meet with is composed essentially of the\r\nmaterial which has been generated in the inflamed part itself, through\r\nthe change in its condition, and of the transuded fluid derived from the\r\nvessels. If, therefore, a part possess a great number of vessels, and\r\nparticularly if they are superficial, it will be able to furnish an\r\nexudation, since the fluid which transudes from the blood conveys the\r\nspecial product of the tissue along with it to the surface. If this is\r\nnot the case, there will be no exudation, but the whole process will be\r\nlimited to the occurrence in the real substance of the tissue of the\r\nspecial changes which have been induced by the inflammatory stimulus.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, two forms of inflammation can be distinguished, the\r\n_purely parenchymatous inflammation_, where the process runs its course\r\nin the interior of the tissue, without our being able to detect the\r\npresence of any free fluid which has escaped from the blood; and the\r\nsecretory (exudative) inflammation, where an increased escape of fluid\r\ntakes place from the blood, and conveys the peculiar parenchymatous\r\nmatters along with it to the surface of the organs. That there are two\r\nkinds of inflammation is shown by the fact that they occur for the most\r\npart in different organs. Every parenchymatous inflammation tends to\r\nalter the histological and functional character of an organ. Every\r\ninflammation with free exudation generally affords a certain relief to\r\nthe parts by conveying away from it a great part of the noxious matters\r\nwith which it is clogged.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New Formations_\r\n\r\nI at present entirely reject the blastema doctrine in its original form,\r\nand in its place I put the _doctrine of the continuous development of\r\ntissues out of one another_. My first doubts of the blastema doctrine\r\ndate from my researches on tubercle. I found the tubercles never\r\nexhibited a discernible exudation; but always organised elements\r\nunpreceded by amorphous matter. I also found that the discharge from\r\nscrofulous glands and from inflamed lymphatic glands is not an exudation\r\ncapable of organisation but merely débris, developed from the ordinary\r\ncells of the glands.\r\n\r\nUntil, however, the cellular nature of the body had been demonstrated,\r\nit seemed necessary in some instances to postulate a blastema or\r\nexudation to account for certain new formations. But the moment I could\r\nshow the universality of cells--the moment I could show that bone\r\ncorpuscles were real cells, and that connective tissues contained\r\ncells--from that moment cellular material for the building of new\r\nformations was apparent. In fact, the more observers increased the more\r\ndistinctly was it shown that by far the greater number of new formations\r\narise from the connective tissue. In almost all cases new formations may\r\nbe seen to be formed by a process of ordinary cell division from\r\npreviously existing cells. In some cases the cells continue to resemble\r\nthe parent cells; in other cases they become different. All new\r\nformations built of cells which continue true to the parent type we may\r\ncall homologous new formations; while those which depart from the parent\r\ntype or undergo degenerative changes we may designate heterologous. In a\r\nnarrower sense of the word heterologous new formations are alone\r\ndestructive. The homologous ones may accidentally become very injurious,\r\nbut still they do not possess what can properly be called a destructive\r\nor malignant character. On the other hand, every kind of heterologous\r\nformation whenever it has not its seat in entirely superficial parts,\r\nhas a certain degree of malignity, and even superficial affections,\r\nthough entirely confined to the most external layers of epidermis, may\r\ngradually exercise a very detrimental effect. Indeed, suppuration is of\r\nthis nature, for suppuration is simply a process of proliferation by\r\nmeans of which cells are produced which do not acquire that degree of\r\nconsolidation or permanent connection with each other which is necessary\r\nfor the existence of the body. Pus is not the solvent of cells: but is\r\nitself dissolved tissues. A part becomes soft and liquefies, while\r\nsuppurating, but it is not the pus which causes this softening; on the\r\ncontrary, it is the pus which is produced as the result of the\r\nproliferation of tissues.\r\n\r\nA suppurative change of this nature takes place in all heterologous new\r\nformations. The form of ulceration which is presented by cancer in its\r\nlatest stages bears so great a resemblance to suppurative ulceration\r\nthat the two things have long since been compared. The difference\r\nbetween suppuration and suppuration lies in the differing duration of\r\nthe life of different cells. A cancer cell is capable of existing longer\r\nthan a pus corpuscle, and a cancerous tumour may last for months yet\r\nstill contain the whole of its elements intact. We are as yet able in\r\nthe case of very few elements to state with absolute certainty the\r\naverage length of their life. But among all pathological new formations\r\nwith fluid intercellular substance there is not a single one which is\r\nable to preserve its existence for any length of time--not a single one\r\nwhose elements can become permanent constituents of the body, or exist\r\nas long as the individual. The tumour as a whole may last; but its\r\nindividual elements perish. If we examine a tumour after it has existed\r\nfor perhaps a year, we usually find that the elements first formed no\r\nlonger exist in the centre; but that in the centre they are\r\ndisintegrating, dissolved by fatty changes. If a tumour be seated on a\r\nsurface, it often presents in the centre of its most prominent part a\r\nnavel-like depression, and the parts under this display a dense cicatrix\r\nwhich no longer bears the original character of the new formation.\r\nHeterologous new formations must be considered parasitical in their\r\nnature, since every one of their elements will withdraw matters from the\r\nbody which might be used for better purposes, and since even its first\r\ndevelopment implies the destruction of its parent structures.\r\n\r\nIn view of origin of new formations it were well to create a\r\nnomenclature showing their histological basis; but new names must not be\r\nintroduced too suddenly, and it must be noted that there are certain\r\ntumours whose histological pedigree is still uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed in the United States of America_\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Azure transparent spheres conceived by the ancients to surround the\r\nearth one within another, and to carry the heavenly bodies in their\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\n[2] Book I., Prop. i.
