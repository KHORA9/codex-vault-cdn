The\r\nparticulars of Frank’s desperate fight with the moose had become known\r\nthroughout the village, and the “Young Naturalist” enjoyed an enviable\r\nreputation as a hunter. He was obliged to relate his adventures over\r\nand over again, until one day his thoughts and conversation were\r\nturned into a new channel by the arrival of an uncle, who had just\r\nreturned from California.\r\n\r\nUncle James had been absent from home nearly ten years, and during\r\nmost of that time had lived in the mines. Although the boys had not\r\nseen him since they were six years old, and of course could not\r\nremember him, they were soon on the best of terms with each other.\r\nUncle James had an inexhaustible fund of stories; he had crossed the\r\nplains, fought the Indians, was accustomed to scenes of danger and\r\nexcitement, and had such an easy way of telling his adventures, that\r\nthe boys never grew tired of listening to them. The day after his\r\narrival he visited the museum, gazed in genuine wonder at the numerous\r\nspecimens of his nephews’ handiwork, and listened to the descriptions\r\nof their hunting expeditions with as much interest as though he had\r\nbeen a boy himself. Then he engaged in hunting with them, and entered\r\ninto the sport with all the reckless eagerness of youth.\r\n\r\nThe winter was passed in this way, and when spring returned, Uncle\r\nJames began to talk of returning to California to settle up his\r\nbusiness. He had become attached to life in the mines, but could not\r\nbear the thought of leaving his relatives again. The quiet comforts he\r\nhad enjoyed at the cottage he thought were better than the rough life\r\nand hard fare to which he had been accustomed for the last ten years.\r\nHe had left his business, however, in an unsettled state, and, as soon\r\nas he could “close it up,” would return and take up his abode in\r\nLawrence. The cousins regretted that the parting time was so near, for\r\nthey looked upon their relative as the very pattern of an uncle, but\r\nconsoled themselves by looking forward to the coming winter, when he\r\nwould be settled as a permanent inmate of the cottage.\r\n\r\n“I say, Frank,” exclaimed Archie one day, as he burst into the study,\r\nwhere his cousin was engaged in cleaning his gun preparatory to a\r\nmuskrat hunt, “there’s something in the wind. Just now, as I came\r\nthrough the sitting-room, I surprised our folks and Uncle James\r\ntalking very earnestly about something. But they stopped as soon as I\r\ncame in, and, as that was a gentle hint that they didn’t want me to\r\nknow any thing about it, I came out. There’s something up, I tell\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“It’s about uncle’s business, I suppose,” replied Frank. But if that\r\n_was_ the subject of the conversation, Archie came to the conclusion\r\nthat his affairs must be in a very unsettled state, for when they\r\nreturned from their hunt that night the same mysterious conversation\r\nwas going on again. It ceased, however, as the boys entered the room,\r\nwhich made Archie more firm in his belief than ever that there was\r\n“something up.”\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at the breakfast-table, Archie’s father announced\r\nhis intention of returning to Portland at once, as his business needed\r\nhis attention; and, turning to the boys, inquired:\r\n\r\n“Well, have you had hunting enough this winter to satisfy you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Then I suppose you don’t want to go across the plains with your Uncle\r\nJames?”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” shouted Archie, springing to his feet, and upsetting his\r\ncoffee-cup. “Did you say we might go?”\r\n\r\n“Be a little more careful, Archie,” said his father. “No, I did not\r\nsay so.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it amounts to the same thing,” thought Archie, “for father\r\nnever would have said a word about it if he wasn’t intending to let us\r\ngo. I knew there was something up.”\r\n\r\nWe need not stop to repeat the conversation that followed. Suffice it\r\nto say, that Uncle James, having fully made up his mind to return to\r\nthe village as soon as he could settle up his business, had asked\r\npermission for his nephews to accompany him across the plains. Their\r\nparents, thinking of the fight with the moose, and knowing the\r\nreckless spirit of the boys, had at first objected. But Uncle James,\r\npromising to keep a watchful eye on them, had, after considerable\r\nargument, carried the day, and it was finally decided that the boys\r\ncould go.\r\n\r\n“But remember,” said Mr. Winters, “you are to be governed entirely by\r\nUncle James; for, if you have no one to take care of you, you will be\r\nin more fights with bears and panthers.”\r\n\r\nThe boys readily promised obedience, and, hardly waiting to finish\r\ntheir breakfast, went into the study to talk over their plans.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I tell you there was something up?” said Archie, as soon as\r\nthey had closed the door. “We’ll have a hunt now that will throw all\r\nour former hunting expeditions in the shade.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as their excitement had somewhat abated, they remembered that\r\nDick Lewis, the trapper, had told them that it was his intention to\r\nstart for the prairie in the spring. If he had not already gone, would\r\nit not be a good plan to secure his company? He knew all about the\r\nprairie, and might be of service to them. They laid the matter before\r\nUncle James, who, without hesitation, pronounced it an excellent idea.\r\n“For,” said he, “we are in no hurry. Instead of going by stage, we\r\nwill buy a wagon and a span of mules and take our time. If we don’t\r\nhappen to fall in with a train, we shall, no doubt, want a guide.” As\r\nsoon, therefore, as the ice had left the creek so that it could be\r\ntraveled with a boat, Uncle James accompanied the boys to the\r\ntrapper’s cabin.\r\n\r\nDick met them at the door, and greeted them with a grasp so hearty,\r\nthat they all felt its effects for a quarter of an hour afterward.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t gone yet,” said he; “but it won’t be long afore I see the\r\nprairy onct more.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Dick,” said Frank, “we’re going, too, and want you to go with\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nThe trapper and his brother opened their eyes wide with astonishment,\r\nbut Uncle James explained, and ended by offering to pay the trapper’s\r\nexpenses if he would accompany them. After a few moments’\r\nconsideration, he accepted the proposition, saying:\r\n\r\n“I have tuk to the youngsters mightily. They’re gritty fellers, an’ I\r\nshould like to show ’em a bit of prairy life.”\r\n\r\nUncle James and the boys remained at the cabin nearly a week, during\r\nwhich their plans were all determined upon, and, when they arrived at\r\nhome, they at once commenced preparations for their journey. Their\r\ndouble-barreled shotguns were oiled, and put carefully away. They were\r\nvery efficient weapons among small game, but Uncle James said they\r\nwere not in the habit of using “pop-guns” on the prairie; they would\r\npurchase their fire-arms and other necessary weapons at St. Louis.\r\n\r\nThe first of June--the time set for the start--at length arrived, and\r\nwith it came the trapper, accompanied by his dog. Dick carried his\r\nlong rifle on his shoulder, his powder-horn and bullet-pouch at his\r\nside, and a knapsack, containing a change of clothes and other\r\nnecessary articles, at his back. He had evidently bestowed more than\r\nusual care upon his toilet; his suit of buckskin was entirely new,\r\nand even his rifle seemed to have received a thorough rubbing and\r\ncleaning preparatory to its introduction into civilized life. Frank\r\nand Archie meeting him at the door, relieved him of his rifle and\r\npack, and conducted him into the house. But here the trapper was sadly\r\nout of place. He sat on the edge of his chair, and was constantly\r\nchanging the position of his feet, and looking down at the rich\r\ncarpet, as if he could hardly believe that it was made to walk upon.\r\nThe inmates of the cottage used every exertion in their power to make\r\nhim feel at his ease, and, to some extent, succeeded; but he breathed\r\nmuch more freely when the farewells had been said, and the party was\r\non its way to the wharf. In due time they arrived at Portland, where\r\nthey remained nearly a week. Here the trapper again found himself in\r\nhot water. He was installed in a large, airy room in Mr. Winter’s\r\nelegant residence; but he would much rather have been assigned\r\nquarters among the trees in the yard. The sights and sounds of the\r\ncity were new to him, and at every corner he found something to wonder\r\nat. When on the street, he was continually getting in somebody’s way,\r\nor being separated from his companions, who found it necessary to\r\nkeep a vigilant watch over him. But it was on the train that his\r\nastonishment reached its height. He had never before traveled in the\r\ncars, and, as they thundered away, going faster and faster as they\r\nleft the city behind, the trapper began to clutch his seat, and to\r\nlook wistfully out the window at the woods, which appeared to be\r\ndancing by, as if he never expected to be permitted to enter his\r\nnatural element again. He would have preferred to “foot it,” as he\r\nremarked, and, when at last they reached St. Joseph, he drew a long\r\nbreath of relief, mentally resolving that he would never again tempt\r\ndestruction by traveling either on a steamboat or railroad car.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight when they reached the hotel. Being very much fatigued\r\nwith their long journey, they at once secured rooms and retired, and\r\nwere soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe Wagon Train.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn awaking the next morning, the boys found themselves surrounded by\r\nnew scenes. While they were dressing, they looked out at the window,\r\nand obtained their first view of a wagon train, which was just\r\nstarting out for the prairie. The wagons were protected by canvas\r\ncovers, some drawn by oxen, others by mules, and the entire train\r\nbeing accompanied by men both on foot and on horseback. Fat, sleek\r\ncows followed meekly after the wagons, from behind whose covering\r\npeeped the faces of women and children--the families of the hardy\r\npioneers now on their way to find new homes amid the solitude of that\r\nwestern region.\r\n\r\nThe boys watched the train until it disappeared, and then went down\r\nstairs to get their breakfast. Uncle James was not to be found. In\r\nfact, ever since leaving Portland, he seemed to have forgotten his\r\npromise to his brother, for he never bothered his head about his\r\nnephews. It is true, he had watched them rather closely at the\r\nbeginning of the journey, but soon discovered that they were fully\r\ncapable of taking care of themselves and the trapper besides. He did\r\nnot make his appearance until nearly two hours after the boys had\r\nfinished their breakfast, and then he rode up to the hotel mounted on\r\na large, raw-boned, ugly-looking horse. He was followed by the\r\ntrapper, who was seated in a covered wagon, drawn by a span of mules,\r\nwhile behind the wagon were two more horses, saddled and bridled.\r\n\r\n“Now, then, boys,” said Uncle James, as he dismounted and tied his\r\nhorse to a post, “where’s your baggage? We’re going with that train\r\nthat went out this morning.”\r\n\r\n“An’ here, youngsters,” exclaimed Dick, as he climbed down out of his\r\nwagon, “come an’ take your pick of these two hosses. This one,” he\r\ncontinued, pointing to a small, gray horse, which stood impatiently\r\npawing the ground and tossing his head--“this feller is young and\r\nfoolish yet. He don’t know nothin’ ’bout the prairy or buffaler\r\nhuntin’; an’ if whoever gets him should undertake to shoot a rifle\r\nwhile on his back, he would land him on the ground quicker nor\r\nlightnin’. I ’spect I shall have to larn him a few lessons. But this\r\none”--laying his hand on the other horse, which stood with his head\r\ndown and his eyes closed, as if almost asleep--“he’s an ole buffaler\r\nhunter. The feller that your uncle bought him of has jest come in from\r\nthe mountains. He can travel wusser nor a steamboat if you want him\r\nto, an’ you can leave him on the prairy any whar an’ find him when you\r\ncome back. Now, youngster,” he added, turning to Frank, “which’ll you\r\nhave?”\r\n\r\n“I have no choice,” replied Frank. “Which one do you want, Archie?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the latter, “I’d rather have the buffalo hunter. He\r\nlooks as though he hadn’t spirit enough to throw a fellow off, but\r\nthat gray looks rather vicious.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, then, that’s settled,” said the trapper; “so fetch on your\r\nplunder, an’ let’s be movin’ to onct.”\r\n\r\nTheir baggage, which consisted of three trunks--small, handy affairs,\r\ncapable of holding a considerable quantity of clothing, but not\r\nrequiring much space--was stowed away in the wagon. When Uncle James\r\nhad paid their bill at the hotel, they mounted their horses, and the\r\ntrapper, who now began to feel more at home, took his seat in the\r\nwagon, and drove after the train. Archie soon began to think that he\r\nhad shown considerable judgment in the selection of his horse, for\r\nthey had not gone far before the gray began to show his temper. After\r\nmaking several attempts to turn his head toward home--a proceeding\r\nwhich Frank successfully resisted--he began to dance from one side of\r\nthe street to the other, and ended by endeavoring to throw his rider\r\nover his head; but the huge Spanish saddle, with its high front and\r\nback, afforded him a secure seat; and after receiving a few sharp\r\nthrusts from Frank’s spurs, the gray quietly took his place by the\r\nside of Archie’s horse, and walked along as orderly and gentle as\r\ncould be wished.\r\n\r\nThe trapper, who was now the chief man of the party, had superintended\r\nthe buying of their outfit, and, although it was a simple one, they\r\nwere still well provided with every necessary article. The boys were\r\ndressed in complete suits of blue jeans, an article that will resist\r\nwear and dirt to the last extremity, broad-brimmed hats, and heavy\r\nhorseman’s boots, the heels of which were armed with spurs.\r\n\r\nTheir weapons, which were stowed away in the wagon, consisted of a\r\nbrace of revolvers and a hunting-knife each, and Archie owned a short\r\nbreech-loading rifle, while Frank had purchased a common “patch”\r\nrifle. The wagon also contained provisions in abundance--coffee, corn\r\nmeal, bacon, and the like--and ammunition for their weapons. Their\r\nappearance would have created quite a commotion in the quiet little\r\nvillage of Lawrence, but in St. Joseph such sights were by no means\r\nuncommon. Buckskin was much more plenty than broadcloth, and the\r\npeople who passed them on the streets scarcely noticed them.\r\n\r\nAt length, just before dark, they overtook the train, which had\r\nstopped for the night. The wagons were drawn up on each side of the\r\nroad, and altogether the camp presented a scene that was a pleasant\r\none to men wearied with their day’s journey. Cattle were feeding\r\nquietly near the wagons, chickens cackled joyously from their coops,\r\nmen and women were busily engaged with their preparations for supper,\r\nwhile groups of noisy children rolled about on the grass, filling the\r\ncamp with the sounds of their merry laughter.\r\n\r\nThe trapper drove on until he found a spot suitable for their camp,\r\nand then turned off the road and stopped. He at once began to\r\nunharness the mules, while the boys, after removing their saddles,\r\nfastened their horses to the wagon with a long rope, and allowed them\r\nto graze. When the trapper had taken care of his mules, he started a\r\nfire, and soon a coffee-pot was simmering and sputtering over the\r\nflames, and several slices of bacon were broiling on the coals. After\r\nsupper, the boys spread their blankets out under the wagon, and, being\r\nweary with their day’s ride (for it was something new to them), soon\r\nfell asleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when they awoke it was just daylight. After drawing\r\non their boots, they crawled out from under the wagon, and found the\r\ntrapper, standing with his hat off, and his long arms extended as if\r\nabout to embrace some invisible object.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what, youngsters,” said he, as the boys approached; “if\r\nthis aint nat’ral; jest take a sniff of that ar fresh air! Here,” he\r\ncontinued, looking about him with a smile of satisfaction--“here, I\r\nknow all ’bout things. I’m to hum now. Thar’s nothin’ on the prairy\r\nthat Dick Lewis can’t ’count fur. But, youngsters, I wouldn’t travel\r\non them ar steamboats an’ railroads ag’in fur all the beaver in the\r\nMissouri River. Every thing in them big cities seemed to say to me,\r\n‘Dick, you haint got no business here.’ Them black walls an’ stone\r\nroads; them rumblin’ carts an’ big stores, war sights I never seed\r\nafore, an’ I never want to see ’em ag’in. I know I was treated mighty\r\nkind, an’ all that; but it couldn’t make me feel right. I didn’t like\r\nthem streets, windin’ an’ twistin’ about, an’ allers loosin’ a feller;\r\nan’ I wasn’t to hum. But _now_, youngsters, I know what I’m doin’.\r\nNobody can’t lose Dick Lewis on the prairy. I know the names of all\r\nthe streets here; an’, ’sides, I know whar they all lead to. An’ as\r\nfur varmints, thar’s none of ’em that I haint trapped an’ fit. An’\r\nInjuns! I know a leetle ’bout them, I reckon. It’s funny that them ar\r\ncity chaps don’t know nothin’ ’bout what’s goin’ on out here; an’ it\r\nshows that all the larnin’ in the world aint got out o’ books. Send\r\none of ’em here, an’ I could show him a thing or two he never heern\r\ntell on. But I must be gettin’ breakfast, ’cause we’ll be off ag’in\r\nsoon; an’ on the prairy every feller has to look out fur himself. You\r\ncan’t pull a ring in the wall here, an’ have a chap with white huntin’\r\nshirt an’ morocker moccasins on come up an’ say: ‘Did you ring, sir?’\r\nAn’ how them ar fellers knowed which room to come to in them big\r\nhotels, is something I can’t get through my head. Thar’s no big bell\r\nto call a feller to grub here. Take one of them city chaps an’ give\r\nhim a rifle, an’ pint out over the prairy an’ tell him to go an’ hunt\r\nup his breakfast, an’ how would he come out? Could he travel by the\r\nsun, or tell the pints of the compass by the stars? Could he lasso an’\r\nride a wild mustang, or shoot a Injun plumb atween the eyes at two\r\nhundred an’ fifty yards? No! I reckon not! Wal, thar’s a heap o’\r\nthings I couldn’t do; an’ it shows that every man had oughter stick to\r\nhis own business. It’s all owin’ to a man’s bringin’ up.”\r\n\r\nWhile the trapper spoke he had been raking together the fire that had\r\nnearly gone out; and having got it fairly started, he began the work\r\nof getting breakfast. The boys, after rolling up their blankets and\r\npacking them away in the wagon, amused themselves in watching the\r\nmovements of the emigrants, who now began their preparations for their\r\nday’s journey. By the time Uncle James awoke, the trapper pronounced\r\ntheir breakfast ready. After they had done ample justice to the homely\r\nmeal (and it was astonishing what an appetite the fresh invigorating\r\nair of the prairie gave them), the boys packed the cooking utensils\r\naway in the wagon while the trapper began to harness the mules. This\r\nwas an undertaking that a less experienced man would have found to be\r\nextremely hazardous, for the animals persisted in keeping their heels\r\ntoward him, and it was only by skillful maneuvering that Dick\r\nsucceeded in getting them hitched to the wagon. By the time this was\r\naccomplished, Uncle James and the boys had saddled their horses and\r\nfollowed the trapper, who drove off as though he perfectly understood\r\nwhat he was about, leaving the train to follow at its leisure.\r\n\r\nDick acted as if he had again found himself among friends from whom he\r\nhad long been separated; but it was evident that sorrow was mingled\r\nwith his joy, for on every side his eye rested on the improvements of\r\ncivilization. The road was lined with fine, well-stocked farms, and\r\nthe prairie over which his father had hunted the buffalo and fought\r\nthe Indian, had been turned up by the plow, and would soon be covered\r\nwith waving crops. No doubt the trapper’s thoughts wandered into the\r\nfuture, for, as the boys rode up beside the wagon, he said, with\r\nsomething like a sigh:\r\n\r\n“Things aint as they used to be, youngsters. I can ’member the time\r\nwhen thar was’nt a fence within miles of here, an’ a feller could go\r\nout an’ knock over a buffaler fur breakfast jest as easy as that\r\nfarmer over thar could find one of his sheep. But the ax an’ plow have\r\nmade bad work with a fine country, the buffaler an’ Injun have been\r\npushed back t’wards the mountains, an’ it won’t be long afore thar’ll\r\nbe no room fur sich as me; an’ we won’t be missed neither, ’cause when\r\nthe buffaler an’ beaver are gone thar’ll be nothin’ fur us to do.\r\nThese farms will keep pushin’ out all the while; an’ when folks,\r\nsittin’ in their snug houses beside their warm fires, hear tell of the\r\nInjuns that onst owned this country, nobody will ever think that sich\r\nfellers as me an’ Bill Lawson an’ ole Bob Kelly ever lived. If ole\r\nBill was here now, he would say: ‘Let’s go back to the mountains,\r\nDick, an’ stay thar.’ He wouldn’t like to see his ole huntin’ grounds\r\nwasted in this way, an’ I don’t want to see it neither. But I know\r\nthat the Rocky Mountains an’ grizzly bars will last as long as I\r\nshall, an’ thar’ll be no need of trappers an’ hunters an’ guides arter\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nDick became silent after this, and it was not until the train halted\r\nfor the noon’s rest, that he recovered his usual spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAntelope Hunting.\r\n\r\n\r\nGradually the train left the improvements of civilization behind, and,\r\nat the end of three weeks, it was miles outside of a fence. Here the\r\ntrapper was in his natural element. He felt, as he expressed, “like a\r\nyoung one jest out o’ school,” adding, that all he needed was “one\r\nglimpse of a Comanche or Cheyenne to make him feel perfectly nat’ral.”\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the promise he had made Frank before leaving St.\r\nJoseph, he now took Pete (that was the name the latter had given his\r\nhorse) under his especial charge; and every morning, at the first peep\r\nof day, the boys saw him galloping over the prairie, firing his rifle\r\nas fast as he could reload, as if in pursuit of an imaginary herd of\r\nbuffaloes. At first the spirited animal objected to this mode of\r\ntreatment, and made the most desperate efforts to unseat his rider;\r\nbut the trapper, who had broken more than one wild mustang, was\r\nperfectly at home on horseback, and, after a few exercises of this\r\nkind, Pete was turned over to his young master, with the assurance\r\nthat he was ready to begin buffalo hunting. According to Frank’s idea,\r\nthe animal had improved considerably under the trapper’s system of\r\ntraining, for he would hardly wait for his rider to be fairly in the\r\nsaddle before he would start off at the top of his speed. The boys,\r\nwho considered themselves fully able to do any thing that had ever\r\nbeen accomplished by any one else, having seen Dick load and fire his\r\nrifle while riding at full speed, began to imitate his example, and in\r\na short time learned the art to perfection. In addition to this, each\r\nboy looked upon his horse as the better animal, and the emigrants were\r\nwitnesses to many a race between them, in which Sleepy Sam, as Archie\r\ncalled his horse, always came off winner. But Frank kept up the\r\ncontest, and at every possible opportunity the horses were “matched,”\r\nuntil they had learned their parts so well, that every time they\r\nfound themselves together, they would start off on a race without\r\nwaiting for the word from their riders.\r\n\r\nOne morning, just after the train had left the camp, as the boys were\r\nriding beside the wagon, listening to a story the trapper was\r\nrelating, the latter suddenly stopped, and, pointing toward a distant\r\nswell, said: “Do you see that ar’, youngsters?”\r\n\r\nThe boys, after straining their eyes in vain, brought their\r\nfield-glass into requisition, and finally discovered an object moving\r\nslowly along through the high grass; but the distance was so great,\r\nthey could not determine what it was.\r\n\r\n“That’s a prong-horn,” said the trapper at length. “An’ now, Frank,”\r\nhe continued, “if you’ll lend me that ar hoss, I’ll show you that all\r\nthe huntin’ in the world aint larnt in that leetle patch of timber\r\naround Lawrence.”\r\n\r\nFrank at once dismounted, and Dick, after securing his rifle, sprung\r\ninto the saddle, saying:\r\n\r\n“Come along easy-like, youngsters, an’ when I tell you, you get off\r\nan’ hide behind your hoss.”\r\n\r\nFrank mounted Sleepy Sam behind Archie, and they followed the trapper,\r\nwho led the way at an easy gallop. Useless, at his master’s command,\r\nremained with the wagon. They rode for a mile at a steady pace, and\r\nthen, seeing that the game had discovered them, the boys, at a signal\r\nfrom the trapper, stopped and dismounted, while Dick kept on alone,\r\nhis every movement closely watched by Frank and Archie, who, having\r\noften read of the skill required in hunting antelopes, were anxious to\r\nsee how it was done. The trapper rode on for about half a mile\r\nfurther, and then the boys saw him dismount, unbuckle the bridle, and\r\nhobble his horse so that he would not stray away. He then threw\r\nhimself on his hands and knees, and disappeared. A quarter of an hour\r\nafterward the boys saw his ’coon-skin cap waving above the grass. If\r\nthis was intended to attract the attention of the game, it did not\r\nmeet with immediate success, for the antelopes continued to feed\r\nleisurely up the swell, and finally some of their number disappeared\r\nbehind it. The boys regarded this as conclusive evidence that the\r\ntrapper’s plan had failed; but at length one of the antelopes, which\r\nstood a little apart from the others, and appeared to be acting as\r\nsentinel, uttered a loud snort, which instantly brought every member\r\nof the herd to his side. They remained huddled together for several\r\nmoments, as if in consultation, and then began to move slowly down\r\nthe swell toward the place where the trapper was concealed. There were\r\nabout twenty animals in the herd, and they came on in single file,\r\nstopping now and then to snuff the air and examine the object that had\r\nexcited their curiosity. But nothing suspicious was to be seen, for\r\nthe trapper was concealed in the grass, the only thing visible being\r\nhis cap, which he gently waved to and fro as he watched the movements\r\nof the game. The antelopes advanced slowly--much _too_ slowly for the\r\nimpatient boys, who, concealed behind their horse, closely watched all\r\ntheir movements, fearful that they might detect the presence of the\r\ntrapper, and seek safety in flight. But the latter well understood the\r\nmatter in hand, and presently the boys saw a puff of smoke rise from\r\nthe grass, and the nearest of the antelopes, springing into the air,\r\nfell dead in his tracks. The others turned and fled with the speed of\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Frank and Archie had mounted, and when they reached the\r\nplace where the trapper was standing, he had secured his prize, which\r\nwas one of the most graceful animals the boys had ever seen. It was\r\nabout three and a half feet high at the shoulders, and, although Dick\r\npronounced it very fat, its body was slender and its limbs small and\r\nmuscular. After having examined the animal to their satisfaction, they\r\nall mounted their horses, Dick carrying the game before him on his\r\nsaddle; and as they rode toward the wagon, Archie exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Now, Frank, we know how to hunt antelopes. It isn’t so very hard,\r\nafter all.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it?” inquired the trapper, with a laugh. “You don’t understand\r\nthe natur of the critters, when you say that. I know I killed this one\r\neasy, but a feller can’t allers do it. Howsomever, you can try your\r\nhand the next time we meet any, an’ if you do shoot one, I’ll allers\r\ncall you my ‘antelope killers.’ Them red handkerchiefs of your’n would\r\nbe jest the things to use, ’cause the critters can see it a long way.\r\nIf you can bring one of ’em into camp, it will be something wuth\r\nbraggin’ on.”\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the trapper did not entertain a very exalted\r\nopinion of the boys’ “hunting qualities;” but that did not convince\r\nthem that they could not shoot an antelope. On the contrary, it made\r\nthem all the more anxious for an opportunity to try their skill on\r\nthe game, if for no other reason than to show the trapper that he was\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour’s riding brought them to the wagon, which was standing\r\nwhere they had left it, and, after the buck had been skinned and\r\ncleaned, the trapper mounted to his seat and drove after the train,\r\nfollowed by the boys, who strained their eyes in every direction in\r\nthe hope of discovering another herd of antelopes. But nothing in the\r\nshape of a prong-horn was to be seen; and when the train resumed its\r\njourney after its noon halt, they gradually fell back until the wagons\r\nwere out of sight behind the hills. Then, leaving the road, they\r\ngalloped over the prairie until they reached the top of a high swell,\r\nwhen they stopped to look about them. About two miles to the left was\r\nthe train slowly winding among the hills; but the most faithful use of\r\ntheir glass failed to reveal the wished-for game. All that afternoon\r\nthey scoured the prairie on both sides of the wagons, and when it\r\nbegan to grow dark, they reluctantly turned their faces toward the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n“What did I tell you?” asked the trapper, as the boys rode up to the\r\nwagon, where the latter was unharnessing the mules. “I said you\r\ncouldn’t shoot a prong-horn.”\r\n\r\n“Of course we couldn’t,” answered Archie, “for we didn’t see any to\r\nshoot.”\r\n\r\n“I know that,” replied the trapper with a grin; “but _I_ seed plenty.\r\nThe next time you go a huntin’ prong-horns, be sartin that the wind\r\nblows from them t’wards you, an’ not from you t’wards them. They’ve\r\ngot sharp noses, them critters have.”\r\n\r\nThe boys were astonished. They had not thought of that; and Archie was\r\ncompelled to acknowledge that “there was something in knowing how,\r\nafter all.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe Best Trapper on the Prairie.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night the train encamped a short distance from one of the\r\nstations of the Overland Stage Company. The trapper, as usual, after\r\ntaking care of his mules, superintended the preparations for supper,\r\nwhile the boys, wearied with their day’s ride, threw themselves on the\r\ngrass near the wagon, and watched his movements with a hungry eye.\r\nUncle James, as he had done almost every night since leaving St.\r\nJoseph, walked about the camp playing with the children, who began to\r\nregard him as an old acquaintance. Presently the attention of the boys\r\nwas attracted by the approach of a stranger, whose long beard and thin\r\nhair--both as white as snow--bore evidence to the fact that he carried\r\nthe burden of many years on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed in a complete suit of buckskin, which, although well\r\nworn, was nevertheless very neat, and, in spite of his years, his step\r\nwas firm, and he walked as erect as an Indian. He carried a long heavy\r\nrifle on his shoulder, and from his belt peeped the head of a small\r\nhatchet of peculiar shape, and the buck-horn handle of a\r\nhunting-knife. He walked slowly through the camp, and when he came\r\nopposite the boys, Dick suddenly sprang from the ground where he had\r\nbeen seated, watching some steaks that were broiling on the coals,\r\nand, striding up to the stranger, laid his hand on his shoulder. The\r\nlatter turned, and, after regarding him sharply for a moment, thrust\r\nout his hand, which the trapper seized and wrung in silence. For an\r\ninstant they stood looking at each other without speaking, and then\r\nDick took the old man by the arm and led him up to the fire,\r\nexclaiming:\r\n\r\n“Bob Kelly, the oldest an’ best trapper on the prairy!”\r\n\r\nThe boys arose as he approached, and regarded him with curiosity. They\r\nhad heard their guide speak in the highest terms of “ole Bob\r\nKelly,” and had often wished to see the trapper whom Dick was\r\nwilling to acknowledge as his superior. There he was--a mild,\r\ngood-natured-looking old man, the exact opposite of what they had\r\nimagined him to be.\r\n\r\n“Them are city chaps, Bob”--continued the trapper, as the old man,\r\nafter gazing at the boys for a moment, seated himself on the ground\r\nbeside the fire--“an’ I’m takin’ ’em out to Californy. In course they\r\nare green consarnin’ prairy life, but they are made of good stuff, an’\r\nare ’bout the keerlessest youngsters you ever see. What a doin’ here,\r\nBob?”\r\n\r\n“Jest lookin’ round,” was the answer. “I’m mighty glad to meet you\r\nag’in, ’cause it looks nat’ral to see you ’bout. Things aint as they\r\nused to be. Me an’ you are ’bout the oldest trappers agoin’ now. The\r\nboys have gone one arter the other, an’ thar’s only me an’ you left\r\nthat I knows on.”\r\n\r\n“What’s come on Jack Thomas?” asked Dick.\r\n\r\n“We’re both without our chums now,” answered the old man, sorrowfully.\r\n“Jack an’ ole Bill Lawson are both gone, an’ their scalps are in a\r\nComanche wigwam.”\r\n\r\nThe trapper made no reply, but went on with his preparations for\r\nsupper in silence, and the boys could see that he was considerably\r\naffected by the news he had just heard. His every movement was closely\r\nwatched by his companion, who seemed delighted to meet his old\r\nacquaintance once more, and acted as though he did not wish to allow\r\nhim out of his sight. There was evidently a good deal of honest\r\naffection between these two men. It did not take the form of words,\r\nbut would have showed itself had one or the other of them been in\r\ndanger. They did not speak again until Mr. Winters came up, when Dick\r\nagain introduced his friend as the “oldest an’ best trapper agoin’.”\r\nUncle James, who understood the customs of the trappers, simply\r\nbowed--a greeting which the old man returned with one short, searching\r\nglance, as if he meant to read his very thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Now, then!” exclaimed Dick, “Grub’s ready. Pitch in, Bob.”\r\n\r\nThe old trapper was not in the habit of standing upon ceremony, and,\r\ndrawing his huge knife from his belt, he helped himself to a generous\r\npiece of the meat, and, declining the corn-bread and the cup of coffee\r\nwhich the boys passed over to him, made his meal entirely of venison.\r\nAfter supper--there were but few dishes to wash now, for the boys had\r\nlearned to go on the principle that “fingers were made before\r\nforks”--the trapper hung what remained of the venison in the wagon,\r\nlighted his pipe, and stretched himself on the ground beside his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThe boys, knowing that the trappers would be certain to talk over the\r\nevents that had transpired since their last meeting, spread their\r\nblankets where they could hear all that passed, and waited impatiently\r\nfor them to begin; while Mr. Winters, who had by this time become\r\nacquainted with every man, woman, and child, in the train, started to\r\npay a visit to the occupants of a neighboring wagon.\r\n\r\nFor some moments the two men smoked in silence, old Bob evidently\r\noccupied with his own thoughts, and Dick patiently waiting for him to\r\nspeak. At length the old man asked:\r\n\r\n“Goin’ to Californy, Dick?”\r\n\r\nThe trapper replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n“What a goin’ to do arterward?”\r\n\r\n“I’m a goin’ to take to the mountains, an’ stay thar,” replied Dick.\r\n“I’ve seed the inside of a city, Bob; have rid on steam railroads an’\r\nboats as big as one of the Black Hills; an’ now I’m satisfied to stay\r\nhere. I’d a heap sooner face a grizzly or a Injun than go back thar\r\nag’in, ’cause I didn’t feel to hum.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, I’m all alone now, Dick,” said the old man, “an’ so are you. Our\r\nchums are gone, an’ we both want to settle with them Comanche\r\nvarmints; so, let’s stick together.”\r\n\r\nDick seemed delighted with this proposition, for he quickly arose from\r\nhis blanket and extended his hand to his companion, who shook it\r\nheartily; and the boys read in their faces a determination to stand by\r\neach other to the last.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a chum now, youngsters,” said Dick, turning to the boys;\r\n“an’ one that I aint afraid to trust anywhar. Thar’s nothin’ like\r\nhavin’ a friend, even on the prairy. I come with the boys,” he added,\r\naddressing his companion, who, seeing the interest Dick took in his\r\n“youngsters,” slowly surveyed them from head to foot--“I come with ’em\r\njest to show ’em how we do things on the prairy. They can shoot\r\nconsid’ble sharp, an’ aint afraid. All it wants is the hard\r\nknocks--fightin’ Injuns an’ grizzlies, an’ starvin’ on the prairy, an’\r\nfreezin’ in the mountains, to make trappers of ’em.” And here Dick\r\nsettled back on his elbow, and proceeded to give the old man a short\r\naccount of what had transpired at Uncle Joe’s cabin; described\r\nFrank’s fight with the moose and panther in glowing language; told how\r\nthe capture of the cubs had been effected, until old Bob began to be\r\ninterested; and when Dick finished his story, he said:\r\n\r\n“The youngsters would make good trappers.”\r\n\r\nThis, as the trapper afterward told the boys, was a compliment old Bob\r\nseldom paid to any one, “for,” said he, “I’ve knowed him a long time,\r\nan’ have been in many a fight with him, an’ he never told me I was\r\ngood or bad.”\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Dick, again turning to his companion, “You said as how\r\nJack Thomas was rubbed out. How did it happen?”\r\n\r\nOld Bob refilled his pipe, smoked a few moments as if to bring the\r\nstory fresh to his memory, and then answered:\r\n\r\n“When I heered that Bill Lawson war gone, an’ that you war left alone,\r\nI done my best to find you, an’ get you to jine a small party we war\r\nmakin’ up to visit our ole huntin’ grounds on the Saskatchewan; but\r\nyou had tuk to the mountains, and nobody didn’t know whar to go to\r\nfind you. Thar war eight of us in the party, an’ here, you see, are\r\nall that are left. As nigh as I can ’member, it war ’bout four year\r\nago come spring that we sot out from the fort, whar we had sold our\r\nfurs. We had three pack mules, plenty of powder, ball, an’ sich like,\r\nan’ we started in high sperits, tellin’ the trader that bought our\r\nspelter that we’d have a fine lot fur him ag’in next meetin’ time. We\r\nknowed thar war plenty of Injuns an’ sich varmints to be fit an’\r\nkilled afore we come back, but that didn’t trouble us none, ’cause we\r\nall knowed our own bisness, and didn’t think but that we would come\r\nthrough all right, jest as we had done a hundred times afore. We\r\ndidn’t intend to stop afore we got to the Saskatchewan; so we traveled\r\npurty fast, an’ in ’bout three weeks found ourselves in the Blackfoot\r\ncountry, nigh the Missouri River. One night we camped on a leetle\r\nstream at the foot of the mountains, an’ the next mornin’, jest as we\r\nwar gettin’ ready to start out ag’in, Jack Thomas--who, like a\r\nyoungster turned loose from school, war allers runnin’ round, pokin’\r\nhis nose into whatever war goin’ on--came gallopin’ into camp,\r\nshouting:\r\n\r\n“‘Buffaler! buffaler!’\r\n\r\n“In course, we all knowed what that meant, an’ as we hadn’t tasted\r\nbuffaler hump since leavin’ the fort, we saddled up in a hurry an’\r\nput arter the game. We went along kinder easy-like--Jack leadin’ the\r\nway--until we come to the top of a swell, an’ thar they war--nothin’\r\nbut buffaler as fur as a feller could see. It war a purty sight, an’\r\nmore’n one of us made up our minds that we would have a good supper\r\nthat night. We couldn’t get no nigher to ’em without bein’ diskivered,\r\nso we scattered and galloped arter ’em. In course, the minit we showed\r\nourselves they put off like the wind; but we war in easy shootin’\r\ndistance, an’ afore we got through with ’em, I had knocked over four\r\nbig fellers an’ wounded another. He war hurt so bad he couldn’t run;\r\nbut I didn’t like to go up too clost to him, so I rid off a leetle\r\nway, an’ war loadin’ up my rifle to give him a settler, when I heered\r\na noise that made me prick up my ears an’ look sharp. I heered a\r\ntrampin, an’ I knowed it war made by something ’sides a buffaler. Now,\r\nyoungsters, a greenhorn wouldn’t a seed any thing strange in that; but\r\nwhen I heered it, I didn’t stop to kill the wounded buffaler, but\r\nturned my hoss an’ made tracks. I hadn’t gone more’n twenty rod afore\r\nI seed four Blackfoot Injuns comin’ over a swell ’bout half a mile\r\nback. I had kept my eyes open--as I allers do--but I hadn’t seen a\r\nbit of Injun sign on the prairy, an’ I made up my mind to onct that\r\nthem Blackfoot varmints had been shyin’ round arter the same buffaler\r\nwe had jest been chasin’, an’ that they didn’t know we war ’bout till\r\nthey heered us shoot. Then, in course, they put arter us, ’cause they\r\nthink a heap more of scalps than they do of buffaler meat.\r\n\r\n“Wal, as I war sayin’, I made tracks sudden; but they warn’t long in\r\ndiskiverin’ me, an’ they sot up a yell. I’ve heered that same yell\r\noften, an’ I have kinder got used to it; but I would have give my\r\nhoss, an’ this rifle, too, that I have carried for goin’ nigh onto\r\ntwenty year, if I had been safe in Fort Laramie, ’cause I didn’t think\r\nthem four Injuns war alone. I war sartin they had friends not a great\r\nway off, an’ somehow I a’most knowed how the hul thing was comin’ out.\r\nI didn’t hardly know which way to go to find our fellers, ’cause while\r\nwe were arter the buffaler we had got scattered a good deal; but jest\r\nas I come to the top of a swell I seed ’em a comin’. Jack Thomas war\r\nahead, an’ he war swingin’ his rifle an yellin’ wusser nor any Injun.\r\nI’ll allow, Dick, that it made me feel a heap easier when I seed them\r\ntrappers. Jack, who allers knowed what war goin’ on in the country\r\nfur five miles round, had first diskivered the Injuns, an’ had got all\r\nthe party together ’cept me, an’ in course they couldn’t think of\r\nsavin’ their own venison by runnin’ off and leavin’ me.\r\n\r\n“Wal, jest as soon as we got together we sot up a yell and faced\r\n’bout. The Injuns, up to this time, had rid clost together; but when\r\nthey seed that we warn’t goin’ to run no further jest then, they\r\nscattered as if they war goin’ to surround us; an’ then we all knowed\r\nthat them four Injuns warn’t alone. So, without stoppin’ to fight ’em,\r\nwe turned an’ run ag’in, makin’ tracks for the woods at the foot of\r\nthe mountains. An’ we warn’t a minit too soon, fur all of a sudden we\r\nheered a yell, an’ lookin’ back we seed ’bout fifty more red-skins\r\ncomin’ arter us like mad. They had a’most got us surrounded; but the\r\nway to the mountains war open, an’ we run fur our lives. The varlets\r\nthat had followed me war in good pluggin’ distance, an’ when we turned\r\nin our saddles an’ drawed a bead on ’em, we had four less to deal\r\nwith. It warn’t more ’n ten mile to the foot of them mountains, but it\r\nseemed a hundred to us, an’ we all drawed a long breath when we found\r\nourselves under kiver of the woods. The minit we reached the timber\r\nwe jumped off our hosses, hitched them to the trees, an’ made up our\r\nminds to fight it out thar an’ then. We knowed, as well as we wanted\r\nto know, what the Injuns would do next--they would leave a party on\r\nthe prairy to watch us, an’ the rest would go sneakin’ round through\r\nthe woods an’ pick us off one at a time. The only thing we could\r\ndo--leastwise till it come dark--war to watch the varlets, an’ drop\r\nevery one of ’em that showed his painted face in pluggin’ distance. We\r\nwar in a tight place. Our pack mules, an’ a’most all our kit, had been\r\nleft in the camp, an’ we knowed it wouldn’t be long afore the Injuns\r\nwould have ’em, an’ even if we got off with our bar, we wouldn’t be\r\nmuch better off--no traps, no grub, an’ skeercely half a dozen bullets\r\nin our pouches.\r\n\r\n“Wal, the Injuns, when they seed that we had tuk to the timber,\r\nstopped, takin’ mighty good keer, as they thought, to keep out of\r\nrange of our rifles, an’ began to hold a palaver, now an’ then lookin’\r\nt’wards us an’ settin’ up a yell, which told us plain enough that they\r\nthought they had us ketched. But we, knowin’ to an inch how fur our\r\nshootin’ irons would carry, drawed up an’ blazed away; an’ we knowed,\r\nby the way them red-skins got back over that swell, that we hadn’t\r\nthrowed our lead away. They left one feller thar to watch us,\r\nhowsomever, but he tuk mighty good keer to keep purty well out of\r\nsight, showin’ only ’bout two inches of his head ’bove the top of the\r\nhill. While the Injuns war holdin’ their council, we had a talk ’bout\r\nwhat we had better do. The truth war, thar war only one thing we could\r\ndo, an’ that war to stay thar until dark an’ then take our chances. We\r\nhad all fit savage Injuns enough to know that they wouldn’t bother us\r\nmuch so long as daylight lasted; but arter that, if we didn’t get away\r\nfrom thar, our lives war not worth a charge of powder. We soon made up\r\nour minds what we would do. We divided ourselves into two\r\nparties--four of us watchin’ the prairy, an’ the others keepin’ an eye\r\non the woods, to see that the varlets didn’t slip up behind us.\r\n\r\n“Wal, we didn’t see nothin’ out of the way all that day. Thar war that\r\nfeller peepin’ over the hill, an’ that war the only thing in the shape\r\nof a red-skin we could see; an’ we didn’t hear nothin’ neither, fur\r\nwhatever they done, they didn’t make noise enough to skeer a painter.\r\nAt last it come night, an’ it war ’bout the darkest night I ever\r\nsee--no moon, no stars--an’ then we began to prick up our ears. We all\r\nknowed that the time had come. You can easy tell what we war passin’\r\nthrough our minds. Thar warn’t no sich thing as a coward among us\r\neight fellers, but men in sich a scrape as that can’t help thinkin’,\r\nan’ I knowed that every one thar drawed a long breath when he thought\r\nof what he had got to do. I tell you, Dick, it war something none of\r\nus liked to do--leave one another in that way--men that you have\r\nhunted, an’ trapped, an’ fought Injuns with, an’ mebbe slept under the\r\nsame blanket with, an’ who have stuck to you through thick an’\r\nthin--sich fellers, I say, you don’t like to desart when they’re in\r\ndanger. But what else could we do? We war a’most out of powder an’\r\nlead, an’ the Injuns war more’n six to our one. You have been in sich\r\nscrapes, an’ in course know that thar warn’t but one way open to us.\r\n\r\n“Wal, as I was sayin’, as soon as it come fairly dark, the boys\r\ngathered ’round me, an’ waited to hear what I war goin’ to do. In\r\ncourse, I couldn’t advise ’em, ’cause it war every feller look out fur\r\nhimself, an’ the best men war them as was lucky enough to get away. So\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n“‘I’m goin’ to start now, boys. It’s high time we war movin’, cause if\r\nwe stay here half an hour longer, we’ll have them red-skins down on us\r\nin a lump. Thar’s somethin’ goin’ on, sartin. They don’t keep so still\r\nfur nothin’.’\r\n\r\n“Wal, we whispered the matter over, an’ finally settled it. The oldest\r\nman war to go fust; the next oldest, second; an’ so on; an’ that them\r\nas got away should draw a bee-line fur Fort Laramie, an’ get thar to\r\nonct, so that we might know who got off an’ who didn’t. We didn’t\r\nthink we should all get away. Some war sartin to go under; an’, Dick,\r\nwe didn’t forget to promise each other that those of us that lived\r\nwould never let a red Injun cross our trail. When every thing was\r\nsettled, I, bein’ the oldest man in the comp’ny, began to get ready\r\nfur the start. I put fresh primin’ in my rifle; seed that my knife and\r\ntomahawk war all right; then, arter shakin’ hands with all the boys,\r\nan’ wishin’ ’em good luck, I crawled away on my hands an’ knees. I\r\ndidn’t go back into the woods, but tuk to the edge of the prairy, an’\r\nfound the way cl’ar. Not an Injun did I hear. As fur seein’, you\r\ncouldn’t a told your mother, if she warn’t two foot from you; an’ in\r\n’bout half an hour I found myself on the banks of a leetle creek. How\r\nlong I lay thar, an’ how much of that water I drunk, I don’t know; but\r\nI thought water never tasted so good afore. Then I walked into the\r\ncreek, an’ had waded in it fur ’bout half a mile, when all to onct I\r\nheered a yellin’ an’ whoopin’, followed by the crack of rifles, an’\r\nthen I knowed that I hadn’t been fooled consarnin’ what the red-skins\r\nmeant to do. They had got what war left of our fellers surrounded, an’\r\nmade the rush. Fur a minit I stood thar in the water an’ listened. I\r\nheered a few shots made by our poor fellers, ’cause I can tell the\r\ncrack of a Missouri rifle as fur as I can hear it; an’ then one long,\r\nloud yell, told me that it war all over.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I laid round in them mountains fur more’n six weeks, starvin’\r\nfur grub an’ water, an’ listenin’ to the yellin’ varlets that war\r\nhuntin arter me; but I got back safe at last, arter walkin’ all the\r\nway from the Rocky Mountains to the fort, an’ thar I found Jack\r\nThomas. Me an’ him war the only ones that got out. When the Injuns got\r\nthem six fellers, they rubbed out nearly the last one of our comp’ny.\r\nMe an’ Jack war mighty down-hearted ’bout it, an’ it war a long time\r\nafore we could b’lieve that we war left alone. We didn’t feel then\r\nlike ever goin’ back to the mountains ag’in, ’cause we knowed it would\r\nbe lonesome thar. In course, we could easy have made up another\r\nexpedition, fur thar war plenty of hunters an’ trappers--good ones,\r\ntoo--hangin’ round the fort; but somehow we didn’t feel like goin’ off\r\nwith any one outside of our own comp’ny.\r\n\r\n“Wal, me an’ Jack laid round as long as we could stand it, an’ then we\r\ngot a couple of hosses, another new kit, an’ sot off ag’in. We didn’t\r\nthink it safe fur only two of us to try the Blackfoot country ag’in,\r\nso we struck for the huntin’ grounds on the Colorado. At that time\r\nthar war plenty of beaver in that river; so it didn’t take us long to\r\nfind a place that suited us; an’ we settled down, comfortable-like, to\r\nspend the winter. Fur three months we had plenty of sport, an’ the\r\nsight of our pile of furs, growin’ bigger an’ bigger every day, made\r\nus happy an’ contented. One mornin’ we sot out bright an’ ’arly, as\r\nusual, to ’tend to our bisness, takin’ different directions--fur my\r\ntraps war sot on the side of the mountain, an’ Jack had sot his’ne on\r\nthe banks of the creek that run through the valley. I had been gone\r\nfrum him but a short time, when I heered the crack of his rifle.\r\nSomehow, I knowed it war somethin’ ’sides a varmint he had shot at;\r\nan’ I warn’t fooled neither, for a minit arterward I heered another\r\ngun, an’ then afore I could think twice a Comanche yell come echoin’\r\nfrom the valley, tellin’ me plainer nor words that my chum war gone.\r\nAn Injun had watched one of his traps, an’ shot him as he come to it.\r\nI knowed it as sartin as if I had seed the hul thing done.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I warn’t in a fix kalkerlated to make a feller feel very\r\npleasant. I war three hundred miles from the nighest fort, in the very\r\nheart of the Comanche country, an’ in the dead of winter, with the\r\nsnow two foot deep on a level. But I didn’t stop to think of them\r\nthings then. My bisness war to get away from thar to onct. In course,\r\nI couldn’t go back arter my hoss or spelter, fur I didn’t know how\r\nmany Injuns thar war in the valley, nor whar they had hid themselves;\r\nso I shouldered my rifle an’ sot off on foot t’wards the prairy. A\r\nstorm that come up that night--an’ it snowed an’ blowed in a way that\r\nwarn’t a funny thing to look at--kivered up my trail; an’ if I war\r\never follered, I don’t know it.\r\n\r\n“I finally reached the fort, an’ I’ve been thar ever since. I’m an\r\nole chap now, Dick; but when I hunted an’ trapped with your ole man,\r\nwhen me an’ him warn’t bigger nor them two youngsters, an’ hadn’t\r\nhardly strength enough to shoulder a rifle, I never thought that I\r\nshould live to be the last of our comp’ny. In them days the prairy war\r\ndifferent from what it is now. It war afore the hoss-thieves an’\r\nrascals began to come in here to get away from the laws of the States;\r\nan’ them that called themselves trappers then war honest men, that\r\nnever did harm to a lone person on the prairy. But they’ve gone, one\r\narter the other, an’ only me an’ you are left.”\r\n\r\nAs the old trapper ceased speaking, he arose suddenly to his feet and\r\ndisappeared in the darkness, leaving Dick gazing thoughtfully into the\r\nfire. It was an hour before he returned, mounted on his horse, which\r\nhe picketed with the others. He then silently rolled himself up in his\r\nblanket and went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA Fight with the Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen setting out the next morning, Frank noticed that the wagons,\r\ninstead of starting off singly, and straggling, as they had formerly\r\ndone, kept close together, and traveled more rapidly. The trapper,\r\ntoo, instead of taking the lead, and getting in advance of the train,\r\nseemed satisfied to remain with the others. Upon inquiring the reason\r\nfor this, Dick replied:\r\n\r\n“You may find out afore night, youngster, that we are in a bad bit of\r\nInjun country. The train that went out afore us had a scrimmage here\r\nwith nigh five hundred of the red-skins, who stampeded some of their\r\nstock. So keep your eyes open, an’ if you see a Injun, let me know to\r\nonct.” The trapper said this with a broad grin, that was meant to\r\nimply that if they were attacked, the Indians would make their\r\nappearance before a person so inexperienced as Frank could be aware of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“The red-skins don’t gener’lly keer ’bout an out-an’-out fight,”\r\ncontinued the trapper, “’cause they don’t like these long rifles, an’\r\nthey know that these yere pioneers shoot mighty sharp. All the Injuns\r\nwant--or all they can get--is the stock; an’ they sometimes jump on to\r\na train afore a feller knows it, an’ yell an’ kick up a big fuss,\r\nwhich frightens the cattle. That’s what we call stampedin’ ’em. An’,\r\nyoungster, do you see that ’ar?”\r\n\r\nAs the trapper spoke, he pointed out over the prairie towards a little\r\nhill about two miles distant. After gazing for a few moments in the\r\ndirection indicated, Archie replied:\r\n\r\n“I see something that looks like a weed or a tuft of grass.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, that’s no weed,” said the trapper, with a laugh, “nor grass,\r\nneither. If it is, it’s on hossback, an’ carries a shootin’-iron or a\r\nbow an’ arrer. That’s a Injun, or I never seed one afore. What do you\r\nsay, Bob?” he asked, turning to the old trapper, who at this moment\r\ncame up.\r\n\r\n“I seed that five minutes ago,” was the reply, “an’ in course it can’t\r\nbe nothin’ but a red-skin.”\r\n\r\nThe boys gazed long and earnestly at the object, but their eyes were\r\nnot as sharp as those of the trappers, for they could not discover\r\nthat it bore any resemblance to an Indian, until Mr. Winters handed\r\nthem his field-glass through which he had been regarding the object\r\never since its discovery. Then they found that the trappers had not\r\nbeen deceived. It was a solitary Indian, who sat on his horse as\r\nmotionless as a statue, no doubt watching the train, and endeavoring\r\nto satisfy himself of the number of men there might be to defend it.\r\nIn his hand he carried something that looked like a spear adorned with\r\na tuft of feathers.\r\n\r\n“I wish the varlet was in good pluggin’ distance,” said Dick, patting\r\nhis rifle which lay across his knees. “If I could only get a bead on\r\nhim, he would never carry back to his fellers the news of what he has\r\nseed.”\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose there are more of them?” asked Archie, in a voice that\r\nwould tremble in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n“Sartin,” replied old Bob Kelly, who still rode beside the wagon;\r\n“thar’s more of ’em not fur off. This feller is a kind o’ spy like,\r\nan’ when he has seen exactly how things stand, he’ll go back an’ tell\r\nthe rest of ’em, an’ the fust thing we know, they’ll be down on us\r\nlike a hawk on a June-bug. But they’ll ketch a weasel, _they_ will,\r\nwhen they pitch into us. Dick, when they do come, don’t forget Bill\r\nLawson.”\r\n\r\nThe trapper turned his head, for a moment, as if to hide the emotion\r\nhe felt, at the mention of the name of his departed companion, but\r\npresently replied:\r\n\r\n“This aint the fust time that you an’ me have been in jest sich\r\nscrapes, Bob, an’ it aint likely that we’ll soon forget that we owe\r\nthe varlets a long settlement. Thar aint as many of us now as thar\r\nused to be; more’n one good trapper has had his har raised by them\r\nsame red-skins--fur I know a Cheyenne as fur as I kin see him,\r\nyoungsters--an’ mebbe one o’ these days, when some one asks, ‘What’s\r\ncome on ole Bob Kelly an’ Dick Lewis?’ the answer will be, ‘Killed by\r\nthe Injuns!’”\r\n\r\nIt may be readily supposed that such conversation as this was not\r\ncalculated to quiet the feelings of Frank and Archie--who had been\r\nconsiderably agitated by the information that there was a body of\r\nhostile Indians at no great distance--and to their excited\r\nimaginations the danger appeared tenfold worse than it really was. At\r\nthat day, as the trapper had remarked, it was a very uncommon\r\noccurrence for a large train to be engaged in a regular fight with the\r\nIndians, for the latter had learned to their cost that the pioneers\r\nwere always well armed, and that there were some among them who\r\nunderstood Indian fighting. They generally contented themselves with\r\nsudden and rapid raids upon the stock of the emigrants, and they\r\nseldom departed empty-handed. But it is not to be wondered that the\r\ntrappers, who had participated in numberless engagements with the\r\nsavages, and witnessed deeds of cruelty that had awakened in them a\r\ndesire for vengeance, should delight to talk over their experience.\r\nThe boys, although considerably frightened, were still greatly\r\nencouraged by their example. Dick twisted uneasily on his seat, as\r\nthough impatient for the fight to begin, now and then looking toward\r\nthe spy, as if he had half a mind to venture a shot at him; while old\r\nBob Kelly rode along, smoking his pipe, apparently as unconcerned as\r\nthough there was not a hostile Indian within a hundred miles of them.\r\nMr. Winters evidently partook of the old man’s indifference, for,\r\nafter satisfying himself that his weapons were in readiness, he drew\r\nback beside his nephews, and said, with a smile:\r\n\r\n“Well, boys, you may have an opportunity to try your skill on big game\r\nnow. This will be a little different from the fight you had in the\r\nwoods with those Indians who stole your traps. Then you had the force\r\non your side; now the savages are the stronger party. But there’s no\r\ndanger,” he added, quickly seeing that the boys looked rather anxious;\r\n“every man in the train is a good shot, and the most of them have been\r\nin Indian fights before. I don’t believe all the red-skins on the\r\nprairie could whip us while we have Dick and Bob with us.”\r\n\r\nThe boys themselves had great confidence in the trappers--especially\r\nDick, who, they knew, would never desert them. But even _he_ had\r\nseveral times been worsted by the Indians. Frank thought of the story\r\nof the lost wagon train. But then he remembered that the reason that\r\ntrain was captured, was because the emigrants had not “stood up to the\r\nmark like men.”\r\n\r\nAll this while the train had been moving ahead at a rapid pace, and\r\nmany an anxious eye was directed toward the solitary Indian, who\r\nremained standing where he was first discovered until the wagons had\r\npassed, when he suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. All that day\r\nthe emigrants rode with their weapons in their hands, in readiness to\r\nrepel an attack; and when they halted at noon, guards were posted\r\nabout the camp, and the cattle were kept close to the wagons. But,\r\nalthough now and then a single Indian would be seen upon one of the\r\ndistant swells, the main body kept out of sight; and the boys began to\r\nhope that the train was considered too large to be successfully\r\nattacked. At night old Bob Kelly selected the place for the\r\nencampment, which was made according to his directions. The wagons\r\nwere drawn up in a circle to form a breastwork, and the cattle were\r\npicketed close by under the protection of a strong guard. Fires were\r\nbuilt, and preparations for supper carried on as usual, for, of\r\ncourse, all attempts at concealment would have been time and labor\r\nthrown away. As soon as it began to grow dark, the cattle were secured\r\nto the wagons by long stout ropes, which, while they allowed the\r\nanimals to graze, effectually prevented escape. Then guards were\r\nselected, and the emigrants made every preparation to give the savages\r\na warm reception, in case they should make a dash upon the camp. No\r\none thought of his blanket. The idea of going to sleep while a band of\r\nIndians was hovering about, watching their opportunity to pounce down\r\nupon them, was out of the question. The two trappers, after satisfying\r\nthemselves that every thing was in readiness for an attack, began to\r\nstation the guards. Frank again thought of the story Dick had related\r\nof the lost wagon train, and, desiring to witness an exhibition of the\r\nskill that had enabled him to detect the presence of the Indians on\r\nthat occasion, proposed to Archie that they should stand guard with\r\nhim. The latter, who always felt safe when in the company of their\r\nguide, agreed; and when the trapper started off with the guards, he\r\nwas surprised to find the boys at his side.\r\n\r\n“Whar are you goin’?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“We want to stand guard with you!” replied Frank.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I never _did_ see sich keerless fellers as you be,” said the\r\ntrapper. “You get wusser an’ wusser. Much you don’t know about this\r\nbisness. I guess you had better stay here whar you’re safe.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, wal!” said old Bob Kelly, who was not a little astonished at the\r\nrequest the boys had made, “they’ve got the real grit in ’em, that’s a\r\nfact, if they are green as punkins in Injun fightin’. A few year on\r\nthe prairy would make ’em as good as me or you, Dick Lewis. But you’ll\r\nget enough of Injuns afore you see daylight ag’in, youngsters. So you\r\nhad better stay here.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he shouldered his rifle, and, followed by the guards,\r\ndisappeared in the darkness. The boys reluctantly returned to their\r\nwagon, where they found Uncle James, seated on the ground, whistling\r\nsoftly to himself, and apparently indifferent as to the course the\r\nIndians might see fit to adopt. But still he had not neglected to make\r\npreparations to receive them, for his rifle stood leaning against one\r\nof the wheels of the wagon, and he carried his revolvers in his belt.\r\nThe boys silently seated themselves on the ground beside him, and\r\nawaited the issue of events with their feelings worked up to the\r\nhighest pitch of excitement. The fires had burned low, but still\r\nthere was light sufficient to enable them to discover the emigrants\r\nstretched on the ground about the wagons, talking to one another in\r\nwhispers, as if almost afraid to break the stillness that brooded over\r\nthe camp, and which was interrupted only by the barking of the prairie\r\nwolves, and the neighing and tramping of the horses. Two hours were\r\npassed in this way, when suddenly the sharp report of a rifle,\r\naccompanied by a terrific yell, rang out on the air, causing the\r\nemigrants to grasp their weapons and spring to their feet in alarm.\r\nFor an instant all was silent again. The stillness was so deep that\r\nFrank thought the camp was suddenly deserted. Then a long drawn out\r\nwhoop arose from the prairie, followed by a chorus of yells that\r\nstruck terror to more than one heart in that wagon train. Then came a\r\nclatter of horses’ hoofs; the yells grew louder and louder; and the\r\nboys knew that the Indians were coming toward them. The emigrants\r\nrushed to the wagons, and the next moment the savages swept by. The\r\nboys saw a confused mass of rapidly-moving horsemen; heard the most\r\nterrific yells, the report of fire-arms, and the struggles of the\r\nfrightened cattle as they attempted to escape, and then all was over.\r\nThe Indians departed as rapidly as they had come, and the boys,\r\nbewildered by the noise, had not fired a shot. On the contrary, they\r\nstood holding their rifles in their hands, as if they had suddenly\r\nforgotten how to use them. Uncle James, however, was not confused. He\r\nhad heard the war-whoop before, and as he came out from behind the\r\nwagon, he began to reload one of his revolvers, remarking as he did\r\nso:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“There are some less in that band, I know.”\r\n\r\n“Did you shoot?” asked Archie, drawing a long breath of relief to know\r\nthat the danger was past. “Why, I didn’t have time to fire a shot.”\r\n\r\n“That’s because you were frightened,” replied Mr. Winters. “You see I\r\nhave been in skirmishes like this before, and their yells don’t make\r\nme nervous. I had five good shots at them, and I don’t often miss.”\r\n\r\n“I say, youngsters, are you all right?” exclaimed Dick, who at this\r\nmoment came up. “See here! I’ve got two fellers’ top-knots. Bless you,\r\nthey aint scalps,” he continued, as the boys drew back. “They’re only\r\nthe feathers the Injuns wear in their har. I don’t scalp Cheyennes,\r\n’cause I don’t keer ’bout ’em. I make war on ’em ’cause it’s natur.\r\nBut when I knock over a Comanche, I take his har jest to ’member ole\r\nBill by. But, youngsters, warn’t that jolly! I haven’t heered a Injun\r\nyell fur more’n a year, an it makes me feel to hum. You can take these\r\nfeathers, an’ when you get back to Lawrence, tell the folks thar that\r\nthe Injuns that wore ’em onct attacked the train you belonged to.”\r\n\r\nThe emigrants’ first care, after having satisfied themselves that the\r\nIndians had gone, was to count their stock; and more than one had to\r\nmourn the loss of a favorite horse or mule, which had escaped and gone\r\noff with the Indians. Mr. Winters, however, had lost nothing--the\r\ntrapper having tied the animals so securely that escape was\r\nimpossible. Not a person in the train was injured--the only damage\r\nsustained being in the canvas covers of the wagons, which were riddled\r\nwith bullets and arrows.\r\n\r\nThe boys were still far from feeling safe, and probably would not have\r\ngone to bed that night had they not seen the trappers spreading their\r\nblankets near the wagon. This re-assured them, for those men never\r\nwould have thought of rest if there had been the least probability\r\nthat the Indians would return. So the boys took their beds out of the\r\nwagon and placed them beside those of Dick and his companion, who were\r\ntalking over the events of the night.\r\n\r\n“This bisness of fightin’ Injuns, youngsters,” said the former, “is\r\none that aint larnt out of books, nor in the woods about Lawrence. If\r\nyou had a-been with us, you would a seed that. Now, when I fust went\r\nout thar, you couldn’t ’a’ told that thar war a red-skin on the\r\nprairy. But I laid my ear to the ground, an’ purty quick I heerd a\r\nrumblin’ like, an’ I knowed the noise war made by hosses. Arter that,\r\nI heerd a rustlin’ in the grass, an’ seed a Injun sneakin’ along, easy\r\nlike, t’wards the camp. So I drawed up my ole shootin’ iron, an’ done\r\nthe bisness fur him, an’ then started fur the camp, loadin’ my rifle\r\nas I ran. In course the Injuns seed then that it warn’t no use to go\r\na-foolin’ with us, so they all set up a yell, an’ here they come. I\r\ndodged under the wagon, an’ as they went by, I give ’em another shot,\r\nan’ seed a red-skin go off dead.”\r\n\r\n“Go off dead!” repeated Frank. “How could he go off when he was dead?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said the trapper, with a laugh, in which he was joined by old\r\nBob Kelly, “every one of them Injuns war tied fast to his hoss, so\r\nthat if he war killed he wouldn’t fall off; an’, in course, his hoss\r\nwould keep on with the rest, an’ carry him away. I seed more’n one\r\nInjun go off dead to-night, an’ the way I come to get them feathers,\r\nb’longin’ to them two chaps, war, that somebody had shot their hosses.\r\nI seed ’em on the ground, tryin’ to cut themselves loose from their\r\nsaddles, so I run up an’ settled ’em. That war four I rubbed out.\r\nGood-night, youngsters. You needn’t be afraid, ’cause they won’t come\r\nback again to-night.”\r\n\r\nAs the trapper spoke, he placed his cap under his head for a pillow,\r\nre-arranged his blanket, and was soon in a sound sleep.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two weeks nothing occurred to relieve the monotony of\r\nthe journey. The train took up its line of march at daylight, halted\r\nat noon for an hour or two, and shortly after sunset encamped for the\r\nnight. The fight with the Indians had not driven all thoughts of the\r\nantelopes out of the boys’ minds. And while the train journeyed along\r\nthe road, they scoured the prairie, in search of the wished-for game.\r\nThe appearance of the “sea of grass,” which stretched away on all\r\nsides, as far as their eyes could reach, not a little surprised them.\r\nInstead of the perfectly level plain they had expected to see, the\r\nsurface of the prairie was broken by gentle swells, like immense waves\r\nof the ocean, and here and there--sometimes two or three days’ journey\r\napart--were small patches of woods, called “oak openings.”\r\n\r\nOne night they made their camp in sight of the Rocky Mountains. While\r\nthe trapper was cooking their supper, he said to the boys, who had\r\nthrown themselves on the ground near the wagon:\r\n\r\n“It aint fur from here that me an’ ole Bill Lawson lost that wagon\r\ntrain. I never travel along here that I don’t think of that night, an’\r\nI sometimes feel my cap rise on my head, jest as it did when them\r\nInjuns come pourin’ into the camp. But the varlets have been pushed\r\nback further an’ further, an’ now a feller’s as safe here as he would\r\nbe in Fort Laramie. The ole bar’s hole aint more’n fifty mile from\r\nhere, an’ if your uncle don’t mind the ride, I should like to show you\r\nthe cave that has so often sarved me fur a hidin’-place.”\r\n\r\nThe boys looked toward Mr. Winters, who, having frequently heard the\r\nguide speak of the “ole bar’s hole,” felt some curiosity to see it.\r\nSo, after being assured by both the trappers that there was no danger\r\nto be apprehended, he gave his consent, remarking:\r\n\r\n“We are in no hurry. I don’t suppose there is any possibility of being\r\nlost so long as we have Dick and Bob for guides; so we will go there,\r\nand take a week’s rest and a hunt.”\r\n\r\nThe boys were delighted, and the next morning, when the train resumed\r\nits journey, the emigrants were not a little surprised to see Mr.\r\nWinters’ wagon moving off by itself.\r\n\r\nThat night, when our travelers encamped, they were thirty miles from\r\nthe train, and about the same distance from the “ole bar’s hole.” The\r\nmountains were plainly visible, and the boys could scarcely believe\r\nthat they were nearly a day’s journey distant. They were certain that\r\na ride of an hour or two would bring them to the willows that skirted\r\ntheir base.\r\n\r\n“’T aint the fust time I’ve seed fellers fooled ’bout sich things,”\r\nsaid Dick. “Do you see that ’ar high peak?” he continued, pointing to\r\na single mountain that rose high above the others. “Wal, thar’s whar\r\nthe ole bar’s hole is. If we reach it afore dark to-morrer night, I’ll\r\nagree to set you down in Sacramento in two weeks.”\r\n\r\nThe boys were still far from being convinced, and they went to sleep\r\nthat night fully believing that they would reach the mountains by noon\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nLost on the Prairie.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, by the time the sun had risen, the travelers had\r\neaten their breakfast, and were again on the move. The entire party\r\nwas in high spirits. The trappers laughed and joked with each other,\r\nand pointed out to Mr. Winters the familiar objects that met their eye\r\non every side, while the boys galloped on before, and in a few moments\r\nhad left the wagon far behind. Their horses were in excellent trim,\r\nand bounded along over the prairie as if some of their riders’ spirits\r\nhad been infused into them.\r\n\r\n“I say, Frank,” said Archie, at length, suddenly drawing in his rein,\r\n“what if Dick was mistaken about the Indians all being gone, and a\r\nparty of Comanches should suddenly pounce down on us? Wouldn’t we be\r\nin a fix? I declare, I see an Indian now,” he added; and, as he\r\nspoke, he pointed toward an object that could be dimly seen moving\r\nalong the summit of a distant swell.\r\n\r\n“That’s something, that’s a fact,” said Frank, gazing in the direction\r\nindicated; “but it don’t look like that Indian we saw the other day.\r\nIf it was a Comanche, he wouldn’t move about and show himself so\r\nplainly. There’s another--and another,” he continued, as several more\r\nobjects came over the brow of the hill. “Let us ride up a little\r\nnearer. If they are Indians, we can easily reach the wagon before they\r\ncan overtake us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, come on,” said Archie. “If we should get into a fight all by\r\nourselves, and come safely out of it, it would be something to talk\r\nabout, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\nThe boys rode cautiously toward the objects, which were still\r\nincreasing in number, holding themselves in readiness to beat a hasty\r\nretreat in case they should prove to be Indians, until they had gone\r\nabout half a mile, when Frank suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“They are antelopes!”\r\n\r\n“Are they?” asked Archie, excitedly. “Let’s shoot one of ’em,” and,\r\nspringing from his saddle, he began to unbuckle his halter and hobble\r\nhis horse, as he had seen the trapper do on a former occasion.\r\n\r\nFrank followed his example, and then, securing their rifles, they\r\nthrew themselves on their hands and knees, and began to crawl toward\r\nthe game, which was fully a mile and a half distant. But that was no\r\nobstacle to the boys then. They would willingly have gone twice that\r\nfar to have a shot at an antelope, if for nothing more than to show\r\nthe trapper that they were better hunters than he had supposed. It is\r\ntrue they did not expect to succeed, but the name “antelope killers”\r\nwas well worth trying for, and they determined to do their best. They\r\ncrawled along slowly and as carefully as possible, pausing now and\r\nthen to look over the grass at the animals, which, to their delight,\r\nthey found were feeding directly toward them.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it is safe to go much further,” said Frank, after they\r\nhad crawled nearly half the distance in this manner. “Let’s stop and\r\nsee what we can do.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Archie. “If you will hold up your handkerchief on your\r\nramrod, I’ll try and shoot one of them, if they come near enough.”\r\n\r\nFrank, in compliance with his cousin’s suggestion, drew his ramrod\r\nfrom his gun, fastened his handkerchief to it, and, throwing himself\r\nupon his back, carefully raised it above the grass. While in this\r\nposition he could not, of course, see the movements of the game; but\r\nArchie kept vigilant watch, and at length whispered:\r\n\r\n“They see it! They’re coming!”\r\n\r\nThe animals had, in reality, caught sight of the handkerchief, and,\r\nafter regarding it for a few moments, they began to approach it--a\r\nfine large buck leading the way.\r\n\r\nNow the boys knew that the hunt began in earnest. The least awkward\r\nmovement on their part--the exposure of the smallest portion of their\r\nbodies, or the slightest noise in the grass--might, as Archie\r\nexpressed it, “knock the whole thing in the head.” Frank lay perfectly\r\nquiet, watching the movements of his cousin; and he could tell, by the\r\nexpression of his countenance, pretty near what the game was doing.\r\nWhen the antelopes stopped--which they did every few feet--Archie put\r\non an exceedingly long face, as if fearful that they were about to\r\nturn and run; and when they approached, the fact would be indicated by\r\na broad grin and a nervous twitching at the lock of his gun. For\r\nfully half an hour--it seemed much longer to the impatient boys--they\r\nremained in their place of concealment; but at length their patience\r\nwas rewarded, for the game was within easy rifle range. In an instant\r\nArchie’s nervousness all vanished, and Frank almost held his breath\r\nwhen he saw him slowly, inch by inch, raise his gun to his shoulder.\r\nHe took a long, steady aim, pulled the trigger, and sprung from the\r\nground, shouting:\r\n\r\n“I’ve got him! I’ve got him!”\r\n\r\nFrank was on his feet almost as soon as his cousin, and, to his\r\ndelight, saw the leader of the antelopes struggling on the ground,\r\nwhile the rest of the herd were scampering away at the top of their\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n“What will Dick and Bob say now?” exclaimed Archie, who skipped about\r\nas though he were almost beside himself. “What will they--hold\r\non--hold on--shoot him, Frank!” he shouted. “We’re going to lose him\r\nafter all.”\r\n\r\nArchie’s shot had not been fatal. The buck was only disabled for a\r\nmoment, and, after a few struggles, he succeeded in regaining his\r\nfeet, and started to run. Had his cousin been as excited as he was,\r\nthey certainly would have had all their trouble for nothing, for\r\nArchie, instead of stopping to reload, dropped his gun and started in\r\npursuit of the wounded animal, which--although he ran but slowly--was\r\nfast leaving him behind, when Frank, by an excellent shot, again\r\nbrought him to the ground. This time the wound was fatal; but Archie,\r\nto put all further attempts at escape out of the question, ran up and\r\nseized the buck by the horns.\r\n\r\n“He’s done for now,” said Frank, as he proceeded to reload his rifle;\r\n“I shot him through the head.”\r\n\r\n“I see you did,” replied his cousin, still retaining his hold upon the\r\nantelope; “but there’s no knowing what he might do. I wouldn’t trust\r\nhim.” And it was not until he had turned the deer over several times,\r\nand fully satisfied himself that he had ceased to breathe, that Archie\r\nreleased him.\r\n\r\n“What will Dick and Bob say now?” he continued, as Frank came up, and\r\nthey began to examine their prize, which was much larger than the one\r\nthe trapper had killed. “You know they said we couldn’t shoot an\r\nantelope. Now, the next thing is to get him back to the wagon. He’s\r\ntoo heavy for us to carry, so if you’ll stay here, and watch him and\r\nkeep the wolves off, I’ll go back and get the horses.”\r\n\r\nFrank agreed to this arrangement, and Archie, after he had found and\r\nreloaded his gun, started off after the horses. He was gone almost two\r\nhours--so long that Frank began to be uneasy; but at length he\r\nappeared, riding post-haste over a neighboring swell, mounted on\r\nSleepy Sam, and leading Pete by the bridle. As soon as he came within\r\nspeaking distance, he exclaimed, with blanched cheeks:\r\n\r\n“Frank, we’re lost! I can’t see the wagon any where.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be uneasy,” replied his cousin, who, although thoroughly\r\nalarmed by this announcement, appeared to be perfectly unconcerned.\r\n“Don’t be uneasy.”\r\n\r\n“But I haven’t seen the wagon since we left it this morning,”\r\npersisted Archie. “I thought it was close behind us. I tell you we’re\r\nlost.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no, I guess not,” answered Frank, as he lifted the antelope from\r\nthe ground and placed it on the saddle before his cousin. “The wagon\r\nis no doubt behind some of these hills. Besides, Uncle James won’t be\r\nlong in hunting us up.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t stay alone on the prairie to-night for any thing,” said\r\nArchie. “I know it wouldn’t be the first time I have camped out, but\r\nthen there are no wild Indians in the woods about Lawrence.”\r\n\r\nFrank had by this time mounted his horse, and together they set out at\r\na rapid gallop to find the wagon. The mountain which Dick had pointed\r\nout the night before was plainly visible, and the boys determined to\r\ntravel toward it with all possible speed, in hopes that they would\r\novertake their friends before they halted for the night. Frank thought\r\nthe wagon could not be far off, and every hill they mounted he gazed\r\nabout him as if fully expecting to discover it; but, after riding an\r\nhour without seeing any signs of it, he began to be a good deal of his\r\ncousin’s opinion, that they were lost. But he made no remark, for he\r\nknew that a good deal depended upon keeping up Archie’s courage.\r\n\r\n“We have not been gone from the wagon three hours,” said he, “and they\r\nhaven’t had time to get very far away from us. We’ll find them behind\r\nsome of these swells. Perhaps we’ll be in time to give them a piece of\r\nour antelope for dinner.”\r\n\r\nArchie made no reply, for he derived no encouragement from this; but\r\nhe silently followed his cousin, who led the way at a rapid gallop,\r\nriding over this swell, and turning round that, as though he was\r\nperfectly familiar with the ground over which they were traveling. For\r\ntwo long hours they kept on in this way, almost without speaking, each\r\ntime they mounted a hill straining their eyes in every direction, in\r\nthe hope of discovering the wagon. Sometimes they were almost certain\r\nthey saw its white cover in the distance; but upon taking a second\r\nlook, it proved to have been merely a creation of their imagination;\r\nand Frank began to be discouraged. To add to their discomfort, the\r\nheat was almost intolerable, and they began to be tortured with\r\nthirst. Their animals also appeared to be suffering, for they paid\r\nless attention to the spur, and were constantly jerking at the reins,\r\nand endeavoring to go in a direction almost contrary to that which the\r\nboys desired. The hours seemed lengthened into ages, and at three\r\no’clock in the afternoon they had seen no signs of the wagon, and the\r\nmountains appeared to be as far off as ever.\r\n\r\n“There’s no use talking,” said Archie, at length, reining in his\r\nhorse, “I can’t stand this any longer, I’m so thirsty.”\r\n\r\n“But what else can we do?” asked Frank, in a husky voice, for his\r\ntongue was so parched that he could scarcely talk plainly. “We can’t\r\nfind our friends, or water either, by staying here. We _must_ go on.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he again spurred his horse into a gallop, Archie, as\r\nbefore, following after him, now and then looking down at the\r\nantelope, which lay across his saddle--and which he considered to be\r\nthe cause of all their trouble--as though he heartily wished him safe\r\namong the others of the herd. Two miles more were passed, but still no\r\nsigns of water. The idea of finding the wagon had now given away to a\r\ndesire to discover some stream where they might quench their thirst,\r\nwhich was becoming almost unbearable. But the dry, parched prairie\r\nstretched away on each side of them, while in front loomed the\r\nmountains, apparently as distant as when they started in the morning.\r\nTheir horses grew more and more restive. Upon applying the spur, they\r\nwould gallop for a few yards, and then settle down into a slow walk,\r\nturning their heads and pulling at the reins as if anxious to go in a\r\ncontrary direction. This set Frank to thinking. He had often read of\r\nthe remarkable sagacity sometimes displayed by the horse--how the\r\nanimal had been known to carry his lost rider safely into the midst of\r\nhis friends--and, turning to his cousin, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Archie, I’m going to let Pete take his own course. Both the horses\r\nwant to go back, so let’s see where they will take us to. We can’t be\r\nin a much worse fix than we are now.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he threw the reins on his horse’s neck, and the animal,\r\nfinding himself at liberty, at once turned, and, pricking up his ears,\r\ngalloped off exactly at right angles with the course they had been\r\npursuing. Archie, too dispirited to raise any objections, followed his\r\ncousin’s example, and the old buffalo hunter, which, during the last\r\ntwo hours, had traveled with his head down, as if scarcely able to\r\ntake another step, snuffed the air and bounded off at a rapid pace.\r\nFor an hour the animals tore along at a tremendous rate; but\r\ndiscovering no signs of the wagon, Frank was rapidly losing faith in\r\nthe sagacity of his horse, when, as they came suddenly around the base\r\nof a swell, they found before them a long line of willows. Toward this\r\nthe animals made their way with increased speed, carrying their riders\r\nthrough the trees into a stream of clear, running water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe Trapper’s Reminiscence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horses did not stop on the bank, but, in spite of the desperate\r\nefforts of the boys, kept on, until the water reached half way to\r\ntheir backs. The old buffalo hunter, not satisfied with this,\r\npersisted in lying down; and Archie and the antelope were deposited in\r\nthe middle of the stream. Under any other circumstances, the young\r\nhunter would have been angry; but, as it was, the cool bath was most\r\nrefreshing after his long ride over the dry prairie, under the hot,\r\nscorching sun; so seizing the antelope, he dragged him to the shore,\r\nleaving his horse to take care of himself.\r\n\r\nThirsty as the boys were, they still retained their presence of mind;\r\ninstead of endangering his life by drinking freely of the water,\r\nArchie contented himself with repeatedly bathing his head, while\r\nFrank, who was still in his saddle, reached down and scooped up a few\r\ndrops in his hand.\r\n\r\n“I say, Frank, isn’t this glorious?” said Archie at length, as he\r\ndivested himself of his coat, which he hung upon a limb to dry. “But\r\nit’s lucky that my ammunition is water-proof. If you had been in my\r\nfix, you wouldn’t be able to do much more shooting until we got back\r\nto our wagon. I declare, it’s getting dark. Where do you suppose that\r\nwagon is? If we don’t find it inside of fifteen minutes, we shall have\r\nto camp.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s stay here,” said Frank, as he rode his horse out of the water,\r\nand fastened him to a tree. “We must stay somewhere all night, and\r\nthis is as good a camping-ground as we can find.”\r\n\r\n“If Dick or Bob was here,” said Archie, “I wouldn’t mind it; but I\r\ndon’t like the idea of our staying here alone. This is the worst\r\nscrape I was ever in; but if I once get along-side of that wagon\r\nagain, I’ll stay there.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’ve been in worse scrapes than this,” said Frank, who saw that\r\nhis cousin was losing heart again.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to know when and where?” said Archie, looking up in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“Why, you were in a much more dangerous situation while you were\r\nhanging by that limb, fifty feet from the ground, when you were after\r\nthat ’coon that led you such a long chase.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t see it,” replied Archie. “I knew that if I got down safe, I\r\nwould be among friends, and if I had to camp in the woods there would\r\nbe no Comanches or grizzly bears waiting for a chance to jump down on\r\nme. I say, Frank, there _may_ be grizzly bears about here,” and Archie\r\npeered through the trees, reaching rather hurriedly for his gun, as if\r\nfully expecting to see one of those ferocious animals advancing upon\r\nhim. “But what are you about?” he continued, as he saw Frank removing\r\nthe saddle from his horse.\r\n\r\n“I’m getting ready to camp,” replied Frank, coolly.\r\n\r\nArchie at first strongly objected to this, but Frank finally carried\r\nthe day, by assuring him that it was the much better plan to “take\r\nmatters easy,” and wait for daylight, when they would again set out.\r\nBesides, if they traveled in the dark, they might go miles out of\r\ntheir way. Archie, although not convinced, finally agreed to his\r\ncousin’s proposition, remarking:\r\n\r\n“If you were in the fourth story of a burning house, I wonder if you\r\nwouldn’t talk of taking matters easy?”\r\n\r\nIt was settled then that they should remain where they were for the\r\nnight, and they began to make preparations accordingly. Archie’s horse\r\nwas relieved of the saddle, and, after both the animals had been led\r\non to the prairie, they were hobbled and left to graze. Frank then\r\nbegan to skin and dress the buck, while Archie gathered a supply of\r\nwood, and kindled a fire. In half an hour several slices of venison\r\nwere broiling on the coals, and the boys were lying before the fire,\r\ntalking over the events of the day, and wondering what Dick and Bob\r\nwould say when they learned that their “youngsters” had killed an\r\nantelope, when they were startled by a well-known bark, and the next\r\nmoment Useless came bounding through the trees into the very center of\r\nthe camp, where he frisked and jumped about with every demonstration\r\nof joy. The boys had scarcely recovered from their alarm, when they\r\nheard a familiar voice exclaim:\r\n\r\n“Bar an’ buffaler! You keerless fellers!” and the trapper came\r\nthrough the willows with long, impatient strides.\r\n\r\nThe boys were always glad to see Dick, but words are too feeble to\r\nexpress the joy they felt at his sudden and wholly unexpected\r\nappearance. For a moment they seemed to have lost the power of speech.\r\n\r\nThe trapper glanced hastily from one to the other, took in at a glance\r\nthe preparations for the night, and, dropping the butt of his rifle\r\nheavily to the ground, again ejaculated:\r\n\r\n“You keerless fellers!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, Dick?” asked Archie, whose spirits were now as\r\nexalted as they had before been depressed. “We’re all right. Sit down\r\nand have some supper.”\r\n\r\n“Youngsters,” said the trapper, seating himself on the ground, and\r\ndepositing his rifle beside him, “I jest knowed I would find you all\r\nright. Now, tell me whar have you been, an’ what a doin’?”\r\n\r\n“Do you see that?” exclaimed Archie, jumping up and pointing to the\r\nremains of the antelope, which Frank had hung up on a tree. “Do you\r\nsee it? You said we couldn’t kill a prong-horn, but we’ve done it.”\r\n\r\nThe boys then proceeded to recount their adventures, telling the\r\ntrapper how they had killed the antelope, of their long ride under the\r\nscorching sun, and how at last their horses had brought them to the\r\nwater--to all of which the trapper listened with amazement, and\r\nfeelings of admiration that he could not disguise.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, when they had concluded, “I won’t tell you to try it\r\nover ag’in, ’cause you can’t allers be so lucky.”\r\n\r\n“What did uncle say?” inquired Archie, who was rather apprehensive of\r\na “lecture.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he knowed as how thar war no Injuns to massacre you, an’ when we\r\ncamped fur noon, I heered him say, ‘I wonder what the boys have got\r\nfur dinner?’ I knowed me and Useless could easy find you. That ar dog\r\nknowed jest as well that I war arter you as I did myself.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Frank, “whenever you get ready, we’ll go back to the\r\ncamp.”\r\n\r\n“To camp!” repeated the trapper. “Haint you rid fur enough yet? Can\r\nyou stand twenty miles more to-night?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty miles!” echoed both the boys, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Sartin! You’re further away from the ole bar’s hole now than you were\r\nlast night.”\r\n\r\nThe young hunters were astonished. Although they had had the Rocky\r\nMountains for a guidepost, they had been completely turned round, and\r\nhad actually traveled ten miles back toward St. Joseph.\r\n\r\n“That’s what comes of not knowin’ nothin’ ’bout the prairy!” continued\r\nthe trapper, helping himself to a piece of the venison. “But we’ll\r\nstay here to-night, an’ strike fur camp in the mornin’.”\r\n\r\nThe boys were very well satisfied with this arrangement, for their\r\nlong ride had wearied them, and Archie was willing to brave grizzly\r\nbears, so long as he was in Dick’s company.\r\n\r\nAfter supper--which consisted of venison, without bread or coffee--the\r\ntrapper lighted his pipe with a brand from the fire, and, settling\r\nback on his elbow, said:\r\n\r\n“I’ve seed the time, youngsters, when it wouldn’t a been healthy fur\r\nyou two fellers to be out here alone. I’ve seed that prairy a’most\r\nblack with Comanches, an’ have heered ’em yellin’ among these ere very\r\nwillows. If you had been settin’ whar you are now ’bout fifteen year\r\nago, you would have seed me goin’ through these trees, an’ swimmin’\r\nthat ar creek, with a hul tribe of yellin’ an’ screechin’ red-skins\r\nclost to my heels. I showed your uncle, this mornin’, the very place\r\nwhar I onct run the gauntlet of more’n a hundred Comanches. I tell\r\nyou, youngsters, I know every foot of this ground. Many a time me an’\r\npoor ole Bill Lawson have skrimmaged with the Injuns through here,\r\nwhen it war more’n a feller’s har war wuth to come to this creek arter\r\na drink o’ water. But I told you ’bout runnin’ the gauntlet. The way\r\nit happened war this:\r\n\r\n“’Bout fifteen year ago, me an’ ole Bill Lawson war trappin’ among the\r\nmountains, twenty-five miles from the ole bar’s hole. We, in course,\r\nhad fine sport, ’cause me an’ ole Bill allers knowed whar to go to\r\nfind the best trappin’ grounds; an’, by the time spring opened, we had\r\nas much spelter as we could tote away on our backs. It war gettin’\r\npurty nigh time fur the Comanches to come round on their spring hunt,\r\nan’ we began to talk of leavin’; but thar war plenty of beaver left in\r\nthe valley, an’ we didn’t like to go so long as thar war any game to\r\ntrap, so we kept puttin’ it off, an’ when at last we did start, it\r\nwar too late to get off with our plunder.\r\n\r\n“One mornin’, jest at daylight, while I war in front of the shantee\r\ncookin’ my breakfast, ole Bill come in from ’tendin’ to his traps, an’\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“‘Dick, the valley’s chuck full o’ red-skins. I jest seed more sign\r\ndown by the creek than I ever seed afore ’bout this place, an’ that’s\r\nsayin’ a good deal. We had better shoulder our spelter an’ be off to\r\nonct.’\r\n\r\n“I didn’t stop to think any more ’bout breakfast jest then, but I ran\r\ninto the shantee, grabbed my furs, which I allers kept tied up ready\r\nfor a move, an’ me an’ ole Bill started out. The Injuns must have come\r\nin durin’ the night, ’cause the day afore thar warn’t a bit of sign to\r\nbe seed fur ten miles ’round the valley. But we didn’t stop then to\r\nthink how or when they got in, but how should we get out. It warn’t no\r\neasy thing to do, youngsters--to go through them mountains, swarmin’\r\nwith red-skins. They don’t walk through the woods like a feller does\r\nwhen he’s squirrel huntin’, but they go sneakin’ round, an’ listenin’,\r\nan’ peepin’; an’ if a chap don’t understand their natur, he’d better\r\nnot go among ’em.\r\n\r\n“Wal, ole Bill led the way, sometimes a’most on his knees, his rifle\r\nin his hand, an’ his bundle of furs on his shoulder, I followin’ clost\r\nat his heels--both of us keepin’ our eyes open, an’ stoppin’ now an’\r\nthen to listen. We had made ’bout a mile up the mountain in this way,\r\nwhen, all to onct, ole Bill stopped and looked straight before him. I\r\nstopped, too, an’ seed three big Comanches comin’ along easy like,\r\nlookin’ at the ground, examinin’ the bushes, an’ whisperin’ to each\r\nother. They had found a trail that either me or ole Bill had made the\r\nday afore, an’ war tryin’ to foller it up. But me an’ the ole man\r\nwarn’t the ones to leave a path that could be follered easy when we\r\nthought thar war red-skins ’round; an’ I guess it bothered them\r\nrascals some to tell which way we had gone, an’ how many thar war of\r\nus. But they did foller it up slowly, an’ while we war lookin’ at ’em\r\nthey were jined by another Injun, who seemed to be a chief, for he\r\nwhispered a few orders, an’ two of the Comanches made off. They had\r\nbeen sent to rouse the camp, an’ we knowed that we couldn’t get away\r\nfrom that valley any too fast. The red-skins warn’t more’n a hundred\r\nyards from us, an’ we knowed it would take mighty keerful movin’ to\r\nget away from them without bein’ diskivered. But it war life or death\r\nwith us, an’ we began to crawl slowly through the bushes. A greenhorn\r\ncouldn’t have heered a leaf rustle if he hadn’t been two foot from us;\r\nbut thar’s a heap of difference atween a greenhorn’s ears an’ them\r\nthat a Injun carries. But they didn’t hear us, fur as long as we war\r\nin sight we seed them still follerin’ up the ole trail; an’ as soon as\r\nwe thought we had got out of hearin’ of them, we jumped to our feet\r\nan’ run like a pair of quarter hosses. We didn’t make no more noise\r\nthan we could help, but we hadn’t gone fur afore the mountains echoed\r\nwith the war-whoop, an’ a couple of arrers whizzed by our heads. The\r\nInjuns had diskivered us. In course, we both dropped like a flash of\r\nlightnin’, an’, while I war lookin’ round to find the varlets, ole\r\nBill struck out his hand, sayin’:\r\n\r\n“‘This is a bad scrape, Dick, an’ mebbe me an’ you have done our last\r\ntrappin’ together. But we musn’t get ketched if we can help it, ’cause\r\nwe couldn’t look fur nothin’ but the stake.’\r\n\r\n“While the ole man war speakin’, I seed one of the rascals that had\r\nshot at us peepin’ out from behind a log. He didn’t show more’n two\r\ninches of his head, but that war enough, an’ I reckon that red-skin\r\nlay thar till his friends toted him off. Jest the minit I fired, ole\r\nBill throwed down his furs, jumped to his feet, an’ run, an’ I done\r\nthe same, although I did hate to leave that spelter that I had worked\r\nso hard fur all winter. But, in course, thar war no help fur it. Thar\r\nwar plenty more beaver in the mountains, an’, if I got safe off, I\r\nknowed whar to go to find ’em; but if I lost my scalp, I couldn’t get\r\nanother. So, as I war sayin’, I put arter the ole man, an’ jest then I\r\nheered something ’sides a arrer sing by my head. It war a bullet, an’\r\nthe chap that sent it warn’t sich a bad shot neither; fur, if I had\r\nthe ole ’coon-skin cap I wore then, I could show you whar a piece of\r\nit war cut out. I didn’t stop to look fur the feller, howsomever, but\r\nkept on arter ole Bill, loadin’ my rifle as I ran. The woods war so\r\nthick we couldn’t keep clost together, an’ I soon lost sight of him;\r\nbut that didn’t skeer me, fur I knowed he could take keer of his own\r\nbacon. As fur myself, I never yet seed the Injun, or white man either,\r\nthat could ketch me, if I onct got a leetle start of him; an’ if all\r\nthe Injuns in the mountains war _behind_ me, I could laugh at ’em. But\r\nthar war some in front of me, as I found out afore I had gone fur. I\r\nhad jest got my rifle loaded, an’ war settlin’ down to my work--makin’\r\npurty good time, I reckon, the Injuns behind me yellin’ an’ hootin’\r\nall the while--when, all to onct, up jumped about a dozen more of the\r\nrascals.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t stop to ax no questions, but sent the nighest of ’em down in\r\na hurry; but in a minit arterward I war down, too; an’ when I war\r\npulled to my pins ag’in, I war a pris’ner, my hands bein’ bound behind\r\nme with hickory bark. It warn’t a pleasant sight I seed, youngsters,\r\nas I stood thar, lookin’ at them scowlin’ Injuns. At that day thar war\r\nfew of them Comanches that didn’t know me an’ ole Bill, an’ when they\r\nseed who I war, they all set up a yell, an’ began dancin’ ’round me\r\nlike mad, shakin’ their tomahawks, an’ pintin’ their rifles an’ arrers\r\nat me; an’ one feller ketched me by the har, an’ passed his knife\r\n’round my head, as though he had half a notion to scalp me to onct.\r\nThey kept goin’ on in this way until all the Injuns in that part of\r\nthe woods had come up to see what the fuss war ’bout; an’ they, too,\r\nhad to go through the same motions. All to onct they happened to think\r\nof ole Bill. The chief set up a shout, an’ all but four of the Injuns\r\nput off on his trail. It showed me, plain enough, that the rascals war\r\nafraid of me, when they left so many to guard me. But no four of them\r\nComanches would have stopped me from gettin’ away if I could have got\r\nmy hands free. I tell you, I done my best, makin’ that tough hickory\r\nbark crack an’ snap, but it war no go--I war fast. As soon as the\r\nothers war out of sight, one big feller ketched me by the har, an’\r\nbegun to pull me t’wards the camp.\r\n\r\n“He didn’t help me along very easy, but dragged me over logs an’\r\nthrough bushes, as if he meant to pull my head off, while the other\r\nfellers, findin’ nothin’ else to do, follered behind with switches,\r\nthat cut through my old huntin’-shirt like a knife. At last, arter\r\nthey had got me purty well thrashed, we reached the camp, which war\r\njest at the foot of the mountains--I’ll show you the place in the\r\nmornin’--an’ here they stood me up ag’in a post. Then I ketched it\r\nfrom every body--men, women, an’ young ones. The most of the braves\r\nwar still out arter the old man, an’ I could easy tell by the way they\r\nwhooped an’ yelled that they hadn’t ketched him. I knowed they\r\nwouldn’t get him, neither, unless they surrounded him like they did\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Wal, arter tormentin’ me fur a long time, an’ findin’ that I didn’t\r\nkeer fur ’em, the Injuns finally let me alone; an’ one ole dried-up\r\nsquaw brought me a piece of buffaler meat. They wouldn’t untie my\r\nhands, but that ole woman sot thar on the ground, an’ fed me like I\r\nwar a baby. I eat a heap of that meat, ’cause I war hungry, an’ if I\r\ngot a chance to have a race with the varlets, I didn’t want to run on\r\nan empty stomach; ’sides I might have to go without eatin’ fur two or\r\nthree days afore I could find ole Bill. Jest afore dark the braves\r\nbegan to come in, one arter the other. They hadn’t ketched the ole\r\nman, an’ I could see, by the way they scowled at me, that I would have\r\nto stand punishment for his deeds, an’ my own into the bargain. I\r\ncould have yelled, when I knowed the old feller war safe, an’ I made\r\nup my mind that if the Injuns would only give me half a chance, I’d\r\nsoon be with him ag’in.\r\n\r\n“Wal, when the chiefs come in, I war tied fast to the post, and left\r\nthar. They didn’t try to skeer me any more, ’cause they seed it war no\r\nuse, an’ ’sides, they wanted to save all their spite fur the mornin’,\r\nfur it war too late to begin bisness that night. I war fast enough--as\r\nfast as if I had been wrapped up in chains--but them Injuns war afraid\r\nto trust me. They actooally kept half a dozen of their braves watchin’\r\nme, from the time it began to grow dark till daylight the next\r\nmornin’. I didn’t sleep very easy, fur I war standin’ ag’in that post,\r\nan’ the bark they had tied me with war drawed so tight that it cut\r\ninto my arms; but I made out to git a nap or two, an’ when mornin’\r\ncome, an’ I had eat another big chunk of that buffaler meat, I war\r\nready fur ’em to begin.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the sun war up, the chief called a council. It didn’t take\r\n’em long to say what should be done with me, fur sooner than I had\r\nthought fur, one of the chiefs set up a yelp, which war answered by\r\nthe hul tribe, an’ men, women, an’ children began formin’ themselves\r\ninto two lines, with whips, clubs, tomahawks, or whatever else they\r\ncould ketch hold of; an’ two fellers come up to set me free. I war to\r\nrun the gauntlet. I tell you, youngsters, if thar is any thing that\r\nwill make the har rise on a feller’s head, it is fur him to stand an’\r\nlook atween two lines sich as I saw that mornin’. It warn’t the fust\r\ntime I had been in jest sich scrapes, an’ I knowed, too, that the\r\nInjuns didn’t mean to kill me then--they wanted to save me for the\r\nstake--but somehow I couldn’t help feelin’ shaky. I didn’t let the\r\nInjuns see it, howsomever, but tightened my belt, stretched my arms,\r\nan’, ’walkin’ out in front of the lines, waited fur the word to start.\r\nThe head of the line war t’wards the camp, an’ at the foot, which war\r\nt’wards this creek, stood five or six big fellers, waitin’ to ketch me\r\nwhen I come out.\r\n\r\n“Wal, it didn’t take me long to see how the land lay, an’ when the\r\nchief yelled to let me know that the time had come, I started. The way\r\nI traveled through ’em lines war a thing fur ’em Comanches to look at.\r\nI got plenty of clips as I passed, but this war the only one that hurt\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nAs the trapper spoke, he bared his brawny shoulder, and showed the\r\nboys a long, ragged scar. The wound must have been a most severe one.\r\n\r\n“That one,” continued Dick, “war made by a tomahawk. It didn’t hinder\r\nmy runnin’, howsomever, an’ I warn’t half a minit comin’ to the end of\r\n’em lines. But when I got thar I didn’t stop. The Injuns that war\r\nwaitin’ thar, tried to ketch me, but I passed them like a streak of\r\nlightnin’, an’ drawed a bee-line fur this ere creek. In course the\r\nhul camp war arter me to onct; but I knowed that I war safe, fur all\r\nthe Injuns war behind me, an’ I wouldn’t have been afraid to run a\r\nrace with a hoss. I didn’t do as well as I had done afore, nor nigh as\r\nwell as I could do now, fur I war stiff an’ lame from bein’ tied up so\r\nlong; but I run plenty fast enough to git away. As I told you, I run\r\nthrough these willows, swam the creek--which war wide an’ deep then,\r\non ’count of the snow an’ ice meltin’--then tuk to the mountains, an’\r\nstarted to make a circle round to the ole bar’s hole. I traveled in\r\nevery little stream I could find; walked on logs, an’ on the second\r\nday, found ole Bill. The ole feller had been mighty down-hearted since\r\nI war ketched--fur the yells of the Injuns plainly told him what had\r\nbecome of me--an’ had never expected to take me by the hand ag’in.\r\nBut, when he seed me safe an’ sound, he sot right down on the ground\r\nan’ cried like a child.\r\n\r\n“Wal, we lay ’round the ole bar’s hole till the Injuns had gone, an’\r\nthen set out fur the fort. We war on foot, an’ had but one rifle\r\natween us, but we got through all right, an’ in less’n a month, war on\r\nour way to the mountains ag’in.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe “Ole Bar’s Hole.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, after a hasty breakfast, the boys saddled their horses,\r\nand, led by the trapper, set out to find the wagon. Now it was that\r\nthe latter showed the young hunters his extraordinary “travelin’\r\nqualities,” as he expressed it; for as soon as the boys were in their\r\nsaddles, he shouldered his rifle and started off, at a rapid pace,\r\nwhich he did not slacken at all until they arrived on the banks of a\r\nsmall stream, where they stopped to quench their thirst.\r\n\r\n“Now, youngsters,” said the trapper, seating himself on the ground,\r\nand wiping his forehead with his coat sleeve, “There’s the place. The\r\nComanche’s camp war pitched jest in the edge of them ar’ willows, an’\r\nright where you see them bushes war where I stood afore I started to\r\nrun the gauntlet. The chief’s wigwam stood thar then. I tell you, it\r\nwarn’t healthy fur a feller to go foolin’ ’round here them days.”\r\n\r\nThe boys gazed long and earnestly at every object the trapper pointed\r\nout, and listened to his narration of the various incidents that had\r\ntranspired during his captivity, until they almost fancied they could\r\nsee the prairie covered with painted savages, and their guide, in the\r\nmidst of his foes, awaiting the signal to begin his race for life.\r\nDick, himself, was no less interested, for he sat for a long time\r\nfeasting his eyes on every familiar object; now and then casting\r\nsuspicious glances toward the distant willows, as if he almost\r\nexpected to catch a glimpse of a hostile warrior, or hear the\r\nwar-whoop which had so often awoke the echoes of those very mountains.\r\n\r\n“Wal, youngsters,” said he, at length, “let’s be movin’! I never\r\nexpected to see the time when I could travel over these ere prairies\r\nwithout bein’ in danger of havin’ my har raised; an’ if you live to be\r\nas old as I am, you’ll see the day that ’em city chaps will ride\r\nthrough here on ’em steam railroads; an’ if they see this place,\r\nthey’ll never dream that such things as I have told you about ever\r\nhappened here.”\r\n\r\nThe travelers again set out, Dick leading the way, at a still more\r\nrapid pace, and in two hours they arrived at the camp. Mr. Winters and\r\nold Bob were lying in the shade of the wagon, and as the boys\r\napproached, the former raised himself on his elbow, and inquired:\r\n\r\n“Well, boys, how do you like traveling on your own hook? Do you think\r\nyou could find your way to California without a guide?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they war all right!” exclaimed Dick, leaning his rifle against\r\nthe wagon, and picking up the antelope skin which Archie had thrown\r\ndown, and which contained some choice pieces of meat. “They war all\r\nright! Me and Useless found ’em down on Muddy Creek, Bob. They had\r\nkilled this prong-horn, made their camp, an’ war takin’ matters easy\r\nlike, as though they had never heered tell on a Comanche--the keerless\r\nfellers.”\r\n\r\nWhile Frank and Archie were unsaddling their horses, the trapper\r\nproceeded to recount their adventures, to which both Mr. Winters and\r\nold Bob listened attentively. The latter was not a little astonished\r\nto learn that the boys could so readily accommodate themselves to\r\ncircumstances, and was more firm than ever in his belief that “the\r\nyoungsters would make good trappers.”\r\n\r\nMr. Winters had, at first, been considerably alarmed at their absence;\r\nbut, upon reflection, he remembered that the boys had often been in\r\npositions fully as dangerous, from which they had always succeeded in\r\nextricating themselves, and he soon fell in with the trapper’s\r\nopinion, that they would “turn up all right.” He did not think it\r\nnecessary to caution them, for, from the description the trapper gave\r\nof their adventures, it was not at all probable that they would ever\r\nagain be placed in a like situation.\r\n\r\nAfter a hearty dinner, which Dick speedily served up, they again set\r\nout toward the mountains, which they reached about the middle of the\r\nafternoon. After riding along the edge of the willows, for half a\r\nmile, they came to a wide but very shallow stream, into which the\r\ntrapper turned, and after following it for some distance, drove out on\r\nthe bank and stopped.\r\n\r\n“Here we are,” said he, as he climbed down out of his wagon. “Now,\r\nyoungsters, you’re at the ole bar’s hole. But if you didn’t know it\r\nwar here, you might hunt fur it till your har war whiter nor Bob’s,\r\nan’ then you wouldn’t find it, an’ that wouldn’t be no wonder neither;\r\nfur many a sharpeyed Comanche has looked an’ peeped fur it, but only\r\none ever found it that I know of, an’ it didn’t do him no good, fur he\r\nnever lived to tell of it.”\r\n\r\nWhile the trapper was speaking, old Bob had dismounted from his horse,\r\nand, walking up to a thicket of bushes which grew at the foot of a\r\nhigh rock that overhung the bed of the stream, began pulling them\r\naside, and finally disclosed to view an opening that appeared to lead\r\ndown into the very bowels of the earth. Meanwhile, Dick had gathered\r\nsome dry wood for a torch, and, after lighting it, he backed down into\r\nthe hole and disappeared, followed by Frank and Archie, who were\r\nimpatient to see the inside of the cave which had so often served\r\ntheir guide as a secure retreat from his enemies. The passage was long\r\nand winding, and it was with considerable difficulty that the boys\r\nworked their way into it. Besides, it was in some places so narrow\r\nthat they could scarcely squeeze themselves through it. The trapper,\r\nhowever, worked his way along with a celerity that was surprising, and\r\nsoon both he and the torch were out of sight, and the boys were left\r\nin pitch darkness. But there was little danger of their being lost in\r\nthat narrow passage, and they crawled along as rapidly as possible,\r\nuntil at length Archie, who was leading the way, stopped, and began to\r\nrub his elbows and knees, which had received some pretty severe\r\nscratches from the sharp rocks.\r\n\r\n“I say, Frank,” he exclaimed, “how do you suppose Dick ever squeezed\r\nhis broad shoulders through a narrow place like this? What’s that?” he\r\nadded, in a terrified voice, as they heard a savage growl, which\r\nseemed to sound directly over their heads.\r\n\r\nFrank did not stop to answer, but throwing himself on his hands and\r\nknees, began to make the best of his way out of the passage, closely\r\nfollowed by his cousin, who urged him to go faster. They had not gone\r\nfar when they were startled by the report of a rifle, which was\r\nfollowed by a roar that echoed and reëchoed through the cave like a\r\nheavy clap of thunder. What it was that had uttered that roar the boys\r\nwere unable to determine; but they knew, by the report of the\r\ntrapper’s rifle, and the sounds of a fierce struggle that came faintly\r\nto their ears, that Dick had found his old harboring-place occupied\r\nby some animal which did not feel disposed to give up possession; and\r\nthey got out of the passage in much less time than it had taken them\r\nto get into it. When they reached the open air, the old trapper, who\r\nhad heard the report of his “chum’s” rifle, threw himself on his hands\r\nand knees, and crawled into the cave, followed by Mr. Winters. The\r\nboys at once ran to the wagon after their weapons, but by the time\r\nthey had secured them, the fight was ended, and Dick made his\r\nappearance at the mouth of the passage. But he did not look like the\r\nman who had gone into that cave but a few moments before. His\r\nhunting-shirt and leggins were torn almost into shreds, his arms were\r\nbare to his shoulders, and were covered with wounds that were bleeding\r\nprofusely. The boys were horrified; but their fears that the trapper\r\nhad received serious injury were speedily set at rest, for he smiled\r\nas if nothing had happened, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Now you see what it is to be a trapper, youngsters. I shall allers\r\nthink that ’ar cave has a good name, fur if me an’ Useless didn’t find\r\nthe biggest grizzly bar in thar we ever sot eyes on, then thar aint no\r\nmore beaver in the Missouri River.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he divested himself of what remained of his\r\nhunting-shirt, and walked down to the creek to wash the blood off his\r\nhands and face, in which he was assisted by Mr. Winters. While this\r\nwas going on, old Bob crawled out of the cave, carrying two cubs in\r\nhis arms, which he presented to the boys, saying:\r\n\r\n“Them’s young grizzlies. They don’t look now as if they would ever get\r\nto be as big and fierce as their mother war.”\r\n\r\nAs the boys took them, they both set up a shrill cry, and fought most\r\ndesperately for such small animals, and their sharp little claws left\r\nmore than one mark upon the hands and faces of the young hunters.\r\n\r\n“Keep an eye open, Bob,” shouted Dick, who was seated on the ground,\r\nwhile Mr. Winters was bandaging his wounds. “Keep an’ eye open, ’cause\r\nthe old man of the family may be ’round.”\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this, Archie dropped his cub, and seizing his rifle, cast\r\nanxious glances upon the surrounding woods. But if the father was in\r\nthe vicinity, he evidently thought it best to keep out of sight.\r\n\r\nWhen Dick’s wounds had been cared for, and he had put on another suit\r\nof clothes, he seated himself on the ground, near the boys, while Bob\r\nkindled a fire and began preparations for supper.\r\n\r\n“It aint allers fun to be a trapper, youngsters,” said Dick, puffing\r\naway at his pipe, “’cause, afore a man can earn that name, he’s got to\r\ngo through a heap of skrimmages, like the one I jest had. When I’m on\r\nthe prairy, or in the mountains, I allers keep my eyes open, an’ the\r\nfust thing I seed as I crawled out of that passage into that ar’ cave\r\nwar that grizzly bar. She seed me, too, and set up a growl, as if to\r\ntell me that I couldn’t get away from thar any too quick; but she\r\ndidn’t wink more’n twice afore I sent a chunk of lead into her. The\r\nlight of the torch, however, bothered me, an’ I didn’t shoot atween\r\nher eyes, as I meant to; an’ afore a feller could say ‘Gin’ral\r\nJackson,’ she war comin’ at me. Now, I’ve been in jest such scrapes\r\nafore, an’ the way I’ve got pawed up, an’ seed other fellers that were\r\nbigger and stronger than me, clawed an’ torn, has showed me that no\r\none man that ever lived is a match fur a full-grown grizzly; an’ when\r\nI seed ole Bob poke his rifle out of the passage an’ draw a bead on\r\nthat bar’s head, I’ll allow it made me feel a heap easier. If he had\r\nstayed away five minits longer, I don’t believe I’d ever showed you\r\nthe way to Californy. As it war, I got pretty well clawed up.”\r\n\r\nThis was the way the trapper described the fight in the cave, which\r\nwas one of the most desperate he had ever engaged in, as the severe\r\nwounds he had received proved. But he looked upon such things as a\r\nmatter of course. He expected to be engaged in many similar fights;\r\nalways held himself in readiness for them, and when they were over,\r\nanother notch was added to those on the handle of his knife (for Dick\r\nkept a strict account of the number of grizzlies he killed,) and he\r\nhad another story to tell by the camp-fire.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, the trappers procured torches, and, accompanied by Mr.\r\nWinters and the boys, proceeded to explore the cave. There, lying\r\nwhere she had fallen in defense of her young, was the grizzly, which\r\nwas the first of these animals the boys had ever seen. As near as they\r\ncould judge, she was fully twice the size and weight of the bear Frank\r\nhad killed in the woods, and her claws, which she had used with such\r\neffect upon the trapper and his dog, (for, in defending his master,\r\nUseless had been most roughly handled,) measured eight inches in\r\nlength. Every thing in the cave bore evidence to the fact that the\r\nfight had been a severe one. The floor and walls were covered with\r\nblood, and on the bear’s body were numerous wounds, made by the knife\r\nof the trapper, and the teeth of the faithful Useless.\r\n\r\nAfter the boys had examined the bear to their satisfaction, old Bob\r\nbegan to remove the skin, while Dick pointed out other objects of\r\ninterest in the cave. There were the withered hemlock boughs which had\r\nmany a time served him and Bill Lawson for a bed, and under them was a\r\nhole about two feet square, which the trapper called his “pantry.” He\r\ntold Mr. Winters the story of the “struggle in the cave,” and showed\r\nhim the passage that led to the top of the hill where the Comanches\r\nhad entered, and where he had for two days kept watch, awaiting the\r\ncoming of old Bill.\r\n\r\nThey remained in the cave for an hour, listening to Dick’s stories;\r\nfor in his mind the “Ole Bar’s Hole” was associated with many exciting\r\nevents, and it was dark before they returned to the camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nArchie’s Adventure with a Grizzly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the boys, as usual, were up with the sun,\r\nimpatient to try their skill on the big game, with which the woods\r\nabounded. The trapper, who, during his fight in the cave, had received\r\nwounds that would have prostrated an ordinary man, was already\r\nstirring, and, having attended to his mules, was moving about as\r\nlively as ever, preparing the morning meal. In a few moments their\r\nbreakfast was cooked and eaten, and, after hanging their provisions on\r\nthe trees, out of reach of any wild beast that might find his way into\r\ncamp during their absence, they shouldered their rifles and followed\r\nthe trappers into the forest. Here they divided into two parties, Mr.\r\nWinters going with old Bob, and the boys accompanying Dick.\r\n\r\n“Now, youngsters,” said the latter almost in a whisper, “we haint\r\nhuntin’ squirrels. We’re arter bigger game. I don’t s’pose you keer\r\n’bout tacklin’ a grizzly bar arter seein’ me pawed up the way I war\r\nlast night; so if you happen to come acrosst one of them varmints, you\r\nneedn’t mind shootin’ at him. Thar’s plenty other game, an’ what we\r\nwant to find now ar’ a big-horn. That’s an animal, I reckon, you never\r\nseed. Go easy, now, ’cause they’ve got ears like a painter’s, an’\r\nnoses sharper nor hounds.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the trapper led the way through a narrow ravine that lay\r\nbetween two mountains, whose tops seemed to pierce the clouds. The\r\nravine, being thickly covered with bushes and logs, rendered their\r\nprogress slow and tedious, and the boys, who could not help thinking\r\nwhat a fine hiding-place it would afford for a bear or panther, often\r\ncast uneasy glances about them, and kept as close to the trapper as\r\npossible. After they had gone about half a mile, the latter suddenly\r\nstopped and said:\r\n\r\n“If these yere trees could talk, a’most every one of ’em would have a\r\nstory to tell you ’bout me an’ ole Bill Lawson, ’cause we’ve often\r\ncome through this gully when it war chuck full of Comanches. You\r\n’member I onct told you ’bout waitin’ at the ole bar’s hole fur him,\r\nan’ that the ole feller had hid the black mustang in the bushes! Wal,\r\nhere’s the very spot.”\r\n\r\nAs the trapper spoke, he pushed his way into a dense thicket, and\r\nshowed the boys the sapling to which the old man had tied the horse.\r\n\r\n“Wal, that ar’ animal,” continued Dick, “stood here fur two hours\r\nquiet an’ still as a mouse, an’ we tuk him out an’ got safe off\r\nwithout the varlets bein’ the wiser fur it. All the way through here\r\nwe could hear ’em talkin’ to each other, an’--Look thar, youngsters,\r\nquick!”\r\n\r\nBefore the boys could look up to see what had attracted the trapper’s\r\nattention, the sharp report of his rifle rung through the gully, and a\r\nqueer-looking animal come tumbling down the mountain, landing almost\r\nat their feet. Far up above the tree tops they saw the remainder of\r\nthe flock bound over the rocks and disappear.\r\n\r\n“That’s a sheep,” said the trapper, hastily reloading his rifle.\r\n“He’ll make a fust rate dinner, an’, if we keep our eyes open, we may\r\nget another.”\r\n\r\nThe game did bear a close resemblance to sheep, the only difference\r\nbeing his enormous horns, which looked altogether too large and heavy\r\nfor so small an animal to carry. But the trapper did not allow them to\r\nclosely examine their prize, for he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“If we want more of ’em fellers, we mustn’t waste no time. But, fust,\r\nwe must separate, ’cause the further apart we get, the more likely we\r\nare to have a shot at ’em. Are you afraid to stay here, little un?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” replied Archie, quickly.\r\n\r\n“Wal, then, keep your eyes up the mountain, an’ if you see ’em ag’in,\r\nblaze away. Come on, Frank. I’ll show you whar to stand.”\r\n\r\nThe latter moved off with Dick, and Archie was left to himself. After\r\nexamining the game to his satisfaction, he took up a position where he\r\ncould obtain a good view of the side of the mountain, leaned back\r\nagainst a tree, and impatiently waited for the re-appearance of the\r\nbig-horns. In front of him ran a deer path, hard and well-beaten as\r\nany road. It was, no doubt, used as a highway by animals traveling\r\nthrough the ravine; and Archie now and then directed his gaze up and\r\ndown the path, in hopes he might discover some game in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHe had remained in this position for nearly half an hour, when he\r\n_did_ see an animal coming leisurely down the path, about fifty yards\r\nfrom him. It was an enormous grizzly bear. It did not appear to have\r\ndetermined upon any thing in particular, for it approached very\r\nslowly, stopping every few feet to snuff the air, and finally seated\r\nitself on its haunches, and proceeded to wash its paws and face, after\r\nthe manner of a house cat. Archie had a good view of it. It was nearly\r\nas large as the one the trapper had killed in the cave, and the sight\r\nof its powerful claws, and the frightful array of teeth it exhibited,\r\nmade the young hunter shudder. He had not been expecting so formidable\r\na visitor, and to say that he was frightened would but feebly express\r\nhis feelings. He had presence of mind enough, however, to move behind\r\nhis tree, out of sight; but still he could not remove his eyes from\r\nthe animal, neither could he determine upon any plan to extricate\r\nhimself from his unpleasant situation. The grizzly had not yet\r\ndiscovered him, and Archie had his wits about him sufficiently to note\r\nthe fact, that what little wind there was, was blowing from the bear\r\ntoward himself. For fully five minutes--it seemed much longer to\r\nArchie--the grizzly sat in the path, sometimes looking lazily about\r\nhim, and then licking his jaws like a dog that had just enjoyed a good\r\nmeal; and for the same length of time did the young hunter remain\r\nbehind his tree watching his movements, and wondering what course he\r\ncould pursue to rid himself of his dangerous neighbor. It was not at\r\nall probable that the bear would remain in that position until the\r\ntrapper returned. What if he should take it into his head to come\r\nfurther down the path? Archie would certainly be discovered, for the\r\npath run close by the tree, behind which he was concealed, and what\r\nwould the bear do then? It was something he did not like to think\r\nabout. He knew, from what he had heard the trapper say, that the\r\ngrizzly’s disposition is very different from that of the black bear.\r\nThe latter, unless rendered desperate by hunger, will generally take\r\nto his heels at the sight of a human being; but the grizzly looks upon\r\nall who invade his dominions as enemies, and believes in punishing\r\nthem accordingly.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts passed rapidly through Archie’s mind, and in a moment\r\nmore his resolve was taken. Keeping his eyes fastened on the bear, he\r\ncautiously raised his hand above his head, and, to his joy, found that\r\nhe could easily reach the lowest limbs of the tree, and that they were\r\nstrong enough to sustain his weight. But it was not his intention to\r\nleave the grizzly in peaceable possession of the field; for, as soon\r\nas he had satisfied himself that he had found a way of escape, he\r\ncocked his rifle and cautiously raised it to his shoulder. He was\r\ntrembling violently, but at length he succeeded in quieting his nerves\r\nsufficiently to cover the bear’s head with the sight and pull the\r\ntrigger. The grizzly, however, arose to his feet just as Archie fired,\r\nand the ball, instead of finding a lodgment in his brain, entered his\r\nshoulder. It brought him to the ground, and Archie caught one glimpse\r\nof him struggling in the path, and heard his growls of rage and pain,\r\nas he dropped his rifle and swung himself into the lowest branches of\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the bear meant to take ample revenge on him, for\r\nArchie heard him coming up the path. But he knew that the grizzly\r\ncould not climb, and, after settling himself among the branches, he\r\nlooked down at his enemy in perfect security. The bear knew where he\r\nhad gone, for he ran directly to the foot of the tree, and, after\r\nsmelling at the rifle and pawing it out of his way, he began walking\r\nup and down the path, all the while uttering those terrific growls,\r\nthat made the young hunter tremble.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Archie heard the report of a rifle far up the mountain,\r\nwhich was quickly followed by another that sounded nearer. Then came a\r\ncrashing in the bushes, as the big-horns fled before the hunters, and\r\nArchie heard his companions shouting to him:\r\n\r\n“Look out, down there,” said Frank; “they’re running directly toward\r\nyou, Archie.”\r\n\r\n“Keep your eyes open, youngster,” chimed in Dick. “Don’t let ’em go by\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nBut Archie was not in a situation to intercept them, and he heard the\r\nbig-horns dash across the ravine and bound up the mountain on the\r\nopposite side, closely followed by the dog, which barked fierce and\r\nloud at every jump.\r\n\r\n“Archie, why don’t you shoot?” again shouted Frank, his voice sounding\r\nas though he was coming down the mountain.\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” answered Archie. “Look out! Don’t come down here. I’m treed\r\nby a grizzly.”\r\n\r\n“By a grizzly?” repeated Frank, in astonishment. “Has he hurt you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” shouted Archie, from his tree, “I am all right; but I hurt him,\r\nI guess. Look out, Frank! he’s going toward you.”\r\n\r\nThis was a fact. The grizzly had stood perfectly still under the tree,\r\nlistening to the sounds of the chase, until, finding that he could not\r\nreach Archie, he determined to revenge himself upon some one else. He\r\nhad not gone far before Useless, having overtaken and killed a\r\nbig-horn that his master had wounded, came up, and, discovering the\r\ngrizzly, instantly gave chase. The bear, maddened by the pain of his\r\nwound, advanced with open mouth to meet him; but the dog, easily\r\neluding his attacks, kept him busy until the trapper arrived, and put\r\nan end to the fight by shooting the bear through the head. Archie had\r\nwatched the struggle from his perch, and, seeing that the grizzly was\r\ndead, he came down out of his tree, feeling very much relieved.\r\n\r\n“You keerless feller!” exclaimed the trapper, “didn’t I tell you not\r\nto mind shootin’ at a grizzly bar?”\r\n\r\nBy this time Frank had come up with a big-horn on his shoulder, and,\r\nafter having regained his rifle, Archie gave them an account of what\r\nhad transpired.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said the trapper, “it war keerless to go a foolin’ with a bar\r\nthat ar’ way. Now, you stay here, an’ I’ll go an’ get that big-horn\r\nthat Useless killed.”\r\n\r\nThe dog, as if understanding what was said, led his master to the\r\nplace where he had left the game. When the trapper returned, he\r\nremoved the skin of the grizzly, intending to cure it, and give it to\r\nArchie to remember his “keerlessness by,” as he said. After which,\r\nthey shouldered their game and returned to camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHanging a Bear.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the wagon, they found Mr. Winters and old Bob\r\neating their dinner. Although not as fortunate as Dick’s party, they\r\nhad not returned empty-handed, for the old trapper had killed a\r\nbig-horn, and Mr. Winters had knocked over a large gray wolf. Thinking\r\nthat Frank might want the skin of the latter to mount in his museum,\r\nhe had taken it off very carefully, and stretched it on a frame to\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nArchie’s adventure with the grizzly was duly discussed, and, for an\r\nhour after dinner, the boys sat by the fire listening to the trapper’s\r\nstories. But they could not long endure this inactivity--there was “no\r\nfun in it,” as Archie said--so they saddled their horses and set out\r\nfor a ride over the prairie. They were not after game this time. If\r\nthey had been, it is not at all probable they would have discovered\r\nany, for they raced their horses over the swells, and shouted loud\r\nenough to frighten all the animals for a mile around. About the middle\r\nof the afternoon they grew tired of their ride, and turned their\r\nhorses toward the camp. As they rode slowly along, about half a mile\r\nfrom the willows that skirted the base of the mountains, Archie, who,\r\nas usual, was leading the way, suddenly drew up his horse, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“See there, Frank! There’s another of the varmints!”\r\n\r\nFrank looked toward the willows, and saw a large grizzly bear, seated\r\non his haunches, regarding them as if not at all concerned about their\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n“We’re safe now, Archie,” said he, as soon as he had satisfied himself\r\nthat the bear had not the slightest intention of seeking safety in\r\nflight. “A grizzly can’t outrun a horse, so let’s shoot at that\r\nfellow.”\r\n\r\n“I--I--believe I’d rather not meddle with him,” answered his cousin,\r\nshrugging his shoulders. “I say, let him alone if he lets us alone.\r\nWhat if our horses should get frightened and throw us? Wouldn’t we be\r\nin a fix? But I’ll shoot at him from here.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s too far,” said Frank. “I am going up nearer.” As he spoke,\r\nhe put his horse into a gallop and rode toward the bear, which was\r\nstill seated in the edge of the willows. Archie did not at all like\r\nthe idea of provoking a fight with the animal; but, after a moment’s\r\nhesitation, he followed his cousin. There might be no danger after\r\nall, he thought, for that bear certainly could not catch Sleepy Sam.\r\nThe grizzly still kept his seat, closely watching the movements of the\r\nhunters, and once or twice he seemed inclined to advance on them; but,\r\nafter walking a few steps, he again seated himself, as if to await\r\ntheir approach.\r\n\r\nThe boys had gone but a short distance, when their horses discovered\r\nthe animal, and Pete at once stopped, and refused to go any further.\r\nHe had evidently had some experience in bear hunting, for the sight of\r\nthe animal seemed to terrify him. Words had more effect than the\r\nspurs, for when Frank spoke encouragingly to him, he would advance a\r\nfew steps, and then, as if suddenly recalling his former experience,\r\nhe would hastily retreat. In this way, he succeeded in getting\r\nfurther and further away from the bear, instead of going toward it.\r\nArchie now took the lead, in hopes that his cousin could induce his\r\nhorse to follow the old buffalo hunter; but Pete utterly refused to go\r\nany nearer, and Frank at length dismounted and prepared to risk a shot\r\nat the bear at long range. The animal accepted this as a challenge,\r\nfor he arose to his feet, growling savagely, and made toward the boys\r\nat a rate of speed that astonished them.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank dismounted, he was careful to retain a firm hold of Pete’s\r\nbridle, for the actions of the horse plainly indicated that, if left\r\nto himself, he would take to his heels, and get as far as possible\r\naway from the dangerous neighborhood. When he saw that the bear was\r\ncoming toward him, he snorted and plunged, rendering it impossible for\r\nFrank to shoot; and, in fact, the latter had no desire to do so, when\r\nhe found that the grizzly was about to assume the offensive. His first\r\nthought was to remount; but the horse was so terrified that he would\r\nnot stand still long enough for Frank to place his foot in the\r\nstirrup.\r\n\r\n“Hurry up, there!” exclaimed Archie, excitedly. “The rascal is coming\r\nfast. He means fight, sure enough.”\r\n\r\nPete evidently thought so too, for he reared and plunged worse than\r\never, pulling Frank about over the prairie in spite of all he could\r\ndo. Suddenly there was a loud snap, and the bridle, broken close to\r\nthe bit, was violently pulled through Frank’s hand. The next moment\r\nPete had disappeared behind a swell. For an instant the cousins gazed\r\nat each other in dismay. On foot, Frank could not hope to escape from\r\nthe bear, which, in spite of his clumsy appearance, was making his way\r\ntoward them with surprising rapidity; neither could he disable him by\r\na shot from his rifle. Before, he had been as cool and collected as he\r\npossibly could be, for he knew that he had a way of escape. But Pete\r\nseemed to have carried the last particle of his master’s courage away\r\nwith him, for Frank’s hand trembled so violently that he knew it would\r\nbe useless to fire at the bear. But still there was a chance for\r\nescape, and Archie was the first to think of it.\r\n\r\n“Frank!” he exclaimed, “there’s only one way now--jump up behind me.”\r\n\r\nHis cousin was prompt to act upon the suggestion, and Sleepy Sam,\r\nin answer to a thrust from his master’s spurs, carried them both\r\ntoward the camp at a rapid gallop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey no longer thought of fighting the grizzly; their only desire was\r\nto reach the old bear’s hole as soon as possible, and procure the\r\nassistance of the trappers. They both thought that the animal would\r\nsoon abandon the chase, and their only fear was, that before they\r\ncould reach the camp and acquaint Dick with what had transpired, the\r\nbear would be safe among the mountains. But they soon discovered their\r\nmistake. The grizzly steadily followed them, and, although Sleepy Sam\r\nmade excellent time for a horse encumbered with a double load, gained\r\nat every step. But they were rapidly nearing the old bear’s hole, and,\r\nat length, the boys saw their uncle and the trappers ride out of the\r\nwillows. Dick was mounted on Frank’s horse. The animal, when he found\r\nhimself at liberty, had made straight for camp, and his appearance\r\nthere, without his rider, occasioned no little surprise and alarm.\r\nDick, as usual, predicted that “Frank warn’t a bit hurt. He would be\r\nsartin to turn up all right.” But still he did not know but the young\r\nhunter had got himself into “some scrape,” in which he would need\r\nassistance, and agreed with Mr. Winters that it would be best to hunt\r\nhim up. The latter was fast falling in with the trapper’s opinion,\r\nthat his nephews were “’bout the keerlessest chaps agoin’;” and\r\nalthough he knew that they always succeeded in bringing themselves\r\n“safe out of all their scrapes,” he felt considerably relieved, when\r\nhe saw that Sleepy Sam had carried them out of reach of the claws of\r\nthe grizzly.\r\n\r\nArchie, when he found that assistance was at hand, stopped and faced\r\nthe bear, intending to try a shot at him. But the trappers galloped\r\ntoward them, Dick shouting, “Hold on thar, you keerless feller; me an’\r\nBob’ll take him off your hands. We’ll show you how they hunt bars in\r\nMexico. We’ll hang the varmint.”\r\n\r\nThe trapper swung a lasso above his head, as he spoke, and brought it\r\ndown across Pete’s sides, in a way that made the spirited animal\r\nprance in the most lively manner. The horse was still unwilling to\r\napproach the bear; but he knew full well that he carried a rider who\r\nwas able to enforce obedience.\r\n\r\nThe grizzly stopped for a moment when he saw these new enemies\r\napproaching, then he rushed toward old Bob, who was in advance of his\r\ncompanion. But he was met by the trapper’s dog, which attacked him\r\nwith such fury that the bear was obliged to stop and defend himself.\r\nOld Bob rode in a circle around the combatants, holding his lasso in\r\nhis hand all ready for a throw, and yelling with all the strength of\r\nhis lungs to encourage the dog. Dick was making desperate efforts to\r\njoin his companion, but his horse stopped about a hundred yards from\r\nthe bear, and stubbornly refused to go nearer. His rider, resolved to\r\nhave his own way, beat him most unmercifully with his lasso, and, as\r\nthe horse appeared to be equally determined, the boys were unable to\r\ndecide how the battle would end. All this while Useless had kept up\r\nthe contest with the bear, and the animal finding that he could not\r\nelude his attacks, rose on his haunches and struck at the dog with his\r\npaws. Old Bob had been waiting for this. Swinging his lasso around his\r\nhead, he launched it at the bear, and as the noose settled down about\r\nhis neck, he turned his horse and galloped off. The next moment there\r\nwas a heavy thud, a smothered growl of rage, and the grizzly was\r\nprostrate on the prairie. He, however, quickly regained his feet,\r\nand, disregarding the attacks of the dog, rushed with open mouth\r\ntoward old Bob. Now was the time for Dick. Having, at last, been\r\nwhipped into obedience, Pete gamely approached the bear, and, in an\r\ninstant more, the grizzly was powerless. Dick was on one side of him,\r\nold Bob on the other; and their lassos were drawn so taut he could not\r\nturn either way. If he attempted to attack Bob, he was checked by\r\nDick; and if he rushed upon the latter, old Bob’s lasso stopped him.\r\nThe grizzly’s struggles were desperate; his growls terrific. He tore\r\nat the lassos with his claws, and exerted all his tremendous strength\r\nto break the rawhide ropes, which were drawn as tight as a\r\nbow-string. But the conflict, desperate as it was, lasted only a short\r\ntime. The grizzly’s struggles grew weaker, his growls fainter, and\r\nfinally he sank on the prairie dead. The trappers slackened up their\r\nlassos, and Mr. Winters and the boys, who had closely watched this\r\nsingular contest, rode up to examine their prize.\r\n\r\n“Thar’s your bar, you keerless fellers,” said Dick. “If you don’t let\r\nthese yere varmints alone, you’ll git yourselves in a bad scrape, one\r\nof these days, now, I tell you. A grizzly don’t wait fur a feller to\r\nwalk up an’ shake his fist in his face, an’ say, ‘Do ye want to\r\nfight?’ He b’lieves in makin’ war on every one he sees.”\r\n\r\n“We know that!” replied Archie. “This fellow made at us before we got\r\nnear enough to shoot at him.”\r\n\r\n“Then you did mean to fight him, did you?” asked the trapper, as he\r\nand old Bob began to skin the bear. “Wal, it aint every feller that\r\nwould keer ’bout meddlin’ with a grizzly so long as the critter let\r\nhim alone. I’ve seed trappers--an’ brave ones, too--that would\r\nshoulder their we’pons an’ walk off if they happened to come acrost a\r\nbar. It aint allers fun to hang a grizzly, neither; fur if your hoss\r\nfalls down, or your lasso breaks, you’re a’most sartin to go under.\r\nI’ve seed more ’n one poor chap pawed up ’cause his hoss warn’t quick\r\nenough to git out of the varmint’s reach.”\r\n\r\nIn this way the trapper talked to the boys until the skin of the\r\ngrizzly was taken off, when the travelers returned to their camp. As\r\nArchie remarked, it had been “a great day for bears,” and the evening\r\nwas appropriately passed in listening to the stories the trappers\r\nrelated of their adventures with these animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nA Buffalo Hunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the boys seated themselves by the\r\nfire, and while Frank mended his bridle, which Pete had broken the day\r\nbefore, Archie was endeavoring to conjure up some plan for the day’s\r\namusement. Even in that country, which abounded with game, the boys\r\nwere at a loss how to pass the time, for the grizzlies had interfered\r\nwith their arrangements considerably. If they went hunting in the\r\nmountains, they might come across another bear; and their recent\r\nexperience with those animals had shown them that the hunters were\r\nsometimes the hunted. They had no desire for further adventures with\r\nthe monsters, and they had at last decided that they would take a\r\ngallop over the prairie, when they were startled by the clatter of\r\nhorses’ hoofs in the creek, and old Bob--who, at daylight, had\r\nstarted out on a “prospecting” expedition--galloped into camp,\r\nbreathless and excited. The boys very naturally cast their eyes toward\r\nthe prairie, to see if he were not followed by a grizzly; but the\r\nsight of one of those animals never affected the old trapper in that\r\nmanner. He had seen what he considered larger and more profitable\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n“Dick,” he exclaimed, drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk--“Dick,\r\nhave some buffaler hump for dinner?”\r\n\r\n“Sartin,” replied the trapper, hastily rising to his feet, and\r\nthrowing away his pipe. “In course. Saddle up to onct, youngsters.\r\nWe’ll have some game now as is game.”\r\n\r\nThe announcement that there is a herd of buffaloes in the vicinity,\r\nalways creates an uproar in a hunter’s camp, and there was no\r\nexception to the rule this time. The boys had never seen the trapper\r\nso eager; and even Mr. Winters, generally so cool and deliberate, was\r\nnot so long in saddling his horse as usual. This, of course, had an\r\neffect upon the boys; but, as is always the case, their hurry\r\noccasioned them a considerable loss of time. Archie could not find his\r\nbridle, and Frank, in his eagerness, broke his saddle-girth; and, to\r\nincrease their excitement, the others, as soon as they had saddled\r\ntheir horses (Dick rode one of the mules) and secured their weapons,\r\nrode off, leaving them alone. Archie, after a lengthy search, found\r\nhis bridle in the wagon, and Frank at last succeeded in mending his\r\nsaddle-girth with a piece of buckskin. The boys’ rifles stood together\r\nagainst a tree, close by, with all the accouterments hanging to the\r\nmuzzles. Frank’s being a common “patch” rifle, he, of course, had a\r\npowder-horn and bullet pouch, while Archie carried the ammunition for\r\nhis breech-loader in a haversack. The latter was ready first, and\r\nhastily seizing the gun that came first to his hand, secured Frank’s\r\ninstead of his own, and, putting his horse into a gallop, rode down\r\nthe bed of the creek, throwing the powder-horn and bullet pouch over\r\nhis shoulder as he went. Frank was ready a moment afterward, and\r\nfinding his own rifle gone, he, of course, took Archie’s. Although he\r\nthought nothing of it at the time, he afterward looked upon it as a\r\nlucky circumstance. In addition to their rifles, the boys each had two\r\nrevolvers, which they carried in their holsters. Frank overtook the\r\nhunters at the edge of the prairie, where they had stopped to wait\r\nfor him, and to hold a consultation. The high swells that rose in\r\nevery direction shut them out from the view of the game, but old Bob\r\nknew exactly where to go to find it. As they went along, at an easy\r\ngallop, Dick rode up beside the boys, and, addressing himself to\r\nFrank, said:\r\n\r\n“Now, youngster, this’ll be new bisness to you, so don’t be keerless.\r\nYou must ’member that your hoss ar’ as green as a punkin in buffaler\r\nhuntin’, an’, if you let him get stampeded, he’ll take you cl’ar to\r\nMexico afore he stops.”\r\n\r\n“Stampeded!” repeated Frank. “Does a horse ever get stampeded with\r\nbuffaloes?”\r\n\r\n“Sartin he do,” answered the trapper, with a laugh; “an’ if you ever\r\nget teetotally surrounded by a thousand bellerin’, pitchin’ buffalers,\r\nyou’ll say it’s the wust scrape you ever war in. So don’t go too clost\r\nto ’em. If your hoss gets frightened, stop him to onct, and quit\r\nfollerin’ ’em.”\r\n\r\nDick was then proceeding to instruct the boys in the manner of hunting\r\nthe buffaloes, when old Bob, who had been leading the way, suddenly\r\ncame to a halt.\r\n\r\n“They’re jest behind that swell,” said he. “Don’t you hear ’em? Now,\r\nwe must separate.” Then, in hurried whispers, he pointed out the\r\nstation he wished each to occupy, and, after Dick had again cautioned\r\nFrank to keep his horse completely under his control, the boys rode\r\naway in different directions.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank reached his station, he stopped his horse, examined his\r\nrifle, opened his holsters, so that he could readily draw his\r\nrevolvers, and waited impatiently for the signal. The hunters were\r\nstationed about a quarter of a mile apart. Old Bob was in the center\r\nof the line. After satisfying himself that they were all in their\r\nplaces, he waved his hat--the signal for the advance. They all started\r\nat the same moment, and, before Frank could think twice, his horse had\r\ncarried him to the top of the swell, and he was in full view of the\r\ngame. The sight that met his eyes astonished him.\r\n\r\nHe had often read of the prairie being black with buffaloes, but he\r\nhad never seen it before. The herd was an immense one, and stretched\r\naway in all directions as far as his eye could reach. But he was\r\nallowed no time for admiration, for, the moment the hunters made their\r\nappearance, the buffaloes discovered them, and made off at the top of\r\ntheir speed, the noise of their hoofs sounding on the hard prairie\r\nlike the rolling of thunder. Pete was not afraid of buffaloes, and he\r\nsoon carried his master within easy range of the herd, the nearest of\r\nwhich fell at the crack of his rifle. Too impatient to reload his gun,\r\nFrank drew one of his revolvers, and, forgetting, in his excitement,\r\nall the trapper’s advice, spurred after the flying herd; and, so close\r\nwas he to them, that he seldom missed his mark. When he had fired all\r\nthe charges, he returned his empty weapon to his holster, and, as he\r\ndrew the other, he cast his eye in the direction of his companions,\r\nand was a good deal surprised to discover that some of the herd had\r\ngot between him and the rest of his party, and were running almost\r\nside by side with him. On the outer edge of the herd, he saw his\r\ncousin in company with the trappers. Archie had, doubtless, emptied\r\nall his weapons, for he appeared to be engaged in reloading. Further\r\nback, he saw Mr. Winters, who had stopped to “settle” a large bull he\r\nhad wounded. He also noticed that the mule, on which Dick was mounted,\r\nbeing entirely unaccustomed to such business, and frightened by the\r\ndischarges of the fire-arms, and the noise of the rushing herd, was\r\nmaking desperate but unsuccessful attempts to throw his rider. Frank,\r\ntaking this all in at a glance, then turned his attention to the\r\nanimals nearest him, and soon emptied his second revolver.\r\n\r\nAll this while Pete had been running with the bridle hanging loose on\r\nhis neck; now, as Frank gathered up the reins, he noticed, for the\r\nfirst time, that he was going at a rate of speed he had never before\r\naccomplished. This, however, did not alarm him; but, seeing that he\r\nwas leaving his companions behind, he thought he would slacken his\r\npace and wait for them to come up. He drew in the reins, but it had no\r\neffect on the horse, which, looking back over his shoulder, as if\r\nfrightened at something that was pursuing him, bounded off faster than\r\never. Taking a firmer hold of the reins, Frank pulled again with all\r\nhis strength, but to no purpose. Had he been at sea, in an open boat,\r\nwithout rudder, sails, or oars, he could not have been more helpless\r\nthan he was at that moment. His horse, perfectly unmanageable, was\r\nrunning away with him! In an instant, the thought flashed through\r\nFrank’s mind, that he was in the very position the trapper had so\r\nemphatically cautioned him to avoid. But still he was not frightened,\r\nuntil he cast his eyes behind him, and, to his utter dismay,\r\ndiscovered that the herd had closed in on all sides of him. Around his\r\nhorse was a clear space of perhaps a hundred yards in diameter, which\r\nwas slowly but surely growing smaller, as the frightened animals\r\npressed and crowded against each other. On every side he saw a mass of\r\nhorns, and tails, and shaggy shoulders, which, like a wall, shut him\r\naway from his companions. Away off to the right, he saw the trappers,\r\nArchie, and Mr. Winters, no longer pursuing the game, but gazing after\r\nhim, and throwing their arms wildly about. If they shouted, Frank did\r\nnot hear what they said, for the noise of that multitude of hoofs\r\nwould have drowned the roar of Niagara. They could not assist him,\r\nneither could he help himself. That very morning the trapper had told\r\nhim of seeing a man trampled to death by a herd of buffaloes, and now\r\na similar fate was in store for himself. The appalling thought seemed\r\nto deprive him of the last particle of strength, for he reeled in his\r\nsaddle, and only caught the mane of his horse just in time to save\r\nhimself from falling to the ground. But, as was always the case with\r\nFrank, when placed in situations of extreme danger, this burst of\r\nweakness quickly passed. While he had life, he could not relinquish\r\nall hope of being able to bring himself safely out of even this, the\r\nmost perilous position in which he had ever found himself. He could\r\ndetermine upon no particular plan for escape, so long as he was\r\nsurrounded by those frantic buffaloes. The only course he could pursue\r\nwas to compel Pete to keep pace with the herd. But this plan did not\r\nplace him out of the reach of danger. He knew that buffaloes, when\r\nstampeded, turn aside for nothing. Neither hills nor rivers check\r\ntheir mad flight, and any living thing that stands in their way is\r\ntrampled to death. Even the exhausted members of the herd, unable to\r\nkeep pace with the others, are borne down and crushed to a jelly. They\r\nneither seem to hear or see any thing; all their senses being merged\r\ninto the desire to get as far as possible from the object that has\r\nexcited their alarm; and they seldom stop until completely exhausted.\r\n\r\nFrank knew this, and the question that arose in his mind was, “How\r\nlong could his horse stand that rapid gallop?” He appeared to be as\r\nthoroughly frightened as the buffaloes, and it was not at all probable\r\nhe would show any inclination to stop, so long as he saw that shaggy\r\nmass behind him, or could hear the noise of their hoofs, which sounded\r\nlike the rumbling of an immense cataract. The more he thought of his\r\ncritical situation, the firmer was his belief that there was but one\r\nway open to him, and that was to keep ahead of the animals, which were\r\nbehind him. Having determined upon this, he again cast his eyes toward\r\nthe place where he had last seen his friends. They were gone, and\r\nFrank was alone in the midst of that multitude of frantic buffaloes.\r\n\r\nWhen the trappers had discovered Frank’s situation, they knew it was\r\nout of their power to assist him. After following him a short\r\ndistance, in the vain hope of making him hear the words of advice and\r\nencouragement which they sent after him with all the strength of their\r\nlungs, they had fallen back out of sight. Dick had advised this\r\ncourse, “Fur,” said he, “the longer we foller ’em, the faster they’ll\r\nrun. They won’t stop till they’re clean gin out. If the youngster\r\nstays on his hoss, an’ keeps ahead of ’em till they’re a leetle over\r\ntheir fright, he’s all right.”\r\n\r\nDick, however, did not intend to leave his young companion altogether.\r\nAt his request, Archie gave up Sleepy Sam to him, and, after assuring\r\nthe others, who were in a state of intense excitement and alarm, that\r\nhe would certainly find Frank and bring him back safe, he rode off in\r\nthe direction the buffaloes had gone, while the rest of the party\r\nreturned to collect their game.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Pete, rendered frantic by the deafening noise, was carrying\r\nFrank over the prairie at a terrific pace. The young hunter’s alarm\r\nhad somewhat abated, and he appeared as calm as though he was merely\r\ntaking a ride for amusement; but his mind was exceedingly busy, and,\r\nin a very short space of time, he lived over his whole life. He cast\r\nfrequent and anxious glances behind him, but could see no change for\r\nthe better in his situation. The buffaloes, as far as his eye could\r\nreach, pushed and crowded against each other, apparently as frightened\r\nas ever, but taking no notice whatever of the horseman in their midst.\r\nThe space around his horse was gradually growing smaller, which made\r\nFrank shudder when he thought what the result would be if they should\r\nclose in upon him.\r\n\r\nOne hour passed, and still the frightened herd dashed on, with the\r\nfrantic horse and his helpless rider in their midst, without, in the\r\nleast, slackening their pace. Pete was evidently in distress. That mad\r\ngallop was telling on him severely; but, while those buffaloes were\r\nbehind him, all attempts to stop him would have been useless. Another\r\nhour glided by, and, to his joy, Frank discovered that the animals\r\nbehind him were scattering, and that the line of his pursuers was\r\ngrowing thinner. Those in front still ran as fast as ever--no doubt,\r\npushed onward by those behind them, while those in the extreme rear\r\nwere evidently getting over their fright. Frank looked again and\r\nagain, to satisfy himself that he was not mistaken, and he was\r\nconfident that, if his horse could hold out half an hour longer, the\r\nbuffaloes, slowly dividing right and left, would leave a way of escape\r\nopen to him. The minutes seemed lengthened into hours; but his\r\npursuers were now rapidly taking up their places on the flanks of the\r\nherd, and, in a short time, not a buffalo was to be seen behind him.\r\n\r\nAgain Frank pulled the reins, and Pete, almost exhausted, and no\r\nlonger hearing that terrific noise behind him, willingly stopped.\r\nFrank, filled with gratitude for his escape, threw himself from the\r\nsaddle, just as the last of the buffaloes were disappearing over a\r\nneighboring swell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nA Night among the Wolves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to describe Frank’s feelings, as he stood\r\nthere, holding his panting, reeking horse, and listening to that\r\nrumbling sound, which grew fainter and fainter, as the buffaloes\r\ndashed on their way. Now that the danger of being trampled to death\r\nwas passed, he did not stop to think of what was still before him. He\r\ncared not that he was forty miles from the old bear’s hole, and that,\r\nin three hours, the sun would be down, and he compelled to pass the\r\nnight alone on the prairie. All thoughts of what he knew he must\r\nendure before he reached the camp were swallowed up in thankfulness\r\nthat he had been able to bring himself safely out of the most\r\ndangerous position in which he had ever been placed.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the last of the buffaloes had passed out of hearing,\r\nand Frank then turned his attention to his horse.\r\n\r\nPete looked very unlike the sleek, spirited animal of which he had\r\nbeen so proud. He was reeking with sweat, panting loudly, and was\r\nevidently very nearly exhausted. Had he been obliged to carry his\r\nrider a few miles further, Frank might have been compelled to find his\r\nway back to camp on foot. Pete was also very much in need of water;\r\nand now that the danger was over, Frank found that he, too, was very\r\nthirsty. During his excitement and alarm he had not thought of it; but\r\nnow that he was able to think calmly, he decided that his first care\r\nshould be to find a stream of water, where he might quench his thirst.\r\n\r\nAfter reloading his rifle and revolvers, he again took Pete by the\r\nbridle and led him in the direction of the mountains, which, as near\r\nas he could judge, were twenty miles distant. Although he was most\r\nanxious to reach them before night, in hopes that he might find the\r\ntrapper, (for he knew that Dick would not rest easy until he had found\r\nhim,) he could not bear the thought of riding his horse while he was\r\nin such distress.\r\n\r\nAt length he reached the top of a swell, when he paused to look about\r\nhim. On his right hand, about a mile distant, as he judged, he saw a\r\nlong line of willows, which (so the trappers had told him) were a sure\r\nsign of water. Toward the willows, then, he directed his course, in\r\nhopes that his horse, when he had quenched his thirst and eaten a few\r\nmouthfuls of grass, would be in a condition to travel. But he soon\r\nfound that it was more than a mile to the willows--it was five times\r\nthat distance--and it was about an hour before sunset when Frank\r\nreached the stream, and, kneeling down on the bank, took a long,\r\nrefreshing drink. Here he had a most lively battle with Pete. The\r\nhorse was stubborn, and when he had determined upon a course, it\r\nrequired considerable persuasion to induce him to abandon it. He\r\nwanted to drink his fill of the water at once, to which Frank\r\nobjected; and it was not until Pete had received several severe blows\r\nfrom a branch that his master cut from one of the willows, that he\r\nallowed himself to be led out of the stream. Frank then tied him to a\r\ntree, removed the saddle, and threw himself on the ground to determine\r\nupon his future movements. He was tired and hungry; he did not like\r\nthe idea of camping on the prairie alone, but he could see no way to\r\navoid it. Then he thought of the trapper, and walked out on the\r\nprairie to look for him. But Dick was nowhere to be seen. Had Frank\r\nremained where he had escaped from the buffaloes, he would then have\r\nbeen in the company of his friend, for the trapper was at that moment\r\nstanding on the top of the very swell, where Frank had stood when he\r\nfirst discovered the willows. Useless sat by his side, looking up into\r\nhis master’s face, and whining as if he, too, wondered what had become\r\nof the object of their search. Seeing no signs of Frank, Dick\r\nconcluded that he was still among the buffaloes, so he kept on after\r\nthem, now and then shaking his head and muttering--“The keerless\r\nfeller. It beats all natur’ how that hoss of his’n traveled.” But\r\nFrank did not know that Dick was so near him, and, after waiting\r\nnearly an hour for him to make his appearance, he returned to the\r\nwillows, and sat about making his preparations for the night. He first\r\nselected a suitable spot for a camp, and, after gathering a few dry\r\nbranches and lighting a fire with a flint and steel he found in\r\nArchie’s haversack, he took his rifle and walked along the bank of\r\nthe creek to find something for his supper. He generally took great\r\npleasure in a hunt, but there was no sport in this one, for he could\r\nnot help thinking of his recent adventure with the grizzly. What if he\r\nshould meet one of those animals? He could not hope for assistance\r\nfrom the trapper. He had no one to depend upon but himself. He had\r\nalways had great confidence in his skill as a marksman, but he had\r\nnever wished for an opportunity to try it on a grizzly bear. If there\r\nwere any of those animals among the willows, he did not encounter\r\nthem, and, in fact, the woods did not appear to abound in game of any\r\nkind. The only living thing he discovered was a raccoon crossing the\r\ncreek on a log just ahead of him.\r\n\r\nFrank, knowing that he was working for his supper, made a good shot,\r\nand when he shouldered the ’coon and started for his camp, he felt\r\nrelieved to know that he was not compelled to pass the night hungry.\r\nHe had often heard that the flesh of the ’coon was excellent, and he\r\nfound it was so; whether it was because he was hungry, or because the\r\nmeat was really good, he could not decide; but at any rate, he ate\r\nnearly half the ’coon, and hung the remainder upon a limb to save it\r\nfor his breakfast. Then, after gathering a supply of firewood,\r\nsufficient to last all night, he again walked out on the prairie to\r\nlook for the trapper. But he was not in sight; and when it began to\r\ngrow dark, Frank returned to his camp, feeling rather lonesome. After\r\nhe had hobbled Pete, (which he did by tying one end of his halter\r\naround his neck, and the other to one of his fore legs,) and turned\r\nhim loose to graze, he seated himself by the fire, and heartily wished\r\nit was morning.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing pleasant in the thought that he was obliged to pass\r\nthe night alone. He had often camped out, but he was not accustomed to\r\nliving in such a wilderness. Had Dick been with him, he would have\r\nslept as soundly as he ever did at home; but, as it was, there was no\r\nprobability of his enjoying a good night’s rest. It grew dark rapidly,\r\nand the prairie, so deserted and still in the day-time, now seemed to\r\nbe crowded with wolves. He had heard them every night since he had\r\nbeen on the plains, but he had never listened to such a chorus as\r\nsaluted his ears that evening. The fact was, they had been attracted\r\nby a buffalo that lay but a short distance from Frank’s camp. It had\r\nbeen wounded by the hunters in the morning, and, becoming separated\r\nfrom the herd, had come to the creek for water, and died. Frank knew\r\nthat the wolves had found something, for he could hear them growling\r\nand fighting over their meal. Suddenly they all set up a howl, and\r\ntook to their heels. They did not go far, however, but appeared to be\r\nrunning in circles about their prey, as if they had been driven away\r\nby some larger animal. Frank was not pleased with his neighbors, and\r\ndid not feel at all inclined to go to sleep. He sat before his fire,\r\nwith his rifle across his knees, and his revolvers close at hand,\r\nsincerely hoping that the wolves would not approach his camp. For two\r\nhours he remained in this position, and finally, becoming more\r\naccustomed to the howls of the wolves, he leaned against a tree, and\r\nwas fast losing all consciousness of what was going on around him,\r\nwhen he was aroused by his horse, which came snorting through the\r\nwillows, and did not stop until he had placed himself close to his\r\nmaster for protection. This alarmed Frank, who, remembering how Pete\r\nhad acted the day before, was certain that there was a grizzly bear\r\nprowling about his camp; and, fearful that his horse, if left to\r\nhimself, would run away, he slipped the bridle over his head, and\r\ntied him securely to a tree. While thus engaged, he heard a slight\r\nnoise in the bushes, as if some heavy animal was endeavoring to pass\r\ncarefully through them. This continued for half an hour, during which\r\nthe animal, whatever it was, walked entirely around his camp. This\r\ntried Frank’s nerves severely. To sit there, in those woods, and\r\nlisten to some animal walking about, perhaps watching for an\r\nopportunity to spring upon him, was almost as bad as facing a grizzly.\r\nAgain and again the animal made the circuit of the camp, and presently\r\nFrank saw a pair of eyes, that looked like two coals of fire, glaring\r\nat him through the darkness. Should he fire at the animal? If it was a\r\ngrizzly, and the wound should not prove fatal, his life would not be\r\nworth a moment’s purchase. There might be bushes between him and the\r\nbeast, that would glance the ball, or his hand might prove unsteady.\r\nIt was a risk he did not like to take; but he could try the effect of\r\nfire on him. So, catching up a brand, he threw it at the eyes, which\r\ninstantly disappeared.\r\n\r\nDuring the livelong night did Frank sit by the fire, holding his rifle\r\nin his hands, now and then caressing his horse, which stood close\r\nbeside him, trembling with fear; while, at regular intervals, he heard\r\na rustling in the willows, which told him that his enemy was still on\r\nthe watch.\r\n\r\nBut all things have an end. At length, to Frank’s immense relief, day\r\nbegan to dawn. As soon as he could distinctly discern the nearest\r\nobjects, he again hobbled his horse, and, after turning him loose to\r\ngraze, began to prepare his breakfast. After he had cooked and eaten\r\nthe last vestige of the ’coon, he saddled Pete, and, turning his back\r\nupon the place where he had passed a most uncomfortable night, set out\r\ntoward the mountains.\r\n\r\nAbout the same hour, the trapper arose from the prairie, where he had\r\nmade his camp, and where he had slept soundly, in spite of the howling\r\nof the wolves, and, mounting Sleepy Sam, began to follow up the trail\r\nof the buffaloes. Each was looking for the other, and both were\r\ntraveling in exactly opposite directions.\r\n\r\nFrank had a long ride before him, and it was monotonous and tiresome.\r\nPete appeared to have fully recovered from the effects of his long\r\nrun, for he carried his rider at a rapid pace; but, at sunset, Frank\r\nhad not reached the mountains. He could not bear the thought of\r\ncamping on that bare prairie, where he could have no fire, and he\r\nresolved to ride until he reached the timber at the base of the\r\nmountains, if it took him until midnight. Darkness settled down over\r\nthe prairie, and, a short time afterward, he reached the woods. As he\r\nrode slowly along, in the hope of discovering some stream, on the\r\nbanks of which he could camp, he saw a light shining through the\r\ntrees. A second look showed him that it was a camp-fire. No doubt he\r\nwould find Dick there. Without hesitating an instant, he put spurs to\r\nhis horse, and rode up in full view of the fire, around which he saw\r\nfour men lying on their blankets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nFrank’s New Acquaintances.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank’s sudden appearance created considerable of a commotion in the\r\ncamp, for the men sprang to their feet and reached rather hurriedly\r\nfor their weapons. They were evidently alarmed; and Frank was a good\r\ndeal surprised thereat, for he had not dreamed that men accustomed to\r\nthe dangers of the prairie--as these undoubtedly were--could be\r\nfrightened at the sudden approach of a single bewildered horseman. He,\r\nhowever, rode straight up to the fire, where the men stood with their\r\nrifles in their hands, and exclaimed, as he dismounted from his horse:\r\n\r\n“Good evening, gentlemen!”\r\n\r\nHis politeness did not serve to allay the fears of the men, for they\r\nregarded him sharply for a moment, and then one of them asked, in a\r\nvoice that somewhat resembled the growl of an enraged bear:\r\n\r\n“What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“I am lost,” replied Frank. “My horse was stampeded with a herd of\r\nbuffaloes, and I am now making the best of my way back to my friends.”\r\n\r\nThe man slowly surveyed him from head to foot, and then answered, in a\r\ntone of voice which showed that he did not believe Frank’s statement:\r\n\r\n“Lost! Lost, aint ye? Wal, what in tarnation are ye lost fur? Why\r\ndon’t ye go whar ye b’long?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I want to do!” replied Frank, who, astonished at the\r\nmanner in which he was received, and fearful that he would be\r\ncompelled to pass another night alone on the prairie, did not notice\r\nthe sly, meaning glances which the men exchanged. “I am trying to find\r\nmy friends. I left them at the ‘old bear’s hole,’ if you know where\r\nthat is.”\r\n\r\nThis statement was received with something like a long breath of\r\nrelief by the trappers--for such they undoubtedly were--and the\r\nspokesman continued:\r\n\r\n“Then, ye’re sartin ye’re lost, an’ that ye aint got no friends\r\nnigher nor the ole bar’s hole? Who war ye travelin’ with? Who’s yer\r\ncomp’ny?”\r\n\r\n“Dick Lewis and old Bob Kelly,” replied Frank, mentioning the names of\r\nthe guides, with the hope that some of his new acquaintances might\r\nknow them; nor was the hope a vain one, for the trappers repeated the\r\nnames, and again exchanged those sly glances, which Frank noticed but\r\ncould not understand:\r\n\r\n“So ole Bob is yer comp’ny,” said his questioner, at length; “an’\r\nye’re sartin ye left him at the ole bar’s hole! Then, ye won’t be\r\nlikely to set eyes on him to-night, ’cause the bar’s hole ar’ a good\r\nfifty mile from here, an’, if ye’re actooally an’ sartinly lost, ye\r\naint no ways likely to find it in the dark.”\r\n\r\nThe trapper was evidently forgetting his fears and recovering his good\r\nnature--if he possessed that quality--for, as he resumed his seat at\r\nthe fire, he continued, in a somewhat milder tone:\r\n\r\n“If yer hoss war stampeded, stranger, he must be powerful lively on\r\nhis legs to have tuk ye so fur; but, I reckon, ye must be travelin’ a\r\nleetle out of yer latitude. It aint often that a feller meets a\r\nteetotal stranger in these parts what says he’s lost, an’ we don’t\r\nlike to take in every one as comes along; but, if so be that ye are a\r\nfriend of Dick an’ ole Bob, ye can hobble yer hoss an’ camp here with\r\nus. Ye can sleep by our fire to-night, an’ in the mornin’ we’ll set\r\nyer on the right track.”\r\n\r\nFrank gladly complied with this invitation, and, after relieving his\r\nhorse of the saddle, he seated himself at the fire, and began to make\r\na close examination of his new acquaintances. They were all large,\r\nmuscular men, and were dressed in complete suits of buckskin, which\r\nwere very ragged and dirty. Their faces were almost covered with\r\nthick, bushy whiskers, and their hair, which, judging by its tangled\r\nappearance, had never been made acquainted with a comb, hung down to\r\ntheir shoulders. The man who had acted the part of spokesman, was\r\nparticularly noticeable, being more ragged and dirty than his\r\ncompanions, and his face, which bore several ugly scars, was almost as\r\nblack as a negro’s.\r\n\r\nIn short, they were a very ferocious looking set, and Frank almost\r\nwished he had remained on the prairie instead of coming to their camp.\r\nBut, after all, he might be very much mistaken in his men. It was not\r\nto be expected that persons of their calling, who had no doubt lived\r\non the prairie from boyhood, who had been exposed to all kinds of\r\nweather, and braved innumerable dangers, it could not be expected that\r\nsuch men should always present a neat appearance. Beneath their rough\r\nexterior there might be hidden the warmest of hearts. And as for their\r\nreception of him, they had doubtless treated him as they treated every\r\nstranger they met on the prairie--on the principle, “Believe every man\r\nan enemy, until he proves himself otherwise.”\r\n\r\nWhile these thoughts were passing through Frank’s mind, the trappers\r\nhad been regarding him closely and with evident curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe result of their examination appeared to be satisfactory, for the\r\nspokesman presently remarked:\r\n\r\n“It’s plain, stranger, that yer out of yer callin’. Ye don’t b’long on\r\nthe prairy. Yer from the States, we take it.”\r\n\r\nFrank replied that he was, and then proceeded to give the trappers an\r\naccount of the circumstances that had brought him to the prairie, and\r\nalso told how he had made the acquaintance of Dick and old Bob; to all\r\nof which the men listened eagerly, now and then exchanging the same\r\nsly glances that Frank had before noticed. When he had finished his\r\nstory, the swarthy trapper arose to his feet, and, going to a tree\r\nclose by, took down a piece of buffalo meat, from which he cut several\r\nslices that he placed on the coals, remarking as he did so:\r\n\r\n“Whenever we do meet a stranger in these parts, an’ he turns out to be\r\nthe right kind of a chap, we allers treat him as handsome as we know\r\nhow. We can’t offer you anything more’n a chunk of buffaler hump, but\r\nsich as we have yer welcome to.”\r\n\r\nThe offer was evidently made in all sincerity, and if Frank still\r\nentertained any fears that the men were not what they should be, he\r\nspeedily dismissed them, and again blessed his lucky stars that he was\r\nnot compelled to pass another night alone on the prairie.\r\n\r\nWhile his supper was cooking, he was again plied with questions, the\r\nmost of them relating to the movements of old Bob; and especially did\r\nthe trappers seem anxious to learn where he was going, and what he\r\nintended to do when he returned from California. Frank answered these\r\nquestions as well as he could, and his replies seemed to satisfy the\r\nmen, one of whom finally changed the subject of the conversation, by\r\nremarking:\r\n\r\n“I’ll allow that’s a fine shootin’ iron of your’n, stranger, but it’s\r\na new-fangled consarn, I should say.”\r\n\r\nFrank, it will be remembered, had Archie’s rifle, which, being a\r\nbreech-loading weapon, was something the trappers had never seen\r\nbefore, and it required considerable explanation to enable them to\r\nunderstand “how the consarn worked.”\r\n\r\nFrom his rifle they went to the other articles of his “kit.” The\r\ncontents of his haversack were examined, the qualities of his\r\nhunting-knife and revolvers discussed, and then they turned their\r\nattention to his horse--made inquiries concerning his speed and\r\nbottom, until, weary with their questioning, they stretched themselves\r\nout by the fire and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nAfter eating his supper, Frank followed their example; and, being\r\ncompletely exhausted, having scarcely closed his eyes during the\r\npreceding night, he slept soundly until morning.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke it was just daylight. The trappers had already arisen;\r\nthe fire had been replenished, and several slices of meat were\r\nbroiling on the coals.\r\n\r\nThey hardly noticed Frank; the only reply his polite greetings\r\nreceived, being a sort of grunt and a slight nod of the head. After\r\nwashing his hands and face in the creek that ran close by--a\r\nproceeding which the trappers regarded with undisguised contempt--he\r\nseated himself at the fire with the others and began helping himself\r\nto the meat, at the same time inquiring the way to the old bear’s\r\nhole.\r\n\r\n“That ar’ is the way, stranger,” replied the swarthy trapper, pointing\r\nin a direction exactly contrary to the one Frank had pursued the day\r\nbefore; “an’, as I told ye last night, it’s nigh on to fifty miles\r\noff.”\r\n\r\nAfter this, they again relapsed into silence, and as soon as they had\r\nfinished their breakfast, went out to catch their horses. Frank\r\naccompanied them; all his old fears that there was something wrong,\r\nrevived with redoubled force, and he was anxious to leave the company\r\nof his new acquaintances as soon as possible. When he had caught and\r\nsaddled Pete, he left him standing for a few moments, until he secured\r\nhis rifle and haversack, and when he turned to mount, he saw one of\r\nthe trappers seize the horse by the bridle and spring into the saddle.\r\nFrank gazed in surprise at these movements, but before he could speak,\r\nthe swarthy trapper turned suddenly upon him, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“Look a here, stranger! Ye come here last night without nobody’s\r\naskin’ ye, an’ tells us some kind of a story ’bout yer bein’ lost, an’\r\nall that. Now, mebbe yer all right, an’ mebbe ye aint. Ye may have\r\nfriends no great way off, that ye kalkerlate to bring down on us; but\r\nye can’t ketch old foxes like us in no sich trap as that ar’. We’re\r\njest goin’ to take yer hoss to keep yer from findin’ yer friends ag’in\r\nin a hurry. Yer young fur sich bisness as this yere, an’ if ye didn’t\r\nlook so mighty innercent, I’d split yer wizzen fur ye. So now be off\r\nto onct, an’ don’t never cross our trail ag’in. If ye do--” The\r\ntrapper finished the sentence by shaking his head threateningly.\r\n\r\nFrank listened to this speech in utter bewilderment. He could scarcely\r\nbelieve his ears. But it was plain that the trappers were in earnest,\r\nfor the one who had mounted Pete held his own horse by the bridle, in\r\nreadiness to start. He fully realized his helpless situation, and it\r\nalmost overpowered him. But, at length, he found courage to say:\r\n\r\n“You are certainly mistaken. I _am_ lost. I don’t know where to go to\r\nfind my friends, and, if you take my horse from me, I may never find\r\nthem again. Besides, what is your object in robbing me?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, now, stranger,” said the trapper, dropping the butt of his rifle\r\nto the ground, and leaning upon the muzzle of the weapon, “we jest\r\naint a goin’ to stand no foolin’. We b’lieve yer a spy, an’ ar’ goin’\r\nto bring Bob Kelly an’ the rest of yer friends down on us. That’s jest\r\nwhat’s the matter. The prairy is cl’ar, thar aint no Injuns to\r\nmassacree ye; ye have a good pair of legs, so trot off on ’em to onct.\r\nYe can be glad enough that we didn’t tie ye up to a tree, an’ leave ye\r\nto the wolves. If ole Kelly could get his hands on us, we’d be used a\r\nheap wusser nor robbin’, an’ you know it well enough. An’ when ye see\r\nthe ole chap, ye can tell him that the next time he wants to try to\r\nketch Black Bill, he’ll have to get up a better trick nor this yere.\r\nCome, now, mizzle--sally out to onct--an’ don’t stop to talk, ’cause\r\nit won’t do no arthly good whatsomever. Yer hoss is gone--that’s\r\nsettled--an’, if yer shootin’ iron were any ’count, we’d a tuk that\r\ntoo. We’ve left ye three loads, an’ that’ll kill game enough to do ye\r\ntill ye find yer friends. Come, walk off--make yourself skeerce,\r\nsudden.”\r\n\r\nThere was a wicked, determined look in the trapper’s eye that told\r\nFrank that he was in earnest; and, fully convinced that it would be\r\nuseless to remonstrate, and fearful that if he did not obey the order,\r\nthe man would fulfill his threat of tying him to a tree, and leaving\r\nhim to the mercy of the wolves, he shouldered his rifle, and, with a\r\nheavy heart, set off on his journey.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the top of a high swell, about half a mile from the\r\ncamp, he looked back, and saw the trappers riding off at a rapid\r\ngallop, Pete playing and prancing with his new rider as if he was\r\nperfectly satisfied with the change. Frank watched them as long as\r\nthey remained in sight, and then, throwing himself on the ground,\r\ncovered his face with his hands, and gave away to the most bitter\r\nthoughts. What could have induced the trappers to act so\r\ntreacherously? Did they really suspect him of being a spy, or was that\r\nmerely an excuse to rob him in his defenseless situation? The whole\r\ntransaction was involved in a mystery he could not fathom, nor was it\r\nat all probable that he could arrive at a solution until he should see\r\nDick or old Bob Kelly. Would he ever see them again, was a question he\r\ndare not ask himself. The chances were certainly not in his favor,\r\nsituated as he was, alone, in the midst of an unbroken wilderness, the\r\nprairie stretching away, on one hand, as far as his eye could reach,\r\nthe Rocky Mountains looming up on the other. But he was not one to\r\nlook altogether upon the dark side of the picture. It had a bright\r\nside as well, and he found that he had reason to congratulate himself\r\nthat the outlaws--for such he now knew them to be--had let him off so\r\neasily. What if they had left him bound to a tree, as they had\r\nthreatened? The chances were not one in a hundred that he would ever\r\nhave been released. Although his horse had been taken from him, he had\r\nbeen allowed to go free, and to retain his rifle and hunting-knife.\r\nYes, his situation might have been infinitely worse. He still had much\r\nto be grateful for, and, as long as he had life, he would cherish the\r\nhope of being able to find his way to his friends. As these thoughts\r\npassed through his mind, they brought renewed strength and\r\ndetermination, and, rising to his feet, he again set out at a brisk\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that the outlaws had told him that, in order to reach\r\nthe old bear’s hole, he must travel in a direction exactly opposite to\r\nthe one he was pursuing; but he had good reason to believe that they\r\nhad endeavored to mislead him. When he took his involuntary ride, he\r\nwas careful to remember the points of the compass, and, as Pete had\r\ncarried him exactly south, of course, in order to reach his friends,\r\nhe must travel north. He had no compass, but the sun was just rising,\r\nand he was able to calculate all the points from that. Having settled\r\nthis to his satisfaction, he began an examination of his haversack,\r\nand found that its contents had been thoroughly overhauled--no doubt\r\nwhile he was asleep--and that the outlaws had left him three\r\ncartridges for his rifle, and his flint and steel. All the other\r\narticles, which consisted of several rounds of ammunition for his\r\nrevolvers (which had gone off with his horse), stone arrow-heads,\r\nspear-heads, the claws of the bear that Dick had killed in the cave,\r\nand numerous other relics which Archie had collected since leaving St.\r\nJoseph, had all been abstracted.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his unpleasant situation, Frank could not repress a smile,\r\nwhen he thought how indignant his cousin would be, when he received an\r\naccount of his losses. Having completed his examination, and placed\r\nhis remaining cartridges carefully away in his pocket, he resumed his\r\njourney, and, just as he reached the top of a swell, he discovered a\r\nhorseman galloping rapidly along the edge of the willows that fringed\r\nthe base of the mountains. The thought that he saw something familiar,\r\nabout both the horse and his rider, had scarcely passed through\r\nFrank’s mind, when he was electrified by the sight of a large brindle\r\ndog, which ran in and out of the bushes, with his nose close to the\r\nground, now and then uttering an impatient bark, which was answered by\r\nyells of encouragement from the horseman. There was no mistaking that\r\nyell, and Frank ran down the swell, swinging his hat, and endeavoring\r\nto attract the attention of the man with a voice which, in his\r\nexcitement, he could scarcely raise above a whisper. But he was\r\ndiscovered. Both dog and horseman turned toward him, and, a moment\r\nafterward, Frank had one arm around the neck of Useless, and his hand\r\nwas inclosed in the trapper’s vice-like grasp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nThe Trader’s Expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Dick,” exclaimed Frank, as soon as he could speak, “this is the\r\nsecond time you have found me when lost; but I wish you had come a\r\nlittle sooner, for--”\r\n\r\n“You keerless feller!” interrupted the trapper, who knew in a moment\r\nthat there was something wrong, “you teetotally keerless feller!\r\nwhar’s your hoss? Tell me, to onct, what’s come on him.”\r\n\r\n“He was stolen from me,” answered Frank. “I camped last night about\r\ntwo miles from here, with a party of trappers, and they robbed me.”\r\n\r\n“Did!” exclaimed Dick. “Bar and buffaler! who war they? They warn’t no\r\ntrappers, I can tell ye, if they done that ar’ mean trick. Tell me all\r\nabout it to onct.”\r\n\r\nFrank then proceeded to relate all that had transpired at the camp;\r\ntold how closely the men had questioned him concerning the intended\r\nmovements of old Bob; repeated all the threats which the outlaw had\r\nmade, and concluded his narrative with saying:\r\n\r\n“He told me that when I saw old Bob again, I could say to him, that\r\nthe next time he wanted to catch Black Bill, he--”\r\n\r\n“Black Bill!” almost yelled the trapper. “Black Bill! That ar’ tells\r\nthe hul story. The scoundrel had better steer cl’ar of me an’ old Bob,\r\n’cause I’m Bob’s chum now, an’ any harm that’s done to him is done to\r\nme too. I can tell you, you keerless feller, you oughter be mighty\r\nglad that you aint rubbed out altogether.”\r\n\r\n“I begin to think so too,” replied Frank; “but, Dick, I want my\r\nhorse.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, then, you’ll have to wait till he comes to you, or till them ar’\r\nfellers git ready to fetch him back. ’Taint no ’arthly use to foller\r\n’em, ’cause they’ll be sartin to put a good stretch of country atween\r\nthem an’ ole Bob afore they stop. Your hoss ar’ teetotally gone,\r\nyoungster--that’s as true as gospel. I tell you ag’in, ’taint every\r\none that Black Bill let’s off so easy. Climb up behind me, an’ let’s\r\ntravel back to the ole bar’s hole.”\r\n\r\nFrank handed his rifle to his companion, mounted Sleepy Sam, and the\r\ntrappers drove toward the camp, slowly and thoughtfully. For nearly an\r\nhour they rode along without speaking to each other. Dick,\r\noccasionally shaking his head and muttering “Bar an’ buffaler--you\r\n_keerless_ feller.” But at length he straitened up in the saddle, and\r\nholding his heavy rifle at arm’s length, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Youngster, I don’t own much of this world’s plunder, an’ what’s more,\r\nI never expect to. But what little I have got is of use to me, an’\r\nwithout it I should soon starve. But I’d give it all up sooner nor\r\nsleep in a camp with Black Bill an’ his band of rascals. I’d fight ’em\r\nnow if I should meet ’em, an’ be glad of the chance; but thar’s a heap\r\nof difference atween goin’ under, in a fair skrimmage, an’ bein’\r\nrubbed out while you ar’ asleep. Durin’ the forty year I’ve been\r\nknocked about, I’ve faced a’most every kind of danger from wild Injuns\r\nan’ varmints, an’ I never onct flinched--till I rid on them steam\r\nrailroads--but, youngster, I wouldn’t do what you done last night fur\r\nnothin’. Howsomever, the danger’s all over now, an’ you have come out\r\nwith a hul skin; so tell me what you done while you war lost.”\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the trapper spoke of the danger through which he\r\nhad passed, frightened Frank exceedingly. He knew that Dick was as\r\nbrave as a man could possibly be, and the thought that he had\r\nunconsciously exposed himself to peril that the reckless trapper would\r\nshrink from encountering, occasioned feelings of terror, which could\r\nnot be quieted even by the knowledge that he had passed the ordeal\r\nwith safety; and when, in compliance with the guide’s request, he\r\nproceeded to relate his adventures, it was with a trembling voice,\r\nthat could not fail to attract the trapper’s attention.\r\n\r\n“I don’t wonder you’re skeered,” said he, as Frank finished his story.\r\n“It would skeer a’most any body. But it’s over, now, an’ it aint no\r\nways likely you’ll ever meet ’em ag’in. Me an’ ole Bob will see ’em\r\nsome day, an’ when we settle with ’em, we will be sartin to take out\r\npay fur that hoss. When we git to camp Bob’ll tell you how he happens\r\nto owe Black Bill a settlement. When we seed you goin’ off in that ar’\r\nway,” continued the trapper, turning around in his saddle so as to\r\nface Frank, “we didn’t feel no ways skeery ’bout your comin’ back all\r\nright, if you got away from the buffalers. Your uncle said, ‘In course\r\nthe boy has got sense enough to see that the mountains now ar’ on his\r\nright hand, an’ to know that when he wants to come back, he must keep\r\nthem on his left hand;’ an’ jest afore he went to sleep, I heered him\r\nsay to ole Bob, ‘I wonder how Frank is gettin’ on without his\r\nblanket.’ Your little cousin said, ‘I hope he’ll fetch back my rifle,\r\nan’ my possible-sack, an’ the things what’s in it, all right, ’cause I\r\nshould hate to lose them Injun’s top-knots.’ I guess he won’t laugh\r\nnone, when he finds out that all them stone arrer-heads, an’\r\nspear-heads, an’ other fixin’s ar’ gone. Ole Bob, he knowed, too, that\r\nyou would turn up all right if you could keep on your hoss till he\r\nstopped. But, bar and buffaler! we didn’t think you war goin’ to camp\r\nwith that varlet, Black Bill. If we had, thar wouldn’t have been much\r\nsleepin’ done in our camp last night.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus assured Frank that his friends had entertained no fears of\r\nhis ability to find his way back to the wagon, the trapper again\r\nalluded to the subject of the robbery, obliging his young companion to\r\nrelate the particulars over and over again, each time expressing his\r\nastonishment and indignation in no very measured terms. In this way\r\nthey passed the fifteen miles that lay between them and the camp, and\r\nfinally arrived within sight of the “ole bar’s hole.”\r\n\r\nMr. Winters, Archie, and Bob were seated on the ground near the wagon,\r\nbut when they discovered the trapper riding toward them with Frank\r\nmounted behind him, they rose to their feet in surprise, and Archie\r\ninquired, as he grasped his cousin’s hand--\r\n\r\n“Did your horse run himself to death?”\r\n\r\nBefore Frank could answer, Dick sprang from the saddle, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“Bob! Black Bill’s on the prairy.”\r\n\r\n“Black Bill on the prairy!” repeated the old man, slowly, regarding\r\nhis friend as if he was hardly prepared to believe what he had heard.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he ar’ on this yere very prairy,” replied Dick; “an’, Bob,” he\r\ncontinued, stretching his brawny arms to their fullest extent in front\r\nof him, and clenching his huge fists, “an’, Bob, that ar’ keerless\r\nfeller actooally camped with him an’ his rascally chums, last night.\r\nYes, sir, staid in their camp an’ slept thar, an’ this mornin’ they\r\nsaid as how he war a spy of your’n, sent to ketch ’em; so they stole\r\nhis hoss.”\r\n\r\nOld Bob was so astonished at this intelligence, that he almost leaped\r\nfrom the ground; while Dick, without allowing the excited listeners an\r\nopportunity to ask a question, seated himself beside Mr. Winters and\r\nproceeded to give a full account of all that had transpired at Black\r\nBill’s camp; during which, Archie, surprised and indignant at the\r\ntreatment his cousin had received, learned that he also had been a\r\nheavy loser by the operation. All his beloved relics were gone. But\r\nthey still had miles of Indian country to traverse, and these could be\r\nreplaced; while Frank, in being robbed of his horse had sustained a\r\nloss that could not be made good. Archie was generous; and, declaring\r\nthat he had ridden on horseback until he was actually tired of it,\r\ntold his cousin to consider Sleepy Sam as his own property, an offer\r\nwhich the latter emphatically refused to accept.\r\n\r\n“Never mind, youngster,” said old Bob, who had listened to all that\r\nhad passed between the cousins, “never mind. You shan’t lose nothin’\r\nby bein’ robbed by that varlet. Me an’ Dick will put you on hossback\r\nag’in afore you’re two days older. But this yere shows you that you\r\noughtn’t to make friends with every feller you meet on the prairy, no\r\nmore’n you would in a big city. Now if you war lost in the\r\nsettlements, and didn’t know whar to go to find your hum, you would\r\nthink twice afore you would camp with a teetotal stranger, an’ a\r\nfeller oughter do the same thing on the prairy. I larnt that long ago,\r\nan’ through that same feller, Black Bill. Years ago, when Dick’s old\r\nman war alive, it warn’t so. If a feller got a leetle out of his\r\nreckonin’, an’ walked into a stranger’s camp, he could roll himself up\r\nin his blanket an’ sleep as safe an’ sound as he could any whar, an’\r\nneither man warn’t afraid that the other would rub him out afore\r\ndaylight. But it aint so now. Them fellers in the settlements got to\r\ndoin’ meanness, an’ run here to git cl’ar of the laws. But they found\r\nthar war law here too; an’ when they done any of their badness, an’ we\r\ngot our hands on ’em, we made short work with ’em. But they kept\r\ncomin’ in fast, and when three or four of ’em got together, they would\r\ntake to the mountains, an’ thar warn’t no use tryin’ to ketch ’em.\r\nWhen we seed how things war agoin’, a lot of us ole trappers, that had\r\nknowed each other fur years, made up a comp’ny. We had to do it to\r\ndefend ourselves ag’in them varlets, fur it soon got so it warn’t\r\nhealthy fur a lone man on the prairy, if he had any plunder wuth\r\nbaggin’. We stuck together till that Saskatchewan scrape, an’ now me\r\nan’ Dick ar’ the only ones left. I don’t say that we’re the only\r\nhonest trappers agoin’, ’cause that aint so. Thar ar’ plenty of good\r\nones left; but we ar’ the last of our comp’ny, an’, somehow, we don’t\r\nkeer ’bout trappin’ with strangers.\r\n\r\n“Wal, one spring we went to the fort to trade off the spelter we had\r\nketched durin’ the winter, an’ the trader we sold ’em to, war makin’\r\nup a comp’ny to go to the head waters of the Missouri. He war goin’\r\nwith his expedition, an’ he wanted us to go too. He offered us good\r\npay; he would find us we’pons, hosses, traps, and provender fur\r\nnothin’, an’ buy our furs to boot. He done this ’cause thar war a good\r\nmany traders workin’ ag’in him, an’ he wanted to be sartin of gittin’\r\nall the furs we trapped. We had a leetle talk among ourselves about\r\nit, an’, finally, told him that it war a bargain, an’ that we would\r\ngo. So he writ down our names, an’ we tuk up our quarters in the fort\r\ntill the day come to start. The trader’s name war Forbes, an’ as he\r\nwar our boss, we used to call him Cap’n Forbes. He warn’t jest the\r\nkind of a man a feller would take to be a trader--he smelt too much of\r\nthe settlements--an’ even at the fort, among rough trappers an’\r\nsoldiers, he would spruce up an’ strut like a turkey. ’Sides, he had a\r\nnigger to wait on him an’ take keer of his hoss. As I war sayin’, we\r\nnoticed all these things, but we didn’t keer fur ’em, fur, in course,\r\nit warn’t none of our consarn; all we wanted war fur him to pay us fur\r\nthe spelter we ketched, an’ we knowed he could do that, fur the\r\nfellers all said he had a big pile of gold an’ silver that he carried\r\nin his saddle-bags.\r\n\r\n“Wal, we packed our blankets an’ we’pons down to the quarters the\r\ncap’n pointed out, an’ when we got thar, we found he had half a dozen\r\nchaps down ’sides ourselves. We knowed one or two of ’em, (an’ we\r\ndidn’t know nothin’ good of ’em neither,) but the others war strangers\r\nto us. Among the strangers war Black Bill--Bosh Peters he said his\r\nname war. He war a’most as black as the cap’n’s darkey, an’ thar war a\r\nbad look in his eye that none of us didn’t like. An’ him an’ his crowd\r\nwarn’t at all pleased to see us neither; fur, although they met us\r\nkind enough, asked us to help ourselves to their grub, an’ inquired\r\n’bout our luck in trappin’, durin’ the last season, thar war somethin’\r\n’bout them that told us plainer nor words that they would have been\r\nmuch better satisfied if we had stayed away.\r\n\r\n“It war a’most night when we went to the quarters, an’ arter we had\r\neat our supper, we smoked our pipes, spread our blankets, an’ went to\r\nsleep. How long I slept I don’t know; but I waked up sometime durin’\r\nthe night, an’ thought I heered somebody talkin’ in a low voice. I\r\nlistened, an’, sure enough, thar war two fellers jest outside of the\r\nquarters plannin’ somethin’. I heered one of ’em ask:\r\n\r\n“‘When shall we do it?’\r\n\r\n“‘Time enough to think of that when we git to the mountains,’ said the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“‘But ar’ you sartin’ he’s goin’ to take it with him?’\r\n\r\n“‘In course! I heered him say so!’\r\n\r\n“‘Wal, then, it’s all right. But we must be mighty keerful, ’cause our\r\nboys don’t like the looks of them last fellers that jined the comp’ny.\r\nSo keep a still tongue in your head.’ They done some more plannin’ and\r\ntalkin’, but I couldn’t hear what it war. Then they moved away in\r\ndifferent directions, an’ purty quick somebody come into the quarters,\r\neasy like, an’ laid down on his blanket, but it war so dark I couldn’t\r\nsee who it war. Wal, I thought the matter all over, an’ soon made up\r\nmy mind that the varlets had been plannin’ an’ talkin’ ag’in the\r\ntrader and his money-bags; but when I told the boys of it the next\r\nmornin’, they all laughed at me, an’ said the cap’n warn’t fool enough\r\nto tote so much money to the mountains with him when he could leave it\r\nat the fort, whar it would be safe. They told me I had better not\r\nspeak of it ag’in, fur if it got to the trader’s ears, he might think\r\nI war a greeny. Wal, I war quite a youngster, that’s a fact; but it\r\nwarn’t long afore it come out that I had more sense nor any of ’em.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nThe Outlaw’s Escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Before goin’ further,” continued the trapper, “I oughter tell you\r\nthat this Black Bill had been on the prairy a long time. Like a good\r\nmany others, he had run away from the law in the States, an’, fallin’\r\nin with more rascals as bad as he war, he soon made himself known, by\r\nname, to nearly every trapper in the country. ’Sides robbin’ lone men\r\nhe met on the prairy an’ in the mountains, he would jine in with\r\nInjuns, an’ lead ’em ag’in wagon trains.\r\n\r\n“None of our comp’ny had ever seed him, although, in course, we had\r\noften heered of him, an’ we never onct thought that he would have the\r\nface to jine in with a party of honest trappers; so we called him\r\nPeters, bein’ very fur from thinkin’ that he war the feller that had\r\ndone so much mischief. If we _had_ knowed who he war, prairy law\r\nwouldn’t have let him live five minits.\r\n\r\n“Wal, arter we had been at the fort ’bout two weeks, Cap’n Forbes got\r\nevery thing ready fur the start, an’, one mornin’, bright an’ ’arly,\r\nwe sot off t’wards the mountains. Thar war fourteen of us\r\naltogether--seven of us fellers, five of Bosh Peters’ party, the\r\ntrader, and his darkey. We had four pack mules; and, as the Cap’n\r\nwarn’t a bit stingy, he had give us good we’pons an’ plenty of powder\r\nan’ lead. I hadn’t forgot what them two fellers said that night,\r\nalthough I hadn’t never spoke about it, fur fear of bein’ laughed\r\nat--an’ I kept close watch on the trader, to find out if he had his\r\nmoney with him. He carried a pair of saddle-bags, an’ they were well\r\npacked, too; but, judgin’ by the keerless way he throwed them around,\r\nwhen we camped fur the night, thar warn’t no money in ’em. Bosh Peters\r\nand his party had all along been tryin’ to git on the right side of\r\nus, and purty soon our fellers begun to think that we had been fooled\r\nin ’em, an’ that they war all right arter all.\r\n\r\n“Wal, when we reached the trappin’ grounds, we built our quarters fur\r\nthe winter, an’ then commenced work. The trader went with one feller\r\none day, an’ with another the next. He warn’t no trapper; but he liked\r\nthe sport, an’ seemed to want to larn how it war done. But, arter\r\nawhile he got tired of this, an’ staid in the camp from mornin’ till\r\nnight. He never went out with me; if he had, I should have told him to\r\nkeep his eye on them money-bags, if he had ’em with him.\r\n\r\n“One day, as I war at work settin’ a trap in a clump of bushes that\r\ngrew on the banks of a little creek, I heered some fellers comin’\r\nalong, talkin’ to each other. Now, jest that one little thing war\r\nenough to make me b’lieve that thar war somethin’ wrong in the wind,\r\n’cause, when fellers go out to hunt an’ trap, an’ fur nothin’ else,\r\nthey don’t go together through the woods, as though they were huntin’\r\ncows. So I sot still an’ listened, an’ purty quick heered Bosh Peters\r\ntalkin’. Thar war one feller with him, but the bushes war so thick I\r\ncouldn’t see him, an’ I didn’t know his voice. They war comin’ right\r\nt’wards me, an’ when they reached the creek, one of ’em went to get a\r\ndrink, an’ the others sot down on a log not ten foot from me. Purty\r\nsoon I heered Bosh Peters say:\r\n\r\n“‘I know it’s time we war doin’ somethin’, Tom, but I’m a’most afraid\r\nto try it. Them ’ar fellers are seven to our five, an’ if we shouldn’t\r\nhappen to get away, we would ketch prairy law, sartin; an’ that’s a\r\nheap wusser nor law in the settlements. They don’t give a feller a\r\nchance to break jail on the prairy.’\r\n\r\n“‘Black Bill,’ said the other, ‘thar’s jest no use a talkin that ’ar\r\nway. If we’re a goin’ to do it at all, now is jest as good a chance as\r\nwe shall have. The cap’n stays in the camp all day alone, an’ afore\r\nthe other chaps get back to larn what’s done, we can be miles in the\r\nmountains.’\r\n\r\n“‘Wal, then,’ said Black Bill, ‘let’s do the job to onct. The cap’n\r\nwar in the camp this mornin’ when I left, an’ if he’s thar this\r\narternoon, we’ll finish him, an’ the money-bags are ourn. But let’s\r\nmove off; it won’t do fur us to be seed together.’\r\n\r\n“The varlets walked away, an’ I lay thar in them bushes fifteen\r\nminutes afore I stirred. This war the fust time that I knowed Black\r\nBill war one of our comp’ny. To say that I war surprised to hear it,\r\nwouldn’t half tell how I felt. I war teetotally tuk back. The idee of\r\nthat feller comin’ into our camp, when he knowed that if he war found\r\nout, short work would be made with him! I could hardly b’lieve it. But\r\nI couldn’t lay thar, foolin’ away time with such thoughts, when I\r\nknowed that the cap’n’s life war in danger. So, thinkin’ the rascals\r\nhad got out of sight an’ hearin’, I crawled out of the bushes,\r\nintendin’ to start at onct fur the camp, an’ tell the fellers what I\r\nhad jest heered. I walked down to the creek fust, to get a drink, an’\r\njest as I war bendin’ over, I heered the crack of a rifle; a bullet\r\nwhistled by, not half an inch from my head, an’ buried itself in the\r\nground. I jumped to my feet, an’ lookin’ up the bank, saw a leetle\r\nsmoke risin’ from behind a log not twenty yards distant. Grabbin’ my\r\nrifle, which I had laid down as I war goin’ to drink, I rushed acrost\r\nthe creek, an’ the next minit war standin’ face to face with Black\r\nBill. Fur an instant the chap shook like a leaf, an’ turned as pale as\r\nhis black skin would let him. Then he seemed to find his wits ag’in,\r\nfur he stuck out his hand, sayin’:\r\n\r\n“‘By gum, Bob Kelly! is that you? I’ll be shot if I didn’t take you\r\nfur an Injun. I’m mighty glad I didn’t hit you, Bob!’\r\n\r\n“‘You can’t blarney me, Black Bill,’ said I. ‘I know you;’ an’ as I\r\nstood thar lookin’ at the rascal, an’ thought of all the badness he\r\nhad done, I had half a mind to shoot him. The way of it war, the\r\nvarlet kind o’ thought that somebody had been listenin’ to what he\r\nsaid ’bout robbin’ the cap’n, an’ he had hid behind the log to watch.\r\nWhen he seed me come out of the bushes, he knowed that I had heered\r\nall that had been goin’ on, an’ he thought his best plan war to leave\r\nme thar dead. But, although he warn’t twenty yards off when he fired\r\nat me, he missed me teetotally. Wal, when he seed that I knowed him,\r\nan’ that he couldn’t fool me into b’lievin’ that he tuk me fur an\r\nInjun, he thought he would skeer me, so he growled:\r\n\r\n“‘If you know me, Bob Kelly, you know a man that won’t stand no\r\nnonsense. I have friends not fur off, an’ if you know any thing,\r\nyou’ll travel on ’bout your own bisness.’\r\n\r\n“‘Now, look a here, Black Bill,’ said I, ‘I haint never been in the\r\nhabit of standin’ much nonsense, neither--leastways not from such\r\nfellers as you, an’ if you knowed me, you would know that I don’t\r\nskeer wuth a charge of gunpowder. That ’ar is the way to the camp,\r\nan’ if you want to live two minutes longer, you’ll travel off to\r\nonct.’ Seein’ that he didn’t start, but that he stood eyein’ me as if\r\nhe’d a good mind to walk into me, I stepped back, an’ p’intin’ my\r\nrifle straight at his heart, said: ‘I shan’t tell you more’n onct more\r\nthat ’ar is the way to camp. You can go thar, or you can stay here fur\r\nthe wolves, jest as you please.’\r\n\r\n“I guess he seed that I war in ’arnest, fur he shouldered his empty\r\nrifle, an’ started through the woods, I follerin’ close behind, ready\r\nto drop him if he should run or show fight. I felt mighty on-easy\r\nwhile travelin’ through that timber, ’cause I knowed well enough that\r\nthe rascal had friends, an’ if one of ’em should happen to see me\r\nmarchin’ Black Bill off that ’ar way, he’d drop me, sartin. But I\r\nreached the camp in safety, an’ thar I found two of our own fellers,\r\nan’ four that I had allers thought war friends of Black Bill. They all\r\njumped up as we came in, fur they knowed by the way I looked that\r\nsomethin’ war wrong, an’ one of ’em said:\r\n\r\n“‘What’s Bosh Peters been a doin’, Bob?’\r\n\r\n“‘That aint no Bosh Peters,’ said I; ‘that ’ar chap is Black Bill.’\r\n\r\n“Now comes the funniest part of the hul bisness. Every trapper on the\r\nprairy, as I told you, had heered of Black Bill, an’ when I told ’em\r\nthat my prisoner war the very chap, an’ that he had been layin’ a plan\r\nto rob the cap’n, I never seed sich a mad set of men in my life.\r\n\r\n“They all sot up a yell, an’ one of ’em, that I would have swore war a\r\nfriend of Black Bill, drawed his knife, an’ made at the varlet as if\r\nhe war goin’ to rub him out to onct. But my chum, Ned Roberts, ketched\r\nhim, and tuk the we’pon away from him. This sot the feller to bilin’,\r\nand he rushed round the camp wusser nor a crazy man. He said that\r\nBlack Bill had shot his chum, an’ that he war swore to kill him\r\nwherever he found him; and he war goin’ to do it, too. An’ the fust\r\nthing we knowed, he grabbed somebody’s rifle, an’ jumped back to shoot\r\nthe pris’ner. But he war ketched ag’in, afore he could fire, and then\r\nhe howled wusser nor ever. Wal, we tied Black Bill to a tree in the\r\ncamp, an’ this feller kept slippin’ round, with his tomahawk in his\r\nhand, an’ it tuk two men to get the we’pon away from him.\r\n\r\n“The chap tuk on so, that we all thought that he told the truth, but,\r\n(would you believe it?) I arterwards larnt that he war the very same\r\nchap that I had heered talkin’ with Black Bill ’bout robbin’ the\r\ncap’n. He kind o’ thought that we might know something ag’in him, an’\r\nhe carried on in that way to make us b’lieve that he war really an\r\nenemy of Black Bill. In course we didn’t know this at the time. If we\r\nhad, he’d soon been a pris’ner too. But, supposin’ him to be tellin’\r\nthe gospel truth, we felt sorry fur him, an’ promised that Black Bill\r\nshouldn’t ever be let loose to do meanness ag’in. While the fuss war\r\ngoin on, the trader come out; an’ when we told him what happened--how\r\nthe pris’ner an’ one of his friends, that we didn’t know, had been\r\nlayin’ a plan to do robbery an’ killin’; an’ that the chap he called\r\nBosh Peters war none other than Black Bill the outlaw--I never seed a\r\nman so tuk back in my life. It skeered him purty bad. He had allers\r\nlooked upon Black Bill as one of the honestest men in the expedition;\r\nan’, when he found that he war a traitor, he didn’t know who to trust;\r\nan’ he tuk mighty good keer not to be alone durin’ the rest of the\r\narternoon.\r\n\r\n“Wal, when it growed dark, the fellers began to come in from their\r\nday’s work, some loaded with furs, an’ others with a piece of bar or\r\nbig-horn, which they had knocked over for supper. As fast as they come\r\nin, we told ’em what war up, an’ they didn’t take it very easy, now, I\r\ntell you.\r\n\r\n“The idee that Black Bill, arter doin’ so much badness--robbin’ lone\r\ntrappers an’ leadin’ wild Injuns ag’in wagon trains--should come into\r\none of our forts, an’ stick his name down with those of honest,\r\nhard-workin’ trappers, when he knowed that every one of ’em had plenty\r\nag’in him, I say it war hard to b’lieve. But thar he war, tied to a\r\ntree, an’, when the boys come to look at him close, they wondered that\r\nthey hadn’t knowed afore that he war a villain.\r\n\r\n“Wal, we waited a long time for all of our fellers to come in; but\r\nthar war three of us missin’, an’ that war the only thing that saved\r\nBlack Bill. We didn’t want to pass sentence on him without lettin’ all\r\nthe boys have a chance to say somethin’; an’ as they might come in\r\nsome time durin’ the night, we thought we would keep the varlet till\r\nmorning. So we tied him, hand an’ foot, and laid him away in one of\r\nthe cabins. The cap’n’s darkey made him a bed of hemlock boughs, an’\r\nlaid him on it, abusin’ him all the while like all natur’, an’ goin’\r\nin for shootin’ him to onct. It would have been well for one of us, if\r\nwe had put that darkey in there as a pris’ner too. But we didn’t know\r\nit, an’ afore we got through he cost us the life of one of the best\r\nmen in our comp’ny. The fellers then all went to bed except me. I\r\nguarded the varlet till the moon went down, and then, arter calling my\r\nchum, who war to watch him till daylight, I went into my quarters an’\r\nslept soundly all the rest of the night. When it come mornin’, I\r\nawoke, an’, in a few minits, all our boys war up. The fellers had all\r\ncome in durin’ the night, an’ ole Jim Roberts--my chum’s ole man--who\r\nwar our leader, called a council. Black Bill didn’t seem to have a\r\nfriend among us, for the last man of us said as how the law must be\r\nlived up to.\r\n\r\n“‘Who guarded him last night?’ asked the ole man.\r\n\r\n“‘I did,’ I answered, ’till the moon went down, and then Ned tuk my\r\nplace.’\r\n\r\n“‘Wal, Ned, bring out the pris’ner,’ said the ole man. ‘But whar is\r\nNed?’ he asked, runnin’ his eye over the camp. ‘Ned! Ned Roberts!’\r\n\r\n“I had all along s’posed that Ned war still guardin’ the pris’ner; but\r\nwhen he didn’t answer, I knowed in a minit that somethin’ had been\r\ngoin’ wrong ag’in, an’ the others knowed it too, fur men who have\r\nlived in danger all their lives aint long in seein’ through a thing of\r\nthat kind. So we all rushed to the cabin where we had left the outlaw,\r\nan’ there lay my chum--stark an’ dead--stabbed to the heart! The\r\npris’ner war gone. Thar war the strips of hickory bark we had tied him\r\nwith, an’ thar war the knife he had used--but Black Bill had tuk\r\nhimself safe off. We stood thar, not knowin’ what to say or do. Ole\r\nJim war the fust that could speak.\r\n\r\n“‘Another gone,’ said he; ’an’ it’s my only son; an’ now whar’s the\r\ntraitor?’\r\n\r\n“He looked from one to the other of us as he said this, but no one\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n“‘He’s here right among you,’ said the ole man, the tears rollin’ down\r\nhis cheeks. ‘He’s right among you. That knife couldn’t got in here\r\nwithout hands; an’ thar’s somebody in this yere camp, that’s helped\r\nBlack Bill in makin’ his escape. Speak, men, who’s the outlaw’s\r\nfriend?’\r\n\r\n“But still no one answered. We all knowed he war thar, but how could\r\nwe tell who it war, when we had no proff ag’in any one?\r\n\r\n“‘Bring him out, boys,’ said the old man, at last. ‘He war a kind son,\r\nan’ a good trapper. But he’s done his work now, an’ we’ve lost one of\r\nthe best men in our comp’ny.’\r\n\r\n“Wal, we carried poor Ned out, an’ arter layin’ him in my cabin, we\r\nstarted off on the trail of the outlaw. But he had a good long start,\r\nan’ that night we had to come back without him. I’ve never seen him\r\nfrom that day to this.\r\n\r\n“The next mornin’ none of us went out to trap, fur we couldn’t help\r\nthinkin’ of poor Ned. He war the fust chum I had ever had, an’ me an’\r\nhim had been together a’most ever since we had strength to shoulder a\r\nrifle--more’n ten year--an’, in course, I war in natur’ bound to\r\navenge him. I staid in my quarters, wonderin’ who it war that had\r\nhelped the outlaw; when, all of a sudden, I happened to think of\r\nsomethin’ that brought me to my feet in a hurry, an’ sent me into ole\r\nJim’s quarters. I talked the matter over with him, told him what I\r\nthought, an’, in a few minits more, we called our boys together, an’\r\nwar marchin’ t’wards the trader’s camp. The darkey war cookin’ his\r\nmaster’s breakfast, in front of the cabin, singin’ an’ whistlin’ as\r\njolly as could be; but when he seed us a comin’ he shet up in a\r\nmighty hurry, an’ actooally turned white! I knowed he wouldn’t act\r\nthat ar’ way if he warn’t guilty, so I sung out, ‘Here’s the traitor,\r\nboys!’\r\n\r\n“The darkey, seein’ that the thing war out, started to run. He hadn’t\r\ngone far, howsomever, afore we had him, an’ then he ’fessed the hul\r\nbisness. He said he had told the outlaw that the cap’n war goin’ to\r\ntake his money-bags with him, an’ that, bein’ the last to leave Black\r\nBill arter we had tied him, he had hid the knife in his bed. The\r\npris’ner’s arms had been fastened above his elbows, an’, in course,\r\nhavin’ a sharp we’pon, it war the easiest thing in the world to cut\r\nhimself loose, an’ to pitch into poor Ned afore he knowed it. Arter he\r\nhad ’fessed this, we held a council, an’ prairy law tuk its course.\r\nThis skeered the trader wusser nor ever. If his own servant war\r\ntreacherous, he couldn’t trust nobody. So he ordered us to break up\r\nour camp an’ strike fur the fort. When we got thar, an’ offered to\r\ngive up our hosses an’ we’pons, he wouldn’t listen to it at all. He\r\nsaid that we had saved him an’ his money-bags, an’ that we could keep\r\nour kit, an’ welcome.\r\n\r\n“Wal, our huntin’ expedition bein’ broke up, we put out on our own\r\nhook. We still thought that them four fellers b’longed to Black Bill’s\r\nparty, an’ we soon found that it war so; fur we had hardly got out of\r\nsight, afore they started fur the mountains. They knowed ’bout whar to\r\ngo to find the outlaw, an’ they’ve been with him ever since, robbin’\r\nan’ stealin’. One of his party has been rubbed out, but thar ar’ four\r\nof them left yet, an’ they do a heap of mischief. I have looked an’\r\nwatched fur ’em fur years, an’ if I never find ’em, I shall leave ’em\r\nto Dick; so I know justice will be done ’em. If you had knowed all\r\nthese things, youngster, I don’t reckon you would have slept very\r\nsound in Black Bill’s camp.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nThe King of the Drove.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe travelers had been intensely interested in the old trapper’s\r\nstory, and not even the thought that the danger was passed, and that\r\nFrank was safe in camp again, could altogether quiet their feelings.\r\nFrank was more astonished than ever, and he secretly determined that\r\nhe would never again lose sight of the wagon, if he could avoid it.\r\nBut, if he should again be compelled to take an involuntary ride, and\r\nshould happen to fall in with strangers on the prairie, he would give\r\nthem a wide berth.\r\n\r\nMr. Winters said nothing. He did not think that the occasion demanded\r\nthat he should caution his nephew, for it was by no means probable\r\nthat the latter would soon forget his night in the outlaw’s camp.\r\n\r\nHis adventures, which were the subject of a lengthy conversation, did\r\nnot, however, entirely quench his love of excitement, and when, after\r\na hearty dinner on buffalo hump, Archie proposed a short ride on the\r\nprairie, he agreed to accompany him, and, as soon as he had caught and\r\nsaddled his uncle’s horse, was ready for the start. As they rode along\r\nout of the woods, Archie informed his cousin that another herd of\r\nbuffaloes had been seen that morning by old Bob, feeding near the base\r\nof the mountains, and announced his determination of endeavoring to\r\nshoot one, if they should happen to come across them. As there was now\r\nno danger of being stampeded--both of their horses being old buffalo\r\nhunters--Frank agreed to the proposal, and followed his cousin, who\r\nled the way toward the place where the buffaloes had last been seen.\r\nSwell after swell they mounted, straining their eyes in every\r\ndirection, without discovering the wished-for game.\r\n\r\nBut they saw something else that excited them quite as much as the\r\nsight of a herd of buffaloes would have done; for, as Archie, who had\r\nridden some distance in advance of his cousin, reached the top of one\r\nof the hills, Frank saw him suddenly draw rein, and back his horse\r\ndown the swell, out of sight of something which he had discovered on\r\nthe other side. He then rode back to meet Frank, and, as soon as he\r\ncame within speaking distance, whispered, excitedly:\r\n\r\n“There’s a big drove of wild horses out there.”\r\n\r\nFrank waited to hear no more, but, throwing his bridle to his cousin,\r\ndismounted from his horse, and, going cautiously to the top of the\r\nswell, looked over. Sure enough, there they were, about half a mile\r\ndistant, probably five hundred of them, scattered about over\r\nthe prairie, some feeding, and others prancing about, as if\r\nwholly unconscious of danger. Among them was one horse--an\r\niron-gray--rendered conspicuous by his great size and extraordinary\r\nbeauty, which galloped about as if he were “monarch of all he\r\nsurveyed.” Frank remembered what Dick had told him about every drove\r\nof wild horses having a “master,” and, as he watched his movements,\r\nand noticed how the other horses shied at his approach, he came to the\r\nconclusion that the gray horse was the king. He gazed at them for some\r\ntime, admiring their rapid, graceful movements, and thinking how fully\r\nthe gray would supply the place of the horse he had lost, when he\r\nnoticed that the animals were feeding directly toward him. Fearful of\r\nbeing discovered, he crawled back down the swell, and rejoined his\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?” asked the latter, excitedly.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you suppose Dick could catch one of those fellows?” inquired\r\nFrank.\r\n\r\n“Of course he could,” answered Archie, quickly. “Didn’t he catch that\r\nblack mustang he told us about--a horse that every body had tried to\r\ncatch, and couldn’t? Let’s go back, and ask him to try.”\r\n\r\nThe boys hastily remounted, and started for the camp as fast as their\r\nhorses could carry them. Archie, of course, led the way, and, as he\r\ndashed up to the wagon, he threw himself from the saddle, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“Dick, there’s a drove of wild horses out there on the prairie. Jump\r\non Sam, and go and catch one for Frank.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the same drove I seed day afore yesterday,” said old Bob, “an’\r\nthat’s what I meant when I told Frank we’d put him on hossback ag’in\r\nafore he war two days older. Ketch my hoss, Dick.”\r\n\r\nDick did as he was desired, and, by this time, Frank had come up,\r\nArchie, in his eagerness, having left him far behind.\r\n\r\n“Did you skeer ’em, youngsters?” asked old Bob, as he went to the\r\nwagon and drew out two rawhide lassos, one of which he handed to Dick.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Frank. “They didn’t see us. Dick, catch the king--he’s a\r\nlarge iron-gray--the prettiest horse in the drove. If I could have\r\nhim, I would be glad I lost Pete.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, now, that ar’ will be a hard thing to do, youngsters,” replied\r\nthe trapper, coiling up his lasso, and hanging it on the horn of his\r\nsaddle; “a mighty hard thing to do. Them ar’ kings ar’ allers the\r\nswiftest hosses in the drove; an’ it aint every ole buffaler hunter\r\nthat can keep up with ’em.”\r\n\r\nArchie was astonished to hear the trapper speak so lightly of Sleepy\r\nSam, a horse that had several times proved himself to be possessed of\r\ngreat speed; but Dick hastened to explain.\r\n\r\n“I aint sayin’ nothin’ ag’in your hoss, little one, no more’n I am\r\nag’in Bob’s. But if you had chased wild hosses as often as I have, you\r\nwould know that a hoss can beat any thing in a wagon train, an’ yet\r\nhave no bisness with the king of a drove. I won’t say that we’ll ketch\r\nthat gray fur you, Frank, but we’ll try hard, an’ if he is too fast\r\nfur us, we’ll lasso one of the others, sartin. We’ll bring back\r\nsomethin’ fur you to ride.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the trappers were ready for the start. Mr. Winters and\r\nthe boys accompanied them to the edge of the prairie, and there Bob\r\nand Dick left them, after repeatedly assuring Frank that it was not\r\ntheir intention to return empty-handed.\r\n\r\nWhen they had disappeared, Mr. Winters and the boys seated themselves\r\non the ground, and for nearly an hour, waited and listened for the\r\nsound of the pursuit. Suddenly a single horse appeared upon the summit\r\nof a distant swell, and facing about, stood as if regarding some\r\nobject that had excited his curiosity. Then came another, and another,\r\nand in a moment more the entire drove appeared, running at the top of\r\ntheir speed. One minute elapsed--two--three--and then two more horses\r\nsuddenly arose over the swell, and followed swiftly after the drove.\r\nThe chase had begun in earnest. The boys were surprised, and not a\r\nlittle discouraged, to see the trappers so far behind. But still they\r\nhad great confidence in them, and Frank was already reconciled to the\r\nloss of his horse, and confident that he would own another before he\r\nwent to sleep that night. The chase was tending directly toward the\r\nmountains, and it presented a sight the boys would have been loth to\r\nmiss. Nearer and nearer came the wild steeds, prancing and snorting,\r\nand looking back at the strange objects that were pursuing them.\r\nPresently, among the foremost ones, the boys discovered the gray king.\r\nHe moved over the ground as lightly as if he had been furnished with\r\nwings, and as Frank watched his movements, he reluctantly came to the\r\nconclusion that if his endurance was as great as his speed, he must\r\ncontent himself with one of the common horses of the drove. They\r\ncontinued to advance until they came within a quarter of a mile of the\r\nwillows, when they seemed, for the first time, to discover that their\r\nretreat in that direction was cut off by the mountains. This appeared\r\nto confuse and frighten them. The foremost ones slackened their speed,\r\nbut seeing their pursuers close behind them, the drove suddenly\r\ndivided, part of the horses turning one way, and the rest going the\r\nother. The trappers had kept their eyes on the king, and, when he\r\nturned, they singled him out from the others, and followed him with\r\nincreased speed. The gray mustang made an exhibition of his powers\r\nthat was truly surprising; but the trappers took a “short cut” on him,\r\nand gained so rapidly that Frank’s hopes rose again. Sleepy Sam was\r\nrunning splendidly; but, to the surprise of all, old Bob’s ungainly,\r\nraw-boned horse, in answer to a yell from his rider, bounded past him.\r\nAll this happened in much less time than we have taken to describe it.\r\nThe horses moved with wonderful rapidity, and, in a very few moments\r\nafter the drove divided, the gray king and the trappers were out of\r\nsight behind the swells, and all sounds of the chase had died away in\r\nthe distance.\r\n\r\nMr. Winters then returned to the camp, while the excited boys again\r\nseated themselves on the ground, and waited long and impatiently for\r\nthe trapper’s return. The hours slowly wore away, and, finally, the\r\nsun went down, but still no signs of the horsemen. It soon began to\r\ngrow dark, and the boys were obliged to return to the wagon. Frank\r\nprepared supper that evening, but their appetites must have gone off\r\nwith the gray mustang, for they ate but little. They sat beside the\r\nfire until midnight, straining their ears to catch the first sounds of\r\nthe trapper’s return; but nothing but the occasional howl of a wolf\r\nbroke the stillness; and, finally, growing tired of watching, they\r\nspread their blankets and went to sleep. At the first peep of day they\r\nwere again stirring, and, after a hasty breakfast, they stationed\r\nthemselves in the edge of the willows, to await the return of the\r\nhorsemen. In about two hours their patience was rewarded by the\r\ndiscovery of several objects moving along the summit of a distant\r\nswell. As they approached, the boys recognized the trappers, and in\r\nhalf an hour they were within speaking distance. Could Frank believe\r\nhis eyes? Was Dick really riding the gray king? It was a horse that\r\nbore a strong resemblance to him, and Frank felt confident that the\r\nanimal he had so much admired, was really his own. Nor was he\r\ndeceived; for, as they came up, Dick exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Here we ar’, youngsters. We’ve got him, sure as shootin’. Easy thar,”\r\nhe continued, as the delighted boys walked slowly around him, admiring\r\nhis fine points. “If you know any thing you’ll keep cl’ar of his\r\nheels. He aint very good natur’d.”\r\n\r\nThis was very evident; for the trapper had scarcely spoken before the\r\nmustang began to show his temper. He danced about in the most lively\r\nmanner; first rearing up almost straight in the air, and then kicking\r\nwith both hind feet. His plunges were furious and desperate, and the\r\nboys fully expected to see the trapper unseated. But the latter,\r\nalthough he had no saddle--that being a contrivance he despised--and\r\nonly had his lasso twisted around the gray’s lower jaw, for a bridle,\r\nkept the animal completely under his control, and rode him into the\r\ncamp in triumph.\r\n\r\n“The critter led us ’bout as long an’ as lively a race as we ever\r\nrun,” said Dick, after the gray had been securely fastened to a tree.\r\n“An’ it war only by accident that we ketched him. I don’t reckon I am\r\nsayin’ too much when I say that I never seed a hoss run faster nor\r\nhold out better nor he did--not even the black mustang. We went ’round\r\non the other side of the drove afore we started ’em, on purpose to\r\nmake ’em run t’wards the mountains. That give you a good sight of\r\nsomethin’ you never seed afore, an’ by it we gained on the gray when\r\nhe turned. Wal, he kept ahead of us for ten or twelve miles, gainin’\r\non us all the while, fur when he seed that we war arter him in\r\n’arnest, the way he did climb over the prairy war a purty thing to\r\nlook at--when, all to onct, we found ourselves in a prairy-dog’s nest.\r\nThe prairy, as far as a feller could see, war like a honey-comb. I\r\n’spected every minit that my hoss would break through, an’ at last he\r\ndid. But the gray broke in fust--went down clean to the top of his\r\nlegs, an’ couldn’t git out. I war sartin we had him, an’ war jest\r\ngoin’ to throw my lasso, when my hoss went in, an’ kerchunk I went on\r\nthe ground. But ole Bob war on hand, an’ he ketched him. We told you,\r\nFrank, that we’d put you on horseback ag’in, an’ now that we’ve done\r\nit, I don’t reckon you’ll lose this animal by campin’ with Black\r\nBill.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nHow the Trapper got his Horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter supper, the travelers seated themselves around the fire, and the\r\ntrappers lighted their pipes. After smoking awhile in silence, old Bob\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“As I have told you afore, youngsters, it aint always a easy job to\r\nlasso the king of a drove of wild hosses. The runnin’ we done to-day\r\narter the gray warn’t nothin’ to what we kalkerlated to do when we\r\nleft here; an’ if he hadn’t got into that prairy-dogs’ nest, thar’s no\r\nknowin’ how many miles he would a been from here by this time. When I\r\nwar a youngster, I went to the Saskatchewan fur the fust time, with a\r\nparty of six trappers--Dick’s ole man war one of ’em--an’, being\r\nkeerless, like all young fellers, I soon made away with one of the\r\nbest hosses I ever owned. I run him clean blind arter a herd of\r\nbuffaler. I soon got another, howsomever, but it warn’t as good a one\r\nas I wanted; an’ I begun to look around to find a critter that suited\r\nme. One day I come acrost a drove of wild hosses, an’, arter foolin’\r\nround them fur awhile, I diskivered that they war led by a\r\nchestnut-colored critter--a purty feller--an’ I made up my mind that\r\nhe war just the one I wanted. I had never ketched a wild hoss then,\r\nan’ I had heered enough about them to know that them kings ar’ allers\r\nthe best animals in the drove, an’ that it takes a hoss as is a hoss\r\nto keep up with one of ’em. But I could throw the lasso tolible sharp,\r\nan’ war jest ’bout that age when youngsters think they know more’n\r\nany body else on ’arth; so I thought I could ketch him easy. Wal, I\r\ndodged round them till I got within ’bout half a mile of ’em, and then\r\nput out arter the king; but, human natur, how he did run! I follered\r\nhim ’bout four mile, and then turned t’ward the camp, thinkin’ that\r\nmebbe thar war a few things I didn’t know nothin’ at all ’bout. Some\r\ndays arterward, I seed him ag’in; but he run away from me easy, an’ I\r\nwent back to the camp to be laughed at fur my trouble. But I knowed\r\nthat I should have plenty of chances to ketch him afore we started fur\r\nhum--we war to stay thar till spring--so I said nothin’, but kept\r\nlookin’ round, an’ every time I seed the chestnut king, me an’ him had\r\na race.\r\n\r\n“I got him at last--not in the way I expected, howsomever--an’, to\r\nmake the story plain, I must tell you what happened ’bout three year\r\nafore that.\r\n\r\n“I war born on the banks of the Missouri River, ’bout twenty mile from\r\nwhar St. Joseph now stands. It war thar my ole man fust larnt me how\r\nto handle a rifle an’ ride a wild mustang. Thar war a fort ’bout a\r\nmile from our cabin, whar the ole man allers went to sell his furs. It\r\nwarn’t no ways safe thar, in them days, fur all that country b’longed\r\nto the Injuns, who warn’t very friendly t’ward white settlers. But,\r\nwhenever thar war any trouble, we had a safe place to go to, an’ onct,\r\nwhen I war only twelve year ole, I stood ’side my ole man, in the\r\nfort, an’ helped drive off atween four an’ five hundred red-skins. I\r\ndone so well that ole hunters an’ trappers slapped me on the back,\r\nsayin’ that I war a ‘chip o’ the ole block,’ and that I’d be a better\r\nInjun-hunter nor my father some day. This pleased my ole man, an’\r\nwhen the Injuns had gone, he took me on a trappin’ expedition with\r\nhim. Thar war four of us, an’ we war gone all winter. I ketched my\r\nshare of the furs, an’ killed two grizzly bars, which war something\r\nfor a chap of my years to brag on. Wal, we reached hum in the spring,\r\nan’, arter I had stayed at our cabin two or three days, tellin’ my\r\nmother big stories of what I had seed, an’ what I had done, the ole\r\nman sent me down to the fort to trade off our spelter. I ought to say\r\nthat on our way hum we had dodged a large party of Injuns that war on\r\na scalpin’ expedition. They had been off a fightin’ with another\r\ntribe, an’, havin’ got thrashed, they warn’t in very good humor. I war\r\nafraid they might take it into their heads to visit the country ’round\r\nthe fort, an’ massacree the settlers; but the ole man laughed at me,\r\nan’ told me to go ’long ’bout my bisness, an’ sell them furs. So, as I\r\nwar sayin’, I sot out fur the fort, an’, while I war makin’ a bargain\r\nwith the trader, a trapper came in on a hoss that war a’most ready to\r\ndrop, an’ said that the Injuns war strikin’ fur the fort. I don’t\r\nreckon that they intended to come afore night; but this trapper had\r\ngot away from ’em, an’, knowin’ that he would alarm the settlers, the\r\nInjuns jest thought they would make a rush, an’ massacree men, women,\r\nan’ children, afore they could reach the fort.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I didn’t wait to hear no more; but, grabbin’ up my we’pons,\r\nstarted fur hum arter the old folks. Purty quick I heered a firm’ an’\r\nyellin’, an’ made up my mind that them as didn’t reach the fort in\r\nless nor ten minits would be goners, sartin, fur the Injuns war\r\ncomin’, sure enough. A little further on I met my mother, who told me\r\nthat the ole man an’ a few more of the settlers war fightin’ back the\r\nInjuns to give the women an’ young ones time to git safe under kiver.\r\nMy mother war a’most too ole to walk so fur, so I took her on my hoss,\r\nand carried her t’wards the fort, intendin’ that as soon as I had seed\r\nher safe I would come back arter the ole man. But jest as I reached\r\nthe fort, I heered a loud yellin’ an’ whoopin’, an’, lookin’ back, I\r\nseed the settlers comin’ out of the woods, with the Injuns clost\r\nbehind ’em. Thar war, as nigh as I could guess, ’bout two hundred\r\nred-skins, an’ not more’n twenty white fellers; so, in course, thar\r\nwarn’t no ’arthly use to think of fightin’ in cl’ar open ground. The\r\nsettlers war comin’ as fast as their hosses could fetch ’em, an’ the\r\nInjuns war clost arter ’em, intendin’ to kill or captur’ ’em all afore\r\nthey could reach the fort. I seed the ole man among the settlers, an’\r\nmade up my mind that he war safe, fur he rid a good hoss, when, all to\r\nonct, he dropped his rifle, throwed up his hands, an’ fell from his\r\nsaddle. The settlers kept on; fur, in course, they couldn’t help him,\r\nan’ the ole man tried to follor ’em; but I seed him pulled down an’\r\ntomahawked, ’bout two hundred yards from the fort, by a young Injun,\r\nwhom, from his bar’s claws, an’ other fixins, I tuk to be a chief. My\r\nole shootin’ iron war good fur that distance, so I drawed up and\r\nblazed away. But my hand trembled, an’ I seed that Injun make off with\r\nthe ole man’s scalp. That war a long time ago, youngsters; but I can\r\nsee that varlet yet, an’ hear the yell he give as he shook the scalp\r\nat us in the fort, an’ ran back into the woods. Of them twenty men\r\nthat war in the fight, ’bout a dozen rode safe into the fort. The\r\nothers war massacreed afore our very eyes, an’ we couldn’t help ’em.\r\n\r\n“Wal, the Injuns stayed round in the edge of the tim’er fur ’bout two\r\nhours, yellin’ an’ firm’ at us; but, knowin’ that they could not take\r\nthe fort--fur they tried that twice--they all set up a yelp an’ put\r\noff, burnin’ every thing as they went. It war a sad day fur that\r\nsettlement. Nigh every family war mournin’ fur somebody; but I war\r\nwusser off nor any of ’em. My mother carried a heap of years on her\r\nshoulders, an’ when she seed the ole man pulled down an’ scalped, it\r\ngave her a shock she never got over. We buried them both nigh the\r\nfort, an’ arter stayin’ round fur a week or two, I sot out with a\r\nparty of trappers fur our ole huntin’ grounds on the Saskatchewan. I\r\nnever forgot that young Injun, an’ all I keered fur or thought ’bout,\r\nwar to meet him. I jest knowed that I should find him ag’in some day,\r\nan’ if I had met him among his tribe, with hundreds of his friends\r\nstandin’ round, I would have knowed him.\r\n\r\n“Wal, as I war sayin’, I sot out with this party of trappers, an’ it\r\nwar on the Saskatchewan that I fust diskivered this chestnut king that\r\nI had made up my mind to have. I follered him a’most all winter, an’\r\nthe more I seed him run, the more I wanted to ketch him. I ’tended to\r\nmy shar’ of the trappin’, but every chance I got I war arter them\r\nhosses. At last they put off somewhar, an’ I never seed ’em ag’in. I\r\ncouldn’t think what had ’come on ’em, but I knowed that they had gone\r\nclean out of the country, an’ that I should have to look fur another\r\nhoss, an’ give up all hopes of ketchin’ the chestnut.\r\n\r\n“When spring opened, an’ it come good travelin’ we held a council, an’\r\nsettled it that we should start fur the fort to onct. We war in a\r\nhurry to get away, too, fur some of our fellers had seen Injun sign\r\n’bout two miles from the camp; so, one mornin’ we sot out to gather up\r\nour traps. I had ’bout five mile to go to reach my trappin’ ground, so\r\nI rode off on a gallop. I went along mighty keerless, fur I didn’t\r\nb’lieve what them fellers had said ’bout seein’ Injun sign, but I soon\r\nlarnt that ole trappers never get fooled ’bout sich things. I hadn’t\r\ngone more’n a mile from the camp, when, whizz! something whistled by\r\nmy head, an’ went chuck into a tree on the other side of me. It war an\r\narrer, an’ afore I could look round to see whar it come from, I heered\r\na yell, an’ the next minit a hoss popped out of the bushes, an’ came\r\nt’wards me. An Injun war on his back, an’ in one hand he carried a\r\nlong spear, an’ with the other he held his bow an’ guided his hoss. As\r\nsoon as he got cl’ar of the bushes, he p’inted that spear straight at\r\nmy breast, an’ came at me, full jump. I war a youngster then. I hadn’t\r\nbeen in as many rough-an’-tumble fights with wild Injuns as I have\r\nbeen since, an’ I would have give all the spelter I had trapped that\r\nwinter if I had been safe in camp. These war the fust thoughts that\r\nwent through my mind. But arter I had tuk jest one good look at the\r\nInjun an’ his hoss, I wouldn’t have been away from thar fur nothin’.\r\nThe Injun war the young chief that had rubbed out my ole man, an’ the\r\nhoss war the chestnut king--the very one I had been tryin’ to ketch\r\nfur a’most a year. So, you see, I had two things to work fur. Fust, I\r\nhad swore to have that Injun’s scalp; next, I wanted that hoss; an’ I\r\nmade up my mind that I wouldn’t leave that ’ar place till I had ’em\r\nboth. The young chief war so clost to me that I didn’t have time to\r\nshoot, so I sot still in my saddle, an’ when I seed the p’int of the\r\nspear ’bout two foot from my breast, I stuck out my rifle an’ turned\r\nthe we’pon aside. Then, jest as the Injun war goin’ by me, I ketched\r\nhim by the scalp-lock, quicker nor lightnin’, an’ pulled him from his\r\nhoss. My own hoss warn’t trained wuth a plug o’ tobacker, an’, skeered\r\nby the fuss, an’ the Injuns yellin’, he give a jump, an’ the fust\r\nthing I knowed, me an’ the young chief war rollin’ on the ground\r\ntogether. I’ve had one or two wild savages by the top-knot since then,\r\nbut I never got hold of a chap of his size that war so strong an’\r\nwiry. When I fust ketched him, I allowed to rub him out easy, fur I\r\nwar purty good on a rough-an’-tumble, an’ it warn’t every body that\r\ncould take my measure on the ground; but when I ketched that Injun, I\r\nfound that I had come acrost a varmint. We fell side by side, I all\r\nthe while hangin’ on to his har; but afore I could think whar I war,\r\nor what a doin’, I found the young chief on top of me; an’, both his\r\nhands bein’ free, he commenced feelin’ fur his knife. In course I\r\ncouldn’t allow that, so I ketched one of his arms, which he twisted\r\nout of my grasp, as easy as though I had no strength at all. I tried\r\nthis two or three times, but findin’ that I couldn’t hold him, I\r\nfastened on his belt which held the knife, an’, with one jerk, tore it\r\nloose, an’ flung it over my head. The Injun, findin’ that his we’pon\r\nwar gone, whooped an’ yelled wusser nor ever. We war on even terms\r\nnow, fur my knife war under me, an’ neither of us could git at it.\r\nThen I began tryin’ to git him off me; but it war no use, an’ the\r\nInjun findin’ that I breathed hard, held still an’ quiet, hopin’ that\r\nI would soon tire myself out, an’ then he would have no trouble in\r\ngittin’ away from me. But I war layin’ my plans all this while, an’,\r\nwatchin’ the Injun clost, I ketched him off his guard, an’ went to\r\nwork in ’arnest. By the way that chap kicked an’ yelled, I guess he\r\nthought I had only been foolin’ with him afore, an’ the way he did\r\nfight warn’t a funny thing fur me to think of jest then. But it war no\r\nuse. I thrashed around till I got hold of my knife, an’, in a minit\r\narter that, the young chief had give his last yell. Arter bein’ sartin\r\nthat he was done fur, I jumped up an’ run t’wards the mustang, which\r\nhad stood a little way off watchin’ the fight, as though he war\r\nwonderin’ who would come out at the top of the heap. I ketched him\r\neasy, an’ arter takin’ the young Injun’s top-knot, I picked up his\r\nwe’pons--here’s one of ’em, youngsters.”\r\n\r\nAs the trapper spoke, he drew his hatchet from his belt and handed it\r\nto Archie, who sat nearest him. The boys remembered that the first\r\ntime they met old Bob, they had noticed that his hatchet was different\r\nfrom any they had ever seen. The blade was long and narrow, and as\r\nkeen as a razor. The back part of the hatchet was hollow, as was also\r\nthe handle, and thus the weapon could be made to answer the purpose of\r\na pipe. The handle was also ingeniously carved, but was so worn by\r\nlong and constant usage, that the figures upon it could not be\r\ndistinguished. The travelers had often noticed that the old trapper\r\nwas very particular about his “tomahawk,” as he invariably called it;\r\nbut now that they knew its history, they did not wonder that he\r\nconsidered it worth preserving. When the boys had examined the weapon\r\nto their satisfaction, they returned it to old Bob, who continued:\r\n\r\n“Wal, arter I had tuk the young chiefs scalp an’ we’pons, (I had his\r\nknife, too, but I lost that in the Missouri River by bein’ upset in a\r\ncanoe,) I jumped on my new hoss, and rode t’wards the camp, leavin’ my\r\nole mustang to go where he pleased. When I reached our fellers, I\r\nfound ’em all busy packin’ up. They had diskivered signs of a large\r\nparty of Injuns, an’ they said that the sooner we got away from thar\r\nthe better it would be fur us. We traveled all that night an’ all the\r\nnext day, an’ got safe off. I had the laugh on my side then, fur ’em\r\nfellers all said I couldn’t never put a bridle on the chestnut king;\r\nan’ when I told ’em my story ’bout the young chief, you ought to seed\r\nthem open their eyes. I hadn’t been fooled ’bout the good pints of\r\nthat ar’ hoss, fur he war a critter that suited me exactly. He carried\r\nme safe through many a fight with grizzly bars an’ Injuns; but,\r\nfinally, I lost him but a few miles from whar I fust seed him--on the\r\nSaskatchewan. I never trapped on that river yet without losin’\r\nsomethin’. I have lost two chums thar; throwed away four or five\r\nwinter’s work--or jest the same as throwed it away, fur all my furs\r\nwar captur’d by the Injuns, an’ thar I lost this hoss.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nOld Bob’s Adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old trapper paused for a moment to refill his pipe, and then\r\ncontinued--\r\n\r\n“I went out as usual with a party of trappers, fur in them days it\r\nwarn’t no way safe fur a feller to go thar alone. We war a’most sartin\r\nto be chased by the Injuns, but them as got away with a hul skin,\r\nallers went back as soon as they could make up a comp’ny, fur it war\r\nthar the best trappin’ war to be found.\r\n\r\n“If all the red-skins we have rubbed out thar could come to life\r\nag’in, I reckon thar would be lots of ’em, an’ if all our poor fellers\r\nwho have had thar har raised on the plains of that same river, could\r\ncome back, you’d see a heap of fine trappers. An’ if me an’ Dick could\r\nhave all the furs we have lost thar, I’ll allow it would keep us in\r\npipes an’ tobacker fur a year or two. In them days, a feller could git\r\na good rifle fur a beaver or otter skin, an’ a fust rate hoss fur two\r\nor three mink skins. Our furs war the only thing we had to depend on\r\nto buy us a new outfit; so when we lost all our winter’s work, it\r\nwarn’t a thing to laugh at.\r\n\r\n“Wal, as I war sayin’, I went out with this party of fellers, an’, as\r\nusual, not the least bit of Injun sign did we see durin’ the winter.\r\nAs a gen’ral thing the red-skins don’t run ’round much in cold\r\nweather--leastways, they don’t go fur from their camps; but by the\r\ntime the snow is off the ground, they ar’ well-nigh out of grub, an’\r\nhave to start out on their huntin’ expeditions. The Saskatchewan war a\r\ngood place fur them to come to, fur thar war plenty of game; but the\r\ncountry warn’t big enough for them an’ us; so when they begun comin’\r\nin, it war high time fur us to be goin’ out. Thar war five of us in\r\nthe party, an’ as every man knowed his own bisness, by the time spring\r\ncome we had as much spelter as four hosses could pack away. When the\r\nsnow commenced goin’ off, we kept a good lookout fur Injuns--fur the\r\ntrappin’ war so fine we didn’t want to leave so long as it war safe\r\nto stay--an’, one mornin’, as I war comin’ in from tendin’ to my\r\ntraps, I seed whar two Injuns had crossed the creek. That war enough\r\nfur me, so I put for the camp, but didn’t find nobody thar. The\r\nfellers war all out tendin’ to their bisness; an’, in course, I warn’t\r\ngoin’ away without ’em; so I packed up my spelter ready fur the start,\r\nand while waitin’ fur ’em, kept sharp watch on all sides fur Injuns.\r\n’Bout noon I heered a hoss comin’, an’, in a few minits, up rid one of\r\nour fellers with his huntin’ shirt all bloody. As soon as I seed him,\r\nI knowed that the game war up.\r\n\r\n“‘Bob!’ says he, ‘Get away from here to onct. Bill Coffee is done fur\r\n(that war his chum), an’ you can see how nigh they come to rubbin’ me\r\nout too. Some varlet sent an arrer clean through my arm. Hand me my\r\npack o’ furs, and let’s be off to onct, I tell you.’\r\n\r\n“This man--Bill Simons his name war--war the oldest an’ bravest man in\r\nour comp’ny, an’ he war our leader. Although I didn’t like the idee of\r\nleavin’ them fellers out thar in the woods with them Injuns--fur every\r\none of ’em had done me a kindness--I knowed I couldn’t do them no good\r\nby stayin’; fur, when Bill Simons deserted his own brother, thar\r\nwarn’t no use of any body’s tryin’ to help him. So I handed Bill his\r\nfurs, grabbed up my own, jumped on my hoss, an’ we started. It war no\r\nlight load them hosses had to carry, fur our spelter war a’most as\r\nheavy as we war. But we couldn’t think of leavin’ ’em behind without\r\nmakin’ one effort to save ’em, fur we had worked hard fur ’em, an’\r\ndidn’t want ’em to fall into the hands of them lazy Injuns. As we rid\r\nalong, we made up our minds that we would stick together as long as we\r\ncould, an’ that we wouldn’t drop our furs as long as we seed the least\r\nchance of escapin’ with ’em. But if we had knowed any thing, we would\r\nhave throwed away them packs to onct, fur hangin’ on to ’em so long\r\nwas jest the very thing that got us ketched. We run our hosses with\r\nthem heavy loads, till they war clean done out; an’ when the Injuns\r\ngot arter us, they war a’most ready to drop. Wal, as I war sayin’, we\r\nrid along fur ’bout two mile, keepin’ a good lookout on all sides fur\r\nInjuns, an’, finally, we seed ’em behind us. Thar war ’bout twenty of\r\n’em, an’ as soon as I sot eyes on ’em, I somehow knowed that we war\r\nketched.\r\n\r\n“‘Bob,’ said Bill, turnin’ to me, ‘our scalps ar’ wuth more nor this\r\nspelter. It is time to run in ’arnest now.’\r\n\r\n“He throwed down his pack, as he spoke, an’ then his hoss went faster.\r\nBut I, bein’ young an’ foolish, didn’t like the idee of losin’ my\r\nwinter’s work; so I held on to my pack, till, findin’ that Bill war\r\nleavin’ me behind, I throwed it away Thar war our eight months’ wages\r\ngone. We had worked hard an’ froze among the snows of the mountains\r\nfur nothin’. But we hadn’t gone fur afore we diskivered that we had\r\noughter throwed ’em away long ago. Both our hosses run as though they\r\nhad traveled all day, an’ it war plain as bar’s ears that they\r\ncouldn’t go much further. Every time we looked back we seed that the\r\nInjuns war gainin’ on us fast, an’ the way they yelled told us that\r\nthey, too, knowed that they would soon have us. I looked t’wards Bill,\r\nan’ although I could read in his face that he knowed we war ketched,\r\nhe didn’t seem the least bit skeary. He had been in jest such scrapes\r\nafore. He had often been a pris’ner, but he war strong as a hoss,\r\ncould run like a skeered deer, an’ had allers succeeded in gittin’\r\naway from the Injuns at last. I, howsomever, had never been in the\r\nhands of the red-skins, but I knowed, from the stories I had often\r\nheered, that they didn’t treat a feller very kind, an’ this set me to\r\nthinkin’. The Injuns knowed Bill, an’ wouldn’t they know me to? The\r\nyoung chief I had rubbed out b’longed to that same tribe, an’ wouldn’t\r\nhis friends ’member the hoss, an’ the knife, an’ tomahawk I carried in\r\nmy belt? I could throw the we’pons away, an’, arter thinkin’ a leetle,\r\nI did. I unbuckled my belt, an’, jest as we went over a swell out of\r\nsight of the Injuns, I dropped knife, tomahawk, an’ all, hopin’ that\r\nthe red-skins would never find ’em; fur I knowed that if they thought\r\nI had ever rubbed out any of the tribe, I would ketch the wust kind of\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n“Wal, all this while the Injuns had been gainin’ on us, fur, the\r\nfurther we went, the slower our hosses run, an’ all the whippin’ an’\r\npoundin’ we could do, didn’t make them go no faster. They war\r\nwell-nigh tuckered out. Purty quick I see Bill turn in his saddle an’\r\ndraw up his ole shootin’ iron. He war bound to die game. I watched the\r\nshot, an’ couldn’t help givin’ a yell when I seed one of the varlets\r\ndrop from his hoss. The Injuns had all this while been ridin’ clost\r\ntogether; but findin’ that we war goin to begin shootin’, they\r\nscattered, an’ throwed themselves flat on their hosses’ backs, so that\r\nwe couldn’t hit ’em. But we war sartin of our game, no matter how\r\nsmall a mark we had to shoot at, an’ when I fired, I seed an Injun an’\r\nhis hoss come to the ground together. By this time, Bill war ready\r\nag’in, an’ down come another Injun.\r\n\r\n“If our hosses had only been fresh, we could have picked off the last\r\none of ’em afore they could have ketched us. But the varlets kept\r\ngainin’ all the time, an’ purty quick they got nigh enough to use\r\ntheir we’pons, an’ the way the arrers whistled ’bout our heads warn’t\r\npleasant, now I tell you. But we kept shootin’ at ’em as fast as we\r\ncould load up, bringin’ down an Injun at every pop--till some chap\r\nsent his arrer into my hoss’s side--an’ the next minit I war sprawlin’\r\non the ground. Bill kept on, but he hadn’t gone fur afore he got an\r\narrer through his neck, which brought him from his saddle, dead. I\r\njest seed this as I war tryin’ to get up; fur my hoss had fell on my\r\nleg, an’ war holdin’ me down. Jest arter Bill fell, the Injuns come up\r\nan’ I war a pris’ner. I couldn’t tell you how I felt, youngsters. I\r\nhad heered enough to know that much depended on my showin’ a bold\r\nfront; but it takes a man of mighty strong nerve to look a dozen\r\nyellin’, scowlin’ Injuns in the face, without onct flinchin’.\r\nHowsomever, I kept a leetle courage ’bout me, I guess, fur when one\r\nchap jumped, an’ drawed his bow with an arrer p’inted straight at my\r\nbreast, I looked him in the eye without winkin’; an’ when another\r\nketched me by the har, an’ lifted his tomahawk as if he had a good\r\nnotion to make an end of me to onct, I stood as still an’ quiet as\r\nthough I didn’t see him. Arter this had been goin’ on fur a while, the\r\nInjuns seemed to grow tired of it, fur my hands war bound behind my\r\nback, an’ one feller fetched up Bill’s hoss, an’ war goin’ to put me\r\non him, when the critter, bein’ clean tired out, give a grunt an’ lay\r\nright down on the prairy. The Injuns seemed to think the hoss war no\r\n’count, fur they turned him loose, an’ I war lifted on to a mustang\r\nbehind one of the savages. I didn’t think much of this at the time,\r\nbut I arterward had reason to be glad that the varlets had left Bill’s\r\nhoss out thar on the prairy.\r\n\r\n“It war ’bout five mile to the place whar the Injuns had made their\r\ncamp, an’ while on the way thar I warn’t bothered at all, fur they\r\nseed that I warn’t skeered easy. When we reached the village--which\r\nmust have had nigh two hundred Injuns in it--I found that I warn’t the\r\nonly pris’ner, fur thar war Pete Simons, Bill’s brother, tied to a\r\npost in the middle of the camp, an’ he war surrounded by men, women,\r\nand young uns, who war beatin’ him with sticks, an’ tormentin’ him\r\nevery way they knowed how; but findin’ that they couldn’t make Pete\r\nshow fear--fur that war something he didn’t have in him--they left\r\nhim, when I came up, and pitched into me. I didn’t mind ’em much,\r\nhowsomever, although I _did_ wince jest the least bit when one feller\r\nstruck at me with his tomahawk, and jest grazed my face; but they\r\ndidn’t see it; an’ purty quick one big feller ketched me by the har,\r\nan’, arter draggin’ me up to the post, tied me with my back to Pete’s.\r\nIt then wanted ’bout three hours of sundown, an’ the Injuns, arter\r\nholdin’ a leetle council, made up their minds to have some fun; so\r\nthey untied me an’ Pete, an’ led us out on the prairy ’bout three or\r\nfour hundred yards, an’ thar left us. We looked back an’ seed the\r\nInjuns all drawed up in a line, with their we’pons in their hands, an’\r\nknowed that the varlets had give us a chance to run for our lives. In\r\ncourse they didn’t mean fur us to git away, but they wanted the fun\r\nof seein’ us run, never dreamin’ but some of their fleet braves would\r\nketch us afore we had gone fur. I never looked fur ’em to give us sich\r\na chance fur life as that, an’ I made up my mind that I would learn\r\n’em to think twice afore they give a white trapper the free use of his\r\nlegs ag’in. I a’most knowed I war safe, but I felt shaky ’bout Peter,\r\nfur the Injuns had shot him with two arrers afore they ketched him,\r\nan’ he war hurt bad. I didn’t think he could run far--nor he didn’t,\r\nneither; fur when we shook hands an’ wished each other good luck, he\r\nsaid to me, ‘Bob, I wish I had my rifle.’ He meant by that, if he had\r\nhis ole shootin’ iron in his hands, he wouldn’t die alone; he would\r\nhave fit the Injuns as long as he could stand. Wal, as I war sayin’,\r\nwe shook hands an’ bid each other good-by, an’ jest then I heered a\r\nyell. I jumped like a flash of lightnin’, an’ made t’wards a little\r\nbelt of tim’er which I could see, ’bout two miles acrost the prairy. I\r\nwar runnin’ fur my life, an’ I reckon I made the best time I knowed\r\nhow. I soon left poor Pete behind, an’, when I had gone about a mile,\r\nI heered a yell, that told me as plain as words, that he had been\r\nketched. I never stopped to look back, but kept straight ahead, an’\r\nin a few minits more I war in the woods. The yellin’ of the Injuns had\r\nbeen growin’ louder an’ louder, so I knowed that they were gainin’ on\r\nme, an’ that if I kept on they would soon ketch me; so, as soon as I\r\nfound myself fair in the tim’er, I turned square off to the right, an’\r\ntakin’ to every log I could find, so as to leave as leetle trail as\r\npossible fur them to foller, I ran ’bout a hundred yards further, an’\r\nthen dived into a thick clump of bushes, whar I hid myself in the\r\nleaves an’ brush. I had kinder bothered the varlets, for a leetle\r\nwhile arter, they came into the woods, an’ went on through, as if they\r\nthought I had kept on t’wards the prairy. But I knowed that they\r\nwouldn’t be fooled long; an’ when I heered by their yellin’ that they\r\nhad left the woods, I crawled out of the bushes to look up a better\r\nhidin’-place. Arter listenin’ an’ lookin’, to be sartin that thar war\r\nno Injuns ’round, I ag’in broke into a run, an’ finally found a holler\r\nlog at the bottom of a gully, whar I thought I had better stop; so I\r\ncrawled into the log, an’ jest then I heered the Injuns coming back.\r\nThey knowed that I war hid somewhar in the tim’er, an’ they all\r\nscattered through the woods, hopin’ to find me afore it ’come\r\ndark--yellin’ all the while, as though they didn’t feel very\r\ngood-natured ’bout bein’ fooled that ar’ way. I knowed that they\r\ncouldn’t foller my trail easy, but thar war so many of ’em, that I war\r\nafraid somebody might happen to stumble on my hidin’-place. But they\r\ndidn’t; an’ arter awhile it ’come dark, an’ the varlets had to give up\r\nthe search. I waited till every thing war still, an’ then crawled out\r\nof my log, and struck fur the prairy. I warn’t green enough to b’lieve\r\nthat they war all gone, fur I knowed that thar war Injuns layin’\r\n’round in them woods watchin’ an’ waitin’ fur me. In course I didn’t\r\nwant to come acrost none of ’em, fur I had no we’pon, and I would have\r\nbeen ketched sartin; so I war mighty keerful; an’ I b’lieve I war two\r\nhours goin’ through the hundred yards of woods that lay atween me an’\r\nthe prairy. When I reached the edge of the tim’er, I broke into a run.\r\nIf thar war any Injuns ’round, they couldn’t see me, fur the night war\r\ndark; an’ they couldn’t hear me, neither, fur my moccasins didn’t make\r\nno noise in the grass. I kept on, at a steady gait, fur ’bout two\r\nhours, an’ finally reached the place whar I war captur’d. Arter a\r\nleetle lookin’ and feelin’, I found my belt and we’pons. I felt a\r\nheap better then, fur I had something to defend myself with; but still\r\nI didn’t feel like laughin’, fur I war afoot, an’, havin’ no rifle, I\r\ncouldn’t think how I war to git grub to eat. But I war better off nor\r\nwhile I war a pris’ner ’mong the Injuns; so I knowed I hadn’t oughter\r\ncomplain. Arter takin’ one look at poor Bill, whom the Injuns, arter\r\nhavin’ scalped, had left whar he had fallen, an’ promisin’ that every\r\ntime I seed a Blackfoot Injun I would think of him, I ag’in sot out.\r\nArter I had gone ’bout half a mile further, the moon riz, an’, as I\r\nwar running along, I seed something ahead of me. I stopped to onct,\r\nfur I didn’t know but it might be a Injun; but another look showed me\r\nit war a hoss. He war feedin’ when he fust seed me, but, when he\r\nheered me comin’, he looked up, an’ give a leetle whinny that made me\r\nfeel like hollerin’. It war Bill Simons’s hoss. How glad I war to see\r\nhim! An’ he must a been glad to see me, too, fur he let me ketch him;\r\nan’ when I got on his back, I didn’t keer, jest then, fur all the\r\nInjuns on the plains. The critter had had a good rest, an’, when I\r\nspoke to him, he started off just as lively as though he war good fur\r\na hundred mile. Wal, I rid all that night, an’, ’arly the next\r\nmornin’, I found myself nigh a patch of woods whar we allers made our\r\ncamp when goin’ to an’ from the Saskatchewan, an’ I thought I would\r\nstop thar and git a leetle rest, fur I war tired an’ hungry. So I rid\r\nthrough the woods, an’, when I come in sight o’ our ole campin’\r\nground, I seed something that made me feel like hollerin’ ag’in; an’ I\r\n_did_ holler; fur thar war two of our comp’ny--the only ones that\r\n’scaped ’sides me--jest gettin’ ready to start off. They stopped when\r\nthey seed me--an’, youngsters, you may be sartin that we war glad to\r\nmeet each other ag’in. One of ’em war Bill Coffee, who I thought war\r\ndead. He war bad hurt, but he got off without losin’ his har, an’ he\r\nfelt mighty jolly over it. Arter they had told me ’bout their fight\r\nwith the Injuns--an’ they jest _did_ get away, an’ that war all--I\r\ntold ’em ’bout Bill Simons bein’ killed, and how me an’ Pete had run a\r\nrace with the varlets, an’ we all swore that the Blackfeet wouldn’t\r\nmake nothin’ by rubbin’ out them two fellers. I stayed thar long\r\nenough to rest a little an’ eat a piece of meat that one of ’em give\r\nme, an’ then we all sot out fur the fort, which we reached all right.\r\nWe laid ’round fur ’bout a month, an’ then--would you b’lieve it?--we\r\nthree fellers made up another comp’ny, an’ put fur the Saskatchewan\r\nag’in. None of us ever forgot our promise, an’ every time we drawed a\r\nbead on a Blackfoot, we thought of Bill an’ Pete Simons.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nHomeward Bound.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe travelers remained at the “ole bar’s hole” three weeks, instead of\r\none, as they had at first intended. Game of every description was\r\nplenty; there were no Indians to trouble them; in short, they were\r\nleading a life that exactly suited the boys, who were in no hurry to\r\nresume their journey, which was becoming tiresome to them. Besides,\r\ntheir supply of bacon was exhausted, and the trappers undertook to\r\nreplenish the commissary. This they did by “jerking” the meat of the\r\nbuffaloes that had been killed during the hunt in which Frank had\r\ntaken his involuntary ride. They cut the meat into thin strips, and\r\nhung it upon frames to dry--the sun and the pure atmosphere of the\r\nprairie did the rest. The meat was thoroughly cured without smoke or\r\nsalt, and although the boys did not relish it as well as the bacon,\r\nthey still found it very palatable. To Dick, it was like meeting with\r\nan old friend. He had always been accustomed to jerked Buffalo meat,\r\nand he ate great quantities of it, to the exclusion of corn-bread and\r\ncoffee, of which he had become very fond.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the gray mustang demanded a large share of their\r\nattention. He was very unruly, extremely vicious, and attempted to use\r\nhis teeth or heels upon every thing that approached him. But these\r\nactions did not in the least intimidate Dick, who was a most excellent\r\nhorseman; and, after several rides over the prairie, coupled with the\r\nmost severe treatment, he succeeded in subduing the gray, which was\r\nturned over to his young master, with the assurance that he was “a\r\nhoss as no sich ole buffaler hunter as Sleepy Sam could run away\r\nfrom.”\r\n\r\nThis declaration was instantly resisted by Archie, who forthwith\r\nchallenged Frank to a race; but it was not until the latter had fully\r\nsatisfied himself that the mustang was completely conquered that he\r\naccepted the proposition. When he had been robbed of his horse, Frank\r\nhad lost something that could not again be supplied, and that was his\r\nsaddle. As for a bridle, he soon found that the trapper’s lasso\r\ntwisted about the gray’s lower jaw, answered admirably; but it was a\r\nlong time before he could bring himself to believe that his blanket\r\ncould be made to do duty both as saddle and bed. After a week’s\r\npractice, however, he began to feel more at home on his new horse;\r\nand, one morning, as he rode out with his cousin, he informed him that\r\nhe was prepared for the race. Archie, always ready, at once put Sleepy\r\nSam at the top of his speed; but the gray king had lost none of his\r\nlightness of foot during his captivity, and before they had gone fifty\r\nyards he had carried Frank far ahead. Race after race came off that\r\nday, and each time Sleepy Sam was sadly beaten. Archie was compelled\r\nto acknowledge the gray’s superiority, and declared that he “wouldn’t\r\nmind camping with Black Bill himself if he could be certain of no\r\nworse treatment than Frank had received, and could gain as good a\r\nhorse as the gray king by the operation.”\r\n\r\nThe mustang having been thoroughly broken to saddle, and the travelers\r\nsupplied with meat, there was nothing now to detain them at the cave.\r\nSo, one morning Dick harnessed his mules, and they prepared to resume\r\ntheir journey. Before starting, however, the boys explored the “ole\r\nbar’s hole” for the twentieth time, and as long as they remained in\r\nsight, they turned to take a long, lingering look at the place which\r\nwas now associated with many exciting adventures.\r\n\r\nInstead of traveling back to the road the train had taken, the trapper\r\nled them southward, and, after a long and tedious journey through the\r\nmountains, they reached Bridget’s Pass, and a few days afterward they\r\narrived at a fort of the same name. They camped there one night, and\r\nthen turned their faces toward Salt Lake City, which they reached in\r\nsafety. Mr. Winters led the way to a hotel, where an excellent dinner\r\nwas served up for them. After passing more than two months in the\r\nsaddle, subsisting upon the plainest food, it is no wonder that the\r\nboys were glad to find themselves seated at a table once more. Fresh\r\nmeat and vegetables of all kinds disappeared before their attacks, and\r\nthey finally stopped because they were ashamed to eat more. After\r\ndinner, being informed by their uncle that they would remain in the\r\ncity until the following day, in order to give the trappers time to\r\nlay in a fresh supply of provisions, the boys started out to see the\r\nsights. Evidences of prosperity met their eyes on every side. Some of\r\nthe buildings were elegant, the streets broad and clean, and filled\r\nwith vehicles. Wagon trains were constantly coming and going, and the\r\nprincipal business seemed to be to supply these with provisions.\r\nArchie thought it must be a splendid place to live in, so near good\r\nhunting grounds; but he could not help glancing pityingly toward a\r\nyouth about his own age, whom they met on the street, and wondering\r\n“how many mothers that poor fellow had to boss him around.”\r\n\r\nWhen it began to grow dark they returned to their hotel, where they\r\nretired early. They thought they could enjoy a good night’s rest in a\r\ncomfortable bed, but their expectations were not realized. They could\r\nnot go to sleep. First, they thought the quilts were too heavy, and\r\nthey kicked them off on the floor. Then the mattress was too\r\nsoft--they could scarcely breathe--and after rolling and tossing for\r\nhalf the night, they spread the quilts on the floor, and there slept\r\nsoundly until morning.\r\n\r\nTheir journey through Utah and Nevada into California, was\r\naccomplished without incident worthy of note; and, in due time, they\r\narrived at Sacramento. Here it was that their uncle had been located\r\nprevious to his return to Lawrence, and consequently they were at\r\ntheir journey’s end. As soon as Mr. Winters had settled up his\r\nbusiness, they would return to the States by steamer. This was\r\ncommunicated to the trappers the morning after their arrival, and it\r\nwas an arrangement at which Dick was both surprised and grieved. After\r\na short consultation with old Bob, they both approached and announced\r\ntheir determination of returning to the mountains immediately.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to go sometime,” said Dick, “that ar’ sartin; an’ the\r\nlonger we stay, the harder it ’comes to leave.”\r\n\r\nMr. Winters then broached the subject of payment for their services,\r\nto which the trappers would not listen, neither would they accept the\r\noffer of the horses, mules, and wagon, Dick declaring that by acting\r\nas their guide he had found a “chum” in the oldest and best trapper on\r\nthe prairie, and that was worth more to him than any thing else. Money\r\nhe did not need; and as for the mules and wagon, he had no use for\r\nthem. And evidently wishing to bring the interview to a close, as\r\nsoon as possible, he hastily shook Mr. Winters by the hand, and bade\r\nhim good-by.\r\n\r\nHis parting from the boys was not so easily accomplished. He extended\r\na hand to each, and, for some moments, stood looking earnestly at\r\nthem, without speaking. At length, he said:\r\n\r\n“I don’t like to say good-by to you, youngsters. I had hoped that I\r\nshould guide you back to the States. But you know your own bisness\r\nbetter nor I do, so I oughtn’t to grumble. I wish you could allers\r\nstay with me. I’d take mighty good keer of you. But our trails lay in\r\ndifferent directions. You go back to your friends, an’ me an’ ole Bob\r\ngo to the mountains, to hunt, an’ trap, an’ fight Injuns, as we have\r\ndone fur many a long year.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll need a horse then, Dick,” interrupted Frank. “You certainly\r\nwill not refuse the gray king! Take him, and keep him to remember us\r\nby.”\r\n\r\n“Youngsters,” said the trapper, struggling hard to keep back something\r\nthat appeared to be rising in his throat, “it don’t need no hoss to\r\nmake me ’member you. But I’ll take him, howsomever, as a present from\r\nyou, an’ every time I look at him, I shall think of you away off in\r\nthe States.”\r\n\r\n“And, Dick,” chimed in Archie, “if you ever see Black Bill, don’t\r\nforget that he stole my relics.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t forget it, little ’un. An’ now, good-by. It aint no ways\r\nlikely that we shall ever see each other ag’in; but I hope that when\r\nyou git hum, an’ tell your friends of your trip acrost the plains,\r\nthat you will give one thought to your ole friend Dick Lewis, the\r\ntrapper. Good-by, youngsters.”\r\n\r\nThe guide wrung their hands, and then gave way to old Bob, who also\r\nseemed to regret that the parting time had come; and when the\r\nfarewells had all been said, the trappers mounted their horses, rode\r\nrapidly down the street and disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt was not at all probable that the boys would ever forget those\r\nrough, but kind-hearted men--for the guides held a prominent place in\r\ntheir affections. Although they were in a busy city, surrounded by\r\nfriends--for Mr. Winters had a large circle of acquaintances in\r\nSacramento--they were lonesome now that the trappers had gone, and\r\ntheir thoughts often wandered off in search of those two men, now on\r\ntheir lonely journey to the mountains.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two weeks Mr. Winters had settled up his business, and,\r\none morning, they took the stage for Benicia; thence they went by boat\r\nto San Francisco. Here they took passage on board a mail steamer to\r\nPanama, thence by rail to Aspinwall, where they found another steamer,\r\nthat took them safely to Boston. At Portland, which they reached in\r\ndue time, they remained a week, and then all set out for Lawrence.\r\nFrank had written to his mother when to expect them, and they found\r\nall the inmates of the cottage on the watch. As the carriage that\r\nbrought them from the wharf drew up before the gate, Brave announced\r\nthe fact by a joyful bark, that brought Mrs. Nelson and Julia to the\r\ndoor, where the travelers were warmly received. Besides strong frames,\r\nsunburnt faces, and good appetites, the boys brought back from the\r\nplains a fund of stories that was not exhausted that evening, nor the\r\nnext, and even at the end of two weeks they still had something to\r\ntalk about. The skins of the bears were stuffed and mounted, side by\r\nside, in the museum, together with those of several prairie wolves,\r\nbig-horns, and that of the antelope the boys had killed the morning\r\nthey were lost on the prairie. Archie never grew tired of relating\r\nthe particulars of his adventure with the grizzly, and when he told\r\nof their being lost, he never forgot to mention how Sleepy Sam had\r\n“landed him in the water.”\r\n\r\nAnd now that the young hunters were among their friends again, did\r\nthey ever “give one thought” to their guide? They often talked of\r\nhim--his stories were still fresh in their memories, and his many acts\r\nof kindness could never be forgotten. Whenever they recounted their\r\nadventures, or related the little history of the new objects they had\r\nmounted in their museum, they always spoke of him, and many an earnest\r\nwish went out from them for the welfare of DICK LEWIS, THE TRAPPER. In\r\ntheir subsequent career in the gun-boat service, they often related\r\nincidents of his life to their messmates.\r\n\r\n                             THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    New and Attractive Juveniles,\r\n\r\n    FOR SALE BY\r\n\r\n    R.
