In the present little volume, as well as in two others that\r\nare to follow, and which, together, will comprise the INVERTEBRAL\r\nANIMALS, the method of M. LAMARCK will be adhered to. It is true, that,\r\nsince the works of that naturalist were published, many deviations\r\nfrom certain parts of his system have taken place, some of which have\r\nreceived the sanction of the highest names; but still, _as a whole_,\r\nLamarck’s System remains unrivalled, and the young naturalist can\r\nreadily add to the information it contains, by reference to the works\r\nof more recent authors, in case he has sufficient inclination and\r\nindustry to follow out the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Page\r\n    Introductory

cannot fail to have been delighted with the\r\nwonderful and appropriate faculties bestowed upon each individual;\r\nbut, beautiful and well adapted to the use of their possessors as\r\nthese faculties may have appeared, our pleasure must be still greater\r\nin tracing the powers with which those creatures are endowed, which\r\nconstitute what we have been accustomed to call the lower orders of\r\nanimated nature.\r\n\r\nWhen contemplating the graceful form of the horse or the stag, or\r\nthe beautiful plumage of the feathered tribes, or when we notice the\r\nterrific appearance of the crocodile, or the elaborate finish and\r\nmetallic lustre of the scales of fishes, we are led to expect that\r\nequal care has been bestowed upon the rest of the organization of the\r\ndifferent individuals, and that equal attention has been paid to the\r\nvarious instincts and powers that are necessary to their preservation;\r\nbut when we observe a snail, or a worm, and compare their more simple\r\nappearance, and the perfect absence of what we have been accustomed to\r\nconsider the organs of motion, namely, feet and hands, we are apt to\r\nlook on them as having been created for some very subordinate purpose,\r\nand, therefore, less carefully formed than the vertebral animals. How\r\nmuch greater then must be our delight, when we find them possessed\r\nof every power necessary to their state of existence, as beautifully\r\ndeveloped, and as carefully adapted to their necessities, as the\r\nhighest instincts of other classes are to their possessors. Nor is\r\ntheir organization to be considered less perfect, because we are unable\r\nto trace it in all its ramifications; the minute branches of the nerves\r\nof the human body are, not only invisible to the naked eye, but even\r\nto the most acute observer when assisted by the magnifying power of\r\nthe microscope, but we are certain that they do exist, from the pain\r\nwe feel when they are injured. Until lately, the _Infusoria_, those\r\nmicroscopic animals that are found in infusions of vegetable substances\r\nin water, were supposed to be possessed of neither nerves nor stomach,\r\nand to be fed by absorption; but the ingenious experiments of a learned\r\nforeigner have proved, that, instead of being without a stomach,\r\nthey are provided with as many as five or six: it is true, that the\r\nnerves have not yet been detected, but we have a right to infer their\r\nexistence from their effects; so that these minute creatures, which we\r\nhave been accustomed to consider as nearly destitute of organs, are, in\r\nfact, beautifully formed, and as perfect in their kind as any other of\r\nthe Creator’s works.\r\n\r\nThe second DIVISION of the objects of natural history, namely, the\r\nINVERTEBRAL animals, which we have now to describe, are placed by\r\nthemselves, on account of their being without an internal skeleton,\r\nconsisting of a series of vertebræ, or bones of the back. This\r\ndistinction is explained in the introductory chapter to the Book of\r\nAnimals. They have been separated, by Lamarck, into Eleven CLASSES,\r\nnamely:—\r\n\r\n  1. MOLLUSCA, (_soft-bodied animals_,) in general covered\r\n        with a shell; as, for instance, a snail; or without a\r\n        shell, as a slug.\r\n\r\n  2. CONCHIFERA, (_shell-bearing animals_,) with a shell,\r\n        consisting of two valves, as an oyster or mussel.\r\n\r\n  3. CIRRHIPEDA, (_with feet like cirri, or hairs_.) The inhabitant\r\n        of the acorn-shell, found on the back of the larger kind of\r\n        shell-fish, &c., is an instance of this class.\r\n\r\n  4. ANNELIDA, (_with body formed of rings_;) of this class\r\n        the leech and the earth-worm are instances.\r\n\r\n  5. CRUSTACEA, (_covered with a hard case_,) crabs, lobsters, &c.\r\n\r\n  6. ARACHNIDÆ, _Spiders_.\r\n\r\n  7. INSECTA, _Insects_. A perfect insect has always six legs.\r\n\r\n  8. TUNICATA, (_enclosed in a case of a leathery consistence_.)\r\n\r\n  9. VERMES, _Worms_. With lengthened body without divisions;\r\n        for instance, worms found in the intestines.\r\n\r\n  10. RADIARIÆ, (_radiated animals_,) with the different parts\r\n        of which they are formed arranged like rays round one\r\n        common centre; as, for instance, the Star-fish.\r\n\r\n  11. POLYPI, (_many feet_.) The animal that forms the Coral\r\n        is a Polypus.\r\n\r\n  12. INFUSORIA, (_Infusory animals_.) These are found in\r\n        infusions of vegetable substances in water, and are,\r\n        in general, too small to be visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nIn the present little book we shall treat of the first five of these\r\nClasses.\r\n\r\nThe Molluscous animals are, on account of their organization, placed\r\nfirst among the invertebral animals, a few of the species resembling,\r\nin some respects, the more simply-formed fishes.\r\n\r\nThe systematic arrangement of the Molluscous animals, considered\r\nnot only as regards their shells, but having reference also to the\r\nanatomical distinctions of the creatures themselves, is a modern study.\r\nIn ancient authors we merely find a few scattered facts, the beauty of\r\nthe shells attracting their notice more than the value or nature of the\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nAlthough, at the first glance, the inhabitants of shells appear to\r\nbe beings of a very uninteresting nature, a due consideration of the\r\nvaluable properties of many, and the usefulness of all, will enable\r\nus to perceive, that, regarding them merely in an interested point of\r\nview, they are worthy of the strictest attention of the naturalist.\r\nIn the first place, the whole of them afford food for the different\r\nspecies of fish, and other inhabitants of the deep. The Tyrian dye, the\r\nroyal purple of the ancients, was produced by the inhabitant of a small\r\nunivalve shell, of the genus Purpura. That beautiful ornament in dress,\r\nthe oriental pearl, is the consequence of disease in a species of\r\nmussel, and the inner portion of the shell of the same animal, is the\r\nwell-known substance, mother-of-pearl. A kind of silk is obtained from\r\nthe beard of the pinna, which, in some places, is made into gloves. As\r\nan article of food we may mention the well-known oyster, the mussel,\r\nscallop, &c., and some of the larger kinds form no small portion of\r\nthe subsistence of the natives of the South-Sea Islands, and the Negro\r\npopulation in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe _Teredo navalis_, or ship-worm, has, by its destructive powers,\r\nruined the noblest vessels, and rendered useless the timbers, on which\r\nmany of the constructions in harbours mainly depend for security; on\r\nthis account great attention has been bestowed on its natural history\r\nand habits. The barnacle, which attaches itself to the bottoms of\r\nships, renders the planks so foul, as to interfere materially with\r\nthe rate of sailing of the vessel itself. These are only a few of the\r\nuseful and noxious qualities of these inhabitants of the deep.\r\n\r\nThe shell with which a Molluscous animal is covered, is absolutely\r\nnecessary to protect its delicate body from injury; this shell is, in\r\ngeneral, composed of much the same substances as bone; but the bone of\r\na bird, or quadruped, is formed by the agency of the blood, and the\r\nparticles of which it is composed are deposited by that fluid, and\r\nagain taken up and restored to the circulation, a circumstance which\r\ndoes not take place in the substance of a shell. The shell is formed\r\nby the deposition of layer upon layer, in the course of the growth of\r\nthe animal, and the ridges we perceive on many shells, point out their\r\nperiodical increase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig 1. Fig 2._]\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary, when describing the distinctions between shells\r\nof different genera, to use several terms, which will, unless properly\r\ndefined, be, perhaps, unintelligible to young people. The annexed\r\ndiagrams will explain the meaning of those of most frequent occurrence\r\namong the Mollusca. Fig. 1, represents a univalve shell; fig. 2,\r\nanother shell, of the same division, cut through the middle, for the\r\npurpose of showing the columella, or pillar. Many shells, as, for\r\ninstance, the periwinkle, (_Turbo vulgaris_,) have what is called\r\nan operculum, (_a lid_,) which closes the opening, and protects the\r\ninhabitant from injury. In the case of the periwinkle, this lid is of\r\nhorny nature, but, in many species it is hard and solid, like the shell\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS MOLLUSCA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn noticing the animal of a univalve shell, the part which more readily\r\nattracts the attention is the mantle, which covers the head of the\r\ncreature, something like a hood; it varies much in form and size in\r\ndifferent genera. The eyes, which in the sepia are amazingly large and\r\nbrilliant, are very minute in most of the other tribes, although they\r\nare frequently visible, and would appear, from their formation, to be\r\nof little use as organs of sight; indeed, it is supposed, that in the\r\nsnail they are devoted to the sense of smelling.\r\n\r\nThe organs of motion in the Mollusca, according to their different\r\nform and position, give names to most of the orders; these consist of\r\nmuscular expansions of the body, by means of which the animal swims or\r\ndrags itself along the ground. The gills, or breathing apparatus, are\r\nsituated internally, and communicate with the air or water, by means of\r\na small canal opening outwardly. The mouth is usually concealed from\r\nview when the creature is at rest; in some, this organ is furnished\r\nwith a hard substance, which supplies the place of teeth, while, in\r\nothers, it is in the form of a projecting tube. The greatest portion\r\nof these creatures are produced in the water, the tribes that inhabit\r\nthat element, exceeding by far those that are to be found upon the land.\r\n\r\nThe Molluscous animals have been separated into the five following\r\nOrders:—\r\n\r\n  1. HETEROPODA, (_with feet, or organs of motion,\r\n        not uniform in all species_.)\r\n\r\n  2. CEPHALOPODA, (_with feet, or organs of motion,\r\n        attached to the head_.)\r\n\r\n  3. TRACHELIPODA, (_with feet, or organs of motion,\r\n        attached to the neck, near the gills_.)\r\n\r\n  4. GASTEROPODA, (_with feet, or organs of motion,\r\n        attached to the stomach_.)\r\n\r\n  5. PTEROPODA, (_with feet, or organs of motion,\r\n        like wings_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER HETEROPODA._\r\n\r\nThe creatures belonging to this order, says Lamarck may be considered\r\nas the first vestiges of the appearance of a series of marine animals,\r\nintermediate in their formation between the fishes and the Cephalopods;\r\nthey are all natives of hot climates, and possess a body of a jelly-like\r\nsubstance, and so transparent as to be seen with difficulty when\r\nfloating in the water. They do not all possess shells, and are less\r\nknown than they otherwise would be, on account of the great difficulty\r\nthere is in preserving them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLASSY CARINARIA, (_Carinaria vitrea_.)\r\n\r\nThis singular animal is rarely taken, on account of its delicate and\r\nperishable substance; it is found in the Southern Ocean. It will be\r\nseen, on referring to the engraving, that the shell which it bears\r\nmerely covers a portion of its body, that in which the most material\r\norgans of the animal are found, namely, the heart and the branchiæ, or\r\norgans of breathing. These are most curiously placed on the upper part\r\nof its body, projecting from it and protected by a delicately white\r\nand transparent shell, shaped like a little cap, and of a substance\r\nresembling glass. The creature is able to enlarge its body by filling\r\nit with water, and in swimming the back is undermost. The shell, which\r\nseldom exceeds an inch in length, has been sought after by collectors\r\nwith great assiduity, and has, at times, fetched as much as ten guineas\r\nat a sale; a perfect specimen is very rarely met with. There is a wax\r\nmodel of one of these shells in the British Museum, nearly two inches\r\nwide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GLASSY CARINARIA, (_Carinaria vitrea_.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER CEPHALOPODA._\r\n\r\nThe Cephalopods have been so named by Cuvier, from being furnished\r\nwith a kind of inarticulated arms which surround the head. We find\r\namong this class some of the most singular productions of the waters;\r\nthey differ materially from each other, and have been separated into\r\nthree groups; first, those without any external shell, as the Sepia;\r\nsecondly, the inhabitants of a shell without any divisions, as the\r\nArgonaut; and, thirdly, those whose shell is divided into numerous\r\nchambers, as the Nautilus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUTTLE FISH, (_Sepia officinalis_.)\r\n\r\nThe Cuttle Fish, of which there are many different species, is a native\r\nof all the temperate and tropical seas. Its body is, in general, of\r\nan irregular oval shape, and of a jelly-like substance, and usually\r\ncovered with a coarse skin, having the appearance of leather. Unlike\r\nall other inhabitants of the water which are without a backbone, the\r\nSepia possesses two large and brilliant eyes, covered with a hard\r\ntransparent substance.\r\n\r\nThe Cuttle Fish, figured in the engraving, is furnished in front\r\nwith eight arms or feelers, with which it grapples with its enemy,\r\nor conveys its prey to its mouth. These arms are most curiously\r\nconstructed, and afford it ample means of defence; they possess in\r\nthemselves a strong muscular power, and this is materially assisted\r\nby numerous cups or suckers, placed along the whole of their inner\r\nsurface, with which they fasten themselves to any object they come in\r\ncontact with. These feelers appear to be also endued with some peculiar\r\npower, of a galvanic nature; since the pain which they inflict does not\r\ncease for a long time after the removal of the animal, leaving a kind\r\nof stinging sensation, like that produced by nettles, which remains for\r\nmany hours, and is followed by a troublesome irritation and itching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CUTTLE FISH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAK OF A CEPHALOPOD.]\r\n\r\nThe size to which this creature grows has been variously stated; and,\r\nalthough evidently exaggerated by some authors, there can be no doubt\r\nthat it attains a very considerable magnitude. When attacked in its own\r\nelement, it has been known, even in the seas of temperate latitudes,\r\ncapable of overcoming a powerful mastiff. The jaws of all this tribe\r\nare, likewise, extremely strong, formed like the beak of a parrot, and\r\nvery hard. In addition to these means of defence, it possesses within\r\nits body a bladder, containing an inky-coloured fluid, which it has the\r\npower of throwing out at will, and, by thus discolouring the water, it\r\nescapes the pursuit of its enemies. This inky liquid, when dried, forms\r\na very valuable colour, used by artists, and called, after the animal,\r\n_Sepia_. The eggs of the female are of an oval form, and joined to each\r\nother in clusters. They are of the size of filberts, of a black colour,\r\nand commonly known by the name of _Sea Grapes_. They are found attached\r\nto sea-weed, rocks, and other marine substances.\r\n\r\nThe Cuttle Fish generally remains with its body in some hole in a rock,\r\nwhile its arms are extended in every direction, to seize the wanderer\r\nthat may chance to pass its place of ambush. Its appetite is voracious,\r\nand it seizes as its prey every living thing that it has the power to\r\nconquer.\r\n\r\nThe species figured in the engraving is very common on the English\r\ncoasts, and the bone which is enclosed in its body is frequently found\r\non the sands; it is a well-known substance, and much employed in the\r\nmanufacture of tooth-powder. This bone, which, with the exception of\r\nthe jaws, is the only solid part in the Sepia, differs in shape in\r\nthe different species, but is always somewhat oval in its form, though\r\nvarying considerably in texture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARGONAUT, (_Argonauta argo_.)\r\n\r\n    The tender Nautilus that steers its prow,\r\n    The sea-born sailor in its light canoe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He, when the lightning-winged tornadoes sweep\r\n    The surge, is safe; his home is in the deep.\r\n    He triumphs o’er the armadas of mankind,\r\n    That shake the world, but tremble in the wind.\r\n\r\nThe curious inhabitant of this elegant shell has, from the earliest\r\nages, excited the admiration of the student in natural history; and,\r\nat the same time, its real place in the system has eluded the research\r\nof the most acute observers. The animal agrees, in many points, with\r\nthe sepia, or cuttle fish, which never possesses a shelly covering, so\r\nthat, had it been found without that beautiful addition, naturalists\r\nwould have referred it, without hesitation, to that particular division\r\nof the dwellers in the deep; it is, however, always met with along\r\nwith the shell; and, although there appears to be no bond of union\r\nbetween the tenant and its dwelling, still the purposes to which it\r\napplies it, imply, at any rate, a long-continued occupancy, if they do\r\nnot absolutely point out the Nautilus as the original architect of the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThe name Argonaut has been applied to this sea-born navigator from its\r\nresemblance, when floating on the surface of the waves, to a vessel in\r\nfull sail, Argo being the name of the ship, which was supposed to have\r\nbeen the first fitted out for commercial adventure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARGONAUT, OR PAPER NAUTILUS.]\r\n\r\nIn calm Summer days, these beautiful little creatures may be seen, in\r\nconsiderable numbers, steering their little barks on the surface of the\r\nwaters of the Mediterranean. The words of the ancient Roman naturalist,\r\nPliny, give a pleasing description of its habits. “Among the principal\r\nmiracles of nature,” says he, “is the animal called Nautilos, or\r\nPompilos: it ascends to the surface of the sea, in a supine posture,\r\nand, gradually raising itself up, forces out, by means of its tube,\r\nall the water from its shell, in order that it may swim more readily;\r\nthen, throwing back the two foremost arms, it displays between them a\r\nmembrane of wonderful tenuity, which acts as a sail, while, with the\r\nremaining arms, it rows itself along, the tail in the middle acting as\r\na helm to direct its course, and thus it pursues its voyage; and, if\r\nalarmed by any appearance of danger, takes in the water and descends.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the Argonaut has never yet been discovered attached to its\r\nshell, some observations which have been recently made on the Pearly\r\nNautilus, which very nearly resembles it, have almost proved that\r\nsuch a connexion does really exist. But whether the shell is formed\r\nby itself, or only used to assist the creature in its movements, the\r\ninstinct displayed is not the less wonderful, or worthy of observation.\r\nThe Mediterranean, and warmer parts of the Atlantic, abound in these\r\ninteresting animals, and one species is also found in the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEARLY NAUTILUS, (_Nautilus pompilius_.)\r\n\r\nThe inhabitant of this singular shell had long been sought after\r\nwith eagerness by naturalists, and it is only within these few years\r\nthat its true nature has been ascertained. We are indebted for this\r\nknowledge to the researches of the late Mr. George Bennet, who, while\r\nengaged in a voyage among the Polynesian Islands, captured a specimen\r\ncontaining a living animal, which was brought to England, and is now\r\ndeposited in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in London.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the Nautilus, as may be seen by the engraving, is divided\r\ninto numerous cells. The use of these cells to the animal we are now\r\ndescribing, was formerly not well understood, but they were supposed to\r\nbe employed, by their inhabitant, for the purpose of rising or sinking\r\nin the Water at will. The body of this _Cephalopod_, it will be seen,\r\nonly occupies the outer cell of its habitation, its increased size\r\nhaving rendered it too large to remain in that preceding it. If, as\r\nthe animal deserted its smaller tenements, one after the other, they\r\nhad been filled, up with solid matter, the shell would have become too\r\ncumbersome for its owner; so that we have here another proof of the\r\nproviding care of the Creator. We shall describe, in Mr. Bennet’s own\r\nwords, the capture of this interesting object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEARLY NAUTILUS,\r\n\r\nShowing the Animal, and a Section of its Shell.]\r\n\r\n“It was on the twenty-fourth of August, 1829, (calm and fine weather,\r\nthermometer at noon 79°,) in the evening, when the ship Sophia was\r\nlying at anchor, in Marakini Bay, on the south-west side of the island\r\nof Erromanga, one of the New Hebrides group, Southern Pacific Ocean,\r\nthat something was seen floating on the surface of the water, at\r\nsome distance from the ship; to many it appeared like a small dead\r\ntortoise-shell cat, which would have been such an unusual object in\r\nthis part of the world, that the boat, which was alongside of the ship\r\nat the time, was sent for the purpose of ascertaining the nature of the\r\nfloating object.”\r\n\r\n“On approaching near, it was observed to be the shell-fish, commonly\r\nknown by the name of the Pearly Nautilus: it was captured and brought\r\non board; but the shell was shattered from having been struck with\r\nthe boat-hook, in taking it, as the animal was sinking when the boat\r\napproached, and, had it not been so damaged, it would have escaped. I\r\nextracted the fish in a perfect state, which was firmly attached to\r\neach side of the cavity of the shell.” The hood has been stated by Dr.\r\nShaw, as being “of a pale, reddish-purple colour, with deeper sports\r\nand variegations,” the colour, however, as it appeared in this recent\r\nspecimen, was of a dark reddish-brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHELL OF THE NAUTILUS; AND THE SEA-PEN, OR INTERNAL\r\nSHELL OF THE LOLIGO.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this is the only instance of the animal itself having been\r\nbrought to this country, there is but little doubt of its having been\r\nfrequently taken, but as the shell was the object of the captors, and\r\nnot its inhabitant the latter has been thrown away as useless. An\r\noffice in his Majesty’s Navy found a Nautilus in a hole in a reef of\r\nrocks, near an island on the Eastern coast of Africa; the mantle of the\r\nfish, like a thin membrane, covered the shell, which was drawn in as\r\nsoon as it was touched, and the elegant shell was then displayed. “I\r\nand others,” says the same informant, “when it was first seen did not\r\nnotice it, regarding the animal, as the membrane enveloped the shell,\r\nmerely as a piece of blubber; but having touched it by accident, the\r\nmembranous covering was drawn in, and we soon secured our beautiful\r\nprize.”\r\n\r\nRumphius, a German naturalist, appears to have been acquainted with\r\nits habits; he says, “When he thus floats upon the water, he puts out\r\nhis head, and all his barbs, and spreads them on the water, with the\r\npoop of the shell above water: but at the bottom he creeps in a reverse\r\nposition, with his boat above him, and with his head and barbs upon the\r\nground, making a tolerably quick progress. He keeps himself chiefly on\r\nthe ground, creeping sometimes also into the nets of the fishermen: but\r\nafter a storm, as the weather becomes calm, they are seen in troops\r\nfloating on the water, being driven up by the agitation of the waves.\r\nThis sailing, however, is not of long continuance, for having taken\r\nin all their tentacles, they upset their boat, and so return to the\r\nbottom.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER TRACHELIPODA._\r\n\r\nThe Trachelipodes contain by far the largest portion of the univalve\r\nshells, and are mostly inhabitants of the waters. They form two\r\nnumerous groups, the feeders on animal food, (_Zoophagi_,) and those\r\nthat exist on vegetable substances, (_Phytophagi_.) The animal feeders\r\nare well distinguished from the other group, by having a mouth without\r\njaws, being furnished with a tube which they can retract or advance at\r\npleasure, for the purpose of sucking their nutriment from the bodies\r\nof other inhabitants of the deep. The animal feeders are also known\r\nfrom the other section by the possession of a projecting tube called a\r\n_siphon_, which conveys the water to the gills. The shell also points\r\nout to which section its possessor belonged, from the lower part of\r\nits opening being formed either into a sort of canal, or a groove for\r\nthe reception of its siphon. They are all marine animals, and breathe\r\nwater. The flesh-eating tribes compose five families.\r\n\r\n  FAMILY CONVOLUTA,    (_rolled up like a scroll_.)\r\n  FAMILY COLUMELLARIA, (_distinguished by a plaited columella_.)\r\n  FAMILY PURPURIFERA,  (_yielding a purple colour_.)\r\n  FAMILY ALATA,        (_winged_.)\r\n  FAMILY CANALIFERA    (_having a canal at the base of the opening_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY _CONVOLUTA_.\r\n\r\nThe convoluted shells contain but few genera; but these are very rich\r\nin species, and furnish us with some of the most beautiful specimens of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDERS ON ANIMAL FOOD, (ZOOPHAGI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARBLE CONE, (_Conus marmoreus_.)\r\n\r\nLamarck notices no less than 181 recent species of the Cone shell. The\r\nMarbled Cone figured below, is found in most of the Asiatic seas, and\r\nis not uncommon; it is of a dusky colour, and covered with angular\r\nwhite spots. The section of this shell points out in a remarkable\r\nmanner the economy and providence of the Creator, so visible in all his\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Voluta diadema. Conus marmoreus. Columbella\r\nmercatoria._]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen on referring to the engraving, that the shell is\r\nmuch thicker in the outward part of its coat than in any other part;\r\nand this exceeding thickness is necessary for the protection of the\r\nsoft body of its inhabitant. In the course of the growth of the\r\nanimal the shell is enlarged, and that part that was external becomes\r\ninternal, the last made portion of the shell forming the outer wall;\r\nif, therefore, the inner part of the shell retained its original\r\nthickness, its weight would become too great for its possessor. To\r\nguard against this inconvenience, and this useless waste of material,\r\nthe creature possesses the power of absorbing so much of the substance\r\nof what now becomes the internal portion of its dwelling as is\r\nunnecessary for its present use, and of re-depositing the same on the\r\noutward wall of its mansion, where strength is most required[1].\r\n\r\nThe Cones, says Lamarck, are the most beautiful of all the univalve\r\nshells; the genus comprises the most valuable and the most remarkable\r\nspecimens of this family, whether we look at the regularity of their\r\nform or the splendour of their colours. The beauty of many, but,\r\nabove all, the extreme rarity of others, have given them a species of\r\ncelebrity, and have caused them to be much sought after by collectors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Oliva porphyria._]\r\n\r\nThe Cones are found in the seas of hot climates, in from ten to twelve\r\nfathom water. The animal of the Cones has the head furnished with two\r\ntentaculæ, or horns, with the eyes on the summits; they only inhabit\r\nsalt waters.\r\n\r\nThe genus Oliva is distinguished from the Cones by the groove or canal\r\nwhich separates the turns of their spire, and by the wrinkles on the\r\ncolumella. The Porphyry Olive is found in the South American Seas, on\r\nthe Brazilian coast, and is the most beautiful and the largest species\r\nof the genus; it is of a flesh colour, with numerous lines of a reddish\r\nbrown, forming angular figures of various forms, and covered with\r\nirregular-formed spots of a red or maroon colour. Its length is nearly\r\nfour inches. There are nearly seventy species of this beautiful shell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONEY COWRIE, (_Cypræa moneta_.)\r\n\r\nThe Money Cowrie of Guinea is very common on the Indian and African\r\ncoasts; and is used by many of the inhabitants of Africa as a\r\ncirculating medium; it is also employed for the same purpose in\r\nHindoostan, particularly at Calcutta, where great quantities are\r\nobtained from the inhabitants of the Maldive Islands in exchange for\r\nrice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cypræa moneta._]\r\n\r\nMany tons of Cowries are annually shipped from England to Guinea;\r\nthese having been originally brought from the Maldive Islands to\r\nBengal, and from thence sent into this country. The value of these\r\nshells as a circulating medium depends naturally enough on their\r\ngreater or less abundance.\r\n\r\nIn Bengal, in general, from 2000 to 2400 are equal in value to a\r\nshilling. But in Africa they are much dearer, about 250 being valued at\r\na shilling.\r\n\r\nThe Cowrie shell is found of three different forms, according to\r\nits age. First, in its extreme youth, when the shell is extremely\r\nimperfect, and is like a slender one, without any appearance of the\r\nusual characters of the genius. Secondly, when half-grown; it then\r\nbegins to assume the form of the perfect shell, but is extremely\r\nslight, and colourless, and the point of its spire projects. Thirdly,\r\nwhen perfect; it has now received a second deposit of shelly matter, in\r\nwhich its specific colours appear, and its spire is completely hidden.\r\nThe second deposit with which the shell is covered, is secreted by the\r\ntwo membranous wings of the creature’s mantle, which, in the adult\r\nstate of the animal, have rapidly increased and become extremely large,\r\nso much so, as to be capable of covering the whole of the shell, while\r\nthe deposition of the new matter is taking place.\r\n\r\nLamarck says the observations of the habits of this creature tend to\r\nprove that, in addition to the power of completing its shell, as we\r\nhave already noticed, it can, when its increased size has caused it to\r\nrequire a new habitation, desert its former shell and form a new one;\r\nfrom this it happens that the same individual can form successively\r\nmany shells of different sizes, so that we find the same species both\r\nlarge and small.\r\n\r\nWhen not in search of food, these animals are found buried in the sand,\r\nat some distance from the sea-shore, in temperate as well as in hot\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY _COLUMELLARIA_.\r\n\r\nThis family is distinguished, from the next in having the columella\r\nplaited, and a notch at its base. It does not include any shells with a\r\nplaited columella, the opening at the base being entirely smooth, that\r\nis, without a notch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIADEM WHORL SHELL, (_Voluta diadema_.)\r\n\r\nThe Diadem Whorl Shell is a very beautiful specimen of its genus; it\r\nis marbled with white upon a yellow ground, but the markings become\r\nnearly obliterated by age: it is as much as seven inches in length, and\r\nis found in the Asiatic seas. The head of the animal of this shell has\r\ntwo pointed tentaculæ, with an eye at the outer base of each. Its mouth\r\nis a lengthened cylindrical and retractile tube, furnished with little\r\nhooked teeth; it has also a tube to conduct the water to the branchiæ,\r\nspringing out obliquely behind the head.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON COLUMBELLA, (_Columbella mercatoria_.)\r\n\r\nThe common Columbella is found in the Atlantic Ocean near the island\r\nof Gorée, and in the West India Islands; it is about three quarters of\r\nan inch in length. It is a sea-shell, and is found upon the coast; it\r\npossesses a very small oval operculum attached to its foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY _PURPURIFERA_.\r\n\r\nThe notch at the base of the shells of this family is a kind of groove\r\nbent backwards and upwards, but not properly forming a canal, all\r\nthe genera have an operculum. The name Purpurifera has been given to\r\nthese Trachelipodes, because some of the genera contain in a peculiar\r\nreservoir the colouring-matter with which the Romans, and other ancient\r\nnations, dyed their beautiful and well-known purple, which was so much\r\nin use before the discovery of cochineal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC HARP SHELL, (_Harpa musica_.)\r\n\r\nThe Harp shells are found in the Indian seas, and in great abundance\r\nalso in the Red Sea. A very curious fact appears in the history of the\r\nanimal of the Harp which deserves notice. It was observed a long time\r\nback by a German naturalist named Bon, but had since then been either\r\nforgotten or disbelieved: a recent traveller has confirmed its truth,\r\nalthough he notices it as a new discovery; it is as follows:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Harpa musica._]\r\n\r\nThe foot of the animal has the power of dividing itself into two\r\nportions; and one, namely, the hinder portion, can be separated from\r\nits body by the animal, when it finds itself suddenly in danger, and\r\nwishes to retire into the deepest recess of its shell; on this account\r\nit is without an operculum, which would evidently be useless, as it\r\nwould be lost at the same time as the foot.\r\n\r\nThe Harps, says Lamarck, are very beautiful shells, and if they were\r\nless common, would, on account of their elegant forms and colours,\r\nbecome valuable in a collection. Some species, however, are still\r\nconsidered rare.\r\n\r\nThe Harps take their name from the fancied resemblance between the\r\nregularity and direction of the ribs on the shell, and the strings of a\r\nharp. The species are not numerous, not exceeding eight in number.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIDE-MOUTHED PURPURA, (_Purpura patula_.)\r\n\r\nThis species of Purpura is said to be that which was employed by the\r\nRomans in dyeing, but many others of the same family yield a purple\r\ncolouring-matter. It is nearly three inches in length, and is found in\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe purple colour which this little Molluscous animal produces, was\r\ndiscovered by the inhabitants of the ancient city of Tyre, and was\r\nthence called the Tyrian purple. The circumstances which led to the\r\ndiscovery of it are very imperfectly known, but fiction has supplied\r\nthe want of historical facts, and described its origin with sufficient\r\nminuteness of detail. According to one account, the merit of its\r\ndiscovery is due to a dog belonging to a certain Hercules. We are\r\ninformed that when this dog was accompanying his master along the\r\nsea-shore, who was then following the nymph Tyros, the animal seized\r\none of the Purpuræ lying on the sand, and breaking the shell with his\r\nteeth, his mouth soon became coloured with the purple juice. The nymph\r\nhaving observed the effect, immediately expressed a strong desire to\r\nhave a dress dyed of the same beautiful colour; and her lover, no less\r\nanxious to gratify her wishes, at last succeeded in discovering a\r\nmethod of applying it to cloth.\r\n\r\nThis colour was so highly valued by the ancients, that it was either\r\nconsecrated to the worship of the Deity, or conceived to be fit only\r\nfor the garments of royalty.\r\n\r\nUnder the Mosaic dispensation, the stuffs for the service of the altar\r\nand the habits of the high-priest were enjoined to be of purple. The\r\nBabylonians devoted this colour to the dress of their idols, and most\r\nof the other nations of antiquity appear to have done the same thing.\r\nPliny informs us that it was used by Romulus and the succeeding kings\r\nof Rome, as well as by the consuls and first magistrates under the\r\nrepublic. The Roman emperors at last appropriated it entirely to their\r\nown use, and denounced the punishment of death against those who should\r\ndare to wear it, although covered with another colour. This absurd and\r\ntyrannical restriction confined the dyeing of the Tyrian purple to a\r\nfew individuals, and, in a short time, the knowledge of the process was\r\nentirely lost.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century, neither the creature that furnished the dye,\r\nnor the methods which the ancients employed to communicate to cloths\r\nthe rich and beautiful purple which it afforded, were at all known; and\r\non the revival of learning, it was even suspected by many, that the\r\naccounts which had come down to us respecting this celebrated colour\r\nwere entirely fabulous.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny, the Tyrians removed the finest colouring-matter\r\nout of the largest shells, in order to possess it in a more pure\r\nstate, and to extract it more effectually, but obtained the colour from\r\nthe smaller by grinding them in mills. He adds, that when the Purpuræ\r\nwere caught, the receptacle which contained the dyeing-liquor was taken\r\nout and laid in salt for three days; and that after a sufficiency of\r\nthe matter had been collected, it was boiled slowly in leaden vessels\r\nover a gentle fire, the workman scumming off from time to time the\r\nfleshy impurities. This process lasted ten days, after which the liquor\r\nwas tried by dipping wool into it, and if the colour produced by it was\r\ndefective, the boiling was renewed.\r\n\r\nOther colouring-matters were employed sometimes to economize, and at\r\nother times to vary the effect of the liquors of the Purpuræ. Among\r\nthese Pliny enumerates _Fucus marinus_, or Archil, and the _Anchusa\r\ntinctoria_, or Alkanet, both of which are still used as dyes. By these\r\nand other means, the purple colour was made to assume a variety of\r\nshades, some inclining more to the blue, and others to the crimson.\r\n\r\nIn modern times several attempts have been made to obtain this dye; but\r\nthe discovery of cochineal has rendered it a matter of little import.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1683, Mr. William Cole, of Bristol, being at Minehead,\r\nwas told of a person living at a seaport in Ireland, who had made\r\nconsiderable gain by marking with a delicate and durable crimson\r\ncolour, fine linen that was sent to him for that purpose, and that this\r\ncolour was made from some liquid substance taken from a shell-fish. Mr.\r\nCole, being a lover of natural history, and having his curiosity thus\r\nexcited, went in search of these shell-fish, and, after trying various\r\nkinds without success, he, at length, found considerable quantities\r\nof a species of buccinum on the sea-coasts of Somersetshire, and the\r\nopposite coasts of South Wales. After many ineffectual endeavours,\r\nhe discovered the colouring-matter, placed in a white vein, lying\r\ntransversely in a little furrow, or cleft, next to the head of the\r\nfish, “which,” says he, “must be digged out with the stiff point of a\r\nhorse-hair pencil, made short and tapering, by reason of the viscous\r\nclamminess of the white liquor in the vein, that so by its stiffness it\r\nmay drive in the matter into the fine linen or white silk intended to\r\nbe marked.” Letters or marks, made in this way, with the white liquor\r\nin question, “will presently appear of a pleasant green colour, and, if\r\nplaced in the sun, will change into the following colours,—that is, if\r\nin Winter, about noon, if in the Summer, an hour or two after sunrise,\r\nor so much before setting, (for in the heat of the day, in Summer,\r\nthe colours will come so fast that the succession of each will scarce\r\nbe distinguishable,) next to the first light green will appear a deep\r\ngreen, and in a few minutes this will change into a full sea-green,\r\nafter which, in a few minutes more, it will alter into a watchet blue,\r\nand from that, in a little time more, it will be of a purplish red,\r\nafter which, lying an hour or two, (supposing the sun still shining,)\r\nit will be of a very deep purple red, beyond which the sun can do no\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n“But the last and most beautiful colour, after washing in scalding\r\nwater and soap, will (the matter being again exposed to the sun or the\r\nwind to dry,) be a much different colour from all those mentioned,\r\nthat is, a fair bright crimson, or near to the prince’s colour,\r\nwhich afterwards, notwithstanding there is no styptic to bind the\r\ncolour, will continue the same, if well ordered, as I have found in\r\nhandkerchiefs that have been washed more than forty times, only it will\r\nbe somewhat alloyed from what it was after the first washing.”\r\n\r\nSome years after this, Réaumur discovered great numbers of a species\r\nof buccinum, on the coast of Poitou, and the stones, round which they\r\nhad collected, were covered with small oval masses, some of which were\r\nwhite, and others of a yellowish colour; and, having squeezed some of\r\nthem on the sleeves of his shirt, in about half an hour he found it\r\nstained of a fine purple colour, which he was unable to discharge by\r\nwashing. In repeating his experiment on his return home, he found it\r\nwas necessary that the cloth should be exposed to the direct rays of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of procuring and preserving a sufficient number of these\r\nshell-fish, must always render the use of this dye very limited; but\r\nDr. Bancroft is of opinion, that it might still be rendered beneficial\r\nin staining or printing fine muslins, for which purpose but little\r\ncolouring-matter is required. No substance, he remarks, will afford a\r\nsubstantive purple of equal beauty and durability, and capable of being\r\napplied to linen or cotton with so much simplicity and expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY _ALATA_.\r\n\r\nThis family is distinguished, by having a canal of variable length at\r\nthe base of its opening, and by the fact of the right margin of the\r\nshell changing its form during the growth of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPOTTED SCORPION SHELL, (_Pterocera scorpio_.)\r\n\r\nThis curious shell is found in the East Indian seas, and attains\r\na considerable size, as much as six inches. In an early age the\r\nprojecting claws of this shell are very small, so that its appearance\r\nis materially different from that which it assumes at a more advanced\r\nperiod of its growth. It is known as the Spotted Scorpion Shell, and\r\nis distinguished from other species of the same genus, by the knotted\r\nand granulated appearance of its surface; the opening of the shell\r\nis long and narrow, and of a dull violet red, sometimes brownish, on\r\nwhich numerous transverse wrinkles are seen, either of a pure white, or\r\nslightly tinged with yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pterocera scorpio._]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY _CANALIFERA_.\r\n\r\nThe shells belonging to this family agree with those of the last in\r\nhaving a canal at their base; but the lip to the right of the opening\r\ndoes not change its form through age.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VARIEGATED SEA-TRUMPET, (_Triton variegatum_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Triton variegatum_, or Variegated Sea-Trumpet, a large and\r\nbeautiful shell, sometimes as much as two feet in length, is found\r\nchiefly in the torrid zones, near the Asiatic coast. The attendants on\r\nthe sea-gods of pagan Rome are frequently represented with this shell\r\napplied to their mouth by way of a trumpet.\r\n\r\n    Already Triton, at his call, appears\r\n    Above the waves; a Tyrian robe he wears,\r\n    And in his hand a crooked trumpet bears.\r\n    The sovereign bids him peaceful sounds inspire,\r\n    And give the waves the signal to retire.\r\n    His writhen shell he takes, whose narrow vent\r\n    Grows by degrees into a large extent,\r\n    Then gives it breath; the blast, with doubling sound,\r\n    Runs the wide circuit of the world around.\r\n    The sun first heard it, in his early east,\r\n    And met the rattling echoes in the west;\r\n    The waters, listening to the trumpet’s roar,\r\n    Obey the summons, and forsake the shore.\r\n                                        DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dolium perdix. Triton variegatum. Pyrula\r\ncaniculata._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANICULATED PEAR-SHELL, (_Pyrula caniculata_.)\r\n\r\nThis shell is found in the Icy Sea, and on the coast of Canada, and\r\nattains the length of seven inches. The animal of the Pyrula is at\r\npresent unknown. There is a kind of keel or ridge along the edge of the\r\nwhorls, which is obliterated in very old specimens. There are as many\r\nas eight-and-twenty species of this shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Turbo marmoratus. Pleurotoma babylonia. Trochus\r\nimperialis._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BABYLONIAN SPLIT-MOUTH,\r\n\r\n(_Pleurotoma babylonia_.)\r\n\r\nThe Babylonian Split-Mouth is found in the East Indies and the Molucca\r\nIslands, and is about three inches and a quarter in length. It is said\r\nthat the animal of this shell, when in motion, has its foot separated\r\nas it were from its body by a long thick footstalk, which arises from\r\nthe centre of the mantle, which is at this time turned back over the\r\nshell. This separation of the foot has the effect of causing the\r\ncreature to tumble over frequently, from the great weight it has to\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE FEEDERS, (PHYTOPHAGI.)\r\n\r\nThose genera of the Trachelipods which live on vegetable substances\r\nhave no projecting siphon, but possess a mouth furnished with jaws;\r\nthey are in general land-shells, and consequently, the air which\r\nthey breathe is conveyed directly to their branchiæ. Some of their\r\ntribes however, live in fresh water, either in running streams or in\r\nstagnant pools: among these, some breathe water and others air. These\r\nlast are obliged frequently to come to the surface for the purpose of\r\nbreathing,—others again inhabit salt water, and are unable to exist\r\nout of that element.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARBLE TURBAN-SHELL, (_Turbo marmoratus_.)\r\n\r\nThere are as many as thirty or forty species of the Turban-shell.\r\nThe Marble Turban, _Turbo marmoratus_, is the largest, being as much\r\nas four inches across; it is found in the Indian Ocean. The colour\r\nof this shell is of a brownish green, of greater or less intensity.\r\nIt is ornamented by eight or ten narrow transverse belts, consisting\r\nof a series of white or brownish spots. This is one of those shells\r\nwhose substance, after the outer coat is removed, is of the nature of\r\nmother-of-pearl.\r\n\r\nThe _Turbo littoreus_ (the Shore Turban), is the well-known periwinkle,\r\nwith which our rocky coasts abound.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL TOP-SHELL, (_Trochus imperialis_.)\r\n\r\nThese shells have received their name from their resemblance in form\r\nto a boy’s top. They are all marine shells, and the apex of their\r\nspire is always very sharp-pointed. In some places they are called\r\n_flat-mouthed snails_. The greater number of these shells, (and the\r\nspecies are very numerous,) are of a beautiful pearly substance, and\r\nmany of them are also elegantly marked with longitudinal ribs; there\r\nare as many as seventy species,—the larger and more elegant are only\r\nfound in the seas of hot climates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Haliotis iris. Scalaria pretiosa. Neritina pulligera._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRECIOUS SCALARIA, (_Scalaria pretiosa_.)\r\n\r\nThis shell is noted for its rarity, and for the singular arrangement of\r\nits whorls, which do not touch each other, and appear as if they were\r\nonly connected by the ribs with which the shell is adorned. Like the\r\nturbans, the inhabitants of the Scalariæ are found on the sea-coast,\r\non rocks and large stones, between high and low water mark. The native\r\nplace of the Scalaria pretiosa seems to be uncertain; Lamarck, and\r\nseveral others, believe it comes from the East Indies, while others\r\nconsider it an inhabitant of the Mediterranean. So great was the rage\r\nsome years back, to possess a perfect specimen of this shell, that\r\nas much as twenty or thirty pounds, and even more, has been given\r\nfor a well-preserved specimen. Travellers relate that the Scalariæ\r\nare much sought after and highly prized by the women on the coast\r\nof Amboyna, and at Batavia, where they are used as earrings, and in\r\nforming necklaces. They are, although rarely, as much as four inches\r\nin length. It is said, that there was a specimen in the cabinet of the\r\nempress Catherine of Russia, still larger; but the most usual size is\r\nfrom one to two inches in length. A fine specimen of this shell ought\r\nto be semi-transparent like porcelain, of a light brown, tinged with\r\nrose-colour, and the ribs of a beautiful opaque white.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRIS EAR-SHELL, (_Haliotis Iris_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Haliotides_, or sea-ears, are very splendid shells; the species\r\nare numerous, and some of them are extremely common. The place in the\r\nsystem which this shell ought to occupy, appears to have caused many\r\ndoubts in the minds of modern naturalists, and consequently, we find it\r\ncontinually shifted from one part to another in the different works of\r\nLamarck and Cuvier. When moving from place to place in search of food,\r\nthe animal and its shell present a very pleasing sight, the slender\r\ntentacula which appear through the different holes which ornament\r\nthe margin of the shell, gracefully waving in all directions; these\r\ntentacula are supposed to be breathing-tubes. In the young shell, the\r\nnumber of perforations is not so great as in an adult, one being formed\r\nat each progressive stage of the creature’s growth. Sometimes the holes\r\nwhich were first formed become, by age, filled up. The proportions of\r\nthe shell, also, vary materially, so as to render the separation of\r\nspecies very difficult and uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUSTY NERITINA, (_Neritina pulligera_.)\r\n\r\nThis shell is found in the rivers of India, and is about an inch and\r\na quarter in length. All the species of this genus are supposed to\r\ninhabit fresh water only. There is a curious fact attached to the\r\nhistory of the Neritina, and of a neighbouring genus, Nerita,—namely,\r\nthat when found in a fossil state, their colours are always in good\r\npreservation. The species, which are tolerably numerous, are in general\r\nnatives of hot climates.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VIVIPAROUS PALUDINA, (_Paludina vivipara_.)\r\n\r\nThe animal of the genus Paludina is an inhabitant of fresh waters: it\r\ntakes its specific name from the fact of the young being hatched within\r\nthe parent shell, and deposited in the waters perfectly formed. In\r\nnearly the whole of this class the eggs are laid either in water or in\r\nthe earth, and afterwards hatched after a longer or shorter period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Planorbis corneus. Paludina vivipara. Lymnæa\r\nstagnalis._]\r\n\r\nThese shells are found generally in running streams of fresh water;\r\nsometimes, however, they are met with in brackish water, at the\r\nmouths of rivers. The operculum of the Paludina is of a strong horny\r\nsubstance. The young, immediately they are hatched, attach themselves\r\nto the outside of the shell of the mother, where they remain until they\r\nare sufficiently strong to trust themselves in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYMNÆA STAGNALIS.\r\n\r\nThe _Lymnæa stagnalis_ is found in stagnant waters, particularly narrow\r\nditches, in great abundance. As it breathes air, it is necessary for\r\nits existence that it should frequently resort to the surface of the\r\nwater; and consequently, we find these shells floating about in great\r\nnumbers, with the body partly out of the shell. The least appearance\r\nof danger causes a Lymnæa to withdraw the whole of its body into\r\nits shelly covering; and as this increases its specific gravity, it\r\ninstantly sinks to the bottom, where it remains in safety. In order\r\nto reach the surface again, it is obliged to crawl to the side of the\r\nditch, and when it has reached the level of the water, it again trusts\r\nits little bark to the mercy of the winds and stream, for it has very\r\nlittle power to direct its own course.\r\n\r\nDuring the Winter, these creatures remain at the bottom, buried in the\r\nmud, and in a state of torpor. Although apparently useless to mankind,\r\nthey form part of the subsistence of many water-birds, and of fishes,\r\nwhich are extremely fond of them. The species of this shell are not\r\neasily decided, since they bear so great a resemblance to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORN-SHAPED PLANORBIS,\r\n\r\n(_Planorbis corneus_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Planorbis_, although differing in form from the Lymnæa, possesses\r\nthe same habits, and is found in the same localities. The jelly-like\r\nsubstance which is frequently found, in the Spring of the year,\r\nattached to water-cresses and other aquatic plants, and which is\r\nconsidered by many to be of a poisonous nature, and looked on as the\r\nspawn of toads, is merely the covering of the ova of this and other\r\ninhabitants of fresh-water shells; and, although very disagreeable,\r\ncertainly not poisonous.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED-MOUTHED BULIMUS, (_Bulimus hæmastomus_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Bulimus hæmastomus_ is a most beautiful shell; it is a native of\r\nGuiana, and is frequently as much as four inches in length. The most\r\nsingular part of its natural history is the large size of the egg of\r\nthe animal in comparison with its magnitude; it is said to equal that\r\nof a moderate-sized pigeon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bulimus hæmastomus. Pupa mummia._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUMMY PUPPET SHELL, (_Pupa mummia_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Pupa mummia_ is found in the Antilles; it takes its name from the\r\nsingularity of its form, which very much resembles that of a mummy.\r\n\r\nThe Pupa is essentially a land-shell, living among grass, on stones,\r\nand sometimes in places much exposed to the heat of the sun. The\r\ngreater number of the species, which are very numerous, are natives of\r\ntropical countries; there are, however, several found in Germany, and\r\nother parts of the Continent, but they are extremely small.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOOD SNAIL, (_Helix nemoralis_.)\r\n\r\nThe Snail (_Helix_) is an animal well-known in every part of the globe,\r\nand its species are still extremely numerous, although many shells\r\nwhich belonged to this tribe, under the Linnæan arrangement, have been\r\nplaced in other divisions. The head of the Snail is furnished with\r\ntwo pair of tentacula, or feelers; these, unlike similar appendices\r\nin other Mollusca, are retractile; that is, they can be withdrawn\r\ninto the body at the will of the animal. The use of these tentacula\r\nis uncertain. At the top of each of the longest pair we find a black\r\nspot; these spots have been supposed to be the eyes of the animal,\r\nand a celebrated anatomist says, that he has discovered in them all\r\nthe component parts of perfect eyes. However this may be, the animal\r\nappears to use them rather as organs of touch than of sight. Some\r\nwriters suspect that the sense of smell resides in one or both pairs of\r\nthese appendages.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which Snails are applied are not many; some of the larger\r\nkinds, however, are, in some countries, employed as food. The Romans,\r\naccording to Pliny, consumed large quantities, and considered them in\r\nthe light of delicacies, and considerable pains were taken in fattening\r\nthem for the table. Those from Sicily and the Balearic Islands were in\r\ngreat request, and attained a very large size. Some authors say they\r\nare still used as food in several parts of the Continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Helix nemoralis._]\r\n\r\nIn Paris, London, and many large towns, great numbers of Snails are\r\nfrequently brought to market; but these are not employed as food, but\r\nused medicinally by persons suffering under consumption, and other\r\ndiseases of the chest.\r\n\r\nIt was already known that polypi, and some species of worms, could have\r\nportions of their body cut off, and that the parts removed would be\r\nafterwards reproduced; and as these animals had no well distinguished\r\nextremities, such as heads or limbs, the fact, although singular, was\r\nnot disputed; but, when it was asserted by Spallanzani, that Snails,\r\nwhich have a very well defined series of parts, could, after the head\r\nwas removed, reproduce that portion of the body, the scientific world\r\nbecame naturally incredulous, and numerous experiments were made,\r\nand thousands of Snails slaughtered, to ascertain the fact. No one,\r\nhowever, for a length of time, could succeed;—it was then suspected\r\nthat Spallanzani had only removed a portion of the head. At length,\r\nit would appear, from the experiments of M. G. Tarenne (an account of\r\nwhich appeared in 1808), that these creatures could actually reproduce\r\na complete head. He gives as a reason of the want of success of others,\r\nthe little precaution taken to provide the mutilated Snails with proper\r\nnourishment. The new head, according to him, is perfect in about two\r\nyears after the old head has been removed.\r\n\r\nM. Tarenne says, that after having cut off the heads of two hundred\r\nSnails, he threw them all into a moist spot at the end of his garden,\r\nthat they might obtain the nourishment most fitted for them (how they\r\ncould eat without their heads he does not say); at the end of the\r\nSummer he examined all the mutilated Snails he could find, and he\r\ndiscovered that they all had a new head, about the size of a grain\r\nof coffee; they had four small tentacula, a mouth, and lips; at the\r\nend of the following Summer, the heads were perfectly reproduced, and\r\nlike the original head, with the exception of the skin, which was more\r\ndelicate. “After this experiment,” says a French author, “we cannot\r\ndoubt that the entire head of a Snail can be regenerated after it has\r\nbeen removed; however, I cannot disguise the fact, that I have a kind\r\nof repugnance at admitting the matter to be entirely beyond dispute.”\r\n\r\nIf the advantages bestowed on man by Snails are not numerous, the\r\ndisadvantages, or rather inconveniences, produced by them are very\r\nconsiderable; they are particularly destructive in orchards and\r\nkitchen-gardens. On this account, many methods have been recommended\r\nfor the purpose of destroying them. Although many of these are\r\ntolerably successful, there is no plan more likely to keep the breed\r\nof Snails under, particularly in enclosed gardens, than that of early\r\nrising and gathering them, if we may so express ourselves, while the\r\ndew is yet on the grass: if the shells are then broken, they become\r\nexcellent food for poultry. Ducks may sometimes be allowed to wander\r\nin the garden, as they do but little damage to the vegetation, and are\r\ngreat destroyers both of Snails and slugs.\r\n\r\nA singular account of the instinct of Snails is, perhaps, worth\r\nrecording.\r\n\r\nThe garden of a small house, by the side of one of the roads leading\r\ninto London, was much infested by a colony of Snails; the proprietor of\r\nthis house, desirous of getting rid of the pest, and yet unwilling to\r\nkill the Snails, collected them, and threw them unharmed into the road;\r\nbut still, he every morning discovered as many Snails among his pinks\r\nand tulips as he had removed the previous day; this somewhat puzzled\r\nhim, until once, on leaving his house early, he perceived the Snails\r\nwhich he had but an hour before thrown into the dusty road, moving, not\r\nin a body, but each from the spot on which it was thrown, in a direct\r\nline from that spot to the low wall which encompassed the garden, as\r\nif they comprehended the mathematical fact that, “a straight line is\r\nthe nearest way from one given point to another.” How were these Snails\r\naware that by moving in that direction, they should arrive at a green\r\nspot? From the road nothing could be visible to them but dust,—from\r\nthe path, nothing but the wall in front,—but still, although the\r\nwhole of their path was covered with dust, they proceeded steadily on,\r\nuntil they had surmounted the wall, and reached their old quarters. By\r\nwhat other faculty were they guided but that instinct which supplies\r\nthe place of the higher powers of the mind, and which is imparted with\r\nso liberal a hand to the meanest creature in nature?\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER GASTEROPODA._\r\n\r\nThe Gasteropods are so called from two Greek words, meaning belly and\r\nfoot, because the foot, or organ of motion of the animals of which\r\nthis order consists, is attached to the whole of the under part of the\r\ncreature, or rather, the belly or under part is itself the foot, and is\r\nfor that purpose broad and flat. The Gasteropods are also distinguished\r\nfrom the last order by having a straight body, in no case spiral,\r\nand never possessing a shell capable of enclosing the whole body; in\r\nsome cases, the body is completely naked, and without the protecting\r\ncovering of any shell whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED SLUG, (_Limax rufus_.)\r\n\r\nThe Common Slug is a good example of an individual of this order,\r\nentirely wanting a shell. The Slugs, like the snails, are found in all\r\ncountries; they are equally destructive to vegetation, but as yet have\r\nnever been used by man for any useful purpose, if we except the fact\r\nof their sometimes becoming the food of ducks and poultry. The _Limax\r\nrufus_, Red, or more properly brown, Slug, for the colour is of a\r\nreddish-brown, varying in intensity to such an extent as to render it\r\nimpossible to find two specimens of the same colour, is more commonly\r\nfound in fields than in gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Limax rufus._]\r\n\r\nThere are many species of the Slug; but they are not well defined, on\r\naccount of the variable nature of their colour; the black and the brown\r\nkinds are, however, pretty well known: the black, in particular, is\r\nvery destructive in kitchen-gardens, and commits great havoc in fields\r\nof cabbages and turnips.\r\n\r\nIn one or two species, the buckler, or smooth space near the head,\r\ncontains a very small oval shell.\r\n\r\nThere is a very singular species of Slug found in Teneriffe, under\r\nstones in moist places, it is not more than an inch and a quarter in\r\nlength; it is called _Limax noctiluca_, the night-shining Slug. The\r\nbuckler, in this species, is very narrow, and covered with pores, which\r\nexude a kind of viscous substance, which has the property of shining\r\nwith a phosphorescent light, like that of the glow-worm.\r\n\r\nWe may have some idea of the rapid increase of Slugs, by a fact\r\nmentioned by Dr. Leech, that two individuals of a small species have\r\nlaid as many as seven hundred and sixty-six eggs; and these eggs were\r\ndried in an oven without destroying their vital powers, since, on being\r\nplaced in a damp situation, they were afterwards hatched.\r\n\r\nThe following plan of taking and destroying Slugs was resorted to by\r\na gentleman near Ipswich. Having heard that turnips were employed to\r\nentice Slugs from wheat, he caused a sufficient quantity to dress eight\r\nacres to be got together, and then, the tops being divided and the\r\napples sliced, he directed the pieces to be laid separately, dressing\r\ntwo rows with them, and omitting two, alternately, till the whole field\r\nof eight acres was gone over. On the following morning, he employed two\r\nwomen to examine the tops and slices, and free them from the Slugs,\r\nwhich they threw into a measure: and when cleared, they were laid\r\non those rows that had been omitted the day before. It was observed\r\ninvariably, that in the rows dressed with the turnips, no Slugs were\r\nto be found upon the wheat, or crawling upon the land, though they\r\nabounded upon the turnips; while, on the undressed rows, they were to\r\nbe seen in great numbers, both 011 the wheat and on the ground. The\r\nquantity of Slugs thus collected was nearly a bushel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOODLIKE BULLA, (_Bulla lignaria_.)\r\n\r\nThe animal of the _Bulla_ is singular, from possessing-within its\r\nstomach three pieces of a substance resembling bone; these give that\r\norgan the power of crushing or grinding the food, forming a kind\r\nof gizzard. The bony portion of this stomach is represented in the\r\nforeground in the engraving. The Bulla lignaria is about two inches\r\nand a half in length, and is found in the European seas; Lamarck\r\nmentions as many as eleven species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bulla lignaria._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAIL-SHAPED CREPIDULA,\r\n\r\n(_Crepidula unguiformis_.)\r\n\r\nThe genus _Crepidula_ takes its name from its hearing some resemblance\r\nto a little shoe; none of the species are found in Europe. Of these\r\nthere are about six, but they are all confined to the seas of warm\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN UMBRELLA,\r\n\r\n(_Umbrella Mediterranea_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Umbrella Mediterranea_, as its name implies, is found in the\r\nMediterranean, and in the Gulf of Tarento. The shell of the Umbrella is\r\nsingular, from the lower part of its circumference being surrounded by\r\na border of a substance much softer than the shell itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOUDED FISSURELLA, (_Fissurella nimbosa_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Fissurella nimbosa_ is found in various and distant parts of the\r\nworld,—in the north of Europe, the western coast of Africa, &c. It is\r\nrather a handsome shell, which seldom exceeds an inch and a half in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Umbrella      Crepidula    Fissurella\r\n   Mediterranea. unguiformis. nimbosa._\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Fissurella very much resembles our limpet, but differs from it by\r\nhaving a small, rather oval-formed hole in the summit of the shell,\r\naffording a passage to a small canal through which the water is\r\ndischarged, after having passed over the branchiæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUNGARIAN BONNET SHELL,\r\n\r\n(_Pileopsis Ungarica_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Pileopsis Ungarica_ is extremely elegant both in its form and\r\nmarkings; it is of a delicate white, slightly tinged, internally, with\r\nrose-colour. The animal attaches itself to rocks, between high and low\r\nwater mark, and very rarely, if ever, changes its situation, unless\r\nremoved by accident, when it is driven about by the waves, until the\r\ncreature, being thrown on a rock in a favourable situation, attaches\r\nitself firmly to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pileopsis Ungarica._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCALY CHITON, (_Chiton squamosus_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Chitons_ differ so much from all other shell-bearing animals in\r\nthe arrangement of their shelly covering, that they have been placed\r\nby different naturalists in various parts of their system. Lamarck,\r\nin referring to these animals, has placed them near the end of the\r\nMollusca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chiton squamosus._]\r\n\r\n“Although,” says Lamarck, “when we examine this creature, and observe\r\nthe several pieces of which its shell is composed, attached to the\r\nmarginal membrane of the mantle which surrounds them, it appears not\r\na univalve, but a multivalve shell; yet these shelly pieces ought not\r\nto be regarded in any other light than as a lengthened shell of one\r\npiece, which Nature had originally broken transversely into several\r\ndistinct moveable pieces, to give greater freedom to the animal in its\r\nmovements.”\r\n\r\nThe Chitons, like the neighbouring genera, frequent the rocks between\r\nhigh and low water mark, but are much more active in their movements.\r\nPoli, a learned Neapolitan, in describing the anatomy of a Chiton,\r\nsays, that the interior of the mouth or throat of this animal is\r\ncovered with a multitude of teeth,—some simple, and others with three\r\npoints, and that these teeth are disposed in numerous longitudinal rows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS CONCHIFERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conchifera differ from the Molluscous animals that bear shells,\r\nin a very great degree; for, although the substance of the body is\r\nsoft, unlike the Mollusca it is inarticulate, always enclosed in a\r\nshell of two valves, without head or eyes,—a mouth, if it may be so\r\ncalled, concealed from view, and without any hard parts, and the whole\r\nbody enveloped in a large mantle, or hood, formed of two thin lobes,\r\ngenerally perfectly free, but at times united in front; these are the\r\nprincipal distinguishing characters of this class.\r\n\r\nIn earlier systems, when shells were classed without much reference\r\nto the animals that inhabited them, the only distinction made was the\r\nnumber of pieces of which the shell was formed, and they were arranged\r\nunder the heads of _univalves_, of one piece, _bivalves_, with two\r\npieces, and _multivalves_, with more than two pieces. This arrangement\r\nwas inconvenient, as, in some cases, it separated animals that\r\notherwise agreed with each other. With respect to the bivalve shells,\r\nhowever, this objection does not hold good, as they all contain animals\r\nbelonging to the class Conchifera.\r\n\r\nThe individuals of this class appear to be deprived of all the senses\r\nexcept that of feeling. Their powers of motion have been so well\r\ndescribed by Dr. Roget, in his _Bridgewater Treatise_, that we cannot\r\ndo better than extract a portion from that interesting work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Valves of the _Unio Batava_, with the Connecting\r\nLigament.]\r\n\r\nThe two valves of the shell of the Conchifera are united at the back by\r\na hinge-joint, often very artificially constructed, having teeth that\r\nlock into each other; and the mechanism of this articulation varies\r\nmuch in different species. The hinge is secured by a substance of great\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nDuring the life of the animal, the usual and natural state of its shell\r\nis, that of being kept open for a little distance, so as to allow of\r\nthe ingress and egress of the water necessary for its nourishment\r\nand respiration; but, as a security against danger, it was necessary\r\nto furnish the animal with the means of rapidly closing the shell,\r\nand retaining the valves in a closed state. These actions, being\r\nonly occasional, yet requiring considerable force, are effected by a\r\nmuscular power, for which purpose sometimes one, sometimes two, or even\r\na greater number of strong muscles are placed between the valves, their\r\nfibres passing directly across from the inner surface of the one to\r\nthat of the other, and firmly attached to both. They are named, from\r\ntheir office of bringing the valves towards each other, the _adductor\r\nmuscles_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of an Oyster, showing the situation of the\r\nHinge, L., the Adductor Muscle, A, and the transverse direction of its\r\nFibres, with respect to the Valves.]\r\n\r\nThe simple actions of opening and closing the valves, are capable of\r\nbeing converted into a means of retreating from danger, or of removing\r\nto a more commodious situation, in the case of those bivalves which are\r\nnot actually attached to rocks, or other fixed bodies.\r\n\r\nDiquemarc long ago observed, that even the Oyster has some power of\r\nlocomotion, by suddenly closing its shell, and thereby expelling the\r\ncontained water with a degree of force, which, by the reaction of the\r\nfluid in the opposite direction, gives a sensible impulse to the heavy\r\nmass. He notices the singular fact, that Oysters which are attached to\r\nrocks occasionally left dry by the retreat of the tide, always retain\r\nwithin their shells a quantity of water sufficient for respiration, and\r\nthat they keep the valves closed till the return of the tide; whereas,\r\nthose Oysters which are taken from greater depths, where the water\r\nnever leaves them, and are afterwards removed to situations where they\r\nare exposed to these vicissitudes, of which they have had no previous\r\nexperience, improvidently open their shells after the sea has left\r\nthem; and, by allowing the water to escape, soon perish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Cardium, or Cockle._]\r\n\r\nMany bivalve Mollusca are provided with an instrument shaped like a\r\nleg and foot, which they employ extensively for progressive motion. In\r\nthe _Cardium_, or cockle, this organ is composed of a mass of muscular\r\nfibres, interwoven together in a very complex manner, and which may\r\nbe compared to the muscular structure of the human tongue; the effect\r\nin both is the same, namely, the conferring a power of motion in\r\nall possible ways; thus it may be readily protruded, retracted, or\r\ninflected at every point.\r\n\r\nThe _Solen_, or razor-shell fish, has a foot of a cylindrical shape,\r\ntapering at the end, and much more resembling in its form a tongue\r\nthan a foot. In some bivalves, the dilatation of the foot is effected\r\nby a curious hydraulic mechanism; the interior of the organ is formed\r\nof a spongy texture, capable of receiving a considerable quantity of\r\nwater, which the animal has the power of injecting into it, and of thus\r\nincreasing its dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe foot of the _Mytilus edulis_, or common mussel, can be advanced\r\nto the distance of two inches from the shell, and applied to any\r\nfixed body within that range. By attaching the point to such body,\r\nand retracting the foot, this animal drags its shell towards it, and\r\nby repeating the operation successively on other points of the fixed\r\nobject, continues slowly to advance.\r\n\r\nThis instrument is of great use to such shell-fish as conceal\r\nthemselves in the mud or sand, which its structure is then peculiarly\r\nadapted for scooping out. The cockle continually employs its foot for\r\nthis purpose: first, elongating it, directing its point downwards, and\r\ninsinuating it deep into the sand, and next, turning up the end, and\r\nforming it into a hook, by which, from the resistance of the sand, it\r\nis fixed in its position, and then the muscles, which usually retract\r\nit, are thrown into action, and the whole shell is alternately raised\r\nand depressed, moving on the foot as on a fulcrum. The effect of\r\nthese exertions is to drag the shell downwards. When the animal is\r\nmoderately active, these movements are repeated two or three times in a\r\nminute. The apparent progress is at first but small, the shell, which\r\nwas raised on its edge at the middle of the stroke, falling back on\r\nits side at the end of it; but when the shell is buried so far as to\r\nbe supported on its edge, it advances more rapidly, sinking visibly\r\nat every stroke, till nothing but the extremity of the tube can be\r\nperceived above the sand.\r\n\r\nBy a process exactly the inverse of this, that is, by doubling up the\r\nfoot, and pushing with it downwards against the sand below, the shell\r\nmay be again made to rise by the same kind of efforts which before\r\nprotruded the foot. By this process of burrowing, the animal is enabled\r\nquickly to retreat when danger presses, and when this is past, it can,\r\nwith equal facility, emerge from its hiding-place.\r\n\r\nThe _Cardium_ can also advance at the bottom of the sea, along the\r\nsurface of the soft earth, pressing backwards with its foot, as a\r\nboatman impels his boat onwards by pushing with his pole against\r\nthe ground in a contrary direction. It is, likewise, by a similar\r\nexpedient, that the Solen forces its way through the sand, expanding\r\nthe end of its foot into the form of a club.\r\n\r\nThe _Tellina_ is remarkable for the quickness and agility with which it\r\ncan spring to considerable distances, by first folding the foot into a\r\nsmall compass, and then suddenly extending it, while the shell is, at\r\nthe same time, closed with a loud snap.\r\n\r\nThe _Pinna_, or marine mussel, when inhabiting the shores of\r\ntempestuous seas, is furnished, in addition, with a singular apparatus\r\nfor withstanding the fury of the surge, and securing itself from\r\ndangerous collisions, which might easily destroy the brittle texture of\r\nits shell. The object of this apparatus is, to prepare a great number\r\nof threads, which are fastened at various points to the adjacent rocks,\r\nand then tightly drawn by the animal, just as a ship is moored in a\r\nconvenient station, to avoid the buffeting of the storm. The foot of\r\nthis bivalve is cylindrical, and has, connected with its base, a round\r\ntendon, of nearly the same length as itself, the office of which is to\r\nretain all the threads in firm adhesion with it, and concentrate their\r\npower on one point. The threads themselves are composed of a glutinous\r\nmatter, prepared by a particular organ. They are not spun by being\r\ndrawn out of the body, like the threads of the silkworm, or of the\r\nspider, but they are cast in a mould, where they harden, and acquire a\r\ncertain consistence before they are employed. This mould is curiously\r\nconstructed; there is a deep groove which passes along the foot, from\r\nthe root of the tendon to its other extremity, and the sides of this\r\ngroove are formed so as to fold and close over it, thereby converting\r\nit into a canal. The glutinous secretion, which is poured into this\r\ncanal, dries into a solid thread; and, when it has acquired sufficient\r\ntenacity, the foot is protruded, and the thread it contains is applied\r\nto the object to which it is to be fixed, its extremity being carefully\r\nattached to the solid surface of that object. The canal of the foot is\r\nthen opened along its whole length, and the thread, which adheres by\r\nits other extremity to the large tendon at the base of the foot, is\r\ndisengaged from the canal. Lastly, the foot is retracted, and the same\r\noperation is repeated.\r\n\r\nThread after thread is thus formed, and applied in different directions\r\naround the shell. Sometimes the attempt fails, in consequence of\r\nsome imperfection in the thread; but the animal, as if aware of the\r\nimportance of ascertaining the strength of each thread, on which its\r\nsafety depends, tries every one of them as soon as it has been fixed,\r\nby swinging itself round, so as to put it fully on the stretch; an\r\naction which probably also assists in elongating the thread. When once\r\nthe threads have been fixed, the animal does not appear to have the\r\npower of catting or breaking them off. The liquid matter, out of which\r\nthey are formed, is so exceedingly glutinous as to attach itself firmly\r\nto the smoothest bodies. It is but slowly produced, for it appears that\r\nno Pinna is capable of forming more than four, or at most five threads,\r\nin the course of a day and night. The threads which are formed in\r\nhaste, when the animal is disturbed in its operations, are more slender\r\nthan those which are constructed at its leisure. In Sicily, and other\r\nparts of the Mediterranean, these threads have been manufactured into\r\ngloves, and other articles, which resemble silk.\r\n\r\nThe number of muscles by which the shells are moved have caused this\r\nClass to be divided into two orders: the Bimusculosa, in which there\r\nare two pair of muscles to perform this office; and the Unimusculosa,\r\nwith only one pair.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER UNIMUSCULOSA._\r\n\r\nThe Conchiferous animals which possess but one pair of muscles, are\r\nmuch more limited in number than those which possess two or more; but\r\nthey contain in their ranks several well-known and useful species, as,\r\nfor instance, the oyster, the mussel, and the animal which produces the\r\noriental pearl.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE-FOOT BOWL SHELL,\r\n\r\n(_Anomia ephippium_.)\r\n\r\nThe shells of the Anomiæ are exceedingly irregular in their form;\r\nlike the oysters, they remain during the whole of their existence\r\nattached to one spot, either on a rock, or on the shell of some larger\r\ninhabitant of the deep. These shells are more frequently found in the\r\nsame places as the oyster, and very commonly attached to the shell of\r\nthe latter; as an article of food, the Anomia is of little or no value.\r\nIts organization and manner of living are much the same as those of\r\nthe oyster. The most singular part of its construction consists in\r\nthe use made of one of the muscles with which it is furnished, which,\r\ninstead of being attached to the shell, is fixed to a solid piece of\r\nshelly substance, in the form of a cone with the top cut off; this\r\n_operculum_, or lid, closes a singular opening in one of the valves of\r\nthe shell itself. The animal adheres to the rock, or other substance,\r\nby means of this lid, and is detached with great difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anomia ephippium._ [_Anomia_, a little bowl;\r\n_ephippium_, a horse’s foot.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OYSTER, (_Ostrea edulis_.)\r\n\r\nOysters, like all other creatures that have been destined to become\r\nfood for man, are found in great abundance in most parts of the globe;\r\nthey are inhabitants of salt waters only, and are always found in rocky\r\nground, in no great depth from the surface.\r\n\r\nOysters generally cast their spat, or spawn, in the month of May;\r\nwhen first shed it has the appearance of a drop of candle-grease,\r\nwhich the dredgers commonly call _cultch_. The growth of an Oyster is\r\ntolerably rapid; three days after the spawn is deposited, the shell of\r\nthe young Oyster may be seen, nearly a quarter of an inch in width; in\r\nthree months it is larger than a shilling, in six months bigger than a\r\nhalf-crown, and in a year it exceeds a crown piece in size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ostrea edulis._]\r\n\r\nOysters have been employed as food almost from time immemorial. The\r\nGreeks, but more especially the Romans, held them in high repute,\r\nattaching, at the same time, great importance to the places in which\r\nthey were found. Those from the Dardanelles, from Venice, and from\r\nEngland, were considered the best, and the prices paid for them by the\r\nluxurious inhabitants of Rome were enormous. They were transported\r\nin large vessels, and deposited in the Lucrine Lake, where they were\r\nfattened for the table. The Romans, it seems, gave a preference to\r\nthose which had the border of their mantle of a dark-brown colour,\r\nnearly black.\r\n\r\nThe English Oyster-fishery is principally carried on at the following\r\nplaces:—Wivenhoe, near Colchester, in Essex, (the beds here are\r\ngenerally supplied from Portsmouth;) at Feversham and Milton, in\r\nKent, the Swales of the Medway, and at Tenby, on the coast of Wales.\r\nIn Scotland, they are chiefly taken at the island of Inchkeith, and\r\nat Preston-pans, both in the Firth of Forth. The fishing for Oysters\r\nis permitted by law, from the 1st of September to the last of April\r\ninclusive. During the remaining months they are considered unwholesome;\r\nit is a common saying that Oysters are in season during all the months\r\nthat have the letter _r_ in them.\r\n\r\nIn France, the chief fishing-station for Oysters is in the Bay of\r\nCançal, between the town of that name and Mount St. Michael, or St.\r\nMalo. The fishery is effected by means of an iron net or dredge; this\r\nis drawn over the Oyster-bed by hand-labour, or by having the rope\r\nwhich is fixed to it attached to the stem of the fishing-boat, which is\r\nthen allowed to run before the wind; frequently, in the course of a few\r\nminutes, as many as two or three hundred are taken. The Oysters taken\r\nare sent from the ports of Granville and Cançal, to different places,\r\nwhere artificial banks or preserves are established. These banks\r\nare not only of use in the preservation of the Oysters, but assist\r\nmaterially in their improvement. In fact, the Oyster, when first taken\r\nout of the sea, has frequently a strong muddy taste, and appears in\r\nwhat we should call bad condition.\r\n\r\nSome of these preserves are a species of tank dug in the sand, or\r\nsometimes even in stone, near the sea-shore, and communicating by a\r\nnarrow tunnel with the sea-water; the bottom and sides of these tanks\r\nare usually strewed with large stones. In France great care is bestowed\r\non the management of these preserves; the Oysters are placed by hand\r\non the stones, with the largest shell downwards, and at times the\r\nwater is let off, and they are freed from all mud and dirt that may\r\nhave collected, by having large quantities of water poured over them.\r\nA fashion existed formerly in France of preferring those Oysters which\r\nhad a tinge of green, and great pains were taken to cause this change\r\nof colour to take place, by placing the animals where they could obtain\r\na peculiar kind of green food.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT COMB SHELL, (_Pecten maximus_.)\r\n\r\nThis shell, although it has the name of the Great Pecten, is not the\r\nlargest of the numerous tribe to which it belongs; it is found in all\r\nthe European seas. The regular nature of the fluting with which it is\r\ncovered, and the elegance of its markings, have brought it much into\r\nuse among ladies, who employ it in making pin-cushions and other\r\narticles of fancy-work; there are about sixty recent, and thirty fossil\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pecten maximus. Malleus albus._]\r\n\r\nThe power of locomotion appears to be very considerable in some species\r\nof the Pectens; it is said the animal can raise itself up in the water,\r\nand even reach the surface, by moving the two valves of its shell; but\r\nthis is a fact not quite established, as but little is known of its\r\nhabits. It is sometimes used as an article of food; but to render it\r\ntolerably palatable it requires cooking.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, the shells of the larger species are used by the\r\npoorer classes instead of plates. In Paris, the _restaurateurs_ employ\r\nthem for the same purpose when serving up a certain preparation of\r\nmushrooms; in England, they are employed in cooking scalloped oysters,\r\nand the shell is consequently known as the Scallop Shell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEARL OYSTER, (_Meleagrina margaritifera_.)\r\n\r\nThe animal of this shell, although popularly called an oyster, is very\r\ndifferent in structure, bearing greater resemblance, in some parts of\r\nits formation, to the mussel, particularly in possessing a _byssus_, or\r\nbeard; it is the shell in which the famous oriental pearls are found.\r\nThere are but two known species of the Meleagrina, which are chiefly\r\nfound in the Persian Gulf, and at Ceylon, or in some of the seas of\r\nAustralasia.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the formation of pearl in the shells of this and other\r\ninhabitants of the water, has been the occasion of considerable\r\ndispute, but it is now pretty well ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe inner portion of the shell of the Meleagrina is lined with a\r\npearly substance, which is called mother-of-pearl; this is formed by\r\nan animal deposit, and is in thin layers. If, by any accident, the\r\ninner surface of the shell is injured, so as to cause a fracture of the\r\nmother-of-pearl, the deposit, in that place, becomes for the future\r\nirregular, and a bump is gradually formed. Accidental circumstances\r\ncause this bump to assume various shapes; sometimes it is oval,\r\nsometimes globular, and at others pear-shaped. This kind of pearl is\r\nalways originally found attached to the shell by means of a small neck,\r\nor footstalk, and the spot at which this neck was placed can always be\r\ntraced on the pearl itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Meleagrina margaritifera._]\r\n\r\nBut pearls are at times found loose in the shell;—in this case, the\r\npearly matter is deposited on some extraneous substance, such, for\r\ninstance, as a grain of sand, and by dissolving the pearl in an acid,\r\nthis nucleus can be traced.\r\n\r\nSome of these round pearls are supposed to be formed on a centre,\r\nconsisting of the remains of a diseased _ovum_, or egg, of the animal.\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy knows the story of Cleopatra having dissolved a\r\nvaluable pearl in vinegar, and afterwards drunk it off, to show her\r\nridiculous disregard of expense. But the account may reasonably be\r\ndoubted; for had the acid been strong enough to dissolve the pearl, it\r\nwould have been impossible to drink it, and if it was weak enough to\r\ndrink, it would not have dissolved the pearl, at least not until the\r\nlapse of a very considerable time.\r\n\r\nAt the island of Ceylon the fishery for pearls is a matter of great\r\nmoment. The following is an account of the mode in which it is\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\nThe country round Aripo, on the north-western coast of the island of\r\nCeylon, is flat, sandy, and barren, presenting nothing to the eye\r\nbut low brushwood, chiefly of thorns and prickly pears (which are\r\nthe plants that nourish the cochineal insect[2]), and here and there\r\nsome straggling villages with a few cocoa-nut trees. But Condatchy,\r\nthree miles distant, where, in general, nothing is to be seen but a\r\nfew miserable huts, and a sandy desert, becomes, during the period of\r\nthe pearl-fishery, a populous town, several streets of which extend\r\nupwards of a mile in length (though, as the houses are only intended\r\nas a shelter from the sun and rain, they are very rudely constructed),\r\nand the scene, altogether, resembles a crowded fair on the grandest\r\nscale. The people most active in erecting huts and speculating in the\r\nvarious branches of merchandise, are Mohammedans, Cingalese (natives\r\nof Ceylon), and Hindoos from the opposite coast of the continent of\r\nIndia. Apparently, however, from their natural timidity, none of the\r\nCingalese are divers, and scarcely any of them engage in the other\r\nactive parts of the fishery; they merely resort hither for the purpose\r\nof supplying the markets.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of October, in the year preceding a pearl-fishery,\r\nwhen a short interval of fine weather prevails, an examination of\r\nthe banks takes place. A certain number of boats, under an English\r\nsuperintendent, repair in a body to each bank, and having, by frequent\r\ndiving, ascertained its situation, they take from one to two thousand\r\noysters as a specimen. The shells are opened, and if the pearls\r\ncollected from a thousand oysters be worth three pounds sterling, a\r\ngood fishery may be expected. The “banks,” or beds of oysters, are\r\nscattered over a space in the Gulf of Manaar, extending thirty miles\r\nfrom north to south, and twenty-four from east to west. There are\r\nfourteen beds (not all, however, productive), of which the largest is\r\nten miles long, and two broad. The depth of water is from three to\r\nfifteen fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe pearl oysters in these banks are all of one species, and of the\r\nsame form: in shape not very unlike our common English oyster, but\r\nconsiderably larger, being from eight to ten inches in circumference.\r\nThe body of the animal is white, fleshy, and glutinous: the inside\r\nof the shell (the real “mother-of-pearl,”) is even brighter and more\r\nbeautiful than the pearl itself: the outside smooth and dark-coloured.\r\nThe pearls are most commonly contained in the thickest and most fleshy\r\npart of the oyster. A single oyster will frequently contain several\r\npearls, and one is on record, as having produced one hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nSometimes the English government of Ceylon fishes the banks entirely\r\nat its own risk; sometimes, the boats are let to many speculators:\r\nbut, most frequently, the light of fishing is sold to one individual,\r\nwho sub-lets boats to others. The fishery for the season of the year\r\n1804 was let by government to an individual for no less a sum than\r\n120,000_l._\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of March, the fishery commenced, and upwards of two\r\nhundred and fifty boats were employed in the fishery alone. These,\r\nwith their crews, and divers, and completely equipped with everything\r\nnecessary to conduct the business of the fishing, come from different\r\nparts of the coast of Coromandel. After going through various ablutions\r\nand incantations, and other superstitious ceremonies, the occupants of\r\nthese boats embark at midnight, guided by pilots, and as soon as they\r\nreach the banks, they cast anchor, and wait the dawn of day.\r\n\r\nAt about seven in the morning, when the rays of the sun begin to\r\nemit some degree of warmth, the diving commences. A kind of open\r\nscaffolding, formed of oars and other pieces of wood, is projected from\r\neach side of the boat, and from it the diving-tackle is suspended,\r\nwith three stones on one side, and two on the other. The diving-stone\r\nhangs from an oar by a light rope and slip-knot, and descends about\r\nfive feet into the water. It is a stone of fifty-six pounds’ weight, of\r\na sugar-loaf shape. The rope passes through a hole in the top of the\r\nstone, above which a strong loop is formed, resembling a stirrup-iron,\r\nto receive the foot of the diver. The diver wears no clothes, except a\r\nslip of calico round his loins,—swimming in the water, he takes hold\r\nof the rope, and puts one foot into the loop or stirrup, on the top of\r\nthe stone.\r\n\r\nHe remains in this upright position for a little while, supporting\r\nhimself by the motion of one arm. Then a basket, formed of a wooden\r\nhoop and net-work, suspended by a rope, is thrown into the water to\r\nhim, and in it he places his other foot. Both the ropes of the stone\r\nand the basket he holds for a little while in one hand. When he feels\r\nhimself properly prepared and ready to go down, he grasps his nostrils\r\nwith one hand, to prevent the water from rushing in; with the other\r\ngives a sudden pull to the running-knot suspending the stone, and\r\ninstantly descends: the remainder of the rope fixed to the basket is\r\nthrown into the water after him, at the same moment: the rope attached\r\nto the stone is in such a position as to follow him of itself. As soon\r\nas he touches the bottom, he disentangles his foot from the stone,\r\nwhich is immediately drawn up, and suspended again to the projecting\r\noar in the same manner as before, to be in readiness for the next\r\ndiver. The diver, arrived at the bottom of the sea, throws himself as\r\nmuch as possible upon his face, and collects everything he can get\r\nhold of into the basket. When he is ready to ascend, he gives a jerk\r\nto the rope, and the persons in the boat, who hold the other end of\r\nit, haul it up as speedily as possible. The diver, at the same time,\r\nfree of every incumbrance, warps up by the rope, and always gets above\r\nwater a considerable time before the basket. He generally comes up at a\r\ndistance from the boat, and swims about, or takes hold of an oar or a\r\nrope, until his turn comes to descend again; but he seldom comes into\r\nthe boat, until the labour of the day is over. When a young diver is\r\ntraining to the business, he descends in the arms of a man completely\r\nexperienced in the art, who takes great care of him, and shows him the\r\nmanner of proceeding, and the pupil at first brings up in his hand a\r\nsingle oyster, a stone, or a little sand, merely to show that he has\r\nreached the bottom. The length of time during which the divers remain\r\nunder water, is rarely much more than a minute and a half; yet, in\r\nthis short period, in a ground richly clothed with oysters, an expert\r\nman will often put as many as one hundred and fifty into his basket.\r\nThere are two divers attached to each stone, so that they go down\r\nalternately. The men, after diving, generally find a small quantity\r\nof blood issue from their nose and ears, which they consider as a\r\nfavourable symptom, and perform the operation with greater comfort\r\nafter the bleeding has commenced. They seem to enjoy the labour as a\r\npleasant pastime, and never murmur or complain, unless when the banks\r\ncontain a scarcity of oysters, though their labours are continued for\r\nsix hours.\r\n\r\nWhen the day is sufficiently advanced, the head pilot makes a signal,\r\nand the fleet set sail for the shore. All descriptions of people hasten\r\nto the water’s edge to welcome their return, and the crowd, stir, and\r\nnoise, are then immense. Every boat comes to its own station, and the\r\noysters are carried into certain paved enclosures on the sea-shore,\r\nwhere they are allowed to remain in heaps (of course, well guarded) for\r\nten days, that time being necessary to render them putrid. When the\r\noysters are sufficiently decayed, they are thrown into a large vessel,\r\nfilled with salt water, and left there for twelve hours to soften their\r\nputrid substance. The oysters are then taken up, one by one, the shells\r\nbroken from one another, and washed in the water. Those shells, which\r\nhave pearls adhering to them, are thrown on one side, and afterwards\r\nhanded to clippers, whose business it is to disengage the pearls from\r\nthe shells, with pincers.\r\n\r\nWhen all the shells are thrown out, the slimy substance of the oysters\r\nremains, mixed with sand and broken fragments of shells, at the bottom\r\nof the vessel. The dirty water is lifted out in buckets, and poured\r\ninto a sack, made like a jelly-bag, so that no pearls can be lost.\r\nFresh water being then added from time to time, and the whole substance\r\nin the vessel continually agitated, the sand and pearls together, are\r\nby degrees allowed to sink to the bottom.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sand is dry it is sifted; the large pearls, being\r\nconspicuous, are easily gathered; but the separating the small\r\nand diminutive (“seed pearls,” as they are called,) is a work of\r\nconsiderable labour. When once separated from the sand, washed with\r\nsalt water, dried, and rendered perfectly clean, they are sorted into\r\nclasses, according to their sizes, by being passed through sieves.\r\nAfter this, a hole is drilled through each pearl; they are then\r\narranged on strings, and are fit for the market.\r\n\r\nPearls have been considered as valuable ornaments from the earliest\r\ntimes: they are mentioned in the book of Job (xxviii. 18,) and are\r\noften alluded to by the classical writers. There have been various\r\nattempts made to imitate them successfully, one of the most singular\r\nof which,—known to have been practised early in the Christian era,\r\non the banks of the Red Sea,—is still carried on in China. A hole is\r\nbored in the shell of the pearl oyster, a piece of iron-wire inserted,\r\nand the oyster restored to its place: the animal, wounded by the point\r\nof the wire, deposits a coat of pearly matter round it: this gradually\r\nhardens, successive layers are added, till a pearl of the requisite\r\nsize is formed, and the shell is once more brought to land.\r\n\r\nA plan, somewhat similar to this, was employed by Linnæus, who pierced\r\nthe shells of the fresh-water mussel, causing thereby a pearl to be\r\nformed at the punctured spot; and the Swedish government actually\r\nestablished artificial pearleries,—but these were abandoned after\r\na few years; for, although pearls were formed, they were seldom of\r\nsufficient size to be of much value.\r\n\r\nFalse pearls are made of hollow glass globules, the inside of which is\r\ncovered with a liquid, called pearl-essence, and then filled with white\r\nwax. This liquid is composed of the silver-coloured particles which\r\nadhere to the scales of the bleak, (_ablette_,) and was first applied\r\nto this purpose, early in the last century, by a Frenchman of the name\r\nof Jacquin[3].\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAMMER OYSTER, (_Malleus albus_.)\r\n\r\nThe singular figure of this shell renders it very remarkable;\r\nexternally its appearance is very rude and irregular, but, on the other\r\nhand, the inner surface is equally beautiful, being covered with the\r\nmost brilliant mother-of-pearl. The different species of the Malleus\r\nare all marine, and found in the seas of hot climates, and the rarity\r\nof some causes them to be very valuable, and much sought after. Like\r\nthe neighbouring genera, the animal is furnished with a byssus, or\r\nbeard, by which it adheres to the rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROUGH PINNA, (_Pinna rudis_.)\r\n\r\nThe Pinna is a marine shell; most of the species are large, and the\r\nshells very thin in proportion to their size. That represented in the\r\nengraving is found in the American seas, and is sometimes as much\r\nas a foot and a half in length; it is by no means rare. There is a\r\nspecies found in the Mediterranean, in about five or six fathoms water,\r\nwhich is much sought after by the inhabitants of Sicily and Calabria,\r\nnot only as an article of food, but also for the sake of its beard,\r\nor byssus, of which, in many places, a kind of cloth is made, very\r\nremarkable for its softness and warmth. The fishermen, to obtain the\r\nPinna, make use of a kind of iron rake, called a _crampe_, with teeth a\r\nfoot in length; when the shells are drawn up, the beards are found to\r\nbe torn in some part of their substance. If a sufficient length remains\r\nattached to the animal, to render the fibres available for the purpose\r\nof spinning, they are cut off close to the shell: they are then dried\r\nand spun, and afterwards woven into gloves, stockings, caps, and even\r\ngarments of much larger size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pinna rudis._]\r\n\r\nThe threads of which the byssus is formed are extremely fine, and of\r\nequal thickness throughout their whole length, very strong, and of a\r\ndark morone colour, which is exceedingly permanent.\r\n\r\nThis curious kind of cloth was long since known to the ancients; but\r\nat present its manufacture is very limited, from the great scarcity of\r\nthe Pinna, and the number of beards necessary to make even so small an\r\narticle as a pair of gloves. But it is supposed, that if the shells\r\nwere placed in more favourable circumstances, in preserves, &c., they\r\nwould increase much more rapidly.\r\n\r\nThese shells are found in the seas of all hot climates, but the British\r\nshores possess but one species, the _Pinna lævis_ of Donovan; this is\r\nof a horny colour, clouded with brown, and attains a considerable size.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON MUSSEL, (_Mytilus edulis_.)\r\n\r\nThe Mussels are a well-known and very useful genus of the shell-bearing\r\nanimals: they are generally found attached to rocks between high and\r\nlow water marks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mytilus edulis._]\r\n\r\nThey are sought after in most parts of the world as an article of food;\r\nand, although not equal to the oyster, make a very palatable dish.\r\n\r\nThe Mussel, although usually wholesome, is at times the cause of\r\nsevere, though temporary illness. Different reasons have been assigned\r\nfor this poisonous property, and many signs have been noted, by\r\nwhich it is said the unwholesome state of this shell-fish can be\r\ndetected,—a yellowness of colour, an extremely meagre appearance,\r\npartial corruption, a diseased state of the animal, a small crab or\r\ninsect found between the valves of its shell. Other observers have\r\nridiculously attributed the effects to the change in the phases of\r\nthe moon; but, if we are to believe a French physician, who made many\r\nexperiments, all these guesses are wrong; according to this author,\r\nthe ill effects are caused only after the Mussels have been feeding\r\non the spawn of the star-fish; this spawn appears to the eye merely\r\na shapeless lump of jelly, but after a few days it is a living mass\r\nof infant star-fish. The time of the year during which this spawn is\r\ncast, is from the end of April, or beginning of May, to the end of\r\nJuly, or beginning of August; from this, he says, arises the common\r\nobservation, that Mussels are only poisonous during those months in\r\nwhich the letter _r_ is not found. This spawn, according to our author,\r\nis so venomous and caustic, that it causes great pain, swelling, and\r\ninflammation, even to the hand, if handled at this season; rubbing the\r\npart with vinegar is recommended as a cure. Small star-fish were rolled\r\nup in other food, and given to dogs and cats, when the animals suffered\r\nseverely, and in the end generally died. In spite, however, of all\r\nthese experiments, it is still doubtful whether the true cause has been\r\ndiscovered. Thus much appears to be certain, that whenever indigestion\r\noccurs after eating Mussels, some ill effects are experienced, but\r\nthis has seldom, or very rarely, taken place when they have been eaten\r\nwith vinegar, and they are much more wholesome cooked than otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen an individual is _musselled_, the effects are very alarming;\r\nthe body, head, and face swell to a frightful extent; and, in a few\r\nhours, the skin is covered with a bright scarlet eruption; the cure is\r\nattempted by means of an emetic, and afterwards some aromatic drink,\r\nand vinegar and water; this brings on a profuse perspiration, which\r\nsoon relieves the patient.\r\n\r\nThe Mussel is taken by our fishermen for bait, for which purpose it is\r\nwell adapted.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the Mediterranean great attention is paid to the\r\nmultiplication of this animal. At the port of Tarento, in the kingdom\r\nof Naples, they drive into the sand a number of long poles, to which\r\nthe spawn of the Muscle becomes attached. In the following August,\r\nwhen they have attained the size of almonds, they are taken to the\r\nmouth of the brooks and small streams which fall into the gulf; here\r\nthey are left until October, when they are taken back to the sea, and\r\nin the following Spring they are considered fit to eat. This change\r\nfrom the salt to the fresh water and back again, is said to improve\r\ntheir flavour and colour. Near Rochelle they are preserved in tanks,\r\npreserves in which the salt water remains at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT TRIDACNA, (_Tridacna gigas_.)\r\n\r\nThe _Tridacna gigas_ is the largest of the bivalve shells; it is very\r\nthick and close in texture, and is said to have been found as much as\r\nfive hundred pounds in weight. In Catholic countries the shells have\r\nbeen sometimes used as the receptacles for the holy water in the\r\nchurches, and formerly they were considered sufficiently valuable to\r\nform a present to a king; those in St. Sulpice, at Paris, were given\r\nto Francis the First by the Republic of Venice. They have been found\r\nin India, as it is related, of so extreme a size, that more than one\r\nhundred persons have made a meal on the flesh of a single Tridacna\r\ngigas, but this, no doubt, is an exaggeration. These shells adhere\r\nto the rocks by their short and strong byssus with so much tenacity,\r\nas to require the assistance of a mallet and chisels, in the task of\r\nseparating them from the rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tridacna gigas._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER BIMUSCULOSA,\r\n\r\n(Shells with Two Pairs of Muscles.)_\r\n\r\nThis Order contains by far the greatest portion of the bivalve shells,\r\nall interesting to the naturalist, from the variety and beauty of their\r\nstructure, but few possessing a claim to notice on account of their\r\nuse as food for mankind, not but that many are equally wholesome with\r\nthose belonging to the last order, but as they possess two or more\r\npairs of muscles, they are much more capable of moving from place to\r\nplace, and, consequently, are seldom found in any great quantities in\r\none spot, and being found, as they generally are, in a considerable\r\ndepth of water, they are not so easily obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRESH-WATER MUSSEL, (_Anodonta cygnæa_.)\r\n\r\nAlthough this shell, and several other species which nearly resemble\r\nit, are known by the trivial name of _Mussel_, the only resemblance\r\nbetween them consists in their outward appearance, the animals which\r\ninhabit the shells being very distinct, both in organization and in\r\nhabits. The Mussels, as we have already said, have very little power\r\nof moving from place to place, while, on the other hand, the Anodonta\r\nis at times far from being a sluggish animal, and, for the purpose of\r\nshifting its position, it avails itself of a very strong and broad\r\nmuscular foot. The shell of the Anodonta is sometimes found to contain\r\npearls, a circumstance which frequently occurs in all shells which are\r\nlined with mother-of-pearl.\r\n\r\nSome of the Scotch rivers have produced numerous specimens of pearl,\r\nvery large and beautiful, and which used to bear an extremely high\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nA paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1693, mentions the\r\ncollection of pearls from this shell, in the river Omagh, County\r\nTyrone, in Ireland. “The poor people,” he says, “in the Summer months,\r\ngo into the water, and some with their toes, some with wooden tongs,\r\nand some by putting a sharpened stick into the opening of the shell,\r\ntake them up; and, although, by a common estimate, not above one shell\r\nin a hundred may have a pearl, and of these pearls not above one in\r\na hundred be tolerably clear, yet a vast number of fair merchantable\r\npearls, and too good for the apothecary, are offered for sale by those\r\npeople every Summer assizes. Some gentlemen of the country make good\r\nadvantage thereof, and myself, whilst there, saw one pearl bought for\r\n50_l._ that weighed thirty-six carats, and was valued at 40_l._ A\r\nmiller took out a pearl, which he sold for 4_l._ 10_s._ to a man that\r\nsold it for 10_l._, who sold it to the late Lady Glenanly for 30_l._,\r\nwith whom I saw it in a necklace; she refused 80_l._ for it from the\r\nlate Dutchess of Ormond.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Isocardia cor. Anodonta Cygnæa._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEART-SHAPED ISOCARDIA,\r\n\r\n(_Isocardia cor_.)\r\n\r\nThis shell, which is very common in the Mediterranean, where it goes by\r\nthe name of the _foolscap-shell_, and the _bullock’s heart shell_, is\r\nrare in the British seas, but it is sometimes found on the Irish coast;\r\nit is the largest British bivalve shell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEDGE-SHAPED DONAX, (_Donax cuneata_.)\r\n\r\nThere are nearly thirty species of Donax, all extremely beautiful; that\r\nrepresented in the engraving is of a whitish colour with red streaks:\r\nit is often met with in collections of Indian shells. One of these\r\nspecies is found on the English coasts, of a delicate white colour, and\r\nstreaked with pink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Donax cuneata._]\r\n\r\nIn following the system of Lamarck, we are gradually led through\r\nvarious genera to two species figured on the next page, namely, the\r\nTellina, or _earth-shell_, and the Pandora, and, ultimately, to the\r\nSolen, or _razor-shell_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHEATH SOLEN, (_Solen vagina_.)\r\n\r\nThe Solens are singular from the power they possess of burying\r\nthemselves in the sands on the coast, sometimes even to the depth of a\r\ncouple of feet. The foot of the Solen, by means of which it is able to\r\npenetrate the sand, is equal to one-half of the length of the shell.\r\nTheir movements are confined to rising to the surface of the sand in\r\nwhich they have formed their hole, and in again sinking to the bottom.\r\nThis movement is, no doubt, produced by the action of the foot, which\r\nforms itself into a sharp point in its descent, and when it remounts is\r\nenlarged as much as possible, to form a resting-point, for the purpose\r\nof raising the shell to the surface. It is not supposed that the animal\r\never entirely leaves its hole of its own accord, although it may\r\npossess the power; but it is certain, according to the observations of\r\nRéaumur, that if forcibly removed it can re-enter it. The hole it forms\r\nfor its retreat is always perpendicular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tellina. Solen vagina. Pandora rostrata._]\r\n\r\nOne of these creatures, being taken out of its retreat, was laid on\r\nthe sand; it first extended its foot in the form of a wedge, or rather\r\ncone, and, applying it to the surface of the sand, slightly raised the\r\nfarthest end of its shell; at the next effort the projecting part of\r\nthe foot was buried in the sand, and the shell became more elevated;\r\nafter two or three more attempts the hole had attained a perpendicular\r\ndirection, and the shell was partly buried in it; the shell then began\r\nto descend, and that with considerable quickness.\r\n\r\nThe Solens are used sometimes, but rarely, for food; but in places\r\nwhere they abound, they are sought after as bait for fishes: the method\r\nof taking them is very singular. Having discovered the place of retreat\r\nof the creature, by observing the hole in the sand which leads to its\r\nchamber, the fisherman throws into its entrance a small quantity of\r\nsalt. Although an inhabitant of salt water, the pure salt produces so\r\nirritating an effect on the extremity of its body, that it quickly\r\nmounts to the surface; the fisherman, waiting for its appearance,\r\nsnatches hastily at it, and if he succeeds in seizing it firmly, makes\r\ngood his capture; but if not sufficiently active, and the animal\r\nescapes, the application of fresh salt produces no further effect;\r\neither it is not sensible to the additional infusion of salt, or, which\r\nis most likely, the instinct of self-preservation causes it to put up\r\nwith the inconvenience rather than be taken. In this case, no other\r\nmeans are left of securing it, than using an iron instrument to dig it\r\nout with. The number of species is upwards of twenty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DATE-SHAPED PHOLAS, (_Pholas dactyloides_.)\r\n\r\nThese creatures have much more powerful means of boring than the\r\nsolens, for not only do they imbed themselves in hard clay, but even in\r\nstone and lava. In what manner this is effected has been the subject of\r\nmuch dispute; it is almost certain that the process is not mechanical,\r\nfor their soft body, and the fragile nature of their shells, seem an\r\ninsuperable bar to such a proceeding. Some authors have asserted that\r\nthe hole is formed by means of an acid secreted by the animal, which\r\nacts chemically on the stone; but there are two reasons against this\r\nsolution of the difficulty; first, no acid liquid has been discovered\r\nin the living animal, and, secondly, although acid would act upon\r\nstone, it would have no effect whatever on lava.\r\n\r\nAnother curious part of the history of these shell-fish is their\r\nphosphorescence, which is so bright, that it has been asserted, if\r\neaten in the dark without their being cooked, it appears as if the\r\nperson devouring them was swallowing phosphorus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pholas dactyloides._]\r\n\r\nAlthough not used as food in this country, they are not uncommonly\r\neaten on the shores of the Mediterranean, where some large species are\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe species represented in the engraving is found on the British\r\ncoasts, imbedded in clay; its shell is of a delicate white, beautifully\r\ncarved. The projecting piece at the lower part of the shell in the\r\nengraving is the long foot of the animal; on the right hand, the hole\r\nfrom which a shell has been removed is shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHIP-WORM, (_Teredo navalis_.)\r\n\r\nBefore the anatomy of this destructive creature had been carefully\r\nexamined, there was as much difficulty in guessing at the means it\r\nemployed in penetrating the solid timbers in which it is found, as\r\nthere is with regard to the operations of the Pholas; but subsequent\r\nobservation shows that the hard parts, of which the mouth is formed,\r\nare fully equal to the task.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Teredo navalis._]\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may say, with propriety, that this is the only species of\r\nthe shell-bearing tribes that is decidedly injurious to mankind. The\r\nanimal of the Teredo is a long worm-shaped creature, dwelling in a\r\ntube of a shelly substance, which it forms for itself in its progress\r\nthrough the wood; the small pointed shell-like pieces, to the right\r\nin the engraving, form the jaws of the animal. With the assistance of\r\nthese it cuts its way into the timber, and, at the same time, lines the\r\nexcavation it is making with a shelly substance, which is gradually\r\nformed into a tube, the animal occupying that part which is most\r\ndeeply sunken in the timber; in directing its course it generally\r\nexcavates in the direction of the grain of the wood, but in some\r\ninstances it crosses this grain.\r\n\r\nIn Holland a great part of the country is below the level of high\r\nwater, and, to prevent the irruption of the sea, immense dykes have\r\nbeen formed along the coast; these are framed, on the sea-side, of\r\nlarge masses of sand, while to the landward they are strengthened by\r\nmeans of strong piles driven into the ground and wattled together.\r\nThese piles were once discovered pierced in all directions by this\r\ndestructive worm, to such an extent as to endanger their safety, and\r\nhad it not been for a timely discovery of the mischief, immense tracts\r\nof country would have been laid under water, and irretrievably lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS CIRRHIPEDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cirrhipeds are well known under the names of _Barnacles_ and\r\n_Acorn-shells_, being found attached to rocks, ships’ bottoms, and\r\npieces of timber which have been under the water for a length of time.\r\nThey also at times fix themselves on the shells of the larger Mollusca,\r\nand on the backs of whales, tortoises, &c. These creatures, from their\r\nsingular formation, have often proved a stumbling-block in the way of\r\nthe systematic naturalist, who, from their anomalous characters, was\r\nunable to refer them to any part of his system; and although their\r\ntrue nature, which has more recently been discovered by a British\r\nnaturalist, was partially suspected by Lamarck, (without, however, any\r\ndefinite idea on the subject,) we have still placed them immediately\r\nafter the Conchifera, although, as we shall presently show, they ought\r\nmore properly to be ranged with the Crustacea, that is, the crab and\r\nlobster tribes, and in future systems this no doubt will be the case.\r\n\r\nAfter noticing their resemblance in many respects to the Crustacea,\r\nLamarck thus expresses himself. “In fact, when I established the\r\nCLASS of Crustacea, I formed the _first order_ of this class, (the\r\n_Cirrhipeds_,) under the name of _sightless Crustacea_, but a few years\r\nafterwards I separated them and placed them at the end of the Mollusca,\r\nbut this was no better. If, for example, we consider those characters\r\nwhich furnish their most important organs, we shall find that the\r\nCirrhipeds, without any doubt, most nearly resemble the Crustacea,\r\nfor they have the same system of nerves, they have jaws analogous to\r\nthose of the Crustacea, and their tentacula resemble the antennæ of the\r\nshrimps.” To prove that they really were Crustacea, was a task that\r\ndevolved upon a British naturalist, I. V. Thomson, Esq., a surgeon in\r\nhis Majesty’s forces. The manner in which this discovery took place, we\r\nshall notice further on.\r\n\r\nThe Cirrhipeds have obtained their name from the hairy feelers, or\r\ntentacula, with which they are provided; the name Cirrhipeda being\r\nderived from two Latin words,—_cirrhus_, hair, and _pes_, the foot;\r\nthese appendages, being figuratively called feet, although they have,\r\nin reality, but little relation to that organ of motion.\r\n\r\nThey have been separated into two orders; namely, _Cirrhipeda\r\npedunculata_, which are attached to any object by a tube of a leathery\r\nnature, as, for instance, the Barnacle,—and _Cirrhipeda sedentaria_,\r\nwhich are fixed directly to the rock, like the Acorn-shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER CIRRHIPEDA PEDUNCULATA._\r\n\r\n(_Cirrhipeda with a Footstalk._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SMOOTH BARNACLE, (_Anatifa lævis_.)\r\n\r\nThe curious popular error, that the Barnacle contained the young of\r\na species of goose, which was thence called the Barnacle Goose, has\r\nlasted for many ages, and still prevails among the uneducated, on the\r\nshores of many of the European seas. One reason of the continuance of\r\nthis error in several Roman Catholic countries, is the permission\r\ngranted by the priest to its members, to eat this goose on fish-days,\r\nbecause it is considered, on account of its supposed watery origin, to\r\npartake more of the character of a fish than a fowl. To show the extent\r\nto which an erroneous belief may be carried, we may quote the following\r\nnotice sent by Sir Robert Moray to the Royal Society, and _printed_ by\r\nthem in their _Transactions_. He says, “The pedicle seems to draw and\r\nconvey the matter which serves for the growth and vegetation of the\r\nshell and the little bird within it.” “In every shell that I opened, I\r\nfound a perfect _sea-fowl_; the little bill like that of a _goose_, the\r\neyes marked; the head, neck, breast, wings, tail, and feet formed; the\r\nfeathers everywhere perfectly shaped, and blackish-coloured; and the\r\n_feet_ like those of other water-fowl, to my best remembrance!” “Nor\r\ndid I ever see any of the little birds alive, nor met with anybody that\r\ndid; only some credible persons have assured me that they have seen\r\nsome as big as their fist!!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anatifa lævis._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER CIRRHIPEDA SEDENTARIA_,\r\n\r\n(_Sedentary Cirrhipeds_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACORN-SHELL, (_Balanus_.)\r\n\r\nMr. Thomson describes his discovery of the real nature of the\r\nCirrhipeds in these words. “On April 28, 1823, which the author had\r\ndevoted to the investigation of some marine productions, he was\r\nreturning home without any addition to his stock of knowledge, when,\r\ncasually throwing out a small muslin towing-net, on crossing the ferry\r\nat Passage, such a capture of marine animals was made, as furnished a\r\ntreat which few can ever expect to meet, and could hardly be excelled\r\nfor the variety, rarity, and interesting nature of the animals taken.”\r\nAfter mentioning the names of several very rare species, he continues\r\n“and others perfectly nondescript, and incapable of being associated in\r\nany of our classifications of the Crustacea; of this description is the\r\nlittle animal about to be described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Balanus_, (The Acorn-Shell Barnacle.)]\r\n\r\n“There is a small translucent animal one-tenth of an inch long, of a\r\nsomewhat elliptic form, moderately compressed, and of a brownish hue.\r\nWhen in a state of perfect repose, it resembles a very minute mussel,\r\nand lies upon one of its sides at the bottom of the vessel of sea-water\r\nin which it is placed. At this time all the members of the animal are\r\nwithdrawn within the shell, which appears to be composed of two valves,\r\nunited by a hinge along the upper part of the back, and capable of\r\nopening from one end to the other along the front, to give occasional\r\nexit to the legs. The limbs are of two descriptions; namely, in front a\r\nlarge and very strong pair, provided with a cup-like sucker and hooks,\r\n&c., and at the hinder part of the body, six pair of swimming-members,\r\nso articulated as to act in concert, and to give a very forcible stroke\r\nto the water, so as to cause the animal, when swimming, to advance by a\r\nsuccession of bounds, after the manner of the water flea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.

The eyes were still perceptible, although the principal part\r\nof the black colouring-matter appeared to have been thrown off with\r\nthe _exuviæ_. On the 10th, another individual was seen _in the act of\r\nthrowing off its shell_, and attaching itself, like the others, to the\r\nbottom of the glass.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS ANNULATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot better describe the Annulose animals than in the words of\r\nLamarck; he calls them,\r\n\r\n“Animals with soft bodies, lengthened, worm-shaped, naked, or\r\ninhabiting tubes, with the body divided into segments, or at least\r\ntransverse wrinkles, often without head, without eyes, and without\r\nantennæ, unfurnished with articulated limbs, but the greater number\r\nhaving, instead, small protuberances, bearing spines, and capable of\r\nbeing retracted at pleasure, disposed in rows along the sides, though\r\nnot continued quite to the extremity of the body, and assuming various\r\nforms. They have also red blood circulating by veins and arteries; this\r\nseparates them from the Worms, properly so called, which have white\r\nblood. This colour of the blood is a singular fact, since the animals\r\nare much less complex in their organization than the Mollusca, which\r\nhave colourless blood. The Class of Annulose animals has been separated\r\ninto three Orders, namely, _Annulata sedentaria_, which are fixed to\r\nother substances; _Annulata antennata_, possessing antennæ, or feelers;\r\nand _Annulata apoda_, without projecting members answering as feet,\r\nserving solely to attach the animal to rocks, stones, &c.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Shells of various sedentary Annulose Animals._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER ANNULATA SEDENTARIA_,\r\n\r\n(_Sedentary Annulose Animals_.)\r\n\r\nThe creatures which form this order are generally found attached\r\nto rocks, shells, &c. and are usually of small size. The engraving\r\nrepresents a variety of species of these animals. Of the genus Serpula\r\nthere are many species, but as it is in general merely the shell\r\nthat is found in collections, they are but ill defined; some of the\r\nspecies are found in almost all climates. The animal of the Serpula has\r\ngreat power of contracting its body, but it never leaves its shell or\r\ntube; this tube is gradually lengthened by the inhabitant, who always\r\noccupies the most recently-formed portion of it; its _operculum_, the\r\nlid with which it closes the opening of its tube, is very prettily\r\nformed; it is something like the mouth-piece of a trumpet, but of\r\ncourse not perforated, and it closes the opening with great accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGNIFICENT AMPHITRITE,\r\n\r\n(_Amphitrite magnifica_.)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful species is perhaps the largest of the whole tribe as\r\nyet discovered. It is found in various parts of the coast of Jamaica,\r\nadhering to, or rather embedded in, the rocks. Its irritability is\r\nexceedingly great, and on being approached it instantly retreats into\r\nits elastic tube; this tube is of a leathery consistence, unlike that\r\nof the Serpula. Specimens of this elegant species can only be obtained\r\nby breaking off such parts of the stone as contain them. These, being\r\nput into tubs of sea-water, may be kept for months in perfect health.\r\nThat part of the body which is so beautifully spread out like an\r\numbrella, consists of the _branchiæ_ or organs of breathing; these are\r\nof a yellowish colour, beautifully marked with pink. The Amphitrite,\r\nalthough perhaps it never entirely leaves its tube, is not attached to\r\nit, and frequently draws out nearly the whole of its body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Amphitrite magnifica._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER ANNULATA ANTENNATA_,\r\n\r\n(_Annulose Animals possessing Antennæ_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAND-WORM OF THE FISHERMEN,\r\n\r\n(_Arenicola piscatorium_.)\r\n\r\nThis Worm forms its nest in the sand on the sea-shore, and is much\r\nsought after by fishermen as bait for fishes. It is found in all the\r\nEuropean seas. There appears to be but one species, but that is met\r\nwith in great abundance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arenicola piscatorium._]\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD-COLOURED LEODICE, (_Leodice sanguinea_.)\r\n\r\nThe antennated Annulata differ materially from those which are\r\nenclosed in a case; they possess, in addition to their antennæ, organs\r\nof motion, like the false legs of a caterpillar, and two or four\r\nwell-formed eyes; they are all marine animals, and altogether they bear\r\na strong resemblance to the _scolopendra_, or centipede.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Leodice sanguinea._]\r\n\r\nThe species represented above was taken on the southern coast of\r\nDevonshire; it is the largest English species, extending sometimes to\r\nthe length of fourteen or fifteen inches.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal was in a glass of sea-water, the circulation of the\r\nblood through the bristle-like appendages on each side of the body\r\nwas a curious object, and appeared to be effected at the will of the\r\nanimal, but when it became sickly, the circulation was slower, and as\r\nsoon as it expired all the colour from those parts vanished.\r\n\r\nThe mouth is large, and placed beneath, concealing most formidable\r\njaws, or complicated fangs, which were put forward occasionally as the\r\nanimal became sickly, or in the agonies of death. The figure beneath\r\nthe worm shows the shape of this singular apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPINOUS SEA-MOUSE, OR SEA-CATERPILLAR,\r\n\r\n(_Halithæa aculeata_.)\r\n\r\nThe Sea-Mouse is found in the European seas, and when in its native\r\nelement is singularly beautiful, the hair with which it is partially\r\ncovered being equal in splendour to the colours on the tail of a\r\npeacock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Halithæa aculeata._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER ANNULATA APODA_,\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Footless Annulose Animals_.)\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the Annulose animals, namely those already\r\ndescribed, are furnished with small projecting points on the sides\r\nof their body, which assist them in their motions, and which may,\r\nconsequently, be considered as supplying the place of feet; but those\r\nwe have yet to notice have no similar appendages, and, therefore, they\r\nare called footless. They are all very lively in their movements, and\r\nlive either in moist earth, or the mud at the bottom of ponds. We\r\nfind among the footless Annulata two well-known genera, namely, the\r\nEarth-worm and the Leech.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON EARTH-WORM,\r\n\r\n(_Lumbricus terrestris_.)\r\n\r\nThe body of the Earth-worm is composed of a great number of narrow\r\nrings, and along each side are four rows of very small, short,\r\nsilk-like bristles, of a substance partly horny and partly shell-like.\r\nThese bristles are placed on the edges of the rings, and it is by the\r\nalternate contraction and expansion of these rings that the worm is\r\nenabled to move along, the little bristles acting like hooks, and so\r\nforming various fixed points of resistance or _fulcra_, upon which the\r\nanimal can rest at each movement forwards. The organization of the\r\nEarth-worm is very simple, the intestinal canal for the food being a\r\nsimple straight tube, except in one part of its length, where a kind\r\nof gizzard is found, which answers the purpose of a stomach. It is\r\nsupposed to feed upon the vegetable substances it finds in the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe hole, or burrow, formed in the earth by the worm, always has two\r\nopenings, one by which it enters, and by which it throws out the dirt\r\nwhich is removed during the progress of its excavation, and the other\r\nby which it sometimes leaves its burrow, so that the hole made by the\r\nanimal would be much in this form, descending at A, and reaching the\r\nsurface by B. It has been said, that the Earth-worm, if divided by the\r\nspade or otherwise, will unite again and live; the foundation for this\r\nappears to be the more probable fact, that, when divided, that portion\r\nof the animal in which the head is placed may, perhaps, survive the\r\nmutilation, and ultimately again become a perfect creature.\r\n\r\nAlthough worms, after wet weather, sadly disfigure our gravel walks,\r\nthey are, at the same time, useful gardeners, loosening the earth round\r\nthe roots of plants, and thus rendering it more capable of receiving\r\nthe small fibres of the roots. During the Winter they penetrate very\r\ndeeply into the ground, and remain, according to Latreille, rolled up\r\nin a kind of nest, protected from injury by the discharge of _mucus_,\r\nwhich is furnished by the pores of their body.\r\n\r\nThe Earth-worm appears to have been a considerable favourite with\r\nthe author of the _Journal of a Naturalist_; among other remarks,\r\nhe observes, “There is another creature, and that a very important\r\none in the operations of nature, that is surrounded by dangers,\r\nharassed, pursued incessantly, and becomes the prey of all; the common\r\nEarth-worm. This animal, destined to be the natural manurer of the\r\nsoil, and the ready indicator of an approved staple, consumes on the\r\nsurface of the ground, where they soon would be injurious, the softer\r\nparts of decayed vegetable matter, and conveys into the soil the\r\nmore woody fibres, where they moulder and become reduced to a simple\r\nnutriment, fitting for living vegetation. The parts consumed by them\r\nare soon returned to the surface, whence dissolved by frosts, and\r\nscattered by rains, they circulate again in the plants of the soil,\r\n\r\n                 Death still producing life.\r\n\r\n“Thus eminently serviceable as the Worm is, it yet becomes the prey\r\nof various orders of the animal creation, and perhaps is a solitary\r\nexample of an individual race being subjected to universal destruction.\r\nThe very emmet seizes it when disabled, and bears it away as its\r\nprize. It constitutes throughout the year the food of many birds;\r\nfishes devour it greedily; the hedgehog eats it; the mole pursues it\r\nunceasingly in the pastures, along the moist bottoms of ditches, and\r\nburrows after it through the banks of hedges, to which it retires in\r\ndry seasons. Secured as the Worm appears to be by its residence in the\r\nearth, from the capture of creatures inhabiting a different element,\r\nyet many aquatic animals seem well acquainted with it, and prey on it\r\nas a natural food, whenever it falls in their way: frogs eat it, and\r\neven the great water-beetle I have known to seize it, when the bait of\r\nthe angler, and it has been drawn up by the hook. Yet notwithstanding\r\nthis prodigious destruction of the animal, its increase is fully\r\ncommensurate to its consumption, as if ordained the appointed food of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“Worms, generally speaking, are tender creatures, and water remaining\r\nover their haunts for a few days, drowns them. They easily become\r\nfrozen, when a mortification commences at some part, which gradually\r\nconsumes the whole substance, and we find them on the surface a mass\r\nof jelly. Their retiring deeper into the soil is no bad indication of\r\napproaching cold weather; but no sooner is the frost out of the ground,\r\nthan they approach the surface.\r\n\r\n“Earth-worms do considerable mischief to the floriculturist by drawing\r\nthe young plants, immediately after they are transplanted, into\r\nthe earth. In the drainage of lands they are of essential service,\r\npenetrating the clay that lies beneath the vegetable mould in every\r\ndirection, and thus forming numerous small canals to carry off the\r\nwater into the deep trenches dug by the agriculturist.” The author we\r\nhave already quoted, after concluding this account of the Worm, says,\r\n“I would advocate the cause of all creatures, had I the privilege of\r\nknowing the excellency of them; not willingly assigning vague and\r\nfanciful claims to excite wonder, or manifesting a base pride by any\r\nvaunt of superior observation; but when we see, blind as we are, that\r\nall things are formed in justice, mercy, truth, I would tell my tale\r\nas a man, glory as a Christian, and bless the gracious Power that\r\npermitted me to obtain this knowledge.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICINAL LEECH, (_Hirudo medicinalis_.)\r\n\r\nThe medicinal utility of the Leech seems, even in very remote times, to\r\nhave been acknowledged by mankind, and accordingly we find it noticed\r\nin the writings of many ancient physicians. It was not simply applied\r\nto the cases in which it is at present employed, but was recommended\r\nto be used in many singular ways: a paste made of the ashes of a burnt\r\nleech was said to have the property of removing the hair from any\r\npart of the body. It was also employed to suck the blood from a wound\r\noccasioned by a mad dog, or any other rabid animal.\r\n\r\nAt present the employment of this useful creature is confined to the\r\noperation of drawing blood from inflamed parts of the surface of the\r\nbody, for which use it is eminently adapted.\r\n\r\nThere are as many as twelve or fifteen species of these creatures,\r\nbut only two have been employed in medicine, namely, the _Hirudo\r\nmedicinalis_, which may be known by having six yellowish lines, or\r\nstriæ, on its back, while the under part is of a grayish hue spotted\r\nwith black, but, as we shall presently see, these markings are not\r\nuniformly found; and the _Hirudo troctina_, of a brownish colour,\r\nthe upper part of the body marked with black spots, each of which is\r\nsurrounded with a golden-coloured ring, the sides of a dingy yellow,\r\nand the under part of a yellowish green with black spots.\r\n\r\nThe first of these species, the medicinal leech, is common throughout\r\nthe whole of Europe, but is much more abundant in the Southern parts;\r\nit is generally about three inches in length. Formerly it was very\r\nabundant in Great Britain, but the improvements in agriculture,\r\nand the consequent drainage of the land, together with the great\r\nuse made of it in medicine, have of late years rendered it of less\r\nfrequent occurrence. On this account great quantities of leeches are\r\nimported; these chiefly come from Bourdeaux and Lisbon. On a moderate\r\ncalculation, it appears that, in England, on an average, out of every\r\nhundred leeches employed, ninety-nine may be considered of foreign\r\nproduction; these differ from the English leech in being somewhat\r\nlarger, and having the under part of a uniform colour, without spots.\r\nSome idea may be formed of the number of leeches used in medicine by\r\nthe statement, that in the hospitals of Paris alone, 300,000 were\r\nemployed in one year. The prevailing colour of the medicinal leech\r\nappears to vary according to the nature of the soil on which it is\r\nfound. In Winter the leech retires to waters of considerable depth, and\r\nseeks shelter in the mud at the bottom; but in the Summer it appears\r\nto delight in shallow pools, basking, as it were, in the warmth of the\r\nsun: but if the water it frequents is in danger of being dried up by\r\nthe Summer-heat, the leech buries itself in the mud at a considerable\r\ndepth. Just before a thunder-storm, leeches appear much agitated,\r\nand rise frequently to the surface of the water; this, therefore, is\r\nconsidered by the _leech-gatherers_ as a favourable time for collecting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe property by which a leech anticipates thunder, has induced some\r\npersons to employ it as a species of barometer; for this purpose a\r\nleech is enclosed in a glass vessel half-filled with water, and the\r\nfollowing is supposed to be the result. When the weather is about to be\r\nserene and pleasant, the leech will remain at the bottom of the vessel\r\nwithout the least movement; secondly, if it is about to rain, the\r\nanimal will rise to the surface, and there remain until the approach of\r\nfine weather; thirdly, before boisterous weather, it will appear in a\r\nstate of great agitation; fourthly, on the approach of thunder, it will\r\nremain out of water for several days, appearing agitated and restless,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nThis natural barometer _appears_ to answer tolerably well, if there is\r\nsufficient belief in its virtues on the part of the possessor, and if\r\none leech only is employed; but when several of these creatures are\r\nenclosed in the same vessel, they do not appear to obey the same laws,\r\nand, consequently, their movements do not correspond with sufficient\r\naccuracy to render their indications of the weather of much use.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal leech appears during its whole life to exist on the blood\r\nor other juices of the creatures on whose body it fixes itself; this is\r\nnot the case with the horse-leech, which lives entirely on the _larvæ_\r\nof aquatic insects, worms, &c., so that the common idea of the danger\r\nof the bite of the horse-leech is without foundation.\r\n\r\nThe horse-leech is exceedingly voracious, not only swallowing worms,\r\ntadpoles, &c., but even preying upon its own species. Sixty-five\r\nhorse-leeches were placed in a glass vessel, and in five days the\r\nnumber was reduced to fifty-two, and not a vestige of those that were\r\nmissing was to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe usual slowness of action of the digestive powers in all animals of\r\ncold blood, was curiously illustrated in the case of a horse-leech,\r\nwhich, after swallowing two small leeches of a different species,\r\ndisgorged one of the two at the end of three days, in a living state,\r\nand apparently not much injured from its sojourn in so unusual a\r\nlodging; but it enjoyed its liberty only for a few hours, its more\r\npowerful companion swallowing it a second time at the end of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nA number of this species of leech, inhabiting the water that supplied a\r\ntrough in which a tench had been placed, fixed themselves to different\r\nparts of the body of the fish, and so effectually was the poor tench\r\nannoyed, that it was soon deprived of life. “The leeches then tore it\r\n(previously breaking the line of connexion between the various parts of\r\nthe body, by inflicting a vast number of bites or wounds,) into such\r\npieces as they could readily receive into the stomach, and so diligent\r\nwere they, that in a few days nothing remained of the fish but the mere\r\nskeleton.”\r\n\r\nFrom these habits it would appear, that the name of Hirudo\r\n_sanguisuga_, (the blood-sucking leech,) has been improperly applied to\r\nthe horse-leech; on this account a recent author has suggested the name\r\nof Hirudo _vorax_, (the voracious leech,) as being more suitable to its\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nLeeches are supposed to be very long-lived; two were preserved in\r\nconfinement for eight years before they died, and the well-ascertained\r\nslowness of their growth seems to place their length of life beyond a\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nOn the head of the medicinal leech ten points are arranged in the form\r\nof a horse-shoe, thus—\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese are considered, by some authors, to be organs of sight, or\r\neyes, while, on the other hand, it is stated by others, that they are\r\nmerely tubercles. Lamarck was of this opinion, and, consequently, in\r\ndescribing their character, says they are without eyes.\r\n\r\nThe teeth, or rather piercers, with which the leech is furnished, are\r\nthree in number, of a hard gristly substance, and so placed, with\r\nregard to each other, as to meet in the centre at equal angles; these\r\npiercers are thrust into the skin when the animal attaches itself; not\r\nby one plunging effort, but by constantly scratching or sawing upon the\r\nsurface (assisted at the same time by the sucking action of the lips);\r\nin this manner they gradually become buried in the skin, and there\r\nremain as long as the creature retains its hold; this movement of the\r\npiercers occasions the gnawing pain felt for the first two or three\r\nminutes after the leech has commenced operation.\r\n\r\nLeeches are at times so scarce and valuable, that great care has been\r\ntaken in preserving them in a healthy state and fit for use. The\r\nprincipal art in managing them consists in placing them in vessels\r\nsufficiently large, keeping the water clear, and in removing those\r\nwhich are unhealthy as soon as they are discovered.\r\n\r\nLeeches, when applied to the skin, frequently show little inclination\r\nto bite, and many plans have been resorted to, to induce them to\r\ncommence operations, such as bathing the part with milk, &c.; but\r\nthese methods may be considered useless, and the best plan appears\r\nto be, to wash the part clean, and this is the more necessary when\r\nany embrocation has been previously applied; but the surest way is to\r\npuncture the place slightly, so as to cause the blood to appear. If the\r\nlittle surgeon, before it is fully gorged, appears lazy and unwilling\r\nto proceed, it can be usually roused by being sprinkled with a little\r\ncold water.\r\n\r\nAfter a leech has fallen off, it is usual to sprinkle salt on it to\r\ninduce it to disgorge the blood it has swallowed; but as the salt\r\nfrequently blisters its body, it has been recommended by Dr. Johnson of\r\nEdinburgh, from whose work on the Leech, we have obtained most of the\r\npreceding information, to apply a small portion of vinegar to the head\r\nof the leech instead of salt.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for obliging the leech to dislodge the blood it has\r\nswallowed, arises from the fact that it would remain in the body of\r\nthe animal for some months before it could be all digested; but the\r\nmost singular thing is, that, during the whole of this time, the blood\r\nremains in nearly as fluid a state as when it was newly swallowed[5].\r\nThe stomach of this creature is very curiously formed, being composed\r\nof a number of chambers, each chamber having a separate connexion with\r\nthe intestinal canal, in such a manner that, at the will of the animal,\r\nthe contents of each chamber can be emptied singly into that canal,\r\nthrough a distinct opening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt was long a matter of dispute as to whether leeches were produced\r\nfrom eggs or born alive, but it is now ascertained that the ova are\r\ndeveloped in a singular case, having some resemblance to the cocoon\r\nof a silkworm. The following engraving represents this case, of its\r\nnatural size: fig. 1, shows the perfect case or cocoon, and fig. 2, the\r\nsame opened, with the young leeches contained within it; it is said\r\nthat, at times, there are as many as thirteen or fourteen in one case.\r\nThis cocoon is formed by the parent animal, and by it deposited in the\r\nmud or clay, which composes the bed of the pool it inhabits.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the young leech being produced from these cocoons, although\r\nonly latterly ascertained by naturalists, was long since well-known to\r\nthe dealers in leeches on the French coast, who avail themselves of\r\nthis knowledge of their habits, to multiply them for the purpose of\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n“It was by these means the leech-dealers of Bretagne, and particularly\r\nin Finisterre, replenished the ponds in which they preserved those\r\nleeches which were intended for the Paris market.\r\n\r\n“About the month of April or May, according to the nature of the\r\nseason, they send out labourers, provided with spades and baskets, to\r\nthe little muddy marshes, where they are known to exist in abundance.\r\nThese workmen then set about removing those portions of mud that are\r\nknown to contain cocoons, which are afterwards deposited in sheets of\r\nwater previously prepared for their reception; here the young leeches\r\nquit the cocoons, and are allowed to remain for six months, when they\r\nare removed to larger ponds.” While they remain in these ponds, the\r\ncattle and other animals are driven to the water, for the purpose of\r\nallowing the young to feed upon them, as it is supposed that they grow\r\nmuch more rapidly after having partaken of blood.\r\n\r\nThere is a small species of leech in the island of Ceylon, which is\r\nmore dreaded, and, from its great numbers, produces more evil, than\r\neven the venomous reptiles which are found in the island, including the\r\nterrible hooded snake itself.\r\n\r\nThe largest of these leeches are seldom more than half an inch in\r\nlength, and the smallest are minute indeed. This leech is a very active\r\nanimal; it moves with great rapidity, and is even said occasionally\r\nto spring. It is supposed to have an acute sense of smelling, for no\r\nsooner does a person stop where leeches abound, that they appear to\r\ncrowd eagerly to the spot from all quarters. In rainy weather, it is\r\nshocking to see the legs of men on a long march thickly beset with\r\nthese creatures, gorged with blood, and the blood itself trickling down\r\nin streams. It might be supposed there be little difficulty in keeping\r\nthem off; but they crowd to the attack, and fasten on more quickly\r\nthan they can be removed. Their bites are much more troublesome than\r\nwould be imagined, being very apt to fester and become sores, and, in\r\npersons of a bad habit of body, to degenerate into extensive ulcers,\r\nand ultimately cause the loss of a limb, if not that of life itself.\r\n\r\nMany plans have, of course, been resorted to, to avoid this pest, such\r\nas anointing the legs with tobacco-water, grease, &c., but all to very\r\nlittle purpose, the only successful mode appearing to be, the enclosing\r\nthe lower part of the legs in boots and pantaloons, fitting very\r\nclosely to the limb, a very unpleasant dress in so sultry a climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS CRUSTACEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the Crustacea in systems of natural history has\r\nundergone numerous changes; they were placed by Linnæus among the\r\ninsects:—others considered them to have more analogy to the spiders.\r\nLamarck was the first who made the Crustacea an independent CLASS\r\nforming two _orders_, which he has named after the arrangement of the\r\nbranchiæ, or gills, by which they breathe, namely,—the _Crustacea\r\nhomobranchiæ_, the distinguishing marks of which he describes in this\r\nmanner: branchiæ hidden under the lateral margins of a kind of cuirass,\r\ncovering the body of the animal, with the exception of the tail; the\r\nmandibles always furnished with feelers, the eyes placed on footstalks,\r\nthe head not distinct from the trunk, and possessing ten feet to assist\r\nthem in their movements. Secondly, the _Crustacea heterobranchiæ_, in\r\nwhich the branchiæ are external, in various situations, but never under\r\nthe lateral margin of a cuirass; they are either under the belly or the\r\ntail, adhering to the feet, or confounded with them: the eyes are in\r\ngeneral fixed, _sedentary, not on footstalks_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER CRUSTACEA HOMOBRANCHIÆ_,\r\n\r\n(_Shell-Fish with concealed gills._)\r\n\r\nThe first of these orders, the _homobranchial_ Crustacea, includes most\r\nof the larger kinds of shell-fish, as, for instance, crabs, lobsters,\r\nand cray-fish; shrimps and prawns are also in this division.\r\n\r\nTheir organization is much more perfect than that of the other order,\r\nand, according to Lamarck, it is among these animals that the last\r\nappearance of the organ of hearing is seen, in tracing the animal\r\nkingdom from the most perfect animals to those whose formation is\r\napparently less complex.\r\n\r\nThe body of these creatures appears to be composed of only two\r\nprincipal parts, the body and the tail; for the head is so intimately\r\nunited and confounded with the trunk, as to appear to be merely a\r\nportion of it. The two eyes are fixed at the top of two moveable\r\nsupports, and are placed in a hollow prepared for their reception, on\r\neach side of a projecting portion of the shell that covers the head.\r\nThe antennæ, which are usually four in number, are placed about this\r\nspot; they are inserted beneath the stems that support the eyes. The\r\ntwo outermost of these antennæ are generally the longest.\r\n\r\nThe branchiæ, or organs by which they breathe, assume a form somewhat\r\npyramidical, arranged like a series of leaves, or the web of a feather;\r\nthey are placed in the interior of the shell along each side, and are\r\nso arranged as to adhere to the roots of the feet, so that each of\r\nthese feet has a hidden branchia attached to its base.\r\n\r\nThe mouth is composed of a fleshy lip, projecting between the\r\nmandibles; of two hard triangular mandibles, more or less notched at\r\ntheir extremity, and each having a kind of feeler inserted on the upper\r\npart; they also possess a little tongue between these mandibles, at\r\nthe root of which is the opening to the stomach: they have besides two\r\npair of jaws, like leaves, the borders of which are fringed, and six\r\nother members, which Lamarck calls _foot-jaws_, from their bearing\r\nsome resemblance to legs, or feet. From this it appears that the\r\nparts of the mouth in the Crustacea form a complicated apparatus, and\r\naccordingly we find the whole tribe exceedingly voracious, the Crabs\r\nin particular, feeding upon any animal substance, putrid or not, that\r\nmay come within their reach. Some of the species are well known as\r\narticles of food, but they are not equally wholesome at all seasons of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CRAB TRIBE._\r\n\r\nThe genera of the Crustacea are so extremely numerous, and the\r\nknowledge we possess of their natural history is so scanty, being\r\ngenerally confined to their form and colour, that we shall limit\r\nourselves to a description of some of the best known and most useful\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ZOEA OF THE COMMON CRAB.]\r\n\r\nThe Crabs are a very numerous tribe, and contain many singular\r\nspecies, as far as regards their form, which assumes an endless\r\nvariety of curious shapes, sometimes elegantly decorated with the most\r\nbrilliant colours; this more particularly applies to those which are\r\nfound in the seas of hot climates.\r\n\r\nThe singular little animal represented in the preceding page, was\r\nplaced by naturalists among the _Crustacea_, and considered a perfect\r\nanimal of a distinct species; it was named Zoea. Mr. Thomson, the\r\nexperienced naturalist we have already noticed, was the first to\r\ndiscover the real nature of this little creature. We cannot do better\r\nthan to introduce the subject by the following observations of the\r\nauthor of this discovery, showing the reason so little is known\r\nrespecting these inhabitants of the deep.\r\n\r\n“The sea (which is the habitation of the greater part of the\r\n_Crustacea_) to the casual observer offers nothing but an immense body\r\nof water, here and there presenting a solitary whale, or a vagrant\r\ntroop of some of the smaller cetaceous animals; the appearance of a\r\nfish of almost any other kind in the track of a vessel over a vast\r\nexpanse of the open ocean, is regarded, even by the mariner, as a\r\nkind of phenomenon, and creates an interest not to be appreciated by\r\nthose who have not engaged in distant voyages. The fathomless parts\r\nof the ocean certainly do not offer the same profusion of inhabitants\r\nwith the shores of islands and continents, or those parts where the\r\nbottom is within reach of the sounding-line, or where the surface is\r\ninterspersed with fields of Sargosa[6]. On due examination, however, we\r\nshall not fail to find it everywhere peopled by a considerable variety\r\nof animals, either of small size, or possessed of such a degree of\r\ntranslucency as to render them invisible, or scarcely perceptible, even\r\nwhen on or near to its surface; that it should possess its share of\r\nthe organized beings which we see spread over every other part of the\r\nsurface of our globe, is a conclusion we might arrive at indirectly,\r\nfrom the consideration of oceanic fishes and birds being observed in\r\nthose parts of the ocean most distant from the land, and the provident\r\ncare of the Deity, which we invariably witness throughout the domain of\r\nnature, to furnish food for all, even the meanest of his creatures; the\r\nmore minute and invisible inmates of the sea, then, must constitute the\r\nfood of oceanic fishes and birds.\r\n\r\n“Few of these marine animals, except some of the larger and most\r\nconspicuous, have as yet been observed, so that the investigation of\r\nthem holds out a promise of a rich harvest to the naturalist, and\r\na vast field of exploration, replete with novelty and interest; to\r\naccomplish this, however, he must use the greatest diligence, seizing\r\nevery opportunity, when the way of a ship does not exceed three or\r\nfour miles per hour, to throw out astern a small towing-net of gauze,\r\nbunting, or other tolerably close material, occasionally drawing it\r\nup, and turning it inside out into a glass vessel of sea-water, to\r\nascertain what captures have been made. When a ship goes at a greater\r\nrate, and in stormy weather, a net of this kind may be appended to the\r\nspout of one of the _sea-water_ pumps, and examined three or four times\r\na day, or oftener, according to circumstances.”\r\n\r\nAlthough naturalists were decided in calling the Zoea a crustaceous\r\nanimal, they were still far from agreeing as to the place in the\r\nsystem it ought to occupy, for the different species were so unlike\r\neach other: but it will be no longer a matter of surprise, when it\r\nis known, that this singular creature is not a perfect animal, but\r\nmerely the larva, or imperfect state of the Common Crab. This fact is\r\nperfectly new, and interesting in a double point of view, not only\r\nproving their real nature, but also that the Crustacea are not, as\r\ndescribed in most systems, animals undergoing no metamorphosis, and on\r\nthat account to be separated from the insects, but that they do undergo\r\na metamorphosis, and that of a most wonderful nature.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Spring of 1822 that Mr. Thomson first met with Zoeæ,\r\nin the harbour of Cove, and that in considerable abundance; the year\r\nfollowing, at the same season, one of considerable size occurred;\r\nthis was considered a fit object for experiment, and was carefully\r\nsupplied with fresh sea-water, from May 14th to June 15th, when it died\r\nin the act of changing its skin. That portion of its new form which\r\nit had been able to disengage was sufficient to show that it bore a\r\ngreat resemblance to the division of the Crustacea, in which the crabs\r\nand lobsters are placed. “This proof,” says the author, “might be\r\nconsidered incomplete, if I had not had the good fortune to succeed in\r\nhatching the _ova_ of the Common Crab, during the month of June, which\r\npresented exactly the appearance of the _Zoea taurus_.”\r\n\r\nThe Common Crab, _Cancer major_, is so well-known, that any description\r\nof its appearance would be useless.\r\n\r\nOne singular part of the history of these creatures is, the power that\r\nis possessed by them, of changing their shell once in every year; this\r\npower is providentially bestowed upon them, to enable them to increase\r\nin size, a thing that would otherwise be utterly impossible, from the\r\npeculiar nature of the hard coat in which they are enclosed.\r\n\r\nThe Crab, in order to prepare for the extraordinary change it is about\r\nto undergo, when shifting its shell, chooses a close and well-secured\r\nretreat, in the cavities of rocks, or under great stones, where it\r\ncreeps in and remains during the operation. The time of the year\r\nwhen this occurs is about the beginning of the Summer, at which time\r\ntheir food is in plenty, and their strength and vigour in the highest\r\nperfection. But soon all their activity ceases; they are seen forsaking\r\nthe open parts of the deep, and seeking some retired situation among\r\nthe rocks, or some outlet where they may remain in safety from the\r\nattacks of their enemies. For some days before their change, the animal\r\ndiscontinues its usual voraciousness; it is no longer seen laboriously\r\nharrowing up the sand at the bottom, or fighting with others of its\r\nkind, or hunting its prey; it lies torpid and motionless, as if in\r\nanxious expectation of the approaching change. Just before casting\r\nits shell, it throws itself upon its back, strikes its claws against\r\neach other, and every limb seems to tremble; its feelers are agitated,\r\nand the whole body is in violent motion; it then swells itself in an\r\nunusual manner, and at last the shell is seen beginning to divide at\r\nits junctures, particularly at those of the belly, where it was before\r\nseemingly united. It also seems turned inside out; and its stomach\r\ncomes away with its shell. After this, by the same operation, it\r\ndisengages itself of its claws, which burst at the joints; the animal,\r\nwith a tremulous motion, casting them off, as a man would kick off a\r\nboot that was too big for him.\r\n\r\nThus, in a short time, this wonderful creature finds itself at liberty;\r\nbut in so weak and enfeebled a state that it continues for several\r\nhours motionless. Indeed, so violent and painful is the operation,\r\nthat many of them die under it; and those which survive, are in such\r\na weakly condition for some time, that they neither take food, nor\r\nventure from their retreats. Immediately after this change, they have\r\nnot only the softness, but the timidity of a worm. Every animal of\r\nthe deep is then a powerful enemy, which they can neither escape nor\r\noppose; and this, in fact, is the time when the dog-fish, the cod,\r\nand the ray, devour them by thousands. But this state of weakness\r\ncontinues for a very short time; the animal, in less than two days, is\r\nseen to have the skin that covers its body almost as hard as before;\r\nits appetite appears to increase; and, strange to behold! the first\r\nobject, it is said, that tempts its gluttony, is its own stomach, which\r\nit was lately disengaged from. This it devours with great eagerness.\r\nIn about forty-eight hours, in proportion to the animal’s strength,\r\nthe new shell is perfectly formed, and as hard as that which was but\r\njust thrown aside. Previous to the time of moulting or changing their\r\nskin, a flat chalky stone is found on each side of the stomach; this\r\nis believed to form a store of earthy matter for the renewal of the\r\nshell. These stones, popularly known as _crabs’ eyes_, were long\r\nhighly esteemed for their medicinal properties, but in reality are not\r\nsuperior to so much chalk.\r\n\r\nWhen completely equipped in its new dress, the dimensions of the\r\nold shell being compared with those of the new, it will be found\r\nthe creature has increased in size nearly one-third, and it appears\r\nwonderful how the old shell could have contained it.\r\n\r\nMany of the cold-blooded animals have the power of reproducing a limb,\r\nor a portion of one, if by any accident it has been lost. This faculty\r\nof reproduction is possessed by the Crab in great perfection; but it\r\nhas also a surprising power in itself, voluntarily to break off its\r\nown legs and claws. It seems this takes place when any serious injury,\r\nby bruising, has happened to any of its members. After it has received\r\nthe hurt it bleeds, and gives signs of pain, by moving the wounded limb\r\nfrom side to side, but afterwards holds it quite still, in a direct and\r\nnatural position, without touching any part of its body or its other\r\nlegs with it. Then, on a sudden, with a gentle crack, the wounded part\r\nof the leg drops off at the next joint to the one injured; this appears\r\nto be more easily done with respect to the smaller legs, than in the\r\ncase of an injury occurring to those which bear the pincers.\r\n\r\nWhen the leg has dropped off, a mucus, or jelly, is discharged on\r\nthe remaining part of the joint next the body, which, as a natural\r\nstyptic, instantly stops the bleeding; this gradually hardens and grows\r\ncallous, becoming a new leg in miniature, which at every change of the\r\ncreature’s shell increases rapidly in size.\r\n\r\nCrabs are naturally very quarrelsome, and with their claws fight and\r\nkill each other; and if by chance any of their limbs should be so\r\nbruised, as to have taken away from the creature the power of breaking\r\noff its claws, the protecting jelly is not produced, and the animal\r\nbleeds to death. An experiment was made to give some idea of the\r\ntenacious disposition of this creature, by obliging a Crab, with one\r\nof its great claws, to lay hold of one of its smaller ones; the silly\r\ncreature did not distinguish that itself was the aggressor, but exerted\r\nits strength, and soon cracked the shell of its own small leg, which\r\nbled freely; but feeling itself wounded it succeeded in breaking off\r\nits limb in the usual manner,—still, however, holding fast for a\r\nlength of time the part of the wounded leg which had come away.\r\n\r\nThe curious shuffling walk of the Crab is well known, but it does not,\r\nas it is said, walk exactly backwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAND CRAB, (_Gecarcinus ruricola_.)\r\n\r\nAlthough nearly all the Crab tribe are inhabitants of the water, there\r\nis a species found in the West Indies, a native of the Bahama Islands,\r\nwhose habits are unlike those of the rest of its class, and highly\r\ncurious in themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAND CRAB, (_Gecarcinus ruricola_.)]\r\n\r\nLand Crabs do not, like most other crustaceous animals, live near\r\nsalt water, but take up their abode for the greatest part of the year\r\nin holes in the ground, hollow trunks of trees, and other places of\r\nthe same description, and inhabit the mountainous districts of the\r\nislands, many miles from the sea-shore; but, although they make these\r\nplaces their usual haunt, it is necessary for them, once a year,\r\nto repair to the sea, for the purpose of depositing their spawn.\r\nThey prepare for their annual migration about the month of April or\r\nMay, and, having mustered in immense numbers, the procession sets\r\nforward, with all the regularity of an army, under the guidance of an\r\nexperienced commander.\r\n\r\nTheir destination being the sea, they instinctively move in a direct\r\nline to the nearest coast; no obstacle which they can possibly\r\nsurmount will induce them to turn from their course; for if even a\r\nhouse stands in their way, they endeavour to scale its walls, in which\r\nthey sometimes succeed; and should a window remain open, they are not\r\nunlikely to direct their march over the bed of some heedless sleeper.\r\nIf, however, a large river crosses their track, they continue to follow\r\nits course without attempting to cross it.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that they are commonly divided into three battalions, of\r\nwhich the first consists of the strongest and boldest males, who, like\r\npioneers, march forward to clear the route. They are often obliged\r\nto halt for want of rain, and go into the most convenient encampment\r\ntill the weather changes. The main body consists of females, who never\r\nleave the mountains till the rain has set in for some time; they then\r\ndescend in regular order, formed into columns of the breadth of fifty\r\npaces, and three miles in length, and so close that they almost cover\r\nthe ground. Three or four days after this, the rear-guard follows, a\r\nstraggling undisciplined tribe, consisting of males and females, but\r\nneither so robust nor vigorous as the former parties. The night is\r\ntheir chief time of proceeding. When terrified, they march back in a\r\nconfused manner, holding up their nippers and clattering them loudly,\r\nto intimidate their enemies. Their general food consists of vegetables;\r\nbut if any of their companions should become maimed, and unable to\r\nproceed, they are greedily devoured by the rest.\r\n\r\nAfter a march of two, and sometimes three months, in this manner,\r\nthey arrive at their destined spot on the sea-coast; they immediately\r\nenter the water, and after the waves have washed over them several\r\ntimes, retire to holes in the rocks, and other hiding-places, where\r\nthey remain until the period of spawning. They then once more seek\r\nthe water, and, shaking off their eggs, leave them to the chance of\r\nbeing hatched, or devoured by tribes of hungry fish, who have already\r\nrepaired to the spot in countless shoals, in expectation of their\r\nannual treat. The eggs that escape are hatched under the sand; and,\r\nsoon after, millions at a time of the little Crabs are seen quitting\r\nthe shore, and slowly travelling up to the mountains. The old ones,\r\nhowever, are not so active to return: they have become so feeble and\r\nlean, that they can hardly crawl about. Most of them, therefore, are\r\nobliged to continue in the flat parts of the country till they recover;\r\nmaking holes in the earth, into which they creep, and cover themselves\r\nup with leaves and dirt; here they throw off their old shells, and\r\ncontinue almost without motion for about six days, during which time\r\nthey become so fat, as to be considered delicious food. In about six\r\nweeks, the new shell has become tolerably hard, and the creatures may\r\nbe seen slowly returning to their mountain-haunts. In some of the\r\nsugar-islands, it is said they form no inconsiderable portion of the\r\nfood of the negroes, who are extremely dexterous in their mode of\r\nseizing them, so as to avoid their nippers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HERMIT, OR SOLDIER CRAB,\r\n\r\n(_Pagurus bernhardus_.)\r\n\r\nThis singular species of Crab has obtained its name from its habit of\r\nremaining, as it were, secluded, in any empty shell, or hole of a rock,\r\nit may fancy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HERMIT CRAB, (_Pagurus bernhardus_.)]\r\n\r\nThe hinder part of its body, particularly the tail, being constantly\r\nsecure from injury, has its covering reduced to almost a membranous\r\nstate, while the tail, which assists the other species in swimming, is\r\nalmost obliterated; but in those which have chosen a shell for their\r\nhermitage, some hook-like appendages are observed, which enable them to\r\nmaintain a secure hold of their borrowed dwelling. When the body has\r\ngrown too large for the shell occupied by the animal, it is obliged to\r\nseek another of a larger size. The numerous combats they enter into\r\nwhen seeking a new dwelling, have caused this animal to receive the\r\nadditional name of the Soldier Crab.\r\n\r\n“The Soldier when about to seek a new habitation, is still seen,”\r\nsays an amusing writer, “in its own shell, which it appears to have\r\nconsiderably outgrown; for a part of the naked body is seen at the\r\nmouth of it, which the habitation is too small to hide. A shell,\r\ntherefore, is to be found, large enough to cover the whole body;\r\nand yet not so large as to be unmanageable and unwieldy. To answer\r\nboth these ends is no easy matter, nor the attainment of a slight\r\ninquiry. The little Soldier is seen busily parading the shore, along\r\nthat line of pebbles and shells that is formed by the extremest wave;\r\nstill, however, dragging its old incommodious habitation at its tail,\r\nunwilling to part with one shell, even though a troublesome appendage,\r\ntill it can find another more convenient. It is seen stopping at one\r\nshell, turning it and passing it by, going on to another, contemplating\r\nthat for a while, and then slipping its tail from its old habitation,\r\nto try on a new. This, also, is found to be inconvenient; and it\r\nquickly returns to its old shell again. In this manner, it frequently\r\nchanges, till at last it finds one light, roomy, and commodious: to\r\nthis it adheres, though the shell be sometimes so large as to hide the\r\nbody of the animal, claws and all.”\r\n\r\nYet it is not till after many trials, and many combats also, that the\r\nSoldier is thus completely equipped; for there is often a contest\r\nbetween two of them for some well-looking favourite shell, for which\r\nthey are rivals. They both endeavour to take possession; they strike\r\nwith their claws; they bite each other, till the weakest is obliged to\r\nyield, by giving up the object of dispute. It is then that the victor\r\ntakes possession, and parades in his new conquest three or four times\r\nback and forward, upon the strand, before his envious antagonist.\r\n\r\nWhen this animal is taken, it sends forth a feeble cry, endeavouring\r\nto seize the enemy with its nippers; which if it fasten upon, it will\r\nsooner die than quit the grasp. The wound is very painful, and not\r\neasily cured.\r\n\r\nOn the English coasts the Hermit Crab is generally found in the shell\r\nof the whelk, or when of a small size in that of the periwinkle; they\r\nnot unfrequently, however, remain in some cranny of a rock, or under\r\nthe protecting cover formed by a group of pebbles, in the interstices\r\nof which they hide themselves.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were well acquainted with the Soldier Crab, as is evident\r\nfrom the following translation of the lines of one of their poets:\r\n\r\n    The Soldier Crabs unarmed by nature, left\r\n    Helpless, and weak, grow strong by harmless theft.\r\n    Fearful they crawl, and look with panting wish\r\n    For the cast crust of some new-covered fish;\r\n    Or such as empty lie, and deck the shore,\r\n    Whose first and rightful owners are no more.\r\n    They make glad seizure of the vacant room,\r\n    And count the borrowed shell their native home;\r\n    Screw their soft limbs to fit the winding case,\r\n    And boldly herd with the crustaceous race.\r\n    But when they larger grow they fill the place,\r\n    And find themselves hard-pinched in scanty space,\r\n    Compelled, they quit the roof they loved before,\r\n    And busy search around the pebbly shore,\r\n    Till a commodious roomy seat be found,\r\n    Such as the larger shell-fish living owned.\r\n    Oft cruel wars contending soldiers wage,\r\n    And long for the disputed shell engage;\r\n    The strongest here the doubtful prize possess,\r\n    Power gives the right, and all the claim confess.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOBSTER, (_Astacus europæa_.)\r\n\r\nThe well-known and delicious shell-fish, the Lobster, is found in great\r\nabundance in all the northern parts of Europe. The north of Scotland\r\nis famous for the Lobster, but it is still more plentiful on the coast\r\nof Norway. The crab is more frequently found in shallow water, but the\r\nLobster prefers those spots where the water is of considerable depth.\r\nThe methods of taking Lobsters are various,—the most usual is by means\r\nof what are called Lobster-pots; these are a sort of trap, formed of\r\ntwigs, and baited with garbage; they are made like a wire mouse-trap,\r\nso that when the Lobsters get in there is no possibility of returning.\r\nThese pots are fastened to a cord, and sunk in the sea, their place\r\nbeing marked by a buoy. Another method of taking them is by means of a\r\nkind of bag-net, baited with animal substances. This fishery is only\r\ncarried on in the night. They are brought in vast quantities to the\r\nLondon market from the Orkneys and from the Norway coast.\r\n\r\nLobsters are much alarmed at the noise of thunder, or any other\r\nsudden shock; the consequence of which is, that in their fright, they\r\nfrequently cast their claws. This also often happens when the poor\r\ncreatures are thrown into the boiling-pot. As these animals frequent\r\nclear water, their habits have been more noticed than those of the\r\ncrab. Their mode of feeding is sufficiently curious. In general, the\r\npincers of one of the large claws are furnished with knobs, while\r\nthe other large claw is more like a saw on its edge; holding, then,\r\nits food in the knobbed claw, it dexterously pulls it to pieces with\r\nthe other. Their movements in the water are exceedingly graceful and\r\nlively, and they are capable of darting forward to a considerable\r\ndistance with the rapidity of the flight of a bird. Their colour, when\r\nin their native element, is not black as might be imagined, but a\r\nbeautiful deep blue.\r\n\r\nA whimsical idea of the horror Lobsters are said to have of pigs, seems\r\nto have prevailed in some parts of the Continent. It is said that in\r\nBrandenburgh, where the fishery is very abundant, the wagoners who\r\ntransport them by land are obliged to keep watch during the night, to\r\nprevent swine from passing the wagon, for if one only was to go by,\r\nthey say, not a single Lobster would be alive in the morning!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIVER CRAY-FISH, (_Potamobius fluviatilis_.)\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water Cray-fish very much resembles the lobster in\r\nappearance, but is considerably broader in its proportions. It is\r\ncommonly found in the tributary streams of large rivers, inhabiting the\r\nbanks, in which it burrows, and feeding on any animal substance that\r\nmay happen to come in its way.\r\n\r\nThe Cray-fish is taken in various ways, sometimes by the hand, which\r\nis thrust into the holes in which they burrow. Another method is thus\r\ndescribed:—\r\n\r\nProcure a dozen little rods, about five feet in length, and the\r\nthickness of the thumb,—split them at the smallest end, and by way\r\nof bait, place a frog, or a piece of putrid flesh in the cleft; take\r\nthen the rods by their thickest end, and hold the bait at the entrance\r\nof the little holes where you suspect your prey to be; if they are\r\nthere, they will generally come out to seize the bait. As soon as you\r\nperceive them, hold a small landing-net underneath, and raise the bait\r\nsuddenly, and the Cray-fish will either be brought up along with the\r\nbait, or will fall back into the net.\r\n\r\nAnother method noticed, consists in first burying a dead cat, or a\r\nhare, in a dunghill, for eight days, and then placing it in the midst\r\nof a bush of tangled thorns and brambles, which is thrown into the\r\nwater, in the place frequented by the Cray-fish. After it has remained\r\nthere a few hours it may be drawn up, when the shell-fish will be found\r\npartaking of their delicate fare, and the tangled bush will effectually\r\nprevent their escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHOSPHORESCENT SHRIMP.\r\n\r\nThe luminous appearance of the ocean at night is a fact well-known\r\nto all who have been a voyage by sea; and it has been ascertained,\r\nthat the causes of this beautiful phenomenon are the phosphorescent\r\nproperties which are possessed by many of the smaller inhabitants\r\nof the deep. Among these, the little animal, figured above, is very\r\nfrequently met with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOCTILUCA BANKSII magnified.\r\n\r\nThe line above shows the natural length.]\r\n\r\nThe light of this creature, which is very brilliant, appears to issue\r\nfrom every part of the body; but in another crustaceous animal, found\r\nby Captain Tuckey, in the Gulf of Guinea, the luminous property resided\r\nin the brain, which, when the animal was at rest, resembled a most\r\nbrilliant amethyst, about the size of a large pinhead; from this there\r\nstarted, when it moved, flashes of a brilliant silvery light.\r\n\r\nThe author we have lately quoted, says,—\r\n\r\n“Meditating upon this subject, I think it not improbable, that the\r\nDeity, who has done nothing in vain, and whose omniscience extends to\r\nevery epoch, foreseeing that man would invent the means of tempting the\r\ntrackless ocean, and explore the most distant regions of our planet,\r\nhas given it as one means of rendering his nights less gloomy, and\r\nof diminishing the number of his dangers; especially, if we consider\r\nthat this luminosity is seen only in the night-season,—is vivid in\r\nproportion to the darkness, disappearing even before the feeble light\r\nof the moon,—and also that it increases with the agitation of the sea,\r\nso that, during the prevalence of storms, it greatly diminishes the\r\ndense gloom which at such times is often impenetrable to the moon, and\r\nthe stars, throws such a light upon the ship and rigging as to enable\r\nsailors to execute their allotted tasks with certainty, and at all\r\ntimes points out to the cautious mariner the lurking danger of sunken\r\nrocks, shoals, and unknown coasts, by the phosphorescent, or snowy\r\nappearance which it gives to the breakers, so as to render them visible\r\nat a considerable distance.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OPOSSUM SHRIMP, (_Mysis chamæleon_.)\r\n\r\nThis small species of Shrimp, although it has much the same outward\r\nappearance as the common shrimp, except that it is considerably\r\nsmaller, is, when duly examined, one of the most singularly-formed\r\ncreatures of the class to which it belongs. It is found in tolerable\r\nabundance along the British coasts, but the northern seas literally\r\nswarm with them; there, in spite of their small size, they are destined\r\nto become the food of the stupendous whale, whose enormous mouth\r\nencloses myriads at a time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mysis chamæleon._]\r\n\r\nThe Opossum Shrimp belongs to a group of crustaceous animals which have\r\nbeen called fissipeds, (_split-feet_,) on account of each of their\r\nfeet being divided nearly throughout its whole length; the inner limb\r\nbeing constructed for progression and the seizing of their prey, and\r\nthe outer for swimming and giving that motion to the water which is\r\nessential to the organs of breathing, which are, as it were, wrapped\r\nround the base of each limb, and fully exposed to the action of the\r\nelement. In the other Crustacea, which they most nearly approach, such\r\nas shrimps, prawns, &c., there is a single row of five feet on each\r\nside: but the genus we are now describing possesses as many as four\r\nrows of feet, each containing eight, so that in all, the number of feet\r\namounts to as many as thirty-two,—sixteen adapted for swimming, and\r\nsixteen for seizing their prey. In consequence of this organization,\r\nthe Shrimps seek their food in the sands at the bottom, while the\r\npresent genus frequent the surface.\r\n\r\nThe most singular portion of their formation, and that to which they\r\nare indebted for a name, is a kind of pouch which the female possesses,\r\nfixed beneath the body, and formed of two concave pieces of shell; this\r\npouch, which is very capacious, considering the size of the animal, is\r\ndestined to receive the eggs, which are deposited in it, enveloped in\r\na kind of jelly-like substance, most probably forming the food of the\r\nyoung when first hatched. As fast as the young assume the lengthened\r\nform of the perfect animals, they are found to arrange themselves in\r\nthis pouch closely and regularly side by side, with their heads towards\r\nthe breast of the mother. After this manner they lie closely compacted\r\ntogether, and present a perfectly symmetrical arrangement, easily\r\nobserved from the translucency of the valves of the pouch, and the\r\nlarge size and blackness of their eyes. The males of the Opossum Shrimp\r\nare not so numerous as the females, and are without the singular pouch\r\nwe have described.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed the fact of these Shrimps being the food of the\r\nGreenland whale, in the northern seas, but in these climates they serve\r\nas food for herrings.\r\n\r\nIt is in looking closely into the structure of these little animals\r\nthat we see the perfection of the Divine Artist. Nature’s greater\r\nproductions appear coarse indeed to these elaborate and highly-finished\r\nmaster-pieces, and in using more and more powerful magnifiers we still\r\ncontinue to bring new parts and touches into view. If, for instance,\r\nafter observing one of their members with the naked eye, which has\r\ninformed us that the part we have been examining is composed but of one\r\npiece, we employ a magnifying glass with a low power, the same part\r\nappears jointed, or composed of several pieces articulated together.\r\nEmploying a higher magnifier, it appears fringed with long hairs,\r\nwhich, on further scrutiny, seem to be themselves fringed with hairs\r\nstill more minute; many of these minute parts also, are evidently\r\njointed, and perform sensible motions. But what idea can we form of the\r\nvarious muscles which put these parts in movement, of the nerves which\r\nactuate them, and the vessels which supply them with the nourishment\r\nnecessary for growth and support, and which we know, from comparison\r\nwith other creatures, they must possess!\r\n\r\nThe Opossum Shrimps, we have seen, are the prey of the larger\r\ninhabitants of the deep; but they, in their turn, destroy others that\r\nare smaller than themselves,—seizing upon every animal substance they\r\nare able to manage that comes within their reach, and, if placed in a\r\nvessel of sea-water by themselves, devouring each other.\r\n\r\nThe species represented in the engraving has been called the _Mysis\r\nchamæleon_, from its colour varying according to the substances on\r\nwhich it feeds, through all the gradations of gray, black, brown, and\r\npink.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORDER CRUSTACEA HETEROBRANCHIÆ._\r\n\r\n(_Crustacea with Organs of Breathing variously placed, never\r\nconcealed._)\r\n\r\nThe Crustacea which form this order differ much more from each other\r\nthan those which are arranged in the last order, and consequently we\r\nfind among them some very singular in their outward formation. Few of\r\nthe species appear to be used as food by mankind, but they constitute a\r\ngreat portion of the nourishment of fishes and other inhabitants of the\r\nwater. They are at times used by fishermen as bait. Many of them are\r\nvery minute, and form most excellent objects for the microscope. They\r\nhave been divided into several sections, according to their outward\r\nform; but as so little is known of their habits, we shall confine\r\nourselves to a description of some of the best known.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPOTTED SQUILL, (_Squilla maculata_.)\r\n\r\nThe Squill seems to form a connecting link between the last and present\r\norder. It is the only genus of the heterobranchial Crustacea in which\r\nthe eyes are placed on footstalks; the head, instead of being distinct,\r\nappears in a great measure drawn into the corslet. It has been called\r\nthe Sea Mantis, from its bearing some resemblance to an insect of that\r\nname, on account of the singularly-formed hooks with which two of its\r\nfoot-jaws are armed.\r\n\r\nThe species shown in the engraving is found in the Indian Seas; it is\r\nthe largest of the genus.\r\n\r\nThe shell with which these creatures are covered has very little\r\nconsistence, more resembling hardened skin than shell. They frequent\r\nthe sandy bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Squilla maculata._]\r\n\r\nThere is a small species which is found in fresh water, in which the\r\nyoung, after the eggs are hatched, remain for some time in shelter\r\nunder the plates with which the body of the mother is covered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON CLOPORTUS, (_Cloportus ascellus_.)\r\n\r\nThis animal is very common upon old walls and under stones. It is\r\nsomewhat like the wood-louse, but more flat; it is essentially a\r\ndweller on the land, but it cannot exist except in damp places, where\r\nthe moisture is sufficient to keep its branchiæ pliable; it belongs to\r\na group of small Crustacea known by the name _Oniscus_. Some, as we see\r\nin the present instance, frequent the land, but the greater portion\r\ninhabit the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cloportus ascellus._\r\n\r\n(Fig. 1, much magnified; fig. 2, natural size.)]\r\n\r\nAmong those which inhabit the latter element, there is a minute species\r\nwhich is very injurious to timber. It excavates a cylindrical hole for\r\nits dwelling, and increases in number so rapidly, that in a few years\r\ntimber which is covered with water is rendered useless. The temporary\r\nwood-work used during the time the Bell-Rock Lighthouse was in the\r\ncourse of erection, was destroyed, to a great extent, by this little\r\ncreature. When the wood had been under water for three years, beams ten\r\ninches square were reduced to seven inches; at the rate of one inch\r\na year. Another species, _Cymothoa_, attaches itself to the backs of\r\ndifferent species of fishes, living upon the juices of their body.\r\n\r\nA crustaceous animal nearly allied to this last is described in the\r\nfifth volume of the _American Philosophical Transactions_; it is\r\naccompanied by engravings which we have copied, but the animal is\r\nnot drawn with sufficient accuracy to be referable to any particular\r\nspecies; by this account it appears that, instead of attaching itself\r\nto the body of the fish, the parasite makes safe its lodgement on the\r\nroof of the mouth. The author thus describes it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Head of Alewife._\r\n\r\nPart of lower jaw removed to show the insect.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The insect seen from above.]\r\n\r\n“Among the fish that at this early season of the year (February) resort\r\nto the waters of York River, in Virginia, the Alewife, the Oldwife,\r\ncalled also the Bay Alewife, arrives in very considerable shoals, and\r\nin some seasons their number is almost incredible. They are fully of\r\nthe size of a large herring, and are principally distinguished from the\r\nherring by a bay or red spot, above the gill-fin. They are, when caught\r\nfrom March to May, full-roed and fat, and at least as good a fish for\r\nthe table as the herring.\r\n\r\n“In this season, each of these Alewifes carries in her mouth an insect\r\nabout two inches long, hanging with its back downwards, and firmly\r\nholding itself by its fourteen legs to the palate.\r\n\r\n“It is with difficulty it can be separated, and never, perhaps, without\r\ninjury to the jaws of the fish. The fishermen, therefore, consider\r\nthe insect as essential to the life of the fish; for when it is taken\r\nout, and the fish is again thrown into the water, he is incapable\r\nof swimming, and soon dies. I endeavoured in numerous instances to\r\npreserve both the insect and the fish from injury, but was always\r\nobliged, either to destroy the one or injure the other.\r\n\r\n“I have sometimes succeeded in taking out the insect in a brisk and\r\nlively state. As soon as he was set free from my grasp, he immediately\r\nscrambled nimbly back into the mouth of the fish and resumed his\r\nposition. In every instance he was disgustingly corpulent and\r\nunpleasant to handle, and it seemed that, whether he had obtained\r\nhis post by force or favour; whether he be a traveller or constant\r\nresident, or what else may be his business where he is found, he\r\ncertainly fares sumptuously every day.\r\n\r\n“The fish whose mouth he inhabits, comes about the same time with the\r\nshad into the rivers of Virginia from the ocean, and continues to\r\ntravel upwards from the beginning of March to the middle of May. As\r\nlong as they are caught on their passage up the river, they are found\r\nfat and fall of roe. Every fish which I saw had the Oniscus in his\r\nmouth, and I was assured, not only by the more ignorant fishermen, but\r\nby a very intelligent man who came down now and then to divert himself\r\nwith fishing, that in forty years’ observation he had never seen a Bay\r\nAlewife without the louse.”\r\n\r\nThe Oniscus itself, as the author states, is not without its enemies,\r\nmany of them being caught with two or three leeches attached to their\r\nbody, and adhering so closely that their removal cost them their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOLUCCA CRAB, (_Polyphemus gigas_.)\r\n\r\nWhy the singular creature here represented should have the name\r\nPolyphemus given to it, is hard to guess. Polyphemus, as every\r\nschoolboy knows, was the fabled giant overcome by Ulysses, who is\r\nrepresented as having one eye in the centre of his forehead; whereas,\r\nthis creature has two eyes and one horn. It is interesting from its\r\nbeing so nearly allied to many very minute species.\r\n\r\nThe Polyphemus sometimes reaches the length of two feet; there are but\r\ntwo species, which only differ from each other in the shape of their\r\nbuckler. That we have represented is found in the Indian Ocean, and has\r\nbeen called the Molucca Crab.\r\n\r\nThe tail, or rather the horn, of the Polyphemus, is greatly dreaded by\r\nthe fishermen, from the idea that its wound is venomous. The natives\r\nemploy it to point their arrows, and as they are in the habit of\r\npoisoning the points of these weapons, it is most likely from this\r\ncircumstance that the idea we have noticed originated, for there is no\r\nother ground for the belief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Polyphemus gigas._]\r\n\r\nDuring the night-time they lie half out of the water, and are then very\r\neasily taken, as they appear to take but little notice of anything\r\nuntil their danger becomes imminent.\r\n\r\nIt is but a small portion of their flesh that is considered good for\r\nfood, but the eggs, which are very numerous, are reckoned a delicacy.\r\n\r\nThese Crabs are in the habit of leaving the water and walking to a\r\nconsiderable distance over the wet sands,—but if incommoded by the\r\nsun, they hurry back as fast as they are able to their native element.\r\nWhen walking, none of their legs are visible. Most authors say that, if\r\nthis Crab is laid on its back, it must inevitably perish, unless the\r\nwaters return in time, but one observer asserts that it has the power\r\nof righting itself with the assistance of its tail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRAB-LIKE LIMULUS, (_Limulus cancriformis_.)\r\n\r\nThe Limuli are found in deep ditches of fresh water, marshes, &c.; they\r\nare frequently met with congregated together in great numbers; their\r\nprincipal food in the Spring appears to be tadpoles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Limulus cancriformis._ (Natural size.)]\r\n\r\n“This genus,” says Lamarck, “is almost isolated among the group in\r\nwhich it is placed. Its body is covered with a great horny buckler,\r\nvery thin, and made of a single piece, of a roundish oval form. The\r\nhead is confounded with the trunk, and the antennæ are very short. They\r\npossess three eyes, two in front, and one, very small, further back.\r\nTheir legs are very numerous,—the two in front, much the largest,\r\nspread out in the form of oars, and furnished at their extremity with\r\nsilky articulated bristles.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER FLEA, (_Cyclops quadricornis_.)\r\n\r\nThere are as many as twelve known species of the Water Flea. That\r\nrepresented in the engraving is extremely common, and forms a most\r\ninteresting object for the microscope. We have availed ourselves of Mr.\r\nPritchard’s popular description of this curious creature.\r\n\r\n“The Author of Nature, to whom all things are alike easy of execution,\r\nas if intending to teach man a lesson of humility, and that no part of\r\ncreation, however minute, is beneath his consideration, has conferred\r\non these animals, that are barely perceptible to our unassisted vision,\r\nmore elegance and variety of form, more richness in their colouring,\r\nand more beauty and exquisite finishing, than on the whale or the\r\nelephant, which mainly excite our admiration, by the magnitude of the\r\nmass of living matter they present to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cyclops quadricornis._\r\n\r\n(Fig. 1, highly magnified; fig. 2, natural size.)]\r\n\r\n“These little crustaceous animals may be found at all seasons of the\r\nyear, near the surface of the water; they are, however, most abundant\r\nin July and August. I have collected great numbers of them on a warm\r\nday in the latter month, with a small cloth net, immersing it about an\r\ninch below the surface. They are mostly colourless in ponds covered\r\nwith herbage, but in small collections of rain water, on a loamy soil,\r\nare of a fine rich colour.\r\n\r\n“The body of this creature is covered with crustaceous or shelly\r\nplates, which overlap each other, and admit both of a lateral and\r\nvertical motion between them. Their ends do not meet on the side, but\r\nhave sufficient space between them for the insertion and play of the\r\norgans of respiration. The rostrum, or beak, is short and pointed: it\r\nis a prolongation of the first segment which forms the head. A little\r\nabove the beak, a single eye is imbedded beneath the shell, of a dark\r\ncrimson colour, nearly approaching to blackness. The true form of this\r\norgan it is difficult to determine. Mr. Baker gives it the shape of two\r\nkidney-beans placed parallel to each other, and united at their lowest\r\nextremities. When viewed laterally, it appears round, while in some\r\nother positions it is square.”\r\n\r\nThe eggs are curiously placed in two bags, presenting an appearance\r\nsimilar to clusters of grapes, and of considerable magnitude, compared\r\nwith the size of the animal. These egg-bags are seen in the engraving,\r\n(which represents a female,) projecting from each side of the hinder\r\nportion of the shell. The centre of each egg is of a deep opaque\r\ncolour, which in some specimens is green, in others red.\r\n\r\nThe young of the Cyclops, when first excluded from the egg, are\r\nextremely minute, and so different from the mother, that Müller has\r\ndescribed them as forming two distinct genera.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SMALL WATER FLEA, (_Cyclops minutus_.)\r\n\r\nThis species of the Water Flea differs from the last, in having its\r\nbody divided into a greater number of segments; it is also much\r\nsmaller; it is equally active with that last described, but its form\r\nrenders it more graceful in its motions. “These little creatures,” says\r\nMr. Pritchard, “seem to possess great discernment and cunning; for, if\r\napproached, they remain motionless on the plant on which they reside,\r\nin the apparent hope that they may be overlooked; but when a fit\r\nopportunity occurs, they suddenly bend the body, and spring away with a\r\nkind of vaulting leap.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cyclops minutus_, much magnified.]\r\n\r\nThey inhabit the various species of confervæ, and may often be met\r\nwith in great numbers on the stalks and underside of healthy duckweed,\r\ngrowing on the surface of the water. They are most numerous in April\r\nand May, and disappear as the heat of the season increases. They will\r\nnot live in stagnant water containing much decomposed vegetation, and\r\nrequire, therefore, to be kept for observation in a large vessel of\r\nclean water. They are easily caught after a shower of rain, on the\r\nunder surface of the duckweed, by taking out a little with a basin or\r\ncloth net. When found, they appear busily engaged in search of prey,\r\nmoving about with great activity, and examining every portion of the\r\nplant in the most scrutinizing manner. In this pursuit the body is not\r\nbent as in the magnified representation in the engraving, but is kept\r\nin a straight crawling position. Their natural length is about the\r\nthree hundredth part of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe female of the last species has two outward receptacles for the\r\neggs; in this there is but one, and that is placed on the under part of\r\nthe animal near the tail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAIRY CYPRIS, (_Cypris pubera_.)\r\n\r\nThese singular little creatures are found in stagnant fresh water: they\r\nare very small, and, at first sight, appear like a bivalve shell. The\r\nanimal which is enclosed in this two-valved case, opens and shuts it\r\nat will; when it does this, it throws out from one end of the shell\r\nnumerous whitish hair-like members; it is by moving these that it is\r\nenabled to swim with considerable celerity, and it never stops until\r\nit meets with some object on which it can rest. Its two antennæ, which\r\nissue from the fore part of the shell, are long, very flexible, and\r\nbent backwards; their articulations are numerous, which gives them\r\ngreat freedom of motion. The movements of these antennæ contribute\r\nmaterially to the swimming powers of the creature.\r\n\r\nAt the place where the head is united to the body, a small black point\r\nis seen,—this is the eye of the animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cypris pubera._\r\n\r\n(Fig. 1, highly magnified; fig. 2, natural size.)]\r\n\r\nThe Cypris changes its shell like the rest of the Crustacea; it is\r\nfound in marshes where vegetable substances are growing. Sometimes they\r\nare so numerous, that the water appears covered with them; they are\r\nmore usually found in Spring and Autumn than at any other part of the\r\nyear; from this it is inferred that there are two broods in the course\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nThe drying up of marshes during the Summer heats, destroys immense\r\nnumbers every season. It appears, however, from observation, that in\r\nthis case, some of these tiny creatures manage to bury themselves in\r\nthe mud, where they hermetically close their shells, and remain in a\r\nkind of dormant state, until rain or other causes have again filled the\r\nmarshes with water.\r\n\r\nA species nearly allied to this, the _Artemia Salina_, the Lymington\r\nshrimp, or brine-worm, is able to live in the brine of the salt-pans,\r\nwhich is so strongly impregnated with salt, as to destroy any other\r\nCrustaceous animal.\r\n\r\nMyriads of these animalculæ are to be found in the salterns at\r\nLymington, in the open tanks or reservoirs, where the brine is\r\ndeposited previous to boiling. A pint of this brine contains about a\r\nquarter of a pound of salt. These tanks are called clearers, as the\r\nliquor becomes clear in them, an effect which the workmen attribute,\r\nin some degree, to the rapid and continual motion of the brine-worm,\r\nor the particles which cloud the liquor serving for its food; but this\r\nis mere conjecture. So strongly persuaded, however, are the workmen of\r\nthis fact, that they are accustomed to transport a few of the worms\r\nfrom another saltern if they do not appear at their own. They increase\r\nastonishingly in the course of a few days.\r\n\r\nIt is observable that the brine-worm is never seen in the sun-pans,\r\nwhere the brine is made by the admission of sea-water during the\r\nSummer, and which are emptied every fortnight; but only in the pits and\r\nreservoirs, where it is deposited after it is taken out of the pans,\r\nand where some of the liquor constantly remains, when it becomes much\r\ndiluted with rain water. From October till May, (during which time the\r\nmanufacture is at a stand,) a few only of the worms are visible; but at\r\nthe approach of Summer, young ones appear in great numbers.\r\n\r\n                         THE END.\r\n\r\n                           LONDON:\r\n              JOHN W.

New Edition, with many Cuts. 2_s._\r\n\r\n      The principles of this beautiful and important science are\r\n      explained in a clear and simple manner, so as to render\r\n      the acquisition of them comparatively easy. The book is\r\n      illustrated by numerous cuts of the different parts of\r\n      plants, &c., and the examples, when possible, are selected\r\n      from our own wild flowers, or from those cultivated in all\r\n      gardens or fields, and they are cited by their familiar\r\n      names. A Glossary of most of the terms usually employed\r\n      is subjoined, and an alphabetical List of the most useful\r\n      Plants, with their botanical names, &c.\r\n\r\n  * MANUAL of INSTRUCTION in VOCAL MUSIC, chiefly with a\r\n        view to Psalmody. By JOHN TURNER, Esq. 4_s._\r\n\r\n      The author offers this work not as an experiment now\r\n      for the first time to be tried, but as the result of\r\n      long experience. Though chiefly designed for the use of\r\n      children collected in large numbers, it may, with equal\r\n      advantage, be adopted in smaller assemblages, and in the\r\n      domestic circle: and may also be rendered serviceable to\r\n      adults.\r\n\r\n  EASY LESSONS IN MECHANICS; with Familiar Illustrations,\r\n        showing the practical Application of the various\r\n        Mechanical Principles. 3_s._\r\n\r\n  * ON the EDUCATION and TREATMENT of CHILDREN. 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n      CONTENTS:—On the means of developing the Bodily\r\n      Senses in Infancy; Early Development of the Affections;\r\n      Early Cultivation of the Intellect; Management in\r\n      Childhood; Amusements and Employments; Sunday; Views\r\n      of Death; Supernatural Appearances; Politeness; Dress;\r\n      Gentility; Management during the Teens; Views of Matrimony.\r\n\r\n  * INSTRUCTIONS for TEACHING ARITHMETIC to LITTLE CHILDREN.\r\n        By the Rev. T. V. SHORT, B.D. 6_d._\r\n\r\n  * A LITTLE READING BOOK for YOUNG CHILDREN. With many Cuts. 4_d._\r\n\r\n  SCRIPTURE HYMNS IN PROSE. With Cuts. 6_d._\r\n\r\n      The experience of some persons inclines them to prefer\r\n      compositions in prose, to those in verse, for the exercise\r\n      of the infant memory. There is at least no disadvantage in\r\n      having a choice of both.\r\n\r\n  * A COLLIERY TALE, or VILLAGE DISTRESS. 4_d._\r\n\r\n      The object of this little narrative is, by God’s help, to\r\n      draw some profit from a recent calamity, which, in its\r\n      immediate pressure upon the limited community through\r\n      which it extended, has been most awfully severe.\r\n\r\n  * VILLAGE ANNALS; or, the Story of HETTY JONES. 9_d._\r\n\r\n      I have written this story in the simplest style, for the\r\n      use of the children in my own neighbourhood; as in all the\r\n      little publications of this kind I have hitherto met with,\r\n      the language and ideas are far above the comprehension of\r\n      many of the classes for whom they are designed.\r\n                                                      C. B.\r\n\r\n  PRETTY LESSONS for GOOD CHILDREN; to which are added, EASY\r\n        LESSONS in LATIN. 2_s._\r\n\r\n      The design of this little work is, by means of easy\r\n      rhymes, to attract the attention of young children, and to\r\n      impress upon their memories various elementary facts and\r\n      moral sentiments which they would not otherwise remember;\r\n      for, “What will a child learn sooner than a song?”\r\n\r\n  EASY POETRY FOR CHILDREN. 1_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  SIMPLE STORIES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. By a LADY. With Cuts. 1_s._\r\n\r\n  THE CHILD’S VERSE-BOOK OF DEVOTION. With Cuts. 1_s._\r\n\r\n  SONGS for CHILDREN. With ENGRAVINGS. 4_d._\r\n\r\n    In this little book you’ll find,\r\n    Lessons for the infant mind;\r\n    Truth conveyed in easy verse,\r\n    Which the nursling may rehearse,\r\n    And thus be led, by simple lays,\r\n    To walk with God, and sing his praise.\r\n\r\n  READING LESSONS from the Books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes;\r\n        with Questions and Answers upon them. 4_d._\r\n\r\n  DAILY READINGS from the PSALMS. 6_d._\r\n\r\n  FAMILIAR LECTURES to CHILDREN; in which the IMPORTANT TRUTHS\r\n        of the GOSPEL are engagingly set forth.

An ADDRESS from a CLERGYMAN to his PARISHIONERS. 2_d._\r\n\r\n  A FEW WORDS ON THE SIN OF LYING. By A LAYMAN. 3_d._\r\n\r\n  * EASY LESSONS on MONEY MATTERS, for the Use of Young\r\n        People. 1_s._\r\n\r\n      In this little book, care has been taken to convey\r\n      elementary knowledge in such simple language, that, it\r\n      is hoped, these LESSONS will be found easily\r\n      intelligible even to such as have but the ordinary\r\n      advantages in point of education; and there are few\r\n      subjects on which it is, for all classes of people, more\r\n      important to inculcate correct principles, and to guard\r\n      against specious fallacies.\r\n\r\n  * PERSIAN STORIES; illustrative of EASTERN MANNERS and CUSTOMS. 1_s._\r\n\r\n        And,\r\n\r\n  * PERSIAN FABLES, for Young and Old.

A Book for Children. 1_s._\r\n\r\n      We may learn many useful lessons from the History of\r\n      Insects; and, by observing their habits, we shall find\r\n      that they set us an example of various good qualities.\r\n\r\n      * The BOOK of ANIMALS.    * The BOOK of FISHES.\r\n      * The BOOK of BIRDS.      * The BOOK of REPTILES.\r\n      * The BOOK of SHELLS.

Edited and Abridged by MARIN DE LA VOYE,\r\n        French Master in the East India College, at Addiscombe.\r\n\r\n      While the necessity of introducing the best standard\r\n      French works into our schools and families is universally\r\n      acknowledged, serious doubts are entertained as to the\r\n      propriety of placing the writings of some among the\r\n      French authors in the hands of Christian youth. In order\r\n      to remove all difficulties on this subject, the Editor\r\n      has been induced to undertake a careful Abridgment of\r\n      such works as are in most general use; and he has made\r\n      it his object to extract from the original every word\r\n      and sentence relating either to religion, politics, or\r\n      philosophical speculation, respecting which Christian\r\n      parents or teachers can have the least difference of\r\n      opinion.\r\n\r\n      A purified text of the best French Classical Works is,\r\n      therefore, now offered for the use of young persons of\r\n      both sexes, in a state which, it is trusted, will be found\r\n      altogether unobjectionable.\r\n\r\n   TELEMAQUE.        2_s._ 6_d._  PIERRE LE GRAND.      2_s._\r\n   VOYAGES DE CYRUS. 2_s._        CHARLES XII.          2_s._\r\n   BELISAIRE.        1_s._ 6_d._  GIL BLAS DESANTILLANE. _In the Press._\r\n\r\n           Six Volumes, at 2_s._ each, with Wood-Cuts,\r\n\r\n                           * THE INSTRUCTOR;\r\n\r\n                                  OR,\r\n               PROGRESSIVE LESSONS IN GENERAL KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\n                              A SERIES OF\r\n               ELEMENTARY BOOKS, ESPECIALLY ADAPTED FOR\r\n                         SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES.\r\n\r\n      Under the general title of THE INSTRUCTOR, is\r\n      comprised a series of little books, by means of which children\r\n      may be led through a progressive course of Exercises in various\r\n      branches of Elementary Knowledge. These books may be put\r\n      into the hands of such children as can readily spell common\r\n      words, and read easy lessons.—The object of the work is not\r\n      only to furnish reading lessons, but also to carry the pupil\r\n      _forward_,—to impart _information_, and exercise\r\n      the mind.\r\n\r\n        The first Six Volumes, in Thirty-six Numbers, contain the\r\n      following subjects, with numerous Engravings:\r\n\r\n                   VOLUME I.
