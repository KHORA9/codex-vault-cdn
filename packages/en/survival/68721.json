The literature\r\nupon this subject is voluminous, but much of it is inaccessible and\r\nfar from satisfactory. No attempt will here be made to collate this\r\nliterature or to give a history of the construction of earth dams,\r\nhowever interesting such an account might be. The object will rather\r\nbe to present such a study as will make clear the application of the\r\nprinciples underlying the proper design and erection of this class\r\nof structures. In no way, therefore, will it assume the character or\r\ndignity of a technical treatise.\r\n\r\nDams forming storage reservoirs, which are intended to impound large\r\nvolumes of water, must necessarily be built of considerable height,\r\nexcept in a very few instances where favorable sites may exist. Recent\r\ndiscussions would indicate that a new interest has been awakened in\r\nthe construction of high earth dams. As related to the general subject\r\nof storage, it is with the high structure rather than the low that\r\nthis study has to do. To the extent that “the greater includes the\r\nless,” the principles here presented are applicable to works of minor\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nMany persons who should know better place little importance upon\r\nthe skill required for the construction of earthwork embankments,\r\nconsidering the work to involve no scientific problems. It is far\r\ntoo common belief that any ordinary laborer, who may be able to use\r\nskillfully a scraper on a country road, is fitted to superintend\r\nthe construction of an earth dam. It has been said that the art of\r\nconstructing earth dams is purely empirical, that exact science\r\nfurnishes no approved method of determining their internal stresses,\r\nand that in regard to their design experience is much more valuable\r\nthan theory. When the question of stability is fully taken into\r\nconsideration, it certainly requires a large amount of skill\r\nsuccessfully to carry out works of this character.\r\n\r\nExtreme care in the selection of the site, sound judgment in the\r\nchoice of materials and assiduity in superintending the work while in\r\nprogress, are all vitally essential.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification of Dams.\r\n\r\nDams may be classified according to their purpose as diverting dams or\r\nweirs and as storage dams. The former may be located upon any portion\r\nof a stream where the conditions are favorable, and the water used for\r\nmanifold purposes, being conveyed by means of canals, flumes, tunnels\r\nand pipe-lines to places of intended use. These dams are generally low\r\nand may be either of a temporary or permanent character, depending upon\r\nthe uses to which the water is put. Temporary dams are made of brush,\r\nlogs, sand bags, gravel and loose rock. The more permanent structures\r\nare built of stone and concrete masonry.\r\n\r\nStorage dams may be classified according to the kind of material\r\nentering into their structure, as follows: (1) Earth; (2) Earth and\r\nTimber; (3) Earth and Rock-fill; (4) Rock-fill; (5) Masonry; (6)\r\nComposite Structures.\r\n\r\nLow dams forming service reservoirs for domestic water supplies and\r\nfor irrigation comprise by far the most numerous class. They are not\r\ndesigned to impound a large volume of water and therefore may be built\r\nacross a small ravine or depression, or even upon the summit of a hill,\r\nby excavating the reservoir basin and using the material excavated to\r\nform the embankment. These reservoirs may be used in connection with\r\nsurface or gravity systems, artesian wells, or underground supplies\r\nobtained by pumping. The dams forming these reservoirs being of\r\nmoderate size and height may vary greatly in shape and dimensions.\r\nThe form may be made to suit the configuration of the dam site. When\r\nthe earthwork requires it, they may be lined with various materials\r\nto secure water-tightness. Often such dams are made composite in\r\ncharacter, partly of earth and partly of masonry or some other\r\nmaterial. They are also frequently accompanied by numerous accessories,\r\nsuch as settling-basins, aerating devices and covers, which present a\r\ndiversity in form and appearance. A presentation of the different types\r\nof dams thus employed, with a discussion of the questions pertaining\r\nto utility in design and economy in construction, would be exceedingly\r\nvaluable and of general interest. Service reservoirs will receive only\r\na passing notice, with the hope expressed that some competent authority\r\nwill discuss them in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary Studies and Investigations._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preliminary studies and investigations which should be made prior\r\nto the construction of any dam for the storage of water have to do with\r\n(1) the Catchment Area, (2) the Reservoir basin, and (3) the Dam site.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatchment Area.\r\n\r\nIt is thought desirable to define a number of terms as we proceed,\r\nfor the purpose of correcting erroneous usage and for a clearer\r\nunderstanding of the subject. The catchment area of a reservoir is that\r\nportion of the country naturally draining into it. The watershed is\r\nthe boundary of the catchment area and may be correctly defined as the\r\ndivide between adjacent drainage systems. In regard to the catchment\r\narea it is necessary to determine:\r\n\r\n    1. Its extent and area in square miles.\r\n\r\n    2. Its topography or the character of its surface.\r\n\r\n    3. Its hydrography or precipitation and run-off.\r\n\r\n    4. Its geology, or the character of its soils and subsoils,\r\n       and the nature and dip of its rock strata.\r\n\r\n    5. Its flora, or the extent to which it is clothed with forest\r\n       trees or other vegetation.\r\n\r\nAll of these elements affect the volumes of maximum run-off, which is\r\nthe one important factor in the construction of earth dams that must\r\nnot be underestimated.\r\n\r\nIf the proposed dam or reservoir is to be located upon a main drainage\r\nline; that is, upon a river or stream, it is necessary to know both the\r\nflood and low-water discharge of the stream. Frequently no reliable\r\ndata on this subject are available, and the engineer must then make\r\nsuch a study of the whole situation as will enable him to estimate the\r\nminimum and maximum flow with considerable accuracy.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous factors entering into the solution of this first\r\nproblem, such as the shape and length of the catchment area, its\r\ngeneral elevation, the character of its surface, whether mountainous,\r\nhilly or flat, barren or timbered.\r\n\r\nGood topographic maps, if available, furnish valuable data on these\r\nsubjects and it is to be regretted that only a comparatively small\r\nportion of the United States has been thus mapped in detail.\r\n\r\nThe results of stream measurements, if any have been made in the\r\ncatchment basin, are especially important: These are usually few in\r\nthe high areas, on account of their inaccessibility. The year 1902\r\nmarked a notable beginning of such measurements in California. In many\r\nparts of the arid region of the United States, the best storage-sites\r\nare situated in the upper or higher portions of the drainage systems.\r\nThis is especially true of the streams on the Pacific Slope having\r\ntheir source in the High Sierras. As regulators of stream-flow and for\r\npower purposes such storage is peculiarly valuable, while storage for\r\nirrigation and domestic uses may be located nearer the valleys and the\r\ncenters of population.\r\n\r\nFrequently the engineer is required to build his dam where no such\r\ndata are available. In such instances he should endeavor to secure\r\nthe establishment of rain gauges and make measurements of the flow of\r\nthe main stream and its principal tributaries at various places to\r\nobtain the desired information. Even this may not suffice, owing to the\r\nlimited time at his disposal, and he must resort to the use of certain\r\nempirical rules or formulas, and make such comparisons and deductions\r\nfrom known conditions and results as will best answer his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe engineer should know, approximately at least, the normal yield of\r\nthe catchment area, the duration of the minimum and maximum seasonal\r\nflow, and the floods he may have to provide against during the\r\nconstruction of his dam. These data are absolutely necessary to enable\r\nhim to provide ample wasteways for his reservoirs. Many of the failures\r\nof earth dams have been the result of over-topping the embankment,\r\nwhich would have been averted by an ample wasteway. The most notable\r\nexample of this kind in recent years was that of the South Fork Dam, at\r\nConemaugh, Pennsylvania, in 1889, resulting in what is generally known\r\nas the “Johnstown Disaster.”\r\n\r\nThere are several empirical rules and formulas for calculating the run\r\noff from catchment areas and for determining the size of spillways\r\nnecessary to discharge this flow with safety to the dam. The proper\r\nformula to apply in any given case, with the varying coefficients\r\nof each, involves a thorough knowledge on the part of the designing\r\nengineer of the principles upon which the different factors are based.\r\n\r\nIt is unwise and often hazardous to make use of any important hydraulic\r\nformula without knowing the history of its derivation. Experiments\r\nare not always properly conducted, and often the deductions therefrom\r\nare unreliable. A presentation and discussion of these formulas would\r\nrequire more space than can be given in this study, and the technical\r\nreader must therefore consult for himself, as occasion may require, the\r\nvarious authorities cited. Formulas for the discharge or run-off from\r\ncatchment areas, as determined by Messrs. Craig, Dickens, Ryves and\r\nothers, are given by most writers on the subject of hydraulics.\r\n\r\n\r\nReservoir Basin.\r\n\r\nThe next subject of inquiry relates to the reservoir basin. It is\r\nnecessary that its area and capacity at different depths should be\r\ndefinitely known, and this information can only be obtained by having\r\nthe basin surveyed and contoured. A map should be made showing contours\r\nat intervals of 2 to 10 ft., depending upon the size of the basin and\r\nthe use to which the reservoir is to be put. Reservoir basins have been\r\nclassified according to their location as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. Natural lakes.\r\n\r\n    2. Natural depressions on main drainage lines.\r\n\r\n    3. Natural depressions on lateral drainage lines.\r\n\r\n    4. Arbitrary and artificially constructed basins.\r\n\r\nNatural lakes may need to be investigated more or less thoroughly to\r\ndetermine the character of their waters, whether saline, alkaline\r\nor fresh. It may also be necessary to know their normal depth and\r\ncapacity, and to make a study of their outlet if they have one. In some\r\ninstances the storage capacity of a lake may be enormously increased by\r\nmeans of a comparatively low and inexpensive embankment.\r\n\r\nThe area of reservoir basin, mean depth, temperature of the water,\r\nexposure of wind and sunshine, losses by seepage and evaporation, all\r\nhave a bearing upon the available water supply and influence the design\r\nof the dam and accessories to the reservoir.\r\n\r\nIn determining the character and suitability of materials for\r\nconstructing a dam it is necessary to make a careful study of the\r\nsoil and geological formation. This is best accomplished by digging\r\nnumerous test pits over the basin, especially in the vicinity of the\r\nproposed dam site; borings alone should never be relied upon for this\r\ninformation. For such an investigation the advisability of borrowing\r\nmaterial for dam construction from the reservoir basin is determined.\r\nThe porous character of the subsoil strata, or the dip and nature of\r\nthe bed rock, may forbid the removal of material from the floor of the\r\nbasin, even at a remote distance from the dam site.\r\n\r\nThe area to be flooded should be cleared and grubbed more or less\r\nthoroughly, depending again upon the use for which the water is\r\nimpounded. In no instance should timber be left standing below the\r\nhigh-water level of the reservoir; and all rubbish liable to float and\r\nobstruct the outlet tunnel and spillway during a time of flood should\r\nbe removed.\r\n\r\nThe accessories to a reservoir, to which reference has been made, may\r\nbe enumerated as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. Outlet pipes or tunnel.\r\n\r\n    2. Gate tower, screens and controlling devices.\r\n\r\n    3. Sluiceways for silt or sand.\r\n\r\n    4. Wasteway channel or weir.\r\n\r\n    5. Cover, settling basin, aerating devices, etc.\r\n\r\nSome of these are necessary and common to all classes of reservoirs,\r\nwhile others are employed only in special cases, as for domestic water\r\nsupplies. All reservoirs formed by earth embankments must have at least\r\ntwo of these, namely a wasteway, which is its safety valve, and outlet\r\npipes or outlet tunnel.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated that the proper location and construction of the\r\noutlet for a reservoir are of vital importance, since either to\r\nimproper location or faulty construction may be traced most of the\r\nfailures of the past. It is almost impossible to prevent water under\r\nhigh pressure from following along pipes and culverts when placed in an\r\nearth dam. The pipes and culverts frequently leak, and failure ensues.\r\nFailure may result from one or more of the following causes:\r\n\r\n    1. By improper design and placement of the puddle around the pipes.\r\n\r\n    2. By resting the pipes upon piers of masonry without continuous\r\n       longitudinal support.\r\n\r\n    3. By reason of subsidence in the cuts of the embankments and\r\n       at the core walls, due to the great weight at these points.\r\n\r\n    4. Leakage due to inherent defects, frost, deterioration, etc.\r\n\r\nMr. Beardsmore, the eminent English engineer who built the Dale Dyke\r\nembankment at Sheffield which failed in 1864, and who was afterwards\r\nrequested to study and report upon the great reservoirs in Yorkshire\r\nand Lancashire, said, after examination and careful study of reservoir\r\nembankment construction, that “in his opinion there were no conditions\r\nrequiring that a culvert or pipes should be carried through any portion\r\nof the made bank.” The writer would go even further and say that the\r\nonly admissible outlet for a storage reservoir formed by a high earth\r\ndam is some form of tunnel through the natural formation at a safe\r\ndistance from the embankment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDam Site.\r\n\r\nThe third preliminary study (that relating to the dam site itself) will\r\nbe considered under three heads:\r\n\r\n    1. Location.\r\n\r\n    2. Physical features, materials, etc.\r\n\r\n    3. Foundation.\r\n\r\nLOCATION.–The location for a dam is generally determined by the use\r\nwhich is to be made of it, or by the natural advantages for storage\r\nwhich it may possess. If it be for water power it is very frequently\r\nlocated upon the main stream at the point of greatest declivity. If for\r\nstorage it may be, as we have seen, at the head of a river system, on\r\none of its tributaries, or in a valley lower down.\r\n\r\nThe type of dam which should be built at any particular locality\r\ninvolves a thorough knowledge, not alone of the catchment area and\r\nreservoir basin, but also accurate information regarding the geology of\r\nthe dam site itself. It would be very unwise to decide definitely upon\r\nany particular type of dam without first obtaining such information.\r\nToo frequently has this been done, causing great trouble and expense,\r\nif not resulting in a total failure of the dam.\r\n\r\nThe conditions favorable for an earth dam are usually unfavorable for a\r\nmasonry structure, and vice versa. Again, there may be local conditions\r\nrequiring some entirely different type.\r\n\r\nDams situated upon the main drainage lines of large catchment areas are\r\nusually built of stone or concrete masonry, and designed with large\r\nsluiceways and spillways for the discharge both of silt and flood\r\nwaters. It need scarcely be remarked that, as a rule, such sites are\r\nwholly unsuited to earthwork construction. It is said, however, that\r\n“every rule has at least one exception,” and this may be true of those\r\nrelating to dam sites, as will appear later under the head of new\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, the location of high earth dams is governed by the\r\nconfiguration of the ground forming the storage basin. It may not be\r\npossible, however, to decide upon the best available site without\r\ncareful preliminary surveys and examinations of the geological\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nAll earth dams must be provided with a wasteway, ample to discharge the\r\nmaximum flood tributary to the reservoir. Whatever type of wasteway be\r\nadopted, no reliance should ever be put upon the outlet pipes for this\r\npurpose. The outlet should only figure as a factor of safety for the\r\nwasteway, insuring, as it were, the accuracy of the estimated flood\r\ndischarge. The safety of the dam demands that ample provision be made\r\nfor a volume of water in excess of normal flood discharge. This most\r\nnecessary adjunct of earth dams may be an open channel, cut through\r\nthe rim of the reservoir basin, discharging into a side ravine which\r\nenters the main drainage way some distance below the dam. It may be\r\nnecessary and possible to pierce the rim by means of a tunnel where its\r\nlength would not prohibit such a design. Lastly, there may be no other\r\nalternative than the construction of an overfall spillway, at one or\r\nboth ends of the embankment. This last method is the least desirable of\r\nany and should be resorted to only when the others are impracticable;\r\neven then, the volume of water, local topography, geology, and\r\nconstructive materials at hand must be favorable to such a design. If\r\nthey are not favorable it may be asked, “what then?” Simply do not\r\nattempt to build an earth dam at this site.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL FEATURES, MATERIALS, ETC.–An investigation of the location\r\nand the physical features of the dam site should include a careful and\r\nscientific examination of the materials in the vicinity, to determine\r\ntheir suitability for use in construction. An earth embankment cannot\r\nbe built without earth, and an earth dam cannot be built with safety\r\nwithout the right kind of earth material.\r\n\r\nTest pits judiciously distributed and situated at different elevations\r\nwill indicate whether there is a sufficient amount of suitable\r\nmaterial within a reasonable distance of the dam. The type of earth\r\ndam best suited for any particular locality, and its estimated cost,\r\nare thus seen to depend upon the data and information obtained by\r\nthese preliminary studies. Economical construction requires the use of\r\nimproved machinery and modern methods of handling materials, but far\r\nmore important even than these are the details of construction.\r\n\r\nFOUNDATION.–We may now assume that our preliminary studies relating to\r\nthe location and physical features of the dam site are satisfactory.\r\nWe must next investigate the foundation upon which the dam is to be\r\nbuilt. This investigation is sometimes wholly neglected or else done in\r\nsuch a way as to be practically useless. To merely drive down iron rods\r\nfeeling for so-called bed rock, or to make only a few bore-holes with\r\nan earth auger should in no instance be considered sufficient. Borings\r\nmay be found necessary at considerable depths below the surface and\r\nin certain classes of material, but dug pits or shafts should always\r\nbe resorted to for moderate depths and whenever practicable. Only by\r\nsuch means may the true character of the strata underlying the surface,\r\nand the nature and condition of the bed rock, if it be reached, become\r\nknown. If a satisfactory stratum of impermeable material be found it is\r\nnecessary also to learn both its thickness and extent. It may prove to\r\nbe only a “pocket” of limited volume, or if found to extend entirely\r\nacross the depression lengthwise of the dam site it may “pinch out”\r\non lines transversely above or below. Shafts and borings made in the\r\nreservoir basin and below the dam site will determine its extent in\r\nthis direction, knowledge of which is very important.\r\n\r\nFig. 1, showing a longitudinal section of the site of the Yarrow Dam of\r\nthe Liverpool Water-Works, England, illustrates the necessity of such\r\ninvestigation. A bore hole at station 2 + 00 met a large boulder which\r\nat first was erroneously thought to be bed rock. The hole at station 3\r\n+ 50 met a stratum of clay which proved to be only a pocket.\r\n\r\nThe relative elevation of the different strata and of the bed rock\r\nformation, referred to one common datum, should always be determined.\r\nThese elevations will indicate both the dip and strike of the rock\r\nformation and are necessary for estimating the quantities of material\r\nto be excavated and removed, including estimates of cost. They furnish\r\ninformation of value in determining the rate of percolation or\r\nfiltration through the different classes of material and the amount\r\nof probable seepage, as will appear later. The cost of excavating,\r\ndraining and preparing the floor or foundation for a dam is often very\r\ngreat, amounting to 20 or 30% of the total cost.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 is a transverse section of the Yarrow Dam. This particular dam\r\nhas been selected as fairly representative of English practice and\r\nof typical design. It is one of the most widely known earth dams in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.–LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF YARROW DAM SITE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.–CROSS-SECTION OF YARROW DAM.]\r\n\r\nAt the Yarrow dam site it was necessary to go 97 ft. below the original\r\nsurface to obtain a satisfactory formation or one that was impermeable.\r\nA central trench was excavated to bed rock, parallel to the axis of the\r\ndam, and filled with clay puddle to form a water-tight connection with\r\nthe rock, and prevent the water in the reservoir from passing through\r\nthe porous materials under the body of the embankment. This interesting\r\ndam will be more fully described later, when the different types of\r\nearth dams are discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Outline Study of Soils. Puddle._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following study of soils is merely suggestive and is here given\r\nto emphasize the importance of the subject, at the risk of being\r\nconsidered a digression. Soil formations are made in one of three ways:\r\n\r\n    1. By decomposition of exposed rocks.\r\n\r\n    2. By transportation or sedimentation of fine and coarse\r\n       materials worn from rocks.\r\n\r\n    3. By transformation into humus of decayed organic matter.\r\n\r\nThe transforming agencies by which soils succeed rocks in geological\r\nprogression have been classified as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. Changes of temperature.\r\n\r\n    2. Water.\r\n\r\n    3. Air.\r\n\r\n    4. Organic life.\r\n\r\n_Heat_ and its counter agent frost are the most powerful forces in\r\nnature, their sensible physical effects being the expansion and\r\ncontraction of matter.\r\n\r\n_Water_ has two modes of action, physical and chemical. This agent is\r\nthe great destroyer of the important forces, cohesion and friction.\r\n_Cohesion_ is a force uniting particles of matter and resists their\r\nseparation when the motion attempted is perpendicular to the plane of\r\ncontact. _Friction_ is a force resisting the separation of surfaces\r\nwhen motion is attempted which produces sliding. The hydrostatic\r\npressure and resultant effect upon submerged surfaces need to be\r\nkept constantly in mind. When the surface is impermeable the line of\r\npressure is normal to its plane, but when once saturated there are also\r\nhorizontal and vertical lines of pressure. Since the strength of an\r\nearth dam depends upon two factors, namely, its weight and frictional\r\nresistance to sliding, the effect of water upon different materials\r\nentering into an earth structure should be most carefully considered.\r\nThis will therefore occupy a large place in these pages. An earth\r\nembankment founded upon rock may become saturated by water forced up\r\ninto it from below through cracks and fissures, reducing its lower\r\nstratum to a state of muddy sludge, on which the upper part, however\r\nsound in itself, would slide. The best preliminary step to take in such\r\na case is to intersect the whole site with wide, dry, stone drains,\r\ntheir depths varying according to the nature of the ground or rock.\r\n\r\n_Air_ contains two ingredients ever active in the process of\r\ndecomposition, carbonic acid and oxygen.\r\n\r\n_Organic Life_ accomplishes its decomposing effect both by physical\r\nand chemical means. The effect of organic matter upon the mineral\r\ningredients of the soil may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. By their hydroscopic properties they keep the soil moist.\r\n\r\n    2. Their decomposition yields carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\n    3. The acids produced disintegrate the mineral constituents,\r\n       reducing insoluble matter to soluble plant food.\r\n\r\n    4. Nitric acid results in _nitrates_, which are the most\r\n       valuable form of nutritive nitrogen, while ammonia and the\r\n       other salts that are formed are themselves direct food for\r\n       plants.\r\n\r\n_Vegetable Humus_ is not the end of decomposition of organic matter,\r\nbut an intermediate state of transformation. Decay is a process almost\r\nidentical with combustion, where the products are the same, and the end\r\nis the formation of water and carbonic acid, with a residue of mineral\r\nash. The conditions essential to organic decomposition are also those\r\nmost favorable to combustion or oxidation, being (1) access of air, (2)\r\npresence of moisture, and (3) application of heat.\r\n\r\nNow the coöperation of these chemical and physical forces, which are\r\never active, is called “weathering.” Slate rock, for instance, weathers\r\nto clay, being impregnated with particles of mica, quartz, chlorite and\r\nhornblend. Shales also weather to clay, resulting often in a type of\r\nearth which is little more than silicate of aluminum with iron oxide\r\nand sand.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the Tabeaud Dam, recently built under the personal\r\nsupervision of the author, the construction of which will be described\r\nlater, there is to be found a species of potash mica, which in\r\ndecomposing yields a yellow clay (being ochre-colored from the presence\r\nof iron), mixed with particles of undecomposed mica. This material\r\nis subject to expansion, and by reason of its lack of grit and its\r\nunctuous character it was rejected or used very sparingly. Analysis of\r\nthis material gave, Silica, 54.1 to 59.5%; potash, 1.5 to 2.3%; soda,\r\n2.7 to 3.7%.\r\n\r\nSoil analysis may be either mechanical or chemical. For purposes of\r\nearthwork, we are most interested in the former, having to deal with\r\nthe physical properties of matter. Chemical analysis, however, will\r\noften afford information of great value regarding certain materials\r\nentering into the construction of earth dams. The most important\r\nphysical properties are:\r\n\r\n    (1) Weight and specific gravity.\r\n\r\n    (2) Coefficient of friction and angle of repose.\r\n\r\n    (3) Structure and coloring ingredients.\r\n\r\n    (4) Behavior toward water.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct methods of mechanical analysis: (1) Granulating\r\nwith sieves, having round holes. (2) Elutriating with water, the\r\nprocess being known as silt analysis.\r\n\r\nIt would require a large volume to present the subject of soil analysis\r\nin any way commensurate with its importance. Experiments bearing upon\r\nthe subjects of imbibition, permeability, capillarity, absorption and\r\nevaporation, of different earth materials, are equally interesting and\r\nimportant.[1]\r\n\r\nThe permeability of soils will be discussed incidentally in connection\r\nwith certain infiltration experiments to be given later.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuddle.\r\n\r\n_Puddle_ without qualification may be defined as clayey and gravelly\r\nearth thoroughly wetted and mixed, having a consistency of stiff mud\r\nor mortar. Puddle in which the predominating ingredient of the mixture\r\nis pure clay, is called _clay puddle_. _Gravel puddle_ contains a much\r\nhigher percentage of grit and gravel than the last-named and yet is\r\nsupposed to have enough clayey material to bind the matrix together and\r\nto fill all the voids in the gravel.\r\n\r\nThe term _earthen concrete_ may also be applied to this class of\r\nmaterial, especially when only a small quantity of water is used in\r\nthe mixture. These different kinds of puddling materials may be found\r\nin natural deposits ready for use, only requiring the addition of the\r\nproper amount of water. It is usually necessary, however, to mix,\r\nartificially, or combine the different ingredients in order to obtain\r\nthe right proportions. Some engineers think grinding in a pug-mill\r\nabsolutely essential to obtain satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nPuddle is handled very much as cement concrete, which is so well\r\nunderstood that detailed description is hardly necessary. Instead of\r\ntampers, sharp cutting implements are usually employed in putting\r\npuddle into place. Trampling with hoofed animals is frequently resorted\r\nto, both for the purpose of mixing and compacting.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, clays come from the decomposition of crystaline\r\nrocks. The purest clay known (kaolin) is composed of alumina, silica\r\nand water. The smaller the proportion of silica the more water it will\r\nabsorb and retain. Dry clay will absorb nearly one-third of its weight\r\nof water, and clay in a naturally moist condition 1-6 to 1-8 its weight\r\nof water. The eminent English engineers, Baker and Latham, put the\r\npercentage of absorption by clayey soils as high as 40 to 60%. Pure\r\nclays shrink about 5% in drying, while a mixture by weight of 1 clay\r\nto 2 sand will shrink about 3%. It follows, then, that the larger the\r\npercentage of clay there may be in a mixture the greater will be both\r\nthe expansion and the contraction.\r\n\r\nClay materials may be very deceptive in some of their physical\r\nproperties, being hard to pick under certain conditions, and yet when\r\nexposed to air and water will rapidly disintegrate. Beds of clay,\r\nmarl and very fine sand are liable to slip when saturated, becoming\r\nsemi-fluid in their nature, and will run like cream.\r\n\r\nThe cohesive and frictional resistances of clays becoming thus very\r\nmuch reduced when charged with water, a too liberal use of this\r\nmaterial is to be deprecated. The ultimate particles forming clays,\r\nviewed under the microscope, are seen to be flat and scale-like, while\r\nthose of sands are more cubical and spherical. This is a mechanical\r\ndifference which ought to be apparent to even a superficial observer\r\nand yet has escaped recognition by many who have vainly attempted a\r\ndefinition of _quicksand_.\r\n\r\nMr. Strange recommends filling the puddle trench with material having\r\nthree parts soil and two parts sand. After the first layer next to bed\r\nrock foundation, which he kneads and compacts, he would put the layers\r\nin dry, then water and work it by treading, finally covering to avoid\r\nits drying out and cracking.\r\n\r\nProf. Philipp Forchheimer, of Gratz, Austria, one of the highest\r\nauthorities and experimentalists, affirms that if a sandy soil contains\r\nclay to such an extent that the clay fills up the interstices between\r\nthe grains of sand entirely the compound is practically impervious.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert M. Wilson, C. E., in his “Manual of Irrigation\r\nEngineering,” recommends the following as an ideal mixture of materials:\r\n\r\n                       Cu. yds.\r\n\r\n    Coarse gravel        1.00\r\n    Fine gravel          0.35\r\n    Sand                 0.15\r\n    Clay                 0.20\r\n                         ––\r\n        Total            1.70\r\n\r\nThis mixture, when rolled and compacted, should give 1.25 cu. yds. in\r\nbulk, thus resulting in 26½% compression.\r\n\r\nMr. Clemens Herschel suggests the following test of “good binding\r\ngravel:” “Mix with water in a pail to the consistency of moist earth;\r\nif on turning the pail upside down the gravel remains in the pail it is\r\nfit for use, otherwise it is to be rejected.” For _puddling material_\r\nhe would use such a proportion as will render the water invisible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_The Tabeaud Dam, California._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tabeaud Dam, in Amador County, Cal., built under the supervision\r\nof the author for the Standard Electric Co., is an example of the\r\nhomogeneous earth dam. A somewhat fuller description and discussion\r\nwill be given of this dam than of any other, not on account of its\r\ngreater importance or interest, but because it exemplifies certain\r\nprinciples of construction upon which it is desired to put special\r\nemphasis. This dam was described in Engineering News of July 10, 1902,\r\nto which the reader is referred for more complete information than is\r\ngiven here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.–PLAN OF TABEAUD RESERVOIR, WITH CONTOURS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.–PLAN OF TABEAUD DAM, SHOWING BED ROCK DRAINAGE\r\nSYSTEM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.–DETAILS OF BED ROCK DRAINS AT THE TABEAUD DAM.]\r\n\r\nFig. 3 is a contour map of the Tabeaud Reservoir, showing the relative\r\nlocations of the dam, wasteway and outlet tunnel. Fig. 4 shows the bed\r\nrock drainage system and the letters upon the drawing will assist in\r\nfollowing the explanation given in the text. The whole up-stream half\r\nof the dam site was stripped to bed rock. As the work of excavation\r\nadvanced pockets of loose alluvial soil were encountered, which were\r\nsuggestive of a refill, possibly the result of placer mining operations\r\nduring the early mining days of California. In addition to this were\r\nfound thin strata of sand and gravel deposited in an unconformable\r\nmanner. The slate bed rock near the up-stream toe of the dam was badly\r\nfissured and yielded considerable water. A quartz vein from 1 to 2 ft.\r\nin thickness crossed the dam site about 150 ft. above the axis of the\r\ndam. The slate rock above this vein or fault line was quite variable in\r\nhardness and dipped at an angle of 40 degrees toward the reservoir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.–VIEW OF BED ROCK TRENCHES, TABEAUD DAM.]\r\n\r\nThe rear drain terminates at a weir box (Z) outside of the down-stream\r\nslope at a distance of 500 ft. from the axis of the dam. This drain\r\nbranches at the down-stream side of the central trench, (Y), one branch\r\nbeing carried up the hillside to high-water level (W) at the North end\r\nof the dam, and the other to the same elevation at the South end (X).\r\n\r\nFig. 5 shows how these drains were constructed. After the removal of\r\nall surface soil and loose rock, a trench 5 to 10 ft. wide was cut into\r\nthe solid rock, the depth of cutting varying with the character of the\r\nbed rock. Upon the floor of this trench a small open drain was made by\r\nnotching the bed rock and by means of selected stones of suitable size\r\nand hardness. The stringers and cap-stones were carefully selected and\r\nlaid, so that no undue settlement or displacement might occur by reason\r\nof the superincumbent weight of the dam. All crevices were carefully\r\nfilled with spawls and the whole overlaid 18 ins. in depth with broken\r\nstone 1 to 3 ins. in diameter. Upon this layer of broken stone and\r\nfine gravel was deposited choice clay puddle, thoroughly wetted and\r\ncompacted, refilling the trenches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.–VIEW OF NORTH TRENCH, TABEAUD DAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.–VIEW OF SOUTH TRENCH, TABEAUD DAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.–VIEW OF MAIN CENTRAL DRAIN, TABEAUD DAM.]\r\n\r\nThese drains served a useful purpose during construction, in drying\r\noff the surface of the dam after rains. The saturation of the outer\r\nslope of the dam by water creeping along the line of contact should\r\nthus be prevented, and the integrity or freedom from saturation of the\r\ndown-stream half should be preserved. It is believed that the puddle\r\noverlying these rock drains will effectually prevent any water from\r\nentering the body of the embankment by upward pressure and that the\r\ndrains will thus forever act as efficient safeguards.\r\n\r\nThe main drain was extended, temporarily during construction, from\r\nthe central trench (Fig. 4), to the up-stream toe of the dam. This\r\nwas cut 5 or 6 ft. deep into solid rock, below the general level of\r\nthe stripped surface. Fig. 6 is reproduced from a photograph of this\r\ntrench. An iron pipe 2 ins. in diameter was imbedded in Portland cement\r\nmortar and concrete, and laid near the bottom of the trench.\r\n\r\nAt the point (B) where the quartz vein (already described) intersected\r\nthis drain, two branch drains were made, following the fault well into\r\nthe hill on both sides. Figs. 7 and 8 are views of the North and South\r\ntrenches, respectively. These trenches were necessary to take care of\r\nthe springs issuing along the quartz vein. This water led to a point\r\n(N, Fig. 4) near the up-stream toe, by means of the drain shown in Fig.\r\n9.\r\n\r\nThe lateral drains and that portion of the main central drain extending\r\nfrom their junction (B) to a point (N) about 230 ft. from the axis\r\nof the dam have pieces of angle iron or wooden Y-fluming laid on the\r\nbottom of the trenches immediately over the 2-in. pipe, as shown in\r\nFigs. 7, 8 and 9. These are covered in turn with Portland cement\r\nmortar, concrete, clay puddle and earth fill. The water will naturally\r\nflow along the line of least resistance, and consequently will follow\r\nalong the open space between the angle irons and the outside of the\r\npipe until it reaches the chamber and opening in the pipe, permitting\r\nthe water to enter and be conveyed through the imbedded pipe-line to\r\nthe rear drain. This point of entry is a small chamber in a solid\r\ncross-wall of rich cement mortar, and is the only point where water\r\ncan enter this pipe-line, the two branches entering the wells and the\r\nstand-pipe at their junction (soon to be described) having been closed.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the foundation between the axis of the dam and the\r\nquartz vein, a distance of about 160 ft., was very satisfactory,\r\nwithout fissures or springs of water. In this portion the 2-in. pipe\r\nwas imbedded in mortar and concrete without angle irons, and the\r\ncontinuity of the trench broken by numerous cross-trenches cut into\r\nthe rock and filled with concrete and puddle. It is believed that no\r\nseepage water will ever pass through this portion of the dam. If any\r\nshould ever find its way under the puddle and through the bed rock\r\nformation, the rear drain, with its hillside branches, will carry it\r\naway and prevent the saturation of the lower or down-stream half of the\r\ndam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.–VIEW OF TABEAUD DAM WHEN ABOUT HALF COMPLETED.]\r\n\r\nAt the up-stream toe of the embankment, two wells or sumps (shown at\r\n“S” and “K,” Fig. 4) were cut 10 or 12 ft. deeper than the main trench,\r\nwhich received the water entering the inner toe puddle trench during\r\nconstruction. This water was disposed of partly by pumping and partly\r\nby means of the 2-in. branch pipes leading into and from these wells.\r\nAt their junction (J) a 2-in. stand-pipe was erected, which was carried\r\nvertically up through the embankment, and finally filled with cement.\r\nThe branch pipes from the wells were finally capped and the wells\r\nfilled with broken stone, as previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nEMBANKMENT.–As has been said, the upper surface of the slate bed rock\r\nwas found to be badly fissured, especially near the up-stream toe of\r\nthe dam, and as the average depth below the surface of the ground was\r\nnot very great, it was thought best to lay bare the bed rock over the\r\nentire upper half of the dam site. Had the depth been much greater,\r\nit would have been more economical and possibly sufficient to have\r\nput reliance in a puddle trench, alone, for securing a water-tight\r\nconnection between the foundation and the body of the dam.\r\n\r\nAt the axis of the dam and near the inner toe, where the puddle walls\r\nabutted against the hillsides, the excavation always extended to bed\r\nrock. Vertical steps and offsets were avoided and the cuts were made\r\nlarge enough for horses to turn in while tramping, these animals being\r\nused, singly and in groups, to mix and compact the puddle and thus\r\nlessen the labor of tamping by hand. In plan, the hillside contact\r\nof natural and artificial surfaces presents a series of corrugated\r\nlines, (as is clearly shown in Fig. 4.) After all loose and porous\r\nmaterials had been removed, the stripped surface and the slopes of all\r\nexcavations were thoroughly wetted from time to time by means of hose\r\nand nozzle, the water being delivered under pressure. Fig. 10 is a view\r\nof the dam taken when it was about half finished and shows the work in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe face puddle shown in Fig. 11 was used merely to “make assurance\r\ndoubly sure” and was not carried entirely up to the top of the dam.\r\nThe earth of which the dam was constructed may be described as a\r\nred gravelly clay, and in the judgment of the author is almost ideal\r\nmaterial for the purpose. Physical tests and experiments made with the\r\nmaterials at different times during construction gave the following\r\naverage results:\r\n\r\n                                                               Pounds.\r\n    Weight of 1 cu. ft. earth, dust dry                         84.0\r\n      “    “  1   “     saturated earth                        101.8\r\n      “    “  1   “     moist loose earth                       76.6\r\n      “    “  1   “     loose material\r\n                              taken from test pits on the dam   80.0\r\n      “    “  1   “     earth in place\r\n                              taken from the borrow pits       116.5\r\n      “    “  1   “     earth material\r\n                              taken from test pits on the dam  133.0\r\n\r\n                                                            Per cent.\r\n    Percentage of moisture in natural earth                      19\r\n        “      “ voids in natural earth                          52\r\n        “      “ grit and gravel in natural earth                38\r\n        “      “ compression on dam over earth at borrow pit     16\r\n        “      “ compression on dam over earth in wagons         43\r\n\r\n                                                             Degrees.\r\n    Angle of repose of natural moist earth                       44\r\n    Angle of repose of earth, dust dry                           36\r\n    Angle of repose of saturated earth                           23\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION DETAILS.–The materials forming the bulk of the dam were\r\nhauled by four-horse teams, in dump wagons, holding 3 cu. yds. each.\r\nThe wagons loaded weighed about six tons and were provided with two\r\nswinging bottom-doors, which the driver could operate with a lever,\r\nenabling the load to be quickly dropped while the team was in motion.\r\nIf the material was quite dry, the load could be dumped in a long row\r\nwhen so desired.\r\n\r\nAfter plowing the surface of the ground and wasting any objectionable\r\nsurface soil, the material was brought to common earth-traps for\r\nloading into wagons, by buck or dragscrapers of the Fresno pattern. In\r\ngood material one trap with eight Fresno-scraper teams could fill 25\r\nwagons per hour. The average length of haul for the entire work was\r\nabout 1,320 ft.\r\n\r\nThe original plans and specifications were adhered to throughout, with\r\nthe single exception that the central puddle wall was not carried above\r\nelevation 1,160, as shown on Figs. 11 and 12, more attention being\r\ngiven to the inner face puddle. This modification in the original plans\r\nwas made because of the character of the materials available and the\r\nexcellent results obtained in securing an homogeneous earthen concrete,\r\npractically impervious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.–DIMENSION SECTION OF TABEAUD DAM.]\r\n\r\nThe top of the embankment was maintained basin-shaped during\r\nconstruction, being lower at the axis than at the outer slopes by 1-10,\r\nto the height below the finished crown. This gave a grade of about 1\r\nin 25 from the edges toward the center, resulting in the following\r\nadvantages:\r\n\r\n(1) Insuring a more thorough wetting of the central portion of the dam;\r\nany excess of water in this part would be readily taken care of by the\r\ncentral cross drains.\r\n\r\n(2) In wetting the finished surface prior to depositing a new layer\r\nof material, water from the sprinkling wagons would naturally drain\r\ntowards the center and insure keeping the surface wet; the layers being\r\ncarried, as a rule, progressively outward from the center.\r\n\r\n(3) It centralized the maximum earth pressure and enabled the\r\ndepositing of material in layers perpendicular to the slopes.\r\n\r\n(4) It facilitated rolling and hauling on lines parallel to the axis of\r\nthe dam, and discouraged transverse and miscellaneous operations.\r\n\r\n(5) It finally insured better compacting by the tramping of teams in\r\ntheir exertions to overcome the grade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.–CROSS AND LONGITUDINAL SECTIONS OF TABEAUD\r\nDAM.]\r\n\r\nThe specifications stipulated that the body of the dam should be built\r\nup in layers not exceeding 6 ins. in thickness for the first 60 ft.,\r\nand not exceeding 8 ins. above that elevation. The finished layers\r\nafter rolling varied slightly in thickness, the daily average per month\r\nbeing as follows:\r\n\r\n    April                     4  ins.\r\n    May                       3½  “\r\n    June                      4   “\r\n    July                      4½  “\r\n    August                    5   “\r\n    September                 6   “\r\n    October                   7   “\r\n    November and December     8   “\r\n\r\nDuring the last few months more than one whole layer constituted the\r\nday’s work, so that a single layer was seldom as thick as the daily\r\naverage indicates.\r\n\r\nIt was stipulated in the specifications that the up-stream half of the\r\ndam was to be made of “selected material” and the lower half of less\r\nchoice material, not designated “waste.” “Waste material” was described\r\nas meaning all vegetable humus, light soil, roots, and rock exceeding 5\r\nlbs. in weight, too large to pass through a 4-in. ring.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to define the expression “selected material,”\r\nso commonly used in specifications for earth dams. In England,\r\nfor instance, it is said to refer to materials which insure\r\n_water-tightness_, while in India it refers to those employed to obtain\r\n_stability_. It ought to mean the best material available, selected by\r\nthe engineer to suit the requirements of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe method employed in building the body of the embankment may be\r\ndescribed as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The top surface of every finished layer of material was sprinkled\r\nand harrowed prior to putting on a new layer. The sprinkling wagons\r\npassed over the older finished surface immediately before each\r\nwagon-row was begun. This insured a wetted surface and assisted the\r\nwheels of the loaded wagons, as well as the harrows, to roughen, the\r\nold surface prior to depositing a new layer.\r\n\r\n(2) The material was generally deposited in rows parallel to the axis\r\nof the dam. However, along the line of contact, at the margins of the\r\nembankment, the earth was often deposited in rows crosswise of the\r\ndam, permitting a selection of the choicest materials and greatly\r\nfacilitating the work of graders and rollers.\r\n\r\n(3) Rock pickers with their carts were continually passing along the\r\nrows gathering up all roots, rocks and other waste materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.–VIEW OF TABEAUD DAM IMMEDIATELY AFTER\r\nCOMPLETION.]\r\n\r\n(4) The road-graders drawn by six horses leveled down the tops of\r\nthe wagon-loads, and if the material was dry the sprinkling wagons\r\nimmediately passed over the rows prior to further grading. When the\r\nmaterial was naturally moist the grader continued the leveling process\r\nuntil the earth was evenly spread. The depth or thickness of the layer\r\ncould be regulated to a nicety by properly spacing the rows and the\r\nindividual loads. The grader brought the layer to a smooth surface\r\nand of uniform thickness, and nothing more could be desired for this\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n(5) After the graders had finished, the harrows passed over the new\r\nlayer to insure the picking out of all roots and rocks, followed\r\nimmediately by the sprinkling wagons.\r\n\r\n(6) Finally the rollers thoroughly compacted the layer of earth,\r\ngenerally passing to and fro over it lengthwise of the dam. Along the\r\nline of contact at the ends, however, they passed crosswise. Then again\r\nthey frequently went around a portion of the surface until the whole\r\nwas hard and solid.\r\n\r\nTwo rollers were in use constantly, each drawn by six horses. One\r\nweighed five tons and the other eight tons, giving respectively 166 and\r\n200 lbs. pressure per lin. in. They were not grooved, but the smooth\r\nsurface left by the rollers was always harrowed and cut up more or\r\nless by the loaded wagons passing over the surface previously wetted.\r\nThe wagons when loaded gave 750 lbs. pressure per lin. in., and the\r\nheavy teams traveling wherever they could do the most effective work\r\ncompacted the materials better even than the rollers.\r\n\r\nSeveral test pits which were dug into the dam during construction\r\nshowed that there were no distinct lines traceable between the layers\r\nand no loose or dry spots, but that the whole mass was solid and\r\nhomogeneous.\r\n\r\nA careful record is being kept of the amount of settlement of the\r\nTabeaud Dam. It will be of interest to record here the fact that just\r\none year after date of completion the settlement amounted to 0.2 ft.,\r\nwith 90 ft. depth of water in the reservoir.\r\n\r\nWater was first turned into the reservoir five months after the dam was\r\nfinished. The very small amount of settlement here shown emphasizes\r\nmore eloquently than words the author’s concluding remarks relating to\r\nthe importance of thorough consolidation, by artificial means, of the\r\nembankment. (See p. 64, Secs. 6 to 8.)\r\n\r\nOUTLET TUNNEL.–The outlet for the reservoir is a tunnel 2,903 ft. in\r\nlength, through a ridge of solid slate rock formation, which was very\r\nhard and refractory. At the north or reservoir end of the tunnel, there\r\nis an open cut 350 ft. long, with a maximum depth of 26 ft.\r\n\r\nNear the south portal of the tunnel and in the line of pressure pipes\r\nconnecting the “petty reservoir” above with the power-house below,\r\nis placed a receiver, connected with the tunnel by means of a short\r\npipe-line, 60 ins. in diameter.\r\n\r\nA water-tight bulkhead of brick and concrete masonry is placed in the\r\ntunnel, at a point about 175 ft. distant from the receiver. In the line\r\nof 60-in. riveted steel pipe, which connects the reservoir and tunnel\r\nwith the receiver, there is placed a cast iron chamber for entrapping\r\nsilt or sand, with a branch pipe 16 ins. in diameter leading into a\r\nside ravine through which sand or silt thus collected can be wasted or\r\nwashed out. By the design of construction thus described, it will be\r\nseen that all controlling devices, screens, gates, etc., are at the\r\nsouth end of the tunnel and easily accessible.\r\n\r\nWASTEWAY.–The wasteway for the reservoir is an open cut through its\r\nrim, 48 ft. in width and 300 ft. long. The sill of the spillway is 10\r\nft. below the crown of the dam. The reservoir having less than two\r\nsquare miles of catchment area, and the feeding canals being under\r\ncomplete control, the dam can never be over-topped by a flood. Fig.\r\n3 shows the relative location of the dam, outlet tunnel and wasteway\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole of the embankment forming the Tabeaud Dam, not\r\nincluded in the foundation work, was built in less than eight months.\r\nThe contractor’s outfit was the best for the purpose the writer has\r\never seen. After increasing his force from time to time he finally had\r\nthe following equipment:\r\n\r\n      1 steam shovel (1½ yds. capacity),\r\n     37 patent dump wagons,\r\n     11 stick-wagons and rock-carts,\r\n     39 buck-scrapers (Fresno pattern),\r\n     21 wheel scrapers,\r\n      3 road-graders,\r\n      3 sprinkling wagons,\r\n      2 harrows,\r\n      2 rollers (5 and 8-ton),\r\n    233 men,\r\n    416 horses and mules,\r\n      8 road and hillside plows.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS.–The following data relating to the Tabeaud Dam Reservoir\r\nwill conclude this description:\r\n\r\n\r\nDAM.\r\n\r\n    Length at crown                                            636 ft.\r\n    Length at base crossing ravine                       50 to 100  “\r\n    Height to top of crown (El. 1,258.)                        120  “\r\n      “    at ends above bedrock                               117  “\r\n      “    at up-stream toe                                    100  “\r\n      “    at down-stream toe                                  123  “\r\n    Effective head                                             115  “\r\n    Width at crown                                              20  “\r\n    Width at base                                              620  “\r\n                 Slopes, 2½ on 1 with rock-fill 3 to 1.\r\n    Excavation for foundations                          40,000 cu. yds.\r\n    Refill by company                                   40,000      “\r\n    Embankment built by contractor                     330,350      “\r\n    Total volume of dam                                370,350      “\r\n    Total weight                                          664,778 tons.\r\n    Length of wasteway (width)                                   48 ft.\r\n    Depth of spillway sill below crown                           10  “\r\n    Depth of spillway sill below ends                             7  “\r\n    Height of stop-planks in wasteway                             2  “\r\n    Maximum depth of water in reservoir                          92  “\r\n    Area to be faced with stone                          1,933 sq. yds.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESERVOIR.\r\n\r\n    Catchment area (approximate)                          2 sq. miles.\r\n    Area of water surface                                 36.75 acres.\r\n    Silt storage capacity below outlet tunnel        1,091,470 cu. ft.\r\n    Available water storage capacity                46,612,405    “\r\n    Elevation of outlet tunnel                               1,180 ft.\r\n        “      “ high-water surface                          1,250  “\r\n        “      “ crown of dam                                1,258  “\r\n\r\nFig. 13 is a view of the finished dam, taken immediately after\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_Different Types of Earth Dams._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several types of earth dams, which may be described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    1. Homogeneous earth dams, either with or without a puddle\r\n       trench.\r\n\r\n    2. Earth dams with a puddle core or puddle face.\r\n\r\n    3. Earth dams with a core wall of brick, rubble or concrete\r\n       masonry.\r\n\r\n    4. New types, composite structures.\r\n\r\n    5. Rock-fill dams with earth inner slope.\r\n\r\n    6. Hydraulic-fill dams of earth and gravel.\r\n\r\nThe writer proposes to give an example of each type, with such remarks\r\nupon their distinctive features and relative merits as he thinks may be\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarth Dams with Puddle Core Wall or Face.\r\n\r\nYARROW DAM.–The Yarrow dam of the Liverpool Water-Works is a notable\r\nexample of the second type, (a section of which is shown in Fig. 2.)\r\nAn excavation 97 ft. in depth was made to bed rock through different\r\nstrata of varying thickness, and a trench 24 ft. wide was cut with\r\nside slopes 1 on 1 for the first 10 ft. in depth below the surface.\r\nThe trench was then carried down through sand, gravel and boulders\r\nwith sides sloping 1 in 12. The upper surface of the shale bed rock\r\nwas found to be soft, seamy and water-bearing. Pumps were installed\r\nto keep the water out of the trench while it was being cut 4 or 5 ft.\r\ndeeper into the shale. The lower portion was then walled up on either\r\nside with brickwork 14 ins. in thickness, and the trench between the\r\nwalls was filled with concrete, made in the proportion of 1 of cement,\r\n1 of sand and 2 of gravel or broken stone. By so doing a dry bed was\r\nsecured for the foundation of the puddle wall. Two lines of 6-in. pipes\r\nwere laid on the bed rock, outside of the walls, and pipes 9 ins. in\r\ndiameter extended vertically above the top of the brickwork some 27\r\nft. These pipes were filled with concrete, after disconnecting the\r\npumps. After refilling the trench with puddle to the original surface,\r\na puddle wall was carried up simultaneous with the embankment, having a\r\ndecreasing batter of 1 in 12, which gave a width of 6 ft. at the top.\r\nThis form of construction is very common in England and Figs. 14 and 15\r\nshow two California dams, the Pilarcitos and San Andres, of the same\r\ngeneral type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.–CROSS-SECTION OF PILARCITOS DAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.–CROSS-SECTION OF SAN ANDRES DAM.]\r\n\r\nASHTI EMBANKMENT.–This is not a very high embankment, but being typical\r\nof modern dams in British India, where the puddle is generally carried\r\nonly to the top of the original surface of the ground, and not up\r\nthrough the body of the dam, it is thought worthy of mention. Fig. 16\r\nshows a section of this embankment, which is located in the Sholapur\r\nDistrict, India.\r\n\r\nThe central portion of this dam above the puddle trench is made of\r\n“selected black soil;” then on either side is placed “Brown Soil,”\r\nfinishing on the outer slopes with “Murum.” Trap rock decomposes first\r\ninto a friable stony material, known in India as “Murum” or “Murham.”\r\nThis material further decomposes into various argillaceous earths, the\r\nmost common being the “black cotton soil” mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.–CROSS-SECTION OF ASHTI TANK EMBANKMENT.]\r\n\r\nThis particular dam has been adversely criticised on account of the\r\nlack of uniformity in the character of the materials composing the\r\nbank. It is claimed that the materials being of different density and\r\nweight, unequal settlement will result, and lines of separation will\r\nform between the different kinds of materials.\r\n\r\nEarth materials do not unite or combine with timber or masonry, but\r\nthere are no such distinct lines of transition and separation between\r\ndifferent earth materials themselves as Fig. 16 would seem to indicate.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuddle Trench.\r\n\r\nIn the last three dams mentioned (Figs. 14, 15, 16) the puddle\r\ntrenches are made with vertical sides or vertical steps and offsets.\r\nA wedge-shaped trench certainly has many advantages over this form.\r\nPuddle being plastic, consolidates as the dam settles, filling the\r\nlowest parts by sliding on its bed. It thus has a tendency to break\r\naway from the portion supported by the step, and a further tendency to\r\nleave the vertical side, thus forming cracks and fissures for water to\r\nenter. The argument advanced by those holding a different view, namely,\r\nthat it is difficult to dress the sides of a trench to a steep batter\r\nand to timber it substantially, has in reality little weight when put\r\nto practical test. Mr. F. P. Stearns, in describing the recent work\r\nof excavating the cut-off trench of the North Dike of the Wachusett\r\nreservoir, Boston, said it was found to be both better and cheaper\r\nto excavate a trench with slopes than with vertical sides protected\r\nby sheeting. He favored this shape in case of pile-work and for the\r\npurpose also of wedging materials together.\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. J. McAlpine’s “Specifications for Earth Dams,” representing the\r\nbest practice of 25 years ago, which are frequently cited, contain the\r\nfollowing description of how to prepare the up-stream floor of the dam:\r\n\r\n    Remove the pervious and decaying matter by breaking up the natural\r\n    soil and by stepping up the sides of the ravine; also by several\r\n    toothed trenches across the bottom and up the sides.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. McAlpine’s well known axioms was, “water abhors an\r\nangle.” The “stepping” and “toothed” trenches above specified need\r\nnot necessarily be made with vertical planes, but should be made by\r\nmeans of inclined and horizontal planes. The writer’s experience and\r\nobservation leads him to think that all excavations in connection with\r\nearth dams requiring a refill should be made wedge-shaped so that the\r\npressure of the superincumbent materials in settling will wedge the\r\nmaterial tighter and tighter together and fill every cavity. A paper\r\nby Mr. Wm. L. Strange, C. E., on “Reservoirs with high Earthen Dams\r\nin Western India,” published in the Proceedings of the Institution of\r\nCivil Engineers, Vol. 132, (1898), is one of the best contributions to\r\nthe literature on this subject, known to the writer. Mr. Strange states\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    the rate of filtration of a soil depends upon its porosity,\r\n    which governs the frictional resistance to flow, and the\r\n    slope and length of the filamentary channels along which the\r\n    water may be considered to pass. It is evident, therefore,\r\n    that the direct rate of infiltration in a homogeneous soil\r\n    must decrease from the top to the bottom of the puddle\r\n    trench. The best section for a puddle trench is thus a\r\n    wedge, such as an open excavation would give. It is true\r\n    that the uppermost infiltrating filaments when stopped by\r\n    the puddle, will endeavor to get under it, but a depth will\r\n    eventually be reached when the frictional resistance along\r\n    the natural passages will be greater than that due to the\r\n    transverse passage of the puddle trench, and it is when\r\n    this occurs that the latter may be stopped without danger,\r\n    as the _filtration to it_ will be less than that\r\n    _through_ it. This depth requires to be determined in\r\n    each case, but in fairly compact Indian soils 30 feet will\r\n    be a fair limit.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuddle Wall vs. Puddle Trench.\r\n\r\nThere is a diversity of opinion among engineers in regard to the proper\r\nplace for the puddle in dam construction. Theoretically, the inner\r\nface would be preferable to the center, for the purpose of preventing\r\nany water from penetrating the embankment. It is well known that all\r\nmaterials immersed in water lose weight in proportion to the volume of\r\nwater they displace. If the upper half of the dam becomes saturated\r\nit must neccesarily lose both weight and stability. Its full cohesive\r\nstrength can only be maintained by making it impervious in some way.\r\nThe strength of an earth dam depends upon three factors:\r\n\r\n    1. Weight.\r\n    2. Frictional resistance against sliding.\r\n    3. Cohesiveness of its materials.\r\n\r\nThese can be known only so long as no water penetrates the body of\r\nthe dam. When once saturated the resultant line of pressure is no\r\nlonger normal to the inner slope, for the reason that there is now a\r\nforce tending to slide the dam horizontally and another due to the\r\nhydrostatic head tending to lift it vertically. When the water slope\r\nis impervious the horizontal thrust is sustained by the whole dam and\r\nnot by the lower half alone. When once a passage is made into the body\r\nof the dam, the infiltration water will escape along the line of least\r\nresistance, and if there be a fissure it may become a cavity and the\r\ncavity a breach.\r\n\r\nFor practical reasons, mainly on account of the difficulty of\r\nmaintaining a puddle face on the inner slope of a dam, which would\r\nrequire a very flat slope, puddle is generally placed at the center as\r\na core wall.\r\n\r\nIt was thought possible at the Tabeaud dam to counteract the tendency\r\nof the face puddle to slough off into the reservoir by use of a broken\r\nstone facing of riprap. This covering will protect the puddle from the\r\ndeteriorating effects of air and sun whenever the water is drawn low\r\nand also resists the pressure at the inner toe of the dam.\r\n\r\n\r\nPercolation and Infiltration.\r\n\r\nThe earlier authorities on the subject of percolation and infiltration\r\nof water are somewhat conflicting in their statements, if not confused\r\nin their ideas. We are again impressed with the importance of a clearly\r\ndefined and definite use of terms. The temptation and tendency to use\r\nlanguage synonymously is very great, but it is unscientific and must\r\nresult in confusion of thought. Let it be observed that _filtration_\r\nis the process of mechanically separating and removing the undissolved\r\nparticles floating in a liquid. That _infiltration_ is the process\r\nby which water (or other liquid) enters the interstices of porous\r\nmaterial. That _percolation_ is the action of a liquid passing through\r\nsmall interstices; and, finally, that _seepage_ is the amount of fluid\r\nwhich has percolated through porous materials.\r\n\r\nMany recent authorities are guilty of confusion in thought or\r\nexpression, as will appear from the following:\r\n\r\nOne says, for instance, that a\r\n\r\n    rock is water-tight when non-absorbent of water, but that a soil\r\n    is not water-tight unless it will absorb an enormous quantity of\r\n    water.\r\n\r\nThis would seem to indicate that super-saturation and not pressure is\r\nnecessary to increase the water-tightness of earth materials.\r\n\r\nAgain, in a recent discussion regarding the saturation and percolation\r\nof water through the lower half of a reservoir embankment, it was\r\nremarked, that\r\n\r\n    the more compact the material of which the bank is built,\r\n    the steeper will be the slope of saturation.\r\n\r\nException was taken to this, and the statement made, that\r\n\r\n    _with compact material_, the sectional area of flow\r\n    is larger below a given level with porous material, and as\r\n    the bank slope is one determining factor of the line of\r\n    saturation, this line tends to approach the slope line;\r\n    while with porous material in a down-stream bank, the slope\r\n    of saturation is steeper and the area of the flow less.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this, it was said,\r\n\r\n    that it is obvious that if the embankment below the core\r\n    wall is built of material so compact as to be impervious\r\n    to water, no water passing through the wall will enter it,\r\n    and the slope of saturation will be vertical. If it be\r\n    less compact, water will enter more or less according to\r\n    the head or pressure, and according to its compactness or\r\n    porosity, producing a slope of saturation whose inclination\r\n    is dependent on the frictional resistance encountered by\r\n    the water. And the bank will be tight whenever the slope of\r\n    saturation remains within the figure of the embankment.\r\n\r\nFurther,\r\n\r\n    that it was necessary to distinguish between the slope assumed\r\n    by water _retained in_ an embankment and that taken by water\r\n    _passing through_ an embankment made of material too porous to\r\n    retain it; where the rule is clearly reversed and where the more\r\n    porous the material the steeper the slope at which water will run\r\n    through it at a given rate.\r\n\r\nThese citations are sufficient to emphasize the importance of exact\r\ndefinition of terms and clear statement of principles.\r\n\r\nThe latest experiments relating to the percolation of water through\r\nearth materials and tests determining the stability of soils are\r\nthose made during the investigations at the New Croton Dam and\r\nJerome Park Reservoir, New York, and those relating to the North\r\nDike of the Wachusett Reservoir, Boston. These are very interesting\r\nand instructive, and it is here proposed to discuss the results and\r\nconclusions reached in these cases, after some introductory remarks\r\nreciting the order of events.\r\n\r\nNEW CROTON DAM.–In June, 1901, the Board of Croton Aqueduct\r\nCommissioners of New York requested a board of expert engineers,\r\nconsisting of Messrs. J. J. R. Croes, E. F. Smith and E. Sweet, to\r\nexamine the plans for the construction of the earth portion of the New\r\nCroton Dam, and also the core wall and embankment of the Jerome Park\r\nreservoir.\r\n\r\nThis report was published in full in Engineering News for Nov. 28,\r\n1901. It was followed in subsequent issues of the said journal by\r\nsupplemental and individual reports from each member of the board\r\nof experts, and by articles from Messrs. A. Fteley, who originally\r\ndesigned the works, A. Craven, formerly division engineer on this work,\r\nand W. R. Hill, at that time chief engineer of the Croton Aqueduct\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nAfter describing the New Croton Dam, the board of experts preface their\r\nremarks on the earth embankment by saying that\r\n\r\n    it has been abundantly proven that up to a height of 60\r\n    or 70 ft. an embankment founded on solid material and\r\n    constructed of well-selected earth, properly put in place,\r\n    is fully as durable and safe as a masonry wall and far less\r\n    costly.\r\n\r\nThere are, in fact, no less than 22 earth dams in use to-day exceeding\r\n90 ft. in height, and twice that number over 70 ft. in height. Five of\r\nthe former are in California, and several of these have been in use\r\nover 25 years. The writer fails to appreciate the reason for limiting\r\nthe safe height of earth dams to 60 or 70 ft.\r\n\r\nThe New Croton Dam was designed as a composite structure of masonry\r\nand earth, crossing the Croton Valley at a point three miles from the\r\nHudson River. The earth portion was to join the masonry portion at a\r\npoint where the latter was 195 ft. high from the bed rock. The Board\r\nthought there was no precedent for such a design and no necessity\r\nfor this form of construction. The point to be considered here was\r\nwhether a dam like this can be made sufficiently impermeable to water\r\nto prevent the outer slope from becoming saturated and thus liable to\r\nslide and be washed out.\r\n\r\nThe design of the embankment portion was similar to all the earth dams\r\nof the Croton Valley. In the center is built a wall of rubble masonry,\r\ngenerally founded upon solid rock, and “intended to prevent the free\r\nseepage of water, but not heavy enough to act alone as a retaining wall\r\nfor either water or earth.”\r\n\r\nFig. 17 shows a section which is typical of most New England earth\r\ndams; and Fig. 18, the sections of two of the Croton Valley dams, New\r\nYork water supply. These dams all have masonry core walls, illustrating\r\nthe third type of dams given on page 33.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.–CROSS-SECTION OF A TYPICAL NEW ENGLAND DAM.]\r\n\r\nThe board of experts made numerous tests by means of borings into\r\nthe Croton Valley dams to determine the slope of saturation. The\r\nhydraulic laboratory of Cornell University also made tests of the\r\npermeability of several samples of materials taken from pits. All the\r\nmaterials examined were found to be permeable and when exposed to water\r\nto disintegrate and assume a flat slope, the surface of which was\r\ndescribed as “slimy.”\r\n\r\nPipe wells were driven at different places into the dams and the line\r\nof saturation was determined by noting the elevations at which the\r\nwater stood in them. In all the dams the entire bank on the water side\r\nof the core wall appeared to be completely saturated. Water was also\r\nfound to be standing in the embankment on the down-stream side of the\r\ncore wall. The extent of saturation of the outer bank varied greatly,\r\ndue to the difference in materials, the care taken in building them,\r\nand their ages. Fig. 19 gives the average slopes of saturation as\r\ndetermined by these borings.\r\n\r\nThe experts stated\r\n\r\n    that the slope of the surface of the saturation in the bank\r\n    is determined by the solidity of the embankment: The more\r\n    compact the material of which the bank is built, the steeper\r\n    will be the slope of saturation.\r\n\r\nAs a result of their investigations, the experts were of the opinion\r\nthat the slope of saturation in the best embankments made of the\r\nmaterial found in the Croton Valley is about 35 ft. per 100 ft., and\r\nthat with materials less carefully selected and placed the slope may be\r\n20 ft. per 100 ft.\r\n\r\nFurther, that taking the loss of head in passing through the core wall,\r\nand the slope assumed by the plane of saturation, the maximum safe\r\nheight of an earth dam with its top 20 ft. above water level in the\r\nreservoir and its outside slope 2 on 1, is 63 to 102.5 ft. This is a\r\nremarkable finding in view of the fact that the Titicus Dam, one of the\r\nCroton Valley dams examined, has a maximum height above bed rock of 110\r\nft. and has been in use seven years. This dam is not a fair example to\r\ncite in proof of their conclusion, because its _effective head_ is only\r\nabout 46 ft.[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOG BROOK DAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIDDLE BRANCH DAM.\r\n\r\nFIG. 18.–CROSS-SECTION OF TWO CROTON VALLEY DAMS, SHOWING SATURATION.]\r\n\r\nMr. Fteley gave as a reason for the elevation of the water slope\r\nfound in the outer bank of the Croton dams the fact of their being\r\nconstructed of fine materials and stated that with comparatively porous\r\nmaterials they would have shown steeper slopes of saturation.\r\n\r\nMr. Craven argued that all dams will absorb more or less water, and\r\nthat porosity is merely a degree of compactness; that slope implies\r\nmotion in water, and that there is no absolute retention of water in\r\nthe outer bank of a dam having its base below the plane indicated by\r\nthe loss of head in passing through the inner bank and then through a\r\nfurther obstruction of either masonry or puddle; that there is simply a\r\npartial retention, with motion through the bank governed by the degree\r\nof porosity of the material.\r\n\r\nFig. 19 is a graphical interpretation of the conclusion reached by the\r\nboard of experts, as already given on page 41. “A” is an ideal profile\r\nof a homogeneous dam with the inner slope 3 on 1 and the outer slope 2\r\non 1. The top width is made 25 ft. for a dam having 90 ft. effective\r\nhead, the high-water surface in the reservoir being 10 ft. below the\r\ncrest of the dam. This ideal profile is a fair average of all the earth\r\ndams of the world. Not having a core wall to augment the loss of head,\r\nit fairly represents what might be expected of such a dam built of\r\nCroton Valley material, compacted in the usual way. It should be noted\r\nthat the intersection of the plane of saturation with the rear slope of\r\nthe dam at such high elevation as shown indicates an excessive seepage\r\nand a dangerously unstable condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Study of Profile for Dam.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary calculations for designing a profile for an earth dam\r\nare simple and will here be illustrated by an example. Let us assume\r\nthe following values:\r\n\r\n    a. Central height of dam, 100 ft.\r\n\r\n    b. Maximum depth of water, 90 ft., with surface 10 ft. below\r\n       crest of dam.\r\n\r\n    c. Effective head, 90 ft.\r\n\r\n    d. Weight of water, 62.5 lbs. per cu. ft.\r\n\r\n    e. Weight of material, 125 lbs. per cu. ft.\r\n\r\n    f. Coefficient of friction, 1.00, or equal to the weight.\r\n\r\n    g. Factor of safety against sliding, 10.\r\n\r\n    The width corresponding to the vertical pressure of 1 ft. is,\r\n    (62.5 × 10)/125 = 5 ft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.–GRAPHICAL INTERPRETATION OF STUDIES OF BOARD OF\r\nEXPERTS ON THE ORIGINAL EARTH PORTION OF THE NEW CROTON DAM.]\r\n\r\nThe hydrostatic pressure per square foot at 90 ft. depth is, 62.5 × 90\r\n= 5,625 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe dam, having a factor of safety of 10, must present a resistance of,\r\n5,625 × 10 = 56,250 lbs., or 28 tons per square foot.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical width of bank corresponding to 90 ft. head and a factor\r\nof 10 is shown by the dotted triangle (A-B-B) to be 450 ft., (B, Fig.\r\n19) with slopes 2½ on 1.\r\n\r\nTo this must be added the width due to the height of crest above the\r\nwater surface in the reservoir and the width of crest.\r\n\r\nThe former would be, 2 (2½ × 10) = 50 ft., and the latter by\r\nTrautwine’s rule, 2 + 2√100 = 22 ft., giving a total base width of 522\r\nft.\r\n\r\nLet us now assume that the slope of saturation may be 35 ft. per 100\r\nft. We observe that this intersects the base 40 ft. within the outer\r\ntoe of the bank slope. If the plane of saturation was 33 ft. per 100,\r\nit would just reach the outer toe. It would be advisable to enlarge\r\nthis section by adding a 10-ft. berm at the 50-ft. level, having a\r\nslope not less than 3 on 1 for the up-stream face, and two 15-ft. berms\r\non the down-stream face, having slopes 2½ on 1. The additional width\r\nof base due to these modifications in our profile amounts to 65 ft.,\r\ngiving a total base width of 587 ft., and increasing the factor of\r\nsafety from 10 to 13. It should be remembered that if the bank becomes\r\nsaturated this factor of safety may be reduced 50%, the coefficient of\r\nmoist clay being 0.50.\r\n\r\nThe loss of head due to a core wall of masonry, as designed for the\r\nNew Croton Dam, was assumed by the board of experts to be 21 ft., or\r\n17% of the depth of water in full reservoir. It has been stated by\r\nseveral authorities that the primary object of a masonry core wall is\r\nto afford a water-tight cut-off to any water of percolation which may\r\nreach it through the upper half of the embankment. It appears that\r\nabsolute water-tightness in the core wall is not obtained, although the\r\ncore walls of the Croton dams are said to be “the very best quality of\r\nrubble masonry that can be made.”\r\n\r\nMr. W. W. Follett, who is reported to have had considerable experience\r\nin building earth dams, and who has made some valuable suggestions\r\nthereupon, is emphatic in saying,\r\n\r\n    that the junction of earth and masonry forms a weak point, that\r\n    either a puddle or masonry core in an earthen dam is an element\r\n    of weakness rather than strength.\r\n\r\nHe also thinks the usual manner of segregating and depositing\r\nmaterials different in density and weight, and thus subject to\r\ndifferent amounts of settlement, as bad a form of construction as could\r\nbe devised.\r\n\r\nCore walls may prevent “free passage of water” and “excessive seepage,”\r\nbut are nevertheless of doubtful expediency.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarthwork Slips and Drainage.\r\n\r\nMr. John Newman, in his admirable treatise on “Earthwork Slips and\r\nSubsidences upon Public Works,” classifies and enumerates slips as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Natural causes, 7.\r\n    Artificial causes, 31.\r\n    Additional causes due to impounded water, 7.\r\n\r\nAfter describing each cause he presents 39 different means used to\r\nprevent such slips and describes methods of making repairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. L. Strange has had such a large and valuable experience and has\r\nset forth so carefully and lucidly both the principles and practice of\r\nearth dam construction, that the writer takes pleasure in again quoting\r\nhim on the subject of _drainage_, of which he is an ardent advocate. He\r\nsays that,\r\n\r\n    thorough drainage of the base of a dam is a matter of vital\r\n    necessity, for notwithstanding all precautions, some water will\r\n    certainly pass through the puddle.\r\n\r\nIt is at the junction of the dam with the ground that the maximum\r\namount of leakage may be expected. The percolating water should be\r\ngotten out as quickly as possible. The whole method of dealing with\r\nslips may be summed up in one word–_drainage_.\r\n\r\nThe proper presentation of these two phases of our subject would in\r\nitself require a volume. The interested reader is therefore referred to\r\nthe different authorities and writers cited in Appendix II.\r\n\r\n\r\nJerome Park Reservoir Embankments.\r\n\r\nThe Jerome Park reservoir is an artificial basin involving the\r\nexcavation and removal of large quantities of soil, and the erection of\r\nlong embankments with masonry core walls, partly founded on rock and\r\npartly on sand. The plan and specifications call for an embankment 20\r\nft. wide on top, with both slopes 2 on 1, and provide for lining the\r\ninner slope with brick or stone laid in concrete, and for covering the\r\nbottom with concrete laid on good earth compacted by rolling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section at Sta. 99.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section at Sta. 76+20.\r\n\r\nFIG. 20.–GRAPHICAL EXHIBIT OF STUDIES OF JEROME PARK RESERVOIR\r\nEMBANKMENT.]\r\n\r\nWherever bed rock was not considered too deep below the surface the\r\ncore walls were built upon it. In other places the foundation was\r\nplaced 8 to 10 ft. below the bottom of the reservoir and rested upon\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the plans of the Jerome Park embankment were changed\r\nfrom their original design, prior to the report of the board of\r\nexperts, on account of two alleged defects, namely, “cracks in the core\r\nwall” and “foundation of quicksand,” and incidentally on account of the\r\nsupposed instability of the inner bank.\r\n\r\nIn describing the materials on which these embankments rest the experts\r\nremarked\r\n\r\n    that all these fine sands are unstable when mechanically\r\n    agitated in an excess of water, and that they all settle in\r\n    a firm and compact mass under the water when the agitation\r\n    ceases. That they are quite unlike the true quicksands whose\r\n    particles are of impalpable fineness and which are “quick”\r\n    or unstable under water.\r\n\r\nFig. 20 is a graphic exhibit of the results of tests made at “Station\r\n76 + 20,” and at “Station 99,” to determine the flow line of water in\r\nthe sand strata underlying the embankment and bottom of the Jerome Park\r\nreservoir.\r\n\r\nThe experts reported that there was no possible danger of sliding or\r\nsloughing of the bank; that the utmost that could be expected would\r\nbe the percolation of a small amount of water through the embankment\r\nand the earth; and that this would be carried off by the sewers in the\r\nadjacent avenues; that a large expenditure to prevent such seepage\r\nwould not be warranted nor advisable.\r\n\r\nIn concluding their report, however, they recommended changing the\r\ninner slope of 2 on 1 to 2½ on 1, and doubling the thickness of the\r\nconcrete lining at the foot of the slope to preclude all possibility\r\nof the sliding or the slipping of the inner bank in case of the water\r\nbeing lowered rapidly in the reservoir.\r\n\r\nMr. W. R. Hill, then chief engineer of the Croton Aqueduct Commission,\r\nfavored extending the core walls to solid rock. He took exception to\r\nthe manner of obtaining samples of sand by means of pipe and force-jet\r\nof water, claiming that only the coarsest sand was obtained for\r\nexamination. He did not consider fine sand through which three men\r\ncould run a ¾-in. rod 19 and 20 ft. to rock without use of a hammer,\r\nvery stable material upon which to build a wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Dike of the Wachusett Reservoir, Boston.\r\n\r\nThe North Dike of the Wachusett Reservoir is another large public work\r\nin progress at the present time. It is of somewhat unusual design\r\nand the preliminary investigations and experiments which led to its\r\nadoption are interesting in the extreme.[3]\r\n\r\nThe area to be explored in determining the best location for the dike\r\nwas great, and the preliminary investigations conducted by means of\r\nwash drill borings, very extensive. A total of 1,131 borings were made\r\nto an average depth of 83 ft., the maximum depth being 286 ft. The\r\nmaterials were classified largely by the appearance of the samples,\r\nthough chemical and filtration tests were also made. The plane of the\r\nground water was from 35 to 50 ft. below the surface, and the action of\r\nthe water-jet indicated in a measure the degree of permeability of the\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these tests experimental dikes of different materials,\r\nand deposited in different ways, were made in a wooden tank 6 ft. wide,\r\n8 ft. high and 60 ft. long. The stability of soils when in contact with\r\nwater was experimented with, as shown in Fig. 21, in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\nAn embankment (Fig. 21) was constructed in the tank of the material to\r\nbe experimented with, 2 ft. wide on top, 6 ft. high, with slopes 2 on\r\n1, and water admitted on both sides to a depth of 5 ft. The top was\r\ncovered with 4-in. planks 2 ft. long and pressure applied by means of\r\ntwo jack screws resting upon a cross beam on top of the planks.\r\n\r\nWith a pressure of three tons per square foot, the 4-in. planks were\r\nforced down into the embankment a little more than 6 ins., resulting\r\nin a very slight bulging of the slopes a little below the water level.\r\nImmediately under the planks the soil became hard and compact. A man’s\r\nweight pushed a sharp steel rod, ¾-in. in diameter, only 6 to 8 ins.\r\ninto the embankment where the pressure was applied, while outside of\r\nthis area the rod was easily pushed to the bottom of the tank.\r\n\r\nThese results corroborate in a general way the practical experience of\r\nthe author, both in compressed embankments, where he found it necessary\r\nto use a pick vigorously to loosen the material of which they were\r\ncomposed, and in embankments made by merely dumping the material from\r\na track, in which case the earth is so slightly compressed that an\r\nexcavation is easily made with a shovel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.–CAN FOR DETERMINING FRICTIONAL RESISTANCE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.\r\n\r\nFIGS. 21 TO 24.–EXPERIMENTAL DIKES AND CYLINDER EMPLOYED IN STUDIES FOR\r\nTHE NORTH DIKE OF THE WACHUSETT RESERVOIR; AND (FIG. 25) CROSS-SECTION\r\nOF THE DIKE.]\r\n\r\nThe difference in the coefficient of friction of the same material\r\nwhen dry and when wet greatly modifies the form of slope. The harder\r\nand looser the particles, the _straighter_ will be the slope line in\r\nexcavation and slips. The greater the cohesion of the earth, the _more\r\ncurved_ will be the slope, assuming a parabolic curve near the top–the\r\ntrue form of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nRATE OF FILTRATION.–The rate of filtration through different soils was\r\nexperimented with by forming a dike in the tank previously mentioned,\r\nas shown in Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nThe dike was made full 8 ft. high, 7 ft. wide on top, with a slope on\r\nthe up-stream side of 2 on 1, and on the down-stream side 4 on 1. This\r\ngave a base width of 55 ft. Immediately over the top of the dike there\r\nwas placed 3 ft. of soil to slightly consolidate the top of the bank\r\nand permit the filling of the tank to the top without overflowing the\r\ndike. The water pressure in different parts of the dike was determined\r\nby placing horizontal pipes through the soil crosswise of the tank.\r\nThese pipes were perforated and covered with wire gauze, being\r\nconnected to vertical glass tubes at their ends. The end of the slope\r\non the down-stream side terminated in a box having perforated sides and\r\nfilled with gravel, thus enabling the water to percolate and filter out\r\nof the bank without carrying the soil with it.\r\n\r\nWhen the soil was shoveled loosely into the tank, without consolidation\r\nof any kind, it settled on becoming saturated and became quite compact.\r\nIt took five days for the water to appear in the sixth gauge pipe near\r\nthe lower end of the tank. After the pressure, which was maintained\r\nconstant, had been on for several weeks, the seepage amounted to one\r\ngallon in 22 minutes. When the soil was deposited by shoveling into the\r\nwater, the seepage amounted to one gallon in 34 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe relative filtering capacities of soils and sands were thought to\r\nbe better determined by the use of galvanized iron cylinders of known\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nFig. 23 shows one of the cylinders. These latter experiments confirmed\r\nthose previously made at Lawrence, by Mr. Allen Hazen, for the\r\nMassachusetts State Board of Health. They showed that the loss of head\r\nwas directly proportioned to the quantity of water filtered and that\r\nthe quantity filtered will vary as the square of the diameter of the\r\n_effective size_ of the grains of the filtering material.[4]\r\n\r\nThe material classed as “permeable” at the North Dike of the Wachusett\r\nReservoir has an effective diameter of about 0.20 mm. A few results are\r\ngiven in the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\nAmount of Filtration in Gallons per Day, Through an Area of 10,000 Sq.\r\nFt., With a Loss of Head or Slope of 1 ft. in 10 ft.\r\n\r\n        Material.

The soil was rammed in 3-in. layers, and special care taken\r\nto prevent water from following along the sides and bottom of the tank.\r\nOne end was filled with water to near the top, while the other end gave\r\na free outlet.\r\n\r\nAfter this experiment had been continued for more than a month, the\r\namount of seepage averaged 1.7 gallons per 24 hours, or about 32 drops\r\nper minute.\r\n\r\nFiltration tests were also made through soil under 150 ft. head, or 5\r\nlbs. per sq. in., with results not materially different, it is stated,\r\nfrom those already given. The soil used in all these tests contained\r\nfrom 4 to 8% by weight of organic matter. This was burned and similar\r\ntests made with the incinerated soil, resulting in an increase of about\r\n20% more seepage water.\r\n\r\nPERMANENCE OF SOILS.–This last material experimented with suggests the\r\nsubject of _permanence_ of soils. This was reported upon separately and\r\nindependently by Mr. Allen Hazen and Prof. W. O. Crosby. These experts\r\nagreed in their conclusion, stating\r\n\r\n    that the process of oxidation below the line of saturation would be\r\n    extremely slow, requiring many thousands of years for the complete\r\n    removal of all the organic matter, and that the tightness of the\r\n    bank would not be materially affected by any changes which are\r\n    likely to occur.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked,\r\n\r\n    that of all the materials used in the construction of\r\n    dams, _earth_ is physically the least destructible of\r\n    any. The other materials are all subject to more or less\r\n    disintegration, or change in one form or another, and in\r\n    earth they reach their ultimate and most lasting form.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the North Dike of the Wachusett Reservoir, Mr. Stearns\r\nremarked that,\r\n\r\n    it was evident by the application of Mr. Hazen’s formula for\r\n    the flow of water through sands and gravels, that the very\r\n    fine sands found at a considerable depth below the surface\r\n    would not permit enough water to pass through them if a dike\r\n    of great width were constructed, to cause a serious loss of\r\n    water, and it was also found that the soil, which contained\r\n    not only the fine particles or organic matter, but also a\r\n    very considerable amount of fine comminuted particles, which\r\n    the geologist has termed “rock flour,” would be sufficiently\r\n    impermeable to be used as a substitute for clay puddle.\r\n\r\nFig. 25 shows the maximum section of the North Dike with its cut-off\r\ntrench.

K. Martin.\r\nConstruction was begun in 1864, and the dam was finished in 1870. Mr.\r\nAlfred M. Quick, present chief engineer of the water-works of the\r\nCity of Baltimore has given a very lucid description of this work in\r\nEngineering News of Feb. 20, 1902.\r\n\r\nFig. 26 is a cross-section of this dam, showing the method of\r\nconstruction so clearly as to scarcely need further description. The\r\nbanks D-D on either side of the central puddle wall were carried up in\r\n6-in. layers with horses and carts, and kept about 2 ft. higher than\r\nthe puddle trench, which always contained water. The banks E-E were\r\nmade of dumped material, after which the basins F-F were first filled\r\nwith water and finally filled by dumping material into the water from\r\ntracks being moved in toward the center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26–WORKING CROSS-SECTION OF DRUID LAKE DAM.]\r\n\r\nAfter reaching the top of this fill, banks B-B-B were built up in\r\nlayers similar to D-D. The second set of basins C-C were then filled\r\nin a manner similar to F-F. The remaining portion A-A was constructed\r\nin layers like D-D and B-B, with the addition of compacting each layer\r\nwith a heavy roller.\r\n\r\nFinally the inner face slope was carried up in 3-in. layers and\r\nthoroughly rolled, after which 2 ft. of “good puddle” was put upon the\r\ninner slope the latter was rip-rapped, the crown covered with gravel\r\nand the rear slope sodded.\r\n\r\nSome years after completion, a driveway was built along the outer\r\nslope, as shown, which had a tendency to strengthen the dam, though not\r\ndesigned expressly for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to know that the influent, effluent and drain pipes\r\nwere originally constructed through or under the embankment. These\r\npipes were laid upon solid earth, and where they passed through the\r\npuddle wall were supported upon stone piers 6 ft. apart. As might be\r\nexpected, they soon cracked badly and were finally abandoned, new ones\r\nbeing placed in the original ground at the south side of the lake. Mr.\r\nQuick states that so far as is known there has never been any evidence\r\nof a leak through the embankment during these 32 years of service.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Types of Dams; Bohio, Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nA brief description will now be given of three different dams designed\r\nfor Bohio, on the proposed Panama Canal. Mr. George S. Morison’s paper\r\nbefore the American Society of Civil Engineers, on “The Bohio Dam,”\r\nand the discussion thereon, especially that by Mr. F. P. Stearns, were\r\nquite fully reported in Engineering News for March 13 and May 8, 1902.\r\nIn constructing the Panama Canal it will be necessary to impound the\r\nwaters of the Chagres River, near Bohio, to maintain the summit level\r\nof this canal and supply water for lockage.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH DESIGN.–Fig. 27 is an enlarged section of the original\r\ndesign of the new French Co. This design has no core wall, but at\r\nthe up-stream toe a concrete wall was to be built across the river\r\nbetween the two lines of sheet-piling. At the down-stream toe a large\r\namount of riprap was to be placed to prevent destruction of the dam\r\nduring construction. In this case it would be necessary to construct\r\na temporary dam above and also to use the excavation for the locks\r\nas a flood spillway. This method would involve considerable risk to\r\nthe work, on account of the large volume of flood waters it might be\r\nnecessary to take care of during construction.\r\n\r\nISTHMIAN CANAL COMMISSION.–The dam proposed by the Isthmian Canal\r\nCommission is shown by Fig. 28. This was designed to be an absolutely\r\nwater-tight closure of the geological valley, by using a masonry core\r\nwall carried down to bed rock. The maximum depth being 129 ft., it was\r\nplanned to rest the concrete wall on a series of pneumatic caissons\r\nreaching to rock. The spaces between the caissons would be closed and\r\nmade water-tight. Both slopes of the earth embankment were to have\r\nhorizontal benches and be revetted with loose rock.\r\n\r\nMR. MORISON’S DESIGN.–To appreciate fully the object and aim of the\r\nthird design, Fig. 29, which may be called a new type, although similar\r\nin many respects to the North Dike of the Wachusett reservoir already\r\nillustrated and described, it should be stated that the equalized flow\r\nof the Chagres River is put at 1,000 cu. ft. per sec. Of this quantity\r\nit is estimated that 500 cu. ft. would be needed for lockage and 200\r\ncu. ft. for evaporation. This leaves 300 cu. ft. per sec. available for\r\nseepage and other losses or to be wasted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 27 TO 29.–DESIGNS FOR THE BOHIO DAM, PANAMA\r\nCANAL.]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that a scarcity of water is not in this instance\r\na condition demanding an absolutely water-tight dam. The amount of\r\nseepage permissible without endangering the stability of the structure\r\nis the real point now to be discussed.\r\n\r\nThe third design, which was proposed by Mr. Morison, is shown by Fig.\r\n29. The topography and configuration of this dam site is not unlike\r\nthat of the San Leandro Dam, California, soon to be described, while\r\nthe general design is similar, as has been remarked, to the North Dike\r\nof the Wachusett Reservoir.\r\n\r\nThis third design contemplates a compound structure, formed by two\r\nrock-fill dams situated about 2,120 ft. apart, with the intervening\r\nspace filled with loose rock, earth and other available material.\r\nImmediately below the upper and higher rock-fill dam, it is proposed\r\nto place across the canyon a puddle wall 50 ft. in width, resting over\r\ntwo lines of sheet-piling 30 ft. apart. This piling would probably not\r\nreach farther than 50 ft. below tidewater, the solid rock floor being\r\nabout 100 ft. deeper.\r\n\r\nMr. Morison made use of Mr. Hazen’s filtration formula for estimating\r\nthe rate and quantity of seepage through the permeable strata below the\r\ndam. This formula is:\r\n\r\n             h t + 10°\r\n    V = cd² –– ––––––\r\n             l   60\r\n\r\n    where\r\n\r\n    V = rate of flow in meters per day through the whole section.\r\n    c = constant varying from 450 to 1,200,\r\n        according to cleanness of the sand.\r\n    d = “effective size” of sand in mm.\r\n    h = head in feet.\r\n    l = length or distance water must pass.\r\n    t = temperature of the water (Fahr.)\r\n\r\nThis formula should be used only when the _effective sizes_ of sands\r\nare from 0.10 to 3.0 mm. and with _uniformity coefficients_ below\r\n5.0[5].\r\n\r\nMr. Morison used the following values: c = 1,000; d = 1.0 mm.; h = 90\r\nft.; l = 2,500 ft.; t = 90°; for the solution of this problem, and\r\nobtained a velocity of 0.002 ft. per sec. The bed of sand and gravel\r\nwas assumed to have a sectional area of 20,000 sq. ft. for 2,500 ft. in\r\nlength. This gives a seepage of 40 cu. ft. per sec.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the above rate of 0.002 ft. per sec., equivalent to\r\n1⅜ ins. per minute, or 7 ft. per hour, is not sufficient to move any of\r\nthe material. The velocity of water percolating through sand is found\r\nto vary directly as the head and inversely as the distance.\r\n\r\nThe value of “c” in the formula is larger for sands of filters\r\nfavorable for flow, and smaller for compacted materials and dams.\r\n\r\nMr. Morison thought it might be nearer the actual conditions to assume\r\nd = 0.50 mm.; c = 500; and l = 5,000 ft.; in which case the seepage\r\nwould only amount to 2.5 ft. per sec. In this last assumption the\r\n“effective size” of sand grains is 2½ times that classed as “permeable\r\nmaterial” at the North Dike of the Wachusett Reservoir.\r\n\r\nProf. Philipp Forchheimer, of Gratz, Austria, recommends the use of the\r\nformula,\r\n\r\n     h\r\n    ––– = a√ + b√²\r\n     l\r\n\r\nfor the percolation through soils between loam and loamy sand.\r\nSellheim, Masoni, Smreker, Kröber and other authorities on filtration\r\nuse still other formulas, to which the reader and student is referred\r\nfor further research.\r\n\r\nThe writer, having had occasion in his professional practice to study\r\nquite carefully the subject of ground waters, and their percolation\r\nor flow through different classes of materials and under varying\r\nconditions, is of the opinion that rarely does the cross-section of\r\na stream-channel, filled with sand, gravel and debris, present, even\r\napproximately, a homogeneous or uniform mass; and that there are,\r\nalmost without exception, strata of material much coarser and more\r\nporous than the general average. In other words, that it is extremely\r\ndifficult to arrive at a uniformity coefficient. It is unwise to place\r\nmuch reliance upon an estimated flow where this is the case. The\r\nformula may be used with confidence where the layers are artificially\r\nmade, and where there is no uncertainty regarding the uniform character\r\nof the material. In most natural channels there are distinct lines\r\nof flow, and under considerable hydrostatic head or pressure these\r\nlines of flow would surely enlarge. There is a wide difference between\r\npermissible and dangerously excessive percolation through an earth\r\nembankment. The local features, economical considerations and magnitude\r\nof the risks, all bear upon this question and must be considered for\r\neach particular case.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to compare the estimated cost of the three designs\r\nproposed for the Bohio Dam, based upon the same unit prices, as follows:\r\n\r\n    French Engineers’ design              $3,500,000\r\n    Isthmian Canal Commissioners’ design   8,000,000\r\n    Mr. Morison’s design                   2,500,000\r\n\r\nNo comments will be made upon these figures, further than to remark\r\nthat the successful building of a stable dam, accomplished by the use\r\nof an excessive quantity of materials and at a cost beyond reasonable\r\nrequirements, is mainly instructive as illustrating “how not to do it.”\r\nIt is creditable to execute substantial works at a reasonable cost,\r\nbut it reflects no credit upon any one to construct them regardless of\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n\r\nCombined Rock-fill and Earth Dam.\r\n\r\nFig. 30 shows a section of the Upper Pecos River Dam near Eddy, N. M.\r\n\r\nThis dam is quite fully described by Mr. Jas. D. Schuyler, in his\r\nrecent book on “Reservoirs for Irrigation, Water-Power and Domestic\r\nWater-Supply,” and need not be mentioned in this paper, further than\r\nto call attention to the combination of rock-fill and earth which\r\nconstitutes its particular type of construction. This type of dam is\r\nbelieved to be for many localities a very good one, but up to the\r\npresent time has only been adopted for dams of moderate height, under\r\n60 ft.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe San Leandro Dam, California.\r\n\r\nA section of the San Leandro Dam, near Oakland, Cal., is shown by\r\nFig. 31. This section was supplied by Mr. W. F. Boardman, hydraulic\r\nengineer, who superintended the construction of the dam, from his own\r\nprivate notes and data. It differs materially from sections heretofore\r\npublished, and is 5 ft. higher, thus making it rank as the highest\r\nearth dam in the world of which we have an authentic record.\r\n\r\nThe dam was commenced in 1874, and brought up to a height of 115 ft.\r\nabove the bed of the creek in 1898. At the present time it is 500 ft.\r\nin length on the crest and 28 ft. wide. The original width of the\r\nravine at the base of the dam was 66 ft. The present width of base\r\nfrom toe to toe of slopes is 1,700 ft. The height of embankment above\r\nthe original surface is 125 ft., with a puddle trench extending 30 ft.\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.–CROSS-SECTION OF UPPER PECOS RIVER DAM;\r\nCOMBINED ROCK FILL AND EARTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.–DEVELOPED SECTION OF SAN LEANDRO DAM.]\r\n\r\nAll that portion of the dam within a slope of 2½ on 1 at the rear and\r\n3 on 1 at the face is built of choice material, carefully selected and\r\nput in with great care. The portion outside of the 2½ on 1 slope line\r\nat the down-stream side of the dam, was _sluice in_ from the adjacent\r\nhills regardless of its character, and is composed of ordinary soil\r\ncontaining more or less rock.\r\n\r\nThis process of sluicing was carried on during the rainy season, when\r\nthere was an abundance of water, and it was intended to be continued\r\nuntil the canyon below the dam had been filled to an average slope of\r\n6.7 on 1 at the rear of the dam. It was thought that the location was\r\nparticularly favorable for this kind of construction, the original\r\nintention being to raise the dam from time to time, not only to\r\nincrease the storage as the demand for water increased, but to meet\r\nthe annual loss in capacity caused by the silting up of the reservoir\r\nbasin. The latter has amounted to about 1 ft. in depth per annum.\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF CONSTRUCTION.–Under the main body of the dam, the surface was\r\nstripped of all sediment, sand, gravel and vegetable matter. Choice\r\nmaterial, carefully selected, was then brought by carts and wagons and\r\nevenly distributed over the surface in layers about 1 ft. or less in\r\nthickness. This was sprinkled with just enough water to make it pack\r\nwell, not enough to make it like mud. During construction a band of\r\nhorses was led by a boy on horseback over the entire work, to compact\r\nthe materials and assist in making the dam one homogeneous mass. No\r\nrollers were used on this dam.\r\n\r\nThe central trench was cut 30 ft. below the original bed of the creek.\r\nIn the bottom of this trench three secondary trenches, 3 ft. wide by 3\r\nft. deep, were made and filled with concrete. These concrete walls were\r\ncarried up 2 ft. above the general floor of the trench, to break the\r\ncontinuity of its surface.\r\n\r\nThe original wasteway, constructed at the north end of the dam, has\r\nbeen practically abandoned, having been substituted by a tunnel of\r\nlarger capacity. The original wasteway was excavated in the bed rock\r\nof the natural hillside, and although lined with masonry, is not in\r\nthe best condition. The author considers its location an objectionable\r\nfeature, as menacing the safety of the dam, and thinks it should be\r\npermanently closed.\r\n\r\nA wasteway tunnel, 1,487 ft. in length, was constructed in 1888,\r\nthrough a ridge extending north of the dam. This has a sectional area\r\nof about 10×10 ft., lined with brick masonry throughout, having a grade\r\nof 2½%.\r\n\r\nThe criticism might be made of the tunnel that it is faulty in design\r\nat the entry or reservoir end, where the water must first fall over\r\na high spillway wall, aerating the water before entering the tunnel\r\nproper. The water even then has not easy access to the tunnel, and no\r\nadequate arrangements have been made for ventilation, so as to insure\r\nthe utilization of its maximum capacity. The maximum depth of water in\r\nthe reservoir is about 85 ft., and the full capacity 689,000,000 cu.\r\nft. of water. The catchment area is 43 square miles, and the surface\r\nof the reservoir when full 436 acres. The outlet pipes are placed in\r\ntwo tunnels at different elevations through the ridge north of the dam.\r\nThere are no culverts or pipes extending through the body of the dam\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\nHydraulic-fill Dams.\r\n\r\nNo discussion of earth dams would be complete without some reference\r\nbeing made to the novel type of construction developed in western\r\nAmerica in recent years, by which railroad embankments and water-tight\r\ndams are built up by the sole agency of water. The water for this\r\npurpose is usually delivered under high pressure, as it is generally\r\nconvenient to make it first perform the work of loosening the earth\r\nand rock in the borrow pit, as well as subsequently to transport them\r\nto the embankment, and there to sort and deposit them and finally part\r\ncompany with them after compacting them solidly in place, even more\r\nfirmly than if compressed by heavy rollers. Sometimes, however, water\r\nis delivered to the borrow pit without pressure, in which event the\r\nmaterials must be loosened by the plow or by pick and shovel by the\r\nprocess called ground sluicing in placer mining parlance.\r\n\r\nAn abundance of water delivered by gravity under high pressure is\r\nusually regarded as one of the essential factors in hydraulic-fill dam\r\nbuilding, but it is not essential that there be a large continuous\r\nflow. The Lake Frances Dam, recently constructed for the Bay Counties\r\nCo., of California, by J. D. Schuyler, is 75 ft. high, 1,340 ft. long\r\non top, and contains 280,000 cu. yds. The dam was built up by materials\r\nsluiced by water that was forced by a centrifugal pump through a 12-in.\r\npipe and 3-in. nozzle, against a high bank, whence the materials were\r\ntorn and conveyed by the water through flumes and pipes to the dam.\r\nAbout 6 cu. ft. per sec. of water was thus used, and at one stage of\r\nthe work the supply stream was reduced to less than 0.1 ft. per sec.,\r\nthe water being gathered in a pond and pumped over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on hydraulic-fill dams in Mr. Schuyler’s book on\r\n“Reservoirs for Irrigation” will be found to contain matter on the\r\nsubject interesting to those who desire to pursue it further, and the\r\nreader is again referred to that work.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Impervious Diaphragm in Earth Dams.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the recent extended discussion concerning the design\r\nof the New Croton Dam and the Jerome Park Reservoir embankments,\r\nthe Engineering News of Feb. 20, 1902, contained a very suggestive\r\neditorial entitled, “Concerning the Design of Earth Dams and Reservoir\r\nEmbankments.” The opinion is given that no type of structure that man\r\nbuilds to confine water can compare in permanence with earth dams,\r\nafter which the following pertinent questions are asked:\r\n\r\n    1. How shall an earth dam be made water-tight?\r\n\r\n    2. What is the office and purpose of the masonry core wall?\r\n\r\n    3. Would not a water-proof diaphragm of some kind be better\r\n       than a core wall of either masonry or puddle?\r\n\r\nThe article then suggests a number of designs of diaphragm construction,\r\nwith a special view of obtaining absolute water-tightness, by use of\r\nasphaltum, cement mortar, steel plates, etc. Special emphasis was put\r\nupon the _principle_ of constructing a water-proof diaphragm. The\r\nmatter of relative cost is advanced as an argument in favor of the\r\ndiaphragm principle as against the usual orthodox method. The saving in\r\ncost is to be accomplished by the use of inferior materials and less\r\ncare in the handling of them, or by both. It is suggested that almost\r\nany kind of material available, rock, sand or gravel, will answer\r\nevery purpose where good earth is not to be found. Further, that this\r\nmaterial may be dumped from the carts, cars or cableways, or be placed\r\nby the hydraulic-fill method.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes the diaphragm method of construction may have some\r\nmerits, but that it is attended by the very great risk of neglecting\r\nprinciples most vitally important to the successful construction of\r\nhigh earth dams, which will now be formulated and advanced, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_Conclusions._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer in concluding this study wishes to emphasize certain\r\nprinciples and apparently minor details of construction, which from\r\nobservation and personal experience, seem to him of vital importance.\r\n\r\nHe believes firmly in the truth contained in the following remarks by\r\nMr. Desmond FitzGerald, of Boston, germane to this subject:\r\n\r\n    An engineer must be guided by local conditions and the resources at\r\n    his command in building reservoir embankments. His design must be\r\n    largely affected by the nature of the materials. There are certain\r\n    _general principles_, however, which must be observed and which\r\n    will be applied by an engineer of skill, judgment and experience to\r\n    whatever design he may adopt. It is in the application of these\r\n    principles that the services of the professional man becomes\r\n    valuable, and it is from a lack of them, that there have been so\r\n    many failures.\r\n\r\nThe details and principles of construction, relating to high earth\r\ndams, may be summarized or stated in order of their application, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n(1) Select a firm, dry, impermeable foundation, or make it so by\r\nexcavation and drainage. All alluvial soil containing organic matter\r\nand all porous materials should be excavated and removed from the\r\ndam site when practicable; that is, where the depth to a suitable\r\nimpermeable foundation is not prohibitive by reason of excessive cost.\r\n\r\nWherever springs of water appear, they must be carried outside the\r\nlines of the embankment by means of bed rock drains, or a system of\r\npipes so laid and embedded as to be permanent and effective.\r\n\r\nThe drainage system must be so designed as to prevent the infiltration\r\nof water upward and into the lower half of the embankment, and at the\r\nsame time insure free and speedy outlet for any seepage water passing\r\nthe upper half. All drains should be placed upon bed rock or in the\r\nnatural formation selected for the foundation of the superstructure.\r\nThey should be constructed in such a manner as to prevent the flow\r\nof water outside the channel provided for it, and also prevent any\r\nenlargement of the channel itself. To this end, cement, mortar, broken\r\nstone, and good gravel puddle are the materials best suited for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n(2) Unite the body of the embankment to the natural foundation by means\r\nof an impervious material, durable and yet sufficiently elastic to bond\r\nthe two together. When the depth to a suitable foundation is great,\r\na central trench excavated with sloping sides, extending to bed rock\r\nor other impervious formation, refilled with good puddling material,\r\nproperly compacted, will suffice.\r\n\r\nWhen clayey earth is scarce and expensive to obtain, a small amount of\r\nclay puddle confined between walls of brick, stone or concrete masonry,\r\nand extending well into the body of the embankment and so built as\r\nto avoid settlement, will prevent excessive seepage. This form of\r\nconstruction is not to be carried much above the original surface of\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n(3) The continuity of surfaces should always be broken, at the same\r\ntime avoiding the formation of cavities and lines of cleavage. No\r\nexcavation to be refilled should have vertical sides, and long\r\ncontinuous horizontal planes should be intercepted by wedge-shaped\r\noffsets, enabling the dovetailing of materials together.\r\n\r\nAll loose and seamy rock or other porous material should be removed,\r\nand where the refill is not the best for the purpose, mix the good and\r\nbad ingredients thoroughly, after which deposit in very thin layers.\r\n\r\n(4) Make the dimensions and profile of dam with a factor of safety\r\nagainst sliding of not less than ten. The preliminary calculations for\r\ndesigning such a profile have been given on p. 42.\r\n\r\n(5) Aim at as nearly a homogeneous mass in the body of the embankment\r\nas possible, thus avoiding unequal settlement and deformation. This\r\nmanner of manipulating materials will eliminate many uncertain or\r\nunknown factors, but it means rigid inspection of the work and\r\nintelligent segregation of materials, no matter what method of\r\ntransporting them may be adopted. The smaller the unit loads may\r\nbe, the more easily a homogeneous distribution of materials will be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n(6) Select earthy materials in preference to organic soils, with a\r\nview of such combination or proportion of different materials as will\r\nreadily consolidate. _Consolidation is the most important process\r\nconnected with the building of an earth dam._ The judicious use of\r\nsoil containing a small percentage of organic matter may be permitted,\r\nhowever, when there is a lack of clayey material for mixing with sandy\r\nand porous earth materials. Such a mixture, properly distributed and\r\nwetted, will consolidate well under heavy pressure and prove quite\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n(7) Consolidation being the most important process and the only\r\nsafeguard against permeability and instability of form, use only the\r\namount of water necessary to attain this. Too much or too little are\r\nequally bad and to be avoided. It is believed that only by experiment\r\nand experience is it possible to determine just the proper quantity of\r\nwater to use with the different classes of materials and their varying\r\nconditions. In rolling and consolidating the bank, all portions that\r\nhave a tendency to quake must be removed at once and replaced with\r\nmaterial that will consolidate; it _must not_ be covered up, no matter\r\nhow small the area.\r\n\r\n(8) In an artificial embankment for impounding water it is\r\nimpracticable to place reliance upon time for consolidation; it _must_\r\nbe effected by mechanical means. Again we repeat, that consolidation is\r\nthe most vitally important operation connected with the building of an\r\nearth dam. When this is satisfactorily attained it is proof that the\r\nmaterials are suitable and that the other necessary details have been\r\nin a large measure complied with. Light rollers are worse than useless,\r\nbeing a positive harm, resulting in a smoothing or “ironing process,”\r\ndeceptive in appearance and detrimental in many ways.\r\n\r\nThe matter of supreme importance in the construction of earth dams is\r\nthat the greatest consolidation possible be specified and effected.\r\nTo this end it is necessary that heavy rollers be employed, and that\r\nsuch materials be selected as respond best to the treatment. There\r\nare certain kinds of earth materials which no amount of wetting and\r\nrolling will compact. These must be rejected as unfit for use in any\r\nportion of an earth dam. Let the design of the structure be ever so\r\ntrue to correct engineering principles, it is still necessary to give\r\nuntiring attention to the work of consolidation. It is therefore\r\naccording to the design of a thoroughly compacted homogeneous mass,\r\nrather than to the suggested _diaphragm type_, to which modern practice\r\nshould conform. This is in harmony with Nature’s own methods, and in\r\nconformity to correct principles.\r\n\r\n(9) Avoid placing pipes or culverts through any portion of the\r\nembankment. The writer considers it bad practice ever to place the\r\noutlet pipes through a high earth dam, and fails to see any necessity\r\nfor so doing.\r\n\r\n(10) The surface of the dam, both front and rear, must be suitably\r\nprotected against the deteriorating effects of the elements. This may\r\ninclude pitching the up-stream face, the riprap work at the toe of the\r\ninner slope, the roadway and covering of the crown, the sodding or\r\nother protection of the rear slope, and the construction of surface\r\ndrains for the berms.\r\n\r\n(11) Ample provision for automatic wasteways should be made for\r\nevery dam, so that the embankment can never under any circumstances\r\nbe over-topped by the impounded water. Earthquakes and seismic\r\ndisturbances will produce no disastrous effects upon an earth dam.\r\nIts elasticity will resist the shock of water lashing backwards and\r\nforwards in the reservoir.\r\n\r\n(12) Finally, provide for intelligent and honest supervision during\r\nconstruction, and insist upon proper care and maintenance ever\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\nHigh Earth Dams.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             –Embankment–   –––  Slopes  –––   Available\r\n    Name of Dam                Max.

P. Stearns,\r\nChief Engineer of the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board, in the\r\nProceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers for April, 1902.\r\nThe latter description was reprinted, with the omission of some of the\r\nillustrations, in Engineering News for May 8, 1902.\r\n\r\n[4] By effective size of sand grains is meant such size of grain that\r\n10% by weight of the particles are smaller, and 90% larger than itself;\r\nor, to express it a little differently, the effective size is equal\r\nto a sphere the volume of which is greater than ¹/₁₀ that forming the\r\nweight and is less than ⁹/₁₀ that forming the weight.\r\n\r\n[5] The term “uniformity coefficient” is used to designate the ratio\r\nof the size of the grain which has 60% of the sample finer than itself\r\nto the size which has 10% finer than itself. The method of determining\r\nthe size of sand grains and their uniformity coefficients, is fully\r\nexplained in Appendix 3 of Mr. Hazen’s book on “The Filtration of\r\nPublic Water Supplies.”",
