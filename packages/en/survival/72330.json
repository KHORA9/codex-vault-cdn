ARTHUR PEARSON, LIMITED\r\n  HENRIETTA STREET, W.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little book makes no profession to be a systematic text-book\r\nof Oceanography, or to contain exhaustive discussions of the latest\r\ndiscoveries and theories. The subject is far too vast to be so dealt\r\nwith in one small volume. A library would almost be needed for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nMuch information has been gained within the last decade or two of years\r\nabout the Ocean, its make, the laws which govern its movements, its\r\ndark and mysterious depths, the various deposits upon its bed, and the\r\ninnumerable living creatures by which it is inhabited. All that I have\r\nattempted has been to cull a certain number of leading facts from the\r\ngreat storehouse of knowledge, and to put them in order, for the many\r\nwho love sea-breezes and ocean-waves, and who may like to know a little\r\nmore about the friend whom they so often visit.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Authorities, I must acknowledge my indebtedness to the\r\nfollowing books, among many others: _The Realm of Nature_, by Dr. H.\r\nR. Mill; _Report of the Scientific Results of the Voyage of H.M.S.\r\nChallenger--Deep Sea; Coral Reefs_, by Professor Dana; _Standard\r\nNatural History_, edited by J. S. Kingsley; _The Microscope_, by\r\nCarpenter, revised edition; _British Merchant Service_, by R. J.\r\nCornwall-Jones; _Resources of the Sea_, by McIntosh; _Harvest of the\r\nSea_, by J. G. Bertram; also numerous papers and articles in the\r\n_Geographical Magazine_, _National Geographical Magazine_, _Scottish\r\nGeographical Magazine_, _Proceedings of Royal Society of Edinburgh_,\r\n_Annual Report of Smithsonian Institution_, _Natural Science_, etc.,\r\netc., by such writers as Sir John Murray, Dr. H. R. Mill, Professor\r\nJames Geikie, Albert Prince of Monaco, Admiral Sir W. H. L. Wharton,\r\nMr. John Milne, Mr. A. Günther, Mr. John Aitkin, etc.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I beg heartily to thank the Librarians of the Royal\r\nGeographical Society and the Zoological Society of London for the\r\ngenerous courtesy with which they have lent me books and supplied\r\nlatest information, without which this little book could never have\r\nbeen written; also to express my warm gratitude for the invaluable help\r\nafforded by the criticisms and suggestions of the kind and able friends\r\nwho have read my MS. and proofs.\r\n\r\n  WORTON HOUSE, EASTBOURNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                           PAGE\r\n      I. “THE SEA!

THE OPEN SEA!”\r\n\r\n  “How cheery are the mariners,\r\n    Those lovers of the sea,\r\n  Their hearts are like its yesty waves,\r\n    As bounding and as free.”--P. BENJAMEN.\r\n\r\n “Therefore also do men entrust their lives to a little piece of wood.”\r\n       _Wisd. of Sol._ xiv. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, over two thousand years ago, our ancestors lived in a\r\ncountry smaller than ours, to the north-east.\r\n\r\nThey had not yet taken possession of two Isles, which in the then\r\ndistant future were to become the Headquarters of a world-wide Empire.\r\nAlready one characteristic of the race was prominent; they delighted in\r\nthe Sea. Within their small limits of power they ranged the Ocean, they\r\nwrestled with its fury, they subdued it to their will, they rejoiced in\r\nits strength, they found often their graves beneath its surface. The\r\nEnglish then, as now, were Ocean-folk.\r\n\r\nMay it not be that we in modern days love the sea, and flock to\r\nits shores, and carry our Flag to its furthest bounds, because our\r\nforefathers, the Norsemen, the Angles, the ancient Vikings, found their\r\njoy in it? Their march, like ours, was on the mountain-wave; their\r\nHome, like ours, was on the deep.\r\n\r\nProbably with them, as with us, it was not always an unchastened joy.\r\nEven a hardy Viking might know the unpleasant consequences of Ocean’s\r\nrougher moods. But no such discomforts drove him to stay ashore.\r\n\r\nHad our forefathers been made of feebler stuff, had they been easily\r\nchecked in their enterprises, centuries of history must have been\r\nchanged. The development of English nature would have followed other\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nIn those days the fight could not but be severe. No mighty ironclads,\r\nno huge three-deckers, existed. No P. and O. liners, no great merchant\r\nships ranged the seas. Our forefathers tackled the waste of waters with\r\nwhat we should consider the merest cockleshells. Even in these days we\r\nknow what is meant by “perils of the seas;” but in those days the term\r\nmust have carried a hundred-fold deeper meaning, both to the brave\r\nfellows who ventured on the stormy main, and to the waiting wives and\r\nmothers on land.\r\n\r\nAll the more honour to them that they were not daunted. Each man’s\r\nvictory or failure in life’s battle cannot but help to shape the course\r\nwhich his descendants in future ages will pursue.\r\n\r\nThe Sea for us has a vivid personality. We know grand old Neptune so\r\nwell, with his trident and his snowy hair, his dashing waves and his\r\nimpenetrable depths, his gentle breezes and his furious gales, his\r\nmoods of mild serenity and his fits of vehement wrath. He has his\r\nfaults; but in spite of all we love him.\r\n\r\nAt one time the Sea was for men a type of the Infinite, of the\r\nImmeasurable, of the Boundless. We use still the same words; but they\r\nhave lost some of their force.\r\n\r\nIn these days the whole ocean has been mapped out from shore to shore.\r\nWe know exactly what countries lie round each part of it. We can tell\r\nhow long and how wide it is in any direction. As we stand on the shore,\r\nand talk of the “boundless ocean,” we are perfectly well aware that\r\nwe are looking across to France or Spain, to Germany or Ireland or\r\nAmerica. Grand and far-reaching the sea still is, but to us no longer\r\n“boundless.”\r\n\r\nIn ages gone by, those who stood upon the coasts of Palestine or Egypt,\r\nof Greece or Italy, gazed towards unknown horizons, across what was\r\nto them an illimitable ocean. The civilised world consisted of a few\r\ncountries bordering the Mediterranean on the east; and those countries\r\nshaded off into unexplored barbaric regions. As for the “great Sea,”\r\nas they called that which we regard as hardly more than a huge inland\r\nlake, it was in their eyes the embodiment of Infinitude.\r\n\r\nAt a very early period, long before the English Nation was dreamt of,\r\nbefore the Roman Empire had grown into being, while the polished Greek\r\nof the future was still a semi-savage, a nation of Ocean-lovers already\r\nexisted. These were the Phenicians, foreshadowing in their pluck and\r\nenterprise the sea-going British of later times.\r\n\r\nThey, unlike the sailors of other nations, did not merely hug the\r\nshore, but ventured out into the trackless ocean. They, unlike the\r\nsailors of other nations, did not go upon the sea only in daylight, but\r\nthey traversed it also in the dark hours of night.\r\n\r\nAt first they were content with the nearer reaches of the Indian Ocean,\r\nand with the more eastern parts of the Mediterranean. But gradually\r\nthey wandered farther. Colony after colony was planted beyond Egypt,\r\ntill they reached the Pillars of Hercules, known to us as the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar, to face a wild and strange Ocean, full of mystery.\r\n\r\nThere they made a startling discovery, enough to impress the more\r\nthoughtful minds among them. Far to the east, in the “Indian Ocean” of\r\nour days, their sailors had been acquainted with high and low tides;\r\nwhile throughout the Mediterranean scarcely any tides existed. But in\r\nthe open sea, outside the narrow Channel, they found the very same\r\ntidal changes as in the eastern ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be supposed that any one of them had a mind of such\r\nfar-seeing grasp that he should be able to conjecture the grand truth\r\nof eastern and western oceans being ONE--swayed by the same influences,\r\ngoverned by the same laws.\r\n\r\nA Phenician of those days, catching a glimpse of this truth, would have\r\nbeen worthy to take rank beside our Sir Isaac Newton of after days.\r\nThey are believed to have observed the coincidence; no doubt with a\r\nfeeling of wonder; and probably it was to them merely a coincidence.\r\nVery little was then understood of the most everyday and commonplace\r\nworkings of Nature.\r\n\r\nNot much, indeed, can be said with certainty of what the Phenicians did\r\ntruly discover. Some observations they must have made of the heavenly\r\nconstellations; and the Pole-star at least must have been known to\r\nthem, otherwise it is impossible to imagine how they could have steered\r\ntheir vessels at night, in an age when the Mariner’s Compass was\r\nunknown. They are supposed to have sailed far south on the west coast\r\nof Africa, if they did not actually round the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that their knowledge was passed on to the Greek\r\nnation. Either they were curiously reticent of what they knew, or else\r\nsuch records as they may have left were destroyed and forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn after times the Carthaginians, descendants of Phenician Colonists,\r\nwere, like their forefathers, sea-lovers, sea-explorers, searching\r\nthe main, not as travellers search now from pure love of knowledge,\r\nor from a liking for adventure, but for the sake of commerce. The\r\nCarthaginians, however, instead of being able to make use of previous\r\ndiscoveries, and to work onwards from a point already gained, had to\r\nstart afresh and to find their way--just as if it had never been found\r\nbefore--to and beyond the Pillars of Hercules.\r\n\r\nTo the Greek imagination that wide mysterious Ocean, opening out from\r\nthe narrow Strait, was unattractive and terrible. It was a sea of\r\nlimitless distances, of fog and gloom, of blackness and death; not an\r\nunexplored Ocean of possible glory and beauty and wealth.\r\n\r\nTime glided by, and man advanced in his acquaintance with Land and Sea;\r\nbut with the latter slowly. It was not until five centuries ago--and\r\nfive centuries are but as a day, compared with the full stretch of\r\nhistory--that two weighty steps were taken.\r\n\r\nOne step was southward. One step was westward.\r\n\r\nThe African Continent, all along its northern region, had been the\r\nscene of very old-world history. But the south was shrouded in\r\ndarkness. A brief glimmer of light, perhaps thrown there in Phenician\r\ndays, had been long long lost sight of.\r\n\r\nIn the year A.D. 1486, a far leap from Phenician and Grecian days,\r\nBartholomew Diaz made discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, and one year\r\nlater Vasco da Gama sailed round it. These two explorers were only a\r\nlittle in advance of two greater voyagers. In 1492 Christopher Columbus\r\nstarted on his first cruise into the unknown West--and touched Land.\r\nLess than thirty years later, Magellan’s famous voyage was accomplished\r\nto those Straits, between Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, which bear\r\nhis name. By that time the existence of the American Continent had\r\nbecome an established fact.\r\n\r\nBut that Continent had to be searched out. And the Ocean, though its\r\nlimits were widened in men’s imaginations, was very far from being\r\nmapped and fenced around with definite boundaries. Years of exploration\r\nstill lay ahead; and many a valiant explorer had to fall a martyr in\r\nthe cause of Science, before mystery should yield to knowledge.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, in those days as in these, there was always somebody to ask,\r\n“But what is the use? What good can it do to us to learn that there are\r\nlands beyond the sea? What shall we gain by it all?”\r\n\r\nTime alone, with its developments, with the growth of the human race,\r\nwith the enormous possibilities then undreamt-of, could answer such\r\nquestionings. Happily, brave explorers have seldom been lacking,\r\nwho loving knowledge for its own sake have been content to labour\r\npatiently, not for money, not for fame, not for immediate results, but\r\nfor the simple delight of better understanding the world around them,\r\nand for the benefit of future generations.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, if once we begin clearly to realise that the things which\r\nwe see and hear, the wonders of Land and Ocean, are the outcome and\r\nexpression of Divine Thought, we shall scarcely deem time wasted, which\r\nis spent in trying to find out a little more about those wonders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  SALT WATER\r\n\r\n  “The new sight, the new wondrous sight,\r\n    The waters around me turbulent.”\r\n        E. B. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n  “Water, water, everywhere,\r\n    And not a drop to drink.”--S. T. COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual stampede of Britons to the coast says much for our National\r\nbelief in Sea-breezes. In other countries also people go to the sea for\r\nchange; but perhaps nowhere does the rush excel that on our Island.\r\nThis revivifying gift, though partly due to the wide and free expanse\r\nthrough which the breezes have travelled, is largely owing to the briny\r\nocean with which they have been in contact.\r\n\r\nSea-water differs from rain-water, well-water, river-water. True, it is\r\nmade up of all these, since sooner or later and in one mode or another\r\nall water on Earth finds its way to the Ocean. Water may travel openly\r\nby river-routes; it may creep silently by dark and devious underground\r\npassages; it may float lightly _viâ_ cloudland; but in any case its\r\ngoal is the sea.\r\n\r\nStill, though the ocean includes in its composition every kind of\r\nland-water, Sea-water as such is different from them all. Not only in\r\nits vast extent, in its enormous depth, but in its strong flavour of\r\nSalt.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest of substances is Salt. It is in the ground, in\r\nair, in water. We even know that it does not belong to our earth alone,\r\nbut to many heavenly bodies also.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one reason for this abundance, at least upon our Earth, is\r\nthat it is necessary for life. There is salt in the make of blood and\r\nof brain, of muscle and of tendon. Salt is perpetually passing out of\r\na man’s body; therefore continual fresh supplies of it are needed.\r\nWithout a certain amount of salt in his food, he cannot keep in good\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThis at one time was not understood; and salt was looked upon as a mere\r\nluxury, easily to be dispensed with. Condemned criminals were forbidden\r\nthat luxury; and they went through a good deal of suffering, the reason\r\nfor which was not guessed. If plenty of animal and vegetable food was\r\ngiven to them, they managed to get along, since both contain salt; but\r\nif they were kept on purely farinaceous fare, they broke down.\r\n\r\nWhere all the salt in the Ocean comes from, is a complex question.\r\nLarge supplies are brought down annually by rivers and streams, from\r\nvarious minerals in their beds, as well as from rock-salt regions. But\r\nif we ask, “How comes the rock-salt to be there?” we are told that it\r\nis a deposit, once formed beneath ocean-waters, or at least left by\r\nthe drying up of salt lakes and seas. A proof of the latter theory is\r\nfound in multitudes of sea-shells, often distributed through layers of\r\nrock-salt.\r\n\r\nIf much sea-salt came originally from rock-salt on land, and if\r\nrock-salt came originally from ocean-deposits, we are led into a\r\ncurious circle of cause and effect--not unlike that of oak and acorn,\r\nor of hen and egg, with the attendant puzzle of--Which first? It is a\r\nquery which we are not able to answer.\r\n\r\nIn former days the salt used for household and mercantile purposes was\r\nalmost entirely prepared by the evaporation of sea-water. We no longer\r\ndepend on this, however; and in England the sea-salt trade has gone\r\ndown greatly before that of rock-salt, which is found to be the better\r\nfor table use. It has not the same tendency to stick together in\r\nlumps, after being packed in sacks.\r\n\r\nGreat districts of rock-salt are found in many places--such as those\r\nin the Carpathian Mountains, in the Swiss Alps, in Germany, and in\r\nGreat Britain. One huge mine in Galicia has been worked for six hundred\r\nyears; and this supply is said to reach through about five hundred\r\nmiles. From British works alone the quantity carried away every year\r\namounts to a cubic mile of salt.\r\n\r\nBut land-supplies grow pale and insignificant before the quantities\r\nwhich float in the ocean. It has been reckoned that, if the waters of\r\nthe whole ocean could be dried up, the amount of salt left lying on the\r\nocean-bed would be something like four-and-a-half millions of cubic\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nSuch an enormous mass hardly conveys a clear idea. Let us think of one\r\nsingle cubic mile of sea-water, separated from the ocean, and see how\r\nmuch it would contain. First, the whole of that cubic mile of water has\r\nto be dried up; and then the materials left behind have to be weighed.\r\nWe should find about thirty-three millions of tons of various kinds\r\nof substances, the names of which need not be given. We should also\r\nfind of common salt a supply which, when weighed, would reach the great\r\nfigure of _one hundred and seventeen millions of tons_. All this, be it\r\nremembered, floating unseen in a single cubic mile of water. No wonder\r\nthe sea tastes salt.\r\n\r\nIn its make Water is always the same. Whether it be cold or hot,\r\nfreezing or boiling, causes no difference. It consists of two gases,\r\nunited; and the union is remarkable in kind. The two gases are not\r\nmerely mixed together, as sand and sugar may be mixed. They are by the\r\nunion changed into a fresh substance. For the time the gases exist no\r\nlonger. In their stead, water has been formed.\r\n\r\nAnd when the gases enter into this very close relationship, they do it\r\nalways in the same manner. There is just so much of the one, and just\r\nso much of the other. One portion of hydrogen has to join with eight\r\ntimes as much by weight of oxygen--neither more nor less of either. The\r\nsame is true, whether we are speaking of a great mass of water, or of\r\nthe tiniest speck.\r\n\r\nIt is not actually correct to say, as is said above, that water\r\n“consists” of the two gases. So long as the water exists, the gases do\r\nnot exist. And when, through the action of heat or electricity, the\r\nwater is broken up and the gases reappear, then the water no longer\r\nexists. But at least we may say that it is the result of the uniting of\r\nthose two gases, and that it can be made in no other way.\r\n\r\nAn interesting experiment has been tried. A certain amount of hydrogen\r\ngas and eight times as much of oxygen gas were weighed separately, by\r\nmeans of very delicate instruments. Then through great heat the two\r\nwere caused to unite into water, and the water also was weighed. It\r\nwas found to be just as heavy as the two gases together had been; and\r\nquite naturally so, since neither of the two gases had lost or gained\r\nin weight. This kind of union is called “chemical.”\r\n\r\nFrench people are fond of “eau sucré.” A lump of sugar is dropped into\r\na glass of water, and it disappears. But it has not been destroyed.\r\nIt has not ceased to be sugar. No mysterious union has taken place\r\nbetween the sugar and the water. Neither water nor sugar has changed\r\nits nature; and no fresh substance has come into existence in their\r\nstead. The water is there, as it was before. The sugar is there too,\r\nnot visible, but to be found out by our sense of taste. It has only\r\nbeen separated by the water into such minute particles that we cannot\r\nsee them. This is a case of mixing, not of chemical union.\r\n\r\nWhen we think of the characteristics of Sea Water, as compared with\r\nFresh Water, we have to do with simple mixing. As sugar floats, unseen\r\nbut not untasted, in tea or coffee; so salt floats, unseen but not\r\nuntasted, in ocean waters.\r\n\r\nSuch a thing as absolutely pure water is very rare. No matter how clear\r\na stream may seem to us, it holds a vast number of specks of material,\r\ncollected from earth and air. Once a scientific man had some, most\r\ncarefully distilled, which seemed to be of crystal purity. But he put\r\nit under the strong beam of an electric lamp, and, alas, for human\r\npowers! after so doing he could only declare that the idea of purity\r\nwas ludicrous. If it is so with distilled water, the less said the\r\nbetter about common drinking-water. It may be well for our peace of\r\nmind that we have not stronger sight.\r\n\r\nOcean-water holds about two hundred times as much dissolved material as\r\nordinary fresh water. The different kinds of substances found in any\r\nparticular water-supply determine the character of that water, making\r\nit sweet or sour or salt, rendering it health-giving or death-dealing.\r\n\r\nSomething has been said about the drying away of sea-water, and the\r\nleaving of salt behind. A remarkable instance of salt thus left is seen\r\nin the Rann of Cutch, a flat Indian plain, about a hundred and ninety\r\nmiles long, and half as wide.\r\n\r\nDuring the south-west monsoon the ocean waters are forced by powerful\r\nwinds up the Gulf of Cutch to a considerable height, overspreading the\r\nRann, which for a time is turned into a shallow lake. When dry weather\r\ncomes, the water vanishes, partly retiring, partly evaporating; and a\r\nsalt-strewn desert is left, varied by sand-ridges, green spots, and\r\nlittle lakes, but covered principally by “sheets of salt crust.” My\r\nfather, when there many years ago with his Regiment, noted down his\r\nimpressions of the scene.\r\n\r\n“From this spot”--the spot on which he stood--“the water is about eight\r\nmiles distant, the intermediate space being a flat surface, entirely\r\ncovered a quarter of an inch thick with salt in crystals, looking much\r\nlike snow, in such quantities that it can be scraped up by the hand\r\nperfectly free from earth; and on all this space not a blade of grass\r\nto be seen.”\r\n\r\nThe same task is carried on by the working of sun-heat, as by the fire\r\nunder a kettle. All day long in a warm climate the sun’s rays are\r\nbusily at work, lifting from the ocean-surface a continuous stream of\r\nfine invisible vapour. The water is drawn up particle by particle, not\r\nin masses; and the sun’s rays have no power to lift the ocean-salt,\r\nwhich remains behind, floating still in the sea.\r\n\r\nBut when a strong wind lashes the surface into waves, and rends the\r\ntops of billows into fine spray, it often carries a great deal of salt\r\nto a distance. We know how salt may be tasted on the lips miles inland,\r\nand how windows near the coast become encrusted with it in stormy\r\nweather. Moving air, like moving water, can carry weight; and it is\r\nthus, through the action of moving air, and not through the heat of the\r\nsun, that we have our health-giving breezes off the sea, laden with\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  EARTH’S VAST OCEAN\r\n\r\n “Thou great strong sea.”--AUBERON HERBERT.\r\n\r\n  “Drop by drop He counts\r\n  The flood of Ocean as it mounts.”--C. ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these days we know the Ocean as one vast whole. Not like our early\r\nforefathers, standing on the brink, to gaze with awe-stricken eyes into\r\nmysterious distances, and to speculate upon the unknown.\r\n\r\nMinor oceans do exist, certainly. We have the Atlantic, North and\r\nSouth; the Pacific, North and South; the Arctic, the Antarctic, and the\r\nIndian. Yet for us there is but one great world-wide OCEAN, encircling\r\nthe Earth, every part being in connection with every other part.\r\n\r\nA drop of water which to-day floats in southern seas may, months or\r\nyears hence, have found its way by currents into the far north. A speck\r\nof ice, at this moment fast in the rigid embrace of polar berg or floe,\r\nmay, months or years hence, be washing to and fro in tropical waters.\r\n\r\nA much greater area of water than of land is found upon the Earth’s\r\nsurface. So vast is the amount of the former that, if the whole had to\r\nbe put into separate vessels, each vessel being one cubic mile in size,\r\nthe number of such vessels required would amount to no less than _three\r\nhundred and thirty-five millions_. This very large order speaks for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe outer Crust of our Earth, taking land and sea together, may be\r\ndivided into three distinct parts. Like most such divisions in Nature,\r\nthe one is often found to glide by gentle stages into another.\r\n\r\nWe have, first, Land, rising above the sea-level, and consisting of\r\nplains, undulations, hills, mountains. It covers altogether less than\r\none-third of the Earth’s surface, and it is called THE CONTINENTAL\r\nAREA, though Islands as well as Continents belong to it.\r\n\r\nWe have, secondly, the Ocean-floor under deeper parts of the Ocean;\r\nthat which lies beyond a depth of about two miles. This division has\r\nbeen described as the “great submerged plain,” and it comprises about\r\none-half of the Earth’s surface. It is known as THE ABYSMAL AREA.\r\n\r\nWe have, thirdly, a middle region, which may be spoken of as a kind\r\nof borderland under the sea, connecting the dry land with the greater\r\nocean-depths. It amounts to about one-sixth of the Earth’s surface, and\r\nit has been named THE TRANSITIONAL AREA.\r\n\r\nBy “connecting” the two, I do not mean that it must always be between\r\nthe two. It does very generally so lie, but there are exceptions. Some\r\ndeeper portions of the sea are close to land, and some parts of the\r\nTransitional Area are found far out at sea.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the word “Continental” needs no explanation; and the\r\nvery word “Abysmal” carries its own sense. More, however, will be\r\nsaid in future chapters about those reaches of ocean known as the\r\n“Transitional Area.”\r\n\r\nA curious law seems to have governed the grouping of land and water.\r\nPutting aside innumerable small islands, scattered about, we find that\r\nthe great mass of land clusters towards and round the north pole, with\r\na water-and-ice-filled hollow for its centre. While, on the contrary,\r\nthe greater mass of water may be said to cluster towards and round the\r\nsouth pole, with--so far as we can conjecture--a large extent of land\r\nfor its centre. The conditions of north and south thus seem to be\r\nexactly reversed.\r\n\r\nNot long ago it was believed that the ocean’s floor might be a fairly\r\nclose imitation of that which we see on land. The differences, however,\r\nhave been found to be greater than was expected. Perhaps it is not\r\nsurprising, when one thinks of the immense levelling power of water.\r\n\r\nThat must be a firm make of rock which can permanently resist the\r\neffect of sea waves breaking upon or near the shore. And even deeper\r\ndown, where waves are not and currents may be slow, some movement must\r\nstill exist, since the ocean is nowhere quite stagnant. Such movements,\r\nno matter how gentle, would tend to shift all loose and soft substances.\r\n\r\nThe ocean-bed is held to be generally flat, though with gradual slopes\r\nhere and there, leading up or down to higher or lower levels. Many\r\nsubmarine mountains rear their heads, sometimes near the surface,\r\nsometimes above it. In places high mountain-ridges run for a long\r\ndistance below the sea, with profound depths on either side; and these\r\nagain often show their peaks, forming groups of islands.\r\n\r\nBroad reaches of the ocean are between two and three miles deep, and\r\nhere and there spots are found where the sounding-line goes sheer down\r\nthree miles, four miles, five miles, even six miles, before touching\r\nbottom. These greater depressions have been named “Deeps.”\r\n\r\nAt least fifteen of them are known in the Atlantic, and twenty-four\r\nin the Pacific; many of the latter lying close to islands. Some are\r\nlong in shape, some short; some are broad, some narrow. One of the\r\nmost profound, and almost the only one known to exceed five thousand\r\nfathoms, lies towards the south-east of the Friendly Islands. A\r\ndepth there has been found five hundred and thirty feet beyond five\r\ngeographical miles; and five geographical miles are equal to almost six\r\nof our common miles.\r\n\r\nFor a good while the notion was entertained that, probably, the\r\nloftiest mountain-peak on land, and the deepest depth in the ocean,\r\nwould about match one another, reckoned from the sea-level. But this\r\nparticular “deep” in the Pacific sinks two thousand feet lower than\r\nthe topmost peak on Earth rises. Mount Everest, in the Himalayas,\r\nis twenty-nine thousand feet high; and this ocean-depth is about\r\nthirty-one thousand feet deep. Only one other equal to it has yet been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nNo abyss divides England from France. The “silver streak,” though\r\nsufficient for purposes of defence, is comparatively shallow. All\r\nWest Europe, indeed, rises from a plateau, reaching from Norway into\r\nthe Atlantic, on no part of which is the water more than six hundred\r\nfeet in depth. The “transitional area” in this case makes a true\r\nstepping-stone or ledge between dry land and ocean’s abyss.\r\n\r\nBut another great plateau in the Atlantic, which may be called the\r\n“backbone” of that Ocean, is far from land, running roughly from north\r\nto south. It follows the outlines of the eastern and western shores,\r\nand rises often to within a mile and a half of the surface. On either\r\nside of the “backbone,” which seems to be largely volcanic, is a deep\r\ntrough, lying north and south, and varying in depth from two to four\r\nmiles. This plateau unites Europe with Iceland; and it forms a bond\r\nbetween the Islands of the Azores, Ascension, and Tristan D’Acunha.\r\n\r\nIf by any means the whole ocean-surface could be lowered six hundred\r\nfeet, remarkable results would be seen.\r\n\r\nAt once the British Isles would cease to be Islands. They would become\r\na part of the Continent of Europe, joined thereto by dry land. The\r\nHebrides, the Orkneys, the Shetlands, would share in this change. The\r\nContinents of Asia and North America would be united at the Behring\r\nStraits; Ceylon would find itself a part of India; Papua and Tasmania\r\nwould be one with Australia; and all places hitherto on the coasts of\r\ndifferent countries would find themselves six hundred feet above the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nSuch a change in the position of the British Isles, transforming them\r\ninto a Continental Country, would mean far-reaching consequences to\r\nourselves as a People. One such consequence may be briefly given in\r\nthe words of a recent newspaper article: “Dry up the Atlantic to\r\nthe 100-fathom line, and in six months we should bear the load of\r\nConscription as cheerfully and more efficiently than any nation in\r\nEurope.”\r\n\r\nSuppose that another great fall in the ocean-surface could follow. Not\r\nthis time to six hundred feet, but to three thousand feet, below its\r\npresent level. The resulting alterations would be still more sweeping.\r\nNot only Iceland and the Färoe Islands, but Greenland also--and not\r\nonly Greenland, but the Continent of North America itself--would become\r\none with the Continent of Europe, no longer cut off from the Old World.\r\n\r\nA word as to measurements. Two kinds of “miles” have been mentioned.\r\nThere is the ordinary “Statute mile,” used in common conversation,\r\nwhich is 880 fathoms, or 1,760 yards, in length. There is also the\r\n“Geographical” or “Nautical” mile--the “knot” of our Navy--which is\r\n1,013 fathoms or 2,026 yards in length.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two is not far from one-eighth of a statute\r\nmile. Roughly, seven miles are equal to six knots. A fathom is six feet\r\nor two yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  SUBJECT TO LAW\r\n\r\n “Thou rulest the raging of the Sea.”--PSALM lxxxix. 9.\r\n\r\n  “Nothing useless is or low,\r\n    Each thing in its place is best,\r\n  And what seems but idle show\r\n    Strengthens and supports the rest.”--LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings are what they are in this world very largely because of the pull\r\nof opposing forces, and among such forces not one is more universal\r\nthan that of Gravity. Many causes beside Weight have their share in\r\nmaking our Earth what it is; but if Weight were banished from our\r\nmidst, the Earth as we know it would exist no longer.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get rid of weight would be by getting rid of Gravity.\r\nAnd since no force in Nature acts more steadily and incessantly than\r\nthis, we are no more likely to get rid of it than we are to get rid of\r\nthe world itself.\r\n\r\nGravity, or Gravitation, or Attraction--it is known by all these names.\r\nSometimes it is called a Law; sometimes a Force. Neither term may be\r\ncounted amiss. No law is worth anything without a sufficient force to\r\nback it up; and no force is worth anything unless it acts according to\r\nlaw. But we might almost as reasonably call this behaviour of things\r\n“an Obedience” as “a Law.”\r\n\r\nEach particle of each substance draws and is drawn by each other\r\nparticle of every substance. And each body in the Universe, from a\r\ngrain of sand to a sun, draws and is drawn by each other body, whether\r\nfar or near. All these drawings are in obedience to that mysterious\r\nsomething--that force, or power, or influence--which has been named\r\nAttraction or Gravitation. So much we know; and beyond it we know very\r\nlittle as to the nature of the said “Attraction;” but we find that the\r\noutcome of it is Weight.\r\n\r\nBy means of weight, the sun, the moon, the planets, yes, and even the\r\ncountless multitudes of stars, are kept in their paths; in each case\r\nthe inward pulling being counterbalanced by the impetus and outward\r\npulling of a rapid rush. By means of weight, houses, rocks, stones rest\r\nfirmly on the earth; by means of weight, the atmosphere is bound to\r\nthe earth, the Ocean to its bed. Had sea-water no weight it might be\r\nscattered as fine water-dust through Space.\r\n\r\nA larger and heavier Earth would bind down the ocean yet more strongly,\r\nwhile a smaller and lighter Earth would have a weaker grip. Easily\r\nas the sea is now stirred by every passing breeze, an ocean such as\r\nours on a little world like the Moon or Mercury would be more rapidly\r\nagitated. The waves would leap higher with less cause.\r\n\r\nSo the Ocean, like the Land, is subject to law, knowing neither repose\r\nnor action except in obedience to Nature’s forces.\r\n\r\nWhen ocean-waters lie still as a mill-pond, they do so through an\r\nexact _poise_ of contending powers. When waves rush high and currents\r\npour strongly, each movement is still in strict obedience to governing\r\nforces, which are themselves governed by law. Each movement is due to\r\na long series of past movements; and each in turn helps to bring about\r\na long series of future movements. There are no breaks in the chain.\r\nEvery effect is also a cause.\r\n\r\nCurrents here and drifts there; breezes here and hurricanes there; all\r\nthese disturb the calm of the sea. Only for a brief spell, in one part\r\nor another, is the pull of opposing forces so far balanced that the\r\nwater can lie still. And at most the stillness is comparative. Even\r\nin a so-called “dead calm” gentle heavings to and fro will be found.\r\nAbsolute placidity in the ocean is a thing unknown.\r\n\r\nEven when the waters are at their stillest they are always being drawn\r\nsteadily towards Earth’s centre. A perfectly level ocean would mean\r\neach portion of its surface being equally distant from that centre.\r\nThe ocean ever strives after this ideal, but never attains to it; yet,\r\ncentury after century that aim is pursued, with a perseverance which\r\nmight afford a lesson to ourselves.\r\n\r\nDespite all this change and restlessness, we talk of the ocean having a\r\n“level” surface. We picture it to our minds as being in outer shape the\r\nsame as that of the Earth--a sphere. But this is not strictly true to\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nIf we could look upon the Earth, with large far-seeing eyes, from a\r\nfew thousands of miles off, we should find curious irregularities in\r\nthe watery outline. Instead of showing all round a smooth surface, the\r\nocean would be found to rise here and sink there, to be in one part\r\nhigher, in another part lower. A man roving over the ocean, all about\r\nthe Earth, would have in places to ascend undulations like hills,\r\nalmost high enough sometimes to be called mountains, in other parts to\r\ndescend declivities.\r\n\r\nMost of us have noticed in a cup filled with water, that the\r\nwater-surface is not perfectly flat. Close to the sides of the cup may\r\nbe noticed a distinct rise. It is the same in a tumbler, in a basin,\r\nin a slender glass tube. For the sides of the cup or tumbler or tube\r\nattract the water, drawing it upward; and this is known as Capillary\r\nAttraction.\r\n\r\nWith the ocean the very same thing is seen. If high land borders on\r\ndeep water, the extra attraction of mountain-masses will act just as\r\nthe sides of a cup or tumbler will act. They draw upward the water of\r\nthe ocean to a higher level. When I say that this is “seen,” I do not\r\nmean that any careless looker-on will be aware of the fact. It has to\r\nbe discovered by careful measurement.\r\n\r\nIn some cases a marked difference has been found. The enormous masses\r\nof the Himalayas, for instance, exert a powerful drawing upon the\r\nneighbouring sea; and at the delta of the Indus the ocean-level, in\r\nconsequence of that attraction, is actually three hundred feet higher\r\nthan on the coast of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nBesides land attraction, winds have an extraordinary power to heap up\r\nwaters in one place more than in another. To some slight extent this\r\nmay be seen upon English shores, when a strong gale happens to blow\r\nlandward at high tide. On such occasions the waters often rise far\r\nbeyond their usual mark.\r\n\r\nMention was made earlier of those Phenicians who, having known an\r\neastern ocean with tides, and a Mediterranean Sea without tides, must\r\nhave been perplexed to find a western ocean which corresponded with the\r\neastern in its ebb and flow.\r\n\r\nWe all know for ourselves in these later days, how the tides rise and\r\nfall around our coast, twice in twenty-four hours. Each high-water\r\nis twelve hours and twenty-five minutes later than the last; so each\r\nsucceeding day sees a difference of fifty minutes in the time of high\r\nor of low tide.\r\n\r\nTo a very large extent Tides are due to the attractive power of the\r\nmoon. They are due also to the sun, but in a much less degree, which at\r\nfirst sight seems singular, since the attraction of the sun, by reason\r\nof its greater size, far exceeds that of the moon. From the fact,\r\nhowever, that the powerful drawing of the sun comes from an immense\r\ndistance, it follows that it has much less effect than the small\r\nattraction of the moon, which comes from very near at hand.\r\n\r\nHer influence over our earth is exerted far more strongly with respect\r\nto those ocean-waters lying just under herself, and far less with\r\nrespect to those waters on the farther side of the globe. The effect of\r\nthese different pullings is to raise a double wave or swell,--one on\r\nthe surface of the ocean just below the moon, and one on the opposite\r\nside of the earth. The waves mean high tides; and low tides occur at\r\nplaces half-way between them.\r\n\r\nWere the whole Earth covered by one continuous sheet of water, these\r\ntidal waves would travel round and round the globe, in a fashion\r\neasy and pleasant for students of the subject. Unfortunately for the\r\nsaid students, their motions are very complicated. In the northern\r\nhemisphere, where land is abundant, the tidal waves are greatly\r\ninterfered with by continents and islands. Often the most that each can\r\ndo, as it sweeps along, is to send side-waves and currents journeying\r\nnorthward into channels and bays, estuaries and lesser seas.\r\n\r\nThrough the open ocean the tidal wave has no great height. Probably in\r\ncentral regions of the Pacific it rises only some three or four feet\r\nabove the usual sea-level. But when the flow enters narrowing bays and\r\nchannels, a very different result is seen; and the waters are often\r\npiled up in a wonderful manner,--as in the Bristol Channel, where the\r\nlevel at high tide is sometimes nearly forty feet above that at low\r\ntide.\r\n\r\nA marked contrast to this is seen in the Mediterranean. There, as\r\nalready said, practically no tides exist. The rise and fall amount at\r\nmost to only a few inches. Instead of a wide entrance and a narrowing\r\nestuary, we have just the opposite--a narrow entrance and a widening\r\nsea beyond. Connection with the outside ocean is too restricted to\r\nadmit of any full flow of the tidal wave.\r\n\r\nSolar tides, or tides brought about by the sun’s attraction, are much\r\nthe same in cause and effect as lunar tides, only far smaller in\r\ndegree. When Sun and Moon happen to be on the same side of the Earth,\r\nor on different sides but in the same line, so that their combined pull\r\nis exerted in one direction, we have Spring Tides. These are always at\r\nthe time of New Moon and Full Moon. Sun and Moon then work together,\r\neach helping the other in a common aim; and the ocean-waters rise\r\nhigher and sink lower than at other times.\r\n\r\nWhen Sun and Moon are so placed with regard to the Earth, that they\r\nexercise their pull in a cross direction, Neap Tides result,--that\r\nis tides which have small ebb and flow. In this case the sun hinders\r\ninstead of helping the moon, and the moon does the same for the sun,\r\neach tending to counteract the work of the other.\r\n\r\nConnected with and partly caused by the rise of the tide is the curious\r\nphenomenon known as a “Bore”--a single high wave, moving onward like a\r\nwall of water, with great rapidity and a roaring noise. More usually\r\nthis belongs to a river, and thus it has not much connection with\r\nthe subject of the ocean; but it is also sometimes seen in sharply\r\nnarrowing estuaries or ocean inlets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORE OF THE TSIEN TANG KIANG\r\n\r\n  _Face page 34_\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo the inhabitants of a flat and unprotected country, bordering on\r\nriver or estuary, the bore is often a thing of terror, for its advent\r\nis uncertain and abrupt, and in its upward rush it sweeps everything\r\nbefore it. The entering of such a wave into the Severn is an almost\r\ndaily event, and it reaches often a height of many feet. Bores are\r\nusual, too, in the River St. Lawrence, in the Hoogly, in an estuary\r\nof the Bay of Fundy, and in other places innumerable; and they vary in\r\nheight from two or three feet to over twelve feet. The effect of such\r\na wall of water as this, deluging low lands, carrying away trees and\r\nhouses and living creatures, may be easily imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  IN OCEAN DEPTHS\r\n\r\n  “My soul is full of longing\r\n  For the secret of the Sea.”--LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n  “Of the old Sea some reverential fear\r\n  Is with me.”--WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough ages of the world’s history, man knew nothing of the Ocean\r\nbeyond its surface.\r\n\r\nHe could sail on the sea; he could bathe in the shallow waters near\r\nland. If a good swimmer, he might go farther out, and might even dive\r\nfor one or two minutes out of sight. In more recent times, with the\r\nhelp of a diving-bell, he could descend thirty or forty feet; and in a\r\ndiving-dress he might even, if experienced, get from one to two hundred\r\nfeet down.\r\n\r\nBut that was all. Of the vast depths beyond he was sublimely ignorant.\r\nHe did not so much as know of their existence. Until the late\r\nscientific expedition made in the vessel _Challenger_, that great world\r\nof the Under-Ocean was swathed in mystery.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of it now by direct personal observation. No living\r\nman may penetrate those depths. The only mode in which we can learn\r\nwhat is, what lives, what happens there, is by means of “soundings,” by\r\nsending down and drawing up specially prepared instruments, the reading\r\nof which gives us information about that Under-world.\r\n\r\nSoundings made in earlier times did little more than tell navigators\r\nhow deep the sea thereabout might be. Such instruments as were then\r\nused could neither work beyond a limited depth, nor say their say with\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nOf late years immense improvements have taken place, both in the make\r\nof the machines employed, and in the methods of working them. Past\r\nsoundings were few and unsystematic; whereas now they are many and\r\nby rule. Thermometers have been made which bring up from the bottom\r\nof the sea reports of the prevailing heat or cold, moving unaffected\r\nthrough warm or cold layers between. Specimens of the materials which\r\nlie on the ocean-floor have been brought to light, and analysed. Living\r\ncreatures in great numbers have been hauled from their own domains,\r\nexamined and classified.\r\n\r\nAll this means progress. And though, no doubt, fifty or a hundred years\r\nhence, that which we now know will be looked upon as the barest A B\r\nC of the science, still our knowledge is growing year by year. The\r\nUnder-Ocean is no longer a vague fairy-land of possible mermaids, or a\r\nwaste region of death.\r\n\r\nA region of death in one sense it is and must be. All living creatures\r\nthat die in the sea, unless devoured by other creatures, sink to the\r\nbottom, there to find a tomb. Covered at first by a vast winding-sheet\r\nof water, they may be slowly buried under the shifting mud and sand.\r\nBut in this sense the whole Crust of Earth may be called one vast\r\nsepulchre, wherein all animals that die are entombed.\r\n\r\nPeople are slow to realise how modern is our knowledge of ocean-depths.\r\nAbout three hundred years ago a famous navigator made the first\r\nsounding which went below two hundred fathoms--that is, about one\r\nhundred feet deeper than the height of Beachy Head from the shore.\r\nHe at once decided that, by a happy chance, he had alighted upon the\r\nuttermost depth in the ocean.\r\n\r\nTo him it was an awe-inspiring profundity. Yet, when viewed beside\r\nsuch abysses as have been recently discovered, depths of five and six\r\nmiles, his little “deep” was as a saucer beside a lake.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to picture to ourselves the changeless calm of those\r\nabysses--those five or six miles of under-water, with nothing from\r\nsea-level to sea-floor to break the dead monotony.\r\n\r\nThroughout such regions storms, no matter how terrible, have no power.\r\nWinds cannot reach them. When Ocean’s surface is lashed by a hurricane\r\ninto wild commotion, that commotion is superficial. It means a furious\r\nstirring and flurry of upper layers; and it means no more.\r\n\r\nIf at the height of some fierce tornado, a sailor could leave his\r\ntossing straining ship, and could dive far into the sea, keeping\r\nbreath and sense and life, he would soon quit the turmoil, and would\r\nfind himself in a scene of deep repose. Strange to say, the idea of\r\nsubmarine ships actually doing this has been mooted, as one of the new\r\nprojects in the beginning of the Twentieth Century.\r\n\r\nWave-motion does not descend much below the surface. It is believed\r\nthat the depth of water affected by a wave is usually about equal to\r\nthe space which divides crest from crest. So, if we are looking at\r\nlittle ripples, flowing one after another, with crests perhaps one\r\nfoot apart, we may suppose that the water is disturbed by those ripples\r\nto a depth of about one foot. Or, if we are watching larger waves, with\r\ncrests twenty feet apart, we may suppose the disturbance to reach down\r\nto a depth of some twenty feet. And if our gaze is fixed on dignified\r\nAtlantic rollers, with crests six or eight hundred feet apart, we may\r\nsuppose that the sea is affected to a depth of six or eight hundred\r\nfeet--less and less affected the deeper we go down.\r\n\r\nSix or eight hundred feet, compared with six miles, are hardly more\r\nthan a man’s skin compared with his body. And beyond the shallow depths\r\nwhere wind and wave have sway, we come to a region of profound calm.\r\n\r\nThis repose does not mean stagnation. Ocean’s waters are ever on the\r\nmove, travelling this way and that way. Currents exist far below,\r\nas well as at the surface; but they are generally slow and placid,\r\nnot rough and hurrying. Old Ocean’s excitability lies all outside.\r\nSuperficially he is soon upset; but deep down he is composed.\r\n\r\nA great deal of discussion has taken place as to possibilities of Light\r\nin those depths. Are they black with midnight darkness? or do faint\r\nglimmers of daylight creep through?\r\n\r\nOcean-water, like other water, is transparent. Any substance is\r\ntransparent, when thin enough,--even gold. A very thin film of water\r\nis not, however, needed for transparency. Many feet, even many yards,\r\nmay be seen through, if clear and pure. Few of us have not, at one time\r\nor another, looked down from a boat, to see golden sand, variegated\r\npebbles, small fishes swimming about, at a considerable depth.\r\n\r\nThus with water, as with denser materials, transparency is merely a\r\nquestion of thickness. As the thickness increases, more and more rays\r\nof sunlight are taken captive, and the water becomes less and less\r\ntranslucent, till at length, if we could get deep enough, we should\r\nfind ourselves to be surrounded with blackness.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of ocean-depths is that of immense pressure.\r\n\r\nWe bear a certain degree of it in that other and lighter ocean--the\r\nAtmosphere. A man of medium size has upon his body about thirty\r\nthousand pounds’ weight, or some fifteen pounds to the square inch. But\r\nthis is nothing to what he would have to endure down in ocean-waters.\r\nAt a depth of one mile, an extra ton would be piled upon each square\r\ninch of his body; two miles down, would mean two extra tons on each\r\nsquare inch; three miles down, three extra tons; and so on. The load\r\nwould soon become intolerable.\r\n\r\nFor many years scientists maintained that in such depths no life could\r\nexist, since no bodies could withstand the awful pressure. Yet we now\r\nknow that frail jelly-fish, fragile shell-inhabitants, do withstand it,\r\nflourishing there by myriads.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the fact was somewhat overlooked, that the pressure upon a\r\nliving creature is not only inwards from without, but also is outwards\r\nfrom within. This is true of ourselves in the ocean of air, breathing\r\nair. It is true of creatures in the ocean of water, breathing water.\r\n\r\nMuch less than the weight of thirty thousand pounds might crush a man\r\nflat, were it not for the resisting pressure from within. If for one\r\ninstant he could empty his body of all inner air and liquids, and could\r\nso harden his skin that no air should squeeze through its pores, he\r\nwould be pressed as flat as a pancake by the surrounding atmosphere.\r\n\r\nA story has been told, illustrative of this. Once upon a time a clever\r\nfellow started an original idea. He proposed to make a balloon, which\r\nshould mount skywards, not from being full of hydrogen gas, but from\r\nbeing emptied of air. Being then lighter than the atmosphere, it would,\r\nhe said, of course rise.\r\n\r\nSo far as the reasoning went, it was faultless. It only did not go far\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe balloon being made, he named a day for its ascent, and asked\r\nmany friends to witness his triumph. At the last moment, all air was\r\nwithdrawn; and everybody waited in expectation, hoping to see the novel\r\nballoon skim lightly above their heads.\r\n\r\nBut the inventor, while using strong materials, had failed to make full\r\nallowance for the tremendous pressure of the air, when counteractive\r\npressure from within should have been done away with. As the air was\r\ndrawn out, the sides of the balloon collapsed, being crushed together\r\nas an empty egg-shell may be smashed in a boy’s hand. Instead of\r\nsoaring gaily upward, the would-be aeronaut stood on earth, scanning\r\nwith disappointed eyes a flattened and useless shell.\r\n\r\nA diver going down into the sea has a much increased weight upon his\r\nbody; but he does not suffer from it to a serious extent, provided that\r\nhe is not raised or lowered too fast. Much depends upon this. Both\r\nmen and beasts can endure a good deal of alteration in the degree of\r\npressure, whether from air or from water; but they cannot bear very\r\nabrupt changes. Hearts and lungs need time for growing accustomed to a\r\nfresh condition. In early days of diving this was not understood, and\r\nsome divers lost their lives through being too hurriedly hauled up.\r\n\r\nThe same has been noticed in animals brought quickly from great depths.\r\nThey have been constantly found in the net or trawl, dying or dead,\r\ntheir bodies swollen and even bursting from the lessening of pressure.\r\nIt was natural that at first the belief should arise of Life being in\r\nthose parts impossible. Now we know that animals die in the act of\r\nbeing drawn up, and that they live and flourish in profound depths,\r\nunaffected by the vast load of water.\r\n\r\nThe weight that a man can endure is not to be compared with what\r\nfragile sea-creatures thrive under. Beyond a depth of some two hundred\r\nfeet or more, the pressure becomes too great for any human beings; yet\r\nanimals are found at depths of three or four miles. But the fact that\r\nman breathes air, and that animals in the sea breathe, in a sense,\r\nwater, makes an enormous difference in their power to resist pressure.\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that the terrific weight of miles of water would\r\nsqueeze lower layers to a smaller bulk. Water is, however, very\r\ndifficult to compress; unlike air.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the sea, four or five miles deep, the weight is said\r\nto be equal to about four tons upon the square inch. If this tremendous\r\nload were pressing upon a mass of air, eleven thousand cubic feet in\r\nquantity, the whole would be crushed together into only twenty-two\r\ncubic feet. But the same weight pressing upon the same quantity of\r\nsea-water, would merely reduce its size to ten thousand cubic feet. So\r\nthere is not much difference between the make of sea-water near the\r\nsurface and sea-water at a great depth.\r\n\r\nNot only are ocean’s depths calm and free from storms; not only are\r\nthey black with midnight darkness; not only are they heavy with the\r\nweight of miles of water overhead; but also for the most part they are\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nChanges from season to season, like changes of weather, are\r\nsuperficial. At a depth of about six hundred feet, Seasons have ceased\r\nto be. There, summer and winter, autumn and spring, exist no longer.\r\nThe dead level of calm and darkness is also a dead level of uniform\r\nweather and unalterable climate. Where changes of cold and heat do\r\ncome about, they are very uncertain, and usually they are due to other\r\ncauses than those which bring about the succession of seasons upon\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nMany remarkable facts have lately come to light with respect to Ocean’s\r\ntemperatures. In far northern and far southern regions, near the two\r\npoles, the whole sea is very cold. One might expect the converse of\r\nthis in tropical regions--a whole sea intensely warm. But this we do\r\nnot find. The shallower parts--those included in the hundred-fathom\r\nlimit--may be nearly as warm below as above. When, however, deep-sea\r\nsoundings are made, when the registering thermometer is despatched on\r\nits mission of inquiry miles below the surface, then the report brought\r\nup is generally of great cold.\r\n\r\nIn almost all deeper parts, the tale is told of a frigid\r\nunder-layer,--of water nearly and sometimes quite down to the\r\nfreezing-point of fresh water. This, not only in Polar Seas, not only\r\nin Temperate Oceans, but in the hottest portions of the Tropics. The\r\nAtlantic, near the equator, is icy in its depths.\r\n\r\nA reckoning has been made that, if the floor of the whole ocean,\r\nomitting shallower parts, could be divided into one hundred equal\r\nportions, ninety-two of those portions would be found covered by water\r\nat a temperature of less than 40°; and only eight of them would lie\r\nunder warm water. The vast mass of the ocean is cold, with a thin warm\r\nlayer over certain districts.\r\n\r\nLittle doubt can there be that this under-layer is largely fed from\r\npolar regions.\r\n\r\nWe know that cold ocean-rivers pour from north-polar regions to the\r\nsouth, both in the Atlantic and in the Pacific. A general creeping\r\nunder-flow of icy waters towards the equator evidently balances the\r\ngeneral surface drift of warm waters towards the poles. Since cold\r\nwater is heavier than warm, it would naturally find its way to lower\r\ndepths, leaving the warm light liquid to float on the top.\r\n\r\nIn the Mediterranean Sea a marked contrast is found. There no ice-cold\r\nlayer is spread over the bottom; and the water in its uttermost\r\ndepths--over two miles and a quarter--does not sink below the\r\ntemperature of 54° F. The heat of the sun in South Europe can hardly be\r\ncompared with the heat of the sun over the Indian Ocean. Yet the latter\r\nhas water far below the surface down to at least 35°.\r\n\r\nPractically the Mediterranean, despite its depth, may be looked upon as\r\nan inland sea. The one opening which connects it with the open ocean is\r\nnot only comparatively narrow, but also is shallow, being less than two\r\nhundred fathoms deep. The water on this dividing ridge remains at about\r\n55°, and the Mediterranean throughout, to its greatest depths, keeps to\r\nabout that same degree of warmth. No entrance is afforded to the heavy\r\ncold currents from polar regions.\r\n\r\nThe Red Sea is separated from the Indian Ocean by a similar ridge, and\r\nthe same result is seen there. Over the floor of the Indian Ocean lies\r\na carpet of chill water. But the whole body of the Red Sea never sinks,\r\nin summer or winter, below 70° F. Here, too, the cold streams are not\r\nable to surmount the barrier.\r\n\r\nIn many deep mid-ocean hollows, cut off by surrounding sub-ocean walls\r\nof rock, the same is found again--warm water within the hollow, cold\r\nwater on the ocean-bed outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  RIVERS IN THE SEA\r\n\r\n “Sinuous or straight, now rapid and now slow.”--COWPER.\r\n\r\n “As winds that coerce the sea.”--C. G. ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Rivers in the Ocean; distinct streams of water, flowing over a\r\nbed of water, with banks of water. Not merely one or two such rivers,\r\nbut scores of them, hundreds of them, great and small, in all parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nChief perhaps in importance is the Gulf Stream, that vast flood which\r\npours out of the Gulf of Mexico, and acts as a winter heating apparatus\r\nfor the west of Europe. Though by no means the largest of ocean\r\nstreams, it is one of the most useful to man.\r\n\r\nAfter quitting the Gulf, it hurries at speed through the Straits of\r\nFlorida; then spreads out into a river, about fifty miles wide and over\r\ntwo thousand feet deep, journeying at a rate of some sixty miles in\r\ntwelve hours.\r\n\r\nFor a while it hugs the American coast; but, happily for Europe, it\r\nforsakes this friend of its youth, and wanders to the north-eastward\r\nacross the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nTo call it a “river” is no mere fiction of speech. Near Halifax the\r\nseparation between warm and cold water is so sharp, that those on board\r\na ship may know what latitude they have reached, on entering or leaving\r\nthe stream, by simply dipping a bucket in the water and taking the\r\ntemperature. Literally the Gulf Stream is a warm river, flowing over a\r\nbed of cold water, with cold-water banks.\r\n\r\nSo far as Cape Hatteras the stream clings to its early friend; and\r\nafter that the American coast knows it no more, being left to the\r\nmercies of a very different acquaintance. An icy stream flows southward\r\nfrom the far north, clinging to the coast of North America, while we\r\nin western Europe benefit by the presence of the warm current which\r\ntravels over to us. This stream has been described as forming a “cold\r\nwall” to the mild Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nFan-like, the Gulf Stream spreads as it journeys, growing gradually\r\nwider and wider, shallower and shallower, cooler and cooler--yet the\r\nlast so slowly that, even off the coast of Scotland, water nine\r\nhundred fathoms deep is found to be at 40° F.\r\n\r\nHow strongly this mass of warm water affects the air above it is well\r\nknown to sailors. When passing from the stream to the outside ocean, or\r\nfrom the ocean to the stream, they often change in a few hours from a\r\nwarm to a cool or from a cool to a warm climate. The atmosphere is ever\r\nready to tune its mood sympathetically to that of the ocean over which\r\nit sweeps.\r\n\r\nWe know well in Great Britain that our soft south-west breezes seldom\r\nfail to bring us warmth; though we do not always remember the debt that\r\nwe owe to our friend the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nBut for the immense stores of heat carried northward, and given over\r\nto us, our Island climate would be different indeed from what it now\r\nis. That is why our fellow-subjects in eastern and central Canada,\r\nliving no farther from the equator than we do ourselves, suffer from\r\nan intensity of cold in winter which we never endure. It is difficult\r\nto realise that parts of ice-bound Labrador and of Canada, where the\r\nthermometer often drops to 40° below zero, are no farther north than\r\nLondon and Paris; while Newfoundland lies actually more to the south\r\nthan Erin’s green Isle.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Pacific Ocean, we find there a corresponding river,\r\nagain flowing to the north-east. Just as the Gulf Stream wanders across\r\nthe Atlantic, so this river wanders over the Pacific, carrying stores\r\nof tropical warmth to opposite coasts. At its quickest, it is less\r\nrapid than the Gulf Stream, and about three times as wide. It too, as\r\nit journeys, becomes gradually broader, shallower, slower, colder.\r\n\r\nThis “Kuro Sivo” or “Black Stream,” so named from its dark colour,\r\nflows outside Japan, and then strikes freely for the northern coasts of\r\nNorth America. And because of its work as a winter heating apparatus\r\nin Alaska, the humming bird is found at a latitude which, on the\r\nother side of the American Continent, means, not the play and whirr\r\nof humming-birds in a soft air, but the disporting of walruses among\r\nice-floes.\r\n\r\nAs in the Atlantic, so in the Pacific, the warm northward-travelling\r\ncurrent is balanced by a cold southward-travelling current. The Arctic\r\nstream of the Pacific is not so marked as that of the Atlantic, perhaps\r\npartly because of the much shallower outlet from the Arctic Ocean;\r\nstill it is quite chilly enough in its effects upon the Siberian\r\nclimate. Here again the cold stream acts as a “wall” to the warm river\r\nflowing the other way.\r\n\r\nMore reasons than one may help to explain why these two currents slant\r\noff to the eastward instead of pouring due north. The shape of the\r\nvarious coast-lines has something to do with it; also the presence\r\nof ridges and hollows in the ocean-beds, and the resistance of other\r\ncontending currents. A river, either on land or in the sea, will always\r\ntravel where it finds least opposition.\r\n\r\nOne main cause, however, is the whirl of our Earth upon its axis. This,\r\nwhich greatly affects the directions of prevailing winds, alters also\r\nthe lines followed by ocean rivers.\r\n\r\nA current starting from near the equator for the north shares in the\r\nrapid rush of the Earth’s surface, which at the equator spins eastward\r\nat a rate of about one thousand miles each hour. As the volume of\r\nwater gets farther north, it reaches parts of the Earth which are\r\nwhirling more slowly, while it has not lost much of its own eastward\r\nwhirl. A sideways flow is the result, changing the northward into a\r\nnorth-eastward direction.\r\n\r\nBut a stream starting from the far north for the south is affected in\r\nthe opposite way. Near the north pole the Earth’s surface hardly moves\r\nat all; and the southward-flowing current, being weighted with northern\r\ninertia, takes a contrary course to the current flowing north. It lags\r\nmore and more _behind_ the faster-revolving surface, and so wanders\r\nwestward instead of eastward. Or, if prevented by the land from so\r\ndoing, it hugs the coast which hinders it.\r\n\r\nSo the _pull_ of the two great streams in the Atlantic is exactly\r\nopposed, each to the other. That of the Gulf Stream is towards the\r\neast; that of the Labrador Stream is towards the west; and the resolute\r\nmanner in which the two refuse to mingle may be partly due to this fact.\r\n\r\nIf our Earth could be made to change the present whirl from west\r\nto east, and to revolve instead from east to west, those two great\r\ncurrents would alter their directions. The Gulf Stream would hug the\r\nAmerican coasts, and the Labrador would find its way over to Europe.\r\nThen the British Isles in winter would know a temperature of 30° or 40°\r\nbelow zero, and the Canadians would experience soft damp winters and\r\nmoderate summers. Perhaps they would no more welcome the exchange than\r\nwe should.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the Black Stream would cling to the Asiatic side,\r\ntransforming the climate of western Siberia, and the cold Arctic river\r\nwould put a speedy end to humming-birds in Alaska. But abundance of ice\r\nfloes would soon be awaiting the walruses which would have to emigrate\r\nfrom the other side of the continent.\r\n\r\nA good deal of discussion has been held as to whether we do truly owe\r\nour mildness to the Gulf Stream alone, or whether that Gulf Stream is\r\nmerely part of a general northward movement of Atlantic waters from the\r\ntropics towards the pole. The question has been warmly contested; and\r\nno doubt on both sides, as generally is the case, truth has been mixed\r\nwith error.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Stream cannot be viewed as a separate entity. Its very birth\r\nin the Gulf of Mexico depends on a great mass of water ever flowing\r\nfrom the south-east into the Caribbean Sea. Since so much water pours\r\nin, the same volume must pour out, and as it does so it gains the name\r\nof the “Gulf Stream.”\r\n\r\nBut after quitting the Gulf of Mexico the stream does not exist alone.\r\nIt becomes a leading part of the North Atlantic circulation. The whole\r\nsurface of that ocean is slowly turning round and round--“whirling as\r\nif stirred in the direction of the hands of a watch,”[1] and the Gulf\r\nStream occupies one side or more of the vast _maelström_. In the centre\r\nof this revolving mass of water lies a district where the motion is\r\nslight, and at that centre floats an enormous collection of drift and\r\nsea-weed called the Sargasso Sea.\r\n\r\n[1] Dr. H. R. Mill.\r\n\r\nSuppose we pour some water in a large basin, drop into it a handful of\r\nsmall leaves and chips, and make the whole spin gently with one hand.\r\nWe shall then see how the chips and leaves will collect at the centre,\r\nand will float there, almost stationary. That is what happens, on a\r\nlarge scale, in the North Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nOther Oceans also have this steady circular movement, not of the whole\r\nbody of water, but of the surface-water, down to a greater or less\r\ndepth--precisely how deep one cannot say; it lessens gradually with\r\nincreasing depth. The same is found also in the South Atlantic, in the\r\nNorth and South Pacific, and doubtless in the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nTo find its direction in any part, one need only lay a watch, face\r\nupwards, upon a map of the North Atlantic or the North Pacific. In\r\nboth cases the water travels round _with_ the watch-hands. In the\r\nSouth Atlantic and the South Pacific the flow is just in the opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nSo both the Gulf Stream and the Black Stream are merely parts of a\r\nbig oceanic whirlpool. Each ocean on Earth has its own system of\r\ncirculation; and that system is part of a world-wide system. The waters\r\nare in perpetual and complicated motion. Streams pour incessantly\r\nhither and thither, to north and south, to east and west.\r\n\r\nTwo vast streams, known as the Equatorial Currents, nominally pour\r\nround the world, but really are best seen in the open Pacific, where\r\nfor long distances no land meddles with their career. They flow\r\nsteadily westward, one to the north and one to the south of the equator.\r\n\r\nBetween them flows a reverse stream, called the “Equatorial Counter\r\nCurrent.” If a certain amount of water travels north, an equal\r\nquantity must travel south. Or if, as in this case, so much water\r\nruns in a westerly direction, a corresponding amount has to run in an\r\neasterly direction. Water may be marvellously piled up here or there,\r\nby influences of land or of wind, but it cannot remain piled up,\r\nwithout efforts on the part of the ocean to restore the equilibrium.\r\n\r\nWere the whole Earth covered by a single unbroken sheet of water,\r\nthese drift currents might circle round and round the globe for ever,\r\nundisturbed in their working. But the Earth has lands as well as\r\noceans; and when a current strikes a coast its course is altered, part\r\nat least being turned in a fresh direction.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion has taken place about the causes which bring these\r\ngreat Drift Currents into being.\r\n\r\nDisturbing elements, many in number, may have had a hand in the matter.\r\nSo soon as one part of the sea-surface becomes warmer than another\r\npart, movements are set going; the heavy cold water sinks, the light\r\nwarm water rises, and streams are started from the one place to the\r\nother. There are also countless rivers pouring into the ocean, each\r\nhelping to upset its equilibrium. Heavy downpours of rain raise the\r\nlevel of the sea here or there, inducing more currents.\r\n\r\nBut these are lesser causes. It is now recognised, as a fact beyond\r\nquestion, that the main power in starting and sustaining ocean-currents\r\nis that of Wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  OF WIND AND WATER\r\n\r\n “He commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves\r\n thereof.”--PSALM cvii. 20.\r\n\r\n “Measure me a measure of wind.”--2 ESDRAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the great Deep of blue water lies the greater Deep of blue air.\r\nAnd between these two--the Ocean of Air and the Ocean of Water, both\r\ndragged earthward by the perpetual pull of gravitation--endless\r\nintercourse takes place. Each finds its way in small fragments into the\r\nother. There is always water present in the air. There is always air\r\npresent in the water.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the latter fact is not so widely recognised as the former; yet\r\nit is equally true. Sea-water contains large supplies of dissolved\r\ngases, absorbed by the ocean-surface from the atmosphere, and passed on\r\ninto lower depths, for the use of creatures living there.\r\n\r\nBut the presence of water in air is known to us all. When we casually\r\nremark, “What a damp day it is!” we mean, “What an amount of water\r\nto-day is in the atmosphere!”\r\n\r\nWater-vapour, drawn up from Ocean’s broad bosom, is carried far and\r\nwide “on the wings of the wind,” to fall as rain where needed; and\r\ndrying winds in their turn pass over regions where much rain has\r\nfallen, to bear away superfluous moisture.\r\n\r\nA good deal was said in the last chapter about oceanic currents; and\r\nmention was made of Winds as their chief cause.\r\n\r\nThat the power of wind over water is great, anybody may know who\r\nhas watched the lashing of the ocean into fury by a gale. But the\r\ndegree of that power was scarcely grasped, until within the last\r\nfew years. Rivers and streams in the sea were long ascribed to any\r\ncause, except the most weighty of all. No one supposed _the_ immense\r\ncurrent-producing force to be that of Wind--not of mere local breezes\r\nor gales here and there, but of strong constant winds, which prevail\r\nmonth after month over wide ocean-districts.\r\n\r\nWhen a storm-wind pours up a narrowing gulf, where the sea has no\r\noutlet, it often piles the water up in an extraordinary manner.\r\nHurricanes have been known to turn the entire Gulf Stream for a while\r\nout of its course, and even to force the waters back so as actually\r\nto reverse the current. Once the volume of water, thus checked by a\r\nterrific gale, was heaped up some thirty feet above the proper level,\r\nwhich of course caused a fearful deluging of the land.\r\n\r\nThe above words had not been long written, when papers told us of the\r\nawful hurricane of September, 1900, in U.S. Texas. A deep cyclone\r\npassed over the devoted town of Galveston, the direction of the wind\r\nsuddenly changing as the centre of the cyclone went by: and the\r\nheaped-up waters from either side coming together poured their united\r\nvolume over the land.\r\n\r\nThat was a flood which “turned the city into a raging sea.” Buildings\r\nwere levelled; houses fell like packs of cards; vessels were carried\r\nmiles inland; men and women and children perished by thousands. When\r\nthe lessening wind allowed the waters to retire, an inch-deep layer of\r\nslime was found over everything.\r\n\r\nSuch facts as these help to show how vast is the power of moving air\r\nover the ocean.\r\n\r\nAs a strong wind blows, the upper layer of water slips along in\r\nobedience to its push; and fresh lower surfaces are bared to the same\r\ninfluence. Also, the movement of the upper layer tends to drag on\r\nthe layer just below, which again affects the one lower still. By\r\ninfluence thus exerted and passed from one to another, the result of a\r\nlong-continued wind-pressure in one direction is to set going powerful\r\nstreams, which in the first instance were due chiefly or only to wind.\r\n\r\nRound the Earth, where fairly open sea permits them to develop, are\r\ntwo wide belts of very persistent winds--the Trades--which remain\r\npractically the same all the year round; only shifting their limits\r\nwith the changing seasons.\r\n\r\nThey blow from the north-east and from the south-east slanting towards\r\nthe equator. So, speaking roughly, they are easterly winds travelling\r\ntowards the west. As a consequence of their steady pressure, we have\r\nthe great Equatorial Current of the tropics, pouring from east to west\r\nin two halves, north and south of the equator. This vast ocean-river,\r\nstarted and kept going by the trade-winds, has been described in the\r\nmore important part of its course as a “magnificent surface-current of\r\nhot water, four thousand miles long by four hundred and fifty broad,”\r\nmoving “at an average rate of thirty miles a day”--and, it may be\r\nadded, at least over six hundred feet in depth.\r\n\r\nBetween the Trade-wind belts is a belt of dead calms, known to sailors\r\nas “The Doldrums.” This belt divides in two the Equatorial Current; and\r\nin it is found the inevitable “Counter Current,” mentioned earlier,\r\nflowing from west to east.\r\n\r\nAnother belt of steadfast winds is that of the “Roaring Forties,” in\r\nthe Southern Ocean; a wide stretch of all but landless sea, between\r\n40° and 50° south latitude. These “Brave West Winds,” as they are\r\ncalled, being again the reverse of the easterly Trades, blow all the\r\nyear round, and nearly all the world round, since only the southern\r\nextremity of South America interferes with them.\r\n\r\nThey too give birth to a powerful current, flowing from west to east;\r\nand this mighty stream, almost encircling the Earth, has a mission to\r\nfulfil.\r\n\r\nAlready it has been said that each lesser ocean in the world has its\r\nown separate circulation-system. This southern stream, with the Roaring\r\nForties for its parent, has for its especial task to unite all those\r\nsmaller systems into one. It has to refuse to the minor oceans a\r\nlonely and self-absorbed policy, and to insist on the great truth of\r\na world-wide Ocean unity. It has to carry gifts from the Pacific to\r\nthe Atlantic, from the Atlantic to the Indian, from the Indian to the\r\nPacific again. It has to despatch streams northward into more distant\r\nregions, with messages of goodwill to all.\r\n\r\nIs this somewhat imaginative? Well, be it so. The facts are\r\nscientifically true. Suggested meanings, gathered therefrom, may be\r\naccepted or rejected, according to the reader’s pleasure.\r\n\r\nWe see, at all events, that from the vast Drift-Currents of the\r\nOcean, born of the Winds, spring the Grandchildren of the Winds,\r\nsuch powerful rivers as the Gulf Stream and the Black Stream; they\r\nin their turn giving birth to an infinite number of lesser currents,\r\nGreat-grandchildren of the Winds;--one and all taking their share in a\r\nworld-wide circulation of Ocean-waters.\r\n\r\nThe southern belt of westerly winds, with its resulting westerly\r\ncurrent, would be repeated in the northern hemisphere, but for the\r\npresence of great masses of land. Continents work havoc with schemes of\r\nocean circulation.\r\n\r\nThat westerly winds do greatly prevail in corresponding latitudes to\r\nthe north is a well-known fact, though we cannot boast the possession\r\nof anything like the “Roaring Forties.” No broad belts of unchanging\r\nair-currents can exist in the neighbourhood of so much land, for the\r\ncounter-influences are too many.\r\n\r\nFrom steadfast Wind-belts, giving birth to steadfast Ocean-streams, we\r\npass naturally to those fitful storms which lash the ocean into passing\r\npassions, and to the uncertain breezes of temperate climes.\r\n\r\nThere are currents and counter-currents, breezes and contrary breezes,\r\nwinds from north and south and east and west, over the whole earth.\r\nEach separate movement of air helps to stir the waters of the sea into\r\nrenewed restlessness.\r\n\r\nThough few things are more wonderful than those vast rivers of air and\r\nwater, pouring always in the same direction, century after century,\r\nthey are perhaps less impressive from a man’s point of view than many a\r\nmere whirling eddy, which flings itself along, rousing a huge flurry of\r\nwater, and soon dying out of existence. A man cannot grasp as a whole\r\nthe Trades or the Roaring Forties, with their companion ocean rivers.\r\nPractically he knows only that little portion of each which happens to\r\nbe near his ship. If he is overtaken by a hurricane, the whole life of\r\nwhich is compressed into a few miles of space and a few hours of time,\r\nhe feels a greater awe.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that he should. Those impetuous and short-lived eddies\r\nare terrible in their fury. Their winds blow with a fierceness never\r\napproached by the stiffest Trade. A hurricane, tearing over Earth’s\r\nsurface at the rate of one hundred and twenty miles an hour, reduces\r\nthe most muscular of men to helplessness.\r\n\r\nNone the less, such a hurricane is in itself a mere accident, a mere\r\npassing incident, a mere swirl of air, coming into being to adjust a\r\nlost balance, and vanishing so soon as its work is done. We have seen\r\ntiny swirls of air dancing along the road, on a windy day, sweeping up\r\nbits of straw or dried leaves into their embrace. Such little swirls\r\nare hurricanes in miniature. The real thing levels forests, wrecks\r\ntowns, lashes the ocean into mountainous heights of water, sinks\r\ngallant ships, destroys human lives. Yet the little swirl and the\r\nhurricane are closely akin.\r\n\r\nOnly in recent years has the circular--more strictly, the oval--shape\r\nof a hurricane become known. It may be described as a revolving eddy\r\nof air, the winds pouring in a corkscrew-like fashion round the\r\ncentre, inwards from without, and upwards from within. Another kind of\r\nair-eddy, called an anti-cyclone, gyrates just the other way, downward\r\nand outward. This usually brings light winds and dry weather, instead\r\nof storms and rain.\r\n\r\nOne might imagine that in the centre of a wild cyclone a ship could\r\nfind safety, because there calm reigns. But the furious whirl of winds\r\nall around raises tumultuous billows; and towards the centre, although\r\nthe winds themselves die down, the state of the sea is a perfect\r\n“chaos” of tempestuous waves converging from all sides. Sailors strive\r\ntheir utmost to avoid that central chaos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  AN OCEAN OF AZURE\r\n\r\n  “The boom of the waves on the shingle.”--LEWIS MORRIS.\r\n\r\n  “Roll on, thou deep and dark-blue Ocean, roll!”--BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot that the Ocean is always and everywhere blue. In a certain “arm of\r\nthe sea,” the Bristol Channel, it is commonly any tint that you please\r\nrather than blue--brown, green, yellow, chocolate, only not the colour\r\nthat we love. If by chance it dons for a few hours a robe of azure,\r\nthat robe is merely a passing loan from the sky. And in dull weather it\r\ncan only be described as a huge puddle of muddy liquid.\r\n\r\nPeople often grow to like best that to which they are accustomed. A\r\nlady, who had spent most of her life on the borders of that brown\r\nChannel, once assured me that she infinitely preferred it to the “deep\r\nblue sea.” She had been to stay by the latter, and had found its\r\nmonotony of tint so uninteresting that she was charmed to get back to\r\nher old friend.\r\n\r\nTastes differ, certainly. Not many would agree with her. Yet it is a\r\nfact that the great Turner went to the Bristol Channel, with all its\r\nmud, for many of his marvellous sea and cloud effects.\r\n\r\n“Deeply, darkly, beautifully blue,” sang Byron of the ocean, and he\r\nsang truly, even though the ocean itself, putting aside the Bristol\r\nChannel, is not always and uniformly azure. Near land the tint is often\r\ngreenish. Sometimes it is pure green. Often it is a pale and watery\r\nblue. At other times we have a leaden grey. The genuine ocean-blue,\r\nwhich resembles nothing else on Earth, can seldom be enjoyed till one\r\ngets on really deep water, far from land. Or--till one is looking at\r\nthe Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWhy should the sea be blue? And why should the sky be blue? For the\r\nmatter of that, why should anything be blue? What do we mean by\r\ncolour?--whether blue or green, red or yellow?\r\n\r\nWe mean that particular tint--or sensation--which the object in\r\nquestion causes us to see--or feel. The object receives sunlight,\r\nand reflects it to our eyes. And since sunlight is white or\r\nyellowish-white, one might expect that everything we look upon would\r\nappear to us white or yellowish-white.\r\n\r\nBut everything does not. And the reason is that a ray of sunlight is\r\nreally a bundle of lesser rays, each of which has its own colour. If\r\na ray of light is made to pass through a prism, these lesser sub-rays\r\nare spread out upon wall or floor, always in the same order, from\r\nviolet at one end to red at the other end. Light is believed to be due\r\nto enormous numbers of most minute wavelets; and for each colour the\r\nwavelets have a definite but different size. They are smallest at the\r\nviolet end, and largest at the red end.\r\n\r\nNow when a ray of sunlight falls upon anything--leaf or flower, earth\r\nor water--some of the sub-rays are absorbed or taken in, and some are\r\nrejected or refused admission. A healthy leaf, for instance, absorbs\r\nthe red, the yellow, the blue, the violet, and refuses the green, which\r\nis therefore thrown back from the leaf-surface to our eyes, making it\r\ngreen to us. A ripe tomato absorbs the yellow and green, the blue and\r\nviolet, and reflects the red. A lump of blacklead absorbs greedily all\r\nthe rays, reflecting none, and so to our eyes it is black or without\r\ncolour. The petals of a white rose, on the contrary, absorb so little\r\ncolour of any kind, that practically the entire ray is sent again to us\r\nas white light.\r\n\r\nIf this is the manner in which the ocean is blue, it means that\r\nsea-water, and indeed water generally, must in itself be actually blue,\r\nas a cake of ultramarine, a sapphire, a corn-flower, a forget-me-not,\r\nare blue.\r\n\r\nCould that be the case? For a long while men decisively answered--No.\r\nEverybody knew that water was colourless, so the idea was flung aside\r\nas impossible. Another explanation came up instead.\r\n\r\nThe sea is full of fine dust; and it was suggested that, as vast\r\nmultitudes of these floating dust-particles are exceedingly small, they\r\nmight be able to reflect only the smaller blue light-waves, and not\r\nthe larger yellow or the still larger red waves. Thus the sea would\r\nnaturally seem to be blue.\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion, careful experiments were made. Different objects\r\nwere lowered to various depths, and the effect upon their colouring was\r\nnoted. The outcome of these and other tests went far to prove that the\r\nold certainty was wrong, and that water is in itself blue.\r\n\r\nSomebody may feel inclined to protest. “Water blue! But that is out of\r\nthe question. I have good sight, and I assure you there isn’t the least\r\nsign of colour in water. Not the faintest. If you dip a bucket in the\r\nsea, you will see for yourself.”\r\n\r\nYet all the while the colour may be there, actually existent, though\r\nnot to be detected by your eyes or mine in a pailful.\r\n\r\nA short time ago I had to buy a piece of lace; and my intention was to\r\nchoose a pale straw or deep cream. The lace was wound in many folds\r\nround a large cardboard, and it seemed to be exactly the right hue--a\r\nrich yellow-cream, almost butter colour. Without further demur, I\r\nordered about a yard to be cut off.\r\n\r\nOn reaching home, I found myself in possession of a piece of wide\r\ndead-white lace--or all but dead-white. It was actually a very pale\r\ncream; and when a great many folds lay one over another the combined\r\neffect was rich and yellow. But a single thickness of the material\r\nshowed no colouring.\r\n\r\nThe same may be seen with a single piece of very pale blue muslin.\r\nIt will appear to be white. But yards upon yards of the same, folded\r\ntogether, will become quite a deep blue.\r\n\r\nA single thin layer of ocean-water, in like manner, has too faint a hue\r\nto be visible to ordinary eyesight. It is only when layers are piled\r\nupon layers that the blue becomes distinct; and the deeper the water,\r\nthe deeper generally will be the colour. Some yards of water-thickness\r\nmay be said to correspond to a single thickness of lace or muslin.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, we may say with tolerable confidence that the blue\r\nof the ocean is a “True Blue,” this alone will not explain all the\r\nvarieties of tinting, seen at different times and in different places.\r\n\r\nSea-water is sometimes a rich profound blue, and sometimes a pale\r\nsickly blue. It is sometimes dull, sometimes brilliant. It is sometimes\r\ngreen, and sometimes almost black. For these variations, even while\r\naccepting the new explanation, it has been found needful to revert to\r\nthe old theory in quest of added help. The sea is blue, because it\r\nreally and truly _is_ blue. But that is not all. It is a deeper or less\r\ndeep blue, a duller or brighter blue, a greenish blue or even a dull\r\nyellow, because of the vast supplies of dust floating in it.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean was particularly examined, on account of its\r\nremarkable depth and brilliancy of colouring; and it was found to be\r\nexceptionally laden with dust, both fine and coarse, brought from land\r\nby innumerable rivers, and also pounded by breaking waves on the long\r\nsurrounding coast-lines.\r\n\r\nSuch floating particles, at all events the bigger ones, are no longer\r\nsupposed, as once they were, to reflect only the tiny blue light-waves.\r\nOn the contrary, they are believed to reflect all the waves of light\r\nindiscriminately, whether large or small; while the sea, by virtue of\r\nits own power as a Blue material, captures all those reflected waves\r\nexcept the blue, and allows the latter alone to reach our eyes.\r\n\r\nNear British shores the water has often a strongly green tint; and this\r\nmay be due in part to floating particles of sand. The yellow of the\r\nsand, combining with the blue of the water, would naturally form green.\r\nPossibly also the sea, near shore, is sometimes affected in colour by\r\nfloating sea-weeds, green-tinted.\r\n\r\nThe blue of the sky is often reflected on the sea-surface, and\r\nsometimes so powerfully as to overcome the real ocean-colour. One\r\nhardly understands how intense such a sky-reflection may be, until one\r\nhas watched the whole sea transformed into glowing crimson or gold from\r\na radiant sunset.\r\n\r\nMuch the same perplexity has been felt about the blue colour of air,\r\nas about the blue colour of the ocean; and much the same course of\r\nexplanation has been followed. Its blueness was long maintained to be\r\ndue only or mainly to the “scattering of sunlight” by infinite numbers\r\nof floating dust-specks, which also serve to account for the golden\r\nand crimson tints of sunset. It now appears that oxygen, an important\r\nelement in the atmosphere, has a faint blue tint of its own, like\r\nwater, which at least helps to answer for the blue of the air.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore say of Water that it is believed to be transparently\r\nand intrinsically blue; and that its colour, though not actually due to\r\nfloating specks of dust and other impurities, is a good deal affected\r\nby them. Such materials in the Ocean help to modify its colouring,\r\nsometimes deepening it, sometimes adding to its brilliance, sometimes\r\ndeadening its brightness, sometimes turning it green or yellow.\r\nCareful observation has also shown that, when water is especially free\r\nfrom dust-specks, it is of a darker and duller hue than when they are\r\npresent in large quantities to capture and reflect the sunbeams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  ICE-NEEDLES TO ICE-MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n                              “In all time,\r\n  Calm or convulsed,--in breeze or gale or storm,\r\n  Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime\r\n  Dark-heaving;--boundless, endless, and sublime--\r\n  The image of Eternity,--the throne\r\n  Of the Invisible.”--BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far most of our thoughts have been given to Earth’s milder regions;\r\nwhere, indeed, the warm ocean water is at best but a thin slice laid\r\nover vast depths of cold water, yet where, so far as man is concerned,\r\nheat has the upper hand. In other parts, far to north and south, the\r\nReign of Frost is a dire reality; and that chill monarch “rules the\r\nroost” in a masterful fashion, lording it over land and sea for months\r\ntogether, with none to resist his sway.\r\n\r\nWherever King Frost waves his sceptre, one result always follows. Water\r\nchanges from a liquid to a solid.\r\n\r\nNor is water the only liquid which so changes. Quicksilver, known to\r\nus usually as a liquid, may be frozen, though not without a greater\r\namount of cold than that which freezes water. Then, again, molten\r\niron--that is, iron made soft through great heat--is a liquid which\r\nwhen cold hardens into a solid. Iron as we most often see it is simply\r\nin its frozen state; just as much the frozen form of iron as ice is the\r\nfrozen form of water.\r\n\r\nAnd the freezing of the two comes about in the same mode. As molten\r\niron cools and hardens it crystallizes. Minute needles, far too minute\r\nto be seen, take shape, crossing and re-crossing at various angles,\r\ntill the whole becomes a solid mass of interlaced iron needles, held\r\nin position by attraction. When water changes into ice, the same thing\r\nhappens. The water-particles shape themselves into tiny needles, and\r\nthese ice-needles cross and re-cross, till they are knitted into a\r\ncompact mass, something like the mass of iron needles.\r\n\r\nNor are needles alone found in ice. Exquisite forms resembling\r\nice-flowers are there also, commonly invisible, but composed of\r\nice-needles woven into various shapes, which again are woven into the\r\nfabric of the solid ice. So a block of ice may perhaps be said to be\r\nformed of ice-flowers, and the ice-flowers to be formed of ice-needles.\r\n\r\nSuch flowers are of many shapes, but more generally they have six\r\npetals each. If a ray of sunlight is thrown upon a slab of ice, through\r\na lens, so as to concentrate the heat, then, as the ice melts, the\r\nsparkling of these tiny florets can be seen; and when their magnified\r\nimage is cast upon a sheet, the six-petalled flowers become clearly\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nEven more beautiful than the ice-flowers embedded in solid ice are the\r\nice-flowers embedded in snow. They too are made of tiny spicules or\r\nneedles of ice; and they too, while varying much in shape, are commonly\r\nsix-petalled.\r\n\r\nSolid blocks of ice are at first sight so unlike masses of feathery\r\nsnow that a child would be surprised to hear a snowflake spoken of\r\nas “ice.” Yet the difference between the two lies mainly in the\r\narrangement of the little ice-needles, in the way they are put\r\ntogether. Those of hard ice are more densely packed; those of snow are\r\nmore loosely joined, with open spaces between, full of air. It is the\r\nabundance of air, mixed in with ice-needles, catching and reflecting\r\nlight, which gives to snow its whiteness.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, as with glacier-ice, the texture is so\r\nclose--like that of glass--that neither flowers nor needles are\r\ndiscernible.\r\n\r\nThe fact that snow may be, through hard pressure, actually transformed\r\ninto firm ice--and this is an everyday occurrence in the high\r\nAlps--shows how closely akin the two are.\r\n\r\nEvery country in the world has, at a certain height, that which is\r\ncalled “the line of perpetual snow,” or, more briefly, “the snow-line.”\r\nBelow that limit snow may fall in winter, and water may freeze, but\r\nboth vanish in the summer. Above that limit snow and ice are found all\r\nthe year round, lessening to some extent in summer months, but never\r\ndisappearing.\r\n\r\nOver the equator the snow-line is about sixteen thousand feet high, or\r\nhigher than Mont Blanc; so if Mont Blanc were situated on the equator\r\nit would not be a snow-clad mountain. At the north and south poles\r\nthe snow-line is down at the sea-level. Summer warmth there does not\r\nsuffice to get rid of winter ice and snow. Between the equator and the\r\npoles the snow-line varies in each country, according to that country’s\r\nposition and climate.\r\n\r\nAbove the snow-line on lofty Swiss mountains heavy falls add\r\nperpetually to the mass of snow. During the summer a certain degree of\r\nthawing goes on, but never anything like enough to balance the wintry\r\nadditions. Exactly at the snow-line the quantity of snow which falls\r\nand the quantity which thaws in the year are about equal. Lower down\r\nthe yearly thawing exceeds the yearly snowfall.\r\n\r\nBut if, above that line, more snow is being added year by year than\r\ncan thaw and flow away, must it not be that those mountains which wear\r\nperpetual snow are always growing higher?\r\n\r\nIt certainly would be so _if_ the snow heaped upon those summits had no\r\nother outlet, no other means of escape to the Ocean--the goal of all\r\nEarth’s waters. But another mode of escape is found. Superabundant snow\r\non mountain heights gets away by means of glaciers.\r\n\r\nWe have had to think about liquid rivers flowing in the ocean, and here\r\nare solid rivers flowing on the land. Liquid rivers with liquid banks;\r\nsolid rivers with solid banks. A curious anomaly in either case.\r\n\r\nThe higher levels of land are drained by rivers pouring down to lower\r\nlevels and thence into the sea; and it is the same with the mighty\r\nsnowfields of Switzerland as with any gentle range of English hills,\r\nonly here we have rivers of ice instead of rivers of water.\r\n\r\nBut why not rivers of snow, if a glacier means the draining away of\r\nsnowfields?\r\n\r\nWell, so they are--rivers of snow. But the heavy weight of overlying\r\nsnow above, and the great pressure of descending masses later, welds\r\nthe light and delicate snow into hard ice. Those tiny needles, of which\r\nthe falling snow was made, are crushed closer and closer, till they\r\nform a solid block, which loses all resemblance to snow. In summer the\r\nmelting of the surface by day, and its freezing again by night, help\r\nforward this transformation.\r\n\r\nThus a glacier is literally an Ice-River, a huge long tongue of ice,\r\nsqueezed from beneath snowfields, and creeping down a valley.\r\n\r\nSuch rivers vary much in size. Some of the Swiss glaciers are between\r\ntwenty and thirty miles long, in parts two or three miles wide,\r\nand often hundreds of feet deep. Starting above the snow-line they\r\nsometimes reach thousands of feet below it, the milder air failing to\r\nend their existence sooner. So enormous are the ice-masses, that not\r\nall the strength of the summer sun can make away with them. Of course,\r\neach square yard in turn does melt, and does help to feed the river of\r\nwater which rushes away from the lower end of the glacier--sooner or\r\nlater to reach the ocean.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland’s grandest glaciers dwindle into insignificance beside the\r\nenormous ice-rivers of the frozen north. When the “Humboldt Glacier”\r\nof Greenland gets to the ocean it is about forty-five miles in width.\r\nA generous gift of water indeed, from land to ocean. Another monster\r\nglacier ends in a cliff of solid ice, rising in parts to four hundred\r\nfeet of height. Greenland lies under one unbroken shield of snow and\r\nice; and the weight of this tremendous “ice-cap” presses out numberless\r\nrivers of ice from its shores into the sea.\r\n\r\nThese do not, like Alpine glaciers, end in rivers of water, flowing\r\nthrough milder climates to the ocean. The Greenland glaciers themselves\r\nreach the sea, each thrusting an enormous “foot” far into deep water.\r\nFor a while, as it does so, the glacier-ice holds firmly together in\r\na solid mass, gliding slowly over the ocean-bed, getting deeper and\r\ndeeper, till only a small part of it shows above the surface.\r\n\r\nBut ice naturally floats. The upward pressure of the sea becomes\r\nincreasingly great, fighting against the tenacity of the ice, and in\r\nthe end old Ocean has the best of the contest. A huge mass of ice\r\nsnaps off from the glacier-foot and springs to the surface, making the\r\nwaters seethe and swirl with the shock, and sending heavy waves in all\r\ndirections. Then the buoyant mass floats away as a newly made Iceberg.\r\n\r\nSome Icebergs, broken thus from a Greenland glacier, are two or three\r\nhundred feet high. That is to say, a sailor on board a ship can see two\r\nor three hundred feet of solid ice above the surface of the sea. But\r\nthis is by no means the true iceberg height.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk of ice “floating,” we do not mean that the whole piece of\r\nice rests upon the top of the water. It floats _in_ the water. Only\r\nabout one-eighth of it is visible above, and the other seven-eighths\r\nare hidden below. So in the case of an iceberg rising two or three\r\nhundred feet above the sea, we may be sure that at least seven times as\r\nmuch ice is underneath the ocean-surface. This shows what an enormous\r\nmass the whole of a floating ice-mountain must be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ICEBERG, SHOWING THE SECTION UNDER WATER\r\n\r\nFor every cubic foot of ice above water there are seven cubic feet below\r\n\r\n  _Face page 86_\r\n]\r\n\r\nNo wonder that a certain iceberg, which held its head one hundred and\r\nfifty feet high, should have run aground in water five hundred feet\r\ndeep! No wonder, either, that when two such bergs come together,\r\nand an unfortunate ship happens to lie between, it should be smashed\r\nlike an egg-shell. In Baffin’s Bay Dr. Kane once counted a pack of two\r\nhundred and eighty bergs, most of them being between two and three\r\nhundred feet high.\r\n\r\nThe “birth” of such oceanic hills has been watched by travellers, at\r\nthe moment of their breaking off from a glacier-foot, with no small\r\ninterest, and also with no small danger, if they chanced to be within\r\nreach of the terrific billows started by such an event.\r\n\r\nSometimes icebergs come into existence differently. If the glacier\r\ncomes to an end, not in but above the sea, the mass breaks off above\r\nwith its own weight, and plunges downward, to float away on its new\r\ncareer. This was lately witnessed in far southern seas, and the\r\ntravellers barely escaped with their lives, so tremendous was the rush\r\nof the ocean-wave following the plunge of the new mountain.\r\n\r\nA great deal of carrying work is done by icebergs. Many and many a\r\nblock of stone or rock--not to speak of supplies of gravel and sand and\r\nmud--is borne by them to mid-ocean, and there dropped. In the Atlantic\r\nthey seldom get further south than the neighbourhood of Newfoundland.\r\nAs they journey, they slowly weep and trickle out of existence.\r\n\r\nIn the Antarctic both glaciers and icebergs are abundant. The northern\r\nbergs are generally higher and more sharply peaked; the southern bergs\r\nof a flatter shape, but much larger and of a deeper blue.\r\n\r\nSea-water does not freeze so quickly as fresh water. On account of\r\nthe salt which it contains, it does not become solid until it is four\r\ndegrees colder than fresh water needs to be. The freezing-point of\r\nfresh water is 32° F.; that of salt water is 28° F. As ocean-water\r\nfreezes, most of the salt is separated from it; and the ice formed is\r\npractically fresh, though often it holds unfrozen salt water in tiny\r\nhollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  RECEIVING--TO GIVE AGAIN\r\n\r\n  “O end to which our currents tend,\r\n    Inevitable Sea!”--A. H. CLOUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n“All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full.”\r\n\r\nSo wrote the wisest of men, long centuries ago; and the words are true\r\nin a world-wide sense, which the writer with all his wisdom could not\r\nthen have fully grasped.\r\n\r\n“All the rivers” meant to him a great many streams, large and small, in\r\nsouthern Asia, and in southern Europe, with some in northern Africa.\r\n“All the rivers” of the world _now_---- Let us see what it means.\r\n\r\nThe chief work of a river is to drain the land; to bear superfluous\r\nwaters into the great deep. Water lying stagnant on land becomes\r\nharmful. Immense supplies are perpetually needed; but it must be fresh\r\nwater, clear water, running water, water newly fallen from the skies,\r\nor newly received from ever fresh because ever renewed springs. Never\r\nstagnant water.\r\n\r\nSo Earth’s rivers--we are talking of land-rivers now--gathering to\r\nthemselves the multitude of lesser streams and tributaries, which in\r\ntheir turn have been earlier fed by an infinite number of burns and\r\nrunnels in country and town, hurry downward to the Ocean, with rich\r\npresents from the Land. But all the while, Land expects “to receive as\r\nmuch again.”\r\n\r\nWhen we stand beside a broad river, watching the steady flow, hearing\r\nthe little murmurs of sound and the soft suck and “swish” against the\r\nbanks, we do not often realise the greatness of the task which that\r\nriver may have in hand.\r\n\r\nSuppose we are on the banks of the Seine, the mother-stream of gay\r\nParis. Many a century has Paris lived; but the Seine existed countless\r\ncenturies before Paris was ever heard of. Year by year the Seine drains\r\naway surplus water from some twenty-three thousand square miles of\r\nFrench territory. Year by year the Seine carries down to the Ocean a\r\ngift of more than five cubic miles of water. Five hundred cubic miles\r\nin the course of a century!\r\n\r\nOr suppose we turn to the Rhine, that river of castles and legends,\r\nwhich starts with the meltings of over one hundred and fifty glaciers,\r\nand is said to be fed in its course by something like twelve thousand\r\nlesser streams. The Rhine drains, at the very least, between thirty\r\nand forty thousand square miles of country; and it pays to the Ocean\r\nan annual tribute of more than ten cubic miles of water. More than a\r\nthousand cubic miles each hundred years.\r\n\r\nLet us take a look at the Yangtsekiang--a Chinese river of special\r\ninterest for British trade. It drains over six hundred and fifty\r\nthousand square miles of land; and each year it hands over to the Ocean\r\nmore than one hundred and twenty-five cubic miles of water.\r\n\r\nSee the Mississippi. More than a million square miles of American\r\nterritory are drained by it; and its annual gift to the Ocean amounts,\r\nlike that of the great Chinese river, to over one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five cubic miles of water.\r\n\r\nOr once more--take the Amazon. By that mighty stream more than two\r\nmillion square miles of land are drained; and more than five hundred\r\ncubic miles of water are poured annually into the sea. So the Amazon\r\npresents to the Ocean in the course of a year what the Seine presents\r\nin the course of a century.\r\n\r\nIt has been reckoned that “all the rivers” of Earth combined pour\r\nevery year into the sea a mass of water equal to about six thousand\r\nfive hundred cubic miles. This would suffice to fill a vast tank, one\r\nmile broad, one mile deep, reaching the whole way from the north of\r\nScotland to the south of Africa.\r\n\r\n“All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full.” It does not\r\noverflow its limits. And long ago as King Solomon wrote these words, he\r\nwas able to give the reason. “_Unto the place from whence the rivers\r\ncome, thither they return again._”\r\n\r\nThe ocean receives these generous gifts from the land, only to be\r\ngenerous in return. That which the ocean freely accepts she gives\r\nagain, lavishly and royally. Enormous supplies of water are needed on\r\nland, and it is the work of the ocean to meet that need.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world, and especially within the tropics, a constant\r\ndrying up of the sea-surface is going on. This passing away of visible\r\nwater out of sight is, like countless other everyday events, very\r\nextraordinary; though we think nothing of it because of its familiarity.\r\n\r\nA tumbler of water is spilt upon a boarded floor. “Oh, never mind,”\r\nsays a careless voice. “It will soon dry up.” Yes, of course it will;\r\nand who troubles himself to think what the “drying up” means? Particle\r\nby particle the spilt water will creep softly away, not as a liquid but\r\nas a vapour, into the atmosphere, there to float, hidden from sight,\r\nand to be carried hither and thither wherever the air may be moving.\r\n\r\nHad such a thing never been seen before, it would arouse the wonderment\r\nof every thoughtful mind in Europe. But miracles of daily occurrence\r\ncease to be miracles.\r\n\r\nSome few solids, such as camphor, have the same property of passing\r\nslowly out of sight into the air, though it is a much slower process\r\nwith camphor than with water. Snow and ice also, when there is no thaw,\r\ndry off gradually. I have known a whole slight fall of snow disappear\r\nthus, without any thaw.\r\n\r\nVapour is always present in the air; sometimes a large amount, as much\r\nas the atmosphere is able at that particular temperature to hold;\r\nsometimes a less amount, not so much as the air could contain. In the\r\nlatter case “drying” goes on briskly; in the former case it languishes,\r\nand wet clothes, wet pavements, remain long damp.\r\n\r\nWarm air can hide away a much more abundant supply of vapour than cold\r\nair; so the hotter and drier the air, the quicker is the evaporation\r\nor drying-up of water-surfaces. This is remarkably seen in the Red\r\nSea. An amount of water passes away from that sea in a single year,\r\nsufficient to bring down its level some fifteen or twenty feet,--which\r\nit would do, but for a powerful current always flowing in from the\r\nIndian Ocean.\r\n\r\nWhen sea-water thus passes off in vapour, it leaves the salt behind.\r\nWere this amount of evaporation to go on steadily in the Red Sea,\r\nwithout any fresh supplies of water being received, about two thousand\r\nyears would suffice to dry up the whole Sea, nothing but a great mass\r\nof salt remaining in its bed.\r\n\r\nIf the Red Sea alone loses in one year a slice of water, fifteen or\r\ntwenty feet thick, imagine what the enormous quantity must be which is\r\nraised, year by year, from the surfaces of all tropical oceans, and in\r\na less degree from the seas in colder regions. The weight of the whole\r\ncould only be told in hundreds of millions of millions of tons. And\r\nthis vast mass is drawn up, gently and mildly, particle by particle; to\r\nbe wafted by breezes to regions where water is urgently required, and\r\nthere to be poured down as rain upon the thirsty ground. Thus the great\r\nexchange is carried on, with steady sequence, between Land and Ocean,\r\nOcean and Land.\r\n\r\nWhen showers come to gladden the hearts of our farmers, and to provide\r\nfood for the people, they might sometimes give a thought to the\r\nOcean--to the manner in which, with Sun and Air as helpers, he sends\r\naloft millions of tons of water, for the use of those on land.\r\n\r\nFor “unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nThere are parts of the world where rains, like winds, come at regular\r\nand almost unfailing dates. In disappointing years, when they fail, an\r\nEmpire may be disorganised in consequence.\r\n\r\nBut in our British Isles no such regularity has sway; and a pleasing\r\nuncertainty prevails about Weather in general. This gives scope for\r\nsomething to talk about, and something to grumble at. What the average\r\nBriton would do without these perpetual possibilities is a serious\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nNo doubt our Weather _is_ a very uncertain quantity to be reckoned\r\nwith. Yet it may be that we are unfair to our friend the Ocean, who\r\ndoes so much for us in the weather-line--ever at work as he is, night\r\nand day, sending upward supplies of water, bringing to our shore stores\r\nof tropical heat, softening the westerly breezes which excel.\r\n\r\nIs English weather really so bad as is popularly supposed? There are\r\nclimates and climates in the world; some worse, some better. May it not\r\nbe that ours really is, in many respects, not worse but better? Perhaps\r\na slight digression here will be pardoned, for the sake of Old Ocean’s\r\ngood name, in his dealings with the British Isles.\r\n\r\nFoggy days, dull and damp days, are apt to make a more lasting\r\nimpression upon some people’s memories than sunny days. One reason for\r\nthe generally mournful idea of British weather may be due to the fact\r\nthat foreigners, Frenchmen especially, are by nature more light-hearted\r\nthan Englishmen, and that they keep chiefly in mind their sunny days,\r\nwhile we perhaps keep chiefly in mind our dull days.\r\n\r\nTo gain a fair estimate of average British weather, long and careful\r\nobservation is necessary. There is absolutely no safe criterion, save\r\nthat of record-keeping. Not many people have the perseverance to do\r\nthis for any length of time, and few non-scientific people have the\r\nfairness of mind and judgment to do it dependably.\r\n\r\nIt is in my power to tell of a record which has been kept, steadily,\r\ncarefully, perseveringly, by an English lady during many years, and\r\nto give the results at which she arrived. Without being strictly\r\nscientific she was--I have to say “was,” since she has passed from our\r\nmidst--accurate, regular, conscientious, and fair-minded. For all this\r\nI can vouch from personal knowledge. At the same time that she kept\r\nrecords of the weather, she registered day by day the readings of her\r\nthermometer and the daily amount of rainfall. With the two latter we\r\nare not now concerned.\r\n\r\nHer method as to weather-registration was as follows. Four marks were\r\nused: =X= for a thoroughly fine day; =V= for a day in which fine and\r\ndull mingled, but in which the fine predominated; =I= for a day in\r\nwhich again the two mingled, but in which the dull or rain had the\r\nbest of the matter; and =O= for a day which could only be described as\r\ndecidedly bad.\r\n\r\nOf course many days occur which it is difficult to assign to either\r\nclass, especially of the two middle divisions. But a constant endeavour\r\nwas made to keep a fair proportion. If one doubtful day were placed,\r\nfor instance, in the =V= division, the next equally doubtful day would\r\nbe carefully placed in the =I= division, to ensure accuracy.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each month all these four classes were added up\r\nseparately. Also, to simplify results, the Good and the Half-good, the\r\nBad and the Half-bad, were classed in two columns as comprehensively\r\nGood and Bad. From these two columns curious results were obtained.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that the lady in question lived at Reigate, and was\r\nseldom absent from home, never more than for a few weeks at a time.\r\nThe record is thus mainly of one place. Now and again a short absence\r\noccurred, and her observations were then carried on wherever she might\r\nbe; but the absences were so few and generally so short as to be\r\nunimportant.\r\n\r\nBefore going farther, it is worth while for the reader to ask himself,\r\nperhaps also to ask one or two friends, what might be the proportions\r\nof “Good” and “Bad” days that he or they would expect to find in the\r\nEnglish climate, as the result of such a computation?\r\n\r\nWould it be three-quarters bad and one-quarter good? Or could it be\r\npossibly half bad and half good?\r\n\r\nHere is the actual result:--\r\n\r\n  A.D.  Bad Days.  Good Days.\r\n\r\n  1886     89        276\r\n  1887     59        306\r\n  1888     85        280\r\n  1889    107        258\r\n  1890     85        280\r\n  1891     91        274\r\n  1892     77        288\r\n  1893     71        294\r\n  1894    109        242\r\n  1895     88        277\r\n  1896     86        282\r\n\r\nIf the second column be added up, the sum-total amounts to three\r\nthousand and fifty-seven days. If the first column be also added up,\r\nthe sum-total amounts to nine hundred and forty-seven days. A very\r\nsimple calculation, which anybody may work out, will show that the\r\nproportion of “Good” days towards “Bad” days is that of about Three to\r\nOne.\r\n\r\nWho would have thought it? Not certainly the majority of friends to\r\nwhom I have appealed for an opinion. Not even an able scientific man,\r\nwho frankly confessed his astonishment.\r\n\r\nOver three-quarters of fairly Good Weather, as opposed to under\r\none-quarter of fairly Bad Weather--and this the average of eleven\r\nyears! Have we not given the rein too freely to our National grumbling\r\ntendencies? Would it not be better if we thought more of the sunshine,\r\nless of the clouds and rain?\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be of interest to some to know more exactly the\r\nproportions of the four classes during those years. Both in these and\r\nin the former columns it will be noted that one year of the eleven is\r\na few days short of the full length--the year 1894. This seems to have\r\nbeen the only lapse in regularity.\r\n\r\nHere is the fuller statement:--\r\n\r\n  A.D.    Bad.  Half-bad. Half-good. Good.\r\n\r\n  1886     15       74       86       190\r\n  1887     16       43      116       190\r\n  1888     18       67      110       171\r\n  1889     12       95      113       145\r\n  1890     19       66      110       170\r\n  1891     21       70      107       167\r\n  1892     17       60       95       193\r\n  1893     17       54       87       207\r\n  1894     19       90      106       136\r\n  1895     19       69       84       193\r\n  1896     22       64      115       165\r\n\r\nSo if we owe our weather to the Ocean’s influences, it appears that we\r\nhave more to be thankful for than to complain of.\r\n\r\nKing Charles II., wise in word though not in deed, is reported to have\r\nsaid that in England a man could work more days in the open air than in\r\nany other country. Whether this be so or not, it at least shows that\r\nthe Merry Monarch was not one in the army of weather-complainers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  A STORY OF CONFLICT\r\n\r\n  “Thou Sea, who wast to me a prophet deep,\r\n  Through all thy restless waves and wasting shores,\r\n  Of silent labour and eternal change.”--KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween Land and Ocean a ceaseless contest is carried on.\r\n\r\nThe land is always endeavouring to keep its present state unchanged.\r\nThe ocean is ever trying to tear down and demolish the land. Yet the\r\nvery object of the ocean in so doing seems to be that new land may be\r\nraised up with the stolen materials.\r\n\r\nThere are Continents and Islands, moulded long ago, which we see as\r\nfinished structures, that have reached the meridian of their existence\r\nand entered upon their decadence. With many of these Ocean’s efforts\r\nare chiefly employed for destruction. Indeed, in all cases, the power\r\nwhich once erected an island or a continent is at work upon it still,\r\nnot always and only for destruction, but sometimes for modification,\r\naltering its shape, making it larger or smaller, rounding a curve here,\r\nadding a protuberance there, giving finishing touches, and in the end,\r\nif not from the beginning, acting also as spoliator.\r\n\r\nBut the work of building has not ceased; it never does cease. Through\r\nthe ages it has gone on, and it goes on yet. There are embryo islands,\r\nperhaps embryo continents, being now slowly fashioned in Ocean’s\r\nworkshops, not ready for use.\r\n\r\nA great part of the work of land-building takes place in darkness. It\r\nis carried on, not merely from day to day, but from century to century,\r\nnever hasting, never pausing. The materials are brought often from\r\nfar distances, not by men, but by streams, by rivers, by glaciers, by\r\nocean-waters; and the weight of those waters helps to weld the gathered\r\nmaterials into a solid whole.\r\n\r\nAnybody who watches the results of even one heavy downpour of rain on\r\nland may gain some notion of what is going on everywhere.\r\n\r\nIf your house has a soft-water tank, you can hardly have failed to note\r\nhow black the water becomes, after a pelting shower, following upon a\r\ndrought.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, for the rain has washed the roof, and has carried off a\r\nsupply of collected dust and soot. Not the roofs of houses alone, but\r\nthe streets, the walls, the pavements, in a town--the trees, hedges,\r\ngrass, roads, in the country--are all relieved of dusty layers, while,\r\nif the rain be heavy enough, sand and soil also are swept away.\r\n\r\nSometimes they are only taken to a lower level in the same\r\nneighbourhood, but large quantities find their way into the drains or\r\nstreamlets, which join bigger brooks, and thus reach the nearest river,\r\nfinally joining the sea.\r\n\r\nAny moving stream is able to carry along floating materials, which\r\nin still water would sink to the bottom. The faster the current the\r\nheavier is the weight which it can support. A mountain torrent conveys\r\npebbles, grinding them to a smaller size as it rushes along; and some\r\nof the more powerful torrents transport even great stones.\r\n\r\nIf one is sceptical about this lifting power of water, and if one\r\ncannot go to the mountains to see for oneself, the next best thing is\r\nto watch the breaking of waves upon a shingly beach. The pebbles in\r\nrough weather are caught up and whirled about like grains of sand;\r\nand after a severe gale the whole look of a beach is often completely\r\nchanged. The shingle may have been piled to an unusual height, or it\r\nmay have been borne away. So it is easy to recognise that water has no\r\nmean carrying strength.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we saw what huge gifts of water are handed over,\r\nyear by year, from the Land to the Ocean. But the Rivers, acting as\r\nhandmaidens to carry these offerings, do not bestow water only. The\r\nwater-gifts are laden with solid materials, to be used for building\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nA river tears earth and sand from its own banks, and wears down the\r\nstones and rocks in its bed; and to this growing collection, as it\r\nflows, it adds contributions of earth and sand, brought from higher\r\nreaches by its tributary streams. Most of those materials are kept\r\nafloat.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that they are so, we only have to examine the mouth of a\r\nriver. Floating mud and sand may not be apparent in the river itself;\r\nbut just where the river joins the sea, just where the outflowing\r\nstream encounters the inflowing ocean-tides, a bank or banks of mud and\r\nsand may be seen. These are a common feature of river-mouths.\r\n\r\nMany a larger river has at its mouth an enormous network of banks,\r\ndivided by streams, and the whole is described as the “delta” of that\r\nriver; its shape being roughly like the Greek letter “delta,” or like\r\nan opened fan. Everybody has heard of the Delta of the Nile, the Delta\r\nof the Ganges, the Delta of the Mississippi. But hardly a river exists,\r\nno matter how small, which on joining the sea does not make its own\r\nlittle delta.\r\n\r\nAnd the formation of these deltas comes about in a very simple manner.\r\n\r\nSo long as a river flows onward, at a fair pace, it is able to hold\r\nup its floating materials, to keep the earth and sand in its embrace\r\nfrom sinking to the bottom. But when it reaches the sea, its progress\r\nis checked; and no sooner does it slacken speed, than some of its\r\nbuoyed-up materials begin to sink. The heavier kinds are the first to\r\ntouch bottom, getting piled up so as to form a bar or bank; and farther\r\nout, as the stream grows yet more slow, lighter substances find their\r\nway downward, making another bank.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the river, with Ocean’s help, is busily building Land,\r\nforming an island or a group of islands, either of pebbles or sand or\r\nmud. In the case of a great river such islands are often very extensive.\r\n\r\nThe flow of a small river is quickly stopped by the sea, but such\r\npowerful streams as the Ganges or the Nile pour onward for many many\r\nmiles, before they begin to mingle with the salt water, their speed\r\nslackening gradually. Not only do they form great deltas of islands,\r\nbut they carry vast supplies of material far into the ocean.\r\n\r\nRecently an examination was made into the waters of nineteen important\r\nrivers, to discover what quantity of material was carried by each. The\r\nresult of this examination was somewhat startling.\r\n\r\nWe have seen already how many cubic miles of water a river may give\r\nover yearly to the great deep. It was found that, on an average, these\r\nrivers may be reckoned to give over also, _with each cubic mile of\r\nwater_, more than _seven hundred and sixty thousand tons of material_,\r\ntorn from the land. These enormous collections, together with vast\r\nquantities which the waves have dug and wrenched from beaches and\r\ncliffs, are dropped to Ocean’s floor.\r\n\r\nNot indeed generally to her deepest parts. So far as we yet know, the\r\nOcean does not build continents in those black profound abysses, miles\r\ndeep, flat-floored, calm, unchangeable. No traces have been there\r\ndiscovered of such strata as form the Continental parts of Earth’s\r\nCrust. Ocean’s main work, as builder, goes on in “The Transitional\r\nArea;” and most so in that part of it which is called “The Continental\r\nShelf,” where the depth does not exceed about six hundred feet.\r\n\r\n“Transitional” regions are so named because it is believed that some of\r\nthem may once have been Continents, that others of them may yet become\r\nContinents. There was a time, in the long past, when ocean-waters\r\nflowed over all those parts of Earth which now are known to us as\r\ndry land. There may be a time, in the far future, when areas of\r\ncomparatively shallow water will become dry land.\r\n\r\nThrough ages the task of taking materials from the land for building\r\npurposes has been carried on by the Ocean, and it goes on still. The\r\nContinents are being steadily worn away; the Islands are becoming\r\ncontinually smaller.\r\n\r\nWere this to continue always, with no counteracting forces, islands\r\nand continents must in the end disappear. It would take a very long\r\ntime; probably well over six millions of years, at the present rate of\r\ndemolition. Still, however long deferred, the end would be sure.\r\n\r\nBut counteracting forces exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  ABOUT THE LONG PAST\r\n\r\n “The cold and silent past.”--WHITTIER.\r\n\r\n “Thou coveredst it with the Deep as with a garment; the waters stood\r\n above the mountains.”--Ps. civ. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very long past--how long no man can say. Some rash attempts have\r\nbeen made to name the numbers of thousands of years which may have\r\nelapsed since this or that particular stage in the world’s geological\r\nhistory. Such reckonings can possess little or no true value. It is\r\nbetter to confess frankly that we cannot fix dates. We only know that\r\ncertain changes did come about--very long ago.\r\n\r\nOur Earth has not always been as she is now. She has altered greatly.\r\nShe is altering still. Development has gone on through the ages.\r\nDevelopment goes on still.\r\n\r\nContinents and parts of Ocean have, so to speak, changed places.\r\nMountains have risen; and tablelands, high uplifted, have sunk low.\r\nSea-beds have become dry land; and dry lands have become sea-beds.\r\nRivers have carved new paths for themselves; and cataracts have worn\r\naway vast masses of rock, carrying the débris to the sea. Ocean-waves\r\nhave battered down lines of cliffs, and new cliffs have emerged from\r\nunder water. All these things have come about, not in a few years, but\r\nin hundreds of years, in thousands of years, some say in millions of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSuch time-possibilities are not, however, without limits. Sooner or\r\nlater the Astronomer steps in with a--“Hold! Enough! The Sun as a light\r\nand heat giver could not have existed then.”\r\n\r\nBut we may leave such perplexing comparisons and calculations, and may\r\ncontent ourselves with a general--“Very long since!”\r\n\r\nThere was a time when men believed our Earth to be at rest, in the\r\ncentre of a revolving Universe. That notion had to be given up as\r\nknowledge grew. There was a time, far more recent, when we all felt\r\nconfident that this firm ground, on which we live and move, stand and\r\nwork, was solidly calm and immovable. That notion too has had to be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nFor the Earth-crust itself is in motion; certainly in parts; probably\r\nas a whole. Here it is gently heaving upward; there it is slowly\r\nsinking downward. True, we do not see or feel such movements. But\r\nneither do we feel the whirl of our Earth upon her axis, or her rush\r\naround the sun. Neither do we see from hour to hour the growing of a\r\nboy into a man, or the change from a sapling into a tree.\r\n\r\nStraight through from side to side, the Earth measures some eight\r\nthousand miles; and of those eight thousand a very slight “skin” is all\r\nthat we can study, by anything approaching to direct observation. No\r\nwells or mines on land can be sunk so deep as the sailor’s plumbline\r\nin the ocean. If we add the six miles or more of the ocean’s greater\r\ndepths to the five miles or more of Earth’s higher mountains, we have\r\nat most twelve miles, which, compared with the whole diameter of the\r\nEarth, must be looked upon as a mere nothing.\r\n\r\nBy one means we are able to learn something of what lies deeper in the\r\nearth-crust.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen deep wells may be sunk in different places, the same\r\nboring apparatus being used, and the same methods being followed. But\r\nthe same results would not be obtained. Earth’s crust is not one solid\r\ncontinuous substance, like a shell of iron. It is made up of different\r\nsubstances, lying one upon another, or mixed confusedly together. When\r\nmen work their way downwards, in well-sinking or in mine-sinking, they\r\ncome across a great variety of layers, each unlike the rest.\r\n\r\nHere perhaps is a stratum of stiff clay, and there is a deposit of\r\nsandstone. Here hard granite bars the path, and there an easy road\r\nis found through crumbling chalk. Here a great thickness of pebbles\r\nappears, bound together into a rock-like conglomerate; and there seams\r\nof coal alternate with limestone.\r\n\r\nEach whispers a tale of Earth’s past history; and not the same tale.\r\nThey were not all made in the same workshop, or after the same mode.\r\nEach has its own separate biography.\r\n\r\nAnd the various layers do not lie flat and even, one upon another. Once\r\nupon a time they may so have lain, but since those days they have been\r\nmoved and shoved about, tilted and lowered, heaved up and dragged down,\r\nso that some of the upper layers have in places disappeared below the\r\npile, and in other places some of the undermost layers have been pushed\r\nto the top. It is by studying the latter, where they happen to crop\r\nup within reach, that the geologist can learn a little about deeper\r\nportions of the earth-crust and about the rocks of which it is made.\r\n\r\nBy that word “rock” must be understood, not only such hard kinds as\r\ngranite and marble, but softer materials, such as chalks, clays, sands,\r\nand even muds.\r\n\r\nRocks generally have been roughly divided into two classes--the\r\nStratified and the Unstratified.\r\n\r\nStratified Rocks, known also as Sedimentary, have been put together in\r\nthe past, grain by grain, layer by layer, under water, built gradually\r\nthrough ages, and slowly welded into firmness.\r\n\r\nUnstratified Rocks, known also as Igneous, from the Latin word for\r\n“fire,” have been melted down by great heat into a liquid state, and\r\nhave then cooled into solid crystallized masses.\r\n\r\nWhen these fire-made rocks have been heaved up from lower depths and\r\nare exposed to the wearing effects of rain and wind, rivers and waves,\r\nthey too have to part with much of their material, like stratified\r\nrocks, only more slowly, owing to their harder make. These materials\r\nare carried seaward, to be used in the building of fresh stratified\r\nrocks. Then again, some kinds of stratified rocks, when exposed\r\nto intense heat, will crystallize into igneous rocks. So the one\r\nkind may be the child of the other; and many rocks partake of the\r\ncharacteristics of both.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the wearing away of rocks, the destruction of land by\r\nwater, it was said in the close of the last chapter that, but for\r\ncertain “counteracting forces,” the whole of the Continents might in\r\nthe course of ages be slowly carried off by the Ocean, and be buried in\r\nthe mighty deep.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like what, in modern parlance, may be termed “a very large\r\norder.” Who could imagine a feeble substance like water having any\r\neffect upon massive granite cliffs?\r\n\r\nFew people grasp the tremendous battering force of ocean-waves upon\r\na rocky coast, and fewer still realise the wasting power of running\r\nrivers, or of endless successions of raindrops.\r\n\r\nHere is a fact as to the strength of ocean-waves. Some of us may have\r\nwatched the majestic ground-swell which beats upon the western coast\r\nof Scotland. It is said that, upon a rough average, taking smooth and\r\ntempestuous weather together, each summer wave that breaks upon that\r\nshore from the Atlantic does so with a force of over six hundred pounds\r\nupon the square foot. For winter months alone, when gales have sway,\r\nthe average blow rises to about one ton; and some mighty billows are\r\nknown to batter with a weight of three tons.\r\n\r\nSuch a fierce assault as this, continued through thousands of years,\r\nmight well in time wear away the hardest rocks, demolish the loftiest\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\nA counteracting force, however, exists, and has already been named.\r\nOur earth-crust is in motion. Parts of it are sinking, and in those\r\nregions the ocean has the best of the contest; for fight as man may,\r\nraise walls and bulwarks and breakwaters as he will, he can but retard\r\nthe inevitable. If the sinking continue, no matter how sluggishly, he\r\nmust in the end be beaten, and the persistent sea will encroach upon\r\nthe land’s domain. But many coasts are slowly rising, slowly lifting\r\nthemselves out of the sea, slowly shaking themselves free from Ocean’s\r\ndominion; and in those regions, no less inevitably, the action of the\r\nsea is thwarted.\r\n\r\nAs to the why and the wherefore of such Crust-movements, science\r\nsuggests explanations.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, long ago, our Earth was a glowing molten mass. Since\r\nthat period it has been cooling, and it is cooling still. Many facts\r\npoint to the great probability of a still molten centre.\r\n\r\nNot only do we find volcanoes scattered over the Earth, on land and\r\nunder the ocean; but numberless hot-water springs exist, some of them\r\na thousand miles away from any known volcano. Then again, when deep\r\nmining or boring operations take place, it is noted that the degree of\r\nwarmth for a while corresponds to the state of the weather above, but\r\nthat beyond the limits of seasonal change the temperature rises with\r\nincrease of depth. This looks like greater heat below.\r\n\r\nMany scientists have held strongly that, as above suggested, the whole\r\ninside of our Earth is so far heated as to be in a molten condition,\r\ncontained within a cool hard crust, which may be from twenty to fifty\r\nmiles in thickness.\r\n\r\nOthers have maintained that the said crust cannot be less than two\r\nthousand miles thick, with a small molten core.\r\n\r\nOthers believe that the entire Earth is actually solid throughout; the\r\nouter parts from coolness; the inner parts from great pressure.\r\n\r\nAgain, a theory has been started of a solid centre and a solid crust,\r\nwith an intervening “fire-sea” of molten rocks; and another of a\r\ngaseous inner globe, surrounded first by molten layers, then by a firm\r\ninclosing crust.\r\n\r\nAll these different explanations rest upon one foundation--that of a\r\nsteadily cooling Earth--that of a more or less heated interior, and of\r\na hardened crust.\r\n\r\nThe cooling of the inside goes on slowly, and not uniformly, since\r\nconditions differ in different places. As the heated materials become\r\ncooler they lessen in size. Thus the nucleus is constantly getting a\r\nlittle too small for the inclosing crust.\r\n\r\nIf the said crust were a solid shell, compact and strong enough in\r\nall its parts to resist the strain of its enormous weight, it might\r\nbe expected to keep its shape and position unchanged, holding loosely\r\nwithin itself the shrinking centre. But it is formed of a great number\r\nof materials, some hard, some soft and yielding. Therefore, as the\r\ncentral parts lessen in size, the crust sinks downwards, and in so\r\ndoing it wrinkles into huge folds, like the rind of a shrivelling\r\norange or the skin of a very old man’s face. A ridge is pushed up here;\r\na furrow extends there. Here a long range of mountains is found; there\r\nwe see a succession of valleys.\r\n\r\nBy these movements the Ocean is both helped and hindered in its\r\n“building.” As new land is formed under water, the “crust-creep”\r\nperhaps raises it gently, and a strip of sea becomes dry land.\r\nBut another portion of the work, that of pulling land to pieces,\r\nis checked; for let the waves strive as they may to wear away a\r\ncoast-line, a very slight upheaval is enough to counterbalance their\r\nutmost exertions.\r\n\r\nSuch changes are usually gradual--so quiet, so deliberate, as only to\r\nbecome apparent in the course of centuries.\r\n\r\nNot that crust-movements are always sluggish. The ceaseless sinking\r\nand crinkling of vast extents of country, the crowding together into a\r\nsmaller space of immense masses of material, cannot but cause enormous\r\npressure; and here or there a portion suddenly _gives_ under the\r\nstrain. Then the ground shakes and heaves, or some terrible landslip\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are now looked upon generally as signs of abrupt yielding\r\nto intense pressure. Sometimes they indicate that a huge weight of\r\nmaterial deep down has slid to a lower level, packing more closely\r\nor pushing aside other masses, and causing what miners call “a\r\nfault”--that is a break or dislocation in the regular lines of the\r\nstratified rocks. Or slip after slip may take place, one mass being\r\ndisturbed by the movements of a neighbouring mass; and so the ground\r\nabove may tremble again and again with recurring shocks.\r\n\r\nSuch shocks are fearfully common in some parts. In Japan, for instance,\r\nit was noted that nine thousand had been felt in the course of only\r\neight years; and in one great earthquake alone--that of October 26th,\r\n1891--almost ten thousand human beings perished.\r\n\r\nMovements of the crust, whether slow or rapid, are not due always and\r\nonly to the shrinkage of the central portions of our globe, and to the\r\nsinking and re-adjustment of the strata.\r\n\r\nThere are mighty fire-forces below; molten materials pent up, waiting\r\nfor the slightest yielding of the solid crust to fight their way\r\nout; heated and imprisoned gases struggling for freedom. Sometimes\r\nthese captive giants escape through what may be termed the orthodox\r\nsafety-valves, old volcanic vents. Sometimes they break open new\r\ncraters for themselves. Sometimes they fail to get out, and only shake\r\nthe ground, or force it gently upward. Though earthquakes are more\r\nusually ascribed to the effects of a steady “crust-creep,” they are\r\nsometimes caused by heated gases seeking liberty.\r\n\r\nThese heavings and twistings, these crumplings and swayings, of the\r\nearth-crust do not belong only to land, but go on in the same manner\r\nunder the ocean. Many an earthquake felt on land has its origin under\r\nthe sea; and others are so far out as to be felt only by passing ships.\r\nIn the Pacific alone it is said that about two thousand five hundred\r\nshocks occur in the course of a year. Of the eight or ten thousand\r\nshocks, believed to be about the average number throughout the world\r\nannually, fully half have their origin beneath ocean-waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  OLD OCEAN AS A BUILDER\r\n\r\n  “Grain by grain His Hand\r\n  Numbers the unmeasurable sand.”--C. G. ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\n  “... The ever changing strand\r\n    Of shifting and unstable sand\r\n  Which wastes beneath the steady chime\r\n    And beating of the waves.”--WHITTIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a vast Cathedral is made of separate blocks of stone, laid one\r\nupon another and cemented together, so a stratified rock is formed of\r\ntiny particles of substance, placed one over another and pressed into\r\nsolidity.\r\n\r\nLet us scoop up a little sand from the sea-shore, and look at it under\r\na magnifying-glass.\r\n\r\nWe shall find a number of loose yellow grains, not all alike in\r\nshape, but all somewhat rounded. Most of them are characterised by a\r\nglittering hardness, and probably some are transparent.\r\n\r\nFor the most part these grains are of a substance called _quartz_,\r\nwhich may be almost any colour from white to black. Some beautiful\r\nforms of it are known to us, such as amethyst, agate, and jasper. But\r\nwe have now to do with the humbler relatives of those aristocratic\r\ngems; with the more commonplace kinds of quartz, such as sandstone.\r\n\r\nSandstone rock is chiefly made of grains of sand, firmly compacted\r\ntogether. An especial interest belongs to the rounded shape of these\r\nlittle grains. Like many voiceless things in the world of inanimate\r\nNature, it tells its own tale, if only we will pause to hear.\r\n\r\nWhy should grains of sand be rounded? Why not square, or pointed, or\r\nangular?\r\n\r\nThat is just what they were, not very long ago. Each sand-speck,\r\nwhen first detached from rock or stone, had its angles and corners.\r\nBut these have been gradually rubbed away; and by the very same\r\nprocess which, in the course of years, rubs away angularities and\r\neccentricities from the characters of human beings.\r\n\r\nThe work has been done through contact with its neighbours--not by an\r\noccasional rub, but by steady friction, long continued. Each grain of\r\nsand, rubbing against and being rubbed by its companion-grains, has\r\nbeen rounded, smoothed, polished, till it has grown into the finished\r\nspecimen, without any obtrusive points or disagreeable angles remaining.\r\n\r\nAn unpleasant discipline, perhaps; yet, in the case of sand-grains and\r\nalso of human beings, worth undergoing for the sake of results.\r\n\r\nLooked upon from a geological point of view, this shape of the\r\nsand-grains means merely the wearing and wasting away of substance,\r\nwith no pretty explanation attached, though with a very definite\r\nunderlying story of their past history.\r\n\r\n“No workman ever manufactured a half-worn article, and the stones\r\nwere all worn.” So wrote Hugh Miller when describing his first boyish\r\nexperience of toil in a Scotch quarry twenty years earlier. Boy as he\r\nthen was, his keen eyes noted the stones, “rounded and water-worn,\r\nas if they had been tossed in the sea or in the bed of a river for\r\nhundreds of years.” Boy as he was, he knew that stones, broken off from\r\nlarger stones or rocks, have at first their irregular shapes, their\r\ncorners and jagged points, which can only be worked into smoothness\r\nby the action of water. Boy as he was, he realised that these quarry\r\ninland stones had once been rubbed and shaped by ocean-waves.\r\n\r\nHe made a mistake in his assertion. Some workmen do manufacture\r\narticles, not indeed really half-worn, but with the look of being\r\nhalf-worn though actually new, for mercantile purposes--to pass off\r\nthe new, as if it were old, when the old has greater value. But it may\r\nsafely and with confidence be declared that the Divine Architect of\r\nEarth and Heaven never so puts forth His mighty power. When we see in\r\nNature a thing _worn_ in appearance we know that it has been worn in\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nIn his first day of quarry work Hugh Miller saw more than this. He\r\nnoted surfaces of sandstone rock, laid bare by blasting, all “ridged\r\nand furrowed, like a bank of sand that had been left by the tide an\r\nhour before.” He had seen the latter hundreds of times when sailing\r\nover shallows near the shore. But here the ridges and furrows were\r\npetrified, changeless, and on dry land, where no ocean-waves could\r\nreach. No wonder he was puzzled.\r\n\r\nSuch ripple-marked sandstone is far from uncommon. It gives a perfect\r\nreproduction of the little sand-ripples or rounded ridges and hollows,\r\noften to be found on a sandy shore, either visible through a thin layer\r\nof water or left bare after the tide goes down. And it shows us how the\r\nsandstone rock must originally have been put together, under water.\r\nSoft undulations were made in the wet sand by one high tide, becoming\r\nin a measure hardened before the next high tide, and so keeping their\r\nshapes, while a fresh supply of sand was dropped upon them, partaking\r\nof the same outlines.\r\n\r\nAs time passed, more and more sand would be thus deposited, the ground\r\nprobably sinking and the weight of sand increasing, until the lower\r\nlayers had stiffened into rock. In after days a slow upheaval of the\r\nground came about, and where ocean waters had flowed would be dry land.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by--who can say how long after?--the ripple-marked slabs of\r\nsandstone, petrified memorials of the past, would be found; perhaps far\r\ninland, if the country had risen much; perhaps in a quarry by a young\r\nScotch working-lad, to be marvelled over as a specimen of old Ocean’s\r\nbygone work.\r\n\r\nAnother such token of the past is found in hardened raindrop traces,\r\nimpressed on solid sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe rain fell on a soft sandy shore, making tiny holes in the sand,\r\nwith splashed-up ridges round each small hole. Have we not all seen\r\nthis? If not, we might have used our eyes better. Before the coming\r\nin of the next tide the surface hardened, like the sand-ridges already\r\ndescribed, and so, being covered over by new layers of sand and\r\ngradually transformed into rock, it was later uplifted above the sea,\r\nand the holes have lasted intact until now.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that the time between one high tide and another is\r\nhardly long enough for any such hardening process--even on the hottest\r\nand driest of summer days.\r\n\r\nThen the hardening may have taken place only on that slender belt of\r\nsand, which is covered for a day or two by the spring tides, and is not\r\nagain reached by ocean-waves for nearly a fortnight.\r\n\r\nIn earlier chapters it was shown--first, how the Ocean is ever striving\r\nto keep a level surface; and secondly, how the object sought is never\r\nattained to.\r\n\r\nNot only are the waters in ceaseless motion, heaving to and fro under\r\nthe influence of every passing breeze, borne hither and thither by\r\nmighty streams, disturbed by innumerable storms. But also the powerful\r\nattraction of the land, particularly of great mountain ranges, lifts\r\nthe sea-surface in some regions hundreds of feet higher than in others.\r\nSo that a ship, passing from the neighbourhood of a mountainous coast\r\nto mid-ocean, may be actually sailing or steaming downhill, actually\r\ndescending a vast gentle watery slope.\r\n\r\nAnother question as to Ocean’s level has much exercised the minds of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world, remains of sea-creatures in countless multitudes\r\nare found embedded in the substance of water-built rocks: sometimes the\r\nvery rocks being made up of them. This, not only on the tops of lesser\r\nhills, but at the summits of mountains eight thousand feet high, twelve\r\nthousand feet high, sixteen or eighteen thousand feet high.\r\n\r\nVery ancient remains they often are, certainly many tens of thousands\r\nof years old. But whatever their age may be, they echo and add to the\r\nstory which is told by the rocks themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom the rocks we learn that, once upon a time, long ago, they were put\r\ntogether, scrap by scrap, under water, not upon dry land. And from the\r\nfossil remains in those rocks we learn with equal certainty that, once\r\nupon a time, they lay under ocean-waters.\r\n\r\nFossil remains, buried in rocks, are of many kinds.\r\n\r\nNot only relics of animals, or of parts of animals, such as teeth\r\nand bones and shells. Not only relics of sea-weeds and other ocean\r\nvegetation. Not merely the actual remains, hardened into stone; but\r\nalso the casts or shapes of all such remains, found impressed in the\r\nsubstance of the rocks. The whole of these various records of the past\r\nmust be included under the term “fossils.”\r\n\r\nFirmer substances, like shells and bones, have become often transformed\r\ninto actual solid stone. But softer living substances have more\r\nfrequently passed out of existence, leaving only an impress or _cast_,\r\nwhich is filled up later by some other substance.\r\n\r\nWhen upon high mountain-tops such fossils are found--the remains\r\nof sea-weeds and sea-creatures embedded in rock--the question must\r\nnaturally arise, How could these ocean-inhabitants have found their way\r\nto such a height?\r\n\r\nThat the sea must once have flowed over them cannot be doubted. But\r\nhow did it come about? Were those water-built heights under the sea,\r\nbecause in those times the land lay lower, or because the sea-surface\r\nstood higher?\r\n\r\nThat the earth-crust is restless, heaving, disposed to rise and sink,\r\nto crumple into furrows, to fold into ravines and mountain ranges, we\r\nnow know. Yet this may not be the whole explanation of sea-shells upon\r\nhigh summits. It may be also that the surface of the sea itself--the\r\ngeneral level of the ocean--has not been always the same. It too may\r\nhave risen and sunk; not once only, but many times.\r\n\r\nBetween one and two hundred years ago there was a theory that the\r\nsea had as a whole sunk lower, on account of the enormous drying up\r\nof its surface. Of course the surface does dry up very much and very\r\nrapidly. Yet this deficit in ocean-waters being met by equally enormous\r\ndown-pourings of rain and gifts of river-water, evaporation will not\r\nserve to account for a lowered ocean-level all over the earth. So the\r\nnotion had to be given up; and in later years it was looked upon as\r\ncertain that the land must have risen, and that the ocean-level must\r\nhave been changeless.\r\n\r\nUntil recently this was regarded as established; but in the curious\r\nsee-saw of scientific theories the pendulum has begun to swing back.\r\n\r\nNot all the way. That the land has risen in parts, shaking its skirts\r\nfree from ocean-tides, is not doubted. Scientists are, however,\r\nmaintaining that while this is true, the other need not be untrue. They\r\nhold that, while land in many places has undoubtedly risen and sunk,\r\nthe ocean-surface may have risen and sunk also.\r\n\r\nThe ocean could not, indeed, like the land have risen or sunk only\r\nin parts. Except where it is forcibly held at a higher level by some\r\nstrong force of local attraction, this would be impossible. Yet causes\r\nmight exist which should affect the whole ocean-surface.\r\n\r\nOne such may be mentioned. The rising or sinking of great tracts of\r\nland could not fail to affect the ocean-level.\r\n\r\nThat it must do so may be easily understood. Let us fill a basin with\r\nwater, to within an inch of the brim, and then slowly lower into\r\nthe water a ball, or any other solid body. As the ball enters, the\r\nlevel of the water rises--_must_ rise. Then let us slowly lift the\r\nball out again; and as it leaves the water, the level of the latter\r\nsinks--_must_ sink.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same result would follow upon the rising or sinking of\r\nsome great continental mass. When it rises, the ocean contains less\r\nland, and the water-level must go down. When it sinks, the ocean\r\ncontains more land, and the water-level must go up.\r\n\r\nThis question has been long under discussion. For many years, as with\r\nother questions, each side looked upon its own view for the time being\r\nas the only right one. But--as again with many difficult problems--the\r\nfairer and wider view recognises the possibility of truth in both\r\nexplanations, and probably in the end both will prove to be in a\r\nmeasure right.\r\n\r\nMany other kinds of rock, as well as sandstone, have been built under\r\nocean-waters in past ages, constructed of minute particles, piled\r\ntogether, and hardened. Some sorts, like sandstone, are only or chiefly\r\nmineral; while others are only or chiefly “organic”--that is, are\r\nmainly composed of the remains of “organised” or living beings. About\r\nthe latter much has to be said in future chapters.\r\n\r\nA very few words in the close of this chapter, as to the classifying of\r\ndifferent kinds of Rocks, may not be amiss.\r\n\r\nOcean-deposits, or Ocean-buildings, are often roughly divided into\r\nthree groups.\r\n\r\nIn “Deep-Sea Deposits” are included all that lie beyond the\r\nHundred-fathom Line, or a depth of six hundred feet.\r\n\r\nIn “Shallow-water Deposits” are included all that lie between six\r\nhundred feet deep and low-water mark.\r\n\r\nIn “Littoral Deposits”--the word coming from the Latin for\r\n“shore”--are included all deposits that lie on shore-lines, between the\r\nhighest and the lowest tides.\r\n\r\nAt first sight the tide-deposits might seem to be but a small matter.\r\nNot so small, really! Earth’s coast-lines reach to something like one\r\nhundred and twenty-five thousand miles in length. Since the medium\r\nbreadth of ground affected by tides is about half-a-mile, the whole\r\ntidal area amounts to over sixty thousand square miles.\r\n\r\nNo mean workshop this, under the auspices of crushing and grinding\r\nbillows. On shore-lines building takes place rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe “Shallow” zone is much more extensive, reaching to some ten\r\nmillions of square miles. Its principal deposits are much the same as\r\nthose of the tidal zone--muds, sands, gravels, pebbles. In parts of the\r\nEarth they also include volcanic and coral muds.\r\n\r\nGreater, far greater, far more widely reaching, are the regions of\r\n“Deep-Sea Deposits,” which cover more than one-half of the whole\r\nsurface of our globe.\r\n\r\nIn those cold and dark and silent workshops, hidden from the eyes of\r\nmen, building goes on, very quietly, very slowly, through interminable\r\nages. In those workshops are deposited divers materials--Red Clay, Red\r\nMud, Blue Mud, Green Mud, Volcanic Mud, Diatom Ooze, Globigerina Ooze,\r\nand many others, forming Ocean’s carpet.\r\n\r\nAlmost any of these muds and oozes may occasionally be found in the\r\nsecond division, but they more generally belong to the “Deep Sea.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  HOW CHALK IS MADE\r\n\r\n  “Peace, moaning Sea, what tale have you to tell,\r\n  What mystic tidings, all unknown before?\r\n  Whether you break and thunder on the shore,\r\n  Or whisper like the voice within the shell,\r\n  O moaning Sea, I know your burden well!”\r\n        LEWIS MORRIS.\r\n\r\n  “The tiny cell is forlorn,\r\n  Void of the little living will.”--TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the tasks carried on in Ocean waters is Chalk-Building.\r\n\r\nThe “White Cliffs of Albion” and those also of Gaul are vast masses of\r\nchalk, containing layers of flint, and mixed with many other materials,\r\nbut chiefly composed of the crumbling white substance, which is\r\nfamiliar to all who live near the North and South Downs.\r\n\r\nThis formation stretches a long way. The heights of Salisbury are of\r\nchalk. The Chiltern Hills are of chalk. The Yorkshire Wolds are of\r\nchalk. It is found in Norfolk; it is found in Kent; it is found in\r\nSurrey; it is found in Sussex. There are chalk-beds in France, in\r\nGermany, in other parts of Europe--not to speak of Asia--which, with\r\nthose of Great Britain, extend through many hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\nAnd wherever these masses of chalk are found, there we know that, once\r\nupon a time, the land lay under ocean-waves.\r\n\r\nFor Chalk, like Sandstone, was not formed on dry land. It could not be\r\nformed on dry land. It was built--it could only be built--under the\r\nsea, to be in later ages uplifted as dry land.\r\n\r\nDuring those far-back days, when the chalk-beds of Europe were being\r\nmade, a different state of things prevailed from that of the present.\r\nBy far the greater part of Europe must have lain under water, from\r\nwhich the summits of the Alps, the Pyrenees, and other mountains\r\nemerged as groups of islands. Great Britain must have been chiefly or\r\nentirely hidden.\r\n\r\nSo far I have spoken of sandstone and chalk together. But a marked\r\ndistinction--a _vital_ distinction--exists between the two.\r\n\r\nIn the mode of their building they may be alike. In the materials of\r\nwhich they are built they are utterly different.\r\n\r\nIf a lump of chalk is examined by the chemist, its principal substance\r\nis found to be Carbonate of Lime.\r\n\r\nNow there is something very remarkable about Carbonate of Lime. It is\r\nabsolutely different from the materials of which sandstone and granite\r\nare made. Wherever we stumble upon carbonate-of-lime, there we are on\r\nthe track of LIFE. And the moment that we touch upon LIFE, even in its\r\nsimplest and lowest forms, we rise to a higher level.\r\n\r\nHitherto, in this subject of the Mighty Deep, we have had to do\r\nwith things inanimate; things without consciousness; things blindly\r\ncontrolled by the forces of nature. In the story of ocean-waters, of\r\nocean-salt, of ocean-rivers, of icebergs and ice-floes, Life has no\r\npart. There is no life in a grain of sand, no life in a granite rock.\r\n\r\nBut here, suddenly, we are arrested. Here, in the composition of Chalk,\r\nwe come across a difference. Here, at one step, we pass over a vast\r\ndividing chasm, and stand face to face with that which has Life.\r\n\r\nNot indeed that which lives now, but with that which did live, the\r\nsigns of which may better help us to understand Life in the present.\r\n\r\nIs this so new? Have we not already in former chapters found tokens of\r\ncreatures which once existed, of fossil remains embedded in rock?\r\n\r\nYes; but that was not the same. Fossil remains are discovered in many\r\nkinds of stratified rock. Here we are not concerned with separate\r\nremains, buried in masses of chalk, but with the actual substance\r\nof chalk itself. The mere building of it, as earlier told, closely\r\nresembles the building of sandstone. Chalk, like sandstone, was formed\r\nin past ages out of tiny particles, carried by ocean-waves, dropped\r\nupon ocean’s bed, slowly consolidated, then gradually upheaved.\r\nParticles of----\r\n\r\nAh, there we reach the great distinction!\r\n\r\nNot particles of inanimate mineral substances, such as grains of\r\nquartz. No; but particles which once formed the habitation of living\r\ncreatures. More than this--particles which once shared in the Life of\r\nthe beings with which for the time they were in touch. Infinitesimal\r\nspecks, often so minute as to appear only as fine dust to man’s unaided\r\nsight; yet real organic remains, each one of which has been the home of\r\nan active animal.\r\n\r\nA lump of chalk is a mass of densely packed tiny fossil shells, more\r\nor less crushed and broken. It has been reckoned that a cubic inch of\r\nchalk probably holds at least one million shells.\r\n\r\nTry to imagine what this means. The work of the Ocean in building solid\r\nsandstone, from unnumbered myriads of myriads of grains of sand, is\r\nmarvellous enough. But here we have something far more wonderful.\r\n\r\nHere we have rocks and cliffs, ranges of hills and extents of country,\r\nto a great degree composed of almost invisible sea-shells, so small, so\r\nnumerous, that a million or more of them may be packed into one little\r\ncubic inch of space, while the chalk-beds lie through hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\nThink of continuous piles of these shells, many hundreds of feet in\r\nthickness, all built out of the dead shells of dying millions of tiny\r\ncreatures. Deep, deep below the surface, where waves had no power,\r\nwhere currents were sluggish, fell a ceaseless gentle rain of these\r\nminute shells. Life had fled from each jelly inhabitant; its brief day\r\nwas over; and the empty shell went quietly down, whether from near the\r\nsurface or from lower depths, till it reached the ocean-bed. There it\r\nlay, forming part of a gathering sticky ooze or mud, which in later\r\ntimes should be slowly hardened into chalk.\r\n\r\nBut the greater wonder has yet to be told about these shells--these\r\ntiny highly-finished constructions.\r\n\r\nNot only did a speck of living jelly once inhabit each shell. That\r\nspeck of living jelly actually MADE the shell.\r\n\r\nNot deliberately. Not with intention. Not even consciously. The\r\n“making” is in no sense to be confounded with voluntary effort, with\r\nthe labour which means exertion and fatigue. It was as instinctive, as\r\ninvoluntary, as the “making” of bones in your body and mine.\r\n\r\n“But we do not make our bones,” somebody may protest, with a touch of\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, in a sense, we do. The jelly-speck does not more surely\r\n“secrete” its shell, than a man “secretes” his skeleton. Personal will\r\nhas not to do with the task in either case, beyond the taking in of\r\nnecessary food; and neither man nor jelly-speck may claim any credit on\r\nthe score of the pattern worked out.\r\n\r\nWe have all seen a garden-snail, carrying lightly upon its back\r\nits shell or “house,” or outside skeleton. That shell is formed\r\nof carbonate-of-lime. In the snail’s slimy body exists a small\r\nmanufactory for producing or “secreting” carbonate-of-lime. The\r\nmaterials are obtained by the snail through its food. The deposits\r\nof it--made as the snail’s nature, certainly not the snail’s\r\nreason--dictates, grow into a sheltering framework for its protection.\r\n\r\nIn a Dictionary we may find the strict meaning of this word “secrete.”\r\nIt is given as--“to hide; to conceal; to deposit in some secret or\r\nprivate place; to separate from the blood in animals, or from the sap\r\nin vegetables, and elaborate into a new product.”\r\n\r\nOne cannot deny that the word, though used for all such “elaborations,”\r\nis more appropriate in the case of a man’s hidden and private framework\r\nof bones, than in a snail’s or jelly-creature’s outside shell.\r\n\r\nThat which the garden-snail so deftly does, is done also by countless\r\nbillions of minute jelly-specks in the ocean; though with the latter\r\nthe mechanism is far simpler, because the animal belongs to a far lower\r\nand more primitive type.\r\n\r\nStill, simple though the apparatus may be, the tiniest of these\r\njelly-specks has power to separate lime from ocean-waters, to unite it\r\nwith carbonic acid in its own frame, to form carbonate-of-lime from\r\nthe two, and to build of the manufactured carbonate-of-lime a shell for\r\nits own use.\r\n\r\nThenceforward, for a little space, the jelly-speck lives in that shell,\r\nand feeds in that shell, and then it dies in that shell. When it exists\r\nno longer, down sinks the lifeless skeleton, to serve a new purpose at\r\nthe bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nNo mere shapeless lumps are these shells, flung together without care\r\nor plan. Each one, however infinitesimal in size, is a delicate and\r\nelaborate construction; each one shows the carrying out of a definite\r\nand beautiful plan. A different design serves for each species and kind\r\nof jelly-speck--not for each individual.\r\n\r\nSuch Design we must ascribe to a Mind lying beyond that which we see;\r\nnot to the jelly-speck itself, which acts as an unconscious architect,\r\nworking automatically, as you and I work in the early growth and later\r\nrenewal of our bony frameworks, the “secreting” of our skeletons.\r\n\r\nNo chance tossing together of particles of carbonate-of-lime could\r\nresult in the exquisite forms, the intricate patterns, of these little\r\nshells; still less, in such patterns being faithfully reproduced by\r\nmillions of living jelly-specks, each according to its own class or\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nFor all this the present tense is as true as the past tense.\r\n\r\nThose white cliffs along the coast were formed ages ago. But the ocean\r\nis working still, building still, piling grains of sand together still,\r\nheaping specks of mud together still, and laying shells, shells,\r\nshells, together still, in amounts beyond all reckoning.\r\n\r\nChalk-building went on in ages past; it goes on now; and doubtless it\r\nwill go on in centuries to come.\r\n\r\nNot only beyond reckoning, but beyond imagination, are the enormous\r\nmultitudes of these creatures, which live and die in the ocean, forming\r\ntheir shells, and adding their skeletons to the ever-growing pile below.\r\n\r\nOver a large part of the Atlantic bed, as over other Ocean-beds too,\r\nlies a thick ooze. When this was first brought to the surface, in\r\nsoundings that were made before the laying of the earliest Atlantic\r\ncable, it was supposed to mean a thin deposit of no particular\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThen a deep-sea dredge, plunged into the ooze, carried away half-a-ton\r\nof it, and men began to realise what its presence might mean. By a long\r\nsuccession of soundings, its true nature became slowly manifest.\r\n\r\nThe ooze was found to be composed chiefly of tiny rounded shells,\r\ncalled “Globigerina,” which belong to a larger class, known as\r\n“Foraminifera.” And the white chalk of our British cliffs is made\r\nprincipally of Foraminifera shells.\r\n\r\nThis last name springs from two Latin words, meaning “I bear a hole.”\r\nThe Foraminifera shells bear many holes. Each is in shape a tiny\r\ncollection of rounded compartments, usually not more than sixteen in\r\nnumber; and each compartment has numerous minute holes in its walls.\r\n\r\nIts inhabitant, a speck of jelly, is one of the least of living\r\ncreatures, belonging to the great Division of “Protozoa,” or “First\r\nAnimals.” None rank below them, for they are on the first or lowest\r\nrung in the ladder of life.\r\n\r\nA jelly-speck has no head, no limbs, no stomach, not even a mouth. It\r\ncan take in food at any part of its soft body. When it wishes--and\r\napparently even a jelly-speck can _wish_, which at once separates it\r\nfrom inanimate materials--it makes a temporary tentacle or “foot,” by\r\npushing out a slender filament of its own substance through one of the\r\ntiny holes in its shell. Whence the name “Rhizopod.”\r\n\r\nNot all the Foraminifera specks live in the same kind of sheltering\r\nskeletons. Some construct delicate domes or many-chambered discs of\r\nsand-grains, joined together with enough carbonate-of-lime to act as\r\nbuilding-cement. Such skeletons are called “tests,” to distinguish them\r\nfrom “shells” proper.\r\n\r\nHardly anything can be more remarkable than the way in which these\r\ntests are put together by mere specks of jelly, alive indeed, but\r\nwithout parts, without development, without understanding. How and why\r\nthey should choose from one place, each the especial materials which go\r\nto form its own kind of “test,” is one of the mysteries in Nature for\r\nwhich Science has no explanation. We can but look and marvel.\r\n\r\nOne kind of jelly-speck will use the larger grains of quartz, arranging\r\nthem, and joining them into a bottle-shaped test or shelter.\r\n\r\nAnother, in the same spot, belonging to a different species, will\r\nselect tinier grains of the same substance, and will build out of them\r\na rounded sphere, exquisitely modelled, with tiny holes at intervals\r\nfor the protruding “limbs.”\r\n\r\nAnother, of yet a different species, picks out the minutest of\r\nsand-grains and of bits of sponge-spicules, and knits them together,\r\nwithout any cement, into delicate white globes, “like homœopathic\r\nglobules,” giving to each a single opening.\r\n\r\nAnd still another, of again a different species, forms a test of divers\r\ncompartments, with a tiny doorway leading from each into the next.\r\n\r\nBehind all these extraordinary constructions lies a MIND. But--_not_\r\nthe mind of the jelly-speck!\r\n\r\nSoft oozes, formed chiefly of Foraminifera and other shells, varying\r\nin size from a pin’s head to almost invisible specks--though some few\r\nkinds are larger--cover immense reaches of the ocean-bed, extending, it\r\nis said, over fifty millions of square miles.\r\n\r\nYet they are not found everywhere below the sea. Near to Continents,\r\nif they exist they are lost sight of amid the masses of sand and mud\r\ncarried down from the land. And in the profounder abysses of the ocean\r\nthey are lacking.\r\n\r\nThis last fact was long a puzzle. If the waters above were swarming\r\nwith live Foraminifera, the dead shells of which must be ever pouring\r\nin a quiet rain to the ocean-bed, why should not the same ooze be found\r\nthere, as elsewhere?\r\n\r\nThat the waters above, at least in all warmer climates, do swarm thus,\r\nis certain. Towards north and south, in colder seas, they rapidly\r\nlessen; but in tropical regions, and in warm ocean-streams their\r\nnumbers are legion. Yet, from depths beyond about two miles, the ooze\r\nwas not brought up.\r\n\r\nOne explanation can be given; and it is that of the strong dissolving\r\npower of sea-water. After a depth of about two miles, the delicate\r\nlittle shells fail to resist that power. Once at the bottom, they might\r\nbe covered up and preserved; but they cease to exist _en route_ thither.\r\n\r\nSo in this as in many other instances, we see opposite forces at\r\nwork. The one force is perpetually undoing what the other force is\r\nperpetually doing. Innumerable multitudes of living creatures are at\r\nwork, taking lime from the water, and constructing carbonate-of-lime.\r\nBut the ocean is ever seeking to re-dissolve that carbonate-of-lime.\r\n\r\nAnother difficult question as to the ooze was--whether the shells of\r\nwhich it is mainly made were those of Foraminifera living in the deep\r\nsea, far down below the surface, or of Foraminifera living near the\r\nsurface. Able men took both sides of the discussion, some ascribing the\r\nooze entirely to deep-sea jelly-specks, others ascribing it entirely to\r\nsurface jelly-specks.\r\n\r\nThe question cannot be said yet to have met with complete settlement.\r\nBut here once more it seems that both sides have been partly in the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThere are Foraminifera which live only at great depths, and there are\r\nForaminifera which live only near the surface. The ooze is found to\r\nconsist of shells belonging to both kinds, though it may be that the\r\nsurface species carry away the palm in point of greater multitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  OF OCEAN-WEEDS\r\n\r\n                    “Have hung\r\n  My dank and dripping weeds.”--Trans. HORACE.\r\n\r\n  “The tide is full, the moon lies fair\r\n  Upon the Straits; on the French Coast the light\r\n  Gleams, and is gone; the Cliffs of England stand,\r\n  Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.”\r\n        MATTHEW ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nScattered through the vast Chalk-beds of Great Britain and the\r\nContinent are thousands of layers of FLINT, such layers as any of us\r\nmay have seen intersecting the smooth white face of Chalk Cliffs. And\r\nas with Chalk, so with Flint--we at once find ourselves upon the track\r\nof Life.\r\n\r\nNot indeed always of animal life. Sometimes vegetable life takes its\r\nplace. Though the highest Vegetables stand on a lower level than the\r\nlowest Animals, they too have Life, and thereby they are entirely apart\r\nfrom the whole world of inanimate Nature.\r\n\r\nWidely distinct are the Animal Kingdom and the Vegetable Kingdom; yet\r\non the borderland between the two is found a hazy belt of uncertainty.\r\n\r\nSo gently does the one glide into the other that, though a line of\r\ndemarcation does exist, it is not always easily made out. But the\r\ntransition from the lowest form of that which _lives_ to any and every\r\nform of that which has no Life is abrupt, absolute, precipitous.\r\nHere we see no quiet sliding of the one into the other, no wavering\r\nhesitancy as to whether a certain something may belong to this or that\r\nside of the dividing parapet.\r\n\r\nThe term “Vegetables,” used scientifically about Land Vegetation,\r\nincludes all manner of growths, from the lichen to the forest tree.\r\nBut by that word, used in connection with the Ocean, is meant, _not_\r\ncabbages and cauliflowers, _not_ garden-plants or forest-trees, but an\r\nenormous variety of Sea-Weeds.\r\n\r\nAnd among ocean-vegetables of humblest form, flourishing in salt water,\r\nis that of Diatoms--Flint-makers.\r\n\r\nIt need not be imagined that the manufacture of Flint is a monopoly of\r\nthe Diatom tribe. That would be a mistake.\r\n\r\nWe have had to do in the last chapter with small carbonate-of-lime\r\nbuilding jelly-specks. We shall have to do in the next chapter with\r\ncarbonate-of-lime building jelly-polyps. But there are also little\r\nvegetable-growths in the sea which form carbonate-of-lime, and some of\r\nthese add their quota to the work of rearing Coral-reefs.\r\n\r\nWe have to do in the present chapter with small flint-building\r\nvegetable-growths. But there are also little animal jelly-specks in the\r\nsea which form flint.\r\n\r\nSo neither Carbonate-of-lime nor Flint can be spoken of as belonging\r\n_only_ to Animal or _only_ to Vegetable Life. They must both be\r\ndescribed in general terms as the outcome of that which Lives.\r\n\r\nAmong other Flint-builders in the ocean are the Radiolarians; living\r\njelly-specks, and makers of the most exquisite shells, so tiny in size\r\nthat millions of them may be packed into one cubic inch. These belong\r\nto the Animal Kingdom. They rank with the Foraminifera, differing from\r\nthem chiefly in the fact that their shells or skeletons are formed of\r\nsilica, not carbonate-of-lime.\r\n\r\nBut in this chapter we are concerned with the Vegetable Life of the\r\nocean, and we must therefore let the wonderful Radiolarians alone.\r\n\r\nProperly the chapter on Vegetables ought to have come before any\r\nchapter on Animals, since we have been climbing upward from inanimate\r\nNature, and since all vegetables rank below all animals. When on the\r\ntopic of Ocean-building, however, the subject of Chalk seemed to follow\r\nnaturally after that of Sandstone. And this little volume makes no\r\npretensions to stiff classification.\r\n\r\nNo surprise need be felt at vegetables being able to make or “secrete”\r\nflint and chalk. This making is, as we have seen, an unconscious work.\r\nThe living jelly-speck secretes automatically, not with intention.\r\n\r\nSuch secreting is not confined to ocean vegetables. Trees and plants\r\non land manufacture a host of substances--sweet oil, cocoa-nut milk,\r\nindiarubber, and countless others.[2] Forest trees in like manner grow\r\ntheir own framework of hard wood, which may be said to take the place\r\nwith them of a skeleton.\r\n\r\n[2] The spicules of silica may be seen on coarse grass, secreted by the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nAll this is a part of LIFE. Inanimate rocks and stones may lie for\r\ncenturies unchanged, except through friction with other rocks and\r\nstones, or with running water. But where Life reigns, though it be of\r\nthe simplest kind, there growth and development must follow.\r\n\r\nLife, from its very nature, cannot mean stagnation, or standing still.\r\nIt must always be assimilating. It must always be expanding. It must\r\nalways be doing. When these things cease, death has begun.\r\n\r\nSo much alike are the lower forms of life in the two classes, that\r\nmany an animal has been for a time mistakenly called a vegetable, and\r\nmany a vegetable has been for a while supposed to be an animal. The\r\nforaminifera were once ranked as vegetables, and the diatoms were\r\nranked as animals.\r\n\r\nIn deep-sea regions, dark and cold, no vegetable life can possibly\r\nexist, not even the almost ubiquitous diatoms. But their remains are\r\npresent in vast multitudes. As the tiny plant-life dies out, the little\r\nhard vegetable-cases sink to the ocean-bed, there to mingle with\r\ngathering muds and oozes--there, too, in the course of ages, to be\r\ntransformed into Flint.\r\n\r\nDiatoms flourish on land as well as in the ocean; in cold climates\r\nas well as in warm. On the whole they prefer the colder regions,\r\ntherein differing from the warmth-loving foraminifera. Sometimes\r\nimmense floating banks of these microscopic plants are found, reaching\r\nthrough many miles. A net, lowered into such a bank and then drawn up,\r\nis filled with a “brown-coloured slimy and felt-like mass,” made up\r\nchiefly of uncountable myriads of diatoms.\r\n\r\nSuch masses are held together by a kind of sticky jelly, and if the\r\nhand is passed through it a very slight roughness may be perceptible,\r\ncaused by the flinty diatom shells or cases.\r\n\r\nMere specks indeed they are, individually too minute to be seen by a\r\nhuman eye, unaided. Yet how marvellous in their make!\r\n\r\nA Diatom plant or vegetable or sea-weed, whichever we choose to call\r\nit, is like a Foraminifer of the simplest possible structure. It\r\nconsists of a single cell, with an outside flinty coating or inclosure,\r\nanswering to the wood of a tree or the skeleton of an animal.\r\n\r\nThis flint casing, though infinitely small and delicate, is yet firm\r\nenough to prevent the passage of water through it; and also it is\r\npractically indestructible by ordinary forces. Diatom-cases, dropping\r\nto the ocean-bed, may lie there for ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIATOM CASES (ARACHNOIDISCUS JAPONICUS)\r\n\r\n_Reproduced by permission of Messrs. R. and J.

When the living cell thus parts, each half takes as\r\nits share one side of the box, and each then makes another side, or\r\n“frustule,” to complete itself. For this operation, the tiny ring or\r\nhoop doubles into a pair of hoops, one of which clings to each half of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in all the world no greater marvels are to be seen than these\r\nextraordinary minute vegetable-cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PART OF DIATOM CASE (PLEUROSIGMA ANGULATUM)\r\n\r\nMagnified 4,900 diams.\r\n\r\n_From a photo-micrograph by Dr. R.

A mass of millions upon millions, held together, may be\r\nperceived and felt. But let a light scattering of them be dropped upon\r\na slip of glass in broad daylight, and let a man of keen eyesight set\r\nhimself to examine them. He will see--nothing! Not even an appearance\r\nof delicate dust. The diatoms are to him as if they did not exist.\r\n\r\nThen let him put that fine scattering under a good microscope, changing\r\nlens after lens, to higher powers. A world of beauty, of finish, of\r\noriginality, of unbounded variety in construction, will open out before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nEach little shell is exquisitely shaped, exquisitely put together,\r\nexquisitely ornamented. Though thousands, nay, millions, of them might\r\nbe packed into a cubic inch, yet there has been no carelessness, no\r\nscamping, in the work, no saying, “Nobody will see, so anything will\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of Diatoms are innumerable; and each kind, each\r\nspecies, even each variety, has its own especial form, its own complex\r\ndesign, followed out and faithfully reproduced in hundreds of millions\r\nof individuals.\r\n\r\nPattern-markings, by which each variety is distinguished, formed of an\r\ninfinitude of delicate lines and dots, arranged in every imaginable\r\nfashion, vary to an extent almost beyond conception. There are cases\r\nround, triangular, lengthy, many-sided, chain-like--but to picture them\r\nin words is hopeless. They have to be studied in their own wonderful\r\nminuteness and delicacy, complexity, and loveliness, before they can be\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nIn all this again we surely find unmistakable evidence of a MIND,\r\nhidden, out of sight, inventing and designing.\r\n\r\nNot the mind of the vegetable-speck, which for a brief space is\r\nsheltered in the ornate little flint-box, but of a Higher\r\nIntelligence--whether that of the Creator Himself directly, or whether,\r\nas may seem to some more probable, the mind of some intermediate\r\nWorker, Divinely appointed to the task.\r\n\r\nWhy should not Angelic or other beings, in the Unseen World, be allowed\r\nto exercise their powers in such wise, even as man upon Earth is\r\nallowed to think, to plan, to discover, to devise, to invent, according\r\nto his mental gifts?\r\n\r\nSome such possibility may well suggest itself to a thoughtful\r\nimagination, as the variety of developments in these tiny sea-shells\r\nor cases becomes apparent. All the more, because the developments are\r\nnot found scattered, haphazard, in single specimens, but--as above\r\nstated--are accurately followed out by the multitudes belonging to each\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nIt seems that every individual of every separate kind has power to form\r\ncertain shapes, with certain markings, and no more. It is as if upon\r\neach minute speck of vegetable life had been originally impressed its\r\nown--not _individual_ character, but _class_ character. This character\r\nunconsciously expresses itself in such and such a form of shell, just\r\nas with men the individual character expresses itself in such and such\r\noutlines of face. The same may be said of Foraminifera and Radiolarian\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nSome Diatoms have a singular power of movement; and from this sprang\r\nearly mistakes, through which they were wrongly classed as animals.\r\n\r\nMany of them grow, like ordinary plants, fixed in one spot. But\r\nmany others are in continuous and regular motion. Careful study\r\nhas, however, made it clear that the movements of Diatoms are\r\npurely mechanical, purely involuntary, like those of some sensitive\r\nland-plants. It is probably due to the working of food, taken into the\r\nlittle organism, and not obedient to any _Will_ on its part.\r\n\r\nIt may be that herein lies the great difference between a Diatom and\r\na Foraminifer. The one exists, but has no approach to consciousness;\r\nor, at least, probably no approach to any power of choice. The other,\r\nthough of the very lowest and feeblest type of Animal-life, may yet\r\nbe supposed in its infinitesimal measure to have a _wish_, and to be\r\nable to act upon that wish. But here we do not get beyond conjecture.\r\nWhere Life exists, it _may_ be that in all cases some dim form of\r\nconsciousness exists also, which _may_ involve some faint power of\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nFlint-making, like Chalk-making, is not only an old-world and long-past\r\noperation, but a present one. Diatoms lived and died in ages gone by,\r\nand their remains are found hardened into flint. Diatoms live and die\r\nin these days; and their remains may yet, in centuries to come, be\r\ntransformed into the same substance.\r\n\r\nFrom Diatoms one might range upward through an enormous variety of\r\nOcean-weeds, of all kinds and descriptions.\r\n\r\nThough they are the “last and lowest of all the tribes of plants,” yet\r\nit is a wide step from the undermost to the uppermost of even this\r\nhumble Vegetable Tribe.\r\n\r\nAt least five or six thousand species of Sea-weeds are known to\r\nNaturalists. Each ocean, each lesser sea, has its own particular\r\nvegetation, largely affected by the varying degrees of saltness, the\r\nwarmth or coldness of the water, and the faster or slower currents\r\nwhich happen there to prevail.\r\n\r\nSea-weeds of all sizes are found, from the invisible diatoms to\r\nenormous growths in Pacific waters, reaching to yards upon yards in\r\nlength, with solid trunk-like stems, and huge fronds like those of a\r\ntropical palm.\r\n\r\nNear Tierra del Fuego immense growths have been seen, with stems\r\nbetween three and four hundred feet in length. Great sub-ocean forests\r\nof kelp are there, and floating fucus-islands, with leaves or fronds\r\nseven or eight feet from base to tip, covered with living animals, and\r\nhaving air-vessels several inches long.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of colour no great variety exists. Sea-weeds are\r\ngenerally either grass-green, olive-brown, or red. The green are\r\nusually close to land, and they never grow beyond touch with direct\r\nsunlight. The olive-brown are the more abundant; and the red belong,\r\nperhaps, more often to deep water.\r\n\r\nA large majority grow attached either to stones or to the shallow\r\nsea-bottom, but some kinds float unattached. To this last class belong\r\nthe masses of weed in the Sargasso Sea--the centre of the North\r\nAtlantic currents.\r\n\r\nRound that huge collection of weeds and drift, which reaches over\r\nsomething like two hundred and sixty thousand square miles, the\r\nentire North Atlantic slowly revolves. And of these weeds--called\r\n“Sargassum”--none are attached to rock or ground, but all float\r\nloosely in mid-ocean. They seem to flourish thus, though the fact that\r\nfructification is not found upon them points to a somewhat unusual\r\ncondition of things.\r\n\r\nSea-weeds more often multiply by means of spores, which is a form of\r\nvegetable-growth inferior to that of seeds. All spore-growing plants,\r\nwhether on land or in the sea, take a lower rank than seed-growing\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nA still lower and humbler method has been earlier described--that of\r\nsimply dividing into half.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another way by which ocean-weeds increase, and it reminds\r\none curiously of the gardener’s plan of growth by cuttings.\r\n\r\nIn rough weather, on shallow reaches not far from land, the waves tear\r\nquantities of sea-weed fronds from their moorings, and carry them to\r\nshore or to rocky parts, where they become entangled, and are held fast.\r\n\r\nThere, if later waves do not again dislodge them, and if other\r\ncircumstances are favourable, the wandering fronds settle down, attach\r\nthemselves, and become fresh plants. So in this case the waves act as\r\ngardeners, and make cuttings of ocean-plants.\r\n\r\nWhile plant-life in the ocean is plentiful in amount and abundant in\r\nvariety, it is confined within limits. By far the greater part of\r\nSea-weed existence is contained in the Hundred-fathom limit--that is,\r\nwithin six hundred feet of the surface. Not many kinds, indeed, can\r\ngrow in anything like as much depth as five or six hundred feet.\r\n\r\nSea-weeds in abundance are found on shallow shores, near continents and\r\nislands; on the zone between high and low tides; and on gently-shelving\r\nslopes beyond that zone. Floating unattached sea-weeds, of the type\r\nwhich belongs to the Sargasso Sea, may be anywhere, over the deepest\r\ndepths of the ocean. These, however, are not found living and growing\r\nvery far beneath the surface: and Ocean’s depths are without any kind\r\nof vegetable-life, except probably bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  CORAL ARCHITECTS\r\n\r\n “Who layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters.”--Ps. civ. 3.\r\n\r\n “And surges roaring from below.”--DIBDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoral is a familiar enough object with us all, whether in the shape\r\nof a child’s first plaything, or a girl’s first trinket, or a Museum\r\ncuriosity. It may be red or pink or white; it may be polished into\r\nsmoothness or left in its natural state of jagged roughness, dotted\r\nover with tiny pits. In any case, it is a thing of interest and beauty.\r\nIn any case, it is the dead skeleton of a once-living animal.\r\n\r\nIn the Red Sea alone about one hundred and twenty kinds of Coral are\r\nfound, and in Ocean waters the numbers rise rapidly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the species best known to us is the small red coral\r\nof the Mediterranean, usually gathered from shallow parts, though\r\nsometimes fished up from a thousand feet deep.\r\n\r\nThis kind seldom exceeds ten or twelve inches in length; and when\r\nalive, the pretty branching skeleton is clothed in a thin tinted\r\njelly-like vesture, which, though in a sense one, is yet no “single\r\nindividual.” It is formed of many polyps, all united together, while\r\neach has its own separate mouth, and each holds out its own tiny\r\nfeelers for food. Once let the branch be taken from the water, and\r\nonly one result can follow. Life quickly fades; the enfolding vesture\r\ndisappears; and a bare red skeleton is left for use in the market, to\r\nbe made into toy or ornament.\r\n\r\nThe word Coral has other associations. It carries our thoughts far from\r\nhome to fair isles in tropical seas--isles connected in our memories\r\nwith tales of shipwrecked mariners and hair-breadth escapes, of dashing\r\nwaves and peaceful lagoons, of breadfruit trees and waving palms, of\r\nperpetual sunshine and endless holidays, of Robinson Crusoe adventures\r\nand interesting islanders, of poisoned arrows and ferocious sharks.\r\n\r\nSuch islands do exist, and in numbers far greater than we commonly\r\nrealise.\r\n\r\nAt this moment I have before me a map of the world, made for the\r\nexpress purpose of showing “Coral Seas,” or the regions where Coral\r\nislands are constructed. And the red patches are astonishingly\r\nplentiful, dotting a broad belt of ocean all round the world, except\r\nwhere that belt is interrupted by Continents, within the limits,\r\nroughly, of 30° north latitude and 30° south latitude.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies coral islands abound. Travelling westward from\r\nAmerica we come across the same material, in extensive regions to the\r\nnorth-east, the north, and the north-west of Australia. Tahiti, Samoa,\r\nthe Fijis, the Solomons, the New Hebrides, the Carolines, the Marshall\r\nIslands, the Seychelles, and innumerable others, are literally made of\r\ncoral.\r\n\r\nNot made as sandstone and chalk are made, put together by the slow\r\naction of the sea, far below the surface. This is another kind of\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nCoral is built by living creatures, near the surface of the water.\r\nAll that the waves have to do is, firstly, to bring abundance of\r\nfood to the polyps, when alive, since by reason of their ponderous\r\nrock-skeletons they cannot go in search of food; and secondly, after\r\nthe death of the polyps, to break and grind and heap together the\r\nskeleton-remains.\r\n\r\nWe have seen something of ocean “stone-makers,” in the story of Chalk.\r\nHere we have the same thing again. As the tiny shells, which go to the\r\nbuilding of chalk, are the dead remains of once-living jelly-specks,\r\nso these great masses of coral, forming islands and reefs in southern\r\nseas, are largely the skeletons of once-living polyps.\r\n\r\nA coral-polyp, like a jelly-speck, has power to take lime from\r\nsea-water. It has power to secrete carbonate-of-lime. It has power to\r\ndeposit that carbonate-of-lime in solid masses.\r\n\r\nBut whereas the jelly-speck lives inside its shell, putting out tiny\r\ntemporary limbs through holes for food, the coral-polyp more often\r\nlives outside its skeleton, clothing the dry bones with translucent\r\njelly. This is rather more after the fashion in which man clothes his\r\nskeleton. Yet because of its make the coral-polyp cannot properly, in\r\nthe full sense of the word, “secrete” or hide its internal framework.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly fair to speak of “the polyp” and of “it” in this\r\nconnection. “Polyps” and “they” are more correct.\r\n\r\nFor the coral-polyps live in close communities, in very near\r\nfellowship, acting on co-operative principles of the most advanced\r\nkind. Each individual may, it is true, have its own mouth, its own\r\ntentacles, and even its own small stomach. But the latter at least can\r\nhardly be reckoned as personal property, since all are so connected\r\nthat liquids pass freely from one to another, and the food which is\r\ntaken in by one polyp helps to nourish its neighbours.\r\n\r\nAnd again, while we speak of coral as being “built,” that really is not\r\nthe right word; unless we may also talk of the “building” of a man’s\r\nskeleton, or of an elephant’s framework.\r\n\r\n“Built” undeniably it is; but the building implies no conscious effort,\r\nno deliberate intention, no praiseworthy exertions, on the part of the\r\nbuilder. Coral is simply “secreted”--is unknowingly and without choice\r\nput together by the polyps.\r\n\r\nThere _is_ invention; there _is_ plan; there _is_ design. But these\r\nbelong to a Mind, above and beyond and out of sight; not in anywise to\r\nthe live jelly which clothes the coral-skeleton, or to the extremely\r\nlimited understanding of that co-operative jelly-sheet.\r\n\r\nNot all polyps have stony skeletons. On our sea-shores we have species\r\nmany, and individuals by tens of thousands, which secrete no coral.\r\nThey are known to us as Sea-Anemones: and the first-cousins of these\r\ndainty flower-like beings, inhabiting British salt-pools, construct\r\nmiles and miles of coral far off in southern seas.\r\n\r\nSome few even among coral-polyps live individual lives, but the greater\r\nnumber follow the community-system. This must always be looked upon as\r\nan inferior way of existence.\r\n\r\nThe most usual way in which polyps increase is by “budding”--not unlike\r\nthe growth of a plant by buds. A small lump appears on one side of the\r\nparent, which increases fast in size, develops a mouth and tentacles,\r\nand by-and-by gives birth itself to other buds. The increase of numbers\r\nis enormous. One polyp may produce in a short time thousands or even\r\ntens of thousands of descendants.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of coral-polyps the children do not leave the parents\r\nor go out into the world. They cling to the old stock; they partake of\r\nthe united family-life; and each little mouth and stomach works for the\r\nbenefit of all the little stomachs of the whole community.\r\n\r\nSome polyps, instead of budding like a plant, increase by division.\r\nOne polyp separates into two parts, each of which becomes a full-grown\r\nanimal; and each then divides anew; this plan continuing _ad\r\ninfinitum_. Here again the growth of numbers is not slow.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, in place of spreading in branch-like shapes, they grow\r\nin solid rounded masses. Such a sphere-like mass in tropical waters of\r\nthe Pacific may be twenty feet in diameter--one huge family of united\r\nbeings, each perhaps under a twentieth of an inch across, and all\r\ntogether clothing a skeleton common to the entire clan.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the tips of the branches or the outer edges of the\r\nrounded mass are the _young_ polyps, while the older ones lie lower\r\ndown or more inward.\r\n\r\nAs the tree or ball of coral grows, spreading farther, giving birth\r\nto fresh generations of polyps, the old ones die off. So the living\r\nand the dead are found in one community, in close touch, on a single\r\nbranch or a single mound of coral. At the tip of each twig may be\r\nthe brightly-coloured active jelly, while the stem below is a dead\r\nskeleton. On a solid mass of coral, twenty feet in diameter, the whole\r\noutside may be alive, down perhaps to a depth of half-an-inch, while\r\nthe whole inside is lifeless bone. That is how the coral grows.\r\n\r\nLiving coral is seldom found at any greater depth in the sea than\r\nabout twenty fathoms, and the limits of temperature which the polyps\r\ncan endure are narrow. Their growth is quickly checked by water a\r\nlittle too deep or a little too cold, and by water not very pure.\r\nAbundance of lime also is needful.\r\n\r\nAn “atoll” is a coral-reef standing alone, generally of a round or oval\r\nshape, with a lake of calm sea-water in its centre, while ocean-billows\r\nthunder on the outer margin. The polyps love those waves; but they fade\r\nand die in the inclosed lagoon, where the water is not often enough\r\nrenewed to supply them with food.\r\n\r\nMuch the same in make are the Fringing Reefs and Barrier Reefs, except\r\nthat the former skirt the shore more closely, while the latter may lie\r\nat a distance of many miles from island or mainland.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the polyps to raise their stony structure above\r\nthe sea. Some kinds can endure exposure to the air for a short time\r\nwithout dying, but only for a short time. A coral island, when first\r\nbuilt, is merely level with the ocean-surface at low tide.\r\n\r\nBut old Ocean carries on the work which the polyps have begun. Heavy\r\nrollers break incessantly against the reef, loosening blocks of coral,\r\nsome of which are flung bodily upon it, while others are pounded into\r\nsand, which fills up holes and crevices. Gradually thus the whole\r\nbecomes cemented into hard reef-rock.\r\n\r\nAs this goes on the low island slowly rises, until it has climbed above\r\nhigh-tide level.\r\n\r\nThen the task can only be completed by waves of exceptional reach.\r\nStill the grinding of coral to fine sand goes on; and in time it gains\r\na depth of some inches. And the waves carry seeds and cocoa-nuts to the\r\nspot; and shrubs and trees spring up, to sow again their own seeds,\r\nand by gradual decay to form mould. Thus it comes about that a little\r\nisland is made ready for man to live on.\r\n\r\nOne might expect these stages to be very slow indeed, but such events\r\nmarch at the double in tropical climates. In the Low Archipelago one\r\natoll was found, in the space of only thirty-four years, to have been\r\ntransformed from a mere rock-reef to a lagoon island, fourteen miles in\r\nlength, with tall trees growing along almost the whole of one side.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of the sizes to which coral-buildings reach, the Maldive\r\nArchipelago may be named. It is a vast collection of islands and reefs,\r\nstretching to a length of four hundred and seventy miles, and in parts\r\nfifty miles broad. Barrier-reefs, reaching through many hundreds of\r\nmiles, are even more remarkable.\r\n\r\nTravellers write stirring descriptions of the beauty of these\r\nerections. The vivid pen of Miss Gordon-Cumming, for instance, has\r\npainted many a picture of Pacific reefs, of thundering breakers, and\r\ndazzling white surf.\r\n\r\nWe are told by her of “the patches of coral, sea-weed, and sometimes\r\nwhite sand, lying at irregular depths beneath a shallow covering of\r\nthe most crystalline emerald-green water,” producing “every shade of\r\naqua-marine, mauve, sienna, and orange, all marvellously blended.”\r\nAnd, again, of the wonderful masses of living coral which grow like\r\ngarden-plants below the clear water, and of branching shrubs of all\r\nimaginable tints, such as pink, blue, mauve, and primrose.\r\n\r\nTo pluck and carry off these ocean-blossoms would be a vain attempt,\r\nfor the “gelatinous slime” to which the colours belong “drips away, as\r\nthe living creatures melt and die, when exposed to the upper air.”\r\n\r\nFrom the pen of another eye-witness[3] we have a description of a visit\r\nat low-tide to the barrier-reef of Levuka, the old Fiji capital. We\r\nlearn that the reef itself consists mainly of dead coral--“rough,\r\nuninteresting, shapeless limestones, with a very small covering of\r\nseaweed.” But after about a quarter of a mile of difficult walking,\r\nthe travellers drew near to the “roaring surf on the outside,” where\r\n“fingery lumps of beautiful live coral began to appear, of the palest\r\nlavender-blue colour.” By the time that they were nearly within touch\r\nof the spray, “the whole floor was one mass of living branches of\r\ncoral.”\r\n\r\n[3] The Hon. Ralph Abercromby.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until they ventured actually into the water,\r\nbeyond the outer verge of the “great sea-wall,” that they could see for\r\nthemselves the true nature of the reef.\r\n\r\nThis was the description given. “You look down, and see a steep\r\nirregular wall, extending deeper into the ocean than the eye can\r\nfollow, and broken into lovely grottoes and holes and canals, through\r\nwhich small resplendent fishes of the brightest blue or gold flit\r\nfitfully between the lumps of coral. The sides of the natural grottoes\r\nare entirely covered with endless forms of tender-coloured coral,\r\nbut all beautiful, and all more or less of the fingery or branching\r\nspecies, known as madrepores. It is really impossible to draw or\r\ndescribe the sight.”\r\n\r\nEqually impossible was it to photograph these fairy grottoes, “seen\r\nthrough twenty feet of surging water,” though some snapshots were taken\r\nin moments when the vast billows withdrew themselves.\r\n\r\nOne difficult question in connection with coral reefs has been--How can\r\nthey rise, as they do, out of considerable depths, when coral-polyps\r\ncannot live below some twenty fathoms from the surface?\r\n\r\nTwo chief explanations have been offered, each of which has been warmly\r\ntaken up and defended.\r\n\r\nOne meets the difficulty by means of the theory of a rising and sinking\r\nearth-crust. A mountain-top might have been first heaved up to within\r\ntwenty fathoms of the surface. Then later, while the polyps were\r\nbuilding upon it, the mountain might have slowly sunk. In that case the\r\npolyps below would die, as the water deepened; but the wall of dead\r\ncoral would remain, reaching in time very far down.\r\n\r\nThe other explanation also admits that coral-reefs have been generally\r\nbuilt upon sub-ocean heights. But it supposes that height to have been\r\npartly raised by volcanic forces, and afterwards built up to the needed\r\nheight by a growing collection of oozes and animal-remains, deposited\r\nthrough ages.\r\n\r\nMany proofs have been found in recent years of the probable truth of\r\nthe latter theory. Still, it does not of necessity do away with the\r\nearlier explanation. Here, once more, the question may be asked--Why\r\nshould not both be true? If some submarine peaks have been lifted to\r\njust the right level by gradual building up of sediment, others may\r\nhave been so raised by volcanic action or crust-crinkling.\r\n\r\nEither way, it is a marvellous tale.\r\n\r\nThousands of miles of solid reef-rocks; hundreds of substantial\r\ninhabited islands, all reared, inch after inch, by a mere “gelatinous\r\nslime,” by soft-bodied jelly-like creatures, first cousins to the dull\r\nthough pretty anemone of our shores!\r\n\r\nThe thing sounds incredible! A stranger from some far-off world--a\r\nstranger even from polar regions on our Earth, unlearned in the lore of\r\nwarmer oceans--might scout the story as absurd.\r\n\r\nYet no fact in Natural History is better attested, or stands on a\r\nfirmer foundation. There is a good deal more in the philosophy of this\r\nsmall world than appears at first sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  OVER THE OCEAN-BED\r\n\r\n  “The wrecks dissolve above us: their dust drops down from afar;--\r\n  Down to the dark, the utter dark, where the blind white\r\n      sea-snakes are.\r\n  There is no sound, no echo of sound, in the deserts of the deep,\r\n  O’er the great grey level plains of ooze, where the shell-burred\r\n      cables creep.”--RUDYARD KIPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy way of variety, shall we take a little excursion together, you and\r\nI, into those under-sea regions of which so much has been said in past\r\nchapters? Regions which the foot of man has never trod; which the eye\r\nof man has never seen; which, except in death, the hand of man has\r\nnever touched.\r\n\r\nShall we leave behind the fair Earth that we love, the sunshine, the\r\nbright sky, the fields and hedgerows, the blue sparkles of Ocean’s\r\nsurface, and go down and down, through a waste of lonely waters, till\r\nour feet rest upon firm ground below?\r\n\r\n“Eh, but it’s eerie!” we might say, were we of Scots descent. Sunlight\r\nis at once lost sight of, and twilight deepens fast.\r\n\r\nA heavy cyclone may be raging above, but the troublous turmoil soon\r\nceases to affect us. Stormy billows, with their showers of spray,\r\ncannot disturb the calm of these depths. As we sink lower, we find\r\nourselves enwrapped in stillness. A creeping current is around us, yet\r\nwith movement so gentle that we are not aware of it.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of our descent we come across innumerable\r\nsea-weeds; delicate floating red fronds, and long brown ribbons tangled\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nPresently we pass through a sticky slimy mass of Diatoms, reaching far\r\nto right and left, and of great depth. Untold millions of those tiny\r\nvegetables are living and growing together, in one enormous floating\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nNow we have reached the “hundred-fathom limit,” and as we go beyond it,\r\nwe find marked changes from the life we have known above.\r\n\r\nNo seasons here. No variations from summer to winter, from spring to\r\nautumn. Only one dead level of perpetual chill, becoming colder and\r\ncolder.\r\n\r\nNo light here. No variations from night to day, from evening to\r\nmorning. Nothing but continuous midnight blackness, unrelieved by the\r\nfaintest gleam of sunshine.\r\n\r\nNo plant-life here. No ocean-weeds of any kind. Those things we have\r\nleft behind us, far above.\r\n\r\nDead sea-weed fronds are indeed abundant, sinking slowly downward,\r\nin company with ourselves; and dead Diatoms, with dead microscopic\r\ncreatures of many kinds, rain incessantly from the surface waters to\r\nthe ocean’s bed. But they are far too minute for us to feel them, as\r\nthey slip noiselessly past. _Seeing_ anything, small or large, is out\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\nNo light; no waves; no colour; no beauty. Only unbroken stretches of\r\nsilent water, with intense and penetrating cold.\r\n\r\nA mile or more below we find ourselves on firm ground. This is the\r\ntopmost peak of a sub-ocean mountain range, rising from the bottom\r\nof the sea. In the darkness we grope our way to the verge, then\r\nslowly walk down its sloping side, under a ponderous weight of water,\r\nwhile our feet are upon a sticky unpleasant ooze, which seems to be\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nOnly not quite everywhere. The nature of the ocean-floor varies.\r\n\r\nHere, for instance, we come to a patch of hard ground, reaching some\r\nlittle way. But the sticky ooze mainly prevails, varied by less sticky\r\nmud. And neither ooze nor mud is always of the same description, as\r\nwe should discover if we walked far and examined specimens from each\r\ndistrict. There are muds and muds--oozes and oozes.\r\n\r\nCrabs in abundance scuttle over the ground, as we may know by feeling,\r\nif we have left our boots behind. And slimy creatures of various kinds\r\nflourish, none of them precisely the same as those which inhabit our\r\nsea-beaches in regions of light, yet their near relatives. Stooping\r\ndown, we touch a rough-coated hedgehog; and then our fingers come into\r\ncontact with a mass of slimy tentacles, which sting sharply.\r\n\r\nOne would like to be able to see, as well as to feel. But into these\r\ndepths no gleam of sunlight may ever penetrate.\r\n\r\nYet, as we stroll onward, plodding through the thick plastic ooze, in\r\nthe pitchy darkness we become aware of a light, a hazy light, drawing\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nOne does not expect to find a lantern down here in the deep\r\nocean-waters. It positively seems to be a lantern, moving as if it had\r\na will of its own. And about the small living lantern, during its\r\napproach, we see many creatures congregated, swimming and whisking\r\nround, evidently making use of the glimmer to catch their prey.\r\n\r\nWhen it has come close, we find the light to proceed from a soft-bodied\r\njelly-like animal, which, as it travels, carries its own illumination\r\nwith it. Had we in upper regions such power to shine for ourselves, we\r\nshould be delightfully independent of artificial light after dark.\r\n\r\nAt first our impression is that the sub-ocean lamp must be a very\r\nuncommon phenomenon. But as we go on we encounter another and\r\nanother--different indeed in species, yet alike in the possession of\r\nnatural light-giving organs.\r\n\r\nIt dawns upon our minds gradually that, even in ocean-depths, the law\r\nof compensation is not unrepresented. Even those dark regions, cut\r\noff though they are from all rays of sunlight, do not lie under total\r\nmidnight blackness unrelieved. Even here, in these desolate nethermost\r\nparts of the ocean, creatures with eyes may live, and may find a good\r\nuse for those eyes.\r\n\r\nFor glimmer after glimmer is seen; and jelly-like animals under our\r\nfeet, when accidentally touched, give forth rays, sometimes rays of\r\nmany colours; and fishes, as they flash past, lend occasional gleams;\r\nand larger uncouth monsters do the same--all helping to light up a\r\nworld beyond reach of the sun.\r\n\r\nTalk of depths! We are in them at last, and no mistake. Down--down!\r\nDeeper and deeper! Above our heads are piled three or four miles of\r\nwater, and the pressure upon our unfortunate bodies is terrific.\r\n\r\nHere creatures of simplest form abound,--Protozoa, or First Animals,\r\ntiny jelly-like specks, mere living cells, too small by far for us to\r\nsee, even with the help of animated deep-sea lanterns, unless we have\r\ncarried with us a powerful microscope. But we know them to be there.\r\nThe ooze and mud alone, when carefully examined, prove the fact.\r\n\r\nHere are foraminifera, living and dead; and skeletons of reef-coral,\r\nall dead; and specimens of deep-sea coral, both living and dead;\r\nand remains of bigger creatures innumerable, which have disported\r\nthemselves in the waters above. Yet not so many of these last as one\r\nmight have expected, because of the destructive power of sea-water.\r\n\r\nThere are also plant-like zoophytes, and disc-shaped jelly-fishes.\r\nThere are sea-urchins and starfishes. There are sponges in great\r\nnumbers, wandering young ones and old ones settled down for life, once\r\nlooked upon as vegetables, now known to be animals. There are molluscs\r\nof various kinds. There are long slimy wriggling worms. There are the\r\ninevitable crabs, large and small. There are countless fishes swimming\r\nabout, not in the least embarrassed by the astounding fact that they\r\nhave something like three and a half miles of water between them and\r\nfresh air and sunlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEEP-SEA FISHES\r\n\r\n  _Face page 182_\r\n]\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly we come upon a great ship, lying where it has lately sunk.\r\n\r\nThe busy sea, always busy even when most quiet, is hard at work\r\ndemolishing the structure of the vessel; though still in the darkness\r\nwe can feel the tall mast, the solid sides, of the noble craft, which\r\nonce floated buoyantly far above, in light of day. Now it reposes on\r\nthe ocean-bed, never again to be of service to man. Its race is run;\r\nits tale is told. Alas! good ship! which, but for one fatal storm,\r\nmight still be actively engaged in its country’s service.\r\n\r\nBut we find no human remains. If they be there, our searching has\r\nfailed to alight on them.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder, in the great space and the blackness. A medusa gleam of\r\nlight has little power to aid us in this search.\r\n\r\nPerhaps slow currents have carried elsewhere the bodies of men who went\r\ndown with the ship. Or perhaps the bones have succumbed already to\r\nthe destructive working of ocean-waters. Or perhaps all on board were\r\nsaved, when the gallant vessel sank. Let us hope that it was so.\r\n\r\nWe are leaving the sticky ooze and getting into a region of stiff\r\nclay. If there were light enough, we should find it to be of a reddish\r\ntint. Here we do find bones--remains of creatures of a higher class,\r\nthough not of man, the highest of all. Here are sharks’ teeth in great\r\nabundance, and many earbones of whales. Not much, after all, but\r\nsomething that tells of Life.\r\n\r\nAnother lofty mountain height under water, rising from the ocean-bed.\r\nShall we climb it, and see whither it may lead us? Have we not had\r\nenough of these black mysterious depths?\r\n\r\nNow up and up, cautiously feeling our way and using any such glimmers\r\nof living light as we come across. By-and-by we find ourselves getting\r\ninto shallower water. Evidently this sub-ocean mountain approaches near\r\nto the surface. It will not end, like the last, a mile or more beneath.\r\n\r\nHere is a region of solid limestone rocks, made of reef-coral, which\r\nhas been ground and pounded by the waves, and afterwards cemented\r\nfirmly together. We are getting into levels where the waves have power.\r\n\r\nPresently the firm limestone is exchanged for coral mud, and later that\r\ngives place to reef-sand. By this time we have around us, not only\r\nliving animals but living sea-weeds, which fact tells of our nearness\r\nto sunlight. It may still seem dark to us, but some light must be able\r\nto filter through, or plant-life could not exist.\r\n\r\nA few more fathoms of ascent, and we too are aware of light--dim and\r\nfaint at first, yet steadily increasing.\r\n\r\nShall we step out into the fresh air, the radiant sunshine, of a\r\nSouth-Sea coral island--into a world of light and life and beauty,\r\nall the fairer and the sweeter in its contrast with those gloomy\r\nunder-ocean regions through which we have been wandering?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  MULTITUDINOUS LIFE\r\n\r\n “This great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable,\r\n both small and great beasts.”--Ps. civ. 25.\r\n\r\n                “The dense immensity\r\n  Of ever-stirring Life, in thy strange forms\r\n  Of fish and shell and worm and oozy mud.”--KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome thirty or forty years ago the knowledge which man had of the\r\n“Great Deep” was practically _nil_.\r\n\r\nWe know a good deal more now, thanks to the famous voyage of the\r\n_Challenger_, and to many other observations, though still the full sum\r\nof our information is small compared with the much that we do not know.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1872 the good ship _Challenger_ quitted British shores for\r\nher long tour of discovery. During nearly three years and a half she\r\ncruised about the world, dipping her instruments into the water at\r\nfrequent intervals, measuring the depths, studying the temperatures,\r\nmaking note of other conditions, and bringing up from the ocean-bed\r\nmaterials whereby to judge of the state of that dark nether-world,\r\nhidden from our eyes by intervening miles of water.\r\n\r\nThree and a half years of steady work; hundreds upon hundreds of\r\nsoundings; thousands upon thousands of miles traversed; tens of\r\nthousands of specimens hauled up; days and weeks and months devoted to\r\nunremitting study of those specimens! This is what the _Challenger_\r\nExpedition meant. No wonder our knowledge of the Under-Ocean has grown\r\nby leaps.\r\n\r\nAnd yet no wonder it is still confined within narrow limits. So\r\nenormous is the extent of the Ocean,--so few comparatively are the\r\nparts which have been under close examination!\r\n\r\nImagine a monster giant striding with vast steps over the sea, and at\r\nintervals of a mile or two dipping a long arm into the depth, to bring\r\naway a handful of whatever might lie upon the bed below. No doubt he\r\nmight and would thus learn a good deal that he had not known before.\r\nStill, at the best, tens of thousands of square miles would lie around\r\nin all directions, untouched by his searching fingers.\r\n\r\nThis is very much what the Expedition was able to do. A handful here\r\nand a handful there was brought up, as a specimen of what might be\r\nfound below. But tens of thousands of square miles, to north and south\r\nand east and west, remained untouched.\r\n\r\nNone the less, from these occasional “dips,” however few by comparison\r\nwith reaches not examined, we know far more than our forefathers could\r\nhave dreamt of as within the bounds of possibility.\r\n\r\nInstruments, many and complicated, are used in deep-sea researches--far\r\ntoo many and too complicated to be described here. Two or three may be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nSounding-machines proper are largely employed, sometimes carrying\r\nwater-bottles, and always brass tubes, weighed down by “sinkers,” which\r\nremain behind when the tubes are drawn up full of mud or ooze.\r\n\r\nSmall dredges are dragged along the sea-bottom, gathering whatever may\r\nlie there loosely, and bringing it to the surface.\r\n\r\nTrawls also are necessary, with beams from ten to seventeen feet in\r\nlength. Such trawls, held by strong steel cables thousands of fathoms\r\nlong, can often lift seven tons of material.\r\n\r\nInto the bottom of a dredge-bag and of a trawl-net fine cloth is\r\nfrequently sewn, so that mud and small animals may not slip through and\r\nbe lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAGGING THE TOW-NET TO CATCH MINUTE SURFACE ANIMALS\r\n\r\nNote sailors with small nets]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAM-TRAWL AND TOW-NET EMPLOYED IN DEEP-SEA RESEARCH\r\n\r\n  _Face page 188_\r\n]\r\n\r\nImmense supplies have been thus dredged and hauled up from the\r\nbottom of the sea. Muds and oozes, sands and pebbles, stones and\r\nrocks, shelly deposits, volcanic deposits, remains innumerable of\r\ndead plants, remains still more abundant of animals, including\r\nearbones of whales and teeth of sharks, and more rarely other parts\r\nof animal-skeletons--large, small, microscopic, these all have been,\r\nwith infinite care, with infinite patience, sorted and examined and\r\nclassified.\r\n\r\nTeeth and earbones! But where are the great shark-skeletons? Where are\r\nthe mighty bone frameworks of whales?\r\n\r\nIf a whale’s earbones lie here, surely here also must have sunk\r\nthe enormous carcase. Yet all the rest has vanished. All has been\r\ndissolved--disintegrated--eaten up, as it were, by the black and silent\r\nwaste of water. Sea-water has an extraordinary dissolving power, much\r\nintensified by added pressure at great depths, and few substances can\r\nlong withstand that power. Not even the massive skeletons of sharks\r\nand whales, with the exception of the teeth and earbones, which are\r\nformed of peculiarly hard material.\r\n\r\nAnd never once, throughout the whole cruise, was any single bone of Man\r\nbrought up from the ocean-bed.\r\n\r\nAfter all is this surprising? Where even whale-skeletons are mastered,\r\nsmall chance can remain for a human skeleton to stand out long against\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\nThe marvel is how tiny foraminifer shells can last as they do. The\r\nmajority no doubt disappear. Unless they reach the bottom quickly, and\r\nare there covered up and protected, they must soon be dissolved.\r\n\r\nYet that vast numbers do thus escape we know by the masses of ooze\r\nfound over the sea-bottom; by the fifty millions or more of square\r\nmiles of the ocean-floor carpeted with coral muds and sands, and with\r\noozes of foraminifera and kindred shells.\r\n\r\nOnly down to a depth of about two miles. Beyond that, carbonate-of-lime\r\nshells are seldom found. It is believed that these light shells take\r\nas much as three or four days to sink one mile; and in about two miles\r\nthey all succumb to the power of sea-water. But the hard little diatom\r\ncases are present in all depths, more especially in Earth’s colder\r\nregions, where they abound most freely.\r\n\r\nThe ocean-bed has been described as one huge sepulchre, full of the\r\nremains of once-living creatures. And this is true; yet by itself it\r\ngives a very one-sided view. Not less is the ocean-bed to be described\r\nas a world of abounding Life.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, throughout the whole sea, in all parts, above and below\r\nand between--near the surface, on the floor, in all intermediate\r\nreaches--living creatures flourish in numbers past imagination.\r\n\r\nNot everywhere equally. Here may be found a wonderful richness of\r\nanimal-life. There the explorer may alight on a barren region. Yet even\r\nthose parts more scantily supplied need not be always thus. Living\r\ncreatures in vast hordes, in enormous companies, drift to and fro, rise\r\nupwards and sink downwards; and the district which to-day seems almost\r\ndevoid of life may to-morrow be thronged with active beings.\r\n\r\nThe Ocean’s inhabitants have been roughly divided into three Classes--\r\nDeep-Sea Life, Intermediate Ocean Life, and Surface Ocean Life.\r\n\r\nThe first of these includes all animals which crawl upon the sea-bed,\r\nor which live within about three hundred fathoms of it.\r\n\r\nThe second includes all animals which live between about three\r\nhundred fathoms of the sea-bottom and three hundred fathoms of the\r\nocean-surface.\r\n\r\nThe third includes all animals which live within three hundred fathoms\r\nof the surface, and those on shallow shores.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of living creatures appear to inhabit the\r\nsurface regions; and it may be that the next in number are those on and\r\nnear the ocean-bed. This, however, is uncertain. It is difficult to\r\njudge about the intermediate depths. All creatures living there must be\r\nextremely good swimmers, and they are very shy of nets.\r\n\r\nWe cannot readily picture to ourselves the manner of life which goes\r\non in those intermediate parts. Creatures there have, as it seems,\r\nno connection with either the ocean-bed or with shallow shores--no\r\nresting-place to which they may turn--in short, no home. Though one may\r\nnot realise the fact, few animals within our ken have not something in\r\nthe shape of a home, a _pied à terre_, to use a familiar term, though\r\nthat “terre” may be under water.\r\n\r\nThe very idea of a life spent always in swimming or floating through\r\nboundless depths, never touching firm ground, having no kind of home or\r\nretreat, suggests vagabondage, and sounds disconsolate.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the difficulty is at least partly met by those great\r\nfloating banks of living creatures which are often found.\r\n\r\nDiatom-Banks have been already spoken of. But other animals of larger\r\ngrowth also band together, forming vast companies. To each individual\r\nin such a congeries the Floating Bank would be a home. It would matter\r\nlittle to that individual whether the bank as a whole floated here or\r\ndrifted there, whether it rose at night to the surface of the sea, or\r\nwhether in daytime it sank lower to escape from the sun’s glare.\r\n\r\nMany such banks of life belong strictly to the Surface Class rather\r\nthan to the Intermediate. But the want of a home applies equally to all\r\ncreatures who live a free and roving life in the Ocean, unattached to\r\nshore or to sea-bed, whether they live above or below the three-hundred\r\nfathom limit.\r\n\r\nAnother puzzling question has been as to how deep-sea creatures are\r\nfed.\r\n\r\nIn Life on _terra firma_, generally, the work of plants is to make\r\nready food for animals. Many substances, which are needful for\r\nanimal-structure, cannot be taken in by them until broken up and\r\nre-made by plants. And plants can only carry out this task in sunlight.\r\nWhere the light of the sun fails, there plant-life fails also.\r\n\r\nBut direct vegetable food is not always necessary. Arctic\r\nanimals--bears, seals, walruses,--cannot get it except at second\r\nor third hand, through the bodies of other animals. Perhaps this\r\nwas forgotten by some who maintained that no animals could, by any\r\npossibility, flourish in ocean’s greater depths.\r\n\r\nNumberless observations have now thrust that theory on one side. By\r\nthe dredgings and trawlings of the _Challenger_, not to speak of later\r\nexplorations, it has been conclusively proved that, even down to great\r\ndepths, animal life is marvellously plentiful.\r\n\r\nTwo or three examples may be given. A single haul, made in water more\r\nthan a mile deep, brought up animals of two hundred different kinds.\r\nAnother haul, in a depth of two miles, had the same result. Another, in\r\na depth of three miles, brought up fifty different kinds. All these it\r\nwas known, by tokens learnt from close study and much experience, had\r\ncertainly lived near the bottom. Again, from depths of four miles many\r\ncreatures, including fishes, appeared. Even in a depth of over five\r\nmiles, signs of life were not lacking.\r\n\r\nWho, after this, may venture to name a depth at which Life is\r\naltogether impossible?\r\n\r\nAlthough plants cannot live and grow in the darkness of nether ocean,\r\ntheir decaying remains are incessantly raining downward from higher\r\nlevels. Animals in the intermediate parts, and perhaps also near\r\nthe sea-bed, can feed largely upon these falling sea-weeds. Immense\r\nquantities are doubtless snapped up _en route_; but many also reach the\r\nocean-floor undevoured, since vegetable-remains often figure in the\r\nmuds and oozes brought up thence.\r\n\r\nDeep-sea animals are very extensively eaters of mud and ooze and clay.\r\nIt does not sound like appetising fare, or what our grandparents used\r\nto describe as “palatable.” But the palate of a deep-sea fish or crab\r\ndiffers from that of a man; and since no better vegetable-food offers\r\nitself, they are probably content.\r\n\r\nThat the said creatures do really subsist in a measure upon such\r\nmaterials, is known for a fact. When drawn up to the surface, they are\r\nfound often to have their stomachs full of the mud or ooze or clay\r\nwhich in that particular place carpets the ocean-bed.\r\n\r\nEven in far shallower waters, not much removed from the “hundred-fathom\r\nline,” though still beyond the region of living sea-weed, crabs dredged\r\nup are found to have indulged freely in the same frugal rations.\r\n\r\nThere is of course no difficulty as to animal-food in any depth. The\r\nfight for life goes on below, as above; and the weaker succumbs to the\r\nstronger, or the less cunning to the more subtle, in the deep as within\r\nreach of sunlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  OCEAN FLOWERS AND LAMPS\r\n\r\n “These are the works of the Lord and His wonders in the Deep.”\r\n       Ps. civ. 24.\r\n\r\n          “Every track\r\n  Was a flash of living fire.”--COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“We have already learned,” wrote Albert, Prince of Monaco, not long\r\nsince, in reference to recent Ocean researches--“that a whole world\r\nof Fishes, Molluscs, Annelids, Medusæ, Cephalopoda, and Crustaceans,\r\ncome to the surface at night, and return before day to a depth of some\r\nhundreds of fathoms, forming a living tide which ebbs and flows in\r\nevery sea.”\r\n\r\nLetting alone for the moment other creatures mentioned in the above\r\nlist, let us think about the vast world of MEDUSÆ--of JELLY-FISHES and\r\ntheir relatives--with which the Ocean is largely peopled.\r\n\r\nWhether Hydroids, Jelly-fishes proper, Coral-polyps, or Sea-Anemones,\r\nthey all belong to a low order in the Animal Kingdom. Higher,\r\ncertainly, than the minute specks of life described in past chapters;\r\nhigher than Foraminifers; higher than Sponges; but lower than\r\nSea-urchins and Starfishes; very much lower than Worms and Oysters.\r\n\r\nThey vary immensely in size, ranging from minute jelly-bags, without\r\nlimbs or heads, mouths or stomachs, to great masses of jelly-like\r\nsubstance, with eyes and mouths and powerful stinging apparatus.\r\n\r\nAll these are included in the circle of near relatives to the “Medusæ,”\r\nwhich name was first bestowed upon the anemones from a supposed\r\nlikeness between the snaky tresses of the mythological Medusa and the\r\ntentacles of these soft-bodied animals.\r\n\r\n“Ocean-flowers,” many of them may truly be called, since they live\r\nand grow, rooted like a plant to one spot; since also they put forth\r\nveritable buds and blossoms. Only they are in nature not vegetable, but\r\nanimal. Many of these ocean blooms are exquisitely beautiful; but they\r\nmay not always be gathered with impunity.\r\n\r\n“Ocean-lamps,” too, many may with truth be named. Large numbers of\r\nthe coral-polyps, large numbers of the hydroids, and perhaps all of\r\nthe free-swimming medusæ or jelly-fishes, carry with them their own\r\nlittle lanterns, wherewith at night to make bright the surface of the\r\nsea--wherewith also to bear glimmers of light downward into those black\r\ndepths where sunlight cannot reach.\r\n\r\nThat Jelly-fish which “swam in a tropical sea,” and said, “This world\r\nit consists of ME!” must have been an unusually intelligent specimen\r\nof its kind. Jelly-fishes in general are not credited with even much\r\nbodily sensation, far less with mental originality.\r\n\r\nCoral-polyps have had their meed of attention in an earlier chapter.\r\nThere is a near relationship between the reef-builders of equatorial\r\nseas and the anemones of British sea-beaches. But the anemone is\r\na creature of distinctly higher development than the co-operative\r\ncoral-polyp. It has at least the great gift of individuality, which its\r\nreef-cousins have not.\r\n\r\nSea-anemones have been compared to garden asters, and indeed the\r\nresemblance is not slight. The living tentacles of the one might almost\r\nbe taken for a rough copy of the thick petals of the other.\r\n\r\nIn general form sea-anemones are round soft disc-like bodies,\r\nsurrounded or trimmed by a border of fleshy tentacles, and mounted on\r\na thick fleshy stalk or cylinder, which is usually either fastened to a\r\nrock or buried in the sand.\r\n\r\nThey vary in size between half-an-inch and more than a foot in\r\ndiameter. A splendid specimen, to be found in the Pacific, is fourteen\r\ninches across the disc.\r\n\r\nThese creatures are not without a limited power of moving from place\r\nto place; though, in the case of most “attached” anemones, movement is\r\nextremely slow. A few kinds do not attach themselves at all, but rove\r\nfreely through ocean-waters, after the fashion of their cousins the\r\njelly-fishes.\r\n\r\nOne particular species, which seems to approve of change of scene, and\r\nyet not to love exertion, has hit upon a clever dodge.\r\n\r\nWhen quite young it fixes itself upon the shell of a certain kind of\r\ncrab; and as it grows larger, it gradually covers the whole back of the\r\ncrab. Where the crab goes, the anemone goes; when the crab rests, the\r\nanemone rests. Oddly enough, the crab does not appear to object to his\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nThis is no mere accidental comradeship, seen only in rare cases; for\r\nthat special description of crab is never seen without its friend the\r\nanemone perched confidingly upon its back; and that special description\r\nof anemone is never seen without its friend the crab for a steed.\r\n\r\nA sea-anemone, like a coral-polyp, has a mouth and a stomach. But\r\nunlike the coral-polyp, it has the mouth and stomach for its own use,\r\nnot merely in trust for the benefit of the whole community.\r\n\r\nWhen the pretty flower-like creature wishes to open itself out, it\r\ntakes in a quantity of salt water. When it wishes to shut itself up, it\r\nspurts the water out, drawing its tentacles close.\r\n\r\nBoth mouth and stomach are elastic; and it is able to swallow animals\r\nthat are very little smaller than itself. Sometimes it gulps up\r\ngreedily a whole crab or bivalve, digesting the soft animal parts, and\r\ngetting rid of the useless shell as easily as it gets rid of water,\r\nwhen about to close.\r\n\r\nSoft and mild and helpless as a sea-anemone may seem, it is really far\r\nfrom being defenceless.\r\n\r\nWithin that plump body, around the mouth, in the skin, about the\r\ntentacles, and along the slender hanging white cords, lie concealed\r\nthousands, even millions, of weapons. Each weapon is a very fine and\r\ndelicate thread of hollow make, curled tightly up in a minute cell,\r\nready for use. When a sea-anemone desires to injure or to kill, either\r\nin defence or in attack, it darts out a number of these little “lassos”\r\nas they are called.\r\n\r\nEach lasso is not merely unwound, but is actually turned inside out,\r\nas you may turn a stocking inside out, when drawing it off. And as the\r\ninstantaneous process takes place, poison flows with the tiny dart into\r\nthe wound that is made. Small though each lasso may be, when dozens or\r\nhundreds of them are launched together, the result is not contemptible,\r\neven as regards man; and ocean creatures die fast from the poison.\r\n\r\nA cell which contains a lasso is about one five-thousandth of an inch\r\nacross; and two hundred lassos, placed end to end, would reach to about\r\nan inch in length. When once a lasso has been darted forth, it can\r\nnever again be used, because it cannot be returned to the cell. But so\r\ngreat are the supplies of them, that a sea-anemone never gets to the\r\nend of its armoury. Even if all were used, others would speedily grow\r\nin their place.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of animals, living in the sea and of service to man, are\r\nin danger of being thinned out of existence by the incessant ravages\r\nof net and trawl, of hook and harpoon. Not so the world of Anemones.\r\nSo vast are their numbers, so rapid is their increase, that no\r\nantagonistic forces can annihilate them.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that if every anemone on British shores were one day\r\nswept away, carried off by an army of ardent naturalists, or destroyed\r\nby waves in some tremendous tempest, the next inflowing tide would\r\nbring a fresh supply, sufficient to fill all gaps.\r\n\r\nNot less numerous, perhaps far more numerous, are the countless hordes\r\nof Jelly-fishes, so called, though they are not fishes--of Sea-nettles,\r\nso called, though they are not nettles.\r\n\r\nThey travel freely through the ocean depths, like fishes; and they\r\nsting sharply, like nettles. Yet they are neither.\r\n\r\nAnother name given to them is that of “Sun-fishes,” because in calm\r\nweather they often float close to the surface of the sea, as if\r\ndelighting to bask in sunshine. One could almost imagine that, after\r\nthe fashion of modern “luminous paint,” they are taking in sunlight,\r\nto carry stores thereof later into dark depths, for the benefit of\r\nless favoured comrades. But let a heavy storm arise, and swiftly these\r\nfragile creatures wend their way into the placid depths, beyond reach\r\nof wind and wave.\r\n\r\nMany years ago a story was told of a certain farmer, who had heard that\r\nmedusæ were particularly good as manure. He had large supplies of them\r\ncarted to his land, with much expense and trouble. Not till later did\r\nhe learn how small a part of the creatures consisted of anything but\r\nwater; how easily he might have had the whole mass of them dried, and\r\nthen carried by hand, at almost no cost.\r\n\r\nMedusæ, as earlier stated, are of all sizes, from tiny translucent bags\r\nof liquid to huge discs of jelly-like substance, rivalling a man’s\r\numbrella in diameter.\r\n\r\nThey are also of all kinds and shapes. Many of umbrella-shape have,\r\nin place of a handle, bundles of fleshy tentacles hanging down below,\r\nand thin streamers reaching to a length of a hundred feet. Some are\r\nmore like saucers or bowls. Others of longer and narrower make have\r\nbeen likened to large thimbles. Some are ribbon-like beings, moving in\r\ngraceful serpentine folds. Others have the outlines of elegant tubes.\r\nMany, again, are like little inverted delicate shrubs, or fairy-seaweed\r\nfronds, hanging downward. Some carry sail upon the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nWhile all are of a more or less jelly-like substance, some are so\r\nfrail and watery that they can only be lifted out of the sea in a pail.\r\nAny other mode causes them to drop to pieces.\r\n\r\nBut the most wonderful and beautiful characteristic of the jelly-fish\r\nis that of its self-illuminating power.\r\n\r\nHere is a description of one kind, found in the Atlantic, near the\r\ncoast of North America:--\r\n\r\n“Objects of more exquisite beauty than some of these hydroid-medusæ do\r\nnot perhaps exist. Each minute crystal chalice, with its beautifully\r\ncurved outline, elongated delicate tentacles, gently coiling and\r\nuncoiling, and its slender proboscis which hangs like a lamp in the\r\ncentre, lighting it with a soft phosphorescent glow, is the very type\r\nof delicate beauty, suggesting the wonders of fairyland.”[4]\r\n\r\n[4] J. S. KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\nAnd here is another description, no less striking; not this time of a\r\nfloating medusa, but of a small coral-zoophyte, about ten inches long,\r\ncommon in the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic:--\r\n\r\n“Nothing can exceed the beauty of the elegant opaline polyps of this\r\nzoophyte when fully expanded, and clustered like flowers on their\r\norange-coloured stalk; a beauty, however, almost equalled by night\r\nwhen, on the slightest irritation, the whole colony glows from one\r\nextremity to the other with undulating waves of pale green phosphoric\r\nlight. A large bucketful of these Alcyonaria was experimentally stirred\r\nup one evening, and the luminosity evolved produced a spectacle too\r\nbrilliant for words to describe. The supporting stem appeared always\r\nto be the chief seat of these phosphorescent properties, and from\r\nthence the scintillations travelled onward to the bodies of the polyps\r\nthemselves.”[5]\r\n\r\n[5] _Corals and Coral Islands_, by DANA.\r\n\r\nTravellers in all ages have described the marvellous illuminations\r\nseen at night on the ocean surface; illuminations long a mystery to\r\nthose who gazed with admiration. At times the whole sea is one blaze of\r\nlight; and the ship cleaves her way through liquid silver, or crimson\r\nglory, through milky whiteness or flames of blue and red.\r\n\r\nAnd the greater part, if not the whole, as we now know, is due to\r\nuncountable multitudes of jelly-creatures, floating close to the\r\nsurface, each contributing its tiny share to the radiant sheen.\r\nSometimes they are large enough to be visible to the naked eye, but\r\nmore generally they are minute microscopic beings, far too small\r\nindividually to be seen by us, yet apparent in the mass by their united\r\nbrilliance.\r\n\r\nIf millions of their glowing lamps shine in ocean’s deeper parts,\r\nwe need no longer marvel to find deep-sea animals with large and\r\nwell-developed eyes.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject, it should be added that the Medusæ have not a\r\nmonopoly of ocean-lamps. Other creatures share in the task of lighting\r\nup those midnight depths.\r\n\r\nNot long since two new species of fishes were discovered off the\r\nAzores, both of which possessed delicate organs of light-giving power.\r\nIn one of them the rows of tiny lamps could be used or hidden “at\r\nwill”--allowed to shine upon the world around, or shut off by a thick\r\ndark skin, somewhat after the fashion of a policeman’s “dark lantern.”\r\nCuttlefishes too have been found carrying natural lamps for sub-ocean\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  ARMOURED MYRIADS AND MONSTERS\r\n\r\n “The Sea hath its Pearls.”--LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n        “From out thy slime\r\n  The Monsters of the Deep are made.”--BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the multitudinous hosts of living creatures which throng the\r\nOcean, vast hordes are furnished with some kind of protective armour,\r\nthe better to take their part in the ceaseless warfare for existence.\r\n\r\nThough the armour differs widely in different kinds of animals, they\r\noffer one and all a great contrast to the soft jelly-like Medusæ.\r\n\r\nStarfishes and Sea-urchins, for example, are guarded by tough or\r\nhard skins, with actual plated armour and sharp prickles. Limpets\r\nare sheltered behind single firm shields, and in any moment of peril\r\nbecome instantly glued by suction to a rock. Oysters dwell within stout\r\nbivalve shells. Hermit-crabs carry with them empty purloined shells,\r\nof other creatures’ construction. Crabs and Lobsters wear strong\r\nsuits of sheltering armour, joined together bit by bit, as knights and\r\nsquires of old were clothed from head to foot in the many “pieces” of a\r\nmediæval soldier’s military suit.\r\n\r\nThe armoured hosts belong to various divisions in the Animal\r\nKingdom,--starfishes and sea-urchins to one; limpets and oysters to\r\nanother; crabs and lobsters to a third. And all three, together with\r\nmicroscopic jelly-specks and sponges and coral-polyps and medusæ,\r\nbelong to a much greater Division, which embraces all “Invertebrate” or\r\nBackboneless creatures.\r\n\r\nIf they have not backbones and ribs, they have skeletons of a kind.\r\nOnly, as a general rule, the skeletons lie outside or are visible\r\nthrough the transparent body, instead of being hidden away inside, as\r\nin most fishes.\r\n\r\nThe prickly-skinned starfishes and sea-urchins are familiar objects\r\nwith most of us.\r\n\r\nBoth belong to a Division in the Animal Kingdom which is well above\r\nthe level of jelly-fishes. Both have arms or rays, proceeding from\r\na central disc. But in the starfish the rays are separated; in the\r\nsea-urchin they are joined together.\r\n\r\nStarfishes and sea-urchins are able to move and even to travel, though\r\nin most cases with extreme deliberation. Both can put out little\r\ntube-feet suckers, by means of which they can change their position,\r\nand can even slowly right themselves, when turned the wrong way up.\r\n\r\nSometimes the sea-urchin uses its sharp spines as an additional means\r\nof getting along. And while the common starfish can seldom advance\r\nfaster than at a rate of about one half-inch per minute, there is a\r\nspecies which flings itself forward in a more reckless and rapid style,\r\nby using its rays as limbs.\r\n\r\nStarfish and sea-urchin are alike protected by an armour of hard\r\nlittle plates, arranged in neat rows upon the skin. Not plates made in\r\na workshop, and purchased by the owner for its use, but unknowingly\r\nsecreted by the animal itself; formed, like Foraminifera shells, from\r\nlime drawn out of the water.\r\n\r\nBetween these plates are tiny openings; and through those openings are\r\nput out the minute tube-feet. Even in armour made by skilled workmen\r\nfor human beings, joints have always been necessary; and we know from\r\nhistory how many a gallant fighter in past centuries was slain by an\r\narrow piercing where a joint allowed it to enter.\r\n\r\nCertain members of the immense Worm Family, living in the sea, wear\r\nprotective scales and bristles; but these can only be named in passing.\r\n\r\nThe great MOLLUSC Family is found throughout the whole Ocean, from sea\r\nto sea, from shore to shore, from the surface to the utmost depths. It\r\nincludes numberless subdivisions, and enormous varieties in shape and\r\nsize, in colouring and kind. It contains millions of the tiniest little\r\nfragile shells, such as those described by the poet in well-known\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n  “Slight, to be crushed with a tap\r\n  Of my finger-nail on the sand.”\r\n\r\nIt contains also the giant clams of southern seas, the hugest bivalves\r\never seen, one pair of which may weigh five hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nA Mollusc is usually a soft-bodied creature, with a so-called “foot,”\r\na nervous system, a mouth, a “mantle,” and a protecting one-valve or\r\ntwo-valve shell.\r\n\r\nThe “mantle”--a peculiarity of this family--is a curious loose fold of\r\nthe skin or wall of the body, wrapped round like a mantle. From the\r\n“mantle” is formed or secreted the hard shell, largely composed of\r\ncarbonate-of-lime. In the shell itself there are no blood-vessels,\r\nthere is no actual life; and it cannot grow, as the creature within it\r\ngrows. Yet in a sense it grows, since by the addition of constant fresh\r\nlayers to the edges it becomes larger and larger, thus accommodating\r\nitself to the increased size of its inhabitant.\r\n\r\nMollusc shells are of all imaginable shapes and kinds; and often they\r\nare of extraordinary beauty.\r\n\r\nSometimes they are thick and hard, so as to refuse the passage of\r\nlight. Sometimes they are so thin as to be translucent. Sometimes they\r\nare exquisitely pearly or iridescent. The latter effect, seen in the\r\nmother-of-pearl lining of oyster shells, is due to enormous numbers of\r\nmost fine and delicate lines, close together, which reflect and break\r\nup the rays of sunlight, much after the manner of a prism.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the whole Mollusc Family none of the members are so\r\ninteresting to man as the oyster--partly as a much-relished food,\r\npartly as the manufacturer of pearls.\r\n\r\nAmong gems worn by women few are fairer, none more emblematic of purity\r\nand grace, than these. Yet, so far as relates to any intention on the\r\npart of the oyster, any idea of forming that which is lovely and\r\nvaluable, no thanks whatever are due to the producer.\r\n\r\nAn oyster makes pearls simply for its own convenience. As in the case\r\nof other bivalves, if any foreign substance happens to get inside\r\nthe shell, and cannot be pushed out, it is straightway covered over,\r\nand thereby rendered harmless. Sometimes the intruder is a grain of\r\nsand, sometimes a parasite. Oftener yet, it is an oyster-egg which has\r\nproved a failure. In any event, the oyster promptly clothes it in that\r\nbeautiful material--pearl--which it secretes by nature, and because it\r\ncannot do otherwise.\r\n\r\nWe know well enough the ordinary size of “edible” oysters. The\r\npearl-forming relatives are often much larger, having shells from eight\r\nto twelve inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nOne does not commonly associate the idea of Mind with a Limpet. Yet it\r\nappears that even limpets are not without the organ of locality.\r\n\r\nHuman beings, brilliant in other respects, are sometimes woefully\r\ndeficient in this quality. But a limpet knows what he is about as to\r\nthe geography of his own locality. He chooses his resting-place with\r\ncare, much preferring a smooth rock-surface to one that is broken or\r\ndented. Then he clings fast, and the shell in its growth is studiously\r\nadjusted to the outlines of that selected surface. When the limpet\r\n“excursionises” in search of sea-weeds, vegetables being a needful\r\npart of his diet, it is remarkable that he returns to the same spot.\r\nEvidently he prefers his own home to new quarters.\r\n\r\nThese lower Molluscs have to be passed over quickly. A whole volume\r\nmight be filled in merely indicating the different species and\r\nvarieties of them.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the Mollusc ladder, cousin to limpets, whelks, oysters,\r\nclams, and shell-fish innumerable, but in status far above them all, we\r\nfind the powerful Cuttlefish. A “fish” in popular language; yet no fish\r\ntruly, but a very highly developed Mollusc.\r\n\r\n“Cephalopod” or “Head-footed” is the distinguishing name for this\r\nsub-class of Molluscs.\r\n\r\nVery unpleasant creatures they are to tackle--more particularly\r\nthose described by the familiar titles of “Octopus,” “Squid,” and\r\n“Devil-fish.” More particularly too when an individual of large\r\ndimensions has to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nThe species that make their home near British shores seldom reach\r\nany great size. They cannot for a moment be compared with the great\r\ncreatures of warmer climes; still less with the monsters of Ocean’s\r\ndepths. Yet it is not desirable to have a hand or a foot in their\r\ntenacious grip.\r\n\r\nMost of us have seen small specimens in an aquarium--evil-looking at\r\nthe best. Sometimes individuals of the large species visit us from a\r\ndistance, though they probably do not take up their abode by choice in\r\nour neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe body of a cuttlefish, like the bodies of most Molluscs, is\r\nenwrapped in a loose mantle, which in this instance is of strong and\r\nmuscular make, perpetually enlarging and contracting. From the one\r\nopening in the mantle emerges the head, with two large eyes and a\r\nmouth; and round the latter, which generally boasts a sharp beak like\r\nthat of a parrot, spring eight or ten long lissom powerful “arms” or\r\nlimb-like tentacles, each furnished with a row of suckers, which in the\r\nsmaller kinds look rather like buttons.\r\n\r\nThrough the opening at its neck the creature draws in and pours\r\nout water--_breathes_ it in and out, in fact. When in repose, this\r\nbreathing goes on quietly and automatically. But if the animal wishes\r\nto move, it forces the water out in a violent spurt through what\r\nis called the “siphon,” always in a direction opposite to that in\r\nwhich it intends to go. So great is the force thus employed that the\r\ncuttlefish rushes with wonderful speed, often with lightning-like\r\nrapidity, through the water.\r\n\r\nWhile not protected by outside armour, like limpets and oysters, it\r\nreally does secrete a shell; but the shell is inside instead of outside\r\nthe mantle, stiffening the latter, though not protecting it from\r\ninjury. In its case, however, the weapons of offence are sufficient,\r\nand there is less need for defensive armour.\r\n\r\nIn the cuttlefish we have a very tiger of the ocean, haunting vast\r\nareas in numbers which cannot be calculated.\r\n\r\nOne or two kinds are known which prefer to live solitary lives, but\r\nusually they herd together. Woe betide all weaker creatures where\r\nthey abound! Once caught in those powerful arms, within reach of the\r\nfierce beak, no chance for them remains. Molluscs, crabs, fishes, all\r\nalike fall victims to this ruthless destroyer. It is said that the\r\ncuttlefish, like its striped prototype on land, will kill when not\r\nhungry for the pure pleasure of killing.\r\n\r\nThe smaller species are a principal article in the diet of dolphins and\r\nof codfishes. But the giants of the race would be in all cases too\r\nmuch for these puny foes.\r\n\r\nEven a Bengal tiger, however, may be mastered by an elephant; and the\r\nmightiest of squids has to succumb before the yet mightier sperm whale.\r\n\r\n“The monsters vast of ages past” received attention in a well-known\r\npoem. But the monsters vast of ocean-depths in the present may surely\r\ncompete with them. Happily for mankind, these awful creatures do not\r\nfrequently come out of their “ocean-caves” to be interviewed.\r\n\r\nNow and again one is caught, or is flung ashore by a storm, or its dead\r\nremains are found and examined.\r\n\r\nOne huge creature, captured near Labrador, was reported to have a\r\nbody thirteen feet long, with arms reaching to a distance from the\r\nhead of thirty-seven feet. Another, left by the retreating tide on a\r\nNewfoundland beach, had a body twenty feet long, and arms about the\r\nsame in length as those last mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut no more striking description has been given than that of Mr. Frank\r\nBullen, in his fascinating volume,[6] when he tells of the tremendous\r\nmidnight conflict between a large sperm whale and, surely, the\r\nmonarch of the squids, “almost as large as himself, whose interminable\r\ntentacles seemed to embrace the whole of his great body.” The whale’s\r\nhead “seemed a perfect network of writhing arms,” and by its side\r\n“appeared the head of the great squid, as awful an object as one could\r\nwell imagine even in a fevered dream, with immense black eyes, at least\r\na foot in diameter.” As the “titanic struggle went on,” the whale, “in\r\na business-like methodical way,” munched at his huge enemy, gradually\r\novercoming its resistance.\r\n\r\n[6] _Cruise of the Cachalot._\r\n\r\nSuch a battle-royal as this is perhaps very seldom to be seen, even by\r\nthose who spend their lives upon the sea. It may be that these terrible\r\ncreatures rarely come to the surface, unless compelled to do so by a\r\nhungry whale.\r\n\r\nWhat they must be to the denizens of the deep, ever watching for\r\nprey, or pursuing it with swift determination in the darkness--“every\r\ncup-shaped disc of the hundreds with which the restless tentacles\r\nare furnished ready at the slightest touch to grip whatever is near,\r\nnot only by suction, but by the great claws set all round within its\r\ncircle--and in the centre of this network of living traps ... the\r\nchasm-like mouth, with its enormous parrot-beak”--all this and more\r\nhas been pictured by Mr. Bullen, from personal observation, in words\r\nwhich cannot be strengthened. No tale of monsters in bygone ages can\r\nwell exceed it.\r\n\r\nIf further proof be needed of the part played by cuttlefishes in the\r\nlarder of Sperm whales, it is given by those whales, which, when\r\nharpooned and in their dying agonies, throw up the contents of their\r\nvast stomachs. Out of the stomachs come great masses of undigested\r\ncuttlefish, cubic blocks many feet in diameter, swallowed whole and not\r\nyet broken up.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 an immense cuttlefish was thus disgorged by a whale, and was\r\nfound on examination to belong to a new and unknown species. The head\r\nhad vanished; but the body was clothed in a strong armour of neatly\r\narranged scales. So this was veritably an “armoured” kind.\r\n\r\nAnother monster, ejected from the stomach of another whale, had great\r\nsuckers, each sucker being supplied with “claws as powerful as those\r\nof a tiger.”[7] This last also had ocean-lamps, or “phosphorescent\r\norgans,” doubtless a help to himself in ocean depredations, and an\r\nadded terror to myriads of fleeing fishes.\r\n\r\n[7] _Geographical Journal_, Nov., 1898.\r\n\r\nYet neither strength nor speed, nor grasping arms, nor clinging\r\nsuckers, nor tiger-like claws, nor parrot-like beak, can protect the\r\ncuttlefish against its supreme foe, the Sperm whale.\r\n\r\nBut it has a method of defence, or rather of escape, often efficacious\r\neven here. When in danger, it is able to pour forth a copious stream of\r\nblack liquid, which so thickens and darkens the water around, that the\r\nwily creature is hidden, and slips away beyond reach of its pursuer.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system of the Cuttlefish is more developed than that of\r\nother Molluscs. Indeed, from the remarkable changes of colour seen when\r\nit is excited, and the tubercles which spring to view on its skin if\r\nit is made angry, one would be inclined to speak of its temperament\r\nas “highly irritable.” It also shows much more understanding than its\r\ncousins, the oysters and the clams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n  A GOODLY COMPANY OF CRABS\r\n\r\n “The slimy bottom of the Deep.”--_King Richard III._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the wealth of Ocean-life, perhaps no creature flourishes more\r\nabundantly than do Crabs and their relatives.\r\n\r\nWe still talk of Jelly-fishes, Starfishes, Craw-fishes, Cuttlefishes,\r\nbut no longer of Crab-fishes.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time that name was equally common. Everything that had its\r\nhome in the sea was popularly supposed to be a fish. We know now that\r\nnot one of the above belongs to any Fish tribe; yet in Conservative\r\nstyle we keep the old titles going.\r\n\r\nCrabs and Lobsters, Shrimps and Prawns, are members of the vast\r\nCRUSTACEAN division or family. They are so called on account of the\r\nhard protecting _crust_, or armour, by which their soft bodies are\r\nguarded. Chief and foremost among the numberless kinds included\r\nunder this head is the busy vigorous sidling Crab.\r\n\r\nAnd very important animals are crabs, in the economy of the Ocean. Not\r\nonly from their enormous numbers; not only from the wide extents of\r\nland and sea which own to their presence; not only from the fact that\r\nthey form a principal item of food to fishes and even to whales; but\r\nalso because at least one species is reckoned excellent eating for man.\r\n\r\nThere are land-crabs as well as sea-crabs. There are deep-sea crabs, as\r\nwell as shallow-water and shore crabs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DEEP-SEA CRAB\r\n\r\nThe holes in front are for the admission of water containing nutritious\r\nanimal food\r\n\r\n  _Face page 220_\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are crabs much less than half-an-inch across; and there are giant\r\nJapanese crabs, carrying heavy back-armour or “carapace,” about a foot\r\nin length and breadth, while the sprawling limbs extend to a yard and a\r\nhalf or more on either side.\r\n\r\nThose of ordinary sizes are found everywhere; in numbers beyond\r\nreckoning. Not only in tropic waters, but in moderate climes, and in\r\nfrigid zones; alike near the poles and under the equator. Different\r\nspecies, of course, in different parts, but all connected.\r\n\r\nMoreover, they are quite as much at home in the depths of the sea, with\r\nmiles of water piled over their heads, as on shelving beaches near to\r\nland.\r\n\r\nDuring the _Challenger_ Expedition crabs were fished up from all\r\ndepths--from one mile, two miles, three miles, even between three and\r\nfour miles. In those dark and icy regions the cold must be great, the\r\npressure tremendous; still crabs innumerable are there.\r\n\r\nSome sub-ocean kinds have displayed what may be looked upon as an\r\ninquiring disposition.\r\n\r\nA ship passing near the Azores brought up in a trap many large ones,\r\nbelonging to a then new species. And the curious part of the matter was\r\nthat not all of them need have come. Some were entrapped, and could\r\nnot get away; but others rose to the surface of their own free will,\r\nclinging to the outside of the trap, and not attempting to escape, even\r\nwhen drawn out of the water, and on deck.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they were dazzled by the unaccustomed brightness of light,\r\nafter the few and feeble glimmers below. But the puzzle remains--why,\r\nin the beginning, they should have chosen to leave their home, and\r\nto journey upward into unknown regions? Were they of an aspiring\r\ncharacter? Had they friends caught in the net, from whom they would not\r\nbe parted? Or was the attraction merely that of the appetising food\r\nwhich those friends were enjoying?\r\n\r\nAn interesting haul was one day made by the _Challenger_ while crossing\r\nthe Bay of Biscay; not indeed from a great depth, since the Bay is in\r\nno part very profound, but from the sea-bed. More than five thousand\r\nsmall sharp-clawed crabs came up in company; and they took quite kindly\r\nto the new conditions of life on board. They cheerfully explored the\r\nwhole vessel, turning up in every direction, during the next few days.\r\n\r\nSomething in the nature of a love for home has been shown by crabs, at\r\nleast in one instance. Many years ago a singular story to this effect\r\nwas told in a scientific paper.[8]\r\n\r\n[8] _Nature_, April 3rd, 1873.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen of Falmouth, capturing crabs off the rocks at Lizard\r\nPoint, brought them by boat to Falmouth Harbour, and kept them there\r\ntill needed, in a box sunk under water, some four miles out. Each crab\r\nhad been branded on the back with its owner’s mark.\r\n\r\nBy accident one of these boxes was broken; and all the prisoners made\r\ngood their escape. Naturally, no one expected to see them again.\r\n\r\nBut only two or three days later those very same crabs--with branded\r\ncarapaces--were caught anew by the fishermen; not near Falmouth, but as\r\nbefore, off the Lizard. How they had managed to get there, how they had\r\nfirst found their way to Falmouth Harbour, a distance of four miles,\r\nand then for miles more along the coast, are questions more easily put\r\nthan answered. The word “instinct” fails to meet the difficulty.\r\n\r\nOne thing only is clear, that they preferred the neighbourhood to which\r\nthey were accustomed.\r\n\r\nVery fearless creatures are small crabs, generally; brave, no doubt,\r\npartly because of their numbers.\r\n\r\nIn nets and trawls, where animals of many kinds are together for long\r\nhours of captivity, the weak are often destroyed by the strong, before\r\nthey can be drawn up.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the weak combine together, and prove too much for the\r\nstrong. Notably this was the case, when a dog-fish, brought up from a\r\ndepth of over fourteen hundred fathoms, was entirely disposed of in\r\ntwenty hours by crowds of hungry little crustaceans.\r\n\r\nMost of the crabs and lobsters, shrimps and prawns, which live on or\r\nnear the bottom, send their young ones up into higher levels for\r\neducation. There for a while the juveniles swim and develop, till old\r\nenough in their turn to take to the ocean-bed. Great numbers have\r\nmeanwhile been preyed upon by multitudes of fishes in those upper\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\nCrabs undergo curious changes in the course of their growth from\r\ninfancy to adult age. At certain stages they are so utterly unlike in\r\nappearance to what they become later, that for a long while they were\r\nclassed by naturalists under separate names, being actually reckoned as\r\ndifferent creatures.\r\n\r\nSince the protecting armour of a crab is far too rigid to admit of its\r\nstretching, it becomes from time to time too tight for the growing body\r\nwithin. When it can no longer be endured, it has to be cast off, and a\r\nnew suit, larger in size, has to form in its place.\r\n\r\nThis armour, like the shells of foraminifers, and the skeletons of\r\ncoral-polyps, is unconsciously secreted by the crab; and during the\r\nformation of a new suit of armour the crab has a time of weakness,\r\nof delicate health, and also of dangerous exposure to the attacks of\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of crabs have sunk to the miserable level of parasites,\r\nliving on the exertions of others, and refusing to exert themselves.\r\nOne prefers to think of the active and independent and intelligent\r\nkinds; and really, crabs have a good deal of intelligence. Quite as\r\nmuch as an average insect; though perhaps few of them could compete in\r\nan examination with ants or bees.\r\n\r\nIf any might do so successfully, it would be in all probability some\r\nmember of the Spider-crab family.\r\n\r\nTo this slender-limbed untidy class belongs the unwieldy Giant-crab\r\nof Japan. But it is his smaller relatives who excel in sense. The\r\nspider-crab has a slovenly appearance, because he attaches to himself\r\nstray bits of sea-weed and scraps of sponge or other growths, with the\r\nplain intention of becoming less easily seen.\r\n\r\nHe keeps to no regular or permanent style of adornment. The nature of\r\nhis trimmings depends entirely on the character of his surroundings.\r\n\r\nMany years ago my father had been for a short dredging excursion, near\r\nWorthing; and he brought home with him one of these small creatures,\r\nelaborately ornamented with slim strips of bright-red sea-weed.\r\n\r\nHe placed the crab in a basin of water, which contained a supply of\r\ngreen sea-weed. And next morning a change was seen. The crab had cast\r\naside his red ribbons, and had decked himself out with a smart array\r\nof green ribbons instead. Such conduct may, if we choose, be accounted\r\nfor by the magic word “instinct;” but it certainly wears the aspect of\r\ndeliberate intention, and even of some dim consciousness of cause and\r\neffect, not to speak of a knowledge of colour.\r\n\r\nThis habit of the spider-crab is now well known and recognised; and he\r\nhas been closely watched during the “dressing” process.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted that he always puts each slip of sea-weed or scrap\r\nof sponge, or aught else that he uses for the purpose, to his mouth,\r\nbefore fastening it to his body or limbs. A suggestion has been made\r\nthat his object in so doing is to lick it and render it sticky.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in some cases it could not otherwise be attached; but many of\r\nthe spider-crabs have hooked hairs, exactly adapted for holding fast\r\nsuch objects as they love to adorn themselves with.\r\n\r\nNor are the adornments always merely stuck on. Both sea-weeds and\r\nsponges frequently take root, and flourish as healthy growths upon the\r\ncrab’s back. It is an extraordinary fact that the crabs seem to know\r\nperfectly well from which kinds of sea-weed or zoophyte they may snip\r\noff little bits, with a prospect of not killing them.\r\n\r\nSo unerring, indeed, is their knowledge in this respect, that, as an\r\nauthority on the subject has stated, “the keepers of Aquaria have only\r\nto consult the crabs to learn what kinds of sea-animals will bear being\r\nthus transplanted piecemeal.”[9]\r\n\r\n[9] _Crustacea_, by STEBBING.\r\n\r\nIs this too merely “instinct”?\r\n\r\nMany a time baits were lowered in the nets of the _Challenger_ to\r\nattract victims. Oddly enough, it was found that no more effective\r\nbait could be used for crabs and their kindred than--pieces of\r\nlooking-glass! May one imagine that some friendly Medusa lent her\r\nlittle glimmer, far below, to enable the Hermit-crabs, when putting on\r\nfresh ribbons, to see their reflections, and judge of the effect? It\r\nreads rather like a page of _Alice in Wonderland_.\r\n\r\nHermit-crabs or Soldier-crabs, having an insufficient protective armour\r\nof their own, are in the habit of using empty Mollusc shells to shelter\r\nthat part of their bodies which is not guarded. One of these crabs,\r\nwhen young, chooses a shell, fitted to its size; and when grown too\r\nlarge for it, that shell is discarded in favour of a new one.\r\n\r\nBut whether the said crab commonly contents himself with an empty\r\nhabitation, the occupant of which has died earlier, or whether he first\r\nkills and eats the live Mollusc, and then “commandeers” the shell, does\r\nnot seem to be known with certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n  THE WORLD OF FISHES\r\n\r\n “He giveth food to all flesh.”--Ps. cxxxvi.\r\n\r\n “Which giveth food to the hungry.”--Ps. cxlvi. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nA world abundantly peopled. A world which holds its myriads,\r\nuncountable in kinds, beyond reckoning in numbers.\r\n\r\nNo part of the wide Ocean may be found where fishes are not, and in\r\nplaces, at seasons, the water positively teems with them, so that\r\nthey may be said almost to hustle one another for want of space.\r\nFishes, taken by themselves, letting alone jelly-inhabitants and\r\nshell-inhabitants and crab-inhabitants, would suffice to keep the whole\r\nsea alive.\r\n\r\nNo picture of the Great Deep would be, even in the humblest sense,\r\ncomplete without some little description of the world of Fish-life\r\ncontained therein.\r\n\r\nBut the subject is one of hopeless magnitude to be dealt with in a\r\ncouple of short chapters.\r\n\r\nA mere list of the names and chief characteristics of the principal\r\n“Orders” of Fishes, putting on one side the immense array of\r\n“sub-orders” and “varieties,” would speedily outrun the limits of these\r\npages. Besides, such a list would be to the ordinary reader unreadable.\r\nNatural History _savants_ have not troubled themselves to curtail\r\nsyllables in titles so used.\r\n\r\nOn land we have beasts and birds, which serve as food for man;\r\nbeasts and birds of prey; beasts and birds that are simply harmless,\r\nattractive, pretty, or interesting.\r\n\r\nIn the Ocean also we find fishes good for food; fishes of prey; fishes\r\nwhich may be classed as merely pretty, or curious, or remarkable.\r\n\r\nThis rough classification will do well enough for our present purpose.\r\nMany fishes belong of course to more than one of the divisions. That\r\nwhich is good for food may be also curious. That which acts as an ocean\r\n“beast of prey” may be also beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which fishes can dart along is often very great.\r\nBoth fins and tails are used as a means of advance; and the smooth\r\nscale-clothed skin glides with the least possible friction through the\r\nwater. No better form than the “boat-shaped” outline could be devised\r\nfor rapid progress in a heavy element.\r\n\r\nNot only are fishes light in make, often weighing hardly more than the\r\nwater which upholds them; but also, unlike most backboned animals, they\r\nare cold-blooded. A few deep-sea kinds have no eyes, though commonly\r\nthey can see and hear and smell well.\r\n\r\nIn the sense of feeling they are believed to be very deficient, and it\r\nis doubtful whether they suffer any pain at all, in the true sense of\r\nthe word. Probably they can be conscious of discomfort.\r\n\r\nOne of their unfailing characteristics is the possession of a\r\nstupendous appetite, and with it of a superlatively good digestion.\r\nThey live to eat; and they are at it incessantly. Perhaps in their\r\ncase it does not always mean greediness, but only a due satisfying of\r\nNature’s needs.\r\n\r\nCertainly, as a race, they are not troubled with daintiness; and\r\nif they love variety of fare, they can have the same with ease.\r\nPretty much whatever comes in their path is gulped down without\r\nhesitation--“gobbled up in the twink of an eye.” Most of them, in\r\ncannibalistic style, feed without compunction upon other fishes.\r\n\r\nWhile they may be popularly said to “breathe water,” because they take\r\nin water instead of air, they depend upon life-sustaining oxygen every\r\nwhit as much as do land animals, only in a different mode.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of oxygen are ever present, dissolved, in the sea. It\r\nis not the _water_ flowing through the fish’s gills, but the _oxygen_\r\ndissolved in that water, which carries on combustion in the body, and\r\nso keeps it in life and health.\r\n\r\nThe amount of oxygen thus obtained is small; therefore the combustion\r\nis slow; therefore the blood is cold. But if, for a very short time,\r\nall oxygen could be withdrawn from the ocean, the whole multitude of\r\nfishes therein would fast die of suffocation. Sea-water alone, without\r\noxygen, could not keep them alive.\r\n\r\nThe gills are, however, so constructed that, while they can use small\r\nsupplies of oxygen dissolved in water, they cannot use large supplies\r\nof oxygen forming part of the free air. So when a fish out of water\r\ndraws in atmospheric air, its gills become dry and useless, and it dies\r\nof suffocation.\r\n\r\nA world of rapid living and dying is this which we have now in view--of\r\nkilling and being killed--of an incessant struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nMany of its inhabitants have no means of defence, save by flight; and\r\nthese feed only on beings weaker than themselves; largely on the vast\r\nhordes of the young of crabs and jelly-fishes. Others are furnished\r\nwith formidable weapons, wherewith they can actively attack powerful\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nCold-blooded though they be, and probably without the sense of physical\r\npain, they yet have their little range of emotions.\r\n\r\nAccording to one thoughtful and competent observer,[10] they can be\r\nfrightened, they can be angry, they can endure pangs of jealousy,\r\nthey can be excited by a spirit of curiosity. And though one may\r\nperhaps hardly go so far as to speak of “fishy” affection, shown by\r\none to another, yet some faint reflection of maternal anxiety seems\r\noccasionally to exist.\r\n\r\n[10] ROMANES.\r\n\r\nThey also display a real enjoyment of life, a pleasure in “being,” a\r\ndelight in playing with water and wave, and even a sportiveness, such\r\nas one might imagine to belong only to creatures of a higher grade.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the brain of a fish is better developed than the brains\r\nof any other animals of low rank, excepting only that of the Cuttlefish.\r\n\r\nSome instances have been known of tame fishes recognising, or\r\nseeming to recognise, human beings. It is open to doubt how far the\r\n“recognition” meant more than an expectation of something to eat,\r\nfollowing upon certain familiar sounds.\r\n\r\nFishes good for food--these are and have been through ages by far the\r\nmost important to man. Other kinds may be dangerous or interesting.\r\nBut without the “Food-fishes” of the Ocean the difficulties of feeding\r\nmankind would be largely increased.\r\n\r\nFor they are always there. They come without exertion on our part. No\r\nsowing, no digging, no tending of the waters, is needed to bring forth\r\nthe mighty harvest. Year after year, multitudes past imagination come\r\ninto existence, and any number of them may be had for the trouble of\r\ntaking.\r\n\r\nAll that man did in the past was his level best, by reckless\r\ndestruction, to kill the goose which lays the golden eggs, to\r\nexterminate the creatures which are to him of so incalculable a value.\r\n\r\nOf late years some steps have been taken in the other direction, some\r\nefforts have been made towards the preservation of fish and the culture\r\nof spawn. But much more remains to be done. The incessant use of line\r\nand net and trawl through centuries has thinned the multitudes of some\r\nspecies very greatly, and in the course of time they may even cease to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nThat the harm done thus far has not been far greater must be ascribed\r\nto the enormous numbers of each kind, and to the vastness of those\r\nocean-regions, where they may at any time retreat beyond man’s reach.\r\nFor this we have to be thankful. It would be an ill day for us, on\r\nwhich the chief food-fishes should fail.\r\n\r\nHerrings, for example. What would the poorer throngs of our large\r\ncities do, without that useful little cheap dish?\r\n\r\nThe amount of herrings caught yearly around British shores almost\r\nexceeds belief. They appear often in mighty shoals, swimming closely\r\npacked throughout a mile or more, being devoured as they swim, to the\r\ntune of millions, and being captured by fishermen in masses.\r\n\r\nYet year by year the supply goes on, apparently undiminished.\r\n\r\nOne fisherman alone, at work near the French coast, reckoned that in\r\nthe course of a single night he had taken over five hundred thousand\r\nherrings, half which he threw back into the sea. An unusual amount,\r\nof course. But what must be the sum-total captured in a year by the\r\ncombined efforts of all fishermen?\r\n\r\nIn a year, however, a herring produces somewhere about thirty thousand\r\neggs. What, then, must be the sum-total of eggs produced by all\r\nherrings in the ocean?\r\n\r\nTrue, vast numbers of the eggs come to nothing; vast numbers serve\r\nas food for other creatures. Yet enormous supplies escape countless\r\ndangers, and succeed. Thus the poor man’s food is bountifully given, in\r\nan ever-recurring harvest.\r\n\r\nAmong “Food-fishes” the “White” kinds are prominent, belonging mainly\r\nto two large families. One of these families includes Cod, Whiting, and\r\nHaddock. The other consists of Flat Fishes, such as Turbot, Halibut,\r\nSole, Dab, Plaice.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the first family stands the Cod, that most useful and\r\nabundant creature, found throughout the deeper waters of northern seas.\r\n\r\nDuring particular seasons the multitudes of cod are accompanied by\r\nmultitudes of cuttlefishes--rather singularly, since cuttlefish are\r\nthe favourite food of cod. But perhaps it would be more correct to say\r\nthat the cuttlefish are accompanied by the cod--the latter doubtless\r\ngoing where they can find the food that they like. At these seasons\r\nmillions of cuttlefish are caught, to be used as bait, by means of\r\nwhich enormous supplies of cod are taken for the market.\r\n\r\nA calculation has been made that, in the course of a single spring, on\r\nthe banks not far from Newfoundland, something like one hundred and\r\ntwenty millions of cod are the result of combined British and American\r\nand French exertions.\r\n\r\nHappily, this fish also is very prolific. An individual often produces\r\nthree or four millions of eggs in a season; and as many as eight\r\nmillions have been found on one fish. Here, again, immense numbers of\r\nthe eggs fail to develop, immense numbers are devoured. Yet multitudes\r\ncome to perfection, and the ocean is still furnished with cod.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a very serious danger, beginning to be recognised,\r\nin the case of cod and yet more of some other “white-fish” kinds; and\r\nthis is that in time the reckless havoc worked may outrun even these\r\nwonderful sources of renewal. Fishing has been carried on in the past,\r\nwithout thought for the future. Little or no attention has been paid\r\nto sparing the young; and the valuable roe itself has been used as an\r\narticle of food. Man may by-and-by have to pay dearly for his lack of\r\nforesight and common-sense.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the numbers of fishes in the sea, a curious tale\r\nis told about a deep-water kind of Mullet, known as the Tile-fish.\r\n\r\nThis particular species had not been discovered before the year 1879.\r\nA few specimens were then taken from over a bank about eighty miles\r\nfrom the coast of Massachusetts--large and brightly coloured. Near that\r\nbank, where they had made their home, they could at any time be easily\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nBut in the spring of 1882 a heavy gale took place; after which these\r\nfishes were seen in enormous quantities, floating at the surface of\r\nthe water, covering a space of three hundred miles in length and fifty\r\nin breadth. One who saw the singular sight reckoned that something\r\nlike fourteen hundred millions of them must have been there--enough to\r\nhave supplied every man and woman and child in the United States with\r\nbetween two and three hundred pounds’ weight of fish.\r\n\r\nIn the following autumn, when fishermen went again to the bank for\r\ntile-fish, they found none. Not a single specimen turned up. The\r\nstorm, probably by shifting the direction of the Gulf-stream and its\r\n“cold wall,” had either destroyed them all, or had slain so many as to\r\nfrighten the survivors to a distance. In that particular district they\r\nhad not, when the story was written, been seen again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n  SOME ODDITIES OF FISH-LIFE\r\n\r\n  “3 FISH. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.\r\n  1 FISH. Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the little ones.”\r\n        PERICLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf fishes which are remarkable for beauty names might be mentioned by\r\nthe hundred; alike of food-fishes, of powerful and fierce-tempered\r\nkinds, and of those which may be described as purely ornamental. Not\r\nall are graceful in shape; but vast numbers are exquisite in colouring,\r\nespecially when first drawn from the water. As they gasp out their\r\nlives, the brilliant tinting fades.\r\n\r\nAmong harmless and lovely kinds, perhaps not many could vie with the\r\nsmall radiant creatures of Coral-reefs, described by many a traveller\r\nin terms which tell of a lack of sufficient variety in adjectives.\r\nBut words in these cases convey a dim impression of the reality.\r\nFish-beauty must be seen, and seen at its best, to be appreciated.\r\n\r\nAmong curiosities of Fish-existence, too many to name, a few may be\r\ncited in passing.\r\n\r\nFlying-fishes, with their blue bodies and wing-like fins of silver, are\r\nwell known to voyagers.\r\n\r\nThey rise from the water with a vigorous upward spring, which will bear\r\nthem to a height of fifteen feet or more above the surface; and there\r\nthey skim lightly along, with apparently thorough enjoyment. Sometimes\r\nthousands are seen at once, all leaping out of their native element,\r\nand taking to the air for a variety.\r\n\r\nOften they do this to escape from a pursuing foe below; but the plan\r\nis not always successful, since they have other enemies above. Many a\r\nflying-fish in its aerial career is snapped up by a hungry gull.\r\n\r\nOne uncouth specimen is the “Frog-fish,” known also as the\r\n“Fishing-frog” or “Goose-fish,”--a flat thick rounded creature, with a\r\ncocked-up tail, an enormous mouth nearly as wide as its whole body, and\r\nknowing eyes. It bears a certain resemblance to a frog.\r\n\r\nMany instances are related of fishes “imitating” or “copying”--to\r\nuse very inadequate terms--different land animals. The Bat-fish, for\r\nexample, bears a curious likeness to a Bat. The Snipe-fish might be\r\nmistaken for first cousin to a Snipe.\r\n\r\nThere is also the Pelican-fish, an inhabitant of deep-water. It has a\r\nmouth of portentous dimensions, with a huge pelican-like pouch hanging\r\nloosely below. Little is known of its habits; but it is supposed to\r\nswim about near the ocean-bed, with its enormous jaws extended in a\r\nstereotyped yawn, taking food in a vast and wholesale fashion.\r\n\r\nAnother oddity, known as the Spook, though not interesting in its ways,\r\nhas a most “bizarre” look. Its body is long and winding, almost like\r\nthat of an eel; its fins are large; its eyes are big; and, judging from\r\nits picture, its head seems to be a cross between that of a fish and\r\nthat of a quadruped.\r\n\r\nAmong innumerable fish gormandisers one particular specimen carries off\r\nthe palm, and might win the first prize in a world-wide competition for\r\nexcellence in voracity.\r\n\r\nThe Black Swallower, most appropriately named, manages, at least now\r\nand then, to accomplish the rare feat of swallowing a morsel many times\r\nlarger than itself. It is a fish of slender make; but after such a meal\r\nthe slenderness disappears.\r\n\r\nIt seizes upon a fish, perhaps six or eight times as large as its\r\nown body, and “_gradually climbs over it with its jaws_”--a truly\r\nmarvellous exploit! Its mouth and stomach stretch elastically during\r\nthis process, till the whole of the large fish has passed inside the\r\nlittle fish, and a vast pouch hangs below, filled with the meal just\r\ntaken. This bag is the distended stomach.\r\n\r\nBut the tale carries its own moral. The greediness of the fish--and\r\napparently it is a case of individual greediness, though it springs\r\nfrom a family tendency--is punished as it deserves by death. As the\r\nswallowed “mouthful” decomposes, it loads the bag with gases, like an\r\ninflated balloon; and like a balloon the stomach acts, bearing the\r\nunhappy victim to the sea-surface, where it floats wrong way up. A\r\nsufficiently tragic ending!\r\n\r\nA stout-built animal is the Wolf-fish, varying in length from three\r\nto seven feet; and in his ways a veritable “wild beast,” powerful and\r\nsavage, with strong jaws, teeth fashioned like those of a tiger, a\r\nvicious temper, and a ferocious scowl. An abnormal appetite too is his,\r\nthough hardly equal to that of the Black Swallower. In Maine these\r\nbrutes have been known to attack fiercely human beings wading in the\r\nsea at low tide.\r\n\r\nSometimes the above is called also the “Sea Cat-fish;” but true\r\nCat-fishes belong to quite another family; and they can hardly\r\nbe described as more desirable acquaintances. With their solemn\r\nGrimalkin-like expression, their love of fighting, their sharp serrated\r\nspines, with which they can give most painful wounds, the Cat of the\r\nOcean is not likely to be transformed into a domestic pet, for at least\r\nsome time to come.\r\n\r\nThese two last quarrelsome creatures may lead us from “interesting”\r\nspecimens of Fish-life to those which have been roughly classed above\r\nas “Fishes of Prey.”\r\n\r\nProminent among the latter stands the dreaded Shark. In common parlance\r\nwe speak of a shark as a fish. Yet scientifically the description is\r\nincorrect. Sharks and Skates are now looked upon as apart from Fishes\r\nproper, being described rather as “Fish-like Vertebrates,”--not true\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\nOne very marked difference is found in the numbers of their young.\r\nWith true fishes, as already shown, eggs are produced in enormous\r\nquantities. But with sharks and skates, only one or two or at most\r\na very few young ones are brought into existence at a time, as with\r\nhigher animals.\r\n\r\nIf among wild beasts of the Ocean cuttlefishes represent tigers, then\r\nperhaps we may say that sharks represent lions or panthers. But the\r\nreputed nobility of the lion is never found in sharks.\r\n\r\nFearsome creatures they are; often huge in size, long-shaped,\r\nflat-tailed, with cavernous mouths, cruel teeth, immense strength,\r\nand bloodthirsty dispositions. Cannibals too, since they feed largely\r\non lesser fishes. To the bigger kinds a human being is merely a tasty\r\nmorsel, which may be disposed of in two snaps and a couple of gulps.\r\n\r\nThough exclusively inhabitants of the salt sea, they sometimes chase\r\ntheir prey into a river, putting up with fresh water for the nonce.\r\n\r\nSharks are found nearly all over the world, but much more abundantly\r\nin hot climates. Their numbers gradually diminish, farther and farther\r\nfrom the equator. In tropical waters they are often present in\r\noverwhelming multitudes; and a man who should venture to bathe in such\r\nparts, would be as a scrap of bread flung to a horde of hungry little\r\nfishes. In less than a minute nothing of him would remain.\r\n\r\nOff Kurrachee, where the catching of them is systematically carried\r\non, about forty thousand are slain every year. This is for the sake of\r\ntheir fins, from which gelatine is obtained for the Chinese. That so\r\nmany are killed, as a regular thing, says much with respect to the vast\r\nhordes which are _not_ killed.\r\n\r\nOf small shallow-water sharks, the most widely known are varieties of\r\nDog-fishes. Though not large enough to be a terror to man, they are an\r\nendless trouble to fishermen, destroying great numbers of captured fish\r\nin the nets, and biting off the hooks from fishing-lines.\r\n\r\nAmong larger species, one kind found in the North Atlantic is the huge\r\nmild-mannered Basking Shark, which at times lies long and lazily close\r\nto the surface of the water, in company with a school of comrades.\r\nIts teeth are unimportant, and it feeds on smaller creatures, not\r\nattempting to include man among its eatables. But since it often has a\r\nlength of thirty feet, and, like most sluggish natures, is capable of\r\nbeing roused, it becomes dangerous when excited. A blow of its tail may\r\neasily smash in the side of a whaling boat.\r\n\r\nThe largest of these creatures is the vast Whale-shark, belonging to\r\nthe Indo-Pacific Seas, sometimes over fifty feet in length, and stated\r\neven to reach seventy feet.\r\n\r\nHowever, if accounts be correct, this giant is much less of an enemy\r\nto the whale than the Greenland Shark. In the fashion of some savage\r\nnations, the latter feeds deliberately upon the live whale, biting raw\r\nsteaks at pleasure from the worried leviathan--“scooping and gorging\r\nlump after lump,” so long as it feels “dispoged.”\r\n\r\nThe Greenland Shark is credited with feeling no pain, and it is\r\nextremely difficult to kill, as the unfortunate whale attacked by it\r\nfinds to his cost.\r\n\r\nWorse than all, so far as human beings are concerned, are the famous\r\nMan-eating Sharks of tropical waters, which occasionally, but not very\r\noften, find their way to colder latitudes.\r\n\r\nAmong them, the Great Blue Shark, from fifteen to twenty-five feet\r\nlong, and the awful White Shark, known sometimes to reach a length of\r\nthirty-seven feet, have an undesirable pre-eminence.\r\n\r\nThese monsters are furnished with teeth, the reverse of “unimportant.”\r\nIn shape they are generally triangular, serrated, and sharply pointed.\r\nIn arrangement they occupy rows, the foremost only of which is in\r\nactual use. Other rows are folded back and kept in reserve, to be\r\nbrought forward when required. Thus a shark is never without a ready\r\nsupply of his formidable weapons.\r\n\r\nWhite sharks are much given to keeping in the wake of ocean-ships,\r\non the look-out for scraps thrown overboard. One such persistent\r\nfollower having been killed, an inventory was made of the contents of\r\nits stomach, as follows--“A tin can, a number of mutton bones, the\r\nhinder quarters of a pig, the head and forequarters of a bull-dog, and\r\nother and smaller things, as the auction-bill says, too numerous to\r\nmention.”[11]\r\n\r\n[11] _Standard Natural History_, ii. p. 83.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the Sharks are those savage creatures known as Rays\r\nor Skates.\r\n\r\nThe larger number of them live usually at the bottom of the sea, in\r\nsomewhat shallow waters, lying on the ocean-floor, or swimming about\r\njust above it. Thus they do not so often come into contact with man as\r\ndo sharks. But it is want of opportunity, not want of will, which keeps\r\nthem from doing harm. When they have a chance they seldom fail to use\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAmong different branches of the “Ray” division is found the tropical\r\nSaw-fish, with its long sharp teeth-laden snout, ever ready to fight\r\nthe whale. In youth the saw-fish has a strong resemblance to a shark.\r\n\r\nThen there are the Sting-rays, with barbed spines, a mere touch from\r\nwhich causes a man terrible suffering, as if from poison; while a\r\nsevere sting may end in death. These are found in South America.\r\n\r\nThere is also the family of Torpedo Rays, quite distinct from the\r\nbetter-known South American Electric Eel, but able to administer\r\nelectric shocks strong enough to render a man for the time helpless.\r\nThey are found in many waters--large creatures, rounded in shape,\r\nsmooth-bodied, thick, with longish tails.\r\n\r\nWorst of all are the huge ungainly Eagle-Rays and Sea-devils, with\r\ntheir powerful grinding teeth. These grow to an enormous size; and the\r\nlarger ones are quite capable of upsetting a big boat. Nor would they\r\nhesitate so to do, if attacked.\r\n\r\nOne such creature was said to be fifteen feet in breadth, with a tail\r\nseveral feet long; another to have been twenty feet in length; another\r\nto have been three or four feet in thickness; another to have weighed\r\nwell over twelve hundred pounds; another to have needed fourteen\r\noxen to drag its dead body. They sometimes share with Cuttlefish the\r\ndistinction of being called “Devil-fishes.”\r\n\r\nThese monstrosities are found off Barbadoes, off Jamaica, and in the\r\ntropical waters of the Atlantic and Pacific.\r\n\r\nA particularly vicious kind hovers about the Pearl Fisheries near\r\nPanama, to the terror of the divers. The creature is reported to fold\r\nits vast “wings” about any unfortunate man within reach, and then to\r\ndevour him. This answers to the usual method of ground-rays in feeding.\r\nThey glide _over_ the object they wish to devour, settle down upon it,\r\nhold it fast by the grip of a broad and heavy body, and deliberately\r\ntear it to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n  BEHEMOTHS OF THE OCEAN\r\n\r\n “There is that leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to take his pastime\r\n therein.”--Ps. civ. 26, R.V.\r\n\r\n  “Canst thou draw out Leviathan with a fish hook?\r\n  Or press down his tongue with a cord?\r\n  Canst thou put a rope into his nose?\r\n  Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?”--JOB xli. 1, R.V.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the company of hungry merciless Sharks and their relatives, an\r\neasy transition carries us to the largest of Ocean-inhabitants--the\r\nWhale.\r\n\r\nNot that sharks and whales belong to the same division in the Animal\r\nKingdom. Not that they have aught in common beyond the possession\r\nof great size and power. But because of that size and power, they\r\nnaturally come together at the close of a sketch of Ocean Life.\r\n\r\nSharks, if not in every respect to be regarded as fully and entirely\r\nFishes, are yet in most essentials “fish-like.” But Whales belong to a\r\nhigher level.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach Whales we leave lower animals behind us; we step upon the\r\nuppermost rungs of the Ladder of Life; we are in the society of Mammals.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of that ladder we found microscopic beings, specks of\r\nliving jelly, so minute as to be invisible, so primitive as to be\r\nwithout development, without separate organs. At the top of that ladder\r\nstands Man; far more than animal, by virtue of his mental and spiritual\r\nbeing; and yet an animal, by virtue of his bodily development.\r\n\r\nThe physical part of a man marks him as a Mammal. To Mammals belong all\r\nQuadrupeds; but not Birds, not Reptiles, not Fishes.\r\n\r\nA whale is not a fish. He is a Mammal. He is warm-blooded. He breathes\r\nair through lungs. He--or rather, she--feeds the young of the race, as\r\nthey are fed by quadrupeds and human beings on land. A whale-mother\r\nwill fight to the death in defence of her little one.\r\n\r\nNor is the whale the only Mammal of ocean-waters. To this highest\r\ndivision of backboned creatures belong also the Porpoise, a near\r\nrelative of the Whale; and the fierce Walrus, met often by Arctic\r\ntravellers; and the gentle Seal, with its pathetic human eyes, and its\r\nwarm soft coat, for the sake of which it suffers too frequently cruel\r\ntreatment at the hand of man.\r\n\r\nMany different kinds of whales inhabit the sea,--such as the Rorqual,\r\nthe Hump-backed, the Ziphoid. The two which are most widely known, and\r\nwhich may be regarded as foremost though unconscious rivals in human\r\nfavour, are--the Right Whale, of higher latitudes, and the Sperm Whale\r\nof tropical regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BLUE WHALE\r\n\r\n  _Face page 254_\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere is a Right Whale of Atlantic waters, closely related to the Right\r\nor Greenland Whale of Arctic Seas, though in some respects different.\r\nBut the Greenland Whale may be taken as the typical specimen of its\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nAnd a mighty creature it is; often fifty feet, and sometimes sixty or\r\nseventy, in length. A ribbon passed belt-wise around that massive form,\r\nat its thickest, would need to be something like forty feet in length.\r\nSo the Right Whale does not boast a slim waist.\r\n\r\nThe enormous head, with its capacious cavern of a mouth, takes up about\r\none-third of the whole body.\r\n\r\nAn individual of this size weighs some seventy tons. And yet so light\r\nis its make--partly due to the construction of its bones, partly no\r\ndoubt to its great lung capacity--that it actually weighs less than\r\nwater, and can with the utmost ease float close to the surface.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a Greenland whale seldom by choice wanders very far below.\r\nHe much prefers to come up and breathe every ten or fifteen minutes;\r\nthough, when fleeing from the deadly harpoon, he has been known to stay\r\nunder water at a stretch more than three-quarters of an hour. But this\r\nis exceptional.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the head are a couple of “blow-holes,” through which,\r\nwhen he rises to the surface, he breathes.\r\n\r\nIn colouring he is black above, white below. A skin about one inch\r\nthick covers enormous masses of fat, more than a foot in thickness; a\r\nfine warm blanket to guard him from cold, but also, unfortunately for\r\nthe whale, an attraction to human beings, for the sake of the oil which\r\nit yields. The outer skin is often thickly overgrown with masses of\r\nbarnacles.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most singular thing about this great creature is that\r\nit has no teeth, and that it feeds in consequence upon the lightest\r\npossible fare.\r\n\r\nIn place of teeth, inside the mouth are massive fringes of whalebone\r\nplates, side by side, smooth on the outer side towards the lips, but\r\ncovered within by long dense supplies of hair. Similar horny plates\r\ndepend from the roof of the mouth. Since the plates of this “baleen,”\r\nas it is called, are often ten or twelve feet long, and amount in\r\nnumber to many hundreds, one cannot but imagine that the whale’s mouth\r\nmust be packed unpleasantly full of furniture. But they have their use.\r\n\r\nAs he swims he holds his mouth habitually open--somewhat after the\r\nfashion of the Pelican-fish--and into the vast cave flow multitudes of\r\nsmall creatures of every kind and description.\r\n\r\nPresently a good supply has been collected, all lying on the enormous\r\ntongue, a mass of flesh often as big as a room, some eighteen feet long\r\nby ten wide.\r\n\r\nHe then nearly closes his jaws, and forces out the water. But the dense\r\nhairy fringes hold back the living creatures, which he proceeds to\r\nswallow. After which he again goes forward, open-mouthed, as before.\r\n\r\nIn a good many respects the Sperm Whale is a contrast to the Greenland\r\nWhale.\r\n\r\nHe too is of leviathan-like dimensions; generally from sixty to seventy\r\nfeet in length, and not more slender as to his waist. But only the male\r\nSperm boasts these proportions. The female is, by comparison, a dainty\r\nlittle being, seldom more than thirty or thirty-five feet long.\r\n\r\nA Sperm has one spout-hole, instead of two; and in colour he is black\r\nabove, grey below.\r\n\r\nIn his outlines a marked difference is visible. Looked upon sideways,\r\nthe form of the huge square head is precisely like the trunk of an\r\nimmense forest tree, cut off short; and the “blow-hole” is situated\r\nclose to the end or front of this “truncated” head. The latter is\r\nreally a reservoir, containing a large supply of valuable spermaceti\r\noil, for the sake of which the creature is killed by man.\r\n\r\nInstead of a mouth full of hair-fringed “baleen,” these whales have\r\nproper teeth, better suited, one would think, to their size. Their food\r\ntoo is of a far more substantial kind.\r\n\r\nIt was told in an earlier chapter how Sperm Whales live mainly on\r\ncuttlefishes; and how sometimes, in midnight combat, they fight and\r\nconquer even the mightiest of those loathsome monsters of the deep.\r\n\r\nSperms are found through wide ranges of the ocean, in most tropical\r\nwaters, as far north and as far south as 60° in each direction from the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nBut whereas Right Whales of colder seas prefer to hunt in couples\r\nonly, Sperm Whales crowd together in large companies. Sometimes, it is\r\ntrue, lonely specimens are found. They, however, are usually morose\r\nand ill-conditioned brutes, ready to fight even men. It has been\r\nsuggested that perhaps they are thus solitary _because_ of their morose\r\ntemperament, which has made it impossible for their fellows to put up\r\nwith their presence.\r\n\r\nBoth these huge whales have powerful fluked tails and small flippers.\r\nIt is curious that inside the flippers are separate branching bones,\r\nnot unlike the bones of a human hand, only covered with thick skin in\r\none piece, like a fingerless glove.\r\n\r\nThis rather seems to indicate that the flippers may be of the nature of\r\nhands in embryo.\r\n\r\nThe Sperm does not come to the surface for air nearly so often as\r\nhis Greenland cousin. Regularly once in each hour and ten minutes is\r\nthe plan he follows; and then he remains for several minutes at the\r\nsurface, going through a series of sixty or seventy mighty puffings and\r\nblowings. After which he vanishes for another hour and ten minutes.\r\n\r\nSome pathetic tales have been told of the devotion of a mother-whale to\r\nher infant--she usually has but one at a time.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present century a harpooner deliberately sent his harpoon\r\ninto an infant-whale, hoping thus to take the mother. And he had not\r\nmiscalculated the strength of maternal love.\r\n\r\nNo thought had that poor mother of saving herself by flight. She came\r\nfearlessly close to the boat, seized her wounded little one, and\r\ndragged it away with extraordinary rapidity, using up six hundred feet\r\nof line.\r\n\r\nThen she rose again, dashing to and fro in such evident “extreme\r\nagony” that one can only marvel at the men who were able to watch it\r\nunmoved. Two harpoons were flung at her, and failed to strike. A third\r\nsucceeded; but still, absorbed in her little one’s peril, she paid no\r\nheed to her own injury, made no effort to get away, and “in the course\r\nof an hour” she was killed.\r\n\r\nThat was in 1811. The same deed has been lately described by Mr.\r\nBullen--the slaying of a mother-whale, which, with her infant by her\r\nside, refused to use her great strength in self-defence, lest she might\r\nhurt that little one. Such love as this should surely be respected,\r\neven by rough fishermen.\r\n\r\nIf not in pity to the whale, another reason would suggest the same\r\nline of conduct. The folly of recklessly slaying the rising generation\r\nis beginning to be apparent. Already the supply of whales threatens to\r\nrun short.\r\n\r\nAlthough one may speak of “little ones,” and although they are\r\ngenuinely “little,” compared with grown-up specimens, one must not be\r\nled astray by the term. One very young baby-whale, when measured, was\r\nfound to be about twenty feet long. A fine strapping infant!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n  “DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS”\r\n\r\n  “With Ships the Sea was sprinkled far and wide.”--WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n        “Fair is our lot--O goodly is our heritage!\r\n  (Humble ye, my people, and be fearful in your mirth!)\r\n        For the Lord our God Most High,\r\n        He hath made the Deep as dry,\r\n  He hath smote for us a pathway to the ends of all the Earth.”\r\n        RUDYARD KIPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Whales we have reached the highest class among Ocean creatures.\r\nYet it is impossible to end here. Some few pages must be given to those\r\namong men who “go down to the Sea in ships,” who “do business in great\r\nwaters.”\r\n\r\nNot that in any sense can Man be reckoned as an inhabitant of the\r\n“Mighty Deep.” But thousands of men spend the greater part of their\r\nlives upon the Deep; tens of thousands more continually pass and repass\r\nover its surface.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of history ships became soon a necessity, partly as a\r\nmeans of going from place to place along the coasts or of travelling\r\nto other Continents and Islands, and partly for the purpose of catching\r\nfish. Those early vessels were crude and ramshackle affairs, from a\r\nmodern point of view.\r\n\r\nUnclothed and woad-stained Britons, ancestors to the Welsh of our\r\nday, had their boats, wood-ribbed and skin-covered, or osier-framed\r\nand hide-clothed. Rickety constructions at the best. Yet in them\r\nhalf-savage sailors went over the stormy Channels, to Ireland and to\r\nFrance, and even ventured into the Bay of Biscay.\r\n\r\nEnterprising Romans, with better ships, did more; and before the close\r\nof the First Century they had made their way round Great Britain. No\r\nlight feat this, in days when lighthouses and buoys existed not; when\r\nthe geography of sand-banks and rocks was unknown.\r\n\r\nThe boats in which our Saxon and Viking ancestors came to invade the\r\nwild little Island of Britain, though of light structure, were superior\r\nto the primitive British skiffs; and in the contest which followed they\r\nhad the upper hand.\r\n\r\nLater on the Danes, with vessels sixty or seventy feet long, built of\r\nheavy timbers and rowed by thirty men apiece, proved in their turn\r\ntoo much for Saxon resistance, at a time when the Saxons had become\r\nestablished as the people of the Island.\r\n\r\nKing Alfred, of noble memory, coming to the throne, found his country a\r\nprey to these marauding Danes. He then and there grasped the principle,\r\nwhich still has sway in England’s counsels, that the very existence\r\nof Britain as a Nation rests upon the strength of her Navy. With all\r\npossible despatch he had a new fleet built, composed of vessels which\r\nwere for the most part double the size of the largest Danish boats.\r\nThey were longer, wider, stouter, and were rowed each by from forty to\r\nsixty men.\r\n\r\nThe first Naval battle which followed may be looked upon as a\r\nforeshadowing of Trafalgar; for the English boats gained a complete\r\nvictory over those of the enemy, and thereby England obtained command\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nIn those times no clear distinction existed between war-ships and\r\nmerchant-ships. All were prepared to defend themselves when need arose;\r\nand any might be used, either to carry fighting-men, or to convey\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nNot until the reign of Edward I. did a difference grow up, separating\r\nthose vessels which as a rule kept to more peaceful occupations,\r\nmerely fighting in self-defence when attacked,--and those vessels which\r\ndevoted themselves to aggressive warfare. From that date, gradually,\r\nthe Royal Navy grew into being.\r\n\r\nEven in the time of Queen Elizabeth the separating line was not very\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\nThere _was_ a Royal Navy, which took its share in repelling the Spanish\r\ninvasion; and the whole of that Navy in tonnage was far from equalling\r\none huge ship of modern days, the _Celtic_, White Star Liner.\r\n\r\nOf the hundred and ninety-seven vessels, however, which met the vast\r\narray of the Armada, only thirty-four were in any sense strictly\r\nMen-of-War; and of those thirty-four one alone was over a thousand tons\r\nin weight. The remaining hundred and sixty-three were Merchant-ships,\r\nfitted up as best they might be for warlike purposes; most of them\r\nbeing under four hundred tons.\r\n\r\nBut no mistake existed about the way in which these pigmies set to\r\nwork, like bulldogs, to worry the great Spanish ships.\r\n\r\nCentury after century the Navy grew, adding in each generation to its\r\nsize and strength. English sailors found their way hither and thither,\r\nin the interests of their country, for war, for exploration, for\r\npurposes of trade, discovering unknown lands, penetrating towards the\r\nNorth Pole, mapping out the Ocean.\r\n\r\nOther Nations took their part in these explorations, and the honour\r\nof finding a New World did not rest with our ancestors. But in more\r\nrecent days the Lion’s share of research has undoubtedly fallen to the\r\nBritish; and the coast-lines of the world have been surveyed and mapped\r\nout chiefly by ships of the British Royal Navy.\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of the Nineteenth Century, all vessels, small or\r\nlarge, moved by means of the wind or by oars.\r\n\r\nThen began a change of immense importance, due to the use of steam for\r\ncarrying ships across the sea, not only with but in the teeth of the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThis method took hold and prevailed, though at first very slowly. Even\r\nin the present day hosts of merchant-ships still travel by means of\r\nsails only, making systematic use of the Trades and other steadfast\r\nwinds. When time is not a prime consideration, sailing is of course\r\nfar cheaper than steaming. On the other hand, the carrying power of a\r\nsteamer is about three times that of a sailing-vessel of the same size,\r\nsince it can generally perform three journeys in the same time that a\r\nsailing-vessel can manage one.\r\n\r\nAll over the world, in every sea, are thousands upon thousands of ships\r\nof every kind and description, night and day speeding onward, each to\r\nits destined port. Lines of Passenger-ships regularly plough the main,\r\nstarting on fixed days, and seldom failing to arrive on fixed days.\r\nMerchant ships innumerable follow certain routes, going from country\r\nto country over the Ocean, carrying the world’s produce. Mighty Navies\r\nof war-vessels, huge in bulk and terrible in possibilities, rest like\r\nsleeping leviathans upon the bosom of the deep, or steam from point to\r\npoint with resistless energy.\r\n\r\nAll this denotes a wonderful change since the days, when a few\r\nroughly-made boats used to creep round the coasts of a few inhabited\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nWide though the ocean be, with thousands of miles of water unbroken\r\nsave by occasional islands, the number of ships now always at sea is\r\nso great, that the perils of collisions are much increased. But this,\r\nof course, is chiefly in the more frequented routes, not in Ocean’s\r\nlonelier wastes.\r\n\r\nDefinite rules are laid down for the avoidance of collisions. When two\r\nvessels meet, each must steer “to the right.” All ships have to carry,\r\nafter dark, two powerful lights: a green one on the starboard or right\r\nside; a red one on the port or left side; and in the case of steamers,\r\na white light also must be seen upon the mast.\r\n\r\nThe gradual development of ships, in the course of centuries, from\r\nrude skin-covered coracles to top-heavy mediæval vessels; from them to\r\nthe stately Wooden Walls of Old England,--and, lastly, to the massive\r\nIronclads of the Empire; is full of interest. By far the more rapid\r\npart of this development was witnessed in the years of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a slight comparison between past and present sizes of ships may\r\nbe worth giving.\r\n\r\nTo begin with Passenger Vessels.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 the Cunard wooden paddle steamers, of about two hundred tons,\r\nperhaps from one to two hundred feet in length, carrying sails as well\r\nas using steam, and able to advance at the rate of eight knots an hour,\r\nwere counted good enough for the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nBy about the middle of the century the same Line had taken to\r\nscrew-steamers, built of iron, some three hundred and forty feet in\r\nlength, of four thousand tons burden, and able to get along at the\r\nrate of twelve knots.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 steel-built vessels replaced the iron-built; the length had\r\ngrown to four hundred and seventy feet; and the speed had increased to\r\nseventeen or eighteen knots.\r\n\r\nThe _Celtic_, mentioned above, launched in 1901, of over twenty\r\nthousand tons, is seven hundred feet in length, and though not equal to\r\nmany modern ships in speed, can do her seventeen knots with ease.\r\n\r\nThe same advance was seen in another line of steamers, plying their way\r\nto and from the Cape.\r\n\r\nBefore the middle of the century, ships two hundred feet in length, and\r\ngoing at the rate of seven knots an hour, were reckoned sufficiently\r\nup to the mark. _Now_ vessels five hundred feet in length, steaming at\r\na pace of twenty or more knots, are in use. One cannot but question\r\nhow long it would have taken, under the old _régime_, to transfer two\r\nhundred thousand soldiers from Great Britain to South Africa. Under\r\nthe new order of things that feat was lately accomplished in less than\r\neight months.\r\n\r\nThe same steady growth is apparent in Merchant vessels generally--in\r\ntheir gradual increase from small to large, from slow to fast.\r\n\r\nAgain, the same development is seen in Men-of-War.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1860, twelve or thirteen knots for the best speed of a\r\nbattleship was regarded as eminently satisfactory. By 1870 this had\r\nrisen to nearly fifteen knots. There for many years it stood still; but\r\nsince 1880 the outside speed of battleships has arrived at nineteen\r\nknots.\r\n\r\nFast Cruisers have exceeded the Battleships. Up to 1870 they had\r\nreached nearly nineteen knots; and since 1880 they have risen to\r\ntwenty-three knots. These, again, have been excelled by Torpedo\r\nDestroyers, which can go at the rate of twenty-six or twenty-seven\r\nknots.\r\n\r\nTogether with increase of speed has come growth in size. A modern fast\r\nCruiser has often from ten to fourteen thousand tons displacement; a\r\nmodern Battleship from thirteen to fifteen thousand tons.\r\n\r\nBut the popular notion, that Men-of-War exceed in size and weight\r\nall Passenger and Merchant vessels, is a delusion. It arises from a\r\ndifference in the mode of measurement.\r\n\r\nThe “tonnage” of a Man-of-War refers to its actual and literal weight.\r\nThe “tonnage” of a merchant-ship refers to its space for goods or\r\npassengers--its “carrying power,” in short. The two can no more be\r\nfairly compared by mere figures, than could a measurement by pounds and\r\none by quarts.\r\n\r\nMany a first-class merchant or passenger ship actually weighs more and\r\nexceeds in length the largest battleship. With the latter, size and\r\nspace cannot be the principal aim, but rather strength and endurance,\r\nwith speed.\r\n\r\nA vessel lately constructed may have a most important bearing on\r\nwarships of the future.\r\n\r\nThis “turbo-motor,” as it is called, with a new kind of engine, has\r\nreached the unexampled speed of thirty-four knots an hour; and there\r\nseems to be no reason why in time it should not do much more. Such a\r\nsuccess threatens to revolutionise the life of ships at sea.\r\n\r\nThus far British ships have been mainly spoken of; and naturally so.\r\nNot only because a British subject might be expected to put them first,\r\nbut because of their enormous preponderance in numbers and tonnage over\r\nthe ships of all other Nations.\r\n\r\nAmerican and German merchant-shipping has, it is true, of late years\r\nmade huge strides; and the last thing to be done is to underrate\r\ntheir diligence and energy, or to wish them non-success. Yet still\r\nwe, Children of the Empire which dominates the Ocean, must desire our\r\nEmpire to hold her own, must strive our utmost to keep ahead of all\r\ncompetitors in the race.\r\n\r\nPerhaps not everybody realises how far ahead we have been up to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nOther nations indeed have made great advance. What the future may mean\r\nfor them and for us, Time alone can show. But as yet they do not seem\r\nlikely to outstrip us, unless Great Britain grows lazy and lies upon\r\nher oars.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1900, the Merchant Shipping of the whole world, including\r\nall vessels of more than one hundred tons, was reckoned to amount in\r\nround numbers to over Twenty-eight Thousand Ships, and in burden to\r\nover Twenty-nine Millions of Tons.\r\n\r\nOf that vast world-fleet Eleven Thousand vessels were British. And\r\nsince the British ships were, on an average, larger than the foreign\r\nships, it meant that _nearly one-half of the tonnage of the whole\r\nworld’s merchant shipping sailed under the Red Ensign_.\r\n\r\nTo put the matter differently. In 1892 another reckoning was made;\r\nthe comparison being expressed by numbers, for the Merchant-Navies of\r\nseveral Nations. It stood as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe Merchant fleet of Italy was taken as slightly over One. Then, in\r\nproportion, the French fleet was represented by something over Two; the\r\nNorwegian, by the same; the United States, by Three; the German, by\r\nsomething over Three; and the British, by something over Twenty-two!\r\nThis included the whole tonnage or carrying power of the fleets in\r\nquestion, both sailing and steam-driven vessels.\r\n\r\nThe figures speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nOr, again, let us take all the steam fleets of the world, reckoning\r\nonly vessels over one hundred tons, and only those used for\r\nmerchandise; not Men-of-War.\r\n\r\nThese steam-fleets shall be pictured in our minds or on paper by\r\nbroad black lines, one-tenth of an inch wide. Now let us see how long\r\nsuch lines would have to be, at two different dates, for a few of the\r\nleading fleets.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1889 they would have been given thus:--\r\n\r\nJapanese.--Less than one-tenth of an inch long.\r\n\r\nAmerican.--Three and a half tenths of an inch long.\r\n\r\nFrench.--Four and a half tenths of an inch long.\r\n\r\nGerman.--Six and a half tenths of an inch long.\r\n\r\nAnd next, after a great dividing gap--\r\n\r\nBritish.--Fifty-one tenths of an inch, or over five inches long.\r\n\r\nOnce more, the figures speak for themselves. But this was a good many\r\nyears ago. Let us have the same plan repeated for the year 1897, or\r\neight years later, noting the advance made in each case.\r\n\r\nHere, again, the tonnage of the whole steam-driven fleet of each Nation\r\nmay be represented by a black line, one-tenth of an inch in width, and\r\nvarying in length according to the size of the particular fleet. Some\r\nchanges have taken place in those few years. The Japanese, instead of\r\nbeing quite at the end of the list, rank above the Spanish and the\r\nNorwegian; and the Americans have outstripped the French.\r\n\r\nThe results now stand thus:--\r\n\r\nJapanese.--Nearly three-tenths of an inch.\r\n\r\nFrench.--Five-tenths of an inch.\r\n\r\nAmerican.--Over five-tenths of an inch.\r\n\r\nGerman.--Over a whole inch, or more than ten-tenths.\r\n\r\nAnd once more, after another big dividing gap:--\r\n\r\nBritish.--About sixty-seven tenths of an inch; or over six inches and a\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nWe hear a good deal of the rapid growth of the German and American\r\nMerchant fleets, and not so much of the growth of our own. Yet\r\ncertainly we have not stood still.\r\n\r\nAccording to the above comparison, which is taken from an American,\r\nnot a British report,[12] we have not held our own badly during recent\r\nyears. British transport has actually grown the most. True, we have\r\nmerely added sixteen tenths to an already great length; whereas, in\r\nthe same period, the German fleet, adding three and a half tenths, has\r\nnearly doubled itself, and the Japanese, adding about two-tenths, has\r\ntrebled itself. But a very small amount is easily doubled or trebled;\r\nand the nearest is still a long way behind the British total.\r\n\r\n[12] _Merchant Marine of Foreign Countries_, vol. xviii.\r\n\r\nThis should not be allowed to induce a spirit of over-confidence,\r\nwhich might probably mean in time the tortoises overtaking the hare.\r\nAnd although our Merchant fleet is still almost the double of all\r\nother Merchant fleets upon Earth put together, yet the proportionate\r\ndifference has begun to grow less than it once was. Other countries are\r\nstraining every nerve in the race; and if Great Britain would keep her\r\npresent position, this is no time for slackening of effort.\r\n\r\nPowerful though our Royal Navy undoubtedly is, it has not that vast\r\npreponderance over other Fleets of War which our Merchant Navy has over\r\nother Mercantile Fleets.\r\n\r\nThe aim generally set before Great Britain of late years has been to\r\nmake and to keep the Royal Navy strong enough to be able to cope with\r\nany two other War Navies existing.\r\n\r\nBut if we had a War Navy proportioned to our Merchant Service, which\r\nmight seem only reasonable, it would have to be nearly equal in tonnage\r\nto _all_ the other fighting Navies in _all_ the world.\r\n\r\nIs our present aim high enough, in view of the tremendous interests,\r\nthe enormous risks, involved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n  AN EMPIRE: OCEAN-WIDE\r\n\r\n  “This Royal throne of kings; this sceptred Isle;\r\n  This earth of majesty; this seat of Mars;\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n  This happy breed of men; this little world;\r\n  This precious stone, set in a silver sea.”\r\n        _King Richard II._\r\n\r\n  “Never was isle so little, never was sea so lone,\r\n  But over the scud and the palm trees an English flag was flown.”\r\n        RUDYARD KIPLING.\r\n\r\n  “See what a glorious throng they come,\r\n  Turned to their ancient Home,\r\n  The Children of our England.”--LEWIS MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeep down under the sea, on the sloping ocean-floor, amid dead\r\nvegetable and animal remains, lie strange snake-like forms. Not natural\r\ncreations, but made by man and placed there for his own benefit.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1840 anything in the shape of a submarine telegraph was\r\nnot only non-existent, but, so far as is known, it had not even been\r\nthought of.\r\n\r\nSome wild dreams may have been indulged in here or there; but if so,\r\nthe dreamers kept their dreams to themselves. On land the electric\r\ntelegraph was getting into wider and wider use. The bare idea, however,\r\nof so uniting lands separated by the ocean had not been brought forward.\r\n\r\nBetween 1840 and 1850 the notion did come up, and was discussed.\r\nA small attempt was made in America, with what may be called a\r\nbaby-cable, across a slight extent of water, near land. The Professor\r\nwho made this experiment[13] ventured on a prediction that, in days\r\nto come, an electric cable might unite Great Britain and America. His\r\nfriends probably pitied him as a visionary.\r\n\r\n[13] Professor S. F. B. MORSE.\r\n\r\nThrough that decade there was no further advance. But in 1850\r\nanother step was taken. The first “open-sea” submarine cable was\r\nlaid down between Dover and Calais; one of copper wire, covered with\r\ngutta-percha, outside which was a thick leaden tube.\r\n\r\nFor the moment a slender line joined England to the Continent.\r\n\r\nThen an enterprising French fisherman, in quest of conger-eels,\r\ncaught the cable in his powerful hook, and hauled it up. He took it\r\nfor a stout sea-weed stem, and tried the effect of a nibble. It was\r\nnot appetising, and he flung it back into the water. Somewhat later,\r\nhowever, he hooked it up again; and this time he secured his spoil,\r\ncutting off a length, which he carried to his native town, as a rare\r\nocean-curiosity.\r\n\r\nNaturally, no further telegraphic messages could be exchanged between\r\nthe two countries.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, the projectors started afresh; made another cable;\r\nand put that down. This time they met with good success; and since\r\n1851 England and France have talked in confidential whispers below the\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\nMany more cables under the sea were laid in different places with\r\nsuccess. But all these were short ones.\r\n\r\nA great scheme, dimly foretold in 1842 by one far-sighted American,\r\nwas stirring. Why should not the New World be united to the Old, even\r\nas Great Britain was united to the Continent? Why not bind Europe and\r\nAmerica together by cables beneath the Ocean?\r\n\r\nNot twenty or forty or sixty miles would this require, but two thousand\r\nmiles of cable. And in any part of those two thousand miles, one slight\r\nbreak, one little flaw, would undo the whole. The plan meant thousands\r\nof pounds risked, with perhaps no return.\r\n\r\nYet it was persevered in. Before the close of 1857, that year of Indian\r\nMutiny horrors, the first attempt was made. Four hundred miles of cable\r\nslid safely down, and lay upon the ocean-bed. Then as it ran out from\r\nthe ship, it snapped. That was a failure.\r\n\r\nNext year another attempt was made. Two ships, each bearing half of the\r\ngreat coil, came together in the middle of the Atlantic, and “spliced”\r\nthe ends. After which they parted, one going east, one going west, each\r\nlaying its own share. But again the cable broke.\r\n\r\nEnough remained on hand to supply the place of the lost length. A\r\nthird effort followed quickly. For a while success seemed to crown\r\nperseverance. The whole cable was safely down; and messages were\r\nexchanged. Whispers from the Old World to the New went under two\r\nthousand miles of ocean, and answers came back. Then the wire ceased to\r\nspeak. In some manner, connection was severed.\r\n\r\nTime passed, and for a space no more was done. But in 1864 the _Great\r\nEastern_ started, carrying the whole of a new and much stronger\r\ncable--more than two thousand two hundred miles long; and of so solid a\r\nmake that each mile of it weighed three thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nOnce again disappointment lay ahead. More than half the task had\r\nbeen accomplished, when the cable broke anew, the lower end as usual\r\nvanishing.\r\n\r\nMany days the great ship hovered round, hunting for that lost line; but\r\nshe had to give up the quest, and to go home. A year later, however,\r\nthe search was resumed; and the cable, lying quietly upon the ocean-bed\r\nmore than two miles below, was found and pulled up by powerful grapnels.\r\n\r\nNot yet was man beaten in his contest with the Ocean. It takes a good\r\ndeal of beating to make the Anglo-Saxon give in. Wind and wave, depth\r\nand distance, all were against him; but he went on. The plan had to be\r\ncarried out. He meant to see this thing through. He had made up his\r\nmind to have his verbal under-sea intercourse, between Continent and\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nAnd at last he had his way. A new cable was manufactured; and this\r\ntime, not only was it laid safely, but it held good.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the new was laid also the old lost cable, which had\r\nbeen fished up from the deep. So a double line of connection existed\r\nbetween Great Britain and her Daughter-land across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThat aim fulfilled, after so much of failure and discouragement, other\r\ncables were put down in many other parts of the world. Beneath the sea\r\nin all directions they lie, joining countries widely separated.\r\n\r\nA year or two ago it was reckoned that the full extent of all submarine\r\ncables in the world had already reached a grand total of about two\r\nhundred thousand miles. Not much more will bring it to a length which\r\nmight span the distance between Earth and Moon.\r\n\r\nLately a splendid new scheme has come up, and has been adopted. This\r\nis--to unite the entire British Empire by one vast “All-British”\r\ntelegraphic system. As is the nervous system to a man, so will be the\r\nsaid telegraphic system to the Empire.\r\n\r\nAt present many telegrams have to be sent to outlying parts through\r\nforeign dominions--which is much as though a man’s brain should have\r\nto send messages to his fingers through another man’s arm. But when\r\nonce this scheme has become a reality, the Mother-land will be able to\r\nconvey, under the broadest ocean-reaches, to any of her Children in\r\ndistant parts, her requests, her warnings, her sympathy, her secrets,\r\nher congratulations, without fear of being heard by outsiders; without\r\nrisk of having her utterances stopped by perhaps “unfriendly” hands, at\r\nsome critical moment.\r\n\r\nIn this vast plan the chief cable will cover a distance of nearly nine\r\nthousand miles; and that will include a single stretch from Vancouver\r\nto Fanning Island, more than half as long again as the wire between\r\nIreland and the United States, or about three thousand five hundred\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nNo surprise need be felt at the frequent breaking of cables, strong\r\nthough they may be.\r\n\r\nThe great depth of water into which they have to be lowered, their\r\nown weight, the increased difficulties attendant upon stormy weather,\r\nand--when once they are down--the uneven character of the ocean-bed,\r\nhave all to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nCareful previous soundings are of course made, with a view to avoiding,\r\nif possible, abrupt descents and precipitous breaks in the line where\r\nthe cable is to be. One can easily understand how, if a cable lies taut\r\nacross from one ridge to another, it may snap with its own weight.\r\n\r\nBut even upon a fairly smooth bed, other dangers exist. Sometimes, deep\r\ndown, a big “landslip” takes place, and a vast mass of débris slides\r\nto a lower level. If such a mass happens to descend upon a cable, the\r\nbreakage of the latter is no unlikely event.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago, and less, Englishmen living and toiling in India\r\nreckoned themselves happy if, when they wrote “home,” a reply came by\r\nreturn of post in ten or twelve months.\r\n\r\n_Now_ answers to questions can be obtained in a few weeks, by post;\r\nand in cases of emergency, news of life or death, of safe arrival or\r\nrecovery from illness, within a few hours.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the Eighteenth Century, a British Embassy was\r\nsent to China, to interview the then Emperor of that always difficult\r\ncountry. The Ambassador and his suite were received with elaborate\r\npoliteness, at the end of their tedious voyage. China was verbally\r\npolite then, as now. But an intimation followed, warning the visitors\r\nthat, if they wished to escape unpleasant consequences, they had better\r\ntake themselves off so soon as might be. Which they had to do, since no\r\nArmy was at hand to back them up against a good many millions of yellow\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nThe story of all this reached England, and was given in the _Times_,\r\nexactly one year after it happened.\r\n\r\n_Now_ the contrast! We know at breakfast one morning what has gone on,\r\nthe previous afternoon, in China, in India, in Australia, in America,\r\nin Africa.\r\n\r\nDuring the days of the Peninsular War, battles were fought, reverses\r\ntook place, victories were won--and the news filtered slowly home by\r\nhand. Larger items of information arrived generally in the course of a\r\nfew weeks; particulars as to individuals often not for months.\r\n\r\n_Now_, not only does a check or a success on one day become known to\r\nthe Empire at large on the day following; but even while a hard-fought\r\nbattle is being carried on, we at home sometimes hear of it, and strain\r\nour mental vision, and watch in suspense for the ending.\r\n\r\nWhat would our forefathers have thought of that historic day, when the\r\nbeleaguered garrison of Ladysmith was fiercely assaulted, and we--seven\r\nthousand miles distant--knew what was being done; hearing that the\r\nheroic defenders were “hard-pressed,” and no more? Hours of agonised\r\nimpatience were lived through; not only in England, but in many a\r\nfar-off Colony beyond the Ocean, all waiting for the result. Not that\r\nthe news might not have been sooner sent from South Africa. Delay was\r\ndue to the cutting short of local sunshine, so that a heliographic\r\nmessage could not be flashed across a few miles of veldt.\r\n\r\nThis great advance has come about, not by improvements in the world’s\r\nshipping, though such improvements have not been small, but by means of\r\nthe Electric Cable.\r\n\r\nNot over the Ocean, but _under_ the Ocean, messages are despatched with\r\nlightning speed, from man to man, in all parts of the civilised Earth.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. Quite lately another and still more marvellous means\r\nof communication has been discovered; a means which, if successfully\r\nfollowed out, as seems now probable, will tend still further to\r\nrevolutionise the life of ships at sea.\r\n\r\nBy means of Wireless Telegraphy man can exchange thoughts with man,\r\nwhen the two are separated by many miles of distance. Watchers on a\r\nlonely lightship, far from land, can appeal in trouble to their friends\r\non shore. The Admiral of a great war fleet can send his voiceless\r\ncommands through space, unhampered by wire or cable, unhindered by fog\r\nor storm.\r\n\r\nNot under the water, but _through_ or _above_ the water these\r\nmessages journey; and in the course of time, this last new method of\r\nsignalling may even largely supersede the use of submarine cables.\r\nSmaller and smaller grows our world, as greater and greater become\r\nthe possibilities of intercourse between places and countries, the\r\ninhabitants of which, not very long ago, were cut off from one another\r\nby months of arduous travel. Distance is a matter of time, not of\r\nmiles. England is nearer now to her Indian Dominions than she was two\r\nhundred years ago to Italy.\r\n\r\nThe enormous importance of the command of the sea to the inhabitants of\r\nGreat Britain is, perhaps, more fully realised at the present time by\r\nBritons generally than ever before.\r\n\r\nOther Nationalities are compact, homogeneous, self-contained,\r\nself-supporting. They have sometimes their Colonies over the water,\r\nmore or less mere excrescences, additions hooked on for a purpose,\r\nseparation from which would entail no vital loss to the ruling country.\r\nThe word “Mother-country” would be a misnomer in such cases.\r\n\r\nBut with Great Britain her over-sea Colonies are an essential part of\r\nthe “body-politic”--no more to be lopped off without injury and peril\r\nto the whole Empire, than a man’s limbs can be lopped off without\r\nsuffering, and loss of blood, and danger to his life.\r\n\r\nThis great Empire of modern days is reckoned to contain “between eleven\r\nand twelve millions of square miles” of land; and “in round numbers\r\nfour hundred millions” of subjects.\r\n\r\nThe four hundred millions are not, like the hundreds of millions\r\nof Chinese, all together in one part, all surrounded by a single\r\ncontaining border.\r\n\r\nThey are everywhere; in every clime; on every ocean; under tropical\r\nskies; around temperate seas; amid frozen plains. Each fraction of the\r\nEmpire is divided from other fractions by the Ocean; and this makes\r\nneedful, as an absolute essential to the integrity of the Empire, the\r\ncommand of leading Ocean-highways, by which the different portions are\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nFrom England to India; from England to Canada; from England\r\nto Australia; from England to South Africa; from England to\r\nGibraltar and Malta and Egypt; from England to lesser Dependencies\r\ninnumerable--always the “roadway” is over-sea; always the route is\r\nacross the ocean-waters. Those ocean highways are thronged by the\r\nEmpire’s ships; and under those seas thousands of miles of stout cable\r\nin all directions serve as do the “speaking tubes” in some large\r\nbusiness establishment.\r\n\r\nAs surely as the existence of Great Britain depended in earlier days\r\nupon the strength of her Navy, so surely does the existence of the\r\nBritish Empire depend in these later days upon her command of the sea.\r\nOnce let that vanish, and the Empire must fall to pieces.\r\n\r\nA little Island in northern waters, clothed often in fogs, small in\r\nextent, crowded in population, without the means “aboard” of feeding\r\nits own people;--yet, from that same little Island are extended wide\r\nsheltering Wings around the whole globe, guarding her Dependencies,\r\nwarning off interference on the part of other Powers. So that, in the\r\ninfancy of many a young Daughter-land, and even in later more vigorous\r\ngrowth, the Children have been protected; and no man, no potentate,\r\nwhatever his ambitions might be, has dared to lay a finger on them.\r\n\r\nBut the benefit is not all or only on one side.\r\n\r\nAs years go by, children repay their parents’ care. These young\r\nsheltered lands across the Ocean are growing strong. And in the day\r\nwhen the Mother-land found herself in difficulties, they joyously\r\nsprang one and all to her help, giving freely of their time, their\r\nmoney, their strength, their bravest and best, their very life-blood,\r\nin her service.\r\n\r\nGod-given, surely, is this mighty Empire into the hands of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Race, to be used for God and for the good of Man, to be\r\ngoverned in the Name and in the Spirit of Christ.\r\n\r\nIt is a marvellous and unique sight. A world-wide Empire of modern\r\ndays; divided by broad extents of Ocean; held together, not by fear,\r\nnot by the sword, not by the iron heel of despotism, not even primarily\r\nby self-interest, but by Bonds of Love.\r\n\r\nA congeries of free Nations, Mother and Children, united into ONE, by\r\nthe noblest and purest of all ties; having had through over sixty years\r\nfor its centre, for the controlling idea and motive of Empire, a Woman\r\nof tender heart and Royal spirit, a Queenly figure on Her Throne, to\r\nwhom those hundreds of millions in many Lands were dear, since one and\r\nall they were to Her--“My People.” And though She has passed away, that\r\nthought has been taken up by Her Royal successor, one of whose first\r\nKingly utterances was in the form of letters addressed--not only to “My\r\nPeople,” but to “My People beyond the Seas.”\r\n\r\nThus around the whole world, in every zone, through both hemispheres,\r\nabout every ocean, the Union Jack never ceases to flutter in the\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman lately, speaking in public, described half humorously\r\nhow, as he journeyed round our globe, at each halting-place, at each\r\ncoaling-station, he found invariably “that bit of Rag,” so dear to the\r\nBriton.\r\n\r\nAnd no wonder! for it is the RAG which stands for Freedom.\r\n\r\nIn the lower Creation, under ocean-waters, we have seen how the fierce\r\nperpetual struggle for existence goes on; how, with scarcely more than\r\none exception, that of the mother for her little one, each creature\r\nlives and thinks and fights for itself alone. But man is capable of\r\nbetter things. A man may forget self for his Country’s sake. He may\r\nlose sight of ease and gain, in thought for the poorer, the weaker, the\r\ndarker tribes of Earth--under that protecting Flag.\r\n\r\nWherever it goes, north or south, east or west, there go also Freedom,\r\nJustice, and a liberal recognition of the rights of Man, even of the\r\nfeeblest, even of the blackest-skinned. For the first time in the\r\nWorld’s History this grand and high ideal rules in the counsels of an\r\nEmpire wide as the Ocean itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber's Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following changes have been made to the text as printed.\r\n\r\n1.
