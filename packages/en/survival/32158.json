T. Fairchild\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn giving these pages to the public I offer no apology for a restatement\r\nof fundamental principles always requiring adjustment to new life and\r\ncircumstances; but economic literature has usually dealt too exclusively\r\nwith the phenomena of manufactures and commerce to gain the sympathy of\r\nrural people. An experience of more than thirty years in handling such\r\nsubjects at the Michigan and Kansas Agricultural Colleges, together with\r\nthe expressed confidence of former pupils whose judgment I trust, has led\r\nme into the effort to bring the subject home to farmers and farmers’\r\nfamilies in this elementary way.\r\n\r\nI have carefully refrained from quotations, or even references to works\r\nconsulted, for the obvious reason that such formalities would distract the\r\nattention of most readers from the direct, common-sense thinking desired,\r\nand render the style of the book more complex. I hereby acknowledge my\r\ndebt to the leading writers of past and present upon most of the topics\r\ntreated, not excluding any school or party.\r\n\r\nThe statements of facts I have taken from best authorities, with care to\r\nverify, if possible, by comparisons. Many data have been diligently\r\ncompiled and rearranged for more exact presentation of facts, and the\r\nphenomena of prices of farm crops have been analyzed with especial care.\r\nThe necessities of the printed volume have to some extent obscured the\r\ncharts by reduction, but I trust they may be intelligible and interesting\r\nto all students of agricultural interests.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to argue or to expound difficulties beyond a\r\nsimple statement of principles involved, and the spirit of controversy has\r\nbeen absent from my thoughts throughout. Whatever bias of opinion may\r\nappear is without a tinge of bitterness toward those who may differ. I\r\ntrust that men of all views may recognize in these pages the wish of their\r\nauthor to have only truth prevail.\r\n\r\nIn offering this volume to farmers I do not assume that all questions of\r\nwealth and welfare can be settled by rule. I hope to point out the actual\r\ntrend of facts, the universal principles sustained by the facts, and means\r\nof most ready adjustment to circumstances in the evolutions of trade and\r\nmanufacture. The business sense of farmers is appealed to for the sake of\r\ntheir own welfare. Several important questions of rural welfare have been\r\ntouched only suggestively because the limits of the volume could not admit\r\nof fuller treatment.\r\n\r\nMy gratitude is offered especially to Professor Liberty H. Bailey, of\r\nCornell University, to whose suggestion and patient attention the\r\nexistence of this volume is due.\r\n\r\nGeorge T.

GENERAL WELFARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elements of welfare._—The welfare of communities, like that of\r\nindividuals, is made up of health, wealth, wisdom and virtue. If we can\r\nsay of any human being that lie is healthy, wealthy, wise and good, we are\r\nsure of his satisfaction so far as it depends upon self. When a community\r\nis made up of individuals kept in health and strength from birth to old\r\nage, sustained with accumulated treasures, wise enough to use both\r\nstrength and wealth to advantage, and upright, just and kind in all human\r\nrelations, our ideals of welfare are met.\r\n\r\nThese are four different kinds of welfare, each of which is essential, and\r\nonly confusion of thought follows any attempt to treat them all as wealth,\r\nhowever they may be intermingled and exchanged. Health is essential in\r\ngaining a full measure of wealth and wisdom, and perhaps in maintaining\r\ngenuine character; but a healthy life gives no assurance of complete\r\nwelfare. The facts concerning health in a community make a distinct\r\nsubject of study for promotion of welfare, and we call it public hygiene.\r\nThe science of education deals with ways and means of securing public\r\nwisdom. The science of government includes all facts relative to public\r\nvirtue. So the facts by which we know the nature and uses of accumulated\r\nwealth in any community make a distinct study under the name economic\r\nscience; it deals with certain definite groups of facts. To call\r\neverything good “wealth” and everything evil “ilth” adds nothing but\r\nconfusion to our thoughts.\r\n\r\n_Mutual welfare._—Every human being in society is directly interested in\r\nthe study of wealth as related to his own and his neighbors’ welfare. No\r\none can understand his relations to those about him in the family, the\r\nneighborhood, his country and the world without some understanding of the\r\nsources and uses of wealth all about him. His very industry gains its\r\nreward by certain means in society depending upon economic principles. His\r\nmotives for accumulating wealth have a distinct place. His uses of\r\naccumulated wealth are a part of the general facts which make wealth\r\ndesirable. So the study of wealth in society must be everybody’s study, if\r\neach wishes to do best for himself or for his neighbors. In such study of\r\nwelfare every one finds his interests completely blended with the\r\ninterests of others. His existence is part of a larger existence called\r\nsociety, from which he receives himself in large measure and most of his\r\nsatisfaction; to which he contributes in like measure a portion of its\r\nessential character and future existence.\r\n\r\nThe old idea that one gives up freedom of self for the advantages given by\r\nsociety has no foundation in fact, because we are born into our place in\r\nsociety without power to escape its advantages, disadvantages or\r\nresponsibilities. The maxim “Each for all and all for each” is thoroughly\r\ngrounded in the constitution of man; his needs and abilities enforce\r\nsociety and insist upon community of interests. Even personal wealth\r\nconfers little welfare outside of its relations to other human beings. The\r\nwhole progress of the human race tends toward acceptance of the clear\r\nvision of Tennyson, where\r\n\r\n\r\n    “All men find their good in all men’s good,\r\n    And all men join in noble brotherhood.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEach stage in the progress of the conquest of nature to meet human wants,\r\nfrom the gathering of wild fruits, through hunting and fishing,\r\ndomestication of animals, herding, and tillage of permanent fields, to the\r\nmanufacture of universal comforts and tools, and to general commerce, has\r\nmade more important the welfare of neighbors. Even the wars of our century\r\nare waged in the name of and for the sake of humanity. The study of\r\nindividual welfare involves the public welfare. Welfare of a class is\r\ndependent upon the welfare of all classes. Wealth of individuals is\r\ngenuine wealth in connection only with the wealth of the world. Welfare\r\nwithout wealth would imply the annihilation of space, of time, and of all\r\nforces acting in opposition to wishes.\r\n\r\n_Wealth in farming._—The subject of the following pages is wealth, how it\r\nis accumulated, how distributed to individual control and how finally\r\nconsumed for the welfare of all concerned. But special reference is made\r\nto the sources of wealth as a means of welfare in rural life, and to the\r\nbearing of definite economic principles upon farming, especially in these\r\nUnited States of America. Farming is, and must always remain, a chief\r\nfactor in both wealth and welfare, and its relations to the industry of\r\nthe world grow more important to every farmer as the world comes nearer to\r\nhim. We cannot now live in such isolation as our fathers loved. The\r\nmarkets of the world and the methods of other farmers all over the world\r\naffect the daily life of every tiller of the soil today. Commerce in the\r\nproducts of farm and household reaches every interest, when the ordinary\r\nmail sack goes round the world in less time than it took our immediate\r\nancestors to go as pioneers from Massachusetts to Ohio. It seems possible\r\nto show from the experiences of farm life the essential principles of\r\nwealth-making and wealth-handling, including the tendencies under a\r\nworld-wide commerce. These every farmer and laborer needs for his\r\nbusiness, for his home, and for his country.\r\n\r\nNature Of Wealth\r\n\r\n_Wealth defined._—If we look at the objects which men number in speaking\r\nof their wealth, we shall soon find the list differing in important\r\nparticulars from the list of things which they enjoy. All enjoyable things\r\ncontribute to welfare, but not all are wealth. Some, like the air and the\r\nsunshine, if never lacking, cannot be counted, _because no storing against\r\nfuture need is practicable_; but the fan that cools the air and the coal\r\nthat gives heat are counted when they are stored as means of meeting\r\nfuture wants. If we could not foresee wants of ourselves or of those\r\ndependent upon us, we could not gather means of supply for those wants. If\r\nwe had all wants supplied at a wish or a prayer, we should have no\r\nincentive to store. The pampered child whose every wish is met has no\r\nclear conception of wealth or its uses. Let him be without a meal, and he\r\nseeks provision for the future by an effort to save what is left over from\r\nhis last meal and by exertion to add to his store in anticipation of want.\r\nThus wants, to be met only by exertion, are the foundation of the\r\nuniversal ideas of wealth, and whatever we have stored as a provision\r\nagainst wants becomes our wealth. If hunger were our only desire, our\r\nwealth would include only stores of food, conveniences for storing, means\r\nof increasing the store, and means of utilizing the articles to be eaten.\r\nEach desire adds to the range of articles which may enter our list of\r\nobjects of wealth until enumeration is impossible. None of these, however,\r\nwill be stored as wealth beyond the limits of anticipated use: if so\r\nstored, they add nothing to the supposed wealth. An isolated family, able\r\nto consume only thirty bushels of potatoes in a season, is not more\r\nwealthy from having three hundred bushels stored: the wealth is measured\r\nby actual relations to wants not otherwise supplied. Even in a populous\r\ncity, the three hundred bushels of potatoes become a store of wealth only\r\nwhen other people need them and _are able in turn to meet other wants of\r\nthe owners_.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we soon come to estimate any object of wealth according to its\r\npower, directly or indirectly, to meet the first want that comes. A\r\ncherished memento of friendship may be ever so gratifying, and yet find no\r\nplace in our account of wealth, because it can serve no purpose in meeting\r\nother wants.\r\n\r\nAny object of wealth may cease to be counted, not because it has changed,\r\nbut because wants have changed. The last year’s bonnet goes for a song,\r\nbecause the fashion changes; the reaper rots behind the barn or at the\r\nroadside, because the harvester is wanted in its place. So the wealth in\r\nany object is limited by its relation to the present or prospective wants\r\nof its owner, and his control to meet these wants. The wealth of any\r\ncommunity is its store of material objects suited to the current wants or\r\nfitted to exchange with other communities for more suitable articles of\r\nuse. We estimate it only by thinking of uses in producing pleasure or\r\npreventing pain, its limitations in quantity to a certain range of wants,\r\nand its control for use or transfer by an owner.\r\n\r\n_Wealth distinguished from power._—Wealth is not to be confused with power\r\nof other kinds. Power may be for future exertion; wealth is the result of\r\nexertion. Power may take any form of welfare,—health, wisdom, character,\r\nas well as wealth. So no personal abilities can be counted as wealth,\r\nhowever useful they may be as means of gaining it. Jenny Lind’s abilities\r\nas a singer may have been better than wealth; but exertion of those\r\nabilities in the United States enabled her to carry back to Europe wealth\r\nof which she had none before coming. The ingenuity of Elias Howe exerted\r\nupon the sewing machine has been an immense source of wealth and welfare\r\nto the world, but it alone could not secure him daily food. Your words and\r\nmy music combined in a song fit to tickle the fancy of the multitude may\r\ntransfer wealth to our pockets, but it was in neither the words nor the\r\nmusic, nor yet in the song, and still less in the power to contrive them.\r\nIf wealth in material things had not been in possession of the multitude,\r\nthe same sweet sounds might have given satisfaction to the crowds without\r\nan idea of wealth in the transaction. Much of the welfare of the world is\r\nfrom exertion of powers entirely independent of wealth. The chief joys of\r\nhome are not measured by the wealth in our tenement. The chief welfare of\r\nsociety is only incidentally connected with wealth.\r\n\r\nChart No. I\r\n\r\n_Fluctuation of Farms and Farm Interests since 1850_\r\n\r\nAt the top is shown the relative size of farms at the close of each census\r\nperiod, with the number of acres tilled and untilled. The lower part of\r\nthe chart shows the changes in different farm interests, especially in the\r\namount and character of capital employed and the number of people engaged\r\nin agriculture. Assuming the conditions of 1850 to be par, the increase or\r\ndecrease is shown for each kind of live stock, the number of farms, the\r\ntotal farm population, and the number of farm managers, as well as the\r\nvaluation of real estate and of live stock. To illustrate, take No. 4, the\r\nnumber of cattle, excluding the cows. In 1860 there were 1.5 times as many\r\nas in 1850. In 1870, on account of the consumption and disturbance of the\r\nwar, the number was reduced to 1.4 times as many. In 1880 there were more\r\nthan 2.3 times as many, and in 1890 there were 3.48 times as many. In a\r\nfew instances the estimate for 1897, though not an accurate enumeration,\r\nis added for comparison. A careful study of these various changes will\r\nshow that while the total population in 1890 was only 2.7 times the\r\npopulation of 1850, the total number of people employed in farm\r\noccupations of every kind was 2.88 times as great; although the number of\r\nindependent farmers was only 2.28 times as great. The total value of real\r\nestate in farms was over four times as great, and the total value of live\r\nstock exactly corresponded. The number of cows, sheep and hogs had not\r\nkept up with the population; while the number of beef cattle and horses\r\nand mules had increased much more rapidly. The fact that the value of live\r\nstock had increased in much greater proportion than the numbers shows that\r\nthere has been great improvement in the individual character of the\r\nanimals. That the average wealth of farm proprietors is more than\r\nthree-fourths as large again is shown by comparison of the number of\r\nfarmers with the value of the farms. That the number of mules, cattle and\r\nhogs actually decreased between 1860 and 1870 indicates the enormous\r\nconsumption of the armies in the Civil War.\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\n  Chart I. Showing the rate of increase in farms and farm live stock as\r\n             compared with population. See explanation, p. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nChart No. II\r\n\r\n_Progress of the United States in Farm Crops since 1850_\r\n\r\nThis chart indicates to the eyes facts shown by the census reports as to\r\nthe relative increase or decrease of certain staple crops in comparison\r\nwith the population. Assuming the conditions of 1850 to be par, the\r\nseveral lines indicated by numbers show the ratio of the several crops to\r\nthe crop of 1850. Thus the wheat crop in 1860 was nearly .75 greater than\r\nin 1850; in 1870 it was 2.87 times as great; in 1880 it was nearly 4.6\r\ntimes as great; only a little greater in 1890, but in 1897 was nearly 6\r\ntimes as great. It should be remarked that the census returns are founded\r\nupon the crop of the previous year, and therefore, will not exactly\r\ncorrespond with current estimates. At a glance it will appear that rye,\r\nbuckwheat, sweet potatoes, sugar and rice have nowhere nearly kept up with\r\nthe increase of population, while all the other crops have been\r\nconsiderably in excess. The barley crop could not be shown upon the chart\r\nfor want of room, but is more than fifteen times as great. The cultivation\r\nof fruits is estimated to be twenty times as great, although the census\r\nreturns give insufficient figures for accuracy. It is evident that the\r\npeople of the United States demand a better living, as well as raise more\r\nprofitable crops, than in 1850. Some striking illustrations of the effects\r\nof the Civil War are seen in the falling off of many crops during that\r\nperiod. Only oats, wheat and potatoes increased beyond the increase in\r\npopulation. Most of the others actually diminished; and the staple\r\nproducts of the southern states prior to the war have scarcely as yet\r\nregained their previous standing. This is accounted for in part by the\r\nimmense destruction of capital, but in larger part by the entire change in\r\nconditions of plantation cultivation.\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\n   Chart II. Showing the rate of increase in total crops for the given\r\n                     period. See explanation, p. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wealth in material objects._—Our attention is called to wealth in\r\ncomparing two material objects of desire. One has more uses, more\r\nimportant uses, more rare uses, than another; or one is less easily\r\nobtained than another. In either case we prize that one in store, as the\r\nmore important. We compare two farms, as material aids to different\r\nowners, and call both wealth in different degrees. We note the condition\r\nof two countries as to all the machinery of industry, and know that one\r\nhas greater wealth than the other. We compare the accumulations of this\r\ngeneration with those of our fathers, and rejoice in our advance in wealth\r\nas one important form of power to gain a genuine welfare. Thus, in\r\ncomparing our country’s inventory by the census of 1890 with that of 1850,\r\nwe find that while its people are only 2.7 times as many, there are 3.15\r\ntimes as many farms of exactly the same number of acres, though more of\r\neach is cultivated, and that the value of property used in farming is more\r\nthan four times as great; so we know that the farmers have increased in\r\nwealth and welfare as compared with our fathers. See Charts I and II.\r\n\r\n_Rural wealth analyzed._—A brief analysis of rural wealth in any\r\nestablished community will help to understand the meaning of the word and\r\nits relation to welfare. First may be named the farm fields and\r\nplantations brought by exertions continued through long years from raw\r\nforest or prairie to present tilth and productiveness. An English farmer,\r\nwhen asked how long it took to establish a certain permanent pasture,\r\nreplied, “Three hundred years.” Second, all fences, drives and farm\r\nbuildings, for convenience of handling and storing produce and stock.\r\nThird, all the tools and implements of the trade. Fourth, all domestic\r\nanimals of every kind, and all attendants of their sustenance and growth,\r\nincluding feed and manure. Fifth, all contrivances for marketing and\r\npreparing for market. Sixth, all highways between neighbors and toward\r\nmarket. Seventh, all local elevators, stock-yards and depot facilities.\r\nEighth, the homes, with all material comforts and utensils. Ninth, any\r\nstore of provisions in cellar, pantry, smokehouse or bin. Tenth, all\r\npersonal belongings for clothing, adornment and enjoyment. Eleventh, the\r\nfamily libraries and associated treasures. Twelfth, any actual store of\r\ngold, silver or other current wealth available for future wants. This does\r\nnot include notes, mortgages, bonds, or any other promises to pay, nor\r\ncertificates of stock in any business enterprise, because these are mere\r\ntitles to wealth supposed to exist elsewhere,—as distinct from the wealth\r\nas the deed is from the farm. Thirteenth, any peculiar advantages of\r\nlocation, scenery, pure air, pure water and agreeable temperature, that\r\nare controlled by owners for personal advantage or enjoyment, and can be\r\nobjects of desire to others. Fourteenth, any “good will” attached to, and\r\npart of, particular farms, due to long established methods and facilities\r\nin preparing or marketing produce. If such “good will” is attached to a\r\nperson rather than to the place, it is not wealth, but power.\r\n\r\nThe last two are seldom distinctly enumerated by the assessor, yet they\r\nare clearly estimated in any exchange of places or transfer of titles.\r\nThey are owned, used and transferred like other forms of wealth, and save\r\nfuture exertions to obtain them. All these are wealth because they\r\ncontribute to welfare through being accumulated materials to meet future\r\nwants, and are to be measured in any estimate by their relation to the\r\nwants they will satisfy and the exertions they will save.\r\n\r\n_Future wants certain._—Wants and exertions are readily seen to be at the\r\nfoundation of all ideas of wealth as indicated above. If we are uncertain\r\nas to the continuance of any wants or uncertain as to the conditions for\r\nmeeting those wants, we stop accumulation of materials for satisfying\r\nthem. Exertion stops unless the satisfaction to be gained by our effort is\r\nforeseen with a reasonable certainty. The farmer is never absolutely sure\r\nof returns for his labor upon the cornfield; but he is reasonably certain,\r\nand is absolutely certain that the crop will not come without labor. This\r\nassumed continuance of individual wants and their relations gives the\r\ngrand motive for wealth gathering.\r\n\r\nThe means of protection and support for physical life will be needed by\r\nourselves and our children. Tools of better form and machinery of better\r\nmanufacture will be needed to reduce exertion in future. Reduced exertion\r\nfor a given satisfaction will mean a fuller supply of things we are going\r\nto need still. If these wants are fully met, we are going to have leisure\r\nto satisfy larger and higher wants. It is the certainty that each advance\r\nof wealth will bring advancing wants to consume more wealth, that gives a\r\ngenuine motive to activity in gaining wealth, i.e., in accumulating the\r\nthings to be used. The degree of uncertainty in all future plans leads to\r\nover-estimating the importance of gold, diamonds or any forms of wealth\r\nthat can most easily be transferred between places or individuals, or be\r\nturned to account in each change of necessities.\r\n\r\n_Ownership._—The importance of wants and exertion emphasizes the\r\nimportance of the individual self in all ideas of wealth. The _ownership_\r\nof one’s _own_ abilities and their products is absolutely essential to his\r\ncare for accumulation, and that care is in proportion to his security in\r\nsuch ownership. Directly or indirectly, every exertion and every sacrifice\r\nmust depend upon confidence that it will bring its object; but\r\nwealth-getting has no object without control, in some measure, of results.\r\nThis fact makes individual ownership an essential to the highest exertion,\r\na natural sequence to the right of liberty.\r\n\r\nProperty rights are grounded in the general and individual welfare, as\r\nshown in human nature and in the progress of the world along the line of\r\nprotection to property. Those communities are most happy which best\r\nprotect individual property. As J. E. Thorold Rogers remarks, “Sacredness\r\nis accorded to private property, because society prospers by it.” Even\r\ntheorizers who denounce individual property-holding found their argument\r\nupon the equity of individual rights in property. War is less harmful than\r\nanarchy, because it ensures a measure of control. Slavery has sometimes\r\nbeen less injurious than war in giving security to enjoy a portion of\r\nself. But a conquest of freedom by bloodshed is worth its cost in\r\nself-control. Civilization advances as individual responsibility for\r\nproperty, as well as everything else, is recognized.\r\n\r\nChristianity is ideally practical in upholding every man’s right to\r\nself-control in the interest of all. It distinguishes equity from equality\r\nin distribution of all good, wealth included. Public property is rightly\r\npublic when the wants and energies of all the community are best provided\r\nfor by such common ownership. Proof in each particular case is essential\r\nagainst the presumption that individual needs are the best impulses to\r\nprovision for welfare. Even common property is limited necessarily to the\r\nnumbers who can use it. No property or wealth can exist for anybody\r\nwithout the control of some human individuals for whom it is accumulated.\r\n\r\n_Wants individual._—We are likely to lose sight of the essential\r\nindividuality of wants and exertions which make wealth possible, because\r\nin any community exchange of services modifies the direct relation of each\r\nman’s wants to his accumulations. Assuming that others, wanting food, will\r\nexchange clothing for it, one man stores food alone, but in quantities far\r\nbeyond his own need, measuring its relation to all his material wants\r\nthrough the wants and exertions of others. He feels even more sure of the\r\ncontinued activity of wants and powers among a multitude than if he had\r\nbut one neighbor; but individuals, after all, must need his products and\r\nexert themselves to meet the need, or all his calculations fail.\r\n\r\n_Progress in welfare._—Economic progress must show a larger welfare to\r\nindividuals of the community. The familiar figure by which a commonwealth\r\nis compared to an animal organism fails to include the important fact that\r\nthe individuals of the commonwealth furnish the only reason for the\r\nexistence of the commonwealth itself, as well as its only means of\r\nexistence. The cells of the animal, or even the most important organs,\r\nhave no reason for existence in themselves. Each individual man furnishes\r\nthe reasons for his activity, and the needs of individual men furnish the\r\nonly reason for having a commonwealth.\r\n\r\nWe can speak of progress, then, only when these individuals secure a\r\nbetter use of wealth in some way. It may be by accumulation through saving\r\nfrom the full years for the empty, as older communities can endure a\r\ndrought with little suffering, while pioneers are ruined. It may be by an\r\nincreased product for a given exertion, as illustrated by every\r\nlabor-saving implement upon the farm or in the factory. It may be by\r\nlessening exertion for a given product, as in the devices of kitchen and\r\ndairy to make tasks lighter. It may be in better distribution of the total\r\nproduct through readier and fairer exchanges of services or products, as\r\nhappens with every improvement in transportation and every means for\r\nfairer understanding in a bargain. Lastly, it may be in more economical\r\nexpenditure for common wants, as in maintaining government machinery.\r\nUsually, progress has been marked along several of these lines at once, if\r\nnot all of them. There is reason in the statement of Charles Francis Adams\r\nthat the last century far exceeds the gain of a thousand years before.\r\n\r\n_Production, distribution, consumption._—Full consideration of rural\r\nwealth as related to welfare must first give the principles upon which\r\nwealth is produced, including exchange with all its machinery; for the\r\nmarketing of produce is today one of the chief steps in securing wealth by\r\nfarming. The thrifty farmer of today is the man of most business tact and\r\nenergy, who uses most approved means of raising, handling and marketing\r\nhis goods.\r\n\r\nIt also requires a careful study of principles upon which any product of\r\nexertions, where more than one person has contributed toward the whole,\r\ncan be fairly shared between the producers, however they have helped. A\r\nfarmer is as thoroughly interested in problems of rent, interest and\r\nprofits, if not in wages, as any other worker for wealth or welfare.\r\n\r\nIt further involves the study of economic uses for wealth, private and\r\npublic, since no wealth has found the true reason for its existence till\r\nthe uses to which it is put are known. This includes all questions upon\r\nthe economic functions of government, the ends to be served, and the\r\nraising and handling of revenues. If any patriots need to know for what,\r\nhow and in what measure their country is dependent upon their own\r\nresources, it is the farmers, whose homes make the bulk of the land we\r\nlove, whose children furnish the bone and sinew of industry, and whose\r\ninterests are most sensitive to misdirected energy in public\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n_Security in stable government._—Agriculture, of all industries, can\r\nflourish in that country alone where personal and property rights are\r\nfully understood and respected, where claims are equitably adjusted by a\r\nstable government, and where taxes are properly apportioned and revenues\r\neconomically expended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I. PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRIES: ANALYSIS OF AIMS, FORCES, MEANS AND\r\nMETHODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. Aims Of Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Production defined._—A very little thought shows that men produce nothing\r\nin the sense of creating. All production is simply overcoming obstacles to\r\nsatisfaction of wants as we find these obstacles in space, time and form\r\nor substance of natural objects. In doing this we are confined to mere\r\nability to move things. The very highest effort of man’s energy today but\r\nproves the saying of Lord Bacon, “All that man can do is to move natural\r\nobjects to and from each other: nature working within accomplishes the\r\nrest.” This is fully illustrated in farm operations. The bringing together\r\nof soil, seed, sunshine and shower, according to their natures, secures\r\nthe product of nature—a crop. Moving food and water to the steers, or the\r\nsteers to food and water, under proper conditions of warmth, air and\r\nexercise, produces beef. To know how and when and where to move things so\r\nthat nature may meet our wishes by what always happens under the same\r\ncircumstances, would be to have all the arts of life; in short, production\r\nis the art of moving things. But we distinguish different kinds of\r\nproduction according to the direct results expected from our motion, as\r\nreducing space and time, modifying the form, or changing the substantial\r\nqualities of things handled.\r\n\r\n_Transportation in production._—The change of place necessary to bring\r\ntogether wants and those things which satisfy them is a method of\r\nproducing wealth most apparent everywhere. The bringing of wild fruits\r\nfrom the forest or the swamp to the home gives them worth. The mere\r\ntransportation, change of place, gives them an importance they did not\r\nhave on the trees or bushes. In this transportation we put the energy\r\nnecessary to take grain from the fields all the way to the bake-ovens, and\r\nfinally to our mouths, or to carry the milk from the stable or yard in\r\npail, can, wagon, train, delivery cart and bottle, to the lips of the\r\nchild whose life it maintains. Every kind of material or force expended in\r\nthis process of overcoming space is used in the idea that the object is\r\nworth the expenditure in the place finally reached. If the motion stops\r\nanywhere along the way, the wealth is not obtained, or at least is held\r\nonly in expectation until the motion can be completed. While each of fifty\r\nindividuals may give a hand, and pass his claim to the next for a\r\nconsideration, the wealth is all the way increasing in anticipation, as\r\nthe object comes nearer its use.\r\n\r\nIn this progress time as well as space is an important obstacle to be\r\novercome, and we employ all means of increasing speed, or preserving\r\nagainst what we call “the ravages of time,” i. e., the operation of\r\ninjurious forces acting in time upon most material substances. The methods\r\nemployed for storing, curing and forcing to maturity the various forms of\r\nfood needed in a community are aimed at meeting this obstacle, and add to\r\nits final worth; indeed these may be the means of giving value to all the\r\nother efforts in transportation, as in moving beef from Kansas City to New\r\nYork, or fresh fruit from San Francisco to Boston.\r\n\r\nIn the same process of putting things where they are needed, all merchants\r\nare engaged. Without the store, the order upon the shelves, the ready\r\nattendant and his despatch in meeting your demand, the pounds of sugar or\r\nsalt essential to your comfort could not be had for love or money. These\r\nefforts are an essential part in the motion between wants and objects to\r\nsatisfy them. Much of this kind of motion we include under the name\r\ncommerce, though that word more directly implies the exchanges involved.\r\nThe machinery of commerce is chiefly the means of bringing things wanted\r\nto the people who want them.\r\n\r\nMuch, however, of the exertion required in all industries, especially in\r\nfarming, is simply “to fetch and carry.” It will emphasize this fact to\r\nstudy, while you eat a piece of cherry pie, the processes involved in\r\nbringing it from the treetop, grainfield, dairy and cane-field, through\r\nmill and store and pantry and oven, to your plate. Transportation cuts a\r\ntremendous figure in production of wealth. In the first stages of social\r\nlife it is almost the whole. The hunter talks of “bringing in” his game.\r\nAustralians, Hottentots and Digger Indians lived by carrying themselves\r\nfrom one supply of food to another.\r\n\r\n_Transformation in production._—Much of the material gathered by us needs\r\nsome change of form to suit our wants. An ax-helve has in it the original\r\nwood of the young hickory brought from the forest, but its form is\r\nfashioned by effort with ax, drawshave, scraper and sandpaper, until it\r\nsatisfies the judgment of an expert chopper. This transformation is\r\nemployed in any industries where wood, ivory, the metals and other\r\nminerals are shaped by tools, or by molding, or pressing or bending, to\r\nour wishes. Most fabrics are materials put into form. The word manufacture\r\ncovers most of such work where materials are manipulated by shaping; but\r\nit also includes many operations with a different aim, to change the\r\nsubstance itself.\r\n\r\n_Transmutation in production._—Men have found that two metals, tin and\r\ncopper, melted together produce brass, different in qualities from either.\r\nFarmers have for many centuries contrived, by keeping nature’s forces\r\nunder control in the wheat field, to combine certain elements of the soil,\r\nincluding its moisture, into grain. The single seed has multiplied a\r\nhundredfold through being placed in favorable conditions, with the raw\r\nmaterials at hand in the fertile soil.\r\n\r\nThe process of maintaining animals with suitable food for the production\r\nof milk or flesh is similar. The combination of flour, water, salt and\r\nyeast, by heat, first mild and then intense, into a loaf of bread is a\r\ngood illustration of a change of qualities by rearrangement of the\r\nelements of a substance. It is sometimes called transmutation, and comes\r\nthe nearest possible to creation of material things. The chemist’s\r\nlaboratory exists for making such new combinations, and many of the arts\r\nproduce materials, like steel, which would not exist without such\r\ncombination. But many have seen in the art of agriculture a most prominent\r\nillustration of transmuting coarser elements into products adapted to\r\nhuman wants for food, shelter and adornment. All such work, however, is\r\ndone by bringing objects and forces into such contact that chemical or\r\nvital changes will take place while we wait.\r\n\r\n_Production extended._—In all these three directions, or in any\r\ncombination of them, transporting, transforming and transmuting materials,\r\nmen seek the production of a supply for meeting anticipated wants, and so\r\ncontribute directly or indirectly to welfare. No one way of producing what\r\nmen need, where they need it, and when they need it, has any superior\r\nclaim to the name production. All are making the material yield up welfare\r\nto the one who needs it, and produce wealth just so far as their services\r\nare necessary in bringing the welfare. If ever any step in the process\r\nbecomes useless, it ceases to be productive of wealth and becomes waste.\r\nThe inventive powers of mankind are always at work to shorten the\r\nprocesses and hasten the advantages of production. Men study the minutest\r\nworkings of nature to find the conditions under which she does her part of\r\nthe work. The application of such minute knowledge is a chief part of\r\nevery art. This is also the object of science; for, as Guizot says, “It\r\nonly began to have a well defined existence when it confined itself to\r\nseeking the ‘how’ rather than the ‘why’ of nature’s workings.” This\r\npurpose sustains in the United States more than fifty agricultural\r\nexperiment stations, united in a great organization, to find how the\r\nnatural forces used by farmers do their work.\r\n\r\nThis prophecy of a noted economist is warranted: “Probably the greatest\r\neconomic revolution which the youth of today may in his old age behold,\r\nwill be found in this all-important branch of our industries.” When we\r\nknow how nature works, we can adjust our little motions in time and place\r\nto promote that work; we shall have the art of moving things to suit our\r\nneeds. Nothing can be truer than Tennyson’s line, “We rule by obeying\r\nnature’s powers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. Forces In Production Of Wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature._—When men learn to meet their wants by exertion in accord with\r\nnature’s ways, they are said to use the forces of nature in production of\r\nwealth. Every accumulation of materials for satisfying future needs\r\nimplies some control over natural objects. If advantage is taken of\r\nnatural motions or other activities to bring about larger accumulation,\r\nthe man whose plans secure this has gained control over, and so\r\nproperty-rights in, the natural force which he has harnessed. The wind\r\ncaught by a sail and the water controlled by a dam contribute to the\r\npower, and indirectly to the wealth, of the man who contrives to make them\r\nmove things for him. The directive actions of men necessarily appropriate\r\nthe natural objects which they use, together with all the qualities of\r\nthose objects.\r\n\r\n_Energy._—Human exertion produces wealth, as we have seen, whenever it\r\nanticipates and provides for future wants by securing at hand the things\r\nto be used. So far as this anticipation includes control of forces or\r\nqualities in nature, these natural agencies contribute to wealth of\r\nindividuals or communities. So voluntary human exertion is combined with\r\ninvoluntary forces of outside nature to give wealth. No amount of gold in\r\nAlaska is wealth until some human ability has appropriated it to human\r\nuses; but the mere fact of locating a claim for mining purposes gives the\r\nprospector advantage over any other man because of his foresight. So every\r\nactivity of nature may become a factor in wealth by human ingenuity in\r\nmaking it useful.\r\n\r\n_Natural forces._—Such natural agencies for producing wealth are seen in\r\nthe simple properties of material bodies, such as the metals or woods or\r\ngrains or fruits or flowers possess. We secure these properties for our\r\nuses. Gravity, sound, heat, light, electricity, chemical affinity,\r\ncrystallization, even life itself, are names for certain forms of energy\r\nin nature which men are using more or less to meet their wants. Whenever\r\nexertion is needed to provide for using these, the thought of wealth is\r\nconnected with the forces themselves. The fish in the sea and rivers\r\nbecome wealth to one who has caught them, and even more distinctly the\r\nproperty of the community which has protected them in breeding. Sunlight\r\nmay reach all alike in welfare, but the man who has contrived to make it\r\nprint pictures for him has made sunlight into wealth in the picture.\r\nEqually so the farmer’s energy and contrivance use the properties of soil\r\nand climate and the vital energies of seeds to make wealth in a crop.\r\n\r\n_Control for welfare._—As each individual worker gains control over any of\r\nthese properties or forces he advances in wealth and welfare. It becomes\r\nhis own means of meeting wants. If all individuals in a community share in\r\nsuch control, they think of the good things as part of the general\r\nwelfare, and do not enumerate them in anybody’s wealth except when\r\ncomparing their own condition with that of another community. Advantages\r\nof this kind constantly tend to become more universal, and so to count\r\nvery little in individual wealth. Many advantages of civilization today\r\nbelong to all the world alike, so that nature seems to meet our wants\r\ngratuitously; but the story of progress shows that these are gifts\r\ninherited from the wealth of past ages. The human exertion which they once\r\ncost is overlooked in the ease of the present. Mere fire was once a\r\ntreasure to be cherished and kept at much expenditure of strength and\r\nforesight. Now we kindle a fire so easily that nobody thinks of it as a\r\npart of the world’s wealth.\r\n\r\n_Land as a force._—Land represents a combination of natural energies and\r\nproperties so important as to be named sometimes as a distinct force in\r\nproduction. It implies, first, needed space for various kinds of exertion\r\nin both country and town. Second, it includes all mineral, vegetable and\r\nanimal bodies that are found above, on or under the surface. Third, it is\r\nsoil, an essential part of a farmer’s equipment in using nature’s\r\nprocesses of growth.\r\n\r\nAs most of these properties of land can be put to use only by repeated and\r\ncontinued exertion in the same place, a large portion of the earth is\r\nnecessarily apportioned to individual control, i. e., to the ownership of\r\nthose who can direct its uses, and so it becomes wealth. The sea in most\r\nof its uses to men requires no such local control, and so is not owned by\r\na nation even; but the harbors, ships and wharves, the oyster-beds and\r\nfishing banks, soon become the property of some body of men that will make\r\nand keep them useful. Even a pathway over the high seas may yet be\r\ncontrolled for the safety of the huge steamers that dash across.\r\n\r\nLand, except when used for absolutely universal welfare, must be under\r\nindividual control, and even then other individuals may have the right of\r\nway because of its necessity in the common use. Peculiarities of property\r\nin land arising from limitations in quantity or quality will be spoken of\r\nunder _Scarcity Prices_ and _Rent_. They differ from similar questions as\r\nto any other form of property only because this form of property seems\r\nmore permanent. Any force of nature brought under control by individual\r\neffort contributes to wealth of individuals till all gain equal control.\r\nPeculiarities of climate affect the quality of wool, cotton, grains and\r\nfruit, and even the beef and mutton raised under it. But these effects we\r\nconnect with the land. Such peculiarities also affect manufactures of\r\nvarious kinds, and so location has value.\r\n\r\n_Effort for gain._—Voluntary human effort is always made with the\r\nexpectation of gain from its exertion; otherwise it would not be made. As\r\nGuizot says, “Our ideal is to procure the maximum of utility with the\r\nminimum of effort.” The exertion is always counted in the cost of any\r\nproduct, whatever the natural forces employed. If the crop fails, or the\r\nproduct is unsalable, the effort has lost its expected reward, and\r\nprospective losses are estimated with more or less care in judging whether\r\na product is worth the exertion. The half crop of a droughty year costs as\r\nmuch as the full crop of a plenteous year, and compensation for the loss\r\nis expected from the surplus of the full crop.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the exertion given, all human energies are counted, whether\r\nthey belong to the present, like muscular power, good eyesight, quick\r\nintelligence; or to the past, like dexterity from training, superior\r\nknowledge, accumulated tools, established character. If the immediate\r\nexertion is most prominent, the word labor includes the whole exertion. If\r\ntools and machinery are used, capital is a contributor to the product and\r\ntakes its share. If skill or knowledge or character become important,\r\npersonal attainments are a chief cause of the product, and so a chief\r\nclaimant in the reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. Labor Defined And Classified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Labor defined._—Exertion of any kind for meeting individual wants we call\r\nlabor, whether it simply gathers food from the forest, or contrives the\r\nmost intricate machinery for satisfying wants that may take years to grow.\r\nExertion that has no end beyond itself, no matter how severe it may be, we\r\ncall play, and consider it important in public welfare only as it aids in\r\nhealth and morals. Labor is separated, too, from all exertions to destroy\r\nor injure the welfare of others, if we can see their object. Any person\r\nclaiming to labor professes to have given his exertions for the\r\nsatisfaction of somebody’s wants without doing violence to the welfare of\r\nothers in the community. Whenever we do not assume this we concede a state\r\nof war, violence and destruction taking the place of production and\r\naccumulation. These may require exertions usually classed with labor; but\r\nare punished instead of being rewarded, unless we can establish their\r\nfinal advantage in a larger welfare for humanity, or in defense of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n_Productive labor._—The various classifications of labor serve merely to\r\ncall attention to peculiar relations implied in the results. If exertion\r\nresults in giving additional wealth, or power to produce wealth, it is\r\ncalled productive labor; but if it contributes only to immediate comfort\r\nor pleasure or safety it is called unproductive. The distinction is useful\r\nso far as it enables us to be prudent in adjusting energies to meet real\r\nwants. All labor is maintained by the product of exertions. Any labor\r\nexpended without a product must be provided for by an increased product\r\nfrom some other form of labor. A farmer may sustain life upon the food he\r\nraises; but the wife who makes his house a home cannot live on the product\r\nof her labors. She may add to the value of some products directly, as in\r\nturning milk into butter, and raw materials into palatable food; but her\r\nchief energy may be in getting satisfaction for the household out of\r\nmaterials gained by her husband. Both are essential to the welfare of\r\neither, and prudence requires a proper adjustment between them. A force of\r\nphysicians may be needed to keep a community in working condition; but if\r\na whole community tried to live as doctors some other community must\r\nfurnish the material wealth to sustain them.\r\n\r\nAny increase of labor upon material products, either directly or\r\nindirectly, may increase ability to meet future wants, while increase of\r\nlabor upon present uses of wealth may diminish ability for the future. The\r\nwealth of a community is the product of all the labors that contribute to\r\nmake material nature useful. This classification is important in studying\r\nthe question of productive consumption of wealth, but does not decide\r\nwhich gives best results. It is a serious error to assume that the worker,\r\nwhose labor is directly applied to materials, gives to our wealth all its\r\nvalue. If several men are building a house, one may contribute as much to\r\nthe building by cooking for the rest as if he worked in turn in the\r\nconstruction. In the same way all the household, if well ordered, aid\r\ntoward the result of their united labors. The physician who shortens the\r\nillness of a farmer contributes his share toward raising the farmer’s\r\ncrop. The lawyer who makes property safer, and the minister who gives\r\nstronger motives for exertion, are sharers in the force that brings the\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n_Physical, mental, moral labor._—The classification of labor according to\r\nthe powers employed serves to call attention to the wide range of\r\nexertions rightly classed as labor. If the exertion is chiefly muscular,\r\nlabor of hands, shoulders, legs or any part of the body, it is properly\r\ncalled physical. If the main effort is that of the intellect in planning,\r\ninventing, contriving ways and means, or in remembering, counting or\r\nthinking of any kind, it is just as truly labor, but mental. If the chief\r\nexertion is in the good will that resists temptations, guards interests,\r\ncontrols violence and folly, secures order and devises liberal things for\r\nsociety, the labor is moral. Moral labor is often recognized in wages,\r\nfaithfulness being more important in some services than in others, and\r\npaid for. Mechanical devices for promoting honesty or watchfulness may\r\nsave, in part, moral labor.\r\n\r\nThis view of labor helps us to see the wide range of efforts that unite in\r\nproduction of wealth, since all the energies of a man may be employed in\r\nhis work. The successful farmer is one who makes the most of all his\r\nabilities—his muscles, his mind and his heart—and his hard work is far\r\nfrom being confined to his hands. The three kinds of labor are combined in\r\nsome proportion in every life, but the best and most productive life his\r\nmost room for hard thinking and self-control.\r\n\r\n_Operative, executive, speculative labor._—In the advancing complexity of\r\nsociety a still more important classification of labor is apparent. If a\r\nman’s effort of any kind is simply to follow directions in an established\r\nroutine, it is called operative labor, and the laborer becomes an\r\noperative. He works usually by the day, hour or piece, under a foreman or\r\noverseer. Beyond the task set for him, he has no thought nor will. Over\r\nhim is a director—the foreman, overseer, contractor or boss—whose chief\r\neffort is to carry forward to completion some plan committed to him as a\r\ntrust. The foreman’s labor is largely mental and moral in adjusting tasks\r\nand keeping the operatives, “the hands,” well employed. This is well named\r\nexecutive labor, and requires peculiar abilities and character.\r\n\r\nStill farther away from the mere task is the effort that devises the plan;\r\nadjusts part to part, decides upon materials suitable for each part,\r\nestablishes the ideal of excellence for every part and for the whole, and\r\nforesees its actual uses. Invention of every kind illustrates the exertion\r\nof foresight in planning, but such exertion is not confined to technical\r\ninvention. The farmer who lies awake nights to plan his year’s work so\r\nthat he may have the largest returns for his undertakings in marketable\r\nproducts, gives the same kind of effort as the inventor. A good name for\r\nthis is speculative labor,—an exertion to foresee and provide for future\r\nneeds of society.\r\n\r\nIn much of farm life all these are mingled: the same man devises the plan,\r\nexecutes his own ideas, and performs the tasks himself. But every one\r\nrealizes the difference of success growing out of the planning. Many a\r\ngood man needs to follow another’s plans, and not a few “work better for\r\nothers than they can for themselves.” In some great undertakings the\r\nprojector and planner, the contractor and overseer and the worker of\r\ndetails are necessarily separated. This may be well illustrated in the\r\nconstruction of a great building, for which an architect gives all\r\nattention to a plan, and may require a considerable force of assistants\r\nand draftsmen to embody his ideas on paper; then contractors, one or\r\nseveral, secure material, employ men and direct them in placing materials\r\nin form and combination to suit the plans; but a host of workmen move as\r\ndirected at the will of a foreman to pile brick, mortar, stone, iron or\r\ntimber according to the plan. The labor of the architect makes possible\r\nthe entire structure—makes the work for all that enter into his labors.\r\n\r\nThis classification into speculative, executive and operative labor helps\r\nto a fair estimate in sharing the proceeds of combined labors, and gives a\r\nproper importance to the inventive and foreseeing energy which causes the\r\ngrowth of civilization. _That form of exertion which has done most to meet\r\nthe world’s wants is speculative labor._\r\n\r\n_Invention in farming._—A capital illustration of speculative labor,\r\nproductive in the highest degree, is the invention of reaping machinery.\r\nThe inventor has gained riches by his contrivance, but the world has\r\ngained far more by his foresight and ingenuity. Similar energy has been\r\nput into all labor-saving machinery, and still plays an important part in\r\ndevising the best uses for it.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer has a similar need of planning for every field he plows.\r\nThere is a certain draft for each horse, a certain speed for the plow, a\r\ncertain adjustment of harness to the team, which gives a full return for\r\nthe force employed. A failure to find this causes waste. All the effort of\r\nscientific research into causes and conditions of growth or disease of\r\nplants and animals is speculative labor, out of which the next advance of\r\nagriculture must come. The mere operative power of a laborer can be\r\nsupplanted by brute force or by machinery, but nothing can ever supplant\r\nthe intelligent foresight that invents, plans and devises the end to be\r\nreached, and the ways and the means for reaching it.\r\n\r\nThe very foundation of any success in farming is clear foresight and\r\ndistinct planning for a succession of crops, each to be tended, harvested,\r\nstored and marketed in the very nick of time. The best energy of every\r\nfarmer is properly given to finding what crop to raise, how and when to\r\nhave it ready for the world that is going to need it. He best meets his\r\nown daily wants when “Mr. Contrivance” stands by him in all his efforts.\r\nThis contrivance is the chief exertion of a successful farmer’s life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. Capital Defined And Classified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capital distinguished from wealth._—Whenever material wealth is used not\r\ndirectly in meeting present wants, but to produce more wealth suited to\r\nfuture wants, it is called capital. Any store of good things devoted only\r\nto meeting wants as they come is thought of as wealth, as well as possible\r\ncapital, since at any time it may be made the means of creating other\r\nwealth to more than take its place. The distinction grows wholly out of\r\nthe uses of wealth, not its forms. A horse used, or to be used, as a force\r\nin production by drawing loads is counted as capital; but if used for mere\r\npleasure-riding is only wealth, which leaves no material return when\r\nconsumed. Thus the same horse may, in the hands of a breeder, a trainer,\r\nor a liveryman be capital, but in the hands of a fancier or a pleasure\r\nseeker be only wealth, to be used as wanted.\r\n\r\nWealth in dwellings or public buildings constructed for enjoyment rather\r\nthan protection of a working community is not capital, and may be\r\ndestroyed by fire or storm without serious disturbance of industry. The\r\nloss is bravely met, the hardship endured and extra energy put into\r\nrestoration. A farmer may lose a fine house and by living in less comfort\r\nfor a time restore it, while the loss of his teams or his barns may\r\ncripple his industry. In the great Chicago fire of 1871 the wealth\r\ndestroyed is estimated at $50,000,000, while the loss of actual capital\r\nmay have been only $5,000,000. An energetic use of the capital remaining\r\nwrought apparent wonders in the restoration of wealth. Indeed, the total\r\ncapital of our country is supposed to be only three times the annual\r\nproduct of industry, though a century of labor could not restore it if\r\ndestroyed entirely, because effective tools would be wanting.\r\n\r\nThe capital of an individual is such a portion of his wealth as he is\r\nusing to maintain and increase his wealth. The capital of a country\r\nincludes all the farms, so far as they are made such by improvements\r\ndirectly or indirectly, including all ways and means of communication and\r\ntransportation, for roads contribute to all goods drawn over them; all\r\nbuildings devoted to systems of production, including necessary protection\r\nof laborers themselves; all tools, machines and contrivances for power;\r\nall animals employed in connection with industry; all materials of\r\nconstruction or growth; all materials consumed in securing and maintaining\r\npower, as fuel, lubricating oil, etc., or in performing operations of\r\nmanufacture, as dye stuffs; subsistence for the workers, the brutes they\r\nuse, and the families which keep up the life and comfort of the people;\r\nthe necessary stock in trade, that all wants may be readily supplied; all\r\nthe machinery of trade for ready transfers, including any actual wealth in\r\nform of money; all the governmental machinery for protection and\r\nmaintenance of order, as a first essential to wealth-producing.\r\n\r\nAll these are more simply grouped in their different relations to labor\r\nunder three classes: first, as sustaining labor by food, clothing,\r\nprotection and material on which to work; second, as aiding efficiency by\r\ntools, machines and stored up forces; third, as stimulating exertion by\r\nreducing present anxieties and arousing more far-reaching plans for future\r\nundertakings, illustrated by possession of satisfactory stocks of goods or\r\ncomfortable homes for families.\r\n\r\n_Capital a time-saver._—All these forms of wealth serve in production by\r\nextending the possible waiting between an effort of any kind and the\r\ngreater satisfaction secured by it. No community could begin farming as a\r\nbusiness until it had secured housing and seeds and tools and provisions\r\nin some form for most of a year’s sustenance. All the capital that\r\nconstructs a great thoroughfare is used in getting ready to satisfy wants\r\nin many future years. Capital furnishes subsistence for laborers of every\r\nkind during those years of waiting for a product. This is true capital,\r\nbecause the object of its use is a greater product of wealth; but the\r\nproduct may be long delayed. So all accumulated wealth in every form\r\nrepresents sustained labor during the past. Professor Taussig estimates\r\nthe accumulation of subsistence in all existing goods at five years of\r\nlabor for the community. The total value of farms in our country is just\r\nabout five times the average annual product of the farms, though a large\r\nportion of the land is unused.\r\n\r\n_Capital circulating or fixed._—A further distinction is desirable between\r\ncapital in food, fuel or stock in trade, which may be turned at a single\r\nuse into new wealth, and capital in buildings, bridges, roads and farms,\r\nwhich may be used many times in adding new wealth before they entirely\r\ndisappear or give place to new forms of capital. The first is called\r\ncirculating capital, and the last fixed capital.\r\n\r\nThe degree of permanence in fixed capital is indefinite of course—even\r\ndrains vary in permanence—and the line between the two is not always\r\neasily drawn, yet the distinction is real. Most men distinguish “the\r\nplant” in any enterprise from “the current supplies,” and realize that\r\nsome fit proportion exists between them. A farm well equipped can not be\r\nhandled to advantage without a proportional investment in current\r\nsupplies. Many a renter cannot pay his rent for want of means to work his\r\nfarm profitably. If the farm were given him, he would still be hampered by\r\nthe same lack of consumable goods to turn at once into larger products.\r\nMany a “land poor” farmer would gain at once by exchange of acres for more\r\n“current supplies” for his farming, such as food for help, feed for teams\r\nand stock, seed or fertilizers for his crops, or young stock to consume\r\nthe raw product of his fields. In the fourteenth century the stock of\r\nEuropean farms was worth three times the value of the farms. Similar\r\nconditions are found now in some newer portions of the United States. It\r\nis impossible to estimate exactly the existing ratio between fixed and\r\ncirculating capital from statistics at hand. Farmers in older, more\r\ndeveloped regions can use, without suffering, a larger per cent of fixed\r\ncapital than pioneers can, because the circulation is more rapid. For the\r\nsame reason the raising of staple annual crops gives place to double\r\ncropping, dairying and full feeding as land grows more valuable, frequent\r\nreturns serving instead of large circulating capital.\r\n\r\nIn general, the wealth of a community is better judged by its fixed\r\ncapital, while its thrift is known from its circulating capital. Fixed\r\ncapital is always secured by consumption of circulating capital. The\r\nextension of railroads always implies great reduction of ready supplies.\r\nMoney _between_ individuals and communities ranks as circulating capital,\r\nbut _within_ any community the stock of money needed for domestic trade\r\nmay be thought of as a permanent machine. Even machinery may be\r\ncirculating capital in the hands of one who manufactures or sells it,\r\nthough fixed when located in its work, and for the whole community is\r\n“fixed” as soon as its destined use is determined by its form. Thus the\r\ndistinction, though real, is flexible. Its importance in discussing the\r\nindustries of a country, or in understanding the relations of various\r\nindustries to each other and to the world, will appear later in the book.\r\n\r\n_Capital unproductive._—Capital is sometimes said to be unproductive in\r\ncontrast with _productive_, although the very nature of capital requires\r\nproductiveness. The occasion for this distinction is in the fact that\r\nmeans devoted to future production of wealth in a particular way may be\r\nyears in returning the product; the destination is evident and the return\r\nconfidently expected, yet the owner is without income or near prospect of\r\nincome. Such ventures are seen in the reclaiming of waste lands by\r\ndrainage, the equipment of extensive mines, and the construction of dykes\r\nand levees. Land held for sale or use in the indefinite future is a most\r\ncommon illustration of unproductive capital.\r\n\r\nIf wealth in some readily exchangeable form is intended for productive\r\nuse, but is held for a satisfactory opportunity, it is sometimes called\r\nfree or _floating capital_. It may be available for any temporary use, and\r\nso afloat among a variety of investments. Some great enterprises, like the\r\nbuilding of the Suez canal, are begun in view of attracting floating\r\ncapital. Borrowers generally look to such accumulations for their supply\r\nof funds.\r\n\r\n_Capital in farming._—A clear view of the uses of capital may be gained\r\nfrom estimating the needs of a young farmer just starting out for himself.\r\nFor all his equipments he must depend upon the time and effort of somebody\r\nembodied in form of tools, material and sustenance, for capital in any\r\nform is simply this. A farm of 160 acres improved, or already out of the\r\ncrude pioneer stage, represents about ten years of one man’s time, say\r\n$3,000. A house suitably furnished for himself and his young wife means\r\nthree years of time, $1,000. His barns and corrals and intersecting fences\r\ncost two years of time, $600. His team and stock and the necessary tools\r\nmake nearly three years of time again, $900. Seed, feed, provisions,\r\nclothing, insurance and wages for help, all to be used before his first\r\nyear’s crop is sold, require at least $500 worth of time, or nearly two\r\nyears more. The needed capital for such a farm thus represents full\r\neighteen years of the time of an able-bodied man, or $6,000. If we add to\r\nthis the cost of bringing to mature age and intelligence the three able\r\nand efficient workers needed to manage and work that farm, we shall credit\r\nthe past, without counting the time and energy of the young people\r\nthemselves in growing and learning and gaining their skill, with thirty\r\nyears of labor; $10,000, put into the farm and its occupants as they stand\r\nready for a year’s work. This accumulation is likely to show all the forms\r\nof capital described.\r\n\r\n_Capital conservative._—Capital, especially in fixed forms, being in its\r\nnature the conserving of energy, is necessarily an incentive to\r\nconservatism in society, since any great and sudden changes in the habits\r\nof a community involve rapid consumption or destruction of capital.\r\nCapital is said to be “timid.” This statement means simply that all owners\r\nand users of capital who realize the time required for accumulating it\r\nhesitate to risk its destruction in doubtful enterprises, uncertain\r\nconfidence or venturesome experiments in government or financiering. War,\r\nriots, or even revenue laws, may destroy fixed capital that has been the\r\ngrowth of a century. A small change in tariff laws has rendered useless\r\nimmense factories. For the same reason farmers, having so large a fixed\r\ncapital in farms and farm machinery, do not take kindly to political\r\nchanges involving doubtful consequences. States where the capital is still\r\ncirculating may readily venture upon experiments financial or political,\r\nsince little time is lost even in destructive results. People in new\r\ncountries take risks readily because they have less to risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. Personal Attainments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Accumulated energies._—The force accumulated through personal effort in\r\ntraining, education and discipline is similar to capital in the fact that\r\nit represents a period of time between the effort and its full\r\naccomplishment, and that it is devoted to production of wealth. It differs\r\nfrom capital in being immaterial human energy, exceedingly useful in\r\ncombination with capital, but a part of the laborer, not his tools. It is\r\ngained by devoting time, attention, thought and practice to acquiring\r\nmethods of greatest efficiency in any act of labor. It requires surplus\r\nenergy in labor at any task to gain, not only the material result, but\r\npower to do the same task better and more easily next time. All the time\r\nexpended in acquiring such powers is put into the value of what is finally\r\nproduced. Any peculiar tact or ability developed becomes an essential part\r\nof individual powers, and its product, like that of any form of exertion,\r\nbecomes the property of the individual.\r\n\r\nIn this way, not only is the cost of gaining skill or education, or of\r\nestablishing habits, returned in the product, but often a considerable\r\nincrement, or gain, from the larger demand for such abilities. A skilled\r\nartisan’s labor meets more urgent demands for its use.\r\n\r\n_Skill._—If this extra exertion takes the form of training muscles, nerves\r\nand brain to act with speed and accuracy as judgment directs, we call the\r\nattainment _skill_. Even if the action required is simple, dexterity comes\r\nonly by practice, and in special cases may multiply the product many\r\ntimes. Two men may shear sheep with equal accuracy, but one has three\r\ntimes the speed of the other. His skill secures employment at three times\r\nthe wages of the other, with profit to the employer, because the extra\r\nspeed saves room, attendance and risk over employing three men at\r\none-third the rate. The shearer profits by the rarity of his skill in\r\ngetting the wages of three men, with the support of but one, and in more\r\nconstant employment. When the operation is more complex, and success\r\ninvolves larger interests, skill counts indefinitely more, and as society\r\ngrows complex the room for exercise of skill becomes larger and more\r\nvaried. The wide difference between pioneer farming and market-gardening\r\nillustrates this. The history of agriculture shows the slow development of\r\nskill in the furrow, the ditch and hedge, and in the handling and breeding\r\nof stock. Farmers once barely scratched an acre a day with their rude plow\r\nand were long in learning the use of a harrow. No attempt, according to\r\nProfessor Rogers, to improve the breeds of cattle and sheep appeared\r\nbefore the eighteenth century in England. Most early improvements in\r\nfarming skill came from the industrious monks, whose intelligence fostered\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nThe advantage given by skill perpetuates skill from generation to\r\ngeneration through aptitude and superior training, and so the people of a\r\nneighborhood or a country may inherit such power in contrast with other\r\nregions. “Yankee ingenuity” has become proverbial through such natural\r\nextension.\r\n\r\n_Discipline._—Education serves the same purpose by acquisition of\r\nknowledge in such ways as to give wisdom in its application. It involves\r\nan exercise of intelligence to the establishing of sound judgment. Broader\r\nthan skill in its range, it increases the possibilities of skill as\r\nstorage of power. The skill of the surgeon would never have existed but\r\nfor the brightening of his intelligence by education. The electrician’s\r\ntraining depends upon a broad foundation of education in knowledge of the\r\nmatters he handles so dextrously. In farming, this source of stored up\r\npower has until very recently been ignored. While men in many professions\r\nwere multiplying their individual power by spending youth in school, the\r\nfarm boy would be simply trained at the plow, without the enlargement of\r\npractice in thinking required elsewhere. Such education has become at\r\nlength, like skill, a requisite of each generation in order that our\r\ncivilization may be maintained. For this the states build and the nation\r\nsustains agricultural colleges.\r\n\r\n_Character._—Just as important, though often overlooked in enumerating\r\neconomic forces, is the acquired personal habit of self-control. Without\r\nit both skill and education avail but little, and it may do its work\r\nindependently of both. “Tried and trusted” expresses our estimate of the\r\nimportance of long practice of virtue in meeting obstacles. The formation\r\nof habits—personal, business and moral,—is a matter of time and\r\ndiscipline. It costs exertion through a series of years; but the power\r\naccumulated may be needed only once, in some great emergency.\r\n\r\nThe character of the workman, the tradesman and the farmer enters more or\r\nless into the product of his toil and gives it value. Though I may not\r\ncare from whence come the shoes I wear, or the butter I eat, I do care for\r\nthe genuineness of both, for which I must depend upon the genuine\r\ncharacter of the makers and sellers of both. This, too, is maintained from\r\ngeneration to generation by its successful use in acquiring both power and\r\nwealth. It cannot be had without the expenditure of time, energy and means\r\nof the fathers and mothers of one age upon their successors.\r\n\r\n_Importance of attainments._—All these personal attainments, whether\r\nconfined to individuals or extended over whole communities, must be\r\nreckoned among producing powers and reckoned with in estimate of earnings.\r\nA community deficient in either is low in ability to supply its own wants\r\nor the world’s wants, and no amount of material capital can take their\r\nplace. They are superior to capital in being less destructible by fire or\r\nflood, and more easily turned to account in new enterprises as needed. No\r\ncapital is perpetual, even in most fixed forms, nor is any personal\r\nattainment sure to remain of direct use; but the latter has a larger\r\nexpectation of usefulness and greater permanence in the economy of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. Combination Of Forces For Individual Efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ideal manliness._—Every community has highest efficiency and best\r\ncivilization when each individual member has the largest range of\r\nabilities to meet wants, and the largest range of wants to be met. An\r\nideal civilization involves the distinct aim of gaining for each mature\r\nperson in any association the fullest development of all abilities and all\r\nmaterials and tools for their use. This is amply illustrated in a family\r\nof well grown, well trained, well educated, trustworthy men and women with\r\nsufficient capital under control to maintain the highest activity of every\r\npersonal power and attainment. Childhood and old age must always be\r\nprovided for by exertions of those whose abilities are in their prime, and\r\naccidental weakness of every kind is met from the same strength.\r\n\r\nAny mature person is best equipped for productive industry when, sound in\r\nboth body and mind, he has the accumulated energy of the past for his use\r\nin the shape of capital and hereditary traits, together with skill,\r\neducation and established character. Such a man is recognized at once to\r\nhave his place among “the heirs of all the ages in the foremost files of\r\ntime.” Any people claiming leadership among nations must depend upon its\r\nrepresentatives of such a fully equipped body of men for that leadership.\r\n\r\n_From savage to enlightened._—The increasing importance of such full\r\nmanliness, as society becomes more complex in both wants and efforts, is\r\neasily seen. In ruder life muscular energy and endurance, with some slight\r\ningenuity, are sufficient to meet the ruder needs, with some chance of\r\nsaving for future wants of a growing family, which will continue the same\r\nround of muscular contest with savage conditions.\r\n\r\nThe American Indians have given the fairest exhibition of the kind of\r\nwelfare which such exertion and accumulation afford. The weak disappear\r\nquickly, because the strong have too little surplus of energy to care for\r\nthem. Among those left, both burdens and means of satisfaction are quite\r\nequally distributed, because of essentially equal powers of exertion. But\r\nin older and more civilized communities large portions of the people are\r\ndependent upon the rest for knowledge, ingenuity and skill to keep the\r\nvery much larger supply of material needed for maintaining the\r\ncivilization. At this stage of progress a man with only muscular\r\ndevelopment finds himself entirely dependent upon some one else for the\r\nplans by which all must live. A savage cannot share equally with the wise\r\nman either in the burden of caring for the community or in the welfare\r\nwhich the community enjoys.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that the relative importance of accumulated wealth in\r\nthe shape of capital or of skill or of the character which results from\r\ngenerations of training, becomes more and more distinct as the community\r\nbecomes more developed. Any man, then, who is lacking capital, skill and\r\nmorals, or all three, is in some respects like the savage, and will find\r\nhis equals among the savages. For this reason a pioneer country affords\r\nopportunity for a youth without skill or personal attainments of any kind\r\n“to grow up with the country;” and the famous advice, “Go west, young man,\r\ngo west,” applies strictly to such a youth, and with less and less\r\ndirectness in proportion as the young man has control of himself and of\r\naccumulated wealth.\r\n\r\nA simple diagram (Chart III) may illustrate the progress of civilization\r\nfrom the general poverty and inefficiency of rude pioneer life to the\r\npower of a thoroughly organized and developed community. The poor man, in\r\nthe sense of one whose abilities are undeveloped and who has no visible\r\nmeans of support, is relatively less able to care for himself in the\r\nenlightened community than in the ruder pioneer life. In this sense, and\r\nthis alone, the poor man grows poorer with advancing civilization. This\r\nmay easily be seen by comparing a thrifty farming community of today and\r\nall the accumulated stock, machinery and tools of the farms, with the same\r\ncommunity sixty years earlier, when all was practically wilderness. A\r\nstrong man with an ax and a hoe could enter the wilderness anywhere and\r\nlive nearly as well as any of his neighbors. Such a man in the higher\r\ncountry life of our times must work for some one else at wages, or must be\r\nsupported at public expense. In either case he feels his poverty. At the\r\nsame time, the extreme of suffering is less likely to be reached in the\r\nricher community. The poorest man has comforts of which the pioneers never\r\ndreamed. Even a tramp can live on the fat of the land, but not by his own\r\nexertions. The failure of a crop in the pioneer country means starvation\r\nfor a large portion of the few inhabitants. A failure in the older\r\ncommunity means suffering for a few in diminished food and clothing, but\r\nall live on the accumulations of the past.\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\n Chart III. Illustrating the relative importance of labor and saving, in\r\n    the progress of civilization from its beginnings in pioneer life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Developing civilization._—This essential advantage of accumulating power\r\nin individuals, as civilization advances, is necessarily connected with\r\nthe very nature of civilization and growth. As no conceivable device can\r\nmake a babe as efficient as a man, so no contrivance, political or social,\r\ncan make an undeveloped man equal to a fully developed one.\r\n\r\nThe intense community of interests in high civilization makes even more\r\nimportant the individual abilities of each sharer in those interests. For\r\nthis reason every device for universal education, development of skill and\r\nstrengthening of character, and every check upon deterioration of personal\r\nstrength or wisdom or virtue is to be considered. Any neglect of the\r\nindividual in his development of personal attainments retards the\r\ndevelopment of the community. Any device for the equal distribution of\r\nwealth which does not increase individual thrift in the use of wealth at\r\nleast retards the growth of the community, and may very quickly reduce the\r\npower of the community as a whole until it reaches the inefficiency of\r\nsavage life.\r\n\r\nAll true charity, even equity, requires that the object of distribution of\r\nwealth shall be the greater efficiency of each individual. If there shall\r\never be a community of individuals gaining equal enjoyment, it will be\r\nmade up of those possessing essential equality in personal powers and\r\nattainments, and in accumulated capital as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. Methods Of Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Simple association._—While the absolute equality of individuals referred\r\nto in the preceding chapter is practically impossible, the community of\r\ninterests as civilization advances becomes much closer through various\r\nplans of association of individuals in common work. Indeed, the community\r\nis a community because a multitude of individuals work together. The\r\nsimplest form of association is seen where men work in gangs, all acting\r\nalike, as in lifting a log or a rock, hoeing the field, or in building an\r\nembankment by shoveling. Among farmers the habit of exchanging work, so\r\ncommon in pioneer settlements, illustrates the advantage of combination.\r\nThis may be called simple association, by which many hands make light\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n_Complex association._—A more complex association is found in even the\r\nrudest settlement when one man undertakes a particular kind of labor for\r\nall his neighbors, they in turn doing a different kind of work for him. A\r\nfarmer in a new settlement found the children of himself and neighbors\r\nwithout a school, and agreed for several winters to teach a school as many\r\ndays as his neighbors would chop in his clearing. This association cleared\r\nthe land and supplied the school. Such exchanges of labor develop rapidly\r\nin every growing community and form the basis of a most extensive\r\ncommerce. When “Adam delved and Eve span” the family was far better\r\nprovided for than if both had undertaken to delve and spin. The fair\r\nexchange of products makes each man’s product more useful to both himself\r\nand his neighborhood. Such association is less noticeable in a community\r\nof farmers, where all are seeking essentially the same products, than in\r\nalmost any other community. Yet the presence of the blacksmith, the\r\nshoemaker, the wagonmaker and the tailor contribute very largely to the\r\ncomfort of all concerned.\r\n\r\nOne chief disadvantage of farms remote from villages is the want of ready\r\nexchange, or association by different employments. The part which such\r\nexchange plays in the accumulation and distribution of the wealth of the\r\nworld is so great that several chapters will be needed to present its\r\nimportance. The study of exchanges is sometimes thought to cover the whole\r\nquestion of wealth. It is often treated as separate from production. But\r\nits advantages and disadvantages are most easily seen by considering all\r\nits bearings upon the increased product of a multitude of workers.\r\n\r\n_Compound association._—A still closer association, sometimes called\r\ncompound association, is found where several workers combine efforts of\r\ndifferent kinds in a single finished product. It is easily illustrated in\r\nan ordinary dairy, where one of the family drives up the cows, another\r\ndoes the milking, another sets the milk and cares for the purity of all\r\nutensils, another perhaps skims the milk and churns the butter, and still\r\nanother works and packs it. All this labor of many hands has its\r\nimportance represented in the butter packed for use. The particular\r\nadvantages of this division of labor will be treated in a future chapter.\r\n\r\n_Aggregation of forces._—A still further advance in association appears\r\nwhen many laborers in many ways, with multitudes of tools and machinery,\r\nare combined in a huge establishment in such a way as to employ all\r\nefficiently. This is illustrated in the so-called bonanza farms of the\r\nwest, but more distinctly appears in the great manufactories, or in any\r\nextensive coöperation or great enterprise. A study of these will also\r\nrequire a future chapter.\r\n\r\nWhile all these methods of association blend with and into each other in\r\nevery kind of community, a careful analysis of each is necessary to a full\r\nunderstanding of their relation to welfare. For this reason it is best to\r\nanalyze and illustrate each by itself. The succeeding chapters will take\r\nup all the intricacies of exchange before presenting the special\r\nadvantages and disadvantages of technical division of labor and of great\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. Exchange: Advantages, Limitations And Tendencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exchange in production._—The immense importance of exchange in promoting\r\nthe welfare of communities is easily granted, and is illustrated in every\r\nvillage store or even in every simple farming community. Today the market\r\nfor farm products is easily felt to be the most important consideration,\r\nand weighs in every farmer’s mind when buying or selling his farm. When a\r\nstate like Kansas raises from six to ten times as much wheat as its people\r\ncan use, exchange is evidently an essential factor in every farmer’s\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nThe multitude of everyday wants in most households supplied only through\r\ncommerce shows the extent and importance of this exchange of labor\r\nthroughout the world. The great advantages, however; may be seen by a\r\nlittle more careful analysis of the growth of individual powers under a\r\nready system of exchange. Every laborer becomes effective by experience in\r\nsome particular industry. A thousand years will not perfect a single\r\nworker in any of the thousands of employments needed to supply his wants.\r\nEvery farmer knows the weakness of a beginner in farming, coming from any\r\nother business; and without exchange, every workman must always be a\r\nbeginner in everything. Exchange is one of the chief motives to\r\naccumulation, since others’ wants as well as our own are kept in view. The\r\n“hand to mouth” liver is almost always a man of all work, thinking little\r\nof exchange. It is especially a stimulant to saving, since it makes\r\ncapital itself more useful and brings it directly into competition with\r\nall other forces. Products stored in the granary have their significance\r\nbecause of exchange.\r\n\r\nStill more important is the cultivation of special abilities, impossible\r\nwithout exchange. The indefinitely varied powers of human nature are made\r\nmost useful where each can devote his talent to a definite business; and\r\nusually the talent best fitted to a business is attracted toward it.\r\nHabits, too, which are the chief labor-saving characteristics in human\r\nnature; become all-important, and enable an individual to do a large part\r\nof his work with the least possible care. The routine of everyday life is\r\nfollowed with little effort or pain. The more regular the routine the\r\neasier it is to follow.\r\n\r\nA still greater advantage to communities is found in the enlargement of\r\nthe range of wants in all individuals. The superiority of enlightened men\r\nover savages is largely due to their greatly increased needs, since\r\nnecessity, the mother of invention, compels exertion and finds the way to\r\nsatisfaction. It seems, however, that exchange contributes most\r\nextensively to welfare by combining individuals into a community, and\r\nsmaller communities into a larger, until the whole world is brought into\r\nsympathy. Thus every human being gains the advantage of growth in mind and\r\ncharacter through some contact with every other human being within the\r\ncommercial world. If ever a reign of peace and plenty shall extend over\r\nthe world, no one doubts the importance of commerce and intimate exchange\r\nin bringing that time. The full advantage of free exchange in promoting\r\nhuman welfare cannot be over-estimated.\r\n\r\n_Exchange limited by powers._—With all its advantages, there are certain\r\nobstacles in the way of its extension, always more or less effective in\r\nlimiting its range. A community can have few exchanges among individuals\r\nif all are busied in the same or similar trades. A farming community has\r\nlittle need of buying and selling among the farmers. A horse trade or an\r\nexchange of one brute for another may supply all necessities. In larger\r\ncommunities similar limitations are found where abilities are similar, or\r\nwhere habits in education, government or religion are very uniform. In\r\nsuch cases opportunities for exchange are limited, and commerce itself\r\ngrows slowly.\r\n\r\nThe story of pioneer settlements is uniformly one of slow and uncertain\r\ncommerce for want of the variety in wants and abilities which makes the\r\nvery foundation of exchange. Sometimes “day’s work for day’s work” is the\r\nlimit of exchange throughout a whole region or country. In the world at\r\nlarge limitations often arise from hostile feelings between nations, and\r\nas yet the highest freedom of exchange between people under different\r\ngovernments has seldom been reached. The United States affords the\r\nbrightest example of people with varied characteristics developed through\r\nthe stimulating effect of ready exchange.\r\n\r\n_Commerce over-estimated._—So rapid has been the advancement of systems of\r\nexchange within the last half century that men are prone to over-estimate\r\nthe importance of commerce and its interests. The amount of wealth in\r\nmotion exaggerates the importance of wealth itself, so that multitudes\r\noverlook the foundation in productive industry, and become mere bettors\r\nupon the market, attempting to catch a part of the moving wealth as it\r\npasses. Any speculation in mere commercial transactions may become a very\r\nserious obstacle to legitimate industry by its effect upon both the\r\nindustry itself and the incentives to industry among the people. This\r\ndanger is increased by the greatly extended interest in exchange among the\r\nrural population.\r\n\r\nScarcely a farmer in our country is beyond the effect of any extensive\r\ncommerce throughout the world. The crops of South America and of the\r\nRussian plains are now as important to a farmer of Dakota as his own,\r\nsince all must find a common market in the manufacturing countries of\r\nEurope. Speculation on the Chicago Board of Trade is likely to be as\r\ninteresting to a farmer in Nebraska as to members of the Board. He is even\r\ntempted to try his hand at speculation, either directly through a\r\ncommission house or indirectly through the marketing of his grain. In\r\neither case he is caught by the dangerous motion of modern commerce. The\r\nchief remedy for these tendencies must be found in a wider acquaintance\r\nwith the facts of commercial life and a clearer perception of what is\r\ngenuine commerce.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer needs to distinguish, and distinguish carefully, the actual,\r\nnecessary machinery of trade and the principles underlying it, that he may\r\nappreciate the genuine and oppose the false. On this account several\r\nchapters are given to questions of exchange, with an effort to bring into\r\nmore prominent light the ways in which all commerce affects the farmer’s\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. Value The Basis Of Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The nature of value._—Perhaps no question in the discussion of wealth is\r\nof greater importance than the nature of value. Certainly the measurement\r\nof value in all our property is the basis of all exchanges, of all book\r\naccounts, and of all inventories. The worth of any piece of property in\r\nsuch estimates always involves some comparison, either of things possessed\r\nor of exertion required or of satisfaction yielded. In comparing an apple\r\nand a peach, both equally attainable, we may value the peach most highly\r\nbecause it gratifies desires in higher degree. Thinking of future uses, we\r\nmay value the apple more highly because it will keep longer, and so be\r\navailable for future wants. In considering all the kinds of satisfaction\r\nto be provided for, we may think of the peach as desired by more people\r\nwho are likely to render us service, and therefore more readily\r\nexchangeable, and so of higher value. Again, the peach may be at the top\r\nof the tree and the apple within reach, in which case we may think whether\r\nthe peach will give enough greater satisfaction to make it worth the\r\ngreater exertion to get it. In this way a single individual, who has wants\r\nto be gratified only by exertion, forms an idea of value as founded upon\r\nsome relation between his wants and his powers, between the desires to be\r\ngratified and the qualities of the object expected to give satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSince wealth always implies an accumulated store of good things, every one\r\ncomes to think of the worth of his accumulation as estimated by what it\r\nwill do at any time, in any place, in satisfying any need. So, most\r\nnaturally, we associate our ideas of value with trade. An exchange of\r\nhorses brings in not only the present qualities of each horse for present\r\nservice, but all the qualities and circumstances affecting the\r\npossibilities of disposing of the horse whenever something else is needed\r\nmore. An expert judge of horses not only knows when the horse is sound in\r\nwind and limb, and what are the signs of docility, speed, etc., but also\r\nwhat the rest of the world considers the qualities of a satisfactory\r\nhorse. In all experience peculiar circumstances, varying the relation\r\nbetween wants and satisfaction, affect immensely our estimate of value.\r\nWhen an ancient king shouted, “My kingdom for a horse!” he was doubtless\r\nmoved by the uselessness of a kingdom to one about to lose his life in\r\nbattle for want of a horse and also by the difficulty at that particular\r\nmoment of gaining a horse.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary experience everybody estimates value by some comparison with\r\nwhat he can obtain in exchange. A picture of a friend may be priceless in\r\ntwo senses: first, of so great importance to its owner that nothing can\r\nbuy it; second, of so little importance to anybody else that nobody will\r\ngive anything for it. In any inventory of wealth the picture could not be\r\ncounted; it is valueless. But in any judgment of personal welfare it may\r\nbe beyond price. So, in the universal experience, the term value has come\r\nto be used as essentially connected with exchanges and with property as\r\nstored to meet all kinds of wants.\r\n\r\n_Value in services._—In a similar way experience has developed the idea of\r\nvalue with reference to services. A service may be invaluable, as when a\r\nphysician saves the life of his patient, but the value of that service is\r\nestimated by the return expected in the community where the physician and\r\nhis patient live. Many services of highest usefulness and most important\r\nin welfare cannot be valued in terms of wealth, because no wealth can\r\nsecure them. Love and patriotism and philanthropy cannot be had for\r\nwealth. But in comparison of two services rendered for hire, both are\r\nmeasured by their general utility, either directly or indirectly, and even\r\nthis estimate is modified by the readiness with which either service can\r\nbe secured. One who seeks the service of an artist who stands alone among\r\nten thousand people, may be willing to give the services of a thousand\r\nother men, which can be had for a trifle, because they are everywhere\r\nabounding.\r\n\r\n_Essentials of value._—Experience seems, therefore, to settle upon three\r\nconditions for value in any article of wealth or any service rendered.\r\nFirst, the article or service must have utility—that is, it must be useful\r\nin satisfying somebody’s wants, either present or future. Second, those\r\nwants must be of such a nature that effort on the part of some human being\r\nwill be necessary to gratify them. Nothing which can be had at all times\r\nby mere desire of it can have value. Third, the object must be of such a\r\nnature as to command other services or exchange of other wealth. For this\r\nreason it must be transferable from one owner to another.\r\n\r\n_Utility as related to value._—While utility is a basis of all values, it\r\nis not the chief element in measuring the value of wealth. The things of\r\nhighest utility, like air and water, have no value as long as trifling\r\nexertion will bring them. Even land is without appreciable value so long\r\nas any person can obtain it by settling upon it.\r\n\r\nIn general, we measure utility by the relation between the nature of any\r\nobject and human nature as expressed in wants. A bushel of wheat has\r\nutility equal to the number of loaves of bread it will furnish to hungry\r\nhumanity. In this respect every bushel may have the same utility as every\r\nother. This would be true if every bushel of wheat was wanted by hungry\r\npeople able to exert themselves in securing it; but if five bushels of\r\nwheat are sufficient for each human being in a year’s supply of bread, a\r\ndistribution to all the world of more than five bushels to each would make\r\nsome of the wheat useless. So if the world’s product of wheat more than\r\nsupplies the world’s want, the extra amount will be without utility unless\r\nsome means of storing against future want is devised. In that case the\r\nutility of the stored portion will be lessened by the extra exertion\r\nrequired to store it until the need comes. One may be glad to pay\r\ntwenty-five cents for a good dinner, but an equally good dinner offered\r\nimmediately afterwards will have no utility, unless he can save it for\r\nsupper. If the dinners offered are so many as to imply that several will\r\nbe useless, the value of each is likely to be affected by this estimate of\r\nlost utility in some. Dinners in that case are liable to be furnished for\r\nwhat they are worth for cold suppers.\r\n\r\nIf any article of commerce, like wheat, has its highest utility in one way\r\nof meeting wants, as in bread, that utility will have a strong influence\r\nupon value as long as the supply of wheat is not too great for this want.\r\nIf the supply of wheat should be so great that only a small portion could\r\nbe used for bread, other utilities would be sought. It would be used for\r\nfeeding hens, and perhaps for cattle feed. If still the amount is too\r\ngreat to be consumed, it might be used for starch. In this case the least\r\nuseful portion is likely to furnish the estimate of value for the whole.\r\nBoth the raiser of wheat and the user will consider the lowest use as the\r\nprobable basis for sale.\r\n\r\nBefore the opening of the Erie canal a farmer in northern Ohio drew a load\r\nof wheat twelve miles in hope of a market. The dealer said: “It isn’t\r\nworth anything, since nobody has any use for it. If you had a load of\r\nsand, I could pay you for that, to fill the mud-hole in front of my\r\nstore.” Since the utility of some wheat was nothing, the value of all\r\nwheat tended to nothing. On the other hand, if wheat is scarce in the\r\ncommunity, it will be used only to meet the wants of the delicate or the\r\nfastidious, whose comfort and life may depend upon it. In that case its\r\ngeneral value will be estimated by its higher utility, whatever other use\r\nit is put to. That is called a final utility, which, in any particular\r\ncase, is the lowest use implied in consuming the supply. And this final\r\nutility is the only one influencing the estimate of value.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, therefore, that the total utility of anything, like a\r\npaper of tacks, for instance, may be greatly increased, since it has\r\nindefinitely more uses than when tacks were first made. Yet the supply of\r\ntacks is so enormous that to consume them we must use them for trifling\r\npurposes; and therefore their value is a trifle. When we have water to\r\nthrow away, its value is nothing. When water is limited to culinary uses,\r\nits value is considerable. When water is sufficient only to slake extreme\r\nthirst, its value is beyond price. Even the prospect of a future supply\r\ndiminishes the utility of any commodity, since time is an important\r\nelement in satisfaction. Thus a store of potatoes in early spring, however\r\nwell preserved, has its final utility lowered, and therefore its value\r\nlessened, by the prospect of new potatoes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the present value of a field of grain or the young\r\norchard is dependent upon its utility in meeting a future want. Everything\r\nwhich enhances prospective utility of any article enhances its value; and\r\neverything which diminishes the chance of such utility, like bad weather,\r\ninsects or plant diseases, diminishes the present value. In this way risk\r\ndiminishes the value of wealth subject to it and increases the value of\r\nwealth which has passed by it.\r\n\r\nIn general, the usefulness of anything is no criterion for measuring\r\nvalue, because other elements of value are more important. Henry C. Carey\r\nsays, “Utility is the measure of man’s power over nature; value is the\r\nmeasure of nature’s power over man.” This may be a striking way of saying\r\nthat great utility implies a discovery of uses, while great value often\r\nindicates only difficulty in securing what has great usefulness.\r\n\r\n_Exertion as related to value._—Since utility, however essential to value,\r\nis not its measure, we are led to consider whether the exertion required\r\nto obtain any article desired may not measure its worth. This is certainly\r\na matter of prime consideration, and many have been led to suppose the\r\ncost of production, by which is meant all the exertion necessary to bring\r\nany commodity to its final consumer, to be the sole and absolute measure\r\nof value.\r\n\r\nThis supposition, if ever correct, is subject to great modifications. None\r\nknow better than farmers that a bushel of wheat from one field may have\r\ncost twice as much as a bushel from another field, without any possible\r\ndistinction in value. Every mechanic knows that what he has accomplished\r\nwith great exertion may have been duplicated by some labor-saving device\r\nwith half the exertion, the two values being essentially equal. Nothing is\r\nmore common than to find articles in the market sold without regard to\r\ncost because they are superseded by more desirable articles. Indeed, the\r\nmost ardent defender of cost as the sole basis of value is obliged to\r\nnotice multitudes of exceptions to the rule. Yet it must be granted that\r\nonly those articles involving effort in securing them have value at all,\r\nand in general the amount of effort actually put forth has some relation\r\nto our estimate of value.\r\n\r\nIn general, men do not exert themselves more than necessary to meet wants,\r\nand in any exchange with others estimate the value of what they have\r\nproduced by the exertion expended. Yet, as products of the same kind\r\nexchange in the same market without regard to their individual cost, it is\r\nevident that some other principle must be discovered. Nevertheless, no\r\nfarmer will continue indefinitely the raising of a crop which brings in\r\nthe market less than a fair average return for his labor in raising it. In\r\na series of years he expects his wheat to return a fair compensation for\r\nlabor expended. In the same way every manufacturer expects a full return\r\nfor all cost of all his efforts, and would not continue his work from year\r\nto year without such expectation. Moreover, when for any reason the market\r\nvalue of anything is much above its cost, somebody is ready to increase\r\nthe supply of that particular article, and more will add their efforts in\r\nthe same direction until its value approaches nearly the general cost of\r\nproduction as compared with the cost of other products selling in the same\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n_Normal value._—In this way the cost of production is said to fix the\r\nnormal value of any article of commerce capable of production in\r\nindefinite quantity and within limited time. For this reason farmers are\r\ninterested in finding the average cost of production of wheat, corn, etc.,\r\nwithin a region supplying their market. They are even interested in\r\nknowing the conditions for wheat raising in India, South Africa and\r\nAustralia, since the cost of production there may influence the value of\r\nwheat throughout the world. The normal value of products capable of\r\nindefinite multiplication tends always toward the value of the least\r\ncostly. This is shown in the effect of labor-saving machinery upon the\r\nvalue of cloths and other goods. It is equally true in agriculture that\r\nwheat raising upon cheap land with extensive use of machinery and\r\neconomical methods of culture and harvesting brings down the normal value.\r\nSo long as more land can be applied to wheat raising with these\r\nadvantages, the less productive methods may be too costly for the market.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if any production cannot be largely extended so that\r\nthe supply in market barely meets the requirements of purchasers, the\r\ntendency of normal values is toward the cost of the most costly part of\r\nthe product required to meet wants. This is because the supply is kept up\r\nonly by the exertion of the greater amount of labor as well as the less.\r\nIf farmers in western prairie country can raise corn at an expense of 15\r\ncents per bushel, as they can upon an average, so long as that region can\r\nraise all the corn required no less productive region can force the normal\r\nprice above what will keep western farmers raising corn. When the western\r\ncrop fails, the price is far above normal value, and may even go above the\r\ncost of the most costly corn in market, under a principle called the law\r\nof supply and demand.\r\n\r\nSince improvements in method so constantly lessen the normal value of\r\nproducts, Mr. Carey made the effort to measure value by “cost of\r\nreproduction,” meaning, I suppose, that any article produced at any time\r\nand place is likely to bring in any market a price equal to the cost of\r\nsimilar articles produced under the most improved methods anywhere used in\r\nthe present. This, of course, does not apply to articles not desired in\r\nthe present, because deteriorated or out of fashion or less useful than\r\nsome new device for a similar use, but only to those articles of full\r\nutility in having all the qualities needed to meet the desire of\r\npurchasers. Even a diamond like the famous “Kohinoor” would have its\r\nalmost priceless value reduced to the cost of securing similar jewels\r\nequally desirable if a process of crystallizing carbon were suddenly\r\ndiscovered. It is easy to see, then, that cost measures value only so far\r\nas it is directly connected with the available supply in any market. Under\r\nordinary circumstances the supply cannot be increased unless the cost is\r\nmet, but the rule is modified by any peculiarity of season, or conditions\r\nof trade, or production by cheaper methods or cheaper labor, or by the\r\nchanging wants of a community. The application of all these influences may\r\nbe studied under the so-called law of supply and demand.\r\n\r\n_Supply and demand; markets._—The law of supply and demand is only a\r\nstatement of the general fact that market value tends to increase with\r\nincrease of demand and to decrease as the supply to meet the demand\r\nincreases. It must be understood that a market means a particular spot\r\nwhere buyers and sellers of any article of commerce meet at a particular\r\ntime. The supply is the amount offered for sale at a given price. The\r\ndemand is the amount buyers will purchase at the same price.\r\n\r\nThus, if on a certain day sellers offer in Chicago 10,000 hogs, with a\r\nwillingness to take $5 per cwt., they represent the supply. If on the same\r\nday in the same place buyers are willing to take 10,000 hogs at $5 per\r\ncwt., $5 will be the market price, and the supply and demand will be\r\nequal. If, however, only 5,000 hogs would be bought at $5 per cwt., 5,000\r\nhogs will be without buyers, and their owners will seek, by lowering the\r\nprice, to find buyers at $4.50 per cwt., if necessary. Since all the\r\nsellers will feel the same pressure, the tendency of market value will\r\nimmediately be downward. Buyers willing to pay $5 per cwt., finding many\r\nsellers, will expect a reduction in price, and the price will certainly go\r\ndown until the hogs purchased equal the entire supply. And that will not\r\nbe until the buyers are stimulated by reduction of price, so that as many\r\nhogs are wanted as there are for sale. If that point is reached at a price\r\nof $4.50 per cwt., the market value is found there. The limit of time\r\nwithin which this reduction takes place will depend upon the ability and\r\nwillingness of sellers to wait. If the product offered is perishable, or\r\ncostly in keeping on the market, the reduction will be speedy. Otherwise\r\nit may be held indefinitely with the hope of compelling buyers to come to\r\nthe higher prices, in which case it is practically taken out of the\r\nmarket. Only those commodities are practically in the market which are\r\nheld for sale at the market price. Only those buyers practically enter the\r\nmarket who are able and willing to give the market price.\r\n\r\n_The higgling of the market._—The process of reaching an agreement between\r\nbuyers and sellers is called the higgling of the market, and represents\r\nthe conflict between the wishes of sellers to get the most possible for\r\ntheir products, and the wishes of buyers to get the most possible for\r\ntheir money. In fact, both buyers and sellers have the same motive: to\r\nmake their own exertions go as far as possible in supplying their own\r\nwants. The fact that money enters into the transaction makes no difference\r\nwith the bargain. Two farmers trading horses have exactly the same desire:\r\nto get the full worth of the horse to be given. A genuine bargain usually\r\nbenefits both parties. Even in a horse trade each owner expects to be\r\nbenefited by the exchange; and only a jockey seeks that benefit in taking\r\nadvantage of his neighbor’s ignorance or inexperience.\r\n\r\nSo, in the general market, every seller gains what he desires more than\r\nwhat he possesses, and every buyer has exactly the same experience. Two\r\nfriends may exchange books if either would be benefited by the exchange.\r\nIn that case the one gaining the less valuable book gains the satisfaction\r\nof giving to his friend. Both are still profited, one by the larger value\r\nreceived, and the other by the pleasure of giving. In such an exchange no\r\nbasis of value is reached, but in any ordinary bargain the final\r\nadjustment will be as nearly as possibly upon the test of value in the\r\nmarket. Between one buyer and one seller, the bargain is likely to turn to\r\nthe advantage of the one who is quickest to discover the weakness of the\r\nother. If two persons are discussing the price of a house for which the\r\nseller wishes $1,000, but will sell for even $600, and for which the buyer\r\nhopes to give only $600, but will pay even $1,000, the seller will\r\ngradually lower his price, and the buyer gradually raise his offer until\r\none or the other discovers the working of his neighbor’s mind. These are\r\nthe natural conditions for sharp bargaining.\r\n\r\nIn the larger market the interests of a multitude of buyers and a\r\nmultitude of sellers have weight, and no shrewdness can prevent a\r\nsettlement upon such a price as comes nearest to satisfying all parties.\r\nThe so-called law of supply and demand is a brief statement of the fact\r\nthat sales cannot be made in open market above the mark where buyers and\r\nsellers agree, and that mark is essentially the price at which all who are\r\nwilling to buy at the price current are met by those who are willing to\r\nsell at the same current price. With reference, then, to all articles sold\r\nin open market, it is safe to say that the only test of value is the price\r\nwhich the public is willing to pay. So universal is the acceptance of this\r\nprinciple in practical affairs that everybody estimates the value of his\r\nproperty by the price at which it will sell. Any appraiser or assessor who\r\nshould adopt a different principle would be considered wholly\r\nuntrustworthy.\r\n\r\n_Freedom in markets._—In this higgling of the market it is absolutely\r\nnecessary that buyers and sellers have essential freedom of choice and\r\nfairly equal information. There may be conditions of law preventing free\r\ncompetition, as under the regulation of prices attempted in various\r\ncountries prior to the present century. In England, during nearly four\r\ncenturies, limits of prices for nearly every article of food and clothing\r\nwere named by law. Yet in every instance the conditions of the market were\r\nstronger than the laws, and the restriction upon free competition and free\r\ndiscussion of prices actually destroyed the open market. The conditions of\r\na bankrupt sale at auction reduce the competition to a struggle between\r\nbuyers. In this case a very slight collusion between the buyers may\r\ndestroy the market. This is frequently illustrated in the sale of real\r\nestate after foreclosure of mortgages. The unnatural conditions of auction\r\nat any price are so evident as to make common the secret employment of\r\nsham bidders, shrewd enough to push actual buyers as far as they will go\r\nwithout preventing the sale. Somewhat similar conditions may exist in a\r\ngreat cattle market, in which immense quantities of cattle are delivered\r\nby owners, while the number of buyers is few. The great packing houses\r\nhave the advantage of being almost the sole bidders for what must be sold\r\nat their price. These conditions, however, are not made by the packing\r\nhouses, but by the large supply subject to immediate sale. Such conditions\r\nare much more noticeable in the market for ripe berries, when a slight\r\nexcess of supply makes these perishable products of trifling value.\r\n\r\nConditions on the other extreme, from scarcity of supply and anxiety of\r\nbuyers, may also interfere with a free market. Any scarcity in food\r\nproducts leads to an anxiety on the part of consumers to buy and an equal\r\ndisposition on the part of owners to hold for higher prices. In this case,\r\nwhile the law of supply and demand is still active, the effects are quite\r\nout of the ordinary course. Thus, for a long time it has been estimated\r\nthat a scarcity of one-tenth in the natural supply of wheat raises the\r\nprice three-tenths, scarcity of two-tenths raises the price eight-tenths,\r\nscarcity of three-tenths raises the price one and six-tenths, scarcity of\r\nfour-tenths raises the price two and eight-tenths, and scarcity of\r\none-half makes the price of the half-crop four and a half times greater. A\r\ndecrease in the supply of less essential foods evidently cannot have equal\r\neffect. Thus, a scarcity of sugar, causing increased price, will directly\r\nreduce consumption of sugar, so that the limit may be easily reached. The\r\nsame conditions may exist with reference to meats, since a high price\r\ndiminishes the demand from the disposition of people to eat less meat.\r\nIndeed it has passed into almost a proverb that dear bread makes cheap\r\nmeat, for the reason that few will diminish the supply of daily bread, but\r\nthe mass are willing to lessen the meat diet to save expense.\r\n\r\nSimilar conditions, affecting every market for any commodity, may easily\r\nbe discovered. Yet in spite of all these extreme fluctuations, no better\r\ntest of value has been suggested than the market price in open,\r\nunrestrained competition of buyers and sellers.\r\n\r\n_The market price._—In the discussion of value so far, the term market\r\nprice has been used because perfectly familiar to everyone. It is\r\nnecessary, however, to call attention to the fact that price always\r\nindicates an estimate of value in units of current money. If that money\r\nitself has a fluctuating value, the same article may have at different\r\ntimes different prices with the same value, or the same price with\r\ndifferent values. Thus market prices in our country during and after the\r\ncivil war, in which a paper currency gave the unit of prices, cannot\r\nsafely be compared with each other, and can far less be compared with\r\nprices upon a specie basis.\r\n\r\nEven the reduction to a so-called gold basis may give misleading ideas in\r\nregard to the market, since a new element of speculation in gold enters\r\ninto the calculation. In all the accompanying illustrations of fluctuating\r\nprices, this particular abnormal condition has been carefully excluded.\r\nAny fluctuations in the value of money metals, necessarily affecting the\r\nrelation of market price to market value, will be treated under standards\r\nof price in Chapter X.\r\n\r\n_Prices of farm products; the crop year._—The actual fluctuations of\r\nmarket prices under the law of supply and demand can be most clearly seen\r\nby a careful study in the same definite market during a period of years.\r\nFor illustration here the staple products of the farm have been chosen,\r\nand the markets of Chicago and New York, as most truly representative,\r\nhave furnished the facts for study. These facts are presented to the eye\r\ndirectly by a series of charts, each of which has been most carefully\r\nprepared from official records, and gives within narrow limits a large\r\nrange of investigation. In every case involving annual crops, it seemed\r\nnecessary to rearrange statistics so as to cover the actual year affected\r\nby the crop in question. September 1 was chosen as the beginning of each\r\nyear, because that date is nearest the time when the new crop of the\r\nseason appears in market and directly affects the price of such products\r\nin store. All calculations upon live stock have been brought to the same\r\nbasis, for the reason that the supply of marketable stock is largely\r\ndependent upon the supply of feed for stock. It seems very desirable that\r\nall statistics in regard to markets and productive industry should be\r\nbrought to a uniform year. The year given in these charts seemed best to\r\nsuit the subjects treated. It is possible, however, that for all data\r\nconvenience would settle upon July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year in\r\nthe United States, as the best for beginning the universal statistical\r\nyear. Each chart in the series, of course, requires its particular\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuations of supply and prices for series of years are exhibited in\r\nthe Charts 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 12, and these are explained in detail at the\r\nclose of the chapter.\r\n\r\n_Fluctuations with season._—Every product of the farm is known to have\r\nconditions favorable or unfavorable from the mere changes of season\r\naffecting the prospective supply. Conditions equally dependent upon the\r\nseasons have something to do with demand. The result of both combined is\r\nworthy of study by farmers and dealers in farm produce, that all may get\r\nthe full benefit of such knowledge as the study affords. For this purpose,\r\ncharts showing the annual fluctuations of staple products in the leading\r\nmarkets have been carefully prepared. These may have a greater usefulness\r\nthan simply to illustrate the law of supply and demand, since it is within\r\nthe possibility of actual practice to in some degree modify by provident\r\nforesight the extremes of fluctuation. It is hoped that the suggestiveness\r\nof these charts may help the most enterprising farmers to adjust their\r\npractice to conditions of market.\r\n\r\nCharts Nos. 7, 10, 11 and 13 illustrate the fluctuations as related to\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\n_Law of diminishing returns._—In considering the value of farm products,\r\nit is necessary to notice a natural tendency in all products of the earth\r\ntoward greater cost of effort in production. This is called the law of\r\ndiminishing returns, and is illustrated in every industry where the\r\naccumulations of nature are depended upon for making labor effective.\r\nHunting, fishing and mining afford familiar illustrations of more work of\r\nthe same kind for equal product.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, however, gives the most extensive available illustration of\r\nthe facts grouped under this law. In the first place, the farmer is\r\nsubject to it by mere location. The product of a field near his house and\r\nbarn costs less exertion than the product of a more distant field. In the\r\nsecond place, he is likely to have chosen for his first efforts in crop\r\nraising the land most readily yielding its fertility in crops. If he\r\nextends his operations to less productive soil, he must work more for the\r\nsame product. In the third place, if a certain amount of work upon a\r\ncertain field will give him twenty bushels of wheat, he must give a good\r\ndeal more than twice as much work in the way of tillage and manufactured\r\nfertilizer to make a crop of forty bushels. The proof of this is clear in\r\nthe disposition of farmers to buy more land instead of to increase labor\r\nupon a limited space possessed.\r\n\r\nA specific statement of the law of diminishing returns is that _in the\r\ncultivation of land an increased amount of effort under usual conditions\r\nfails to give a correspondingly increased amount of produce_.\r\n\r\n_Exceptions to law of diminishing returns._—Exceptions to this law are\r\neasy to find, as where the first selection of land in a new country has\r\nhad reference rather to safety from wild beasts and savages or malarial\r\ndiseases than actual store of fertility. Another exception is found in any\r\nnew country, where imperfect adjustment of labor to conditions of soil and\r\nclimate are liable at the outset to prevent the full use of natural powers\r\nof the soil. So evident are these two exceptions in imperfectly developed\r\nagriculture that some have disputed the general fact, yet all must admit\r\nthe certainty of diminished returns from multiplication of the same kind\r\nof efforts upon the same space, and general proof is abundant in all long\r\nsettled communities.\r\n\r\n_Effect of improved farming._—Counteracting this tendency to diminishing\r\nreturns, and in many instances more than overcoming the difficulty, is a\r\ntendency toward improved methods in farming by more perfect application of\r\nlabor to the soil, better developed crops, better adaptation of live stock\r\nto culture, improved machinery of every sort, and more extended range of\r\noperations in farming, reducing the restraints of space by improved\r\ntransportation and more economical use of natural fertilizers; in short,\r\nby any improvement through which labor is made more directly effective in\r\neither quantity or quality of agricultural products. The whole story of\r\nthe development of agriculture in all these ways furnishes abundant\r\nillustration of this counteracting tendency. In some regions it has more\r\nthan counter-balanced the tendency to diminishing returns. Various staple\r\nproducts, like wheat, show in their diminishing value the advance in\r\nmethods of culture and adjustment of labor to production.\r\n\r\n_Diminishing values._—The above is only a particular illustration of the\r\ngeneral tendency of all values to diminish with every improvement in\r\ntools, machinery, economy of materials and saving of time, as the world\r\ngains wisdom in applying labor to the meeting of material wants. With\r\nevery discovery of more perfect power or better use of natural forces,\r\nlike electricity, or easier ways of handling raw materials, as in\r\ndeveloping aluminum from crude clay, the value of the product quickly\r\ndiminishes.\r\n\r\nA familiar illustration is found in the manufacture of steel. The\r\nso-called Bessemer process, introduced some thirty years ago, reduced the\r\nactual labor of making steel from iron by more than one-half. Improved\r\nfurnaces and greatly enlarged operations have reduced still further the\r\nlabor involved, until now steel often takes the place of iron, and the\r\nvalue of all such products is greatly diminished. This is easily\r\nillustrated by comparison of prices during a series of years, as shown in\r\nchart No. 14. That this reduction in price is not the result of poorly\r\npaid labor, but of better returns for labor expended, is evident to any\r\none investigating the tendency of wages or of living among wage-earners,\r\nor of the general improvement in welfare of communities where these\r\nlabor-saving methods are applied. Any hardship connected with these\r\ndiminished values falls chiefly upon the laborers who fail to adjust their\r\nwork to the improved method. But even they gain for the diminished value\r\nof their product a larger return on the whole through exchanges than the\r\nhigher values had brought them before.\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\n   Chart IV. Comparison of the numbers of live stock with increases in\r\n              population and mileage of railroad, 1860-1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHART NO. 4\r\n\r\n_Numbers of live stock compared with increase of population and mileage of\r\nrailroad, 1860 to 1898, in the United States_\r\n\r\n_Explanation._—This chart exhibits to the eyes a comparative increase of\r\n(1) population, (2) sheep, (3) hogs, (4) railroad mileage, (5) beef\r\ncattle, (6) cows, (7) horses, (8) mules. The figures followed in making\r\nthis chart are taken from the best estimates available, chiefly from the\r\nreports of the United States Department of Agriculture. It shows that\r\nrailroad mileage has increased faster than the population, with some\r\nslight exceptions, and its fluctuations mark quite distinctly the periods\r\nof financial speculation and distress. The great fluctuations in the line\r\nof sheep raising may be seen to have some correspondence with special\r\ntariff legislation. The striking opposition of hog raising to sheep\r\nraising is in accord with the universal experience that farmers easily\r\nturn from one to the other. The rapid development immediately following\r\nthe civil war represents the restocking of farms and the great expansion\r\nin farm industry so noticeable during that period. The falling off in\r\nnumbers of live stock during the last five years is evidently a reaction\r\nfrom a very apparent over-production in many directions during the\r\nprevious ten years. The miles of railroad are shown in thousands, the\r\npopulation and live stock in millions.\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\nChart V.

Pages 84-87.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHART NO 5.\r\n\r\n_Acreage and yield of corn, wheat and oats, 1862 to 1897, in the United\r\nStates_\r\n\r\n_Description._—This chart is intended to show the fluctuations from year\r\nto year in acres devoted to the three staple crops, together with\r\nfluctuations in the corresponding years in yield of each. Figures on the\r\nright show the number of millions of acres. Figures on the left give\r\nmillions of bushels. Continuous lines show the acreage. Dotted lines show\r\nthe yield. For convenience of comparison, the line of increasing\r\npopulation is added. The broken lines indicate what might have been the\r\nconsumption of each of these staples within our own country, if the people\r\nhad used throughout all the years as much of each as during the five years\r\nof plenty from 1888 to 1892. Lines marked 1 tell the story for corn; those\r\nmarked 2 for wheat; and those marked 3 for oats. In comparing the number\r\nof acres as given on the right with the number of bushels as given on the\r\nleft, it will be seen that an average yield of corn is assumed to be 25\r\nbushels per acre; an average yield of wheat, 12 bushels; and an average\r\nyield of oats, 28 bushels. The variations of the dotted lines above or\r\nbelow the continuous line show whether the yield was greater or less than\r\nthese averages. The average assumed is evidently too high for the oats.\r\n\r\n_Explanation._—Several important facts are shown. First, there has\r\nevidently been a very great increase in the amount of these staple crops\r\nin proportion to the population, with a recent tendency toward reduction.\r\nSecond, all three have exceeded the needs for domestic consumption, and at\r\nthe same time; while it is evident that the rate of consumption in the\r\nearly years could not have been equal to that of recent years. This\r\nappears very striking with reference to corn. An explanation of the\r\nincreased consumption of corn may be found in its larger use for fattening\r\npork and beef for export as well as for domestic consumption. It has also\r\nentered quite largely, through improved manufacture of meals, starches and\r\nsyrups, into table use. The consumption of oats is known to have greatly\r\nincreased in its use for breakfast food. The per capita consumption of\r\nwheat, while slightly increased in some quarters through the cheapening of\r\nflour, has been diminished by the larger use of corn and oats, and a far\r\ngreater variety of table food. Quite probably, however, the data as to\r\ncorn raising in the first few years of this period are not complete. The\r\nyears of the war made such statistics difficult to obtain. The difficulty\r\nwith reference to wheat raising was by no means as great, since the wheat\r\nraising regions were more directly accessible. Third, the seasons of\r\nabundance and those of poor crops can easily be seen. It is evident that\r\nwhile the three crops are not always poor together, they are too\r\nfrequently so to balance each other in meeting the risks of farmers.\r\nFourth, it appears that the fluctuations in yield are much greater in late\r\nyears. This is accounted for by the greatly increased proportion of lands\r\ncultivated upon the plains of the western states and subject to greater\r\nfluctuations of climate. It will be noticed that the acreage frequently\r\nfalls off in the years showing inferior yield. This shows that sowing and\r\nplanting have frequently been affected by unpropitious weather. In fact,\r\nwheat fields have frequently been plowed up in the spring and not counted\r\nin return of acreage. Reductions in the acreage of wheat, however, appear\r\nfrequently succeeding an immense crop. This indicates the effect of low\r\nprices. Fifth, the bearing of the total product upon the prices of these\r\nstaples, while suggested by the greatly increased amount, will be more\r\nclearly seen by reference to Chart No. 6.\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\n  Chart VI. Fluctuations in prices of wheat, Indian corn and oats in New\r\n                      York, 1878-1898. Pages 87-91.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHART NO. 6\r\n\r\n_Fluctuation of prices of wheat, corn and oats in New York, 1878 to 1896._\r\n\r\n_Explanation._—This chart exhibits the average price of each of these\r\nthree staples in September, December and May of each year. These months\r\nare chosen as giving without too great complication the widest range with\r\nreference to a particular season. September gives usually the price of the\r\nfirst of the new crop; December shows usually the fullest marketing of\r\ncrops; May marks the month of largest speculation with reference to the\r\nincoming crop. Corn is less distinctly affected by these peculiarities,\r\nbeing subject to different conditions of the weather as well as of\r\nmarketing. But the correspondence in price to a certain extent is easily\r\nperceived at a glance. The reason for this correspondence is partly in the\r\nuniform effect of seasons, as shown in Chart No. 5, and partly in the fact\r\nthat either of the crops may supplement, in certain respects, a deficiency\r\nin either of the others.\r\n\r\n_Wheat prices._—With reference to wheat, No. 1 in the chart, further\r\nparticulars as to prices are shown. The horizontal line in each year gives\r\nthe average price of the year; the diagonal line gives the extremes of\r\nprices, highest and lowest, within the twelve months from September to\r\nSeptember again. The dot within the circle gives the estimated average of\r\nfarm prices on the first of December, as given by the Department of\r\nAgriculture. The relation of this, somewhat constant, to the New York\r\nprice for December, as given in the line directly above it, may be of\r\ninterest as showing the average actual expense of bringing wheat from all\r\nover the United States to the New York market. Where the difference of the\r\ntwo prices is more than an average, a speculative turn in the market\r\nduring December is indicated, the farm price being fixed on the first day\r\nof December. The same fact of speculation is also shown in years where the\r\ndiagonal line is longer than usual.\r\n\r\n_Special variations._—At the top of the chart is shown the world’s visible\r\nsupply of wheat for each year, each horizontal line indicating 500,000,000\r\nbushels. The shaded portion gives the amount exported by the United States\r\nand the part above the shaded portion indicates the amount consumed or\r\nstored within the country. Thus, in the year 1894-5 the total wheat crop\r\nof the world was 2,672,000,000 bushels, of which the United States\r\nfurnished 460,000,000, 144,000,000 of this amount being exported. This\r\nyear marked the lowest price of wheat in the record, together with the\r\nlargest crop in the world, though not in the United States. A\r\nproportionally small amount exported explains the falling out of the\r\nbottom of the wheat market. By reference to Chart No. 5, it will be seen\r\nthat while the wheat crop of that year was considerably above the average,\r\nthe corn crop and oat crop were far below the average. This explains the\r\nfact appearing in Chart No. 6, that the price of wheat was lower than the\r\nprice of corn at the beginning of that year. It is probable that the use\r\nof wheat as a substitute for corn in feeding stock actually saved the\r\nwheat from a still lower price. The crop of 1891, the largest on record in\r\nthe United States, was accompanied by a moderate crop in the rest of the\r\nworld following two other moderate crops, indeed two short crops, for the\r\nentire world. The large amount of wheat exported explains the reason why\r\nthe fall of prices was not greater in this country. That the price did not\r\nfall faster was due to the fact, remembered by many, that farmers, as well\r\nas speculators, held to the crop with the expectation of larger demand\r\nfrom abroad. When the crop of 1892 was felt to be still larger throughout\r\nthe world, the price fell rapidly, in spite of a smaller crop in the\r\nUnited States. But when the prospect of an inferior crop in this country\r\nfor 1893 was felt in the spring, the price rose a trifle. Yet as soon as\r\nthe harvests of the world showed an enormous crop outside the United\r\nStates, the price dropped again. The crop of 1889 was a short one in the\r\nworld, and apparently should have affected the price of wheat in this\r\ncountry more than appears; but when the total amount exported is seen to\r\nleave more than an average crop in store, it is easy to see why the price\r\nin this country did not rise. The explanation of this small exportation is\r\nin the fact that the greater part of the shortage in yield was in\r\ncountries like Russia, from which no demand was felt, because the people\r\nsimply went without. The starvation of people in such countries affected\r\nthe demand for wheat in this country only so far as our benevolence\r\nenlarged the market. The peculiar shape of the line of wheat prices in\r\n1889 without any correspondence in prices of corn and oats is due to a\r\nspeculative movement for December wheat in Chicago. The attempted corner\r\nin wheat failed suddenly, or it might have produced a line similar to that\r\nof 1897-8, due to the famous long-continued Leiter corner.\r\n\r\n_Sources of information._—The object of this chart, taken altogether, is\r\nto show the general law of market prices as governed by supply and demand\r\nfrom the actual facts in the market for wheat. The facts are taken from\r\nthe best records available. The prices are from the daily record of the\r\nProduce Exchange of New York. The average price for the year and the\r\nfluctuations within the year are given for the period from September 1,\r\nwhen the new crop appears, to the August following, this being the period\r\nactually corresponding in market with a year represented by the crop\r\nfigures. The estimate of the world’s crop since 1885 is taken from\r\ncarefully prepared statistics in the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture. The estimates prior to that date do not include the entire\r\nworld, because no statistics can be reached, but they do include the most\r\ncareful estimates of all countries whose product entered into the world’s\r\nmarket. No effort has been made, for fear of complicating the chart, to\r\nshow a similar correspondence between supply and price in reference to\r\ncorn and oats. The tables following, however, give data for such\r\ncomparison with reference to this country alone. The export of corn and\r\noats has been too limited to play any great part in modifying prices.\r\n\r\n                                 [Table.]\r\n\r\n    Table of production—wheat, corn, oats, 1878 to 1897.

Highest year, lowest year, and\r\naverage of twenty years in New York, 1878 to 1897_\r\n\r\n_Explanation._—This chart is intended to show the tendencies of the market\r\nfor wheat from month to month throughout the market year. In the center is\r\ngiven the averages of highest prices and of lowest prices for each month\r\nin the New York Produce Exchange during the period from September, 1878,\r\nto August, 1897, inclusive. The horizontal lines between the averages of\r\nextremes give the average price for the twenty years in the several\r\nmonths. The diagonal lines give for each month the extreme fluctuation\r\nduring the twenty years. Above the lines of averages are given the\r\nfluctuations by months in the year 1881-2, the year of highest prices. The\r\nupper of the two continuous lines gives the top prices of the month and\r\nthe lower the bottom prices. The short horizontal lines give the average\r\nprice for each month; and the double horizontal line across the chart\r\nrepresents the average price for the year. Below, the fluctuations in\r\nwheat prices for 1894-5, the year of lowest prices, are shown in the same\r\nway. At the top of the chart are given, in millions of bushels, the\r\nreceipts of wheat in New York. The shaded double column in the center\r\nunder each month gives the average receipts for twenty years. To the left,\r\na single column shows the receipts for 1894-5. To the right, a single\r\ncolumn gives the receipts for 1881-2. Since the receipts at New York are\r\nchiefly for export, the general correspondence between receipts and prices\r\nis rather a result of a larger application of supply and demand than an\r\nexposition of it. The chief use of the chart is to show the fluctuation of\r\nprices under varying local conditions. The figures on the left give the\r\nprice per bushel, and the figures on both left and right at the top\r\nindicate millions of bushels.\r\n\r\nCHART NO. 8\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\n       Chart VIII.

Page 93.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prices of wheat in England for 600 years, 1300 to 1900_\r\n\r\n_Description._—This chart is to show at a glance the history of the wheat\r\nmarket in England for the past six hundred years. The record of the first\r\nfour hundred years is taken from Rogers’ “Agriculture and Prices.” That\r\nfor the eighteenth century, less complete, is taken from Schoenhof’s\r\n“History of Money and Prices.” The nineteenth century record is from the\r\nreport of the statistician of the United States Department of Agriculture.\r\nAll are reduced with care to the basis of bushels and dollars and cents.\r\nThe figures on the right and left show the price per bushel in United\r\nStates money.\r\n\r\n_Explanation._—The heavy horizontal lines show the average price during a\r\nperiod of ten years, though in a few instances the period is longer. The\r\ndiagonal lines show the extremes of fluctuation during the period which\r\nthey cover. During the first two hundred and fifty years the coinage of\r\nEngland made the shilling in which prices were reckoned a much larger\r\nunit, practically three times as great as at present. The dots within\r\ncircles indicate where the horizontal lines might have been had the unit\r\nbeen always the same. The same dots crossed cover a period of forty years\r\nin which prices are somewhat uncertain, from transition between the old\r\nstandard and the new. The beginning of the nineteenth century shows a\r\nremarkable condition of the wheat market, due chiefly to the wars in which\r\nEngland was engaged, together with issues of paper money affecting the\r\nstandard of value. The record is especially interesting from showing,\r\nfirst, the great fluctuations natural from unequal seasons; second, the\r\ngradual increase in cost of production under the law of diminishing\r\nreturns; third, the effects of changes in money legislation; fourth, the\r\neffect of extra consumption in times of war; and fifth, the effects of the\r\npresent world-wide commerce in overcoming the law of diminishing returns.\r\nA more complete record for the eighteenth century would add to the\r\ninterest, if not to the effectiveness of the chart.\r\n\r\n_Relation to wages._—For convenience of comparison, the average price of\r\nwheat in France during periods of twenty-five years, as given by\r\nSchoenhof, is added by dotted horizontal lines. The double line across the\r\nchart indicates the range of average day’s wages of house mechanics in\r\nEngland, without indicating the extreme of fluctuations. It seems evident\r\nthat wages and subsistence have something in common.\r\n\r\nCHART NO. 9\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\n    Chart IX. Prices of hogs and hams in Chicago, 1884-1907. Page 95.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prices of live hogs and green hams in Chicago, 1884 to 1897_\r\n\r\n_General description._—This chart exhibits the fluctuations in prices of\r\nlive hogs and green hams as shown by reports of the Chicago Board of Trade\r\nfrom September, 1884, to August, 1897, together with the visible supply of\r\nlive hogs in the market from month to month and for the entire year. The\r\nfigures to right and left give dollars per cwt. of live hogs, and per\r\nbarrel of green hams. The figures upon the upper third of the chart, right\r\nand left, indicate the number of thousands of live hogs received in\r\nChicago during the successive months, as indicated by the dark lines. The\r\nfigures at the top of the chart under the date line give the number of\r\nthousands of hogs received during the entire year. The year is taken from\r\nSeptember to August following, because the hog crop is in large measure\r\ndependent upon the corn crop coming into use in September.\r\n\r\n_Prices of live hogs._—No. 3, irregular line, gives the fluctuation of top\r\nprices in every month from September, 1884, to August, 1897, for fat hogs.\r\nThe total range is between $3.30 per cwt. in September, 1896, and $8.80 in\r\nFebruary, 1893. A somewhat striking general correspondence is readily seen\r\nbetween this line of prices and a line connecting the ends of the lines\r\nindicating the monthly supply of live hogs at the top of the chart. The\r\naverage price of the year is easily seen to be low when the supply for the\r\nyear is high, and high when the supply is low, though in some instances\r\nthe effect of an increased supply is evidently anticipated in the prices.\r\nThus, an increase of 2,000,000 of hogs in 1889-90 over the supply in\r\n1888-9 is anticipated by falling prices during the early part of 1889. In\r\na similar way, the effect of a diminished supply in the summer of 1895 is\r\nnot so marked upon the prices as might have been the case had not the\r\nprospect been strong for a large supply in the fall of 1895. Whatever\r\ninfluence the local manipulation of the market may have had, it is\r\nperfectly evident that conditions of supply and demand have overwhelming\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n_Prices of green hams and mess pork._—No. 2, giving the range of prices\r\nper barrel of green hams, shows fluctuations in some respects\r\ncorresponding to the prices of live hogs, but with variations due in a\r\nmeasure, undoubtedly, to speculative interests in these products. The\r\nrange is from $6.60 in December, 1897, to $13.80 in May, 1893,\r\ncorresponding with the range in the prices of live hogs. Were there room\r\nupon the chart, it would be easy to show an almost exactly corresponding\r\nfluctuation in the prices of mess pork, which article is one affected\r\nlargely by speculation, though even that speculation is dependent upon\r\nprospective supply and demand. The prices of mess pork at the New York\r\nProduce Exchange during the same period ranged from $9 a barrel in 1885-6\r\nto $15.80 and $15.60 in 1887-8, $14.20 in 1889-90, $11.75 in 1891, $14.20\r\nin 1892, $22.60 in 1893, and gradually down to $7.25 in 1896-7.\r\n\r\nCHART NO. 10\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\n Chart X.

The\r\nfigures on the left indicate the prices per cwt. of live hogs and per bbl.\r\nof green hams and mess pork. No. 1 gives, in the dotted line above the\r\ndate figures, the highest price of mess pork in each month of the year,\r\nwhile the dotted line below the date figures gives the lowest price for\r\nthe corresponding months. The range in any month is found in the distance\r\nbetween the heavy dots on the line following the name of the month. Thus\r\nthe highest price in April, 1893, is $19.35, and the lowest price in the\r\nsame month, $15.50. The range throughout the year is from $21.80 in May to\r\n$12 in August. No. 2 gives the same facts with reference to the prices per\r\nbarrel of green hams; and No. 3 gives the corresponding facts as to prices\r\nof live hogs.\r\n\r\n_Annual fluctuation, 1896-7._—Nos. 4, 5 and 6, marked by more distinct\r\nlines, show the range of prices for these three related articles of\r\ncommerce for the year 1896-7. No. 4 gives the prices of green hams, which\r\nin this year averaged higher than the prices of mess pork, although the\r\nfluctuations of mess pork are the greater. At the top of the chart are\r\ngiven in thousands the number of live hogs received in Chicago during the\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\nOn the right of each month are the numbers for 1892-3; on the left the\r\nnumbers for 1896-7.

The\r\nfigures opposite the shaded lines at the top indicate receipts of live\r\nhogs in thousands, by the average in each month, for the fifteen years.\r\nThe year is taken from September to August following, for correspondence\r\nwith the crop year, as in previous charts.\r\n\r\n_Explanation._—No. 1 gives in the upper continuous line the average of top\r\nprices for mess pork in successive months; and in the lower line the\r\naverage of bottom prices for the same months. The long, diagonal lines\r\nshow the extreme of fluctuations in each month during the entire fifteen\r\nyears. Thus the lowest price reached during the month of April in any year\r\nwas $8.05, while the highest was $25.50. The lowest price in November of\r\nany year was $6.40, while the highest price in the same month was $15.50.\r\nNo. 2 gives in the same way the average of top prices and bottom prices\r\nduring the fifteen years for green hams; and by its diagonal lines, the\r\nextremes of fluctuation. No. 3 presents a corresponding showing of average\r\ntop and bottom prices of live hogs, with extreme fluctuations. No. 4, at\r\nthe top of the chart, gives the average receipts of live hogs in Chicago\r\nduring the several months of the year, counted in thousands.\r\n\r\nThe supply of hogs.—The correspondence between the receipts of live hogs\r\nand the average market price in each month is worthy of study. Every\r\nfarmer can see in what months of the year the market is fullest. It is\r\nalso evident that the fluctuations in mess pork are much more extensive\r\nthan in live hogs or fresh products. This is doubtless due to the\r\npossibility of speculation in a product which can be held for future\r\nmarket. Nevertheless, it is quite evident that the prices of mess pork\r\nhave some direct connection with the supply available.\r\n\r\nCHART NO. 12\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\n  Chart XII. Prices of cattle and beef in Chicago, 1884-1897. Page 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prices of cattle and mess beef in Chicago, 1884 to 1897_\r\n\r\n_Description._—This chart is planned to show the prices of cattle and the\r\nprices of mess beef from month to month from September, 1884, to August,\r\n1897, together with the supply of cattle received in Chicago in each month\r\nand for each year. The figures right and left on the lower part, give in\r\ndollars the prices per hundred pounds live weight, and per barrel of extra\r\nmess beef. Above, to right and left, the figures indicate thousands of\r\nlive cattle received in Chicago.\r\n\r\n_Explanation._—No. 1 gives the lowest price in successive months of lowest\r\nquality of beef steers. No. 2 gives the highest price in successive months\r\nfor stock cattle. No. 3 gives the highest price in successive months for\r\nbest quality of beef steers. No. 4 shows the fluctuations in the highest\r\nprice per barrel of extra mess beef from month to month. No. 5 shows, by\r\nlength of lines in each month, the receipts of cattle in Chicago by\r\nthousands. No. 6 gives the number of thousands of cattle received in each\r\nyear. As in previous charts, the year runs from September 1 to August of\r\nthe year following, though the relation of the beef market to the crops of\r\nthe year is not so marked as that of the pork market. Although the\r\ncorrespondence in prices between these various parts of the cattle trade\r\nis not absolute, it is too striking to be consistent with independence of\r\ncauses. The price of stock cattle has some elements not found in the price\r\nof beef cattle; and the price of lowest quality of beeves for canning\r\npurposes is naturally more uniform than any other prices.\r\n\r\nCHART NO. 13\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\n Chart XIII. Annual fluctuations in prices of cattle and beef in Chicago,\r\n                           1883-1897. Page 104.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Annual fluctuation in prices of cattle and beef, Chicago, 1883 to 1897_\r\n\r\n_Explanation._—This chart is intended to illustrate the changes of prices\r\nin successive months upon the average of fifteen years, as to stock\r\ncattle, beef steers, mess beef and beef hams. The data are taken from the\r\ndaily records of the Chicago Board of Trade, from September, 1883, to\r\nAugust, 1897. The figures to right and left indicate prices in dollars per\r\nhundred pounds live weight, and per barrel of beef products. No. 1\r\nindicates the range of prices for beef hams. The upper line gives the\r\naverage of highest prices in each month for fifteen years. The lower line\r\ngives the average of lowest prices for the same period. The diagonal lines\r\ngive the extremes of prices within the fifteen years.\r\n\r\n_Mess beef and beef steers._—No. 3 gives the average of highest and lowest\r\nprices for mess beef. Nos. 4 and 6 give respectively the average of\r\nhighest and lowest prices for beef steers. The diagonals give the extremes\r\nfor beef steers during the entire period. No. 5 gives the average of\r\nhighest prices for stock cattle.\r\n\r\n_Supply of cattle._—In the center, No. 2, is given the average receipts of\r\ncattle in the Chicago market for each month. The unshaded portion at the\r\nend of the lines, represents the average reshipment of cattle. Thus\r\nSeptember, on the average, brings 265,000 cattle to Chicago and reships\r\n90,000; while October brings nearly 283,000 and reships 82,000.\r\n\r\n_Peculiarities of mess beef market._—It will be noticed that the prices of\r\nbeef hams give an annual curve, entirely distinct from either of the\r\nothers. This indicates the fluctuation in demand entirely out of keeping\r\nwith the supply. It is quite possible that the opening and closing of\r\nnavigation upon the Great Lakes may be an important influence. Certainly\r\nthe change of the season between cold and heat is an important element,\r\nsince the lowest month, and that of least fluctuation, is December. The\r\nmonth of highest prices is August, and those of greatest fluctuation are\r\nMay, June and September. The curve of prices for mess beef has a fair\r\ncorrespondence with the numbers of cattle slaughtered in Chicago. The line\r\nindicating top prices of beef cattle has peculiarities of its own, because\r\nit stands for quality as well as quantity, representing the fancy lots,\r\nwhich are necessarily somewhat more irregular than the average. The line\r\nof prices for stock cattle is evidently affected by the variations in\r\ndemand by feeders. The line of lowest prices for beef cattle, No. 6, is\r\nquite probably affected by quality as well as supply.\r\n\r\nCHART NO. 14\r\n\r\n                                 [Chart.]\r\n\r\nChart XIV. Wholesale prices of iron, kerosene, etc., New York, 1867-1896.\r\n                                Page 106.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prices of iron, kerosene, etc., 1867 to 1896_\r\n\r\n_Description and Explanation._—This chart gives the prices from year to\r\nyear for steel rails, bar iron, pig iron and nails in the New York market,\r\neach dot indicating the average for the year. The average prices for the\r\ncorresponding years for refined kerosene are also shown. No. 1 gives\r\nprices per ton of steel rails, into which enters all the influence of the\r\nimproved methods of manufacture. No. 2 represents the prices of bar iron\r\nper ton, less affected by improvements but influenced by the substitution\r\nof steel. No. 3 gives the prices of nails per thousand pounds. For\r\ncomparison with the other prices of iron, the prices of nails must be\r\ndoubled. All will realize the immense improvements made in the manufacture\r\nof nails. No. 4 gives the prices per ton of pig iron. It is evident that\r\nall these forms of iron and steel have stood in the market under the same\r\ngeneral influences, with slight modifications from special characteristics\r\nof production or use. No. 5 gives the average price in each year for one\r\nhundred gallons of refined kerosene oil. The price per gallon can be found\r\nby reading the figures as cents instead of dollars. In the same way the\r\nprice of ten pounds of nails can be found. It should be said, however,\r\nthat all these prices are the wholesale prices, retail prices being\r\nsubject to local influences, sometimes even to custom, which prevents\r\ntheir adhering closely to the prices in larger markets.\r\n\r\n_Even monopoly affected._—These articles have been chosen as illustrating\r\nthe essential law of prices even under the advance of combination of\r\ncapital upon an enormous scale. The iron industries and the Standard Oil\r\nCompany come nearest, perhaps, to fulfilling the conditions of monopoly\r\nfound anywhere. Yet the actual effect of improved methods in great\r\ncombinations is seen to have reached the mass of the people in spite of\r\nany tendency to sustain prices by combination. A line, No. 6, indicating\r\nthe general trend of wages for farm hands in the North, is added to more\r\nclearly indicate the distribution of welfare through such improvements in\r\nmethod. For still other purposes, the fluctuating price of silver bullion\r\nis shown in line No. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X. Exchange—Its Machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Free communication._—From what has been said in the preceding chapter as\r\nto the nature of value and price, it will appear that the most fundamental\r\ncondition for ready exchange is perfectly free communication between\r\nindividuals as to wants and abilities to meet wants. There is implied,\r\nalso, an absolute protection of property rights and of equity in dealing\r\nthrough the laws and customs of the community. No one acquires property\r\nfor the purpose of exchange unless he can foresee the possibility of\r\ncarrying out the exchange at any future time. He must also feel that he is\r\nprotected by surrounding circumstances from misinformation as to values.\r\nIn short, any community is ready for free exchange among its members only\r\nwhen it maintains the conditions for fair competition. To this fairness of\r\ncompetition many things contribute, aside from the governmental machinery.\r\nThere can be little trade without a common language, and the full\r\nadvantages of common speech are reached through every facility for ready\r\ncommunication between all the individuals of the community. An universal\r\npress, postal facilities, telegraph and telephone systems have all grown\r\nup in meeting this need.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of established market places, boards of trade and produce\r\nexchanges. Not only does the multitude of exchanges in one place lessen\r\nthe cost of such exchanges, but these make it possible for multitudes to\r\nreach a fair understanding of what is wanted and what is offered in any\r\nline of production. This need accounts for the tendency so frequently\r\nnoticed to establish great centers of trade in particular commodities. The\r\nworld wants a fair understanding of what the world contains, and these\r\nmethods of bringing together buyers and sellers are the natural outgrowth\r\nof this need.\r\n\r\n_Full statistics._—The same end is served still more fully by frequent\r\npublication of price-lists, and a daily record of the transactions in any\r\nmarket gives information which every dealer can use to advantage. Public\r\nstatistics, carefully and honestly prepared, serve both buyers and sellers\r\nof any article of commerce. The farmer needs as much as anybody the\r\nfullest information as to what his fellow farmers have to sell, whether\r\nthey are immediate neighbors or in distant parts of the world. The price\r\nof wheat on any farm ought, if perfect understanding is reached, to\r\nconform to the general law of supply and demand throughout the world, and\r\nthe yield of wheat in Russia, India and South America affects the value of\r\nevery bushel raised in our country.\r\n\r\nEvery advance in the perfection of statistics and the rapidity of\r\ncollection makes more certain the bargain of every producer and consumer.\r\nPeople have sometimes opposed the gathering of statistics for fear that\r\nlarge dealers and speculators may take unfair advantage from such\r\ninformation. But a careful consideration will show that managing of the\r\nmarket depends chiefly upon want of information on one side of the\r\nbargain. If farmers were as thoroughly informed as to the crops of the\r\nworld as carefully collected statistics might make them, no false rumors\r\ncould mislead them in selling their produce. The evident tendency toward\r\nmore stable markets, as shown by the records of the last twenty years, is\r\naccounted for partially, at least, by the more perfect information\r\navailable. If farmers themselves would take interest in furnishing\r\naccurate estimates of the extent and condition of every product held for\r\nsale, they would in the long run reap the highest advantages of clearly\r\nunderstanding the supply and demand in the markets of the world. This\r\nwould do more to destroy the demoralizing force of mere speculation than\r\nany possible legal enactment.\r\n\r\n_Ready transportation._—An equally important part of the machinery of\r\nexchange is easy transportation. Every improvement in the transportation\r\nof persons or products not only lessens the cost of the article when\r\ndelivered, but increases the actual stability of price and range of the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer farmers of northern Ohio found absolutely no market for their\r\nwheat until the opening of the Erie canal. Farmers upon western prairies\r\nfound corn their cheapest fuel until railway transportation brought coal\r\nmines and corn fields into closer relations. The rural community which\r\ntakes pains to have good roads not only lessens the cost of hauling grain\r\nto market by saving friction and toil, but actually enlarges its market at\r\nhome. Hard roads enable them to do four times the work they can do on soft\r\nroads. In the same way any improvement of railroads, construction of pipe\r\nlines for gas and oil, or introduction of pneumatic tubes, for mails and\r\nlight packages in cities, directly spreads the range of market for the\r\nproducts of every individual laborer and makes more sure the returns for\r\nany effort he may give in production. Perhaps this is even more easily\r\nseen by considering how the world’s markets are opened by improvement in\r\nwater transportation. Water freight on a bushel of wheat from Chicago to\r\nNew York from 1865 to 1874 averaged over twenty-two cents; from 1885 to\r\n1894 it was less than seven cents.\r\n\r\nThe universality of markets for all kinds of products is clearly shown by\r\nrealizing what we have within reach of every country community today. Such\r\neasy transportation adds to the productive abilities of every person. Over\r\nordinary roads the cost of transporting wheat two hundred miles is equal\r\nto its value at the end of the journey. Corn will usually pay its way not\r\nmore than half that distance. So in countries where railroads do not exist\r\nthe people consume only what they themselves produce, or devote themselves\r\nto very few products, and so occupy only a portion of their time. In the\r\nbest developed regions of our country, every family can reach a steady\r\nsupply of all kinds of goods, and can know that every article produced has\r\nits proper place in the market without waste. The cost of delivering bread\r\nin Boston is greater than the cost of carrying the flour in it two\r\nthousand miles. This ready transportation leads to more complete and more\r\ndefinite occupation and so to larger returns in the way of satisfaction\r\nfrom all efforts. The extended market gives added value to all permanent\r\nor fixed capital. It makes both farms and homes more useful, if full\r\nadvantage of such improvements is taken. At the same time, values of land\r\ntend toward an equality throughout the world.\r\n\r\n_Diminishing cost of transportation._—That the cost of transportation\r\nkeeps diminishing in spite of combinations of capital to prevent it, and\r\nin spite of local legislation restricting it, proves that the increasing\r\nperfection of machinery and the accession of capital in railroads and\r\nwaterways are stronger than the purposes of men. That freights are\r\nregulated by “what the traffic will bear” is merely another way of saying\r\nthat transportation comes under the universal law of values—what the\r\nservice is worth in the market, or what people are willing to give for it.\r\nAccording to good authority, the net profit of carrying one ton of freight\r\none mile has fallen in twenty-five years from one cent to less than\r\none-ninth of a cent. The same principle fixes a classification of freight\r\naccording to service. We can afford to pay more for carrying valuable\r\nproduce than for carrying cheaper products. It also leads to special rates\r\nfor developing traffic, as illustrated in rates on baled alfalfa hay from\r\nwestern plains to Chicago.\r\n\r\nWise managers, if not misled by speculation in stocks, care more for\r\nenlarging traffic than for immediate returns upon a smaller bulk, because\r\nthe bulk of profit is greater. A good illustration of development of a\r\nspecial traffic is found in the milk trains running two hundred or three\r\nhundred miles to supply the city of New York. The railroads are compelled\r\nby the needs of the traffic to carry the milk cheaply enough to prevent\r\nits being made into butter and cheese. Laws regulating this charge are\r\neffective, because such a necessity exists in the nature of the case.\r\n\r\n_Weights and measures._—Another important growth in the machinery of trade\r\nis found in standards of quantity,—weights and measures of every kind. It\r\nis scarcely possible to realize the uncertainty of exchange without exact\r\nweights and measures. The story of the Indian trader who bought furs by\r\nweight, putting his hand upon the scales for one weight and his foot for\r\nits double, illustrates how uncertain such judgments of quantity may be\r\nwithout system. The present names of weights and measures indicate their\r\norigin in similar ways.\r\n\r\nMeasures have usually been connected with some part of the body: as\r\n“finger,” used one way in measuring the load of a gun and another on a\r\nstocking; “hand,” still used in measuring the height of horses; “span,”\r\nonce considered sufficiently definite for any measurement; “foot,” now\r\nmade to conform to an accurate system; and “pace,” still used in many\r\ncommunities. Connected with the arm, are “cubit” and “yard.” Many ladies\r\nstill measure their dress goods by arm’s lengths. For small measures,\r\n“grain” and “barley-corn,” still used as names, indicate dependence upon\r\naverage quantity in articles of general growth.\r\n\r\nToday all civilized governments settle upon a definite system of measures\r\nand weights, all accurately connected with each other and with some\r\nprecise dimension in nature supposed to be invariable. Our common yard is\r\ndistinctly associated with a pendulum vibrating seconds; and in the great\r\ndecimal system, adopted by most countries in Europe, and likely to be\r\nreached in all countries, the whole is connected with a measured meridian\r\nupon the earth’s surface. Care is then taken to have standard measures and\r\nweights prepared in such a way as to be free from all effects of any\r\nchange of temperature, and legal enactments distinctly define each measure\r\nand weight, actually punishing one for the crime of using false weights or\r\nmeasures. Units of quantity thus enter into all our calculations and form\r\nan essential basis of all exchange. Cheating in measure and weight grows\r\nless and less possible with this clear understanding of exact units. The\r\nNew York Legislature has defined the size of fruit packages, and the\r\nMassachusetts poultry raisers ask a law requiring eggs to be sold by\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n_Metrical system._—If the whole world should unite on a single decimal\r\nsystem of measures and weights, like that now used in most of Europe, all\r\nwould be gainers from the reduction of misunderstandings and\r\nmiscalculations increasing the cost of exchange. The difficulty of\r\nadopting a new system arises chiefly from the absolute importance of any\r\nsystem and the unconscious use of that to which people are already\r\naccustomed, together with its application in a thousand unthought of ways\r\nto every tool and every rule. That the advantage of a uniform decimal\r\nsystem would more than balance the difficulty of change, no student of the\r\nsubject now doubts. Some have estimated the saving at nearly one-half of\r\nthe present clerk hire. Our government has already taken steps for such a\r\nchange, though years may be required to accomplish it.\r\n\r\n_Standards of quality._—The machinery of exchange also involves standard\r\nunits of quality, but these must vary with every different kind of\r\ncommodity. Custom has given rise to all sorts of devices for expressing\r\ndegrees of fineness, strength and hardness, as well as more delicate\r\nqualities of flavor and odor. Boards of Trade often establish offices of\r\ninspection with brands upon grains, flour, butter, pork, etc., and these\r\nbecome definite parts of a contract which the government rightly enforces.\r\nPrivate trade-marks and brands, if honestly used, become a prominent\r\nelement in exchange. These are protected rightly by being filed with the\r\ngovernment, which secures to the originator his sole use of such a proof\r\nof quality.\r\n\r\nIn some articles of trade, when a whole community is interested, the\r\ngovernment goes further and undertakes inspection and branding by an\r\nofficial. This in most states applies to kerosene oil, first for public\r\nsafety, but afterwards for protection of exchange. Laws regulating the\r\nquality of fertilizers are based upon the necessity of knowledge, that\r\nbargains may be fair; and in many parts of our country now the branding of\r\nground feeds, with an analysis of their qualities, is deemed an essential\r\nof safe bargaining. The extent to which this effort to establish the\r\ncertainty of qualities may need to be carried can be estimated by the\r\nrecent agitation over adulterations of food products. All believe that, as\r\nbuyers, they have a right to know the quality of what they buy. It is\r\nconceivable that markets may some time establish a system of terms,\r\ndescriptive of qualities, almost as definite as weights and measures. All\r\nthis contributes to fair competition in exchange.\r\n\r\n_Standards of value._—More important still in the machinery of exchange is\r\na standard unit of value. We have seen that value in any article of\r\ncommerce can be fixed in terms of any other article, but prices remain\r\nindefinite so long as there is want of universal appreciation or appraisal\r\nin essentially the same terms and ideas. The tendency toward definite\r\nprices in well understood units of value is as clearly perceptible in the\r\nprogress of commerce as is the tendency toward definiteness in weights and\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nIn early ages almost any article of common use, so that its qualities\r\nmight be generally understood, has served as a standard of value, in terms\r\nof which all wealth has been estimated. Communities engaged in grazing\r\ncounted all their wealth by cattle. Homer’s heroes wore armor valued in\r\ncattle, and early Roman coins bore the images of cattle, while the very\r\nname of Roman coins, _pecunia_, is supposed to have been derived from the\r\nname of the flock. Communities of fishermen for a long period have\r\nestimated wealth in dried fish. More mechanical peoples have used some\r\narticle of manufacture, like nails in some Scottish villages and the\r\ncountry cloth of western Africa. Sometimes a single prime article of\r\nexport has served the purpose, like tobacco in the colony of Virginia and\r\ndried hides on the plains of South America. In most of pioneer America the\r\nhunters’ pelts have served the same purpose, the average “coonskin” having\r\na value which all could understand. As communities became more wealthy the\r\ndisplay of wealth in ornaments made of precious metals and in precious\r\nstones has led to the use of these as standards of value. American Indians\r\nused their wampum, and African tribes employed peculiar shells. But as\r\ncommerce increased, embracing wider regions, gold and silver became the\r\nstaple article of value everywhere, since these, so easily tested for\r\npurity, could have their value estimated definitely by weight. Thus the\r\nstandard unit of value has been definitely connected with standard\r\nweights.\r\n\r\n_Coinage._—Gradually these weights, for greater ease of transfer and for\r\nclearer understanding of values, became the basis of coinage. The stamp of\r\nthe coiner became a certificate of quality and quantity, and finally, as\r\nin the case of weights and measures, governments assumed the whole\r\nresponsibility for fixing the weight and fineness of coins, and reduced\r\nall coinage to system, that every citizen might know the value of the unit\r\nin which he estimates any article of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe early coins were definite weights of gold, silver or copper, and in\r\nmany countries coins still bear the names that indicate their original\r\nweight. Yet arbitrary rulers have often sought to cheat their subjects by\r\nissuing coins of lighter weight and baser metal. The French livre, now the\r\nfranc, is one seventy-second of its original value. English coins were\r\ndebased ten times between the years 1299 and 1601 to exactly one-third of\r\ntheir original value. The loss from such debasement falls almost wholly\r\nupon the poor, whose wages fail to buy the usual food and clothing. Henry\r\nVIII reduced the coins of his realm again and again, until it would have\r\ntaken five years’ revenue of Elizabeth’s reign to restore the currency.\r\nElizabeth chose to take the standards as she found them, but to establish\r\nan absolute degree of purity and fix by law the weight of each coin in the\r\nsystem. The standard of purity since maintained in England is 22 carats,\r\nor eleven-twelfths fine, and weights have been maintained in spite of\r\nseveral efforts to reduce them. Other nations have taken similar steps\r\nwith varying standards of purity: .835 in the Latin union, .9 in the\r\nUnited States, and over .96 in most coinage of western Asia. In this way\r\nthe standard of value for every citizen of a country is as clearly defined\r\nas the standard of weight, and every transaction in trade, with every\r\naccount of such transaction, involves that unit.\r\n\r\n_United States coinage._—A brief statement of the system of coinage now\r\nestablished in the United States may illustrate the definiteness of the\r\nstandards of value. The United States mint at Philadelphia and its\r\nbranches at New Orleans, Denver, San Francisco and Carson have the sole\r\nauthority for making coins. Any effort at coinage by outside parties is\r\ncriminal. The mint receives the gold and silver by weight and assay of\r\npurity, melts and refines and mixes with alloy, to bring the mass to\r\nrequired fineness, nine-tenths pure, and casts the metal into bars called\r\nbullion. These bars are then most carefully assayed, and, if found of\r\nexact standard purity, are rolled and drawn into plates the thickness of\r\nthe coins desired. From these plates disks are punched by machinery, each\r\ndisk being weighed, and if found too light thrown aside, if too heavy\r\nreduced by filing, until every disk represents exactly the required weight\r\nof the coin desired. The disks then pass through a milling machine which\r\nraises the edges, and when cleaned by dilute acid and carefully dried, are\r\nstamped by a steel die with some device covering both surfaces completely.\r\nThis effectually gives the seal of the nation to the purity and weight of\r\nthe coin, and, since it covers the whole surface, prevents the possibility\r\nof reducing that weight without marring the coin.\r\n\r\n_United States standards._—The system of coinage in the United States\r\nsince 1873 embraces standard coins of gold, silver, nickel and copper, but\r\ngold alone actually furnishes the standards of value, all other coins\r\nbeing at present subsidiary. Gold is coined for individuals free; that is,\r\na certain weight of metal presented at the mint is assayed, to determine\r\nthe exact weight of pure gold, and an equal weight of pure gold is\r\nreturned to the owner in coin. Sometimes a slight charge for the expense\r\nof coinage is made and called seigniorage. At present no such charge is\r\nmade, for the reason that when a nation bears the cost of coinage, foreign\r\ncoins are kept from circulation, and its own coins are current everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe standard unit of value for the United States is 25.8 grains of gold\r\nnine-tenths fine, and this is called a dollar, although no coin of this\r\nweight is at present struck. In actual practice, the standard is shown in\r\nthe ten-dollar piece, or eagle, weighing 258 grains. The half eagle (five\r\ndollars) and the quarter eagle (two dollars and fifty cents) indicate upon\r\ntheir face their relation to the principal coin. The double eagle, or\r\ntwenty-dollar piece, is coined for greater convenience. These coins\r\nconnect all the currency of the country directly with the market value of\r\ncommodities in the world, through gaining their value directly from the\r\nmarket value of gold, where gold is bought and sold. Thus gold furnishes\r\nthe standard of value with which all other values are compared.\r\n\r\nSilver coins of the United States are made from silver purchased by the\r\ngovernment. The dollar, adopted from the Spanish rix-dollar, itself\r\nderived from the German thaler, is by law a coin of 412-½ grains of silver\r\nnine-tenths fine. This silver dollar has a story of its own, which will be\r\ngiven later, and does not form a part of the system of 1873. The half\r\ndollar, the quarter dollar, and the dime, for fractional currency, are\r\nproportional parts of 385.8 grains of silver nine-tenths fine. These are\r\nabout five per cent less in weight than the proportional parts of the\r\nsilver dollar. The original purpose of this reduced weight was to prevent\r\nthe consumption of these coins in ordinary uses by making them worth on\r\nthe face a little more than their bullion value. These fractional coins\r\nare legal tender in the courts to the amount of five dollars. In nickel\r\nand copper coins no effort has been made for many years to maintain a\r\nstandard of value, the amount of metal in any of them being far less in\r\nvalue than their face. They are legal tender only to the amount of\r\ntwenty-five cents.\r\n\r\n_Fluctuation of standards._—In the study of the precious metals as the\r\nstandard of prices, it is necessary to remember that the value of these\r\nmetals, like that of all products of labor, is subject to considerable\r\nfluctuations. The very fact that gold and silver are durable metals, not\r\neasily consumed or readily worn away, tends to make the increased product\r\nin a series of years less and less valuable. While the ordinary increase\r\nin product may be provided for by increased demand through extended\r\nexchange, the very improvements in the machinery of exchange, especially\r\nthe extension of general credit, operate in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the value of gold and silver within one hundred years\r\nafter the discovery of America, when European nations took possession of\r\naccumulations among the inhabitants of Central and South America,\r\ndiminished to a little more than one-fourth of the value previous to that\r\ndiscovery. It is estimated that the value of gold since the discovery of\r\n1849, in California, followed by the opening of mines in Australia and\r\nSouth Africa, has been reduced to little more than three-fifths of its\r\nvalue in 1850. This estimate is based upon careful comparisons between\r\nwhat an ounce of gold in 1850 would buy of some hundred staple products,\r\nand what the same ounce of gold will buy today of the same hundred\r\nproducts. The test is a somewhat uncertain one, from the fact that many\r\nproducts are much more affected by improved methods of production than\r\nothers, and changes of habits and customs among the people greatly affect\r\nthe prices by changing demands. The combination of a large number of\r\nproducts being less likely to be affected than any one, the comparison is\r\nworthy of some confidence. Nevertheless, it is possible for two different\r\npersons, making different selections for comparison, to arrive at very\r\ndiverse results. If the selected articles are those of ready manufacture\r\nwhere improved methods have most largely entered, the value of gold will\r\nseem to have increased; if, on the other hand, the selected articles are\r\nraw materials, in which the law of diminishing returns gives greater cost\r\nof production, the value of gold will seem to have diminished.\r\n\r\nA test easily applied, though not absolutely correct, is in the amount of\r\nlabor of the most common sort which an ounce of gold would pay for at the\r\ndifferent periods compared. Careful comparisons show that an ounce of gold\r\ntoday buys more of all sorts of manufactured articles and more of most\r\narticles of food, though less of the better class of meats and less of\r\nlabor, than ever before. This fluctuation in the value of gold has its\r\nchief importance in connection with long extended credits, though its\r\ninfluence is felt in other directions through a common system of accounts,\r\nin which the standard unit of some system of coinage is the sole basis of\r\ncomparisons. If the standard unit is growing less valuable, in a series of\r\nyears the book-keeper will show a constantly increasing total of wealth;\r\nif, on the other hand, it is growing more valuable, the books will show an\r\napparent loss. Were a perfectly uniform standard possible, all interests\r\nwould be best provided for.\r\n\r\n_Ratio of silver to gold._—More directly important in its effect upon\r\nexchanges is the unequal fluctuation of gold and silver when both are made\r\nthe standard of value. That silver and gold are from independent sources,\r\nsubject to variations of their own in product and processes of extraction,\r\nmakes it impossible that they should sustain always the same ratio to each\r\nother in value.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the subject by Professor Rogers shows that early in the\r\nthirteenth century one pound of gold was worth ten pounds of silver, at\r\nthe close of that century would buy twelve and one-half pounds of silver,\r\nand in the middle of the fourteenth century bought thirteen and\r\nthree-fourths pounds; but in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, after\r\nthe new world was pillaged, one pound of gold bought from ten and one-half\r\nto twelve pounds of silver. In the seventeenth century fifteen pounds of\r\nsilver went for one pound of gold, and in the eighteenth, fifteen and\r\none-half pounds. Early in the nineteenth century the ratio was fixed in\r\nthis country at sixteen of silver to one of gold, and that estimate was\r\nassumed to be essentially correct as late as 1877, when a pound of gold\r\nwould exchange in the market for three and one-half pounds of platinum,\r\nseven pounds of aluminum, sixteen pounds of silver, seventy-one pounds of\r\nnickel, 942 pounds of tin, 1,696 pounds of copper. Twenty years have\r\nproduced great changes in both the total annual products and the relative\r\ncost of mining. The estimate of 1877 would now be incorrect for any of the\r\nmetals named. A pound of gold now buys 1,540 pounds of aluminum, the\r\nchange being due to an invention for reducing aluminum ore. It now takes\r\nabout thirty-seven pounds of silver to pay for one pound of gold, a change\r\nin part due to new systems of coinage in which silver plays a subordinate\r\npart, but chiefly due to the greatly increased product of rich mines and\r\ngreatly improved methods of reducing ores.\r\n\r\n_The cheaper money drives out the good money._—In any system of coinage,\r\nemploying both silver and gold as standards, it is found by actual\r\nexperience, repeated hundreds of times, that a change in the ratio between\r\nthe two metals in open market always leads to hoarding for speculative\r\npurposes of the most costly metal of the two.\r\n\r\nThus, in our country previous to 1873, when silver was worth more than\r\none-sixteenth of its weight in gold, uncoined silver was necessarily worth\r\nmore than coined silver for some purposes, and the coins already struck\r\nwere worth more in the manufacture of spoons and plate than to circulate\r\nas coins. Prior to 1853, when the half dollars, quarter dollars and dimes\r\nwere coined at the ratio of sixteen to one, such coins could not be kept\r\nin circulation, for the reason that they were worth more than their face\r\nvalue. The law of 1853 reduced the weight of these coins so that their\r\nmarket value as silver was sure to remain a trifle less than their face\r\nvalue. The result was no further melting up of these small coins for use\r\nin the arts or for bullion. This fact is only one illustration of what is\r\ncalled Gresham’s law, formulated in the time of England’s base coinage\r\nduring the sixteenth century, but noticed centuries earlier, that _cheap\r\nmoney always drives out a more costly money_. The principle is as constant\r\nas human nature, that nobody will give a greater value when a less value\r\nwill serve the same purpose. For this reason, no country in recent times\r\nhas been able to keep both gold and silver as the actual standards of\r\nvalue at the same time. Either the ratio must be changed with every\r\nfluctuation of either metal, or one of the metals must be undervalued in\r\nthe system of coinage, as has been done in England for the greater part of\r\nthis century; or else the total coins of the cheaper metal must be limited\r\nin amount, as has been done by the Latin Union in Europe during the last\r\ntwenty-five years. In either case the tendency is toward a single\r\nstandard. The commercial world prefers a stable, well understood unit to a\r\nchangeable one. And while the fluctuations of gold alone affect somewhat\r\nthe stability of prices, these are thought of less importance than the\r\nnecessary legal adjustments for new systems of coinage.\r\n\r\n_Monometalism and bimetalism._—The discussion has led to two opposing\r\nviews, distinguished as monometalism and bimetalism. The monometalist\r\nholds that since one metal only can, under ordinary circumstances, set the\r\nstandard of price, it is wise to choose the one subject to the least\r\nfluctuation for the universal standard. The bimetalist holds that a\r\nnation, or at any rate a group of nations, can fix by agreement the price\r\nof gold and silver in terms of each other, when used as money. Since the\r\nuse of these metals as money makes the chief demand for them, it is\r\nthought possible to make this legal ratio hold upon the total product of\r\nboth gold and silver. If, then, in any country the supply of gold should\r\nbe out of due proportion with silver, its overvaluation will at once\r\nattract gold from other countries until it becomes no more profitable\r\nthere than elsewhere. The result is assumed to be a somewhat ready\r\nequalization of values for the territory establishing the standard, so\r\nthat the actual fluctuations of the standard unit will follow the line of\r\nlowest prices for either of the metals. The monometalist feels certain\r\nthat the actual withdrawal from circulation, and so from use as money, of\r\nthe higher priced metal causes greater hardship and probably greater\r\nfluctuations in values of other commodities than any fluctuation of a\r\nsingle standard can produce.\r\n\r\nIt is very certain that the commercial world recognizes the tendency\r\ntoward a single standard, and that the coinage systems of all civilized\r\ncountries are practically, if not in definite form, based upon a single\r\nstandard. The countries of wide commerce and extensive credit are using\r\nthe gold standard. The less developed countries adhere to the silver\r\nstandard. Many which nominally sustain both have, by some legal\r\nrestriction in the coinage of silver, become practical supporters of the\r\ngold standard. Few, if any, thorough students of the subject believe it\r\npossible by statute in the present conditions of mining and commerce to\r\nbring the commercial world anywhere back to the ratio of sixteen to one,\r\nestablished in the United States in 1834. Statute law might declare a\r\nsheep to be equal to a horse, but no power on earth could make it pull as\r\nmuch. So even agreement among nations, by legal enactments, cannot enforce\r\nan unnatural relation between two products.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL STANDARDS OF VALUE, 1899\r\n\r\n_Gold_            _Gold, with       _Gold or          _Silver_\r\n                  silver limited_   silver_\r\nGreat Britain,    United States,    Haiti, Uruguay,   Mexico, Central\r\nGermany,          France,           Argentine         America,\r\nSweden, Norway,   Belgium, Italy,   Republic,         Columbia,\r\nDenmark,          Switzerland,      Venezuela,        Bolivia, Peru,\r\nAustro-Hungary,   Greece, India.    Spain, Servia,    Equador, China,\r\nRoumania,                           Bulgaria,         Hong Kong and\r\nTurkey,                             Netherlands,      Straits, Cochin\r\nPortugal,                           Algeria, Tunis,   China.\r\nBrazil, Canada,                     Japan, Java,\r\nNewfoundland,                       etc.,\r\nEgypt, Russia,                      Philippine\r\nChile.                              Islands,\r\n                                    Hawaii.\r\n\r\n_Actual bimetalism._—It is necessary to caution against supposing that the\r\nuse of both gold and silver as currency in any country implies true\r\nbimetalism, nor is it at all certain that the making of either gold or\r\nsilver legal tender at option touches the question of bimetalism. Only the\r\nissue by free coinage at the will of the owner of both metals shows a\r\ndistinct attempt to maintain bimetalism. The actual maintenance of both\r\nstandards has always been, and always will be, by alternation, when the\r\nratio of the two metals as to value is established at very nearly the\r\nmarket value of the two metals in bullion.\r\n\r\nPopular demand for a return to the old ratio in the United States is\r\nfounded in part upon misconception of commercial principles and largely\r\nupon a misunderstanding of current events during a financial crisis. The\r\nsupposed dangers from a single standard of value are largely exaggerated\r\nfrom confusion of standards with currency in exchange. It is quite\r\nconceivable that gold may still serve as a standard unit of value, while\r\n90 per cent of exchanges have no other use for gold beyond its furnishing\r\nterms of comparison. We must measure value by value, and the unit of value\r\nmust be true to its name, just as we measure length by something long. But\r\nthe number of yardsticks in actual use in a store may have no constant\r\nratio to the number of yards of cloth sold by that measure. The folding of\r\ncalico in yard folds relieves the yardstick, but does not change the\r\nnature of the yard. So gold, or silver, is relieved of many functions in\r\nexchange through banking systems without materially affecting its use as a\r\nstandard unit.\r\n\r\n_The multiple standard._—It is proper to mention in connection with units\r\nof value a theoretical device for overcoming the necessary fluctuation in\r\nall articles of value. This is sometimes called the multiple standard. The\r\nplan, in brief, is to appoint a committee of experts, whose record of\r\ncurrent prices, in some general market, for a hundred or more staple\r\narticles of commerce, shall be compared from week to week, or day to day,\r\nin such a way as to indicate how far above or below the average the price\r\nof any article may be. If, then, gold is made a legal tender, a comparison\r\nof its price with the average of all prices will show how much weight of\r\ngold must be given on any day to actually return a value exactly\r\nequivalent to what was borrowed sixty days or a year previous, when the\r\nratio of gold to average prices was different. In this way it is supposed\r\nthat natural fluctuations in gold, silver or any other commodity made\r\nlegal tender for debt can be fully provided for without loss to either\r\ndebtor or creditor.\r\n\r\nThe objections to this ideal standard are the practical difficulty of\r\nsettling, first, the wide range of commodities to serve as the basis;\r\nsecond, the importance to be given each in adjusting the standard; and\r\nthird, the nature of the commission under which the work should be done.\r\nIn the history of the world, custom has preceded law in devising for\r\nwelfare; in this, law without experience will have to precede custom. The\r\ndifficulty which most men would experience in understanding and trusting\r\nsuch a system puts off indefinitely the possibility of a general adoption.\r\n\r\n_The currency._—The last essential in perfect freedom of exchange is a\r\nsatisfactory means of transferring completely and quickly all property\r\nright in any article of trade. Exchange of commodity for commodity or\r\nservice for service is possible to a very limited extent, since the man\r\nwho wants my horse may have nothing which I want in return, or if he has,\r\nthe values may be unequal, and one or the other must remain in debt, which\r\nmeans that one of the articles belongs in part to both. In some new\r\ncountries exchanges are confined to this slow and uncertain method of\r\nbarter, where nobody can buy until he finds a neighbor wanting just what\r\nhe himself has to sell. Traders in such countries contrive to accumulate a\r\nvariety of things needed by all sorts of people, that they may be ready\r\nwith some kind of exchange to meet particular wants. No community,\r\nhowever, begins to reap the clear advantages of exchange until some\r\nuniversally acceptable medium of exchange is discovered and accepted. The\r\nprocess of developing this medium is essentially the same as that\r\ndescribed in establishing a standard of value; and so the word money\r\nnaturally represents both the standard of value and the common currency of\r\ntrade. It is easy, however, to see by further examination that the two\r\nfunctions of money are quite easily separable, and that, while it is\r\ndifficult to substitute for the standard of value, a variety of\r\nsubstitutes can serve as currency.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of coinage hitherto, the standard of value has been assumed to\r\nbe the most important, but in fact a large proportion of our coin serves\r\nsimply as currency without materially affecting the standard of value.\r\nThis is true of all the fractional coins, which are purposely over-valued,\r\nand equally true of the silver dollar under existing circumstances. In\r\nfact, the primary use of coin was simply for the purpose of transferring\r\nproperty. In the words of Aristotle, 350 B. C., “Men invented among\r\nthemselves, by way of exchange, something which they should mutually give\r\nand take, and which, being really valuable in itself, might easily be\r\npassed from hand to hand for purposes of daily life.” This coined money\r\nsupplies the needed means of exchange most readily because it carries its\r\nvalue with it. In all civilized communities, and in many only partially\r\ncivilized, it is readily exchangeable for any article of commerce. It is\r\nalso valued in proportion to its weight, so that any bulk in gold or in\r\nsilver may be easily divided by exchange for smaller coins. With a little\r\npainstaking the coins are made identical in value, so that every trader\r\nknows what he gives and receives. They are exceedingly durable, resisting\r\nalmost all the forces of nature with little loss. For this reason they are\r\nlikely to have an almost universal value, that is to be wanted by\r\neverybody, in any place, at any time, and under any circumstances. These\r\nfacts are proved by the tendency to hoard such coins whenever individuals\r\nhave a surplus of wealth beyond present wants, or whenever there is risk\r\nin using wealth as capital because of distrust of government, of\r\nindividuals or of future enterprise. A buried treasure is almost sure to\r\nbe in the form of coins.\r\n\r\nUnder a system of coinage, inequalities in exchange are easily adjusted,\r\nlike “the boot” in a horse trade, or the balance between produce carried\r\nto the store and the articles carried away. Most of all, coin is used\r\nwhere for any reason there is distrust of the future. Coin, or its\r\nequivalent in bullion, is needed in all transactions where credit is\r\nwanting. This appears prominent in all lawless communities with a\r\nfluctuating population, and may be found in ignorant communities where\r\nmethods of credit are not established. It is often essential in the\r\nsettlement of claims between hostile countries, and is the final means of\r\nadjusting balances in all foreign trade. Occasionally this need appears in\r\na universal panic, where each man takes his fellow by the throat, saying,\r\n“Pay me that thou owest.”\r\n\r\n_Coin a part of a country’s capital._—The coined money of a country thus\r\nbecomes wealth in store for constant use as a machine of exchange. Its\r\noperation is effective when it keeps in constant motion, being itself\r\nconsumed very slowly in the wear and tear of motion. It is sometimes\r\ncompared to an endless screw, transmitting motion to everything else with\r\nwhich it comes in contact. Like other machines, it may be either too\r\nabundant or too scarce for the best advantage of the country. In either\r\ncase there is waste. When the coin is idle it is unproductive, but suffers\r\nless waste from deterioration than almost any other kind of machine. In\r\ncase of scarcity the cost of its use is increased under the general law of\r\nsupply and demand, exactly as the cost of other machinery in use is\r\nadvanced when many desire to use it. This machine is a prominent part of\r\nthe capital of a country, greater in some countries than in others. In\r\nFrance the value of coin is estimated to be 3 per cent of the value of all\r\nreal estate, including buildings. The use of such a machine makes a\r\nmaterial part of the annual cost of exchanges. The coin of England, where\r\ninterest is comparatively low, costs for its use in interest, wear and\r\ntear, and re-coinage more than $20,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\nAn additional cost to individuals is in the extra risk of carrying such\r\nwealth, as shown in express charges and special insurance, and still\r\ngreater expense for safe keeping, and a considerable use of time in\r\ncounting. These facts have led to many devices for lessening the need of\r\nkeeping wealth in this form.\r\n\r\n_Credit by accounts._—The most obvious method of avoiding the use of coin\r\nin exchanges is a current account between individuals having many\r\ntransactions in trade. A farmer carries his butter, eggs, fruits, grains\r\nand live stock, perhaps, to a single dealer in all these articles, and\r\ntakes in return articles of household use or for any necessity as he\r\nrequires them, from a spool of thread to a harvester. If both keep\r\naccurate accounts, a settlement once in six months satisfies most\r\nconveniently all the requirements of perfect trade. Indeed the settlement\r\nis needed only that the accounts may be verified. Except for the dangers\r\nof waste in unlimited credit and carelessness in expenditure where future\r\nwealth is drawn upon, this method of exchange is simple and inexpensive.\r\nIn the nature of the case, however, it must be limited, for safety, to\r\ntrade between people having confidence in each other’s honesty of purpose\r\nand ability to keep correct accounts. It also requires a mutual\r\nexpectation of ability on the part of either to meet indebtedness at any\r\nfuture time of settlement.\r\n\r\n_Credit by due-bills._—An extension of this credit in well established\r\ncountries, so as to take in other persons than the two involved in book\r\naccount, is found in due-bills, notes of hand payable on demand, or more\r\nformal securities, any of which may require a final decision in court.\r\nThese pass from hand to hand, often in connection with coin, and under\r\nordinary circumstances serve their purpose cheaply. In some countries a\r\nnote of hand, with endorsement of each user, may make exchanges until it\r\nis covered with endorsements. The danger of waste is considerable from the\r\nimpossibility of knowing the financial standing and honesty of the various\r\nendorsers, and the system is limited, of course, to the range of\r\nconfidence in such trustworthiness. So easy is it to extend this credit of\r\nindividuals beyond the range of safety that most governments have found it\r\nnecessary to protect their citizens against its dangers by limiting or\r\nprohibiting its use as currency.\r\n\r\n_Credit currency._—So convenient, however, and so economical is the use of\r\ncredit, that all well established nations have developed systems for the\r\nissue of a credit currency founded upon the stability of strong\r\ncorporations or upon the national credit. Nations themselves have often\r\nissued bills of credit in the form of notes, or promises to pay at the\r\nnational treasury. If these are payable on demand in the coin of the\r\nrealm, they are said to be redeemable. If the time of payment is\r\nuncertain, or indefinitely postponed, they are said to be irredeemable.\r\nThus we have the many forms of paper money so familiar to everybody and\r\nthe various practices and speculative theories regarding it, which make a\r\nlarge part of the discussion of financial questions throughout the world.\r\n\r\nNo one doubts the worthlessness of currency in any form of note, from\r\nindividual or firm, which cannot be paid when presented. The notes of the\r\ngovernment, so long as that government is considered stable, may circulate\r\nreadily, and even after doubts exist as to the final ability of the\r\ngovernment to redeem, they still circulate, perhaps with greater\r\nreadiness, in the feeling that hoarding is utter loss and the stopping of\r\ntrade in the ordinary perishable products of industry will be an enormous\r\ndisaster. This feeling often leads to the use of a currency without value,\r\nlike the token money used for change in the absence of legal coins. Though\r\nnobody is bound to redeem these tokens, everybody takes the risk of loss\r\nas less disastrous than no exchange. Paper money issued by corporations is\r\nuniversally considered dangerous to the interests of communities, unless\r\nvery carefully restricted within distinct and clearly understood limits.\r\nThe discussion of such issues will be given in another chapter devoted to\r\nbanking. The issue of paper money by governments has been a frequent\r\ndevice for enforcing contributions of citizens to extraordinary expenses\r\nin war or other disaster. A history of such issues cannot be given within\r\nthe limits of this book, but is well worth the study of those who seek an\r\nunderstanding of the powers and limitations of government under natural\r\nlaws, in making a satisfactory currency. A government’s stamp upon the\r\npiece of paper is so far good, and only so far, as it secures to the\r\nreceiver of the paper an equivalent value to what he gave for it. If the\r\ngovernment itself is unable to give that value, it can never insure the\r\nability or the willingness on the part of any individual to give such\r\nvalue. While millions of dollars in such form may serve as currency\r\nwithout any deterioration, as at the present time, when government\r\npromises in all the various forms amount to nearly $1,000,000,000, should\r\nany of these, on any day, be refused payment for want of means in\r\ngovernment possession, every individual in the land would feel that the\r\nvalue of his possessions in the shape of such notes was made just so far\r\ndoubtful as the chances of redemption are postponed. All issues of such\r\nnotes at once become certificates of debt rather than credit, and lose, to\r\ngreater or less extent, their exchangeable value.\r\n\r\nIn the extraordinary issue of “greenbacks” during the civil war, the\r\npurchasing power of a paper dollar was reduced to less than half, and\r\ngradually appreciated in value as the expectation of early redemption\r\nincreased. The effect of such issues upon government revenues will be\r\ntreated in its proper connection. As currency, it certainly robs each\r\ncreditor and holder while depreciating, and as surely robs each debtor\r\nwhile appreciating. As wage earners are universally creditors, according\r\nto prevailing customs, they suffer most in a depreciation of money values:\r\ni. e., they work for dollars at one value and a week or a month later\r\nreceive them to expend at a less value. Speculative debtors, on the other\r\nhand, always thrive on depreciating currency, paying their debts in what\r\ncosts less exertion. Under appreciating currency, the creditors gain, be\r\nthey bankers or workmen.\r\n\r\n_Banking._—The peculiar convenience for saving found by experience in the\r\nuse of each of these methods of settlement in exchange leads to a natural\r\ncommingling of all. Coins serve some purposes best, and accounts have a\r\nlimited range; notes of hand are often desirable, and paper money, if\r\nsafe, is universally convenient. This natural combination has led to a\r\nmore systematic arrangement for handling various kinds of currency, called\r\nbanking. The most obvious addition to the machinery of exchange in the\r\nsystem of banking is the possibility of immediate transfer of property\r\nright in a bank deposit by check and account, or by a draft in account\r\nbetween banks, or by bills of exchange in more distant transactions. The\r\nbank deposit is made up of individual wealth, or titles to wealth,\r\nsupposed to be immediately available for use in exchange. It may consist\r\nof all the kinds of currency described or conceivable. Checks are orders\r\nupon these individual accounts or deposits, and by their means exchanges\r\nare made with great ease and little risk between individuals in the same\r\nneighborhood or even in distant cities or distant countries. The cost of\r\nstoring, handling or transferring any form of currency is reduced to a\r\nminimum. So far-reaching is this comparatively modern machine of exchange\r\nthat it is properly assumed to be the means of settling 90 per cent of all\r\nexchanges, domestic and foreign, with almost no use of money in any of its\r\nnumerous forms. Its importance as a machine of commerce entitles banking\r\nto a more distinct consideration, and chapter XI will be devoted to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n_Deferred settlement._—In certain stages of civilization exchanges\r\ninvolve, not simply present wealth, but prospective accumulation. A farmer\r\nmay purchase his farm upon the assurance of crops and stock to be raised\r\nin a series of years. In this exchange final settlement is deferred by\r\nnotes payable at definite future dates, the promise to pay being secured\r\nby a deed in trust, a mortgage deed or individual endorsement. If many\r\nindividuals are united, a purchase may be made by means of issuing more\r\nformal notes called bonds, the property of the company being pledged for\r\nthe payment of the bonds when due. Sometimes such purchases are made by\r\nthe issue of stock, establishing the right of the seller to a certain\r\nundivided share in the wealth controlled by the company. In this case the\r\ntime of final settlement is indefinitely postponed, to be fixed by limits\r\nof the charter or by a vote of the stock-holders. All these certificates\r\nof indebtedness serve to a limited extent in exchange of property. So far\r\nas they enter into commerce, after the first transaction, they are simply\r\narticles of purchase and sale, having a more or less established market\r\nvalue. Since they usually represent an accumulating interest or a\r\nprovisional dividend, the market value is constantly fluctuating, and they\r\ncan therefore serve almost no purpose of currency.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which such notes, bonds and stock can be made the basis of a\r\nsingle purchase in establishing some enterprise gives to them an\r\nindefinite influence in trade, sometimes immensely extending the apparent\r\npurchasing power of a community. The advantages and disadvantages of such\r\ndeferred settlement are so varied and important as to make it worth while\r\nto treat the subject more extensively than is proper in this analysis, and\r\nsuch treatment will be found in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI. Banks And Banking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin of banks._—Attention has been called to the banks of the country\r\nas a most important part of the machinery of exchange. It is proper to\r\ndescribe more fully the nature of the machine and its operations. A clear\r\nunderstanding of the character and process of banking on the part of all\r\nthe people both extends its influence and diminishes its dangers. Banking,\r\nlike everything else in civilization, has had a natural growth. The\r\ndifferent steps in its growth have been devised for the sake of meeting\r\nthe needs of a growing commerce, and banking can exist only where\r\ncommercial transactions are frequent and constant.\r\n\r\nThe word bank, distinctly related to the English word bench, is supposed\r\nto have been adopted from the fact that early Jewish dealers in money sat\r\nby a bench in the streets of Italian cities. The commercial city of Venice\r\nis supposed to have been the seat of the first organization distinctly\r\nnamed a bank. This was a corporation of money lenders who handled their\r\ncapital in the form of coin by exchanging it for notes of individuals.\r\nThis was as early as the twelfth century. Since that time in every\r\ncivilized community there has been experiment upon methods for quickening\r\nexchanges through such organizations, some of which have been of great\r\nadvantage and some have brought disaster. The modern system of banking is\r\nthe result of all these centuries of experience, a history of which cannot\r\nbe given here.\r\n\r\n_Bank described._—A brief description of the most modern form of banks\r\nunder state or national restrictions will help to understand how these\r\ninstitutions serve the world of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn simplest terms, a bank is a company founded for the sole purpose of\r\ndealing in coin and current certificates of credit of every form, the\r\nprime object being the convenience of people in making exchanges of any\r\nkind. Sometimes a bank is called upon simply to make change, or, as we\r\nsay, to break a valuable coin or a bill of large denomination into smaller\r\npieces. On the border land between two countries the banker serves a\r\ntraveler by exchanging the coins of the country he leaves for coins of the\r\ncountry he enters.\r\n\r\nOften the bank, equipped with safe protection against fire or robbers,\r\nreceives the wealth of others in any form of money for safe keeping, with\r\nprovision for its being paid when it is needed, whenever and wherever the\r\nowner directs. The same bank may be asked to exchange the money in its\r\npossession for notes of individuals payable on demand or at definite\r\nfuture time. It may even issue notes of the firm in place of the\r\nindividual notes received, acquaintance of a community with the standing\r\nof the bank as a dealer in money making its notes circulate where\r\nindividual notes would not. In this case the wider credit of the bank is\r\nexchanged for the limited credit of individuals. In the end a well\r\nestablished bank in close association with a system of banks is expected\r\nto do any service that has to do with either money or credit, so long as\r\nthe credit approximates cash transactions, and has not drifted into\r\noverdue debts requiring courts and officials for collection.\r\n\r\nSo important are all these functions of a bank to the interests of society\r\nthat distinct provision is needed in the law of the land for establishing\r\nthe bank and maintaining its efficiency. The double system of government\r\nin our country known as state and national leads to two classes of banks,\r\ncalled state or national according as they are organized under authority\r\nof state government or under national laws.\r\n\r\n_State banks._—The independent laws of any state are supposed to provide\r\nsuch restrictions as the people desire for the management of banks. Any\r\nbank chartered by the state government is subject simply to the laws of\r\nthe state pertaining to banks and is called a state bank, whatever the\r\nname under which it does business.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the different states vary indefinitely, but the essentials of\r\na banking law quite recently established in one of the states may serve to\r\nillustrate the modern ideals as to safe, legitimate banking. Under this\r\nlaw a bank must be a corporation of not less than five persons who have\r\nsubscribed for the entire stock and have paid at least 50 per cent of the\r\nvalue of this stock before beginning business, with provision for payment\r\nof 10 per cent each month until the whole of the capital stock is paid for\r\nin cash. Each stock-holder is individually liable to an amount equal to\r\nthe value of his stock for any debts of the bank in excess of its original\r\nstock. Having settled upon a name distinct from all others, its\r\napplication is made to a bank commissioner for a charter to do business in\r\nbanking according to the laws of the state. Under the charter issued by\r\nthe commissioner, the bank is required to be managed by a board of\r\ndirectors, from five to thirteen in number, which board elects the needed\r\nofficers and appoints the necessary clerks. It cannot increase its capital\r\nexcept by fully paid stock, and can do no other kind of business, like\r\nbuying and selling of goods and lands, or managing factories and\r\nrailroads. It is authorized to receive deposits and make loans at interest\r\nnot above legal rate, provided it keeps on hand available funds, including\r\nbank balances, amounting to 20 per cent of its total deposits, and never\r\nloans to one individual or firm more than 15 per cent of the paid up\r\ncapital of the bank. A penalty of fine and imprisonment follows conviction\r\nof any officer for receiving deposits after general insolvency is known.\r\n\r\nEach bank is required to report to the commissioner at least quarterly,\r\nand whenever called upon to publish its report; while failure to comply\r\nwith requirements of the commissioner in report or otherwise brings\r\nimmediate forfeiture of the charter. The commissioner or his deputy must\r\nvisit each bank at least once a year and whenever occasion may require.\r\nIf, upon examination, a bank is found insolvent the commissioner himself\r\ntakes charge of the business for final settlement of its affairs. These\r\nimportant restrictions and careful inspection are thought necessary to\r\nsecure the public interests in banking. The state through its bank\r\ncommissioner gives guaranty to the public of legitimate and safe banking.\r\nThe value of that guaranty, of course, depends upon the honesty,\r\nexperience and executive ability of the bank commissioner, whose term of\r\noffice and compensation should make him as independent as possible of any\r\nweakening influence. Under present arrangements no state banks issue their\r\nnotes as currency because of a national tax of 10 per cent, which prevents\r\na possible profit from its issue. Present state laws, therefore, make no\r\nprovision for that function, unless by statutes existing before the\r\norganization of national banks. The states still have the constitutional\r\nright, apparently, to charter banks of issue, but the advantages of\r\nuniformity throughout the nation are so evident as to make such action\r\nvery improbable.\r\n\r\n_National banks._—The so-called national banks organized under authority\r\nof United States government have been in existence since 1863, and have\r\nproved, so far as currency is concerned, such an improvement upon anything\r\npreceding in the way of bank issues, that few have advocated any return to\r\nformer methods. The system as now existing places the authority of the\r\nUnited States in an officer called the comptroller of the currency. The\r\nlaw requires an association of five or more persons with a definite name\r\nand location, having not less than $100,000 capital ($50,000 in small\r\ntowns) all paid within six months of beginning business. Share-holders are\r\nindividually responsible for debts of the bank, aside from their stock, to\r\nan amount equal to their stock.\r\n\r\nIn banks having over $5,000,000 capital a surplus of 20 per cent may take\r\nthe place of this individual responsibility. Not less than one-fourth of\r\nthe capital stock, usually one-third, is deposited in the United States\r\nTreasury in the form of registered bonds of the United States, to be held\r\nexclusively for security of circulating notes. These notes are issued to\r\nthe bank by the comptroller to the amount of not more than 90 per cent of\r\nthe market value of the bonds deposited. These notes, printed by the\r\ngovernment, signed, registered and sealed in the United States Treasury,\r\nin denominations from five dollars to one thousand dollars, become money\r\nwhen signed by the officers of the bank whose name they bear. The cost of\r\nthese notes, together with the cost of restoring when worn out, as well as\r\nthe expenses of the comptroller’s office, are met by a tax of 1 per cent\r\nper annum, paid semi-annually, upon the average amount of notes in\r\ncirculation during the previous six months. Such notes are not a legal\r\ntender, but are received at par for all dues to the United States except\r\nduties on imports, and for all demands against the United States except\r\ninterest on the public debt and in redemption of currency. Any other issue\r\nof notes is prohibited, and worn out notes are cancelled and burned in the\r\nTreasury of the United States, being replaced by new.\r\n\r\nThe banks in sixteen principal cities are required to hold a reserve equal\r\nto 25 per cent of their circulating notes in lawful money of the United\r\nStates, namely coin or treasury notes, and all other banks must have a\r\nreserve equal to 15 per cent of their circulating notes in the same form.\r\nThis reserve is held for the redemption of the notes, provision being made\r\nfor such redemption at the Sub-treasury of the United States in New York\r\ncity, bank balances and clearing house certificates in the larger cities\r\nbeing counted as part of the reserve. The object of this is to secure\r\nready redemption of any note in all parts of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe comptroller’s office includes expert examiners, and to it each bank\r\nmust report at least five times a year, with other special reports as\r\ncalled for. Each bank is subject to examination at the pleasure of the\r\ncomptroller, and in case of failure to redeem bills or comply with the\r\nlaw, the comptroller has power to take possession of the bank and close\r\nits business. The usual banking business of any national bank proceeds\r\naccording to the laws of the state in which it exists, the legal rate of\r\ninterest of the state being compulsory.\r\n\r\n_Advantages and disadvantages of national bank currency._—The advantage of\r\nsuch a uniform system of bank notes is evident. The bills are secure\r\nbeyond the possibility of doubt as to their final redemption, and\r\ntherefore circulate freely without reference to the failure of the bank\r\nissuing them. In case of failure, all the banks form a ready machinery for\r\ncollecting the bills for final redemption at the United States treasury.\r\nThe frequent reports and expert inspection give as satisfactory means of\r\nmaintaining safe management as can be secured by law. The possibility of\r\nconnivance between examiners and bank officers is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there are disadvantages from several sources. First,\r\nUnited States bonds do not form a permanent basis. Second, the market\r\nvalue of these bonds and the low rate of interest make the use of capital\r\nin the shape of circulating notes less profitable than other capital in\r\nthe bank. This is especially true in the newer communities where interest\r\nis high, and banks so located are likely to surrender their circulating\r\nnotes at times when money loaning is most profitable, and thus cause a\r\nfluctuating volume of currency in the country. Third, the national banks\r\nare easily made objects of suspicion as to matters of legislation with\r\nreference to money.\r\n\r\n_Government banks._—Similar institutions under direct management of\r\ngovernment officers have often been thought of as bringing the banking\r\nmachinery within the direct judgment of the people, and so best meeting\r\nthe wants of the community as a whole. The advantages of unity and\r\npublicity in such a system seem evident, and yet in actual practice the\r\nsafeguards against misuse of power have proved on trial less satisfactory\r\nin such methods than in several others. The history of debased coinage\r\nalready referred to shows that men in power may easily disregard the\r\ninterests of the people, and under popular government both officers and\r\nlegal restraints are subject to changes in the interest of localities and\r\nparties. It is possible that a stable body of experts might manage such an\r\ninstitution under laws as stable as the Constitution with success. But the\r\nrestraints of law are most effective upon institutions outside official\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\nA government bank is subject to extreme pressure from popular demand under\r\nany financial distress to issue currency for general improvements in\r\npublic buildings, parks, etc., which can bring no return and afford no\r\nmeans of redemption. Even the demand of unfortunate debtors for extended\r\nloans may push the bank into excessive issues, and finally lead to the\r\nscaling of debts and currency together in an effort to escape the results\r\nof over-issue.\r\n\r\n_Bank business._—Whatever the organization of a bank, its business must be\r\nessentially the same. It receives deposits from its customers for safe\r\nkeeping and for convenience in use by means of checks. A check is simply\r\nan order to pay, and, if the receiver is a customer of the bank, amounts\r\nto merely a transfer of deposits from one owner to another on the books of\r\nthe bank. A thousand dollars safely kept in the bank vault may thus change\r\nowners a hundred times by means of checks properly recorded. In large\r\ntransactions the check, because of its economy, takes place of any other\r\nform of currency. The bank must also deal in drafts, by which exchanges\r\ncan be made in different cities, and in bills of exchange, distinguished\r\nfrom ordinary drafts by special reference to foreign trade. It may also\r\nhold, as a part of its available machinery, clearing house certificates,\r\nwhich are statements of balances due in the daily settlement between the\r\nbanks belonging to a clearing house association.\r\n\r\nAll these form a part of the machinery of every-day exchange, and together\r\nwith a complete system of book-keeping make the utmost facility in the use\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nThey also greatly economize in the use of money by saving cost of counting\r\nand of transfer, and by securing against losses. If the system offered no\r\nmore advantages than this safe and ready use of good money, the banks\r\nwould be practically indispensable. But they have a still greater use in a\r\nsafe extension of credit. The perfection of system in banking makes it\r\npossible for one who habitually fulfils his promises to purchase anywhere\r\nin the world on the shortest notice with the simple guaranty of credit in\r\nthe bank where he does business. A traveler wishing to have funds in\r\nsafe-keeping, and yet available on a journey around the world, may obtain\r\nthrough a bank familiar with his business standing a letter of credit,\r\nupon which he can draw, wherever he may be, against the deposit in his\r\nfavor, and his draft will be paid, through a series of banks, at the bank\r\nnear his business connections. Thus the credit of the world is bound\r\ntogether by the banking system grown up to meet the necessities of trade.\r\n\r\n_The clearing house._—All forms of credit referred to above, where dealers\r\nare customers of a single bank, are easily brought together upon the books\r\nof that bank, and will practically cancel each other. The customers of\r\nmany banks in large cities may have their checks and drafts brought into a\r\nsingle system of book-keeping through a clearing house, which is simply a\r\nbank of banks. At a certain hour each day, in the larger cities twice a\r\nday, each bank of the city brings to the clearing house all checks and\r\ndrafts against any other banks. These are quickly sorted, charged to the\r\nseveral banks against which they are drawn, and credited to the banks from\r\nwhich they are brought. The balance of debit and credit is settled then\r\nand there, either by transfer of cash, or by issue of a clearing house\r\ncertificate that a bank has a balance in its favor, and so only a small\r\namount of cash is used in settling all transactions of an immense\r\nbusiness. The clearings of a single day reach hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars, and form an index of the business prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nThe system saves the risk and cost of transferring back and forth immense\r\namounts of coin and currency, and brings the business men of the country\r\ninto ready contact with each other. It is an essential part of the means\r\nof settlement between different cities and different countries. A debt in\r\nany part of the world can be paid through a draft on London, which by\r\nmeans of the clearing house and its associated banks can be purchased\r\nanywhere and paid without delay. Since the purchasing power of any part of\r\nthe world is chiefly in what it has to sell, the constant motion of checks\r\nand drafts in opposite directions will balance each other. If there were\r\nno long time credits, the purchases of any city would essentially equal\r\nits sales; and so with perfect clearance all trade would be quickly\r\nadjusted with but little use of money except for retail business.\r\n\r\n_Other clearing systems._—So evident are the advantages of clearing houses\r\nin banking that the system extends to many other interests. Railroad\r\ncorporations balance accounts against each other by exchange of tickets\r\nissued by the different roads. Large combinations of dealers in implements\r\nor other goods find a similar service available where they can work\r\ntogether with confidence. Express companies sharing in a common service\r\ndivide the final proceeds upon the same principle. So evident is the\r\nadvantage that the growth has been rapid during recent years, and seems\r\nlikely to extend still further.\r\n\r\nSome effort has been made to establish farmers’ exchanges upon a similar\r\nplan, but as yet with little success. The obstacles are chiefly in the\r\nwant of business confidence in business habits among the farmers\r\nthemselves. Since the system is strictly a credit system, exact promptness\r\nin meeting engagements and constant dealing in the same channels are\r\nabsolutely necessary. Most farmers, having comparatively few transactions\r\nfrom day to day, are loath to attach themselves as constant customers in\r\nany association. With larger experience and more neighborly contact they\r\nare finding it possible to work in association for various purposes, and\r\nwill doubtless enlarge their means of business credit as their progress in\r\nmutual understanding increases.\r\n\r\n_Government inspection._—The principal support of universal credit through\r\nbanking is the assurance that uniform methods, honest in principle and\r\naccurate in execution, are followed. To secure these results a system of\r\ngovernment inspection and guaranty seems absolutely necessary. If the\r\npublic faith is to be maintained, the ground of that faith must be\r\npublicly established. The more complete the examination by trusted\r\nofficials and the more frequent the publication of official reports, the\r\nbetter the public credit. It seems possible that even individual\r\ntrustworthiness may become a matter of government record as it is now of\r\nprivate consideration in all business circles. One chief guaranty of\r\ncredit through the banks is the strict inquiry made by the banks\r\nthemselves into the business standing of their customers. If the record\r\nwere perfect, the chief weakness of the credit system would be largely\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n_The balance of trade._—The bulk of trade between countries, that is of\r\ndealers in different countries, is settled in the usual routine of banking\r\nas has been indicated; but since under present systems the standards of\r\nvalue are given in different terms in different countries, somewhat more\r\nof friction remains in such trade. A greater attention is given to the\r\nfact of final settlement in coin or bullion. The price of exchange from a\r\ncountry whose dealers owe more than is due them, under the law of supply\r\nand demand, soon arises to an amount sufficient to cover the cost of\r\ntransporting gold or silver. When these metals are used in payment by\r\ntransportation from one country to another they are said to indicate the\r\nbalance of trade; that is, they show that more of other property comes\r\ninto the country than goes out. This balance of trade is supposed to show\r\nthe relative prosperity of a nation, and is said to be against it when the\r\nnation buys more than it sells.\r\n\r\nIt is usually sought in the difference between the value of coin or\r\nbullion exported and of that imported. In two sets of circumstances a\r\nlarge correction is necessary to show the actual condition of trade. One\r\nis where a nation is buying on long credit, as in case of great\r\nenterprises like railroads or factories, constructed by sale of bonds in\r\nforeign countries or by sale of any other securities, government or\r\nindividual, in a foreign land. The other is where a country like our own\r\nis a large producer of gold and silver by mining. In this case the\r\nproducts of the mines are as proper an article of export as the products\r\nof the farms or of the factories, and should be estimated as a part of the\r\nnatural exports. For these reasons the balance of trade must be carefully\r\nscrutinized before being accepted as proof of a nation’s progress in\r\npoverty or wealth.\r\n\r\n_Bank loans._—So far, in dealing with the subject of banking, no mention\r\nhas been made of the function of extending individual credit by time\r\nloans. One of the original purposes of banking was to make a convenient\r\noffice for the meeting of borrowers and lenders. The banks are still the\r\ngo-betweens of those who have money to lend and those who have to borrow.\r\nIn fact, every banking association is assumed to be a corporation of money\r\nlenders. Under ordinary circumstances this corporation is able to loan to\r\nindividuals whose credit is good all of its capital not otherwise employed\r\nin the machinery of the bank, a considerable portion of deposits from its\r\ncustomers, and to a certain extent its own credit in the commercial world.\r\nIn the case of a national bank a portion of capital is loaned to the\r\ngovernment in the purchase of bonds, which are the basis of its\r\ncirculating notes. The circulating notes, from 60 per cent to 90 per cent\r\nof the value of the bonds, are an extension of credit; that is, the\r\ncapital already loaned on time to the government is partially loaned again\r\nto individuals. Again, the deposits of the customers, to be drawn as\r\nneeded, in ordinary circumstances are not needed the same day. The bank\r\nsoon learns by experience what portion it is safe to lend from day to day\r\nto individuals who are sure to make payments when promised. Double\r\nsignatures, or endorsements, double the surety of prompt payment.\r\n\r\nThus the banks are enabled to provide safe keeping for money without\r\ncharge, and even to pay a low rate of interest upon considerable deposits\r\nwhen times are good. In this way legitimate borrowers and legitimate\r\nlenders find a close connection in the bank. A legitimate lender is one\r\nwho has property not needed at present for his own use. A legitimate\r\nborrower is one who can use capital to advantage in production. Any\r\nproducer may at one part of a year be a lender and afterward a borrower to\r\nadvantage of everybody. If the banks are thoroughly satisfactory the\r\nproceeds of the fall crops may serve the busy manufacturers as circulating\r\ncapital during the winter. Again, the proceeds of the spring sales of\r\ngoods and machinery may tide the farmers over the season of growth.\r\n\r\nIn this way labor of every kind is sustained by labor of every other kind.\r\nIn all these ways the banking power of a country is extended to several\r\ntimes the coin money in circulation, and that with perfect safety. But it\r\nis possible for banks to be tempted through the very perfection of their\r\nown credit. The note of an individual has no established market value. A\r\ndeposit in the bank is valued as cash. It is possible to secure the credit\r\nof having a bank deposit by discounting an individual note. If that note\r\nis a time note the bank has increased its immediate liabilities by the\r\namount of a nominal deposit, with only a promise to pay in the future to\r\nrest upon. To lend to an individual is practically to enter into\r\npartnership with his fortune. The fortunes of the group of individuals\r\nrepresenting the bank is less doubtful than that of any one person. The\r\nborrower in this instance pays in the discount of his note the difference\r\nin risk between his fortune and that of the combination. Such deposits\r\npurchased upon credit must be distinguished from deposits of cash, lest\r\nthe bank should nominally increase its power to lend while in fact it has\r\nalready lent up to its ability. Sometimes such nominal deposits are\r\nmaintained by persons deeply in debt for the sake of paying a larger rate\r\nof interest than is allowed by law.\r\n\r\n_Safety of banking._—In times of business prosperity a bank with usual\r\nbusiness caution as to customers, is safe for all concerned. And yet, in\r\nthe very nature of extended credit, it has promised to pay on any\r\nparticular day, if demanded, far more than it has cash in hand. Its\r\nliabilities embrace the whole of its deposits except a small portion made\r\nfor a definite time, and all its issues of currency subject to redemption.\r\nTo meet these engagements its immediate resources are whatever currency in\r\nany form of coin or bills it may have at hand. This amount, since its\r\nprofits are made from lending, not from holding, must be small in\r\nproportion to its liabilities. The bulk of its means of payment is in\r\nnotes not yet due, and to be collected when due. Of other property it is\r\nlikely to have bonds of municipalities or of great corporations, and these\r\nare supposed to be a more available form of resources than individual\r\nnotes, because they usually have a definite market value and can be sold\r\nor used as security for loans in any money market. If real estate forms a\r\npart of the capital, it can never be made available for immediate use.\r\nHence any bank dealing in mortgages on real estate invests its funds where\r\nthey cannot be had when wanted. All banking schemes based upon security in\r\nland have necessarily failed, because land has no current use in trade.\r\n\r\nUnder the pressure of panic, from whatever source, each depositor is sure\r\nto demand every cent due him from the bank, and just as certainly the\r\nbank’s own resources are insufficient to meet those dues without the sale\r\nof bonds and notes in other markets. For these reasons in any great period\r\nof distrust the banks are obliged to suspend payments. Since all the banks\r\nof the community are in similar circumstances they cannot help each other,\r\nand time must be given for the collection of loans, according to\r\nagreement, that the gradual accumulation of ready cash may return to the\r\nvault, and so to the depositors, all that has been loaned. Because of this\r\nnecessary instability bankers watch most carefully the tendencies of the\r\nmoney market, and necessarily reduce their loans for safety when any\r\nanxious pressure begins. For the same reason legitimate banking is limited\r\nto short time loans—on demand, thirty, sixty, ninety days—the shorter\r\nbeing the safer. Laws sometimes prohibit a bank from dealing in any other\r\nbusiness, where a stock of goods must tie up funds, or from speculation in\r\nreal estate, which confines capital more certainly.\r\n\r\nIn most banks the amount to be loaned to a single individual or firm is\r\nlimited to a small portion, one-tenth to one-fifth, of the total capital.\r\nThe principal causes of failure in banking are defalcation of officers,\r\nmisuse of funds in speculative enterprises, dealing in speculative\r\nsecurities or on boards of trade, careless loaning to poor paymasters,\r\ninvestment in long time securities not readily marketable, or sacrifice in\r\nhurried sale of stocks and bonds under the pressure of panic.\r\n\r\nThe better the customers of a bank understand its condition and\r\nmanagement, the less is its danger, for the basis of banking, as of the\r\ncredit of the world, is the public confidence. Farmers who acquaint\r\nthemselves with the workings of neighboring banks by making use of their\r\naid in business benefit both themselves and their neighbors. The progress\r\nof the world demands of every farmer a closer contact with business and,\r\ntherefore, a greater familiarity with business methods. Even the burden of\r\ndebts will be lessened when farmers understand and appreciate the\r\nadvantage of systematic credit. The dangers from over expansion of credit\r\nare lessened when all the people clearly understand the essential\r\nconditions for maintaining credit. The final perfection of a banking\r\nsystem depends upon the interest of the whole people, with a fair\r\nknowledge of the growth already made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII. Deferred Settlement And Credit Expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general bearing of settlement in trade, deferred by promises to pay in\r\nthe distant future, has been several times referred to in preceding\r\nchapters; but its bearing upon the general welfare is so marked in many\r\nways as to deserve more particular treatment. The special form by which\r\none man becomes a purchaser on the strength of future abilities may have\r\nlittle importance in the total result, but some peculiarities of the\r\ndifferent forms are worthy of mention.\r\n\r\nA _standing account_ without definite period of settlement easily becomes\r\na temptation to waste, as well as a source of worry, when the account is\r\nextended. A friend remarks, “You never seem so well off as when you don’t\r\nexpect to pay for what you buy, although the reason may be that you can’t\r\npay for it.” The fact that the day of settlement may be indefinitely\r\npostponed makes the temptation to overestimate the chances of future\r\nability. An account almost certainly insures the purchase of ordinary\r\nsupplies without asking the price, and only frequent and complete\r\nsettlement makes safe for ordinary people the expenditure of income\r\nthrough store accounts.\r\n\r\n_Promissory notes_ due at a definite time have less effect upon the\r\nimagination; yet payment a year hence seems always easier than payment\r\nnow. Only repeated bitter experiences teach one to say, as I once heard an\r\nold gentleman, when offered a horse to replace his dead one without limit\r\nas to the time of payment, “That sounds very well, my friend, but it is a\r\nmighty hard way at the latter end.” Every farmer familiar with country\r\nauctions, with a year’s credit upon purchases, sees the effect of such\r\npostponements in magnifying the value of articles purchased.\r\n\r\nA note secured by _chattel mortgage_ in the nature of the security is less\r\nextended and has the distinct hardship of future payment presented in the\r\npossible loss of the chattel offered as security. The chattel mortgage,\r\ntherefore, becomes a favorite method for short time delays in payment, not\r\nonly because the security is good, but because the full attention of the\r\nmaker is given to the necessity of payment.\r\n\r\nA most familiar form of deferred payment for farm property is the\r\n_mortgage note_, secured by a deed entitling the holder to take possession\r\nof the farm, or real estate of any kind, upon failure of the maker of the\r\nnote to meet its conditions. This is esteemed the best possible security\r\nfor payments long deferred, because the ordinary values of real estate in\r\na growing country like ours increase rather than diminish. Except in cases\r\nof overvaluation from speculative investment, or in the settlement of a\r\nnew country under misconception of its conditions, the security remains\r\nample. And even then the lender has no greater risk than the borrower.\r\nSince final settlement by foreclosure of mortgage involves the law’s\r\ndelay, increased by the natural sentiment growing up about a home which\r\nhas been occupied for years, such mortgage notes are only to a limited\r\nextent available in general commerce. In large measure they are likely to\r\nstand between the original purchaser and seller. The exception to this is\r\nfound in investment of large trust funds, as with insurance companies and\r\nendowments of colleges and other benevolent institutions. In these cases a\r\npermanent investment, with stated income, is desirable, and mortgage notes\r\nwith five to ten years’ credit give better rates of income than long time\r\nbonds of great corporations or governments. The ease with which purchase\r\nis made by a mortgage tempts many a young man to promise more than he can\r\nfulfil. The weight of the farm mortgage is felt throughout the country,\r\ndoubling the disaster of every deficient crop. Variations from the\r\nmortgage in deeds of trust and instalment contracts have essentially the\r\nsame relation to credit, involve essentially the same burdens, and differ\r\nonly in the legal forms for taking possession of the real estate in\r\ndefault of payment.\r\n\r\nWhere a company or a community defers payment for its purchases, it is\r\nsaid to issue _bonds_, which are simply formal notes, usually with\r\nattached notes, or coupons, for interest at stated times, issued by\r\nqualified officers under specific legislation. These are so easily\r\nunderstood and tested for their quality as to become a part of the general\r\ncredit of the country. They gain a well understood market value, and pass\r\nfrom hand to hand with greatest readiness. This fact adds to the ease with\r\nwhich they may be issued, while the extended time, from ten to thirty\r\nyears, increases both the convenience of possession and the readiness to\r\nissue. The people of a city do not hesitate to supply themselves with\r\nmagnificent waterworks at the expense of the people a generation later.\r\nThus municipal indebtedness is easy to contract, and the hard lesson of\r\npaying for dead horses is seldom effectually learned. More insidious still\r\nis the temptation to issue the bonds of a county for the building of a\r\nrailroad, whose prospective benefit in adding to the value of lands is\r\nindefinitely magnified. A community of farmers already burdened by\r\nmortgages can be tempted into additional burdens in county bonds from\r\nexpectation that a new railroad will double the value of their farms. The\r\nfacility with which states and nations negotiate bonds is so well\r\nunderstood that it scarcely needs mention. Yet the burdens of taxation so\r\ngrievously felt are often self-inflicted by the people who favor unbounded\r\nindebtedness. It is rarely the case that a well-to-do school district is\r\nnot better off when it meets the cost of its schoolhouse by immediate\r\ntaxes rather than to postpone payment by bonds.\r\n\r\nThe organization of a _stock company_ involves a peculiar system of\r\ndeferred payments, in that every holder of stock becomes in a sense both\r\ndebtor and creditor. He is debtor to all his associate shareholders, and\r\nis also their creditor to the extent of his share. _Stock certificates_,\r\nlike bonds, may pass from hand to hand with ease, and foster the innate\r\nspirit of speculation among a commercial people. The organization of a\r\nstock company, especially of a great trust, is made relatively easy from\r\nthis fact, and in this way the general credit of a people is indefinitely\r\nextended. A prosperous corporation is likely to distribute the results of\r\nits prosperity by increased issues of stock, and the readiness with which\r\nthe public accepts such issues makes natural, though vicious, the\r\nso-called _watering of stock_, familiar to all. The immediate object of\r\nwatered stock in fairly managed companies is the immediate distribution\r\namong shareholders of any increased value without increased cost. As the\r\nfarms along a line of railway may have doubled their value with no\r\nexpenditure in improvements, so the railroad itself may have doubled its\r\nvalue in the possibility of earnings through the rapid development of\r\nsettlements along the line. In ordinary ways this increased value will be\r\nshown in the market price of the stock, but an issue of more stock to the\r\npresent holders of stock certificates will keep down the price of\r\nindividual shares and yet give the benefit of the increased value to\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\n_The stock exchange._—The last mentioned forms of indebtedness so easily\r\nbecome matters of everyday purchase and sale as to lead to the business of\r\nstock brokerage, found everywhere in greater or less extent. In large\r\ncities the brokers naturally unite for convenience of business in the\r\nso-called stock exchange, in which the market price of all current forms\r\nof indebtedness or deferred payments is fixed from day to day, or from\r\nhour to hour, by the higgling of the market, just as the price of produce\r\nis fixed in the produce exchange. Naturally, as in the case of produce, a\r\nfictitious business, purely speculative, grows up around the legitimate\r\ndealing in stocks and bonds. Other forms of deferred payments enter less\r\ninto the business of the brokers, because the market value of any\r\nparticular mortgage or individual note cannot be easily determined outside\r\nthe immediate neighborhood where it is made. The chief way in which these\r\nenter the general brokers’ market is through the stock or bonds of large\r\nbrokers’ companies, sometimes called guaranty loan companies. In this way\r\nthe universal extension of credit through deferred payments finally has\r\nits effect upon the general confidence. The broker’s business grows\r\nlegitimately out of the need of ready transfer of claims, for the sake of\r\nlarger use of the floating capital of the country, and readiness of\r\ninvestment in more fixed forms. It adds, however, to the dangers of\r\nextended credit by making more easy the gratification of present wants\r\nthrough expectation of future ability. The broker makes his gain, without\r\nreference to the final settlement, by taking a commission upon the loan.\r\nHis interest leads to an overestimate of the borrower’s ability, and cases\r\nare not infrequent where appraisers of real estate have been hired by\r\nbrokers to misrepresent the value of property, for the sake of securing\r\nimproper loans.\r\n\r\nEvery period of expanding credit in speculative movements has furnished\r\nproofs of this tendency. A standing example is furnished in mining stocks,\r\nin which the temptation to misrepresent prospects by “salting” and false\r\nassays is proverbial. Almost as notorious are the misrepresentations\r\nassociated with bonds of newly established cities or other municipalities.\r\nNot all such misrepresentation is intended fraud, but the immediate\r\ninterest of the broker clouds his judgment as to conditions of final\r\nsettlement. With little to lose and everything to gain in the immediate\r\ntransaction, his judgment is necessarily biased. The merely speculative\r\nbuying and selling of stocks by margins has little to do with the general\r\ncharacter of indebtedness, except to increase somewhat the risks of\r\nlegitimate brokerage. The “bulls and bears” on exchange make their gains\r\nby fluctuations in market values, and, like all gamblers, delight in\r\nproducing false impressions upon their opponents in the game. This fact\r\nadds to the uncertainty of all standing credit, and so increases the\r\nnatural rate of interest. This effect upon interest will be noticed in\r\nconsidering the nature of interest and conditions affecting it.\r\n\r\n“_Borrowed money._”—In all the forms of deferred payment, except standing\r\naccounts, it is customary to represent the amount of the debt as “borrowed\r\nmoney,” no matter how the transaction occurs. When a farmer buys his farm\r\nwith a promise to pay five years hence, his note is said to represent so\r\nmuch “borrowed money,” while in fact he has simply borrowed the farm. The\r\nreason is, that the farm is represented by its value in dollars, and the\r\npromise is to return that value in dollars at the end of five years.\r\n\r\nThe same is true, in fact, of all purchases on credit. Even when the\r\npurchase is made by means of a note at the bank, the actual transfer of\r\nproperty is from the owner of the farm to its prospective owner, the bank\r\nsimply acting as agent, and interposing its credit or capital only to\r\npromote the exchange. In many instances no money in any form is used, and\r\nwhere it is employed at some stage of the transaction, it is used, as in\r\nany other exchange, simply as a machine of transfer. Even the final\r\nsettlement is likely to be made through the ordinary channels of trade,\r\nwithout the intervention of money in any of its forms. The deferred\r\npayment takes its place when the time of payment comes in the ordinary\r\neveryday transactions of the universal credit system, illustrated in\r\nbanking. Even if the farm is paid for by instalments, those instalments\r\nare simply ordinary transactions in trade, the farmer transferring the\r\ncheck which he receives from the sale of his steers or his wheat to the\r\nformer owner of the farm. The money involved is simply money of account,\r\nreferring to a well understood standard of value. The importance of this\r\nstandard in reference to deferred payments has already been referred to.\r\nIt cannot be overestimated. But any estimate of the currency needed, or to\r\nbe needed for the transaction of business, founded upon the amount of\r\ndeferred payments, is wholly fallacious.\r\n\r\nIt is equally wrong to suppose that the bankers are the principal\r\nmoney-lenders. The real lenders are those who have sold their produce, the\r\nuse of their tools or their time, at a price to be paid next week, next\r\nmonth or next year. Every man who has wages due him is as truly a\r\nmoney-lender, to the extent of the wages due, as any banker who accepts a\r\npromise to pay in the future for service or value given in the present.\r\nEven where the borrowed articles have been consumed or wasted, the promise\r\nto pay is simply a promise to return so much of value as the articles\r\nreceived were estimated to be worth. This may be easily seen in thinking\r\nof a running account at the store for the ordinary supplies of the family.\r\nIt may amount to five hundred dollars, if one’s credit is sufficient, and\r\nseem only the actual articles used, and yet to be paid for; but if settled\r\nby a note fixing a future definite time of payment, the debt at once\r\nbecomes in thought borrowed money, though no change whatever has been made\r\nin the actual facts. If the same purchases had been made by means of\r\ncredit at the bank, gained by discounting a personal note, the same\r\narticles exactly would have been borrowed, the bank instead of the\r\nmerchant being the lender. In all probability the bank has been the means\r\nin the first case of enabling the merchant to meet these current wants on\r\ncredit, for he himself has gained the credit of the bank by discounting\r\nhis own note. In either case the bank has been the means of serving both\r\nthe borrower and the lender. It is simply a machine for accommodating\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n_Legal tender._—All forms of deferred payments imply the possible\r\nintervention in final settlement of the force of government. While the\r\ngreat mass of promises to pay are met without an appeal to laws or courts,\r\nthe whole is put in such form by customs of society as to involve the\r\npossibility of such arbitration. Government takes no note of debts which\r\ncannot be proved in court, and the forms of legal proof are well settled.\r\nAll the formalities of credit in systems of book-keeping, forms of notes\r\nand bonds, and wording of stock certificates imply the possibility of\r\nfinal adjustment in a court of equity. For this reason, governments\r\nestablish some form of currency as the representative of value, which must\r\nbe accepted by the creditor in complete satisfaction of a debt. This is\r\nnaturally what custom has established as the standard of value, but\r\nanything else may be substituted if the government so decides. Thus,\r\nMassachusetts once made bullets legal tender at a certain price, up to a\r\ncertain number. Our government now makes copper cents and nickels legal\r\ntender to the value of twenty-five cents.\r\n\r\nThe current notes of the government are usually legal tender, unless\r\notherwise stipulated, whatever their current value. This means simply that\r\nthe government through its courts secures the collection of _bona fide_\r\ndebts, in terms of value defined by law or by contract. The assurance of\r\nfinal settlement, given in this way by the government, is one principal\r\nelement in extending credit on time. Without such machinery credit would\r\nbe confined to intimate acquaintances and very limited time.\r\n\r\n_Expanding credit._—All the machinery of credit tends to bring the\r\nfloating capital of a country within the reach of great enterprises. If a\r\nbody of men have faith in some great undertaking, like a continental\r\nrailroad or a Panama canal, their faith in the enterprise is easily made a\r\nbasis for the faith of others. Even the small accumulations, the savings\r\nof day laborers, may be turned to account in such great enterprises if the\r\npopular expectation of success is thoroughly aroused. The greater the\r\nundertaking, the greater is the general faith under skilful leadership.\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies to undertakings of less national character,\r\nlike immense factories or combinations in a trust. The stock of such\r\nenterprises is often widely distributed, and when profits are fairly\r\nbegun, even upon a small scale, the chances of gain on the value of the\r\nstock are made more prominent than the actual profits of the enterprise.\r\nIt is not uncommon to find enterprises starting with the expectation that\r\na large portion of this stock will be paid for out of the profits of the\r\nbusiness and the profits on a portion of the stock to be sold. This is\r\nespecially true when business is reviving after a period of depression. It\r\nis one of the first symptoms of the return of a speculative spirit. With\r\nthe rise of such enterprises there is almost sure to be an advance in\r\nprices of real estate, though it follows later.\r\n\r\nThe starting of a railroad line involves the purchase of station sites,\r\nand almost surely the laying out of villages at intervals along the line.\r\nThe promoters of the railroad are likely to be promoters of town sites as\r\nwell. And this increased demand for farms and lots brings a larger faith\r\nin the future of these locations. Everyone who can save a little from his\r\nincome hopes to increase that little indefinitely by investment in the\r\nchances of increased value of a lot or a home. Under such circumstances\r\nthe machinery of credit moves easily, and one does not hesitate to extend\r\nhis credit to the utmost for the purchase of what is increasing in value\r\neach day. The result is a temptation to larger expenditures.\r\n\r\nPeople who are counting their future gains are sure to have larger wants,\r\nand their seeming prosperity in accumulation of value gives them a larger\r\ncredit among dealers. The next step is an enlargement of sales of current\r\nsupplies of all sorts and an increasing manufacture of such supplies to\r\nmeet the increasing wants and naturally enhancing price. Soon the staple\r\nproducts of farms and factories and mines become themselves objects of\r\nspeculative purchase. Men buy simply to hold for the increase in price.\r\nThis speculation itself is a temporary cause of success, and goes on until\r\nsome accident somewhere reveals the exaggerated proportions of\r\nexpectation. Sometimes this speculative spirit continues for a series of\r\nyears, in which case it pervades every circle of producers and consumers.\r\nSometimes it is temporary and local, being produced by some special\r\nundertaking and destroyed by a special failure. Sometimes the death of an\r\nenterprising man destroys the \"boom\" he has created. When speculation is\r\nrife over a large territory, everybody is employed to his utmost ability,\r\nand the times are said to be good. All property of every kind is counted\r\nat its highest price in the mind of the owner, and all credits are easily\r\nextended from month to month, or from year to year, because of the\r\nuniversal faith. There seems to the casual observer no reason for doubt,\r\nand the most conservative judges overestimate the ability of the people.\r\n\r\n_Financial crisis._—At such a time as that described, when credits of\r\nevery kind are interlocked and expectations are high, the so-called\r\nfloating capital of the country, under indefinite promises to pay, is\r\ngradually being actually locked up in huge plants of machinery in great\r\nrailroad routes, in vacant city lots, and uncultivated farms held for\r\nfuture sale, or in warehouses and elevators full of the products of\r\nindustry,—especially such products as do not immediately deteriorate in\r\nquality, such as grains, cloths, raw materials of every kind and machinery\r\nof general use. This is apparently the property of the holders, but\r\nagainst it are the claims of all those who have contributed by loans on\r\ntime, by credit for sales, by labor unpaid for and by provisions on\r\naccount. One can easily see that with all these people bound together by\r\ncredit a single failure may be far-reaching in its effects. The inability\r\nof a single man to meet his promises, if those promises are widely enough\r\ndistributed, may bring a panic among his creditors, their creditors, and\r\nso on down to even the solid men, supposed to hold the accumulation of\r\nyears untouched by speculation. For every channel of trade is full of\r\ncredit, which now everybody loses.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the promoter of the Northern Pacific railroad had borrowed\r\neverywhere, even the small savings of widows and workmen, through his\r\nintimate connection with banking. All this accumulation of savings had\r\nbeen expended for labor upon what was only a huge embankment, making no\r\npossible returns to any owner. The only possible means of continuing the\r\nwork was continued borrowing, or the sale of additional stock. The revenue\r\npromised upon the means already used could be given only by larger\r\nborrowing. On a certain day the amount to be borrowed was less than the\r\namount to be paid, and the failure of Jay Cooke to meet his expectations\r\nand promises was known. Within six hours every village in the land felt\r\nthe disaster. The financial crisis was seen and realized. Bargains\r\npartially completed were stopped in the midst. Materials about to be\r\nshipped were held at the station. Deposits at the bank were needed\r\nimmediately, notes due at the bank could not be extended, collectors of\r\naccounts appeared at every corner, thousands of workmen directly and\r\nindirectly employed on the great railroad building were out of employment\r\nand out of wages due, the banks were unable to furnish even paper currency\r\nto their depositors, and the whole world felt absolute loss of confidence\r\nin any undertaking or any expectation.\r\n\r\nI select this particular panic because its beginning was so comparatively\r\nsimple, its progress so evident and its results so well defined. Any other\r\nfailure of speculative purpose might have been equally disastrous. It\r\ncould hardly have been so rapid, because it could not have been so\r\ndirectly distributed among the masses of the people. Yet the machinery of\r\ncredit is such that any considerable failure in enterprise or speculation\r\nis felt everywhere. The banks are at once called upon for larger loans and\r\nfor deposits together, an impossibility in the nature of the case. All\r\nexchangeable forms of credit are immediately offered in market at\r\nconstantly decreasing prices. Current credit of every kind is checked, and\r\nexchange is limited to the barest necessities. All productive energies are\r\npractically stopped, except such as are out of the line of daily\r\nexchanges. Very soon all domestic expenses are reduced to the lowest\r\nnotch, domestic help is discharged, the well-to-do undertake to help\r\nthemselves, and the poor are left without resources. It seems as if all\r\nthe wheels of progress had stopped.\r\n\r\n_Hard times._—Succeeding such a crisis must follow hard times. Wage\r\nearners generally are without employment; manufactories have put out their\r\nfires; the warehouses full of goods are under attachment; farm produce is\r\nmoved very slowly to market; fancy stock of horses, cattle and sheep are\r\nunsalable; farm mortgages are foreclosed as rapidly as the laws allow;\r\nskilled workmen meet absolute necessities by half time, and common\r\nlaborers move from place to place in useless search for employment, their\r\nfamilies being barely kept alive by charity. The fact that warehouses and\r\ngranaries are full leads to the assumption that over-production has\r\ndestroyed the market and the demand for labor. This is quite probably true\r\nof all articles of such a nature as to be held for speculative purposes.\r\nThe staple grains and fancy live stock are illustrations of these. An\r\nuniversal over-production, so long as the articles produced are adapted to\r\ncurrent wants, is impossible, since every man’s product, if needed, is his\r\nmeans of securing another man’s product to meet his own wants.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the suffering of multitudes and the abstinence of\r\neverybody lead to the supposition that under-consumption, or failure to\r\nuse what we might, is a principal cause. It is undoubtedly true that fear\r\nof absolute want checks consumption of articles within our reach. This is\r\nshown by the immediate increase of consumption as soon as the fear\r\nsubsides. This, however, is a symptom of the times, rather than a cause.\r\n\r\nSome theorists account for the suffering by the ratio of the currency to\r\nthe population, claiming that a larger circulation of money will fill the\r\nempty pockets of the needy, forgetting that money circulates only through\r\nthe very channels of trade which something else has stopped. It is quite\r\ntrue that any financial legislation involving uncertain results\r\ncontributes materially to the doubt which stops the machinery. All efforts\r\nto make money worth less by legislation have invariably extended the\r\nperiod of hard times. Almost every conceivable cause has been assigned, or\r\ngiven as a partial explanation, for the stagnation of trade. A careful\r\nanalysis of these recurring periods in the history of our country in 1837,\r\n1848, 1857, 1873, 1887 and 1893, shows many partial causes of disaster in\r\nexchange, affecting the peculiar nature of each panic, yet one especial\r\ncause is evident in them all. That cause is large investment in fixed\r\ncapital from which no immediate returns can be expected.\r\n\r\n_The chief causes of hard times._—Prior to 1837 there was a rapid\r\ndevelopment of new country, as shown from the greatly increased receipts\r\nfor public lands. Every new home involves a permanent investment of\r\nsomebody’s savings to the extent of at least $1,000. With the settlement\r\nof every new region a considerable waste in real estate speculation is\r\nfound. A similar expansion of territory occupied by settlement immediately\r\nfollowed the Mexican war, and was a chief cause of reduced capital and\r\nconsequent lack of employment.\r\n\r\nThe crisis of 1857 was preceded by enormous waste in the Crimean war. To\r\nthat was added the loss of a season’s labor in a bad harvest and increase\r\nof cost of living, reducing profits. The latter cause was incidental to\r\nthis particular season, but added materially to the suffering. In this\r\ncountry there had also been an extensive enlargement in iron works and\r\nwoolen factories without corresponding products.\r\n\r\nThe panic of 1867, felt widely outside of America, was preceded by immense\r\nwaste of property in the civil war of the United States, a considerable\r\nportion of which expense, on both sides, had been borne in Europe, either\r\nduring the war or immediately following, through the sale of bonds.\r\n\r\nThe panic of 1873 followed immense investments of wealth in fixed capital,\r\nas illustrated in the Northern Pacific railroad, previously mentioned.\r\nBetween 1865 and 1873 30,000 miles of railroad were built in the United\r\nStates alone. This permanent investment involved immense debts at home and\r\nabroad, _with all the profits yet in the future_. The fact that imports\r\nincreased at the rate of nearly $100,000,000 a year in 1871 and 1872\r\nindicates the extent of expenditures. The Franco-Prussian war had also\r\nwasted great energies.\r\n\r\nThe hard times in America, shown especially in the price of farms, about\r\n1888 were immediately preceded by enormous investments in unsatisfactory\r\nfarming lands and unneeded town sites, as well as in railroad building.\r\nForty-nine million acres of land were sold by the government, and more\r\nthan 12,000 miles of railway were built. Enormous expenditures were also\r\nmade for school-houses, court-houses, and other public buildings by sale\r\nof bonds. The actual crisis was perhaps delayed and a new speculation\r\nfostered by large payments on the public debt. Again, there was expansion\r\nof credit and large investment in railroad and city building in\r\nanticipation of future growth, during which the small savings of\r\nmultitudes had been gathered up through the guaranty loan companies of the\r\nWest. Upon the top of this came the expenditures of 1892 and 1893 on the\r\ngreat World’s Exposition. The expenditure of savings in attendance upon\r\nthe exposition curtailed the abilities of hundreds of thousands of\r\nfamilies. So the panic of 1893 was in no respect an exception to the rule.\r\nNo sufficient data are at hand for showing exactly how great has been the\r\nexpenditure in unproductive enterprises, but a reference to Chart No. IV,\r\np. 83, giving the development of railroad building in this country, will\r\nshow how this form of enterprise in every case outran the increase in\r\npopulation immediately preceding the hard times.\r\n\r\nIt is evident to any student of the question that extra large consumption\r\nof floating capital has immediately preceded every period of supposed\r\nover-production. The chief over-production has always been in the\r\nmachinery of production and trade, including the costly settlement of new\r\nland. The immediate dismissal of labor employed in such enterprises brings\r\ngreatest suffering, because such laborers are always least forehanded and\r\nare in large numbers homeless. Such laborers also most readily become\r\ncompetitors for any kind of a job, and so affect current wages of those\r\nstill retaining their places. This emphasizes the unequal distribution of\r\nwealth, and leads multitudes to call for a redistribution, by fair means\r\nor foul. This increases the distrust of community and the disposition to\r\nhoard wealth in the form of money, while checking every desire to build\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\n_Remedies for hard times._—The means of recovery from such a disaster are\r\nless easy to see than the causes. We know, in fact, that the world does\r\nrecover confidence among enterprising men and confidence in the future,\r\nsometimes surprisingly soon. We can see some of the steps by which the\r\nburden of debt is diminished and hopes are revived. In the first place,\r\nsome method of settlement out of the usual course is adopted. Most obvious\r\nis an agreement among banks to carry on the usual machinery of exchanges\r\nthrough checks, drafts and a clearing house without the use of currency.\r\nThis is called suspension of payment. It holds the deposits steady while\r\nthe transfer of ownership is easy. It saves the sacrifice of large credit\r\nto meet the panicky condition of small trade, and it checks the\r\ndisposition to hoard money in out-of-the-way places. The actual failures\r\nare thus confined to those actually engaged in the wasted production or\r\ndirectly involved as creditors of such persons. The failures in 1873 were\r\nsaid to have been nine in each thousand business houses; those of 1893\r\nwere thirteen in a thousand. The actual failures among farmers are\r\nconfined almost entirely to those who have been caught in the speculative\r\nspirit of investment in more land for the sake of increasing prices or\r\nhave borrowed capital to be used in other speculation. A few only have\r\nwasted their substance in expensive homes and luxuries.\r\n\r\nIf all forms of indebtedness could circulate freely, the final result in\r\nbalancing debts with debts would be quite readily reached, and the actual\r\nlosses would be found less than is generally supposed. An equal loss\r\nwithout distrust, if that were possible, would be met with new enterprise\r\nand extra energy instead of despondency.\r\n\r\nThe various remedies offered in proposed legislation frequently add to the\r\ndelays in the recovery of confidence. The issue of paper currency, while\r\nuniversally welcomed by the most wasteful of investors, makes those who\r\nstill have property more doubtful as to the future. The proposition to\r\nincrease demand for labor by great public improvements comes at a time\r\nwhen revenues are diminished and almost surely is coupled with a proposal\r\nof government scrip. To increase the burden of taxation at once, when the\r\nmass of the people are already burdened and distressed, is impossible. The\r\nissue of scrip, though actually a costly method of taxation, seems to the\r\nunthinking a way of making something out of nothing. The certain effect is\r\nto extend the period of doubt. Laws affecting the coinage and character of\r\nlegal tender, since they disturb the relation of borrower and lender\r\nindefinitely, postpone readjustment of confidence. Changes in the tariff\r\nlaws are liable to have the same effect because of uncertainty as to where\r\nthe influence will be most felt. Special legislation with reference to\r\ncontracts for labor, however well intended, are sure to hinder adjustment,\r\nand all agitation in favor of new experiments in government enterprises or\r\nin legislation as to property makes less available the capital and\r\ningenuity of the people.\r\n\r\n_Cure for hard times._—The only genuine cure involves a restoration of\r\nfaith in enterprise. It is almost as hard to establish after a commercial\r\npanic as after a panic in an army. The remedies best worth study are\r\nreally preventives, in the form of checks upon undue expansion of credits\r\nand distinct limits as to extension of time. Some have gone so far as to\r\nwish there were no laws for collection of debts, since this would actually\r\nprevent the great bulk of indebtedness; but it would also destroy the\r\nessential foundation of daily credit, one of the most productive machines\r\nof exchange. The best that can be done is to make more explicit the laws\r\nagainst frauds, and to limit easily transferred forms of credit to those\r\nwhose foundation can be carefully inspected. It is very desirable that all\r\ncorporations dealing in credit should be subject to the strictest\r\nexamination by a public officer.\r\n\r\n_Short credits vs. hard times._—More important than legal enactments are\r\nthe business habits of a community, and these can be cultivated by\r\nbusiness men. Farmers, of all classes of people, can foster such customs\r\nof careful inspection of business standing and frequent settlement of\r\naccounts and careful loaning as will make a panic less possible. They\r\nneed, however, a wider acquaintance with the machinery of business and a\r\nfirmer faith in the advantage to all concerned of cash payments and\r\nabsolute promptness in all settlements. The moral power of such a body,\r\namounting to one-half the population, most of whom are solid owners of\r\nproperty, would, if well informed and united in principle, check most of\r\nthe extravagances in expenditure and investment which waste the capital of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n_Bankruptcy._—In closing the discussion of hard times, it is proper to\r\nmention a device for removing in part the discouragement of debts where\r\nability to pay is entirely wanting. Of course, a settlement between debtor\r\nand creditors, in which the property of the debtor is divided among his\r\ncreditors, is always available, leaving both at liberty to begin business\r\nanew with a knowledge of the worst that can happen. It seems possible to\r\ncontrive bankruptcy laws in such shape as to secure a fair settlement of\r\ninsolvent business whenever the business is evidently failing. If\r\ndiscovery of fraud or misrepresentation could cause immediate intervention\r\nin a bankruptcy court, the surest possible check would be brought to bear\r\nupon improper credits. It is certainly to the interest of all honest\r\ncreditors and debtors that a fair settlement should be reached as early\r\nafter insolvency as possible. Such bankrupt laws should be as wide\r\nreaching in their uniformity as government permits. If a national bankrupt\r\nlaw is not sufficient, the states should combine to establish in each the\r\nsame general system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII. Technical Division Of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Economy of minute division._—The advantages, limits and disadvantages of\r\nminute division of labor are worthy of a more careful discussion, since\r\nthey bear upon every kind of enterprise and all classes of labor. A large\r\npart of the century’s progress in manufacture, and especially the\r\ndevelopment of machinery in production, has grown out of the extension of\r\nthis principle of division. An analysis of the particulars by which great\r\nsaving is made in the cost of production will help us not only to\r\nunderstand the facts better, but to extend the principle in various\r\ndirections. In the outset it implies the united effort of several workmen\r\nin succession and in close combination upon a single product. It is said\r\nthat a pocket knife, which we buy for fifty cents, has involved in its\r\nmanufacture the services of seventy-two different persons, doing different\r\nthings. The perfection of its finish depends upon the perfection of each\r\nof these persons in his single act. The cheapness depends upon the\r\nreadiness with which each act is performed, and the utility of every kind\r\nof power employed.\r\n\r\nA good illustration of division of labor may be found in the process of\r\nbutchering hogs in a large packing house. The live hogs enter the building\r\nin the upper story, while able to carry themselves on their own feet.\r\nTheir weight then moves them easily on through all the stages of the\r\nprocess. Two men catch the hogs by hooking a short chain about the hind\r\nleg and slipping it into the notch of an endless chain power, which hoists\r\nthem to the carrier, a continuous track upon which a roller attached to\r\nthe chain may easily move. A single man wields the knife which sticks the\r\nhogs. Two men are sufficient to manage the scalding trough. One directs\r\nthe machine through which the body of each hog is jerked to remove by\r\nbrushes the mass of hair. Four, perhaps, may handle scrapers as the hogs\r\nare dropped upon a platform, and six more may use the shaving knives by\r\nwhich every particle of hair is removed. Two are needed with different\r\ntools for beheading; and one makes place for the gambrel. Two remove the\r\nfeet at opposite ends, three with different implements are needed in\r\nremoving entrails, two are required to halve the body, while another gives\r\nit the final washing. The result is that each hog has passed from the pen\r\nto the cooling room in less than ten minutes, and the hogs pass under the\r\nhands of these several men at the rate of eight a minute. Each man uses\r\nbut one tool in one particular spot, and repeats that single act\r\nconstantly. By a similar division of labor eighteen men are employed in\r\nskinning a single beef, a different knife being used for each particular\r\npart of the body, and all pass in regular routine over the ten or twelve\r\nbeeves undergoing the operation. The rapidity of this motion can scarcely\r\nbe conceived by one who has witnessed simply the butchering upon a farm.\r\nAll this is due to a minute division of labor into as many tasks as there\r\nare different operations, each man having, if possible, but one distinct\r\nkind of motion. The saving is not only shown in the increased quantity of\r\nwork, but in the uniform quality as well. All the workmanship is\r\nessentially perfect. These advantages appear more strikingly in the\r\nmanufacturing arts, where the so-called factory system has brought\r\ndivision of labor to perfection.\r\n\r\nA brief analysis of the advantages, limitations and disadvantages is worth\r\nour study, because of their possible application to farm industry. So far\r\nthey have been felt chiefly in contributory manufactures of farm\r\nmachinery, facilities for transportation, with all attending manufacture,\r\nand the factories consuming raw materials furnished from the farms. They\r\napply equally well where division of labor is profitable in farm\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n_Extra efficiency of labor._—Most obvious advantage is seen in the saving\r\nof the time of a laborer, both in learning the essential parts of his\r\nwork, so that apprenticeship is shortened to one-tenth or one-twentieth of\r\nthe time required for a full trade, and in the far greater dexterity with\r\nwhich he works without change of tools or change of location or\r\ndistraction of attention. Thus a raw hand in the course of a few months\r\nperforms his single task more rapidly and more perfectly than an expert\r\nworkman who must know and practice all the parts of the business. While\r\nsuch a hand can scarcely be called skilled in a technical sense, in the\r\nnarrow application of skill to one action he may be more perfect than any\r\nskilled workman. The fact that each man’s work passes immediately under\r\nthe inspection of another, whose motion must exactly correspond in time\r\nand adjustment, makes any costly oversight in the shape of executive labor\r\nvery much less, since every step in the process tests every other step. It\r\nis also found that minute attention to a single detail tends toward the\r\nhighest improvement by invention of every tool and machine employed.\r\n\r\nWhile this system is not likely to foster the inventive spirit which\r\nbrings out entirely new principles in machinery, because the work grows\r\neasy by familiarity, it does make the workmen quick to invent the little\r\ndevices that perfect such machines. A broader culture and more general\r\ntraining discovers the difficulties and devises the entirely new method:\r\nthe worker hits upon improvements. Watt invented the steam engine, but a\r\nlazy boy employed to move the valve hit upon the automatic movement.\r\n\r\n_Increased efficiency of capital._—The efficiency of capital in production\r\nis greatly increased by minute division of labor. The shop room required\r\nfor each man is reduced to the minimum space for himself and his material.\r\nHis tools, while the most perfect possible, are the fewest possible.\r\n\r\nThe machinery and motive power are used to their utmost capacity\r\nconstantly, and the economy of larger engines and machines is well known.\r\nPossibly one-fifth of the power required to move all the machines used by\r\nten men working as independent tradesmen would provide better motion, more\r\nconstant and cheaper, for the ten working together under division of\r\nlabor. The waste in starting and stopping of machinery is almost entirely\r\navoided, and the condition of the machine for doing its work well is kept\r\nup to the best. A most important saving is in diminution of waste. The\r\nshortened apprenticeship and the superior dexterity make waste from\r\nblunders almost nothing. Still more noticeable is the saving from any\r\nwaste of superior abilities, either strength or judgment, upon actions\r\nrequiring little ability.\r\n\r\nUnder minute division of labor a strong man is kept where he is needed and\r\nthe child may serve where his powers are sufficient. The efficiency of\r\nwomen is recognized wherever applicable, and all the workers have their\r\nfull abilities made constantly useful. Moreover, the circulating capital\r\nrepresented in the raw materials is kept in use much less time than under\r\nthe less effective system. Since any article of manufacture passes through\r\nall the operations upon it in very much less time, the interest upon\r\ncapital employed in holding the material and in supporting the labor\r\nduring its changes is indefinitely less. The quicker returns from this\r\nmore rapid manufacture are everywhere recognized.\r\n\r\n_Limits of division._—With all its advantages, division of labor is\r\nlimited by circumstances. It can never be applied where, because of poor\r\nroads or peculiarities of temper or habit of life, the workers are\r\nnaturally separated. The necessary isolation of the farmers for the sake\r\nof space makes any combination for the sake of economy in dividing their\r\ntasks almost impracticable. Even where farms are small, few advantages\r\nfrom division of labor by different kinds of work can be adopted. The\r\nfarmers are too far apart to work directly into each other’s hands. It is\r\nlimited, too, by the natural demand for the products of labor. If the\r\nlabor of one man can supply all need of iron work in his community, there\r\nis no possibility of employing ten, even with a hundred times the\r\neffectiveness. This is well illustrated in the country store, which sells\r\neverything over the same counter. Not even the grocery department can be\r\nseparated until the demand is sufficient to support two store-keepers in\r\ntwo stores.\r\n\r\nBut even in places where division of labor is stimulated by demand, it can\r\ngo no further than the number of distinct motions required in carrying\r\nthrough the manufacture of the article made. Indeed, economy requires that\r\neach motion should make a complete round, so that the work begins and ends\r\nfor each worker with everything in the same position. The exception is\r\nwhen a motion with great exertion requires an interval of rest before a\r\nsecond. Two men with a cross-cut saw, although their motions are alike, do\r\nmore than twice as much as one man, because of the relief in pushing back\r\nthe saw.\r\n\r\nA most important limit, however, is made by the inconstancy of natural\r\nforces employed in any industry. This is notable in all the processes of\r\nagriculture. No matter how many workers combine in raising field crops,\r\nthey can gain but few advantages from dividing their tasks minutely. Each\r\nlaborer must be employed through the year, and the change of seasons\r\nrequires that he be ready for all the operations of the different seasons\r\nin planting and tilling and gathering through all the succession. Ordinary\r\nchanges of weather, cold or hot, wet or dry, windy or calm, make necessary\r\nchanges in his labor. The uncertainties of each year as to moisture and\r\nheat require a variety of ventures, so that no farmer dares confine\r\nhimself to raising but a single crop. Even under the most favorable\r\nconditions the different stages of growth are so intimately related that\r\nthe watchfulness of the same interested manager is required at every\r\nstage. A delicate plant must be carried delicately, even in transplanting.\r\nMore important still are the conditions of fertility, which make a\r\nrotation of crops and even mixed farming essential to highest\r\nproductiveness. If each field must have its definite series of cropping\r\nand tillage, together with the application of animal manures, the\r\nadvantage of these combined operations under the oversight and labor of a\r\nsingle farmer outweighs the advantage of more perfect division of labor.\r\n\r\nThe result of all these limitations, so obvious in agriculture, is that\r\nfarm work is but slightly more effective or more continuous than it was\r\nhundreds of years since. While improved machinery has immensely reduced\r\nthe cost of certain processes, a year’s labor involves innumerable changes\r\nof employment, so that no farmer inquires, in hiring his help, for an\r\nexpert in any direction, but wants a man of all work whose skill is\r\nlargely ingenuity in adjusting himself to the constantly changing duties.\r\n\r\n_Suggestions of fuller division of farm labor._—It seems possible, with\r\nthe improved condition of agriculture and the nearness of ready markets,\r\nto attempt a larger use of division of labor in several directions. A\r\ngroup of farmers, well acquainted with the possible advantages, may\r\nclassify their farms as grain farms, dairy farms, breeding farms, feeding\r\nfarms and market-gardens. Such a community of interests would find not\r\nonly the advantages of exchange between each other, as well as the rest of\r\nthe world, but would soon build up bodies of expert young men in the\r\nseveral specialties, whose work would be at a premium everywhere.\r\n\r\nWith these interests recognized, still greater division of labor is\r\npossible. An expert in the care of trees and prevention of diseases to\r\nfruits and vegetables can quickly find employment, and may perfect himself\r\nin all the requirements of successive seasons. A dairy expert may find use\r\nfor his superior knowledge and skill on successive tours among the dairy\r\nfarms. Every farm large enough to employ several men gains some of the\r\nadvantages of division by making each man responsible for a definite part\r\nof the farm work. The less the workmen are handled in gangs, the better\r\neach one’s abilities can be trained to meet his responsibilities. These\r\npossibilities are greatly increased by every device for diminishing the\r\neffect of weather changes. Under-drainage gives large advantages in this\r\ndirection from lengthening the time during which the same operation can go\r\nforward. Means of protecting crops in the field serve a similar end.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the easiest application to be made in any neighborhood is a system\r\nof marketing, through keeping an expert collector and distributor of\r\nproduce busy in a limited region. All the waste of articles too few to be\r\ncarried to market is practically saved, and constant association with the\r\nmarkets of the world is made possible. Especially is this applicable to\r\nsmall fruits, milk, butter and eggs. If this market wagon can also serve\r\nto carry the daily mail for all the neighborhood, the problem of rural\r\ndelivery would be almost solved with a trifling expense. Even where such a\r\nmeasure is not possible, neighboring farmers may approach such results by\r\ncombining for market and mail days in a circle, each taking a different\r\nday of the week when he will do his neighbor’s errands.\r\n\r\nWith increased confidence in mutual interests, it seems possible that\r\nspecialists in various directions might grow up among a united circle of\r\nfarmers. The use of machinery and blooded stock can certainly be greatly\r\nincreased by careful adjustment of interests. Great improvements in seed\r\nand in methods of culture may be discovered by agreement among a body of\r\nfarmers that certain individuals shall make a specialty of those\r\nimprovements. It is even conceivable that a rotation of crops might be\r\ncarried on upon a dozen farms, while each farmer gives his attention to\r\nhis specialty. It would require, of course, a much closer combination in\r\ncredit with each other than has yet been found among farmers. At the very\r\nbest, however, farming must still remain the most prominent illustration\r\nof limitation in the application of the great labor saving and capital\r\nsaving by minute division of labor.\r\n\r\n_Disadvantages of extreme division._—The great addition to wealth so\r\ndistinctly traced to division of labor is not gained without some\r\ndisadvantages to the community. Almost certainly the inactivity of body\r\ncompelled by confinement to a simple portion of a trade induces physical\r\nweakness. The health of workers in factories is often uncertain, and the\r\naverage of life is known to be reduced. While steadiness of employment\r\ncontributes to steady habits, the reduced activity contributes to\r\nweakness. Perhaps even more perceptible is the tendency toward narrowness\r\nof mind. Ingenuity is developed in the “Jack of all trades,” although his\r\ninformation in regard to each one may be limited. The man who knows all\r\nabout a very small part of one trade has little to stimulate his mind to\r\nexertion. Indeed, habit is liable to make his very action and judgment\r\npurely automatic. The fact that the raw hand can be quickly made effective\r\nmakes the stimulation to self-education even less than in ordinary\r\ncircumstances. The constant dependence of each laborer upon the routine of\r\nhis work and his absolute dependence upon authority for his employment\r\nlead naturally to lack of self-control. A man may grow almost like the\r\nmachine he handles, responding only to the demand of his overseer. These\r\ntendencies foster also a growth of class distinctions. Such workmen are\r\nthought of as operatives, held in a class by themselves. They may be\r\nexpected to know little of the interests of community outside their own\r\ncircle, and are often distrusted in matters of common welfare. They\r\nthemselves distrust the leadership of those upon whose management they\r\ndepend for employment.\r\n\r\nAll these disadvantages may be overcome by more community of interest\r\namong workers of all classes for their comfort and improvement outside\r\ntheir tasks. It is a fact that associations for the advancement of workers\r\nin social and political freedom and mutual self-support have grown most\r\nrapidly in the neighborhood of factories, where division of labor is\r\nextreme. A truly philanthropic spirit may be in entire agreement with the\r\nmassing of labor for greatest accomplishment. The places of least\r\ndevelopment are always found where crowds of laborers work in mere gangs\r\nor wholly unorganized. The wholesome influences surrounding rural life are\r\neverywhere granted so far as physical development goes. They may also be\r\ngranted in communities of general enterprise with reference to ready\r\ningenuity and judgment. The farmer’s boys moving to the cities carry not\r\nonly physical strength and endurance but a mental capacity for ready\r\nadaptation to emergencies which develops into wisdom. The majority of\r\nleaders in great enterprises are still expected to grow up on the farm.\r\nThis is undoubtedly in part due to the impossibility of cramping by\r\nextreme division of labor. At the same time a partial application of its\r\nprinciples is needed to bring leisure for some general culture and larger\r\nacquaintance with the progress of the world. As the evils of factory life\r\ncan be cured by attention, so the weaknesses of rural life can be removed\r\nby a careful study of its needs. True education in both quarters is\r\nessential as a means of mutual understanding and adjustment of interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV. Aggregation Of Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great combinations._—The tendency toward improvement by combination of\r\nlaborers through the possibilities of division of labor leads to still\r\nlarger combinations in so-called factory systems, and even to a\r\ncombination of factories in large corporations. This tendency has been\r\nespecially marked since the multiplication of labor-saving machines and\r\nmore perfect systems of transportation. Indeed, the possibility of\r\nextensive machine using, as well as extended division of labor, rests upon\r\na combination of many forces under one general management. Beyond these\r\nadvantages, saving is found in the necessary care for waste products,\r\nwhich often may be turned into profit, greater freedom of action from\r\ncloser community of interests, greatly enlarged facilities for marketing,\r\nand the best possible devices for handling and transporting products.\r\n\r\nAll these advantages in great establishments are readily perceived, yet\r\nsome have doubted whether the gains are so distributed as actually to\r\nincrease the general welfare. Farmers, perhaps, as readily as any persons,\r\ndistrust the power of great corporations. Wage earners, generally, in the\r\nexpression, “corporations have no souls,” express their distrust of\r\nresults. Yet so far as they actually introduce improvement in production\r\nso that variety of products is increased and the cost of production\r\nreduced, the whole community gains in large measure the total saving. Any\r\none can realize the advantage by study of a single article of every-day\r\nuse. In the middle ages the cloth in a garment was worth eight times the\r\nwool from which it was made. Now the value is chiefly in the raw product.\r\nThe price of iron affects every farmer through the cost of his tools and\r\nimplements or the quality of either. Compare the modern steel hoe, first\r\nin quality and then in cost, with the hoe of fifty years since. Then\r\nmeasure that cost in its relation to a day’s work, as compared with the\r\nsame measure in 1850. All are in this way benefited by reducing the\r\nexertion needed to procure any one article of use, since more exertion may\r\nbe left for meeting other wants. If machinery and improved methods have\r\nentered less into the farmer’s home life, he can find his own advantage\r\nfrom the range of such improvements in other directions by thinking what a\r\npound of butter will buy for him today as compared with what it would buy\r\nbefore the period of machinery. (Chart No. XIV, p. 106.)\r\n\r\nThe introduction of labor-saving machines is a direct addition to human\r\npower and economy of time, and a means of converting useless material to\r\nmeet human wants. That a new machine throws out of employment workers in\r\nthat particular field brings a hardship which ought to be shared by the\r\nmultitude who are benefited; but the probabilities are great that the\r\nimproved method of manufacture will so increase the uses for the product\r\nas to bring into employment a far larger number of laborers. The spinning\r\njenny threw out of employment several thousand spinners in the old way,\r\nbut in twenty-five years the cloth-makers in England had increased from\r\nless than eight thousand to three hundred and twenty thousand. The\r\nmachines which in 1760 were thought to have ruined some eight thousand\r\ncloth-makers, in 1833 employed two million persons. This is only a\r\nstriking illustration of what has happened in every direction. It is\r\nperfectly evident that communities using the most machinery pay larger\r\nwages and far larger welfare to every laborer. It is not too much to say\r\nthat the actual comforts within the reach of every laborer have been more\r\nthan doubled within the last hundred years.\r\n\r\nA few illustrations of the actual saving in cost of production and\r\ndistribution may be interesting. Complicated machinery can never be used\r\nin producing upon a small scale, just as a small farmer can never afford\r\nthe use of a harvester. All the benefits of invention applied to machinery\r\nhave come through its use on a large scale. A factory making a thousand\r\npairs of shoes each year cannot use such machinery as the one making a\r\nmillion pairs will need. Each one of the million pairs, therefore, costs\r\nthe world less than each one of the thousand pairs. Again the large\r\nestablishment, like an immense saw mill, being obliged to care for its\r\nsawdust, may devise a way of making this waste product of use in pressed\r\nblocks for kindling, or possibly in buttons or wood ornaments. The waste\r\nof the shoe shop is only a nuisance, but the waste of a great shoe factory\r\nis ground and pressed into all sorts of useful forms. All such saving of\r\nwaste is so much added to the world’s store of wealth.\r\n\r\nThat the large establishment saves unnecessary friction is shown in the\r\norder of any great mercantile establishment. It is still more noticeable\r\nin immense iron works separated from every other form of industry for the\r\nsake of freedom of motion. In these ways, principally, there is a saving\r\nof labor in the huge department stores, although the facilities for\r\nadvertising, advantages for transportation in large bulk and the\r\nemployment of expert salesmen in every department contribute to the same\r\nresult. The general expenses of an ordinary store are estimated at nearly\r\n40 per cent of the difference between wholesale and retail prices. The\r\nsame expenses in the great coöperative store at Paris, the Bon Marché, are\r\nonly 14 per cent. While the controllers of capital in the large\r\nenterprises have the first advantage of such saving, the very necessities\r\nof their business compel a sharing with their employés and with the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nEven the so-called trusts, supposed to be contrivances for controlling the\r\nmarket, have really served in many instances the welfare of the whole\r\ncommunity. A biscuit trust, in handling the most of the crackers in the\r\nmarket, saves great expense of advertising, a still greater expense in\r\nsales by traveling salesmen, or drummers, and immense waste of stock on\r\nhand through condensation into fewer warehouses, reduces its insurance to\r\nactual cost, and has brought to the public by means of all these savings a\r\ngreater variety of crackers of almost uniform quality suited to the\r\nfluctuations of demand at a reduced price. No one doubts that even the\r\nStandard Oil Company, by means of its savings through consolidation, has\r\nat the same time preserved the general supply of oil from waste and\r\nbrought it to every man’s door, with a great improvement in quality,\r\ncomparative safety in use, and an almost constantly diminishing price.\r\n\r\nThe record of facts shows that with all the tendency to great\r\naggregations, and so to concentration of power, masses of wage-earners\r\nhave had their hours of labor shortened, have gained facilities for\r\nculture in libraries, lectures and voluntary associations, have gained\r\nhabits more systematic, and regular methods of life with greater constancy\r\nof employment, have better protection of civil rights, better provision\r\nfor education of children, a larger insurance against accident, and a\r\nbetter provision for hospital care when disabled. The same system has\r\nprovided methods for economical use of savings in joint stock companies,\r\nand cultivated a general unity of purpose and appreciation of others’\r\nwelfare. Withal it has given to the mothers of families an immense\r\nincrease of leisure for home-making, and at the same time has opened\r\nranges of employment for women without homes. Even the rate of wages has\r\nnot been diminished, but rather increased, as is shown also by actual\r\nrecords. That the great establishments cannot pay less than average rates\r\nis evident from the multitudes seeking to enter their employment.\r\nMoreover, they must pay their workmen regularly or appear bankrupt.\r\nEmployers on a small scale can easily postpone upon all sorts of\r\npretences, and failures are frequent. Suppose the distribution of milk in\r\nNew York city were under a single management. A systematic division of\r\nterritory would at once reduce the number of milk wagons by at least\r\none-half. The certainty of responsibility would insure uniform purity, and\r\nmeans of transportation could be brought to perfection, so that the amount\r\nnow delivered would actually cost perhaps not more than two-thirds the\r\npresent price. While at present prices the profit would be large, the\r\nnecessity for investing those profits would at once call for extension of\r\nthe trade by reducing the price, and at the same time increasing the\r\nproceeds to farmers somewhere who furnish the larger supply. The better\r\nquality and larger quantity for the same money would certainly increase\r\nthe demand, and probably with direct benefit to the milk-raisers. The\r\nessential element of distrust of individual management in large\r\nenterprises as to fair distribution of the profits stands in the way of\r\nsuch a combination.\r\n\r\n_Limits to aggregation._—It is easy to see that the advantages of great\r\nestablishments cannot always be gained. The limits of demand restrict the\r\npossibility of profit in supply. The element of space in connection with\r\nthe market and in relation to the buyers makes an important limit. Special\r\nadvantages of location on a small scale may outweigh the advantages of\r\naggregation. Utilization of forces in nature, like pure water or water\r\npower, or special qualities of raw materials, may outweigh all other\r\nconsiderations. In general the requirement of interested oversight in a\r\nsingle superintendent has checked such growth. The more perfect, however,\r\nthe system of management, the less effective is such a limitation. It is\r\npossible with extreme division of labor to make distinct rules take the\r\nplace of personal direction, and oversight is reduced to a minimum. All\r\nthese limitations serve to check the too rapid growth of this factory\r\nsystem and to hold in check the tendency to misuse of power in possible\r\nmonopolies. Any raising of prices which diminishes the demand destroys the\r\nadvantage of a great combination. It makes its profits by the quantity of\r\nits products sold. A reduction of the quantity much more certainly than a\r\nreduction in price destroys the advantage. Hence a monopoly gained in the\r\nordinary progress of trade can seldom operate for any long time to advance\r\nprices, though it may destroy the competition of smaller establishments\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n_Disadvantages of aggregation._—It is impossible to overlook a\r\nconsiderable number of disadvantages to the welfare of a community in a\r\ntoo rapid aggregation of its industrial enterprises. It changes large\r\nnumbers of laborers from independent workers to wage earners, and thus\r\nmakes them a part of the great machine, with an immense momentum in\r\nproduction which does not so readily yield to the fluctuations of demand.\r\nAn independent worker is not worried if he has a leisure day. The great\r\nestablishment cannot adjust its machinery to a lessened demand without a\r\nuniformity of reduction in wages or time of employment, or else the\r\ndischarge of numbers of employés. This is one of the causes of\r\nover-production so evident in certain directions upon the coming of\r\nfinancial crises. Another great disadvantage is seen in the breakdown of\r\nany such enterprise. Then its employés, trained for its particular uses,\r\nfind themselves not only without employment, but unfitted to drop into\r\nother niches of usefulness. The absolute routine of the great\r\nestablishment so fixes habits as to make very difficult a change of work\r\nexcept in line of promotion in a similar organization. The dissatisfaction\r\nand distress from such absence of employment is more apparent than in\r\nordinary poverty.\r\n\r\nThe strongest objections, however, to the great aggregations are found in\r\nthe possibility of oppression through a monopoly of business, and\r\ntherefore almost absolute control by a few persons of the interests not\r\nonly of a large body of employés, but of every competitor upon a smaller\r\nscale. A large combination practically compels all to yield to its\r\nmethods. The certain economy of methods has led to the statement, “Where\r\ncombination is possible, competition ceases.” The common saying,\r\n“Competition is the life of trade,” becomes untrue whenever that\r\ncompetition implies a costly service. Competition is supposed to reduce\r\ncost by stimulating energy and ingenuity. But when that ingenuity can be\r\nbetter applied in combination, the result is the destruction of\r\ncompetition. Competition may drive the milk wagon faster, but combination\r\nwill deliver more quarts of milk in the same time. The natural opposition\r\nto combination rests upon the same ground as the opposition to improved\r\nmachinery. It certainly throws out of their ordinary employment a\r\nconsiderable number of independent workers.\r\n\r\nThis power of the combination is a constant temptation to unscrupulous and\r\ngrasping managers to increase their advantage by vicious discrimination\r\nand false competition, expecting the destruction of others’ business to\r\nincrease their own. The largeness of the operation makes more plain the\r\ninjustice of the maxim, “All is fair in trade.” The final dangers of\r\ncombination are thus likely to be overestimated. It is not true that any\r\nlarger proportion of false methods of business enters into the large\r\nestablishment than into the small, and the possibility of profit in a\r\ngreat combination is quite as truly dependent upon the universal welfare\r\nas anywhere. The same extremes of prices mark the range for these\r\nestablishments as for any others. The price cannot continue higher than\r\nbuyers will pay with an increasing disposition to buy more. It cannot\r\nremain lower, of course, than will enable sellers to continue living as\r\nwell as in any other business. Checks upon increased price come as\r\ncertainly from substitutes as from rival production, and the ability of\r\nthe people will always gauge the amount of sales. The expression “What the\r\ntrade will bear,” means a price such as not to diminish consumption.\r\nIndeed, the business principles of a great trust are essentially the same\r\nas those in any single manufactory. A trust which stops the work of\r\ncertain factories in a combination for the sake of diminishing the output,\r\nbecause of danger to prices from too rapid production, follows the same\r\nprinciple as a farmer who stops raising wheat from the probability of too\r\nmuch wheat in the market. The farmer would better lose the use of his land\r\nfor a time than lose the advantage of both land and labor by\r\nover-production of wheat. In the same way a trust may wisely hold its\r\nfixed capital unproductive till the consumption of the community reaches\r\nthe full extent of its power to produce. The power of one combination to\r\ninterfere with the workings of another by indirect methods, like\r\ninvestment in the other’s stock, is an evil to be treated like any fraud.\r\nLaws and courts are in the power of the people, and should preserve the\r\nrights of all.\r\n\r\nOne great danger of large combinations is the tendency to govern by iron\r\nrule instead of by fair judgment of individual cases. This is a difficulty\r\nalways connected with great enterprises, to be cured as growth advances\r\nthrough establishing well trained experts whose judgment makes the rules\r\nnot only good in themselves, but well executed. The government itself is\r\nsubject to the same difficulty, as seen in the handling of an army, and is\r\nobliged to meet it in the same way. Even the abuses often referred to from\r\nenormous difference of wages between the executive officers and the\r\ninferior operatives are quite possibly only a natural method for solving\r\nthese difficulties. A first-class officer has no difficulty with his men.\r\nIn general those institutions whose management is costly do better for\r\ntheir workmen than the weaker institutions with weaker men at the head.\r\n\r\nThe supposed dangers from too rapid improvement in the machinery of\r\nproduction are scarcely to be credited in the light of improvements during\r\nthe last hundred years. Every improvement has certainly given a larger\r\nenjoyment and better employment to the masses of people. The enterprise\r\nwhich invents better ways of accomplishing anything is the best possible\r\nmeans for enlarging and stimulating the wants and abilities of the whole\r\npeople. The very profits themselves are sure to awaken larger enterprise,\r\nand even if the accumulated surplus is distributed in so-called watered\r\nstock, it does not cease to promote production. The wider the distribution\r\nof stock, the more permanent and more generally satisfactory is the\r\nworking of the great combination. If employés themselves become sharers in\r\nthe business, the true interests of all are likely to be promoted. When\r\nthe savings of the multitude can be perfectly united in a joint stock\r\ncompany, to furnish the capital with which the same people work, the\r\ngeneral conditions of wealth production for all the community are fairly\r\nmet.\r\n\r\n_Bonanza farms._—An illustration of some effects of aggregation may be\r\nseen in the enormous farms of the wheat regions of America. There\r\nmachinery is introduced as far as possible, all work is methodically\r\nplanned and executed, and wholesale rates in purchases and in\r\ntransportation are secured. The result is that certain staple products,\r\nespecially wheat, are raised at a cost far below the average cost to\r\nmoderate farmers. The result is large profits upon the capital invested,\r\nin spite of the fact that such farms do not make best use of soil\r\nfertility and certainly do not maintain the best condition of soil for\r\nfuture use. This, however, is due rather to the nature of pioneer farming,\r\nwhich makes immediate use of the powers of the soil, than to the nature of\r\nthe management. It is conceivable that the same ingenuity may continue the\r\ndevelopment of large farms under greatly improved agriculture. In that\r\ncase the general effect will be much more widely felt than now. So far it\r\nseems that bonanza farming is confined to a very few lines of production,\r\nwhere everything is bent in the direction of lessening labor instead of\r\nbenefiting the soil or making homes.\r\n\r\nThere is no question as to the general advantage of small farms in making\r\nfarm homes. It is a question whether the general improvements in\r\nagriculture, except in machinery and its use, have not come from the\r\ndiligent ingenuity of the small farmer in making most of his own acres.\r\nBen Franklin said, “The best manure for the farm is the foot of its\r\nowner.” The interested constancy among small farmers certainly develops\r\nboth character and ability in any country. This fact has probably been one\r\nreason for the small farms of large parts of Europe. One-third of France\r\nis cultivated by owners of farms averaging 7-½ acres. Four-fifths of\r\nBavaria, Belgium and Switzerland are in farms of less than twelve acres.\r\nEven Prussia has 900,000 farms of less than four acres. These farms vary\r\nin quality from poorest to richest, and peasant farmers are not able to\r\nboast of their wealth. Yet some of the most fertile regions are made so\r\nand kept so by the labor employed upon the small farm. Some of them also\r\ninvolve large capital. The Isle of Jersey, where land is worth $1,000 an\r\nacre, is so divided that an average farm is eight acres. Of course, but\r\nlittle labor-saving machinery reaches these places. Tillage with the spade\r\ncosts five times as much as tillage by plough; yet the small farmer finds\r\nsuch advantage from its use as to call it gold mining. It is probable that\r\nthe strong competition of immense farms in grain raising, possibly also in\r\nsugar raising from either cane or beets, and in seed raising, will awaken\r\namong the smaller farmers attention to finer grades of farming and more\r\ncare for the fertility of their fewer acres.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the tendency with increasing population is toward smaller\r\nfarms with more intensive farming. Whether our country, with its stronger\r\ncommercial energy, will follow this tendency as exhibited in northern\r\nEurope seems doubtful. It is not likely that we shall ever admit the legal\r\nrestrictions under which division and subdivision have made their way in\r\nthat region. The question will doubtless be settled by economic conditions\r\nindependent of legislation. At present we are far from either extreme, as\r\ncan be seen by reference to Chart No. I, p. 9.\r\n\r\n_Department stores._—Increasing application of the principles of\r\naggregation is seen in the so-called department stores, which not only\r\ndeal in everything but with everybody, extending their trade by mail over\r\nlarge territory. The very evident economy of such aggregation of capital\r\nfor purposes of exchange appeals so directly to the customers as to make\r\nthe sufferers in competition cry out in vain for restrictions. Such stores\r\nseem sure to maintain their advantage in exchange, except with reference\r\nto mere local distribution of every-day necessities and expert handling of\r\nspecialties. The community does well to give attention not so much to\r\nrestrictions upon this trade as to reduction of opportunity for abuse of\r\npower over the mass of employés under control. The great establishment\r\nwill certainly bring more satisfactory conditions in time than the\r\nmultitude of small ones beyond the reach of public inspection.\r\n\r\n_Trusts._—Of late years the advance of combination in so-called trusts has\r\nbeen enormous. The underlying principles of economy already illustrated\r\nfurnish the occasion for such combinations, but the immediate advantage to\r\npromoters of such enterprises, because of the supposed power in control of\r\nthe market, is found in the speculative interest in stocks. In this\r\nrespect the multiplication of trusts will furnish the principal weapon\r\nagainst them. Yet the dangers to the industry of the country, as well as\r\nto the safety of exchanges, from such rapid consolidation of management\r\nare easily perceived. It is certainly necessary that responsibility for\r\nsuch enterprises be definitely fixed upon the share-holders. And it is\r\nmore than probable that government inspection of such business may become\r\nas necessary as it now is of the banking systems of our country. Some\r\nstudents of the subject foresee a final assumption of absolute control by\r\nthe government of all industrial enterprises as a result of this tendency\r\nto aggregation. The question cannot be discussed in this connection, since\r\nit involves a wider range of welfare than can be considered under\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n_Possible combinations for farming._—It is proper to close this chapter\r\nwith suggestions as to the possibility of gaining the advantages of\r\ncombination for farming communities without disturbing the present\r\ncondition of ownership of land. When our farmers generally shall have\r\noutgrown the disposition to make money by emigration, so that each farming\r\ncommunity is made up of farm homes with a stable population, more intimate\r\nassociations for farm operations than now are possible ought to become the\r\nrule. Suggestions have already been made as to the possibilities of\r\ngreater division of labor, but other advantages of combination in the way\r\nof labor saving can certainly be secured. More definite business methods\r\nand mutual confidence in a neighborhood of farmers make possible enormous\r\neconomies in the way of mutual protection and advantage. The removal of\r\nfences, with possible combination in seeding and tillage, a universal\r\nmethod of dealing with insects, blights, rusts and similar plant diseases,\r\nthe handling of products in company, and above all a perfect sympathy in\r\nall methods of improvement, education and development of enterprise, will\r\naccomplish wonders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV. Special Incentives To Production.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Good government chief._—The productive energy of any country is\r\nencouraged chiefly by what we call good government. This means especially\r\nsecurity of property rights by prevention of frauds and robbery of every\r\nkind, and free interchange of ideas, as well as of products of industry,\r\nand general public intelligence. It is not enough that individuals\r\nthroughout a community be fairly intelligent, but they must have\r\nsufficiently mutual ground of intelligence in common purposes and common\r\ninterests in everyday work to bring without effort a perfectly mutual\r\nconfidence. Where these essentials are absent no devices can operate\r\nextensively for the encouragement of energy in production. Where they are\r\npresent it is always possible to add extra incentives, to give direction\r\nat least to the energies of the people, and perhaps to increase those\r\nenergies. Some of these incentives are too important to be overlooked.\r\n\r\n_Premiums._—The most simple means of encouraging enterprise is found in\r\npremiums of various kinds offered by individuals, local societies or\r\nmunicipal authority. These operate by adding to the natural advantage of\r\nenergetic labor some special reward in recognition of its accomplishment.\r\nIllustrations are familiar in connection with so-called fairs of all kinds\r\nwhere prizes are distributed for the largest product of a kind, the most\r\nprofitable crop, the best article for any purpose, the greatest variety of\r\ncrops or stock, or for any conceivable device which seems to add to the\r\nproducing power of the community. Governments often offer premiums for\r\nplans of public buildings, and sometimes for offensive weapons. All of\r\nthese operate upon the one principle of arousing special energy by\r\nsuperior advantage given to the successful competitor. Its advantages are\r\nevident. Its disadvantages sometimes outweigh advantages. It encourages\r\nsomewhat the spirit of gambling, resulting in devices for winning the\r\nprize through false representation. It exaggerates the importance of showy\r\nqualities for the sake of notoriety, and it fosters those jealousies which\r\ntoo constantly interfere with the welfare of communities.\r\n\r\nBoth advantages and disadvantages are well illustrated in agricultural\r\nfairs. These have proved a most admirable stimulant to better agriculture,\r\nwhere clear-headed, intelligent judges have judiciously distributed prizes\r\nof such a nature as to have their chief use in establishing the quality of\r\nthe product shown without catering too distinctly for the enthusiasm of\r\nthe crowd or for individual profit. The chief end of all such incentives\r\nis rightly found in the educational influence from comparison of products\r\nand the establishment of standards which the whole mass of the people may\r\nbe led to accept.\r\n\r\n_Bounties._—A less common but extensively used incentive is in bounties.\r\nThese are advantages of various kinds, frequently in money, given by local\r\nor general authority for peculiar services or special enterprises. A\r\nfamiliar illustration is seen in the bounty of late years offered by\r\ndifferent states for the production of sugar, especially sugar from beets\r\nor from sorghum. The object is evidently to arouse the energies of a\r\ncommunity in a special direction, with the expectation that the\r\nestablishment of a new industry will, in the nature of exchange, promote\r\nthe welfare of all. Some countries have stimulated foreign exchange by a\r\nbounty upon exports, such as Germany now pays upon the beet sugar exported\r\nto other countries. Of the same nature are the gifts made by local\r\ncommunities for the establishment of mills, factories, railroads,\r\nirrigating ditches, all of which are supposed to bring profit to the\r\ncommunity in general in much larger proportion than the special\r\nenterprises have received. The principle is the same when bounties are\r\noffered for the destruction of wolves, foxes and other vermin, or when\r\nstanding rewards are given for the arrest of criminals.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question of the right of a community to offer this extra\r\nstimulant to particular exertions, but the wisdom is doubtful. In the\r\nfirst place, bounties are liable to withdraw capital and labor from more\r\ncertain methods of production to more uncertain methods. Indeed, the chief\r\nobject of the bounty is to entice into experiments those who would\r\notherwise hesitate. The advantage of the bounty is very liable to be\r\noverestimated. People hasten in steps to secure bounty without careful\r\nstudy of the business they undertake. This is especially true of bounties\r\nfor establishment of factories in new locations. They attract the least\r\nexperienced and most speculative men, without consideration of the far\r\nmore important elements of immediate market and convenient employment of\r\nlabor. Railroads are built for the bonds voted without care for future\r\nprofit. Enterprises of this kind, promoted by bounties, are especially\r\nliable to failure. The history of development in the west gives\r\noverwhelming evidence of their weakness. Even when the bounty is offered\r\nfor reduction of vermin, it is often misapplied. Numerous cases are on\r\nrecord where the bounty became a stimulant to enterprise in raising the\r\nvery animals to be destroyed. Even rewards for the arrest of criminals\r\nseem sometimes to create a body of men who thrive by fostering a criminal\r\nclass, with a hope of sometime getting a profit from arrests. As a means\r\nof stimulating general industry they are too unstable to be satisfactory.\r\nMost probably political parties are in constant contention over the\r\nmaintenance of the bounty. No more insidious enemy to the purity of\r\npolitics can be found than the selfish interest aroused by special\r\nbounties.\r\n\r\n_Monopoly privileges._—Government monopolies have been a favorite method\r\nin past ages of fostering particular enterprises. These are in the nature\r\nof an exclusive privilege, granted to individuals or corporations for the\r\nmanufacture or sale of particular commodities, and occasionally for\r\nspecial public services. These were once a method of showing royal favor,\r\nand the word monopoly has in its very nature the idea of inequality. Hence\r\nthey are unpopular under all circumstances, except when permanent and\r\nuniversal advantage is secured.\r\n\r\n_License._—The monopoly of service is secured by the issue of a license.\r\nIf granted through official favoritism, the wrong is easily appreciated;\r\nif granted to all who conform to necessary requirements for the general\r\nwelfare, as in showing qualifications for teaching, compounding of drugs,\r\nor practice of medicine, the license is recognized as useful. In fact, it\r\nseems to furnish security for satisfactory governmental service, and is\r\nthe basis of all promised reform in civil administration.\r\n\r\n_Patent and copyright._—The chief illustrations of a genuine monopoly\r\nmaintained by government authority are found in the patent upon inventions\r\nand the copyright upon publications. A patent is conferred upon the\r\ninventor of “any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition\r\nof matter, or any improvement thereof,” upon proof that the invention is\r\noriginal, not previously in use anywhere, and likely to be beneficial\r\nrather than detrimental. This patent secures to the inventor the sole\r\nright to make, use or exchange articles manufactured after the pattern\r\ndescribed, or upon the principle involved in construction. This monopoly\r\nis limited usually to a term of years supposed to be sufficient to secure\r\nto the inventor a reward for his exertion. The patent laws of the United\r\nStates protect the rights of an inventor for seventeen years, entitling\r\nhim to damages upon proof in the proper court of infringement upon his\r\npatent. Such protection extends, of course, only throughout the territory\r\nunder the same government. It may be secured, however, in foreign nations\r\nunder special regulation, so as to cover the most of the civilized world.\r\nThe copyright serves the same purpose, and is limited in much the same\r\nway, for securing to the products of thought or of taste a proper reward\r\nfor the powers exerted. It gives to an author control over publication of\r\nhis thoughts during a period of twenty-eight years, in order that the\r\nusers of his thoughts may actually pay what they are worth. This, too, is\r\nconfined to the limits of the government issuing it, unless by agreement\r\nan international copyright is provided by the laws of the several\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n_Franchises._—A still more noticeable monopoly is granted by\r\nmunicipalities under what is called a franchise for the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of water supply, public means of artificial lighting and\r\nheating, or means of public transportation. These are under government\r\ncontrol usually in cities, because they employ the public streets for\r\ncarrying on the enterprise. The franchise is really an extension of the\r\nlicense in particular directions. This is usually issued with the\r\nexpectation of great public benefit from a large investment of capital\r\nwhich would not be made without relief from competition, because not\r\nimmediately profitable. The franchise usually carries with it certain\r\nrestrictions as to use of public highways and limitation to a term of\r\nyears. It necessarily involves the right of government inspection and\r\ncontrol for the general welfare.\r\n\r\n_Difficulties from monopoly privileges._—All of these monopolies are\r\ngranted for the purpose of conferring upon the whole community benefits\r\nthat could not otherwise be secured. They are wise only so far as they\r\nsecure this result. If the patent right system wastes the energies of\r\ninventors in contrivance of useless devices, there is loss; if it builds\r\nup a class of mere speculators, there is waste; if it fosters monopoly\r\nbeyond the giving of a fair reward for invention, it is robbery. The exact\r\nlimit of time during which a patent is good stimulates to the utmost\r\nexertion for wide introduction of its benefits, and at the same time\r\nprevents the burden of lasting monopoly. The dangers are chiefly in the\r\nadministration of patent laws, from the careless issue of undeserved\r\npatents, or in a combination under a series of patents to maintain a\r\nconstant monopoly. It is a safe rule to issue patents only for particular\r\napplications of scientific principles and not for the discovery of the\r\nprinciple, which can be protected in publication by copyright. Departures\r\nfrom this rule cut off the possibility of more perfect contrivances and\r\nfair competition in devices and methods. There can be no question of the\r\ngeneral advantage of protecting a genuine inventor from the trespass of\r\nothers to secure him a fair compensation. No other plan for a fair\r\nexchange of such services has even been suggested. The unsettled question\r\nis the proper limit of time for a patent to run.\r\n\r\nThe advantages and disadvantages of copyright are essentially the same in\r\ncharacter, though the dangers are less. Since the large part of the reward\r\nof an author or an artist is in the repute he may secure, there is little\r\ndanger of fostering an unfair spirit of monopoly. The franchise is subject\r\nto the same principles, but its dangers in practice are very great. So\r\nlong as the advantages to the corporation securing the franchise may be\r\nenormous, if it is sufficiently extended, there is great temptation to\r\nbribery, both in the original issue and in the maintenance of inspection\r\nand municipal control. Nothing has so interfered with good government of\r\ncities as the manipulation of franchises. These abuses underlie the\r\npopular call for municipal ownership of water works, lighting plants and\r\nstreet railways.\r\n\r\n_Protective duties._—A still more widely extended method of stimulating\r\nindustry by special incentives is seen in what is called a protective\r\ntariff. This is a system of duties upon articles produced in foreign\r\ncountries so levied as to check the natural competition by increasing\r\ntheir cost to consumers. The increased cost of such articles, if not too\r\ngreat to destroy the demand, increases the incentive to manufacture\r\nsimilar articles within the country.\r\n\r\nThe schedule of tariffs becomes then a very important element in all\r\nproductive industry, and requires the nicest adjustment to the needs and\r\nabilities of the nation. If associated, as is usually the case, with the\r\nraising of government revenues, the adjustment becomes more difficult, and\r\nrequires the judgment of experts in commerce as well as in statistical\r\nknowledge of industries and government necessities. While in any country\r\nthe existing tariff is presumed to have been established to meet public\r\nneed, the fact that there is necessarily a restriction upon freedom of\r\nexchange makes it always open to question. The tariff laws, like all laws\r\nrestricting freedom of action, must always have evident reason for\r\nexisting. The burden of proof rests with the one who defends such laws.\r\nThis is especially true with reference to tariffs, because the trend of\r\ncivilization is certainly toward greater freedom of intercourse in all\r\ndirections. The barriers between nations are generally giving way before\r\nthe introduction of ready transportation and quick communication. The\r\nstatesman who maintains the necessity of restrictive tariff must always\r\nstand ready to explain this obstacle to more complete association. For\r\nthis reason we have the constant agitation of tariff questions and the\r\nimpossibility of permanent settlement in any particular.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason there are always two phases of a tariff discussion.\r\nThe student of social science inquires chiefly as to the tendencies of\r\nadvancing society with reference to such restriction, and, seeing the\r\nbarriers becoming less and less, is likely to seek the final removal of\r\nevery such restriction. The statesman, busied with the immediate\r\nconditions of the limited community whose interests he guards, is liable\r\nto be for or against any particular restriction as it fosters or hinders\r\nthose interests. For this reason statesmen, of whatever party, are subject\r\nto the bias of local interests, and have even been known to change their\r\nviews with a change of such interests. In our own country, when party\r\nlines are drawn upon the tariff, it is quite possible that sectional lines\r\nmay also mark the party supremacy. In fact, it is possible for any man to\r\nbelieve in freedom of trade as the ultimate condition to be sought, while\r\nhe favors in immediate practice restriction or even prohibition by a\r\ndefinite tariff. The purpose in this chapter is to give a brief outline of\r\narguments for and against such tariff in general, leaving entirely to\r\npractical statesmanship the decision of special questions.\r\n\r\n_Reasons for protective tariff._—A system of restrictive tariffs is\r\nthought to contribute to the welfare of an entire community by\r\nartificially increasing the natural diversity of employments. If new\r\nenterprises can be fostered, exchanges are greatly increased, all the\r\nadvantages of exchange are secured within the country, and the general\r\nintelligence of the people is increased. With this comes the enormous\r\nadvantage of what is called a home market for the cruder products of\r\nindustry. This is especially to the interest of farmers raising bulky\r\nproducts or those not likely to bear transportation. It is further thought\r\nto foster a better agriculture by a more natural return to the soil of\r\nelements removed in cropping, the nearer body of population making such\r\nreturn possible. It is also thought to make at once available the natural\r\nresources of a country in mines, quarries, water powers, etc., which might\r\notherwise long remain useless. It is contended for as a means of checking\r\nunfair competition between a long established community with special\r\nadvantages for factory methods, either in large accumulations of capital\r\nor low wages of laborers, and a newer country where capital is scarce and\r\nwages are high. It is sometimes held to be a means of maintaining a high\r\nstandard of wages through the advantage actually conferred upon certain\r\nlines of industry, upon a supposition that competition at home without\r\nthese favored industries would reduce the wages maintained in other\r\nindustries. If a tariff on wool calls into profitable use a large amount\r\nof farm capital in sheep raising, every wheat raiser is at the same time\r\nbenefited by reduction of competition in the wheat market. If the capital\r\nand labor employed are enticed from other countries, the effect is the\r\nsame by increasing the demand at home for the wheat. That this does not\r\noperate so long as wheat raisers come to a market where a surplus must be\r\nconsumed in other countries does not destroy the argument, since the\r\ntendency is to reduce the surplus. The system is also thought to\r\nencourage, in lines of industry likely to prove productive, a rapid\r\ndevelopment of labor-saving machinery and new methods of manufacture,\r\nwhich may some time give to a nation superiority in the markets of the\r\nworld. To many there seems a much more important reason for restrictions,\r\nin order to establish every needed form of production for the sake of\r\nnational independence. That nation which contains within its own borders\r\nthe means of supplying all the wants of its people is supposed to be more\r\ncapable of independent growth, and to be freed from hampering competitions\r\nof trade, that may lead to wars and, perhaps, to extreme suffering in case\r\nof foreign war.\r\n\r\nFor abundant examples in support of these various propositions, appeal is\r\nmade to the history of the world by comparing countries developed under a\r\nrestrictive tariff with less developed ones free from such restrictions.\r\nThe history of our own country, under the ups and downs of tariff\r\nlegislation, is also appealed to. Even the extra cost of certain articles\r\nto the whole people, which is the sole basis of advantage to the fostered\r\ninterest, is thought to be more than compensated by the direct advantage\r\nof increasing competition at home, where it will have the most wholesome\r\neffect upon the market price. Proof of this, too, is sought in the rapid\r\ndevelopment of iron and steel manufacture, where protective tariffs have\r\nbeen most persistent.\r\n\r\n_Reasons against protective tariff._—Against a system of protective\r\ntariffs many strong arguments are not wanting. It is contended that a\r\ntariff on iron goods, for instance, is just so much an added burden upon\r\nall consumers of iron, and, since the bulk of consumption enters into the\r\ncost of articles of universal use, the greater part of the burden is borne\r\nby the poorer classes of people, who consume as much as the more wealthy.\r\nIf the restrictive tariff actually limits the introduction of foreign\r\ngoods, as must be the case if it acts as a stimulant in production, the\r\nrevenues received are far from being in due proportion with the cost to\r\nthe people, since essentially the same tariff is paid by the consumer\r\nwhether the article is imported or manufactured at home. Although it is\r\nnot true that in every instance the tariff is a tax, in so far as it\r\nbenefits the home manufacturer by advanced prices it must be. In so far as\r\nit operates for protection of favored industries, it certainly fails to\r\nserve the purposes of revenue. The diversity of employment evidently\r\nfostered by tariff is said to be unnatural and likely to continue\r\nexpensive, and any advantages of market at home are sure to be\r\noverestimated, especially with reference to staple products of the farm,\r\nsince the surplus necessarily forming a basis for prices must be sold in\r\nforeign countries without the advantage of direct exchange for articles of\r\ntheir own production. That is, if our tariff restrictions limit the market\r\nof a foreign people, they also limit the ability of that people to\r\npurchase the products which we are obliged to sell them. It is contended\r\nfurther that a rapid development of varied industries, instead of\r\nmaintaining soil fertility, tends to more rapid exhaustion by making more\r\nprobable the consumption of cruder products of the farm in villages and\r\ncities too remote for return of fertility, although within the same\r\ncountry. The development of natural resources under stimulant of a tariff\r\nis admitted by its opponents, but represented as a waste of effort, since\r\nthe tendency is to withdraw capital and labor from more productive\r\nindustries into less productive, and that, too, at the expense of the more\r\nproductive. If factories cannot give an equal profit with farming, it is\r\nabsurd to tempt capital away from the farms into factories. So, although\r\nwealth may be accumulated in showy enterprises, the people, as a whole,\r\nare less thrifty and bear unequal burdens. It is further contended that\r\nthe total labor of the community, when a part is used in unprofitable\r\ndevelopment of resources, is made on the whole less productive, and\r\ntherefore the people are less able to buy their neighbors’ products, and\r\nmust live with diminished comforts. In that case all the haste in\r\ndeveloping natural resources is actual waste.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the restrictive tariff invites capital from abroad\r\nfor the sake of gaining the trade of a country, the diminished profit of\r\nlabor in some foreign country compels emigration, and such emigrants are\r\nlikely to follow the capital. Only the poorest of foreign laborers will be\r\ncompelled to help themselves by emigration, and only those will gain by\r\nthe change of location. Thus it is said a restrictive tariff encourages\r\nthe least desirable form of immigration. This is illustrated in the\r\ndevelopment of the mining industry through the fostering effects of the\r\ntariff.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that any restriction upon trade may foster the\r\ncontrivance of combination to secure monopoly. Hence it is often claimed\r\nthat the existence of trusts is due in great measure to tariff\r\nrestrictions, preventing the competition natural in the commercial world.\r\nIt is certainly true that the restriction of a patent right may make\r\npossible the abuses of a trust. If trusts were confined to protected\r\nindustries or to countries maintaining protective systems, the weight of\r\nthe argument would be stronger. It is certainly true, however, that the\r\nwider the range of competition without restriction, the greater the\r\nprotection against combination for sake of monopoly. The monopoly in\r\nkerosene oil would be a greater menace but for the possible check of\r\ncompetition from abroad.\r\n\r\nSuch artificial restrictions, again, prevent the naturally rapid growth of\r\ninternational commerce, which gives the surest foundation for more\r\npermanent conditions of peace and greater extension of welfare over the\r\nworld. The tremendous interests of the commercial world are the strongest\r\nsafeguard against unnecessary warfare, and the best protection to any\r\nnation is the fact that it makes itself needed by all the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThus inter-dependence of nations rather than independence is the essential\r\naim of those who seek the world’s welfare. An alliance of two peoples for\r\ncommercial purposes is the best guaranty of mutual support of national\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIn proof of all these statements, the experience of the world in widely\r\nvarying regions is appealed to. The natural breaking down of prohibitory\r\ntariffs has given opportunity for observation. Especially has the commerce\r\nbetween states of the Union, where it is absolutely free, shown the\r\ngeneral advantage of such freedom in rapid development of wealth and\r\nwelfare. While these states have a common interest in government, they are\r\nnevertheless widely distinguished in peculiarities of local government and\r\nin characteristics of people. While, therefore, there is possible doubt as\r\nto the wisdom of rapid removal of restrictions, there is every probability\r\nthat such restrictions will gradually be outgrown. Even the temptation to\r\nmake retaliatory duties, where other governments restrict against our\r\nproducts, is growing less with increasing experience of the true advantage\r\nin exchanges. The world is gradually coming to see that the better market\r\nany region of country affords for the rest of the world, the better market\r\nthe rest of the world affords for it.\r\n\r\n_Incidental tendencies from tariff._—The incidental effects of restrictive\r\ntariffs, and especially of the necessary instability of restrictive\r\nlegislation, are too interesting to pass by, though very limited space can\r\nbe afforded them. In the first place they contribute to a speculative\r\nenterprise which leads to waste of wealth in unpromising undertakings\r\nbecause of a necessary over-estimate of the advantage given. On the other\r\nhand, a reduction of the same tariff after a series of years is almost\r\nsure to bring panic in that line of industry previously fostered. So the\r\nfluctuations of tariff laws are one element in periodic expansion and\r\ncontraction of business. The tariff laws are certain, also, to involve the\r\nworst element of influence through the lobby upon legislative bodies. Even\r\nthough the charge of bribery be utterly false, the general respect for\r\nlegislative bodies is lowered by charges and countercharges for political\r\neffect. As an occasion for such charges scarce any other form of\r\nlegislation serves as well. Even the people themselves are easily assumed\r\nby their neighbors to weigh their opinions upon a tariff measure by their\r\npersonal interests.\r\n\r\nThe indirect influence of a new tariff law upon the industries of a\r\ncountry can scarcely be foreseen. So interlocked are all the varieties of\r\nmanufacture and trade that a change in price of any one article of\r\ncommerce may affect hundreds of others, sometimes much more than the\r\narticle restricted. It is easily seen that a duty upon iron of a\r\nparticular shape or quality may actually prohibit the use of that iron in\r\nsome product which already touches the margin of profit. These incidental\r\neffects can scarcely be foreseen by even the wisest statesman. The\r\npractical adjustment of conflicting interests in the framing of tariff\r\nlaws should be the work of experts. If all parties could unite in\r\nestablishing a bureau of commerce, domestic and foreign, as dignified as\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, and as independent of party\r\ninterference, such a body might frame a consistent tariff law, gradually\r\nperfecting it in adjustment to all interests and explaining its bearings\r\nto all parties. Such a body could take account of the great interests of\r\nagriculture in the commerce of the world, and weigh properly the indirect\r\ninfluence of restrictions. The marked influence of fluctuating tariff upon\r\nsheep raising, so familiar to all farmers, might then be fairly\r\nappreciated. Under present methods it is very certain that any tariff law\r\nis largely a compromise, with limited judgment, between agitating\r\nconflicts of interested promoters. The farmers, of all people, can afford\r\nto be conservative of all interests, and should favor such methods as will\r\nwork toward enlargement of commerce without destruction of industries. If\r\npossible, they will wisely seek the removal of tariff questions from\r\npractical politics.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this subject, it is wise to suggest that the true principle\r\nof regulations for national industry are the same as those for true family\r\neconomy. The family should so plan its work and ways as to make the best\r\npossible use of the powers of every member. It is no economy to buy cheap\r\nthings unless the members of the family can be better occupied than in\r\nmaking them. It is poor economy to make those things which cost more time\r\nand effort than would be used in making something else for exchange. Home\r\nproduction is best when this makes the home labor more effectual, but\r\nworst when it interferes with the profit of labor. The farmer who stops\r\nharvesting to mend his harness when he might employ the harness-maker is\r\nwasteful; but if he mends it on a rainy day he saves time which would\r\notherwise be less profitably used. So the nation whose capital and labor\r\nare not well employed may do wisely in developing new industries, even at\r\na considerable expense for introducing the new industries. But if all the\r\nnation’s energies are profitably employed, the costly development of\r\nresources may wisely wait for future capital and labor. So all special\r\nincentives require a constant inquiry as to beneficial results supposed to\r\nfollow, and the policy of the government must conform to the needs of\r\ngeneral welfare. Even vested rights are subject to the law of welfare\r\ninvolved in the original act establishing special privileges. Public use,\r\nnot private interest, is the true reason for the existence of any such\r\nprivileges or protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI. Business Security.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conservative influences._—We have already seen the influence of\r\ngovernmental organization upon various phases of production; but the chief\r\nfostering influence is the general stability of a community, not only in\r\nits laws, but in its customs and habits of life. Security in property\r\nrights is a chief condition for accumulation of wealth, and a still more\r\nnecessary condition for industry. Not even want will drive people to\r\nindustry when there is no certainty of possession when the work is\r\naccomplished. The fruits of industry must be safe. While the laws of the\r\ncountry are naturally considered the guardians of rights, the customs and\r\nhabits of the people, the actual origin of laws, are even more important.\r\nBad habits actually nullify good laws, while bad laws may be made quite\r\nendurable by good customs. Thus, the welfare of every community depends\r\nupon a conservative social influence, preventing abuse of opportunity for\r\ninjury and stimulating individual energy.\r\n\r\nThe rights of life, liberty and property must first be dear to the mass of\r\nthe people before laws can be framed for their protection. This is\r\nespecially true in a self-governing people, but is essentially the same in\r\nthe most absolute tyranny. So the chief safeguard for every kind of\r\nbusiness is the honest character of all business men, and such influences\r\nas establish good character and sound judgment will be fostered on the\r\nsimplest business principles. The farmer who sells his grain or his fruit\r\nby false samples cannot complain of false weights and measures at the\r\nelevator. The one who gloats over victory in a horse trade has no right to\r\ngrumble at a trickster in wool buying. The man who is caught by the offer\r\nof a gold brick is not only foolish, but false, and diminishes the\r\nsecurity of himself and everybody else in fair bargains and genuine\r\nbusiness. The man who takes advantage of his ignorant neighbor deserves to\r\nbe at the mercy of a more crafty dealer. Every one who makes a false use\r\nof power over a workman beneath him may expect a false use of power from\r\nan authority above him. So all business interests, as well as all rights,\r\nare secured by the right spirit in all men.\r\n\r\n_Nature of insurance._—The fundamental activity in accumulation of wealth\r\nis foresight; but no foresight can prevent all disasters. Fire, flood,\r\nwind and wave are beyond control, because in some sense they are beyond\r\nknowledge. Against such forces no foresight can secure. The name insurance\r\nis given to every method by which the burden of such unforeseen losses is\r\nprovided for beforehand and fairly distributed. The average of such losses\r\ncan easily be estimated by experience. Statistics show a wonderful\r\nuniformity in the misfortunes of life as well as, the fortunes. Even\r\nthough chance be an element in every transaction, the average of chances\r\ncan be distinctly calculated; and that average is essentially constant\r\namong a sufficiently large number of instances.\r\n\r\nAll are familiar with the application of such calculations in fire\r\ninsurance. Among ten thousand houses a certain number will be destroyed by\r\nfire every year, provided those houses are widely distributed under\r\nessentially similar conditions. The ten thousand house owners can insure\r\neach owner against entire loss of his house by mutual agreement to meet\r\ntheir share of the total loss. If ten houses are burned, each of the ten\r\nthousand house owners will pay one-thousandth part of the total loss,\r\nmaking a burden easily provided for. If at the beginning of the year each\r\nhas laid aside this sum, the loss will be met when it occurs without\r\ndisturbing the welfare of any. The machinery for such provision is called\r\nan insurance company, and the separate payment of each house owner is the\r\npremium or award expressing his share of the provision. This principle of\r\nestimating losses and providing a definite way of meeting them is the same\r\nin all forms of insurance. It has been recognized for hundreds of years,\r\nbut only recently has entered into the business life of the world in all\r\ndirections. For a long time false notions of reverence for the power that\r\nwields destiny stood in the way of such distribution of misfortune; but\r\nnow the mass of people everywhere regard such foresight in united sympathy\r\nas natural as the planting of crops.\r\n\r\n_Various methods of insurance._—Satisfactory insurance rests upon certain\r\ndefinite business principles which every insurer may wisely study. There\r\nare various devices for accomplishing the same end. A body of men\r\nsufficiently large to make the average of losses uniform may bind\r\nthemselves by a simple agreement to meet each loss as it occurs. To make\r\nthis plan satisfactory they will need efficient business men as officers\r\nto devise means and methods for making the agreement effectual, for\r\nestimating the actual loss in each case, and for distribution of the claim\r\nby assessment sufficient to cover the loss and the expense of collections\r\nand estimates, as well as the maintenance of the officers. These officers\r\nmust maintain the business standing of the organization in the community,\r\nso that it shall continue for a long series of years to keep its numbers\r\nlarge enough to maintain only the average loss.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple mutual insurance company, upon the assessment plan. Its\r\nweakness lies in the comparatively slight interest taken by each member in\r\nthe selection of its officers, in the absence of security for the payment\r\nof assessments when needed, in the long delay liable to attend\r\ncollections, and the uncertain interest of the officers in exact\r\nadjustment of losses. Such companies are liable to be too small to give a\r\nfair average of losses, and in any serious emergency to fail for want of\r\nexpert business ability and trustworthy character in officers.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of the assessment after losses, a definite percentage of\r\nprobable loss is paid in advance, the responsibility for use and\r\nmaintenance of such funds calls for a business character and ability in\r\nthe officers which usually secures better results. It especially avoids\r\nthe danger of slackness and failure on the part of the insurer. It leads\r\nto closer scrutiny of actual losses, and helps the insurer to more\r\ncarefully measure his interest, since he already has an investment in the\r\nbusiness. Any overestimate of expected losses may be returned in dividends\r\nto the insured, or may be retained as a surplus for security against\r\nlosses above the average of experience. The only weakness of this method\r\nis in the power entrusted to individual officers, elected on the ground of\r\npopularity by comparative strangers. Even when a board of directors chosen\r\nfrom well-known business men is added to the machinery, the dangers from\r\nincompetent and dishonest management are not avoided. Such directors are\r\ntoo prone to consider their names their only contribution to the welfare\r\nof the association.\r\n\r\nA joint stock company, insuring with definite premium, is likely to bring\r\nthe best business management, the quickest though not always the fairest\r\nadjustment of losses, and the confidence of the business community. Its\r\nprosperity, however, is hindered somewhat by the common judgment that the\r\ninterests of the stockholders must be against the interests of the\r\ninsured. The actual cheapness of insurance depends not so much upon the\r\namounts paid from time to time as upon the actual quality of the insurance\r\npurchased. Assessment companies of all kinds, without a legal lien upon\r\ndefinite property, are decidedly lacking in quality, since their guaranty\r\nof payment involves the financial credit of every person insured. No one\r\nshould be deceived by the promise of insurance at cost, until he knows\r\nexactly how genuine that insurance will remain during the period of years\r\nfor which he desires it.\r\n\r\n_Governmental control of insurance._—The essential importance of insurance\r\nand the difficulties of providing against fraud and mismanagement have led\r\nnaturally to government inspection, and in some countries to government\r\ncontrol of insurance agencies. The laws of various states provide\r\ndifferently for inspection and reports, and restrict the action of\r\ncompanies in various directions. It is probable that time will develop the\r\nnecessity of greater uniformity of insurance laws and more definite\r\nrequirements in the way of published reports and expert inspection. At\r\npresent, insurance commissioners often have the confidence of neither\r\ncompanies nor people, and no expert knowledge is demanded in the candidate\r\nfor that office.\r\n\r\nThe desirability of insurance by government direct is questioned so long\r\nas governments themselves are unstable and popular will favors laxity in\r\nthe business machinery. That insurance could in this way be made cheaper\r\nis a matter of doubt while great masses of people magnify their claims\r\nagainst government and minify their obligations to it. Frauds against\r\ngovernment in both taxes and claims are proverbial. At any rate,\r\ngovernments will not wisely undertake the indefinite applications of\r\ninsurance until larger experience and wider acquaintance with the methods\r\nin vogue are reached.\r\n\r\n_Applications of insurance._—The applications of insurance are indefinite\r\nin variety. There is no limit to the possibilities except in the lack of\r\nexperience to settle the average of hardships. Insurance of property\r\nagainst fire and storm is well understood and almost everywhere practiced.\r\nInsurance of life is almost equally extended, in which the head of a\r\nfamily may in a measure provide against the suffering of his family in his\r\nunexpected removal by death. This is easily extended into insurance\r\nagainst accident. In this, as in life insurance, there is some lack of\r\nexperience, as yet, as to the actual cost. It is possible even to insure\r\nagainst dishonesty of employés through so-called bond and security\r\ncompanies, which issue bonds for definite amounts payable in case of\r\nfailure of the person whose character is insured to meet the expectations\r\nof his employer. Such companies, in their own interest, exercise an\r\ninfluence over the character of those for whom they have given bonds by\r\nattention to their habits of life and business methods. They make more\r\nprominent the maxim, “Honesty is the best policy,” whether they actually\r\ncultivate honesty in fact or not.\r\n\r\nThere is no conceivable limit to the possible applications of the\r\nprinciples of insurance. It seems possible that a body of business\r\nfarmers, subject as they are to so many disasters from weather, insects\r\nand contagious diseases of stock and vegetation, might devise methods of\r\nequalizing and diminishing the disaster from such losses in a common\r\nsystem of insurance. As a basis for such systematic action, careful\r\nstatistics for large regions of country are absolutely necessary. With\r\nsuch losses clearly presented and averages fairly estimated, insurance\r\nwould be just as feasible as it is now against fire. It will be wisely\r\nundertaken first upon such matters as can be most definitely measured in\r\ndollars and cents. Losses from accidents to teams and other live stock\r\nhave already been studied and insurance to a limited extent attempted. The\r\ndifficulties of such insurance are greatly increased by the ease with\r\nwhich owners may contrive to market unsalable stock through a false\r\nrepresentation of misfortune. The possibilities, however, of extending the\r\nadvantages of insurance in a business of this nature are worthy of more\r\ncareful study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH FOR WELFARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII. General Principles Of Fair Distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wealth distributed, not welfare._—In considering the principles of fair\r\ndistribution among all the parties contributing to production of wealth,\r\nit is necessary to remember that wealth and not welfare is the subject of\r\nthought. A child may have equal right to welfare with his father, but\r\ncannot in any sense have equal ownership of wealth. The welfare of a\r\ncomplete imbecile may be the care of the state, but he can in no sense\r\ncontrol wealth. Distribution of wealth cannot, therefore, include the\r\nsubjects of charity, but must be confined to a study of the natural\r\nrelations between individual owners of wealth or individual contributors\r\nto production, which make control of a portion of accumulated wealth\r\nessential to individual welfare.\r\n\r\nA pound of tea may include in its value the efforts of a hundred different\r\npersons. What are the principles upon which those hundred people may be\r\nfairly compensated by the actual consumer of the pound of tea? This\r\nillustrates the complexity of the whole subject of distribution. No\r\ndrinker of tea would dare to settle the question of fair distribution\r\narbitrarily. No one would even offer a theory by which a perfect\r\nsettlement could be reached. Yet when the pound of tea is put upon the\r\npantry shelf, the fifty cents paid for it has already been divided into a\r\nhundred unequal portions adjusted by some method of custom to meet the\r\nideas of every helper in the long list. Each has had some portion of the\r\nwealth produced, though the distribution may have taken place in different\r\ncountries, under different laws and customs, through a period of months or\r\nyears. This distribution involves the whole question of industrial\r\nfreedom, and rests finally upon the principle of equity as applied to\r\nownership of one’s powers and the product of those powers. It also\r\ninvolves, to a certain extent, the decision of what is properly wealth and\r\nwhat is properly a part of universal welfare.\r\n\r\nThe important questions connected with the subject will not be\r\nsatisfactorily settled until a reasonable adjustment of all claims is\r\nreached by the masses engaged in production. The modern discussions of the\r\ninterests of laborers are proof that the world is thinking more and more\r\nof individual rights in property, and no sweeping assertions as to\r\ninequity of property rights help to solve the questions. It is because\r\neach individual has a distinct equity in what is produced in part by his\r\nefforts that there is need of better adjustment. All reforms, therefore,\r\nmust be along the line of fair distribution, or fail of their end.\r\n\r\n_Distribution by exchange._—Ordinary observation shows that distribution\r\nis made chiefly in the customary method of exchange. A pound of butter may\r\nfind its way from the farmer’s dairy to the actual consumer in a distant\r\ncountry. In its final value, the consumer compensates the retail dealer\r\nfor his services in handling it and for advance payments, including every\r\nother handler and every other service, down to the boy who drove the cows\r\nto pasture. If the system of universal exchanges is free and fair, each\r\nhas received his fair compensation. In general, then, distribution of\r\nwealth is made automatically in the ordinary processes of production,\r\nexchange itself being one of the steps by which value to the consumer\r\nbecomes value also to the producer.\r\n\r\n_Fair exchange above laws._—Under perfect freedom of exchange, the general\r\nlaw of supply and demand already illustrated is more effective than any\r\nlaws can be in adjusting wages or profit to efforts in production, and in\r\nadjusting interest or rent or both to the capital employed or to other\r\nmeans of production controlled. Any customs or laws which interfere with\r\nnatural conditions of supply and demand hinder rather than help toward a\r\nfair adjustment. In any progressive community such laws will surely fail,\r\nfor the reason that in making such laws human nature is in conflict with\r\nitself. The history of increasing individual welfare in any part of the\r\nworld gives a story of more ready and free competition in open market for\r\nall commodities and all services. In perceiving this we must not overlook\r\nthe fact that fraud and ignorance, as well as arbitrary power, stand\r\nopposed to fair exchanges. Nor must we be satisfied with any condition\r\nwhich involves meeting restrictions with restrictions or force with force.\r\nSuch conditions must be but temporary.\r\n\r\n_Actual and nominal compensation._—In considering compensation for any\r\nservices, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the actual\r\ncompensation in welfare and the nominal compensation in money. A farmer in\r\nNebraska may get a larger return for his labor with corn at 15 cents a\r\nbushel than he could in Massachusetts with corn at 40 cents a bushel. Just\r\nso a wage-earner, receiving $1.50 a day in Ohio, might lose in welfare by\r\nexchanging work with his neighbor in New Mexico, who gets $2.50 a day.\r\nThis means that $1.50 in Ohio may buy more comfort than $2.50 can buy in\r\nNew Mexico. This is very important in comparing the wages of different\r\nclasses of workmen in the same country, as well as the wages of similar\r\nworkmen in different countries. It has an important bearing, too, upon\r\nrelative profits and interest. The actual compensation in welfare is the\r\nnatural basis for adjustment in all distribution, and the law of supply\r\nand demand rests directly upon this.\r\n\r\n_Wages, profits, interest and rent take the product._—It is common to\r\nconsider distribution as made in the forms of wages for labor given\r\nwithout risk as to the product, profits to the one whose labor is\r\nassociated with risk of loss as well as gain, interest to the one who\r\nfurnishes capital in any form and waits for his compensation, and rent to\r\nthe landlord, or owner of estate, whose property is used for a definite\r\ntime and returned. It is evident that any advantage received in any of\r\nthese ways, at any time, must come from the actual available goods in\r\nstore suitable for division and consumption. The farmer cannot pay his\r\nhired hand with his farm, though he may be able to do so with his\r\nproducts. The farmer himself cannot realize his profits until he has the\r\nproceeds of his work in the shape of consumable goods. So, at any\r\nparticular time, the total of products fit for consumption makes the\r\nsource from which all distribution must come. Debts and credits can have\r\nno consideration in the total, for the reason that they exactly offset\r\neach other. A general conflict of interested persons as to wages, profits,\r\ninterest or rent comes from the difficulty of sharing in the actual goods\r\nat hand. The relation of each to the whole depends upon circumstances to\r\nbe discussed in future chapters. It is certain that the larger proportion\r\nof daily production goes to the mass of the people who consume their share\r\nfrom day to day. It is estimated that fully 80 per cent of such wealth is\r\nused up by those who contribute no use of capital to the productive force.\r\nIt seems probable also that this ratio is increasing rather than\r\ndiminishing, but no statistics are sufficient to show the exact facts.\r\n\r\n_Cheap standards of living._—In the natural competition of laborers with\r\neach other, the general standard of living—physical, intellectual and\r\nmoral—have an important bearing. The Chinaman in this country competes\r\nwith the American upon a wholly different plane of living. His habitual\r\nneeds being less, he is willing to work for wages that will not tempt the\r\nnative American. If he can do the same work, living as he does, he\r\nnecessarily becomes a cheaper force in production, and the American must\r\nfind a better field for his energies or go without employment. Under\r\nordinary circumstances, the introduction of laborers able to live more\r\ncheaply acts upon the better class of laborers exactly like the\r\nintroduction of labor-saving machinery. It first brings hardship from\r\ndirect competition, but the cheapening of products brings enlarged demands\r\nand so gives new impetus to production, requiring the very skill which the\r\nbetter class of laborers alone can furnish.\r\n\r\nThus the employment of Chinamen upon railroad embankments made places for\r\nnative laborers as section bosses and engineers. The Huns and Italians\r\nthat underbid the Irish miners in Pennsylvania have destroyed the “Molly\r\nMcGuires” by making the same men responsible for larger enterprises. Yet\r\nthe standards of living, which show a constant improvement, indicate a\r\ntruer freedom of competition and a clearer recognition of individual wants\r\nand abilities. No one can watch the development of any country without\r\nrealizing that its thrift, enterprise and progressive welfare depend\r\nlargely upon increasing wants. Men who live best produce most and enjoy\r\nmost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII. Wages And Profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wages distinguished from profits._—In discussing the subject of wages and\r\nprofits, it is necessary to remember that both are compensation in\r\ndifferent ways for actual exertion. If in estimating profits we sometimes\r\ninclude a return for the use of capital, it is from incomplete analysis of\r\nthe forces in use, since the interest upon capital can easily be separated\r\nin all actual practice, and in most enterprises is counted as a distinct\r\nexpense to be provided for in entering upon the undertaking. The profits\r\nreally belong to the management of any undertaking, as return for the\r\nexertion in that management. In every-day use the term wages is applied\r\nonly to the stipulated amount paid from time to time for services rendered\r\nto another. There is practically no difference between such payments made\r\nfor service by the hour, day, week, month or year. If, however, the\r\nengagement for service is by the year, the name salary is more likely to\r\nbe given than wages.\r\n\r\nFurther, the term wages is most distinctly applied when the service is\r\nrendered as a task, and wage-earners when found in considerable bodies are\r\nusually called operatives, under the natural classification of labor\r\nexplained and illustrated in Chapter III (page 35).\r\n\r\nThe services of an overseer are much more likely to be permanently\r\nrequired, and his wages are therefore called a salary, estimated by the\r\nyear even though payments be made monthly or even weekly. In this case,\r\nthe labor is chiefly executive, taking a higher rank because of the\r\ngreater powers required. In this case the overseer is supposed to have\r\ndefinite plans provided for his work, and to carry out those plans to the\r\nbest of his ability.\r\n\r\nIf, in contrast with this, one’s efforts are given to managing a business,\r\ndevising the ends to be accomplished as well as planning for their\r\naccomplishment, he is said to have entire responsibility for results and\r\nto receive what he can make out of the business. His exertion is chiefly\r\nspeculative labor, and the returns for his _speculation_ or\r\nforesight—often effort of the severest kind—are termed profits. Such\r\nefforts have already been illustrated in Chapter III, page 35. No\r\ngenerally accepted name has been given to the one who thus carries the\r\nentire responsibility of the business, but the word manager conveys to\r\nmost people the general idea involved. While it is true that a manager may\r\nsometimes work for a salary, in general the very inventive ability\r\nrequired for success makes the stimulant of profits the most natural means\r\nof securing higher effectiveness. Most managers, even of stock companies,\r\nmust from the nature of the case be at least sharers in the profits.\r\nFarmers easily distinguish between those who work for stipulated wages,\r\noften called farm hands, and the farmer himself, who gets the pay for all\r\nhis endless variety of labor, including his constant planning, in the\r\nshape of profits.\r\n\r\n_Wages defined._—Hence it is fair to define wages as a stipulated sum,\r\npaid at stipulated times, for stipulated services, measured either by the\r\nnumber of distinct services or by the time of service. A wage-earner must\r\ntherefore be one who sells his powers, whatever they may be, for the use\r\nof another, bringing his own services rather than the products of those\r\nservices to the best market he can find. In general, he prefers the\r\ndefinite promise of another to the indefinite chances that he may produce\r\nwhat is to be wanted in the future market. Very often he considers the\r\nbird in the hand worth any number in the bush, and is satisfied to take a\r\ncertain living from day to day rather than risk his ability by his own\r\ncontrivance to meet larger wants. Among the wage-earners we necessarily\r\nfind all individuals of undeveloped powers of body or mind, dependent upon\r\nthe rest of the community for both tools and task; also all who render\r\npersonal services, and most of the laborers of all sorts in every kind of\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\n_Profits defined._—Profits may be defined as the indefinite returns for\r\nexertion, including all risks, which any manager of his own or others’\r\nindustry secures by bringing his products into open market. In general the\r\nterm includes the recompense for any kind of labor, however rendered, if\r\nthe uncertainty of demand and supply belongs to the one who renders the\r\nservice. Thus even the fees of a lawyer or a doctor come under the general\r\nprinciples of profits, whenever the conditions of payment in any respect\r\ndepend upon success. If, on the other hand, such fees are stipulated sums\r\nfor a stated service, they fall into the rank of wages. That the dividing\r\nline between wages and profits is not always clear is shown in comparing\r\npayment by the piece in manufacturing clothing, for instance, and payment\r\nby the hour for the same kind of work. In the payment by the piece, the\r\nstimulant of enterprise borders upon the nature of profits. In payment by\r\nthe hour, that stimulant is wanting. Yet we are likely to consider the\r\ndifference as simply a difference in method of estimating wages. Two men\r\nditching side by side may work, one by the day and the other by the rod.\r\n\r\nIt is possible even to combine the two systems of payment so as to involve\r\nboth wages and profits. Farm hands in England have been paid a certain\r\nprice per month, with a share in the profits, measured by the number of\r\ncart-loads of grain marketed. Clerks and agents frequently work for\r\nstipulated wages, with an added percentage upon the value of sales. Most\r\nfarmers in estimating the results of a year’s labor count their own\r\nservices, at the price of a hand, as a part of the cost of their products,\r\nand distinguish as profits the surplus of product above all expenditures.\r\nThus a farmer may estimate as outgo the interest on capital invested, the\r\nwear and tear of machinery, the produce consumed upon the farm, the taxes\r\npaid to the government, and the wages to all who labor, including himself\r\nand his family. Any return from his products beyond enough to meet these\r\noutgoes he will consider profits. These will reward him for extra\r\nforesight and contrivance in management and marketing, as well as risk\r\narising from possibility of failure in his plans, destruction of his crop\r\nor stock, fluctuations in price, and uncertainty of collection for his\r\nsales. Such risks and exertions every independent worker assumes. Usually\r\nthe exertions are impossible to the inexperienced, and the risks cannot be\r\ntaken without accumulated capital or a credit established upon well-known\r\ncharacter and ability. This fact naturally limits the number of\r\ncompetitors for profits. The effect is clearly illustrated in the\r\ndifference between an ordinary farm hand and the renter of a farm. Few\r\nfarmers would encourage the best of their farm hands to take the burden of\r\nrisks and care implied in renting. The successful farm renter requires\r\nabilities and means, gained only by experience and accumulation.\r\n\r\n_Wages vary with abilities employed._—The variation of wages among\r\ndifferent classes of workmen in the same calling is universally recognized\r\nas dependent upon the powers employed. The strictly operative labor is\r\nusually paid by the hour, day or week, the terms varying with the supposed\r\nstrength or skill exerted. Executive duties commanding monthly or yearly\r\nsalaries vary with the total amount of responsibility implied, the large\r\nestablishment requiring greater abilities than the small one. The strain\r\nof responsibility increases in some degree with the number of operative\r\nlaborers employed, and successful oversight of many hands may be essential\r\nto their profitable employment. In that case the salary of the overseer\r\ngains something of the nature of profits, since the manager gauges the pay\r\nby profits expected. If, as in great stock companies, a manager is hired\r\nat a stipulated salary, his personal abilities, as tested by\r\naccomplishment, are likely to be the sole gauge of wages. A successful\r\nmanager of a great enterprise can scarcely be said to have a market price\r\nfor his services, but will estimate himself in large measure by the\r\nprofits he might secure as an independent business man. Within limits,\r\nsuch salaries will vary with the experience and inventive ability\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n_Supply and demand in wages._—Wages in general are subject as truly to the\r\nlaw of supply and demand as are the products of labor. If few places are\r\nvacant and many applicants seek those places, it is impossible to prevent\r\nthe reduction of wages through the anxiety of some applicants to secure\r\nplaces. On the other hand, if few applicants seek the places open to many,\r\neach will find the employer most willing to give an increase of wages for\r\nhis work. Laws cannot prevent such natural competition, though they may\r\nhinder it. Even organization under secret bonds can only temporarily\r\nrestrain. Human nature is stronger than any arbitrary restriction.\r\n\r\nIn general, then, wages in any particular occupation may be affected\r\ndirectly by limited competition. Any necessity for peculiar abilities of\r\nbody or mind, or for preparation by education or training, makes certain,\r\nas far as it goes, a limited competition, and therefore the opportunity\r\nfor higher than ordinary wages. In the same way, if unavoidable hardships\r\nor dangers are involved, comparatively few workers will seek such\r\nemployment and can have larger pay. If, however, the dangers carry with\r\nthem a stimulating excitement and exhibition of daring, arousing\r\nadmiration for the worker, this may offset entirely the effect of the\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nSoldiers and railroad employés for such reasons do not command pay in\r\nproportion to the dangers met. Any employment where there are obstacles to\r\nnatural advancement or where continuance is uncertain does not attract\r\napplicants except by higher wages. Illustrations of all these occasions\r\nfor limited competition are found everywhere.\r\n\r\n_Stimulants to competition._—If any occupation shows circumstances making\r\nentrance easy for new applicants, or if advantages for promotion are\r\nreadily seen, or if it seems to have a special respectability with the\r\nadvantage of social privileges, especially if it in some respects seems a\r\nwork of philanthropy, there will be multitudes ready to engage, and\r\nwilling to undertake the work at less than average compensation. It is\r\ncommonly said that these peculiar advantages are a part of the\r\ncompensation. They operate simply as a stimulant to competition, making\r\nmore people willing to enter such employment at small wages than would be\r\nwilling without these special advantages.\r\n\r\nA good illustration of such employments is found in common school\r\nteaching. While a teacher does need an expensive preparation, and success\r\nis dependent upon special adaptability to the work, it is nevertheless\r\ntrue that the work can be taken up readily and as readily laid down; it\r\nconfers upon the applicant the privilege of social recognition and\r\nsomewhat of personal dignity; it gives opportunities for some note in the\r\ncommunity, and, with all, it is considered a work of philanthropic\r\ncharacter, entitling to the gratitude of the public. The result is that\r\nteachers everywhere command less of salary or wages in proportion to their\r\nabilities than other classes of wage-earners. Fortunately, this stimulant\r\nto competition appeals largely to those characteristics of the individual\r\nteacher which make him more serviceable in his calling. The opportunity\r\nfor a life of study, added to other considerations, makes still more\r\neffective the competition of earnest, philanthropic students, such as the\r\nworld needs for teachers.\r\n\r\nIn the lower ranks of teachers, competition is still more increased by the\r\nfact that common school teaching can be temporarily carried on in the\r\nintervals of study, without interfering with mental growth. Teaching is\r\nalso specially adapted for the temporary employment of young men and women\r\nnot quite ready to enter the actual life work. Acquaintance with human\r\nnature, which it fosters, is thought to be good preparation for home and\r\nbusiness life. The employments in which women largely engage as\r\nwage-earners are chiefly of this temporary character. The fact that the\r\nlife work of most women must be the making of the home hinders competition\r\nin employments where long apprenticeship or special skill of any kind may\r\nbe demanded. Any temporary employment not only appeals to her sense of\r\ncapacity for earning wages, but seems better adapted to her future. If\r\nthat employment at the same time affords opportunity for social life and\r\ncalls for the natural adornments of youth, the young woman considers wages\r\nonly a small part of the general consideration, and is satisfied with a\r\nbare living. Hence clerkships in stores, subordinate positions as teachers\r\nand places as typewriters are crowded with applicants at wages\r\ninsufficient for a life-time support. Employment in domestic service,\r\nwhich might be supposed more consistent with the larger work of life, is\r\nrendered less attractive by the almost entire absence of social privileges\r\nand natural opportunities for advancement in knowledge of the world. Girls\r\nwho would prefer house work, with equal social freedom and the natural\r\nstimulant of contact with other young people, compete for lower wages in\r\nless satisfactory employment during the years of their girlhood. This is\r\nless noticeable in country life, where girls in domestic service become a\r\npart of the household and share in the privileges of the young people at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the depressing effect upon wages of excessive\r\ncompetition is found in the work of women upon cheap clothing. This work\r\nis usually done by the piece in the home, and can be taken up at intervals\r\nbetween household duties. Many women consider earnings of this kind a mere\r\naddition of spending money to a somewhat meager support in their home\r\nlife. It can be carried on without display, and so preserves the dignity\r\nof persons who would otherwise shrink from wage earning. The result is a\r\nvery serious competition, reducing wages below even enough to sustain life\r\nand character.\r\n\r\nThese are only illustrations of what happens in every calling when\r\ncircumstances stimulate excessive competition. Relief can come only from\r\nlarger range of satisfactory employment and a clearer distinction in favor\r\nof genuine wage-earners and genuine employers among the mass of the\r\npeople. The customs of society have a much stronger influence upon the\r\nlife of women in steady employments than upon that of men. A thoroughly\r\nenlightened community can do much to enlarge the sphere of such women as\r\nare naturally wage-earners, by proper encouragement of their enterprise.\r\n\r\n_Fluctuation of wages._—Wages in every employment are just as naturally\r\nsubject to fluctuation under the law of supply and demand as are prices of\r\ncommodities. Whatever operates to increase the number seeking employment,\r\nor to diminish the amount of employment open to competition, reduces the\r\nwages. Whatever increases the opportunity for employment, or diminishes\r\nthe number of persons seeking employment, increases the wages. This is\r\nwell illustrated in the cost of harvest hands in a year of large crops as\r\ncompared with a year of small crops. Any financial disturbance, checking\r\nthe building of railroads and other great enterprises, brings multitudes\r\nof would-be farm hands to compete with those who naturally follow farming.\r\nOn the other hand, the introduction of factories or mining industries has\r\nsometimes affected directly the wages of farm hands through a large region\r\nby lessening competition.\r\n\r\n_Upward tendency of wages._—It is certain that the general tendency of\r\nwages in all employments is upward rather than downward, in spite of\r\nserious disturbances from financial depression often repeated. The gradual\r\nincrease of welfare among wage-earners is greater even than the increase\r\nin money wages. Those who are inclined to join in the cry that the former\r\ntimes were better than these can be answered as they were in Solomon’s\r\ntime, “Thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.” No doubt the\r\ntransition from small workshops to large ones and from small factories to\r\ngreat combinations has caused friction in adjustment to the new\r\nconditions. Many are now wage-earners who were once profit-gainers. But\r\nwith the improvements in association and a clearer understanding of\r\nabilities and needs, each worker becomes a stronger factor than ever\r\nbefore in bringing about a fair competition and a satisfactory\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nThere are still new difficulties in every change of method. The influence\r\nof custom often retards freedom of movement, makes more slow the natural\r\nrise of wages, and hinders a gradual adjustment to new conditions. In many\r\ncases it prevents individual enterprise among wage-earners, and crowds\r\nfrom the higher ranks into competition with the lower because of no\r\nnatural outlet for ambition. Even laws intended to protect laborers\r\nsometimes operate against them. Thus a law restricting the terms of\r\ncontract between workmen and their employer has sometimes prevented the\r\nemployer from investing capital in a business which otherwise would have\r\nincreased the opportunity for labor, and so would have actually increased\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nThe effect of free schools upon ability to earn is generally recognized.\r\nThe best estimates place the increase resulting from common school\r\neducation at fully 25 per cent. Some of the best establishments are\r\nlimiting their offers of employment to young people who have had the\r\nadvantage of even high school training. This more general education tends\r\nin two ways to increase the compensation of wage-earners: first, by giving\r\na clear knowledge of abilities that makes competition fairer; and second,\r\nby increasing the general effectiveness of all production, which enlarges\r\nthe sum to be divided.\r\n\r\nEvery movement toward greater social freedom and uniformity of opportunity\r\ncontributes to the same end. Next to slavery, social caste is the chief\r\nobstacle to free and fair competition of laborers. Any barriers of race,\r\nsocial organizations, or even churches, which cultivate exclusiveness in\r\nany direction, in the end work hardship. If they bring temporary advantage\r\nto a few, they are sure to hamper the freedom of many. The welfare of the\r\ncommunity is surest when social conditions favor the freest communication\r\nin all ranges of employment, whether in wage-earning or in profit-making.\r\n\r\nThe cheapening of transportation in recent years, bringing all the world\r\nnearer, has had various effects upon wages. It has destroyed, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, the inequality of wages between different regions of\r\ncountry. If laborers of any kind are scarce, a telegram will within a few\r\nhours bring numbers from some place where they are too plenty. The result\r\nis a tendency to greater uniformity throughout the world. As yet the full\r\neffects of this progress are not realized. Some hardships will undoubtedly\r\nbe endured from the ready introduction of unskilled laborers from crowded\r\ncountries into our less densely peopled country. But with a larger range\r\nof production opened by cheap labor, our better workmen will find more\r\nconstant and more remunerative employment. If restrictions upon\r\nimmigration are necessary, it must be to prevent too sudden a transition,\r\nhindering adjustment to new conditions. The danger of overcrowded\r\npopulation comes more certainly to the nation excluding itself from the\r\ngreat world by excluding the rest of the world from itself.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of improved machinery has been several times referred\r\nto already. Its advantages come to the wage-earner directly in multiplying\r\nemployments and in multiplying the demand by cheapening products.\r\nIndirectly, the benefits are still greater, because these cheaper products\r\nform the bulk of living for the workers. It is probable that even the\r\nbetter living thus provided has raised the efficiency of labor so as to\r\ncommand better wages. It is certain that every movement of civilization\r\nwhich gives a clearer knowledge of human nature and the world about us\r\nadds to the power of every man, whatever his work. We may welcome every\r\nelement of progress in this enlightenment as a direct help to the portion\r\nof humanity recognized as wage-earners. The better the masses of people\r\nunderstand each other the better each understands himself; and that\r\nunderstanding is the best protection against oppression of circumstances\r\nor of men.\r\n\r\n_Variation in profits._—Profits in various pursuits, like wages, are\r\naffected by limited competition. The need of special abilities and\r\nexperience in any particular undertaking keeps back the timid from that\r\nenterprise, and the accumulation of experience of a peculiar kind hinders\r\none from turning to other occupations. Even if a young man is willing to\r\ntake the risk of inexperience as a manager, he can seldom gain the\r\nconfidence of those who control capital. Hence competition in new and\r\nuntried enterprises is slight, and profits are often great. Other\r\nundertakings are of such a nature as to involve great uncertainty. The\r\nrisk of failure retards the cautious, and so the most enterprising win\r\ngreat returns. In estimating such returns, we overlook the failures and\r\ncount only the great successes. Sometimes accidental opportunities open to\r\nthe few a limited range of enormous profits. Legislation fostering\r\nmonopoly sometimes favors such opportunities. These are usually temporary,\r\nand such advantage cannot long be maintained under the most fortunate\r\nconditions. Secret methods have sometimes controlled the market for\r\nindividuals with enormous gain, and in a few instances a nation has\r\nmaintained such secrecy with apparent success. But these, too, quickly\r\nyield before competing enterprise, since wage-earners under such employers\r\nmust share to some extent the secret, and will have the stimulant of\r\nenormous profits to use the secret for themselves.\r\n\r\n_Profits in competition._—Profits are themselves a stimulant to\r\ncompetition, and competition in every pursuit tends to reduce the profits.\r\nIf any circumstance apparently insures more than average profits in any\r\nundertaking, competition becomes excessive and profits vanish. The promise\r\nof a tariff on wool leads farmers to expect an advance in the profits of\r\nsheep raising. Competition begins in the purchase of flocks, by which the\r\nprofits of those already in the business are greatly increased.\r\nCompetition continues by multiplication in the flocks until sellers of\r\nsheep are more plenty than buyers. Thus, the stimulant to competition has\r\noperated to lessen profits in the end. A famous sheep raiser in New York,\r\nwhen asked to give a maxim for success in the business, answered, “Buy\r\nwhen your neighbors sell, and sell when your neighbors buy.”\r\n\r\nSimilar experience has been noted in various pursuits. The tendency,\r\nhowever, with wider knowledge of others’ wants and efforts is toward a\r\ngreater uniformity of profits. Modern methods of production and clearer\r\nperception of ways and means make it easier for competition to have its\r\nfull effect between different kinds of business, as well as in the same\r\nbusiness. The more we know of our neighbor’s work through the daily press\r\nand extensive travel, the fairer is the opportunity for competition to\r\nact. This tendency brings hardship to the weaker portion of managers\r\nengaged in any particular business. This makes the power of so-called\r\ntrusts and great combinations apparently harmful. In the end, however, the\r\nresult is more constant profits, though smaller, and the advantage of the\r\nwhole community in a more stable business. It is even conceivable that the\r\nstimulant of fair profits may finally reach a larger proportion of the\r\ncommunity through interest in the great establishments than in the past\r\nfrom the unequal and uncertain returns of independent managers.\r\n\r\nEven among professional men, whose fees for services have somewhat the\r\nnature of profits, the same law of competition, dependent upon supply and\r\ndemand, holds sway. The compensation of an author for his publications,\r\nthough protected by copyright, is dependent upon conditions limiting\r\ncompetition or stimulating it. It is customary for surgeons, physicians\r\nand dentists to make a fee proportional to the demand for their services.\r\nThus the skilled dentist, who is wanted by ten times as many people as he\r\ncan serve, raises his price till the demand is limited to meet his\r\nstrength. This enables younger men at smaller prices to gain the\r\nopportunity to establish like reputations by doing equally good work.\r\n\r\n_Profits in agriculture._—The profits in agriculture are subject to the\r\nsame laws. Many influences operate in both directions. The limitation of\r\nland fit for agricultural purposes has a tendency in itself to increase\r\nthe profits of land-holders, under the principle of monopoly, though its\r\nchief effect is on land values. The increasing wealth of the world, and\r\nthe greatly increased wants of the civilized community, multiplying\r\nmanufactures, limit competitors more and more. The relative number of\r\nfarmers in our country is gradually diminishing, while the demand for food\r\nis actually increasing beyond the increase in population. Men are\r\npredicting every year a scarcity price for wheat,—unwisely,\r\nprobably,—through the limited range of possibilities in wheat raising. The\r\nintroduction of labor-saving machinery enables enterprising farmers to\r\ngreatly increase their product for the same number of acres, and still\r\nfurther to increase the range of management so as to make larger farms a\r\npossibility. The rapid advance of means of transportation has so widened\r\nthe range of competition as to make the farmer in one part of the world\r\ncompete with the farmers of every other part. The staple products,\r\nespecially wheat, being so easily adapted to new countries, are constantly\r\nliable to over-production. At the same time the effects of a bad season in\r\nany particular region, while reducing the crop, are not likely to advance\r\nthe price to the same extent as formerly. The opening of vast regions once\r\nconsidered deserts to a rapid settlement by farmers for the sake of the\r\nprofits in land speculation has again and again wrought changes in the\r\nentire business of agriculture. Similar effects may be expected still with\r\nthe development of South America, South Africa and Siberia.\r\n\r\nAll these facts tend now to make the profits in agriculture decline, and\r\nthe fact that farm life has certain attractions in establishing permanent\r\nhomes for families and life-time associations, contributes to this\r\ntendency by holding people to their place as farmers for at least a\r\ngeneration. The possibility of independent enterprise, even with small\r\nprofit, and the freedom of family life from interference of neighbors make\r\nlarge numbers of farmers willing to continue their business in spite of\r\nthe reduced earnings.\r\n\r\n_Fluctuation in profits._—It is proper to call attention to the rapid\r\neffects of any change in market upon the profits of any enterprise. Wages\r\nare in large measure an anticipation of profits, and so far as they are\r\naffected by changes in market prices, it is largely through estimates upon\r\naverages. Custom has much to do with wages demanded and paid, but profits\r\nare fluctuating constantly with the fluctuation of prices, with every\r\nchange of methods affecting competition, with every introduction of\r\nimproved machinery and with every accident of fortune.\r\n\r\nNo better illustration of this fact can be given than is familiar to every\r\nfarmer in comparison of results from the work of different seasons. With\r\nthe same outgo for labor he may find the profits of two successive years\r\nwide apart. One year has granted the fortune of good crops with fair\r\nprices, while the other has yielded him a half crop when the prices of his\r\nproduct in the world are low. Possibly the improved machinery in wheat\r\nraising, applicable to the great farms of Minnesota, Dakota and\r\nCalifornia, has caused him to bring a costly product into close\r\ncompetition with a cheap one. Possibly, too, he has been tempted to\r\nexcessive use of labor-saving machinery himself at too great cost for the\r\ntransition, and it is more than probable that, stimulated by the high\r\nprice of oats last year, he, with thousands of his neighbors, has made an\r\nextra crop of oats this year, to the actual destruction of the market. In\r\nall these cases the farmer himself suffers directly, while his hired hand\r\nis affected only indirectly by the unwillingness of farmers in some\r\nseasons to employ as much labor.\r\n\r\n_Profits offset by losses._—The actual profits in any enterprise are often\r\noverestimated by our failing to notice that all the waste of unthrifty\r\nundertakings comes practically out of the profits of the more thrifty.\r\nWage-earners as a class are protected against losses by frequent\r\nsettlements and by public sentiment. The losses of the unthrifty managers\r\ncome out of the accumulations of previous thrift, or else are borne by the\r\nthrifty men who have trusted them. The bulk of bad debts in failure of any\r\nenterprise is for materials, machinery, etc., furnished by other\r\nproducers. In great financial depression, the profit-makers bear the evil\r\ndirectly, while the wage-earners feel the effects in the lessened\r\ncompetition for their service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX. Conflict Between Wage-Earners And Profit-Makers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The nature of the conflict._—The mutual interest of all whose energies\r\nare used in production, that the total product of wealth should be as\r\ngreat as possible, is often disturbed by doubt as to the fair division of\r\nwhat is produced. Under the modern factory system, the multitude sustain\r\nthe relation of employés to a comparatively few employers. Antipathies are\r\nliable at any time to arise between these two classes of workers. Those\r\nwho officially control wealth in great enterprises are subject to\r\nsuspicion of unfair treatment of their less independent employés.\r\nIgnorance among the mass of laborers of the intricacies of business life\r\ncontributes to such suspicion. In fact, the so-called conflict of capital\r\nand labor is a struggle for and against profits. Interest and rent are\r\nonly indirectly involved in the question. The manager’s profits may be\r\nassumed by both manager and wage-earners to arise from reduction of wages.\r\nThe necessary reticence of business managers and the frequent arbitrary\r\ndecisions as to wages help the wage-earner to feel that his interests\r\nconflict with those of his employer.\r\n\r\nIt is well for all to realize that this conflict, when there is one, is\r\nnot so much between the rich and the poor as between the struggler for\r\nprofits and the struggler for wages. In many instances the true solution\r\nlies in the same direction, if both could see the facts alike. It is an\r\nacknowledged fact that generous wages make enlightened, energetic\r\nlaborers, and that greater profits come in the long series of undertakings\r\nfrom the most intelligent service. A farm-hand at $20 a month is sometimes\r\nworth more than two at $15. On the other hand, if markets are low and\r\nprofits decline, permanence of employment will depend upon a readiness of\r\nwage-earners to accept a new adjustment of wages to conditions. Everything\r\nwhich fosters a better understanding between profit-makers and\r\nwage-earners contributes to the welfare of both. Everything which hinders\r\nsuch understanding injures the welfare of both. The cost of such friction\r\nis borne by both parties. But in the long run, the wage-earners are liable\r\nto carry the larger part. Even the destruction of property by rust, decay,\r\nor even violence, comes back upon the wage-earners who might have been\r\nemployed in its use, quite as truly as upon the manager whose profits and\r\naccumulations are wasted.\r\n\r\n_Obstacles to fair understanding._—The necessary ills connected with\r\nadvancing civilization, in the laying aside of old methods for new, in the\r\nadoption of extensive machinery, and in the more perfect competition with\r\nthe world, fall upon both profit-maker and wage-earner. The wage-earner\r\nfeels the immediate loss of his usual opportunities. The profit-maker\r\nfeels the weight of providing new machinery, devising new methods and\r\ntaking the longer range of chances. All these ills are met in time by\r\nintelligent and hopeful struggles for the best. In the worst conditions\r\never brought by improved machinery, a very few years have brought relief\r\nand improvement to the very class of laborers injured.\r\n\r\nThe danger is that wholesome competition upon a clear basis of fair\r\nunderstanding and free range of enterprise may be checked by legislation\r\nor organization for class purposes. Against the interests of the mass of\r\nthe people are all extended franchises, giving arbitrary control for long\r\nperiods of years over any industry; monopolies sustained by patent rights\r\nor protective duties; trusts, so far as they imply a combination of men to\r\nresist the law of supply and demand; and laws which in any way favor one\r\nclass of people engaged in one kind of industry as opposed to any or every\r\nother.\r\n\r\nQuite as prominent are those hindrances which come from every kind of\r\nfraud, including adulteration and misrepresentation of products, deception\r\nas to market conditions, false credit, and violence of every kind. The\r\nmore perfect the light thrown upon all the conditions of production, the\r\nbetter the understanding which all men may have of a neighbor’s welfare,\r\nand the easier it is to put ourselves in our neighbor’s place.\r\n\r\n_Strikes._—The methods of warfare between wage-earners and profit-makers\r\nare quite generally understood under the names of strikes, boycotts and\r\nlockouts. The occasion for a strike, which means a sudden stopping of work\r\nby the employés of an establishment, is usually some question of immediate\r\nadvantage to the workmen. A desire for increased wages, fewer or different\r\nhours of labor, or the removal of some restriction upon habits or\r\nassociations, gradually becomes general, and through some permanent or\r\ntemporary organization united action is taken. Quite frequently a strike\r\nis occasioned by a sudden and apparently arbitrary reduction of wages,\r\naffecting a large body of men. Many strikes are inaugurated in the\r\ninterests of discharged workmen, when the organization to which they\r\nbelong is supposed to be interested.\r\n\r\nThus a strike is always a form of warfare, and should be entered upon only\r\nafter the same careful consideration that makes war sometimes a necessity.\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances and upon general principles, no body of\r\nworkmen has any more right to suddenly stop work without notice than\r\nrailway managers have to stop a daily milk train. The end to be secured\r\nmust be important enough to humanity to overbalance the injury of the\r\nstrike itself.\r\n\r\nSince a strike is an effort to produce a corner in the labor market, it\r\nwill succeed in the end sought only when conditions for cornering the\r\nmarket are favorable. Even then the loss to the entire community is\r\nconsiderable. The injury to property, while directly borne by the\r\nprofit-makers, is widely distributed. First, all wages stop and\r\nwage-earners suffer. Second, ability to pay debts ceases and capital\r\nowners suffer. Third, insurance companies have their risks increased and\r\nall insurers suffer. Fourth, the market for the products is demoralized\r\nand all consumers suffer. Fifth, almost always social disorder results,\r\npolice expenses are greatly increased, and all taxpayers suffer. Sixth, in\r\nthe end the relation between employers and employed is more strained and\r\nless free than before, so that all humanity suffers.\r\n\r\nThe chances of success, as indicated by the record of many years, are\r\nsmall, and apparent successes are often temporary. And yet the world\r\nrecognizes the right of a body of laborers to strike, just as it\r\nrecognizes the right of revolution to secure the general welfare. Formerly\r\na combination of workmen in a strike was treated as a conspiracy and\r\npunished as such. Now the general rule is absolute freedom of combination\r\nwith rigorous repression of fraud and violence. This enables any body of\r\nmen to make a serious test of the conditions of a labor market, at the\r\nrisk, primarily, of their own welfare, but with serious strain upon the\r\ngeneral good. It leaves room for the possible breaking down of old\r\ncustoms, which are stronger than law, and it sometimes proves, like a war\r\nfor liberty, a means of great enlightenment to those who take part in it.\r\nIt is properly held as the last resort in the struggle for fair\r\nrecognition of the rights and necessities of wage-earners.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that the tendency to strikes among the more skilled\r\nworkmen is diminishing, and that the mass of communities are weighing\r\ntheir own interests more carefully as they see the general destructiveness\r\nof the method. At present strikes are expected among laborers of least\r\nskill, where they are, from usual conditions, least effective. Strikes are\r\nfrequent among coal miners, where wages are liable to reach the lowest\r\npossible mark because of the ease of competition from all parts of the\r\nworld, though the effect of such strikes in bettering the condition of\r\nminers has scarcely been felt. The fact that destruction of property and\r\nthe natural waste from strikes is so widely distributed among workmen and\r\nconsumers retards popular sympathy, and the fact that strikes increase the\r\nrisk of capital employed, and actually reduce the amount of capital in\r\nuse, diminishes the chance of increasing wages or comfort in those\r\nemployments where they are likely to occur. It seems evident that some\r\nbetter remedy for oppressive conditions of wage-earners must take the\r\nplace of strikes.\r\n\r\n_The boycott._—The boycott is a comparatively recent device for enlarging\r\nthe field of combat to include not only the employés of an establishment\r\nbut the consumers of its products. This is especially applicable to those\r\nindustries the products of which are largely consumed by wage-earners,\r\nwhose sympathies can be depended upon to carry it out. It asks all\r\nsympathizers to refuse to purchase products from the employer or firm\r\nattacked. A great bakery, for instance, can easily be ruined by a boycott,\r\nif its customers are chiefly wage-earners. It is easily applied in cases\r\nwhere custom has allowed the use of a label from some organization of\r\nworkers. It has been attempted with some success against a railroad so\r\nrelated to other roads as to require the services of sympathizers with its\r\nstriking employés to carry its freight to final destination. An instance\r\nof its widest application is in an effort to persuade the people of a city\r\nto refuse to patronize the street-car system.\r\n\r\nThe warlike nature of this method is apparent in the effort to use terror\r\nas one means of persuasion. In this case it uniformly overreaches itself\r\nin destroying public sympathy with the strikers. That it has a possible\r\nplace in the struggle of wage-earners for their rights cannot be disputed,\r\nsince it corresponds with the nature of a blockade or a siege in other\r\nwarfare. But its nature as a method of warfare is equally clear, and its\r\nuse in the interests of humanity belongs, with all war, as a last resort.\r\n\r\n_The lockout._—Lockout is a name given to a method employed by managers to\r\nprevent the continuance of a strike by aid of the sympathy of employés not\r\ndirectly interested. It often happens that a comparatively small body of\r\nworkmen in a great factory strike for higher wages, and are sustained in\r\ntheir strike by the sympathy and support of other workmen in the same\r\nfactory. Under these conditions the employer is tempted to stop all work\r\nby a sudden closing of all shops, that the pressure of suffering among a\r\nlarge body of wage-earners may force the smaller body to accept the old\r\nconditions. The lockout seldom gains a popular sympathy, for the reason\r\nthat employers appear to be using this method of warfare from a superior\r\nposition of power. And yet no one can dispute the general right of\r\nemployers to control of their business. Such a sudden stopping of business\r\nwithout an attack by a strike or some similar provocation would be\r\nconsidered inhuman, and popular sympathy would be wholly with the laborers\r\nand consumers interested.\r\n\r\n_General evils of such conflicts._—The incidental effects of such violent\r\nopposition between profit-makers and wage-earners are certainly\r\ndetrimental to all interests. The great multitude of farmers throughout\r\nthe country depend for welfare upon the body of people using farm\r\nproducts, and all the waste of power from enforced idleness of\r\nwage-earners, managers and machinery is shared by farmers through\r\ndiminished power of the rest of the world as consumers. In only a few\r\ninstances have strikes affected agriculture directly, partly because the\r\nrelations of employer and employed are so largely personal; partly because\r\nthe supply of agricultural laborers for the season is usually large; but\r\nchiefly because wage-earners upon farms in this country expect eventually\r\nto become themselves proprietors, and so no separate organization is\r\nprobable. In some countries, however, where wage-earners in farming\r\ncommunities are a class by themselves, a strike has been the only method\r\nby which the barrier of custom and law, built up through many generations,\r\ncould be broken. The great agricultural strike in England will always be\r\nremembered as having elevated the standard of labor and living in that\r\ncountry. It is to the interest of all farmers to cultivate a better\r\nunderstanding between employers and employed than can be maintained with\r\nany general expectation of strikes, boycotts, lockouts or similar warlike\r\nmethods of settling fair wages.\r\n\r\n_Trades’ unions._—The organizations known as trades’ unions, in which the\r\nwage-earners in any particular kind of business unite for self-protection,\r\nhave had a gradually widening influence upon the relation of managers to\r\nemployés. Once they were characterized as “machinery by which 10 per cent\r\nof the working classes combine to rob 90 per cent,” because the advantage\r\nsecured usually comes out of the consumers of products. But today\r\nreasonable doubts of the general advantage of a well-managed trades’ union\r\nhave disappeared. If once they seemed a conspiracy against society in\r\ngeneral, they are now recognized as a part of the general progress in\r\nmutual recognition of rights and privileges. It seems right to expect from\r\nthem still larger usefulness, with a clearer perception of their\r\nimportance. It is evident that they contribute somewhat to general\r\nintelligence of their members, and so far as this is true they help toward\r\ngreater efficiency. At the same time they help to maintain stability of\r\nemployment and stability of other conditions surrounding labor.\r\n\r\nA brief enumeration of ends they may serve directly will help to\r\nappreciate their importance. First, they can as truly estimate the market\r\nvalue of wages by gathering statistics from all parts of the country and\r\nfrom other countries as can any organization in commerce estimate the\r\nmarket value of produce. Second, they can serve as an employment bureau in\r\nfurnishing information of places where work is wanted, thus equalizing the\r\nadvantages as well as the burdens of their associates. Third, they can\r\nmake more uniform and more satisfactory the customs in regard to the\r\nlength of a day’s work or privileges of any kind associated with the work\r\nas perquisites. Fourth, they can, if they will, find the true gradation of\r\nskill and of wages among workmen, so as to establish a natural line of\r\nadvancement. Fifth, they rightly do, and can still further, serve for\r\nmutual support in cases of illness, and for protection of a community\r\nagainst fraud in pleas of poverty. Sixth, they may easily and properly, if\r\nthey will, provide for insurance of character, both as men and as workmen,\r\nby issuing certificates, and under proper provision giving bonds, such as\r\nare required in many positions of trust. Seventh, they may extend their\r\noperations even to the taking of jobs that require a variety of work\r\ncontinuing through a period of time. Eighth, they can, under most\r\nfavorable circumstances, undertake various stock enterprises, especially\r\ncoöperative stores, thus securing an incentive to saving, and diminishing\r\nthe spirit of antagonism against the profit-makers. Finally, though they\r\nhave the best possible organization for a successful strike, if necessary,\r\nthey can subordinate this disposition toward warfare to a broader\r\nmachinery for fair consideration of all interests and for individual\r\narbitration of rights.\r\n\r\nSuch organizations, under good management, win the respect of all, and\r\nfind a recognition of their methods satisfactory. Farmers’ clubs and\r\ngranges, though far from reaching ideal efficiency, furnish suggestions of\r\nthe general utility. Unfortunately, these organizations, having little if\r\nany basis of capital, have seldom been incorporated under the laws of the\r\nstate. Could the powers and purposes of such organizations be established\r\nupon a basis of statute law, the range of their usefulness might be\r\ngreatly increased. They might even sustain a method for enforcing in the\r\ncourts the collection of wages, where the single wage-earner often accepts\r\nthe half loaf in a compromise rather than meet the expense and loss of\r\ntime involved in a law suit. Certainly the establishment of legal\r\nrelations between the trades’ union and the state would give to it a\r\ncharacter and stability most likely to promote all interests.\r\n\r\n_Federations of labor._—The so-called federations of labor, in which\r\npractically the only bond of union between individuals is the fact that\r\nall are wage-earners, have so far worked out but a small part of the\r\nproblem involved in their existence. They have the advantage of uniting\r\nlarge numbers and a variety of interests; but they have the disadvantage\r\nof subordinating all other interests to the supposed conflict between\r\nemployers and employed. Their tendency is almost certain toward lowering\r\nstandards of efficiency, and attempting by class legislation to get the\r\nadvantage of mere numbers.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible that the organization shall be kept out of the\r\nfield of bargains in politics and contrivance for special legislation,\r\ndemoralizing to the whole country. Too often the votes of members are made\r\na bribe for securing certain favors. In the nature of the case, they\r\nsustain a body of officers whose chief business is in danger of becoming\r\nthat of either political agitators or political bosses. The machinery of\r\norganization is liable to reduce the independence of individuals. The\r\norganization itself is liable to demand a personal subordination almost\r\nequivalent to military rule, and the badge of the society may mark a man\r\nas under direction of authority. Even in questions where the majority\r\nrule, the force of the federation requires the caucus principle of\r\nabsolute adherence, even though the majority represents the weakest and\r\nleast intelligent part of the organization. The demoralizing effect of\r\nsuch methods, including wholesale trading of opinions, is liable to debase\r\ncitizenship, and so to diminish the individual self-respect, which is the\r\nhighest possible protection for laborers.\r\n\r\n_Courts of arbitration._—Arbitration between employers and employed, in\r\ncases of serious misunderstanding, has long been advocated as a wise means\r\nof settling differences. The obstacles to its general, voluntary adoption\r\nare considerable. Employers object because it involves the admission of an\r\noutsider as a judge of their business methods. The employés object because\r\nthey fear the sympathy of arbitrators with the superior intelligence,\r\nwealth and power of employers. Yet there seems no good reason why a\r\nrepresentative body of men, chosen for character and ability, should not\r\nbe appealed to by both parties in a contest which has already broken up\r\nthe natural relations of business. As has been shown, the whole community\r\nsuffers in every interruption of production and trade, and so far the\r\ncommunity has the right, and should have the legal privilege, of insisting\r\nupon the fairest and quickest means of settling the controversy. In far\r\nless important difficulties between individuals, society insists that\r\neither individual shall have the right to bring the other into court.\r\n\r\nSociety is waiting only to settle the best form of a court of arbitration\r\nfor labor difficulties. The trend of popular judgment is in favor of a\r\nwell-organized commission, having the dignity if not the authority of a\r\nsupreme court. That such commissions have not generally come up to the\r\nideal is due largely to political influence among leaders of\r\norganizations, so that the commissioners become the choice of a faction\r\nrather than of the people. It is conceivable that the functions of judges\r\nin a series of state courts may be so enlarged under carefully framed laws\r\nas to include the duty of arbitration in labor contests.\r\n\r\nIf the people are not yet ready for compulsory settlement of such\r\nquestions, the time is surely coming, under the enormous aggregation of\r\nindustries and the immense combination of employés, when the judgment of\r\nthe people expressed in due form of law will control both employer and\r\nemployé. The whole world is recognizing methods of arbitration as better\r\nthan warfare. It will soon insist that these minor wars within the\r\ncommonwealth shall cease.\r\n\r\n_Profit-sharing._—Some general system of preventing antipathy between\r\nprofit-makers and wage-earners seems desirable. Certain interests are\r\nknown to be mutual, and both employers and employed welcome any system by\r\nwhich those mutual interests can further the success of the business.\r\nAmong the methods proposed, and sometimes successfully employed, the most\r\nprominent is profit-sharing. This implies on the part of employers after\r\npayment of current wages a distribution, at stated times, far enough apart\r\nto secure a fair average in the profit and loss account, of some portion\r\nof net profits among all the wage-earners. The per cent of net profits to\r\nbe thus distributed is matter of agreement, and the basis of distribution\r\nis naturally the scale of wages accepted by the employés in their contract\r\nfor employment. The particular methods of applying these principles vary\r\nwith circumstances, but in all cases depend upon the actual confidence of\r\nemployés in their employers. The effects seem to be good, bad or\r\nindifferent, in proportion to the general intelligence and stability of\r\nthe employés. With really skilled workmen, established in homes and\r\nfeeling responsibility as citizens, profit-sharing stimulates to the\r\nhighest energy. With weak and irresponsible wage-earners it is likely to\r\nbring waste and sometimes false notions in regard to wealth production.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the whole system is the lack of provision for fairly\r\nsharing burdens in the constantly recurring periods of loss. If the\r\nemployé’s share of the profits is consumed upon comfort or luxury, he is\r\neven less prepared than without such profits to meet the loss of not only\r\nprofits, but his wages, in times of depression. If these additional\r\nearnings shared as profits become an insurance to the wage-earner, a sort\r\nof reserve for sustenance and safety in the necessary times of weakness in\r\nany industry, they stimulate the best characteristics of saving and\r\ncharacter-building, and cultivate a disposition to meet all emergencies in\r\npatience. It is quite customary, therefore, in any system of\r\nprofit-sharing to provide also an investment for the employés in a reserve\r\nfund, from which the necessities of the business and the needs of the\r\nwhole community of workers may be met. Such a method, if wisely managed,\r\nmakes the interests of the employés coincide with those of the employer.\r\nIf added to this there is ample opportunity for suggestions as to\r\nenlargement and improvement of the business in all minutiæ, the best\r\nabilities of the workmen are called out and the heartiest sympathy is\r\npossible. There still remains against such a system the objections, that\r\nlosses are not shared as truly as profits, and that employés are liable to\r\nrequire too intimate an acquaintance with the condition of their\r\nemployer’s business to foster the success of the enterprise. Its\r\nsuccessful application is so far confined to lines of business easily\r\ncomprehended and direct in their methods.\r\n\r\n_Sliding scales of wages._—Another device for connecting directly with the\r\nfluctuations of business any compensation of wage-earners is called the\r\nsliding scale of wages. This is an attempt to make each sharer in\r\nproduction depend directly upon the price of products in the market for\r\nrate of wages. The wages of different workers are adjusted to each other\r\nby contract upon some ratio established by experience, and then the wages\r\nof each are made to vary from month to month with the average price of the\r\nfinished product in the general market. This subjects all parties directly\r\nto the fluctuations of the business in both profit and loss. Its success\r\nis dependent upon the confidence placed by employés in the fairness of the\r\nadjustment. It stimulates to highest productiveness when prices are high,\r\nand checks production slightly when prices are low. But it provides no\r\ndirect method for readjusting business under the pressure of great changes\r\nin methods of management, nor does it save from strong antipathy against\r\nthe improvement of a business by labor-saving machinery. Its successful\r\nemployment depends in general upon the character and efficiency of\r\nemployers and the general intelligence and enterprise of employés.\r\n\r\n_Coöperative industry._—Coöperative industries are sometimes advocated as\r\na complete solution of labor difficulties. The system implies a union of\r\nindependent workmen, all of whom shall be sharers in the capital employed\r\nas well as in the labor involved, including management. The management of\r\nthe enterprise is entrusted to chosen members of the coöperative force,\r\nand wages or salaries are fixed according to abilities employed,\r\nessentially upon the scale of current wages outside the coöperative\r\nenterprise. All profits are then shared among all members of the\r\nassociation in proportion to their wages. But an investment of such\r\nprofits in the growth of the business is an essential part of the plan.\r\n\r\nThis method satisfies the ideal of equity in division of wealth produced,\r\nprovided the basis of adjustment between classes of wage-earners is\r\naccepted as fair. The principal difficulty in this respect arises in\r\nreference to the salary of managers and overseers. Such salaries are less\r\nclearly defined in the labor market, being usually complicated with\r\nprofit-making, and are liable to be considered out of all proportion with\r\nthe wages of other workers. If underestimated, the marked abilities\r\nrequired in management are likely to be withdrawn from the enterprise for\r\nindependent management in profit-making.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulties, however, with coöperative production grow from the\r\nwant of confidence of the multitude of shareholders in their managers. Few\r\nkinds of business can be carried on successfully under a body of absolute\r\nrules, and fewer still will bear the delays and hesitation required for a\r\ngeneral consultation of many authorities. The comparatively few instances\r\nof genuine success in coöperative production are due, in the first place,\r\nto the comparative simplicity of the undertaking; and, in the second\r\nplace, to the genius of some organizer, who has been willing to contribute\r\nhis superior abilities for the sake of the enterprise itself rather than\r\nthe compensation.\r\n\r\nA few principles may be fairly drawn from the general experience. First,\r\nall shareholders must be actual workers, in some way responsible for a\r\npart of the production. Second, the influence of each shareholder must in\r\nsome way be held in direct ratio to his share in the production. Third,\r\nthe system of accounts must be such as all can fairly understand. Fourth,\r\nthe management must be entrusted to a chosen few, whose interests are\r\nchiefly in the business itself, whose character secures the confidence of\r\nall, and whose administrative ability is not too much hampered by rules.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity for coöperative industry is nowhere greater than in a\r\ncommunity of farmers. Butter and cheese factories, cold storage plants and\r\nmilk stations invite the coöperation of interested farmers upon the\r\nsimplest possible basis of agreement. The multiplication of such\r\nenterprises is desirable, and the farmers of every community may\r\nprofitably study the conditions of success. The greatest obstacle\r\nheretofore, has been the want of competent management, and the distrust\r\naroused and maintained by the inefficiency and fraud of managers. It is\r\npossible, too, that farmers generally do not recognize the actual\r\nimportance of executive abilities, and are unwilling to pay the salary\r\nactually earned by a thoroughly competent man.\r\n\r\n_Legal restrictions as to labor._—It is natural for those who suffer in\r\nthe struggle for better wages to seek the support of law in restrictions\r\nupon contracts as to wages, hours of employment and conditions of comfort.\r\nThe principle that governments must protect the weak against the strong in\r\nany community is a thoroughly established one. Yet its applications are\r\nsubject to continual readjustment. Multitudes of experiments have been\r\ntried, affecting the whole range of inequalities in wages and perquisites.\r\nIn many instances, wages have been fixed by law, and that for long periods\r\nof time, but without relieving in any respect the actual force of\r\ncompetition among wage-earners themselves. Indeed, the tendency of very\r\nexplicit enactments is to weaken the individual ability of wage-earners by\r\ndestroying ambition. Wages fixed by law are necessarily as low as the\r\naverage would be in a free competition; otherwise production is hindered\r\nand capital is diminished. With this low average any worker of more than\r\naverage ability gains nothing by exerting his ability, but does gain ease\r\nby neglect. Thus enforced uniformity reduces the energy of the producing\r\nforces and practically closes the doors of advancement from wage-earning\r\nto profit-making.\r\n\r\nA similar effect is found in efforts to regulate the hours of labor by\r\nlaw, except where the law simply defines the meaning of a day’s work or\r\nemphasizes the importance of public health and vitality rather than\r\nequality in distribution. Humanity has done much in reducing hours of\r\ntoil, and may yet do more; but it will be for humanity’s welfare in larger\r\nconsiderations than are measured by money. The eight-hour question, so\r\nconstantly agitated in certain callings, concerns the entire people just\r\nso far,—and no farther,—as the general health and energy of the community\r\ndepend upon it. Farming communities stand aloof from its application; and\r\nyet there is no question that the farmer’s home might be even better than\r\nit is for developing physical and mental vigor, if hours of toil were more\r\ncarefully restricted to meet the conditions of healthful growth and\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nOther conditions, affecting the employment of children and women, are\r\nproper subjects of restriction by law; for these also involve the\r\nconsideration of general welfare in the elevation of the physical, mental\r\nand moral characteristics of the race. Upon the same plane must be put all\r\nlegal restrictions upon methods and machinery, reducing the dangers from\r\naccident and promoting the comfort of employés. All restrictions serve\r\ntheir purpose only so long as they are appreciated as having their reason\r\nfor existence in general welfare. The rights of an employer, under\r\ncontract with his employé, like the rights of a parent in control of his\r\nchild, are subject to the law of good will; and the world will yet find a\r\nway to make its restrictions felt wherever recklessness or carelessness or\r\ngreed destroys good will.\r\n\r\n_Nationalization of industry._—A somewhat popular suggestion in solution\r\nof labor difficulties is the so-called nationalization of industry. This,\r\nin general terms, is a proposition to equalize compensation and avoid\r\nfluctuation in both wages and employment by public control of all\r\nindustries under official management. While this involves some principles\r\nof socialism, more properly discussed in connection with consumption of\r\nwealth, its relations to productive industry may be briefly presented\r\nhere. The plans proposed are as yet expressed only in most general terms.\r\nEven the method of bringing about such a revolution of thought, feeling\r\nand action has not been devised. Still less ready is anyone to point out\r\nthe details of a plan for the actual production. The nearest associated\r\nideas are found in governmental services through a post office department\r\nor the management of a system of transportation. Most advocates of the\r\nmethod overlook the fact that in such government administration of partial\r\nindustries the law of competition is still operative between these\r\nenterprises and the universal industry of the people.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in governmental management under present conditions are\r\nanything but small, especially under popular rule, where the dominion of\r\nparty and the influence of position are all-powerful. Under monarchial\r\nrule the organization of such industries becomes like that of an army, in\r\nwhich arbitrary power predominates. It seems easy to see that any effort\r\nto solve the problems of labor employment by national control involves\r\nfinally the arbitrary decision of power, in adjustment of both duties and\r\ncompensation. The management by officials, however those officials are\r\nappointed, is not necessarily wiser, more efficient or more benevolent\r\nthan the management by interested men, whose life is in natural contact,\r\nthrough business relations, with employés. Those who have had experience\r\nwith official control under popular government are not likely to expect a\r\nreadjustment of all interests from the standpoint of politicians to be\r\nmarked by either universal good will or universal common sense. It is\r\nreasonable to suppose that wherever general welfare in actual use of\r\nwealth can be best promoted by public control, such control will come\r\nthrough the free exercise of individual judgment with reference to the\r\nwork in hand. While there ought to be no objection on the part of any to a\r\ngovernment enterprise which can be shown to serve in that way the greatest\r\ngood of all, nobody ought to assume that the nationalization of industries\r\nis for the greatest good. Each great undertaking will require its own\r\nproof, not only of the welfare to be expected, but of the practical means\r\nby which that end can be secured.\r\n\r\n_The spirit of equity chief._—The trend of experience goes to show that\r\ntrue economic interests, not only of the community but of individuals, are\r\nin accord with general principles of welfare. It seems certain that\r\ncommunities paying the highest wages are those which gain the highest\r\nreturn for labor in product, and maintain the highest general rates of\r\nprofit. In general, also, those enterprises which are controlled with most\r\ncare for equity in wages and for the general welfare of employés are most\r\nstable under fluctuations of business and most genuinely successful. While\r\nwealth may be accumulated unjustly in the hands of those who oppress their\r\nneighbors, there can be no doubt that in long periods of time the best\r\nadjustment of all interests gives not only the truest welfare but the\r\nlargest wealth and the best use of it. The spirit of equity must\r\neventually control both managers and wage-earners, and no other\r\ndisposition can furnish a final solution of the problems of distribution\r\nbetween employers and employed. If employers are greedy, the wrong will\r\nnot be righted by an equal display of greed on the part of wage-earners.\r\nThe spirit of true philanthropy is the only proper spirit for discussion\r\nof these questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX. Proceeds Of Capital: Interest And Rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Practical distinctions._—The terms interest and rent are distinguished in\r\nactual practice by the fact that interest is paid for the use of capital\r\nin some circulating form, while rent is paid for the use of fixed capital.\r\nOne who borrows anything, expecting to return not the thing itself but its\r\nequivalent in value, is said to borrow upon interest. One who borrows the\r\nsame thing, expecting to return the identical thing, is said to pay rent\r\nfor its use. Thus interest is paid for control of circulating capital\r\nuntil an equivalent is returned, and rent is paid for control of fixed\r\ncapital until the same articles are returned in prime condition. A farmer\r\nwho borrows a mowing machine from the warehouse, giving his note for its\r\nvalue, pays, when he returns that value at the end of the year, interest\r\nupon his note. If he borrows the same machine from his neighbor under\r\ncontract to return the machine in good condition at the end of the season,\r\nhe pays rent for its use. The young man who borrows his neighbor’s farm,\r\nexpecting at the end of five years to make that farm his own, gives a\r\nmortgage note, promising at the end of five years to return an equivalent\r\nvalue for the farm, with annual interest. If, on the contrary, he expects\r\nto return the farm itself at the end of five years, without reduction in\r\nvalue, he makes a lease, embodying this agreement, with annual rent for\r\nuse of the farm.\r\n\r\nBoth interest and rent are liable to involve the element of risk as to the\r\nproper return of the valuable thing promised, and to that extent they\r\npartake of the nature of profits. The true interest and rent are\r\nindependent of the possible risk, and have to do simply with the advantage\r\nnaturally accruing to the possessor of wealth from its use as capital, and\r\nforming one of the chief reasons for accumulating wealth at all.\r\n\r\nIn technical discussion the term rent is usually confined to the\r\ncompensation secured from appropriation of space, peculiar location,\r\nnatural fertility, mineral deposits, water privileges, or any natural\r\nadvantage to be used in production. In this limited meaning rent is\r\nconfined to the advantage gained by the owner of wealth in any form so\r\naffected by the law of supply and demand as to gain a scarcity value. The\r\nterm unearned increment,—meaning an increase of value without cost of\r\nexertion,—has been largely applied to such cases, and illustrations are\r\ntaken chiefly from the ownership of land and similar natural forces. The\r\nsame unearned increment, however, accrues to the possessor of any article\r\nof value or any personal attainment, which through increasing wants of the\r\ncommunity becomes, on that account alone, more valuable in market. Thus a\r\nbin full of wheat, saved from a year of plenty to a year of scarcity, has\r\ngained a value abnormal,—that is, from the fact of its scarcity. Yet no\r\none would think of applying the term rent in such a ease, because the\r\nforesight which stored the grain gains its compensation in profits. If the\r\nsame kind of foresight has plotted a city upon wild lands, and held a\r\nportion of those plotted lots until a crowded population competes for\r\ntheir use, such wealth is said to be gained upon the principle of rent.\r\nThe difference seems to be chiefly in the greater permanence and the\r\ngradual advancement of the profits secured.\r\n\r\nThe every-day operations of a farming community illustrate both interest\r\nand rent in all their complications and definitions. Every farmer, in\r\nestimating the cost of his wheat crop, may properly calculate both the\r\ninterest on his capital invested in tools, teams, machinery and wages, and\r\nthe rent of his land, keeping distinct accounts of interest and rent; or\r\nhe may combine in one account as interest the use of capital in machinery\r\nand land. If he owns the whole establishment, he is likely to combine both\r\ninterest and rent with the return for his foresight and energy in managing\r\nthe farm under the name profits. All these returns, however, come for\r\ndifferent reasons, though under the same general principle of values\r\nexpressed in the law of supply and demand. The farmer working a rented\r\nfarm and the one working a mortgaged farm are alike paying both rent and\r\ninterest, since every farm involves both the wealth accumulated by\r\nexertion and the wealth advanced by increasing population. While the owner\r\nof the mortgaged farm apparently pays interest, if at the end of the term\r\nof the mortgage the farm is returned to its former owner by foreclosure,\r\nthe result is that the mortgagee, while nominally owner of the land, has\r\nsimply been a renter. In a fair settlement of equities he will have paid\r\nfor the use of the land he has cultivated. Interest and rent are thus seen\r\nto be terms separated rather by peculiarities of application than by\r\ndifference of principle. It is proper, however, to treat them separately\r\nfor the sake of more perfect understanding of the conditions applicable to\r\neach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI. Principles Of Interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reasons for interest._—The propriety of interest under any circumstances\r\nhas often been questioned, and its rightfulness is still bitterly\r\ndisputed. Both church and state have at times denounced the receiving of\r\ninterest as criminal. Yet in actual practice of commercial life throughout\r\nthe world interest has been sustained in all ages. The Jewish law\r\nprohibited interest between neighbors, where the reason for borrowing was\r\nassumed to be poverty, but authorized it in dealings with foreigners,\r\nwhere the transaction was assumed to be in trade. The principle upon which\r\ninterest in all productive industry is actually founded is that capital,\r\ngained by exertion and saved by self-control, secures to its present\r\npossessor such advantages of time and choice of use for his abilities as\r\ncan be given by nothing else. In the study of production we have seen that\r\ntime-saving is an important result of capital in its various forms. A\r\ncarpenter’s kit of tools represents a value in use equal at least to the\r\ntime he might consume in making them. He can afford to keep them for\r\nanother’s use only while they bring to him the advantage of that\r\ntime-saving. His neighbor is willing to secure him in that advantage by\r\npaying him for the use of the tools all, or nearly all, that he gains by\r\nusing tools over what he would have without them. The borrower will still\r\nbe the gainer by opportunity to do work not possible without the tools.\r\nThe bargain between borrower and lender, like any bargain, is a fair one\r\nonly when both are benefited. The limits of fairness in the deal are\r\nnaturally reached when a clear understanding of all conditions is had in\r\nopen market. Neither borrower nor lender can take advantage of the other\r\nwithout fraud. Neither is under obligation to give to the other without an\r\nequivalent. The whole question rests upon service rendered, as truly as in\r\nany other bargain.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the opposition to interest arises from a\r\nmisconception of the phrase, “borrowed money.” The fact is that borrowing\r\nand lending have to do chiefly with other forms of wealth. Most notes are\r\ngiven for the transfer of all sorts of property under a promise to return\r\nequal value in the future. Money may not enter into the transaction at\r\nall, except as the standard of value is in terms of money. Even when money\r\nis exchanged for a note, the borrower hastens to part with the money for\r\nthe tools or provisions which make him a profitable producer. In payment\r\nof his note he offers money again, simply because it commands every\r\ndesirable form of value for the owner of the wealth. If a farmer wants a\r\nwagon without the present means to buy, he offers the dealer his promise\r\nto pay after six months, when the corn crop just planted shall have\r\nmatured. If the dealer cannot afford to hold the note because he needs the\r\ncapital in his business, that others may be supplied with wagons, either\r\nthe farmer or the dealer carries the note to some one who _can_ afford to\r\nwait for returns, which may be either a banker, whose business provides\r\njust such accommodation, or a neighboring farmer who has just sold his\r\nwool. In either case, the first farmer borrows what he wants in carrying\r\non his business, and at the end of six months, through a similar\r\ntransaction of finding some one ready to take his product, pays his note\r\nwith corn. (See p. 164.)\r\n\r\nInterest is never confined to money transactions, nor even to those in\r\nwhich terms of money are used. All owners of productive wealth gain\r\ninterest in its use as truly as in lending it. The farmer is not a\r\nmoney-lender in general, because his wealth will bring him larger profit\r\nby its use as stock or machinery. Even when he borrows from his neighbors,\r\nit is possible that he secures a larger interest, though he calls it\r\nprofit, than he pays the lender. Interest is often paid in kind. The\r\nlaughable story of borrowing a hen from one neighbor and a sitting of eggs\r\nfrom another, to be returned after a time with advantage, is actually\r\nparalleled by some transactions. A friend of mine having a magnificent\r\npasture agreed with his neighbor, who owned a fine flock of ewes, to\r\npasture that flock for three years, returning at the end of that time just\r\ntwice the number of sheep received. He explained to me that he had made a\r\ngreat bargain, since the wool would pay for the use of the pasture, and he\r\nshould have at the end of the three years a flock about equal to the flock\r\nhe returned. This bargain involved interest at the rate of 33-⅓ per cent,\r\nwithout any terms of money, and an indefinite profit to the owner of the\r\npasture in addition to an average price for such use. This profit is his\r\nreturn for the risk undertaken; since he promised to double the flock\r\nunder any circumstances, and if foot-rot or scab had ruined the flock\r\nunder his management, he would still have the same obligation toward the\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nSuch bargains will always be made so long as both parties are benefited,\r\nfor no possible construction of laws and no diatribes of fanatics can\r\nprevent them. Any calculation as to the enormous growth of wealth by\r\ninterest is more than balanced by a similar calculation of the\r\nmultiplication of wealth by production. If Abraham’s shekels at compound\r\ninterest make an impossible sum of money, Abraham’s flock of sheep with\r\nthe ordinary rate of increase makes an equally impossible worldful.\r\n\r\n_Varying rates of interest._—Interest rates are subject to fluctuation and\r\nvariations under the natural relations of borrowers and lenders very much\r\nas are prices of commodities. Variations, in comparison of different\r\nregions, are due to several causes. In any community where enterprise is\r\ngreat and industrial forces are unusually productive, the interest rates\r\nare high as compared with another community with few competitors in\r\nindustrial enterprise and less productive forces. Thus in countries having\r\nnew land producing large crops with moderate exertion and an increasing\r\npopulation ready to put in such crops, the return for the use of capital\r\nin provisions, stock and machinery is great, and the lender gets high\r\nrates of interest. If, added to this apparent productiveness, there are\r\nrisks of failure from droughts, storms and injurious insects, the bargain\r\nis more favorable to the lender in expressed terms, though it may be less\r\nfavorable in actual results. Thus risk enters practically into\r\ncalculations of interest, whatever the circumstances.\r\n\r\nInterest varies in the same region with a variation of energy and\r\nproductive enterprise or of the speculative spirit undertaking great\r\nimprovements, and on the other hand with any change of circumstances\r\naffecting universal credit. Distrust on the part of anybody reduces the\r\nreadiness with which borrowers find lenders. In times of widespread lack\r\nof confidence, when all credit becomes debt, the borrower is likely to\r\noffer unusual rates of interest. And the few who are willing to lend at\r\nall expect enormous profits in such interest.\r\n\r\nSimilar variations in rates of interest are found between different\r\nclasses of borrowers, due to the variation of risk. Thus promises to pay\r\non demand, with personal security of two good paymasters, will usually be\r\naccepted at very low rates of interest, since the owner of wealth so\r\nloaned feels sure of having the wealth when he wants it. Government loans\r\nin times of peace and prosperity being essentially without risk, approach\r\nvery near the same low rate of interest, since the owner of these\r\nsecurities believes himself at any time able to command the use of his\r\nwealth for any purpose by a transfer of these securities. If for any\r\nreason, official or legislative, public confidence is disturbed, rates of\r\ninterest on such securities rise proportionally through the sale at a\r\ndiscount. Even a law prohibiting such sale would have exactly the contrary\r\neffect to that intended, because of creating additional distrust. Loans\r\nupon time, if secured by productive landed estate not subject to unusual\r\nrisks, can usually be made at moderate rates, and form a fair basis for\r\njudging the normal interest in any region. Loans secured by chattel\r\nmortgage bring higher rates, because the chattels involved are a less\r\ncertain means of payment than landed estate. Loans secured upon\r\nunproductive lands, whether in prospective farms or city lots, are made at\r\nhigh rates, not only because these lands fail to furnish in themselves the\r\nmeans of interest payment, but because they represent the speculative\r\nenergy of their owners with unmeasured risk. All these variations and\r\nfluctuations are found in every community, and grow out of the natural\r\nwants of borrowers and the natural feelings of lenders. Custom may have\r\nsomething to do with rates in special cases, as it has to do with wages\r\nand retail prices, but in the range of frequent dealing between borrowers\r\nand lenders rates follow the higgling of the market as truly as prices of\r\ncommodities.\r\n\r\n_Usury laws._—It has been the custom for ages to distinguish between\r\ninterest and usury, interest being supposed to be a fair payment for use\r\nof borrowed wealth and usury a larger payment in the distress of a\r\nborrower. Usury once meant only use, the equivalent of interest, but since\r\nit was once prohibited by law in England, the name is now attached to what\r\nis still prohibited by law, an interest above a definite rate prescribed\r\nby statute. The object of such legal restrictions is evidently protection\r\nof the borrower against extortion. Yet it is practically proved by\r\nexperience of the world that such restrictions operate against the\r\nborrower by limiting lenders in open market and sometimes closing the\r\nmarket entirely. The would-be borrower, under adverse conditions in the\r\nmarket, is obliged to find in some byway a lender whose scruples against\r\ninfringement upon the law may be overcome by extra payment. Under such\r\ncircumstances there is no market rate, and borrowers bind themselves in\r\nnumerous ways to special payments not in direct conflict with the letter\r\nof the law. Evasions of restrictions under such circumstances are\r\ninevitable. A farmer buys a hundred-dollar horse, giving a note, payable\r\nin one year without interest, for $120; or he sells his note to a neighbor\r\nat what he will give; or he goes to a broker and pays him a commission for\r\nsecuring a loan at the legal rate of interest. Even at a bank, prohibited\r\nby law from taking more than the legal discount on the pain of losing its\r\ncharter, a borrower may give his note for $500, tacitly agreeing to leave\r\non deposit a fifth of the sum, thus paying interest on $500 for the use of\r\n$400.\r\n\r\nAll these forms of evasion are easily adopted with very little possibility\r\nof conviction, even when usury is charged. Even in the most flagrant\r\nviolation of laws the chances of conviction are greatly restricted by the\r\nfact that a prosecuting witness, who, after making a contract in violation\r\nof law, takes advantage of that law to violate his contract, destroys all\r\ncredit for himself, and so comes under the ban of society. The best\r\nmethods of public restriction against extortion of any kind in interest,\r\nin rent or in prices of commodities are those that provide for publicity\r\nof contracts. Where no legal restrictions upon rates of interest are\r\nfixed, current rates are much more likely to be public and widely\r\nadvertised, and extortion is less possible than where the law encourages\r\nsecret contracts by the need of evasion. It is quite possible that society\r\nwill find a way of securing against the extortion of pawn-shops and secret\r\nbrokerage by a public organization competing honestly for the same\r\npatronage. Such companies have been organized in a few cities with success\r\nin meeting the wants of the distressed, under such restrictions of charter\r\nand management as insure fair dealing. It seems as possible to regulate\r\nsuch matters by license and inspection as it is to control the hack-men of\r\na whole city.\r\n\r\n_Loan associations._—It is proper in this connection to refer to loan\r\nassociations, the growth of recent years. The purpose of such associations\r\nis direct coöperation in borrowing and lending among neighbors similarly\r\nsituated as to property. They are especially adapted to assist\r\nwage-earners in securing comfortable homes, for which they can pay\r\ngradually from their earnings. The system, however, has been widely\r\nextended, to the advantage of different classes of property owners, even\r\nto the establishment of coöperative banks among farmers. The essentials to\r\nsuccess and safety in such associations are, first, that they shall be\r\nstrictly local, confined to territory within which mutual acquaintance can\r\ngive a fair basis for genuine credit; second, the objects sought by\r\nindividual borrowers must be fairly equal in risk as well as in ends to be\r\nserved; third, the management must be thoroughly trustworthy, with a\r\ngenuine interest of all shareholders in the selection of officers; fourth,\r\nall shareholders should have similar relations to the association as both\r\nborrowers and lenders, and each shareholder’s responsibility should cease\r\nat the final settlement of his obligation; fifth, provision should be made\r\nfor frequent auditing of accounts, official reports and inspection.\r\n\r\n_Uses of interest._—In closing the subject of interest, it is well to\r\nrecall the fact that interest exists in the very nature of productive\r\nenergies, and that ability to transfer the use of property in any form of\r\ncapital without transferring the interest is most useful to society. It\r\nsustains the aged, who must otherwise be wholly dependent, and the\r\nchildhood of the race in all development of body, mind and soul. Interest\r\nsustains the mass of educational and charitable institutions, as well as\r\nthe individual life of multitudes whose present earnings could not keep\r\nbody and soul together. Moreover, the possibility of paying interest\r\nsecures to the enterprising young men of the world the opportunity to make\r\ntheir highest energies productive. Thus the matter of interest pervades\r\nthe thrift of society as well as the sustenance, and cultivates everywhere\r\nthat present economy which provides for the rainy day. The fact that\r\nnearly one-fifteenth of the population of the United States are depositors\r\nin savings banks alone proves the extent and importance of interest to the\r\ngeneral welfare. With added facilities for depositing small savings in\r\npostal savings banks, the advantage would be still more widely felt, and\r\nthe general economy in the use of both earnings and capital would be\r\npromoted. All this extension of interest-bearing increases the tendency\r\neverywhere noticed to a diminution of current rates. With a multiplication\r\nof capital in any community, the rates of wages increase, while the rates\r\nof interest diminish. Both tendencies are natural effects of the same\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII. Principles Of Land Rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rent values of land._—The general character of rent, as connected with\r\nthe use of fixed capital and so associated with interest, has already been\r\ntouched upon. In that sense it depends upon the fact that possession of\r\nwealth is universally an advantage in production of future wealth and is\r\nsubject to all the peculiarities affecting interest. But land rent, as\r\nrepresented in the value of farms, city lots, mineral claims, fisheries,\r\nwater privileges, wharves, etc., has peculiarities of its own. Its\r\nconnection directly with rural wealth in the value of farm lands makes it\r\nof special importance in this discussion. While rent, as such, is\r\ncomparatively unimportant to farming interests in the United States, where\r\nmost of the land is worked by its owners, the principle is involved as\r\nfully in the transfer value of farms as it is in countries where land is\r\nalmost universally rented for farm purposes, like England and Ireland. It\r\nis simply necessary to remember that the rent question in such a country\r\nas England, where land is seldom transferred from owner to owner (but all\r\nvalues are expressed in the terms of annual rental), is quite different in\r\nform from the question in our country, where transfer of landed property\r\nis free and common, and the rental is regulated largely by current rates\r\nof interest upon land values. In England, too, the rent question involves\r\nlong standing relations between the people and landed proprietors who, for\r\ngeneration after generation, have been rulers of the people as well as\r\nlandlords, and are still the natural magistrates over the renters upon\r\ntheir estates. Yet the principal occasion for rents in such countries is\r\nexactly the same as that for varying values of land in the United States.\r\nPeculiar intricacies of methods of rent-paying and of terms in leases,\r\nvarying with the customs of different countries, have little importance in\r\nthe United States, except for comparisons.\r\n\r\nThe United States afford superior advantages for the study of land values\r\nfairly independent of restrictive laws or customs. The rapid settlement of\r\nwild lands by farmers and the rapid building of cities under free\r\ncompetition give the fairest illustration of tendencies in land values to\r\nbe found in the world. The fact that the government for the past fifty\r\nyears has encouraged the settlement of new land at the bare cost of\r\nestablishing ownership makes the problem almost as simple as if the\r\ngovernment had no voice in the distribution.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to recall the conditions under which any individual has\r\nbeen able to secure the absolute control of land as a proprietor: First,\r\nby preëmption, involving temporary residence until the land is purchased\r\nand patented, at the nominal price of $1.25 an acre, or $2.50 within ten\r\nmiles of such railroads as may have been subsidized by a gift of one-half\r\nthe land within the same limits. Second, by homestead preëmption, by which\r\nany head of a family, present or prospective, can secure 160 acres of land\r\nby payment of certain registration fees, amounting in all to less than $20\r\nupon the average, and making his residence upon the land for a period of\r\nfive years. The issue of a patent at the end of the five years establishes\r\nownership. The soldier’s homestead, offered to those who had served as\r\nvolunteers in the army of the nation, varied from this only in a reduced\r\nterm of residence. Third, homesteaders, as well as others, could secure\r\nadditional lands under a provision for tree culture on the treeless\r\nprairies, the requirement being the planting of a few acres of trees and\r\nthe maintenance of culture on those acres for a period of eight years.\r\nEven the establishment of trees in permanent growth was not a requisite.\r\nFourth, by certain outlay for irrigation purposes in arid lands a tract of\r\n640 acres could be secured. In addition to these, certain land grants to\r\nthe several states led to the issue of scrip, entitling the possessor to\r\nlocate on government lands upon payment of only fees of registration.\r\nCertain states, within whose borders public lands did not exist, being\r\nunable to hold lands in other states or territories, sold scrip at less\r\nthan half the price asked by the government for lands.\r\n\r\nAll these methods operated not only as a stimulant to the settlement of\r\nnew territory, but as a check upon rising values of land in the older\r\ncommunities. Nevertheless, this rapid development has given the best of\r\nopportunities for watching the tendencies of land values.\r\n\r\n_Propriety of land rent._—The right of property in land, like every other\r\nproperty right, rests upon its advantage in the welfare of communities.\r\nAmong savage tribes individual control of plots of ground would interfere\r\nwith welfare, as hindering the only use to which the land is put in\r\nhunting. Among people living by herding no nice dividing lines are needed,\r\nthough strife between herdsmen, since the days of Abraham and Lot, results\r\nfrom the mingling of herds upon the same feeding grounds. With the actual\r\ntillage of soil, control of the space tilled becomes absolutely necessary,\r\nand more necessary with every improvement in agriculture which takes the\r\nnature of permanent improvement upon the soil. No agriculture beyond the\r\nmerest skinning of the surface has ever existed without permanent\r\noccupation. Even where the land is distinctly owned, but used under\r\ntemporary leases, few permanent improvements in agriculture are possible.\r\n\r\nThe necessary permanence of control over the products of toil makes an\r\nessentially permanent control of land necessary to the common welfare. For\r\nthis reason the progress of civilization everywhere demands more distinct\r\nboundaries of landed property, and this in the interest of the whole\r\ncommunity, which shares in the progress. The more intensive and far-seeing\r\nthe methods of farming become, the greater the necessity for fixed\r\nboundaries. This necessity is recognized in all provisions for exact\r\nsurveys, complete records of transfers in ownership; and finally for\r\ngovernment guaranty of title. Such ownership underlies all prudential\r\nconsumption of wealth for future returns. The loss to communities from\r\nwant of it is seen in the waste of game in unappropriated countries and\r\nthe destruction of the seals in the seal fisheries. Yet this ownership is\r\nstill subject under all circumstances to the law of welfare for the entire\r\ncommunity. The community’s right of eminent domain has always been\r\nrecognized in the need of public highways and other public improvements,\r\nand is likely to be still further recognized with any new necessity, like\r\nthe control of injurious insects or quarantine against disease. Yet none\r\nof these restrictions diminish the necessity of ownership, in the sense of\r\nindividual control for all purposes of agriculture, manufactures, commerce\r\nand social relations. This individual control is intimately connected with\r\nour ideas of rent, and would be still, though all the lands were managed\r\nunder one proprietorship, and that a public one. Rent would accrue and be\r\npaid, though the whole people held title to the land.\r\n\r\n_The sources of land values._—The value of land, like every other value,\r\nis the result of comparisons. Whatever advantage is given to a producer by\r\nhis possession of land is likely to form his estimate of its value. In the\r\ncomparison of two farms of equal dimensions every difference in fertility,\r\nlocation as to drainage, exposure, or convenience to market or social\r\nadvantages, adaptability to improved methods in agriculture and\r\nconvenience of arrangement, will enter into the estimate of worth. If one\r\nof the farms can be had for the asking, the other will be worth just what\r\nits advantages will add to the power of the owner in the production of\r\nwealth, provided both are considered alike as simply machines for\r\nproducing food. Usually, however, economy in the consumption of wealth is\r\nconsidered also. In a new country lands most easily accessible and readily\r\ntillable are chosen first. With added demand for food, less accessible or\r\nless easily tillable lands are occupied. At once the more accessible have\r\na value equal to the greater ease with which the same product can be\r\noffered in market. If the difference were only a mile of hauling all\r\nproduce and all commodities for which produce is exchanged, that cost of\r\ntransportation would make the value of the nearest land. If the difference\r\nis simply in yield for a given amount of labor, the land which yields\r\nthirty bushels of wheat to the acre, when land which yields twenty bushels\r\ncan be had for the taking, will be worth ten bushels of wheat a year, and\r\nits value will be estimated in dollars at a sum which securely at interest\r\nwill bring a similar return. If, by and by, the demand for food or\r\nimprovement in transportation or an easier method makes it worth while to\r\ncultivate land yielding only ten bushels of wheat to the acre, the annual\r\nvalue of land yielding twenty bushels will be ten bushels, and that of the\r\nland yielding thirty bushels will have become twenty bushels.\r\n\r\nThus the rent, and correspondingly the value of farms, increases with the\r\nincreasing demand for farm products, whether that demand results from the\r\nincreased number of eaters at hand, from the increased ability of these\r\neaters to supply their wants, or from ready transportation to eaters\r\nelsewhere. Many influences in various directions affect the tendency to an\r\nincrease of land values with the increase of population. Some have been\r\nled to the assumption that only the multiplication of food-eaters,\r\nincreasing the need for land, makes rent possible. Connecting it with the\r\ntheory of Malthus that population tends to increase in geometrical ratio,\r\nwhile food can increase only in arithmetical ratio, they have denounced\r\nrent as a price paid to monopolists under stress of danger from\r\nstarvation. These forget that rent is payable as truly out of increasing\r\nabilities of individuals to meet increasing wants as under the spur of\r\nmore distressing wants. Indeed, starvation, or the approach to it, never\r\npays rent, however strong an incentive it may be to promise rent.\r\n\r\n_Rent in price of products._—Does the value of the land upon which my\r\nwheat is raised enter into the price of my wheat? If all land values were\r\ndestroyed, would the wheat of the world be cheaper, because its cost would\r\nbe diminished? The price at any time is just enough to bring the supply to\r\nmarket and keep it there. A portion of the supply has cost even more than\r\nit brings to its owner. If any brings more than cost, the difference goes\r\neither to the energetic raiser using improved methods, or to the fortunate\r\nreceiver of timely showers, or to the possessor of the fruitful field.\r\nNeither the profit of the raiser, through his method and the shower, nor\r\nthe rent of the fertile field has made a bushel of wheat less or more\r\nvaluable in market. The value of the wheat in the market makes both the\r\nprofit and the rent. If the value of wheat falls, the value of best wheat\r\nlands sometimes follows; but land values do not directly affect prices of\r\nproducts, though they may be directly dependent upon those prices.\r\n\r\nIndirectly, however, the value of land may affect prices of products.\r\nLand, in certain speculative movements of society, gains a value for\r\nfuture use. If the fertile fields are held for speculative purposes, less\r\nfertile fields must furnish a limited supply at increased price. If the\r\nfields are wanted for homes, the supply must come from a distance at\r\ngreater cost, or be raised on fewer acres by more costly tillage, and will\r\nnot come till the price is increased. Thus high rents, or land values, if\r\nmaintained by outward forces may diminish the total product, and so affect\r\nprices. But no conspiracy of land holders can affect the price of their\r\nproducts so long as their lands are employed in supplying the market.\r\n\r\n_Variation in land values._—Rents vary in different countries under\r\nvarious customs of those countries, and so land values can be compared\r\nonly by knowing the customs and laws which influence the transfer of\r\nlanded property, either by deed or by lease. Differences in value are\r\noften due to considerations entirely distinct from production. Farms are\r\nhomes as well as machines; and the privileges of home life, with all the\r\nrelations of family, friendship and patriotic associations, may rouse\r\ncompetition that greatly influences the market value of farms. In any\r\ncommunity, whatever custom or law hinders competition in farming affects\r\nthe relative value of farms in productive industry. Peculiarities in the\r\nmethod of holding lands have much to do with their value. The hopes and\r\nexpectations of the people have large influence. Whatever stimulates\r\nenterprise and increases speculative energy enlarges the estimate of land\r\nvalue. Whatever depreciates abilities or discourages enterprise diminishes\r\nland value. Whatever encourages permanent improvements and far-sighted\r\nplans in farming increases land prices. Whatever discourages the spirit of\r\nimprovement reduces such prices.\r\n\r\nIn some of these ways it is possible to account for great differences of\r\nvalue in regions apparently equal in natural advantages. Thus nobody wants\r\nlands in Turkey, however fertile, in comparison with lands in a free\r\ncountry like ours. Countries under a poor system of agriculture with\r\ninefficient labor cannot maintain high value of land. Ignorance and\r\nthriftlessness in a community of laborers operates in the same way. Thus\r\nthe habits of the people, as well as their laws, enter into the question\r\nof rent. In countries where large estates are parceled out to renters,\r\ngeneration after generation, the customary terms of leases as to time,\r\nmethod of payment, adjustment of improvements, restrictions as to methods\r\nof tillage, and requirement of capital, enter largely into the question of\r\nrents. In some the fear of eviction under arrearages cuts a prominent\r\nfigure; in others the confiscation of improvements destroys all\r\nenterprise. Upon the continent of Europe, in some places, the payment of\r\nrent in produce,—what we call working of land upon shares,—greatly limits\r\nindividual enterprise, though it gives to the land owner a direct control\r\nin the methods employed on the land. Restrictions of law or of custom upon\r\ntransfer of ownership always have the effect of diminishing the general\r\nproductiveness by hindering the natural competition of productive\r\nenterprise. The result of all laws of entail, by which enormous estates\r\nare held from generation to generation under control of the same family,\r\nis universally deprecated because of its interference with the natural law\r\nof supply and demand as to farms and homes. All such restrictions favor\r\nthe spirit of monopoly and cultivate arbitrary power, which in every way\r\nhinders progress.\r\n\r\n_Recent decrease of land values._—In the United States during recent years\r\nthere has been a decided shrinkage of land values in most of the country.\r\nSeveral evident causes appear worthy of mention. The most evident is a\r\nrapid increase of farms on the western plains, recently bringing their\r\nproducts into the competition. These prairie regions give the largest\r\nrange for farming in the world. In the same connection is the\r\nintroduction, upon these immense fields of cheap land, of extensive\r\nmachinery by which the productive power of labor is multiplied. The labor\r\nof one man for 300 days is said to have produced in California 5,000\r\nbushels of wheat, so that one man’s labor on many acres gives to each of\r\n1,000 people a barrel of flour a year. Next to this is the opening of new\r\nagricultural enterprises in South America, Australia, India and South\r\nAfrica, with still greater prospects in Siberia—all the result of great\r\nimprovements in transportation, opening to these regions the world’s great\r\nmarkets. This has pushed the supply of staple products toward the\r\ncondition of over-production. The same cause has diminished the demand for\r\nour staples by greatly stimulating the consumption of foreign fruits and\r\nnuts. Most recently has come the depression from loss of confidence in\r\nenterprise, through excessive speculation and waste of capital,\r\nundermining the market for land as well as for all the machinery of\r\nproduction. In these conditions the whole world has shared.\r\n\r\n_Population drifting to cities._—The drift of farm population toward the\r\ncities is a symptom of the changed conditions, not a cause. If, as decided\r\nby an expert investigator, three men on a farm do the work that fourteen\r\ndid forty years ago, the farms can well spare to the cities an increasing\r\nnumber of its boys and girls. The drift is real and permanent, diminishing\r\nrural population in 100 years from 96 per cent of the whole to 70 per\r\ncent, though exaggerated in figures through arbitrary division between\r\ntowns and cities. This movement has been noticed the world over since\r\n1848, when machinery began to affect agricultural production.\r\n\r\nThat this drift is wholesome is evident, if we look at the diversity of\r\nemployment resulting and the improved welfare of all. A simple comparison\r\nof figures from the United States census will show the readjustment of\r\nemployment. No one can doubt the advantage gained in the entire nation.\r\n\r\n_Abandoned farms._—The most disturbing feature of this readjustment is the\r\ndesertion of some farms in the rougher parts of New England and the drier\r\nparts of the West. These lands will find a profitable use in the woodlots\r\nthrough the East, and in grazing ranges through the West, with slight\r\npermanent loss. They are not signs of poverty, but of a developing thrift,\r\njust as the abandoned country woolen mills tell the story of immense\r\ngrowth in the factory methods. While individuals seeking profit in sale or\r\nrent of their farms may suffer in any such shrinkage of local values, it\r\nmust not be forgotten that the total of rural welfare is not necessarily\r\ndiminished. Land values, aside from improvements, are everywhere evidence\r\nof limitations to welfare in some special direction. If human enterprise\r\nand invention and thrift lessen such limitations, the world is better off.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of farmers, who think more of their homes than of property,\r\nwill suffer little from lower prices of land unless such low prices result\r\nfrom a general lack of thrift and of adaptation to new circumstances.\r\nWhile the changes in price which affect reduction of rent values do\r\nrequire readjustment of plans and methods, the farmer who keeps in touch\r\nwith the world’s work will not suffer, but gain, in the general\r\nadvancement. In many instances, the low condition of farm property is due\r\nto unthrifty neglect of farmers in whole neighborhoods. Bad roads, short\r\nschools, weak fences and poor stock are as often a cause as an effect of\r\nlow prices of land. Whole regions in our country suffer in this way from\r\nunthrift, whatever the price of farm products or of lands.\r\n\r\n_Farms in the United States._—These are under conditions best suited to\r\nattend the general thrift of the world in every way. Ownership is not\r\ncomplicated in any way with magisterial duties or prestige or entailment,\r\nas in England. It is not so distinctly hereditary as to embarrass\r\nagriculture by extreme subdivision of farms, as in France and other\r\nportions of Europe. It is in no danger of combination into great estates\r\nunder absentee landlords, as in Ireland. Its laws of transfer and guaranty\r\nare growing more and more simple and direct, while protection to homestead\r\nrights is strong. Farmers themselves have such responsibility in state and\r\nnation as to make their genuine interests felt everywhere, and no system\r\nof caste can make them a peasantry, as in most of the Old World. Indeed,\r\nthe farmer in every region makes his farm; and the enterprising, educated\r\nfarmer of the next generation in our country will find in himself the\r\nforces at work to give value to his land. The speculative movement in land\r\nholding will be outgrown when genuine farm homes are more prized for their\r\nwelfare than for their wealth; but this very welfare will maintain a\r\nstable value in lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III. CONSUMPTION OF WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII. Wealth Used By Individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wealth to be consumed for welfare._—The only economic motive for the\r\naccumulation of wealth is its use in promotion of welfare. While the old\r\nmaxim says, “A penny saved is worth two gained,” every one recognizes the\r\npenny as absolutely worthless except in view of some utility to be gained\r\nin spending it. So with every form of wealth. All economic value\r\ndisappears when the thought of use is wanting. Such use, whether\r\npractically instantaneous, like the destruction of the gunpowder\r\nprojecting the bullet, or extended through hundreds of years, as in the\r\nwearing out of a castle, or a bridge, is properly called consumption of\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nA majority of the great problems concerning social welfare are connected\r\nwith the use of wealth, and therefore fall under the discussion of\r\nconsumption. Indeed, so long as there is little accumulated wealth, as in\r\nthe savage state, social problems have little significance. The statement\r\nof the Apostle Paul, “The love of money is the root of all evil,” while\r\nnot confined in application to wealth already accumulated, has its most\r\nimportant bearing in the fact that wealth accumulated is itself a power to\r\nbe used or abused by whoever controls it. The saying of Emerson, “The best\r\npolitical economy is care and culture of men,” applies most strictly to\r\nthe uses of wealth and the methods of its consumption. The great question\r\nof today in every civilized land is, How can the accumulations of power in\r\nthe shape of wealth made by this generation be used to establish a\r\ncontinuous welfare, not only for this generation, but for its successors?\r\nThe wants of society today include not only a reasonable provision for\r\nlife and health and wisdom and virtue during the life of those who are now\r\nactive, but an equal provision for the same wants increased with each\r\nsucceeding generation. In all thought of consuming wealth, we must\r\nremember that power in this form is rightly used only when power in some\r\nother form results. Thus wealth is consumed, according to natural laws,\r\neither for reproducing itself in more advantageous form or for sustaining\r\nhuman power in form of health or wisdom or virtue.\r\n\r\nWe have social welfare as the result of wealth consumed, or used up.\r\nSociety is interested in all the wealth accumulated, and the methods of\r\nits accumulation and its fair distribution are a part of social machinery;\r\nyet these have their chief significance in the final consumption. It is\r\nnot what we have, but what we do with it, that makes society interested in\r\nour possessions. It is not what society has, but how it uses it, that\r\nsettles the chief questions of welfare or illfare. Not only gunpowder, but\r\nevery conceivable power in material wealth, has blessing or bane in the\r\nuse to which it is put. So the welfare of a community cannot be judged by\r\nthe amount and kind of wealth produced or by the methods in production or\r\nby the distribution of ownership. These may be significant in showing the\r\ntrend of social customs as to individual control, but the last inquiry\r\nwill still have to be, What welfare comes to the entire community when all\r\nthis wealth is used? Moreover, no analysis of qualities in any substance\r\ncalled wealth can measure the welfare involved in its use. Its relation to\r\nthe individual using it and his relation to the whole community, with a\r\ncareful analysis of wants met and character developed, must be considered.\r\nThe final question is, How many and what kind of wants are satisfied?\r\n\r\n_Use of wealth individual._—It is necessary to realize that the social\r\norganization is maintained solely for the sake of individuals. All study\r\nof welfare and illfare is a study of individual human beings. The mutual\r\nrelations of these human beings in society are means to individual life,\r\ngrowth and enjoyment. Even the total power of a generation in society is\r\ndependent upon how the individual wants of individual members of that\r\nsociety are met. Some of the greatest mistakes in estimating social\r\nwelfare arise from overlooking the essential individuality of wants, upon\r\nwhich all wealth depends for its use.\r\n\r\nThis individuality makes the proper consumption of wealth largely a\r\nquestion of right and wrong. The possessor of any form of wealth is\r\nobliged to recognize his place in society as a promoter of welfare, and\r\nsociety compels, as far as it is able, a recognition of individual needs.\r\nYet the very nature of consumption, as concerned with individual wants,\r\nmakes individual judgment supreme in the use of wealth. It is my ideal of\r\ngood health, high culture and sound morals that must be met for my\r\nenjoyment. My welfare, so long as I have rational powers, is the meeting\r\nof my ideal. Society rightly hesitates to interfere with my ideals by\r\nforce as long as my actions do not disturb the welfare of my neighbors.\r\nThe necessity of human liberty for actual welfare limits the control of\r\nsociety to very evident infringements upon others’ welfare in every\r\nactivity, including the use of wealth as well as other powers. This very\r\nrestriction is in the interest of highest total enjoyment of welfare in\r\nthe whole community.\r\n\r\n_Individual responsibility for use of wealth._—In estimating the proper\r\nuses of wealth, it is necessary to remember that mere animal existence is\r\na very small part of human welfare. It would not be enough for any human\r\nsociety that every individual in it be fed, clothed, warmed and maintained\r\nin reasonably long life. The highest uniformity of mere animal enjoyment\r\nwould not make a society worthy to be called human. Even uniformity of\r\nwants far higher, with uniform supply for those wants, would give but\r\nlittle organization and but little total welfare if that uniformity was\r\nbrought by curtailment of natural powers or by constraint that hinders\r\ngrowth. The most natural fact among human beings, as in all the rest of\r\nnature, is variety; and every conception of proper consumption of wealth\r\nmust involve this thought of variety of individuals in wants and powers\r\nleft free to grow. It is a purely false assumption that the ideal\r\ncommunity toward which all ought to strive is a community of equals in\r\neither ability or capacity. That is the ideal community which gives to\r\nevery member of it opportunity to make most of himself; that is, to make\r\nhimself most useful, and able to enjoy the truest use of his powers.\r\n\r\nHence we find the tendency in every community, with reference to wealth as\r\nto other individual forces, to recognize early and complete personal\r\nresponsibility. This personal responsibility makes the question of\r\nconsumption of wealth a question of morals as well as of wisdom. The whole\r\ndiscussion here turns upon the wisdom or unwisdom of certain personal uses\r\nor social uses of what the world has accumulated. We can ask what use of\r\nwealth is prudent, what imprudent; then what social organization best\r\ndevelops the wisdom which secures a prudent use of wealth; and finally,\r\nhow far and in what ways society can act as a unit in the place of\r\nindividuals. The machinery of government then becomes a part of every\r\nperson’s welfare, and his relation to its maintenance by contribution of\r\nhis wealth is a part of prudent consumption. The economic question in\r\nconsumption, then, involves not so much what one can get from society as\r\nwhat he can give to society, since his welfare comes largely through\r\norganization in the use of accumulated wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV. Prudent Consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prudent uses of wealth._—It has already been suggested that a proper use\r\nof wealth looks always beyond the present. We accumulate, not only to\r\nspend, but to spend in such a way as will give larger abilities in the\r\nfuture. The name prudential consumption has been given to all that use of\r\nwealth which has for its end the maintenance of individual powers at\r\nhighest efficiency for the longest life and provision for a more efficient\r\nposterity with more efficient instruments of production.\r\n\r\nIt is prudential use of wealth to gather into the farm, not only such\r\nmachinery in the shape of buildings, fences and roadways as will make the\r\nfuture labor more effective, but all possible fertility that will make the\r\nfuture owners of the farm a larger welfare in possession. All wealth put\r\ninto the form of productive capital is prudentially consumed. All\r\nso-called permanent improvements which look to the better satisfaction of\r\nfuture wants fulfil the condition of prudent foresight. All public\r\nimprovements are really such, when this far-seeing provision for future\r\nwants and abilities of society is made. Such methods are the genuine\r\neconomic saving in which the community should be encouraged. A saving\r\nwhich merely stores against a future personal want contributes less to\r\ngeneral welfare, and does not stimulate the natural growth of wants in the\r\nindividual, which is the chief source of increasing power. The one who\r\nsaves that he may have better tools with which to do more for his future\r\nsatisfaction, not only adds to his physical abilities to meet his daily\r\nwants, but adds the strongest stimulant to energy in his work. The supply\r\nof ordinary wants being provided for, new wants arise.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of prudential consumption such wants are encouraged as give\r\ngreater and greater abilities. Thus the ideal of life is constantly\r\nraised, and the struggle is not for existence but for higher enjoyment and\r\nmore genuine welfare. The wealth which comes in this accumulation of\r\ncapital for larger accomplishment aids true philanthropy. The whole world\r\ngets more of welfare with every addition made by farmers to their working\r\ncapital. In the same way all increase of capital in machinery, tools,\r\nwarehouses, ships and other means of transport contribute to a\r\nphilanthropy that makes society richer.\r\n\r\nSuch saving is entirely opposed to the miserly spirit which hides wealth\r\nbecause of mere love of possession or fear of future want. It is the true\r\nway of both spending and having, since it expends earnings for that which\r\ncontinues to aid in bringing larger returns to meet increasing want. That\r\nsocial system is most prudent for the world which accumulates productive\r\ncapital without reducing any part of society to poverty. Prudence,\r\nhowever, requires that this capital saving be adjusted to the abilities of\r\nthe community in which it is to be used. The building of an enormous\r\nfactory, where skill has yet to be developed and where a market is\r\nwanting, would be the height of imprudence. Such waste is sometimes seen\r\nunder the false stimulant of a bounty or a restrictive tariff. Just so,\r\ngreat public improvements upon rivers, harbors and highways are a part of\r\neconomy and prudent investment of wealth only when a community is able to\r\nuse them to advantage. The test of prudence in capital saving is in its\r\nnice adjustment to the abilities of the users.\r\n\r\n_Prudent adjustment of capital._—A still further adjustment is required by\r\nprudence between the capital put into fixed forms and the circulating\r\ncapital needed for best use of the more lasting machinery. A farmer is\r\nsaid to be stock poor when he overloads his farm or crowds his farm\r\nbuildings with growing stock. Having all his capital in stock, he is\r\nunable to handle it to advantage, and must readjust his capital in live\r\nstock to his capital in the farm and machinery by selling some of his\r\nstock and adding to the value of his farm. On the other hand, many a\r\nfarmer is land poor, where the bulk of his capital is invested in land,\r\nwhile he cannot command circulating capital in stock and wages sufficient\r\nto make the land useful. He needs, in the spirit of prudence, to sell some\r\nof his land for the sake of current funds to invest in live stock and in\r\nlabor. The same principle applies to all investments of capital. A\r\nrailroad may so exhaust the funds of the community in building it that it\r\ncannot be fairly manned for work. Sometimes a whole nation invests so\r\nlargely in permanent forms of capital as to bring distress and poverty\r\nfrom want of means to use the great machine.\r\n\r\nPrudence also requires a further adjustment between the amount of labor\r\ndirectly producing wealth and that employed in what may be called the arts\r\nof consumption, contributing directly to personal comfort and enjoyment.\r\nThe neatness of a farmer’s yard, outbuildings, fences and machinery is a\r\npart of his welfare. It also indicates a certain thrift, which enhances\r\nthe value of the farm. But it is a proper sign of such thrift when it\r\ngrows naturally out of the productive energy employed upon the crops and\r\nthe stock. The wealth used in maintaining this neatness is not wasted, but\r\nit will not reproduce itself. It must be supplied from other sources in\r\ndirect production. All services in the household, in contributing to\r\nbodily comfort of the family, make an essential part of human welfare, but\r\nprudence requires such an adjustment of these services to the total\r\nwealth-producing energy that they may be maintained without reducing the\r\ntotal power. All public expenditures in the care of streets and parks are\r\nan essential to welfare so long as the sources of wealth production are\r\nkept the more active from such advantages. The test of prudence in all\r\nsuch adjustment is the increase of power in wealth-production, along with\r\nincreasing welfare.\r\n\r\n_Provision for future wants._—True prudence is largely foresight, and so\r\nis the enterprise of speculative energy which provides any product for a\r\nfuture market. No more careful adjustment is necessary than that which\r\nsecures such a product of farm or factory as the world will need when it\r\nreaches its actual market. The greatest wisdom is needed in studying the\r\nconditions of a community with reference to its future wants, and the\r\nsupply actually accumulating for meeting those wants.\r\n\r\nFarmers need, as truly as any producers, to know the wants of the world\r\nfor which they are producing food. The crops they plant in the spring will\r\nactually be consumed in large measure during the following year. Prudence\r\nsuggests that they plant such crops as will be most in demand. If they\r\njudge by the market today, they are in danger of two errors: first, of\r\noverestimating the future demand, which may be satisfied before the new\r\ncrop comes; second, of diverting from ordinary staple crops too large a\r\nportion of the crop-raising force. Common experience has taught that a\r\nhigh price of hops or onions or broom corn has almost certainly wrought a\r\nreduction of the price for succeeding crops below the normal cost. Still\r\nlarger foresight is needed with reference to the raising of live stock,\r\nwhich requires more than a single season’s investment of capital. To stock\r\na farm with hogs, sheep, cattle or horses, requires from one to five years\r\nof accumulated capital. The record of farm stock shows successive waves of\r\nsuch production in direct opposition to prudence. (Chart No. 4, p. 83.)\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing world has similar experiences of imprudent consumption\r\nin the effort to forestall a market. But the record of failures in this\r\nrespect is scarcely as marked, because of more business-like collection of\r\ninformation for the guidance of judgment. Farmers too generally follow the\r\nlead of their neighbors in adjustment of crops or stock. Manufacturers\r\nmore generally try to do what their rivals are not doing. Success in\r\nproducing what is not finally wanted we call overproduction. While the\r\nwhole world is warned against this, each individual producer fails to\r\nstudy as well as he might the means of avoiding it.\r\n\r\nPrudential consumption does not properly provide for those speculative\r\ndealings which end simply in a readjustment of wealth by gains on the one\r\nside through losses on the other. All these imply an actual waste of\r\nwealth and energy, whether they are exhibited in a gambling machine or a\r\nboard of trade. But there are certain great enterprises, like wonderful\r\ninventions, which involve a prudential consumption of wealth. The wealth\r\nconsumed in developing the electric telegraph system, or in laying the\r\nAtlantic cable, everyone would judge to be well invested. Every thought of\r\nprudence sustains such expenditure. Yet the spirit of invention, as a mere\r\nventure in desire to hit upon something which may chance to be wanted,\r\nshows lack of prudence, and the world suffers by great waste of energy in\r\nthis direction. The only test of prudential consumption in provision for\r\nthe future market is in the careful study of all conditions, favorable and\r\nunfavorable.\r\n\r\n_Consumption for growth._—True prudence in public improvements has just\r\nbeen mentioned, but such prudence has a larger range in promoting the\r\npermanent growth of human powers and capacities. Every wise father wishes\r\nhis children to know more, be more efficient in the arts of life, and\r\nenjoy more of true welfare than he does. Communities which show no\r\nadvancement in these respects are called dead, and decay is sure to\r\nfollow. Prudence looks after all educational interests by expending wealth\r\nupon the means of education; not only sustaining schools, but making more\r\npermanent provision and increasing facilities for instruction. This is not\r\nonly a means of preserving and wisely using the wealth accumulated, but a\r\nmeans of increased production. Such prudence suggests large endowments for\r\npublic education, including the support of government machinery for\r\nuniformity of education. A similar prudence sustains the philanthropic\r\nspirit which maintains all the means of philanthropy. The endowment of\r\nasylums for the weak and afflicted and the support of religious\r\ninstitutions are prudent ways not only of caring for present welfare, but\r\nof increasing the welfare of the future. The next generation will be\r\nstronger and happier for the prudent foresight of this generation in\r\novercoming obstacles to health and wisdom and virtue. To leave wealth thus\r\ninvested is far better for successors than to leave it in form for ready\r\nconsumption upon temporary wants. Thus all prudent consumption of wealth\r\nhas for its basis the genuine welfare of a continuous society of human\r\nbeings subject to improvement. Any forming community looks surely to\r\nfuture welfare when it invests wealth in good homes, good schools and good\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV. Imprudent Consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Society interested in imprudence._—This fact, that the wealth of each\r\ngeneration is so largely dependent upon the prudence of the preceding,\r\nemphasizes the importance of public sentiment in favor of prudential\r\nconsumption. Public criticism naturally attacks the most noticeable\r\nfailures of prudence, and it therefore seems worth while to consider some\r\nof those imprudent forms of consumption which society may seek to prevent.\r\nIt is also proper to consider the ways in which society may act for\r\nprevention of imprudence.\r\n\r\n_Luxurious consumption._—The question of luxury in the same society with\r\nextreme poverty is always prominent. Luxury is supposed to be extravagant\r\nexpenditure in meeting individual wants. Though such wants may be real and\r\nlegitimate, lavish expenditure by any portion of a community seems at\r\nfirst sight a trespass upon common welfare. Some have considered that\r\nperson wanting in good will to his fellows who expends upon his own\r\ncomfort more than his neighbors can afford. Others define luxury to be\r\nexpenditure for living above the average expenditure in the whole\r\ncommunity. Still others regard any expenditure a luxury which is not\r\nneeded to maintain physical powers.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that all these efforts at definition are imperfect,\r\nbecause the idea of luxury implies such a mode of life as does not\r\ncontribute to the total welfare, and each one’s idea of total welfare\r\nenters into his definition of luxury. It is an evident fact that the\r\nso-called luxuries of one generation become the actual necessities of the\r\nnext. This is because the life of the race means more and includes more\r\nwith each succeeding generation. To live in the twentieth century will\r\nmean, as it has always meant in the past, to have such exercise of every\r\nability as circumstances permit. Luxury is therefore always relative to\r\nthe duties one has to perform, as well as to the society in which one\r\nmoves. Moreover, luxury is relative to individual abilities and individual\r\nplans. It would be luxury for a farmer to go without a needed plow for the\r\nsake of buying a lawn mower. It would be luxury for a student to own two\r\ncoats, if he must go without a dictionary to buy the second.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to settle the luxuries of others, but less easy to so define\r\nluxury that the public can agree in the definition. In general, it is\r\ndescribed to be a meeting of fanciful rather than real wants. Any\r\nindividual in society is spending his wealth in luxury if he allows his\r\nimagination to conjure up adornments of person or household which\r\ncontribute chiefly to display rather than to comfort or enlightenment. All\r\nsuch adornments of person, or home, or the public streets, as cultivate\r\ngenuine taste and inspire to more of energy contribute to the general\r\nwelfare far more than mere expenditure for food can do. Yet in times of\r\nstarvation the food must come first. The world sometimes sneers at the\r\ndesire among very poor people to cultivate flowers and maintain a canary\r\nor other pets; yet every philanthropist knows that these desires are among\r\nthe strongest incentives to greater thrift and keener exertion.\r\n\r\n_Legal restrictions upon luxury._—With all this difficulty in definition\r\nand the certainty of change from age to age, there is nevertheless a\r\ndisposition on the part of society to restrict actual luxury. Again and\r\nagain this has led to enactment of laws prohibiting expenditure in certain\r\ndefinite forms. The dress of ladies of rank has been restricted as to\r\nstyle and quantity of material and ways of making. The variety upon a\r\ndinner table has been limited to a certain number of dishes and certain\r\nkinds of food.\r\n\r\nAll of these have been egregious failures, from the impossibility of\r\nmeasuring results upon the general progress of civilization. The indirect\r\neffects of ingenuity in dress and cooking have been on the whole so\r\nbeneficial that the world cannot afford to hinder it. The intricacies of\r\nFrench cooking seem to an ordinary household extreme luxury, yet that very\r\ningenuity has cheapened the cost of living, to a large portion of the\r\nworld, by rendering palatable the coarser vegetables and cheaper meats\r\nwhich lie within the reach of the poor.\r\n\r\nNo real student of human nature would now attempt, unless it be in the\r\nemergency of a great famine, to restrict expenditures by law upon the plea\r\nof luxury. Still, society as a whole has some voice in directing the\r\njudgment of individuals. Public opinion is an effective check upon\r\ndesires. The good will of the multitude is more important to the mass of\r\nmen than any particular gratification. It is proper, therefore, to discuss\r\nat any time and at all times the limits of luxury, both for ourselves and\r\nfor our neighbors. The sole cure for imprudent expenditure in luxuries is\r\nindividual culture of mind and heart and conscience, so that each may do\r\nhis best to secure, not only the good will of his neighbors, but their\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n_Wasteful consumption._—Wasteful expenditure through ignorance or\r\nrecklessness is more common and more weakening than luxury. Its limits\r\ncannot be described, since it covers expenditures of every kind, from the\r\nsimplest provision for food and clothing to the most elaborate structures\r\nand wildest schemes of development. Though noticeable wastes are seen in\r\nthe households of the rich, they are relatively larger among the poor.\r\n\r\nYet any attempt to regulate such waste by law is futile, chiefly from the\r\nfact that it ignores the personal responsibility and wants which make\r\nindividual character. It is properly applied to the imbecile and the\r\ninsane, as well as to children and youth, through the appointment of a\r\nprudent guardian. Society can protect itself only by fostering more\r\ncomplete systems of education in the arts of life. The tendency of our\r\ntimes toward a more technical education, especially in reference to the\r\nhome and the common industries of life, marks the growth of public opinion\r\ntoward a clearer ideal of prudence against waste. The study of economic\r\nprinciples in every department of life, and especially the clear\r\nunderstanding of everyday facts as to the things men handle and use,\r\ncannot but give wisdom for preventing waste.\r\n\r\n_Vicious consumption._—It is customary to distinguish from all other forms\r\nof imprudent consumption of wealth such vicious indulgence of appetites as\r\nnot only consumes accumulated wealth but diminishes power in production.\r\nSuch vicious indulgence is the result of cultivating unnatural and\r\ndestructive appetites. Familiar illustrations are those connected with the\r\ndrink habit, the opium habit, or any other vice whose chief effect is seen\r\nupon the individual life of the one indulging himself. These involve the\r\nvery highest wastefulness, because they destroy not only wealth, but\r\nability. Nobody can begin to compute in terms of money the actual waste of\r\nour country through indulgence in strong drink. The value of liquors\r\nconsumed is no measure of the entire wastefulness. Yet this is more than\r\nenough to furnish all with bread.\r\n\r\nThe wrongfulness of such indulgence, from its harm to society through\r\nreducing the power of the race, is seldom disputed. Yet the right of\r\nsociety to restrict the individual indulgence is quite generally disputed.\r\nThe larger need of freedom in the exercise of judgment among mature\r\nmembers of a community outweighs the need of preventing even vice. Society\r\ndoes well to bring the restraints of law upon the immature, whose judgment\r\nis not yet formed, thus supplementing by law the directive energy of\r\nparental control. It may yet go further, and prohibit such indulgence to\r\nall who have lost the power of self-control. But in general it has been\r\nfound impossible to enforce restriction upon vicious indulgence except\r\nwhere such acts occasion direct suffering upon others, or help to maintain\r\nan immoral business. The right of restraint and constraint, even to\r\nprohibition, of that which fosters vice and extends its range must be\r\nadmitted by all thoughtful persons. Still, the right to prohibit and the\r\npower to prohibit are not identical. The only sure preventive is early\r\neducation of public conscience through the training of youth to a clear\r\nunderstanding of the vicious practices and their relation to the poverty\r\nand weakness and crime of humanity.\r\n\r\n_Destructive consumption._—A more obvious trespass upon prudential\r\nconsumption is criminal destructiveness of every kind. Until society\r\noutgrows a condition in which fraud, theft, robbery and murder must be\r\nwarded off by locks and bars, by immense bodies of policemen and armed\r\nmilitia, its wealth cannot be wholly invested for welfare. The possibility\r\nof such crimes as arson or train obstruction and destruction shows the\r\ncondition of the best of modern communities to be far from ideal. Nobody\r\npretends to measure the actual waste in society resulting from such\r\ncriminal purposes. It extends to almost every detail of production and\r\ntrade, and occupies a large portion of the inventive and executive energy\r\nof the people. Organized society attempts to restrain such waste by its\r\npolice force, or by restraining laws and in actions enforced by severe\r\npenalties. Every honest man is financially interested in the conviction of\r\nevery knave. Sympathy with fraud, even in trifles, is contributing toward\r\nsuch destructive waste.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the enormous expenditure in maintenance of standing\r\narmies and navies for the protection of national boundaries is of special\r\nimportance. Reduction of this waste of wealth and power should be desired\r\nby every class of society. Though war has been the means by which human\r\nliberty has grown, it has also been the means of crushing it. It would\r\nseem that every incentive is offered each citizen to make an appeal to\r\narms and the maintenance of armies a most remote necessity. Yet it seems\r\nthat the mass of men of every rank are tenacious of national honor. While\r\nmost communities have abandoned the duel as both wasteful and immoral in\r\npersonal difficulties, the spirit of the duel is still rife in the\r\ndifferences between nations. A clearer perception of mutual interests in\r\nnational welfare will bring nations, like individuals, to accept some\r\nmethod of enforcing neutral judgment for settling disputes, in place of\r\nwar. The farmers of a country, being nearly 50 per cent of its people, and\r\nbearing a large proportion of the expense of armies and wars, have a\r\ntremendous interest in maintaining peace. This can be done not so much by\r\nreducing the provision for armies as by cultivating the spirit of fair\r\nsettlement, against the false patriotism which claims everything for one’s\r\nown nation.\r\n\r\n_False notions of waste._—Wasteful expenditure and luxury and possibly\r\neven vicious indulgence are often excused with the plea that expenditures\r\nof this kind make employment for labor, and so aid the poor. While it is\r\ntrue that multitudes are employed in catering to the vices of others, all\r\nmust grant that the same wealth might be much better employed in other\r\noccupations. More than that, the larger wealth resulting from accumulation\r\nin place of waste would provide capital needed for fuller employment of\r\nall who can work. All imprudent expenditure reduces the power of society\r\nto accumulate wealth for giving occupation to all who will work. Moreover,\r\nsuch wastefulness creates a tendency toward thriftless character among the\r\npeople. The welfare of the whole community depends upon the thrift of the\r\nwhole community. The thriftlessness of rich men’s sons is more damaging\r\nthan the thriftlessness of tramps, because it is more tempting to others.\r\nAny man who lives simply to spend, however busy he keeps himself, is one\r\nof the wasteful ones in the community, unless he has some higher object\r\nthan gratifying his desires. The energetic idler may be doing his worst\r\nfor the community without being ranked as a spendthrift, because he makes\r\nsuch idleness respectable. It should be the desire of all good citizens to\r\nincrease the ability of every other citizen, not only to live, but to live\r\nwell. This thriftlessness can be overcome only by a strong public\r\nsentiment that corrects the early tendencies of youth to waste of means\r\nand energy.\r\n\r\n_Waste in rivalry._—There is another kind of wastefulness resulting from\r\nexcessive competition for a particular business or a particular trade.\r\nImmense amounts are expended upon rival advertisements, all of which enter\r\ninto the general cost to consumers. A multitude of retail dealers maintain\r\nstocks of goods entirely out of proportion to the needs of the community,\r\nbecause they are rivals in trade. Very likely the business rents are\r\nhigher than they need be because of such rivalry. Not only is there a\r\nstrong competition for a place, but also for showy equipment and elegance\r\nof display. All this could be saved by better organization. A still more\r\nevident waste is from the multiplication of agents and middle men of all\r\nkinds, employed simply in catching trade. Some of them act simply as\r\ninterlopers, hoping to gain a small commission without the use of capital\r\nor painstaking in their business. These are the useless middle men\r\nmaintained at the expense of the community. Full market reports and\r\ngeneral information of buyers and sellers greatly reduce such waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI. Social Organization For Consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Individualism._—While the social organization is necessarily thought of\r\nas a group of individuals, whose individual wants and plans and growth and\r\ncharacter must be the chief incentive for action, it is necessary to avoid\r\nthe extreme of individualism. In escaping from the false analogy implied\r\nin considering society an organism, there is a tendency to make the\r\nindividual not only of final importance but independent of association.\r\nExcess of competition is represented in the maxim, “Every man for\r\nhimself.” In the effort to carry out this maxim and in opposition to\r\nrestraints of society, whether by law or by custom, many are led to\r\nadvocate an abolition of organization, leaving all welfare to be secured\r\nby appeal to the individual judgment and conscience of men. It is true\r\nthat back of all law is the law of righteousness in individual souls.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of “autonomy” theorists propose to appeal to this\r\nconscience of individuals, making every soul a law to itself. Such\r\ntheorists assume that every human being will be wise and virtuous, or take\r\nthe consequences of his failure. They forget that all organizations for\r\nconstraint are a part of the natural consequences of failure in\r\nself-control.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of “anarchy” groups of people all over the world have\r\nunited to destroy what they consider arbitrary rules in government.\r\nAnarchists differ from autonomists in putting foremost the destruction of\r\nexisting governments. Their ideals of right and wrong and their methods of\r\nindividual action for individual welfare are left for the future to\r\ndevelop, after the rule of the present has become no-rule. Their present\r\norganization, as far as it is public, appears to be, in almost direct\r\ncontradiction of their principles, an absolute despotism. The same idea\r\nhas gained followers in some countries, particularly in Russia, under the\r\nname of “nihilism.”\r\n\r\nWhile in some instances such movements may be but a natural reaction\r\nagainst tyranny, the view of human wants and human welfare which all these\r\nadvocates present is far from being correct. The grand economic fact that\r\ngroups are superior to individuals in actual efficiency is beyond dispute;\r\nand it is equally true, though not so often stated, that groups gain\r\ngreatest satisfaction for a given consumption of wealth. It is only when\r\ngreat numbers share in satisfaction that the highest range of wants can be\r\ngratified. Moreover, even individual wants are largely social. Each finds\r\nhis highest pleasure in the society which nature has provided. The chief\r\nreasons for accumulating wealth are in what men can do for each other. Any\r\nindividualism which overlooks these principles is opposed to welfare, and\r\nso self-contradictory.\r\n\r\nThe famous French phrases, “laissez faire” and “laissez passer,” which\r\nrepresent the individualistic side of economic theory, are often extended\r\nbeyond the intent of the phrase makers. They mean essentially, let do, let\r\ngo, and have their proper application in an appeal to conservative society\r\nto so modify laws and customs that individual enterprise, ingenuity and\r\nthrift shall be stimulated to its best by freedom. Freedom from\r\nrestrictions in right-doing, under the evident motive furnished by general\r\nwelfare, is an ideal for society. In economic directions it has great\r\nimportance. No thinker can fail to see the trend of civilization toward\r\nsuch freedom. So far in the history of the world the enlargement of\r\nindividual responsibility, by freedom from constraint among the mature\r\nmembers of society, has been the chief mark of progress. Yet the\r\nconstraint of welfare, and of the general judgment as to what is welfare,\r\nas well as the necessity for agreement as to ways and means of reaching\r\nit, are better recognized today than ever before. The extreme of\r\nindividualism destroys the natural constraint of a common judgment.\r\n\r\n_Socialism._—The opposite extreme is the assumption that common wants are\r\nof supreme importance and common judgment absolutely efficient. Under the\r\nname of “communism” it stands in direct contrast with anarchy. Anarchists\r\nand communists may unite upon a platform of a single plank, opposition to\r\nexisting institutions; but in all ideals and purposes and plans for future\r\nwelfare they are absolutely opposed to each other. The natural community\r\nof interests so evident in society gives a fair basis for the general\r\nprinciples of communism. No doubt the welfare of all is the interest of\r\neach, and the world is growing to recognize it. Among a group of beings\r\nperfectly wise and virtuous there could be no clashing of either interests\r\nor judgment. The ideal of Louis Blanc, “From every man according to his\r\npowers, to every man according to his wants,” would represent the natural\r\nactivity of such a group. But in application to humanity, as it is and is\r\nbound to be by its weakness and waywardness, it seems abstractly ideal. In\r\nfact it is only roughly applicable in ends to be served, and suggests\r\nalmost nothing as to ways and means. Like the golden rule, it applies to\r\nthe disposition and purpose of the actor, but leaves the acts to be\r\ndecided by individual judgment.\r\n\r\nThe numerous phases of opinion in application of this principle cannot be\r\npresented even by name in this short chapter. They are worthy of study as\r\nindicating a growth of opinion and sentiment in recognition of the mutual\r\ndependence of all human beings. They are also worthy of study as\r\nindicating how arbitrary a zealot may become in enforcing his opinions\r\nupon others. All of them are grouped somewhat loosely under the name of\r\n“socialism,” but there are many gradations in the supremacy of the social\r\nideal over the individual welfare. There are also many shades of opinion\r\nas to how the final result of social supremacy shall be reached. Many are\r\nexpecting a revolution by force of arms to establish the ideals of the\r\nleaders. More are opportunists, snatching every opportunity in\r\nlegislation, in decision of courts, and in executive power, to apply their\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of “collectivism” appeals are made to the multitude to\r\ncombine their energies under leadership: first, to overcome present\r\nrestraints; and then to secure combined action in all modes of production\r\nand consumption. “Nationalism” is more familiar to our thought in the\r\nUnited States, as embracing the aim of a somewhat noisy party to bring\r\nabout the compulsory organization of all industries under the control of\r\nthe nation, even to placing all property and all methods of consumption\r\nunder an official despotism.\r\n\r\nFew recognize the actual logic of their views as compelling complete\r\nsubjection of every individual to others’ judgment, and fewer still have\r\nany idea of the official machinery needed for such control. The great\r\nmajority are satisfied in seeing evils which might be cured by greater\r\nsocial accord, expecting at once to vote into existence the necessary\r\nmachinery. Most of these are misled into considering wealth and its uses\r\nto be the chief elements of welfare. They forget that wealth is only a\r\nmeans of accomplishing one’s purposes toward his fellows and himself. The\r\ngreed of power and position and praise are far stronger as evil motives\r\nthan greed of wealth. If wealth were distributed by omniscient wisdom and\r\npower according to the maxim of Louis Blanc, the higher welfare would\r\nstill be as far away as ever, unless the same omniscience should control\r\nall actions. Such control by outward force would banish the very idea of\r\nvirtue, the highest of all welfare.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that every form of socialism, in practical methods,\r\ninvolves a leveling process inconsistent with human nature and its\r\nsurroundings. Equality of environments is possible only by reducing all to\r\nthe lowest condition. Equality of aspirations reduces all toward the most\r\nbrutal of the race. Even equality of efficiency reduces all to the power\r\nof the least efficient. So the whole range of method, assuming equality of\r\nwealth as important to welfare, lowers the welfare of the whole by\r\ndestroying the best abilities and the best capacities for enjoyment in\r\norder to prevent inequality.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it has not been proved that equality in any of these particulars\r\nis desirable. It is equally beyond proof that actual equality is possible.\r\nThe most absolute communism implies the greatest inequality in official\r\npower. Even the pleasing phrase, “Equality of opportunity,” will not bear\r\nanalysis as applied to human nature and human welfare, under the very\r\nhighest ideals of social unity. Indeed, the lesson of facts in all\r\nactivity is that inter-dependence of _unlike_ and _unequal_ forces makes\r\nthe true unity of organization, and the surest welfare of multitudes. That\r\neach individual should have the best opportunity possible for his own\r\ndevelopment is best for each and for all in a community; but that such\r\nopportunities shall be equal in any other sense no wisdom can contrive.\r\nMost socialistic theories presuppose almost immediate change of human\r\nnature under the new form of administration. But for this supposition\r\nthere is little ground in the history of the race or of all nature. Growth\r\nthere will be, and evolution of ideals; but the administration grows out\r\nof these, instead of being their cause.\r\n\r\n_Socialistic tendencies._—Socialistic theories gain adherence under the\r\nprovocation of certain tendencies in society. First, they appear whenever\r\nby oppression or fraud of any kind a community is made up of one class\r\npossessing wealth directly opposed to another class without wealth, with\r\nno extended middle class, and therefore with no ready means of transition\r\nfrom one class to another. As long as the doors are open for real progress\r\nin power of accomplishment, all the way from poverty to wealth, society\r\nhas a unity in its variety that is better than any communism promises. At\r\npresent in our own country, with the great multitude of farmers’ families\r\nfurnishing not only the necessities of life, but the larger part of human\r\nenergy that goes into every calling and every rank, socialism does not\r\nappeal to any large number. An earnest, thriving farmer’s family will\r\nnever believe advantage to come either to themselves or to the race by\r\nmaking them all practically mere wage-earners.\r\n\r\nSecond, a common cause of socialistic views is separation, under extreme\r\ndivision of labor and opposing organizations sustained by it, of the\r\nworkers in very distinct fields of labor. The jealousies arising between\r\nthese classes, or guilds, or between employers and employed, foster the\r\nrevolutionary spirit which jumps at any promise of relief from\r\nunsatisfactory conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, a political revolution, if it has destroyed landmarks\r\nof the past and any natural sentiments growing out of social relations,\r\nleaves a mass of people at sea with reference to the nature of rights.\r\nUnder such circumstances socialism offers an apparent solution of\r\ndifficulties unprovided for. Though any practical effort to apply these\r\ntheories under such circumstances usually results in despotic assumption\r\nof authority by a few, the people are moved by the pleasant-sounding\r\nphrases. If, in the settling of social affairs after a revolution, an\r\nearnest effort is made to agree upon set phrases embodying principles of\r\nconstitutional liberty, the chances are in favor of some sweeping\r\nstatements, too general to control action, but over-emphasizing individual\r\nrights in comparison with individual duties. Action under these\r\ndeclarations usually conforms to the necessities of the case, accepting\r\nthe immediate welfare of the society as a guide to more complete welfare.\r\n\r\nAll these conditions are abnormal, wholly unfavorable to a fair\r\nconsideration of what will promote welfare. Even if socialistic methods\r\nmight work fairly well when all were favorably disposed, there is great\r\nquestion whether they would work as well as present social methods, under\r\nequal good will. It must not be forgotten that every scheme of\r\nnationalization, for its own sake, implies the government of every\r\nindividual by everybody else, thus hampering under petty regulations and\r\nby force of multitudes the growth of every individual. No scheme for\r\nnational direction provides as natural tests for merit, ability,\r\nenterprise or necessity as present methods are known to do wherever fraud\r\nand tyranny are abolished.\r\n\r\n_Coöperative consumption._—In the natural order of social development\r\nthere is room for much more general association in the consumption of\r\nwealth than we sometimes think. The world has made great progress in this\r\ndirection during the last fifty years, through voluntary organizations for\r\nprudent expenditure. The only limit to such community of organization for\r\nspecial purposes is in the nature of the work and the relation of the\r\nworkers. Coöperative stores, banks, building and loan associations,\r\nlaundries and even kitchens are within the range of actual experiments. We\r\nhave already seen how such coöperative interests may operate in simple\r\ninvestment of capital for production. The chief obstacles in them all are\r\nthe lack of certain characteristics of prudence in a multitude. In general\r\nthe best management does not accord with the judgment of the mass.\r\n\r\nA few brief maxims may indicate the natural restrictions upon such\r\nmethods. Coöperative consumption is successful: first, where those\r\ncoöperating are fairly equal in wants and abilities, or closely related\r\nthrough kinship or friendship; second, where the range of coöperation\r\nincludes common wants; third, where no one is given the advantage of\r\ncredit; fourth, where mutual confidence selects and sustains a continuous\r\nmanagement; fifth, where frequent and full reports can make the business\r\nplain to all concerned. It would be interesting to follow the growth of\r\ncoöperative stores and banking associations from small beginnings to\r\nenormous enterprises, but the limits of this volume will not permit. This\r\nextension may be realized from the statement that the Rochedale\r\ncoöperative societies of England now number nearly two thousand, with more\r\nthan a million members and nearly seventy-five million dollars of capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII. Economic Functions Of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Governmental limits._—All society recognizes certain universal wants and\r\nthe necessity of meeting these with essential order and the best economy.\r\nThese universal wants enforce the organization of society under some form\r\nof government. Such an organization grows out of the necessity rather than\r\nthe will of humanity. Hence government, local or more general, is the\r\ndirect effort of individuals in society for the general welfare. Usually\r\nthe best test of general welfare is the assent of the majority of mature\r\nand intelligent members of the community. In the history of the world,\r\nhowever, the importance of the object to be gained has overcome obstacles\r\nin the will of the governed as much as any other. Among children the right\r\nof the parent to govern for the welfare of the family is never questioned\r\nuntil character and wisdom are doubted. Among crude and disorganized\r\nbodies of people, superior wisdom and earnest purpose make leadership. Yet\r\nalways, in the end, the ideal of welfare in any community implies growth\r\nof individuals into authority over themselves as one of its main objects,\r\nif not its chief one. Thus the best government for any community at any\r\nstage of its advancement is the one that best secures the welfare of all\r\nin existing circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the chief elements of welfare are above\r\ngovernment. All the kindly affections which make the chief bonds of\r\nsociety are to be cultivated by good government, but cannot be forced by\r\nany law, either positive or prohibitive. Individual character in all its\r\nproportions is individual growth, which can be fostered but not forced.\r\nAll the catalogue of virtues is made up of elements of character, not one\r\nof which can be made by force. So government of every grade fosters the\r\nhighest welfare of individuals by sustaining virtuous motives and\r\nrestraining vicious ones, or rather by encouraging right action in its\r\nenjoyment of welfare and restraining wrong action by deprivation of\r\nwelfare. Government, therefore, is best when its aims are distinctly\r\nconfined to universal welfare. The distinctly personal wants can be best\r\nprovided for by affording the best conditions for free exercise of\r\nindividual powers. Governments can never wisely do favors for a class,\r\nsince such favors weaken the power of government for promoting general\r\nwelfare. What government does for any it needs to do for all. What it does\r\nfor all it must secure to each in fair proportion. In any effort to extend\r\nthe range of governmental action this natural limit of universal welfare\r\nfor individuals must be considered.\r\n\r\n_Ends of government._—In this view of the reasons for organized government\r\nand its natural limits, certain universal wants can be clearly perceived.\r\nMost obvious is protection against external foes, personal or material.\r\nThis universal need, in the presence of personal enemies, is so plain as\r\nto make the crime of treason notorious. The internal peace of society is\r\njust as evidently a universal necessity, and so any infringement upon the\r\norder of society, as agreed upon either by express statute or by the\r\ncommon law of established precedent, is punished as a crime against all.\r\nPersonal violence, even in the shape of private vengeance for wrong done,\r\nis a menace to internal order, and so a crime against the whole\r\norganization. The mutual dependence of each upon all and all upon each in\r\nevery-day transactions enforces the interest of the organization in\r\npersonal contracts, and makes the government a partner with every\r\nright-doer against every wrong-doer in all attempts at fraud or abuse of\r\npower of every kind. This guardianship of personal freedom makes necessary\r\nthe bulk of criminal law and most of the machinery of courts. The\r\narbitration of disputes between interested parties is a natural sequence\r\nof the effort to prevent violence. Government does not and cannot right\r\nwrongs; it barely saves a remnant of good to the individual wronged, and\r\nfurnishes a warning to others against future wrong.\r\n\r\n_Universal needs._—Every force, external or internal, which is likely to\r\nbe injurious to the whole community, the whole community through its\r\norganization is obliged to combat. Hence the necessity for quarantine\r\nagainst infections diseases wherever found, and provision against\r\ndestructive storms wherever possible. Protection against the ravages of\r\ninsects falls into the same list, and so does every safeguard in which the\r\nwhole community is interested. The same principle applies to positive\r\nprovisions for welfare in economical ways of meeting universal wants. The\r\nuniversality of the need makes the water supply and the lighting of cities\r\na proper work for the city organization. If the same machinery can provide\r\nmost economically for larger personal wants without infringing upon the\r\nrights of all, simple economy invites it, and the principles of good\r\ngovernment sustain it. The question of municipal lighting is simply one of\r\ntrue economy for the entire body of citizens.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, that everybody needs it, the government is obliged to\r\nhave control of the means of transit so far as ease and safety and economy\r\nto all require. Government must maintain highways suited to the needs of\r\nthe community at all stages of its development. The question of city\r\nmanagement of street car lines, beyond such control as secures safety and\r\nessential justice, is purely one of economy for all concerned; that is,\r\nfor the entire community. This economy is not settled for one community by\r\nthe conditions of any other. It must be decided in each community whose\r\ninterests are to be served by the actual need and abilities of that\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said in regard to all methods of providing ready\r\ncommunication of wants and abilities as needed for mutual welfare. The\r\npostal system is a natural government machine, because every citizen needs\r\nto be within reach of every other citizen in the same community. If\r\ngovernment does not furnish the machinery, it must control it to the same\r\nend. The extent of the machine must be decided by the extent of the want.\r\nIf the want is sufficiently universal, the organization cannot avoid\r\nproviding the machinery. This principle applies to every form of\r\ncommunication devised or discovered. The question of government ownership\r\nof telegraph or telephone connections becomes one of simple economy,\r\nwhenever the community finds such means of communication a matter of\r\nuniversal want. If economy or vested rights of individuals prevent such\r\nprovision, government must still guard these universal interests by\r\ninspection and control. The exact point where government ownership becomes\r\neconomical and legitimate must be decided by a careful weighing of the\r\ngeneral interests of the whole community.\r\n\r\n_Universal education._—The necessity for universal intelligence is so\r\nevident that governments not only recognize and foster benevolent efforts\r\nof individuals for education, but rightly make the organization itself a\r\ndirect force in maintaining educational institutions. Public schools are\r\nnow universally recognized by most enlightened people as meeting a\r\nuniversal need, and therefore one of the essentials of good government.\r\nHow extensive such provision should be is still an unsettled question. In\r\nfact, it can never be finally settled in any growing community, because\r\nthe universal need of the community becomes more and more extended. So far\r\nas universal intelligence depends upon the higher intelligence of leaders\r\nin the community, the whole mass is interested in the training of that\r\nhigher intelligence. The very nature of education, shedding its light over\r\nall in its neighborhood, makes every member of the community a sharer in\r\nthe advantages of university training. Hence governments rightly and\r\neconomically administer educational systems which involve the welfare of\r\nall. The same responsibility makes improper the use of public funds in\r\nsupport of private institutions without such restrictions as insure the\r\ngood of all.\r\n\r\nThe propriety of governmental control of churches and religious training\r\nmust rest upon the same basis of principle. Religion is of such a personal\r\nnature, so wholly a matter of conscience, that it cannot be said in any\r\nproper sense to be universal. Yet the need of religions sentiment and\r\nfreedom in development of that sentiment is universal. The state does well\r\nto provide security for religious thought, practices and fostering\r\ninfluences in all governmental machinery. On this ground the civil law\r\nprotects a Sabbath. The state church has had its apparent reason for\r\nexistence, and still has in many parts of the world, from the close\r\nconnection between religious training and popular education. Naturally\r\nstate churches emphasize the educational side of religions institutions.\r\nThe world is coming to see more clearly the dividing line between\r\ninformation or thought about religion and religious action in faith, its\r\ncommon basis, and can leave the latter for individual growth.\r\n\r\n_Government wards._—The welfare of the whole reaches finally to a\r\nguardianship over such individuals in the community as endanger, either by\r\nweakness or by wickedness, that welfare. For this reason government can\r\nmaintain asylums for the weak or diseased, or even the extremely ignorant,\r\nnot simply to protect these individuals, perhaps not chiefly for that\r\npurpose, but to protect the whole. It can rightly and wisely enforce such\r\nprotection by health regulations and officers, and by truant laws and\r\nofficials. Upon this principle it may rightly constrain even the friends\r\nof insane persons to give up control of the insane to the safer public\r\nprovision in asylums. When any community realizes a similar need with\r\nreference to inebriates, it will assume the same constraining authority.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the problem of personal wickedness, a community must still\r\ndraw the line between universal and individual welfare. The criminal\r\ninjures all; therefore all must constrain him, and effort is made to\r\nmeasure that constraint by the evidence of opposition to public welfare.\r\nVices are more distinctly individual. They touch the universal welfare in\r\nthose forms which propagate vice in neighborhoods. Governments universally\r\nfail to enforce laws against personal vices wherever the danger to upright\r\ncharacter in other persons is not clearly perceived. All restrictive\r\nlegislation upon vicious habits, like intemperance, gambling or other\r\nimmoral practices, is naturally aimed first at the places contrived to\r\nfoster such habits, and therefore to attack the innocent. The actual\r\nworking of such legislation in preventing the growth of vice is the only\r\nfinal test of its wisdom. What it _can_ do is what it _ought_ to do. In\r\ngeneral the actual public sentiment in local communities must be the main\r\ndependence for executing such laws.\r\n\r\n_Protection of the weak._—The common statement that government must\r\nprotect the weak against the strong is subject to the same principle of\r\nuniversal welfare, and is applicable only where society has definitely\r\nrecognized rules of good order which somebody is violating. Any attempt to\r\nsupply to the weak a strength which they cannot wield is necessarily a\r\nfailure. But society as a whole rightly shields children and youth, and\r\neven women of mature years, from burdens which may injure the general\r\nhealth or wisdom or virtue of the community. Laws prohibiting contracts\r\nwhich involve such burdens can be enforced so far as the community\r\nappreciates the evil of such contracts. So, to a certain extent, weakness\r\nfrom ignorance may be protected by any method that tends to remove the\r\ncause of weakness. All such action of government must be carefully guarded\r\nagainst becoming such a protection as will render the weak weaker.\r\n\r\n_Public responsibility._—The organization of community is best for the\r\nmass of the people when all desires are allowed to give their proper\r\nimpulse to action, and when every enterprise is encouraged by freedom\r\nuntil it is seen to infringe upon the general welfare. Any system of\r\ngovernment which checks natural impulses and hinders individual\r\nenterprise, without clear evidence that all must suffer from such freedom,\r\nis harmful. The genuine application of the phrase \"laissez faire\" is in\r\ngiving honest efforts free course, because these efforts secure the\r\nlargest good. It really means, leave humanity free until injury is\r\nattempted. In general, government has to deal with all necessities which\r\nare identical throughout the community. Provision for those necessities\r\nand those only it is bound to make.\r\n\r\nAll questions of nationalization of industries or of community consumption\r\nmust be brought to the test of universal need. What the whole community\r\nwants the whole community has a right to provide in the way which brings\r\nmost good with least expenditure of exertion in any form. No other\r\nquestion can outweigh in importance this one of public need or public\r\nwelfare. Every producer and every consumer is interested in seeing that\r\nsuch welfare is not overlooked by the public, or infringed upon by any\r\nindividual or combination of individuals in his community. This must be\r\ndone by emphasizing personal responsibility, even in public enterprises.\r\nFor the statement is beyond dispute, that the attempt to substitute\r\ncorporate responsibility for personal responsibility ends in no\r\nresponsibility at all. Above all things it is necessary to remember that\r\nall the progress yet made from the starvation and degradation of barbarism\r\nhas been by organized interest of the whole community in protecting first\r\nindividual life, second individual liberty, and third individual property,\r\nas the foundation of universal welfare. Yet society holds all these rights\r\nof individuals subject to the same higher law of welfare by restricting\r\nthe purpose of individuals when possible, and action always, if it opposes\r\nthe total welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII. Economic Machinery Of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Resources of government._—All expenditures of government are as subject\r\nto economic laws with reference to consumption of wealth as are those of\r\nindividuals. Actual result in welfare is the only reason for such\r\nexpenditure. Hence the same tests of economy are applied. Government makes\r\nbut few expenditures for the immediate purpose of reproducing and\r\nincreasing wealth. So far as its investments sustain productive industry,\r\nand the products of that industry enter into the world’s market, they are\r\nsubject to the same economic laws of supply and demand that govern all\r\nproduction of wealth. If in any case they are not, it is because of\r\ngovernment monopoly cornering the market, or because of unnatural\r\nconditions of government production undermining the market. In general,\r\ngovernment is simply expending for the common welfare a part of the wealth\r\nproduced by individual effort.\r\n\r\nIts resources are in small part derived from fees for special services\r\nrendered to individuals of the community. Such are fees for registration\r\nof deeds and mortgages, and of the same nature, though for convenience of\r\ncollection paid in a different way, is the revenue from sale of postage\r\nstamps and stamped envelopes. Revenue may come from pay for certain\r\nspecial privileges or franchises established by license or patent. These\r\nare supposed to be not so much in payment for special service as for\r\nsharing in responsibility and cost of protection. Another source of\r\nrevenue is in the shape of money penalty, or fine, for minor trespasses\r\nupon good order. Such revenues are accidental, and diminish as the\r\ngovernment becomes more perfect. Under peculiar circumstances of\r\nopposition by citizens or bodies of citizens to the general order,\r\ngovernment confiscates property used in such opposition. A good\r\nillustration of this is connected with smuggling, where the introducer of\r\nforeign goods opposes government in its revenue laws by fraud or violence,\r\nand suffers the confiscation of goods so introduced.\r\n\r\nNone of the foregoing sources of revenue, unless it be the license, and\r\nthis is sometimes a mere method of taxation, can serve to any great extent\r\nthe purposes of government. All government expenditures for general\r\nwelfare must finally be met by some system of distributing the burden over\r\nall the people. This method of distribution is called taxation. The\r\nprincipal revenue is raised by taxation of possessors and producers of\r\nwealth, in anticipation of current public needs.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason government expenditures exceed its revenues, the\r\ngovernment, like any individual, becomes a borrower. It may borrow by\r\ncontract to pay at some future time for construction of buildings or\r\nmachinery, or by issue of scrip in the shape of promises to pay at some\r\ndefinite or indefinite time in the future, or more distinctly still by\r\nsale of bonds, which are definite certificates of indebtedness, negotiated\r\nlike the notes of individuals in great banking centers. Yet all of these\r\nare only methods of postponing the taxation which must support the\r\ngovernment in its necessary machinery. Government can live upon credit in\r\nthe same way, and only in the same way, that individuals can. The economic\r\nreasons for such credit must be the same as in individual experience.\r\n\r\n_Principles of taxation._—Since taxation in general is simply a way of\r\ndistributing expenses to those for whose benefit expenditure has been\r\nmade, the first question is one of fairness in distribution. The benefits\r\nfrom government expenditure ought to be universal, but are not necessarily\r\nequal. Like all the good things of nature, the benefits of the government\r\nare not appreciated by all alike. No one would probably suggest the\r\npossibility of distributing the expenditure exactly in accord with\r\nadvantage received. Wherever the service is distinctly personal, as in the\r\nregular mail service, an attempt is made to charge each person the average\r\ncost of the service. Even the large miscellaneous mail distribution at\r\nless than cost may be fairly borne by those who use the mail for personal\r\nadvantage, since this is likely to be in proportion to the intelligent\r\nactivity shown in correspondence. Some few taxes upon special commodities\r\nof questionable advantage to the multitude, like liquors and tobacco, are\r\nsupposed to be paid by those who gain the only advantage received by\r\nanybody in protecting their use.\r\n\r\nSome more general principle, however, must be found for adjusting the\r\nburden of general expenses so that each individual will bear his share. If\r\nthe burden belongs to all, it should rest fairly upon all. Hence equality\r\nis usually given as the first principle of taxation. But it is evident\r\nthat in this case equality means equity, not a mathematical division by\r\nthe number of taxpayers. The interpretation is therefore “according to\r\nability.” According to Professor Rogers, the student of economic history,\r\n“_Equality of sacrifice is the only honest rule in taxation_.” This means,\r\nin practice, that any system of taxation should be planned with distinct\r\neffort to distribute the common expenses according to the ability of\r\ndifferent members of society to meet them.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that no exact gauge of ability is at hand. If the actual\r\nincome of every citizen could be distinctly known, and the burdens of a\r\ndependent household clearly expressed, a basis for equal sacrifice, so far\r\nas wealth is concerned, might be reached. But no such basis has been or\r\ncan be actually found. If found, it would not give an accurate gauge of\r\nsacrifice, because the actual wants for comfort of different individuals\r\nare so widely varied. Two distinct approximations toward this equity are\r\nfound. The first is in the total annual consumption of the individual\r\ntaxpayer, especially of such articles as meet wants above the mere\r\nmaintenance of healthy existence. In this the government assumes that all\r\nwill spend according to their ability. The second is in a total\r\naccumulation of property. In this the government assumes that every man\r\nsaves for future consumption all that he gains above his present needs.\r\nBoth assumptions are untrue in individual cases, and only approximately\r\ntrue anywhere. In many instances the expenditure of a given year upon more\r\ncontinuous wants than ordinary, like a home or farm buildings, will count\r\nalso as wealth laid by. So, in any combination of the two systems of\r\ntaxation, the more thrifty and far-seeing will bear a double burden. Yet\r\neven this combination may not transgress the rule of equity, since such\r\nforesight is itself proof of ability.\r\n\r\nTo this first principle of equity we may add others, less fundamental, but\r\nequally important in practice. _Taxes must be sufficiently definite to be\r\nunderstood and provided for by every taxpayer._ This is needed for\r\nmaintaining the interest of every citizen in both the necessity and the\r\neconomy of public expenditures. _Taxes must be so levied and collected as\r\nto be conveniently paid._ This means that private enterprise shall be\r\nhindered as little as possible in making assessments, and that times and\r\nplaces of collection shall be suited to the convenience of taxpayers. _The\r\ncollection of taxes must be by such methods as will involve least outlay,\r\neither in salaries of officials or in machinery of the collecting\r\nprocess._ These four principles of taxation were announced by Adam Smith\r\nmore than a hundred years ago, and have commended themselves to students\r\nof the subject ever since. It is evident that the last three are more\r\nexplicit methods for carrying out the first. Most briefly stated; they\r\nimply equity, definiteness, convenience of paying, and economy in\r\ncollecting.\r\n\r\nMost legislation with reference to taxes shows some effort to carry out\r\none, if not all, of these requirements. It is evident that a tax may be\r\nconveniently paid in connection with ordinary expenditures, and at the\r\nsame time be very indefinite and quite inequitable. Many taxes upon\r\narticles of every-day use in the home are of this nature. A very equitable\r\ntax may be so inconvenient from its interference with private interests,\r\nand require so many officials for collection, as to make it a serious\r\nburden to all. Such a tax would be one levied upon net income, supposing\r\nit possible to discover the exact facts for such a levy. Taxes levied\r\nwithout consideration of these principles are defended as means of\r\nchecking extravagance or vice, as equalizing other conditions of welfare,\r\nor as correcting inequalities from other existing methods of taxation.\r\nEven these last assume the necessity of equity in the entire system or\r\ngroup of systems.\r\n\r\n_Direct and indirect taxation._—For convenience of study, taxes are spoken\r\nof as either direct or indirect; that is, a tax may be levied upon one\r\nwhose property or earnings must be reduced by the amount of the tax, or a\r\ntax may be levied upon one whose property when sold, or whose service when\r\nrendered to another, will be worth as much more as the burden of the tax\r\nhe has paid. A poll tax, an income tax, a tax on the farm, or a tax on\r\nhousehold goods and jewelry, is assumed to be paid by the owner or user,\r\nwithout reimbursement. But a tax on stock in trade—like the farmer’s live\r\nstock—or upon the machinery of production or service—like railroads,\r\ninsurance companies and banks—is assumed to be transferred as an\r\nadditional expense to the one who finally enjoys the wealth.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that such a distinction is difficult. Every owner of\r\nwealth will consider taxes connected with its possession a part of the\r\ncost of such wealth, and wherever possible in the conditions of the market\r\nwill count a tax in the selling price. It is impossible to judge from the\r\nform of wealth or the nature of the service when the tax can be\r\ntransferred to a final user. A farmer’s wheat may be the source from which\r\nhe pays the total cost of raising it, including taxes upon the land\r\nemployed. If, in the condition of the wheat market, he has still a profit\r\nupon his management, he will assume that the wheat buyers have paid the\r\ntaxes. If the market price is so low as to not cover the cost, he will\r\nemphasize the fact that he pays the taxes. Yet probably the fact is the\r\nsame in both cases, that the owner of the land has his profits diminished\r\nby the actual amount of the tax. More strictly, the tax is taken from the\r\nrent of his land. In any case of over-production, when land gives no rent,\r\nthe tax will be paid by the producer out of other income. So far, however,\r\nas farm products conform to the principle of cost of production in the\r\ntendency of prices, there will be a corresponding tendency to shift the\r\ntax upon the final consumer.\r\n\r\nThus direct and indirect taxes are not always distinguishable; but in the\r\ntax systems of the United States most state and municipal taxes are\r\nassumed to be direct, because levied upon persons and more permanent forms\r\nof property, while the taxes of the general government are by the\r\nConstitution indirect, unless levied upon the states according to\r\npopulation. They are in the form of customs or excise, in which some\r\narticle of commerce or some service rendered gives a value upon which the\r\ntax may be transferred. Thus the state, the county, the city and the\r\nschool district levy upon assessment of property and enumeration of polls.\r\nThe United States collects upon imported goods of various kinds, upon\r\nspecial articles of manufacture, upon persons or corporations carrying on\r\nparticular business, and upon commercial transactions of various kinds.\r\n\r\n_Assessment of direct taxes._—Assessment implies an enumeration of\r\nproperty in the possession of supposed owners and an appraisement of its\r\nvalue. The officer making the assessment is under constraint of an\r\nofficial oath to give a fair valuation. The market price is supposed to\r\ncontrol his judgment, and is usually explicitly named in law.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice in various states of the Union assessed valuation often\r\nfalls as low as one-third or even one-fifth of a fair estimate at market\r\nvalue. This is brought about by several causes. Each assessor fears\r\nover-valuation, lest his district will bear too large a share of more\r\ngeneral expenses; and his successor is inclined rather to lower than raise\r\nthe standard of value, from neighborly interest. Even if the assessors of\r\nan entire county agree upon terms of valuation, they are together under\r\nthe same influence with reference to state and special taxes. A more\r\ndefinite cause of under-valuation is the practice of exempting a certain\r\nlimited amount of property from all taxes. If personal property worth $200\r\nis exempt from taxation for every householder, the smaller the assessment\r\nfor his total property, the larger in proportion is the exemption.\r\nSpecific taxes at a fixed rate, for state or school or improvement\r\npurposes, operate in the same way to force down the valuation of property\r\nin the entire state or district. In assessment of real estate even greater\r\nviolence is sometimes done to equity. In newly settled portions of the\r\ncountry the valuation of land held in the name of non-resident owners is\r\nnotoriously high. Often in cities the assessor is subject to political\r\ninfluences and social connections in such a way as to destroy all equity\r\nin taxation. The official oath attached to such assessments is a sham.\r\n\r\nIf all property of stated kinds were equally and fairly valued, the burden\r\nof taxation would be most fairly distributed as regards property owners.\r\nAny tendency to undervalue is sure to oppress the weaker part of these\r\nproperty holders. If the price of a horse is fixed at twenty dollars, when\r\nthe average price is sixty, the more wealthy owner of horses whose average\r\nvalue is above the general average has a larger part of his property\r\nexempt than the poorer owner whose horses are below the average. In the\r\nsame ratio all household goods and even farms and buildings are\r\nunder-estimated.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is proper to mention the exemption of certain\r\nproperty devoted wholly to public welfare and contributing alike to the\r\ngood of all citizens. In every state there are multitudes of schools,\r\ncreated and sustained by gifts of benevolent men. These supplement and\r\nextend the work of the state for general enlightenment, and are wisely\r\nencouraged by exemption from the burden of taxation, because their entire\r\nincome is devoted to the same ends which the state serves. Public\r\nlibraries and churches, devoted to such general enlightenment and moral\r\ngrowth, are wisely included in this exemption. Nobody suffers, but\r\neverybody gains, by the use of private property for such purposes. If in\r\nany way these institutions serve the private ends of individuals, those\r\nindividuals become themselves property owners, subject to the same\r\ntaxation as others. Such exemptions may extend even to art collections\r\nmade by private funds, and to extensive grounds laid out in parks,\r\nprovided they are open to the public and serve as a means of wholesome\r\nrecreation and culture.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, specific exemptions of private property from any\r\ntaxes lead to abuse of privileges, jealousies and popular dissatisfaction,\r\nwhich result in danger to government and harm to the people. Exemptions of\r\nproperty used for particular purposes, like a farmer’s team, may be\r\nthought of as a bounty upon such means of production. But the effect is\r\nalmost always to the disadvantage of the weak, and the practice gives a\r\ngeneral encouragement to the disposition to escape taxes. Farmers, of all\r\nclasses of people, are most interested in a fair and painstaking\r\nassessment of all forms of property. Their influence is most widely\r\nextended and far-reaching in its effects. The whole community should be\r\nled to realize the absolute necessity of fair taxation and prompt meeting\r\nof individual responsibility. Fraud in the treatment of taxes is a crime\r\nagainst society, whether it involves false swearing or not. It partakes of\r\nthe nature of treason, and may well be subjected to severe penalties.\r\nUsually, however, a penalty in the shape of additional taxes and\r\nforfeiture of property by sale for taxes, with room for redemption at\r\nconsiderable expense, are sufficient to secure a proper assessment and\r\ncollection, if the community are really in earnest in resisting the fraud.\r\n\r\n_Indirect taxes._—The methods of indirect taxation by excise and custom\r\nduties have been familiar for ages. They are usually favored by\r\npoliticians who dread the opposition of the people to taxation, because\r\nthe collection is so incidental to ordinary expenditures as scarcely to be\r\nrealized and never clearly measured. Few users of tobacco or strong drink\r\nhave any distinct idea what portion of the cost represents the government\r\nrevenue. Still less in drinking the cup of coffee, or sweetening it with\r\nsugar, does the person benefited weigh the tax he pays. It is doubtful if\r\nmost of those who read this, actually know that sugar pays a tax, while\r\ntea and coffee do not, in our country.\r\n\r\nSo convenient is this mode of taxation that it forms the favorite mode of\r\ndiscrimination in favor of productive industries. A tariff of 50 per cent\r\nupon imported cloth may actually increase the price of similar cloths\r\nmanufactured at home by nearly that amount, thus fostering cloth-making by\r\na premium on the product, while only a few discover the added burden of\r\nthe tax. Yet these modes of taxation are usually costly to the people.\r\nEven if free from complications with either preventing vice or fostering\r\nindustry, they require a separate body of officials from those provided\r\nfor direct taxation. They involve investment by every wholesale and retail\r\ndealer of extra capital in taxes, upon which extra interest and profit is\r\nexpected. The actual consumer bears this extra burden with only partial\r\nrealization of its bulk. If duties are high, the temptation to smuggling\r\nand fraud becomes great, and a force of officials must be stretched around\r\nthe borders of a country to prevent it.\r\n\r\n_Custom, or duty._—Duties are said to be either specific or ad valorem.\r\nSpecific duties are a definite sum upon every pound, ton, yard or other\r\nunit of measure, applied to the article taxed. They are easily assessed,\r\nand misrepresentation or fraud is scarcely possible. Ad valorem duties are\r\na certain rate per cent upon the invoice value of the goods. In these,\r\nfrauds are abundant, and experts are required to prevent them. Specific\r\nduties are relatively heavy upon the consumers of goods of cheaper\r\nquality. A tax of 25 cents on each yard of cloth worth a dollar is five\r\ntimes as heavy as the same tax on cloth worth five dollars. Equalization\r\nis frequently attempted by combination of specific duties upon all goods\r\nof a certain character with ad valorem duties upon all such goods above a\r\ncertain quality.\r\n\r\n_Excise collections._—The same difficulty is experienced in adjusting\r\ntaxes by excise under our internal revenue system. Such revenues are\r\nlargely collected through a sale of stamps, though the dealer himself may\r\nbe required to pay a license fee, to secure the necessary inspection.\r\nHere, too, the tax is specific and bears most heavily upon the users of\r\nthe poorest grade of goods. If attempt is made to grade it by quality,\r\nexpensive machinery for preventing fraud is necessary. This is well\r\nillustrated in the list of officials required in connection with\r\ndistilleries and bonded warehouses. Both the manufacture and the sale of\r\nalcoholic liquors must somewhere be under the inspection of an expert\r\nofficer. All this necessary expense of collecting must be borne by the\r\nconsumers. The bonded warehouse itself must not be mistaken for a part of\r\nthis machinery, though it is essential to the collection. It is simply a\r\ndevice by which the holder of manufactured liquors subject to sale can\r\navoid the payment of a tax until the time of actual delivery. His\r\nwarehouse, being under bonds to the government, is open only in the\r\npresence of the revenue officer, who carries one of the keys necessary to\r\nits opening. Without this the tax would have to be paid at time of\r\nmanufacture, and interest on that amount, to greater or less extent would\r\nfinally be paid by the consumer. While this system protects essentially\r\nagainst fraud on the part of the owner alone, it does not protect against\r\nthe weakness or wickedness of officials, and the temptation is sometimes\r\nenormous.\r\n\r\n_Peculiar taxes._—Aside from these general forms of taxation, peculiar\r\ndevices are common. The stamps required on official papers or commercial\r\ntransactions, involving checks, notes, mortgages and deeds, have been\r\nfamiliar at various times in our country, and are associated with the\r\nhistory of the world. These differ little from the practice of affixing\r\nstamps to patent medicines, cigars and other articles of trade; but\r\ninstead of being attached to the article transferred they are affixed to\r\nthe check or note or deed or bond employed in the transaction. These bear\r\nunequally, being proportionally heavy upon the people of small means, and\r\nare generally annoying in active business. They are frequently favored,\r\nhowever, as being felt most by those who deal most in commerce.\r\n\r\nThe heavy taxes laid upon the consumption of alcoholic liquors and tobacco\r\nillustrate another device for making so-called luxury bear the heavier\r\nportion of taxes. It looks both ways, attempting to check luxurious living\r\nor vicious practices by a penalty for indulgence, and at the same time to\r\nsecure a revenue as the result of such indulgence. Evidently in so far as\r\nit prohibits indulgence it is not a revenue measure; and in so far as it\r\nsecures the revenue it does not prohibit indulgence. It is borne somewhat\r\npatiently, because each person feels that he can avoid the payment by\r\nceasing to indulge himself. The universal tendency is to make it purely a\r\nrevenue measure by fixing the tax just where it will not retard\r\nconsumption in any material degree, and in some instances will give a\r\nquasi dignity to the dealer through his official license.\r\n\r\n_Taxation of credits._—A very common device adopted in most of the states\r\nis that of assessing credits as well as property. The majority of farmers\r\nfavor the assessment of mortgages upon a valuation equal to, if not higher\r\nthan, that upon farms. They forget that the ability to pay taxes from year\r\nto year comes out of the profit or rent from the farm; and if both farm\r\nand mortgage are taxed, the adjustment comes through the interest which\r\nthe mortgage must bear. To illustrate, a father sells his farm, worth\r\n$5,000, to his son, taking a mortgage for the entire value. If mortgages\r\nare assessed, the value of that farm for all purposes of taxation is\r\n$10,000; and yet the living of both father and son, taxes included, comes\r\nout of that farm’s production. The two have no more property and no more\r\nability after the transaction than before. Thus the mortgaged farms in\r\nevery community where mortgages are taxed bear double burden.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way the taxation of any form of notes or bonds or stock\r\ndoubles the assessment in form without increasing the abilities. _The\r\nactual property in use will finally bear the burden of both assessments._\r\nThe road-bed and rolling stock of a railway are property whose value is\r\nreadily estimated. The actual ownership is in a corporation which may be\r\ndistinctly taxed. Certificates of stock are individual titles in that\r\ncorporation whose property has already been taxed. Its outstanding bonds\r\nare simply claims against that corporation, to be paid out of that\r\nproperty which has already been taxed. So every note, being evidence of\r\ndebt simply, is not a representative of property, but simply a claim\r\nagainst property supposed to exist somewhere else. It may be an absolute\r\nfiction, in being a claim against property only hoped for. The result of\r\nall efforts to treat certificates of indebtedness as personal property are\r\nhardship to debtors and apparent fraud on the part of many creditors. Even\r\nthough the creditor escapes taxation by hiding his possession of a\r\nmortgage, the possibility of its being taxed is always counted in his\r\nbargain with the borrower as an important element in interest. The\r\nexperience of those states in which such taxation has been abolished\r\nproves that lower rates of interest are sure to follow.\r\n\r\n_Income taxes._—A favorite device in some countries, and often advocated\r\nin this, is a direct tax upon incomes above a certain amount, graduated so\r\nas to give a much larger rate upon large incomes than upon more moderate\r\nones. The most obvious reason for such a distinction against the large\r\nincomes is the evident failure of our national system of taxation to\r\ndistribute the burden according to ability. It is evident that the\r\nexpenditures of the very wealthy for such articles as bring revenue to the\r\ngovernment are not in the same proportion to their income as the\r\nexpenditures of the poorer people are to their incomes. A further reason\r\nis based upon the supposition that large incomes involve a considerable\r\nunearned increment, in the shape of rent or extraordinary profits, because\r\nof accidental opportunity or the crowding of population. An income tax,\r\ncarefully graduated, is supposed to cause such extra privileges and\r\nopportunities to bear a fair share of government expenses.\r\n\r\nThere are several difficulties in administering such a tax which have\r\nstood in the way of its general and permanent adoption. No one has yet\r\ndevised a certain or fair method of estimating income. The peculiarities\r\nof any business or employment make great variation in the ability given by\r\na certain income in dollars and cents. The business man in a small town,\r\nwith an income of $5,000, might live in relative luxury, and still have a\r\nsurplus for investment in his business. The same man, attempting business\r\nin a large city, might, even with an income of $10,000, find it barely\r\npossible to keep up appearances. The income of farmers is largely in\r\nprovisions and personal privileges from use of teams, etc., never counted\r\nin dollars and cents, while the village mechanic pays from his measured\r\nincome for all such comforts, or goes without them. The actual, necessary\r\nexpenses of the business of a professional man in the way of books and\r\ntravel are as essential to his business as are farm implements and live\r\nstock to the farm; yet no one counts such expenses as a subtraction from\r\nthe income. A teacher promoted to a higher position is at once subjected\r\nto extraordinary expenses, and may be less able with a higher salary to\r\nmeet the requirements of his new life than he was with a lower salary to\r\nmeet the less expensive requirements.\r\n\r\nAnother principal difficulty is the unpopularity of such a tax from its\r\nnecessary interference with private business. The country will be almost\r\ncertainly more divided along lines of wealth over an income tax than over\r\nanything else. On the part of the wealthy it seems an effort of the people\r\nto take from them actual property rights. On the part of the poorer\r\nclasses it fosters the assumption that the more wealthy are unjustly so.\r\nIn the nature of the case, it is an arbitrary adjustment without the\r\npossibility of establishing exact reasons for any distinctions made.\r\nFinally, since such distinctions are liable to be varied from time to\r\ntime, an income tax requires some nice adjustment as to the nature of the\r\nincome. An income from the sale of property is entirely different in\r\ncharacter from the income made by interest on the same property. One is a\r\npart of permanent investment, the other is the result of productive\r\ninvestment. One destroys the principal if consumed, the other adds to the\r\nprincipal. Yet no one could arrive at the actual, natural income, without\r\na most intricate system of book-keeping open to public inspection. For\r\nwithout public inspection the temptation to fraudulent returns, under the\r\nfeeling that the tax is unjust, is so strong as to be demoralizing.\r\n\r\n_Inheritance taxes._—A device much employed for making large accumulations\r\nof wealth bear a larger portion of the community’s burdens is a heavy tax\r\nupon inheritance. Since such inheritance requires the guardianship of law\r\nfor security of transfer, government is suffered to take a liberal fee for\r\nsuch transfer. Moreover, the inheritor is assumed to have no such property\r\ninterest in what has been accumulated by another as to claim that he can\r\nbe wronged if government takes a portion. It is defended also by\r\nsocialists on the ground that large estates are dangerous to the general\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nSome facts bear upon the opposite side, and are worthy of consideration. A\r\nlarge estate is the accumulation of enterprise and industry on the part of\r\na man of more than ordinary abilities. The presumption is in favor of\r\nfollowing his judgment in making that useful after his death. Most\r\nfrequently it is employed in some huge industrial machine, which the\r\npublic cannot manage, but can destroy by even taking a portion from it.\r\nOne of the main stimulants to all accumulation is the provision for the\r\nfuture wants of a family. If the state takes the accumulation, it also\r\ntakes the responsibility for the successors in the family line. Wherever\r\nit is applied, it is felt to be a heavy burden upon the community at\r\nlarge. If the state interferes with the freedom of a testator, the chances\r\nare that few estates will be accumulated, and wasteful methods of\r\nexpenditure, diminishing the power of the entire community, will surely\r\nfollow. Moreover, evasions of the inheritance tax are comparatively easy,\r\nand are likely to be adopted extensively by the holders of large estates.\r\nThe very rich can give away a large portion of their property before death\r\nwithout material suffering. Only the moderately wealthy are obliged to\r\nhold on to their possessions until death. Any wealthy man can dispose of\r\nhis wealth during his lifetime, and still retain its income, by giving it\r\naway, subject to an annuity. To prevent this the law would have to be\r\nextended with intricate inspection to cover all transfers of property. Let\r\nno one be deceived into feeling that this is a simple and easy way of\r\nsaddling government expenses upon the rich.\r\n\r\n_Special taxes._—A multitude of minor devices are worthy of brief\r\nconsideration. An occupation tax on business men is easily levied, but\r\nbears unequally upon the original payers, and in the end falls most\r\nheavily upon the poorest. A house tax, measured by the number of rooms, or\r\nthe number of windows, or the number of fireplaces, has been supposed\r\nadjustable to actual income of the possessors. But it bears very heavily\r\nupon men in certain professions requiring house-room, and forces the poor\r\ninto narrow and crowded quarters. The rent of the poor is necessarily a\r\nlarger proportion of their living expenses than that of the well-to-do. It\r\nis a serious hardship when a tax is levied upon that which a man cannot\r\npossibly save.\r\n\r\nA tax upon retail dealers and peddlers is frequently advocated, as tending\r\nto prevent the increase of unnecessary middlemen and wasteful competition.\r\nYet this, too, bears heavily upon the poor, since it crowds out also those\r\nwho are satisfied with small profits and deal in small sales. Even a tax\r\nupon pawnbrokers, whose profits are supposed to be extraordinary, gives\r\noccasion for a sharper grinding of the poor. A study of all these devices\r\nwill lead one to the conclusion that a tax upon property only, based upon\r\na fair valuation and paid by the controller of the property, is fairest to\r\nthe whole community and leads to truest conceptions of the relation of\r\nproperty to public expenditure. It is certainly best for rural welfare.\r\n\r\n_A single land tax._—A brief consideration must be given to a proposed\r\nsystem of taxation, commonly known as the single land tax. The proposition\r\nis to tax all lands, including building sites, to such an extent as may be\r\nnecessary to meet all public expenditures. The lands are to be valued for\r\nthis purpose at the rent they will bring, independent of all improvements.\r\nThe supposition is that such an income is due entirely to the effect of\r\ncrowding population, and therefore belongs to society as a whole rather\r\nthan to the individual possessing it. In fact, if the state were to\r\nconsume the entire economic rent, it would take only, it is said, what\r\nalready belongs to the community. Other supposed advantages of the single\r\ntax system are the reduced expense of assessment and collection, together\r\nwith incidental effects in promoting production by removing burdens from\r\ncapital, in preventing the holding of land unproductive, possibly in\r\nequalizing wealth and diminishing greed for landed property, while the\r\npoorer, cheaper agricultural lands, having no rent value, would be\r\nrelieved of all burden. These are essentially the views maintained by the\r\nfollowers of Henry George, the leading champion of such taxation. It is\r\nclaimed, further, that the poor in crowded cities would be better housed,\r\nsince buildings would bear no taxation, and holders of city lots would\r\nmake them productive through construction of buildings without adding to\r\ntheir burden of taxation. It is claimed also that such taxation would be\r\nfinally distributed, and fairly distributed, among all the consumers of\r\nproducts affected by land possession, as well as all even indirectly\r\nmaking use of the land. Since food and shelter are universal, all would\r\ncontribute, so far as they are self-dependent, according to food consumed\r\nand space occupied.\r\n\r\nThese statements are somewhat inconsistent with each other. If rent is of\r\nsuch a nature, as assumed at the beginning of the argument, that it cannot\r\ndirectly affect all values because it depends upon those values for its\r\nexistence, a tax levied upon it cannot be distributed but rests wholly\r\nupon the landholder. If, on the other hand, a tax on land is distributed\r\namong all consumers of its products, there is no economic rent, but the\r\nburden rests upon the consumers alone, according to the amount consumed,\r\nsubjecting this tax to the objection against all indirect taxes that the\r\npoor bear the heavier burden.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, too, that such a tax must bear heavily upon the unthrifty.\r\nThe valuation of farms must be made by an expert judge of what farms\r\nsimilarly situated ought to produce. A farm valued at $500 annual rent\r\nmight, under thrifty management, produce twice as much as under unthrifty\r\nmanagement. The tax, under thrifty management, could be easily paid; under\r\nunthrifty management, it would ruin the manager. This certainly does not\r\nlevy the tax according to ability. It also bears heavily upon the\r\nenterprising young farmer whose capital is small, as compared with the\r\nlong-established farmer with accumulated capital. The man weak in capital\r\nwould bear as heavy a burden as the strong.\r\n\r\nAgain, it provides no system of taxation in newly settled communities\r\nwhere land has practically no value except from improvements. Unless a\r\nfictitious value be given to such land for purposes of taxation, as\r\nsometimes happens with reference to non-resident land-holders, no\r\ngovernment could be maintained.\r\n\r\nFinally, since under this system government assumes a control over landed\r\nestates, from which it exempts all other forms of property, it tends\r\ntoward the nationalization of land, which would necessarily destroy the\r\nsystem itself. For if government claims all increment from land\r\nproduction, land ceases to be property and does not pass from owner to\r\nowner at a market value: then government fixes arbitrarily the rental of\r\nspace, and taxation is distributed upon a new principle. If a new\r\nprinciple were not to be assumed, there could hardly be a device conceived\r\nmore likely to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. Farmers, of all\r\nmen, are best situated to realize the unequal workings of a single land\r\ntax system.\r\n\r\n_Government debts._—An important part of government machinery is connected\r\nwith its ability to make use of borrowed capital. Under the pressure of\r\nheavy expenditures in case of war, or in undertaking permanent\r\nimprovements in a new country, or in carrying on various enterprises for\r\ncommon welfare, the demand for means is greater than the supply from\r\nordinary modes of taxation. Not even the special devices of war taxes can\r\nmeet at once the burdens of a defensive war. The rightfulness of such\r\nexpenditures upon the credit of the government depends upon the object to\r\nbe secured. The expense of the war which defends and preserves the future\r\nhome of posterity may properly be borne in part, at least, by posterity.\r\nThe court house, the water works, or the electric plant, whose benefits\r\nwill be shared by the people for a hundred years, may properly be so\r\nconstructed that all the people benefited may share in the burden. Good\r\neconomy requires the foresight which builds beyond mere present need. The\r\ndanger is that expenditure made under expectation that others will pay may\r\nbe wasteful, and often other reasons than actual needs in the interest of\r\nprivate speculation control.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is good reason for government debts; and every form of\r\ngovernment, from the loftiest to the most insignificant, finds such\r\nindebtedness easy to contract. The smallest school district can issue\r\nscrip in payment of its teacher, or can issue bonds for the construction\r\nof its school-house. Only the general government, under our laws, can\r\nborrow by issuing due-bills in the form of legal tender notes. All of\r\nthese certificates of indebtedness enter into the general commerce under\r\nthe common law of supply and demand, and bear an economic price\r\nproportional to the certainty of their final payment and the convenience\r\nof their use in commercial transactions. The exemption of national bonds,\r\nor even state bonds, from local taxation works no more hardship than the\r\nexemption of state property. Under ordinary circumstances the entire\r\nadvantage of such exemption is gained by the state, and so by all the\r\ntaxpayers of the state. The exemption of national bonds from every form of\r\ntaxation prohibits interference with the government’s privilege of\r\nborrowing when and where it can, and the advantage comes back to the\r\npeople _in full_ through the low rate of interest or the premium in price\r\nwhich such bonds bear. They are subject to fluctuations in value through\r\ntheir being a means of transferring floating capital between industries.\r\nUnder a stable government, with a somewhat permanent debt, a holder of\r\nbonds is a sort of stockholder in the governmental wealth, with definite\r\nstated dividends rather than profits.\r\n\r\nSuch bonds have various effects upon a general industry of the country.\r\nWhile they lessen somewhat the immediate burdens of present productive\r\nindustries, they may increase the burden of the same industries in a\r\nsecond generation. Their convenience in securing annuities for long series\r\nof years may diminish the enterprise of a community by fostering a class\r\nof non-producers, whose wealth is represented in the display of government\r\nbuildings rather than in productive enterprises. Just so far as government\r\nemploys the capital of the country through bonds, it diminishes the\r\ncapital which would otherwise find investment in productive employment.\r\nThe danger of extravagance to even small communities, from the ease with\r\nwhich such government debts can be contracted, warrants the contrivance of\r\nstrong constitutional limitations. Indeed, provision, not only against\r\nextravagant debt, but for reasonably prompt settlement, may well be\r\nrequired by constitutional law. All property holders, but especially land\r\nholders, are interested in preventing extravagant outlay by means of\r\nbonded indebtedness. Farmers must know that the burden will have to be\r\nborne, with all the natural additions, by the property they hold, and the\r\nvalue of that property will be lessened by whatever extra burden it bears.\r\n\r\n_Settlement of government debts._—The settlement of government debts is a\r\nmatter of uncertain provision. In many instances there has been a tendency\r\ntoward a permanent debt. The United States has shown a surprising capacity\r\nfor making such debts for all sorts of purposes, but has also shown an\r\nequally surprising ability in payment. And yet examples are not wanting,\r\neven in our own country, of a tendency to indefinite postponement and a\r\nrapidly increasing burden, until settlement could be made only by\r\ncompromise or a total repudiation. The effect of such bankruptcy of\r\nnation, state or municipality is like that of any failing enterprise, only\r\nmore widely felt. The repudiation of a government debt affects the capital\r\nof the country like the confiscation of estates under ancient tyranny. It\r\ndestroys the common faith, which is the basis for true productive\r\nindustry. It takes the nation back into the dark ages as regards its\r\nrelation to the individual welfare of citizens. Every economic reason\r\nexisting for the collection of private debts, and leading to government\r\nmachinery for collecting such debts, has still greater force when applied\r\nto the debts of governments. The demoralization, widespread and\r\ndestructive, which follows repudiation, or anything resembling it, cannot\r\nbe outgrown for generations. The most plausible reasons for repudiation,\r\nexcept in cases of absolute fraud against the government, should have no\r\nweight with a citizen who cares for the welfare of his fellow-citizens and\r\ntheir progress toward that welfare, under the natural laws concerning\r\nwealth. A nation of robbers is safer to live in than a robbing nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Rural Welfare, as far at least as it rests upon Wealth,\r\nis to be gained by careful study of laws of nature and human nature quite\r\nindependent of mere wishes. The only way to improve the present situation\r\nof affairs in any community is to use the natural forces within reach to\r\nadvantage. All the growth of the past is preparation for more growth and\r\nbetter fruit in the present and future. The farmer who knows most about\r\nthe fundamental principles of property and property rights in society is\r\nmost likely to best serve his community, as well as himself.\r\n\r\nStill it is equally clear that the chief elements of Rural Welfare are not\r\nmere wealth. Wealth is but the material out of which the external\r\nmachinery of welfare is formed. Every way essential to progress in any\r\ndegree, it does not give the chief test of progress. No one is gaining the\r\nfull use of his wealth until it is well spent for the welfare that is\r\nstrictly personal,—health, wisdom and virtue. No society, however wealthy,\r\nhas reached true welfare till all its members appreciate the higher\r\nwelfare, and make wealth-seeking a means for securing it.\r\n\r\nRural communities can take advantage of many inexpensive ways of adding to\r\ntheir welfare without great wealth. The natural surroundings of the\r\ncountry home give development to ability and courage in children that are\r\nbetter than wealth. The same principles of thrift that are to be\r\ncultivated for the sake of material comforts apply to the larger welfare\r\nthat a wise enjoyment of nature’s gifts and nature’s lessons may bring.\r\nThe thrifty farmer comes nearest of all men to the ideal condition of the\r\nwise man, expressed in the wish, “Give me neither poverty nor riches.” He\r\ncan have enough to comfortably house, clothe and feed his family in the\r\nmidst of surroundings as wholesome as the world affords. He can give his\r\nchildren, by the aid of their healthy bodies and strong hearts, as good\r\nopportunities for education as any can use. He has a natural leisure for\r\nself-culture in the use of papers and books, if he tries to use it, and\r\nhis relations with neighbors of similar abilities are more human, more\r\ntrue, than those found in any other circumstances. If farmers live as they\r\nought, their homes are centers of true hospitality, true sympathy for\r\nhuman rights; and with a little more constant care for neighborly spirit\r\nwould come nearest to giving the true foundation for manly and womanly\r\ncharacter in children, and so in their parents.\r\n\r\nA family of eight children grew up on a farm of little more than one\r\nhundred acres, chopped out of the wilderness. Father and mother worked\r\nhard and strove thriftily to make their children useful. A school was the\r\nfirst requisite, even though it must be taught in the one room that was\r\nkitchen, library and parlor, if not the bedroom, too. The church was\r\nequally important, though it took the choicest lot on the farm for its\r\nlocation. Newspapers and wholesome books were as needful as daily bread.\r\nThe household was a center of cheer and interest for the entire community.\r\nThe first Sunday School and the first Temperance Society of all that new\r\ncountry were organized there. The trend of national life towards higher\r\nideals of justice for all humanity was first recognized there, so that\r\nthree of the four votes cast in that township for the first liberty ticket\r\nwere connected with the same household. The whole world came nearer these\r\nyouth because they learned about it.\r\n\r\nWhen opportunity came for larger growth in college training, all but the\r\noldest boy and the oldest girl sought it eagerly. These made the old\r\nhomestead and a neighboring farm worthy centers of the same true\r\ninfluence. The three sons and the three daughters whose education lifted\r\nthem to a little wider field of influence are all recognized as having\r\nbeen leaders in this country, and their names are cherished by thousands\r\nwho have known their work. The thrift that has made them useful in the\r\ntruest welfare of the world was cultivated and trained on that little\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nThe little farm became itself an evidence of thrift, attractive in its\r\nbeauty as well as in its productiveness. It gave to the father and mother\r\na satisfactory living till both died, the mother at eighty, and the father\r\nat nearly a hundred. Riches they never needed, for they had enough with\r\nthe blessings of children and children’s children scattered through the\r\nworld. The farm is still in the family, doing its good work for the fourth\r\nand fifth generations, in the same wholesome way and with promise of\r\nnever-ending welfare. A little wealth well used means enormous welfare.\r\n\r\nThe farm homes of America will be the seat of America’s welfare if their\r\noccupants know all they can of the thrift that gives power, and do as well\r\nas they know. Farmers who think carefully and earnestly will not expect to\r\noverturn nature as it is, but to use it for all it is worth. This little\r\nbook is intended to help toward such a use of power and wealth as may\r\nbring genuine welfare. Its author hopes in this way to pay in part the\r\ndebt he owes to the little farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbandoned farms, 303.\r\n\r\nAggregation, disadvantages of, 197;\r\n  limit

BAILEY, Professor of\r\nHorticulture in the Cornell University.\r\n\r\n*472 PAGES—125 ILLUSTRATIONS—$2.00*\r\n\r\nIn this entertaining volume, the origin and development of the fruits\r\npeculiar to North America are inquired into, and the personality of those\r\nhorticultural pioneers whose almost forgotten labors have given us our\r\nmost valuable fruits is touched upon. There has been careful research into\r\nthe history of the various fruits, including inspection of the records of\r\nthe great European botanists who have given attention to American economic\r\nbotany. The conclusions reached, the information presented, and the\r\nsuggestions as to future developments, cannot but be valuable to any\r\nthoughtful fruit-grower, while the terse style of the author is at its\r\nbest in his treatment of the subject.\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF OUR NATIVE FRUITS discusses The Rise of the American\r\nGrape (North America a Natural Vineland, Attempts to Cultivate the\r\nEuropean Grape, The Experiments of the Dufours, The Branch of Promise,\r\nJohn Adlum and the Catawba, Rise of Commercial Viticulture, Why Did the\r\nEarly Vine Experiments Fail? Synopsis of the American Grapes); The Strange\r\nHistory of the Mulberries (The Early Silk Industry, The \"Multicaulis\r\nCraze,\"); Evolution of American Plums and Cherries (Native Plums in\r\nGeneral, The Chickasaw, Hortulana, Marianna and Beach Plum Groups, Pacific\r\nCoast Plum, Various Other Types of Plums, Native Cherries, Dwarf Cherry\r\nGroup); Native Apples (Indigenous Species, Amelioration has begun); Origin\r\nof American Raspberry-growing (Early American History, Present Types,\r\nOutlying Types); Evolution of Blackberry and Dewberry Culture (The\r\nHigh-bush Blackberry and Its Kin, The Dewberries, Botanical Names);\r\nVarious Types of Berry-like Fruits (The Gooseberry, Native Currants,\r\nJuneberry, Buffalo Berry, Elderberry, High-bush Cranberry, Cranberry,\r\nStrawberry); Various Types of Tree Fruits (Persimmon, Custard-Apple Tribe,\r\nThorn-Apples, Nut-Fruits); General Remarks on the Improvement of our\r\nNative Fruits (What Has Been Done, What Probably Should Be Done).\r\n\r\nTHE SURVIVAL OF THE UNLIKE:\r\n\r\nA Collection of Evolution Essays Suggested by the Study of Domestic\r\nPlants. By L. H. BAILEY, Professor of Horticulture in the Cornell\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n*THIRD EDITION—515 PAGES—22 ILLUSTRATIONS—$2.00*\r\n\r\nTo those interested in the underlying philosophy of plant life, this\r\nvolume, written in a most entertaining style, and fully illustrated, will\r\nprove welcome. It treats of the modification of plants under cultivation\r\nupon the evolution theory, and its attitude on this interesting subject is\r\ncharacterized by the author’s well-known originality and independence of\r\nthought. Incidentally, there is stated much that will be valuable and\r\nsuggestive to the working horticulturist, as well as to the man or woman\r\nimpelled by a love of nature to horticultural pursuits. It may well be\r\ncalled, indeed, a philosophy of horticulture, in which all interested may\r\nfind inspiration and instruction.\r\n\r\nTHE SURVIVAL OF THE UNLIKE comprises thirty essays touching upon The\r\nGeneral Fact and Philosophy of Evolution (The Plant Individual,\r\nExperimental Evolution, Coxey’s Army and the Russian Thistle, Recent\r\nProgress, etc.); Expounding the Fact and Causes of Variation (The Supposed\r\nCorrelations of Quality in Fruits, Natural History of Synonyms, Reflective\r\nImpressions, Relation of Seed-bearing to Cultivation, Variation after\r\nBirth, Relation between American and Eastern Asian Fruits, Horticultural\r\nGeography, Problems of Climate and Plants, American Fruits,\r\nAcclimatization, Sex in Fruits, Novelties, Promising Varieties, etc.); and\r\nTracing the Evolution of Particular Types of Plants (the Cultivated\r\nStrawberry, Battle of the Plums, Grapes, Progress of the Carnation,\r\nPetunia, The Garden Tomato, etc.).\r\n\r\n*CYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN HORTICULTURE*\r\n\r\n_COMPRISING DIRECTIONS FOR THE CULTIVATION OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS, AND\r\nORIGINAL DESCRIPTIONS OF ALL THE SPECIES OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES, FLOWERS\r\nAND ORNAMENTAL PLANTS KNOWN TO BE IN THE MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES AND\r\nCANADA_\r\n\r\nBY L. H. BAILEY\r\n\r\nASSISTED BY MANY EXPERT CULTIVATORS AND BOTANISTS\r\n\r\nIn Four Quarto Volumes,\r\nIllustrated with over Two Thousand Original Engravings\r\n\r\nThis monumental work, the most comprehensive review of the vegetable world\r\nyet made by an American, is now in the press. Though distinctly an\r\nAmerican work, not only plants indigenous to the North American continent\r\nare mentioned, but also all the species known to be in the horticultural\r\ntrade in North America, of whatever origin. It is really a survey of the\r\ncultivated plants of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Editor, Professor L. H. Bailey, has been gathering material for this\r\nCyclopedia for many years. He has enlisted the coöperation of men of\r\nattainments, either in science or practice everywhere, and the Cyclopedia\r\nhas the unique distinction of presenting for the first time, in a\r\ncarefully arranged and perfectly accessible form, the best knowledge of\r\nthe best specialists in America upon gardening, fruit-growing, vegetable\r\nculture, forestry, and the like, as well as exact botanical information.\r\nIt is all fresh, and not a rehash of old material. No precedent has been\r\nfollowed; the work is upon its own original plan.\r\n\r\nMany scientific botanical authors of justly high repute decline to give\r\nattention to the important characters of _cultivated_ plants, confining\r\ntheir work to the species in the original forms only. Professor Bailey\r\ntakes the view that a subject of commercial importance, one which engages\r\nthe attention and affects the livelihood of thousands of bright people, is\r\ndecidedly worthy the investigation of the trained botanist. In the\r\nCyclopedia of American Horticulture, therefore, very full accounts are\r\ngiven of the botanical features of all important commercial plants, as the\r\napple, cabbage, rose, etc. At the same time, practical cultivators submit\r\nobservations upon culture, marketing, and the like, and frequently two\r\nopinions are presented upon the same subject from different localities, so\r\nthat the reader may have before him not only complete botanical\r\ninformation, but very fully the best practice in the most favorable\r\nlocalities for the perfection of any fruit or vegetable or economic plant.\r\n\r\n*ILLUSTRATIONS*\r\n\r\nThe pictorial character of the work is likewise notable. There are over\r\ntwo thousand illustrations, and they are all made expressly for this work,\r\neither from accurate photographs or from the specimens. These\r\nillustrations have been drawn by competent horticultural artists, in\r\nnearly every case under the eye of the Editor, or with the supervision of\r\nsome one of the sub-editors. No “trade” cuts are used.\r\n\r\nIn planning the illustrations, artistic effect has been kept in view, and\r\nwhile no drawing is used which does not show its subject with perfect\r\nscientific accuracy, the monotonous so-called “botanical” outlines, often\r\nmade from lifeless herbarium specimens, are notably absent. The intention\r\nis to show the life of the plant, not merely its skeleton.\r\n\r\n*CONTRIBUTORS, SYSTEM, ETC.*\r\n\r\nAs above mentioned, the contributors are men eminent as cultivators or as\r\nspecialists on the various subjects. The important articles are signed,\r\nand it is expected that the complete work will include fully 5,000 signed\r\ncontributions by horticulturists, cultivators and botanists.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement is alphabetical as to the genera, but systematic in the\r\nspecies. A very simple but complete plan of key-letters is used, and the\r\nwhole arrangement is toward ease of reference as well as completeness of\r\ninformation. To each large genus there is a separate alphabetic index.\r\n\r\nImportant commercial subjects are treated usually under the best known\r\nname, whether it be the scientific or \"common\" designation. Thus, the\r\napple is fully discussed as apple, rather than as _Pyrus Malus_, and the\r\ncarnation comes into view in the third letter of the alphabet, not as\r\n_Dianthus Caryophyllus_. Carefully edited cross-references make it easy to\r\nfind any desired subject, however, in the shortest time.\r\n\r\nThe plan of presenting the full details of culture of important plants,\r\nthrough the views of acknowledged practical experts upon the various\r\nsubjects, assures the great value of the book to the man or woman who is\r\nobtaining a living from horticultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nA special feature of the Cyclopedia of American Horticulture is its wealth\r\nof bibliographic reference. The world’s horticultural literature has been\r\nthoroughly searched, and most carefully indexed, so that the student will\r\nfind citations to every available article or illustration upon any subject\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\n*DETAILS OF PUBLICATION*\r\n\r\nThe Cyclopedia of American Horticulture is to be completed in four\r\nhandsome quarto volumes, embracing about two thousand pages, with more\r\nthan that number of original illustrations. It is carefully printed upon\r\nspecially made paper of a permanent character. The first volume (A to D,\r\n509 pages, 743 illustrations, 9 plates) is now ready, and the work is\r\nexpected to be completed during the year 1900.\r\n\r\nThe work is sold only by subscription, and orders will be accepted for the\r\nfull set only.

By L. H. BAILEY, Professor of Horticulture in\r\nthe Cornell University, with delineations from nature by W. S. HOLDSWORTH,\r\nof the Agricultural College of Michigan.\r\n\r\n*SECOND EDITION—491 PAGES—446 ILLUSTRATIONS—12 MO—CLOTH—$1.10 NET*\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of looking at nature. The _old way_, which you have\r\nfound so unsatisfactory, was to classify everything—to consider leaves,\r\nroots, and whole plants as formal herbarium specimens, forgetting that\r\neach had its own story of growth and development, struggle and success, to\r\ntell. Nothing stifles a natural love for plants more effectually than the\r\nold way.\r\n\r\nThe new way is to watch the life of every growing thing, to look upon each\r\nplant as a living creature, whose life is a story as fascinating as the\r\nstory of any favorite hero. \"Lessons with Plants\" is a book of stories, or\r\nrather, a book of plays, for we can see each chapter acted out if we take\r\nthe trouble to _look_ at the actors.\r\n\r\n“I have spent some time in most delightful examination of it, and the\r\nlonger I look, the better I like it. I find it not only full of interest,\r\nbut eminently suggestive. I know of no book which begins to do so much to\r\nopen the eyes of the student—whether pupil or teacher—to the wealth of\r\nmeaning contained in simple plant forms. Above all else, it seems to be\r\nfull of suggestions that help one to learn the language of plants, so they\r\nmay talk to him.”—DARWIN L. BARDWELL, _Superintendent of Schools,\r\nBinghamton_.\r\n\r\n“It is an admirable book, and cannot fail both to awaken interest in the\r\nsubject, and to serve as a helpful and reliable guide to young students of\r\nplant life. It will, I think, fill an important place in secondary\r\nschools, and comes at an opportune time, when helps of this kind are\r\nneeded and eagerly sought.”—Professor V. M. SPALDING, _University of\r\nMichigan_.\r\n\r\nFIRST LESSONS WITH PLANTS\r\n\r\nAn Abridgement of the above. 117 pages—116 illustrations—40 cents net.",
