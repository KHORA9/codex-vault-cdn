I shall confine myself merely to the many\r\nextraordinary appearances that have come under my own inspection, and\r\nleave their explanation to the more learned in Natural Philosophy.\r\n\r\nDuring the first twelvemonth of my being here, I did not perceive any\r\nremarkable alteration in the mountain; but I observed, the smoke from\r\nthe Volcano was much more considerable in bad weather than when it was\r\nfair[1]; and I often heard (even at Naples, six miles from Vesuvius) in\r\nbad weather, the inward explosions of the mountain. When I have been at\r\nthe top of Mount Vesuvius in fair weather, I have sometimes found so\r\nlittle smoke, that I have been able to see far down the mouth of the\r\nVolcano; the sides of which were incrusted with salts and mineral of\r\nvarious colors, white, green, deep and pale yellow. The smoke that\r\nissued from the mouth of the Volcano in bad weather was white, very\r\nmoist, and not near so offensive as the sulphureous steams from various\r\ncracks on the sides of the mountain.\r\n\r\nTowards the month of September last, I perceived the smoke to be more\r\nconsiderable, and to continue even in fair weather; and in October I\r\nperceived sometimes a puff of black smoke shoot up a considerable height\r\nin the midst of the white, which symptom of an approaching eruption grew\r\nmore frequent daily; and soon after, these puffs of smoke appeared in\r\nthe night tinged like clouds with the setting sun.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of November, I went up the mountain: it was then\r\ncovered with snow; and I perceived a little hillock of sulphur had been\r\nthrown up, since my last visit there, within about forty yards of the\r\nmouth of the Volcano; it was near six feet high, and a light blue flame\r\nissued constantly from its top. As I was examining this phaenomenon, I\r\nheard a violent report; and saw a column of black smoke, followed by a\r\nreddish flame, shoot up with violence from the mouth of the Volcano; and\r\npresently fell a shower of stones, one of which, falling near me, made\r\nme retire with some precipitation, and also rendered me more cautious of\r\napproaching too near, in my subsequent journies to Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nFrom November to the 28th of March, the date of the beginning of this\r\neruption, the smoke increased, and was mixed with ashes, which fell, and\r\ndid great damage to the vineyards in the neighbourhood of the\r\nmountain[2]. A few days before the eruption I saw (what Pliny the\r\nyounger mentions having seen, before that eruption of Vesuvius which\r\nproved fatal to his uncle) the black smoke take the form of a pine-tree.\r\nThe smoke, that appeared black in the day-time, for near two months\r\nbefore the eruption, had the appearance of flame in the night.\r\n\r\nOn Good Friday, the 28th of March, at 7 o'clock at night, the lava began\r\nto boil over the mouth of the Volcano, at first in one stream; and soon\r\nafter, dividing itself into two, it took its course towards Portici. It\r\nwas preceded by a violent explosion, which caused a partial earthquake\r\nin the neighbourhood of the mountain; and a shower of red hot stones and\r\ncinders were thrown up to a considerable height. Immediately upon sight\r\nof the lava, I left Naples, with a party of my countrymen, whom I found\r\nas impatient as myself to satisfy their curiosity in examining so\r\ncurious an operation of nature. I passed the whole night upon the\r\nmountain; and observed that, though the red hot stones were thrown up in\r\nmuch greater number and to a more considerable height than before the\r\nappearance of the lava, yet the report was much less considerable than\r\nsome days before the eruption. The lava ran near a mile in an hour's\r\ntime, when the two branches joined in a hollow on the side of the\r\nmountain, without proceeding farther. I approached the mouth of the\r\nVolcano, as near as I could with prudence; the lava had the appearance\r\nof a river of red hot and liquid metal, such as we see in the\r\nglass-houses, on which were large floating cinders, half lighted, and\r\nrolling one over another with great precipitation down the side of the\r\nmountain, forming a most beautiful and uncommon cascade; the color of\r\nthe fire was much paler and more bright the first night than the\r\nsubsequent nights, when it became of a deep red, probably owing to its\r\nhaving been more impregnated with sulphur at first than afterwards. In\r\nthe day-time, unless you are quite close, the lava has no appearance of\r\nfire; but a thick white smoke marks its course.\r\n\r\nThe 29th, the mountain was very quiet, and the lava did not continue.\r\nThe 30th, it began to flow again in the same direction, whilst the mouth\r\nof the Volcano threw up every minute a girandole of red hot stones, to\r\nan immense height. The 31st, I passed the night upon the mountain: the\r\nlava was not so considerable as the first night; but the red hot stones\r\nwere perfectly transparent, some of which, I dare say of a ton weight,\r\nmounted at least two hundred feet perpendicular, and fell in, or near,\r\nthe mouth of a little mountain, that was now formed by the quantity of\r\nashes and stones, within the great mouth of the Volcano, and which made\r\nthe approach much safer than it had been some days before, when the\r\nmouth was near half a mile in circumference, and the stones took every\r\ndirection. Mr. Hervey, brother to the Earl of Bristol, was very much\r\nwounded in the arm some days before the eruption, having approached too\r\nnear; and two English gentlemen with him were also hurt. It is\r\nimpossible to describe the beautiful appearance of these girandoles of\r\nred hot stones, far surpassing the most astonishing artificial\r\nfire-work.\r\n\r\nFrom the 31st of March to the 9th of April, the lava continued on the\r\nsame side of the mountain, in two, three, and sometimes four branches,\r\nwithout descending much lower than the first night. I remarked a kind of\r\nintermission in the fever of the mountain[3], which seemed to return\r\nwith violence every other night. On the 10th of April, at night, the\r\nlava disappeared on the side of the mountain towards Naples, and broke\r\nout with much more violence on the side next the _Torre dell'\r\nAnnunciata_.\r\n\r\nI passed the whole day and the night of the twelfth upon the mountain,\r\nand followed the course of the lava to its very source: it burst out of\r\nthe side of the mountain, within about half a mile of the mouth of the\r\nVolcano, like a torrent, attended with violent explosions, which threw\r\nup inflamed matter to a considerable height, the adjacent ground\r\nquivering like the timbers of a water-mill; the heat of the lava was so\r\ngreat, as not to suffer me to approach nearer than within ten feet of\r\nthe stream, and of such a consistency (though it appeared liquid as\r\nwater) as almost to resist the impression of a long stick, with which I\r\nmade the experiment; large stones thrown on it with all my force did not\r\nsink, but, making a slight impression, floated on the surface, and were\r\ncarried out of sight in a short time; for, notwithstanding the\r\nconsistency of the lava, it ran with amazing velocity; I am sure, the\r\nfirst mile with a rapidity equal to that of the river Severn, at the\r\npassage near Bristol. The stream at its source was about ten feet wide,\r\nbut soon extended itself, and divided into three branches; so that these\r\nrivers of fire, communicating their heat to the cinders of former lavas,\r\nbetween one branch and the other, had the appearance at night of a\r\ncontinued sheet of fire, four miles in length, and in some parts near\r\ntwo in breadth. Your Lordship may imagine the glorious appearance of\r\nthis uncommon scene, such as passes all description.\r\n\r\nThe lava, after having run pure for about a hundred yards, began to\r\ncollect cinders, stones, &c.; and a scum was formed on its surface,\r\nwhich in the day-time had the appearance of the river Thames, as I have\r\nseen it after a hard frost and great fall of snow, when beginning to\r\nthaw, carrying down vast masses of snow and ice. In two places the\r\nliquid lava totally disappeared, and ran in a subterraneous passage for\r\nsome paces; then came out again pure, having left the scum behind. In\r\nthis manner it advanced to the cultivated parts of the mountain; and I\r\nsaw it, the same night of the 12th, unmercifully destroy a poor man's\r\nvineyard, and surround his cottage, notwithstanding the opposition of\r\nmany images of St. Januarius, that were placed upon the cottage, and\r\ntied to almost every vine. The lava, at the farthest extremity from its\r\nsource, did not appear liquid, but like a heap of red hot coals,\r\nforming a wall in some places ten or twelve feet high, which rolling\r\nfrom the top soon formed another wall, and so on, advancing slowly, not\r\nmore than about thirty feet in an hour[4].\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Volcano has not thrown up any large stones since the\r\nsecond eruption of lava on the 10th of April; but has thrown up\r\nquantities of small ashes and pumice stones, that have greatly damaged\r\nthe neighbouring vineyards. I have been several times at the mountain\r\nsince the 12th; but, as the eruption was in its greatest vigour at that\r\ntime, I have ventured to dwell on, and I fear tire your Lordship with,\r\nthe observations of that day.\r\n\r\nIn my last visit to Mount Vesuvius, the 3d of June, I still found that\r\nthe lava continued; but the rivers were become rivulets, and had lost\r\nmuch of their rapidity. The quantity of matter thrown out by this\r\neruption is greater than that of the last in the year 1760; but the\r\ndamage to the cultivated lands is not so considerable, owing to its\r\nhaving spread itself much more, and its source being at least three\r\nmiles higher up. This eruption seems now to have exhausted itself; and I\r\nexpect in a few days to see Vesuvius restored to its former\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\nMount Etna in Sicily broke out on the 27th of April; and made a lava, in\r\ntwo branches, at least six miles in length, and a mile in breadth; and,\r\naccording to the description given me by Mr. Wilbraham, (who was there,\r\nafter having seen with me part of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius)\r\nresembles it in every respect, except that Mount Etna, at the place from\r\nwhence the lava flowed (which was twelve miles from the mouth of the\r\nVolcano), threw up a fountain of liquid inflamed matter to a\r\nconsiderable height; which, I am told, Mount Vesuvius has done in former\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nI beg pardon for having taken up so much of your time; and yet I flatter\r\nmyself, that my description, which I assure your Lordship is not\r\nexaggerated, will have afforded you some amusement. I have the honour to\r\nbe,\r\n\r\n                              My LORD,\r\n                              Your Lordship's\r\n                              Most obedient\r\n                              and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n                              WILLIAM HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                              Naples, February 3, 1767.\r\n\r\nSince the account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which I had the\r\nhonour of giving to your Lordship, in my letter of the 10th of June\r\nlast; I have only to add, that the lava continued till about the end of\r\nNovember, without doing any great damage, having taken its course over\r\nantient lavas. Since the cessation of this eruption, I have examined\r\nthe crater, and the crack on the side of the mountain towards _Torre\r\ndell' Annunciata_, about a hundred yards from the crater from whence\r\nthis lava issued: and I found therein some very curious salts and\r\nsulphurs; a specimen of each sort I have put into bottles myself, even\r\nupon the mountain, that they might not lose any of their force, and have\r\nsent them in a box directed to your Lordship, as you will see, by the\r\nbill of lading: I am sure, you will have a pleasure in seeing them\r\nanalyzed[5]. I have also packed in the same box some lava, and cinders,\r\nof the last eruption; there is one piece in particular very curious,\r\nhaving the exact appearance of a cable petrified. I shall be very happy\r\nif these trifles should afford your Lordship a moment's amusement.\r\n\r\nIt is very extraordinary, that I cannot find, that any chemist here has\r\never been at the trouble of analyzing the productions of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nThe deep yellow, or orange-color salts, of which there are two bottles,\r\nI fetched out of the very crater of the mountain, in a crevice that was\r\nindeed very hot. It seems to me to be powerful, as it turns silver black\r\nin an instant, but has no effect upon gold. If your Lordship pleases, I\r\nwill send you by another opportunity specimens of the sulphurs and salts\r\nof the Solfa terra, which seem to be very different from these.\r\n\r\nWithin these three days, the fire has appeared again on the top of\r\nVesuvius, and earthquakes have been felt in the neighbourhood of the\r\nmountain. I was there on Saturday with my nephew Lord Greville; we heard\r\nmost dreadful inward grumblings, rattling of stones, and hissing; and\r\nwere obliged to leave the crater very soon, on account of the emission\r\nof stones. The black smoak arose, as before the last eruption; and I saw\r\nevery symptom of a new eruption, of which I shall not fail to give your\r\nLordship an exact account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\nTo the Right Honourable the Earl of MORTON, President of the Royal\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Naples, December 29, 1767.\r\n\r\nMy LORD,\r\n\r\nThe favourable reception, which my account of last year's eruption of\r\nMount Vesuvius met with from your Lordship; the approbation which the\r\nRoyal Society was pleased to shew, by having ordered the same to be\r\nprinted in their Philosophical Transactions; and your Lordship's\r\ncommands, in your letter of the 3d instant; encourage me to trouble you\r\nwith a plain narrative of what came immediately under my observation,\r\nduring the late violent eruption, which began October 19, 1767, and is\r\nreckoned to be the twenty-seventh since that, which, in the time of\r\nTitus, destroyed Herculaneum and Pompeii.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of 1766 continued in some degree till the 10th of December,\r\nabout nine months in all[6]; yet in that space of time the mountain did\r\nnot cast up a third of the quantity of lava, which it disgorged in only\r\nseven days, the term of this last eruption. On the 15th of December,\r\nlast year, within the ancient crater of Mount Vesuvius, and about twenty\r\nfeet deep, there was a crust, which formed a plain, not unlike the\r\nSolfa terra in miniature; in the midst of this plain was a little\r\nmountain, whose top did not rise so high as the rim of the ancient\r\ncrater. I went into this plain, and up the little mountain, which was\r\nperforated, and served as the principal chimney to the Volcano: when I\r\nthrew down large stones, I could hear that they met with many\r\nobstructions in their way, and could count a hundred moderately before\r\nthey reached the bottom.\r\n\r\nVesuvius was quiet till March 1767, when it began to throw up stones\r\nfrom time to time; in April, the throws were more frequent, and at night\r\nfire was visible on top of the mountain, or, more properly speaking, the\r\nsmoak, which hung over the crater, was tinged by the reflection of the\r\nfire within the Volcano. These repeated throws of cinders, ashes, and\r\npumice stones, increased the little mountain so much, that in May the\r\ntop was visible above the rim of the ancient crater. The 7th of August,\r\nthere issued a small stream of lava, from a breach in the side of this\r\nlittle mountain, which gradually filled the valley between it and the\r\nancient crater; so that, the 12th of September, the lava overflowed the\r\nancient crater, and took its course down the sides of the great\r\nmountain; by this time, the throws were much more frequent, and the red\r\nhot stones went so high as to take up ten seconds in their fall. Padre\r\nTorre, a great observer of Mount Vesuvius, says they went up above a\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe 15th of October, the height of the little mountain (formed in about\r\neight months) was measured by Don Andrea Pigonati, a very ingenious\r\nyoung man, in his Sicilian Majesty's service, who assured me that its\r\nheight was 185 French feet.\r\n\r\nFrom my villa, situated between Herculaneum and Pompeii, near the\r\nconvent of the Calmaldolese (marked 7 in Plate I.) I had watched the\r\ngrowing of this little mountain; and, by taking drawings of it from\r\ntime to time, I could perceive its increase most minutely. I make no\r\ndoubt but that the whole of Mount Vesuvius has been formed in the same\r\nmanner; and as these observations seem to me to account for the various\r\nirregular strata, which are met with in the neighbourhood of Volcanos, I\r\nhave ventured to inclose, for your Lordship's inspection, a copy of the\r\nabovementioned drawings. (Plate III.)\r\n\r\nThe lava continued to run over the ancient crater in small streams,\r\nsometimes on one side, and sometimes on another, till the 18th of\r\nOctober, when I took particular notice that there was not the least lava\r\nto be seen; owing, I imagine, to its being employed in forcing its way\r\ntowards the place where it burst out the following day. As I had,\r\ncontrary to the opinion of most people here, foretold the approaching\r\neruption[7], and had observed a great fermentation in the mountain\r\nafter the heavy rains which fell the 13th and 14th of October; I was not\r\nsurprized, on the 19th following, at seven of the clock in the morning,\r\nto perceive from my villa every symptom of the eruption being just at\r\nhand. From the top of the little mountain issued a thick black smoak, so\r\nthick that it seemed to have difficulty in forcing its way out; cloud\r\nafter cloud mounted with a hasty spiral motion, and every minute a\r\nvolley of great stones were shot up to an immense height in the midst of\r\nthese clouds; by degrees, the smoak took the exact shape of a huge\r\npine-tree, such as Pliny the younger described in his letter to Tacitus,\r\nwhere he gives an account of the fatal eruption in which his uncle\r\nperished[8]. This column of black smoak, after having mounted an\r\nextraordinary height, bent with the wind towards Caprea, and actually\r\nreached over that island, which is not less than twenty-eight miles from\r\nVesuvius.\r\n\r\nI warned my family, not to be alarmed, as I expected there would be an\r\nearthquake at the moment of the lava's bursting out; but before eight of\r\nthe clock in the morning I perceived that the mountain had opened a\r\nmouth, without noise, about a hundred yards lower than the ancient\r\ncrater, on the side towards the Monte di Somma; and I plainly perceived,\r\nby a white smoak, which always accompanies the lava, that it had forced\r\nits way out: as soon as it had vent, the smoak no longer came out with\r\nthat violence from the top. As I imagined that there would be no danger\r\nin approaching the mountain when the lava had vent, I went up\r\nimmediately, accompanied by one peasant only. I passed the hermitage (3.\r\nin Plate I.), and proceeded as far as the spot marked (X), in the valley\r\nbetween the mountain of Somma and that of Vesuvius, which is called\r\nAtrio di Cavallo. I was making my observations upon the lava, which had\r\nalready, from the spot (E) where it first broke out, reached the valley;\r\nwhen, on a sudden, about noon, I heard a violent noise within the\r\nmountain, and at the spot (C), about a quarter of a mile off the place\r\nwhere I stood, the mountain split; and, with much noise, from this new\r\nmouth, a fountain of liquid fire shot up many feet high, and then, like\r\na torrent, rolled on directly towards us. The earth shook, at the same\r\ntime that a volley of pumice stones fell thick upon us; in an instant,\r\nclouds of black smoak and ashes caused almost a total darkness; the\r\nexplosions from the top of the mountain were much louder than any\r\nthunder I ever heard, and the smell of the sulphur was very offensive.\r\nMy guide, alarmed, took to his heels; and I must confess, that I was not\r\nat my ease. I followed close, and we ran near three miles without\r\nstopping; as the earth continued to shake under our feet, I was\r\napprehensive of the opening of a fresh mouth, which might have cut off\r\nour retreat. I also feared that the violent explosions would detach some\r\nof the rocks off the mountain Somma, under which we were obliged to\r\npass; besides, the pumice-stones, falling upon us like hail, were of\r\nsuch a size as to cause a disagreeable sensation upon the part where\r\nthey fell. After having taken breath, as the earth still trembled\r\ngreatly, I thought it most prudent to leave the mountain, and return to\r\nmy villa; where I found my family in a great alarm, at the continual and\r\nviolent explosions of the Volcano, which shook our house to its very\r\nfoundation, the doors and windows swinging upon their hinges. About two\r\nof the clock in the afternoon another lava forced its way out of the\r\nsame place from whence came the lava last year, at the spot marked B (in\r\nPlate II.); so that the conflagration was soon as great on this side of\r\nthe mountain, as on the other which I had just left.\r\n\r\nThe noise and smell of sulphur increasing, we removed from our villa to\r\nNaples; and I thought proper, as I passed by Portici, to inform the\r\nCourt of what I had seen; and humbly offered it as my opinion, that his\r\nSicilian Majesty should leave the neighbourhood of the threatening\r\nmountain. However, the Court did not leave Portici till about twelve of\r\nthe clock, when the lava had reached as far as (4. in Plate I.)--I\r\nobserved, in my way to Naples, which was in less than two hours after I\r\nhad left the mountain, that the lava had actually covered three miles of\r\nthe very road through which we had retreated. It is astonishing that it\r\nshould have run so fast; as I have since seen, that the river of lava,\r\nin the Atrio di Cavallo, was sixty and seventy feet deep, and in some\r\nplaces near two miles broad. When his Sicilian Majesty quitted Portici,\r\nthe noise was greatly increased; and the concussion of the air from the\r\nexplosions was so violent, that, in the King's palace, doors and windows\r\nwere forced open; and even one door there, which was locked, was\r\nnevertheless burst open. At Naples, the same night, many windows and\r\ndoors flew open; in my house, which is not on the side of the town next\r\nVesuvius, I tried the experiment of unbolting my windows[9], when they\r\nflew wide open upon every explosion of the mountain. Besides these\r\nexplosions, which were very frequent, there was a continued\r\nsubterraneous and violent rumbling noise, which lasted this night about\r\nfive hours. I have imagined, that this extraordinary noise might be\r\nowing to the lava in the bowels of the mountain having met with a\r\ndeposition of rain water; and that the conflict between the fire and the\r\nwater may, in some measure, account for so extraordinary a crackling and\r\nhissing noise. Padre Torre, who has wrote so much and so well upon the\r\nsubject of Mount Vesuvius, is also of my opinion. And indeed it is\r\nnatural to imagine, that there may be rain-water lodged in many of the\r\ncaverns of the mountain; as, in the great eruption of Mount Vesuvius in\r\n1631, it is well attested, that several towns, among which Portici and\r\nTorre del Greco, were destroyed, by a torrent of boiling water having\r\nburst out of the mountain with the lava, by which thousands of lives\r\nwere lost. About four years ago, Mount Etna in Sicily threw up hot water\r\nalso, during an eruption.\r\n\r\nThe confusion at Naples this night cannot be described; his Sicilian\r\nMajesty's hasty retreat from Portici added to the alarm; all the\r\nchurches were opened and filled; the streets were thronged with\r\nprocessions of saints: but I shall avoid entering upon a description of\r\nthe various ceremonies that were performed in this capital, to quell the\r\nfury of the turbulent mountain.\r\n\r\nTuesday the 20th, it was impossible to judge of the situation of\r\nVesuvius, on account of the smoak and ashes, which covered it entirely,\r\nand spread over Naples also, the sun appearing as through a thick London\r\nfog, or a smoaked glass; small ashes fell all this day at Naples. The\r\nlavas on both sides of the mountain ran violently; but there was little\r\nor no noise till about nine o'clock at night, when the same uncommon\r\nrumbling began again, accompanied with explosions as before, which\r\nlasted about four hours: it seemed as if the mountain would split in\r\npieces; and, indeed, it opened this night almost from the spot E to C\r\n(in Plate I.). The annexed plans were taken upon the spot at this time,\r\nwhen the lavas were at their height; and I do not think them\r\nexaggerated. The Parisian barometer was, as yesterday, at 279, and\r\nFahrenheit's thermometer at 70 degrees; whereas, for some days preceding\r\nthe eruption, it had been at 65 and 66. During the confusion of this\r\nnight, the prisoners in the public jail attempted to escape, having\r\nwounded the jailer; but were prevented by the troops. The mob also set\r\nfire to the Cardinal Archbishop's gate, because he refused to bring out\r\nthe relicks of Saint Januarius.\r\n\r\nWednesday 21st, was more quiet than the preceding days, though the lavas\r\nran briskly. Portici was once in some danger, had not the lava taken a\r\ndifferent course when it was only a mile and a half from it; towards\r\nnight, the lava slackened.\r\n\r\nThursday 22d, about ten of the clock in the morning, the same thundering\r\nnoise began again, but with more violence than the preceding days; the\r\noldest men declared, they had never heard the like; and, indeed, it was\r\nvery alarming: we were in expectation every moment of some dire\r\ncalamity. The ashes, or rather small cinders, showered down so fast,\r\nthat the people in the streets were obliged to use umbrellas, or flap\r\ntheir hats; these ashes being very offensive to the eyes. The tops of\r\nthe houses, and the balconies, were covered above an inch thick with\r\nthese cinders[10]. Ships at sea, twenty leagues from Naples, were also\r\ncovered with them, to the great astonishment of the sailors. In the\r\nmidst of these horrors, the mob, growing tumultuous and impatient,\r\nobliged the Cardinal to bring out the head of Saint Januarius, and go\r\nwith it in procession to the Ponte Maddalena, at the extremity of\r\nNaples, towards Vesuvius; and it is well attested here, that the\r\neruption ceased the moment the Saint came in sight of the mountain; it\r\nis true, the noise ceased about that time, after having lasted five\r\nhours, as it had done the preceding days.\r\n\r\nFriday 23d, the lavas still ran, and the mountain continued to throw up\r\nquantities of stones from its crater; there was no noise heard at Naples\r\nthis day, and but little ashes fell there.\r\n\r\nSaturday 24th, the lava ceased running; the extent of the lava, from\r\nthe spot C (Plate I.), where I saw it break out, to its extremity F,\r\nwhere it surrounded the chapel of Saint Vito, is above six miles. In the\r\nAtrio di Cavallo, and in a deep valley that lies between Vesuvius (1.)\r\nand the hermitage (3.), the lava is in some places near two miles broad,\r\nand in most places from sixty to seventy feet deep; at (4.), the lava\r\nran down a hollow way, called Fossa grande, made by the currents of rain\r\nwater; it is not less than two hundred feet deep, and a hundred broad;\r\nyet the lava in one place has filled it up. I could not have believed\r\nthat so great a quantity of matter could have been thrown out in so\r\nshort a time, if I had not since examined the whole course of the lava\r\nmyself. This great compact body will certainly retain some heat many\r\nmonths[11]; at this time, much rain having fallen for some days past,\r\nthe lava smoaks, as if it ran afresh: and about ten days ago, when I was\r\nup the mountain with Lord Stormont, we thrust sticks into the crevices\r\nof the lava, which took fire immediately: But to proceed with my\r\njournal.\r\n\r\nThe 24th, Vesuvius continued to throw up stones as on the preceding\r\ndays: during the whole of this eruption, it had differed in this\r\ncircumstance from the eruption of 1766, when no stones were thrown out\r\nof the crater from the moment the lava ran freely.\r\n\r\nSunday 25th, small ashes fell all day at Naples; they issued from the\r\ncrater of the Volcano, and formed a vast column, as black as the\r\nmountain itself, so that the shadow of it was marked out on the surface\r\nof the sea; continual flashes of forked or zig-zag lightning shot from\r\nthis black column, the thunder of which was heard in the neighbourhood\r\nof the mountain, but not at Naples: there were no clouds in the sky at\r\nthis time, except those of smoak issuing from the crater of Vesuvius. I\r\nwas much pleased with this phaenomenon, which I had not seen before in\r\nthat perfection[12].\r\n\r\nMonday 26th, the smoak continued, but not so thick, neither were there\r\nany flashes of the mountain lightning. As no lava has appeared after\r\nthis column of black smoak, which must have been occasioned by some\r\ninward operation of fire; I am apt to think, that the lava, which should\r\nnaturally have followed this symptom, has broke its way into some deeper\r\ncavern, where it is silently brooding future mischief; and I shall be\r\nmuch mistaken if it does not break out a few months hence.\r\n\r\nTuesday 27th, no more black smoak, nor any signs of eruption.\r\n\r\nThus, my Lord, I have had the honor of giving your Lordship a faithful\r\nnarrative of my observations during this eruption, which is universally\r\nallowed to have been the most violent of this century; and I shall be\r\nhappy, if it should meet with your approbation, and that of the Royal\r\nSociety, if your Lordship should think it worthy of being communicated\r\nto so respectable a body.\r\n\r\nI have just sent a present to the British Museum of a complete\r\ncollection of every sort of matter produced by Mount Vesuvius, which I\r\nhave been collecting with some pains for these three years past; and it\r\nwill be a great satisfaction to me, if, by the means of this collection,\r\nsome of my countrymen, learned in natural history, may be enabled to\r\nmake some useful discoveries relative to Volcanos[13].\r\n\r\nI have also accompanied that collection with a view of a current of\r\nlava from Mount Vesuvius; it is painted with transparent colours, and,\r\nwhen lighted up with lamps behind it, gives a much better idea of\r\nVesuvius, than is possible to be given by any other sort of painting.\r\n\r\n                              I have the honor to be,\r\n                              My LORD,\r\n                              Your Lordship's\r\n                              Most obedient\r\n                              and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n                              WILLIAM HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate I._\r\nView of the GREAT ERUPTION of VESUVIUS 1767 from Portici.]\r\n\r\nPLATE I.\r\n\r\n   A.

D. Secretary to the Royal SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Villa Angelica, near Mount Vesuvius,\r\n                              October 4, 1768.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have but very lately received your last obliging letter, of the 5th of\r\nJuly, with the volume of Philosophical Transactions.\r\n\r\nI must beg of you to express my satisfaction at the notice which the\r\nRoyal Society hath been pleased to take of my accounts of the two last\r\neruptions of Mount Vesuvius. Since I have been at my villa here, I have\r\nenquired of the inhabitants of the mountain, after what they had seen\r\nduring the last eruption. In my letter to Lord Morton, I mentioned\r\nnothing but what came immediately under my own observation: but as all\r\nthe peasants here agree in their account of the terrible thunder and\r\nlightning, which lasted almost the whole time of the eruption, upon the\r\nmountain only; I think it a circumstance worth attending to. Besides the\r\nlightning, which perfectly resembled the common forked lightning, there\r\nwere many meteors, like what are vulgarly called _falling stars_. A\r\npeasant, in my neighbourhood, lost eight hogs, by the ashes falling into\r\nthe trough with their food: they grew giddy, and died in a few hours.\r\nThe last day of the eruption, the ashes, which fell abundantly upon the\r\nmountain, were as white almost as snow[14]; and the old people here\r\nassure me, that is a sure symptom of the eruption being at an end.\r\nThese circumstances, being well attested, I thought worth relating.\r\n\r\nIt would require many years close application, to give a proper and\r\ntruly philosophical account of the Volcanos in the neighbourhood of\r\nNaples; but I am sure such a history might be given, supported by\r\ndemonstration, as would destroy every system hitherto given upon this\r\nsubject. We have here an opportunity of seeing Volcanos in all their\r\nstates. I have been this summer in the island of Ischia; it is about\r\neighteen miles round, and its whole basis is lava. The great mountain in\r\nit, near as high as Vesuvius, formerly called Epomeus, and now San\r\nNicolo, I am convinced, was thrown up by degrees; and I have no doubt\r\nin my own mind, but that the island itself rose out of the sea in the\r\nsame manner as some of the Azores. I am of the same opinion with respect\r\nto Mount Vesuvius, and all the high grounds near Naples; as having not\r\nyet seen, in any one place, what can be called virgin earth. I had the\r\npleasure of seeing a well sunk, a few days ago, near my villa, which is,\r\nas you know, at the foot of Vesuvius, and close by the sea-side. At\r\ntwenty-five feet below the level of the sea, they came to a stratum of\r\nlava, and God knows how much deeper they might have still found other\r\nlavas. The soil all round the mountain, which is so fertile, consists of\r\nstratas of lavas, ashes, pumice, and now-and-then a thin stratum of good\r\nearth, which good earth is produced by the surface mouldering, and the\r\nrotting of the roots of plants, vines, &c. This is plainly to be seen at\r\nPompeii, where they are now digging into the ruins of that ancient city;\r\nthe houses are covered about ten or fifteen feet, with pumice and\r\nfragments of lava, some of which weigh three pounds (which last\r\ncircumstance I mention, to shew, that, in a great eruption, Vesuvius has\r\nthrown stones of this weight six miles[15], which is its distance from\r\nPompeii, in a direct line); upon this stratum of pumice, or _rapilli_,\r\nas they call them here, is a stratum of excellent mould, about two feet\r\nthick, on which grow large trees, and excellent grapes. We have then the\r\nSolfaterra, which was certainly a Volcano, and has ceased erupting, for\r\nwant of metallic particles, and over-abounding with sulphur. You may\r\ntrace its lavas into the sea. We have the Lago d'Averno and the Lago\r\nd'Agnano, both of which were formerly Volcanos; and Astroni, which still\r\nretains its form more than any of these. Its crater is walled round, and\r\nhis Sicilian Majesty takes the diversion of boar-hunting in this\r\nVolcano; and neither his Majesty nor any one of his Court ever dreamt of\r\nits former state. We have then that curious mountain, called Montagno\r\nNuovo, near Puzzole, which rose, in one night, out of the Lucrine Lake;\r\nit is about a hundred and fifty feet high, and three miles round. I do\r\nnot think it more extraordinary, that Mount Vesuvius, in many ages,\r\nshould rise above two thousand feet; when this mountain, as is well\r\nattested, rose in one night, no longer ago than the year 1538. I have a\r\nproject, next spring, of passing some days at Puzzole, and of dissecting\r\nthis mountain, taking its measures, and making drawings of its stratas;\r\nfor, I perceive, it is composed of stratas, like Mount Vesuvius, but\r\nwithout lavas. As this mountain is so undoubtedly formed intirely from a\r\nplain, I should think my project may give light into the formation of\r\nmany other mountains, that are at present thought to have been original,\r\nand are certainly not so, if their strata correspond with those of the\r\nMontagno Nuovo. I should be glad to know whether you think this project\r\nof mine will be useful; and, if you do, the result of my observations\r\nmay be the subject of another letter[16].\r\n\r\nI cannot have a greater pleasure than to employ my leisure hours in what\r\nmay be of some little use to mankind; and my lot has carried me into a\r\ncountry, which affords an ample field for observation. Upon the whole,\r\nif I was to establish a system, it would be, that _Mountains are\r\nproduced by Volcanos, and not Volcanos by Mountains_.\r\n\r\nI fear I have tired you; but the subject of Volcanos is so favourite a\r\none with me, that it has led me on I know not how: I shall only add,\r\nthat Vesuvius is quiet at present, though very hot at top, where there\r\nis a deposition of boiling sulphur. The lava that ran in the Fossa\r\nGrande during the last eruption, and is at least two hundred feet thick,\r\nis not yet cool; a stick, put into its crevices, takes fire immediately.\r\nOn the sides of the crevices are fine crystalline salts: as they are the\r\npure salts, which exhale from the lava that has no communication with\r\nthe interiour of the mountain, they may perhaps indicate the composition\r\nof the lava.\r\n\r\nI have done. Let me only thank you for the kind offers and expressions\r\nin your letter, and for the care you have had in setting off my present\r\nto the Museum to the best advantage; of which I have been told from many\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n                              I am,\r\n                              SIR,\r\n                              Your most obedient\r\n                              humble servant,\r\n\r\n                              W. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.\r\n\r\nTo MATHEW MATY, M. D. Secretary to the Royal SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nAn Account of a Journey to MOUNT ETNA.\r\n\r\n    \"Artificis naturae ingens opus aspice, nulla\r\n    \"Tu tanta humanis rebus spectacula cernes.\"\r\n\r\n                              P. CORNELII SEVERI _AEtna_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Naples, Oct. 17, 1769.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the assurances you give me, in your last obliging letter\r\nof the 15th of June, that any new communication upon the subject of\r\nVolcano's would be received with satisfaction by the Royal Society; I\r\nventure to send you the following account of my late observations upon\r\nMount Etna, which you are at liberty to lay before our respectable\r\nSociety, should you think it worth its notice. [See Plate IV.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate IV._\r\nA View of MOUNT AETNA from Taormina.]\r\n\r\nAfter having examined with much attention the operations of Mount\r\nVesuvius, during the five years that I have had the honour of residing\r\nas his Majesty's Minister at this Court, and after having carefully\r\nremarked the nature of the soil for fifteen miles round this capital; I\r\nam, in my own mind, well convinced that the whole of it has been formed\r\nby explosion. Many of the craters, from whence this matter has issued,\r\nare still visible; such as the Solfaterra near Puzzole, the lake of\r\nAgnano, and near this lake a mountain composed of burnt matter, that has\r\na very large crater surrounded with a wall, to inclose the wild boars\r\nand deer, that are kept there for the diversion of his Sicilian Majesty;\r\nit is called Astruni: the Monte Nuovo, thrown up from the bottom of the\r\nLucrine lake[17] in the year 1538, which has likewise its crater; and\r\nthe lake of Averno. The islands of Nisida and Procida are entirely\r\ncomposed of burnt matter; the island of Ischia is likewise composed of\r\nlava, pumice, and burnt matter; and there are in that island several\r\nvisible craters, from one of which, no longer ago than the year 1303,\r\nthere issued a lava, which ran into the sea, and is still in the same\r\nbarren state as the modern lavas of Vesuvius. After having, I say, been\r\naccustomed to these observations, I was well prepared to visit the most\r\nancient, and perhaps the most considerable, Volcano that exists; and I\r\nhad the satisfaction of being thoroughly convinced there, of the\r\nformation of very considerable mountains by meer explosion, having seen\r\nmany such on the sides of Etna, as will be related hereafter.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June last, in the afternoon, I left Catania, a town\r\nsituated at the foot of Mount Etna, or, as it is now called,\r\nMon-Gibello, in company with Lord Fortrose and the Canonico Recupero, an\r\ningenious priest of Catania, who is the only person there that is\r\nacquainted with the mountain: he is actually employed in writing its\r\nnatural history; but, I fear, will not be able to compass so great and\r\nuseful an undertaking, for want of proper encouragement.\r\n\r\nWe passed through the inferior district of the mountain, called by its\r\ninhabitants La Regione Piemontese. It is well watered, exceedingly\r\nfertile, and abounding with vines and other fruit trees, where the lava,\r\nor, as it is called there, the _sciara_, has had time to soften, and\r\ngather soil sufficient for vegetation, which, I am convinced from many\r\nobservations, unless assisted by art, does not come to pass for many\r\nages[18], perhaps a thousand years or more; the circuit of this lower\r\nregion, forming the basis of the great Volcano, is upwards of one\r\nhundred Italian miles. The vines of Etna are kept low, quite the reverse\r\nof those on the borders of Vesuvius; and they produce a stronger wine,\r\nbut not in so great abundance. The Piemontese district is covered with\r\ntowns, villages, monasteries, &c. and is well peopled, notwithstanding\r\nthe danger of such a situation. Catania, so often destroyed by eruptions\r\nof Etna, and totally overthrown by an earthquake towards the end of the\r\nlast century[19], has been re-built within these fifty years, and is now\r\na considerable town, with at least thirty-five thousand inhabitants. I\r\ndo not wonder at the seeming security with which these parts are\r\ninhabited, having been so long witness to the same near Mount Vesuvius.\r\nThe operations of Nature are slow: great eruptions do not frequently\r\nhappen; each flatters himself it will not happen in his time, or, if it\r\nshould, that his tutelar saint will turn away the destructive lava from\r\nhis grounds; and indeed the great fertility in the neighbourhoods of\r\nVolcanos tempts people to inhabit them.\r\n\r\nIn about four hours of gradual ascent, we arrived at a little convent of\r\nBenedictine monks, called St. Nicolo dell' Arena, about thirteen miles\r\nfrom Catania, and within a mile of the Volcano from whence issued the\r\nlast very great eruption in the year 1669; a circumstantial account of\r\nwhich was sent to our court by a Lord Winchelsea, who happened to be\r\nthen at Catania in his way home, from his embassy at Constantinople. His\r\nLordship's account is curious, and was printed in London soon after; I\r\nsaw a copy of it at Palermo, in the library of the Prince\r\nTorremuzzo[20]. We slept in the Benedictines convent the night of the\r\n24th, and passed the next morning in observing the ravage made by the\r\nabovementioned terrible eruption, over the rich country of the\r\nPiemontese. The lava burst out of a vineyard within a mile of St.\r\nNicolo, and, by frequent explosions of stones and ashes, raised there a\r\nmountain, which, as near as I can judge, having ascended it, is not less\r\nthan half a mile perpendicular in height, and is certainly at least\r\nthree miles in circumference at its basis. The lava that ran from it,\r\nand on which there are as yet no signs of vegetation, is fourteen miles\r\nin length, and in many parts six in breadth; it reached Catania, and\r\ndestroyed part of its walls, buried an amphitheatre, an aqueduct, and\r\nmany other monuments of its ancient grandeur, which till then had\r\nresisted the hand of Time, and ran a considerable length into the sea,\r\nso as to have once formed a beautiful and safe harbour; but it was soon\r\nafter filled up by a fresh torrent of the same inflamed matter: a\r\ncircumstance the Catanians lament to this day, as they are without a\r\nport. There has been no such eruption since, though there are signs of\r\nmany, more terrible, that have preceded it.\r\n\r\nFor two or three miles round the mountain raised by this eruption, all\r\nis barren, and covered with ashes; this ground, as well as the mountain\r\nitself, will in time certainly be as fertile as many other mountains in\r\nits neighbourhood, that have been likewise formed by explosion. If the\r\ndates of these explosions could be ascertained, it would be very\r\ncurious, and mark the progress of time with respect to the return of\r\nvegetation, as the mountains raised by them are in different states;\r\nthose which I imagine to be the most modern are covered with ashes only;\r\nothers of an older date, with small plants and herbs; and the most\r\nancient, with the largest timber-trees I ever saw: but I believe the\r\nlatter are so very ancient, as to be far out of the reach of history. At\r\nthe foot of the mountain, raised by the eruption of the year 1669, there\r\nis a hole, through which, by means of a rope, we descended into several\r\nsubterraneous caverns, branching out and extending much farther and\r\ndeeper than we chose to venture; the cold there being excessive, and a\r\nviolent wind frequently extinguishing some of our torches. These caverns\r\nundoubtedly contained the lava that issued forth, and extended, as I\r\nsaid before, quite to Catania. There are many of these subterraneous\r\ncavities known, on other parts of Etna; such as that called by the\r\npeasants La Baracca Vecchia, another La Spelonca della Palomba (from the\r\nwild pigeons building their nests therein), and the cavern Thalia,\r\nmentioned by Boccaccio. Some of them are made use of as magazines for\r\nsnow; the whole island of Sicily and Malta being supplied with this\r\nessential article (in a hot climate) from Mount Etna. Many more would be\r\nfound, I dare say, if searched for, particularly near and under the\r\ncraters from whence great lavas have issued, as the immense quantities\r\nof such matter we see above ground, must necessarily suppose very great\r\nhollows underneath.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed the morning of the 25th in these observations, we\r\nproceeded through the second or middle region of Etna, called La\r\nSelvosa, _the woody_, than which nothing can be more beautiful. On every\r\nside are mountains, or fragments of mountains, that have been thrown up\r\nby various ancient explosions; there are some near as high as Mount\r\nVesuvius; one in particular (as the Canon our guide assured me, having\r\nmeasured it) is little less than one mile in perpendicular height, and\r\nfive in circumference at its basis. They are all more or less covered,\r\neven within their craters, as well as the rich vallies between them,\r\nwith the largest oak, chesnut, and firr trees, I ever saw any where; and\r\nindeed it is from hence chiefly, that his Sicilian Majesty's dockyards\r\nare supplied with timber. As this part of Etna was famous for its timber\r\nin the time of the Tyrants of Syracusa, and as it requires the great\r\nlength of time I have already mentioned before the matter is fit for\r\nvegetation, we may conceive the great age of this respectable Volcano.\r\nThe chesnut-trees predominated in the parts through which we passed,\r\nand, though of a very great size, are not to be compared to some on\r\nanother part of the Regione Selvosa, called Carpinetto. I have been told\r\nby many, and particularly by our guide, who had measured the largest\r\nthere, called La Castagna Cento Cavalli, that it is upwards of\r\ntwenty-eight Neapolitan canes in circumference. Now as a Neapolitan cane\r\nis two yards and half a quarter, English measure, you may judge, Sir, of\r\nthe immense size of this famous tree[21]. It is hollow from age, but\r\nthere is another near it almost as large and sound. As it would have\r\nrequired a journey of two days to have visited this extraordinary tree,\r\nand the weather being already very hot, I did not see it. It is amazing\r\nto me, that trees should flourish in so shallow a soil; for they cannot\r\npenetrate deep without meeting with a rock of lava; and indeed great\r\npart of the roots of the large trees we passed by are above ground, and\r\nhave acquired, by the impression of the air, a bark like that of their\r\nbranches. In this part of the mountain, are the finest horned cattle in\r\nSicily; we remarked in general, that the horns of the Sicilian cattle\r\nare near twice the size of any we had ever seen; the cattle themselves\r\nare of the common size. We passed by the lava of the last eruption in\r\nthe year 1766, which has destroyed above four miles square of the\r\nbeautiful wood abovementioned. The mountain raised by this eruption\r\nabounds with sulphur and salts, exactly resembling those of Vesuvius;\r\nspecimens of which I sent some time ago to the late Lord Morton.\r\n\r\nIn about five hours from the time we had left the convent of St. Nicolo\r\ndell' Arena, we arrived at the borders of the third region, called La\r\nNetta, or Scoperta, _clean_ or _uncovered_, where we found a very sharp\r\nair indeed; so that, in the same day, the four seasons of the year were\r\nsensibly felt by us, on this mountain; excessive summer heats in the\r\nPiemontese, spring and autumn temperature in the middle, and extreme\r\ncold of winter in the upper region. I could perceive, as we approached\r\nthe latter, a gradual decrease of vegetation; and from large timber\r\ntrees we came to the small shrubs and plants of the northern climates: I\r\nobserved quantities of juniper and tanzey; our guide told us that later\r\nin the season there are numberless curious plants here, and that in some\r\nparts there are rhubarb and saffron in plenty. In Carrera's History of\r\nCatania, there is a list of all the plants and herbs of Etna in\r\nalphabetical order.\r\n\r\nNight coming on, we here pitched a tent, and made a good fire, which was\r\nvery necessary; for without it, and very warm cloathing, we should\r\nsurely have perished with cold; and at one of the clock in the morning\r\nof the 26th, we pursued our journey towards the great crater. We passed\r\nover vallies of snow, that never melts, except there is an eruption of\r\nlava from the upper crater, which scarcely ever happens; the great\r\neruptions are usually from the middle region, the inflamed matter\r\nfinding (as I suppose) its passage through some weak part, long before\r\nit can rise to the excessive height of the upper region, the great mouth\r\non the summit only serving as a common chimney to the Volcano. In many\r\nplaces the snow is covered with a bed of ashes, thrown out of the\r\ncrater, and the sun melting it in some parts makes this ground\r\ntreacherous; but as we had with us, besides our guide, a peasant well\r\naccustomed to these vallies, we arrived safe at the foot of the little\r\nmountain of ashes that crowns Etna, about an hour before the rising of\r\nthe sun. This mountain is situated in a gently inclining plain of about\r\nnine miles in circumference; it is about a quarter of a mile\r\nperpendicular in height, very steep, but not quite so steep as Vesuvius;\r\nit has been thrown up within these twenty-five or thirty years, as many\r\npeople at Catania have told me they remembered when there was only a\r\nlarge chasm or crater, in the midst of the abovementioned plain. Till\r\nnow, the ascent had been so gradual (for the top of Etna is not less\r\nthan thirty miles from Catania, from whence the ascent begins) as not to\r\nhave been the least fatiguing; and if it had not been for the snow, we\r\nmight have rode upon our mules to the very foot of the little mountain,\r\nhigher than which the Canon our guide had never been: but as I saw that\r\nthis little mountain was composed in the same manner as the top of\r\nVesuvius, which, notwithstanding the smoak issuing from every pore, is\r\nsolid and firm, I made no scruple of going up to the edge of the crater;\r\nand my companions followed. The steep ascent, the keenness of the air,\r\nthe vapours of the sulphur, and the violence of the wind, which obliged\r\nus several times to throw ourselves flat upon our faces to avoid being\r\noverturned by it, made this latter part of our expedition rather\r\ninconvenient and disagreeable. Our guide, by way of comfort, assured us,\r\nthat there was generally much more wind in the upper region at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSoon after we had seated ourselves on the highest point of Etna, the sun\r\narose, and displayed a scene that indeed passes all description. The\r\nhorizon lighting up by degrees, we discovered the greatest part of\r\nCalabria, and the sea on the other side of it; the Phare of Messina, the\r\nLipari Islands; Stromboli, with its smoaking top, though at above\r\nseventy miles distance, seemed to be just under our feet; we saw the\r\nwhole island of Sicily, its rivers, towns, harbours, &c. as if we had\r\nbeen looking on a map. The island of Malta is low ground, and there was\r\na haziness in that part of the horizon, so that we could not discern\r\nit; our guide assured us, he had seen it distinctly at other times,\r\nwhich I can believe, as in other parts of the horizon, that were not\r\nhazy, we saw to a much greater distance; besides, we had a clear view of\r\nEtna's top from our ship, as we were going into the mouth of the harbour\r\nof Malta some weeks before; in short, as I have since measured on a good\r\nchart, we took in at one view a circle of above nine hundred English\r\nmiles. The pyramidal shadow of the mountain reached across the whole\r\nisland, and far into the sea on the other side. I counted from hence\r\nforty-four little mountains (little I call them in comparison of their\r\nmother Etna, though they would appear great any where else) in the\r\nmiddle region on the Catania side, and many others on the other side of\r\nthe mountain, all of a conical form, and each having its crater; many\r\nwith timber trees flourishing both within and without their craters.\r\nThe points of those mountains that I imagine to be the most ancient are\r\nblunted, and the craters of course more extensive and less deep than\r\nthose of the mountains formed by explosions of a later date, and which\r\npreserve their pyramidal form entire. Some have been so far mouldered\r\ndown by time, as to have no other appearance of a crater than a sort of\r\ndimple or hollow on their rounded tops, others with only half or a third\r\npart of their cone standing; the parts that are wanting having mouldered\r\ndown, or perhaps been detached from them by earthquakes, which are here\r\nvery frequent. All however have been evidently raised by explosion; and\r\nI believe, upon examination, many of the whimsical shapes of mountains\r\nin other parts of the world would prove to have been occasioned by the\r\nsame natural operations. I observed that these mountains were generally\r\nin lines or ridges; they have mostly a fracture on one side, the same as\r\nin the little mountains raised by explosion on the sides of Vesuvius,\r\nof which there are eight or nine. This fracture is occasioned by the\r\nlava's forcing its way out, which operation I have described in my\r\naccount of the last eruption of Vesuvius. Whenever I shall meet with a\r\nmountain, in any part of the world, whose form is regularly conical,\r\nwith a hollow crater on its top, and one side broken, I shall be apt to\r\ndecide such a mountain's having been formed by an eruption; as both on\r\nEtna and Vesuvius the mountains formed by explosion are without\r\nexception according to this description. But to return to my narrative.\r\n\r\nAfter having feasted our eyes with the glorious prospect above-mentioned\r\n(for which, as Spartian tells us, the Emperor Adrian was at the trouble\r\nof ascending Etna), we looked into the great crater, which, as near as\r\nwe could judge, is about two miles and a half in circumference; we did\r\nnot think it safe to go round and measure it, as some parts seemed to\r\nbe very tender ground. The inside of the crater, which is incrusted with\r\nsalts and sulphurs like that of Vesuvius, is in the form of an inverted\r\nhollow cone, and its depth nearly answers to the height of the little\r\nmountain that crowns the great Volcano. The smoak, issuing abundantly\r\nfrom the sides and bottom, prevented our seeing quite down; but the wind\r\nclearing away the smoak from time to time, I saw this inverted cone\r\ncontracted almost to a point; and, from repeated observations, I dare\r\nsay, that in all Volcanos, the depth of the craters will be found to\r\ncorrespond nearly to the height of the conical mountains of cinders\r\nwhich usually crown them; in short, I look upon the craters as a sort of\r\nsuspended funnels, under which are vast caverns and abysses. The\r\nformation of such conical mountains with their craters are easily\r\naccounted for, by the fall of the stones, cinders, and ashes, emitted at\r\nthe time of an eruption.\r\n\r\nThe smoak of Etna, though very sulphureous, did not appear to me so\r\nfetid and disagreeable as that of Vesuvius; but our guide told me, that\r\nits quality varies, as I know that of Vesuvius does, according to the\r\nquality of the matter then in motion within. The air was so very pure\r\nand keen in the whole upper region of Etna, and particularly in the most\r\nelevated parts of it, that we had a difficulty in respiration, and that,\r\nindependent of the sulphureous vapour. I brought two barometers and a\r\nthermometer with me from Naples, intending to have left one with a\r\nperson at the foot of the mountain, whilst we made our observation with\r\nthe other, at sun-rising, on the summit; but one barometer was unluckily\r\nspoilt at sea, and I could find no one expert enough at Catania to\r\nrepair it: what is extraordinary, I do not recollect having seen a\r\nbarometer in any part of Sicily. At the foot of Etna, the 24th, when we\r\nmade our first observation, the quicksilver stood at 27 degrees 4\r\nlines; and the 26th, at the most elevated point of the Volcano, it was\r\nat 18 degrees 10 lines. The thermometer, on the first observation at the\r\nfoot of the mountain was at 84 degrees, and on the second at the crater\r\nat 56[22]. The weather had not changed in any respect, and was equally\r\nfine and clear, the 24th and 26th. We found it difficult to manage our\r\nbarometer in the extreme cold and high wind on the top of Etna; but,\r\nfrom the most exact observations we could make in our circumstances, the\r\nresult was as abovementioned. The Canon assured me, that the\r\nperpendicular height of Mount Etna is something more than three Italian\r\nmiles, and I verily believe it is so.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed at least three hours on the crater, we descended,\r\nand went to a rising ground, about a mile distant from the upper\r\nmountain we had just left, and saw there some remains of the foundation\r\nof an ancient building; it is of brick, and seems to have been\r\nornamented with white marble, many fragments of which are scattered\r\nabout. It is called the Philosopher's Tower, and is said to have been\r\ninhabited by Empedocles. As the ancients used to sacrifice to the\r\ncelestial gods on the top of Etna[23], it may very well be the ruin of a\r\ntemple that served for that purpose. From hence we went a little further\r\nover the inclined plain abovementioned, and saw the evident marks of a\r\ndreadful torrent of hot water, that came out of the great crater at the\r\ntime of an eruption of lava in the year 1755, and upon which phaenomenon\r\nthe Canonico Recupero, our guide, has published a dissertation. Luckily\r\nthis torrent did not take its course over the inhabited parts of the\r\nmountain; as a like accident on Mount Vesuvius in 1631 swept away some\r\ntowns and villages in its neighbourhood, with thousands of their\r\ninhabitants. The common received opinion is, that these eruptions of\r\nwater proceed from the Volcanos having a communication with the sea; but\r\nI rather believe them to proceed merely from depositions of rain water\r\nin some of the inward cavities of them. We likewise saw from hence the\r\nwhole course of ancient lava, the most considerable as to its extent of\r\nany known here; it ran into the sea near Taormina, which is not less\r\nthan thirty miles from the crater whence it issued, and is in many parts\r\nfifteen miles in breadth. As the lavas of Etna are very commonly fifteen\r\nand twenty miles in length, six or seven in breadth, and fifty feet or\r\nmore in depth; you may judge, Sir, of the prodigious quantities of\r\nmatter emitted in a great eruption of this mountain, and of the vast\r\ncavities there must necessarily be within its bowels. The most extensive\r\nlavas of Vesuvius do not exceed seven miles in length. The operations of\r\nnature on the one mountain and the other are certainly the same; but on\r\nMount Etna, all are upon a great scale. As to the nature and quality of\r\ntheir lavas, they are much the same; but I think those of Etna rather\r\nblacker, and in general more porous, than those of Vesuvius. In the\r\nparts of Etna that we went over, I saw no stratas of pumice stones,\r\nwhich are frequent near Vesuvius, and cover the ancient city of Pompeii;\r\nbut our guide told us, that there are such in other parts of the\r\nmountain. I saw some stratas of what is called here _tufa_; it is the\r\nsame that covers Herculaneum, and that composes most of the high grounds\r\nabout Naples; it is, upon examination, a mixture of small pumice stones,\r\nashes, and fragments of lava, which is by time hardened into a sort of\r\nstone[24]. In short, I found, with respect to the matter erupted,\r\nnothing on Mount Etna that Vesuvius does not produce; and there\r\ncertainly is a much greater variety in the erupted matter and lavas of\r\nthe latter, than of the former; both abound with pyrites and\r\ncrystallizations, or rather vitrifications. The sea shore at the foot of\r\nEtna, indeed, abounds with amber, of which there is none found at the\r\nfoot of Vesuvius. At present there is a much greater quantity of sulphur\r\nand salts on the top of Vesuvius than on that of Etna; but this\r\ncircumstance varies according to the degree of fermentation within; and\r\nour guide assured me, he had seen greater quantities on Etna at other\r\ntimes. In our way back to Catania, the Canon shewed me a little hill,\r\ncovered with vines, which belonged to the Jesuits, and, as is well\r\nattested, was undermined by the lava in the year 1669, and transported\r\nhalf a mile from the place where it stood, without having damaged the\r\nvines.\r\n\r\nIn great eruptions of Etna, the same sort of lightning, as described in\r\nmy account of the last eruption of Vesuvius, has been frequently seen to\r\nissue from the smoak of its great crater. The antients took notice of\r\nthe same phaenomenon; for Seneca (lib. ii. Nat. Quaest.) says,--\"AEtna\r\naliquando multo igne abundavit, ingentem vim arenae urentis effudit,\r\ninvolutus est dies pulvere, populosque subita nox terruit, _illo tempore\r\naiunt plurima fuisse tonitrua et fulmina_.\"\r\n\r\nTill the year 252 of Christ, the chronological accounts of the eruptions\r\nof Etna are very imperfect: but as the veil of St. Agatha was in that\r\nyear first opposed to check the violence of the torrents of lava, and\r\nhas ever since been produced at the time of great eruptions; the\r\nmiracles attributed to its influence, having been carefully recorded by\r\nthe priests, have at least preserved the dates of such eruptions. The\r\nrelicks of St. Januarius have rendered the same service to the lovers of\r\nnatural history, by recording the great eruptions of Vesuvius. I find,\r\nby the dates of the eruptions of Etna, that it is as irregular and\r\nuncertain in its operations as Vesuvius[25]. The last eruption was in\r\n1766.\r\n\r\nOn our return from Messina to Naples, we were becalmed three days in the\r\nmidst of the Lipari islands, by which we had an opportunity of seeing\r\nthat they have all been evidently formed by explosion[26]; one of them,\r\ncalled Vulcano, is in the same state as the Solfaterra. Stromboli is a\r\nVolcano, existing in all its force, and, in its form of course, is the\r\nmost pyramidal of all the Lipari Islands; we saw it throw up red hot\r\nstones from its crater frequently, and some small streams of lava issued\r\nfrom its side, and ran into the sea[27]. This Volcano differs from Etna\r\nand Vesuvius, by its continually emitting fire, and seldom any lava;\r\nnotwithstanding its continual explosions, this island is inhabited, on\r\none side, by about an hundred families.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate V._\r\nSTROMBOLI, one of the LIPARI ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nThese, as well as I can recollect, are all the observations that I made\r\nwith respect to Volcanos, in may late curious tour of Sicily; and I\r\nshall be very happy should the communication of them afford you, or any\r\nof our countrymen (lovers of natural history) satisfaction or\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n                              I am,\r\n                              SIR,\r\n                              With great regard and esteem,\r\n                              Your most obedient\r\n                              humble servant,\r\n\r\n                              W. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\nTo MATHEW MATY, M. D. Secretary to the Royal SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nREMARKS upon the NATURE of the SOIL of NAPLES, and its Neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n  \"Mille miracula movet saciemque mutat locis, et defert montes,\r\n  subrigit plana, valles extuberat novas, in profundo insulas\r\n  eregit.\"\r\n\r\n                              SENECA, De Terra-motu.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Naples, Oct. 16, 1770.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nAccording to your desire, I lose no time in sending you such further\r\nremarks as I have been making with some diligence, for six years past,\r\nin the compass of twenty miles, or more, round this capital. By\r\naccompanying these remarks with a map of the country I describe [Plate\r\nVI.], and with the specimens of different matters that compose the most\r\nremarkable spots of it, I do not doubt but that I shall convince you, as\r\nI am myself convinced, that the whole circuit (so far as I have\r\nexamined) within the boundaries marked in the map is wholly and totally\r\nthe production of subterraneous fires; and that most probably the sea\r\nformerly reached the mountains that lie behind Capua and Caserta, and\r\nare a continuation of the Appenines. If I may be allowed to compare\r\nsmall things with great, I imagine the subterraneous fires to have\r\nworked in this country, under the bottom of the sea, as moles in a\r\nfield, throwing up here and there a hillock; and that the matter thrown\r\nout of some of these hillocks, formed into settled Volcanos, filling up\r\nthe space between one and the other, has composed this part of the\r\ncontinent, and many of the islands adjoining.\r\n\r\nFrom the observations I have made upon Mount Etna, Vesuvius, and its\r\nneighbourhood, I dare say, that, after a careful examination, most\r\nmountains, that are or have been Volcanos, would be found to owe their\r\nexistence to subterraneous fire; the direct reverse of what I find the\r\ncommonly received opinion.\r\n\r\nNature, though varied, is certainly in general uniform in her\r\noperations; and I cannot conceive that two such considerable Volcanos as\r\nEtna and Vesuvius should have been formed otherwise than every other\r\nconsiderable Volcano of the known world. I do not wonder that so little\r\nprogress has been made in the improvement of natural history, and\r\nparticularly in that branch of it which regards the theory of earth;\r\nNature acts slowly, it is difficult to catch her in the fact. Those who\r\nhave made this subject their study have, without scruple, undertaken at\r\nonce to write the natural history of a whole province, or of an entire\r\ncontinent; not reflecting, that the longest life of man scarcely\r\naffords him time to give a perfect one of the smallest insect.\r\n\r\nI am sensible of what I undertake in giving you, Sir, even a very\r\nimperfect account of the nature of the soil of a little more than twenty\r\nmiles round Naples: yet I flatter myself that my remarks, such as they\r\nare, may be of some use to any one hereafter, who may have leisure and\r\ninclination to follow them up. The kingdom of the Two Sicilies offers\r\ncertainly the fairest field for observations of this kind, of any in the\r\nwhole world; here are Volcanos existing in their full force, some on\r\ntheir decline, and others totally extinct.\r\n\r\nTo begin with some degree of order, which is really difficult in the\r\nvariety of matter that occurs to my mind, I will first mention the basis\r\non which I found all my conjectures. It is the nature of the soil that\r\ncovers the antient towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii, and the interior\r\nand exterior form of the new mountain, near Puzzole, with the sort of\r\nmaterials of which it is composed. It cannot be denied, that Herculaneum\r\nand Pompeii stood once above ground; though now, the former is in no\r\npart less than seventy feet, and in some parts one hundred and twelve\r\nfeet, below the present surface of the earth; and the latter is buried\r\nten or twelve feet deep, more or less. As we know from the very accurate\r\naccount given by Pliny the younger to Tacitus, and from the accounts of\r\nother contemporary authors, that these towns were buried by an eruption\r\nof Mount Vesuvius in the time of Titus; it must be allowed, that\r\nwhatever matter lies between these cities and the present surface of the\r\nearth over them, must have been produced since the year 79 of the\r\nChristian aera, the date of that formidable eruption.\r\n\r\nPompeii, which is situated at a much greater distance from the Volcano\r\nthan Herculaneum, has felt the effects of a single eruption only; it is\r\ncovered with white pumice stones, mixed with fragments of lava and\r\nburnt matter, large and small: the pumice is very light; but I have\r\nfound some of the fragments of lava and cinders there, weighing eight\r\npounds. I have often wondered, that such weighty bodies could have been\r\ncarried to such a distance (for Pompeii cannot be less than five miles,\r\nin a strait line, from the mouth of Vesuvius). Every observation\r\nconfirms the fall of this horrid shower over the unfortunate city of\r\nPompeii, and that few of its inhabitants had dared to venture out of\r\ntheir houses; for in many of those which have been already cleared,\r\nskeletons have been found, some with gold rings, ear rings, and\r\nbracelets. I have been present at the discovery of several human\r\nskeletons myself; and under a vaulted arch, about two years ago, at\r\nPompeii, I saw the bones of a man and a horse taken up, with the\r\nfragments of the horse's furniture, which had been ornamented with false\r\ngems set in bronze. The skulls of some of the skeletons found in the\r\nstreets had been evidently fractured by the fall of the stones. His\r\nSicilian Majesty's excavations are confined to this spot at present; and\r\nthe curious in antiquity may expect hereafter, from so rich a mine,\r\nample matter for their dissertations: but I will confine myself to such\r\nobservations only as relate to my present subject.\r\n\r\nOver the stratum of pumice and burnt matter that covers Pompeii, there\r\nis a stratum of good mould, of the thickness of about two feet and more\r\nin some parts, in which vines flourish, except in some particular spots\r\nof this vineyard, where they are subject to be blasted by a foul vapour,\r\nor _mofete_, as it is called here, that rises from beneath the burnt\r\nmatter. The abovementioned shower of pumice stones, according to my\r\nobservations, extended beyond Castel-a-mare (near which spot the ancient\r\ntown of Stabia also lies buried under them) and covered a tract of\r\ncountry not less than thirty miles in circumference. It was at Stabia\r\nthat Pliny the elder lost his life, and this shower of pumice stones is\r\nwell described in the younger Pliny's letter. Little of the matter that\r\nhas issued from Vesuvius since that time, has reached these parts: but I\r\nmust observe, that the pavement of the streets of Pompeii is of lava;\r\nnay, under the foundation of the town, there is a deep stratum of lava\r\nand burnt matter. These circumstances, with many others that will be\r\nrelated hereafter, prove, beyond a doubt, that there have been eruptions\r\nof Vesuvius previous to that of the year 79, which is the first recorded\r\nby history.\r\n\r\nThe growth of soil by time is easily accounted for; and who, that has\r\nvisited ruins of ancient edifices, has not often seen a flourishing\r\nshrub, in a good soil, upon the top of an old wall? I have remarked many\r\nsuch on the most considerable ruins at Rome and elsewhere. But from the\r\nsoil which has grown over the barren pumice that covers Pompeii, I was\r\nenabled to make a curious observation. Upon examining the cuts and\r\nhollow ways made by currents of water in the neighbourhood of Vesuvius\r\nand of other Volcanos, I had remarked that there lay frequently a\r\nstratum of rich soil, of more or less depth, between the matter produced\r\nby the explosion of succeeding eruptions[28]; and I was naturally led to\r\nthink, that such a stratum had grown in the same manner as the one\r\nabovementioned over the pumice of Pompeii. Where the stratum of good\r\nsoil was thick, it was evident to me that many years had elapsed between\r\none eruption and that which succeeded it. I do not pretend to say, that\r\na just estimate can be formed of the great age of Volcanos from this\r\nobservation; but some sort of calculation might be made: for instance,\r\nshould an explosion of pumice cover again the spot under which Pompeii\r\nis buried, the stratum of rich soil abovementioned would certainly lie\r\nbetween two beds of pumice; and if a like accident had happened a\r\nthousand years ago, the stratum of rich soil would as certainly have\r\nwanted much of its present thickness, as the rotting of vegetables,\r\nmanure, &c. is ever increasing a cultivated soil. Whenever I find then a\r\nsuccession of different strata of pumice and burnt matter, like that\r\nwhich covers Pompeii, intermixed with strata of rich soil, of greater or\r\nless depth, I hope I may be allowed reasonably to conclude, that the\r\nwhole has been the production of a long series of eruptions, occasioned\r\nby subterraneous fire. By the size and weight of the pumice, and\r\nfragments of burnt erupted matter in these strata, it is easy to trace\r\nthem up to their source, which I have done more than once in the\r\nneighbourhood of Puzzole, where explosions have been frequent. The\r\ngradual decrease in the size and quantity of the erupted matter in the\r\nstratum abovementioned, from Pompeii to Castle-a-Mare, is very visible:\r\nat Pompeii, as I said before, I have found them of eight pounds weight,\r\nwhen at Castle-a-Mare the largest do not weigh an ounce.\r\n\r\nThe matter which covers the ancient town of Herculaneum is not the\r\nproduce of one eruption only; for there are evident marks that the\r\nmatter of six eruptions has taken its course over that which lies\r\nimmediately above the town, and was the cause of its destruction. These\r\nstrata are either of lava or burnt matter, with veins of good soil\r\nbetween them. The stratum of erupted matter that immediately covers the\r\ntown, and with which the theatre and most of the houses were filled, is\r\nnot of that foul vitrified matter, called lava, but of a sort of soft\r\nstone, composed of pumice, ashes, and burnt matter. It is exactly of\r\nthe same nature with what is called here the Naples stone; the Italians\r\ndistinguish it by the name of _tufa_, and it is in general use for\r\nbuilding. Its colour is usually that of our free stone, but sometimes\r\ntinged with grey, green, and yellow; and the pumice stones, with which\r\nit ever abounds, are sometimes large, and sometimes small: it varies\r\nlikewise in its degree of solidity.\r\n\r\nThe chief article in the composition of _tufa_ seems to me to be, that\r\nfine burnt material, which is called _puzzolane_, whose binding quality\r\nand utility by way of cement are mentioned by Vitruvius[29], and which\r\nis to be met with only in countries that have been subject to\r\nsubterraneous fires. It is, I believe, a sort of lime prepared by\r\nnature. This, mixed with water, great or small pumice stones, fragments\r\nof lava, and burnt matter, may naturally be supposed to harden into a\r\nstone of this kind[30]; and, as water frequently attends eruptions of\r\nfire, as will be seen in the accounts I shall give of the formation of\r\nthe new mountain near Puzzole, I am convinced the first matter that\r\nissued from Vesuvius, and covered Herculaneum, was in the state of\r\nliquid mud. A circumstance strongly favouring my opinion is, that, about\r\ntwo years ago, I saw the head of an antique statue dug out of this\r\nmatter within the theatre of Herculaneum; the impression of its face\r\nremains to this day in the _tufa_, and might serve as a mould for a cast\r\nin plaister of Paris, being as perfect as any mould I ever saw. As much\r\nmay be inferred from the exact resemblance of this matter, or _tufa_,\r\nwhich immediately covers Herculaneum, to all the _tufas_ of which the\r\nhigh grounds of Naples and its neighbourhood are composed. I detached a\r\npiece of it sticking to, and incorporated with, the painted stucco of\r\nthe inside of the theatre of Herculaneum, and shall send it for your\r\ninspection[31]. It is very different, as you will see, from the\r\nvitrified matter called lava, by which it has been generally thought\r\nthat Herculaneum was destroyed. The village of Resina and some villas\r\nstand at present above this unfortunate town.\r\n\r\nTo account for the very great difference of the matters that cover\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii, I have often thought that, in the eruption of\r\n79, the mountain must have been open in more than one place. A passage\r\nin Pliny's letter to Tacitus seems to say as much: \"Interim e Vesuvio\r\nmonte pluribus locis latissimae flammae, atque incendia relucebant, quorum\r\nfulgor et claritas tenebras noctis pellebat:\" so that very probably the\r\nmatter that covers Pompeii proceeded from a mouth, or crater, much\r\nnearer to it than is the great mouth of the Volcano, from whence came\r\nthe matter that covers Herculaneum. This matter might nevertheless be\r\nsaid to have proceeded from Vesuvius, just as the eruption in the year\r\n1760, which was quite independent of the great crater (being four miles\r\nfrom it), is properly called an eruption of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of eruptions, Volcanos frequently throw up water mixed\r\nwith the ashes. Vesuvius did so in the eruption of 1631, according to\r\nthe testimony of many contemporary writers. The same circumstance\r\nhappened in 1669, according to the account of Ignazzio Sorrentino, who,\r\nby his history of Mount Vesuvius, printed at Naples in 1734, has shewn\r\nhimself to have been a very accurate observer of the phaenomena of the\r\nVolcano, for many years that he lived at Torre del Greco, situated at\r\nthe foot of it. At the beginning of the formation of the new mountain,\r\nnear Puzzole, water was mixed with the ashes thrown up, as will be seen\r\nin two very curious and particular accounts of the formation of that\r\nmountain, which I shall have the pleasure of communicating to you\r\npresently; and in 1755, Etna threw up a quantity of water in the\r\nbeginning of an eruption, as is mentioned in the letter I sent you last\r\nyear upon the subject of that magnificent Volcano[32]. Ulloa likewise\r\nmentions this circumstance of water attending the eruptions of Volcanos\r\nin America. Whenever therefore I find a _tufa_ composed exactly like\r\nthat which immediately covers Herculaneum, and undoubtedly proceeded\r\nfrom Vesuvius, I conclude such a _tufa_ to have been produced by water\r\nmixing with the erupted matter at the time of an explosion occasioned by\r\nsubterraneous fire; and this observation, I believe, will be of more use\r\nthan any other, in pointing out those parts of the present _terra\r\nfirma_, that have been formed by explosion. I am convinced, it has often\r\nhappened that subterraneous fires and exhalations, after having been\r\npent up and confined for some time, and been the cause of earthquakes,\r\nhave forced their passage, and in venting themselves formed mountains of\r\nthe matter that confined them, as you will see was the case near\r\nPuzzole in the year 1538, and by evident signs has been so before, in\r\nmany parts of the neighbourhood of Puzzole; without creating a regular\r\nVolcano. The materials of such mountains will have but little appearance\r\nof having been produced by fire, to any one unaccustomed to make\r\nobservations upon the different nature of Volcanos.\r\n\r\nIf it were allowed to make a comparison between the earth and a human\r\nbody, one might consider a country replete with combustibles occasioning\r\nexplosions (which is surely the case here) to be like a body full of\r\nhumours. When these humours concentre in one part, and form a great\r\ntumour out of which they are discharged freely, the body is less\r\nagitated; but when, by any accident, the humours are checked, and do not\r\nfind free passage through their usual channel, the body is agitated, and\r\ntumours appear in other parts of that body, but soon after the humours\r\nreturn again to their former channel. In a similar manner one may\r\nconceive Vesuvius to be the present great channel, through which nature\r\ndischarges some of the foul humours of the earth: when these humours are\r\nchecked by any accident or stoppage in this channel for any considerable\r\ntime, earthquakes will be frequent in its neighbourhood, and explosions\r\nmay be apprehended even at some distance from it. This was the case in\r\nthe year 1538, Vesuvius having been quiet for near 400 years. There was\r\nno eruption from its great crater, from the year 1139 to the great\r\neruption of 1631, and the top of the mountain began to lose all signs of\r\nfire. As it is not foreign to my purpose, and will serve to shew how\r\ngreatly they are mistaken, who place the seat of the fire in the centre,\r\nor towards the top, of a Volcano; I will give you a curious description\r\nof the state of the crater of Vesuvius, after having been free from\r\neruption 492 years, as related by Bracini, who descended into it not\r\nlong before the eruption of 1631: \"The crater was five miles in\r\ncircumference, and about a thousand paces deep; its sides were covered\r\nwith brush wood, and at the bottom there was a plain on which cattle\r\ngrazed. In the woody parts, boars frequently harboured; in the midst of\r\nthe plain, within the crater, was a narrow passage, through which, by a\r\nwinding path, you could descend about a mile amongst rocks and stones,\r\ntill you came to another more spacious plain covered with ashes: in this\r\nplain were three little pools, placed in a triangular form, one towards\r\nthe East, of hot water, corrosive and bitter beyond measure; another\r\ntowards the West, of water salter than that of the sea; the third of hot\r\nwater, that had no particular taste.\"\r\n\r\nThe great increase of the cone of Vesuvius, from that time to this,\r\nnaturally induces one to conclude, that the whole of the cone was raised\r\nin the like manner; and that the part of Vesuvius, called Somma, which\r\nis now considered as a distinct mountain from it, was composed in the\r\nsame manner. This may plainly be perceived, by examining its interior\r\nand exterior form, and the strata of lava and burnt matter of which it\r\nis composed. The ancients, in describing Vesuvius, never mention two\r\nmountains. Strabo, Dio, Vitruvius, all agree, that Vesuvius, in their\r\ntime, shewed signs of having formerly erupted[33], and the first\r\ncompares the crater on its top to an amphitheatre. The mountain now\r\ncalled Somma was, I believe, that which the ancients called Vesuvius:\r\nits outside form is conical; its inside, instead of an amphitheatre, is\r\nnow like a great theatre. I suppose the eruption in Pliny's time to have\r\nthrown down that part of the cone next the sea, which would naturally\r\nhave left it in its present state; and that the conical mountain, or\r\nexisting Vesuvius, has been raised by the succeeding eruptions: all my\r\nobservations confirm this opinion. I have seen antient lavas in the\r\nplain on the other side of Somma, which could never have proceeded from\r\nthe present Vesuvius. Serao, a celebrated physician now living at\r\nNaples, in the introduction of his account of the eruption of Vesuvius\r\nin 1737 (in which account many of the phaenomena of the Volcano are\r\nrecorded and very well accounted for), says, that at the convent of\r\nDominican Fryars, called the Madona del Arco, some years ago, in sinking\r\na well, at a hundred feet depth, a lava was discovered, and soon after\r\nanother; so that, in less than three hundred feet depth, the lavas of\r\nfour eruptions were found. From the situation of this convent, it is\r\nclear beyond a doubt, that these lavas proceeded from the mountain\r\ncalled Somma, as they are quite out of the reach of the existing\r\nVolcano.\r\n\r\nFrom these circumstances, and from repeated observations I have made in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Vesuvius, I am sure that no virgin soil is to be\r\nfound there, and that all is composed of different strata of erupted\r\nmatter, even to a great depth below the level of the sea. In short, I\r\nhave not any doubt in my own mind, but that this Volcano took its rise\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea; and as the whole plain between Vesuvius and\r\nthe mountains behind Caserta, which is the best part of the Campagna\r\nFelice, is (under its good soil) composed of burnt matter, I imagine the\r\nsea to have washed the feet of those mountains, until the subterraneous\r\nfires began to operate, at a period certainly of a most remote\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nThe soil of the Campagna Felice is very fertile; I saw the earth opened\r\nin many places last year in the midst of that plain, when they were\r\nseeking for materials to mend the road from Naples to Caserta. The\r\nstratum of good soil was in general four or five feet thick; under which\r\nwas a deep stratum of cinders, pumice, fragments of lava, and such burnt\r\nmatter as abounds near Vesuvius and all Volcanos. The mountains at the\r\nback of Caserta are mostly of a sort of lime-stone, and very different\r\nfrom those formed by fire; though Signior Van Vitelli, the celebrated\r\narchitect, has assured me, that, in the cutting of the famous aqueduct\r\nof Caserta through these mountains, he met with some soils, that had\r\nbeen evidently formed by subterraneous fire. The high grounds, which\r\nextend from Castel-a-Mare, to the point of Minerva towards the island of\r\nCaprea, and from the promontory that divides the bay of Naples from that\r\nof Salerno, are of lime-stone. The plain of Sorrento, that is bounded by\r\nthese high grounds, beginning at the village of Vico, and ending at that\r\nof Massa, is wholly composed of the same sort of _tufa_ as that about\r\nNaples, except that the cinders or pumice stones intermixed in it are\r\nlarger than in the Naples _tufa_. I conceive then that there has been an\r\nexplosion in this spot from the bottom of the sea. This plain, as I have\r\nremarked to be the case with all soils produced by subterraneous fire,\r\nis extremely fertile; whilst the ground about it, being of another\r\nnature, is not so. The island of Caprea does not shew any signs of\r\nhaving been formed by subterraneous fire; but is of the same nature as\r\nthe high grounds last mentioned, from which it has been probably\r\ndetached by earthquakes, or the violence of the waves. Rovigliano, an\r\nisland, or rather a rock, in the bay of Castel-a-Mare, is likewise of\r\nlime-stone, and seems to have belonged to the original mountains in its\r\nneighbourhood: in some of these mountains there are also petrified fish\r\nand fossil shells, which I never have found in the mountains which I\r\nsuppose to have been formed by explosion[34].\r\n\r\nYou have now, Sir, before you the nature of the soil, from Caprea to\r\nNaples. The soil on which this great metropolis stands has been\r\nevidently produced by explosions, some of which seem to have been upon\r\nthe very spot on which this city is built; all the high grounds round\r\nNaples, Pausilipo, Puzzole, Baia, Misenum, the islands of Procita and\r\nIschia, appear to have been raised by explosion. You can trace still in\r\nmany of these heights the conical shape that was naturally given them at\r\nfirst, and even the craters out of which the matter issued, though to be\r\nsure others of these heights have suffered such changes by the hand of\r\ntime, that you can only conjecture that they were raised in the like\r\nmanner, by their composition being exactly the same as that of those\r\nmountains which still retain their conical form and craters entire. A\r\n_tufa_, exactly resembling the specimen I took from the inside of the\r\ntheatre of Herculaneum, layers of pumice intermixed with layers of good\r\nsoil, just like those over Pompeii, and lavas like those of Vesuvius,\r\ncompose the whole soil of the country that remains to be described.\r\n\r\nThe famous grotto anciently cut through the mountain of Pausilipo, to\r\nmake a road from Naples to Puzzole, gives you an opportunity of seeing\r\nthat the whole of that mountain is _tufa_. The first evident crater you\r\nmeet with, after you have passed the grotto of Pausilipo, is now the\r\nlake of Agnano; a small remain of the subterraneous fire (which must\r\nprobably have made the bason for the lake, and raised the high grounds\r\nwhich form a sort of amphitheatre round it) serves to heat rooms, which\r\nthe Neapolitans make great use of in summer, for carrying off diverse\r\ndisorders, by a strong perspiration. This place is called the Sudatorio\r\ndi San Germano; near the present bagnios, which are but poor little\r\nhovels, there are the ruins of a magnificent ancient bath. About an\r\nhundred paces from hence is the Grotto del Cane; I shall only mention,\r\nas a further proof of the probability that the lake of Agnano was a\r\nVolcano, that vapours of a pernicious quality, as that in the Grotto\r\ndel Cane, are frequently met with in the neighbourhood of Etna and\r\nVesuvius, particularly at the time of, before, and after, great\r\neruptions. The noxious vapour having continued in the same force\r\nconstantly so many ages, as it has done in the Grotto del Cane (for\r\nPliny mentions this Grotto[35]), is indeed a circumstance in which it\r\ndiffers from the vapours near Vesuvius and Etna, which are not constant.\r\nThe cone forming the outside of this supposed Volcano is still perfect\r\nin many parts.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the Grotto del Cane, and immediately joining to the lake,\r\nrises the mountain called Astruni, which, having, as I imagine, been\r\nthrown up by an explosion of a much later date, retains the conical\r\nshape and every symptom of a Volcano in much greater perfection than\r\nthat I have been describing. The crater of Astruni is surrounded with a\r\nwall, to confine boars and deers (this Volcano having been for many\r\nyears converted to a royal chace). It may be about six miles or more in\r\ncircumference: in the plain at the bottom of the crater are two lakes;\r\nand in some books there is mention made of a hot spring, which I never\r\nhave been able to find. There are many huge rocks of lava within the\r\ncrater of Astruni, and some I have met with also in that of Agnano; the\r\ncones of both these supposed Volcanos are composed of _tufa_ and strata\r\nof loose pumice, fragments of lava and other burnt matter, exactly\r\nresembling the strata of Vesuvius. Bartholomeus Fatius, who wrote of the\r\nactions of King Alphonso the First (before the new mountain had been\r\nformed near Puzzole), conjectured that Astruni had been a Volcano.\r\nThese are his words: \"Locus Neapoli quatuor millia passuum proximus,\r\nquem vulgo Listrones vocant, nos unum e Phlegraeis Campis ab ardore\r\nnuncupandum putamus.\" There is no entrance into the crater of either\r\nAstruni or Agnano, except one, evidently made by art, and they both\r\nexactly correspond with Strabo's description of Avernus; the same may be\r\nsaid of the Solfaterra and the Monte Gauro, or Barbaro as it is\r\nsometimes called, which I shall describe presently.\r\n\r\nNear Astruni and towards the sea rises the Solfaterra, which not only\r\nretains its cone and crater, but much of its former heat. In the plain\r\nwithin the crater, smoak issues from many parts, as also from its sides;\r\nhere, by means of stones and tiles heaped over the crevices through\r\nwhich the smoak passes, they collect in an aukward manner what they call\r\n_sale armoniaco_; and from the sand of the plain they extract sulphur\r\nand alum. This spot, well attended to, might certainly produce a good\r\nrevenue, whereas I doubt if they have hitherto ever cleared 200_l._ a\r\nyear by it. The hollow sound produced by throwing a heavy stone on the\r\nplain of the crater of the Solfaterra seems to indicate, that it is\r\nsupported by a sort of arched natural vault; and one is induced to think\r\nthat there is a pool of water beneath this vault (which boils by the\r\nheat of a subterraneous fire still deeper), by the very moist steam that\r\nissues from the cracks in the plain of the Solfaterra, which, like that\r\nof boiling water, runs off a sword or knife, presented to it, in great\r\ndrops. On the outside, and at the foot of the cone of the Solfaterra,\r\ntowards the lake of Agnano, water rushes out of the rocks, so hot, as to\r\nraise the quicksilver in Fahrenheit's thermometer to the degree of\r\nboiling water[36], a fact of which I was myself an eye-witness. This\r\nplace, well worthy the observation of the curious, has been taken little\r\nnotice of; it is called the _Pisciarelli_. The common people of Naples\r\nhave great faith in the efficacy of this water; and make much use of it\r\nin all cutaneous disorders, as well as for another disorder that\r\nprevails here. It seems to be impregnated chiefly with sulphur and alum.\r\nWhen you approach your ear to the rocks of the Pisciarelli, from whence\r\nthis water ouzes, you hear a horrid boiling noise, which seems to\r\nproceed from the huge cauldron, that may be supposed to be under the\r\nplain of the Solfaterra. On the other side of the Solfaterra, next the\r\nsea, there is a rock, which has communicated with the sea, till part of\r\nit was cut away to make the road to Puzzole; this was undoubtedly a\r\nconsiderable lava, that ran from the Solfaterra when it was an active\r\nVolcano. Under this rock of lava, which is more than seventy feet high,\r\nthere is a stratum of pumice and ashes. This ancient lava is about a\r\nquarter of a mile broad; you meet with it abruptly before you come in\r\nsight of Puzzole, and it finishes as abruptly within about an hundred\r\npaces of the town. I have often thought that many quarries of stone,\r\nupon examination, would be found to owe their origin to the same cause,\r\nthough time may have effaced all signs of the Volcano from whence they\r\nproceeded. Except this rock, which is evidently lava and full of\r\nvitrifications like that of Vesuvius, all the rocks upon the coast of\r\nBaia are of _tufa_.\r\n\r\nI have observed in the lava of Vesuvius and Etna, as in this, that the\r\nbottom, as well as the surface of it, was rough and porous, like the\r\ncinders or scoriae from an iron foundery; and that for about a foot from\r\nthe surface and from the bottom, they were not near so solid and\r\ncompact as towards the centre; which must undoubtedly proceed from the\r\nimpression of the air upon the vitrified matter whilst in fusion. I\r\nmention this circumstance, as it may serve to point out true lavas with\r\nmore certainty. The ancient name of the Solfaterra was, _Forum Vulcani_;\r\na strong proof of its origin from subterraneous fire. The degree of\r\nheat, that the Solfaterra has preserved for so many ages, seems to have\r\ncalcined the stones upon its cone, and in its crater, as they are very\r\nwhite, and crumble easily in the hottest parts.\r\n\r\nWe come next to the new mountain near Puzzole, which, being of so very\r\nlate a formation, preserves its conical shape entire, and produces as\r\nyet but a very slender vegetation. It has a crater almost as deep as the\r\ncone is high, which may be near a quarter of a mile perpendicular, and\r\nis in shape a regular inverted cone. At the basis of this new mountain\r\n(which is more than three miles in circumference), the sand upon the\r\nsea shore, and even that which is washed by the sea itself, is burning\r\nhot for above the space of an hundred yards; if you take up a handful of\r\nthe sand below water, you are obliged to get rid of it directly, on\r\naccount of its intense heat.\r\n\r\nI had been long very desirous of meeting with a good account of the\r\nformation of this new mountain, because, proving this mountain to have\r\nbeen raised by mere explosion in a plain, would prove at the same time,\r\nthat all the neighbouring mountains, which are composed of the same\r\nmaterials, and have exactly or in part the same form, were raised in the\r\nlike manner; and that the seat of fire, the cause of these explosions,\r\nlies deep; which I have every reason to think.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I lately found two very good accounts of the phaenomena that\r\nattended the explosion, which formed the new mountain, published a few\r\nmonths after the event. As I think them very curious, and greatly to my\r\npurpose, and as they are rare, I will give you a literal translation of\r\nsuch extracts as relate to the formation of the Monte Nuovo. They are\r\nbound in one volume[37].\r\n\r\nThe title of the first is, _Dell Incendio di Pozzuolo, Marco Antonio\r\ndelli Falconi all Illustrissima Signiora Marchesa della Padula nel\r\nMDXXXVIII_.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the second is, _Ragionamento del Terremoto, del Nuovo\r\nMonte, del Aprimento di Terra in Pozzuolo nell' Anno 1538, e della\r\nsignificatione d'essi. Per Piero Giacomo da Toledo_; and at the end of\r\nthe book, _Stampata in Nap. per Giovanni Sulztbach Alemano, a 22di\r\nGenaro 1539, con gratia, e privilegio_.\r\n\r\n\"First then (says Marco Antonio delli Falconi), will I relate simply and\r\nexactly the operations of nature, of which I was either myself an\r\neye-witness, or as they were related to me by those who had been\r\nwitnesses of them. It is now two years that there have been frequent\r\nearthquakes at Pozzuolo, at Naples, and the neighbouring parts; on the\r\nday and in the night before the appearance of this eruption, above\r\ntwenty shocks great and small were felt at the abovementioned places.\r\nThe eruption made its appearance the 29th of September 1538, the feast\r\nof St. Michael the angel; it was on a Sunday, about an hour in the\r\nnight; and, as I have been informed, they began to see on that spot,\r\nbetween the hot baths or sweating rooms, and Trepergule, flames of fire,\r\nwhich first made their appearance at the baths, then extended towards\r\nTrepergule, and fixing in the little valley that lies between the Monte\r\nBarbaro and the hillock called del Pericolo (which was the road to the\r\nlake of Avernus and the baths), in a short time the fire increased to\r\nsuch a degree, that it burst open the earth in this place, and threw up\r\nso great a quantity of ashes and pumice stones mixed with water, as\r\ncovered the whole country; and in Naples a shower of these ashes and\r\nwater fell a great part of the night. The next morning, which was\r\nMonday, and the last of the month, the poor inhabitants of Pozzuolo,\r\nstruck with so horrible a sight, quitted their habitations, covered with\r\nthat muddy and black shower, which continued in that country the whole\r\nday, flying death, but with faces painted with its colours; some with\r\ntheir children in their arms, some with sacks full of their goods;\r\nothers leading an ass, loaded with their frightened family, towards\r\nNaples; others carrying quantities of birds of various sorts, that had\r\nfallen dead at the time the eruption began; others again with fish which\r\nthey had found, and were to be met with in plenty upon the shore, the\r\nsea having been at that time considerably dried up. Don Pedro di Toledo,\r\nViceroy of the kingdom, with many gentlemen, went to see so wonderful\r\nan appearance; I also, having met with the most honourable and\r\nincomparable gentleman, Signior Fabritio Moramaldo, on the road, went\r\nand saw the eruption and the many wonderful effects of it. The sea\r\ntowards Baia had retired a considerable way; though, from the quantity\r\nof ashes and broken pumice stones thrown up by the eruption, it appeared\r\nalmost totally dry. I saw likewise two springs in those\r\nlately-discovered ruins, one before the house that was the Queen's, of\r\nhot and salt water; the other of fresh and cold water, on the shore,\r\nabout 250 paces nearer to the eruption: some say, that, still nearer to\r\nthe spot where the eruption happened, a stream of fresh water issued\r\nforth like a little river. Turning towards the place of the eruption,\r\nyou saw mountains of smoak, part of which was very black and part very\r\nwhite, rise up to a great height; and in the midst of the smoak, at\r\ntimes, deep-coloured flames burst forth with huge stones and ashes, and\r\nyou heard a noise like the discharge of a number of great artillery. It\r\nappeared to me as if Typheus and Enceladus from Ischia and Etna with\r\ninnumerable giants, or those from the Campi Phlegrei (which, according\r\nto the opinions of some, were situated in this neighbourhood), were come\r\nto wage war again with Jupiter. The natural historians may perhaps\r\nreasonably say, that the wise poets meant no more by giants, than\r\nexhalations, shut up in the bowels of the earth, which, not finding a\r\nfree passage, open one by their own force and impulse, and form\r\nmountains, as those which occasioned this eruption have been seen to do;\r\nand methought I saw those torrents of burning smoak that Pindar\r\ndescribes in an eruption of Etna, now called Mon Gibello, in Sicily; in\r\nimitation of which, as some say, Virgil wrote these lines:\r\n\r\n  \"Ipse sed horrificis juxta tonat AEtna ruinis, &c.\r\n\r\n\"After the stones and ashes with clouds of thick smoak had been sent up,\r\nby the impulse of the fire and windy exhalation (as you see in a great\r\ncauldron that boils), into the middle region of the air, overcome by\r\ntheir own natural weight, when from distance the strength they had\r\nreceived from impulse was spent, rejected likewise by the cold and\r\nunfriendly region, you saw them fall thick, and, by degrees, the\r\ncondensed smoak clear away, raining ashes with water and stones of\r\ndifferent sizes, according to the distance from the place: then, by\r\ndegrees, with the same noise and smoak, it threw out stones and ashes\r\nagain, and so on by fits. This continued two days and nights, when the\r\nsmoak and force of the fire began to abate. The fourth day, which was\r\nThursday, at 22 o'clock, there was so great an eruption, that, as I was\r\nin the gulph of Puzzole, coming from Ischia, and not far from Misenum, I\r\nsaw, in a short time, many columns of smoak shoot up, with the most\r\nterrible noise I ever heard, and, bending over the sea, came near our\r\nboat, which was four miles or more from the place of their birth; and\r\nthe quantity of ashes, stones, and smoak, seemed as if they would cover\r\nthe whole earth and sea. Stones, great and small, and ashes more or\r\nless, according to the impulse of the fire and exhalations, began to\r\nfall, so that a great part of this country was covered with ashes; and\r\nmany, that have seen it, say, they reached the vale of Diana, and some\r\nparts of Calabria, which are more than 150 miles from Pozzuolo. The\r\nFriday and Saturday nothing but a little smoak appeared; so that many,\r\ntaking courage, went upon the spot, and say, that with the stones and\r\nashes thrown up, a mountain has been formed in that valley, not less\r\nthan three miles in circumference, and almost as high as the Monte\r\nBarbaro, which is near it, covering the Canettaria, the castle of\r\nTrepergule, all those buildings and the greatest part of the baths that\r\nwere about them; extending South towards the sea, North as far as the\r\nlake of Avernus, West to the Sudatory, and joining East to the foot of\r\nthe Monte Barbaro; so that this place has changed its form and face in\r\nsuch a manner as not to be known again: a thing almost incredible, to\r\nthose who have not seen it, that in so short a time so considerable a\r\nmountain could have been formed. On its summit there is a mouth in the\r\nform of a cup, which may be a quarter of a mile in circumference, though\r\nsome say it is as large as our market-place at Naples, from which there\r\nissues a constant smoak; and though I have seen it only at a distance,\r\nit appears very great. The Sunday following, which was the 6th of\r\nOctober, many people going to see this phaenomenon, and some having\r\nascended half the mountain, others more, about 22 o'clock there happened\r\nso sudden and horrid an eruption, with so great a smoak, that many of\r\nthese people were stifled, some of which could never be found. I have\r\nbeen told, that the number of the dead or lost amounted to twenty-four.\r\nFrom that time to this, nothing remarkable happened; it seems as if the\r\neruption returned periodically, like the ague or gout. I believe\r\nhenceforward it will not have such force, though the eruption of the\r\nSunday was accompanied with showers of ashes and water, which fell at\r\nNaples, and were seen to extend as far as the mountain of Somma, called\r\nVesuvius by the ancients; and, as I have often remarked, the clouds of\r\nsmoak proceeding from the eruption moved in a direct line towards that\r\nmountain, as if these places had a correspondence and connection one\r\nwith the other. In the night, many beams and columns of fire were seen\r\nto proceed from this eruption, and some like flashes of lightning[38].\r\nWe have then, many circumstances for our observation, the earthquakes,\r\nthe eruption, the drying up of the sea, the quantity of dead fish and\r\nbirds, the birth of springs, the shower of ashes with water and without\r\nwater, the innumerable trees in that whole country, as far as the Grotto\r\nof Lucullus, torn from their roots, thrown down, and covered with ashes,\r\nthat it gave one pain to see them: and as all these effects were\r\nproduced by the same cause that produces earthquakes; let us first\r\nenquire how earthquakes are produced, and from thence we may easily\r\ncomprehend the cause of the abovementioned events.\" Then follows a\r\ndissertation on earthquakes, and some curious conjectures relative to\r\nthe phaenomena which attended this eruption, clearly and well expressed,\r\nconsidering, as the author himself apologizes, that at that time the\r\nItalian language had been little employed on such subjects.\r\n\r\nThe account of the formation of the Monte Nuovo, by Pietro Giacomo di\r\nToledo, is given in a dialogue between the feigned personages of\r\nPeregrino and Svessano; the former of which says, \"It is now two years\r\nthat this province of Campagna has been afflicted with earthquakes, the\r\ncountry about Pozzuolo much more so than any other parts; but the 27th\r\nand the 28th of the month of September last, the earthquakes did not\r\ncease day or night, in the abovementioned city of Pozzuolo; that plain,\r\nwhich lies between the lake of Averno, the Monte Barbaro, and the sea,\r\nwas raised a little, and many cracks were made in it, from some of which\r\nissued water; and at the same time the sea, which was very near the\r\nplain, dried up about two hundred paces, so that the fish were left on\r\nthe sand, a prey to the inhabitants of Pozzuolo. At last, on the 29th of\r\nthe said month, about two hours in the night, the earth opened near the\r\nlake, and discovered a horrid mouth, from which were vomited furiously,\r\nsmoak, fire, stones, and mud composed of ashes; making, at the time of\r\nits opening, a noise like very loud thunder: the fire, that issued from\r\nthis mouth, went towards the walls of the unfortunate city; the smoak\r\nwas partly black and partly white; the black was darker than darkness\r\nitself, and the white was like the whitest cotton: these smoaks, rising\r\nin the air, seemed as if they would touch the vault of heaven; the\r\nstones that followed were, by the devouring flames, converted to pumice,\r\nthe size of which (of some I say) were much larger than an ox. The\r\nstones went about as high as a cross-bow can carry, and then fell down,\r\nsometimes on the edge, and sometimes into the mouth itself. It is very\r\ntrue that many of them in going up could not be seen, on account of the\r\ndark smoak; but, when they returned from the smoaky heat, they shewed\r\nplainly where they had been, by their strong smell of fetid sulphur,\r\njust like stones that have been thrown out of a mortar, and have passed\r\nthrough the smoak of inflamed gunpowder. The mud was of the colour of\r\nashes, and at first very liquid, then by degrees less so; and in such\r\nquantities, that in less than twelve hours, with the help of the\r\nabovementioned stones, a mountain was raised of a thousand paces in\r\nheight. Not only Pozzuolo and the neighbouring country was full of this\r\nmud, but the city of Naples also, the beauty of whose palaces were, in a\r\ngreat measure, spoiled by it. The ashes were carried as far as Calabria\r\nby the force of the winds, burning up in their passage the grass and\r\nhigh trees, many of which were borne down by the weight of them. An\r\ninfinity of birds also, and numberless animals of various kinds, covered\r\nwith this sulphureous mud, gave themselves up a prey to man. Now this\r\neruption lasted two nights and two days without intermission, though, it\r\nis true, not always with the same force, but more or less: when it was\r\nat its greatest height, even at Naples you heard a noise or thundering\r\nlike heavy artillery when two armies are engaged. The third day the\r\neruption ceased, so that the mountain made its appearance uncovered, to\r\nthe no small astonishment of every one who saw it. On this day, when I\r\nwent up with many people to the top of this mountain; I saw down into\r\nits mouth, which was a round concavity of about a quarter of a mile in\r\ncircumference, in the middle of which the stones that had fallen were\r\nboiling up, just as in a great cauldron of water that boils on the\r\nfire. The fourth day it began to throw up again, and the seventh much\r\nmore, but still with less violence than the first night; it was at this\r\ntime that many people, who were unfortunately on the mountain, were\r\neither suddenly covered with ashes, smothered with smoak, or, knocked\r\ndown by stones, burnt by the flame, and left dead on the spot. The smoak\r\ncontinues to this day[39], and you often see in the night-time fire in\r\nthe midst of it. Finally, to complete the history of this new and\r\nunforeseen event, in many parts of the new-made mountain, sulphur begins\r\nto be generated.\" Giacomo di Toledo, towards the end of his dissertation\r\nupon the phaenomena attending this eruption, says, that the lake of\r\nAvernus had a communication with the sea, before the time of the\r\neruption; and that he apprehended that the air of Puzzole might come to\r\nbe affected in summer time, by the vapours from the stagnated waters of\r\nthe lake; which is actually the case.\r\n\r\nYou have, Sir, from these accounts, an instance of a mountain, of a\r\nconsiderable height and dimensions, formed in a plain, by mere\r\nexplosion, in the space of forty-eight hours. The earthquakes having\r\nbeen sensibly felt at a great distance from the spot where the opening\r\nwas made, proves clearly, that the subterraneous fire was at a great\r\ndepth below the surface of the plain; it is as clear that those\r\nearthquakes, and the explosion, proceeded from the same cause, the\r\nformer having ceased upon the appearance of the latter. Does not this\r\ncircumstance evidently contradict the system of M. Buffon, and of all\r\nthe natural historians, who have placed the seat of the fire of\r\nVolcanos towards the center, or near the summit of the mountains, which\r\nthey suppose to furnish the matter emitted? Did the matter which\r\nproceeds from a Volcano in an eruption come from so inconsiderable a\r\ndepth as they imagine, that part of the mountain situated above their\r\nsupposed seat of the fire must necessarily be destroyed, or dissipated\r\nin a very short time: on the contrary, an eruption usually adds to the\r\nheight and bulk of a Volcano; and who, that has had an opportunity of\r\nmaking observations on Volcanos, does not know, that the matter they\r\nhave emitted for many ages, in lavas, ashes, smoak, &c. could it be\r\ncollected together, would more than suffice to form three such mountains\r\nas the simple cone or mountain of the existing Volcano? With respect to\r\nVesuvius, this could be plainly proved; and I refer to my letter upon\r\nthe subject of Etna, to shew the quantity of matter thrown up in one\r\nsingle eruption, by that terrible Volcano. Another proof, that the real\r\nseat of the fire of Volcanos lies even greatly below the general level\r\nof the country whence the mountain springs, is, that was it only at an\r\ninconsiderable depth below the basis of the mountain, the quantity of\r\nmatter thrown up would soon leave so great a void immediately under it,\r\nthat the mountain itself must undoubtedly sink and disappear after a few\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nIn the above accounts of the formation of the new mountain, we are told\r\nthat the matter first thrown up, was mud composed of water and ashes,\r\nmixed with pumice stones and other burnt matter: on the road leading\r\nfrom Puzzole to Cuma, part of the cone of this mountain has been cut\r\naway, to widen the road. I have there seen that its composition is a\r\n_tufa_ intermixed with pumice, some of which are really of the size of\r\nan ox, as mentioned in Toledo's account, and exactly of the same nature\r\nas the _tufa_ of which every other high ground in its neighbourhood is\r\ncomposed; similar also to that which covers Herculaneum. According to\r\nthe above accounts, after the muddy shower ceased, it rained dry ashes:\r\nthis circumstance will account for the strata of loose pumice and ashes,\r\nthat are generally upon the surface of all the _tufas_ in this country,\r\nand which were most probably thrown up in the same manner. At the first\r\nopening of the earth, in the plain near Puzzole, both accounts say, that\r\nsprings of water burst forth; this water, mixing with the ashes,\r\ncertainly occasioned the muddy shower; when the springs were exhausted,\r\nthere must naturally have ensued a shower of dry ashes and pumice, of\r\nwhich we have been likewise assured. I own, I was greatly pleased at\r\nbeing in this manner enabled to account so well for the formation of\r\nthese _tufa_ stones and the veins of dry and loose burnt matter above\r\nthem, of which the soil of almost the whole country I am describing is\r\ncomposed; and I do not know that any one has ever attended to this\r\ncircumstance, though I find that many authors, who have described this\r\ncountry, have suspected that parts of it were formed by explosion.\r\nWherever then this sort of _tufa_ is found, there is certainly good\r\nauthority to suspect its having been formed in the same manner as the\r\n_tufa_ of this new mountain, for, as I said before, Nature is generally\r\nuniform in all her operations.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly imagined that the new mountain rose out of the Lucrine\r\nlake, which was destroyed by it; but in the above account, no mention is\r\nmade of the Lucrine lake; it may be supposed then, that the famous dam,\r\nwhich Strabo and many other ancient authors mention to have separated\r\nthat lake from the sea, had been ruined by time or accident, and that\r\nthe lake became a part of the sea before the explosion of 1538.\r\n\r\nIf the above-described eruption was terrible, that which formed the\r\nMonte Barbaro (or Gauro, as it was formerly called), must have been\r\ndreadful indeed. It joins immediately to the new mountain, which in\r\nshape and composition it exactly resembles; but it is at least three\r\ntimes as considerable. Its crater cannot be less than six miles in\r\ncircumference; the plain within the crater, one of the most fertile\r\nspots I ever saw, is about four miles in circumference: there is no\r\nentrance to this plain, but one on the East side of the mountain, made\r\nevidently by art; in this section you have an opportunity of seeing that\r\nthe matter of which the mountain is composed is exactly similar to that\r\nof the Monte Nuovo. It was this mountain that produced (as some authors\r\nhave supposed) the celebrated Falernian wine of the ancients.\r\n\r\nCuma, allowed to have been the most ancient city of Italy, was built on\r\nan eminence, which is likewise composed of _tufa_, and may be naturally\r\nsupposed a section of the cone formed by a very ancient explosion.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Avernus fills the bottom of the crater of a mountain,\r\nundoubtedly produced by explosion, and whose interior and exterior\r\nform, as well as the matter of which it is composed, exactly resemble\r\nthe Monte Barbaro and Monte Nuovo. At that part of the basis of this\r\nmountain which is washed by the sea of the bay of Puzzole, the sand is\r\nstill very hot, though constantly washed by the waves; and into the cone\r\nof the mountain, near this hot sand, a narrow passage of about 100 paces\r\nin length is cut, and leads to a fountain of boiling water, which,\r\nthough brackish, boils fish and flesh without giving them any bad taste\r\nor quality, as I have experienced more than once. This place is called\r\nNero's bath, and is still made use of for a sudatory, as it was by the\r\nancients; the steam that rises from the hot fountain abovementioned,\r\nconfined in the narrow subterraneous passage, soon produces a violent\r\nperspiration upon the patient who sits therein. This bath is reckoned a\r\ngreat specifick in that distemper which is supposed to have made its\r\nappearance at Naples before it spread its contagion over the other\r\nparts of Europe.\r\n\r\nVirgil and other ancient authors say, that birds could not fly with\r\nsafety over the lake of Avernus, but that they fell therein; a\r\ncircumstance favouring my opinion, that this was once the mouth of a\r\nVolcano. The vapour of the sulphur and other minerals must undoubtedly\r\nhave been more powerful, the nearer we go back to the time of the\r\nexplosion of the Volcano; and I am convinced that there are still some\r\nremains of those vapours upon this lake, as I have observed there are\r\nvery seldom any water-fowl upon it; and that when they do go there, it\r\nis but for a short time; whilst all the other lakes in the neighbourhood\r\nare constantly covered with them, in the winter season. Upon Mount\r\nVesuvius, in the year 1766, during an eruption, when the air was\r\nimpregnated with noxious vapours, I have myself picked up dead birds\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nThe castle of Baia stands upon a considerable eminence, composed of the\r\nusual _tufa_ and strata of pumice and ashes; from which I concluded I\r\nshould find some remains of the craters from whence the matter issued:\r\naccordingly, having ascended the hill, I soon discovered two very\r\nvisible craters, just behind the castle.\r\n\r\nThe lake called the Mare-morto was also, most probably, the crater, from\r\nwhence issued the materials which formed the Promontory of Misenum, and\r\nthe high grounds around this lake. Under the ruins of an ancient\r\nbuilding, near the point of Misenum, in a vault, there is a vapour, or\r\n_mofete_, exactly similar in its effects to that of the Grotto del Cane,\r\nas I have often experienced.\r\n\r\nThe form of the little island of Nisida shews plainly its origin[40]. It\r\nis half a hollow cone of a Volcano cut perpendicularly; the half crater\r\nforms a little harbour called the Porto Pavone; I suppose the other half\r\nof the cone to have been detached into the sea by earthquakes, or\r\nperhaps by the violence of the waves, as the part that is wanting is the\r\nside next to the open sea.\r\n\r\nThe fertile and pleasant island of Procita shews also most evident signs\r\nof its production by explosion, the nature of its soil being directly\r\nsimilar to that of Baia and Puzzole; this island seems really, as was\r\nimagined by the ancients, to have been detached from the neighbouring\r\nisland of Ischia.\r\n\r\nThere is no spot, I believe, that could afford a more ample field for\r\ncurious observations, than the island of Ischia, called Enaria, Inarime,\r\nand Pithecusa, by the ancients. I have visited it three times; and this\r\nsummer passed three weeks there, during which time I examined, with\r\nattention, every part of it. Ischia is eighteen miles in circumference:\r\nthe whole of its soil is the same as that near Vesuvius, Naples, and\r\nPuzzole. There are numberless springs, hot, warm, and cold[41],\r\ndispersed over the whole island, the waters of which are impregnated\r\nwith minerals of various sorts; so that, if you give credit to the\r\ninhabitants of the country, there is no disorder but what finds its\r\nremedy here. In the hot months (the season for making use of these\r\nbaths), those who have occasion for them flock hither from Naples. A\r\ncharitable institution sends and maintains three hundred poor patients\r\nat the baths of Gurgitelli every season. By what I could learn of these\r\npoor patients, those baths have really done wonders, in cases attended\r\nwith obstinate tumours, and in contractions of the tendons and muscles.\r\nThe patient begins by bathing, and then is buried in the hot sand near\r\nthe sea. In many parts of the island, the sand is burning hot, even\r\nunder water. The sand on some parts of the shore is almost entirely\r\ncomposed of particles of iron ore; at least they are attracted by the\r\nload-stone, as I have experienced. Near that part of the island called\r\nLacco, there is a rock of an ancient lava, forming a small cavern, which\r\nis shut up with a door; this cavern is made use of to cool liquors and\r\nfruit, which it does in a short time as effectually as ice. Before the\r\ndoor was opened, I felt the cold to my legs very sensibly; but when it\r\nwas opened, the cold rushed out so as to give me pain; and within the\r\ngrotto it was intolerable. I was not sensible of wind attending this\r\ncold; though upon Mount Etna and Mount Vesuvius, where there are caverns\r\nof this kind, the cold is evidently occasioned by a subterraneous wind:\r\nthe natives call such places _ventaroli_. May not the quantity of nitre,\r\nwith which all these places abound, account in some measure for such\r\nextreme cold? My thermometer was unluckily broken, or I would have\r\ninformed you of the exact degree of the cold in this _ventaroli_ of\r\nIschia, which is by much the strongest in its effects I ever felt. The\r\nancient lavas of Ischia shew, that the eruptions there have been very\r\nformidable; and history informs us, that its first inhabitants were\r\ndriven out of the island by the frequency and the violence of them.\r\nThere are some of these ancient lavas not less than two hundred feet in\r\ndepth. The mountain of St. Nicola, on which there is at present a\r\nconvent of hermits, was called by the ancients Epomeus; it is as high,\r\nif not higher, than Vesuvius, and appears to me to be a section of the\r\ncone of the ancient and principal Volcano of the island, its composition\r\nbeing all _tufa_ or lava. The cells of the convent abovementioned are\r\ncut out of the mountain itself; and there you see plainly that its\r\ncomposition no way differs from the matter that covers Herculaneum, and\r\nforms the Monte Nuovo. There is no sign of a crater on the top of this\r\nmountain, which rises almost to a sharp point: time, and other\r\naccidents, may be reasonably supposed to have worn away this distinctive\r\nmark of its having been formed by explosion, as I have seen to be the\r\ncase in other mountains, formed evidently by explosion, on the flanks of\r\nEtna and Vesuvius. Strabo, in his 5th book, upon the subject of this\r\nisland, quotes Timaeus, as having said, that, a little before his time, a\r\nmountain in the middle of Pithecusa, called Epomeus, was shook by an\r\nearthquake, and vomited flames.\r\n\r\nThere are many other rising grounds in this island, that, from the\r\nnature of their composition, must lead one to think the same as to their\r\norigin. Near the village of Castiglione, there is a mountain formed\r\nsurely by an explosion of a much later date, having preserved its\r\nconical form and crater entire, and producing as yet but a slender\r\nvegetation: there is no account, however, of the date of this eruption.\r\nNearer the town of Ischia, which is on the sea shore, at a place called\r\n_Le Cremate_, there is a crater, from which, in the year 1301 or 1302, a\r\nlava ran quite into the sea; there is not the least vegetation on this\r\nlava, but it is nearly in the same state as the modern lavas of\r\nVesuvius. Pontano, Maranti, and D. Francesco Lombardi, have recorded\r\nthis eruption; the latter of whom says, that it lasted two months; that\r\nmany men and beasts were killed by the explosion; and that a number of\r\nthe inhabitants were obliged to seek for refuge at Naples and in the\r\nneighbouring islands. In short, according to my idea, the island of\r\nIschia must have taken its rise from the bottom of the sea, and been\r\nincreased to its present size by divers later explosions. This is not\r\nextraordinary, when history tells us (and from my own observation I have\r\nreason to believe) that the Lipari islands were formed in the like\r\nmanner. There has been no eruption in Ischia since that just mentioned,\r\nbut earthquakes are very frequent there; two years ago, as I was told,\r\nthey had a very considerable shock of an earthquake in this island.\r\n\r\nFather Goree's account of the formation of the new island in the\r\nArchipelago (situated between the two islands called Kammeni, and near\r\nthat of Santorini) of which he was an eye-witness, strongly confirms the\r\nprobability of the conjectures I venture to send you, relative to the\r\nformation of those islands and that part of the continent above\r\ndescribed: it seems likewise to confirm the accounts given by Strabo,\r\nPliny, Justin, and other ancient authors, of many islands in the\r\nArchipelago, formerly called the Ciclades, having sprung up from the\r\nbottom of the sea[42] in the like manner. According to Pliny, in the\r\n4th year of the CXXXVth Olympiad, 237 years before the Christian aera,\r\nthe island of Thera (now Santorini) and Theresia were formed by\r\nexplosion; and, 130 years later, the island Hiera (now called the great\r\nKammeni) rose up. Strabo describes the birth of this island in these\r\nwords: \"In the middle space between Thera and Theresia flames burst out\r\nof the sea for four days, which, by degrees, throwing up great masses,\r\nas if they had been raised by machines, they formed an island of twelve\r\nstadia in circuit.\" And Justin says of the same island, \"Eodem anno\r\ninter insulas Theramenem et Theresiam, medio utriusque ripae et maris\r\nspatio, terrae motus fuit: in quo, cum admiratione navigantium, repente\r\nex profundo cum calidis aquis Insula emersit.\"\r\n\r\nPliny mentions also the formation of Aspronisi, or the White Island, by\r\nexplosion, in the time of Vespasian. It is known, likewise, that in the\r\nyear 1628, one of the islands of the Azores, near the island of St.\r\nMichael, rose up from the bottom of the sea, which was in that place 160\r\nfathoms deep; and that this island, which was raised in fifteen days, is\r\nthree leagues long, a league and a half broad, and rises three hundred\r\nand sixty feet above water.\r\n\r\nFather Goree, in his account of the formation of the new island in the\r\nArchipelago, mentions two distinct matters that entered into the\r\ncomposition of this island, the one black, the other white. Aspronisi,\r\nprobably from its very name, is composed of the white matter, which if,\r\nupon examination, it proves to be a _tufa_, as I strongly suspect, I\r\nshould think myself still more grounded in my conjectures; though I must\r\nconfess, as it is, I have scarcely a doubt left with respect to the\r\ncountry I have been describing having been thrown up in a long series\r\nof ages by various explosions from subterraneous fire. Surely there are\r\nat present many existing Volcanos in the known world; and the memory of\r\nmany others have been handed down to us by history. May there not\r\ntherefore have been many others, of such ancient dates as to be out of\r\nthe reach of history[43]?\r\n\r\nSuch wonderful operations of Nature are certainly intended by all-wise\r\nProvidence for some great purpose. They are not confined to any one part\r\nof the globe, for there are Volcanos existing in the four quarters of\r\nit. We see the great fertility of the soil thrown up by explosion, in\r\npart of the country I have described, which on that account was called\r\nby the ancients _Campania Felix_. The same circumstance is evident in\r\nSicily, justly esteemed one of the most fertile spots in the world, and\r\nthe granary of Italy. May not subterraneous fire be considered as the\r\ngreat plough (if I may be allowed the expression), which Nature makes\r\nuse of to turn up the bowels of the earth, and afford us fresh fields to\r\nwork upon, whilst we are exhausting those we are actually in possession\r\nof, by the frequent crops we draw from them? Would it not be found, upon\r\nenquiry, that many precious minerals must have remained far out of our\r\nreach, had it not been for such operations of Nature? It is evidently so\r\nin this country. But such great enquiries would lead me far indeed. I\r\nwill only add a reflection, which my little experience in this branch of\r\nnatural history furnishes me with. It is, that we are apt to judge of\r\nthe great operations of Nature on too confined a plan. When first I came\r\nto Naples, my whole attention, with respect to natural history, was\r\nconfined to Mount Vesuvius, and the wonderful phaenomena attending a\r\nburning mountain: but, in proportion as I began to perceive the evident\r\nmarks of the same operation having been carried on in the different\r\nparts above described, and likewise in Sicily in a greater degree, I\r\nlooked upon Mount Vesuvius only as a spot on which Nature was at present\r\nactive; and thought myself fortunate in having an opportunity of seeing\r\nthe manner in which one of her great operations (an operation, I\r\nbelieve, much less out of her common course than is generally imagined)\r\nwas effected.\r\n\r\nSuch remarks as I have made on the eruptions of Mount Vesuvius, during\r\nmy residence at Naples, have been transmitted to the Royal Society, who\r\nhave done them more honour than they deserved. Many more might be made\r\nupon this active Volcano, by a person who had leisure, a previous\r\nknowledge of the natural history of the earth, a knowledge of chemistry,\r\nand was practised in physical experiments, particularly those of\r\nelectricity[44]. I am convinced, that the smoak of Volcanos contains\r\nalways a portion of electrical matter; which is manifest at the time of\r\ngreat eruptions, as is mentioned in my account of the great eruption of\r\nVesuvius in 1767. The peasants in the neighbourhood of my villa,\r\nsituated at the foot of Vesuvius, have assured me, that, during the\r\neruption last mentioned, they were more alarmed by the lightning and\r\nballs of fire that fell about them with a crackling noise, than by the\r\nlava and the usual attendants of an eruption. I find in all the accounts\r\nof great eruptions mention made of this sort of lightning, which is\r\ndistinguished here by the name of _Ferilli_. Bracini, in his account of\r\nthe great one of Vesuvius in 1631, says, that the column of smoak, which\r\nissued from its crater, went over near an hundred miles of country, and\r\nthat several men and beasts were struck dead by lightning, issuing from\r\nthis smoak in its course.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the noxious vapours, called here _mofete_, that are\r\nusually set in motion by an eruption of the Volcano, and are then\r\nmanifest in the wells and subterraneous parts of its neighbourhood, seem\r\nlikewise to be little understood. From some experiments very lately\r\nmade, by the ingenious Dr. Nooth, on the _mofete_ of the Grotto del\r\nCane, it appears that all its known qualities and effects correspond\r\nwith those attributed to fixed air. Just before the eruption of 1767, a\r\nvapour of this kind broke into the King's chapel at Portici, by which a\r\nservant, opening the door of it, was struck down. About the same time,\r\nas his Sicilian Majesty was shooting in a paddock near the palace, a dog\r\ndropped down, as was supposed, in a fit; a boy going to take him up\r\ndropped likewise; a person present, suspecting the accident to have\r\nproceeded from a _mofete_, immediately dragged them both from the spot\r\nwhere they lay, in doing which, he was himself sensible of the vapour;\r\nthe boy and the dog soon recovered. His Sicilian Majesty did me the\r\nhonour of informing me himself of this accident soon after it had\r\nhappened. I have met with these _mofetes_ often, when I have been making\r\nmy observations on the borders of Mount Vesuvius, particularly in\r\ncaverns, and once on the Solfaterra. The vapour affects the nostrils,\r\nthroat, and stomach, just as the spirit of hartshorn, or any strong\r\nvolatile salts; and would soon prove fatal, if you did not immediately\r\nremove from it. Under the ancient city of Pompeii, the _mofetes_ are\r\nvery frequent and powerful, so that the excavations that are carrying on\r\nthere are often interrupted by them; at all times _mofetes_ are to be\r\nmet with under ancient lavas of Vesuvius, particularly those of the\r\ngreat eruption of 1631. In Serao's account of the eruption of 1737, and\r\nin the chapter upon _mofetes_, he has recorded several curious\r\nexperiments relative to this phaenomenon. The Canonico Recupero, who, as\r\nI mentioned to you in a former letter, is watching the operations of\r\nMount Etna, has just informed me, that a very powerful _mofete_ has\r\nlately manifested itself in the neighbourhood of Etna; and that he\r\nfound, near the spot from whence it rises, animals, birds, and insects,\r\ndead, and the stronger sort of shrubs blasted, whilst the grass and the\r\ntenderer plants did not seem to be affected. The circumstance of this\r\n_mofete_, added to that of the frequent earthquakes felt lately at\r\nRhegio and Messina, makes it probable that an eruption of Mount Etna is\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nI am alarmed at the length of this letter. By endeavouring to make\r\nmyself clearly understood, I have been led to make, what I thought,\r\nnecessary digressions. I must therefore beg of your goodness, that,\r\nshould you find this memoir, in its present state, too tedious (which I\r\ngreatly apprehend) to be presented to our respectable Society, you will\r\nmake only such extracts from it as you shall think will be most\r\nagreeable and interesting.

Secretary to the Royal SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Naples, March 5, 1771.\r\n\r\nSince I had the pleasure of sending you my letter, in which the nature\r\nof the soil of more than twenty miles round this capital is described;\r\nexamining a deep hollow way cut by the rain waters into the outside cone\r\nof the Solfaterra, I discovered, that a great part of the cone of that\r\nancient Volcano has been calcined by the hot vapours above described.\r\nPumice calcined seems to be the chief ingredient, of which several\r\nspecimens of (as I suppose) variegated unformed marble are composed, and\r\nthe beautiful variegations in them may have probably been occasioned by\r\nthe mineral vapours. As these specimens are now sent to the Royal\r\nSociety, you will see that these variegations are exactly of the same\r\npattern and colours as are met in many marbles and flowered alabasters;\r\nand I cannot help thinking that they are marble or alabaster in its\r\ninfant state. What a proof we have here of the great changes the earth\r\nwe inhabit is subject to! What is now the Solfaterra, we have every\r\nreason to suppose to have been originally thrown up by a subterraneous\r\nexplosion from the bottom of the sea. That it was long an existing\r\nVolcano, is plain, from the ancient currents of lava, that are still to\r\nbe traced from its crater to the sea, from the strata of pumice and\r\nerupted matter, of which its cone, in common with those of other\r\nVolcanos, is composed, and from the testimony of many ancient authors.\r\nIts cone in many parts has been calcined, and is still calcining, by the\r\nhot vapours that are continually issuing forth through its pores; and\r\nits nature is totally changed by this chemical process of Nature. In the\r\nhollow way, where I made these remarks, you see the different strata of\r\nerupted matter, that compose the cone, in some places perfectly\r\ncalcined, in others not, according as the vapours have found means to\r\ninsinuate themselves more or less.\r\n\r\nA hollow way, cut by the rains on the back of the mountain on which part\r\nof Naples is situated, towards Capo di China, shews that the mountain is\r\ncomposed of strata of erupted matter, among which are large masses of\r\nbitumen, in which its former state of fluidity is very visible. Here it\r\nwas I discovered that pumice stone is produced from bitumen, which I\r\nbelieve has not yet been remarked. Some specimens shew evidently the\r\ngradual process from bitumen to pumice: and you will observe that the\r\ncrystalline vitrifications, which are visible in the bitumen, suffer no\r\nalteration, but remain in the same state in the perfect pumice as in the\r\nbitumen.\r\n\r\nIn a piece of stratum, calcined from the outside of the Solfaterra, the\r\nform and texture of the pumice stones is very discernible. In several\r\nparts of the outside cone, this calcining operation is still carried on,\r\nby the exhalation of constant very hot and damp vapours, impregnated\r\nwith salts, sulphur, alum, &c. Where the abovementioned vapours have not\r\noperated, the strata of pumice and erupted matter, that compose the cone\r\nof the Solfaterra, are like those of all the high grounds in its\r\nneighbourhood, which I suppose to have been thrown up likewise by\r\nexplosion. I have seen here, half of a large piece of lava perfectly\r\ncalcined, whilst the other half out of the reach of the vapours has\r\nbeen untouched; and in some pieces the centre seems to be already\r\nconverted into true marble.\r\n\r\nThe variegated specimens then, above described, are nothing more than\r\npumice and erupted matter, after having been acted upon in this manner\r\nby the hot vapours; and if you consider the process, as I have traced\r\nit, from bitumen to pumice, and from pumice to marble, you will think\r\nwith me, that it is difficult to determine the primitive state of the\r\nmany wonderful productions we see in Nature.\r\n\r\nI found, in the _tufa_ of the mountain of Pausilipo, a fragment of lava:\r\none side I polished, to shew it to be true lava; the other shews the\r\nsigns of the _tufa_, with which it is incorporated. It has evidently\r\nbeen rounded by friction, and most probably by rolling in the sea. Is it\r\nnot natural then to imagine that there must have been Volcanos near this\r\nspot, long before the formation of the mountain of Pausilipo? This\r\nlittle stone may perhaps raise in your mind such reflections as it did\r\nin mine, relative to the great changes our globe suffers, and the\r\nprobability of its great antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Having reflected since upon this circumstance, I rather believe that\r\nthe weight of the atmosphere in bad weather, preventing the free\r\ndissipation of the smoke, and collecting it over the crater, gives it\r\nthe appearance of being more considerable; whereas in fine weather the\r\nsmoke is dispersed soon after its emission. It is, however, the\r\ncommon-received opinion at Naples (and from my own observation is, I\r\nbelieve, well founded), that when Vesuvius grumbles, bad weather is at\r\nhand. The sea of the Bay of Naples, being particularly agitated, and\r\nswelling some hours before the arrival of a storm, may very probably\r\nforce itself into crevices, leading to the bowels of the Volcano, and,\r\nby causing a new fermentation, produce those explosions and grumblings.\r\n\r\n[2] These ashes destroy the leaves and fruit, and are greatly\r\ndetrimental to vegetation for a year or two; but are certainly of great\r\nservice to the land in general, and are among the principal causes of\r\nthat very great fertility which is remarkable in the neighbourhood of\r\nVolcano's.\r\n\r\n[3] In the subsequent eruptions of Vesuvius, I have constantly remarked\r\nsomething of the same nature, as appears in my account of the great\r\neruption of 1767. I have found the same remark in many accounts of\r\nformer eruptions of Vesuvius: in the very curious one of the formation\r\nof a new mountain near Puzzole, in 1538, (as may be seen in my letter to\r\nDr. Maty, Oct. 16, 1770[46],) the same observation is made. This\r\nphaenomenon, is well worthy of a curious inquiry, which might give some\r\nlight into the theory of the earth, of which, I believe, we are very\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\n[4] I am convinced, that it might be very practicable to divert the\r\ncourse of a lava when in this state, by preparing a new bed for it, as\r\nis practised with rivers. I was mentioning this idea at Catania in\r\nSicily, when I was assured, that it had been done with success during\r\nthe great eruption of Etna, in 1669; that the lava was directing its\r\ncourse towards the walls of Catania, and advancing slowly like the\r\nabovementioned, when they prepared a channel for it round the walls of\r\nthe town, and turned it into the sea; that a succession of men, covered\r\nwith sheep-skins wetted, were employed to cut through the tough flanks\r\nof the lava, till they made a passage for that in the centre (which was\r\nin perfect fusion) to disgorge itself into the channel prepared for it.\r\nA book I have since met with gives the same account of this curious\r\noperation; it is intituled, _Relatione del nuovo incendio fatto da\r\nMongibello 1669. Messina, Giuseppe Bisagni, 1670_. His Sicilian\r\nMajesty's palace at Portici, and the valuable collection of antiquities\r\nthat have been recovered from beneath the destructive lava's of\r\nVesuvius, are in imminent danger of being overwhelmed again by the next\r\nthat shall take its course that way; whereas, by taking a level, cutting\r\naway and raising ground, as occasion might require, the palace and\r\nmuseum would, in all probability, be insured, at least against one\r\neruption; and, indeed, I once took the liberty of communicating this\r\nidea to the King of Naples, who seemed to approve of it.\r\n\r\n[5] The late Lord Morton was pleased to give these specimens to Dr.\r\nMorris, who has made several chemical experiments on them, the result of\r\nwhich will be communicated to the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n[6] From what I have seen and read of eruptions of Vesuvius and Etna, I\r\nam convinced that Volcano's lie dormant for several years, nay even for\r\ncenturies, as probably was the case of Vesuvius before its eruption in\r\nthe reign of Titus, and certainly was so before that of the year 1631.\r\nWhen I arrived at Naples in 1764, Vesuvius was quiet, very seldom smoak\r\nwas visible on its top; in the year 1766, it seemed to take fire, and\r\nhas never since been three months without either throwing up red hot\r\nstones, or disgorging streams of lava, nor has its crater been ever free\r\nfrom smoak. At Naples, when a lava appears, and not till then, it is\r\nstyled an eruption; whereas I look upon the five nominal eruptions I\r\nhave been witness to, from March 1766 to May 1771, as, in effect, but\r\none continued eruption.\r\n\r\n[7] It is certain, that, by constant attention to the smoak that issues\r\nfrom the crater, a very good guess may be given as to the degree of\r\nfermentation within the Volcano. By this alone I foretold[47] the two\r\nlast eruptions, and, by another very simple observation, I pointed out,\r\nsome time before, the very spot from whence the lava has issued. When\r\nthe cone of Vesuvius was covered with snow, I had remarked a spot on\r\nwhich it would not lie: concluding very naturally that this was the\r\nweakest part of the cone, and that the heat from within prevented the\r\nsnow from lying; it was as natural to imagine that the lava, seeking a\r\nvent, would force this passage sooner than another; and so indeed it\r\ncame to pass.\r\n\r\n[8] These are his words: \"Nubes (incertum procul intuentibus ex quo\r\nmonte Vesuvium fuisse postea cognitum est) oriebatur, cujus\r\nsimilitudinem & formam, non alia magis arbor, quam pinus expresserit.\r\nNam longissimo veluti trunco elata in altum, quibusdam ramis\r\ndiffundebatur, credo quia recenti spiritu evecta, dein senescente eo\r\ndestituta, aut etiam pondere suo victa, in latitudinem evanescebat:\r\ncandida interdum, interdum sordida & maculosa, prout terram cineremve\r\nsustulerat.\" Plin. lib. vi. ep. 16.\r\n\r\n[9] The windows at Naples open like folding-doors.\r\n\r\n[10] In several accounts of former eruptions of Vesuvius, I have found\r\nmention of the ashes falling at a much greater distance; that, in the\r\nyear 472 and 473, they had reached Constantinople: Dio says, that during\r\nthe eruption of Vesuvius in the time of Titus--\"tantus fuit pulvis ut ab\r\neo loco in Africam et Syriam et AEgyptum penetraverit.\" A book printed at\r\nLecce, in the kingdom of Naples, in MDCXXXII, and intituled, _Discorso\r\nsopra l'origine de fuochi gettati dal Monte Vesuvio di Gio Francesco\r\nSorrata Spinola Galateo_, says, that the 16th of December, 1631, the\r\nvery day of the great eruption of Vesuvius (though perfectly calm), it\r\nrained ashes at Lecce, which is nine days journey from the mountain:\r\nthat the day was darkened by them, and that they covered the ground\r\nthree inches deep; that ashes of a different quality fell at Bari the\r\nsame day; and that at both these places the inhabitants were very\r\ngreatly alarmed, not being able to conceive the occasion of such a\r\nphaenomenon. Antonio Bulifon, in his account of the same eruption, says,\r\nthat the ashes fell, and lay several inches deep at Ariano in Puglia;\r\nand I have been assured, by many persons of credit at Naples, that they\r\nhave been sensible of the fall of ashes, during an eruption, at above\r\ntwo hundred miles distance from Vesuvius. The Abbate Giulio Cesare\r\nBracini, in his account of the eruption of Vesuvius, in 1631, says, that\r\nthe height of the column of smoak and ashes, taken from Naples by a\r\nquadrant, was upwards of thirty miles. Though such uncertain\r\ncalculations demand but little attention; yet, by what I have seen, I am\r\nconvinced, that in great eruptions the ashes are sent up to so great a\r\nheight as to meet with extraordinary currents of air, which is the most\r\nprobable way of accounting for their having been carried to so great a\r\ndistance in a few hours. In a book, intituled, _Salvatoris Varonis\r\nVesuviani incendii Libri tres: Neapoli_, MDCXXXIV, I found a very\r\npoetical description of the ashes that lay in the neighbourhood of\r\nVesuvius, after the eruption of 1631, in depth, from twenty to a hundred\r\npalms: \"Quare,\" says this author, \"multi patrio in solo requirunt\r\npatriam, et vix ibi se credunt vivere ubi certo sciant sese natos, adeo\r\ntotam loci speciem tempestas vertit.\"\r\n\r\n[11] This conjecture has proved true; for, even in the month of April\r\n1771, I again thrust sticks into some crevices of this lava, and they\r\nimmediately took fire. On Mount Etna, in 1769, I observed the lava, that\r\nhad been disgorged in 1766, smoak in many parts.\r\n\r\n[12] In all accounts of great eruptions of Mount Etna and Mount\r\nVesuvius, I have found mention of this sort of lightning. Pliny the\r\nyounger, in his second letter to Tacitus upon the eruption of Vesuvius\r\nin the time of Titus, says, that a black and horrible cloud covered them\r\nat Misenum (which is above fifteen miles from the Volcano), and that\r\nflashes of zig-zag fire, like lightning, but stronger, burst from it;\r\nthese are his words: \"ab altero latere nubes atra et horrenda ignei\r\nspiritus tortis vibratisque discursibus rupta, in longas flammarum\r\nfiguras dehiscebat; fulgoribus illae et similes et majores erant.\" This\r\nwas evidently the same electrical fire, and with which I am convinced\r\nthat the smoak of all Volcanos is pregnant. In several accounts of the\r\ngreat eruption of Vesuvius in 1631, mention is made of damage done by\r\nthe lightning that issued from the column of smoak. Bulifon, in\r\nparticular, says, that, in the neighbourhood of the Volcano, people were\r\nstruck dead in the same manner as if by lightning, without having their\r\ncloaths singed. Pliny mentions a like instance, which shews that the\r\nancients had observed this phaenomenon; for he says, that at Pompeii, the\r\nday being fair, Marcus Herennius was struck dead by lightning. These are\r\nhis words; \"In Catilianis prodigiis, Pompeiano ex municipio M. Herennius\r\nDecurio _serena die_, fulmine ictus est.\" Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. II. cap.\r\nLI. The learned and ingenious Father Beccaria, at Turin, assured me,\r\nthat he had been greatly pleased with my observations on this species of\r\nlightning, as coinciding perfectly with several of his electrical\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n[13] \"I am well convinced, by this collection, that many variegated\r\nmarbles, and many precious stones, are the produce of Volcanos; and that\r\nthere have been Volcanos in many parts of the world, where at present\r\nthere are no traces of them visible.\" This is taken from a prior letter\r\nto Lord Morton, dated April 7, 1767.\r\n\r\n[14] In some accounts of an eruption of Vesuvius in 1660, I find mention\r\nmade of ashes which fell in the shape of crosses, and were looked upon\r\nas highly miraculous; but in one book upon this subject, intituled,\r\n_Athanasii Kircheri Soc. Jes. De prodigiosis crucibus, &c. Romae_,\r\nMDCLXI, a very philosophical account is given of this phaenomenon; he\r\nsays, that, in 1660, from the 16th of August to the 15th of October,\r\nVesuvius cast up ashes, impregnated with nitrous, saline, and bituminous\r\nsulphur, which upon linen garments took the form of crosses, probably\r\ndirected by the cross-threads in the linen, and therefore that the salts\r\ndid not shoot into such a shape when they fell upon garments of woollen;\r\na very particular description of these crosses may be found in page 38,\r\nof the abovementioned book.\r\n\r\n[15] I have since found in this stratum of erupted matter at Pompeii,\r\nstones weighing eight pounds: but many accounts of the great eruption of\r\nVesuvius, particularly that of Antonio Bulifon, mention that a stone\r\nlike a bomb was thrown from the crater of Vesuvius in 1631; and fell\r\nupon the Marquis of Lauro's house at Nola, which it set on fire. As Nola\r\nis twelve miles from Vesuvius, this circumstance seems rather\r\nextraordinary: however, I have seen stones of an enormous size shot up\r\nto a very great height by Mount Vesuvius. In May 1771, having a stop\r\nwatch in my hand, I observed that one of these stones was eleven seconds\r\nfalling from its greatest height, into the crater from whence it had\r\nbeen ejected. In 1767, a solid stone, measuring twelve feet in height,\r\nand forty-five in circumference, was thrown a quarter of a mile from the\r\ncrater; the eruption of 1767, though by much the most violent of this\r\ncentury, was, comparatively to those of the year 79 and 1631, very mild.\r\n\r\n[16] See Letter V. in this collection.\r\n\r\n[17] It is the common received opinion, that this mountain rose from the\r\nbottom of the Lucrine lake. I had not seen the very curious and\r\nparticular account of its formation (which account is in my next letter)\r\nwhen I wrote this, and was therefore in the same error.\r\n\r\n[18] This must depend greatly upon the quality of the lava's; some have\r\nbeen in a more perfect state of vitrification than others, and are\r\nconsequently less liable to the impressions of time. I have often\r\nobserved on Mount Vesuvius, when I have been close to the mouth from\r\nwhence a lava was disgorging itself, that the quality of it varied\r\ngreatly from time to time: I have seen it as fluid and coherent as glass\r\nwhen in fusion: and I have seen it farinacious, the particles separating\r\nas they forced their way out, just like meal coming from under the\r\ngrindstones. A stream of lava of this sort, being less compact, and\r\ncontinuing more earthy particles, would certainly be much sooner fit for\r\nvegetation, than one composed of the more perfect vitrified matter.\r\n\r\n[19] This earthquake happened in the year 1693, and destroyed forty-nine\r\ntowns and villages, nine hundred and twenty-two churches, colleges, and\r\nconvents; and near one hundred thousand persons were buried in their\r\nruin.\r\n\r\n[20] It is intituled, \"A true and exact relation of the late prodigious\r\nearthquake and eruption of Mount AEtna, or Monte Gibello; as it came in a\r\nletter written to his Majesty from Naples, by the Right Honourable the\r\nEarl of Winchelsea, his Majesty's late Embassador at Constantinople,\r\nwho, in his return from thence, visiting Catania in the island of\r\nSicily, was an eye-witness of that dreadful spectacle; together with a\r\nmore particular narrative of the same, as it is collected out of the\r\nseveral relations sent from Catania; published by authority.

Newcomb, in the Savoy, 1669.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accepted, says the author, p. 38, the invitation of the Bishop of\r\nCatania, to stay a day with him, that so I might be the better able to\r\ninform your Majesty of that extraordinary fire, which comes from Mount\r\nGibel, fifteen miles distant from that city, which, for its horridness\r\nin the aspect, for the vast quantity thereof (for it is fifteen miles in\r\nlength, and seven in breadth), for its monstrous devastation and quick\r\nprogress, may be termed an inundation of fire, a flood of fire, cinders,\r\nand burning stones, burning with that rage as to advance into the sea\r\nsix hundred yards, and that to a mile in breadth, which I saw; and that\r\nwhich did augment my admiration was, to see in the sea this matter like\r\nragged rocks, burning in four fathom water, two fathom higher than the\r\nsea itself, some parts liquid, and throwing off, not with great\r\nviolence, the stones about it, which, like a crust of a vast bigness,\r\nand red hot, fell into the sea every moment, in some place or other,\r\ncausing a great and horrible noise, smoak, and hissing in the sea; and\r\nthat more and more coming after it, making a firm foundation in the sea\r\nitself. I stayed there from nine a clock on Saturday morning, to seven\r\nnext morning;\" (this must have been towards the middle or latter end of\r\nApril;) \"and this mountain of fire and stones with cinders had advanced\r\ninto the sea twenty yards at least, in several places; in the middle of\r\nthis fire, which burnt in the sea, it hath formed like to a river, with\r\nits banks on each side very steep and craggy; and in this channel moves\r\nthe greatest quantity of this fire, which is the most liquid, with\r\nstones of the same composition, and cinders all red hot, swimming upon\r\nthe fire of a great magnitude; from this a river of fire doth proceed\r\nunder the great mass of the stones, which are generally three fathoms\r\nhigh all over the country, where it burns, and in other places much\r\nmore. There are secret conduits or rivulets of the liquid matter, which\r\ncommunicates fire and heat into all parts more or less, and melts the\r\nstones and cinders by fits in those places where it toucheth them, over\r\nand over again; where it meets with rocks or houses of the same matter\r\n(as many are), they melt and go away with the fire; where they find\r\nother compositions, they turn them to lime or ashes (as I am informed).\r\nThe composition of this fire, stones, and cinders, are sulphur, nitre,\r\nquicksilver, sal ammoniac, lead, iron, brass, and all other metals. It\r\nmoves not regularly, nor constantly down hill[48]; in some places it\r\nhath made the vallies hills, and the hills that are not high are now\r\nvallies. When it was night, I went upon two towers, in divers places;\r\nand could plainly see at ten miles distance, as we judged, the fire to\r\nbegin to run from the mountain in a direct line, the flame to ascend as\r\nhigh and as big as one of the greatest steeples in your Majesty's\r\nkingdoms, and to throw up great stones into the air; I could discern the\r\nriver of fire to descend the mountain of a terrible fiery or red colour,\r\nand stones of a paler red to swim thereon, and to be some as big as an\r\nordinary table. We could see this fire to move in several other places,\r\nand all the country covered with fire, ascending with great flames[49],\r\nin many places, smoaking like to a violent furnace of iron melted,\r\nmaking a noise with the great pieces that fell, especially those which\r\nfell into the sea. A Cavalier of Malta, who lives there, and attended\r\nme, told me, that the river was as liquid where it issues out of the\r\nmountain, as water, and came out like a torrent with great violence, and\r\nis five or six fathom deep, and as broad, and that no stones sink\r\ntherein. I assure your Majesty, no pen can express how terrible it is,\r\nnor can all the art and industry of the world quench or divert that\r\nwhich is burning in the country. In forty days time, it hath destroyed\r\nthe habitations of 27,000 persons; made two hills of one, 1000 paces\r\nhigh apiece, and one is four miles in compass; of 20,000 persons, which\r\ninhabit Catania, 3000 did only remain; all their goods are carried away,\r\nthe cannons of brass are removed out of the castle, some great bells\r\ntaken down, the city-gates walled up next the fire, and preparations\r\nmade to abandon the city.\r\n\r\n\"That night which I lay there, it rained ashes all over the city, and\r\nten miles at sea it troubled my eyes. This fire in its progress met with\r\na lake of four miles in compass; and it was not only satisfied to fill\r\nit up, though it was four fathom deep, but hath made of it a mountain.\"\r\n\r\n[21] I have heard since, from some of our countrymen who have measured\r\nthis tree, that its dimensions are actually as abovementioned, but that\r\nthey could perceive some signs of four stems having grown together, and\r\nformed one tree.\r\n\r\n[22] No great stress should be laid upon these observations, as the many\r\ninconveniences we laboured under, and the little practice we had in such\r\nnice operations, must necessarily have rendered them very inaccurate.\r\nThe Canon Recupero, who was our guide, attended Mess. Glover, Fullerton,\r\nand Brydone, up Mount Etna in June 1770. The latter is a very ingenious\r\nand accurate observer, and has taken the height of many of the highest\r\nmountains in the Alps. His observations, as the Canon informed me, were\r\nas follows: At the top of the mountain the quicksilver in the\r\nthermometer was 9 degrees below freezing point, when at the foot of the\r\nmountain it rose to 76. At the foot of the little mountain that crowns\r\nthe Volcano the barometer stood at 20 deg. 4-2/3', half way up this little\r\nmountain it was at 19 deg. 6'; but the wind was too violent for them to\r\nattempt any more observations. The barometer and thermometer were of\r\nFahrenheit's. Mr. Brydone remarked, as he went up in the night, that he\r\ncould distinguish the stars in the milky way with wonderful clearness,\r\nand that the cold was much more intense than he had ever felt upon the\r\nhighest mountains of the Alps.\r\n\r\n[23] This passage, in Cornelius Severus's poem upon Etna, seems to\r\nconfirm my opinion:\r\n\r\n    \"Placantesque etiam caelestia numina thure\r\n    \"Summo cerne jugo, vel qua liberrimus AEtna\r\n    \"Improspectus hiat; tantarum semina rerum\r\n    \"Si nihil irritet flammas, stupeatque profundum.\"\r\n\r\n[24] A better account of the formation of _tufa_ will be seen in my next\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n[25] The dates of the eruptions of Mount Etna, recorded by history, are\r\nas follows: Before the Christian aera four, in the years 3525. 3538.\r\n3554. 3843. After Christ, twenty-seven have been recorded, 1175. 1285.\r\n1321. 1323. 1329. 1408. 1530. 1536. 1537. 1540. 1545. 1554. 1556. 1566.\r\n1579. 1614. 1634. 1636. 1643. 1669. 1682. 1689. 1692. 1702. 1747. 1755.\r\n1766.\r\n\r\nThe dates of the eruptions of Vesuvius are as follows: After Christ--79.\r\n203. 472. 512. 685. 993. 1036. 1043. 1048. 1136. 1506. [1538, the\r\neruption at Puzzole.] 1631. 1660. 1682. 1694. 1701. 1704. 1712. 1717.\r\n1730. 1737. 1751. 1754. 1760. 1766. 1767. 1770. 1771.\r\n\r\n[26] Pliny, in his account of these islands, in the IX chapter of the\r\nthird book of his Natural History, seems to confirm this opinion.\r\n\r\n\"Lipara cum civium Romanorum oppido, dicta a Liparo rege, qui successit\r\nAEolo, antea Melogonis vel Meliganis vocitata, abest XII millia pass. ab\r\nItalia, ipsa circuitu paulo minori. Inter hanc et Siciliam altera, antea\r\nTherasia appellata, nunc Hiera; qui sacra Vulcano est, colle in ea\r\nnocturnas evomente flammas. Tertia Strongyle, a Lipara millia passuum ad\r\nexortum solis vergens, in qua regnavit AEolus, quae a Lipara liquidiore\r\nflamma tantum differt: e cujus fumo equinam flaturi sint venti, in\r\ntriduum praedicere incolae traduntur; unde ventos AEolo paruisse\r\nexistimatum. Quarta Didyme, minor quam Lipara. Quinta Ericusa; sexta\r\nPhoenicusa; pabulo proximarum relicta. NOVISSIMA, eademque Minima,\r\nEvonymos.\"\r\n\r\n[27] See Plate V.\r\n\r\n[28] The Abate Giulio Cesare Bruccini describes very elegantly, in his\r\naccount of the eruption of Vesuvius in 1631, his having made an\r\nobservation of the like nature--his words are (after having\r\nparticularized the different strata of erupted matter lying one over\r\nanother)--\"parendo appunto che la natura ci abbia voluto lasciare\r\nscritto in questa terra tutti gli incendii memorabili raccontati delli\r\nautori.\"\r\n\r\n[29] These are his words, book II. chap. vi.\r\n\r\n\"De Pulvere Puteolano.\r\n\r\n\"Est etiam genus pulveris, quod efficit naturaliter res admirandas.\r\nNascitur in regionibus Baianis, et in agris municipiorum, quae sunt circa\r\nVesuvium montem, quod commixtum cum calce et caemento non modo caeteris\r\naedificiis praestat firmitates, sed etiam moles, quae construuntur in mari,\r\nsub aqua solidescunt. Hoc autem fieri hac ratione videtur, quod sub his\r\nmontibus et terra ferventes sunt fontes crebri, qui non essent, si non\r\nin imo haberent, aut de sulfure, aut alumine, aut bitumine ardentes\r\nmaximos ignes: igitur penitus ignis, et flammae vapor per intervenia\r\npermanans et ardens, efficet levem eam terram, et ibi, qui nascitur\r\ntophus, exugens est, et sine liquore. Ergo cum tres res consimili\r\nratione, ignis vehementia formatae in unam pervenerint mixtionem, repente\r\nrecepto liquore una cohaerescunt, et celeriter humore duratae solidantur,\r\nneque eas fluctus, neque vis aquae potest dissolvere.\"\r\n\r\nAbout Baia, Puzzole, and Naples, we have an opportunity of remarking the\r\ntruth of these last words. Several of the piers of the ancient harbour\r\nof Puzzole, vulgarly called Caligula's bridge, and which are composed of\r\nbricks joined with this sort of cement, are still standing in the sea,\r\nthough much exposed to the waves; and upon every part of the shore you\r\nfind large masses of brick-walls rounded and polished by friction in the\r\nsea, the brick and mortar making one body, and appearing like a\r\nvariegated stone. Large pieces of old walls are likewise often cut out\r\ninto square pieces, and made use of in modern buildings instead of\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nSoon after the first quotation, Pliny says, \"Si ergo in his locis\r\naquarum ferventes inveniuntur fontes, et in montibus excavatis calidi\r\nvapores, ipsaque loca ab antiquis memorantur pervagantes in agris\r\nhabuisse ardores, videtur esse certum ab ignis vehementia ex topho\r\nterraque, quemadmodum in fornacibus et a calce, ita ex his ereptum esse\r\nliquorem. Igitur dissimilibus, et disparibus rebus correptis, et in unam\r\npotestatem collatis, callida humoris jejunitas aqua repente satiata,\r\ncommunibus corporibus latenti calore confervescit et vehementer effecit\r\nea coire, celeriterque una soliditatis percipere virtutem.\"\r\n\r\n[30] Scipione Falcone, a very good observer, in his _Discorso naturale\r\ndelli cause et effetti del Vesuvio_, says, that he saw, after the\r\neruption of Vesuvius in 1631 (which was attended with hot water), the\r\nmud harden almost to a stone in a few days; his words are these--\"fatta\r\ndura a modo di calcina e di pietra non altrimenti di cenere, perche dopo\r\nalcuni giorni vi ci e caminato per sopra e si e conosciuta durissima che\r\nci vogliono li picconi per romperla.\" This account, with other\r\ncircumstances mentioned in this letter, make it highly probable, that\r\nall the _tufas_ in the neighbourhood of Vesuvius have been formed by a\r\nlike operation.\r\n\r\n[31] This piece is now in the Museum of the Royal Society, together with\r\nother specimens, mentioned in this and in the following letter. M. M.\r\n\r\n[32] Letter IV.\r\n\r\n[33] Strabo, in his fifth book of Geography, says, \"Supra haec loca situs\r\nest Vesuvius mons agris cinctus optimis: dempto vertice, qui magna sui\r\nparte planus, totus sterilis est, adspectu cinaereus, cavernasque\r\nostendens fistularum plenas et lapidum colore fuliginoso, utpote ab igni\r\nexesorum, ut conjecturam facere possit ista loca quondam arsisse, et\r\ncrateras ignis habuisse, deinde materia deficiente restincta fuisse.\"\r\n\r\nDiodorus Siculus, in his fourth book, describing the voyage of Hercules\r\ninto Italy, says, \"Phlegraeus quoque campus is locus appellatur a colle\r\nnimirum, qui AEtnae instar Siculae magnam vim ignis eructabat; nunc\r\nVesuvius nominatur, multa inflammationis pristinae vestigia reservans.\"\r\nAnd Vitruvius, in the sixth chapter of the second book, says, \"Non minus\r\netiam memoratur antiquitus crevisse ardores et abundasse sub Vesuvio\r\nmonte et inde evomuisse circa agros flammas.\" Tacitus, mentioning the\r\neruption of Vesuvius in the reign of Titus, seems to hint likewise at\r\nformer eruptions, in these words: \"Jam vero novis cladibus, vel post\r\nlongam saeculorum repetitis afflictae, haustae aut abrutae fecundissima\r\nCampaniae ora et urbs incendiis vastata.\"\r\n\r\n[34] Bracini, in his account of the eruption of 1613, says, that he\r\nfound many sorts of sea shells on Vesuvius after that eruption; and P.\r\nIgnatio, in his account of the same eruption, says, that he and his\r\ncompanions picked up many shells likewise at that time upon the\r\nmountain: this circumstance would induce one to believe, that the water\r\nthrown out of Vesuvius, during that formidable eruption, came from the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n[35] In book xi. c. 93. he observes, that about Sinuessa and Puteoli,\r\n\"Spiracula vocant--alii Caroneas scrobes, mortiferum spiritum\r\nexhalantes.\" And Seneca, Nat. Quaest. lib. vi. cap. 28. \"Pluribus Italiae\r\nlocis per quaedam foramina pestilens exhalatur vapor, quem non homini\r\nducere, non ferae tutum est. Aves quoque si in illum inciderint, antequam\r\ncoelo meliore leniatur, in ipso volatu cadunt, liventque corpora, et non\r\naliter quam per vim elisae fauces tument.\"\r\n\r\n[36] I have remarked, that, after a great fall of rain, the degree of\r\nheat in this water is much less, which will account for what the Padre\r\nTorre says (in his book, entituled, _Histoire et Phenomenes du Vesuve_),\r\nthat, when he tried it in company with Monsieur de la Condamine, the\r\ndegree of heat, upon Reaumur's thermometer, was 68 deg.\r\n\r\n[37] This very scarce volume has been presented by Sir William Hamilton\r\nto the British Museum. M. M.\r\n\r\n[38] Here again we have an example of the electrical fire attending a\r\ngreat eruption.\r\n\r\n[39] The cup, or crater, on the top of the new mountain is now covered\r\nwith shrubs; but I discovered at the bottom of it, in the year 1770,\r\namidst the bushes, a small hole, which exhales a constant hot and damp\r\nvapour, just such as proceeds from boiling water, and with as little\r\nsmell; the drops of this steam hang upon the neighbouring bushes.\r\n\r\n[40] The noxious vapours which Lucan mentions to have prevailed at\r\nNisida, favour my opinion as to its origin:\r\n\r\n            \"--Tali spiramine Nesis\r\n    \"Emittit stygium nebulosis aera saxis.\"\r\n\r\n                              Lucan. lib. vi.\r\n\r\n[41] Giulio Cesare Capaccio, in his account of this island, says, that\r\nthere are eleven springs of cold water, and thirty-five of hot and\r\nmineral waters.\r\n\r\n[42] By having remarked, that all the implements of stone brought by\r\nMess. Banks and Solander from the new-discovered islands in the\r\nSouth-Seas, are evidently of such a nature as are only produced by\r\nVolcanos; and as these gentlemen have assured me, that no other kind of\r\nstone is to be met with in the islands; I am induced to think, that\r\nthese islands (at so great a distance from any continent) may have\r\nlikewise been pushed up from the bottom of the sea by like explosions.\r\n\r\n[43] Any one, the least conversant in Volcanos, must be struck with the\r\nnumberless evident marks of them the whole road from the lake of Albano\r\nto Radicofani, between Naples and Florence; and yet, though this soil\r\nbears such fresh and undoubted marks of its origin, no history reaches\r\nthe date of any one eruption in these parts.\r\n\r\n[44] May not the air in countries replete with sulphur be more\r\nimpregnated with electrical matter than the air of other soils? and may\r\nnot the sort of lightning, which is mentioned by several ancient authors\r\nto have fallen in a serene day, and was considered as an omen, have\r\nproceeded from such a cause?\r\n\r\nHorace says, Ode xxxiv.\r\n\r\n            \"--Namque Diespeter\r\n    \"Igni corusco nubila dividens\r\n      \"Plerumque per purum tonantes\r\n        \"Egit equos volucremque currum.\"\r\n\r\n      \"Non alias coelo ceciderunt plura sereno\r\n      \"Fulgura----\"\r\n\r\n                              Virgil. Georgic. i.\r\n\r\n    \"Aut cum terribili perculsus fulmine civis\r\n    \"Luce serenanti vitalia lumina liquit.\"\r\n\r\n                              Cic. i. de Divin. n. 18.\r\n\r\n  \"--Sabinos petit aliquanto tristior, quod sacrificanti hostia\r\n  aufugerat: quodque tempestate serena tonuerat.\"\r\n\r\n                              Sueton. _Tit._ cap. 10.\r\n\r\n[45] This letter was not received by Dr. Maty in its present form: and\r\nis rather the substance of an explanatory catalogue, which was sent to\r\nthat gentleman with sundry specimens of the different materials that\r\ncompose the soil described in the preceding letter; which catalogue\r\nremains, with the specimens, in the Museum of the Royal Society, for the\r\ninspection, and, I flatter myself, the satisfaction, of the curious in\r\nnatural history.\r\n\r\n[46] See p. 103 of this collection.\r\n\r\n[47] See Letter I. p. 18.\r\n\r\n[48] Having heard the same remark with respect to the lava's of\r\nVesuvius, I determined, during an eruption of that Volcano, to watch the\r\nprogress of a current of lava, and I was soon enabled to comprehend this\r\nseeming phaenomenon; though it is, I fear, very difficult to explain.\r\nCertain it is, that the lava's, whilst in their most fluid state, follow\r\nalways the law of other fluids; but when at a great distance from their\r\nsource, and consequently incumbered with scoriae and cinders, the air\r\nlikewise having rendered their outward coat tough, they will sometimes\r\n(as I have seen) be forced up a short ascent, the fresh matter pushing\r\nforward that which went before it, and the exterior parts of the lava\r\nacting always as conductors (or pipes, if I may be allowed the\r\nexpression), for the interior parts, that have retained their fluidity\r\nby not having been exposed to the air.\r\n\r\n[49] The flames Lord Winchelsea mentions, were certainly produced by the\r\nlava having met with trees in the way; or perhaps his Lordship may have\r\nmistaken the white smoak which constantly rises from a lava (and in the\r\nnight is tinged by the reflection of the red hot matter), for flame, of\r\nwhich indeed it has greatly the appearance at a distance. I have\r\nobserved upon Mount Vesuvius, that, soon after a lava has borne down and\r\nburned a tree, a bright flame issues from its surface; otherwise I have\r\nnever seen any flame attending an eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTED from NAPLES,\r\n\r\nBy T.
