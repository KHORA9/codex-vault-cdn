He had been reared\r\namong surroundings of culture plus and ultra-intellectuality in the\r\nexclusive Back Bay home of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nHe had been taught to look with contempt upon all that savored of\r\nmuscular superiority--such things were gross, brutal, primitive.\r\n\r\nIt had been a giant intellect only that he had craved--he and a fond\r\nmother--and their wishes had been fulfilled. At twenty-one Waldo was an\r\nanimated encyclopedia--and about as muscular as a real one.\r\n\r\nNow he slunk shivering with fright at the very edge of the beach, as\r\nfar from the grim forest as he could get.\r\n\r\nCold sweat broke from every pore of his long, lank, six-foot-two\r\nbody. His skinny arms and legs trembled as with palsy. Occasionally\r\nhe coughed--it had been the cough that had banished him upon this\r\nill-starred sea voyage.\r\n\r\nAs he crouched in the sand, staring with wide, horror-dilated eyes into\r\nthe black night, great tears rolled down his thin, white cheeks.\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty that he restrained an overpowering desire\r\nto shriek. His mind was filled with forlorn regrets that he had\r\nnot remained at home to meet the wasting death that the doctor had\r\npredicted--a peaceful death at least--not the brutal end which faced\r\nhim now.\r\n\r\nThe lazy swell of the South Pacific lapped his legs, stretched upon\r\nthe sand, for he had retreated before that menacing shadow as far as\r\nthe ocean would permit. As the slow minutes dragged into age-long\r\nhours, the nervous strain told so heavily upon the weak boy that toward\r\nmidnight he lapsed into merciful unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe warm sun awoke him the following morning, but it brought with it\r\nbut a faint renewal of courage. Things could not creep to his side\r\nunseen now, but still they could come, for the sun would not protect\r\nhim. Even now some savage beast might be lurking just within the forest.\r\n\r\nThe thought unnerved him to such an extent that he dared not venture\r\nto the woods for the fruit that had formed the major portion of his\r\nsustenance. Along the beach he picked up a few mouthfuls of sea-food,\r\nbut that was all.\r\n\r\nThe day passed, as had the other terrible days which had preceded it,\r\nin scanning alternately the ocean and the forest's edge--the one for a\r\nship and the other for the cruel death which he momentarily expected to\r\nsee stalk out of the dreary shades to claim him.\r\n\r\nA more practical and a braver man would have constructed some manner\r\nof shelter in which he might have spent his nights in comparative\r\nsafety and comfort, but Waldo Emerson's education had been conducted\r\nalong lines of undiluted intellectuality--pursuits and knowledge which\r\nwere practical were commonplace, and commonplaces were vulgar. It\r\nwas preposterous that a Smith-Jones should ever have need of vulgar\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nFor the twenty-second time since the great wave had washed him from\r\nthe steamer's deck and hurled him, choking and sputtering, upon this\r\ninhospitable shore, Waldo Emerson saw the sun sinking rapidly toward\r\nthe western horizon.\r\n\r\nAs it descended the young man's terror increased, and he kept his eyes\r\nglued upon the spot from which the shadow had emerged the previous\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nHe felt that he could not endure another night of the torture he\r\nhad passed through four times before. That he should go mad he was\r\npositive, and he commenced to tremble and whimper even while daylight\r\nyet remained. For a time he tried turning his back to the forest, and\r\nthen he sat huddled up gazing out upon the ocean; but the tears which\r\nrolled down his cheeks so blurred his eyes that he saw nothing.\r\n\r\nFinally he could endure it no longer, and with a sudden gasp of horror\r\nhe wheeled toward the wood. There was nothing visible, yet he broke\r\ndown and sobbed like a child, for loneliness and terror.\r\n\r\nWhen he was able to control his tears for a moment he took the\r\nopportunity to scan the deepening shadows once more.\r\n\r\nThe first glance brought a piercing shriek from his white lips.\r\n\r\nThe thing was there!\r\n\r\nThe young man did not fall groveling to the sand this time--instead,\r\nhe stood staring with protruding eyes at the vague form, while shriek\r\nafter shriek broke from his grinning lips.\r\n\r\nReason was tottering.\r\n\r\nThe thing, whatever it was, halted at the first blood-curdling cry, and\r\nthen when the cries continued it slunk back toward the wood.\r\n\r\nWith what remained of his ebbing mentality Waldo Emerson realized that\r\nit were better to die at once than face the awful fears of the black\r\nnight. He would rush to meet his fate, and thus end this awful agony of\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\nWith the thought came action, so that, still shrieking, he rushed\r\nheadlong toward the thing at the wood's rim. As he ran it turned and\r\nfled into the forest, and after it went Waldo Emerson, his long, skinny\r\nlegs carrying his emaciated body in great leaps and bounds through the\r\ntearing underbrush.\r\n\r\nHe emitted shriek after shriek--ear-piercing shrieks that ended in long\r\ndrawn out wails, more wolfish than human. And the thing that fled\r\nthrough the night before him was shrieking, too, now.\r\n\r\nTime and again the young man stumbled and fell. Thorns and brambles\r\ntore his clothing and his soft flesh. Blood smeared him from head to\r\nfeet. Yet on and on he rushed through the semidarkness of the now\r\nmoonlit forest.\r\n\r\nAt first impelled by the mad desire to embrace death and wrest the\r\npeace of oblivion from its cruel clutch, Waldo Emerson had come to\r\npursue the screaming shadow before him from an entirely different\r\nmotive. Now it was for companionship. He screamed now because of a fear\r\nthat the thing would elude him and that he should be left alone in the\r\ndepth of this weird wood.\r\n\r\nSlowly but surely it was drawing away from him, and as Waldo Emerson\r\nrealized the fact he redoubled his efforts to overtake it. He had\r\nstopped screaming now, for the strain of his physical exertion found\r\nhis weak lungs barely adequate to the needs of his gasping respiration.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the pursuit emerged from the forest to cross a little moonlit\r\nclearing, at the opposite side of which towered a high and rocky cliff.\r\nToward this the fleeing creature sped, and in an instant more was\r\nswallowed, apparently, by the face of the cliff.\r\n\r\nIts disappearance was as mysterious and awesome as its identity had\r\nbeen, and left the young man in blank despair.\r\n\r\nWith the object of pursuit gone, the reaction came, and Waldo Emerson\r\nsank trembling and exhausted at the foot of the cliff. A paroxysm of\r\ncoughing seized him, and thus he lay in an agony of apprehension,\r\nfright, and misery until from very weakness he sank into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was daylight when he awoke--stiff, lame, sore, hungry, and\r\nmiserable--but, withal, refreshed and sane. His first consideration\r\nwas prompted by the craving of a starved stomach; yet it was with the\r\nutmost difficulty that he urged his cowardly brain to direct his steps\r\ntoward the forest, where hung fruit in abundance.\r\n\r\nAt every little noise he halted in tense silence, poised to flee. His\r\nknees trembled so violently that they knocked together; but at length\r\nhe entered the dim shadows, and presently was gorging himself with ripe\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nTo reach some of the more luscious viands he had picked from the ground\r\na piece of fallen limb, which tapered from a diameter of four inches\r\nat one end to a trifle over an inch at the other. It was the first\r\npractical thing that Waldo Emerson had done since he had been cast upon\r\nthe shore of his new home--in fact, it was, in all likelihood, the\r\nnearest approximation to a practical thing which he had ever done in\r\nall his life.\r\n\r\nWaldo had never been allowed to read fiction, nor had he ever cared to\r\nso waste his time or impoverish his brain, and nowhere in the fund of\r\ndeep erudition which he had accumulated could he recall any condition\r\nanalogous to those which now confronted him.\r\n\r\nWaldo, of course, knew that there were such things as step-ladders,\r\nand had he had one he would have used it as a means to reach the fruit\r\nabove his hand's reach; but that he could knock the delicacies down\r\nwith a broken branch seemed indeed a mighty discovery--a valuable\r\naddition to the sum total of human knowledge. Aristotle himself had\r\nnever reasoned more logically.\r\n\r\nWaldo had taken the first step in his life toward independent mental\r\naction--heretofore his ideas, his thoughts, his acts, even, had been\r\nborrowed from the musty writing of the ancients, or directed by the\r\nimmaculate mind of his superior mother. And he clung to his discovery\r\nas a child clings to a new toy.\r\n\r\nWhen he emerged from the forest he brought his stick with him.\r\n\r\nHe determined to continue the pursuit of the creature that had eluded\r\nhim the night before. It would, indeed, be curious to look upon a thing\r\nthat feared him.\r\n\r\nIn all his life he had never imagined it possible that any creature\r\ncould flee from him in fear. A little glow suffused the young man as\r\nthe idea timorously sought to take root.\r\n\r\nCould it be that there was a trace of swagger in that long, bony figure\r\nas Waldo directed his steps toward the cliff? Perish the thought! Pride\r\nin vulgar physical prowess! A long line of Smith-Joneses would have\r\nrisen in their graves and rent their shrouds at the veriest hint of\r\nsuch an idea.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Waldo walked back and forth along the foot of the\r\ncliff, searching for the avenue of escape used by the fugitive of\r\nyesternight. A dozen times he passed a well-defined trail that led,\r\nwinding, up the cliff's face; but Waldo knew nothing of trails--he was\r\nlooking for a flight of steps or a doorway.\r\n\r\nFinding neither, he stumbled by accident into the trail; and, although\r\nthe evident signs that marked it as such revealed nothing to him, yet\r\nhe followed it upward for the simple reason that it was the only place\r\nupon the cliff side where he could find a foothold.\r\n\r\nSome distance up he came to a narrow cleft in the cliff into which the\r\ntrail led. Rocks dislodged from above had fallen into it, and, becoming\r\nwedged a few feet from the bottom, left only a small cavelike hole,\r\ninto which Waldo peered.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing visible, but the interior was dark and forbidding.\r\nWaldo felt cold and clammy. He began to tremble. Then he turned and\r\nlooked back toward the forest.\r\n\r\nThe thought of another night spent within sight of that dismal place\r\nalmost overcame him. No! A thousand times no! Any fate were better than\r\nthat, and so after several futile efforts he forced his unwilling body\r\nthrough the small aperture.\r\n\r\nHe found himself on a path between two rocky walls--a path that rose\r\nbefore him at a steep angle. At intervals the blue sky was visible\r\nabove through openings that had not been filled with debris.\r\n\r\nTo another it would have been apparent that the cleft had been kept\r\nopen by human beings--that it was a thoroughfare which was used, if not\r\nfrequently, at least sufficiently often to warrant considerable labor\r\nhaving been expended upon it to keep it free from the debris which must\r\nbe constantly falling from above.\r\n\r\nWhere the path led, or what he expected to find at the other end, Waldo\r\nhad not the remotest idea. He was not an imaginative youth. But he kept\r\non up the ascent in the hope that at the end he would find the creature\r\nwhich had escaped him the night before.\r\n\r\nAs it had fled for a brief instant across the clearing beneath\r\nthe moon's soft rays, Waldo had thought that it bore a remarkable\r\nresemblance to a human figure; but of that he could not be positive.\r\n\r\nAt last his path broke suddenly into the sunlight. The walls on either\r\nside were but little higher than his head, and a moment later he\r\nemerged from the cleft onto a broad and beautiful plateau.\r\n\r\nBefore him stretched a wide, grassy plain, and beyond towered a range\r\nof mighty hills. Between them and him lay a belt of forest.\r\n\r\nA new emotion welled in the breast of Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones. It\r\nwas akin to that which Balboa may have felt when he gazed for the\r\nfirst time upon the mighty Pacific from the Sierra de Quarequa. For\r\nthe moment, as he contemplated this new and beautiful scene of rolling\r\nmeadowland, distant forest, and serrated hill-tops, he almost forgot\r\nto be afraid. And on the impulse of the instant he set out across the\r\ntableland to explore the unknown which lay beyond the forest.\r\n\r\nWell it was for Waldo Emerson's peace of mind that no faint conception\r\nof what lay there entered his unimaginative mind. To him a land without\r\ncivilization--without cities and towns peopled by humans with manners\r\nand customs similar to those which obtain in Boston--was beyond belief.\r\n\r\nAs he walked he strained his eyes in every direction for some\r\nindication of human habitation--a fence, a chimney--anything that\r\nwould be man-built; but his efforts were unrewarded.\r\n\r\nAt the verge of the forest he halted, fearing to enter; but at last,\r\nwhen he saw that the wood was more open than that near the ocean, and\r\nthat there was but little underbrush, he mustered sufficient courage to\r\nstep timidly within.\r\n\r\nOn careful tiptoe he threaded his way through the park-like grove,\r\nstopping every few minutes to listen, and ready at the first note of\r\ndanger to fly screaming toward the open plain.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his fears, he reached the opposite boundary of the\r\nforest without seeing or hearing anything to arouse suspicion, and,\r\nemerging from the cool shade, found himself a little distance from a\r\nperpendicular white cliff, the face of which was honeycombed with the\r\nmouths of many caves.\r\n\r\nThere was no living creature in sight, nor did the very apparent\r\nartificiality of the caves suggest to the impractical Waldo that they\r\nmight be the habitations of perhaps savage human beings.\r\n\r\nWith the spell of discovery still upon him, he crossed the open toward\r\nthe cliffs; but he had by no means forgotten his chronic state of\r\nabject fear. Ears and eyes were alert for hidden dangers; every few\r\nsteps were punctuated by a timid halt and a searching survey of his\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nIt was during one of these halts, when he had crossed half the distance\r\nbetween the forest and the cliff, that he discerned a slight movement\r\nin the wood behind him.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he stood staring and frozen, unable to determine whether\r\nhe had been mistaken or really had seen a creature moving in the forest.\r\n\r\nHe had about decided that he had but imagined a presence when a great,\r\nhairy brute of a man stepped suddenly from behind the bole of a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE WILD PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe creature was naked except for a bit of hide that hung from a\r\nleathern waist thong.\r\n\r\nIf Waldo viewed the newcomer with wonder, it was no less than the\r\nwonder which the sight of him inspired in the breast of the hairy\r\none, for what he saw was as truly remarkable to his eyes as was his\r\nappearance to those of the cultured Bostonian. And Waldo did indeed\r\npresent a most startling exterior. His six-feet-two was accentuated by\r\nhis extreme skinniness; his gray eyes looked weak and watery within the\r\ninflamed circles which rimmed them, and which had been produced by loss\r\nof sleep and much weeping.\r\n\r\nHis yellow hair was tangled and matted, and streaked with dirt and\r\nblood. Blood stained his soiled and tattered ducks. His shirt was but a\r\nmass of frayed ribbons held to him at all only by the neckband.\r\n\r\nAs he stood helplessly staring with bulging eyes at the awful figure\r\nglowering at him from the forest his jaw dropped, his knees trembled,\r\nand he seemed about to collapse from sheer terror.\r\n\r\nThen the hideous man crouched and came creeping warily toward him.\r\n\r\nWith an agonized scream Waldo turned and fled toward the cliff. A quick\r\nglance over his shoulder brought another series of shrieks from the\r\nfrightened fugitive, for it revealed not alone the fact that the awful\r\nman was pursuing him, but that behind him raced at least a dozen more\r\nequally frightful.\r\n\r\nWaldo ran toward the cliffs only because that direction lay straight\r\naway from his pursuers. He had no idea what he should do when he\r\nreached the rocky barrier--he was far too frightened to think.\r\n\r\nHis pursuers were gaining upon him, their savage yells mingling with\r\nhis piercing cries and spurring him on to undreamed-of pinnacles of\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nAs he ran, his knees came nearly to his shoulders at each frantic\r\nbound; his left hand was extended far ahead, clutching wildly at the\r\nair as though he were endeavoring to pull himself ahead, while his\r\nright hand, still grasping the cudgel, described a rapid circle, like\r\nthe arm of a windmill gone mad. In action Waldo was an inspiring\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the cliff he came to a momentary halt, while he glanced\r\nhurriedly about for a means of escape; but now he saw that the enemy\r\nhad spread out toward the right and left, leaving no means of escape\r\nexcept up the precipitous side of the cliff. Up this narrow trails led\r\nsteeply from ledge to ledge.\r\n\r\nIn places crude ladders scaled perpendicular heights from one tier of\r\ncaves to the next above; but to Waldo the thing which confronted him\r\nseemed absolutely unscalable, and then another backward glance showed\r\nhim the rapidly nearing enemy; and he launched himself at the face of\r\nthat seemingly impregnable barrier, clutching desperately with fingers\r\nand toes.\r\n\r\nHis progress was impeded by the cudgel to which he still clung, but\r\nhe did not drop it; though why it would have been difficult to tell,\r\nunless it was that his acts were now purely mechanical, there being no\r\nroom in his mind for aught else than terror.\r\n\r\nClose behind him came the foremost cave man; yet, though he had\r\nacquired the agility of a monkey through a lifetime of practice, he\r\nwas amazed at the uncanny speed with which Waldo Emerson clawed his\r\nshrieking way aloft.\r\n\r\nHalf-way up the ascent, however, a great hairy hand came almost to his\r\nankle.\r\n\r\nIt was during the perilous negotiation of one of the loose and wabbly\r\nladders--little more than small trees leaning precariously against the\r\nperpendicular rocky surface--that the nearest foeman came so close to\r\nthe fugitive; but at the top chance intervened to save Waldo, for a\r\ntime at least. It was at the moment that he scrambled frantically to a\r\ntiny ledge from the frightfully slipping sapling.\r\n\r\nIn his haste he did by accident what a resourceful man would have done\r\nby intent--in pushing himself onto the ledge he kicked the ladder\r\noutward--for a second it hung toppling in the balance, and then with a\r\nlunge crashed down the cliff's face with its human burden, in its fall\r\nscraping others of the pursuing horde with it.\r\n\r\nA chorus of rage came up from below him, but Waldo had not even turned\r\nhis head to learn of his temporary good fortune. Up, ever up he sped,\r\nuntil at length he stood upon the topmost ledge, facing an overhanging\r\nwall of blank rock that towered another twenty-five feet above him to\r\nthe summit of the bluff. Time and again he leaped futilely against the\r\nsmooth surface, tearing at it with his nails in a mad endeavor to climb\r\nstill higher.\r\n\r\nAt his right was the low opening to a black cave, but he did not see\r\nit--his mind could cope with but the single idea: to clamber from\r\nthe horrible creatures which pursued him. But finally it was borne\r\nin on his half-mad brain that this was the end--he could fly no\r\nfarther--here, in a moment more, death would overtake him.\r\n\r\nHe turned to meet it, and below saw a number of the cave men placing\r\nanother ladder in lieu of that which had fallen. In a moment they were\r\nresuming the ascent after him.\r\n\r\nOn the narrow ledge above them the young man stood, chattering and\r\ngrinning like a madman. His pitiful cries were now punctuated with the\r\nhollow coughing which his violent exercise had induced.\r\n\r\nTears rolled down his begrimed face, leaving crooked, muddy streaks in\r\ntheir wake. His knees smote together so violently that he could barely\r\nstand, and it was into the face of this apparition of cowardice that\r\nthe first of the cave men looked as he scrambled above the ledge on\r\nwhich Waldo stood.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of a sudden, there rose within the breast of Waldo Emerson\r\nSmith-Jones a spark that generations of overrefinement and emasculating\r\nculture had all but extinguished--the instinct of self-preservation by\r\nforce. Heretofore it had been purely by flight.\r\n\r\nWith the frenzy of the fear of death upon him, he raised his cudgel,\r\nand, swinging it high above his head, brought it down full upon the\r\nunprotected skull of his enemy.\r\n\r\nAnother took the fallen man's place--he, too, went down with a broken\r\nhead. Waldo was fighting now like a cornered rat, and through it all\r\nhe chattered and gibbered; but he no longer wept.\r\n\r\nAt first he was horrified at the bloody havoc he wrought with his\r\ncrude weapon. His nature revolted at the sight of blood, and when\r\nhe saw it mixed with matted hair along the side of his cudgel, and\r\nrealized that it was human hair and human blood, and that he, Waldo\r\nEmerson Smith-Jones, had struck the blows that had plastered it there\r\nso thickly in all its hideousness, a wave of nausea swept over him, so\r\nthat he almost toppled from his dizzy perch.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes there was a lull in hostilities while the cave men\r\ncongregated below, shaking their fists at Waldo and crying out threats\r\nand challenges. The young man stood looking down upon them, scarcely\r\nable to realize that alone he had met savage men in physical encounter\r\nand defeated them.\r\n\r\nHe was shocked and horrified; not, odd to say, because of the thing he\r\nhad done, but rather because of a strange and unaccountable glow of\r\npride in his brutal supremacy over brutes. What would his mother have\r\nthought could she have seen her precious boy now?\r\n\r\nSuddenly Waldo became conscious from the corner of his eye that\r\nsomething was creeping upon him from behind out of the dark cave before\r\nwhich he had fought. Simultaneously with the realization of it he\r\nswung his cudgel in a wicked blow at this new enemy as he turned to\r\nmeet it.\r\n\r\nThe creature dodged back, and the blow that would have crushed its\r\nskull grazed a hairbreadth from its face.\r\n\r\nWaldo struck no second blow, and the cold sweat sprang to his forehead\r\nwhen he realized how nearly he had come to murdering a young girl.\r\nShe crouched now in the mouth of the cave, eying him fearfully. Waldo\r\nremoved his tattered cap, bowing low.\r\n\r\n\"I crave your pardon,\" he said. \"I had no idea that there was a lady\r\nhere. I am very glad that I did not injure you.\"\r\n\r\nThere must have been something either in his tone or manner that\r\nreassured her, for she smiled and came out upon the ledge beside him.\r\n\r\nAs she did so a scarlet flush mantled Waldo's face and neck and\r\nears--he could feel them burning. With a nervous cough he turned and\r\nbecame intently occupied with the distant scenery.\r\n\r\nPresently he cast a surreptitious glance behind him. Shocking! She was\r\nstill there. Again he coughed nervously.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" he said. \"But--er--ah--you--I am a total stranger, you\r\nknow; hadn't you better go back in, and--er--get your clothes?\"\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, and so he forced himself to turn toward her once\r\nmore. She was smiling at him.\r\n\r\nWaldo had never been so horribly embarrassed in all his life before--it\r\nwas a distinct shock to him to realize that the girl was not\r\nembarrassed at all.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to her a second time, and at last she answered; but in\r\na tongue which he did not understand. It bore not the slightest\r\nresemblance to any language, modern or dead, with which he was\r\nfamiliar, and Waldo was more or less master of them all--especially the\r\ndead ones.\r\n\r\nHe tried not to look at her after that, for he realized that he must\r\nappear very ridiculous.\r\n\r\nBut now his attention was required by more pressing affairs--the cave\r\nmen were returning to the attack. They carried stones this time, and,\r\nwhile some of them threw the missiles at Waldo, the others attempted\r\nto rush his position. It was then that the girl hurried back into the\r\ncave, only to reappear a moment later carrying some stone utensils in\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\nThere was a huge mortar in which she had collected a pestle and several\r\nsmaller pieces of stone. She pushed them along the ledge to Waldo.\r\n\r\nAt first he did not grasp the meaning of her act; but presently she\r\npretended to pick up an imaginary missile and hurl it down upon the\r\ncreatures below--then she pointed to the things she had brought and to\r\nWaldo.\r\n\r\nHe understood. So she was upon his side. He did not understand why, but\r\nhe was glad.\r\n\r\nFollowing her suggestion, he gathered up a couple of the smaller\r\nobjects and hurled them down upon the men beneath.\r\n\r\nBut on and on they came--Waldo was not a very good shot. The girl was\r\nbusy now gathering such of the cave men's missiles as fell upon the\r\nledge. These she placed in a pile beside Waldo.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the young man would strike an enemy by accident, and then\r\nshe would give a little scream of pleasure--clapping her hands and\r\njumping up and down.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Waldo was surprised to find that this applause\r\nfell sweetly upon his ears. It was then that he began to take better\r\naim.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of it all there flashed suddenly upon him a picture of his\r\ndevoted mother and the select coterie of intellectual young people with\r\nwhich she had always surrounded him.\r\n\r\nWaldo felt a new pang of horror as he tried to realize with what\r\nemotions they would look upon him now as he stood upon the face of a\r\ntowering cliff beside an almost naked girl hurling rocks down upon the\r\nheads of hairy men who hopped about, screaming with rage, below him.\r\n\r\nIt was awful! A great billow of mortification rolled over him.\r\n\r\nHe turned to cast a look of disapprobation at the shameless young woman\r\nbehind him--she should not think that he countenanced such coarse and\r\nvulgar proceedings. Their eyes met--in hers he saw the sparkle of\r\nexcitement and the joy of life and such a look of comradeship as he\r\nnever before had seen in the eyes of another mortal.\r\n\r\nThen she pointed excitedly over the edge of the ledge.\r\n\r\nWaldo looked.\r\n\r\nA great brute of a cave man had crawled, unseen, almost to their refuge.\r\n\r\nHe was but five feet below them, and at the moment that he looked up\r\nWaldo dropped a fifty-pound stone mortar full upon his upturned face.\r\n\r\nThe young woman emitted a little shriek of joy, and Waldo Emerson\r\nSmith-Jones, his face bisected by a broad grin, turned toward her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE EDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mortar ended hostilities--temporarily, at least; but the cave\r\nmen loitered about the base of the cliff during the balance of the\r\nafternoon, occasionally shouting taunts at the two above them.\r\n\r\nThese the girl answered, evidently in kind. Sometimes she would point\r\nto Waldo and make ferocious signs, doubtless indicative of the horrible\r\nslaughter which awaited them at his hands if they did not go away and\r\nleave their betters alone. When the young man realized the significance\r\nof her pantomime he felt his heart swell with an emotion which he\r\nfeared was pride in brutal, primitive, vulgar physical prowess.\r\n\r\nAs the long day wore on Waldo became both very hungry and very thirsty.\r\nIn the valley below he could see a tiny brooklet purling, clear and\r\nbeautiful, toward the south. The sight of it drove him nearly mad, as\r\ndid also that of the fruit which he glimpsed hanging ripe for eating at\r\nthe edge of the forest.\r\n\r\nBy means of signs he asked the girl if she, too, were hungry, for he\r\nhad come to a point now where he could look at her almost without\r\nvisible signs of mortification. She nodded her head and, pointing\r\ntoward the descending sun, made it plain to him that after dark they\r\nwould descend and eat.\r\n\r\nThe cave men had not left when darkness came, and it seemed to Waldo a\r\nvery foolhardy thing to venture down while they might be about; but the\r\ngirl made it so evident that she considered him an invincible warrior\r\nthat he was torn with the conflicting emotions of cowardice and an\r\nunaccountable desire to appear well in her eyes, that he might by his\r\nacts justify her belief in him.\r\n\r\nIt seemed very wonderful to Waldo that any one should look upon him\r\nin the light of a tower of strength and a haven of refuge; he was not\r\nquite certain in his own mind but that the reputation might lead him\r\ninto most uncomfortable and embarrassing situations. Incidentally, he\r\nwondered if the girl was a good runner; he hoped so.\r\n\r\nIt must have been quite near midnight when his companion intimated that\r\nthe time had arrived when they should fare forth and dine. Waldo wanted\r\nher to go first, but she shrank close to him, timidly, and held back.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else for it, then, than to take the plunge, though\r\nhad the sun been shining it would have revealed a very pale and\r\nwide-eyed champion, who slipped gingerly over the side of the ledge to\r\ngrope with his feet for a foothold beneath.\r\n\r\nHalf-way down the moon rose above the forest--a great, full, tropic\r\nmoon, that lighted the face of the cliff almost as brilliantly as might\r\nthe sun itself. It shone into the mouth of a cave upon the ledge that\r\nWaldo had just reached in his descent, revealing to the horrified eyes\r\nof the young man a great, hairy form stretched in slumber not a yard\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nAs he looked, the wicked little eyes opened and looked straight into\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nWith difficulty Waldo suppressed a shriek of dismay as he turned to\r\nplunge madly down the precipitous trail. The girl had not yet descended\r\nfrom the ledge above.\r\n\r\nShe must have sensed what had happened, for as Waldo turned to fly she\r\ngave a little cry of terror. At the same instant the cave man leaped to\r\nhis feet. But the girl's voice had touched something in the breast of\r\nWaldo Emerson which generations of disuse had almost atrophied, and for\r\nthe first time in his life he did a brave and courageous thing.\r\n\r\nHe could easily have escaped the cave man and reached the\r\nvalley--alone; but at the first note of the young girl's cry he wheeled\r\nand scrambled back to the ledge to face the burly, primitive man, who\r\ncould have crushed him with a single blow.\r\n\r\nWaldo Emerson no longer trembled. His nerves and muscles were very\r\nsteady as he swung his cudgel in an arc that brought it crashing down\r\nupon the upraised guarding arm of the cave man.\r\n\r\nThere was a snapping of bone beneath the blow, a scream of pain--the\r\nman staggered back, the girl sprang to Waldo's side from the ledge\r\nabove, and hand in hand they turned and fled down the face of the cliff.\r\n\r\nFrom a dozen cave-mouths above issued a score of cave men, but the\r\nfleeing pair were half-way across the clearing before the slow-witted\r\nbrutes were fully aware of what had happened. By the time they had\r\ntaken up the pursuit Waldo and the girl had entered the forest.\r\n\r\nFor a few yards the latter led Waldo straight into the shadows of the\r\nwood, then she turned abruptly toward the north, at right angles to the\r\ncourse they had been pursuing.\r\n\r\nShe still clung to the young man's hand, nor did she slacken her speed\r\nthe least after they had entered the darkness beneath the trees. She\r\nran as surely and confidently through the impenetrable night of the\r\nforest as though the way had been lighted by flaming arcs; but Waldo\r\nwas continually stumbling and falling.\r\n\r\nThe sound of pursuit presently became fainter; it was apparent that the\r\ncave men had continued on straight into the wood; but the girl raced\r\non with the panting Waldo for what seemed to the winded young man an\r\neternity. Presently, however, they came to the banks of the little\r\nstream that had been visible from the caves. Here the girl fell into\r\na walk, and a moment later dragged the Bostonian down a shelving bank\r\ninto water that came above his knees.\r\n\r\nUp the bed of the stream she led him, sometimes floundering through\r\nholes so deep that they were entirely submerged.\r\n\r\nWaldo had never learned the vulgar art of swimming, so it was that he\r\nwould have drowned but for the strong, brown hand of his companion,\r\nwhich dragged him, spluttering and coughing, through one awful hole\r\nafter another, until, half-strangled and entirely panic-stricken, she\r\nhauled him safely upon a low, grassy bank at the foot of a rocky wall\r\nwhich formed one side of a gorge, through which the river boiled.\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that when Waldo Emerson returned to face the\r\nhairy brute who threatened to separate him from his new-found companion\r\nthat by a miracle he had been transformed from a hare into a lion--far\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nNow that he had a moment in which to lie quite still and speculate upon\r\nthe adventures of the past hour, the reaction came, and Waldo Emerson\r\nthanked the kindly night that obscured from the eyes of the girl the\r\npitiable spectacle of his palsied limbs and trembling lip.\r\n\r\nOnce again he was in a blue funk, with shattered nerves that begged to\r\ncry aloud in the extremity of their terror.\r\n\r\nIt was not warm in the damp cañon, through which the wind swept over\r\nthe cold water, so that to Waldo's mental anguish was added the\r\nphysical discomfort of cold and wet. He was indeed a miserable figure\r\nas he lay huddled upon the sward, praying for the rising of the sun,\r\nyet dreading the daylight that might reveal him to his enemies.\r\n\r\nBut at last dawn came, and after a fitful sleep Waldo awoke to find\r\nhimself in a snug and beautiful little paradise hemmed in by the high\r\ncliffs that flanked the river, upon a sloping grassy shore that was all\r\nbut invisible except from a short stretch of cliff-top upon the farther\r\nside of the stream.\r\n\r\nA few feet from him lay the girl.\r\n\r\nShe was still asleep. Her head was pillowed upon one firm, brown arm.\r\nHer soft black hair fell in disorder across one cheek and over the\r\nother arm, to spread gracefully upon the green grass about her.\r\n\r\nAs Waldo looked he saw that she was very comely. Never before had he\r\nseen a girl just like her. His young women friends had been rather prim\r\nand plain, with long, white faces and thin lips that scarcely ever\r\ndared to smile and scorned to unbend in plebeian laughter.\r\n\r\nThis girl's lips seemed to have been made for laughing--and for\r\nsomething else, though at the time it is only fair to Waldo to say that\r\nhe did not realize the full possibilities that they presented.\r\n\r\nAs his eyes wandered along the lines of her young body his Puritanical\r\ntraining brought a hot flush of embarrassment to his face, and he\r\ndeliberately turned his back upon her.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed awful to Waldo Emerson to contemplate, to say the least,\r\nthe unconventional position into which fate had forced him. The longer\r\nhe pondered it the redder he became. It was frightful--what would his\r\nmother say when she heard of it?\r\n\r\nWhat would this girl's mother say? But, more to the point,\r\nand--horrible thought--what would her father or her brothers do to\r\nWaldo if they found them thus together--and she with only a scanty\r\ngarment of skin about her waist--a garment which reached scarcely below\r\nher knees at any point, and at others terminated far above?\r\n\r\nWaldo was chagrined. He could not understand what the girl could be\r\nthinking of, for in other respects she seemed quite nice, and he was\r\nsure that the great eyes of her reflected only goodness and innocence.\r\n\r\nWhile he sat thus, thinking, the girl awoke and with a merry laugh\r\naddressed him.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning,\" said Waldo quite severely.\r\n\r\nHe wished that he could speak her language, so that he could convey to\r\nher a suggestion of the disapprobation which he felt for her attire.\r\n\r\nHe was on the point of attempting it by signs, when she rose, lithe\r\nand graceful as a tigress, and walked to the river's brim. With a deft\r\nmovement of her fingers she loosed the thong that held her single\r\ngarment, and as it fell to the ground Waldo, with a horrified gasp,\r\nturned upon his face, burying his tightly closed eyes in his hands.\r\n\r\nThen the girl dived into the cool waters for her matutinal bath.\r\n\r\nShe called to him several times to join her, but Waldo could not look\r\nat the spectacle presented; his soul was scandalized.\r\n\r\nIt was some time after she emerged from the river before he dared risk\r\na hesitating glance. With a sigh of relief he saw that she had donned\r\nher single garment, and thereafter he could look at her unashamed when\r\nshe was thus clothed. He felt that by comparison it constituted a most\r\nmodest gown.\r\n\r\nTogether they strolled along the river's edge, gathering such fruits\r\nand roots as the girl knew to be edible. Waldo Emerson gathered those\r\nshe indicated--with all his learning he found it necessary to depend\r\nupon the untutored mind of this little primitive maiden for guidance.\r\n\r\nThen she taught him how to catch fish with a bent twig and a\r\nlightninglike movement of her brown hands--or, rather, tried to teach\r\nhim, for he was far too slow and awkward to succeed.\r\n\r\nAfterward they sat upon the soft grass beneath the shade of a wild\r\nfig-tree to eat the fish she had caught. Waldo wondered how in the\r\nworld the girl could make fire without matches, for he was quite sure\r\nthat she had none; and even should she be able to make fire it would be\r\nquite useless, since she had neither cooking utensils nor stove.\r\n\r\nHe was not left long in wonderment.\r\n\r\nShe arranged the fish in a little pile between them, and with a sweet\r\nsmile motioned to the man to partake; then she selected one for\r\nherself, and while Waldo Emerson looked on in horror, sunk her firm,\r\nwhite teeth into the raw fish.\r\n\r\nWaldo turned away in sickening disgust\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed surprised and worried that he did not eat. Time and\r\nagain she tried to coax him by signs to join her; but he could not even\r\nlook at her. He had tried, after the first wave of revolt had subsided,\r\nbut when he discovered that she ate the entire fish, without bothering\r\nto clean it or remove the scales, he became too ill to think of food.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the following week they ventured from their\r\nhiding-place, and at these times it was evident from the girl's\r\nactions that she was endeavoring to elude their enemies and reach a\r\nplace of safety other than that in which they were concealed. But at\r\neach venture her quick ears or sensitive nostrils warned her of the\r\nproximity of danger, so that they had been compelled to hurry back into\r\ntheir little Eden.\r\n\r\nDuring this period she taught Waldo many words of her native tongue, so\r\nthat by means of signs to bridge the gaps between, they were able to\r\ncommunicate with a fair degree of satisfaction. Waldo's mastery of the\r\nlanguage was rapid.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day the girl was able to make him understand that she\r\nwished to escape with him to her own people; that these men among whom\r\nhe had found her were enemies of her tribe, and that she had been\r\nhiding from them when Waldo stumbled upon her cave.\r\n\r\n\"I fled,\" she said. \"My mother was killed. My father took another mate,\r\nalways cruel to me. But when I had wandered into the land of these\r\nenemies I was afraid, and would have returned to my father's cave. But\r\nI had gone too far.\r\n\r\n\"I would have to run very fast to escape them. Once I ran down a narrow\r\npath to the ocean. It was dark.\r\n\r\n\"As I wandered through the woods I came suddenly out upon a beach, and\r\nthere I saw a strange figure on the sand. It was you. I wanted to learn\r\nwhat manner of man you were. But I was very much afraid, so that I\r\ndared only watch you from a distance.\r\n\r\n\"Five times I came down to look at you. You never saw me until the last\r\ntime, then you set out after me, roaring in a horrible voice.\r\n\r\n\"I was very much afraid, for I knew that you must be very brave to\r\nlive all alone by the edge of the forest without any shelter, or even\r\na stone to hurl at Nagoola, should he come out of the woods to devour\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWaldo Emerson shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Who is Nagoola?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You do not know Nagoola!\" the girl exclaimed in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Not by that name,\" replied Waldo.\r\n\r\n\"He is as large,\" she began in description, \"as two men, and black,\r\nwith glossy coat. He has two yellow eyes, which see as well by night as\r\nby day. His great paws are armed with mighty claws. He----\"\r\n\r\nA rustling from the bushes which fringed the opposite cliff-top caused\r\nher to turn, instantly alert.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" she whispered, \"there is Nagoola now.\"\r\n\r\nWaldo looked in the direction of her gaze.\r\n\r\nIt was well that the girl did not see his pallid face and popping\r\neyes as he looked into the evil mask of the great black panther that\r\ncrouched watching them from the river's further bank.\r\n\r\nInto Waldo's breast came great panic. It was only because his\r\nfear-prostrated muscles refused to respond to his will that he did not\r\nscurry, screaming, from the sight of that ferocious countenance.\r\n\r\nThen, through the fog of his cowardly terror, he heard again the girl's\r\nsweet voice: \"I knew that you must be very brave to live all alone by\r\nthe edge of that wicked forest.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life a wave of shame swept over Waldo Emerson.\r\n\r\nThe girl called in a taunting voice to the panther, and then turned,\r\nsmiling, toward Waldo.\r\n\r\n\"How brave I am now,\" she laughed. \"I am no longer afraid of Nagoola.\r\nYou are with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Waldo Emerson, in a very weak voice, \"you need not fear\r\nwhile I am with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she cried. \"Slay him. How proud I should be to return to my\r\npeople with one who vanquished Nagoola, and wore his hide about his\r\nloins as proof of his prowess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Y-yes,\" acquiesced Waldo faintly.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued the girl, \"you have slain many of Nagoola's brothers\r\nand sisters. It is no longer sport to kill one of his kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes,\" cried Waldo. \"Yes, that is it--panthers bore me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" The girl clasped her hands in ecstasy. \"How many have you slain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--why, let me see,\" the young man blundered. \"As a matter of fact, I\r\nnever kept any record of the panthers I killed.\"\r\n\r\nWaldo was becoming frantic. He had never lied before in all his life.\r\nHe hated a lie and loathed a liar. He wondered why he had lied now.\r\n\r\nSurely it were nothing to boast of to have butchered one of God's\r\ncreatures--and as for claiming to have killed so many that he could\r\nnot recall the number, it was little short of horrible. Yet he became\r\nconscious of a poignant regret that he had not killed a thousand\r\npanthers, and preserved all the pelts as evidence of his valor.\r\n\r\nThe panther still regarded them from the safety of the farther shore.\r\nThe girl drew quite close to Waldo in the instinctive plea for\r\nprotection that belongs to her sex. She laid a timid hand upon his\r\nskinny arm and raised her great, trusting eyes to his face in reverent\r\nadoration.\r\n\r\n\"How do you kill them?\" she whispered. \"Tell me.\"\r\n\r\nThen it was that Waldo determined to make a clean breast of it, and\r\nadmit that he never before had seen a live panther. But as he opened\r\nhis mouth to make the humiliating confession he realized, quite\r\nsuddenly, why it was that he had lied--he wished to appear well in the\r\neyes of this savage, half-clothed girl.\r\n\r\nHe, Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, craved the applause of a barbarian, and\r\nto win it had simulated that physical prowess which generations of\r\nSmith-Joneses had viewed from afar--disgusted, disapproving.\r\n\r\nThe girl repeated her question.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Waldo, \"it is really quite simple. After I catch them I beat\r\nthem severely with a stick.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl sighed.\r\n\r\n\"How wonderful!\" she said.\r\n\r\nWaldo became the victim of a number of unpleasant\r\nemotions--mortification for this suddenly developed moral turpitude;\r\napprehension for the future, when the girl might discover him in his\r\ntrue colors; fear, consuming, terrible fear, that she might insist upon\r\nhis going forth at once to slay Nagoola.\r\n\r\nBut she did nothing of the kind, and presently the panther tired of\r\nwatching them and turned back into the tangle of bushes behind him.\r\n\r\nIt was with a sigh of relief that Waldo saw him depart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDEATH'S DOORWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the girl suggested that they start that night\r\nupon the journey toward her village.\r\n\r\n\"The bad men will not be abroad after dark,\" she said. \"With you at my\r\nside, I shall not fear Nagoola.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is it to your village?\" asked Waldo.\r\n\r\n\"It will take us three nights,\" she replied. \"By day we must hide,\r\nfor even you could not vanquish a great number of bad men should they\r\nattack you at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Waldo; \"I presume not.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was very wonderful to watch you, though,\" she went on, \"when you\r\nbattled upon the cliff-side, beating them down as they came upon you.\r\nHow brave you were! How terrible! You trembled from rage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" admitted Waldo, \"I was quite angry. I always tremble like that\r\nwhen my ire is excited. Sometimes I get so bad that my knees knock\r\ntogether. If you ever see them do that you will realize how exceedingly\r\nangry I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" murmured the girl.\r\n\r\nPresently Waldo saw that she was laughing quietly to herself.\r\n\r\nA great fear rose in his breast. Could it be that she was less gullible\r\nthan she had appeared? Did she, after all, penetrate the bombast with\r\nwhich he had sought to cloak his cowardice?\r\n\r\nHe finally mustered sufficient courage to ask: \"Why do you laugh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think of the surprise that awaits old Flatfoot and Korth and the\r\nothers when I lead you to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why will they be surprised?\" asked Waldo.\r\n\r\n\"At the way you will crack their heads.\"\r\n\r\nWaldo shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I crack their heads?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why should you crack their heads!\" It was apparently incredible to the\r\ngirl that he should not understand.\r\n\r\n\"How little you know,\" she said. \"You cannot swim, you do not know the\r\nlanguage which men may understand, you would be lost in the woods were\r\nI to leave you, and now you say that you do not know that when you come\r\nto a strange tribe they will try to kill you, and only take you as one\r\nof them when you have proven your worth by killing at least one of\r\ntheir strongest men.\"\r\n\r\n\"At least one!\" said Waldo, half to himself.\r\n\r\nHe was dazed by this information. He had expected to be welcomed with\r\nopen arms into the best society that the girl's community afforded.\r\nHe had thought of it in just this way, for he had not even yet learned\r\nthat there might be a whole people living under entirely different\r\nconditions than those which existed in Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nHer reference to his ignorance also came as a distinct shock to him. He\r\nhad always considered himself a man of considerable learning. It had\r\nbeen his secret boast and his mother's open pride.\r\n\r\nAnd now to be pitied for his ignorance by one who probably thought the\r\nearth flat, if she ever thought about such matters at all--by one who\r\ncould neither read nor write. And the worst of it all was that her\r\nindictment was correct--only she had not gone far enough.\r\n\r\nThere was little of practical value that he did know. With the\r\nrealization of his limitations Waldo Emerson took, unknown to himself,\r\na great stride toward a broader wisdom than his narrow soul had ever\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\nThat night, after the sun had set and the stars and moon come out, the\r\ntwo set forth from their retreat toward the northwest, where the girl\r\nsaid that the village of her people lay.\r\n\r\nThey walked hand in hand through the dark wood, the girl directing\r\ntheir steps, the young man grasping his long cudgel in his right hand\r\nand searching into the shadows for the terrible creatures conjured by\r\nhis cowardly brain, but mostly for the two awesome spots of fire which\r\nhe had gathered from the girl's talk would mark the presence of Nagoola.\r\n\r\nStrange noises assailed his ears, and once the girl crouched close to\r\nhim as her quick ears caught the sound of the movement of a great body\r\nthrough the underbrush at their left.\r\n\r\nWaldo Emerson was almost paralyzed by terror; but at length the\r\ncreature, whatever it may have been, turned off into the forest\r\nwithout molesting them. For several hours thereafter they suffered no\r\nalarm, but the constant tension of apprehension on the man's already\r\nover-wrought nerves had reduced him to a state of such abject nervous\r\nterror that he was no longer master of himself.\r\n\r\nSo it was that when the girl suddenly halted him with an affrighted\r\nlittle gasp and, pointing straight ahead, whispered, \"Nagoola,\" he went\r\nmomentarily mad with fear.\r\n\r\nFor a bare instant he paused in his tracks, and then breaking away\r\nfrom her, he raised his club above his head, and with an awful shriek\r\ndashed--straight toward the panther.\r\n\r\nIn the minds of some there may be a doubt as to which of the two--the\r\nsleek, silent, black cat or the grinning, screaming Waldo--was the most\r\nawe-inspiring.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, it was quite evident that no doubt assailed the mind\r\nof the cat, for with a single answering scream, he turned and faded\r\ninto the blackness of the black night.\r\n\r\nBut Waldo did not see him go. Still shrieking, he raced on through the\r\nforest until he tripped over a creeper and fell exhausted to the earth.\r\nThere he lay panting, twitching, and trembling until the girl found\r\nhim, an hour after sunrise.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of her voice he would have struggled to his feet and\r\ndashed on into the woods, for he felt that he could never face her\r\nagain after the spectacle of cowardice with which he had treated her a\r\nfew hours before.\r\n\r\nBut even as he gained his feet her first words reassured him, and\r\ndissipated every vestige of his intention to elude her.\r\n\r\n\"Did you catch him?\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" panted Waldo Emerson quite truthfully. \"He got away.\"\r\n\r\nThey rested a little while, and then Waldo insisted that they resume\r\ntheir journey by day instead of by night. He had positively determined\r\nthat he never should or could endure another such a night of mental\r\ntorture. He would much rather take the chance of meeting with the bad\r\nmen than suffer the constant feeling that unseen enemies were peering\r\nout of the darkness at him every moment.\r\n\r\nIn the day they would at least have the advantage of seeing their foes\r\nbefore they were struck. He did not give these reasons to the girl,\r\nhowever. Under the circumstances he felt that another explanation would\r\nbe better adapted to her ears.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said, \"if it hadn't been so dark Nagoola might not have\r\nescaped me. It is too bad--too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed the girl, \"it is too bad. We shall travel by day. It will\r\nbe safe now. We have left the country of the bad men, and there are few\r\nmen living between us and my people.\"\r\n\r\nThat night they spent in a cave they found in the steep bank of a small\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nIt was damp and muddy and cold, but they were both very tired, and so\r\nthey fell asleep and slept as soundly as though the best of mattresses\r\nlay beneath them. The girl probably slept better, since she had never\r\nbeen accustomed to anything much superior to this in all her life.\r\n\r\nThe journey required five days, instead of three, and during all the\r\ntime Waldo was learning more and more woodcraft from the girl. At first\r\nhis attitude had been such that he could profit but little from her\r\ngreater practical knowledge, for he had been inclined to look down upon\r\nher as an untutored savage.\r\n\r\nNow, however, he was a willing student, and when Waldo Emerson elected\r\nto study there was nothing that he could not master and retain in a\r\nremarkable manner. He had a well-trained mind--the principal trouble\r\nwith it being that it had been crammed full of useless knowledge. His\r\nmother had always made the error of confusing knowledge with wisdom.\r\n\r\nWaldo was not the only one to learn new things upon this journey. The\r\ngirl learned something, too--something which had been threatening for\r\ndays to rise above the threshold of her conscious mind, and now she\r\nrealized that it had lain in her heart almost ever since the first\r\nmoment that she had been with this strange young man.\r\n\r\nWaldo Emerson had been endowed by nature with a chivalrous heart, and\r\nhis training had been such that he mechanically accorded to all women\r\nthe gallant little courtesies and consideration which are of the fine\r\nthings that go with breeding. Nor was he one whit less punctilious in\r\nhis relations with this wild cave girl than he would have been with the\r\ndaughter of the finest family of his own aristocracy.\r\n\r\nHe had been kind and thoughtful and sympathetic always, and to the\r\ngirl, who had never been accustomed to such treatment from men, nor\r\nhad ever seen a man accord it to any woman, it seemed little short of\r\nmiraculous that such gentle tenderness could belong to a nature so\r\nwarlike and ferocious as that with which she had endowed Waldo Emerson.\r\nBut she was quite satisfied that it should be so.\r\n\r\nShe would not have cared for him had he been gentle with her, yet\r\ncowardly. Had she dreamed of the real truth--had she had the slightest\r\nsuspicion that Waldo Emerson was at heart the most arrant poltroon\r\nupon whom the sun had ever shone, she would have loathed and hated\r\nhim, for in the primitive code of ethics which governed the savage\r\ncommunity which was her world there was no place for the craven or the\r\nweakling--and Waldo Emerson was both.\r\n\r\nAs the realization of her growing sentiment toward the man awakened, it\r\nimparted to her ways with him a sudden coyness and maidenly aloofness\r\nwhich had been entirely wanting before. Until then their companionship,\r\nin so far as the girl was concerned, had been rather that of one\r\nyouth toward another; but now that she found herself thrilling at his\r\nslightest careless touch, she became aware of a paradoxical impulse to\r\navoid him.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in her life, too, she realized her nakedness, and\r\nwas ashamed. Possibly this was due to the fact that Waldo appeared so\r\nsolicitous in endeavoring to coerce his rags into the impossible feat\r\nof entirely covering his body.\r\n\r\nAs they neared their journey's end Waldo became more and more perturbed.\r\n\r\nDuring the last night horrible visions of Flatfoot and Korth haunted\r\nhis dreams. He saw the great, hairy beasts rushing upon him in all the\r\nferocity of their primeval savagery--tearing him limb from limb in\r\ntheir bestial rage.\r\n\r\nWith a shriek he awoke.\r\n\r\nTo the girl's startled inquiry he replied that he had been but dreaming.\r\n\r\n\"Did you dream of Flatfoot and Korth?\" she laughed. \"Of the things that\r\nyou will do to them tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Waldo; \"I dreamed of Flatfoot and Korth.\" But the girl\r\ndid not see how he trembled and hid his head in the hollow of his arm.\r\n\r\nThe last day's march was the most agonizing experience of Waldo\r\nEmerson's life. He was positive that he was going to his death, but to\r\nhim the horror of the thing lay more in the manner of his coming death\r\nthan in the thought of death itself. As a matter of fact, he had again\r\nreached a point when he would have welcomed death.\r\n\r\nThe future held for him nothing but a life of discomfort and misery and\r\nconstant mental anguish, superinduced by the condition of awful fear\r\nunder which he must drag out his existence in this strange and terrible\r\nland.\r\n\r\nWaldo had not the slightest conception as to whether he was upon some\r\nmainland or an unknown island. That the tidal wave had come upon them\r\nsomewhere in the South Pacific was all that he knew; but long since he\r\nhad given up hope that succor would reach him in time to prevent him\r\nperishing miserably far from his home and his poor mother.\r\n\r\nHe could not dwell long upon this dismal theme, because it always\r\nbrought tears of self-pity to his eyes, and for some unaccountable\r\nreason Waldo shrunk from the thought of exhibiting this unmanly\r\nweakness before the girl.\r\n\r\nAll day long he racked his brain for some valid excuse whereby he might\r\npersuade his companion to lead him elsewhere than to her village. A\r\nthousand times better would be some secluded little garden such as that\r\nwhich had harbored them for the ten days following their escape from\r\nthe cave men.\r\n\r\nIf they could but come upon such a place near the coast, where Waldo\r\ncould keep a constant watch for passing vessels, he would have been as\r\nhappy as he ever expected it would be possible for him in such a savage\r\nland.\r\n\r\nHe wanted the girl with him for companionship; he was more afraid when\r\nhe was alone. Of course, he realized that she was no fit companion\r\nfor a man of his mental attainments; but then she was a human being,\r\nand her society much better than none at all. While hope had still\r\nlingered that he might live to escape and return to his beloved Boston,\r\nhe had often wondered whether he would dare tell his mother of his\r\nunconventional acquaintance with this young woman.\r\n\r\nOf course, it would be out of the question for him to go at all into\r\ndetails. He would not, for example, dare to attempt a description of\r\nher toilet to his prim parent.\r\n\r\nThe fact that they had been alone together, day and night for weeks was\r\nanother item which troubled Waldo considerably. He knew that the shock\r\nof such information might prostrate his mother, and for a long time he\r\ndebated the wisdom of omitting any mention of the girl whatever.\r\n\r\nAt length he decided that a little, white lie would be permissible,\r\ninasmuch as his mother's health and the girl's reputation were both at\r\nstake. So he had decided to mention that the girl's aunt had been with\r\nthem in the capacity of chaperon; that fixed it nicely, and on this\r\npoint Waldo's mind was more at ease.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon they wound down a narrow trail that led from\r\nthe plateau into a narrow, beautiful valley. A tree-bordered river\r\nmeandered through the center of the level plain that formed the\r\nvalley's floor, while beyond rose precipitous cliffs, which trailed\r\noff in either direction as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\n\"There live my people,\" said the girl, pointing toward the distant\r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\nWaldo groaned inwardly.\r\n\r\n\"Let us rest here,\" he said, \"until tomorrow, that we may come to your\r\nhome rested and refreshed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" cried the girl; \"we can reach the caves before dark. I can\r\nscarcely wait until I shall have seen how you shall slay Flatfoot, and\r\nmaybe Korth also. Though I think that after one of them has felt your\r\nmight the others will be glad to take you into the tribe at the price\r\nof your friendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there not some way,\" ventured the distracted Waldo, \"that I may\r\ncome into your village without fighting? I should dislike to kill one\r\nof your friends,\" said Waldo solemnly.\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Neither Flatfoot nor Korth are friends of mine,\" she replied; \"I hate\r\nthem both. They are terrible men. It would be better for all the tribe\r\nwere they killed. They are so strong and cruel that we all hate them,\r\nsince they use their strength to abuse those who are weaker.\r\n\r\n\"They make us all work very hard for them. They take other men's mates,\r\nand if the other men object they kill them. There is scarcely a moon\r\npasses that does not see either Korth or Flatfoot kill some one.\r\n\r\n\"Nor is it always men they kill. Often when they are angry they kill\r\nwomen and little children just for the pleasure of killing; but when\r\nyou come among us there will be no more of that, for you will kill them\r\nboth if they be not good.\"\r\n\r\nWaldo was too horrified by this description of his soon-to-be\r\nantagonists to make any reply--his tongue clave to the roof of his\r\nmouth--all his vocal organs seemed paralyzed.\r\n\r\nBut the girl did not notice. She went on joyously, ripping Waldo's\r\nnervous system out of him and tearing it into shreds.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"Flatfoot and Korth are greater than the\r\nother men of my tribe. They can do as they will. They are frightful to\r\nlook upon, and I have often thought that the hearts of others dried up\r\nwhen they saw either of them coming for them.\r\n\r\n\"And they are so strong! I have seen Korth crush the skull of a\r\nfull-grown man with a single blow from his open palm; while one of\r\nFlatfoot's amusements is the breaking of men's arms and legs with his\r\nbare hands.\"\r\n\r\nThey had entered the valley now, and in silence they continued on\r\ntoward the fringe of trees which grew beside the little river.\r\n\r\nNadara led the way toward a ford, which they quickly crossed. All the\r\nway across the valley Waldo had been searching for some avenue of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nHe dared not enter that awful village and face those terrible men,\r\nand he was almost equally averse to admitting to the girl that he was\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\nHe would gladly have died to have escaped either alternative, but he\r\npreferred to choose the manner of his death.\r\n\r\nThe thought of entering the village and meeting a horrible end at the\r\nhands of the brutes who awaited him there and of being compelled to\r\ndemonstrate before the girl's eyes that he was neither a mighty fighter\r\nnor a hero was more than he could endure.\r\n\r\nOccupied with these harrowing speculations, Waldo and Nadara came to\r\nthe farther side of the forest, whence they could see the towering\r\ncliffs rising steeply from the valley's bed, three hundred yards away.\r\n\r\nAlong their face and at their feet Waldo descried a host of half-naked\r\nmen, women, and children moving about in the consummation of their\r\nvarious duties. Involuntarily he halted.\r\n\r\nThe girl came to his side. Together they looked out upon the scene, the\r\nlike of which Waldo Emerson never before had seen.\r\n\r\nIt was as though he had been suddenly snatched back through countless\r\nages to a long-dead past and dropped into the midst of the prehistoric\r\nlife of his paleolithic progenitors.\r\n\r\nUpon the narrow ledges before their caves, women, with long, flowing\r\nhair, ground food in rude stone mortars.\r\n\r\nNaked children played about them, perilously close to the precipitous\r\ncliff edge.\r\n\r\nHairy men squatted, gorillalike, before pieces of flat stone, upon\r\nwhich green hides were stretched, while they scraped, scraped, scraped\r\nwith the sharp edge of smaller bits of stone.\r\n\r\nThere was no laughter and no song.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Waldo saw one of the fierce creatures address another, and\r\nsometimes one would raise his thick lips in a nasty snarl that exposed\r\nhis fighting fangs; but they were too far away for their words to reach\r\nthe young man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAWAKENING\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said the girl, \"let us make haste. I cannot wait to be home\r\nagain! How good it looks!\"\r\n\r\nWaldo gazed at her in horror. It did not seem credible that this\r\nbeautiful young creature could be of such clay as that he looked upon.\r\nIt was revolting to believe that she had sprung from the loins of one\r\nof those half-brutes, or that a woman as fierce, repulsive, such as\r\nthose he saw before him, could have borne her. It made him sick with\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\nHe turned from her.\r\n\r\n\"Go to your people, Nadara,\" he said, for an idea had come to him.\r\n\r\nHe had evolved a scheme for escaping a meeting with Flatfoot and Korth,\r\nand the sudden disgust which he felt for the girl made it easier for\r\nhim to carry out his design.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not coming with me?\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"Not at once,\" replied Waldo, quite truthfully. \"I wish you to go\r\nfirst. Were we to go together they might harm you when they rushed out\r\nto attack me.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl had no fear of this, but she felt that it was very thoughtful\r\nof the man to consider her welfare so tenderly. To humor him, she\r\nacceded to his request.\r\n\r\n\"As you wish, Thandar,\" she answered, smiling.\r\n\r\nThandar was a name of her own choosing, after, Waldo had informed her\r\nin answer to a request for his name, that she might call him Mr. Waldo\r\nEmerson Smith-Jones. \"I shall call you Thandar,\" she had replied; \"it\r\nis shorter, more easily remembered, and describes you. It means the\r\nBrave One.\" And so Thandar he had become.\r\n\r\nThe girl had scarcely emerged from the forest on her way toward the\r\ncliffs when Thandar the Brave One, turned and ran at top speed in\r\nthe opposite direction. When he came to the river he gave immediate\r\nevidence of the strides he had taken in woodcraft during the brief\r\nweeks that he had been under the girl's tutorage, for he plunged\r\nimmediately into the water, setting out up-stream upon the gravelly\r\nbottom where he would leave no spoor to be tracked down by the eagle\r\neyes of these primitive men.\r\n\r\nHe supposed that the girl would search for him; but he felt no\r\ncompunction at having deserted her so scurvily. Of course, he had no\r\nsuspicion of her real sentiments toward him--it would have shocked\r\nhim to have imagined that a low-born person, such as she, had become\r\ninfatuated with him.\r\n\r\nIt would have been embarrassing and unfortunate, but, of course,\r\nquite impossible--since Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones could never form an\r\nalliance beneath him. As for the girl herself, he might as readily have\r\nconsidered the possibility of marrying a cow, so far from any such\r\nthoughts of her had he been.\r\n\r\nOn and on he stumbled through the cold water. Sometimes it was above\r\nhis head, but Waldo had learned to swim--the girl had made him, partly\r\nby pleas, but largely by the fear that she would ridicule him.\r\n\r\nAs night came on he commenced to become afraid, but his fear now was\r\nnot such a horribly prostrating thing as it had been a few weeks\r\nbefore. Without being aware of the fact, Waldo had grown a trifle less\r\ntimid, though he was still far from lion-like.\r\n\r\nThat night he slept in the crotch of a tree. He selected a small one,\r\nwhich, though less comfortable, was safer from the approach of Nagoola\r\nthan a larger tree would have been. This also had he learned from\r\nNadara.\r\n\r\nHad he paused to consider, he would have discovered that all he knew\r\nthat was worth while he had had from the savage little girl whom he,\r\nfrom the high pinnacle of his erudition, regarded with such pity. But\r\nWaldo had not as yet learned enough to realize how very little he knew.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he continued his flight, gathering his breakfast from\r\ntree and shrub as he fled. Here again was he wholly indebted to Nadara,\r\nfor without her training he would have been restricted to a couple of\r\nfruits, whereas now he had a great variety of fruits, roots, berries,\r\nand nuts to choose from in safety.\r\n\r\nThe stream that he had been following had now become a narrow, rushing,\r\nmountain torrent. It leaped suddenly over little precipices in wild and\r\npicturesque waterfalls; it rioted in foaming cascades; and ever it led\r\nWaldo farther into high and rugged country.\r\n\r\nThe climbing was difficult and oftentimes dangerous. Waldo was\r\nsurprised at the steeps he negotiated--perilous ascents from which he\r\nwould have shrunk in palsied fear a few weeks earlier. Waldo was coming\r\non.\r\n\r\nAnother fact which struck him with amazement at the same time that it\r\nfilled him with rejoicing, was that he no longer coughed. It was quite\r\nbeyond belief, too, since never in his life had he been so exposed to\r\ncold and wet and discomfort.\r\n\r\nAt home, he realized, he would long since have curled up and died had\r\nhe been subjected to one-tenth the exposure that he had undergone since\r\nthe great wave had lifted him bodily from the deck of the steamer to\r\nland him unceremoniously in the midst of this new life of hardships and\r\nterrors.\r\n\r\nToward noon Waldo began to travel with less haste. He had seen or heard\r\nno evidence of pursuit. At times he stopped to look back along the\r\ntrail he had passed, but though he could see the little valley below\r\nhim for a considerable distance he discovered nothing to arouse alarm.\r\n\r\nPresently he realized that he was very lonely. A dozen times in as many\r\nminutes he thought of observations he would have been glad to make had\r\nthere been some one with him to hear. There were queries, too, relative\r\nto this new country that he should have liked very much to propound,\r\nand it flashed upon him that in all the world there was only one whom\r\nhe knew who could give him correct answers to these queries.\r\n\r\nHe wondered what the girl had thought when he did not follow her into\r\nthe village, and set upon Flatfoot and Korth. At the thought he found\r\nhimself flushing in a most unaccountable manner.\r\n\r\nWhat would the girl think! Would she guess the truth? Well, what\r\ndifference if she did? What was her opinion to a cultured gentleman\r\nsuch as Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones? But yet he found his mind constantly\r\nreverting to this unhappy speculation; it was most annoying.\r\n\r\nAs he thought of her he discovered with what distinctness he recalled\r\nevery feature of her piquant little face, her olive skin tinged\r\nbeautifully by the ruddy glow of health; her fine, straight nose and\r\ndelicate nostrils, her perfect eyes, soft, yet filled with the fire of\r\ncourage and intelligence. Waldo wondered why it was that he recalled\r\nthese things now, and dwelt upon them; he had been with her for weeks\r\nwithout realizing that he had particularly noticed them.\r\n\r\nBut most vividly he conjured again the memory of her soft, liquid\r\nspeech, her ready retorts, her bright, interesting observations on\r\nthe little happenings of their daily life; her thoughtful kindliness\r\nto him, a stranger within her gates, and--again he flushed hotly--her\r\nsincere, though remarkable, belief in his prowess.\r\n\r\nIt took Waldo a long time to admit to himself that he missed the\r\ngirl; it must have been weeks before he finally did so unreservedly.\r\nSimultaneously he determined to return to her village and find her. He\r\nhad even gone so far as to start the return journey when the memory of\r\nher description of Flatfoot and Korth brought him to a sudden halt--a\r\nmost humiliating halt.\r\n\r\nThe blood surged to his face--he could feel it burning there. And then\r\nWaldo did two things which he had never done before: he looked at his\r\nsoul and saw himself as he was, and--he swore.\r\n\r\n\"Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones,\" he said aloud, \"you're a darned coward!\r\nWorse than that, you're an unthinkable cad. That girl was kind to you.\r\nShe treated you with the tender solicitude of a mother. And how have\r\nyou returned her kindness? By looking down upon her with arrogant\r\ncondescension. By pitying her.\r\n\r\n\"Pitying her! You--you miserable weakling--ingrate, pitying that\r\nfine, intelligent, generous girl. You, with your pitiful little store\r\nof second-hand knowledge, pitying that girl's ignorance. Why, she's\r\nforgotten more real things than you ever heard of, you--you--\" Words\r\nutterly failed him.\r\n\r\nWaldo's awakening was thorough--painfully thorough. It left no tiny\r\nhidden recess of his contemptible little soul unrevealed from his\r\nsearching self-analysis. Looking back over the twenty-one years of his\r\nuneventful life, he failed to resurrect but a single act of which he\r\nmight now be proud, and that, strange to say, in the light of his past\r\ntraining, had to do neither with culture, intellect, birth, breeding,\r\nnor knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt was a purely gross, physical act. It was hideously, violently,\r\nrepulsively animal--it was no other than the instant of heroism in\r\nwhich he had turned back upon the cliff's face to battle with the\r\nhorrible, hairy man who had threatened to prevent Nadara's escape.\r\n\r\nEven now Waldo could not realize that it had been he who ventured so\r\nfoolhardy an act; but none the less his breast swelled with pride as\r\nhe recalled it. It put into the heart of the man a new hope and into\r\nhis head a new purpose--a purpose that would have caused his Back Bay\r\nmother to seek an early grave could she have known of it.\r\n\r\nNor did Waldo Emerson lose any time in initiating the new regime which\r\nwas eventually to fit him for the consummation of his splendid purpose.\r\nHe thought of it as splendid now, though a few weeks before the vulgar\r\natrocity of it would have nauseated him.\r\n\r\nFar up in the hills, near the source of the little river, Waldo had\r\nfound a rocky cave. This he had chosen as his new home. He cleaned it\r\nout with scrupulous care, littering the floor with leaves and grasses.\r\n\r\nBefore the entrance he piled a dozen large boulders, so arranged that\r\nthree of them could be removed or replaced either from within or\r\nwithout, thus forming a means of egress and ingress which could be\r\neffectually closed against intruders.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of a high promontory, a half mile beyond his cave, Waldo\r\ncould obtain a view of the ocean, some eight or ten miles distant.\r\nIt was always in his mind that some day a ship would come, and\r\nWaldo longed to return to the haunts of civilization, but he did not\r\nexpect the ship before his plans had properly matured and been put\r\ninto execution. He argued that he could not sail away from this shore\r\nforever without first seeing Nadara, and restoring the confidence in\r\nhim which he felt his recent desertion had unquestionably shaken to its\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nAs a part of his new regime, Waldo required exercise, and to this end\r\nhe set about making a trip to the ocean at least once each week. The\r\nway was rough and hazardous, and the first few times Waldo found it\r\nalmost beyond his strength to make even one leg of the journey between\r\nsunrise and dark.\r\n\r\nThis necessitated sleeping out over night; but this, too, accorded with\r\nthe details of the task he had set himself, and so he did it quite\r\ncheerfully and with a sense of martyrdom that he found effectually\r\nstilled his most poignant fits of cowardice.\r\n\r\nAs time went on he was able to cover the whole distance to the ocean\r\nand return in a single day. He never coughed now, nor did he glance\r\nfearfully from side to side as he strode through the woods and open\r\nplaces of his wild domain.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were bright and clear, his head and shoulders were thrown well\r\nback, and the mountain climbing had expanded his chest to a degree\r\nthat appalled him--the while it gave him much secret satisfaction. It\r\nwas a very different Waldo from the miserable creature which had been\r\nvomited up by the ocean upon the sand of that distant beach.\r\n\r\nThe days that Waldo did not make a trip to the ocean he spent in\r\nrambling about the hills in the vicinity of his cave. He knew every\r\nrock and tree within five miles of his lair.\r\n\r\nHe knew where Nagoola hid by day, and the path that he took down to the\r\nvalley by night. Nor did he longer tremble at sight of the great, black\r\ncat.\r\n\r\nTrue, Waldo avoided him, but it was through cool and deliberate\r\ncaution, which is quite another thing from the senseless panic of fear.\r\nWaldo was biding his time.\r\n\r\nHe would not always avoid Nagoola. Nagoola was a part of Waldo's great\r\nplan, but Waldo was not ready for him yet.\r\n\r\nThe young man still bore his cudgel, and in addition he had practised\r\nthrowing rocks until he could almost have hit a nearby bird upon the\r\nwing. Besides these weapons Waldo was working upon a spear. It had\r\noccurred to him that a spear would be a mighty handy weapon against\r\neither man or beast, and so he had set to work to fashion one.\r\n\r\nHe found a very straight young sapling, a little over an inch in\r\ndiameter and ten feet long. By means of a piece of edged flint he\r\nsucceeded in tapering it to a sharp point. A rawhide thong, plaited\r\nfrom many pieces of small bits of hide taken from the little animals\r\nthat had fallen before his missiles, served to sling the crude weapon\r\nacross his shoulders when he walked.\r\n\r\nWith his spear he practised hour upon hour each day, until he could\r\ntransfix a fruit the size of an apple three times out of five, at a\r\ndistance of fifty feet, and at a hundred hit a target the size of a man\r\nalmost without a miss.\r\n\r\nSix months had passed since he had fled from an encounter with Flatfoot\r\nand Korth.\r\n\r\nThen Waldo had been a skinny, cowardly weakling; now his great frame\r\nhad filled out with healthy flesh, while beneath his skin hard muscles\r\nrolled as he bent to one of the many Herculean tasks he had set for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nFor six months he had worked with a single purpose in view, but still\r\nhe felt that the day was not yet come when he might safely venture to\r\nput his new-found manhood to the test.\r\n\r\nDown, far down, in the depth of his soul he feared that he was yet a\r\ncoward at heart--and he dared not take the risk. It was too much to\r\nexpect, he told himself, that a man should be entirely metamorphosed in\r\na brief half year. He would wait a little longer.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Waldo first saw a human being after his\r\nlast sight of Nadara.\r\n\r\nIt was while he was on his way to the ocean, on one of the trips that\r\nhad by this time become thrice weekly affairs, that he suddenly came\r\nface to face with a skulking, hairy brute.\r\n\r\nWaldo halted to see what would happen.\r\n\r\nThe man eyed him with those small, cunning, red-rimmed eyes that\r\nreminded Waldo of the eyes of a pig.\r\n\r\nFinally Waldo spoke in the language of Nadara.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sag the Killer,\" replied the man. \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thandar,\" answered Waldo.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know you,\" said Sag; \"but I can kill you.\"\r\n\r\nHe lowered his bull head and came for Waldo like a battering ram.\r\n\r\nThe young man dropped the point of his ready spear, bracing his feet.\r\nThe point entered Sag's breast below the collar-bone, stopping only\r\nafter it had passed entirely through the savage heart. Waldo had not\r\nmoved; the momentum of the man's body had been sufficient to impale him.\r\n\r\nAs the body rolled over, stiffening after a few convulsive kicks, Waldo\r\nwithdrew his spear from it. Blood smeared its point for a distance of a\r\nfoot, but Waldo showed no sign of loathing or disgust.\r\n\r\nInstead he smiled. It had been so much easier than he had anticipated.\r\n\r\nLeaving Sag where he had fallen he continued toward the ocean. An hour\r\nlater he heard unusual noises behind him.\r\n\r\nHe stopped to listen. He was being pursued. From the sounds he\r\nestimated that there must be several in the party, and a moment later,\r\nas he was crossing a clearing, he got his first view of them as they\r\nemerged from the forest he had just quitted.\r\n\r\nThere were at least twenty powerfully muscled brutes. In skin bags\r\nthrown across their shoulders each carried a supply of stones, and\r\nthese they began to hurl at Waldo as they raced toward him. For a\r\nmoment the man held his ground, but he quickly realized the futility of\r\npitting himself against such odds.\r\n\r\nTurning, he ran toward the forest upon the other side of the clearing\r\nwhile a shower of rocks whizzed about him.\r\n\r\nOnce within the shelter of the trees there was less likelihood of his\r\nbeing hit by one of the missiles, but occasionally a well-aimed rock\r\nwould strike him a glancing blow. Waldo hoped that they would tire of\r\nthe chase before the beach was reached, for he knew that there could be\r\nbut one outcome of a battle in which one man faced twenty.\r\n\r\nAs the pursued and the pursuers raced on through the forest one of the\r\nlatter, fleeter than his companions, commenced to close up the gap\r\nwhich had existed between Waldo and the twenty. On and on he came,\r\nuntil a backward glance showed Waldo that in another moment this swift\r\nfoeman would be upon him. He was younger than his fellows and more\r\nactive, and, having thrown all his stones, was free from any burden of\r\nweight other than the single garment about his hips.\r\n\r\nWaldo still clung to his tattered ducks, which from lack of support and\r\nmore or less rapid disintegration were continually slipping down from\r\nhis hips, so that they tended to hinder his movements and reduce his\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nHad he been as naked as his pursuer he would doubtless have distanced\r\nhim; but he was not, and it was evident that because of this fact he\r\nmust take a chance in a hand-to-hand encounter that might delay him\r\nsufficiently to permit the balance of the horde to reach him--that\r\nwould be the end of everything.\r\n\r\nBut Waldo Emerson neither screamed in terror nor trembled. When he\r\nwheeled to meet the now close savage there was a smile upon his lips,\r\nfor Waldo Emerson had \"killed his man,\" and there was no longer the\r\nhaunting fear within his soul that at heart he was a coward.\r\n\r\nAs he turned with couched spear the cave man came to a sudden stop.\r\n\r\nThis was not what Waldo had anticipated. The other savages were running\r\nrapidly toward him, but the fellow who had first overhauled him\r\nremained at a safe twenty feet from the point of his weapon.\r\n\r\nWaldo was being cleverly held until the remainder of the enemy could\r\narrive and overwhelm him. He knew that if he turned to run the fellow\r\nwho danced and yelled just beyond his reach would plunge forward and be\r\nupon his back in an instant.\r\n\r\nHe tried rushing the man, but the other retreated nimbly, drawing Waldo\r\nstill closer to those who were coming on.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to be lost. A moment more and the entire twenty would\r\nbe upon him; but there were possibilities in a spear that the cave man\r\nin his ignorance dreamed not of. There was a lightninglike movement of\r\nWaldo's arm, and the aborigine saw the spear darting swiftly through\r\nspace toward his breast. He tried to dodge, but was too late. Down he\r\nwent, clutching madly at the slender thing which protruded from his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAlthough one of the dead man's companions was now quite close, Waldo\r\ncould not relinquish his weapon without an effort--it had cost him\r\nconsiderable time to make, and twice today it had saved his life.\r\nForgetful that he had ever been a coward he leaped toward the fallen\r\nman, reaching his side at the same instant as his foremost pursuer.\r\n\r\nThe two came together like mad bulls--the savage reaching for Waldo's\r\nthroat, Waldo wielding his light cudgel. For a moment they struggled\r\nbackward and forward, turning and twisting, the cave man in an effort\r\nto close upon Waldo's wind, Waldo to hold the other at arm's length for\r\nthe brief instant that would be necessary for one sudden, effective\r\nblow from the cudgel.\r\n\r\nThe other savages were almost upon them when the young man found his\r\nantagonist's throat. Throwing all his weight and strength into the\r\neffort, Waldo forced the cave man back until there was room between\r\nthem for the play of the stick. A single blow was sufficient.\r\n\r\nAs the limp body of his foeman slipped from his grasp, Waldo snatched\r\nhis precious spear from the heart of its victim, and with the hands of\r\nthe infuriated pack almost upon him, turned once more into his flight\r\ntoward the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe howling band was close upon his heels now, nor could he greatly\r\nincrease the distance that separated him from them. He wondered what\r\nthe outcome of the matter was to be; he did not wish to die. His\r\nthoughts kept reverting to his boyhood home, to his indulgent mother,\r\nto the friends that had been his. He felt that at the last moment he\r\nwas about to lose his nerve--that, after all, his hard earned manliness\r\nwas counterfeit.\r\n\r\nThen there came to him a vision of an oval, olive face framed by a mass\r\nof soft, black hair; and before it the fear of death dissolved into a\r\ngrim smile. He did not pause to analyze the reason for it--nor could he\r\nhave done so then had he tried. He only knew that with those eyes upon\r\nhim he could not be aught else than courageous.\r\n\r\nA moment later he burst through the last fringe of underbrush to emerge\r\nupon the clearing that faced the sea.\r\n\r\nThere by a tiny rivulet he saw a sight that filled him with\r\nthanksgiving, and farther out upon the ocean that which he had been\r\nwaiting and hoping for for all these long, hard months--a ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA CHOICE\r\n\r\n\r\nSeamen upon the beach were filling water-casks.\r\n\r\nThere were a dozen of them, and as Waldo plunged from the forest they\r\nlooked with startled apprehension at the strange apparition. A great,\r\nbrown giant they saw, clad in a few ragged strings of white duck, for\r\nWaldo had kept his apparel as immaculately clean as hard rubbing in\r\ncold water would permit.\r\n\r\nIn one hand the strange creature carried a long, bloody spear, in the\r\nother a light cudgel. Long, yellow hair streamed back over his broad\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the men--those who were armed--leveled guns and revolvers at\r\nhim; but when, as he drew closer, they saw a broad grin upon his face,\r\nand heard in perfectly good English, \"Don't shoot; I'm a white man,\"\r\nthey lowered their weapons and awaited him.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely reached them when they saw a swarm of naked men dash\r\nfrom the forest in his wake. Waldo saw their eyes directed past him and\r\nknew that his pursuers had come into view.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to shoot at them, I imagine,\" he said. \"They're not\r\nexactly domesticated. Try firing over their heads at first; maybe you\r\ncan scare them away without hurting any of them.\"\r\n\r\nHe disliked the idea of seeing the poor savages slaughtered. It didn't\r\nseem just like fair play to mow them down with bullets.\r\n\r\nThe sailors followed his suggestion. At the first reports the cave men\r\nhalted in surprise and consternation.\r\n\r\n\"Let's rush 'em,\" suggested one of the men, and this was all that was\r\nneeded to send them scurrying back into the woods.\r\n\r\nWaldo found that the ship was English, and that all the men spoke his\r\nmother tongue in more or less understandable fashion. The second mate,\r\nwho was in charge of the landing party, proved to have originated in\r\nBoston. It was much like being at home again.\r\n\r\nWaldo was so excited and wanted to ask so many questions all at once\r\nthat he became almost unintelligible. It seemed scarcely possible that\r\na ship had really come.\r\n\r\nHe realized now that he had never actually entertained any very\r\ndefinite belief that a ship ever would come to this out-of-the-way\r\ncorner of the world. He had hoped and dreamed, but down in the bottom\r\nof his heart he must have felt that years might elapse before he would\r\nbe rescued.\r\n\r\nEven now it was difficult to believe that these were really civilized\r\nbeings like himself.\r\n\r\nThey were on their way to a civilized world; they would soon be\r\nsurrounded by their families and friends, and he, Waldo Emerson\r\nSmith-Jones, was going with them!\r\n\r\nIn a few months he would see his mother and his father and all his\r\nfriends--he would be among his books once more.\r\n\r\nEven as the last thought flashed through his mind it was succeeded by\r\nmild wonderment that this outlook failed to raise his temperature as he\r\nmight have expected that it would. His books had been his real life in\r\nthe past--could it be that they had lost something of their glamour?\r\nHad his brief experience with the realities of life dulled the edge of\r\nhis appetite for second-hand hopes, aspirations, deeds, and emotions?\r\n\r\nIt had.\r\n\r\nWaldo yet craved his books, but they alone would no longer suffice. He\r\nwanted something bigger, something more real and tangible--he wanted to\r\nread and study, but even more he wanted to do. And back there in his\r\nown world there would be plenty awaiting the doing.\r\n\r\nHis heart thrilled at the possibilities that lay before the new\r\nWaldo Emerson--possibilities of which he never would have dreamed\r\nbut for the strange chance which had snatched him bodily from one\r\nlife to throw him into this new one, which had forced upon him the\r\ndevelopment of attributes of self-reliance, courage, initiative, and\r\nresourcefulness that would have lain dormant within him always but for\r\nthe necessity which had given birth to them.\r\n\r\nYes, Waldo realized that he owed a great deal to this experience--a\r\ngreat deal to--. And then a sudden realization of the truth rushed in\r\nupon him--he owed everything to Nadara.\r\n\r\n\"I was never ship-wrecked on a desert island,\" said the second mate,\r\nbreaking in upon Waldo's reveries, \"but I can imagine just about how\r\ngood you feel at the thought that you are at last rescued and that in\r\nan hour or so you will see the shoreline of your prison growing smaller\r\nand smaller upon the southern horizon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" acquiesced Waldo in a far away voice: \"it's awfully good of you,\r\nbut I am not going with you.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo hours later Waldo Emerson stood alone upon the beach, watching the\r\ndiminishing hull of a great ship as it dropped over the rim of the\r\nworld far to the north.\r\n\r\nA vague hint of tears dimmed his vision; then he threw back his\r\nshoulders, swallowed the thing that had risen into his throat, and\r\nwith high held head turned back into the forest.\r\n\r\nIn one hand he carried a razor and a plug of tobacco--the sole mementos\r\nof his recent brief contact with the world of civilization. The kindly\r\nsailors had urged him to reconsider his decision, but when he remained\r\nobdurate they had insisted that they be permitted to leave some of the\r\ncomforts of life with him.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that he could think of that he wanted very badly\r\nwas a razor--firearms he would not accept, for he had worked out a\r\nrather fine chivalry of his own here in this savage world--a chivalry\r\nwhich would not permit him to take any advantage over the primeval\r\ninhabitants he had found here other than what his own hands and head\r\nmight give him.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment one of the seamen, prompted by a generous heart and\r\na keen realization of what life must be without even bare necessities,\r\nhad thrust upon Waldo the plug of tobacco. As he looked at it now the\r\nyoung man smiled.\r\n\r\n\"That would indeed be the last step, according to mother's ideas,\" he\r\nsoliloquized. \"No lower could I sink.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship that bore away Waldo's chance of escape carried also a long\r\nletter to Waldo's mother. In portions it was rather vague and rambling.\r\nIt mentioned, among other things, that he had an obligation to fulfil\r\nbefore he could leave his present habitat; but that the moment he was\r\nfree he should \"take the first steamer for Boston.\"\r\n\r\nThe skipper of the ship which had just sailed away had told Waldo\r\nthat in so far as he knew there might never be another ship touch\r\nhis island, which was so far out of the beaten course that only the\r\nshoreline of it had ever been explored, and scarce a score of vessels\r\nhad reported it since Captain Cook discovered it in 1773.\r\n\r\nYet it was in the face of this that Waldo had refused to leave. As\r\nhe walked slowly through the wood on his way back toward his cave he\r\ntried to convince himself that he had acted purely from motives of\r\ngratitude and fairness--that as a gentleman he could do no less than\r\nsee Nadara and thank her for the friendly services she had rendered\r\nhim; but for some reason this seemed a very futile and childish excuse\r\nfor relinquishing what might easily be his only opportunity to return\r\nto civilization.\r\n\r\nHis final decision was that he had acted the part of a fool; yet as he\r\nwalked he hummed a joyous tune, and his heart was full of happiness and\r\npleasant expectations of what he could not have told.\r\n\r\nTo one thing he had made up his mind, and that was that the next sun\r\nwould see him on his way to the village of Nadara. His experience with\r\nthe savages that day had convinced him that he might with reasonable\r\nsafety face Flatfoot and Korth.\r\n\r\nThe more he dwelt upon this idea the more light-hearted he became--he\r\ncould not understand it. He should be plunged into the blackest\r\ndespair, for had he not but just relinquished a chance to return\r\nhome, and was he not within a day or two to enter the village of the\r\nferocious Flatfoot and the mighty Korth? Even so, his heart sang.\r\n\r\nWaldo saw nothing of his enemies of the earlier part of the day as\r\nhe moved cautiously through the forest or crossed the little plains\r\nand meadows which lay along the route between the ocean and his lair;\r\nbut his thoughts often reverted to them and to his adventures of the\r\nmorning, and the result was that he became aware of a deficiency in his\r\nequipment--a deficiency which his recent battle made glaringly apparent.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there were two points that might be easily remedied. One was\r\nthe lack of a shield. Had he had protection of this nature he would\r\nhave been in comparatively little danger from the shower of missiles\r\nthat the savages had flung at him.\r\n\r\nThe other was a sword. With a sword and shield he could have let his\r\nenemies come to very close quarters with perfect impunity to himself\r\nand then have run them through with infinite ease.\r\n\r\nThis new idea would necessitate a delay in his plans; he must finish\r\nboth shield and sword before he departed for the village of Flatfoot.\r\nWhat with his meditation and his planning, Waldo had made poor time on\r\nthe return journey from the coast so that it was after sunset when he\r\nentered the last deep ravine beyond the farther summit of which lay\r\nhis rocky home. In the depths of the ravine it was already quite dark,\r\nthough a dim twilight still hung upon the surrounding hill-tops.\r\n\r\nHe had about completed the arduous ascent of the last steep trail, at\r\nthe crest of which was his journey's end, when above him, silhouetted\r\nagainst the darkening sky, loomed a great black, crouching mass, from\r\nthe center of which blazed two balls of fire.\r\n\r\nIt was Nagoola, and he occupied the center of the only trail that led\r\nover the edge of the ridge from the ravine below.\r\n\r\n\"I had almost forgotten you, Nagoola,\" murmured Waldo Emerson. \"I could\r\nnever have gone upon my journey without first interviewing you, but I\r\ncould have wished a different time and place than this. Let us postpone\r\nthe matter for a day or so,\" he concluded aloud; but the only response\r\nfrom Nagoola was an ominous growl. Waldo felt rather uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nHe could not have come upon the great, black panther at a more\r\ninopportune time or place. It was too dark for Waldo's human eyes, and\r\nthe cat was above him and Waldo upon a steep hillside that under the\r\nbest of conditions offered but a precarious foothold. He tried to shoo\r\nthe formidable beast away by shouts and menacing gesticulations, but\r\nNagoola would not shoo.\r\n\r\nInstead he crept slowly forward, edging his sinuous body inch by inch\r\nalong the rocky trail until it hung poised above the waiting man a\r\ndozen feet below him.\r\n\r\nSix months before Waldo would long since have been shrieking in\r\nmeteorlike flight down the bed of the ravine behind him. That a\r\nwonderful transformation had been wrought within him was evident from\r\nthe fact that no cry of fright escaped him, and that, far from fleeing,\r\nhe edged inch by inch upward toward the menacing creature hanging there\r\nabove him. He carried his spear with the point leveled a trifle below\r\nthose baleful eyes.\r\n\r\nHe had advanced but a foot or two, however, when, with an awful shriek,\r\nthe terrible beast launched itself full upon him.\r\n\r\nAs the heavy body struck him Waldo went over backward down the cliff,\r\nand with him went Nagoola.\r\n\r\nClawing, tearing, and scratching, the two rolled and bounded down\r\nthe rocky hillside until, near the bottom, they came to a sudden stop\r\nagainst a large tree.\r\n\r\nThe growling and screeching ceased, the clawing paws and hands were\r\nstill. Presently the tropic moon rose over the hill-top to look down\r\nupon a little tangled mound of man and beast that lay very quiet\r\nagainst the bole of a great tree near the bottom of a dark ravine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHANDAR, THE SEEKER\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time there was no sign of life in that strange pile of\r\nflesh and bone and brawn and glossy black fur and long, yellow hair\r\nand blood. But toward dawn it moved a little, down near the bottom of\r\nthe heap, and a little later there was a groan, and then all was still\r\nagain for many minutes.\r\n\r\nPresently it moved again, this time more energetically, and after\r\nseveral efforts a yellow head streaked and matted with blood emerged\r\nfrom beneath. It required the better part of an hour for the stunned\r\nand lacerated Waldo to extricate himself from the entangling embrace of\r\nNagoola.\r\n\r\nWhen, finally, he staggered to his feet he saw that the great cat lay\r\ndead before him, the broken shaft of the spear protruding from the\r\nsleek, black breast.\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that the beast had lived but the barest fraction\r\nof an instant after it had launched itself upon the man; but during\r\nthat brief interval of time it had wrought sore havoc with its mighty\r\ntalons, though fortunately for Waldo the great jaws had not found him.\r\n\r\nFrom breast to knees ghastly wounds were furrowed in the man's brown\r\nskin where the powerful hind feet of the beast had raked him.\r\n\r\nThat he owed his life to the chance that had brought about the\r\nencounter upon a steep hillside rather than on the level seemed quite\r\napparent, for during their tumble down the declivity Nagoola had been\r\nunable to score with any degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nAs Waldo looked down upon himself he was at first horrified by the\r\nfrightful appearance of his wounds; but when a closer examination\r\nshowed them to be superficial he realized that the only danger lay\r\nin infection. Every bone and muscle in his body ached from the\r\nman-handling and the fall, and the wounds themselves were painful,\r\nalmost excruciatingly so when a movement of his body stretched or tore\r\nthem; but notwithstanding his suffering he found himself smiling as he\r\ncontemplated the remnants of his long-suffering ducks.\r\n\r\nThere remained of their once stylish glory not a shred--the panther's\r\nsharp claws had finished what time and brambles had so well commenced.\r\nAnd of their linen partner--the white outing shirt--only the neckband\r\nremained; with a single fragment as large as one's hand depending\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\"Nature is a wonderful leveler,\" thought Waldo. \"It is evident that\r\nshe hates artificiality as she does a vacuum. I shall really need you\r\nnow,\" he concluded, looking at the beautiful, black coat of Nagoola.\r\n\r\nDespite his suffering, Waldo crawled to his lair, where he selected a\r\ncouple of sharp-edged stones from his collection and returned to the\r\nside of Nagoola.\r\n\r\nLeaving his tools there he went on down to the bottom of the ravine,\r\nwhere in a little crystal stream he bathed his wounds. Then he returned\r\nonce more to his kill.\r\n\r\nAfter half a day of the most arduous labor Waldo succeeded in removing\r\nthe panther's hide, which he dragged laboriously to his lair, where he\r\nfell exhausted, unable even to crawl within.\r\n\r\nThe next day Waldo worked upon the inner surface of the hide, removing\r\nevery particle of flesh by scraping it with a sharp stone, so that\r\nthere might be no danger of decomposition.\r\n\r\nHe was still very weak and sore, but he could not bear the thought of\r\nlosing the pelt that had cost him so much to obtain.\r\n\r\nWhen the last vestige of flesh had been scraped away he crawled into\r\nhis lair, where he remained for a week, only emerging for food and\r\nwater. At the end of that time his wounds were almost healed, and\r\nhe had entirely recovered from his lameness and the shock of the\r\nadventure, so that it was with real pleasure and exultation that he\r\ngloated over his beautiful trophy.\r\n\r\nAlways as he thought of the time that he should have it made ready for\r\ngirting about his loins he saw himself, not through his own eyes, but\r\nas he imagined that another would see him, and that other was Nadara.\r\n\r\nFor many days Waldo scraped and pounded the great skin as he had seen\r\nthe cave men scrape and pound in the brief instant he had watched them\r\nwith Nadara from the edge of the forest before the village of Flatfoot.\r\nAt last he was rewarded with a pelt sufficiently pliable for the\r\npurpose of the rude apparel he contemplated.\r\n\r\nA strip an inch wide he trimmed off to form a supporting belt. With\r\nthis he tied the black skin about his waist, passed one arm through a\r\nhole he had made for that purpose near the upper edge; bringing the\r\nfore paws forward about his chest, he crossed and fastened them to\r\nsecure the garment from falling from the upper part of his body.\r\n\r\nIt was a very proud Waldo that strutted forth in the finery of his new\r\napparel; but the pride was in the prowess that had won the thing for\r\nhim--vulgar, gross, brutal physical prowess--the very attribute upon\r\nwhich he had looked with supercilious contempt six months before.\r\n\r\nNext Waldo turned his attention toward the fashioning of a sword,\r\na new spear, and a shield. The first two were comparatively easy of\r\naccomplishment--he had them both completed in half a day, and from a\r\ntwo-inch strip of panther hide he made also a sword belt to pass over\r\nhis right shoulder and support his sword at his left side; but the\r\nshield almost defied his small skill and new-born ingenuity.\r\n\r\nWith small twigs and grasses he succeeded, after nearly a week of\r\npainstaking endeavor, in weaving a rude, oval buckler some three feet\r\nlong by two wide, which he covered with the skins of several small\r\nanimals that had fallen before his death-dealing stones. A strip of\r\nhide fastened upon the back of the shield held it to his left arm.\r\n\r\nWith it Waldo felt more secure against the swiftly thrown missiles of\r\nthe savages he knew he should encounter on his forthcoming expedition.\r\n\r\nAt last came the morning for departure. Rising with the sun, Waldo\r\ntook his morning \"tub\" in the cold spring that rose a few yards from\r\nhis cave, then he got out the razor that the sailor had given him, and\r\nafter scraping off his scanty, yellow beard, hacked his tawny hair\r\nuntil it no longer fell about his shoulders and in his eyes.\r\n\r\nThen he gathered up his weapons, rolled the boulders before the\r\nentrance to his cave, and turning his back upon his rough home set\r\noff down the little stream toward the distant valley where it wound\r\nthrough the forest along the face of the cliffs to Flatfoot and Korth.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped lightly along the hazardous trail, leaping from ledge\r\nto ledge in the descent of the many sheer drops over which the stream\r\nfell, he might have been a reincarnation of some primeval hunter from\r\nwhose savage loins had sprung the warriors and the strong men of a\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe tall, well-muscled, brown body; the clear, bright eyes; the\r\nhigh-held head; the sword, the spear, the shield were all a far cry\r\nfrom the weak and futile thing that had lain groveling in the sand upon\r\nthe beach, sweating and shrieking in terror six short months before.\r\nAnd yet it was the same.\r\n\r\nWhat one good but mistaken woman had smothered another had brought out,\r\nand the result of the influence of both was a much finer specimen of\r\nmanhood than either might have evolved alone.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the third day Waldo came to the forest opposite the\r\ncliffs where lay the home of Nadara. Cautiously he stole from tree to\r\ntree until he could look out unseen upon the honeycombed face of the\r\nlofty escarpment.\r\n\r\nAll was lifeless and deserted. The cave mouths looked out upon the\r\nvalley, sad and lonely. There was no sign of life in any direction as\r\nfar as Waldo could see.\r\n\r\nComing from the forest he crossed the clearing and approached the\r\ncliffs. His eye, now become alert in woodcraft, detected the young\r\ngrass growing in what had once been well-beaten trails. He needed no\r\nfurther evidence to assure him that the caves were deserted, and had\r\nbeen for some time.\r\n\r\nOne by one he entered and explored several of the cliff dwellings. All\r\ngave the same mute corroboration of what was everywhere apparent--the\r\nvillage had been evacuated without haste in an orderly manner.\r\nEverything of value had been removed--only a few broken utensils\r\nremaining as indication that it had ever constituted human habitation.\r\n\r\nWaldo was utterly confounded. He had not the remotest idea in which\r\ndirection to search. During the balance of the afternoon he wandered\r\nalong the various ledges, entering first one cave and then another.\r\n\r\nHe wondered which had been Nadara's. He tried to imagine her life among\r\nthese crude, primitive surroundings; among the beast-like men and women\r\nwho were her people. She did not seem to harmonize with either. He was\r\nconvinced that she was more out of place here than Flatfoot would have\r\nbeen in a Back Bay drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe more his mind dwelt upon her the sadder he became. He tried to\r\nconvince himself that it was purely disappointment in being thwarted\r\nin his desire to thank her for her kindness to him, and demonstrate\r\nthat her confidence in his prowess had not been misplaced; but always\r\nhe discovered that his thoughts returned to Nadara rather than to the\r\nostensible object of his adventure.\r\n\r\nIn short he began to realize, rather vaguely it is true, that he had\r\ncome because he wanted to see the girl again; but why he wanted to see\r\nher he did not know.\r\n\r\nThat night he slept in one of the deserted caves, and the next morning\r\nset forth upon his quest for Nadara. For three days he searched the\r\nlittle valley, but without results. There was no sign of any other\r\nvillage within it.\r\n\r\nThen he passed over into another valley to the north. For weeks he\r\nwandered hither and thither without being rewarded by even a sight of a\r\nhuman being.\r\n\r\nEarly one afternoon as he was topping a barrier in search of other\r\nvalleys he came suddenly face to face with a great, hairy man. Both\r\nstopped--the hairy one glaring with his nasty little eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I can kill you,\" growled the savage.\r\n\r\nWaldo had no desire to fight--it was information he was searching. But\r\nhe almost smiled at the ready greeting of the man. It was the same that\r\nSag the Killer had accorded him that day he had gone down to the sea\r\nfor the last time.\r\n\r\nIt came as readily and as glibly from these primitive men as \"good\r\nmorning\" falls from the lips of the civilized races, yet among the\r\nlatter he realized that it had its counterpart in the stony stares\r\nwhich Anglo Saxon strangers vouchsafe one another.\r\n\r\n\"I have no quarrel with you,\" replied Waldo. \"Let us be friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are afraid,\" taunted the hairy one.\r\n\r\nWaldo pointed to his sable garment.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Nagoola,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe man looked at the trophy. There could be no mightier argument for a\r\nman's valor than that. He came a step closer that he might scrutinize\r\nit more carefully.\r\n\r\n\"Full-grown and in perfect health,\" he grunted to himself. \"This is\r\nno worn and mangy hide peeled from the rotting carcass of one dead of\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\n\"How did you slay Nagoola?\" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nWaldo indicated his spear, then he drew his garment aside and pointed\r\nto the vivid, new-healed scars that striped his body.\r\n\r\n\"We met at dusk at a cliff-top. He was above, I below. When we reached\r\nthe bottom of the ravine Nagoola was dead. But it was nothing for\r\nThandar. I am Thandar.\"\r\n\r\nWaldo rightly suspected that a little bravado would make a good\r\nimpression on the intellect primeval, nor was he mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"What do you here in my country?\" asked the man, but his tone was less\r\ntruculent than before.\r\n\r\n\"I am searching for Flatfoot and Korth--and Nadara,\" said Waldo.\r\n\r\nThe other's eyes narrowed.\r\n\r\n\"What would you of them?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nadara was good to me--I would repay her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Flatfoot and Korth--what of them?\" insisted the man.\r\n\r\n\"My business is with them. When I see them I shall transact it,\" Waldo\r\nparried, for he had seen the cunning look in the man's eyes and he did\r\nnot like it. \"Can you lead me to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you where they are, but I am not bound thither,\" replied\r\nthe man. \"Three days toward the setting sun will bring you to the\r\nvillage of Flatfoot. There you will find Korth also--and Nadara,\" and\r\nwithout further parley the savage turned and trotted toward the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nNADARA AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWaldo watched him out of sight, half minded to follow, for he was far\r\nfrom satisfied that the fellow had been entirely honest with him. Why\r\nhe should have been otherwise Waldo could not imagine, but nevertheless\r\nthere had been an indefinable suggestion of duplicity in the man's\r\nbehavior that had puzzled him.\r\n\r\nHowever, Waldo took up his search toward the west, passing down from\r\nthe hills into a deep valley, the bottom of which was overgrown by a\r\nthick tangle of tropical jungle.\r\n\r\nHe had forced his way through this for nearly half a mile when he\r\ncame to the bank of a wide, slow-moving river. Its water was thick\r\nwith sediment--not clean, sparkling, and inviting, as were the little\r\nmountain streams of the hills and valleys farther south.\r\n\r\nWaldo traveled along the edge of the river in a northwesterly\r\ndirection, searching for a ford. The steep, muddy banks offered no\r\nfoothold, so he dared not venture a crossing until he could be sure of\r\na safe landing upon the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nA couple of hundred yards from the point at which he had come upon the\r\nstream he found a broad trail leading down into the water, and on the\r\nother side saw a similar track cutting up through the bank.\r\n\r\nThis, evidently, was the ford he sought, but as he started toward the\r\nriver he noticed the imprints of the feet of many animals--human and\r\nbrute.\r\n\r\nWaldo stooped to examine them minutely. There were the broad pads of\r\nNagoola, the smaller imprints of countless rodents, but back and forth\r\namong them all were old and new signs of man.\r\n\r\nThere were the great, flat-foot prints of huge adult males, the smaller\r\nbut equally flat-footed impresses of the women and children; but one\r\nthere was that caught his eye particularly.\r\n\r\nIt was the fine and dainty outline of a perfect foot, with the arch\r\nwell defined. It was new, as were many of the others, and, like the\r\nother newer ones, it led down to the river and then back again, as\r\nthough she who made it had come for water and then returned from whence\r\nshe had come. Waldo knew that the tracks leading away from the river\r\nwere the newer, because where the two trails overlapped those coming up\r\nfrom the ford were always over those which led downward.\r\n\r\nThe multiplicity of signs indicated a considerable community, and their\r\nnewness the proximity of the makers.\r\n\r\nWaldo hesitated but a moment before he reached a decision, and then he\r\nturned up the trail away from the river, and at a rapid trot followed\r\nthe spoor along its winding course through the jungle to where it\r\nemerged at the base of the foothills, to wind upward toward their crest.\r\n\r\nHe found that the trail he was following crossed the hills but a few\r\nyards from the spot at which he had met the cave man a short time\r\nbefore. Evidently the man had been returning from the river when he had\r\nespied Waldo.\r\n\r\nThe young man could see where the fellow's tracks had left the main\r\ntrail, and he followed them to the point where the man had stood during\r\nhis conversation with Waldo; from there they led toward the east for\r\na short distance, and then turned suddenly north to reenter the main\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\nWaldo could see that as soon as the man had reached a point from which\r\nhe would be safe from the stranger's observation he had broken into a\r\nrapid trot, and as he already had two hours' start Waldo felt that he\r\nwould have to hurry were he to overtake him.\r\n\r\nJust why he wished to do so he did not consider, but, intuitively\r\npossibly, he felt that the surly brute could give him much more and\r\naccurate information than he had. Nor could Waldo eliminate the memory\r\nof those dainty feminine footprints.\r\n\r\nIt was foolish, of course, and he fully realized the fact; but his\r\nsilly mind would insist upon attributing them to the cave girl--Nadara.\r\n\r\nFor two hours he trotted doggedly along the trail, which for the most\r\npart was well defined. There were places, of course, which taxed his\r\ntrailing ability, but by circling widely from these points he always\r\nwas able to pick up the tracks again.\r\n\r\nHe had come down from the hills and entered an open forest, where the\r\ntrail was entirely lost in the mossy carpet that lay beneath the trees,\r\nwhen he was startled by a scream--a woman's scream--and the hoarse\r\ngutturals of two men, deep and angry.\r\n\r\nHastening toward the sound, Waldo came upon the authors of the\r\ncommotion in a little glade half hidden by surrounding bushes.\r\n\r\nThere were three actors in the hideous tragedy--a hairy brute dragging\r\na protesting girl by her long, black hair and an old man, who followed,\r\nprotesting futilely against the outrage that threatened the young woman.\r\n\r\nNone of them saw Waldo as he ran toward them until he was almost upon\r\nthem, and then the beast who grasped the girl looked up, and Waldo\r\nrecognized him as the same who had sent him toward the west earlier in\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant he saw the girl was Nadara.\r\n\r\nIn the brief interval that the recognition required there sloughed from\r\nthe heart and mind and soul of Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones every particle\r\nof the civilization and culture and refinement that had required\r\ncountless ages in the building, stripping him naked, age on age, down\r\nto the primordial beast that had begot his first human progenitor.\r\n\r\nHe saw red through blood as he leaped for the throat of the man-beast\r\nwhose ruthless hands were upon Nadara.\r\n\r\nHis lip curled in the fighting snarl that exposed his long-unused\r\ncanine fangs.\r\n\r\nHe forgot sword and shield and spear.\r\n\r\nHe was no longer a man, but a terrible beast; and the hairy brute that\r\nwitnessed the metamorphosis blanched and shrank back in fear.\r\n\r\nBut he could not escape the fury of that mad charge or the raging\r\ncreature that sought his throat.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they struggled in a surging, swaying embrace, and then\r\ntoppled to the ground--the hairy one beneath.\r\n\r\nRolling, tearing, and biting, they battled--each seeking a death hold\r\nupon the other.\r\n\r\nTime and again the gleaming teeth of the once-fastidious Bostonian sank\r\ninto the breast and shoulder of his antagonist, but it was the jugular\r\nhis primal instinct sought.\r\n\r\nThe girl and the old man had drawn away where they could watch the\r\nbattle in safety. Nadara's eyes were wide in fascination.\r\n\r\nHer slim, brown hands were tight pressed against her rapidly rising\r\nand falling breasts as she leaned a little forward with parted lips,\r\ndrinking in every detail of the conflict between the two beasts.\r\n\r\nAh, but was the yellow-haired giant really fighting for possession of\r\nher, or merely in protection, because she was a woman?\r\n\r\nShe could readily conceive from her knowledge of him that he might be\r\nacting now solely from some peculiar sense of duty which she realized\r\nthat he might entertain, although she could not herself understand it.\r\n\r\nYes, that was it, and when he had conquered his rival he would run away\r\nagain, as he had months before. At the thought Nadara felt herself\r\nflush with mortification. No, he should never have another opportunity\r\nto repeat that terrible affront.\r\n\r\nAs she allowed her mind to dwell on the humiliating moment that had\r\nwitnessed the discovery that Thandar had fled from her at the very\r\nthreshold of her home Nadara found herself hating him again as fiercely\r\nas she had all these long months--a hatred that had almost dissolved\r\nat sight of him as he rushed out of the underbrush a moment before to\r\nwrest her from the clutches of her hideous tormentor.\r\n\r\nWaldo and his antagonist were still tearing futilely at one another\r\nin mad efforts to maim or kill. The giant muscles of the cave man\r\ngave him but little if any advantage over his agile, though slightly\r\nless-powerful, adversary.\r\n\r\nThe hairy one used his teeth to better advantage, with the result that\r\nWaldo was badly torn and bleeding from a dozen wounds.\r\n\r\nBoth were weakening now, and it seemed to the girl who watched that the\r\nyounger man would be the first to succumb to the terrific strain under\r\nwhich both had been. She took a step forward and, stooping, picked up a\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nHer small strength would be ample to turn the scales as she might\r\nchoose--a sharp blow upon the head of either would give his adversary\r\nthe trifling advantage that would spell death for the one she struck.\r\n\r\nThe two men had struggled to their feet again as she approached with\r\nraised weapon.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment that it left her hand they swung completely round,\r\nso that Waldo faced her, and in the instant before the missile struck\r\nhis forehead he saw Nadara in the very act of throwing--upon her face\r\nan expression of hatred and loathing.\r\n\r\nThen he lost consciousness and went down, dragging with him the cave\r\nman, upon whose throat his fingers had just found their hold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SEEKER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the old man saw what had happened he ran forward and grasped\r\nNadara by the wrist.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" he cried--\"quick, my daughter! You have killed him who would\r\nhave saved you, and now nothing but flight may keep Korth from having\r\nhis way with you.\"\r\n\r\nAs in a trance the girl turned and departed with him.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely disappeared within the underbrush when Waldo returned\r\nto consciousness, so slight had been the effect of the blow upon his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise he found the cave man lying very still beside him, but\r\nan instant later he read the reason for it in the little projecting\r\nridge of rock upon which lay his foe's forehead--in falling the savage\r\nman had struck thus and lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately the hairy one opened his eyes, but before he could\r\ngather his scattered senses sinewy fingers found his throat, and he\r\nlapsed once more into oblivion--from which there was no awakening.\r\n\r\nAs Waldo staggered to his feet he saw that the girl had vanished, and\r\nthere swept back into his mind the memory of the hate that had been in\r\nher face as she struck him down.\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible that she should have turned against him so, and\r\nat the very moment, too, when he had risked his life in her service;\r\nbut that she had there could be no doubt, for he had seen her cast\r\nthe stone--with his own eyes he had seen her, and, too, he had seen\r\nthe hatred and loathing in her face as she looked straight into his.\r\nBut what he had not seen was the look of horror that followed as the\r\nmissile struck him instead of Korth, sending him crumpling to earth.\r\n\r\nSlowly Waldo turned away from the scene of battle, and without even a\r\nsecond look at his vanquished enemy limped painfully into the brush.\r\nHis heart was very heavy and he was weak from exhaustion and loss\r\nof blood, but he staggered on, back toward his mountain lair, as he\r\nthought, until unable to go further he sank down upon a little grassy\r\nknoll and slept.\r\n\r\nWhen Nadara recovered from the shock of the thing she had done\r\nsufficiently to reason for herself she realized that after all Thandar\r\nmight not be dead, and though the old man protested long and loudly\r\nagainst it, she insisted upon retracing her steps toward the spot where\r\nthey had left the yellow giant in the clutches of Korth.\r\n\r\nVery cautiously the girl threaded her way through the maze of shrubbery\r\nand creepers that filled the intervening space between the forest\r\ntrees, until she came silently to the edge of the clearing in which the\r\ntwo had fought.\r\n\r\nAs she peered anxiously through the last curtain of foliage she saw a\r\nsingle body lying quiet and still upon the sward, and an instant later\r\nrecognized it as Korth's. For several minutes she watched it before she\r\nbecame convinced that the man who had so terrorized her whole childish\r\nlife could never again offer her harm.\r\n\r\nShe looked about for Thandar, but he was nowhere to be seen. Nadara\r\ncould scarcely believe that her eyes were not deceiving her.\r\n\r\nIt was incredible that the yellow one could have gone down to\r\nunconsciousness before her unintentional blow and yet have mastered the\r\nmighty Korth; but how else could Korth have met his death and Thandar\r\nbe gone?\r\n\r\nShe approached quite close to the dead man, turning the body over with\r\nher foot until the throat was visible. There she saw the finger-marks\r\nthat had done the work, and with a little thrill of pride she turned\r\nback into the forest, calling Thandar's name aloud.\r\n\r\nBut Thandar did not hear. Half a mile away he lay weak and unconscious\r\nfrom loss of blood.\r\n\r\nMorning found Nadara sleeping in a sturdy tree upon the trail along\r\nwhich Waldo had followed Korth. She had discovered the footprints\r\nof the two men the evening before while she had been searching\r\nunsuccessfully for the trail which Waldo had followed after the battle.\r\nShe hoped now that the spoor might lead her to Thandar's cave, to which\r\nshe felt it quite possible he might have returned by another way.\r\n\r\nWhen the girl awoke she again took up her journey, following the tracks\r\nas unerringly as a hound up through the hilly country, across the\r\ndivide and down into the jungle to the very watering place at which her\r\ntribe had drank a few days earlier. Here she made a brief stay.\r\n\r\nThen on again down the river, back through the jungle and onto the\r\ndivide once more. She was much mystified by the windings of the trail,\r\nbut for days she followed the fading spoor until, becoming fainter and\r\nfainter as it grew older, she lost it entirely at last.\r\n\r\nShe was quite sure by now, however, that it led from her tribe's former\r\nterritory, and so she kept on, hoping against hope, that soon she would\r\ncome across the fresh track of Thandar where he had passed her on his\r\nreturn journey to his home.\r\n\r\nNadara had eluded the old man when she started upon her search for\r\nThandar, so it was that the old fellow returned to the dwellings of\r\nhis people alone the following day.\r\n\r\nFlatfoot was the first to greet him.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the girl?\" he growled. \"And where is Korth? Has he taken her?\r\nAnswer me the truth or I will break every bone in your carcass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know where the girl is,\" answered the old man truthfully\r\nenough, \"but Korth lies dead in the little glade beyond the three great\r\ntrees. A mighty man killed him as he was dragging Nadara off into the\r\nthicket----\"\r\n\r\n\"And the man has taken the girl for himself?\" yelled Flatfoot. \"You old\r\nthief you. This is some of your work. Always have you tried to cheat\r\nme of this girl since first you knew that I desired her. Whither went\r\nthey? Quick! before I kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" replied the old man. \"For hours I searched, until\r\ndarkness came, but neither of them could I find, and my old eyes are no\r\nlonger keen for trailing, so I was forced to abandon my hunt and return\r\nhere when morning came.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the three trees the trail starts, you say?\" cried Flatfoot. \"That\r\nis enough--I shall find them. And when I return with the girl it will\r\nbe time enough to kill you; now it would delay me too much,\" and with\r\nthat the cave man hurried away into the forest.\r\n\r\nIt took him half a day to find Nadara's trail, but at last his search\r\nwas rewarded, and as she had made no effort to hide it he moved rapidly\r\nalong in the wake of the unsuspecting girl; but he was not as swift as\r\nshe, and the chase bid fair to be a long one.\r\n\r\nWhen Waldo woke he found the sun beating down upon his face, and though\r\nhe was lame and sore he felt quite strong enough to continue his\r\njourney; but whither he should go he did not know.\r\n\r\nNow that Nadara had turned against him the island held nothing for him,\r\nand he was on the point of starting back toward his far distant lair\r\nfrom where he might visit the ocean often to watch for a passing ship,\r\nwhen the sudden decision came to him to see the girl again, regardless\r\nof her evident hostility, and learn from her own lips the exact reason\r\nof her hatred for him.\r\n\r\nHe had had no idea that the loss of her friendship would prove such\r\na blow to him, so that his pride suffered as well as his heart as he\r\ncontemplated his harrowed emotions.\r\n\r\nOf course he was reasonably sure that Nadara's attitude was due to\r\nhis ungallant desertion, for which act he had long suffered the most\r\nacute pangs of remorse and contrition. Yet he felt that her apparent\r\nvindictiveness was not warranted by even the grave offense against\r\nchivalry and gratitude of which he had been guilty.\r\n\r\nIt presently occurred to him that by the traitorous attack which\r\nhe believed that she had made upon him while he was acting in her\r\ndefense she had forfeited every claim which her former kindness might\r\nhave given her upon him, but with this realization came another--a\r\nhumiliating thought--he still wished to see her!\r\n\r\nHe, Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, had become so devoid of pride that he\r\nwould voluntarily search out one who had wronged and outraged his\r\nfriendship, with the avowed determination of seeking a reconciliation.\r\nIt was unthinkable, and yet, as he admitted the impossibility of it, he\r\nset forth in search of her.\r\n\r\nWaldo wondered not a little at the strange emotion--inherent gregarious\r\ninstinct, he thought it--which drew him toward Nadara.\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to him that during all the past solitary months he had\r\nscarcely missed the old companionship of his Back Bay friends; that for\r\nonce that they had been the subject of his reveries the cave girl had\r\nheld the center of that mental stage a thousand times.\r\n\r\nHe failed to realize that it was not the companionship of the many that\r\nhe craved; that it was not the community instinct, or that his strange\r\nlonging could be satisfied by but a single individual. No, Waldo\r\nEmerson did not know what was the matter with him, nor was it likely\r\nthat he ever would find out before it was too late.\r\n\r\nThe young man attempted to retrace his steps to the battle-ground of\r\nthe previous day, but he had been so dazed after the encounter that\r\nhe had no clear recollection of the direction he had taken after he\r\nquitted the glade.\r\n\r\nSo it was that he stumbled in precisely the opposite direction,\r\npresently emerging from the underbrush almost at the foot of a low\r\ncliff tunneled with many caves. All about were the morose, unhappy\r\ncommunity whose savage lives were spent in almost continual wandering\r\nfrom one filthy, comfortless warren to another equally foul and\r\nwretched.\r\n\r\nAt sight of them Waldo did not flee in dismay, as most certainly would\r\nhave been the case a few months earlier. Instead, he walked confidently\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\nAs he approached they ceased whatever work they were engaged upon and\r\neyed him suspiciously. Then several burly males approached him warily.\r\n\r\nAt a hundred yards they halted.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" they cried. \"If you come to our village we can kill\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Waldo could reply an old man crawled from a cave near the base\r\nof the cliff, and as his eyes fell upon the stranger he hurried as\r\nrapidly as his ancient limbs would carry him to the little knot of\r\nruffians who composed the reception committee.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to them for a moment in a low tone, and as he was talking\r\nWaldo recognized him as the old man who had accompanied Nadara on the\r\nprevious day at the battle in the glade. When he had finished speaking\r\none of the cave men assented to whatever proposal the decrepit one had\r\nmade, and Waldo saw that each of the others nodded his head in approval.\r\n\r\nThen the old man advanced slowly toward Waldo. When he had come quite\r\nclose he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I am an old man,\" he said. \"Thandar would not kill an old man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not; but how know you that my name is Thandar?\" replied\r\nWaldo.\r\n\r\n\"Nadara, she who is my daughter, has spoken of you often. Yesterday we\r\nsaw you as you battled with that son of Nagoola--Nadara told me then\r\nthat it was you. What would Thandar among the people of Flatfoot?\"\r\n\r\n\"I come as a friend,\" replied Waldo, \"among the friends of Nadara. For\r\nFlatfoot I care nothing. He is no friend of Nadara, whose friends are\r\nThandar's friends, and whose enemies are Thandar's enemies. Where is\r\nNadara--but first, where is Flatfoot? I have come to kill him.\"\r\n\r\nThe words and the savage challenge slipped as easily from the cultured\r\ntongue of Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones as though he had been born and\r\nreared in the most rocky and barren cave of this savage island, nor did\r\nthey sound strange or unusual to him. It seemed that he had said the\r\nmost natural and proper thing under the circumstances that there was to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\"Flatfoot is not here,\" said the old man, \"nor is Nadara. She--\" but\r\nhere Waldo interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"Korth, then,\" he demanded. \"Where is Korth? I can kill him first and\r\nFlatfoot when he returns.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man looked at the speaker in unfeigned surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Korth!\" he exclaimed. \"Korth is dead. Can it be that you do not know\r\nthat he, whom you killed yesterday, was Korth?\"\r\n\r\nWaldo's eyes opened as wide in surprise as had the old man's.\r\n\r\nKorth! He had killed the redoubtable Korth with his bare hands--Korth,\r\nwho could crush the skull of a full-grown man with a single blow from\r\nhis open palm.\r\n\r\nClearly he recollected the very words in which Nadara had described\r\nthis horrible brute that time she had harrowed his poor, coward nerves,\r\nas they approached the village of Flatfoot. And now he, Waldo Emerson\r\nSmith-Jones, had met and killed the creature from whom he had so\r\nfearfully fled a few months ago!\r\n\r\nAnd, wonder of wonders, he had not even thought to use the weapons upon\r\nwhich he had spent so many hours of handicraft and months of practise\r\nin preparation for just this occasion. Of a sudden he recalled the old\r\nman's statement that Nadara was not there.\r\n\r\n\"Where is she--Nadara?\" he cried, turning so suddenly upon the ancient\r\none that the old fellow drew back in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"I have done nothing to harm her,\" he cried. \"I followed and would have\r\nbrought her back, but I am old and could not find her. Once, when I was\r\nyoung, there was no better trailer or mighty warrior among my people\r\nthan I, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" exclaimed Waldo impatiently; \"but Nadara! Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" replied the old man. \"She has gone, and I could not\r\nfind her. Well do I remember how, years ago, when the trail of an enemy\r\nwas faint or the signs of game hard to find, men would come to ask me\r\nto help them, but now----\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" interrupted Waldo; \"but Nadara. Do you not even know in\r\nwhat direction she has gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but since Flatfoot has set forth upon her trail it should be easy\r\nto track the two of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flatfoot set out after Nadara!\" cried, Waldo. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"For many moons he has craved her for his mate, as has Korth,\"\r\nexplained Nadara's father; \"but I think that each feared the other, and\r\nbecause of that fact Nadara was saved from both; but at last Korth came\r\nupon us alone and away from the village, and then he grasped Nadara and\r\nwould have taken her away, for Flatfoot was not about to prevent.\r\n\r\n\"You came then, and the rest you know. If I had been younger neither\r\nFlatfoot nor Korth would have dared menace Nadara, for when I was a\r\nyoung man I was very terrible and the record of my kills was a----\"\r\n\r\n\"How long since did Flatfoot set out after Nadara?\" Waldo broke in.\r\n\r\n\"But a few hours since,\" replied the old man. \"It would be an easy\r\nthing for me to overtake him by night had I the speed of my youth, for\r\nI well remember----\"\r\n\r\n\"From where did Flatfoot start upon the trail?\" cried the young man.\r\n\"Lead me to the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"This way then, Thandar,\" said the other, starting off toward the\r\nforest. \"I will show you if you will save Nadara from Flatfoot. I love\r\nher. She has been very kind and good to me. She is unlike the rest of\r\nour people.\r\n\r\n\"I should die happy if I knew that you have saved her from Flatfoot,\r\nbut I am an old man and may not live until Nadara returns. Ah, that\r\nreminds me; there is that in my cave which belongs to Nadara, and were\r\nI to die there would be none to protect it for her.\r\n\r\n\"Will you wait for the moment that it will take me to run and fetch it,\r\nthat you may carry it to her, for I am sure that you will find her;\r\nthough I am not as sure that you will overcome Flatfoot if you meet\r\nhim. He is a very terrible man.\"\r\n\r\nWaldo hated to waste a minute of the precious time that was allowing\r\nFlatfoot to win nearer and nearer Nadara; but if it were in a service\r\nfor the girl who had been so kind to him and for the happiness of her\r\nold father he could not refuse, so he waited impatiently while the old\r\nfellow tottered off toward the caves.\r\n\r\nThose who had come half-way to meet Waldo had hovered at a safe\r\ndistance while he had been speaking to Nadara's father, and when the\r\ntwo turned toward the forest all had returned to their work in evident\r\nrelief; for the old man had told them that the stranger was the mighty\r\nwarrior who had killed the terrible Korth with his bare hands, nor had\r\nthe story lost anything in the telling.\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed hours to the waiting Waldo the old man returned with\r\na little package carefully wrapped in the skin of a small rodent, the\r\nseams laboriously sewed in a manner of lacing with pieces of gut.\r\n\r\n\"This is Nadara's,\" he said as they continued their way toward the\r\nforest. \"It contains many strange things of which I know not the\r\nmeaning or purpose. They all were taken from the body of her mother\r\nwhen the woman died. You will give them to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Waldo. \"I will give them to Nadara, or die in the trying of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE TRAIL'S END\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon they came upon the trail of Flatfoot in the glade by the three\r\ngreat trees; they had not searched for it sooner, for the old man knew\r\nthat it would start from that point upon its quest for the girl.\r\n\r\nThe tracks circled the glade a dozen times in widening laps until at\r\nlast, at the point where Flatfoot must have picked up the spoor of\r\nNadara, they broke suddenly away into the underbrush. Once the way was\r\nplain Waldo bid the old man be of good heart, for he would surely bring\r\nhis daughter back to him unharmed if the thing lay in the power of man.\r\n\r\nThen he hurried off upon the new-made trail that lay as plain and\r\nreadable before him as had the printed page of his former life; but\r\nnever had he bent with such keen interest to the reading of his\r\nfavorite author as he did to this absorbing drama written in the turned\r\nleaves, the scattered twigs, and the soft mud of a primeval forest by\r\nthe feet of a savage man and a savage maid.\r\n\r\nToward mid-afternoon Waldo became aware that he was much weaker from\r\nthe effects of his battle with Korth than he had supposed. He had lost\r\nmuch blood from his wounds, and the exertion of following the trail at\r\na swift pace had reopened some of the worse ones, so that now, as he\r\nran, he was leaving a little trail of blood behind him.\r\n\r\nThe discovery made him almost frantic, for it seemed to presage\r\nfailure. His condition would handicap him in the race after the two\r\nalong whose track he pursued so that it would be a miracle were he to\r\nreach Flatfoot before the brute overtook Nadara.\r\n\r\nAnd if he did overtake him in time--what then? Would he be physically\r\nable to cope with the brawny monster? He feared that he would not, but\r\nthat he kept doggedly to the grueling chase augured well for the new\r\nmanhood that had been so recently born within him.\r\n\r\nOn and on he stumbled, until at dusk he slipped and fell exhausted to\r\nthe earth. Twice he struggled to his feet in an attempt to go on, but\r\nhe was forced to give in, lying where he was until morning.\r\n\r\nSlightly refreshed, he ate of the roots and fruit which abounded in the\r\nforest, taking up the chase again, but this time more slowly.\r\n\r\nHe was now convinced that the way led back along the same trail which\r\nhe had followed into the country, and when he reached the point at\r\nwhich he had first met Korth on the previous day he cut across the\r\nlittle space which intervened between the cave man's tracks and the\r\npoint at which he had stood before he went down over the divide into\r\nthe jungle toward the river and the ford.\r\n\r\nA moment later he was rewarded by the sight of Nadara's dainty\r\nfootprints as well as those of Flatfoot leading away along his old\r\ntrail. The act had saved him several miles of needless tracking.\r\n\r\nAll that day he followed as rapidly as his weakened condition would\r\npermit, but his best efforts seemed dismally snail-like.\r\n\r\nAlong the way he bowled over a couple of large rodents, which he ate\r\nraw, for he had long since learned the desirability of a meat diet for\r\none undergoing severe physical exertion, and had conquered his natural\r\naversion for the uncooked flesh. He even had come to relish it, though\r\noften as he dined thus upon meat a broad grin illumined his countenance\r\nat the thought of the horror with which his mother and his Boston\r\nfriends would view such a hideous performance.\r\n\r\nAs he continued trailing the two he was at first surprised to discover\r\nthe fidelity with which Nadara had clung to his old trail, and because\r\nof this fact he often was able to save miles at a time by taking\r\ncross-cuts where, on his way in, he had made wide detours.\r\n\r\nBut at last on the third day, when he attempted this at a place which\r\nwould have saved him fully ten miles, he was dismayed by the discovery\r\nthat he could not again pick up either Nadara's trail or that of the\r\ncave man. Even his own old trail was entirely obliterated.\r\n\r\nIt was this fact which caused him the greatest concern, for it meant\r\nthat if Nadara really had been following it she must now be wandering\r\nrather aimlessly, possibly in an attempt to again locate it. In which\r\nevent her speed would be materially reduced, and the probability of her\r\ncapture by Flatfoot much enhanced.\r\n\r\nIt was possible, too, that the beast already had overtaken her--this,\r\nin fact, might be the true cause of the cessation of the pursuit along\r\nthe way which it had proceeded up to this point.\r\n\r\nThe thought sent Waldo back along his former route, which he was able\r\nto follow by recollection, though the spoor was seldom visible.\r\n\r\nHe came upon no sign of those he sought that day, but the next morning\r\nhe found the point at which Nadara had lost his old trail upon a rocky\r\nridge. The girl evidently assumed that it would lead into the valley\r\nbelow where she might pick it up again in the soft earth, and so her\r\nfootprints led down a shelving bluff, while plain above them showed the\r\nhuge imprints of Flatfoot.\r\n\r\nUp to this point at least he had not caught up with her. Waldo\r\nbreathed a sigh of relief at the discovery. The trail was at least two\r\ndays old, for Nadara and Flatfoot had traveled much more rapidly than\r\nthe wounded man who haunted their footsteps like a grim shadow.\r\n\r\nAbout noon Waldo came to a little stream at which both those who\r\npreceded him had evidently stopped to drink--he could see where they\r\nhad knelt in the soft grass at the water's edge.\r\n\r\nAs Waldo stopped to quench his own thirst his eyes rested for an\r\ninstant upon the farther bank, which at that point was little more than\r\nten feet from him. He saw that the opposite shore was less grassy,\r\nand that it sloped down to the water, forming a muddy beach partially\r\nsubmerged.\r\n\r\nBut what riveted his attention were several deep imprints in the mud.\r\n\r\nHe could not be certain, of course, at that distance, but he was sure\r\nenough that he had recognized them to cause him to leap to his feet,\r\nforgetful of his thirst, and plunge through the stream for a closer\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nAs he bent to examine the spoor at close range he could scarce repress\r\na cry of exultation--they had been made by the hands and knees of\r\nNadara as she had stooped to drink at the very spot not twenty-four\r\nhours before.\r\n\r\nShe must have circled back toward the brook for some reason; but by\r\nfar the greatest cause for rejoicing was the fact that Nadara's trail\r\nalone was there. Flatfoot had not yet come upon her, and Waldo now was\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge that he might yet be in time, and that he was gaining\r\nsufficiently in strength to make it reasonably certain that he could\r\noverhaul the girl eventually, filled Waldo with renewed vigor. He\r\nhastened along Nadara's trail now with something of the energy that had\r\nbeen his directly before his battle with Korth.\r\n\r\nHis wounds had ceased bleeding, and for several days he had eaten well,\r\nand by night slept soundly, for he had reasoned that only by conserving\r\nhis energy and fortifying himself in every way possible could he succor\r\nthe girl.\r\n\r\nThat night he slept in a little thicket which had evidently harbored\r\nNadara the night before.\r\n\r\nThe following day the way lay across a rolling country, cut by numerous\r\ndeep ravines and lofty divides. That the pace was telling on the girl\r\nWaldo could read in the telltale spoor that revealed her lagging\r\nfootsteps. Upon each eminence the man halted to strain his eyes ahead\r\nfor a sight of her.\r\n\r\nAbout noon he discerned far ahead a shimmering line which he knew must\r\nbe the sea. Surely his long pursuit must end there.\r\n\r\nAs he was about to plunge on again along Nadara's trail something drew\r\nhis eyes toward the rear, and there upon another hill-top a mile or two\r\nbehind he saw the stocky figure of a half-naked man--it was Flatfoot.\r\n\r\nThe cave man must have seen Waldo at the same instant, for, with a\r\nmenacing wave of his huge fist, he increased his gait to a run, an\r\ninstant later disappearing into the ravine which lay at the bottom of\r\nthe hill upon which he had come into view.\r\n\r\nWaldo was undecided whether to wait for the encounter where he was or\r\nhasten on in an effort to overtake Nadara, that she might not escape\r\nhim entirely. He knew that he stood a good chance of being killed in\r\nthe conflict, and he also knew that were he victorious it might easily\r\nbe at such a terrible price that he would be physically incapable of\r\ncontinuing his search for the girl for many days.\r\n\r\nAs he meditated his eyes wandered back and forth across the landscape\r\nbefore him searching for Nadara.\r\n\r\nTo his right lay, at a little distance, a level plain which stretched\r\nto the foot of low-lying cliffs at the valley's southern rim, some\r\nthree or four miles distant. In this direction his view was almost\r\nunobstructed, but it was not in the direction of the girl's flight, so\r\nthat it was but by accident that Waldo's eyes swept casually across\r\nthe peaceful scene which would, at another time, have chained his\r\nattention with its quiet and alluring beauty.\r\n\r\nIt was as he swept a backward glance in the direction of Flatfoot\r\nthat his eye was arrested by the hint of something far out across the\r\nvalley, a little behind his own position.\r\n\r\nTo the Waldo of a few months previous it would not have been visible,\r\nbut the new woodcraft of the man scented the abnormal in the vague\r\nsuggestion of movement out among the long-waving grasses of the plain.\r\n\r\nAnd now, with every sense alert and riveted upon the spot, he was quick\r\nto perceive that it was an animal moving slowly toward the cliffs at\r\nthe upper end of the valley. Presently a little rise of ground, less\r\nthickly grassed, brought the creature into full view for an instant;\r\nbut in that instant Waldo saw that the thing he watched was a woman.\r\n\r\nAs he turned to hurry after her he saw Flatfoot top another hill a half\r\nmile nearer than he had before been, and as the cave man came into view\r\nhe turned his eyes in the direction that Waldo had been looking. A\r\nsecond later and he had abandoned the pursuit of Waldo and was running\r\nrapidly toward the woman.\r\n\r\nNadara had apparently circled back once more, this time from the sea,\r\nand coming up the valley had passed Waldo and come opposite Flatfoot\r\nbefore either of them had discovered her. The young man gave a little\r\ncry of alarm as he realized that the cave man was nearer to the girl\r\nthan he--by a good half mile, he judged, and so he put every ounce of\r\nhis speed into the wild dash he made down the hill into a gully which\r\nled out upon the valley.\r\n\r\nOn and on he raced unable to see either Flatfoot or Nadara; hoping,\r\never hoping, that he would be the first to win to her side; for Nadara\r\nhad told him of the atrocities that such a creature as Flatfoot might\r\nperpetrate upon a woman rather than permit her to escape him or fall\r\ninto the hands of another.\r\n\r\nNadara, being up wind, caught neither the scent nor noise of the two\r\nwho were racing madly toward her. The first knowledge she had that\r\nshe was not alone in the valley was the sight of Flatfoot as he broke\r\nsuddenly through a clump of tall grass not fifty paces from her.\r\n\r\nShe gave a little scream and started to run; but she was very tired\r\nfrom the days of unremitting flight which had so sorely taxed her\r\nendurance, and thus it was no wonder that she slipped and fell before\r\nshe had taken a dozen steps.\r\n\r\nScarcely had she gained her feet when Flatfoot was upon her, one hand\r\ngrasping her by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me in peace or I will kill you!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Kill me, then,\" retorted the despairing girl, \"for I shall never come\r\nwith you; first will I kill myself.\"\r\n\r\nFlatfoot did not wish to kill her, nor did he wish her to escape, as\r\nshe would be very likely to do should he be interrupted by the fellow\r\nwho must even now be quite close to them.\r\n\r\nPossibly if he could keep the girl quiet they might hide in the grass\r\nuntil their pursuer had gone by, and so Flatfoot, acting upon the idea,\r\nclapped a rough hand over Nadara's mouth and dragged her back along the\r\ntrail he had just made.\r\n\r\nThe girl struggled--striking and clawing at the hairy brute that pulled\r\nher along at his side--but she was as helpless in his clutches as if\r\nshe had been a day-old babe.\r\n\r\nShe did not know that help was so close at hand, or she would have\r\nfound the means to free her mouth and cry out once at least. As it was,\r\nshe wondered that Flatfoot should attempt to silence her in this way if\r\nthere were none to hear her screams.\r\n\r\nFor days she had known that the cave man was on her trail, for once in\r\ndoubling back upon herself she had passed but a short distance from a\r\nridge she had traversed the preceding day, and had seen the man's squat\r\nfigure and recognized his awkward, shuffling trot.\r\n\r\nIt was this knowledge that had turned her away from the old village\r\ntoward which she had been traveling since she lost Thandar's trail, and\r\nsent her in search of a new country in which she might lose herself\r\nfrom Flatfoot.\r\n\r\nAs the man dragged her roughly on through the grass Nadara racked her\r\nbrain for some means of escape, or a way to end her misery before the\r\nbeast could have his way with her. But there came no ray of hope to her\r\npoor, unhappy heart.\r\n\r\nIf Thandar were but there! He would save her, even if it were but to\r\ndesert her the next instant.\r\n\r\nBut did she wish to be saved again by him? Now that she pondered the\r\nidea she was quite sure that she would rather die than see him again,\r\nfor had he not twice run away from her?\r\n\r\nIn her misery she put this interpretation upon the remarkable\r\ndisappearance of Thandar after his battle with Korth--he had waited\r\nuntil she was out of sight and then he had risen and fled for fear she\r\nmight return and discover him. She wondered why he should dislike her\r\nso much.\r\n\r\nShe was quite sure that she had been very good to him, and had tried\r\nnot to annoy him while they were together. Maybe he looked down upon\r\nher, for surely he was of a superior race; of that she was quite\r\npositive.\r\n\r\nAnd so Nadara was very miserable and unhappy and hopeless as the\r\nbrutal Flatfoot dragged her far into the tall jungle-grass. Presently\r\nshe noticed that the cave man repeatedly cast glances toward the rear.\r\n\r\nWhat could he expect from that direction, or from any direction\r\nwhatever, so far as that was concerned? Were they not days and days\r\nfrom their own people, in a land where there seemed no men at all?\r\n\r\nFlatfoot heard no sign of pursuit. He was growing more confident. The\r\nstranger had lost their trail. The cave man moved less rapidly, and as\r\nhe went he looked now for a burrow into which he might crawl with the\r\nmaiden. Then there would be no further danger whatever.\r\n\r\nTomorrow Flatfoot would come out and find the fellow and kill him, but\r\nnow he had pleasanter work in view, nor did he wish to be disturbed.\r\n\r\nAnd at that very moment he caught a stealthy movement in the grasses a\r\nfew yards to his right. Waldo had come upon the spot at which Flatfoot\r\nhad overtaken Nadara but a few moments after the brute had dragged her\r\naway, and on the instant had sought a higher piece of ground from which\r\nhe could overlook the tall grass.\r\n\r\nNor had he been long in finding a spot that, coupled with his six feet\r\ntwo, brought his eyes above the level of the surrounding jungle.\r\n\r\nThere he watched for a little until he discerned a movement of the\r\ngrasstops at a little distance from him. After that it was but a matter\r\nof trailing.\r\n\r\nWhen Flatfoot saw what he took to be his enemy he threw Nadara across\r\nhis shoulder and started on a run in the opposite direction--at right\r\nangles to the way he had been going.\r\n\r\nThe ruse proved good, for when Waldo came to the point at which he had\r\nfigured his path would cross the cave man's he found no sign of the\r\nlatter, and in searching about to locate the trail lost many minutes of\r\nvaluable time. But at last he came upon that which he sought, and with\r\nredoubled speed set out at a rapid run through the tall grasses.\r\n\r\nHe had proceeded but a short distance when the trail broke suddenly\r\ninto the open, close by the base of the cliffs that he had seen from\r\nthe hill that had given him his fleeting glimpse of Nadara.\r\n\r\nAhead of him he saw the two he sought--Nadara across the burly\r\nshoulders of Flatfoot--and the cave man was making for the caves that\r\ndotted the face of the cliff. Were he to reach these he might defend\r\none of them against a single antagonist indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCAPTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost at the moment that Waldo emerged from the jungle Nadara saw him,\r\nand with a lunge threw herself from Flatfoot's shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe man turned with a fierce growl of rage, and his eyes fell upon the\r\ngiant rushing toward them.\r\n\r\nThe girl was now struggling madly to escape or delay her captor. There\r\ncould be but one outcome, as Flatfoot knew. He must fight now, but the\r\ngirl should never escape him.\r\n\r\nRaising the huge fist that had killed many a full-grown man with a\r\nsingle blow he aimed a wicked one at the side of Nadara's head.\r\n\r\nThe first one she dodged, and as the arm went up to strike again,\r\nThandar threw his spear-arm far back and with a mighty forward surge\r\ndrove his light weapon across the hundred feet that separated him from\r\nFlatfoot.\r\n\r\nIt was an awful risk--there was not a foot to spare between the hairy\r\nbreast that was his target and the beautiful head of the fair captive.\r\nShould either move between the time the spear left his hand and the\r\ninstant that it found its mark it might pierce the one it had been sped\r\nto save.\r\n\r\nFlatfoot's fist was crashing down toward that lovely face at the\r\ninstant that the spear found him; but he had moved--just enough to\r\nplace his arm before his breast--so that it was the falling arm that\r\nreceived the weapon instead of the heart that it had been intended for.\r\n\r\nBut it served its purpose. With a howl of pain and rage, Flatfoot,\r\nforgetful of the girl in the madness of his anger, dropped her and\r\nsprang toward Waldo.\r\n\r\nThe latter had drawn his sword--naught but a sharpened stick of hard\r\nwood--and stood waiting to receive his foe. It was his first attempt to\r\nput either sword or shield into practical use, and he was anxious to\r\ndiscover their value.\r\n\r\nAs Flatfoot came toward his antagonist he pulled the spear from the\r\nmuscles of his arm, and, stooping, gathered up one of the many rocks\r\nthat lay scattered about at the base of the cliff.\r\n\r\nThe cave man was roaring like a mad bull; hate and murder shot from his\r\nclose-set eyes; his upper lip curled back, showing his fighting fangs,\r\nand a light froth flecked his bristling beard.\r\n\r\nWaldo was sure there had never existed a more fearsome creature, and he\r\nmarveled that he was not afraid. The very thought of what the effect\r\nof this terrible monster's mad charge would have been upon him a short\r\nwhile ago brought a smile to his lips.\r\n\r\nAt sight of that taunting smile Flatfoot hurled the rock full at the\r\nmaddening face. With a quick movement of his left arm Waldo caught the\r\nmissile on his buckler, from whence it dropped harmlessly to the ground.\r\n\r\nFlatfoot did not throw again, and an instant later he was upon the\r\nBostonian--the pride and hope of the cultured and aristocratic Back Bay\r\nSmith-Joneses.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached for the agile, blond giant he found a thin sheet of\r\nhide-covered twigs in his way, and when he tried to tear down this\r\nbarrier the point of a sharpened stick was thrust into his abdomen.\r\n\r\nThis was no way to fight!\r\n\r\nFlatfoot was scandalized. He jumped back a few feet and glared at\r\nWaldo. Then he lowered his head and came at him once more with the very\r\nevident intention of rushing him off his feet by the very weight and\r\nimpetuosity of his charge.\r\n\r\nThis time the sharp stick slipped quickly over the top of the\r\nhide-covered atrocity and pierced Flatfoot's neck just where it joined\r\nhis thick skull.\r\n\r\nBurying a foot of its point beneath the muscles of the shoulder, it\r\nbrought a scream of pain and rage from the hairy beast.\r\n\r\nBefore Waldo could withdraw his weapon from the tough sinews, Flatfoot\r\nhad straightened up with a sudden jerk that snapped the sword short,\r\nleaving but a short stub in his antagonist's hand.\r\n\r\nNadara had been watching the battle breathlessly, ready to flee should\r\nit turn against her champion, yet at the same time searching for an\r\nopportunity to aid him.\r\n\r\nLike Flatfoot, the girl had never before seen spear or sword or shield\r\nin use, and while she marveled at the advantage which they gave\r\nThandar, she became dubious as to the result of the encounter when she\r\nsaw the sword broken, for the spear had been snapped into kindling-wood\r\nby Flatfoot when he tore it from his arm.\r\n\r\nBut Waldo still had his cudgel, fastened by a thong to his sword-belt,\r\nand as the cave man rushed upon him again he swung a mighty blow to the\r\nlow, brutal forehead.\r\n\r\nMomentarily stunned, the fellow reeled backward for a step, and again\r\nWaldo wielded his new weapon.\r\n\r\nFlatfoot trembled, his knees smote together, he staggered drunkenly,\r\nand then, when Waldo looked to see him go down, the brute power that\r\nwas in him, responding to nature's first law, sent him hurtling at the\r\nBostonian's throat in the snarling, blind rage of the death-smitten\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\nCatapulted by all the enormous strength of his mighty muscles, the\r\nsquat, bear-like animal bore Waldo to earth, and at the same instant\r\neach found the other's throat with sinewy, viselike fingers.\r\n\r\nThey lay very still now, choking with firm, relentless clutch. Every\r\nounce of muscle was needed, every grain of endurance.\r\n\r\nWaldo was suffering agonies after a moment of that awful death-grip. He\r\ncould feel his gasping, pain-racked lungs struggling for air.\r\n\r\nHe tried to wriggle free from those horrible fingers, but not once did\r\nhe loosen his own hold upon the throat of Flatfoot; instead he tried to\r\nclose a little tighter each second that he felt his own life ebbing. He\r\nbecame weaker and weaker. The pain was unendurable now.\r\n\r\nA haze obscured his vision--everything became black--his brain was\r\nwhizzing about at frightful velocity within the awful darkness of his\r\nskull.\r\n\r\nThe girl was bending close above them now, for both were struggling\r\nless violently. She had been minded to come to Thandar's rescue when\r\nsuddenly she recalled his desertion of her, and all the wild hatred of\r\nthe primitive mind surged through her.\r\n\r\nLet him die, she thought. He had spurned her, cast her off; he looked\r\ndown upon her.\r\n\r\nWell, let him take care of himself, then, and she turned deliberately\r\naway to leave the two men to decide the outcome of their own battle,\r\nand started back upon the trail in the direction of her tribe's\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nBut she had taken scarce a score of steps when something flamed up in\r\nher heart that withered the last remnant of her malice toward Thandar.\r\nAs she turned back again toward the combatants she attempted to justify\r\nthis new weakness by the thought that it was only fair that she should\r\ngive the yellow one aid in return for the aid that he had rendered her;\r\nthat done, she could go on her way with a clear conscience.\r\n\r\nShe wished never to see him again, but she could not have his blood\r\nupon her hands. At that thought she gave a little cry and ran to where\r\nthe men lay.\r\n\r\nBoth were almost quiet now; their struggles had nearly ceased. Just\r\nas she reached them Flatfoot relaxed, his hands slipped from Waldo's\r\nthroat and he lay entirely motionless.\r\n\r\nThen the fair giant struggled convulsively once or twice; he gasped,\r\nhis eyes rolled up and set, and with a sudden twitching of his muscles\r\nhe stiffened rigidly and was very still.\r\n\r\nNadara gave one horrified look at the ghastly face of her champion, and\r\nfled into the jungle.\r\n\r\nShe stumbled on for a quarter of a mile as fast as her tired limbs\r\nwould carry her through the entangling grasses, and then she came to\r\nthat which she sought--a little stream, winding slowly through the\r\nvalley down toward the ocean.\r\n\r\nDropping to her knees beside it she filled her mouth with the\r\nrefreshing water. In an instant she was up again and off in the\r\ndirection from which she had just come.\r\n\r\nThrowing herself at Waldo's side, she wet his face with the water from\r\nher mouth. She chafed his hands, shook him, blew upon his face when\r\nthe water was exhausted, and then, tears streaming from her eyes, she\r\nthrew herself upon him, covering his face with kisses, and moaning\r\ninarticulate words of love and endearment that were half stifled by\r\nanguished sobs of grief.\r\n\r\nSuddenly her lamentations ceased as quickly as they had begun. She\r\nraised her head from where it had been buried beside the man's and\r\nlooked intently into his face.\r\n\r\nThen she placed her ear upon his breast; with a delighted cry she\r\nresumed chafing his hands, for she had heard the beating of his heart.\r\n\r\nPresently Waldo gasped, and for a moment suffered the agonies of\r\nreturning respiration. When he opened his eyes in consciousness he saw\r\nNadara bending over him--a severely disinterested expression upon her\r\nbeautiful face. He turned his head to one side; there lay Flatfoot\r\nquite dead.\r\n\r\nIt was several moments before he could speak. Then he rose, very\r\nunsteadily, to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Nadara,\" he said, \"Korth lies dead beside the three great trees in the\r\nglade that is near the village that was Flatfoot's. Here is the dead\r\nbody of Flatfoot, and about my loins hangs the pelt of Nagoola, taken\r\nin fair fight.\r\n\r\n\"I have done all that you desired of me; I have tried to repay you for\r\nyour kindness to me when I was a stranger in your land. I do not know\r\nwhy you should have tried to kill me while I battled with Korth.\r\n\r\n\"No more do I know why you have allowed me to live today when it would\r\nhave been so easy to have despatched me as I lay unconscious here\r\nbeside Flatfoot.\r\n\r\n\"I read dislike upon your face, and I am sorry, for I would have parted\r\nwith you in friendship, so that when the time comes that I return to\r\nmy own land I should be able to carry away with me only the pleasant\r\nmemory of it. When we have rested and are refreshed I shall take you\r\nback to your father.\"\r\n\r\nAll that had been surging to the girl's lips of love and gratitude\r\nfrom a heart that was filled with both was congealed by the cold tone\r\nwhich marked this dispassionate recital of the discharge of a moral\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\nPossibly Waldo's tone was colored by the vivid memory of the look of\r\nhate that he had seen in the girl's eyes at the instant that he went\r\ndown before her missile as he battled with Korth, for it was not even\r\ntinged with friendliness.\r\n\r\nAnd so the girl's manner was equally distant when she replied; in fact,\r\nit was even colder, for it was fraught with bitterness.\r\n\r\n\"Thandar owed nothing to Nadara,\" she said, \"and though it matters not\r\nat all, it is only fair to say that the stone that struck you as you\r\nbattled in the glade was intended for Korth.\"\r\n\r\nWaldo's face brightened. A load that he had not realized lay there was\r\nlifted from his heart.\r\n\r\n\"You did not want to hurt me, then?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I want to hurt you?\" returned the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I thought\"--and here Waldo spoiled the fair start they had made at a\r\nreconciliation--\"I thought,\" he said, \"that you were angry because I\r\nran away from you after we had come to your village that time, months\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\nNadara's head went high and she laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\"I angry? I was surprised that you did not come to the village, but\r\nafter an hour I had forgotten the matter--it was with difficulty that\r\nI recognized you when I next saw you, so utterly had the occurrence\r\ndeparted from my thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nWaldo wondered why he should feel such humiliation at this frank\r\navowal. Of what moment to him was this girl's estimation of him? Why\r\ndid he feel a flush suffuse his face at the knowledge that he was of so\r\nlittle moment to her that she had entirely forgotten him within a few\r\nmonths?\r\n\r\nWaldo was mortified and angry. He changed the subject brusquely;\r\nhereafter he should eschew personalities.\r\n\r\n\"Let us find a cave at a distance from the dead man,\" he said, \"and\r\nthere we may rest until you are ready to attempt the return journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready now,\" replied Nadara; \"nor do I need or desire your\r\ncompany. I can return alone, as I came.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" remonstrated Waldo doggedly; \"I shall go with you whether you\r\nwish it or not. I shall see you safely with your father. I promised\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nNadara had been delighted with the first clause of his reply, but when\r\nit became evident that his only desire to return with her was to fulfil\r\na promise made her father she became furious, though she was careful\r\nnot to let him see it.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" she replied; \"you may come if you wish, though it is\r\nneither necessary nor as I would have it. I prefer being alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not force my company upon you,\" said Waldo haughtily. \"I can\r\nfollow a few paces behind you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an injured air in his last words which did not escape the\r\ngirl. She wondered if he really deserved the harsh attitude she had\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThey found a cave a half-mile down the valley, where they took up their\r\nquarters against the time that Waldo should be rested, for the girl\r\ninsisted that she was fully able to commence the return journey at once.\r\n\r\nThe man knew better, and so he let her have it that the delay was on\r\nhis account rather than hers, for he doubted her ability to cope with\r\nthe hardships of the long journey without an interval for recuperation.\r\n\r\nThe next morning found them both rested and in better spirits, so that\r\nthere was no return to their acrimonious encounter of the previous day.\r\n\r\nAs they walked out toward the forest that lay down the valley in the\r\ndirection of the ocean Waldo dropped a few paces behind the girl in\r\npolite deference to her expressed wish of the day before.\r\n\r\nAs he walked he watched the graceful movements of her lithe figure and\r\nthe lines of her clear-cut profile as she turned her head this way and\r\nthat in search of food.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful she was! It was incredible that this wild cave girl\r\nshould have greater beauty and a more regal carriage than the queens\r\nand beauties of civilization, and yet Waldo was forced to admit that\r\nhe had never even dreamed, much less seen, such absolute physical\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nHe wished that he could say as much for her disposition; that was\r\natrocious. It was unbelievable that such a wondrous exterior could\r\nharbor so much ingratitude and coldness.\r\n\r\nPresently they came among the trees where the ripe fruit hung, and as\r\nWaldo climbed nimbly among the branches and tossed the most luscious\r\ndown to her, the girl, in her turn, watched him.\r\n\r\nShe noted more closely the marvelous change that a few months had\r\nwrought. She had thought him wonderful before, but now he was a very\r\ngod. She did not think just this, for she knew nothing of gods--other\r\nthan the demons that were supposed to enter the bodies of the sick; but\r\nshe thought of him as some superior creature, and then she ceased to\r\nfeel aggrieved that he should care so little for her.\r\n\r\nHe was not a man--he was something more than a man, and she had been\r\nvery wicked to have treated him so shamefully. She would make amends.\r\n\r\nSo she tried to be more kind thereafter, though there still remained a\r\ntrace of aloofness.\r\n\r\nTogether they sat upon the turf and ate their fruit, and as they ate\r\nthey talked a little, for it is difficult for two young people to\r\nharbor animosity for a great time, especially when there is none other\r\nfor them to talk to.\r\n\r\n\"When you have returned with me to my father, Thandar,\" the girl asked,\r\n\"where shall you go then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall return to the sea where I may watch for a ship to take me back\r\nto my own land,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen but one ship in all my life,\" said Nadara, \"and that was\r\nyears ago. It was when we lived close by the big water that it stopped\r\na long way from shore and sent many smaller boats to land.\r\n\r\n\"There were many men in the boats, and when they landed, my father and\r\nmother took me far into the forest away from the sea, and there we\r\nstayed for many days until the strangers had sailed. They wandered up\r\nand down the coast and came back into the forests and the jungles for a\r\nfew miles.\r\n\r\n\"My mother said that they were searching for me, and that if they found\r\nme they would take me away. I was very much frightened.\"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of her mother Waldo recalled the little parcel that\r\nNadara's father had given into his custody for the girl. He unfastened\r\nit from the thong that circled his waist, where it had hung beneath his\r\npanther-skin garment.\r\n\r\n\"Here is something your father asked me to bring you,\" he said,\r\nhanding the package to Nadara.\r\n\r\nThe girl took it and examined it as though it was entirely unfamiliar.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Your father did not say, other than that it contained articles that\r\nyour mother wore when she died,\" he said tenderly, for a great pity had\r\nwelled up in his heart for this poor, motherless girl.\r\n\r\n\"That my mother wore!\" Nadara repeated, her brows contracted in a\r\npuzzled frown. \"When my mother died she wore nothing but a single\r\ngarment of many small skins--very old and worn--and that was buried\r\nwith her. I do not understand.\"\r\n\r\nShe made no effort to open the package, but sat gazing far off toward\r\nthe ocean which was just visible through the trees, entirely absorbed\r\nin the reverie which Waldo's words had engendered.\r\n\r\n\"Could the thing that the old woman told me have been true?\" the girl\r\nmused half aloud. \"Could it have been because it was true that my\r\nmother fell upon her with tooth and nail until she had nearly killed\r\nher? I wonder if----\"\r\n\r\nBut here she stopped, her eyes riveted in sudden fear and hopelessness\r\nupon a thing that she had just espied in the distance.\r\n\r\nA great lump rose in her throat, tears came to her eyes, and with them\r\nthe full measure of realization of what that thing beyond the forest\r\nmeant to her.\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes toward the man. He was sitting with bowed head,\r\nplaying idly with a large beetle that he had penned within a tiny\r\npalisade of small twigs.\r\n\r\nAt length he made an opening in the barrier.\r\n\r\n\"Go your way, poor thing,\" he murmured. \"Heaven knows I realize too\r\nwell the horrors of captivity to keep any other creature from its\r\nfellows and its home.\"\r\n\r\nA choking sigh that was almost a sob racked the girl. At the sound\r\nWaldo looked up to see her pathetic, unhappy eyes upon him. Of a sudden\r\nthere enveloped him a great desire to take her in his arms and comfort\r\nher. He knew not why she was unhappy, but her sorrow cried aloud to\r\nhim--as he thought simply to the protective instinct that was merely an\r\nattribute of his sex.\r\n\r\nNadara raised her hand slowly and pointed through the trees. It was as\r\nthough she had torn her heart from her breast, so harrowing she felt\r\nthe consequences of her act would be, but it was for his sake--for the\r\nsake of the man she loved.\r\n\r\nAs Waldo's eyes followed the direction of her pointing finger he came\r\nsuddenly to his feet with a wild cry of joy; through the trees, out\r\nupon the shimmering surface of the placid sea, there lay a graceful,\r\nwhite yacht.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" cried the man fervently, and sinking to his knees he\r\nraised his hands aloft toward the author of joy and sorrow.\r\n\r\nA moment later he sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Home! Nadara. Home!\" he cried. \"Can't you realize it? I am going home.\r\nI am saved! Oh, Nadara, child, can't you realize what it means to me?\r\nHome! Home! Home!\"\r\n\r\nHe had been looking toward the yacht as he spoke, but now he turned\r\ntoward the girl. She was crouching upon the ground, her face in her\r\nhands, her slender figure shaken by convulsive tears.\r\n\r\nHe came toward her and, kneeling, laid his hand upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Nadara!\" he said gently. \"Why do you cry, child? What is the matter?\"\r\nBut she only shook her head, moaning.\r\n\r\nHe raised her to her feet, and as he supported her his arm circled her\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Nadara, why you are unhappy?\" he urged.\r\n\r\nBut still she could not speak for sobbing, and only buried her face\r\nupon his breast.\r\n\r\nHe was holding her very close now, and with the pressure of her body\r\nagainst his a fire that, unknown, had been smoldering in his heart\r\nfor months burst into sudden flame, and in the heat of it there were\r\nconsumed the mists that had been before the eyes of his heart all that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Nadara,\" he asked in a very low voice, \"is it because I am going that\r\nyou cry?\"\r\n\r\nBut at that she pulled away from him, and through her tears her eyes\r\nblazed.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" she cried. \"I shall be glad when you have gone. I wish that\r\nyou had never come. I--I--hate you!\" She turned and fled back up the\r\nvalley, forgetful of the little packet Thandar had brought her, which\r\nlay forgotten upon the ground where she had dropped it.\r\n\r\nWithout so much as a backward glance toward the yacht Waldo was off in\r\npursuit of her; but Nadara was as fleet as a hare, so that it was a\r\nmuch winded Waldo who finally overhauled her half-way up the face of a\r\ncliff two miles from the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"Go away!\" cried the girl. \"Go back with your own kind, to your own\r\nhome!\"\r\n\r\nWaldo did not answer.\r\n\r\nWaldo was no more.\r\n\r\nIt was Thandar, the cave man, who took Nadara in his strong arms and\r\ncrushed her to him.\r\n\r\n\"My girl!\" he cried. \"My girl! I love you! And because I am a fool I\r\ndid not learn until it was almost too late.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not ask if she loved him, for he was Thandar, the cave man. Nor,\r\na moment later, did he need to ask, since her strong, brown arms crept\r\nup about his neck and drew his lips down to hers.\r\n\r\nIt was quite half an hour later before either thought of the yacht\r\nagain. From where they stood upon the cliff's face they could see the\r\nocean and the beach.\r\n\r\nSeveral boats were drawn up and a number of men were coming toward the\r\nforest. Presently they would discover the two upon the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"We shall go back together now,\" said Thandar.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" replied Nadara.\r\n\r\nFor a time the man stood gazing at the dainty yacht, and far beyond\r\nit into the civilization which it represented, and he saw there suave\r\nmen and sneering women, and among them was a slender brown beauty who\r\nshrank from the cruel glances of the women--and Waldo writhed at this\r\nand at the greedy eyes of the suave men as they appraised the girl--and\r\nhe, too, was afraid.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" he said, taking Nadara by the hand, \"let us hurry back into the\r\nhills before they discover us.\"\r\n\r\nJust as the men from the yacht, which Mr. John Alden Smith-Jones had\r\ndespatched to the South Seas in search of his missing son, emerged from\r\nthe forest into a view of the valley and the cliffs a cave man and his\r\nmate clambered over the brow of the latter and disappeared toward the\r\nhills beyond.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dusk as the searchers from the yacht were returning\r\ntoward the beach.\r\n\r\nThey had found no sign of human habitation in the little valley, nor\r\nanywhere along the coast that they had so carefully explored.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the expedition, Captain Cecil Burlinghame, a retired\r\nnaval officer, was in advance.\r\n\r\nThey had penetrated the woods nearly to the beach when his foot struck\r\nagainst a package wrapped in the skin of a small rodent.\r\n\r\nHe stooped and picked it up.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the first evidence that another human being than ourselves has\r\never set foot upon this island,\" he said as he cut the gut lacing with\r\nhis pocket knife.\r\n\r\nWithin the first wrapping he found a chamois-bag such as women\r\nsometimes use to carry jewels about their persons.\r\n\r\nFrom this he emptied into his palm a dozen priceless rings, a few\r\nold-fashioned brooches, bracelets, and lockets.\r\n\r\nIn one of the latter he discovered the ivory miniature of a woman--a\r\nvery beautiful woman.\r\n\r\nIn the other side of the locket was engraved: \"To Eugénie Marie Céleste\r\nde la Valois, Countess of Crecy, from Henri, her husband. 17th January,\r\n18--\"\r\n\r\n\"Gad!\" cried the old captain. \"Now what do you make of that?\r\n\r\n\"The Count and Countess of Crecy were returning to Paris from their\r\nhoneymoon trip round the world in the steam yacht _Dolphin_ nearly\r\ntwenty years ago, and after they touched at Australia were never heard\r\nof again.\r\n\r\n\"What tragedy, what mystery, what romance might not these sparkling\r\ngems disclose had they but tongues!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAVE GIRL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: _Part II of this book appeared serially under the title_ \"The\r\nCave Man\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nKING BIG FIST\r\n\r\n\r\nWaldo Emerson Smith-Jones, scion of the aristocratic house of the John\r\nAlden Smith-Joneses of Boston, clambered up the rocky face of the\r\nprecipitous cliff with the agility of a monkey.\r\n\r\nHis right hand clasped the slim brown fingers of his half-naked mate,\r\nassisting her over the more dangerous or difficult stretches.\r\n\r\nAt the summit the two turned their faces back toward the sea. Beyond\r\nthe gently waving forest trees stretched the broad expanse of\r\nshimmering ocean. In the foreground, upon the bosom of a tiny harbor,\r\nlay a graceful yacht--a beautiful toy it looked from the distance of\r\nthe cliff top.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the man obtained an unobstructed view of the craft.\r\nBefore, when they first had discovered it, the boles of the forest\r\ntrees had revealed it but in part.\r\n\r\nNow he saw it fully from stem to stern with all its well-known,\r\ngraceful lines standing out distinctly against the deep blue of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe shock of recognition brought an involuntary exclamation from his\r\nlips. The girl looked quickly up into his face.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Thandar?\" she asked. \"What do you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"The yacht!\" he whispered. \"It is the _Priscilla_--my father's. He is\r\nsearching for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you wish to go?\"\r\n\r\nFor some time he did not speak--only stood there gazing at the distant\r\nyacht. And the young girl at his side remained quite motionless and\r\nsilent, too, looking up at the man's profile, watching the expression\r\nupon his face with a look of dumb misery upon her own.\r\n\r\nQuickly through the man's mind was running the gamut of his past. He\r\nrecalled his careful and tender upbringing--the time, the money, the\r\nfond pride that had been expended upon his education. He thought of the\r\nresult--the narrow-minded, weakling egoist; the pusillanimous coward\r\nthat had been washed from the deck of a passing steamer upon the sandy\r\nbeach of this savage, forgotten shore.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it had been love, solicitous and tender, that had prompted his\r\nparents to their misguided efforts. He was their only son. They were\r\ndoubtless grieving for him. They were no longer young, and in their\r\ndeclining years it appeared to him a pathetic thing that they should be\r\nrobbed of the happiness which he might bring them by returning to the\r\nold life.\r\n\r\nBut could he ever return to the bookish existence that once had seemed\r\nso pleasant?\r\n\r\nHad not this brief year into which had been crowded so much of wild,\r\nprimitive life made impossible a return to the narrow, self-centered\r\nexistence? Had it not taught him that there was infinitely more in life\r\nthan ever had been written into the dry and musty pages of books?\r\n\r\nIt had taught him to want life at first hand--not through the proxy of\r\nthe printed page. It and--Nadara. He glanced toward the girl.\r\n\r\nCould he give her up? No! A thousand times, no!\r\n\r\nHe read in her face the fear that lurked in her heart. No, he could\r\nnot give her up. He owed to her all that he possessed of which he was\r\nmost proud--his mighty physique, his new found courage, his woodcraft,\r\nhis ability to cope, primitively, with the primitive world, her savage\r\nworld which he had learned to love.\r\n\r\nNo, he could not give her up; but--what? His gaze lingered upon her\r\nsweet face. Slowly there sank into his understanding something of the\r\nreason for his love of this wild, half-savage cave girl other than the\r\nprimitive passion of the sexes.\r\n\r\nHe saw now not only the physical beauty of her face and figure, but\r\nthe sweet, pure innocence of her girlishness, and, most of all, the\r\nwondrous tenderness of her love of him that was mirrored in her eyes.\r\n\r\nTo remain and take her as his mate after the manner and customs of her\r\nown people would reflect no shame upon himself or her; but was she not\r\ndeserving of the highest honor that it lay within his power to offer at\r\nthe altar of her love?\r\n\r\nShe--his wonderful Nadara--must become his through the most solemn and\r\ndignified ceremony that civilized man had devised. What the young woman\r\nof his past life demanded was none too good for her.\r\n\r\nAgain the girl voiced her question.\r\n\r\n\"You wish to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Nadara,\" he replied, \"I must go back to my own people--and you\r\nmust go with me.\"\r\n\r\nHer face lighted with pleasure and happiness as she heard his last\r\nwords; but the expression was quickly followed by one of doubt and fear.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" she said; \"but if you wish it I will go.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not fear, Nadara. None will harm you by word or deed while\r\nThandar is with you. Come, let us return to the sea and the yacht\r\nbefore she sails.\"\r\n\r\nHand in hand they retraced their steps down the steep cliff, across the\r\nlittle valley toward the forest and the sea.\r\n\r\nNadara walked very close to Thandar, her hand snuggled in his and her\r\nshoulder pressed tightly against his side, for she was afraid of the\r\nnew life among the strange creatures of civilization.\r\n\r\nAt the far side of the valley, just before one enters the forest,\r\nthere grows a thick jungle of bamboo--really but a narrow strip, not\r\nmore than a hundred feet through at its greatest width; but so dense\r\nas to quite shut out from view any creature even a few feet within its\r\nnarrow, gloomy avenues.\r\n\r\nInto this the two plunged, Thandar in the lead, Nadara close behind\r\nhim, stepping exactly in his footprints--an involuntary concession to\r\ntraining, for there was no need here either of deceiving a pursuer,\r\nor taking advantage of easier going. The trail was well-marked and\r\nsmooth-beaten by many a padded paw.\r\n\r\nIt wound erratically, following the line of least resistance--it\r\nforked, and there were other trails which entered it from time to time,\r\nor crossed it. The hundred feet it traversed seemed much more when\r\nmeasured by the trail.\r\n\r\nThe two had come almost to the forest side of the jungle when a sharp\r\nturn in the path brought Thandar face to face with a huge, bear-like\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe fellow wore a g-string of soft hide, and over one shoulder dangled\r\nan old and filthy leopard skin--otherwise, he was naked. His thick,\r\ncoarse hair was matted low over his forehead. The balance of his face\r\nwas covered by a bushy red beard.\r\n\r\nAt sight of Thandar his close set, little eyes burned with sudden\r\nrage and cunning. From his thick lips burst a savage yell--it was the\r\npreliminary challenge.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily a certain amount of vituperation and coarse insults must\r\npass between strangers meeting upon this inhospitable isle before they\r\nfly at one another's throat.\r\n\r\n\"I am Thurg,\" bellowed the brute. \"I can kill you,\" and then followed a\r\nvolley of vulgar allusions to Thandar's possible origin, and the origin\r\nof his ancestors.\r\n\r\n\"The bad men,\" whispered Nadara.\r\n\r\nWith her words there swept into the man's memory the scene upon the\r\nface of the cliff that night a year before when, even in the throes of\r\ncowardly terror, he had turned to do battle with a huge cave man that\r\nthe fellow might not prevent the escape of Nadara.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the right forearm of the creature who faced him. A smile\r\ntouched Thandar's lips--the arm was crooked as from the knitting of a\r\nbroken bone, poorly set.\r\n\r\n\"You would kill Thandar--again?\" he asked tauntingly, pointing toward\r\nthe deformed member.\r\n\r\nThen came recognition to the red-rimmed eyes of Thurg, as, with\r\nanother ferocious bellow, he launched himself toward the author of his\r\nold hurt.\r\n\r\nThandar met the charge with his short stick of pointed hard wood--his\r\n\"sword\" he called it. It entered the fleshy part of Thurg's breast,\r\ncalling forth a howl of pain and a trickling stream of crimson.\r\n\r\nThurg retreated. This was no way to fight. He was scandalized.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes he stood glaring at his foe, screaming hideous\r\nthreats and insults at him. Then once more he charged.\r\n\r\nAgain the painful point entered his body, but this time he pressed in\r\nclutching madly at the goad and for a hold upon Thandar's body.\r\n\r\nThe latter held Thurg at arm's length, prodding him with the\r\nfire-hardened point of his wooden sword.\r\n\r\nThe cave man's little brain wondered at the skill and prowess of this\r\nstranger who had struck him a single blow with a cudgel many moons\r\nbefore and then run like a rabbit to escape his wrath.\r\n\r\nWhy was it that he did not run now? What strange change had taken place\r\nin him? He had expected an easy victim when he finally had recognized\r\nhis foe; but instead he had met with brawn and ferocity equal to his\r\nown and with a strange weapon, the like of which he never before had\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThandar was puncturing him rapidly now, and Thurg was screaming in rage\r\nand suffering. Presently he could endure it no longer. With a sudden\r\nwrench he tore himself loose and ran, bellowing, through the jungle.\r\n\r\nThandar did not pursue. It was enough that he had rid himself of his\r\nenemy. He turned toward Nadara, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"It will seem very tame in Boston,\" he said; but though she gave him\r\nan answering smile, she did not understand, for to her Boston was but\r\nanother land of primeval forests, and dense jungles; of hairy, battling\r\nmen, and fierce beasts.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the forest they came again upon Thurg, but this time he\r\nwas surrounded by a score of his burly tribesmen. Thandar knew better\r\nthan to pit himself against so many.\r\n\r\nThurg came rushing down upon them, his fellows at his heels. In loud\r\ntones he screamed anew his challenge, and the beasts behind him took it\r\nup until the forest echoed to their hideous bellowing.\r\n\r\nHe had seen Nadara as he had battled with Thandar, and recognized her\r\nas the girl he had desired a year before--the girl whom this stranger\r\nhad robbed him of.\r\n\r\nNow he was determined to wreak vengeance on the man and at the same\r\ntime recapture the girl.\r\n\r\nThandar and Nadara turned back into the jungle where but a single enemy\r\ncould attack them at a time in the narrow trails. Here they managed to\r\nelude pursuit for several hours, coming again into the forest nearly a\r\nmile below the beach where the _Priscilla_ had lain at anchor.\r\n\r\nThurg and his fellows had apparently given up the chase--they had\r\nneither seen nor heard aught of them for some time. Now the two\r\nhastened back through the wood to reach a point on the shore opposite\r\nthe yacht.\r\n\r\nAt last they came in sight of the harbor. Thandar halted. A look of\r\nhorror and disappointment supplanted the expression of pleasurable\r\nanticipation that had lighted his countenance--the yacht was not there.\r\n\r\nA mile out they discerned her, steaming rapidly north.\r\n\r\nThandar ran to the beach. He tore the black panther's hide from his\r\nshoulders, waving it frantically above his head, the while he shouted\r\nin futile endeavor to attract attention from the dwindling craft.\r\n\r\nThen, quite suddenly, he collapsed upon the beach, burying his face in\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nPresently Nadara crept close to his side. Her soft arms encircled his\r\nshoulders as she drew his cheek close to hers in an attempt to comfort\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Is it so terrible,\" she asked, \"to be left here alone with your\r\nNadara?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not that,\" he answered. \"If you were mine I should not care so\r\nmuch, but you cannot be mine until we have reached civilization and\r\nyou have been made mine in accordance with the laws and customs of\r\ncivilized men. And now who knows when another ship may come--if ever\r\nanother will come?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am yours, Thandar,\" insisted the girl. \"You are my man--you\r\nhave told me that you love me, and I have replied that I would be your\r\nmate--who can give us to each other better than we can give ourselves?\"\r\n\r\nHe tried, as best he could, to explain to her the marriage customs and\r\nceremonies of his own world, but she found it difficult to understand\r\nhow it might be that a stranger whom neither might possibly ever have\r\nseen before could make it right for her to love her Thandar, or that it\r\nshould be wrong for her to love him without the stranger's permission.\r\n\r\nTo Thandar the future looked most black and hopeless. With his sudden\r\ndetermination to take Nadara back to his own people he had been\r\noverwhelmed with a mad yearning for home.\r\n\r\nHe realized that his past apathy to the idea of returning to Boston had\r\nbeen due solely to recollection of Boston as he had known it--Boston\r\nwithout Nadara; but now that she was to have gone back with him Boston\r\nseemed the most desirable spot in the world.\r\n\r\nAs he sat pondering the unfortunate happenings that had so delayed them\r\nthat the yacht had sailed before they reached the shore, he also cast\r\nabout for some plan to mitigate their disappointment.\r\n\r\nTo live forever upon this savage island did not seem such an appalling\r\nthing as it had a year before--but then he had not realized his love\r\nfor the wild young creature at his side. Ah, if she could but be made\r\nhis wife then his exile here would be a happy rather than a doleful lot.\r\n\r\nWhat if he had been born here too? With the thought came a new idea\r\nthat seemed to offer an avenue from his dilemma. Had he, too, been\r\nnative born how would he have wed Nadara?\r\n\r\nWhy through the ceremony of their own people, of course. And if men and\r\nwomen were thus wed here, living together in faithfulness throughout\r\ntheir lives, what more sacred a union could civilization offer?\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Nadara!\" he cried. \"We shall return to your people, and there\r\nyou shall become my wife.\"\r\n\r\nNadara was puzzled, but she made no comment; content simply to leave\r\nthe future to her lord and master; to do whatever would bring Thandar\r\nthe greatest happiness.\r\n\r\nThe return to the dwellings of Nadara's people occupied three\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten days.\r\n\r\nHow different this journey by comparison with that of a year since,\r\nwhen the cave girl had been leading the terror-stricken Waldo Emerson\r\nin flight from the bad men toward, to him, an equally horrible fate at\r\nthe hands of Korth and Flatfoot!\r\n\r\nThen the forest glades echoed to the pads of fierce beasts and the\r\nstealthy passage of naked, human horrors. No twig snapped that did not\r\nportend instant and terrifying death.\r\n\r\nNow Korth and Flatfoot were dead at the hands of the metamorphosed\r\nWaldo. The racking cough was gone. He had encountered the bad men and\r\nothers like them and come away with honors. Even Nagoola, the sleek,\r\nblack devil-cat of the hideous nights, no longer sent the slightest\r\ntremor through the rehabilitated nerves.\r\n\r\nDid not Thandar wear Nagoola's pelt about his shoulder and loins--a\r\npelt that he had taken in hand to hand encounter with the dread beast?\r\n\r\nSlowly they walked beneath the shade of giant trees, beside pleasant\r\nstreams, or, again, across open valleys where the grass grew knee high\r\nand countless, perfumed wild flowers opened a pathway before their\r\nnaked feet.\r\n\r\nAt night they slept where night found them. Sometimes in the deserted\r\nlair of a wild beast, or again perched among the branches of a\r\nspreading tree where parallel branches permitted the construction of\r\nrude platforms.\r\n\r\nAnd Thandar was always most solicitous to see that Nadara's couch was\r\nof the softest grasses and that his own lay at a little distance from\r\nhers and in a position where he might best protect her from prowling\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nAgain was Nadara puzzled, but still she made no comment.\r\n\r\nFinally they came to her village.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the younger men came forth to meet them; but when they saw\r\nthat the man was he who had slain Korth they bridled their truculence,\r\nall but one, Big Fist, who had assumed the role of king since Flatfoot\r\nhad left.\r\n\r\n\"I can kill you,\" he announced by way of greeting, \"for I am Big Fist,\r\nand until Flatfoot returns I am king--and maybe afterward, for some day\r\nI shall kill Flatfoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to fight you,\" replied Thandar. \"Already have I killed\r\nKorth, and Flatfoot will return no more, for Flatfoot I have killed\r\nalso. And I can kill Big Fist, but what is the use? Why should we\r\nfight? Let us be friends, for we must live together, and if we do not\r\nkill one another there will be more of us to meet the bad men, should\r\nthey come, and kill them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Big Fist heard that Flatfoot was dead and by the hand of this\r\nstranger he pined less to measure his strength with that of the\r\nnewcomer. He saw the knothole that the other offered, and promptly he\r\nsought to crawl through it, but with honor.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"I shall not kill you--you need not be afraid.\r\nBut you must know that I am king, and do as I say that you shall do.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Afraid,'\" Thandar laughed. \"You may be king,\" he said, \"but as for\r\ndoing what you say--\" and again he laughed.\r\n\r\nIt was a very different Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones from the thing that\r\nthe sea had spewed up twelve months before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nKING THANDAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing that Thandar did after he entered the village was to\r\nseek out Nadara's father.\r\n\r\nThey found the old man in the poorest and least protected cave in the\r\ncliff side, exposed to the attack of the first prowling carnivore, or\r\nskulking foeman.\r\n\r\nHe was sick, and there was none to care for him; but he did not\r\ncomplain. That was the way of his people. When a man became too old\r\nto be of service to the community it were better that he died, and so\r\nthey did nothing to delay the inevitable. When one became an absolute\r\nburden upon his fellows it was customary to hasten the end--a carefully\r\ndelivered blow with a heavy rock was calculated quickly to relieve the\r\nburdens of the community and the suffering of the invalid.\r\n\r\nThandar and Nadara came in and sat down beside him. The old fellow\r\nseemed glad to see them.\r\n\r\n\"I am Thandar,\" said the young man. \"I wish to take your daughter as my\r\nmate.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man looked at him questioningly for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"You have killed Korth and Flatfoot--who is to prevent you from taking\r\nNadara?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to be joined to her with your permission and in accordance with\r\nthe marriage ceremonies of your people,\" said Thandar.\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand you,\" he replied at last. \"There are several fine\r\ncaves that are not occupied--if you wish a better one you have but to\r\nslay the present occupants if they do not get out when you tell them\r\nto--but I think they will get out when the slayer of Korth and Flatfoot\r\ntells them to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not worried about a cave,\" said Thandar. \"Tell me how men take\r\ntheir wives among you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they do not come with us willingly we take them by the hair and\r\ndrag them with us,\" replied Nadara's father. \"My mate would not come\r\nwith me,\" he continued, \"and even after I had caught her and dragged\r\nher to my cave she broke away and fled from me, but again I overhauled\r\nher, for when I was young none could run more swiftly, and this time I\r\ndid what I should have done at first--I beat her upon the head until\r\nshe went to sleep. When she awoke she was in my own cave, and it was\r\nnight, and she did not try to ran away any more.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time Thandar sat in thought. Presently he spoke addressing\r\nNadara.\r\n\r\n\"In my country we do not take our wives in any such way, nor shall I\r\ntake you thus. We must be married properly, according to the customs\r\nand laws of civilization.\"\r\n\r\nNadara made no reply. To her it seemed that Thandar must care very\r\nlittle for her--that was about the only explanation she could put upon\r\nhis strange behavior. It made her sad. And then the other women would\r\nlaugh at her--of that she was quite certain, and that, too, made her\r\nfeel very badly--they would see that Thandar did not want her.\r\n\r\nThe old man, lying upon his scant bed of matted, filthy grasses, had\r\nheard the conversation. He was as much at sea as Nadara. At last he\r\nspoke--very feebly now, for rapidly he was nearing dissolution.\r\n\r\n\"I am a very old man,\" he said to Thandar. \"I have not long to live.\r\nBefore I die I should like to know that Nadara has a mate who will\r\nprotect her. I love her, though--\" He hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Though what?\" asked Thandar.\r\n\r\n\"I have never told,\" whispered the old fellow. \"My mate would not let\r\nme, but now that I am about to die it can do no harm. Nadara is not my\r\ndaughter.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl sprang to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Not your daughter? Then who am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know who you are, except that you are not even of my people.\r\nAll that I know I will tell you now before I die. Come close, for my\r\nvoice is dying faster than my body.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man and the girl came nearer to his side, and squatting there\r\nleaned close that they might catch each faintly articulated syllable.\r\n\r\n\"My mate and I,\" commenced the old man, \"were childless, though many\r\nmoons had passed since I took her to my cave. She wanted a little one,\r\nfor thus only may women have aught upon which to lavish their love.\r\n\r\n\"We had been hunting together for several days alone and far from the\r\nvillage, for I was a great hunter when I was young--no greater ever\r\nlived among our people.\r\n\r\n\"And one day we came down to the great water, and there, a short\r\ndistance from the shore we saw a strange thing that floated upon the\r\nsurface of the water, and when it was blown closer to us we saw that\r\nit was hollow and that in it were two people--a man and a woman. Both\r\nappeared to be dead.\r\n\r\n\"Finally I waded out to meet the thing, dragging it to shore, and there\r\nsure enough was a man and a woman, and the man was dead--quite dead. He\r\nmust have been dead for a long time; but the woman was not dead.\r\n\r\n\"She was very fair though her eyes and hair were black. We carried her\r\nashore, and that night a little girl was born to her, but the woman\r\ndied before morning.\r\n\r\n\"We put her back into the strange thing that had brought her--she and\r\nthe dead man who had come with her--and shoved them off upon the great\r\nwater, where the breeze, which had changed over night, together with\r\nthe water which runs away from the land twice each day carried them out\r\nof sight, nor ever did we see them again.\r\n\r\n\"But before we sent them off my mate took from the body of the woman\r\nher strange coverings and a little bag of skin which contained many\r\nsparkling stones of different colors and metals of yellow and white\r\nmade into things the purposes of which we could not guess.\r\n\r\n\"It was evident that the woman had come from a strange land, for she\r\nand all her belongings were unlike anything that either of us ever had\r\nseen before. She herself was different as Nadara is different--Nadara\r\nlooks as her mother looked, for Nadara is the little babe that was born\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\n\"We brought her back to our people after another moon, saying that she\r\nwas born to my mate; but there was one woman who knew better, for it\r\nseemed that she had seen us when we found the boat, having been running\r\naway from a man who wanted her as his mate.\r\n\r\n\"But my mate did not want anyone to say that Nadara was not hers, for\r\nit is a great disgrace, as you well know, for a woman to be barren, and\r\nso she several times nearly killed this woman, who knew the truth, to\r\nkeep her from telling it to the whole village.\r\n\r\n\"But I love Nadara as well as though she had been my own, and so I\r\nshould like to see her well mated before I die.\"\r\n\r\nThandar had gone white during the narration of the story of Nadara's\r\nbirth. He could scarce restrain an impulse to go upon his knees and\r\nthank his God that he had harked to the call of his civilized training\r\nrather than have given in to the easier way, the way these primitive,\r\nbeast-like people offered. Providence, he thought, must indeed have\r\nsent him here to rescue her.\r\n\r\nThe old man, turning upon his rough pallet, fastened his sunken eyes\r\nquestioningly upon Thandar. Nadara, too, with parted lips waited for\r\nhim to speak. The old man gasped for breath--there was a strange\r\nrattling sound in his throat.\r\n\r\nThandar leaned above him, raising his head and shoulders slightly. The\r\nyoung man never had heard that sound before, but now that he heard it\r\nhe needed no interpreter.\r\n\r\nThe locust, rubbing his legs along his wings, startles the uninitiated\r\ninto the belief that a hidden rattler lurks in the pathway; but when\r\nthe great diamond back breaks forth in warning none mistakes him for a\r\nlocust.\r\n\r\nAnd so is it with the death rattle in the human throat.\r\n\r\nThandar knew that it was the end. He saw the old man's mighty effort to\r\npush back the grim reaper that he might speak once more. In the dying\r\neyes were a question and a plea. Thandar could not misunderstand.\r\n\r\nHe reached forward and took Nadara's hand.\r\n\r\n\"In my own land we shall be mated,\" he said. \"None other shall wed with\r\nNadara, and as proof that she is Thandar's she shall wear this always,\"\r\nand from his finger he slipped a splendid solitaire to the third finger\r\nof Nadara's left hand.\r\n\r\nThe old man saw. A look of relief and contentment that was almost a\r\nsmile settled upon his features, as, with a gasping sigh, he sank\r\nlimply into Thandar's arms, dead.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon several of the younger men carried the body of Nadara's\r\nfoster father to the top of the cliff, depositing it about half a mile\r\nfrom the caves. There was no ceremony. In it, though, Waldo Emerson saw\r\nwhat might have been the first human funeral cortege--simple, sensible\r\nand utilitarian--from which the human race has retrograded to the\r\nostentatious, ridiculous, pestilent burials of present day civilization.\r\n\r\nThe young men, acting under Big Fist's orders, carried the worthless\r\nhusk to a safe distance from the caves, leaving it there to the rapid\r\ndisintegration provided by the beasts and birds of prey.\r\n\r\nNadara wept, silently. An elderly lady with a single tooth, espying\r\nher, moaned in sympathy. Presently other females, attracted by the\r\nmoaning, joined them, and, becoming affected by the strange hysteria\r\nto which womankind is heir, mingled their moans with those of the\r\ntoothless one.\r\n\r\nExcited by their own noise they soon were shrieking and screaming in\r\nhideous chorus. Then came Big Fist and others of the men. The din\r\nannoyed them. They set upon the mourners with their fists and teeth\r\nscattering them in all directions. Thus ended the festivities.\r\n\r\nOr would have had not Big Fist made the fatal mistake of launching a\r\nblow at Nadara. Thandar had been standing nearby looking with wonder\r\nupon the strange scene.\r\n\r\nHe had noted the quiet grief of the young girl--real grief; and he had\r\nwitnessed the hysterical variety of the \"mourners\"--not sham grief.\r\nPrecisely, because they made no pretense to grief--it was noise to\r\nwhich they aspired. And as the fiendish din had set his own nerves on\r\nedge he wondered not at all that Big Fist and the other men should\r\ntake steps to quell the tumult.\r\n\r\nThe female half-brutes were theirs and Waldo Emerson had reverted\r\nsufficiently to the primitive to feel no incentive to interfere. But\r\nNadara was not theirs--she was not of them, and even had she not\r\nbelonged to him the American would have felt bound to stand between her\r\nand the savage creatures among whom fate had cast her.\r\n\r\nThat she did belong to him, however, sent him hot with the blood lust\r\nof the killer as he sprang to intercept the rush of Big Fist toward her.\r\n\r\nWaldo Emerson Smith-Jones had learned nothing of the manly art of\r\nself-defense in that other life that had been so zealously guarded from\r\nthe rude and vulgar. This was unfortunate since it would have given him\r\na great advantage over the man-brute. A single well-timed swing to that\r\nunguarded chin would have ended hostilities at once; but of hooks and\r\njabs and jolts, scientific, Thandar knew nothing.\r\n\r\nExcept for his crude weapons he was as primeval in battle as his\r\noriginal anthropoid progenitor, and quite as often as not he forgot all\r\nabout his sword, his knife, his bow and arrows and his spear when, half\r\nstooped, he crouched to meet the charge of a foeman.\r\n\r\nNow he sprang for Big Fist's hairy throat. There was a sullen thud\r\nas the two bodies met, and then, rolling, biting and tearing, they\r\nstruggled hither and thither upon the rocky ground at the base of the\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\nThe other men desisted from their attack upon the women. The women\r\nceased their vocal mourning. In a little circle they formed about the\r\ncontestants--a circle which moved this way and that as the fighters\r\nmoved, keeping them always in the center.\r\n\r\nNadara forced her way through them to the front. She wished to be near\r\nThandar. In her hand she carried a jagged bit of granite--one could\r\nnever tell.\r\n\r\nBig Fist was burly--mountainous--but Thandar was muscled like Nagoola,\r\nthe black panther. His movements were all grace and ease, but oh, so\r\nirresistible. A sudden and unexpected blow upon the side of Big Fist's\r\nhead bent that bullet-shaped thing sidewards with a jerk that almost\r\ndislocated the neck.\r\n\r\nBig Fist shrieked with the pain of it. Thandar, delighted by the result\r\nof the accidental blow, repeated it. Big Fist bellowed--agonized.\r\nHe made a last supreme effort to close with his agile foeman, and\r\nsucceeded. His teeth sought Thandar's throat, but the act brought his\r\nown jugular close to Thandar's jaws.\r\n\r\nThe strong white teeth of Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones closed upon it as\r\nnaturally as though no countless ages had rolled their snail-like way\r\nbetween himself and the last of his progenitors to bury bloody fangs in\r\nthe soft flesh of an antagonist.\r\n\r\nWasted ages! fleeing from the primitive and the brute toward the\r\nneoteric and the human--in a brief instant your labors are undone, the\r\nveneer of eons crumbles in the heat of some pristine passion revealing\r\nagain naked and unashamed, the primitive and the brute.\r\n\r\nBig Fist, white now from terror at impending death, struggled to be\r\nfree. Thandar buried his teeth more deeply. There was a sudden rush of\r\nspurting blood that choked him. Big Fist relaxed, inert.\r\n\r\nThandar, drenched crimson, rose to his feet. The huge body on the\r\nground before him floundered spasmodically once or twice as the life\r\nblood gushed from the severed jugular. The eyes rolled up and set,\r\nthere was a final twitch and Big Fist was dead.\r\n\r\nThandar turned toward the circle of interested spectators. He singled\r\nout a burly quartet.\r\n\r\n\"Bear Big Fist to the cliff top,\" he commanded. \"When you return we\r\nshall choose a king.\"\r\n\r\nThe men did as they were bid. They did not at all understand what\r\nThandar meant by choosing a king. Having slain Big Fist, Thandar was\r\nking, unless some ambitious one desired to dispute his right to reign.\r\nBut all had seen him slay Big Fist, and all knew that he had killed\r\nKorth and Flatfoot, so who was there would dare question his kingship?\r\n\r\nWhen they had come back to the village Thandar gathered them beneath a\r\ngreat tree that grew close to the base of the cliff. Here they squatted\r\nupon their haunches in a rough circle. Behind them stood the women and\r\nchildren, wide-eyed and curious.\r\n\r\n\"Let us choose a king,\" said Thandar, when all had come.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, then one of the older men spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I am an old man. I have seen many kings. They come by killing. They go\r\nby killing. Thandar has killed two kings. Now he is king. Who wishes to\r\nkill Thandar and become king?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\nThe old man arose.\r\n\r\n\"It was foolish to come here to choose a king,\" he said, \"when a king\r\nwe already have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" commanded Thandar. \"Let us choose a king properly. Because I\r\nhave killed Flatfoot and Big Fist does not prove that I can make a good\r\nking. Was Flatfoot a good king?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a bad man,\" replied the ancient one.\r\n\r\n\"Has a good man ever been king?\" asked Thandar.\r\n\r\nThe old fellow puckered his brow in thought.\r\n\r\n\"Not for a long time,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"That is because you always permit a bully and a brute to rule you,\"\r\nsaid Thandar. \"That is not the proper way to choose a king. Rather you\r\nshould come together as we are come, and among you talk over the needs\r\nof the tribe and when you are decided as to what measures are best for\r\nthe welfare of the members of the tribe then should you select the man\r\nbest fitted to carry out your plans. That is a better way to choose a\r\nking.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man laughed.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" he said, \"would come a Big Fist or a Flatfoot and slay our\r\nking that he might be king in his place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever seen a man who could slay all the other men of the tribe\r\nat the same time?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"That is my answer to your argument,\" said Thandar. \"Those who choose\r\nthe king can protect him from his enemies. So long as he is a good king\r\nthey should do so, but when he becomes a bad king they can then select\r\nanother, and if the bad king refuses to obey the new it would be an\r\neasy matter for several men to kill him or drive him away, no matter\r\nhow mighty a fighter he might be.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of the men nodded understandingly.\r\n\r\n\"We had not thought of that,\" they said. \"Thandar is indeed wise.\"\r\n\r\n\"So now,\" continued the American, \"let us choose a king whom the\r\nmajority of us want, and then so long as he is a good king the majority\r\nof us must fight for him and protect him. Let us choose a man whom we\r\nknow to be a good man regardless of his ability to kill his fellows,\r\nfor if he has the majority of the tribe to fight for him what need\r\nwill he have to fight for himself? What we want is a wise man--one who\r\ncan lead the tribe to fertile lands and good hunting, and in times of\r\nbattle direct the fighting intelligently. Flatfoot and Big Fist had not\r\nbrains enough between them to do aught but steal the mates of other\r\nmen. Such should not be the business of kings. Your king should protect\r\nyour mates from such as Flatfoot, and he should punish those who would\r\nsteal them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how may he do these things?\" asked a young man, \"if he is not the\r\nbest fighter in the tribe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I not shown you how?\" asked Thandar. \"We who make him king shall\r\nbe his fighters--he will not need to fight with his own hands.\"\r\n\r\nAgain there was a long silence. Then the old man spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"There is wisdom in the talk of Thandar. Let us choose a king who will\r\nhave to be good to us if he wishes to remain king. It is very bad for\r\nus to have a king whom we fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, for one,\" said the young man who had previously spoken, \"do not\r\ncare to be ruled by a king unless he is able to defeat me in battle. If\r\nI can defeat him then I should be king.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they took sides, but at last they compromised by selecting one\r\nwhom they knew to be wise and a great fighter as well. Thus they chose\r\nThandar king.\r\n\r\n\"Once each week,\" said the new king, \"we shall gather here and talk\r\namong ourselves of the things which are for the best good of the tribe,\r\nand what seems best to the majority shall be done. The tribe will tell\r\nthe king what to do--the king will carry out the work. And all must\r\nfight when the king says fight and all must work when the king says\r\nwork, for we shall all be fighting or working for the whole tribe, and\r\nI, Thandar, your king, shall fight and work the hardest of you all.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a new idea to them and placed the kingship in a totally\r\ndifferent light from any by which they had previously viewed it. That\r\nit would take a long time for them to really absorb the idea Thandar\r\nknew, and he was glad that in the meantime they had a king who could\r\ncommand their respect according to their former standards.\r\n\r\nAnd he smiled when he thought of the change that had taken place in him\r\nsince first he had sat trembling, weeping and coughing upon the lonely\r\nshore before the terrifying forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT NAGOOLA\r\n\r\n\r\nWaldo Emerson Smith-Jones had gladly embraced the opportunity which\r\nchance had offered him to assume the kingship of the little tribe of\r\ntroglodytes. First, because his position would assure Nadara greater\r\nsafety, and, second, because of the opening it would give him for the\r\nexercise of his new-found initiative.\r\n\r\nWhere before he had shrunk from responsibility he now found himself\r\nanxious to assume it. He longed to do, where formerly he had been\r\ncontent to but read of the accomplishments of others.\r\n\r\nTo his chagrin, however, he soon discovered that the classical\r\neducation to which his earlier life had been devoted under the guidance\r\nof a fond and ultra-cultured mother was to prove a most inadequate\r\nfoundation upon which to build a practical scheme of life for himself\r\nand his people.\r\n\r\nHe wished to teach his tribe to construct permanent and comfortable\r\nhouses, but he could not recollect any practical hints on carpentry\r\nthat he had obtained from Ovid.\r\n\r\nHis people lived by hunting small rodents, robbing birds' nests, and\r\ngathering wild fruit and vegetables. Thandar desired to institute a\r\nscheme of community farming, but the works of the Cyclic Poets, with\r\nwhich he was quite familiar, seemed to offer little of value along\r\nagricultural lines. He regretted that he had not matriculated at an\r\nagricultural college west of the Alleghanies rather than at Harvard.\r\n\r\nHowever, he determined to do the best he could with the meager\r\nknowledge he possessed of things practical--a knowledge so meager\r\nthat it consisted almost entirely of the bare definition of the word\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nIt was a germ, however, for it presupposed a knowledge of the results\r\nthat might be obtained through agriculture.\r\n\r\nSo Thandar found himself a step ahead of the earliest of his\r\nprogenitors who had thought to plant purposely the seeds that nature\r\nheretofore had distributed haphazard through the agencies of wind and\r\nbird and beast; but only a step ahead.\r\n\r\nHe realized that he occupied a very remarkable position in the march\r\nof ages. He had known and seen and benefited by all the accumulated\r\nknowledge of ages of progression from the stone age to the twentieth\r\ncentury, and now, suddenly, fate had snatched him back into the stone\r\nage, or possibly a few eons farther back, only to show him that all\r\nthat he had from a knowledge of other men's knowledge was keen\r\ndissatisfaction with the stone age.\r\n\r\nHe had lived in houses of wood and brick and looked through windows\r\nof glass. He had read in the light of gas and electricity, and he\r\neven knew of candles; but he could not fashion the tools to build a\r\nhouse, he could not have made a brick to have saved his life, glass had\r\nsuddenly become one of the wonders of the world to him, and as for gas\r\nand electricity and candles they had become one with the mystery of the\r\nSphinx.\r\n\r\nHe could write verse in excellent Greek, but he was no longer proud of\r\nthat fact. He would much rather that he had been able to tan a hide,\r\nor make fire without matches. Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones had a year\r\nago been exceedingly proud of his intellect and his learning, but for\r\na year his ego had been shrinking until now he felt himself the most\r\npitiful ignoramus on earth. \"Criminally ignorant,\" he said to Nadara,\r\n\"for I have thrown away the opportunities of a lifetime devoted to the\r\naccumulation of useless erudition when I might have been profiting by\r\nthe practical knowledge which has dragged the world from the black bit\r\nof barbarism to the light of modern achievement--I might not only have\r\ndone this but, myself, added something to the glory and welfare of\r\nmankind. I am no good, Nadara--worse than useless.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl touched his strong brown hand caressingly, looking proudly\r\ninto his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"To me you are very wonderful, Thandar,\" she said. \"With your own hands\r\nyou slew Nagoola, the most terrible beast in the world, and Korth, and\r\nFlatfoot, and Big Fist lie dead beneath the vultures because of your\r\nmight--single-handed you killed them all; three awesome men. No, my\r\nThandar is greater than all other men.\"\r\n\r\nNor could Waldo Emerson repress the swelling tide of pride that surged\r\nthrough him as the girl he loved recounted his exploits. No longer did\r\nhe think of his achievements as \"vulgar physical prowess.\" The old\r\nWaldo Emerson, whose temperature had risen regularly at three o'clock\r\neach afternoon, whose pitifully skinny body had been racked by coughing\r\ncontinually, whose eyes had been terror filled by day and by night at\r\nthe rustling of dry leaves, was dead.\r\n\r\nIn his place stood a great, full blooded man, brown skinned and\r\nsteel thewed; fearless, self-reliant, almost brutal in his pride of\r\npower--Thandar, the cave man.\r\n\r\nThe months that passed as Thandar led his people from one honeycombed\r\ncliff to another as he sought a fitting place for a permanent village\r\nwere filled with happiness for Nadara and the king.\r\n\r\nThe girl's happiness was slightly alloyed by the fact that Thandar\r\nfailed to claim her as his own. She could not yet quite understand the\r\nethics which separated them. Thandar tried repeatedly to explain to her\r\nthat some day they were to return to his own world, and that that world\r\nwould not accept her unless she had been joined to him according to the\r\nrites and ceremonies which it had originated.\r\n\r\n\"Will this marriage ceremony of which you tell me make you love me\r\nmore?\" asked Nadara.\r\n\r\nThandar laughed and took her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"I could not love you more,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then of what good is it?\"\r\n\r\nThandar shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to explain,\" he said, \"especially to such a lovable\r\nlittle pagan as my Nadara. You must be satisfied to know--accept my\r\nword for it--that it is because I love you that we must wait.\"\r\n\r\nNow it was the girl's turn to shake her head.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot understand,\" she said. \"My people take their mates as they\r\nwill and they are satisfied and everybody is satisfied and all is well;\r\nbut their king, who may mate as he chooses, waits until a man whom he\r\ndoes not know and who lives across the great water where we may never\r\ngo, gives him permission to mate with one who loves him--with one whom\r\nhe _says_ he loves.\"\r\n\r\nThandar noticed the emphasis which Nadara put upon the word \"says.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some day,\" he said, \"when we have reached my world you will know that\r\nI was right, and you will thank me. Until then, Nadara, you must trust\r\nme, and,\" he added half to himself, \"God knows I have earned your trust\r\neven if you do not know it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so Nadara made believe that she was satisfied but in her heart of\r\nhearts she still feared that Thandar did not really love her, nor did\r\nthe half-veiled comments of the women add at all to her peace of mind.\r\n\r\nDuring all the time that Thandar was with her he had been teaching her\r\nhis language for he had set his heart upon taking her home, and he\r\nwished her to be as well prepared for her introduction to Boston and\r\ncivilization as he could make her.\r\n\r\nThandar's plan was to find a suitable location within sight of the sea\r\nthat he might always be upon the lookout for a ship. At last he found\r\nsuch a place--a level meadow land upon a low plateau overlooking the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nHe had come upon it while he wandered alone several miles from the\r\ntemporary cliff dwellings the tribe was occupying. The soil, when he\r\ndug into it, he found to be rich and black. There was timber upon one\r\nside and upon the other overhanging cliffs of soft limestone.\r\n\r\nIt was Thandar's plan to build a village partly of logs against the\r\nface of the cliff, burrowing inward behind the dwellings for such\r\nadditional apartments as each family might require.\r\n\r\nThe caves alone would have proved sufficient shelter, but the man hoped\r\nby compelling his people to construct a portion of each dwelling of\r\nlogs to engender within each family a certain feeling of ownership and\r\npride in personal possession as would make it less easy for them to\r\ngive up their abodes than in the past, when it had been necessary but\r\nto move to another cliff to find caves equally as comfortable as those\r\nwhich they so easily abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn other words he hoped to give them a word which their vocabulary had\r\nnever held--home.\r\n\r\nWhether or not he would have succeeded we may never know, for fate\r\nstepped in at the last moment to alter with a single stroke his every\r\nplan and aspiration.\r\n\r\nAs he returned to his people that afternoon filled with the enthusiasm\r\nof his hopes a burly, hairy figure crept warily after him. As Thandar\r\nemerged from the brush which reaches close to the cliffs where the\r\ntemporary encampment had been made Nadara, watching for him, ran\r\nforward to meet him.\r\n\r\nThe creature upon Thandar's trail halted at the edge of the bush. As\r\nhis close-set eyes fell upon the girl his flabby lips vibrated to the\r\nquick intaking of his breath and his red lids half closed in cunning\r\nand desire.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments he watched the man and the maid as they turned and\r\nwalked slowly toward the cliffs, the arm of the former about the brown\r\nshoulders of the latter. Then he too turned and melted into the tangled\r\nbranches behind him.\r\n\r\nThat evening Thandar gathered the members of the tribe about him at\r\nthe foot of the cliff. They sat around a great fire while Thandar,\r\ntheir king, explained to them in minutest detail the future that he had\r\nmapped out for them.\r\n\r\nSome of the old men shook their heads, for here was an unheard of\r\nthing--a change from the accustomed ordering of their lives--and they\r\nwere loath to change regardless of the benefits which might accrue.\r\n\r\nBut for the most part the people welcomed the idea of comfortable\r\nand permanent habitations, though their anticipatory joy, Thandar\r\nreasoned, was due largely to a childish eagerness for something new and\r\ndifferent--whether their enthusiasm would survive the additional labors\r\nwhich the new life was sure to entail was another question.\r\n\r\nSo Thandar laid down the new laws that were to guide his people\r\nthereafter. The men were to make all implements and weapons, for he\r\nhad already taught them to use arrows and spears. The women were to\r\nkeep all edged tools sharp. The men were to hew the logs and build the\r\nhouses--the women make garments, cook and keep the houses in order.\r\n\r\nThe men were to turn up the soil, the women were to sow the seeds, and\r\ncultivate the growing crops, which, later, all hands must turn to and\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nThe hunting and the fighting devolved upon the men, but the fighting\r\nmust be confined to enemies of the tribe. A man who killed another\r\nmember of the tribe except in defense of his home or his own person was\r\nto suffer death.\r\n\r\nOther laws he made--good laws--which even these primitive people could\r\nsee were good. It was quite late when the last of them crawled into\r\nhis comfortless cave to dream of large, airy rooms built of the trees\r\nof the forest; of good food in plenty just before the rains as well as\r\nafter; of security from the periodic raids of the \"bad men.\"\r\n\r\nThandar and Nadara were the last to go. Together they sat upon a\r\nnarrow ledge before Nadara's cave, the moonlight falling upon their\r\nglistening, naked shoulders, while they talked and dreamed together of\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThandar had been talking of the wonderful plans which seemed to fill\r\nhis whole mind--of the future of the tribe--of the great strides\r\ntoward civilization they could make in a few brief years if they could\r\nbut be made to follow the simple plans he had in mind.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" he said, \"in ten years they should have bridged a gulf that it\r\nmust have required ages for our ancestors to span.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are planning ten years ahead, Thandar,\" she asked, \"when only\r\nyesterday you were saying that once beside the sea you hoped it would\r\nbe but a short time before we might sight a passing vessel that would\r\nbear us away to your civilization? Must we wait ten years, Thandar?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am planning for them,\" he replied. \"We may not be here to witness\r\nthe changes; but I wish to start them upon the road, and when we go I\r\nshall see to it that a king is chosen in my place who has the courage\r\nand the desire to carry out my plans.\r\n\r\n\"Yet,\" he added, musingly, \"it would be splendid could we but return\r\nto complete our work. Never, Nadara, have I performed a single\r\nconstructive act for the benefit of my fellow man, but now I see an\r\nopportunity to do something, however small it may seem, to--what was\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\nA low rumbling muttered threateningly out of the west. Deep and ominous\r\nit sounded, yet so low that it failed to awaken any member of the\r\nsleeping tribe.\r\n\r\nBefore either could again speak there came a slight trembling of the\r\nearth beneath them, scarcely sufficient to have been noticeable had it\r\nnot been preceded by the distant grumbling of the earth's bowels.\r\n\r\nThe two upon the moonlit ledge came to their feet, and Nadara drew\r\nclose to Thandar, the man's arm encircling her shoulders protectingly.\r\n\r\n\"The Great Nagoola,\" she whispered. \"Again he seeks to escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Thandar. \"It is an earthquake--distant and\r\nquite harmless to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is The Great Nagoola,\" insisted Nadara. \"Long time ago, when\r\nour fathers' fathers were yet unborn, The Great Nagoola roamed the land\r\ndevouring all that chanced to come in his way--men, beasts, birds,\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n\"One day my people came upon him sleeping in a deep gorge between two\r\nmountains. They were mighty men in those days, and when they saw their\r\ngreat enemy asleep there in the gorge half of them went upon one side\r\nand half upon the other, and they pushed the two mountains over into\r\nthe gorge upon the sleeping beast, imprisoning him there.\r\n\r\n\"It is all true, for my mother had it from her mother, who in turn was\r\ntold it by her mother--thus has it been handed down truthfully since it\r\nhappened long time ago.\r\n\r\n\"And even to this day is occasionally heard the growling of The Great\r\nNagoola in his anger, and the earth shakes and trembles as he strives\r\nfar, far beneath to shake the mountains from him and escape. Did you\r\nnot hear his voice and feel the ground rock?\"\r\n\r\nThandar laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we are quite safe then,\" he cried, \"for with two mountains piled\r\nupon him he cannot escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows?\" asked Nadara. \"He is huge--as huge, himself, as a small\r\nmountain. Some day, they say, he will escape, and then naught will\r\npacify his rage until he has destroyed every living creature upon the\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not worry, little one,\" said Thandar. \"The Great Nagoola will\r\nhave to grumble louder and struggle more fiercely before ever he may\r\ndislodge the two mountains. Even now he is quiet again, so run to your\r\ncave, sweetheart, nor bother your pretty head with useless worries--it\r\nis time that all good people were asleep,\" and he stooped and kissed\r\nher as she turned to go.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she clung to him.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid, Thandar,\" she whispered. \"Why, I do not know. I only know\r\nthat I am afraid, with a great fear that will not be quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly the following morning while several of the women and children\r\nwere at the river drawing water the balance of the tribe of Thandar was\r\nstartled into wakefulness by piercing shrieks from the direction the\r\nwater carriers had taken.\r\n\r\nBefore the great, hairy men, led by the smooth-skinned Thandar, had\r\nreached the foot of the cliff in their rush to the rescue of the women\r\nseveral of the latter appeared at the edge of the forest, running\r\nswiftly toward the caves.\r\n\r\nMingled with their screams of terror were cries of: \"The bad men! The\r\nbad men!\" But these were not needed to acquaint the rescuers with the\r\ncause of the commotion, for at the heels of the women came Thurg and a\r\nscore of his vicious brutes. Little better than anthropoid apes were\r\nthey. Long armed, hairy, skulking monsters, whose close-set eyes and\r\nretreating foreheads proclaimed more intimate propinquity to the higher\r\norders of brutes than to civilized man.\r\n\r\nWoe betide male or female who fell into their remorseless clutches,\r\nsince to the base passions, unrestrained, that mark the primordial they\r\nwere addicted to the foulest forms of cannibalism.\r\n\r\nIn the past their raids upon their neighbors for meat and women had met\r\nwith but slight resistance--the terrified cave dwellers scampering to\r\nthe safety of their dizzy ledges from whence they might hurl stones and\r\nroll boulders down to the confusion of any foe however ferocious.\r\n\r\nAlways the bad men caught a few unwary victims before the safety of the\r\nledges could be attained, but this time there was a difference. Thurg\r\nwas delighted. The men were rushing downward to meet him--great indeed\r\nwould be the feast which should follow this day's fighting, for with\r\nthe men disposed of there would be but little difficulty in storming\r\nthe cliff and carrying off all the women and children, and as he\r\nthought upon these things there floated in his little brain the image\r\nof the beautiful girl he had watched come down the evening before from\r\nthe caves to meet the smooth-skinned warrior who twice now had bested\r\nThurg in battle.\r\n\r\nThat Thandar's men might turn the tables upon him never for a moment\r\noccurred to Thurg. Nor was there little wonder, since, mighty as were\r\nthe muscles of the cave men, they were weaklings by comparison with the\r\nhalf-brutes of Thurg--only the smooth-skinned stranger troubled the\r\nmuddy mind of the near-man.\r\n\r\nIt puzzled him a little, though, to see the long slim sticks that the\r\nenemy carried, and the little slivers in skin bags upon their backs,\r\nand the strange curved branches whose ends were connected by slender\r\nbits of gut. What were these things for!\r\n\r\nSoon he was to know--this and other things.\r\n\r\nThandar's warriors did not rush upon Thurg and his brutes in a close\r\npacked, yelling mob. Instead they trotted slowly forward in a long thin\r\nline that stretched out parallel with the base of the cliff. In the\r\ncenter, directly in front of the charging bad men, was Thandar, calling\r\ndirections to his people, first upon one hand and then upon the other.\r\n\r\nAnd in accordance with his commands the ends of the line began to\r\nquicken the pace, so that quickly Thurg saw that there were men\r\nbefore him, and men upon either hand, and now, at fifty feet, while\r\nall were advancing cautiously, crouched for the final hand-to-hand\r\nencounter, he saw the enemy slip each a sliver into the gut of the bent\r\nbranches--there was a sudden chorus of twangs, and Thurg felt a sharp\r\npain in his neck. Involuntarily he clapped his hand to the spot to find\r\none of the slivers sticking there, scarce an inch from his jugular.\r\n\r\nWith a howl of rage he snatched the thing from him, and as he leaped\r\nto the charge to punish these audacious mad-men he noted a dozen of\r\nhis henchmen plucking slivers from various portions of their bodies,\r\nwhile two lay quite still upon the grass with just the ends of slivers\r\nprotruding from their breasts.\r\n\r\nThe sight brought the beast-man to a momentary halt. He saw his fellows\r\ncharging in upon the foe--he saw another volley of slivers speed from\r\nthe bent branches. Down went another of his fighters, and then the\r\nenemy cast aside their strange weapons at a shouted command from the\r\nsmooth-skinned one and grasping their long, slim sticks ran forward to\r\nmeet Thurg's people.\r\n\r\nThurg smiled. It would soon be over now. He turned toward one who was\r\nbearing down upon him--it was Thandar. Thurg crouched to meet the\r\ncharge. Rage, revenge, the lust for blood fired his bestial brain. With\r\nhis huge paws he would tear the puny stick from this creature's grasp,\r\nand this time he would gain his hold upon that smooth throat. He licked\r\nhis lips. And then out of the corner of his eye he glanced to the right.\r\n\r\nWhat strange sight was this! His people flying? It was incredible!\r\nAnd yet it was true. Growling and raging in pain and anger they were\r\nrunning a gauntlet of fire-sharpened lances. Three lay dead. The others\r\nwere streaming blood as they fled before the relentless prodding devils\r\nat their backs.\r\n\r\nIt was enough for Thurg. He did not wait to close with Thandar. A\r\nsingle howl of dismay broke from his flabby lips, and then he wheeled\r\nand dashed for the wood. He was the last to pass through the rapidly\r\nconverging ends of Thandar's primitive battle line. He was running\r\nso fast that, afterward, Nadara who was watching the battle from the\r\ncliff-side insisted that his feet flew higher than his head at each\r\nfrantic leap.\r\n\r\nThandar and his victorious army pursued the enemy through the wood for\r\na mile or more, then they returned, laughing and shouting, to receive\r\nthe plaudits of the old men, the women and the children.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy day. There was feasting. And Thandar, having in mind\r\nthings he had read of savage races, improvised a dance in honor of the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nHe knew little more of savage dances than his tribesmen did of the\r\ntwo-step and the waltz; but he knew that dancing and song and play\r\nmarked in themselves a great step upward in the evolution of man from\r\nthe lower orders, and so he meant to teach these things to his people.\r\n\r\nA red flush spread to his temples as he thought of his dignified father\r\nand his stately mother and with what horrified emotions they would view\r\nhim now could they but see him--naked but for a g-string and a panther\r\nskin, moving with leaps and bounds, and now stately waltz steps in a\r\ngreat circle, clapping his hands in time to his movements, while behind\r\nhim strung a score of lusty, naked warriors, mimicking his every antic\r\nwith the fidelity of apes.\r\n\r\nAbout them squatted the balance of the tribe more intensely interested\r\nin this, the first ceremonial function of their lives, than with any\r\nother occurrence that had ever befallen them. They, too, now clapped\r\ntheir hands in time with the dancers.\r\n\r\nNadara stood with parted lips and wide eyes watching the strange\r\nscene. Within her it seemed that something was struggling for\r\nexpression--something that she must have known long, long\r\nago--something that she had forgotten but that she presently must\r\nrecall. With it came an insistent urge--her feet could scarce remain\r\nquietly upon the ground, and great waves of melody and song welled into\r\nher heart and throat, though what they were and what they meant she did\r\nnot know.\r\n\r\nShe only knew that she was intensely excited and happy and that her\r\nwhole being seemed as light and airy as the soft wind that blew across\r\nthe gently swaying treetops of the forest.\r\n\r\nNow the dance was done. Thandar had led the warriors back to the feast.\r\nIn the center of the circle where the naked bodies of the men had\r\nleaped and swirled to the clapping of many hands was an open space,\r\ndeserted. Into it Nadara ran, drawn by some subtile excitement of the\r\nsoul which she could not have fathomed had she tried--which she did not\r\ntry to fathom.\r\n\r\nAround her slim, graceful figure was draped the glossy, black pelt of\r\nNagoola--another trophy of the prowess of her man. It half concealed\r\nbut to accentuate the beauties of her form.\r\n\r\nWith eyes half-closed she took a half dozen graceful, tentative steps.\r\nNow the eyes of Thandar and several others were upon her, but she did\r\nnot see them. Suddenly, with outthrown arms, she commenced to dance,\r\nbending her lithe body, swaying from side to side as she fell, with\r\ngraceful abandon, into steps and poses that seemed as natural to her as\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nAbout the little circle she wove her simple yet intricate way, and now\r\nevery eye was upon her as every savage heart leaped in unison with her\r\nshapely feet, rising and falling in harmony with her lithe, brown limbs.\r\n\r\nAnd of all the hearts that leaped, fastest leaped the heart of Thandar,\r\nfor he saw in the poetry of motion of the untutored girl the proof of\r\nher birth-right--the truth of all that he had guessed of her origin\r\nsince her foster father had related the story of her birth upon his\r\ndeath bed. None but a child of an age-old culture could possess this\r\ninherent talent. Any moment he expected her lips to break forth in\r\nsong, nor was he to be disappointed, for presently, as the circling\r\ncave folk commenced to clap their palms in time to her steps, Nadara\r\nlifted her voice in clear and bird-like notes--a worldless paean of\r\nlove and life and happiness.\r\n\r\nAt last, exhausted, she paused, and as her eyes fell upon Thandar they\r\nbroke into a merry laugh.\r\n\r\n\"The king is not the only one who can leap and play upon his feet,\" she\r\ncried.\r\n\r\nThandar came to the center of the circle and kneeling at her feet took\r\none of her hands in his and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\"The king is only mortal and a man,\" he said. \"It is no reproach that\r\nhe cannot equal the divine grace of a goddess. You are very wonderful,\r\nmy Nadara,\" he continued, \"From loving you I am coming to worship you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd within the deep and silent wood another was stirred with mighty\r\nemotions by the sight of the half-naked, graceful girl. It was Thurg,\r\nthe bad man, who had sneaked back alone to the edge of the forest that\r\nhe might seek an opportunity to be revenged upon Thandar and his people.\r\n\r\nHalf formed in his evil brain had been a certain plan, which the sight\r\nof Nadara, dancing in the firelight, had turned to concrete resolution.\r\n\r\nWith the dancing and the feasting over, the tribe of Thandar betook\r\nitself by ones and twos to the rocky caves that they expected so soon\r\nto desert for the more comfortable village which they were to build\r\nunder the direction of their king, to the east, beside the great water.\r\n\r\nAt last all was still--the village slept. No sentry guarded their\r\nslumbers, for Thandar, steeped in book learning, must needs add to his\r\nstock of practical knowledge by bitter experience, and never yet had\r\nthe cause arisen for a night guard about his village.\r\n\r\nHaving defeated Thurg and his people he thought that they would not\r\nreturn again, and certainly not by night, for the people of this wild\r\nisland roamed seldom by night, having too much respect for the teeth\r\nand talons of Nagoola to venture forth after darkness had settled upon\r\nthe grim forests and the lonely plains.\r\n\r\nBut a tempest of uncontrolled emotions surged through the hairy breast\r\nof Thurg. He forgot Nagoola. He thought only of revenge--revenge and\r\nthe black haired beauty who had so many times eluded him.\r\n\r\nAnd as he saw her dancing in the circle of hand-clapping tribesmen, in\r\nthe light of the brush wood fire, his desire for her became a veritable\r\nfrenzy.\r\n\r\nHe could scarce restrain himself from rushing single-handed among his\r\nfoes and snatching the girl before their faces. However, caution came\r\nto his rescue, and so he waited, albeit impatiently, until the last of\r\nthe cave folk had retired to his cavern.\r\n\r\nHe had seen into which Nadara had withdrawn--one that lay far up\r\nthe face of the steep cliff and directly above the cave occupied by\r\nThandar. The moon was overcast, the fire at the foot of the cliff had\r\ndied to glowing embers, all was wrapped in darkness and in shadow. Far\r\nin the depths of the wood Nagoola coughed and cried. The weird sound\r\nraised the coarse hair at the nape of Thurg's bull neck. He cast an\r\napprehensive backward glance, then, crouching low, he moved quickly and\r\nsilently across the clearing toward the base of the cliff.\r\n\r\nFlattened against a protruding boulder there he waited, listening, for\r\na moment. No sound broke the stillness of the sleeping village. None\r\nhad seen his approach--of that he was convinced.\r\n\r\nCarefully he began the ascent of the cliff face, made difficult by the\r\nremoval of the rough ladders that led from ledge to ledge by day, but\r\nwhich were withdrawn with the retiring of the community to their dark\r\nholes.\r\n\r\nBut Thurg had dragged with him from the forest a slim sapling. This he\r\nleaned against the face of the cliff. Its uptilted end just topped the\r\nlowest ledge.\r\n\r\nThurg was almost as large and quite as clumsy in appearance as a\r\ngorilla, yet he was not as far removed from his true arboreal ancestors\r\nas is the great simian, and so he accomplished in silence and with\r\nevident ease what his great bulk might have seemed to have relegated to\r\nthe impossible.\r\n\r\nLike a huge cat he scrambled up the frail pole until his fingers\r\nclutched the ledge edge above him. Ape-like he drew himself to a\r\nsquatting position there. Then he groped for the ladder that the cave\r\nfolk had drawn up from below.\r\n\r\nThis he erected to the next ledge above. Thereafter the way was easy,\r\nfor the balance of the ledges were connected by steeply inclined trails\r\ncut into the cliff face. This had been an innovation of Thandar's who\r\nconsidered the rickety ladders not only a nuisance, but extremely\r\ndangerous to life and limb, for scarce a day passed that some child or\r\nwoman did not receive a bad fall because of them.\r\n\r\nSo Thurg, with Thandar's unintentional aid, came easily to the mouth of\r\nNadara's cave.\r\n\r\nGreat had been the temptation as he passed the cave below to enter and\r\nslay his enemy. Never had Thurg so hated any creature as he hated this\r\nsmooth-skinned interloper--with all the venom of his mean soul he hated\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNow he stooped, listening, just beside the entrance to the cave. He\r\ncould hear the regular breathing of the girl within. The hot blood\r\nsurged through his brute veins. His huge paws opened and closed\r\nspasmodically. His breath sucked hot between his flabby lips.\r\n\r\nJust beneath him Thandar lay dreaming. He saw a wonderful vision of a\r\nbeautiful nymph dancing in the firelight. In a circle about her sat the\r\nSmith-Joneses, the Percy Standishes, the Livingston-Brownes, the Quincy\r\nAdams-Cootses, and a hundred more equally aristocratic families of\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem strange to Thandar that there was not enough clothing\r\namong the entire assemblage to have recently draped the Laocoön. His\r\nfather wore a becoming loin cloth, while the stately Mrs. John Alden\r\nSmith-Jones, his mother, was tastefully arrayed in a scant robe of the\r\nskins of small rodents sewn together with bits of gut.\r\n\r\nAs the nymph danced the audience kept time to her steps with loudly\r\nclapping palms, and when she was done they approached her one by one,\r\ncrawling upon their hands and knees, and kissed her hand.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he saw that the nymph was Nadara, and as he sprang forward to\r\nclaim her a large man with a coarse matted beard, a slanted forehead,\r\nand close-set eyes, leaped out from among the others, seized Nadara and\r\nfled with her toward a waiting trolley car.\r\n\r\nHe recognized the man as Thurg, and even in his dream it seemed rather\r\nincongruous that he should be clothed in well-fitting evening clothes.\r\n\r\nNadara screamed once, and the scream roused Thandar from his dream.\r\nRaising upon one elbow he looked toward the entrance of his cave. The\r\nrecollection of the dream swept back into his memory. With a little\r\nsigh of relief that it had been but a dream, he settled back once more\r\nupon his bed of grasses, and soon was wrapped in dreamless slumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ABDUCTION OF NADARA\r\n\r\n\r\nCautiously Thurg crawled into the cave where Nadara slept upon her\r\ncouch of soft grasses, wrapped in the glossy pelt of Nagoola, the black\r\npanther.\r\n\r\nThe hulking form of the beast-man blotted out the faint light that\r\nfiltered from the lesser darkness of the night without through the\r\njagged entrance to the cave.\r\n\r\nAll within was Stygian gloom.\r\n\r\nGroping with his hands Thurg came at last upon a corner of the grassy\r\npallet. Softly he wormed inch by inch closer to the sleeper. Now his\r\nfingers felt the thick fur of the panther skin.\r\n\r\nLightly, for so gross a thing, his touch followed the recumbent figure\r\nof the girl until his giant paws felt the silky luxuriance of her raven\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he paused. Then, quickly and silently, one great palm\r\nclapped roughly over Nadara's mouth, while the other arm encircled her\r\nwaist, lifting her from her bed.\r\n\r\nAwakened and terrified, Nadara struggled to free herself and to scream;\r\nbut the giant hand across her mouth effectually sealed her lips, while\r\nthe arm about her waist held her as firmly as might iron bands.\r\n\r\nThurg spoke no word, but as Nadara's hands came in contact with his\r\nhairy breast and matted beard as she fought for freedom she guessed the\r\nidentity of her abductor, and shuddered.\r\n\r\nWaiting only to assure himself that his hold upon his prisoner was\r\nsecure and that no trailing end of her robe might trip him in his\r\nflight down the cliff face, Thurg commenced the descent.\r\n\r\nOpposite the entrance to Thandar's cave Nadara redoubled her efforts to\r\nfree her mouth that she might scream aloud but once. Thurg, guessing\r\nher desire, pressed his palm the tighter, and in a moment the two had\r\npassed unnoticed to the ledge below.\r\n\r\nDown the winding trail of the upper ledges Thurg's task was\r\ncomparatively easy--thanks to Thandar, but at the second ledge from the\r\nbottom of the cliff he was compelled to take to the upper of the two\r\nladders which completed the way to the ground below.\r\n\r\nAnd here it was necessary to remove his hand from Nadara's mouth. In a\r\nlow growl he warned her to silence with threats of instant death, then\r\nhe removed his hand from across her face, grasped the top of the ladder\r\nand swung over the dangerous height with his burden under his arm.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Nadara was too paralyzed with terror to take advantage\r\nof her opportunity, but just as Thurg set foot upon the ledge at the\r\nbottom of the ladder she screamed aloud once.\r\n\r\nInstantly Thurg's hand fell roughly across her lips. Brutally he shook\r\nher, squeezing her body in his mighty grip until she gasped for breath,\r\nand each minute expected to feel her ribs snap to the terrific strain.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Thurg stood silently upon the ledge, compressing the\r\ntortured body of his victim and listening for signs of pursuit from\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nPresently the agony of her suffering overcame Nadara--she swooned.\r\nThurg felt her form relax, and his flabby lips twisted to a hideous\r\ngrin.\r\n\r\nThe cliff was quiet--the girl's scream had not disturbed the slumbers\r\nof her tribesmen. Thurg swung the ladder he had just descended over the\r\nedge of the cliff below, and a moment later he stood at the bottom with\r\nhis burden.\r\n\r\nWithout noise he removed the ladder and the sapling that he had used in\r\nhis ascent, laying them upon the ground at the foot of the cliff. This\r\nwould halt, temporarily, any pursuit until the cave men could bring\r\nother ladders from the higher levels, where they doubtless had them\r\nhidden.\r\n\r\nBut no pursuit developed, and Thurg disappeared into the dark forest\r\nwith his prize.\r\n\r\nFor a long distance he carried her, his little pig eyes searching and\r\nstraining to right and left into the black night for the first sign\r\nof savage beast. The half atrophied muscles of his little ears, still\r\nresponding to an almost dead instinct, strove to prick those misshapen\r\nmembers forward that they might catch the first crackling of dead\r\nleaves beneath the padded paw of the fanged night prowlers.\r\n\r\nBut the wood seemed dead. No living creature appeared to thwart the\r\nbeast-man's evil intent. Far behind him Thandar slept. Thurg grinned.\r\n\r\nThe moon broke through the clouds, splotching the ground all silver\r\ngreen beneath the forest trees. Nadara awoke from her swoon. They were\r\nin a little open glade. Instantly she recalled the happenings that\r\nhad immediately preceded her unconsciousness. In the moonlight she\r\nrecognized Thurg. He was smirking horribly down into her upturned face.\r\n\r\nThandar had often talked with her of religion. He had taught her of\r\nhis God, and now the girl thanked Him that Thurg was still too low\r\nin the scale of evolution to have learned to kiss. To have had that\r\nmatted beard, those flabby, pendulous lips pressed to hers! It was too\r\nhorrible--she closed her eyes in disgust.\r\n\r\nThurg lowered her to her feet. With one hand he still clutched her\r\nshoulder. She saw him standing there before her--his greedy, blood-shot\r\neyes devouring her. His awful lips shook and trembled as his hot breath\r\nsucked quickly in and out in excited gasps.\r\n\r\nShe knew that the end was coming. Frantically she cast about her for\r\nsome means of defense or escape. Thurg was drawing her toward him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she drew back her clenched fist and struck him full in the\r\nmouth, then, tearing herself from his grasp, she turned and fled.\r\n\r\nBut in a moment he was upon her. Seizing her roughly by the shoulders\r\nhe shook her viciously, hurling her to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe blood from his wounded lips dropped upon her face and throat.\r\n\r\nFrom the distance came a deep toned, thunderous rumbling. Thurg raised\r\nhis head and listened. Again and again came that awesome sound.\r\n\r\n\"The Great Nagoola is coming to punish you,\" whispered Nadara.\r\n\r\nThurg still remained squatting beside her. She had ceased to fight, for\r\nnow she felt that a greater power than hers was intervening to save her.\r\n\r\nThe ground beneath them trembled, shook and then tossed frightfully.\r\nThe rumbling and the roaring became deafening. Thurg, his passion\r\nfrozen in the face of this new terror, rose to his feet. For a moment\r\nthere was a lull, then came another and more terrific shock.\r\n\r\nThe earth rose and fell sickeningly. Fissures opened, engulfing trees,\r\nand then closed like hungry mouths gulping food long denied.\r\n\r\nThurg was thrown to the ground. Now he was terror stricken. He screamed\r\naloud in his fear.\r\n\r\nAgain there came a lull, and this time the beast-man leaped to his feet\r\nand dashed away into the forest. Nadara was alone.\r\n\r\nPresently the earth commenced to tremble again, and the voice of The\r\nGreat Nagoola rumbled across the world. Frightened animals scampered\r\npast Nadara, fleeing in all directions. Little deer, foxes, squirrels\r\nand other rodents in countless numbers scurried, terrified, about.\r\n\r\nA great black panther and his mate trotted shoulder to shoulder into\r\nthe glade where Nadara still stood too bewildered to know which way to\r\nfly.\r\n\r\nThey eyed her for a moment, as they paused in the moonlight, then\r\nwithout a second glance they loped away into the brush. Directly behind\r\nthem came three deer.\r\n\r\nNadara realized that she had felt no fear of the panthers as she would\r\nhave under ordinary circumstances. Even the little deer ran with their\r\nnatural enemies. Every lesser fear was submerged in the overwhelming\r\nterror of the earthquake.\r\n\r\nDawn was breaking in the east. The rumblings were diminishing, the\r\ntremors at greater intervals and of lessening violence.\r\n\r\nNadara started to retrace her steps toward the village. Momentarily she\r\nlooked to see Thandar coming in search of her, but she came to the edge\r\nof the forest and no sign of Thandar or another of her tribesmen had\r\ncome to cheer her.\r\n\r\nAt last she stepped into the open. Before her was the cliff. A cry\r\nof anguish broke from her lips at the sight that met her eyes. Torn,\r\ntortured and crumpled were the lofty crags that had been her home--the\r\nhome of the tribe of Thandar.\r\n\r\nThe overhanging cliff top had broken away and lay piled in a jagged\r\nheap at the foot of the cliff. The caves had disappeared. The ledges\r\nhad crumbled before the titanic struggles of The Great Nagoola. All was\r\ndesolation and ruin.\r\n\r\nShe approached more closely. Here and there in the awful jumble of\r\nshattered rock were wedged the crushed and mangled forms of men, women\r\nand children.\r\n\r\nTears coursed down Nadara's cheeks. Sobs wracked her slender figure.\r\nAnd Thandar! Where was he?\r\n\r\nWith utmost difficulty the girl picked her way aloft over the tumbled\r\ndebris. She could only guess at the former location of Thandar's cave,\r\nbut now no sign of cave remained--only the same blank waste of silent\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nFrantically she tugged and tore at massive heaps of sharp edged rock.\r\nHer fingers were cut and bruised and bleeding. She called aloud the\r\nname of her man, but there was no response.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon before, weak and exhausted, she gave up\r\nher futile search. That night she slept in a crevice between two broken\r\nboulders, and the next morning she set out in search of a cave where\r\nshe might live out the remainder of her lonely life in what safety and\r\nmeager comfort a lone girl could wring from this savage world.\r\n\r\nFor a week she wandered hither and thither only to find most of the\r\ncaves she had known in the past demolished as had been those of her\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAt last she stumbled upon the very cliff which Thandar had chosen as\r\nthe permanent home of his people. Here the wrath of the earthquake\r\nseemed to have been less severe, and Nadara found, high in the cliff's\r\nface, a safe and comfortable cavern.\r\n\r\nThe last span to it required the use of a slender sapling, which she\r\ncould draw up after her, effectually barring the approach of Nagoola\r\nand his people. To further protect herself against the chance of\r\nwandering men the girl carried a quantity of small bits of rock to the\r\nledge beside the entrance to her cave.\r\n\r\nFruit and nuts and vegetables she took there too, and a great gourd of\r\nwater from the spring below. As she completed her last trip, and sat\r\nresting upon the ledge, her eyes wandering over the landscape and out\r\nacross the distant ocean, she thought she saw something move in the\r\nshadow of the trees across the open plain beneath her.\r\n\r\nCould it have been a man? Nadara drew her sapling ladder to the ledge\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nThurg, fleeing from the wrath of The Great Nagoola, had come at\r\ndaybreak to the spot where his people had been camped, but there he\r\nfound no sign of them, only the ragged edges of a great fissure,\r\nhalf-closed, that might have swallowed his entire tribe as he had seen\r\nthe fissures in the forest swallow many, many trees at a single bite.\r\n\r\nFor some time he sought for signs of his tribesmen, but without\r\nsuccess. Then, his fear of the earthquake allayed, he started back into\r\nthe forest to find the girl. For days he sought her. He came to the\r\nruins of the cliff that had housed her people, and there he discovered\r\nsigns that the girl had been there since the demolition of the cliff.\r\n\r\nHe saw the print of her dainty feet in the soft earth at the base of\r\nthe rocks--he saw how she had searched the debris for Thandar--he saw\r\nher bed of grasses in the crevice between the two boulders, and then,\r\nafter diligent search, he found her spoor leading away to the east.\r\n\r\nFor many days he followed her until, at last, close by the sea, he come\r\nto a level plain at the edge of a forest. Across the narrow plain rose\r\nlofty cliffs--and what was that clambering aloft toward the dark mouth\r\nof a cave?\r\n\r\nCould it be a woman? Thurg's eyes narrowed as he peered intently toward\r\nthe cliff. Yes, it was a woman--it was _the_ woman--it was she he\r\nsought, and, she was alone.\r\n\r\nWith a whoop of exultation Thurg broke from the forest into the plain,\r\nrunning swiftly toward the cliff where Nadara crouched beside her\r\nlittle pile of jagged missiles, prepared to once more battle with this\r\nhideous monster for more than life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SEARCH\r\n\r\n\r\nA year had elapsed since Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones had departed from\r\nthe Back Bay home of his aristocratic parents to seek in a long sea\r\nvoyage a cure for the hacking cough and hectic cheeks which had in\r\nthemselves proclaimed the almost incurable.\r\n\r\nTwo months later had come the first meager press notices of the narrow\r\nescape of the steamer, upon which Waldo Emerson had been touring the\r\nsouth seas, from utter destruction by a huge tidal wave. The dispatch\r\nread:\r\n\r\n The captain reports that the great wave swept entirely over the\r\n steamer, momentarily submerging her. Two members of the crew, the\r\n officer upon the bridge, and one passenger were washed away.\r\n\r\n The latter was an American traveling for his health, Waldo E.\r\n Smith-Jones, son of John Alden Smith-Jones of Boston.\r\n\r\n The steamer came about, cruising back and forth for some time, but\r\n as the wave had washed her perilously close to a dangerous shore,\r\n it seemed unsafe to remain longer in the vicinity, for fear of\r\n a recurrence of the tidal wave which would have meant the utter\r\n annihilation of the vessel upon the nearby beach.\r\n\r\nNo sign of any of the poor unfortunates was seen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith-Jones is prostrated.\r\n\r\nImmediately John Alden Smith-Jones had fitted out his yacht,\r\n_Priscilla_, despatching her under Captain Burlinghame, a retired naval\r\nofficer, and an old friend of Mr. Smith-Jones, to the far distant coast\r\nin search of the body of his son, which the captain of the steamer was\r\nof the opinion might very possibly have been washed upon the beach.\r\n\r\nAnd now Burlinghame was back to report the failure of his mission.\r\nThe two men were sitting in the John Alden Smith-Jones library. Mrs.\r\nSmith-Jones was with them.\r\n\r\n\"We searched the beach diligently at the point opposite which the tidal\r\nwave struck the steamer,\" Captain Burlinghame was saying. \"For miles up\r\nand down the coast we patrolled every inch of the sand.\r\n\r\n\"We found, at one spot upon the edge of the jungle and above the beach,\r\nthe body of one of the sailors. It was not and could not have been\r\nWaldo's. The clothing was that of a seaman, the frame was much shorter\r\nand stockier than your son's. There was no sign of any other body along\r\nthat entire coast.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking it possible one of the men might have been washed ashore\r\nalive we sent parties into the interior. Here we found a wild and\r\nsavage country, and on two occasions met with fierce, white savages,\r\nwho hurled rocks at us and fled at the first report of our firearms.\r\n\r\n\"We continued our search all around the island, which is of\r\nconsiderable extent. Upon the east coast I found this,\" and here the\r\ncaptain handed Mr. Smith-Jones the bag of jewels which Nadara had\r\nforgotten as she fled from Thandar.\r\n\r\nBriefly he narrated what he knew of the history of the poor woman to\r\nwhom it had belonged.\r\n\r\n\"I recall the incident well,\" said Mrs. Smith-Jones, \"I had the\r\npleasure of entertaining the count and countess when they stopped here\r\nupon their honeymoon. They were lovely people, and to think that they\r\nmet so tragic an end!\"\r\n\r\nThe three lapsed into silence. Burlinghame did not know whether he was\r\nglad or sorry that he had not found the bones of Waldo Emerson--that\r\nwould have meant the end of hope for his parents. Perhaps much the same\r\nthoughts were running through the minds of the others.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the nether regions of the great house an electric bell\r\nsounded. Still the three sat on in silence. They heard the houseman\r\nopen the front door. They heard low voices, and presently there came a\r\ndeferential tap upon the door of the library.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith-Jones looked up and nodded. It was the houseman. He held a\r\nletter in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"What is it Krutz?\" asked the master in a tired voice. It seemed that\r\nnothing ever again would interest him.\r\n\r\n\"A special delivery letter, sir,\" replied the servant. \"The boy says\r\nyou must sign for it yourself, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" replied Mr. Smith-Jones, as he reached for the letter and\r\nthe receipt blank.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the post mark--San Francisco.\r\n\r\nIdly he cut the envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me?\" He glanced first at his wife and then at Captain\r\nBurlinghame.\r\n\r\nThe two nodded.\r\n\r\nMr. John Alden Smith-Jones opened the letter. There was a single\r\nwritten sheet and an enclosure in another envelope. He had read but a\r\ncouple of lines when he came suddenly upright in his chair.\r\n\r\nCaptain Burlinghame and Mrs. Smith-Jones looked at him in polite and\r\nsurprised questioning.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" exclaimed Mr. Smith-Jones. \"He is alive--Waldo is alive!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith-Jones and Captain Burlinghame sprang from their chairs and\r\nran toward the speaker.\r\n\r\nWith trembling hands that made it difficult to read the words that his\r\ntrembling voice could scarce utter John Alden Smith-Jones read aloud:\r\n\r\n _On board the Sally Corwith,\r\n San Francisco, California._\r\n\r\n _Mr. John Alden Smith-Jones,\r\n Boston, Mass._\r\n\r\n _Dear Sir: Just reached port and hasten to forward letter your son\r\n gave me for his mother. He wouldn't come with us. We found him on ----\r\n ----Island, Lat. 10° --\" South, Long. 150° --\" West. He seemed in\r\n good health and able to look out for himself. Didn't want anything,\r\n he said, except a razor, so we gave him that and one of the men gave\r\n him a plug of chewing tobacco. Urged him to come, but he wouldn't. The\r\n enclosed letter will doubtless tell you all about him._\r\n\r\n _Yours truly,\r\n Henry Dobbs, Master._\r\n\r\n\"Ten south, a hundred and fifty west,\" mused Captain Burlinghame.\r\n\"That's the same island we searched. Where could he have been!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith-Jones had opened the letter addressed to her, and was\r\nreading it breathlessly.\r\n\r\n _My dear Mother: I feel rather selfish in remaining and possibly\r\n causing you further anxiety, but I have certain duties to perform to\r\n several of the inhabitants which I feel obligated to fulfill before I\r\n depart._\r\n\r\n _My treatment here has been all that anyone might desire--even more, I\r\n might say._\r\n\r\n _The climate is delightful. My cough has left me, and I am entirely a\r\n well man--more robust than I ever recall having been in the past._\r\n\r\n _At present I am sojourning in the mountains, having but run down\r\n to the sea shore today, where, happily, I chanced to find the Sally\r\n Corwith in the harbor, and am taking advantage of Captain Dobbs'\r\n kindness to forward this letter to you._\r\n\r\n _Do not worry, dearest mother; my obligations will soon be fulfilled\r\n and then I shall hasten to take the first steamer for Boston._\r\n\r\n _I have met a number of interesting people here--the most interesting\r\n people I have ever met. They quite overwhelm one with their\r\n attentions._\r\n\r\n _And now, as Captain Dobbs is anxious to be away, I will close, with\r\n every assurance of my deepest love for you and father._\r\n\r\n _Ever affectionately your son,\r\n Waldo._\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith-Jones' eyes were dim with tears--tears of thanksgiving and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\"And to think,\" she exclaimed, \"that after all he is alive and\r\nwell--quite well. His cough has left him--that is the best part of it,\r\nand he is surrounded by interesting people--just what Waldo needed.\r\nFor some time I feared, before he sailed, that he was devoting himself\r\ntoo closely to his studies and to the little coterie of our own set\r\nwhich surrounded him. This experience will be broadening. Of course\r\nthese people may be slightly provincial, but it is evident that they\r\npossess a certain culture and refinement--otherwise my Waldo would\r\nnever have described them as 'interesting.' The coarse, illiterate, or\r\nvulgar could never prove 'interesting' to a Smith-Jones.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Cecil Burlinghame nodded politely--he was thinking of the\r\nnaked, hairy man-brutes he had seen within the interior of the island.\r\n\r\n\"It is evident, Burlinghame,\" said Mr. Smith-Jones, \"that you\r\noverlooked a portion of this island. It would seem, from Waldo's\r\nletter, that there must be a colony of civilized men and women\r\nsomewhere upon it. Of course it is possible that it may be further\r\ninland than you penetrated.\"\r\n\r\nBurlinghame shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I am puzzled,\" he said. \"We circled the entire coast, yet nowhere did\r\nwe see any evidence of a man-improved harbor, such as one might have\r\nreason to expect were there really a colony of advanced humans in the\r\ninterior. There would have been at least a shack near the beach in one\r\nof the several natural harbors which indent the coast line was there\r\neven an occasional steamer touching for purposes of commerce with the\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\n\"No, my friends,\" he continued, \"as much as I should like to believe\r\nit my judgment will not permit me to place any such translation upon\r\nWaldo's letter.\r\n\r\n\"That he is safe and happy seems evident, and that is enough for us to\r\nknow. Now it should be a simple matter for us to find him--if it is\r\nstill your desire to send for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may already have left for Boston,\" said Mrs. Smith-Jones; \"his\r\nletter was written several months ago.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Burlinghame shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Do not bank on that, my dear madam,\" he said kindly. \"It may be fifty\r\nyears before another vessel touches that forgotten shore--unless it be\r\none which you yourselves send.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Alden Smith-Jones sprang to his feet, and commenced pacing up and\r\ndown the library.\r\n\r\n\"How soon can the _Priscilla_ be put in shape to make the return voyage\r\nto the island?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It _can_ be done in a week, if necessary,\" replied Burlinghame.\r\n\r\n\"And you will accompany her, in command?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gladly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Mr. Smith-Jones. \"And now, my friend, let us lose no\r\ntime in starting our preparations. I intend accompanying you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I shall go too,\" said Mrs. Smith-Jones.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at her in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"But my dear!\" cried her husband, \"there is no telling what hardships\r\nand dangers we may encounter--you could never stand such a trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going,\" said Mrs. Smith-Jones, firmly. \"I know my Waldo. I know\r\nhis refined and sensitive nature. I know that I am fully capable of\r\nenduring whatever he may have endured. He tells me that he is among\r\ninteresting people. Evidently there is nothing to fear, then, from\r\nthe inhabitants of the island, and furthermore I wish personally to\r\nmeet the people he has been living with. I have always been careful\r\nto surround Waldo with only the nicest people, and if any vulgarizing\r\ninfluences have been brought to bear upon him since he has been beyond\r\nmy mature guidance I wish to know it, that I may determine how to\r\ncombat their results.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the end of it. If Mrs. Smith-Jones knew her son, Mr.\r\nSmith-Jones certainly knew his wife.\r\n\r\nA week later the _Priscilla_ sailed from Boston harbor on her long\r\njourney around the Horn to the south seas.\r\n\r\nMost of the old crew had been retained. The first and second officers\r\nwere new men. The former, William Stark, had come to Burlinghame well\r\nrecommended. From the first he seemed an intelligent and experienced\r\nofficer. That he was inclined to taciturnity but enhanced his value\r\nin the eyes of Burlinghame. Stark was inclined to be something of a\r\nmartinet, so that the crew soon took to hating him cordially, but as\r\nhis display of this unpleasant trait was confined wholly to trivial\r\nacts the men contented themselves with grumbling among themselves,\r\nwhich is the prerogative and pleasure of every good sailorman. Their\r\nloyalty to the splendid Burlinghame, however, was not to be shaken by\r\neven a dozen Starks.\r\n\r\nThe monotonous and uneventful journey to the vicinity of ten south\r\nand a hundred and fifty west was finally terminated. At last land\r\nshowed on the starboard bow. Excitement reigned supreme throughout the\r\ntrim, white _Priscilla_. Mrs. Smith-Jones peered anxiously and almost\r\nconstantly through her binoculars, momentarily expecting to see the\r\nwell-known thin and emaciated figure of her Waldo Emerson standing upon\r\nthe beach awaiting them.\r\n\r\nFor two weeks they sailed along the coast, stopping here and there for\r\na day while parties tramped inland in search of signs of civilized\r\nhabitation. They lay two days in the harbor where the _Sally Corwith_\r\nhad lain. There they pressed farther inland than at any other point,\r\nbut all without avail. It was Burlinghame's plan to first make a\r\ncursory survey of the entire coast, with only short incursions toward\r\nthe center of the island. Should this fail to discover the missing\r\nWaldo the party was then to go over the ground once more, remaining\r\nweeks or months as might be required to thoroughly explore every foot\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\nIt was during the pursuit of the initial portion of the program that\r\nthey dropped anchor in the self-same harbor upon whose waters Waldo\r\nEmerson and Nadara had seen the _Priscilla_ lying, only to fly from her.\r\n\r\nBurlinghame recalled it as the spot at which the bag of jewels had been\r\npicked up. Next to the Sally Corwith harbor, as they had come to call\r\nthe other anchorage, this seemed most fraught with possibilities of\r\nsuccess. They christened it Eugenie Bay, after that poor, unfortunate\r\nlady, Eugenie Marie Celeste de la Valois, Countess of Crecy, whose\r\njewels had been recovered upon its shore.\r\n\r\nBurlinghame and Waldo's father with half a dozen officers and men of\r\nthe _Priscilla_ had spent the day searching the woods, the plain and\r\nthe hills for some slight sign of human habitation. Shortly after noon\r\nFirst Officer Stark stumbled upon the whitened skeleton of a man. In\r\nanswer to his shouts the other members of the party hastened to his\r\nside. They found the grim thing lying in a little barren spot among\r\nthe tall grasses. About it the liquids of decomposition had killed\r\nvegetation leaving the thing alone in all its grisly repulsiveness as\r\nthough shocked, nature had withdrawn in terror.\r\n\r\nStark stood pointing toward it without a word as the others came up.\r\nBurlinghame was the first to reach Stark's side. He bent low over\r\nthe bones examining the skull carefully. John Alden Smith-Jones came\r\npanting up. Instantly he saw what Burlinghame was examining he turned\r\ndeathly white. Burlinghame looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\"It's not,\" he said. \"Look at that skull--either a gorilla or some very\r\nlow type of man.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith-Jones breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"What an awful creature it must have been,\" he said, when he had fully\r\ntaken in the immense breadth of the squat skeleton. \"It cannot be that\r\nWaldo has survived in a wilderness peopled by such creatures as this.\r\nImagine him confronted by such a beast. Timid by nature and never\r\nrobust he would have perished of fright at the very sight of this thing\r\ncharging down upon him.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Cecil Burlinghame acquiesced with a nod. He knew Waldo Emerson\r\nwell, and so he could not even imagine a meeting between the frail and\r\ncowardly youth and such a beast as this bleaching frame must once have\r\nsupported. And at their feet the bones of Flatfoot lay mute witnesses\r\nto the impossible.\r\n\r\nPresently a shout from one of the sailors attracted their attention\r\ntoward the far side of the valley. The man was standing upon a rise of\r\nground waving his arms and gesticulating violently toward the lofty\r\ncliffs which rose sheer from the rank jungle grasses. All eyes turned\r\nin the direction indicated by the excited sailor. At first they saw\r\nnothing, but presently a figure came in sight upon a little elevation.\r\nIt was the figure of a human being, and even at the distance they were\r\nfrom it all were assured that it was the figure of a female. She was\r\nrunning toward the cliffs with the speed of a deer. And now behind her,\r\ncame another figure. Thick set and squat was the thing that pursued the\r\nwoman. It might have been the reanimated skeleton that they had just\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nWould the creature catch her before she reached the cliff? Would she\r\nfind sanctuary even there? Already Burlinghame and Stark had started\r\ntoward the cliff on a run. John Alden Smith-Jones followed more slowly.\r\nThe men raced after their officers.\r\n\r\nThe girl had reached the rocks and was scampering up their precipitous\r\nface like a squirrel. Close behind her came the man. They saw the girl\r\nreach a ledge just below the mouth of a cave in which she evidently\r\nexpected to find safety. They saw her clambering up the rickety sapling\r\nthat answered for a ladder. They breathed sighs of relief, for it\r\nseemed that she was now quite safe--the man was still one ledge below\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut in another moment the watchers were filled with horror. The brute\r\npursuing her had reached forth a giant hand and seized the base of the\r\nsapling. He was dragging it over the edge of the cliff. In another\r\nmoment the girl would be precipitated either into his arms or to a\r\nhorrible death upon the jagged rocks beneath her.\r\n\r\nBurlinghame and Stark halted simultaneously. At once two rifles leaped\r\nto their shoulders. There were two reports, so close together that they\r\nseemed as one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFIRST MATE STARK\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the day that Thurg discovered Nadara he had come racing to the\r\nfoot of the cliff, roaring and bellowing like a mad bull. Upward he\r\nclambered half the distance to the girl's lofty perch. Then a bit of\r\njagged rock, well aimed, had brought him to a sudden halt, spitting\r\nblood and teeth from his injured mouth. He looked up at Nadara and\r\nshrieked out his rage and his threats of vengeance. Nadara launched\r\nanother missile at him that caught him full upon one eye, dropping\r\nhim like a stone to the narrow ledge upon which he had been standing.\r\nQuickly the girl started to descend to his side to finish the work she\r\nhad commenced, for she knew that there could be no peace or safety for\r\nher, now that Thurg had discovered her hiding place, while the monster\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nBut she had scarce more than lowered her sapling to the ledge beneath\r\nher when the giant form of the man moved and Thurg sat up. Quickly\r\nNadara clambered back to her ledge, again drawing her sapling after\r\nher. She was about to hurl another missile at the man when he spoke to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"We are alone in the world,\" he said. \"All your people and all my\r\npeople have been slain by the Great Nagoola. Come down. Let us live\r\ntogether in peace. There is no other left in all the world.\"\r\n\r\nNadara laughed at him.\r\n\r\n\"Come down to you!\" she cried, mockingly. \"Live with you! I would\r\nrather live with the pigs that root in the forest. Go away, or I will\r\nfinish what I have commenced, and kill you. I would not live with you\r\nthough I knew that you were the last human being on earth.\"\r\n\r\nThurg pleaded and threatened, but all to no avail. Again he tried\r\nto clamber to her side, but again he was repulsed with well-aimed\r\nmissiles. At last he withdrew, growling and threatening.\r\n\r\nFor weeks he haunted the vicinity of the cliff. Nadara's meager food\r\nsupply was soon exhausted. She was forced to descend to replenish her\r\nlarder and fill her gourd, or die of starvation and thirst. She made\r\nher trips to the forest at night, though black Nagoola prowled and the\r\nmenace of Thurg loomed through the darkness. At last the man discovered\r\nher in one of these nocturnal expeditions and almost caught her before\r\nshe reached her ledge of safety.\r\n\r\nFor three days he kept her a close prisoner. Again her stock of\r\nprovisions was exhausted. She was desperate. Twice had Nagoola nearly\r\ntrapped her in the forest. She dared not again tempt fate in the\r\ngloomy wood by night. There was nothing left but to risk all in one\r\nlast effort to elude Thurg by day and find another asylum in some far\r\ndistant corner of the island.\r\n\r\nCarefully she watched her opportunity, and while the beast-man was\r\ntemporarily absent seeking food for himself the girl slid swiftly to\r\nthe base of the cliff and started through the tall grasses for the\r\nopposite side of the valley.\r\n\r\nUpon this day Thurg had fallen upon the spoor of deer as he had\r\nsearched the forest for certain berries that were in season and which\r\nhe particularly enjoyed. The trail led along the edge of the wood to\r\nthe opposite side of the valley, and over the hills into the region\r\nbeyond. All day Thurg followed the fleet animals, until at last not\r\nhaving come up with them he was forced to give up the pursuit and\r\nreturn to the cliffs, lest his more valuable quarry should escape.\r\n\r\nHalf-way between the hills and the cliff he came suddenly face to\r\nface with Nadara. Not twenty paces separated them. With a howl of\r\nsatisfaction Thurg leaped to seize her, but she turned and fled before\r\nhe could lay his hand upon her. If Thurg had found his other quarry of\r\nthat day swift, so, too, he now found Nadara, for terror gave wings\r\nto her flying feet. Lumbering after her came Thurg, and had the\r\ndistance been less he would have been left far behind, but it was a\r\nlong distance from the spot, where they had met, to Nadara's cliffs.\r\nThe girl could out-run the man for a short distance, but when victory\r\ndepended upon endurance the advantage was all upon the side of the\r\nbrute.\r\n\r\nAs they neared the goal Nadara realized that the lead she had gained\r\nat first was rapidly being overcome by the horrid creature panting so\r\nclose behind her. She strained every nerve and muscle in a last mad\r\neffort to distance the fate that was closing upon her. She reached\r\nthe cliff. Thurg was just behind her. Half spent, she stumbled upward\r\nin, what seemed to her, pitiful slowness. At last her hand grasped\r\nthe sapling that led to the mouth of her cave--in another instant she\r\nwould be safe. But her new-born hope went out as she felt the sapling\r\nslipping and glanced downward to see Thurg dragging it from its\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nShe shut her eyes that she might not see the depths below into which\r\nshe was about to be hurled, and then there smote upon her ears the most\r\nterrific burst of sound that had ever assailed them, other than the\r\nthunders that rolled down out of the heavens when the rains came. But\r\nthis sound did not come from above--it came from the valley beneath.\r\n\r\nThe ladder ceased to slip. She opened her eyes and glanced downward.\r\nFar below her lay the body of Thurg. She could see that he was quite\r\ndead. He lay upon his face and from his back trickled two tiny streams\r\nof blood from little holes.\r\n\r\nNadara clambered upward to her ledge, drawing her sapling after her,\r\nand then she looked about for an explanation of the strange noise and\r\nthe sudden death of Thurg, for she could not but connect the one with\r\nthe other. Below, in the valley, she saw a number of men strangely\r\ngarbed. They were coming toward her cliff. She gathered her missiles\r\nclosely about her, ready to her hand. Now they were below and calling\r\nup to her. Her eyes dilated in wonder--they spoke the strange tongue\r\nthat Thandar had tried to teach her. She called down to them in her own\r\ntongue, but they shook their heads, motioning her to descend. She was\r\nafraid. All her life she had been afraid of men, and with reason--of\r\nall except her old foster father and Thandar. These, evidently, were\r\nmen. She could only expect from them the same treatment that Thurg\r\nwould have accorded her.\r\n\r\nOne of them had started up the face of the cliff. It was Stark. Nadara\r\nseized a bit of rock and hurled it down upon him. He barely dodged\r\nthe missile, but he desisted in his attempt to ascend to her. Now\r\nBurlinghame advanced, raising his hand, palm toward her in sign that\r\nshe should not assault him. She recalled some of the language that\r\nThandar had taught her--maybe they would understand it.\r\n\r\n\"Go-way!\" she cried. \"Go-way! Nadara kill bad-men.\"\r\n\r\nA look of pleasure overspread Burlinghame's face--the girl spoke\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\"We are not bad men,\" he called up to her. \"We will not harm you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you want?\" asked Nadara, still unconvinced by mere words.\r\n\r\n\"We want to talk with you,\" replied Burlinghame. \"We are looking for a\r\nfriend who was ship-wrecked upon this island. Come down. We will not\r\nharm you. Have we not already proved our friendship by killing this\r\nfellow who pursued you?\"\r\n\r\nThis man spoke precisely the tongue of Thandar. Nadara could understand\r\nevery word, for Thandar had talked to her much in English. She could\r\nunderstand it better than she could speak it. If they talked the same\r\ntongue as Thandar they must be from the same country. Maybe they were\r\nThandar's friends. Anyway they were like him, and Thandar never harmed\r\nwomen. She could trust them. Slowly she lowered her sapling and began\r\nthe descent. Several times she hesitated as though minded to return to\r\nher ledge, but Burlinghame's kindly voice and encouragement at last\r\nprevailed, and presently Nadara stood before them.\r\n\r\nThe officers and men of the _Priscilla_ crowded around the girl. They\r\nwere struck with her beauty, and the simple dignity of her manner and\r\nher carriage. The great black panther skin that fell from her left\r\nshoulder she wore with the majesty of a queen and with a naturalness\r\nthat cast no reflection upon her modesty, though it revealed quite\r\nas much of her figure as it hid. William Stark, first officer of the\r\n_Priscilla_, caught his breath--never, he was positive, had God made a\r\nmore lovely creature.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the cliff a shaggy man peered down upon the strange\r\nscene. He blinked his little eyes, scratched his matted head, and once\r\nhe picked up a large stone that lay near him; but he did not hurl it\r\nupon those below, for he had heard the loud report of the rifles,\r\nseen the smoke belch from the muzzles, and witnessed the sudden and\r\nmiraculous collapse of Thurg.\r\n\r\nBurlinghame was speaking to Nadara.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nadara,\" replied the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you live?\"\r\n\r\nNadara jerked her thumb over her shoulder toward the cliff at her back.\r\nBurlinghame searched the rocky escarpment with his eyes, but saw no\r\nsign of another living being there.\r\n\r\n\"Where are your people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"All of them?\"\r\n\r\nNadara nodded affirmatively.\r\n\r\n\"How long have they been dead and what killed them?\" continued\r\nBurlinghame.\r\n\r\n\"Almost a moon. The Great Nagoola killed them.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to other questions Nadara related all that had transpired\r\nsince the night of the earthquake. Her description of the catastrophe\r\nconvinced the Americans that a violent quake had recently occurred to\r\nshake the island to its foundations.\r\n\r\n\"Ask her about Waldo,\" whispered Mr. Smith-Jones, himself dreading to\r\nput the question.\r\n\r\n\"We are looking for a young man,\" said Burlinghame, \"who was lost\r\noverboard from a steamer on the west coast of this island. We know\r\nthat he reached the shore alive, for we have heard from him. Have\r\nyou ever seen or heard of this stranger? His name is Waldo Emerson\r\nSmith-Jones--this gentleman is his father,\" indicating Mr. Smith-Jones.\r\n\r\nNadara looked with wide eyes at John Alden Smith-Jones. So this man was\r\nThandar's father. She felt very sorry for him, for she knew that he\r\nloved Thandar--Thandar had often told her so. She did not know how to\r\ntell him--she shrank from causing another the anguish and misery that\r\nshe had endured.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know of him?\" asked Burlinghame.\r\n\r\nNadara nodded her head.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" cried Waldo's father. \"Where are the people with whom he\r\nlived here?\"\r\n\r\nNadara came close to John Alden Smith-Jones. There was no fear in her\r\ninnocent young heart for this man who was Thandar's father--who loved\r\nThandar--only a great compassion for him in the sorrow that she was\r\nabout to inflict. Gently she took his hand in hers, raising her sad\r\neyes to his.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he? Where is my boy?\" whispered Mr. Smith-Jones.\r\n\r\n\"He is with his people, who were my people--the people of whom I have\r\njust told you,\" replied Nadara softly-- \"He is dead.\" And then she\r\ndropped her face upon the man's hand and wept.\r\n\r\nThe shock staggered John Alden Smith-Jones. It seemed\r\nincredible--impossible--that Waldo could have lived through all that he\r\nmust have lived through to perish at last but a few short weeks before\r\nsuccor reached him. For a moment he forgot the girl. It was her hot\r\ntears upon his hand that aroused him to a consciousness of the present.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you weep?\" he cried almost roughly.\r\n\r\n\"For you,\" she replied, \"who loved him, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"You loved Waldo?\" asked the boy's father.\r\n\r\nNadara nodded her tumbled mass of raven hair. John Alden Smith-Jones\r\nlooked down upon the bent head of the sobbing girl in silence for\r\nseveral minutes. Many things were racing through his patrician brain.\r\nHe was by training, environment and heredity narrow and Puritanical.\r\nHe saw the meager apparel of the girl--he saw her nut brown skin; but\r\nhe did not see her nakedness, for something in his heart told him that\r\nsweet virtue clothed her more effectually than could silks and satins\r\nwithout virtue. Gently he placed an arm about her, drawing her to him.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter,\" he said, and pressed his lips to her forehead.\r\n\r\nIt was a solemn and sorrow-ridden party that boarded the _Priscilla_\r\nan hour later. Mrs. Smith-Jones had seen them coming. Some intuitive\r\nsense may have warned her of the sorrow that lay in store for her upon\r\ntheir return. At any rate she did not meet them at the rail as in the\r\npast, instead she retired to her cabin to await her husband there.\r\nWhen he joined her he brought with him a half-naked young woman. Mrs.\r\nSmith-Jones looked upon the girl with ill concealed horror.\r\n\r\nWaldo's mother met the shock of her husband's news with much greater\r\nfortitude than he had expected. As a matter of fact she had been\r\nprepared for this from the first. She had never really believed that\r\nWaldo could survive for any considerable time far from the comforts and\r\nluxuries of his Boston home and the watchful care of herself.\r\n\r\n\"And who is this--ah--person?\" she asked coldly at last, holding her\r\npince-nez before her eyes as with elevated brows she cast a look of\r\ndisapproval upon Nadara.\r\n\r\nThe girl, reading more in the older woman's manner than her words, drew\r\nherself up proudly. Mr. Smith-Jones coughed and colored. He stepped to\r\nNadara's side, placing his arm about her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"She loved Waldo,\" he said simply.\r\n\r\n\"The brazen huzzy!\" exclaimed Mrs. Smith-Jones. \"To dare to love a\r\nSmith-Jones!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Louisa!\" ejaculated her husband. \"Remember that she too is\r\nsuffering--do not add to her sorrow. She loved our boy, and he returned\r\nher love.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has told me,\" replied the man.\r\n\r\n\"It is not true,\" cried Mrs. Smith-Jones. \"It is not true! Waldo\r\nEmerson would never stoop to love one out of his own high class. Who is\r\nshe, and what proof have you that Waldo loved her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Nadara,\" said the girl proudly, answering for herself, \"and this\r\nis the proof that he loved me. He told me that this was the pledge\r\ntoken between us until we could come to his land and be mated according\r\nto the customs there.\" She held out her left hand, upon the third\r\nfinger of which sparkled a great solitaire--a solitaire which Mrs. John\r\nAlden Smith-Jones recognized instantly.\r\n\r\n\"He gave you that?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nThen she turned toward her husband.\r\n\r\n\"What do you intend doing with this girl?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I shall take her back home,\" replied he. \"She should be as a daughter\r\nto us, for Waldo would have made her such had he lived. She cannot\r\nremain upon the island. All her people were killed by the earthquake\r\nthat destroyed Waldo. She is in constant danger of attack by wild\r\nbeasts and wilder men. We cannot leave her here, and even if we could I\r\nshould not do so, for we owe a duty to our dead boy to care for her as\r\nhe would have cared for her--and we owe a greater duty to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must be alone,\" was all that Mrs. Smith-Jones replied. \"Please take\r\nher away, John. Give her the cabin next to this, and have Marie clothe\r\nher properly--Marie's clothes should about fit her.\" There was more of\r\ntired anguish in her voice now than of anger.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith-Jones led Nadara out and summoned Marie, but Nadara upset his\r\nplans by announcing that she wished to return to shore.\r\n\r\n\"She does not like me,\" she said, nodding toward Mrs. Smith-Jones's\r\ncabin, \"and I will not stay.\"\r\n\r\nIt took John Alden Smith-Jones a long time to persuade the girl to\r\nchange her mind. He pointed out that his wife was greatly over-wrought\r\nby the shock of the news of Waldo's death. He assured Nadara that at\r\nheart she was a kindly woman, and that eventually she would regret\r\nher attitude toward the girl. And at last Nadara consented to remain\r\naboard the _Priscilla_. But when Marie would have clothed her in the\r\ngarments of civilization she absolutely refused--scorning the hideous\r\nand uncomfortable clothing.\r\n\r\nIt was two days before Mrs. Smith-Jones sent for her. When she entered\r\nthat lady's cabin the latter exclaimed at once against her barbarous\r\nattire.\r\n\r\n\"I gave instructions that Marie should dress you properly,\" she said.\r\n\"You are not decently clothed--that bear skin is shocking.\"\r\n\r\nNadara tossed her head, and her eyes flashed fire.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never wear your silly clothes,\" she cried. \"This, Thandar gave\r\nme--he slew Nagoola, the black panther, with his own hands, and gave\r\nthe skin to me who was to be his mate--do you think I would exchange\r\nit for such foolish garments as those?\" and she waved a contemptuous\r\ngesture toward Mrs. Smith-Jones's expensive morning gown.\r\n\r\nThe elder woman forgot her outraged dignity in the suggestion the girl\r\nhad given her for an excuse to be rid of her at the first opportunity.\r\nShe had mentioned a party named Thandar. She had brazenly boasted that\r\nthis Thandar had killed the beast whose pelt she wore and given her\r\nthe thing for a garment. She had admitted that she was to become this\r\nperson's \"mate.\" Mrs. Smith-Jones shuddered at the primitive word. At\r\nthis moment Mr. Smith-Jones entered the cabin. He smiled pleasantly at\r\nNadara, and then, seeing in the attitudes of the two women that he had\r\nstepped within a theater of war, he looked questioningly at his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Now what, Louisa?\" he asked, somewhat sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Sufficient, John,\" exclaimed that lady, \"to bear out my original\r\ncontention that it was a very unwise move to bring this woman with\r\nus--she has just admitted that she was the promised 'mate' of a person\r\nshe calls Thandar. She is brazen--I refuse to permit her to enter\r\nmy home; nor shall she remain upon the _Priscilla_ longer than is\r\nnecessary to land her at the first civilized port.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith-Jones looked questioningly at Nadara. The girl had guessed\r\nthe erroneous reasoning that had caused Mrs. Smith-Jones's excitement.\r\nShe had forgotten that they did not know that Waldo and Thandar were\r\none. Now she could scarce repress a smile of amusement nor resist the\r\ntemptation to take advantage of Mrs. Smith-Jones's ignorance to bait\r\nher further.\r\n\r\n\"You had another lover beside Waldo?\" asked Mr. Smith-Jones.\r\n\r\n\"I loved Thandar,\" she replied. \"Thandar was king of my people. He\r\nloved me. He slew Nagoola for me and gave me his skin. He slew Korth\r\nand Flatfoot, also. They wanted me, but Thandar slew them. And Big Fist\r\nhe slew, and Sag the Killer--oh, Thandar was a mighty fighter. Can you\r\nwonder that I loved him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a hideous murderer!\" cried Mrs. Smith-Jones, \"and to think that\r\nmy poor Waldo; poor, timid, gentle Waldo, was condemned to live among\r\nsuch savage brutes. Oh, it is too terrible!\"\r\n\r\nNadara's eyes went wide. It was her turn to suffer a shock. \"Poor,\r\ntimid, gentle Waldo!\" Had she heard aright? Could it be that they were\r\ndescribing the same man? There must be some mistake.\r\n\r\n\"Did Waldo know that you loved Thandar?\" asked Mr. Smith-Jones.\r\n\r\n\"Thandar was Waldo,\" she replied. \"Thandar is the name I gave him--it\r\nmeans the Brave One. He was very brave,\" she cried. \"He was not\r\n'timid,' and he was only 'gentle' with women and children.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith-Jones had never been so shocked in all her life. She sprang\r\nto her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Leave my cabin!\" she cried. \"I see through your shallow deception.\r\nYou thoughtlessly betrayed yourself and your vulgar immoralities, and\r\nnow you try to hide behind a base calumny that pictures my dear, dead\r\nboy as one with your hideous, brutal chief. You shall not deceive me\r\nlonger. Leave my cabin, please!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith-Jones stood as one paralyzed. He could not believe in the\r\nperfidy of the girl--it seemed impossible that she could have so\r\ndeceived him--nor yet could he question the integrity of his own ears.\r\nIt was, of course, too far beyond the pale of reason to attempt to\r\nbelieve that Waldo Emerson and the terrible Thandar were one and the\r\nsame. The girl had gone too far, and yet he could not believe that she\r\nwas bad. There must be some explanation.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Nadara had left the room, her little chin high in air.\r\nNever again, she determined, would she subject herself to the insults\r\nof Thandar's mother. She went on deck. She had found it difficult\r\nto remain below during the day. She craved the fresh air, and the\r\nexcitement to be found above. The officers had been very nice to\r\nher. Stark was much with her. The man had fallen desperately in love\r\nwith the half-savage girl. As she reached the deck after leaving Mrs.\r\nSmith-Jones's cabin Stark was the first she chanced to meet. She would\r\nhave preferred being alone with her sorrow and her anger, but the man\r\njoined her. Together they stood by the rail watching the approach\r\nof heavy clouds. A storm was about to break over them that had been\r\nbrewing for several days.\r\n\r\nStark knew nothing of what had taken place below, but he saw that the\r\ngirl was unhappy. He attempted to cheer her. At last he took her hand\r\nand stroked it caressingly as he talked with her. Before she could\r\nguess his intention he was pouring words of love and passion into her\r\nears. Nadara drew away. A puzzled frown contracted her brows.\r\n\r\n\"Do not talk so to Nadara,\" she said. \"She does not love you.\" And then\r\nshe moved away and went to her cabin.\r\n\r\nStark looked after her as she departed. He was thoroughly aroused. Who\r\nwas this savage girl, to repulse him? What would have been her fate but\r\nfor his well-directed shot? Was not the man who had been pursuing her\r\nbut acting after the customs of her wild people? He would have taken\r\nher by force. That was the only way she would have been taken had she\r\nbeen left upon her own island. That was the only kind of betrothal she\r\nknew. It was what she expected. He had been a fool to approach her with\r\nthe soft words of civilization. They had made her despise him. She\r\nwould have understood force, and loved him for it. Well, he would show\r\nher that he could be as primitive as any of her savage lovers.\r\n\r\nThe storm broke. The wind became a hurricane. The _Priscilla_ was\r\nforced to turn and flee before the anger of the elements, so that she\r\nretraced her course of the past two days and then was blown to the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nStark saw nothing of Nadara during this period. At the end of\r\nthirty-six hours the wind had died and the sea was settling to its\r\nnormal quiet. It was the first evening after the storm. The deck of the\r\n_Priscilla_ was almost deserted. The yacht was moving slowly along not\r\nfar off the shore of one of the many islands that dot that part of the\r\nsouth seas.\r\n\r\nNadara came on deck for a walk before retiring. Stark and two sailors\r\nwere on watch. At sight of the girl the first officer approached\r\nher. He spoke pleasantly as though nothing had occurred to mar their\r\nfriendly relations. He talked of the storm and pointed out the black\r\noutlines of the nearby shore, and as he talked he led her toward the\r\nstern, out of sight of the sailors forward.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he turned upon her and grasped her in his arms. With brutal\r\nforce he crushed her to him, covering her face with kisses. She fought\r\nto free herself, but Stark was a strong man. Slowly he forced her to\r\nthe deck. She beat him in the face and upon the breast, and at last, in\r\nthe extreme of desperation, she screamed for help. Instantly he struck\r\nher a heavy blow upon the jaw. The slender form of the girl relaxed\r\nupon the deck in unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nNow Stark came to a sudden realization of the gravity of the thing he\r\nhad done. He knew that when Nadara regained consciousness his perfidy\r\nwould come to the attention of Captain Burlinghame, and he feared the\r\nquiet, ex-naval officer more than he did the devil. He looked over the\r\nrail. It would be an easy thing to dispose of the girl. He had only to\r\ndrop her unconscious body into the still waters below. He raised her in\r\nhis arms and bore her to the rail. The moon shone down upon her face.\r\nHe looked out over the water and saw the shore so close at hand.\r\n\r\nThere would be a thorough investigation and the sailors, who had no\r\nlove for him, as he well knew, would lose no time in reporting that he\r\nhad been the last to be seen with the girl. Evidently he was in for\r\nit, one way or the other.\r\n\r\nAgain he looked down into Nadara's face. She was very beautiful. He\r\nwanted her badly. Slowly his glance wandered to the calm waters of the\r\nocean and on to the quiet shore line. Then back to the girl. For a\r\nmoment he stood irresolute. Then he stepped to the side of the cabin\r\nwhere hung a life preserver to which was attached a long line.\r\n\r\nHe put the life preserver about Nadara. Then he lowered her into the\r\nocean. The moment he felt her weight transferred from the lowering rope\r\nto the life preserver he vaulted over the yacht's rail into the dark\r\nwaters beneath her stern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE WILD MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nNadara did not regain consciousness until Stark had reached shore\r\nand was dragging her out upon the beach above the surf. For several\r\nminutes after she had opened her eyes she had difficulty in recalling\r\nthe events that had immediately preceded Stark's attack upon her. She\r\nfelt the life belt still about her, and as Stark stooped above her to\r\nremove it she knew that it was he though she could not distinguish his\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened? Slowly a realization of the man's bold act forced\r\nitself upon her--he had leaped overboard from the _Priscilla_ and swam\r\nashore with her rather than face the consequences of his brutal conduct\r\ntoward her.\r\n\r\nTo a girl reared within the protective influences of civilization\r\nNadara's position would have seemed hopeless; but Nadara knew naught\r\nof other protection than that afforded by her own quick wits and\r\nthe agility of her swift young muscles. To her it would have seemed\r\ninfinitely more appalling to have been confined within the narrow\r\nlimits of the yacht with this man, for there all was strange and new.\r\nShe still had half feared and mistrusted all aboard the _Priscilla_\r\nexcept Thandar's father and Captain Burlinghame; but would they have\r\nprotected her from Stark? She did not know. Among her own people only\r\na father, brother, or mate protected a woman from one who sought her\r\nagainst her will, and of these she had none upon the little vessel.\r\n\r\nBut now it was different. Intuitively she knew that upon a savage\r\nshore, however strange and unfamiliar it might be, she would have\r\nevery advantage over the first officer of the _Priscilla_. His life\r\nhad been spent close to the haunts of civilization; he knew nothing\r\nof the woodcraft that was second nature to her; he might perish in\r\na land of plenty through ignorance of where to search for food, and\r\nof what was edible and what was not. This much her early experience\r\nwith Waldo Emerson had taught her. When their paths first had crossed\r\nWaldo had been as ignorant as a new-born babe in the craft of life\r\nprimeval--Nadara had had to teach him everything.\r\n\r\nBehind them Nadara heard the gentle soughing of trees--the myriad\r\nnoises of the teeming jungle night--and she smiled. It was inky black\r\nabout them. Stark had removed the life belt and placed it beneath the\r\ngirl's head. He thought her still unconscious--perhaps dead. Now he was\r\nwringing the water from his clothes; his back toward her.\r\n\r\nNadara rose to her feet--noiseless as Nagoola. Like a shadow she melted\r\ninto the blackness of the jungle that fringed the shore. Careful and\r\nalert, she picked her way within the tangled mass for a few yards. At\r\nthe hole of a large tree she halted, listening. Then she made a low,\r\nweird sound with her lips, listening again for a moment after. This\r\nshe repeated thrice, and then, seemingly satisfied that no danger\r\nlurked above she swung herself into the low-hanging branches, quickly\r\nascending until she found a comfortable seat where she might rest in\r\nease.\r\n\r\nDown upon the beach Stark, having wrung the surplus water from his\r\ngarments, turned to examine and revive the girl, if she still lived.\r\nEven in the darkness her form had been plainly visible against the\r\nyellow sand, but now she was not there. Stark was dumfounded. His\r\neyes leaped quickly from one point to another, yet nowhere could they\r\ndiscover the girl. There was the beach, the sea and the jungle. Which\r\nhad she chosen for her flight? It did not take Stark long to guess, and\r\nimmediately he turned his steps toward the shapeless, gloomy mass that\r\nmarked the forest's fringe.\r\n\r\nAs he approached he went more slowly. The thought of entering that\r\nforbidding wood sent cold shivers creeping through him. Could a mere\r\ngirl have dared its nameless horrors? She must have, and with the\r\ndecision came new resolution. What a girl had dared certainly he might\r\ndare. Again he strode briskly toward the jungle.\r\n\r\nJust at its verge he heard a low, weird sound not a dozen paces\r\nwithin the black, hideous tangle. It was Nadara voicing the two notes\r\nwhich some ancient forbear of her tribe had discovered would wring\r\nan answering growl from Nagoola, and an uneasy hiss from that other\r\narch enemy of man--the great, slimy serpent whose sinuous coils twined\r\nthreateningly above them in the branches of the trees. Only these\r\nNadara feared--these and man. So, before entering a tree at night it\r\nwas her custom to assure herself that neither Nagoola nor Coovra lurked\r\nin the branches of the tree she had chosen for sanctuary. Stark beat\r\na hasty retreat, nor did he again venture from the beach during the\r\nbalance of the long, dismal night.\r\n\r\nWhen dawn broke it found Nadara much refreshed by the sleep she had\r\nenjoyed within the comparative safety of the great tree, and Stark\r\nhaggard and exhausted by a sleepless night of terror and regret. He\r\ncursed himself, the girl and his bestial passion, and then as his\r\nthoughts conjured her lovely face and perfect figure before his mind's\r\neye, he leaped to his feet and swung briskly toward the jungle. He\r\nwould find her. All that he had sacrificed should not be in vain. He\r\nwould find her and keep her. Together they would make a home upon this\r\ntropical shore. He would get everything out of life that there was to\r\nget.\r\n\r\nHe had taken but a few steps before he discovered, plain in the damp\r\nsand before him, the prints of Nadara's naked feet in a well defined\r\ntrail leading toward the wood. With a smile of satisfaction and victory\r\nthe man followed it into the maze of vegetation, dank and gloomy even\r\nbeneath the warm light of the morning sun.\r\n\r\nBy chance he stumbled directly upon Nadara. She had descended from her\r\ntree to search for water. They saw each other simultaneously. The girl\r\nturned and fled farther into the forest. Close behind her came the man.\r\nFor several hundred yards the chase led through the thick jungle which\r\nterminated abruptly at the edge of a narrow, rock-covered clearing\r\nbeyond which loomed sheer, precipitous cliffs, raising their lofty\r\nheads three hundred feet above the forest.\r\n\r\nA half smile touched Stark's lips as he saw the barrier that nature\r\nhad placed in the path of his quarry; but almost instantly it froze\r\ninto an expression of horror as a slight noise to his right attracted\r\nhis attention from the girl fleeing before him. For an instant he\r\nstood bewildered, then a quick glance toward the girl revealed her\r\nscaling the steep cliff with the agility of a monkey, and with a cry\r\nto attract her attention he leaped after her once more, but this time\r\nhimself the quarry--the hunter become the hunted, for after him raced a\r\nscore of painted savages, brandishing long, slim spears, or waving keen\r\nedged parangs.\r\n\r\nNadara had not needed Stark's warning cry to apprise her of the\r\nproximity of the wild men. She had seen them the instant that she\r\ncleared the jungle, and with the sight of them she knew that she need\r\nno longer harbor fear of the white man. In them, though, she saw a\r\ngraver danger for herself, since they, doubtless, would have little\r\ndifficulty in overhauling her in their own haunts, while she had not\r\nhad much cause for worry as to her ability to elude the white man\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nPart way up the cliffs she paused to look back. Stark had reached the\r\nfoot of the lowering escarpment a short distance ahead of his pursuers.\r\nHe had chosen this route because of the ease with which the girl had\r\nclambered up the rocky barrier, but he had reckoned without taking\r\ninto consideration the lifetime of practice which lay back of Nadara's\r\nagility. From earliest infancy she had lived upon the face and within\r\nthe caves of steep cliffs. Her first toddling, baby footsteps had been\r\nalong the edge of narrow shelving ledges.\r\n\r\nWhen the man reached the cliff, however, he found confronting him an\r\napparently unscalable wall. He cast a frightened, appealing glance\r\nat the girl far above him. Twice he essayed to scramble out of reach\r\nof the advancing savages, whose tattooed faces, pendulous slit ears,\r\nand sharp filed, blackened teeth lent to them a more horrid aspect\r\nthan even that imparted by their murderous weapons or warlike whoops\r\nand actions. Each time he slipped back, clutching frantically at\r\nrocky projections and such hardy vegetation as had found foothold in\r\nthe crevices of the granite. His hands were torn and bleeding, his\r\nface scratched and his clothing rent. And now the savages were upon\r\nhim. They had seen that he was unarmed. No need as yet for spear or\r\nparang--they would take him alive.\r\n\r\nAnd the girl. They had watched her in amazement as she clambered\r\nswiftly up the steep ascent. With all their primitive accomplishments\r\nthis was beyond even them. They were a forest people and a river\r\npeople. They dwelt in thatched houses raised high upon long piles. They\r\nknew little or nothing of the arts of the cliff dwellers. To them the\r\nfeat of this strange, white girl was little short of miraculous.\r\n\r\nNadara saw them seize roughly upon the terror-stricken Stark. She saw\r\nthem bind his hands behind his back, and then she saw them turn their\r\nattention once more toward herself.\r\n\r\nThree of the warriors attempted to scale the cliff after her.\r\nSlowly they ascended. She smiled at their manifest fear and their\r\nawkwardness--she need have no fear of these, they never could reach\r\nher. She permitted them to approach within a dozen feet of her and\r\nthen, loosening a bit of the crumbling granite, she hurled it full at\r\nthe head of the foremost. With a yell of pain and terror he toppled\r\nbackward upon those below him, the three tumbling, screaming and pawing\r\nto the rocks at the base of the cliff.\r\n\r\nNone of them was killed, though all were badly bruised, and he who had\r\nreceived her missile bled profusely from a wound upon his forehead.\r\nTheir fellows laughed at them--it was scant comfort they received\r\nfor being bested by a girl. Then they withdrew a short distance, and\r\nsquatting in a circle commenced a lengthy palaver. Their repeated\r\ngestures in her direction convinced Nadara that she was the subject of\r\ntheir debate.\r\n\r\nPresently one of their number arose and approached the foot of the\r\ncliff. There he harangued the girl for several minutes. When he was\r\ndone he awaited, evidently for a reply from her; but as Nadara had not\r\nbeen able to understand a word of the fellow's language she could but\r\nshake her head.\r\n\r\nThe spokesman returned to his fellows and once again a lengthy council\r\nwas held. During it Nadara climbed farther aloft, that she might be\r\nout of range of the slender spears. Upon a narrow ledge she halted,\r\ngathering about her such loose bits of rock as she could dislodge from\r\nthe face of the cliff--she would be prepared for a sudden onslaught,\r\nnor for a moment did she doubt the outcome of the battle. She felt\r\nthat but for the lack of food and water she could hold this cliff face\r\nforever against innumerable savages--could they climb no better than\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nBut the wild men did not again attempt to storm her citadel. Instead\r\nthey leaped suddenly from their council, and without a glance toward\r\nher disappeared in the forest, taking their prisoner with them. Out of\r\nsight of the girl, they stationed two of their number just within the\r\nscreening verdure to capture the girl should she descend. The others\r\nhastened parallel with the cliff until a sudden turn inland took them\r\nto a point from which they could again emerge into the clearing out of\r\nthe sight of Nadara.\r\n\r\nHere they took immediately to a well-worn path that led back and forth\r\nupward across the face of the cliff. Stark was dragged and prodded\r\nforward with them in their ascent. Sharp spears and the points of keen\r\nparangs, urged him to haste. By the time the party reached the summit\r\nthe white man was bleeding from a score of superficial wounds.\r\n\r\nNow the party turned back along the top of the bluff in the direction\r\nfrom which they had come.\r\n\r\nNadara, unable to fathom their reason for having abandoned the attempt\r\nto capture her, was, however, not lulled into any feeling of false\r\nsecurity. She knew the cliff was the safest place for her, and yet the\r\npangs of thirst and hunger warned her that she must soon leave it to\r\nseek sustenance. She was about to descend to the jungle below in search\r\nof food and water, when the faintest of movements of the earth sweeping\r\ncreepers depending from a giant buttress tree below her and just within\r\nthe verge of the forest arrested her acute attention. She knew that the\r\nmovement had been caused by some animal beneath the tree, and finally,\r\nas she watched intently for a moment or two, she descried through an\r\nopening in the wall of verdure the long feathers of an Argus pheasant\r\nwith which the war caps of the savages had been adorned.\r\n\r\nThough she knew now that she was watched, she also knew that she could\r\nreach the top of the cliff and possibly find both food and drink, if\r\nit chanced to be near, before the savages could overtake her. Then she\r\nmust depend upon her wits and her speed to regain the safety of the\r\ncliff ahead of them. That they would attempt to scale the barrier at\r\nthe same point at which she had climbed it she doubted, for she had\r\nseen that they were comparatively unaccustomed to this sort of going,\r\nand so she guessed that if they followed her upward at all it would be\r\nby means of some beaten trail of which they had knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd so Nadara scaled the heights, passing over and around obstacles\r\nthat would have blanched the cheek of the hardiest mountain climber,\r\nwith the ease and speed of the chamois. At the summit she found an\r\nopen, park-like forest, and into this she plunged, running forward in\r\nquest of food and drink. A few familiar fruits and nuts assuaged the\r\nkeenest pangs of hunger, but nowhere could she find water or signs of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nShe had traveled for almost a mile, directly inland from the coast,\r\nwhen she stumbled, purely by chance, upon a little spring hidden in\r\na leafy bower. The cool, clear water refreshed her, imparting to her\r\nnew life and energy. After drinking her fill she sought some means of\r\ncarrying a little supply of the priceless liquid back to her cliff\r\nside refuge, but though she searched diligently she could discover no\r\ngrowing thing which might be transformed into a vessel.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it then other than to return without the water,\r\ntrusting to her wits to find the means of eluding the savages from time\r\nto time as it became necessary for her to quench her thirst. Later,\r\nshe was sure, she should discover some form of gourd, or the bladder of\r\nan animal in which she could hoard a few precious drops.\r\n\r\nHer woodcraft, combined with her almost uncanny sense of direction,\r\nled her directly back to the spot at which she had topped the cliff.\r\nThere was no sign of the savages. She breathed a sigh of relief as she\r\nstepped to the edge of the forest, and then, all about her, from behind\r\ntrees and bushes, rose the main body of the wild men. With shouts of\r\nsavage glee they leaped upon her. There was no chance for flight--in\r\nevery direction brutal faces and murderous weapons barred her way.\r\n\r\nWith greater consideration than she had looked forward to they signaled\r\nher to accompany them. Stark was with them. To him slight humanity was\r\nshown. If he lagged, a spear point, already red with his blood, urged\r\nhim to greater speed; but to the girl no cruelty nor indignity was\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nIn single file, the prisoners in the center of the column, the party\r\nmade its way inland. All day they marched, until Stark, unused to this\r\nform of exertion, staggered and fell a dozen times in each mile.\r\n\r\nNadara could almost have found it in her heart to be sorry for him, had\r\nit not been for the fact that she realized all too keenly that but for\r\nhis own bestial brutality neither of them need have been there to be\r\nsubjected to the present torture, and to be tortured by anticipation of\r\nthe horrors to come.\r\n\r\nTo the girl it seemed that her fate must be a thousand fold more\r\nterrible than the mere death the man was to suffer, for that these\r\ndegraded savages would let him live seemed beyond the pale of reason.\r\nShe prayed to the God of which her Thandar had taught her for a quick\r\nand merciful death, yet while she prayed she well knew that no such\r\nboon could be expected.\r\n\r\nShe compared her captors with Korth and Flatfoot, with Big Fist and\r\nThurg, nor did she look for greater compassion in them than in the men\r\nshe had known best.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon it became evident that Stark could proceed no\r\nfarther unless the savages carried him. That they had any intention of\r\nso doing was soon disproved. The first officer of the _Priscilla_ had\r\nfallen for the twentieth time. A dozen vicious spear thrusts had failed\r\nto bring him, staggering and tottering, to his feet as in the past.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the party approached the fallen white, kicking him in the\r\nsides and face, and at last pricking him with the sharp point of his\r\nparang. Stark but lay an inert mass of suffering flesh, and groaned.\r\nThe chief grew angry. He grasped the white man around the body and\r\nraised him to his feet, but the moment that he released him Stark fell\r\nto earth once more.\r\n\r\nAt last the warrior could evidently control his rage no further. With\r\na savage whoop he swung his parang aloft, bringing it down full upon\r\nthe neck of the prostrate white. The head, grinning horribly, rolled to\r\nNadara's feet. She looked at it, lying there staring up at her out of\r\nits blank and sightless eyes, without the slightest trace of emotion.\r\n\r\nNadara, the cave girl, was accustomed to death in all its most horrible\r\nand sudden forms. She saw before her but the head of an enemy. It was\r\nnothing to her--Stark had only himself to thank.\r\n\r\nThe chief gathered the severed head into a bit of bark cloth, and\r\nfastening it to the end of his spear, signaled his followers to resume\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\nOn and on they went, farther into the interior, and with them went\r\nNadara, borne to what nameless fate she could but guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBUILDING THE BOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after the earthquake that had saved Nadara from Thurg and\r\nwiped out the people of the girl's tribe, a man moved feebly beneath\r\nthe tumbled debris from the roof top of his clogged cavern. It was\r\nThandar. The tons of rock that had toppled from above and buried\r\nthe entrance to his cave had passed him by unscathed, while the few\r\npounds shaken from the ceiling had stunned him into a long enduring\r\ninsensibility.\r\n\r\nSlowly he regained consciousness, but it was a long time before he\r\ncould marshal his faculties to even a slight appreciation of the\r\ncatastrophe that had overwhelmed him. Then his first thought was of\r\nNadara. He crawled to what had once been the entrance of his cave. He\r\nhad not as yet linked the darkness to its real cause--he thought it\r\nnight. It had been night when he closed his eyes. How could he guess\r\nthat that had been three nights before, or all the cruel blows that\r\nfate had struck him since he slept!\r\n\r\nAt the opening from the cave he met his first surprise and setback--the\r\nway was blocked! What was the meaning of it? He tugged and pushed\r\nweakly upon the mass that barred him from escape. Who had imprisoned\r\nhim? He recalled the vivid dream in which he had seen Nadara stolen\r\naway by Thurg. The recollection sent him frantically at the pile of\r\nshattered rock and loose debris which choked the doorway.\r\n\r\nTo his chagrin he found himself too weak to direct any long sustained\r\neffort against the obstacle. It occurred to him that he must have been\r\ninjured. Whoever imprisoned him must first have beaten him. He felt of\r\nhis head. Yes, there was a great gash, but his touch told him that it\r\nwas not a new one. How long, then, had he been imprisoned? As he sat\r\npondering this thing he became aware of the gnawing of hunger and the\r\ncraving of thirst within his slowly awakening body. The sensations were\r\nalmost painful. So much so that they forced him to a realization of the\r\nfact that he must have been without food or water for a considerable\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAgain he assailed the mass that held him prisoner, and as he burrowed\r\nslowly into it the truth dawned upon him. He recalled the rumblings of\r\nthe Great Nagoola that had frightened Nadara the night of the council.\r\nA terrific quake had done this thing. Thandar shuddered as he thought\r\nof Nadara. Was she, too, imprisoned in her cave, or had the worst\r\nhappened her? Frantically, now, he tore at the close-packed rubble. But\r\nhe soon discovered that not in ill-directed haste lay his means of\r\nescape. Slowly and carefully, piece by piece he must remove the broken\r\nrock until he had tunnelled through to the outer world.\r\n\r\nReason told him that he was not deeply buried, for the fact that he\r\nlived and could breathe was sufficient proof that fresh air was finding\r\nits way through the debris, which it could not have done did the stuff\r\nlie before the cave in any considerable thickness.\r\n\r\nWeak as he was he could work but slowly, so that it was several hours\r\nlater before he caught the first glimpse of daylight beyond the\r\nobstacle. After that he progressed more rapidly, and presently he\r\ncrawled through a small opening to view the wreckage of the shattered\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\nA flock of vultures rose from their hideous feast as the sight of\r\nThandar disturbed them. The man shuddered as he looked down upon the\r\ngrisly things from which they had risen. Forgetting his hunger and his\r\nthirst he scrambled up over the tortured cliff face to where Nadara's\r\ncave had been. Its mouth was buried as his had been. Again he set to\r\nwork, but this time it was easier. When at last he had opened a way\r\nwithin he hesitated for fear of the blighting sorrow that awaited him.\r\n\r\nAt last, nerving himself to the ordeal, he crawled within the cave\r\nthat had been Nadara's. Groping about in the darkness, expecting each\r\nmoment to feel the body of his loved one cold in death, he at last\r\ncovered the entire floor--there was no body within.\r\n\r\nHastily he made his way to the face of the cliff again, and then\r\ncommenced a horrible and pitiful search among the ghastly remnants of\r\nmen and women that lay scattered about among the tumbled rocks. But\r\neven here his search was vain, for the ghoulish scavengers had torn\r\nfrom their prey every shred of their former likenesses.\r\n\r\nWeak, exhausted, sorrow ridden and broken, Thandar dragged himself\r\npainfully to the little river. Here he quenched his thirst and bathed\r\nhis body. After, he sought food, and then he crawled to a hole he knew\r\nof in the river bank, and curling up upon the dead grasses within,\r\nslept the sun around.\r\n\r\nRefreshed and strengthened by his sleep and the food that he had taken\r\nThandar emerged from his dark warren with renewed hope. Nadara could\r\nnot be dead! It was impossible. She must have escaped and be wandering\r\nabout the island. He would search for her until he found her. But as\r\nday followed day and still no sign of Nadara, or any other living human\r\nbeing he became painfully convinced that he alone of the inhabitants of\r\nthe island had survived the cataclysm.\r\n\r\nThe thought of living on through a long life without her cast him into\r\nthe blackest pit of despair. He reproached heaven for not having taken\r\nhim as well, for without Nadara life was not worth the living. With\r\nthe passage of time his grief grew more rather than less acute. As it\r\nincreased so too increased the horror of his loneliness. The island\r\nbecame a hated thing--life a mockery. The chances that a vessel would\r\ntouch the shore again during his lifetime seemed remote indeed, unless\r\nhis father sent out a relief party, but in his despair he did not even\r\nhope for such a contingency.\r\n\r\nHe would not take his own life, though the temptation was great, but he\r\ncourted death in every form that the savage island owned. He slept out\r\nupon the ground at night. He sought Nagoola in his lair, and armed only\r\nwith his light lance he leaped to close quarters with every one of the\r\ngreat cats he could find.\r\n\r\nThe wild boars, often as formidable as Nagoola himself, were hunted\r\nnow as they never had been hunted before. Thandar lived high those\r\ndays, and many were the panther pelts that lined his new-found cave\r\nin the cliff beside the sea--the same cliff in which Nadara had found\r\nshelter, and from whence she had gone away with the search party from\r\nthe _Priscilla_.\r\n\r\nOne day as Thandar was returning from the beach where he often went\r\nto scan the horizon for a sail, he saw something moving at the foot\r\nof his cliff. Thandar dropped behind a bush, watching. A moment later\r\nthe thing moved again, and Thandar saw that it was a man. Instantly he\r\nsprang to his feet and ran forward. The days that he had been without\r\nhuman companionship had seemed to drag themselves into as many weary\r\nmonths. Now he had reached the pinnacle of loneliness from which he\r\nwould gladly have embraced the devil had he come in human guise.\r\n\r\nThandar ran noiselessly. He was almost upon the man, a great, hairy\r\nbrute, before the fellow was aware of his presence. At first the fellow\r\nturned to run, but when he saw that Thandar was alone he remained to\r\nfight.\r\n\r\n\"I am Roof,\" he cried, \"and I can kill you!\"\r\n\r\nThe familiar primitive greeting no longer raised Thandar's temperature\r\nor filled him with the fire of battle. He wanted companionship now, not\r\na quarrel.\r\n\r\n\"I am Thandar,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nThe slow-witted, hulking brute recognized him, and stepped back a pace.\r\nHe was not so keen to fight now that he had learned the identity of\r\nthe man who faced him. He had seen Thandar in battle. He had witnessed\r\nThurg's defeat at the hands of this smooth-skinned stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Let us not fight,\" continued Thandar. \"We are alone upon the island.\r\nI have seen no other than you since the Great Nagoola came forth and\r\ndestroyed the people. Let us be friends, hunting together in peace.\r\nOtherwise one of us must kill the other and thereafter live always\r\nalone until death releases him from his terrible solitude.\"\r\n\r\nRoof peered over Thandar's shoulder toward the wood behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you alone?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--have I not told you that all were killed but you and I?\"\r\n\r\n\"All were not killed,\" replied Roof. \"But I will be friends with\r\nThandar. We will hunt together and cave together. Roof and Thandar are\r\nbrothers.\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped, and gathering a handful of grass advanced toward the\r\nAmerican. Thandar did likewise, and when each had taken the peace\r\noffering of the other and rubbed it upon his forehead the ceremony of\r\nfriendship was complete--simple but none the less effectual, for each\r\nknew that the other would rather die than disregard the primitive pact.\r\n\r\n\"You said that all were not killed, Roof,\" said Thandar, the ceremony\r\nover. \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"All were not killed by the Great Nagoola,\" replied the bad man. \"Thurg\r\nwas not killed, nor was she who was Thandar's mate--she whom Thurg\r\nwould have stolen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Thandar almost screamed the question. \"Nadara not dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said Roof, and he led the way to the foot of the cliff. \"See!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Thandar, \"I had noticed that body, but what of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Thurg,\" explained Roof. \"He sought to reach your mate, who had\r\ntaken refuge in that cave far above us. Then came some strange men who\r\nmade a great noise with sticks and Thurg fell dead--the loud noise had\r\nkilled him from a great distance. Then came the strange men and she\r\nwhom you call Nadara went away with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"In which direction?\" cried Thandar. \"Where did they take her?\"\r\n\r\n\"They took her to the strange cliff in which they dwelt--the one in\r\nwhich they came. Never saw man such a thing as this cliff. It floated\r\nupon the face of the water. About its face were many tiny caves, but\r\nthe people did not come out of these they came from the top of the\r\ncliff, and clambering down the sides floated ashore in hollow things of\r\nwood. On top of the cliff were two trees without leaves, and only very\r\nshort, straight branches. When the cliff went away black smoke came out\r\nof it from a short black stump of a tree between the two trees. It was\r\na very wonderful thing to see; but the most wonderful of all were the\r\nnoise-sticks that killed Thurg and Nagoola a long way off.\"\r\n\r\nNot half of Roof's narrative did Thandar hear. Through his brain roared\r\nand thundered a single mighty thought: Nadara lives! Nadara lives! Life\r\ntook on a new meaning to him now. He trembled at the thought of the\r\nchances he had been taking. Now, indeed, must he live. He leaped up and\r\ndown, laughing and shouting. He threw his arms about the astonished\r\nRoof, whirling the troglodyte about in a mad waltz. Nadara lives!\r\nNadara lives!\r\n\r\nOnce again the sun shone, the birds sang, nature was her old, happy,\r\ncarefree self. Nadara was alive and among civilized men. But then came\r\na doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Did Nadara go willingly with these strangers,\" he asked Roof, \"or did\r\nthey take her by force?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did not take her by force,\" replied Roof. \"They talked with her\r\nfor a time, and then she took the hand of one of the men in hers,\r\nstroking it, and he placed his arm about her. Afterward they walked\r\nslowly to the edge of the great water where they got into the strange\r\nthings that had brought them to the land, and returned to their\r\nfloating cliff. Presently the smoke came out, as I have told you, and\r\nthe cliff went away toward the edge of the world. But they are all dead\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" yelled Thandar.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw the cliff sink, very slowly when it was a long way off,\r\nuntil only the smoke was coming out of the water.\"\r\n\r\nThandar breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"Point,\" he said, \"to the place where the cliff sank beneath the water.\"\r\n\r\nRoof pointed almost due north.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" he said.\r\n\r\nFor days Thandar puzzled over the possible identity of the ship and\r\nthe men with whom Nadara had gone so willingly. Doubtless some kindly\r\nmariner, hearing her story, had taken her home, away from the terrors\r\nand the loneliness of this unhappy island. And now the man chafed to be\r\nafter her, that he might search the world for his lost love.\r\n\r\nTo wait for a ship appeared quite impossible to the impatient\r\nThandar, for he knew that a ship might never come. There was but one\r\nalternative, and had Waldo Emerson been a less impractical man in the\r\nworld to which he had been born he would have cast aside that single\r\nalternative as entirely beyond the pale of possibility. But Waldo was\r\nonly practical and wise in the savage ways of the primitive life to\r\nwhich circumstance had forced him to revert. And so he decided upon\r\nas foolhardy and hair-brained a venture as the mind of man might\r\nconceive. It was no less a thing than to build a boat and set out upon\r\nthe broad Pacific in search of a civilized port or a vessel that might\r\nbear him to such.\r\n\r\nTo Waldo it seemed quite practical. He realized of course that the\r\nventure would be fraught with peril, but would it not be better to\r\ndie in an attempt to find his Nadara than to live on forever in the\r\nhopelessness of this forgotten land?\r\n\r\nAnd so he set to work to build a boat. He had no tools but his crude\r\nknife and the razor the sailor of the _Sally Corwith_ had given\r\nhim, so it was quite impossible for him to construct a dug-out. The\r\npossibilities that lie in fire did not occur to him. Finally he hit\r\nupon what seemed the only feasible form of construction.\r\n\r\nWith his knife he cut long, pliant saplings, and lesser branches. These\r\nhe fashioned into the framework of a boat. Roof helped him, keenly\r\ninterested in this new work. The ribs were fastened to the keel and\r\ngunwale by thongs of panther skin, and when the framework was completed\r\npanther skins were stretched over it. The edges of the skin were sewn\r\ntogether with threads of gut, as tightly as Thandar and Roof could pull\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA mast was rigged well forward, and another panther skin from which the\r\nfur had been scraped was fitted as a sail, square rigged. For rudder\r\nThandar fashioned a long, slender sapling, looped at one end, and the\r\nloop covered with skin laced tightly on. This, he figured, would serve\r\nboth as rudder and paddle, as necessity demanded.\r\n\r\nAt last all was done. Together Thandar and Roof carried the light,\r\ncrude skiff to the ocean. They waded out beyond the surf, and upon the\r\ncrest of a receding swell they launched the thing, Thandar leaping in\r\nas it floated upon the water.\r\n\r\nThe sail was not taken along for this trial. Thandar merely wished to\r\nknow that this craft would float, and right side up. For a moment it\r\ndid so, until the sea rushing in at the loose seams filled it with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThandar and Roof had great difficulty in dragging it out again upon the\r\nbeach. Roof now would have given up, but not so Thandar. It is true\r\nthat he was slightly disheartened, for he had set great store upon the\r\nsuccess of his little vessel.\r\n\r\nAfter they had carried the frail thing beyond high tide Thandar sat\r\ndown upon the ground and for an hour he did naught but stare at the\r\nleaky craft. Then he arose and calling to Roof led him into the forest.\r\nFor a mile they walked, and then Thandar halted before a tree from the\r\nside of which a thick and sticky stream was slowly oozing. Thandar\r\nhad brought along a gourd, and now with a small branch he commenced\r\ntransferring the mass from the side of the tree to the gourd. Roof\r\nhelped him. In an hour the gourd was filled. Then they returned to the\r\nskiff.\r\n\r\nLeaving the gourd there Thandar and Roof walked to a clump of heavy\r\njungle grasses not far from the cliff where their cave lay. Here\r\nThandar gathered a great armful of the yellow, ripened grass, telling\r\nRoof to do likewise. This they took back to the skiff, where, by\r\nrolling it assiduously between their hands and pounding it with stones\r\nthey reduced it to a mass of soft, tough fiber.\r\n\r\nNow Thandar showed Roof how to twist this fiber into a loose, fluffy\r\nrope, and when he had him well started he daubed the rope with the\r\nrubbery fluid he had filched from the tree, and with a sharp stick\r\ntucked it in every seam and crevice of the skiff.\r\n\r\nIt took the better part of two days to accomplish this, and when it was\r\ndone and the gourd empty, the two men returned to the tree and refilled\r\nit. This time they built a fire upon their return to the skiff, Roof\r\nspinning a hard wood splinter rapidly between toes and fingers in a\r\nlittle mass of tinder that lay in a hollowed piece of wood. Presently a\r\nthin spiral of smoke arose from the tinder, growing denser for a moment\r\nuntil of a sudden it broke into flame.\r\n\r\nThe men piled twigs and branches upon the blaze until the fire was well\r\nstarted. Then Thandar taking a ball of the viscous matter from the\r\ngourd heated it in the flames, immediately daubing the melting mass\r\nupon the outside of the skiff. In this way, slowly and with infinite\r\npatience, the two at last succeeded in coating the entire outer surface\r\nof the canoe with a waterproof substance that might defy the action of\r\nwater almost indefinitely.\r\n\r\nFor three days Thandar let the coating dry, and then the craft was\r\ngiven another trial. The man's heart was in his throat as the canoe\r\nfloated upon the crest of a great wave and he leaped into it.\r\n\r\nBut a moment later he shouted in relief and delight--the thing floated\r\nlike a cork, nor was there the slightest leak discernible. For half an\r\nhour Thandar paddled about the harbor, and then he returned for the\r\nsail. This too, though rather heavy and awkward, worked admirably, and\r\nthe balance of the day he spent in sailing, even venturing out into the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nMuch of the time he paddled, for Waldo Emerson knew more of the galleys\r\nof ancient Greece than he did of sails or sailing, so that for the most\r\npart he sailed with the wind, paddling when he wished to travel in\r\nanother direction. But, withal, his attempt filled him with delight,\r\nand he could scarce wait to be off toward civilization and Nadara.\r\n\r\nThe next two days were spent in collecting food and water, which\r\nThandar packed in numerous gourds, sealing the mouths with the rubbery\r\nsubstance such as he had used to waterproof his craft. The flesh of\r\nwild hog, and deer, and bird he cut in narrow strips and dried over\r\na slow fire. In this work Roof assisted him, and at last all was in\r\nreadiness for the venture.\r\n\r\nThe day of his departure dawned bright and clear. A gentle south wind\r\ngave promise of great speed toward the north. Thandar was wild with\r\nhope and excitement. Roof was to accompany him, but at the last moment\r\nthe nerve of the troglodyte failed him, and he ran away and hid in the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nIt was just as well, thought Thandar, for now his provisions would last\r\ntwice as long. And so he set out upon his perilous adventure, braving\r\nthe mighty Pacific in a frail and unseaworthy cockle-shell with all the\r\nassurance and confidence that is ever born of ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE HEAD-HUNTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nNature so far, had been kind to Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones. No high\r\nwinds or heavy seas had assailed him, and he had been upon the water\r\nfor three days now. The wind had held steadily out of the south,\r\nvarying but a few points during this time but even so Waldo Emerson\r\nwas commencing to doubt and to worry. His supply of water was running\r\ndangerously low, his food supply would last but a few days longer; and\r\nas yet he had sighted no sail, nor seen any land. Furthermore, he had\r\nnot the remotest conception of how he might retrace his way to the\r\nisland he had just quitted. He could only sail before the wind. Should\r\nthe wind veer around into the north he might, by chance, be blown back\r\nto the island. Otherwise he never could reach it. And he was beginning\r\nto wonder if he had not been a trifle to precipitate in his abandonment\r\nof land.\r\n\r\nIn common with most other landsmen, Waldo Emerson had little conception\r\nof the vastness of the broad reaches of unbroken water wildernesses\r\nthat roll in desolate immensity over three quarters of the globe.\r\nHis recollection of maps pictured the calm and level blue dotted,\r\nespecially in the south seas, with many islands. Their names, often,\r\nwere quite reassuring. He recollected, among others, such as the\r\nSociety Islands, the Friendly Islands, Christmas Island. He hoped\r\nthat he would land upon one of these. There were so many islands upon\r\nthe maps, and they seemed so close together that he was not a little\r\nmystified that he had failed to sight several hundred long before this.\r\n\r\nAnd ships! It appeared incredible that he should have seen not a\r\nsingle sail. He distinctly recalled the atlas he had examined prior to\r\nembarking upon his health cruise. The Pacific had been lined in all\r\ndirections with the routes of long established steamer lanes, and in\r\nbetween, Waldo had felt, the ocean must be dotted with the innumerable\r\ntramps that come and go between the countless ports that fringe the\r\nmajor sea.\r\n\r\nAnd yet for three days nothing had broken the dull monotony of the vast\r\ncircle of which he was always the center and the sole occupant. In\r\nthree days, thought Waldo, he must have covered an immense distance.\r\n\r\nAnd three more days dragged their weary lengths. The wind had died to\r\nthe faintest of breezes. The canoe was just making headway and that\r\nwas all. The water was gone. The food nearly so. Waldo was suffering\r\nfrom lack of the former. The pitiless sun beating down upon him\r\nincreased his agony. He stretched his panther skin across the stern and\r\nhid beneath it from the torrid rays. And there he lay until darkness\r\nbrought relief.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the wind sprang up again, but this time from the\r\nwest. It rose and with it rose the sea. The man, clinging to his crude\r\nsteering blade, struggled to keep the light craft straight before the\r\nwind which was now howling fearfully while great waves, hungry and wide\r\njawed, raced after him like a pack of ravenous wolves.\r\n\r\nThandar knew that the unequal struggle against the mighty forces of the\r\nelements could not endure for long. It seemed that each fierce gust\r\nof brutal wind must tear his frail boat to shreds, and yet it was the\r\nvery lightness of the thing that saved it, for it rode upon the crests\r\nof waves, blown forward at terrific velocity like a feather before the\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\nIn Thandar's heart was no terror--only regret that he might never again\r\nsee his mother, his father, or his Nadara. Yet the night wore on and\r\nstill he fled before the storm. The sky was overcast--the darkness\r\nwas impenetrable. He imagined all about him still the same wide,\r\ntenantless circle of water, only now storm torn and perpendicular and\r\nblack, instead of peacefully horizontal, and soothingly blue-green. And\r\nthen, even as he was thinking this there rose before him a thunderous\r\nbooming loud above the frenzied bedlam of the storm, his boat was\r\nlifted high in air to dive headforemost into what might be a bottomless\r\nabyss for all Thandar knew. But it was not bottomless. The canoe struck\r\nsomething and stopped suddenly, pitching Thandar out into a boiling\r\nmaelstrom. A great wave picked him up, carrying him with race-horse\r\nvelocity within its crest. He felt himself hurled pitilessly upon\r\nsmooth, hard sand. The water tried to drag him back, but he fought with\r\ntoes and fingers, clutching at the surface of the stuff upon which he\r\nhad been dropped. Then the wave abandoned him and raced swiftly back\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nThandar was exhausted, but he knew that he must crawl up out of the\r\nway of the surf, or be dragged back by the next roller. What he had\r\nsearched for in vain through six long days he had run down in the\r\nmidst of a Stygian night. He had found land! Or, to be more explicit,\r\nland had got in front of him and he had run into it. He had commenced\r\nto wonder if some terrible convulsion of nature had not swallowed up\r\nall the land in the world, leaving only a waste of desolate water. He\r\nforgot his hunger and his thirst in the happiness of the knowledge that\r\nonce more he was upon land. He wondered a little what land it might be.\r\nHe hoped that dawn would reveal the chimneys and steeples of a nearby\r\ncity. And then, exhausted, he fell into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was the sun shining down into his upturned face that awoke him. He\r\nwas lying upon his back beside a clump of bushes a little way above the\r\nbeach. He was about to rise and survey the new world into which fate\r\nand a hurricane had hurled him when he heard a familiar sound upon the\r\nopposite side of his bush. It was the movement of an animal creeping\r\nthrough long grass.\r\n\r\nThandar, the cave man, came noiselessly to his hands and knees, peering\r\ncautiously through the intervening network of branches. What he saw\r\nsent his hand groping for his wooden sword with its fire-hardened\r\npoint. There, not five paces from him, was a man going cautiously upon\r\nall fours. It was the most horrible appearing man that Thandar had ever\r\nseen--even Thurg appeared lovely by comparison. The creature's ears\r\nwere split and heavy ornaments had dragged them down until the lobes\r\nrested upon its shoulders. The face was terribly marked with cicatrices\r\nand tattooing. The teeth were black and pointed. A head-dress of long\r\nfeathers waved and nodded above the hideous face. There was much\r\ntattooing upon the arms and legs and abdomen; the breasts were circled\r\nwith it. In a belt about the waist lay a sword in its scabbard. In the\r\nman's hand was a long spear.\r\n\r\nThe warrior was creeping stealthily upon something at Thandar's left.\r\nThe latter looked in the direction the other's savage gaze was bent.\r\nThrough the bushes he could barely discern a figure moving toward them\r\nalong the edge of the beach. The warrior had passed him now and Thandar\r\nstood erect the better to obtain a view of the fellow's quarry.\r\n\r\nNow he saw it plainly--a man strangely garbed in many colors. A\r\nyellow jacket, soiled and torn, covered the upper part of his body.\r\nStrange designs, very elaborate, were embroidered upon the garment\r\nwhich reached barely to the fellow's waist. Beneath was a red sash in\r\nwhich were stuck a long pistol and a wicked-looking knife. Baggy blue\r\ntrousers reached to the bare ankles and feet. A strip of crimson cloth\r\nwound around the head completed the strange garmenture. The features of\r\nthe man were Mongolian.\r\n\r\nThandar could see the warrior pause as it became evident that the other\r\nwas approaching directly toward his place of concealment, but at the\r\nlast moment the unconscious quarry turned sharply to his right down\r\nupon the beach. He had discovered the wreck of Thandar's canoe and was\r\ngoing to investigate it.\r\n\r\nThe move placed Thandar almost between the two. Suddenly the native\r\nrose to his feet--his victim's back was toward him. Grasping his\r\nspear in his left hand he drew his wicked-looking sword and emerged\r\ncautiously from the bushes. At the same moment the man upon the beach\r\nwheeled quickly as though suddenly warned of his danger. The native,\r\ndiscovered, leaped forward with raised sword. The man snatched his\r\npistol from his belt, levelled it at the on-rushing warrior and pulled\r\nthe trigger. There was a futile click--that was all. The weapon had\r\nmissed fire.\r\n\r\nInstantly a third element was projected into the fray. Thandar, seeing\r\na more direct link with civilization in the strangely apparelled Mongol\r\nthan in the naked savage, leaped to the assistance of the former. With\r\ndrawn sword he rushed out upon the savage. The wild man turned at\r\nThandar's cry, which he had given to divert the fellow's attention from\r\nhis now almost helpless victim.\r\n\r\nThandar knew nothing of the finer points of sword play. He was ignorant\r\nof the wickedness of a Malay parang--the keen, curved sword of the\r\nhead-hunter, so he rushed in upon the savage as he would have upon one\r\nof Thurg's near-men.\r\n\r\nThe very impetuosity of his attack awed the native. For a moment he\r\nstood his ground, and then, with a cry of terror turned to flee; but he\r\nhad failed to turn soon enough. Thandar was upon him. The sharp point\r\nentered his back beneath the left shoulder blade, and behind it were\r\nthe weight and sinews of the cave man. With a shriek the savage lunged\r\nforward, clutching at the cruel point that now protruded from his\r\nbreast. When he touched the earth he was dead.\r\n\r\nThandar drew his sword from the body of the head-hunter, and turned\r\ntoward the man he had rescued. The latter was approaching, talking\r\nexcitedly. It was evident that he was thanking Thandar, but no word of\r\nhis strange tongue could the American understand. Thandar shook his\r\nhead to indicate that he was unfamiliar with the other's language, and\r\nthen the latter dropped into pidgin English, which, while almost as\r\nunintelligible to the cultured Bostonian, still contained the battered\r\nremnants of some few words with which he was familiar.\r\n\r\nThandar depreciated his act by means of gestures, immediately following\r\nthese with signs to indicate that he was hungry and thirsty. The\r\nstranger evidently understood him, for he motioned him to follow,\r\nleading the way back along the beach in the direction from which he had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nBefore starting, however, he had pointed toward the wreck of Thandar's\r\ncanoe and then toward Thandar, nodding his head questioningly as to ask\r\nif the boat belonged to the cave man.\r\n\r\nAround the end of a promontory they came upon a little cove beside\r\nthe beach of which Thandar saw a camp of nearly a score of men similar\r\nin appearance to his guide. These were preparing breakfast beside the\r\npartially completed hull of a rather large boat they seemed to have\r\nbeen building.\r\n\r\nAt sight of Thandar they looked their astonishment, but after hearing\r\nthe story of their fellow they greeted the cave man warmly, furnishing\r\nhim with food and water in abundance.\r\n\r\nFor three days Thandar worked with these men upon their craft, picking\r\nup their story slowly with a slow acquirement of a bowing acquaintance\r\nwith the bastard tongue they used when speaking with him. He soon\r\nbecame aware of the fact that fate had thrown him among a band of\r\npirates. There were Chinese, Japanese and Malays among them--the\r\noff-scourings of the south seas; men who had become discredited even\r\namong the villainous pirates of their own lands, and had been forced\r\nto join their lots in this remoter and less lucrative field, under an\r\nunhung ruffian, Tsao Ming, the Chinaman whose life Thandar had saved.\r\n\r\nHe also learned that the storm that had cast them upon this shore\r\nnearly a month before had demolished their prahu, and what with the\r\nbuilding of another and numerous skirmishes with the savages they had\r\nhad a busy time of it.\r\n\r\nOnly yesterday while a party of them had been hunting a mile or\r\ntwo inland they had been attacked by savages who had killed two and\r\ncaptured one of their number.\r\n\r\nThey told Thandar that these savages were the most ferocious of\r\nhead-hunters, but like the majority of their kind preferred ambushing\r\nan unwary victim to meeting him in fair fight in the open. Thandar did\r\nnot doubt but that the latter mode of warfare would have been entirely\r\nto the liking of his piratical friends, for never in his life had he\r\ndreamed, even, of so ferocious and warlike a band as was comprised in\r\nthis villainous and bloodthirsty aggregation. But the constant nervous\r\ntension under which they had worked, never knowing at what instant an\r\narrow or a lance would leap from the shades of the jungle to pierce\r\nthem in the back, had reduced them to a state of fear that only a\r\nspeedy departure from the island could conquer.\r\n\r\nTheir boat was almost completed, two more days would see them safely\r\nlaunched upon the ocean, and Tsao Ming had promised Thandar that he\r\nwould carry him to a civilized port from which he could take a steamer\r\non his return to America.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of the third day since his arrival among the\r\npirates the men were suddenly startled by the appearance of an\r\nexhausted and blood smeared apparition amongst them. From the nearby\r\njungle the man had staggered to fall when half-way across the\r\nclearing, spent.\r\n\r\nIt was Boloon--he who had been captured by the head-hunters the day\r\nbefore Thandar had been cast upon the shore. Revived with food and\r\nwater the fellow told a most extraordinary tale. From the meager scraps\r\nthat were afterward translated into pidgin English for Thandar the\r\nBostonian learned that Boloon had been dragged far inland to a village\r\nof considerable size.\r\n\r\nHere he had been placed in a room of one of the long houses to await\r\nthe pleasure of the chief. It was hinted that he was to be tortured\r\nbefore his head was removed to grace the rafters of the chief's palace.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable portion of his tale related to a strange temple to which\r\nhe had been dragged and thrown at the feet of a white goddess. Tsao\r\nMing and the other pirates were much mystified by this part of the\r\nstory, for Boloon insisted that the goddess was white with a mass of\r\nblack hair, and that her body was covered by the pelt of a magnificent\r\nblack panther.\r\n\r\nThough Tsao Ming pointed out that there were no panthers upon this\r\nisland Boloon could not be shaken. He had seen with his own eyes, and\r\nhe knew. Furthermore, he argued, there were no white goddesses upon the\r\nisland, and yet the woman he had seen was white.\r\n\r\nWhen this strange tale was retold to Thandar he could not but recall\r\nthat Nadara had worn a black panther skin, but of course it could\r\nnot be Nadara--that was impossible. But yet he asked for a further\r\ndescription of the goddess--the color of her eyes and hair--the\r\nproportions of her body--her height.\r\n\r\nTo all these questions Boloon gave replies that but caused Thandar's\r\nexcitement to wax stronger. And then came the final statement that set\r\nhim in a frenzy of hope and apprehension.\r\n\r\n\"Upon her left hand was a great diamond,\" said Boloon.\r\n\r\nThandar turned toward Tsao Ming.\r\n\r\n\"I go inland to the temple,\" he said, \"to see who this white goddess\r\nmay be. If you wait two days for me and I return you shall have as much\r\ngold as you ask in payment. If you do not wait repair my canoe and hide\r\nit in the bushes where the man hid who would have killed you but for\r\nThandar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall wait three days,\" replied Tsao Ming. \"Nor will I take a single\r\n_fun_ in pay. You saved the life of Tsao Ming--that is not soon to be\r\nforgotten. I would send men with you, but they would not go. They are\r\nafraid of the head-hunters. Too, will I repair your canoe against your\r\ncoming after the third day; but,\" and he shrugged, \"you will not come\r\nupon the third day, nor upon the fourth, nor ever, Thandar. It is\r\nbetter that you forget the foolish story of the frightened Boloon and\r\ncome away from this accursed land with Tsao Ming.\"\r\n\r\nBut Thandar would not relinquish his intention, and so he parted with\r\nthe pirates after receiving from Boloon explicit directions for his\r\njourney toward the mysterious temple and the white goddess who might be\r\nNadara; and yet who could not be.\r\n\r\nStraight into the tangled jungle he plunged, carrying the spear and the\r\nparang of the head-hunter he had killed, and in the string about his\r\nloins one of the long pistols of a dead pirate. This latter Tsao Ming\r\nhad forced upon him with a supply of ammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was dusk of the second day when Thandar, following the directions\r\ngiven him by Boloon, came to the edge of the little clearing within\r\nwhich rose the dingy outlines of many long houses raised upon piles.\r\nBefore the village ran a river. Many times had Thandar crossed and\r\nrecrossed this stream, for he had become lost twice upon the way and\r\nhad to return part way each time to pick up his trail.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the village the man could see the outlines of a\r\nloftier structure rearing its head above those of the others. As\r\ndarkness fell Thandar crept closer toward his goal--the large building\r\nwhich Boloon had described as the temple.\r\n\r\nBeneath the high raised houses the cave man crept, disturbing pigs and\r\nchickens as he went, but their noise was no uncommon thing, and rather\r\nthan being a menace to his safety it safeguarded him, for it hid the\r\nnoise of his own advance.\r\n\r\nAt last he came beneath a house nearest the temple. The moon was full\r\nand high. Her brilliant light flooded the open spaces between the\r\nbuildings, casting into black darkness the shadows beneath. In one of\r\nthese Thandar lurked. He saw that the temple was guarded. Before its\r\nonly entrance squatted two warriors. How was he to pass them?\r\n\r\nHe moved to the end of the shadow of the house beneath which he spied\r\nas far from the guards as possible; but still discovery seemed certain\r\nwere he to attempt to rush across the intervening space. He was at a\r\nloss as to what next to do. It seemed foolish to risk all now upon a\r\nbold advance--the time for such a risk would be when he had found the\r\ngoddess and learned if she were Nadara, or another; but how might he\r\ncross that strip of moonlight and enter the temple past the two guards,\r\nwithout risk?\r\n\r\nHe moved silently to the far end of the building, in the shadows of\r\nwhich he watched. For some time he stood looking across at his goal, so\r\nnear, and yet seemingly infinitely farther from attainment than the day\r\nhe had left the coast in search of it. He noted the long poles stuck\r\ninto the ground at irregular intervals about the structure. He wondered\r\nat the significance of the rude carving upon them, of the barbaric\r\ncapitals sometimes topped by the head-dress of a savage warrior, again\r\nby a dried and grinning skull, or perhaps the rudely chiseled likeness\r\nof a hideous human face.\r\n\r\nUpon many of the poles were hung shields, weapons, clothing and\r\nearthenware vessels. One especially was so weighted down by its\r\nheterogeneous burden that it leaned drunkenly against the eaves of\r\nthe temple. Thandar's eye followed it upward to where it touched the\r\ncrudely shingled roof. The suggestion was sufficient--where his eye\r\nhad climbed he would climb. There was only the moonlight to make the\r\nattempt perilous. If the clouds would but come! But there was no\r\nindication of clouds in the star shot sky.\r\n\r\nHe looked toward the guards. They lolled at the opposite end of the\r\ntemple, only one of them being visible. The other was hidden by the\r\nangle of the building. The back of the fellow whom Thandar could see\r\nwas turned toward the cave man. If they remained thus for a moment\r\nhe could reach the roof unnoticed. But then there was the danger of\r\ndiscovery from one of the other buildings. An occasional whiff of\r\ntobacco smoke told him that some of the men were still awake upon the\r\nverandahs where most of the youths and bachelors slept.\r\n\r\nThandar crawled to where he could see the only verandah which directly\r\nfaced the portion of the temple he had chosen for his attempted\r\nentrance. For an hour he watched the rising and falling glow of the\r\ncigarettes of two of the native men, and listened to the low hum of\r\ntheir conversation. The hour seemed to drag into an eternity, but at\r\nlast the glowing butt of first one cigarette and then another was\r\nflicked over into the grass and silence reigned upon the verandah.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour longer Thandar waited. The guards before the temple\r\nstill squatted as before. The one Thandar could see seemed to have\r\nfallen asleep, for his head drooped forward upon his breast.\r\n\r\nThe time had come. There was no need of further delay or\r\nreconnaisance--if he was to be discovered that would be the end of it,\r\nand it would not profit him one iota to know a second or so in advance\r\nof the alarm that he had been detected. So he did not waste time in\r\nstealthy advance, or in much looking this way and that. Instead he\r\nmoved swiftly, though silently, directly across the open, moonlit space\r\nto the foot of the leaning pole. He did not cast a glance behind nor to\r\nthe right nor left. His whole attention was riveted upon the thing in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThandar had scaled the rickety, toppling saplings of the cliff dwellers\r\nfor so long that this pole offered no greater difficulties to him than\r\nwould an ordinary staircase to you or me. First he tested it with eyes\r\nand hands to know that it rested securely at the top and that beneath\r\nhis weight it would not move noisily out of its present position.\r\n\r\nAssured that it seemed secure, Thandar ran up it with the noiseless\r\ncelerity of a cat. Gingerly he stepped upon the roof, not knowing the\r\nmanner of its construction, which might be weak thatching that would\r\ngive beneath him and precipitate him into the interior beneath.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise and consternation he found that the roof was of wood,\r\nand quite as solid as one could imagine. It had been his plan to enter\r\nthe temple from above, but now it seemed that he was to be thwarted,\r\nfor he could not hope to cut silently through a wooden roof with his\r\nparang in the few hours that intervened before dawn.\r\n\r\nHe stooped to examine the roof minutely with eyes and fingers. The\r\nmoonlight was brilliant. In it he could see quite well. He pulled\r\naway the thin palm frond thatch. Beneath were shingles hand hewn from\r\nbillian. In each was a small square hole through which was passed a\r\nstrip of rattan that bound the shingle to the frame of the roof.\r\n\r\nThandar lifted away the thatching over a little space some two feet\r\nsquare. Then he inserted the point of his keen parang beneath a rattan\r\ntie string, and an instant later had lifted aside a shingle. Another\r\nand another followed the first until an opening in the roof had been\r\nmade large enough to easily admit his body.\r\n\r\nThandar leaned over and peered into the darkness beneath. He could see\r\nnothing. His own body was between the moon and the hole in the roof,\r\nshutting out the rays of the satellite from the interior.\r\n\r\nThe man lowered his legs cautiously over the edge of the hole. Feeling\r\nabout, his feet came in contact with a rafter. A moment later his whole\r\nbody had disappeared within the temple. Clinging to the edge of the\r\nhole with one hand, Thandar squatted upon the rafter above the temple\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nNow that his body no longer clogged the aperture in the roof the\r\nmoonlight poured through it throwing a brilliant flood upon a portion\r\nof the floor at the opposite side of the interior. The balance was\r\nfeebly lighted by the diffused moonlight.\r\n\r\nThe temple seemed to consist of a single large room. In the center was\r\na raised platform, and also about the walls. From the rafters hung\r\nbaskets containing human skulls--one swung directly in the moonlight\r\nbeneath Thandar. He could see its grisly contents plainly.\r\n\r\nHis eyes followed the moonlight toward the area which it touched upon\r\nthe far side of the room. It reminded Waldo Emerson of a spot light\r\nthrown from the gallery of a theater upon the stage.\r\n\r\nDirectly in the center of the light a woman lay asleep upon the\r\nplatform. Thandar's heart stood still. About her figure was wrapped the\r\nglossy hide of Nagoola. Over one bare, brown arm billowed a wealth\r\nof thick, black hair, fine as silk, upon the third finger of the left\r\nhand blazed a large solitaire. The woman's face was turned toward the\r\nwall--but Thandar knew that he could not be mistaken--it was Nadara.\r\n\r\nFrom the rafter upon which he squatted to the floor below was not over\r\ntwelve or fifteen feet. Thandar swung downward, clinging to the rafter\r\nwith his hands, and dropped, cat-like, upon his naked feet to the floor\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe almost noiseless descent was sufficient, however, to awaken the\r\nsleeper. With the quickness of a panther she swung around and was\r\nupon her feet facing the man almost at the instant he alighted. The\r\nmoonlight was now full upon her face. Thandar rushed forward to take\r\nher in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Nadara!\" he whispered. \"Thank God!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl shrank back. She recognized the voice and the figure; but--her\r\nThandar was dead! How could it be that he had returned from death? She\r\nwas frightened.\r\n\r\nThe man saw the evident terror of her action, and paused.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Nadara?\" he asked. \"Don't you know me? Don't you\r\nknow Thandar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thandar is dead,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nThe man laughed. In a few words he explained that he had been stunned,\r\nbut not killed, by the earthquake. Then he came to her side and took\r\nher in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Do I feel like a dead man?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe put her arms about his neck and drew his face down to hers. She was\r\nsobbing. Thandar's back was toward the doorway of the temple. Nadara\r\nwas facing it. As she raised her eyes to his again her face went deadly\r\nwhite, and she dragged and pushed him suddenly out of the brilliant\r\npatch of moonlight.\r\n\r\n\"The guard!\" she whispered. \"I just saw something move beyond the door.\"\r\n\r\nThandar stepped behind one of the tree trunks that supported the roof,\r\nlooking toward the entrance. Yes, there was a man even now coming into\r\nthe temple. His eyes were wide with surprise as he glanced upward\r\ntoward the hole in the roof. Then he looked in the direction of the\r\nplatform upon which Nadara had been sleeping. When he saw that it was\r\nempty he ran back to the doorway and called his companion.\r\n\r\nAs he did so Thandar grasped Nadara's hand and drew her around the\r\nopposite side of the temple where the shadows were blackest, toward the\r\ndoorway. They had reached the end of the room when the two warriors\r\ncame running in, jabbering excitedly. One of them had passed half-way\r\nacross the temple, and Thandar and Nadara had almost reached the door\r\nwhen the second savage caught sight of them. With a cry of warning to\r\nhis companion he turned upon them with drawn parang.\r\n\r\nAs the fellow rushed forward Thandar drew the pistol the pirates had\r\ngiven him and fired point blank at the fellow's breast. With a howl the\r\nman staggered back and collapsed upon the floor. Then his fellow rushed\r\nto the attack.\r\n\r\nThandar had no time to reload. He handed the weapon to Nadara.\r\n\r\n\"In the pouch at my right side are cartridges,\" he said. \"Get out\r\nseveral of them, and when I can I will reload.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke they had been edging toward the doorway. From the street\r\nbeyond they could already hear excited voices raised in questioning.\r\nThe shot had aroused the village.\r\n\r\nNow the fellow with the parang was upon them. Thandar was clumsy with\r\nthe unaccustomed weapon with which he tried to meet the attack of the\r\nskilled savage. There could have been but one outcome to the unequal\r\nstruggle had not Nadara, always quick-witted and resourceful, snatched\r\na long spear from the temple wall.\r\n\r\nAs she dragged it down there fell with it a clattering skull that broke\r\nupon the floor between the fighters. A howl of dismay and rage broke\r\nfrom the lips of the head-hunter. This was sacrilege. The holy of the\r\nholies had been profaned. With renewed ferocity he leaped to close\r\nquarters with Thandar, but at the same instant Nadara lunged the sharp\r\npointed spear into his side, his guard dropped and Thandar's parang\r\nfell full upon his skull.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" cried Nadara. \"Make your escape the way you came. There is\r\nno hope for you if you remain. I will tell them that the two guards\r\nfought between themselves for me--that one killed the other, and that I\r\nshot the victor to save myself. They will believe me--I will tell them\r\nthat I have always had the pistol hidden beneath my robe. Good-bye, my\r\nThandar. We cannot both escape. If you remain we may both die--you,\r\ncertainly.\"\r\n\r\nThandar shook his head vehemently.\r\n\r\n\"We shall both go--or both die,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nNadara pressed his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad,\" was all that she said.\r\n\r\nThe savages were pouring from their long houses. The street before the\r\ntemple was filling with them. To attempt to escape in that direction\r\nwould have been but suicidal.\r\n\r\n\"Is there no other exit?\" asked Thandar.\r\n\r\n\"There is a small window in the back of the temple,\" replied Nadara,\r\n\"in a little room that is sometimes used as a prison for those who are\r\nto die, but it lets out into another street which by this time is\r\nprobably filled with natives.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is the floor,\" cried Thandar. \"We will try the floor there.\"\r\n\r\nHe ran to the main entrance to the temple, and closed the doors. Then\r\nhe dragged the two corpses before them, and a long wooden bench. There\r\nwas no other movable thing in the temple that had any considerable\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThis done he took Nadara's hand and together the two ran for the little\r\nroom. Here again they barricaded the door, and Thandar turned toward\r\nthe floor. With his parang he pried up a board--it was laid but roughly\r\nupon the light logs that were the beams. Another was removed with equal\r\nease, and then he lowered Nadara to the ground beneath the temple.\r\n\r\nClinging to the piling, Thandar replaced the boards above his head\r\nbefore he, too, dropped to the ground at Nadara's side. The streets\r\nupon either side of the temple were filled with savages. They could\r\nhear them congregating before the entrance to the temple where all was\r\nnow quiet and still within. They were bolstering their courage by much\r\nshouting to the point that would permit them to enter and investigate.\r\nThey called the names of the guards, but there was no response.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the pistol,\" said Thandar.\r\n\r\nHe loaded it, keeping several cartridges ready in his hand. Then, with\r\nNadara at his side, he crept to the back of the temple. Pigs, routed\r\nfrom their slumbers, grunted and complained. A dog growled at them.\r\nThandar silenced it with a cut from his parang. When they reached the\r\nedge of the shadow beneath the temple they saw that there were only a\r\nfew natives upon this side of the structure, and they were hurrying\r\nrapidly toward the front of the building. A hundred yards away was the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nNow a sudden quiet fell upon the horde before the temple doors. There\r\nwas the sound of hammering, then a pushing, scraping noise, and\r\npresently shouts of savage rage--the dead bodies of the guardsmen\r\nhad been discovered. Now, from above, came the padding of naked feet\r\nrunning through the temple. The street behind was momentarily deserted.\r\n\r\n\"Now!\" whispered Thandar.\r\n\r\nHe seized Nadara's hand, and together the two raced from beneath the\r\ntemple out into the moonlight and across the intervening space between\r\nthe long houses toward the jungle. Half-way across, a belated native,\r\nemerging from the verandah of a nearby house, saw them. He set up a\r\nterrific yell and dashed toward them.\r\n\r\nThandar's pistol roared, and the savage dropped; but the signal had\r\nbeen given and before the two reached the jungle a screaming horde of\r\nwarriors was upon their heels.\r\n\r\nThandar was confused. He had lost his bearings since entering the\r\nvillage and the temple. He turned toward Nadara.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know the way to the coast,\" he cried.\r\n\r\nThe girl took his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me,\" she said, and to the memories of each leaped the\r\nrecollection of the night she had led him through the forest from the\r\ncliffs of the bad men. Once again was Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones, the\r\nlearned, indebted to the greater wisdom of the unlettered cave girl for\r\nhis salvation.\r\n\r\nUnerringly Nadara ran through the tangled jungle in the direction of\r\nthe coast. Though she had been but once over the way she followed the\r\ndirect line as unerringly as though each tree was blazed and sign posts\r\nmarked each turn.\r\n\r\nBehind them came the noise of the pursuit, but always Nadara and\r\nThandar fled ahead of it, not once did it gain upon them during the\r\nlong hours of flight.\r\n\r\nIt was noon before they reached the coast. They came out at the camp\r\nof the pirates, but to Thandar's dismay it was deserted. Tsao Ming had\r\nwaited the allotted time and gone. If Thandar had but known it, the\r\npicturesque cut-throat had overstayed the promised period, and had but\r\nscarce left when the fugitives emerged from the jungle beside the\r\nbeach. In fact his rude craft was but out of sight beyond the northern\r\npromontory. A pistol shot would have recalled him; but Thandar did not\r\nknow it, and so he turned dejectedly to search for the hidden canoe.\r\n\r\nIt lay behind the little clump of bushes that had hidden Thandar the\r\nmorning that he had saved Tsao Ming's life, several hundred yards to\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nAll signs of pursuit had now ceased, and so the two walked slowly in\r\nthe direction of the craft. They found it just where Tsao Ming had\r\npromised that it would be. It was well and staunchly repaired, and in\r\naddition contained a goodly supply of food and water. Thandar blessed\r\nTsao Ming, the unhung murderer.\r\n\r\nTogether they dragged the frail thing to the water's edge, and were\r\nabout to shove it out when, with a chorus of savage yells, a score or\r\nmore of the head-hunters leaped from the jungle and bore down upon\r\nthem. Thandar turned to meet them with drawn pistol.\r\n\r\n\"Get the canoe into the water, Nadara,\" he called to the girl. \"I will\r\nhold them off until it is launched, then we may be able to reach deep\r\nwater before they can overtake us.\"\r\n\r\nNadara struggled with the unwieldy boat which the rollers picked up\r\nand hurled back upon her each time she essayed to launch it. From\r\nthe corner of his eye Thandar saw the difficulties that the girl was\r\nhaving. Already the horde was half-way across the beach, running\r\nrapidly toward them. The man feared to fire except at close range since\r\nhis unfamiliarity with firearms rendered him an extremely poor shot.\r\nHowever, it was evident that Nadara could not launch the thing alone,\r\nand so Thandar turned his pistol upon the approaching savages, pulled\r\nthe trigger, and wheeled to assist the girl.\r\n\r\nMore by chance than skill the bullet lodged in the body of the foremost\r\nhead-hunter. The fellow rolled screaming to the sand, and as one his\r\ncompanions came to a sudden halt. But seeing that Thandar was busy\r\nwith the boat and not appearing to intend to follow up his shot they\r\npresently resumed the charge.\r\n\r\nThandar and Nadara were having all that they could attend to with the\r\ncanoe and so the savages came to the water's edge before they realized\r\ntheir proximity. When he saw them, Thandar wheeled and fired again,\r\nthen picking the canoe up bodily above his head he struggled out\r\nthrough the surf, Nadara walking by his side, steadying him.\r\n\r\nAfter them came the savages--perhaps half a dozen of the bolder,\r\nwhen suddenly a great roller caught them all, pursuers and pursued,\r\nsweeping them out into deep water. Thandar and Nadara clung to the\r\ncanoe, but the head-hunters were dragged down by the undertow.\r\n\r\nUpon the beach, yelling, threatening and gesticulating, danced thirty\r\nor forty baffled savages; but now Thandar and Nadara had crawled into\r\nthe craft, which the outgoing tide was carrying rapidly from shore, and\r\nwith the aid of the paddle were soon safely out upon the bosom of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nSafely?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPIRATES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the tide and wind carried the light craft out to sea, and the shore\r\nline sank beneath the horizon behind them, Waldo Emerson looked out\r\nupon the future as he did upon the tumbling waste of desolate water\r\nencircling them, with utter hopelessness.\r\n\r\nOnce before he had passed by a miracle through the many-sided menaces\r\nof the sea; but that he should be so fortunate again he could not hope.\r\nAnd now Nadara was with him. Before, only his own suffering and death\r\nhad been possible; now he must face the greater agony of witnessing\r\nNadara's.\r\n\r\nThe wind, blowing a steady gale, was raising a considerable sea. The\r\nvast billows rolled, one upon the heels of another, with the regularity\r\nof infantry units doubling at review. The wind and the sea seemed to\r\nhave been made to order for the frail vessel that bore Thandar and\r\nNadara. It rode the long, ponderous waves like a cork; its crude sail\r\ncaught the wind and bellied bravely to it, driving the boat swiftly\r\nover the water.\r\n\r\nAnd scarce had the shore behind them sunk forever from their sight\r\nthan dead ahead another shore line showed. Thandar could scarce believe\r\nhis eyes. He rubbed them and looked again. Then he asked Nadara to look.\r\n\r\n\"What is that ahead?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe girl half rose with an exclamation of joy.\r\n\r\n\"Land!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nAnd land it was. The wind, driving them madly, carried them toward\r\nthe north end of what appeared to be a large island. Angry breakers\r\npounded a rocky coast line. To strike there would mean instant death\r\nto them both. But would they strike? As they neared the point of the\r\nisland it became evident to Thandar that they would be borne past it.\r\nCould he hope to stem the speed of the little craft and turn it back\r\ninto the sheltered water in the lee of the land? The chances were more\r\nthan even that the canoe would capsize the instant he cut away the sail\r\nand attempted to paddle across the wind, as would be necessary to come\r\nabout the end of the island.\r\n\r\nBut there seemed no other way. He handed his parang to Nadara, telling\r\nher to be ready to cut the rawhide strips that supported the sail the\r\ninstant that he gave the word. With his paddle clutched tightly in his\r\nhands he knelt in the stern, watching the progress of the canoe past\r\nthe rocky point.\r\n\r\nAt this extremity of the island a narrow tongue of land ran far out\r\ninto the sea. It was past the outer point of this tongue that the canoe\r\nwas racing. When they had passed Thandar realized the rashness of\r\nattempting to turn the canoe into the trough of the sea even for the\r\nlittle distance that would have been necessary to make the shelter of\r\nthe point, where, almost within reach, he could see the peaceful bosom\r\nof unruffled water lying safely behind the island.\r\n\r\nAnd yet as he looked ahead upon the limitless waste of ocean before\r\nthem he knew that one risk was no greater than the other, and then an\r\nalternative plan occurred to him. He would run a short distance past\r\nthe point and then turn almost directly back and attempt to paddle the\r\ncanoe in the calm water, running nearly into the face of the wind, thus\r\navoiding the dangers of the trough.\r\n\r\nThere was but a single drawback to this plan--the question of his\r\nability to drive the canoe against the gale. At least it was worth\r\ntrying. He gave Nadara the word to cut down the sail, and at the same\r\ninstant, the canoe being upon the crest of a wave, he bent to the\r\npaddle. As the panther skin tumbled at the foot of the rough mast the\r\nnose of the craft swung around in reply to Thandar's vigorous strokes.\r\n\r\nSo intent were both upon the life and death struggle that they were\r\nwaging with the elements that neither saw the long, low-lying craft\r\nthat shot from the mouth of a small harbor behind them as they came\r\ninto view upon the lee side of the island.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the canoe hung broadside to the wind. Thandar struggled\r\nfrantically to carry it about. Down they dropped into the trough of a\r\ngreat sea. Above them hung the overleaning tower of the wave's crest\r\nready to topple upon them its tons of water. The canoe rose, still\r\nbroadside, almost to the crest of the wave--then the thing broke upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen Thandar came to the surface his first thought was for Nadara. He\r\nlooked about as he shook the water from his eyes. Almost at his side\r\nNadara's head rose from the sea. As her eyes met his a smile touched\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\n\"This is better,\" she shouted. \"Now we can reach shore,\" and turning\r\nshe struck out for land.\r\n\r\nJust behind her swam Thandar. He knew that Nadara was like a fish in\r\nwater, but he doubted her ability as he doubted his own to reach the\r\nshore in the face of both wind and tide. A wave carried them high in\r\nair, and from its crest both saw simultaneously a long craft in the\r\nhollow beneath them, and noted the fierce aspect of her crew.\r\n\r\nNadara, fearing all men but Thandar, would have attempted to elude the\r\ncraft, but the glimpse that the man had had of those aboard her had\r\nconvinced him that he had fallen by good fortune into the company of\r\nTsao Ming and his crew.\r\n\r\n\"They are friends,\" he screamed to Nadara, and so they let the boat\r\ncome alongside and pick them up; but no sooner had Thandar obtained a\r\ngood look at the occupants than he discovered that never a face among\r\nthem had he seen before.\r\n\r\nThey were of the same type as Tsao Ming's motley horde, nor did Waldo\r\nEmerson need inquire their vocation--thief and murderer were writ upon\r\nevery countenance. They jabbered questions at Nadara and Thandar in an\r\nassortment of dialects which neither could understand, and it was only\r\nafter the craft had been anchored in the little bay and the party had\r\nwaded to shore that Thandar tried speaking with them in pidgin English.\r\nSeveral among them understood him, and he was not long in making it\r\nplain to them that they would be paid well if they carried him and\r\nNadara to a civilized port.\r\n\r\nThe leader, who seemed to be a full blooded negro, laughed at him,\r\nridiculing the idea that an almost naked man could pay for his liberty.\r\nAt the same time the fellow cast such greedy glances at Nadara that\r\nThandar became convinced that the fellow, for reasons of his own,\r\npreferred not to believe that they could pay in money for their\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the party had been about to embark for another portion\r\nof the western coast of the island where the main body of the horde\r\nlay. They had but been waiting for three of their crew who had gone\r\ninland hunting, when they had seen the canoe and put out to capture\r\nits occupants. Now they returned to the little harbor to pick up their\r\nfellows, and continue toward the main camp.\r\n\r\nThe black was for dispatching Thandar at once as their boat was already\r\novercrowded, but there were others who counselled him against it,\r\nreminding him of the probable anger of their chief, who saw only in a\r\ndead prisoner the loss of a possible ransom.\r\n\r\nAt last the hunters returned and all embarked. Soon the boat had passed\r\nout of the bay and was making its way south along the west coast of the\r\nisland. It was almost dark when her nose was turned toward shore and\r\nthe long sweeps brought into play as the sail sagged to the foot of the\r\nmast.\r\n\r\nBetween two small, overlapping points that hid what lay behind,\r\nthey passed into a landlocked harbor. As the boat breasted the end\r\nof the inner point, Thandar sprang to his feet with a cry of joy\r\nand amazement. Not a hundred yards away, riding quietly upon the\r\nmirror-like surface of the water, lay the _Priscilla_.\r\n\r\nThe pirates looked at their prisoner in astonishment. The black rose\r\nwith clenched fists as though prepared to strike him.\r\n\r\n\"_Priscilla ahoy!_\" shrieked Waldo Emerson. \"Help! Help!\"\r\n\r\nThe negro grinned. There was no response from the white yacht. Then\r\nthe men told Thandar that they had captured the vessel several weeks\r\nbefore, and were holding her crew prisoners upon land awaiting the\r\nreturn of the chief who had been unaccountably absent for a long time.\r\nWhen Waldo Emerson told them that the yacht belonged to his father the\r\nblack was glad that he had not killed him, for he should bring a fat\r\nransom.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when they landed, and Thandar and Nadara were forced into\r\nsqualid huts that lay side by side with several others just above the\r\nbeach. For a long time the man could not sleep. His mind was occupied\r\nwith doubts as to the fate of his father and mother. Nadara had told\r\nhim that both had been aboard the _Priscilla_. She had said nothing of\r\nthe treatment accorded her by Mrs. Smith-Jones, but Waldo had guessed\r\nnear the truth, and he had seen that the sight of the _Priscilla_ had\r\nawakened no enthusiasm or happiness in the girl.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he dozed only to be awakened by the sound of movement\r\noutside his hut. There was something sinister in the stealthiness of\r\nthe sound. Silently Thandar rose and crept to the door. The pirates\r\nhad made no attempt to secure their prisoners--there was no possibility\r\nof their escaping from the island.\r\n\r\nThandar put his head out into the lesser darkness of the night. He\r\nmuttered a little growl of rage and fear, for what he saw was the huge,\r\ndark bulk of a man crawling into Nadara's hut. Instantly the American\r\nfollowed. At the door of the girl's shelter he paused to listen. Within\r\nhe heard a sudden exclamation of fright and the sound of a scuffle.\r\nThen he was within the darkness, and a moment later stumbled against a\r\nman. Thandar's fingers sought the throat. He made no sound. The other\r\nwheeled upon him with a knife. Thandar had expected it. His forearm\r\nwarded the first blow, and running down the forearm of the other his\r\nhand found the knife wrist. Then commenced the struggle within the\r\nStygian blackness of the interior of the hut. Back and forth across the\r\nmud floor the two staggered and reeled--the one attempting to wrench\r\nfree the hand that held the knife--the other seeking a hold upon the\r\nthroat of his antagonist while he strove to maintain his grip upon the\r\nother's wrist. The heavy breathing of the two rose and fell upon the\r\nsilence of the night--that and the scuffling of their feet were the\r\nonly sounds of combat. Nadara could not assist Thandar--she knew that\r\nit was he who had come to her rescue though she could not see him.\r\n\r\nAt last, with a superhuman effort, the night prowler broke away from\r\nThandar. For a moment silence reigned in the hut. None of the three\r\ncould see the other. From beneath his panther skin Thandar drew the\r\nlong pistol that Tsao Ming had given him, but he dared not fire for\r\nfear of hitting Nadara, nor dared he ask her to speak that he might\r\nknow her position, for then would he have divulged his own to his\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\nFor minutes that seemed hours the three stood in utter silence,\r\nendeavoring to stifle their breathing. Then Thandar heard a cautious\r\nmovement upon the opposite side of the room. Was it his foe, or\r\nNadara. He raised his pistol level with a man's breast, and then\r\nvery cautiously he too moved to one side. At the slight sound of his\r\nmovement there came a sudden flash and deafening roar from across the\r\nhut--the enemy had fired, and in the flash of his gun all within the\r\ninterior was lighted for an instant, and Thandar saw the giant black\r\nnot two paces from him, and to the man's left stood Nadara, safe from a\r\nshot from Thandar's pistol.\r\n\r\nThe black, not knowing that Thandar was armed, had not guessed that\r\nhis chance shot was to prove his own death messenger. The instant that\r\nthe flash of the other's gun revealed his whereabouts Thandar's pistol\r\ngave an answering roar, and simultaneously Thandar leaped to one side,\r\nrunning swiftly to grapple with the black from the side; but when he\r\ncame to him, instead of meeting with ferocious resistance as he had\r\nexpected, he stumbled over his dead body.\r\n\r\nBut now the whole camp was awake. The pirates were running hither and\r\nthither shouting questions and orders in their many tongues. Confusion\r\nreigned supreme, and in the midst of it Thandar grasped Nadara's hand\r\nand ran from the hut. Back of the other huts he ran until he had passed\r\nthe end of the camp. Then he turned down toward the water. It was his\r\nintention to reach a boat and make his way to the _Priscilla_.\r\n\r\nBehind them the confusion of the camp grew as the pirates searched the\r\nhuts for an explanation of the two shots--there could have been no\r\nbetter opportunity for escape. Drawn up on the beach was one of the\r\n_Priscilla's_ own boats. Together Thandar and Nadara pushed it off, and\r\na moment later were rowing rapidly toward the yacht.\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling of unbounded security and elation that Waldo\r\nEmerson clambered over the side and drew Nadara after him; but his\r\nelation was short lived for scarcely had he set foot upon the deck than\r\nhe was seized from behind by half a dozen brawny villains who had been\r\nupon guard on board the _Priscilla_ and had seen the two put off from\r\nshore, watched their flight toward the yacht and lain in wait for them\r\nas they clambered over the side.\r\n\r\nThe balance of the night they were kept prisoners upon the _Priscilla_;\r\nbut early the next morning they were taken ashore. There they found\r\nall the pirates congregated outside one of the huts. Within were\r\nthe passengers and crew of the _Priscilla_. As Thandar and Nadara\r\napproached they were seized and hustled toward the doorway--with an\r\naccompaniment of oriental oaths they were pushed into the interior.\r\n\r\nStanding about in disconsolate and unhappy groups were the crew of the\r\n_Priscilla_, Captain Burlinghame and Mr. and Mrs. Smith-Jones. As his\r\neyes fell upon the last, Waldo Emerson ran toward her with outstretched\r\narms.\r\n\r\nWith a horrified shriek Mrs. Smith-Jones dodged behind her husband\r\nand the captain. Waldo came to a sudden halt. The two men eyed him\r\nthreateningly. He looked straight into his father's face.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know me, Father,\" he asked.\r\n\r\nJohn Alden Smith-Jones' jaw dropped.\r\n\r\n\"Waldo Emerson,\" he cried. \"It cannot be possible!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith-Jones emerged from retreat.\r\n\r\n\"Waldo Emerson!\" she echoed. \"It cannot be!\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is, Mother,\" cried the young man.\r\n\r\n\"What awful apparel!\" said Mrs. Smith-Jones after she had embraced her\r\nson. Then her eyes wandered to Nadara, who had been standing in demure\r\nsilence just within the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"You?\" she gasped. \"You are not dead?\"\r\n\r\nNadara shook her head, and Waldo Emerson hastened to recount\r\nher adventures since Stark's attack upon her on the deck of the\r\n_Priscilla_. Mrs. Smith-Jones approached the girl. She placed a hand\r\nupon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I have been doing a great deal of thinking since last I saw you,\" she\r\nsaid, \"and the result of it is that I am going to do something that I\r\nhave never before done in my life--I am going to ask your pardon; I\r\ntreated you shamefully. I do not need to ask if my son loves you--you\r\nhave already told me that you love him--and his eyes have told me where\r\nhis heart lies.\r\n\r\n\"For long nights I lay awake thinking of the horror of it, and almost\r\npraying that he might be dead rather than come back to find you waiting\r\nfor him in Boston--that was before you went overboard. You had no birth\r\nor family, and that to me meant everything; but since I thought that\r\nyou were both dead I discovered that I recalled many things about you\r\nthat were infinitely to be preferred over birth and breeding.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you just what they are--only I cannot blame my son for\r\nloving you. Only you must discard that horrible garment for something\r\npresentable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\" shouted Waldo Emerson, as he threw his arms about her. \"I\r\nknew that you would love her, too, if you ever knew her.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the door opened and one of the pirates entered.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThey filed out past him. From those outside they learned that it had\r\nbeen decided to kill them all and after looting the _Priscilla_, sink\r\nher, as a man-of-war had been sighted cruising off the coast early in\r\nthe morning. In their terror they had decided to wait no longer for\r\nthe absent chief, and all thoughts of ransom were forgotten in the mad\r\ndesire to erase every vestige of their piracy.\r\n\r\nThe victims looked at one another in horror. They were entirely\r\nsurrounded by the pirates, and one by one were securely bound that\r\nthere might be no chance of any escaping. The plan was to lead them\r\ninland to the densest part of the jungle and there to cut their throats\r\nand leave their corpses to the vultures. The pirates appeared to derive\r\nmuch pleasure in recounting their plan to the prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt last all were bound and the death march commenced. The last of the\r\nlong line of hope forsaken prisoners and brutal, gibing cut-throats\r\nhad disappeared in the jungle when a rude craft made its way into the\r\nharbor. At sight of the _Priscilla_ it hesitated and prepared to fly,\r\nbut seeing no sign of life aboard it, approached, and finding the decks\r\ndeserted, mounted. In the cabins the newcomers discovered two Malays\r\nasleep. These they awoke with much laughter and rude jests.\r\n\r\nThe two guards leaped to their feet, feeling for their pistols; but\r\nwhen they saw who had surprised them they grinned broadly and jabbered\r\nvolubly. They addressed all their remarks to a huge and villainous\r\nfellow whom they called chief. He it was whom the pirates had awaited,\r\nand whose prolonged absence had resulted in the determination to\r\nexecute the prisoners of the _Priscilla_.\r\n\r\nWhen the chief learned of what was going on in the jungle he cursed\r\nand bellowed in rage. He saw many thousand liangs of sycee evaporating\r\nbefore his eyes. Shouting orders to his fellows to follow him he leaped\r\ninto the craft that had brought them to the _Priscilla_, and a moment\r\nlater was pushing rapidly toward the shore. Without waiting to draw the\r\nboat upon the beach the chief plunged into the jungle, his men at his\r\nheels.\r\n\r\nFar ahead of him trudged the weary and fear-sickened prisoners, lashed\r\nonward with sticks and the flats of murderous parangs. At last the\r\npirates halted in a tangled mass of vegetation.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said one; but another thought they should proceed a little\r\nfurther. For a few minutes the two men argued, then the first drew his\r\nparang and advanced upon Thandar.\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" he insisted and swung the blade about his head.\r\n\r\nA sudden crashing of the underbrush and loud and angry shouts\r\ncaused him to turn his eyes in the direction of the interruption.\r\nThe prisoners, too, looked. What they saw was not particularly\r\nreassuring--only another very ferocious appearing and exceeding\r\nwrathful pirate followed by a half dozen other villains.\r\n\r\nHe rushed into the midst of the group, knocking men to right and left.\r\nThe wicked looking fellows who had bullied and cowed the frightened\r\nprisoners but a few moments before now looked the picture of abject\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nThe chief came to a halt before the man with the bared parang. His face\r\nwas livid, and working spasmodically with rage and excitement. He tried\r\nto speak, and then he turned his eyes upon Thandar, standing there\r\nbound ready for decapitation. As his gaze fell upon this prisoner his\r\neyes went wide, and then he turned upon the would-be executioner, and\r\nwith a mighty blow felled him.\r\n\r\nThat seemed to loose his tongue, and from his mouth flowed a torrent\r\nof the most awful abuse the prisoners had ever heard. It was directed\r\ntoward the men who had dared contemplate this thing without his\r\nsanction, and principally against the cowering unfortunate who had not\r\ndared rise from where his chief's heavy fist had sprawled him.\r\n\r\n\"And you would have killed Thandar,\" he shrieked. \"Thandar, who saved\r\nmy life!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he fell to kicking the prostrate man until Thandar himself was\r\nforced to intercede in the wretch's behalf.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of Tsao Ming the troubles of the prisoners evaporated\r\nin thin air, for when he found that the owner of the _Priscilla_ was\r\nThandar's father he restored the yacht and all the loot that his men\r\nhad taken from it to their rightful owners. Nor would he have stopped\r\nthere had they permitted him to have his way, which was no less than\r\nto behead half a dozen of his unfortunate lieutenants who had been\r\nover-zealous in the performance of their piratical duties.\r\n\r\nTsao Ming's picturesque villains replenished the water casks of the\r\n_Priscilla_ and carried aboard her a sufficient stock of provisions to\r\ninsure her company a plentiful table to Honolulu, the port they had\r\nchosen as their first stop.\r\n\r\nAnd when the preparations were completed a dozen piratical prahus\r\nescorted the white yacht a hundred miles upon her northward journey,\r\nfiring a farewell salute with volley after volley from the little,\r\nbrass six-pounders in their bows.\r\n\r\nAs the tiny fleet diminished to mere specks astern, disappearing\r\nbeneath the southern horizon, a white flanneled man with close cropped\r\nblonde hair, and a slender, black haired girl in simple shirt waist and\r\nduck skirt watched them from the deck of the _Priscilla_.\r\n\r\nAn involuntary sigh escaped the lips of each, and they turned and\r\nlooked into one another's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"We are leaving a cruel world that has been kind to us,\" said the man,\r\n\"for with all its cruelties it gave us each other and reunited us when\r\nwe were separated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will civilization be more kind?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\nThandar shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHOMEWARD BOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Honolulu Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones and Nadara were married. Before\r\nthe ceremony there had been some discussion as to what name should be\r\nused in describing Nadara in the formal contract.\r\n\r\n\"Nadara\" alone seemed too brief and meaningless to the precise Mrs.\r\nSmith-Jones; but Waldo Emerson and the girl insisted that it was her\r\nname and all-sufficient. So, in lieu of another name, it was finally\r\ndecided by all that \"Nadara\" could not be legally improved upon.\r\n\r\nPrior to the ceremony, which took place on board the _Priscilla_, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. John Alden Smith-Jones, Captain Cecil Burlinghame, several\r\ninvited guests from amongst officials and friends in Honolulu, and the\r\ncrew of the _Priscilla_ presented gifts to the bride.\r\n\r\nCaptain Burlinghame in presenting his proffered a few words in\r\nexplanation of it.\r\n\r\n\"To you, Nadara,\" he said, \"these trinkets will hold a deeper meaning\r\nand a greater value than to another, for they come from your own\r\nforgotten island, where they lay for twenty years until, by chance,\r\nI picked them up close by the sea. The poor lady to whom they once\r\nbelonged you never knew--it is quite possible that she never was upon\r\nyour savage coast--and how her jewels came there must always remain a\r\nmystery. But two things you hold in common with her, for she was a lady\r\nand she was very beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nHe held toward Nadara in his open palm a little worn bag of the skins\r\nof small rodents, sewn together with bits of gut. At sight of it both\r\nthe girl and Waldo Emerson exclaimed in astonishment.\r\n\r\nNadara took the bag wonderingly in her hands and dumped the contents\r\ninto her palm. Waldo pressed forward.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know to whom those belonged?\" he asked Burlinghame.\r\n\r\n\"To Eugenie Marie Celeste de la Valois, Countess of Crecy,\" replied the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"They belonged to Nadara's mother,\" returned Waldo. \"Her foster parents\r\nwere present at her birth and took these jewels from the poor woman's\r\nbody after she had passed away. She was washed ashore in a boat in\r\nwhich there was only a dead man beside herself--Nadara was born that\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, when the clergyman had performed the marriage ceremony he\r\nentered upon the certificate in the space provided there for the name\r\nof the woman: Nadara de la Valois.\r\n\r\nAnd they are living in Boston now in a wonderful home that you have\r\nseen if you ever have been to Boston and been driven about in one of\r\nthose great sight-seeing motor busses, for the place is pointed out to\r\nall visitors because of the beauty of its architecture and the fame\r\nthat attaches to the historic and aristocratic name of its owner,\r\nwhich, as it happens, is not Smith-Jones at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_There's More to Follow!_\r\n\r\n\r\n More stories of the sort you like; more, probably, by the author of\r\n this one; more than 500 titles all told by writers of world-wide\r\n reputation, in the Authors Alphabetical List which you will find on\r\n the _reverse side_ of the wrapper of this book.
