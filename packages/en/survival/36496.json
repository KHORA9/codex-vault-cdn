BOURGUIGNON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNations, during the successive phases of their evolution on the globe,\r\nin which they advance from a state of infancy and barbarism to one of\r\nvirility and civilization, from civilization to decadence or senility;\r\nand from decadence to their final extinction, are liable to numberless\r\ncalamities.\r\n\r\nThese calamities are produced by moral causes, and are then called\r\nsocial Revolutions; and in other instances from physical causes, and\r\nthen they are termed Cataclysms, Epidemics, or Epizootics.\r\n\r\nIn these crises, the initiative and devotion of individuals, the public\r\nadministration, and the application of knowledge acquired in the Arts\r\nand Sciences, afford collectively an infallible criterion for\r\nascertaining the position which a nation occupies in the scale of\r\ncivilization, and the value of its religious, social, and political\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nCalamities always leave behind them disasters and victims, but they\r\nbequeath also a precious legacy. Nations which are called upon for fresh\r\nand progressive efforts, find in the experience they have gained a new\r\nsource of strength and means of future greatness. I am convinced that\r\nthis will be the case with England; though, helpless for the moment, and\r\nunable to stay the Cattle Plague which now ravages her entire extent,\r\nshe will in future be found better prepared to resist the inroads of\r\nsuch a direful enemy.\r\n\r\nNo branch of human knowledge has been more rudely tested during the\r\npresent epizootic than medical science. Many persons have been astounded\r\nat its helplessness; but if they had reflected at what a distance\r\nmedicine has to follow in the wake of the exact sciences by which it is\r\nfurnished with instruments for prosecuting its researches,--that\r\norganic chemistry progresses but slowly,--that the Cattle Plague was\r\nentirely unknown to the present generation of medical men in\r\nEngland,--and that the means for its scientific and practical study have\r\nbeen therefore wholly wanting, they would have been less surprised to\r\nfind that it is as difficult to cure the Cattle Plague as it, is to cure\r\nphthisis, cancer, hydrophobia, and the cholera, against which medicine\r\nbut too often is of little avail.\r\n\r\nIn times of great national calamity it behoves every one to contribute\r\nin proportion to his talents, fortune, or abilities, to alleviate the\r\neffects of the common misfortune. The poor man's mite, and the honest\r\nintention of the most insignificant, when added to the budget of common\r\nefforts, have their relative value; and it is for these reasons that I\r\nhave published the following monograph on the Cattle Plague.\r\n\r\nIf it assists in any way to the extinction of the present epizootic, or\r\nif it serve to point out the necessity of combining the study of\r\ncomparative pathology with that of medicine, I shall feel that I have\r\ncontributed something which may favour my claim to be enrolled among the\r\ncitizens of England.\r\n\r\nThis book, as may easily be seen, was originally written in my native\r\nlanguage. A few kind and obliging friends--more particularly Mr. Taylor\r\nSinnett, Drs. Clapton and Gervis, of St. Thomas's Hospital, and Mr.\r\nBerridge, of the British Museum--have rendered me the greatest\r\nassistance in the translation. Without the guidance of such competent\r\nauxiliaries I could not have performed my arduous task.\r\n\r\nI therefore beg to return to those gentlemen, and to all those who have\r\nassisted me on this occasion, my sincerest and most grateful thanks.\r\n\r\n  H.

But why should we\r\nborrow this sinister and gloomy denomination from the middle ages and\r\nfrom the people's vocabulary? Is this, then, an unknown and incurable\r\ndisease? Is this the first time that it has made its appearance on the\r\nsoil of Great Britain? To judge by the manner in which the diffusion of\r\nthis complaint has been met, accounted for, explained, and discussed,\r\none might imagine it was so; and yet the mere observation of its causes,\r\nits symptoms, and its signs and effects on the bodies of the diseased\r\nanimals, besides a few references to the medical library, would easily\r\nhave testified that nature did not wait until the second half of the\r\n19th century to generate a new distemper. No! Nothing new has appeared\r\nfor a long time in the worlds of space. The cosmic phenomena pursue\r\ntheir perpetual course, and the organic phenomena, _à fortiori_, do the\r\nsame. Life, throughout the whole range of the animal kingdom, whatever\r\nmay be its changes and fluctuations, submits to the fixed and invariable\r\nlaws which hold dominion over health and disease. Our presumption and\r\nignorance alone can account for the astonishment we manifest, not only\r\nwhen we witness great general calamities, but even when we look upon\r\nthose simple morbid derangements which organic matter, both animal and\r\nvegetable, is continually undergoing on the globe, in the natural\r\nprogress of destruction and dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe habit we most of us have contracted of confining our observations to\r\nthe phenomena which strike our eyes, instead of fixing them on the\r\ngeneral causes by which these phenomena have been produced; the\r\nforgetfulness of some, in others the want of acquaintance with general\r\nand comparative pathology, have in this instance led many conscientious\r\ninquirers to misapprehend both the nature and the treatment of the\r\ncattle complaint. It is in vain that we have subdivided and classed\r\nmedical science--in vain that we have arbitrarily instituted a\r\nveterinary medicine and a human medicine; nature, in her acts, has no\r\nsuch subtleties. With nature, organic matter is organic matter, life is\r\nlife; and although it may be true that both organic matter and life\r\nbecome more complex, and continue to rise in perfection till they reach\r\nman, it is quite as true that the laws of pathology and physiology are\r\nthe same in all, and that it is just as difficult to cure the typhus of\r\nthe ox as that of man. As, therefore, it is because we overlooked these\r\nfundamental truths, that the outbreak of the cattle distemper found us\r\nunprepared, we must treat the subject with all the gravity which is its\r\ndue.\r\n\r\nLet it not, however, be feared that the special fact of the _so-called_\r\nCattle Plague will be lost sight of amidst a crowd of scientific\r\ngeneralities. No; collateral reflections, seemingly foreign to the main\r\nargument, will concur to elucidate it; and all these rays of light will\r\nconverge to a common centre, reflecting, we flatter ourselves, some\r\nevident facts and practical truths.\r\n\r\nThis work on the contagious typhus of the ox is divided into four\r\nprincipal parts.\r\n\r\nThe first part contains the history of this typhus from the remotest\r\ntimes down to the present day. It is divided into several sections.\r\n\r\nThe second part, which gives the description of the disease, is\r\nsubdivided into four chapters.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter treats of general typhus, in order that a perfect\r\nunderstanding may be arrived at as to the name and definition of the\r\nparticular distemper which affects the ox.\r\n\r\nThe second relates to the causes and origin of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe third treats of its symptoms, its progress, &c.\r\n\r\nThe fourth contains its mode of treatment.\r\n\r\nThe third part gives some plain instructions for the benefit of farmers,\r\ncattle-dealers, and dairymen.\r\n\r\nThe fourth part gives a development of the scientific means and\r\nsafeguards to be adopted, in order that this country shall never relapse\r\ninto that state of helpless panic to which a want of preparation exposed\r\nit when the present epizootia began its ravages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PART.\r\n\r\n    _The History of the Contagious Typhus of the Ox, from the\r\n      remotest times down to the present day._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nGeneral, local, and particular causes of destruction are constantly\r\nreacting on organized creatures, and these causes account for those\r\n_epiphytic_ diseases which infest plants, the _epizootic_ diseases which\r\nspread mortality among the brute creation, and the _epidemic_, which\r\nstrike and are fatal to the human species. Thus it is that we\r\nparticularize at present, in the vegetable kingdom, the disease which\r\nhas attacked the vines, olive-trees, and potatoes; in the animal\r\nkingdom, the silkworm sickness, and the cholera, and the typhoid fever\r\nof cattle: so that we may safely say, that one or other of these\r\ndiseases is always, at a given moment, raging in some part of the globe\r\namong some species of animal, either birds, pigs, horses, sheep, horned\r\ncattle, or, in fine, attacks man himself.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the peccant invasion falls only on the vegetables and\r\nanimals situated at our antipodes, we seldom hear of the ravages it\r\ncommits; and when we do, forgetful of the affinity which links together\r\nall the organic beings on the earth and their mutual dependence, nothing\r\ncan exceed the indifference we show to these calamities. Then, when the\r\ndanger threatens us nearer home, or when the evil has invaded us, we\r\nhave recourse to quarantine as the grand preservative to shield us. But\r\nthis preservative remedy is most frequently deceptive--a mere illusion;\r\nfor the real plague, typhus and cholera, borne along by the winds of\r\nheaven, pass over the longest distances and the highest obstacles, and\r\nbaffle all our calculations; teaching us, by their successive returns,\r\nthat we shall continually be exposed to their destructive havoc so long\r\nas we neglect to eradicate the evil at its original source, that is, in\r\nthose countries from which it emanates.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the place to observe, that the cholera morbus threatens to\r\nkeep a permanent footing in the English possessions of India, because\r\nthe public works, by means of which the great rivers used to be confined\r\nto their beds, have not of late been repaired and kept in good order in\r\nthose countries; owing to which neglect, their waters overflow the\r\nplains, leaving, when they subside, those pestilential deposits which\r\nafford a perpetual incubation to the cholera.\r\n\r\nWe are induced to dwell thus on the general causes of these diseases,\r\nbecause the sick plants, on which dumb animals feed, and the sick\r\nanimals, on which man himself feeds, have a continual relation of cause\r\nand effect; and we shall have to refer to this subject and give it\r\nweight, when we come to speak of the treatment of these diseases.\r\n\r\nIt is an important fact, which deserves our most pointed attention and\r\nconsideration, that the vital resistance inherent in the animal frame to\r\nwithstand the attacks of these contagious diseases, is very far from\r\nbeing the same throughout the whole kind. Man, in this respect, is the\r\nmost favoured and best fortified; he is able, without much\r\ndegenerating, to inhabit any latitude, to go with a sort of impunity, if\r\nhis calling require him to do so, amidst the most pestilential\r\nemanations, and to continue for hours inhaling their baneful fumes. We\r\ncould quote many striking examples of this resisting power in man. But\r\nthere is one which we have recently witnessed, and which all can\r\nappreciate. We refer to the slaughter-house of the great Metropolitan\r\nMarket. Here we saw, in lumps and fragments, every variety of corrupt\r\n_detritus_ of animals which had been seized with the contagious typhus;\r\nwe saw the animals, too, being felled and slaughtered and dissected, in\r\na high temperature which rendered the air so poisonous that we could\r\nhardly breathe it; yet amidst all this infection the workmen employed to\r\nmove and handle these revolting wrecks appeared indifferent to the\r\nscene, and quite in their usual health. No living animal besides man\r\ncould stand such a trial; no other could breathe for hours, and day\r\nafter day, like these workmen, an atmosphere so charged with decomposing\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\nWe say, therefore, that man may expose himself, with less danger to his\r\nlife than any other animal, to those pernicious causes which produce and\r\ndevelop contagious diseases. Next to him, with respect to this power of\r\nvital resistance, come the omnivorous animals, then the carnivorous, and\r\nlast of all, the herbivorous, in which this faculty is very feeble\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nThis prime consideration, to be fully understood and appreciated by\r\nunscientific readers, would require explanations beyond the scope of\r\nthis work. Let us, however, for the present establish the fact, that\r\nherbivorous animals, such as sheep and horned cattle, offer but a very\r\nweak resistance to the causes which generate infectious and epizootic\r\ndiseases, and let us do our best to prove it by demonstration; for if\r\nthis truth be once admitted, we shall therefrom deduce that it is the\r\nduty of man constantly to surround these frail and delicate creatures\r\nwith special care and attention, if he wishes to prevent their being\r\ndecimated from time to time, and if he would likewise avoid the\r\nconsequent injuries to himself--the loss of health and money accruing\r\nfrom this deterioration.\r\n\r\nSo long as the herbivorous or grass-eating animal is properly fed; so\r\nlong as he browses on fat pastures; so long as his blood retains those\r\nphysiological elements which are the prime condition of health, he can,\r\nand does, resist the causes of most contagious maladies. But if a hot\r\nsummer and a long continuance of dry weather chance to curtail, in\r\ntemperate zones, the usual abundance of his fodder, then comes the fatal\r\nchange: the blood is impoverished, the secretions are debilitated, a\r\nstrange languor runs through the system, the vital resistance is\r\nunnerved, and he becomes an easy prey to those noxious influences which\r\nwere encountered before without injury whilst his provision was\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nThis is a fundamental matter. We therefore beg leave to support and\r\njustify our argument by borrowing some additional evidence from prior\r\nlabours of ours, accomplished at the Ecole d'Alfort, near Paris,\r\nconjointly with Professor Delafond, whose name has so often been cited\r\nin the public journals in connexion with the cattle plague.\r\n\r\nAll vegetables and animals; with the exception of _adult_ men, whenever\r\ntheir health declines from any cause (but more particularly from\r\npaucity of food), spontaneously generate microscopic parasites, or very\r\nminute insects, the germs of which are inherent in their system. A flock\r\nof fleecy animals, wasted by deficient food in dry and parched meadows,\r\nbecomes attacked in due time by a parasitical cutaneous disease, known\r\nas the _itch_, which is enough, if not checked, to destroy the whole.\r\nNow, all that is required is to remove this flock to a more fertile\r\nsoil, where there is plenty to feed them, and the disease will disappear\r\nof itself without any treatment. Deficiency of food destroys the health\r\nof animals, and abundance of food overcomes disease in them.\r\n\r\nA sheep affected by this parasitical disease may, without any fear, be\r\nplaced in a flock of healthy sheep, for he will not propagate the\r\ndistemper; but if instead of being sound and healthy, the flock is in a\r\nweak declining state, this contaminated animal will diffuse the disease\r\nwith frightful rapidity, and may cause their entire destruction. These\r\nfacts may seem startling, but we are only speaking after the\r\nincontestable authority of experiments.\r\n\r\nWe selected six healthy sheep, which we kept well supplied with\r\nprovisions; we covered these healthy sheep with parasites (acari). On\r\nevery one of these sound, well-fed sheep, the microscopic animalculæ\r\ndied off without generating the cutaneous disease; for the blood, the\r\nhumours, and the skin of sound and healthy sheep constitute a soil\r\nunfavourable to the propagation of these parasites, and actually starve\r\nthem to death.\r\n\r\nAfter this first experiment, we subjected these six sheep to a deficient\r\ndiet; they grew lean, their blood was impoverished, and then all we had\r\nto do was to lay upon them not thousands and thousands of these\r\nparasites--as we had done in the first instance--but one solitary female\r\nin a state of fecundity; and the parasitical distemper unfolded itself\r\nso fiercely as to cause the death of three of these sheep on which the\r\ntest was allowed to run its course; whilst the other three sheep, having\r\nbeen restored in time to a recoverable condition just as they were about\r\nto drop off, were thoroughly cured, without any special treatment, by\r\nthe sole influence of good food and ordinary hygienic attention.\r\n\r\nOther tests, similar to these experiments, were applied to dogs, horses,\r\nand horned cattle. A lean and scraggy dog, covered with parasites and\r\neruptions, with eyes running foul humour, a dog which could neither run\r\nnor stand, and which was reduced to the last stage of wasting marasmus,\r\nwas rescued from the jaws of death and thoroughly cured without special\r\ntreatment, by the sole influence of a rich restorative diet. This dog\r\nafterwards became a fine hunting hound, beautiful in shape, and\r\nadmirable for his sportive attributes.\r\n\r\nThese experiments having been submitted to the judgment of the Académie\r\ndes Sciences in Paris, were honoured with its approval, and the reports\r\nconcerning them were printed at the Academy's expense, and crowned at\r\nthe competitive examination.\r\n\r\nThe vital resistance of horned cattle is so feeble, that those animals\r\nwhich are periodically exhibited in the north of London, though\r\ncertainly chosen from among the most healthy and robust, could not herd\r\ntogether in large numbers for the space of a month in the Agricultural\r\nHall at Islington, without sinking under infectious and contagious\r\ndiseases--almost one and all. Under the conditions in which we see them\r\nin that Show, a single month would be sufficient to produce almost their\r\ncomplete destruction; for even a single week, which is the usual\r\nduration of their confinement, affects them so much as to render a large\r\nproportion of them unhealthy.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows how apt cavalry horses are to sicken and die off during\r\na campaign. Every one has heard of the fearful ravages amongst the\r\nhorses of the Allied armies during the Crimean war, when many companies\r\nwere dismounted owing to this mortality.\r\n\r\nLet us now transport ourselves in thought into the middle of those\r\nimmense steppes where vast and innumerable herds of herbivorous animals\r\nare being bred for our supply, and consider what will be the effects on\r\ntheir health and life if they should be afflicted with a scarcity of\r\nforage, in consequence of this long dry summer.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that there exist in Russia, in Hungary, in\r\nAustralia, in North and South America, and in many other parts of the\r\nglobe, large tracts of country which are still uninhabited, whose\r\nuncultivated soil supplies with food great numbers of sheep and cattle.\r\nThese spacious tracts, known as moorlands or steppes, particularly\r\nabound in Russia, on the banks of the Wolga, the Don, the Dnieper; in\r\nHungary, on the banks of the Danube; and also in South America, in the\r\nrepublics of Venezuela, New Granada, Columbia, &c.\r\n\r\nNow, in hot and rainy seasons these steppes teem with rich and luxuriant\r\nverdure; the plants growing up in the marshes are prolific and abundant,\r\nand even those parts of the wild moors which produce nothing but heath\r\nare capable of feeding and fattening flocks and herds.\r\n\r\nUnder conditions so auspicious as these, animals may still suffer, but\r\nin what way? By excess of food, or repletion. They are in general robust\r\nand healthy, and thus fortified they inhale without detriment the\r\ndeleterious gases of oxygen with carbon, carburetted hydrogen and the\r\nlike, exhaled by the plants which grow out of the swampy soils. Thus\r\nprotected, too, they are proof against the fluctuations of the seasons,\r\nand against every injury which threatens them; and their strong and\r\nsound condition enables them to sustain the fatigues of their long and\r\narduous journeys, and to supply the rich countries of the West with\r\ntheir flesh, fleece, and hides.\r\n\r\nWhen the seasons have thus conveyed a due proportion of heat, water, and\r\nelectricity to the elements of the soil, both plants and animals conduce\r\nto the comfort and health of man, and fulfil his expectations. But the\r\nlaws of nature are involved in mystery. Good and evil go hand in\r\nhand--death and life travel close together--and a few years of\r\nprosperous harvests are almost invariably followed by blight,\r\nbarrenness, and scarcity. Most men think only of the present time, and\r\nthis imprudence and want of foresight prevent farmers and great cattle\r\nproprietors from collecting and holding in reserve the requisite stores\r\nof sustenance to supply their sheep and oxen during these barren\r\nseasons. Sickness then breaks out, and these helpless creatures perish\r\nin vast numbers, to the detriment of their owners' best interests.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, when continual rains cause the rivers to overflow, when the\r\nplains are drenched and soaked, or when a burning sun scorches the\r\nground, herbivorous animals wander in vain from field to field in quest\r\nof sustenance to restore their strength, or of pure and healthy water to\r\nslake their thirst; their vital resistance dwindles away, deleterious\r\ngases poison and bewilder them, their blood is debased, and as Ovid\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n  \"Corpora foeda jacent, vitiantur odoribus herbæ.\"\r\n\r\nAnd since these mild and harmless animals, which seem to have been\r\ncreated merely to clothe us, and to nourish us with their milk and\r\nflesh, have not been endowed by nature either with the intelligence, or\r\nthe activity, or the cunning, or the invention, or the skill bestowed on\r\nthe omnivorous and carnivorous species, hard is their fate under the\r\npressing needs of hunger. Peaceful creatures, they browse in vain on\r\ndeleterious plants on a sterile soil; their external and internal\r\nteguments now afford a favourable seat for the propagation of\r\nparasites--for the _parasitogenia_; and soon after a general _adynamia_,\r\nor relaxation of the fibres, delivers them up without resistance to the\r\nmorbific elements of the infectious diseases to which they are exposed,\r\nwhere the languishing, the sick, and the rotting are herded together,\r\nand they are carried off by hecatombs by this wasteful and devouring\r\ntyphus.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nWe may readily conclude, from these general observations on infectious\r\nand contagious diseases, that they must have existed in all former ages;\r\nand if in our present advanced state of civilization they are so\r\ndestructive, we may be sure that in those remote periods they must have\r\nbeen, both as regards man as well as the brute creation, the cause of\r\ngeneral extermination, in whatever parts of the earth they prevailed.\r\nAnd indeed, whenever we refer to ancient or modern history, we are\r\ncontinually struck with the analogy which exists between the epidemic\r\ndiseases signalized by the general name of PLAGUE, and which\r\ndecimated all the living beings, and those which more recently, and at\r\nthe present moment, have startled the world by their fatal effects on\r\nmen and animals.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we cannot too often repeat the fact--in order that those\r\ndocuments relating to the past which contain useful instruction may be\r\nexamined and searched into--that the physiological and pathological laws\r\nwhich rule and determine the phenomena of organic matter, whether in\r\nhealth or sickness, were, like the laws of chemistry, electricity, and\r\nastronomy, originally established at the time of creation, and that\r\nmatter submits with passive obedience to the laws of transformation and\r\ntransubstantiation, which are the absolute condition of life. These are\r\nthe eternal laws of which a synthesis so admirable is furnished by the\r\nGospel, in this short injunction, \"_Take, eat, this is my body; drink,\r\nthis is my blood._\"\r\n\r\nNow, if man, who is the sovereign master of this matter, did not take\r\ncare to regulate and modify it for his own benefit and the benefit of\r\nall living creatures on whom his own life depends, as well as his wealth\r\nand happiness; if he did not seek thereby continually to diminish the\r\nsum of evil, and to extend the sum of good which it is his mission to\r\nincrease, he would violate these laws, which are inherent in matter, and\r\nwhich have existed for his use since the creation of the world.\r\n\r\nWe must likewise believe that those PLAGUES which are spoken of\r\nin the Bible, those which Homer alludes to, that which is related by\r\nPlutarch, and which succeeded the general drought in 753 before Christ;\r\nthose mentioned by Titus Livius, Virgil, Ovid, and other Latin authors,\r\nthe most virulent of which plagues raged in the years 310, 212, and 178\r\nof the Foundation of Rome, resembled the epidemics or plagues which are\r\nwitnessed in our own day.\r\n\r\nThe plague of 212 swept away all the inhabitants of Sicily, cattle as\r\nwell as men; that of 178 destroyed all the priests, who sought in vain\r\nfor victims free from the contagion, to offer them up as sacrifices to\r\nthe offended Gods.\r\n\r\nCecilius Severus gives a most striking description of a pestilential\r\ndisease which, in 376 A.D., swept away all the cattle in\r\nEurope. Judging from his account of that scourge, we may fairly believe\r\nthat the distemper he has described was identically the same as the one\r\nwhich has just broken out in England. \"A universal distaste, sudden\r\ndejection, vertigoes, spasmodic tension in the limbs, _a painful_\r\n_swelling of the lower belly_, violent affections of the nerves, sudden\r\ndeath--everything shows the presence of a pestilential ferment, which\r\nirritates the solids, infects and vitiates the fluids, which is the\r\ncause of the putrefaction of the humours, manifested by the swelling of\r\nthe lower belly, which in that case depends on a putrid fermentation so\r\nas to disengage air.\"\r\n\r\nA piece of iron, representing the sign of the Cross, was heated in the\r\nfire, and when red-hot was applied to the forehead of the sick animals;\r\nand this remedy was looked upon at that time as the most effectual they\r\ncould apply.\r\n\r\nGrégoire de Tours makes mention of an epidemic, the result of a long dry\r\nsummer, which, in 592, was very fatal in its havoc, sparing no living\r\ncreature whatever.\r\n\r\nAndré Duchesne, in his \"History of England,\" speaks of an epidemic\r\nwhich, in 1316, during the reign of Edward II., owed its origin, on the\r\ncontrary, to a long season of rains.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated physicians Ramazzini and Lancisi relate that in 1711, an\r\nox which had been imported from Hungary, that constant focus of typhus,\r\ndisplayed the most deadly form of the cattle disease, in the Venetian\r\nterritory, although no alteration in the air or waters had been observed\r\nin Italy, and the seasons had been regular and the pastures abundant.\r\nThe contagion spread into Piedmont, where it carried of 70,000 head of\r\ncattle; thence it extended to France and Holland, each of which\r\ncountries lost 200,000 of these animals. The trade in hides introduced\r\nthe distemper into England, where it proved no less fatal. It was the\r\nsame in the other countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn this disease, the intestines of the affected cattle were, as in the\r\npresent epizootia, inflamed, and strewed over with livid spots and\r\nulcerations, and the blood, though apparently fluid in the body of the\r\nanimal, _coagulated directly after it had issued from the vein_.\r\n\r\nHerment thence concludes, that this epizootia is nothing more than an\r\ninflammation of the blood. Lancisi advised his contemporaries to put to\r\ndeath without pity every animal which was affected or seemed to be\r\naffected with the disease; and it was in England that this spirited\r\nresolve was first acted upon.\r\n\r\nThe three counties of Middlesex, Essex, and Surrey arrested the course\r\nof this contagion in less than three months, by adopting this measure;\r\nwhilst in the rest of the stricken counties of Great Britain, and\r\nlikewise in Holland, where this decisive course was not taken at all,\r\nthe disease prevailed among the cattle for several years. Since that\r\ntime, it has been insisted on by some authors, that the barbarous\r\nprocess of general extermination offers the most effectual remedy which,\r\nin our present state of ignorance and improvidence, we could have\r\nrecourse to, in order to check the diffusion and the duration of this\r\nfell disease.\r\n\r\nThe learned Goelicke describes an epizootia which was witnessed in 1730,\r\nat Frankfort-on-the-Oder. His narrative, written with a masterly hand,\r\nmight very properly be applied to the disease which we are now\r\nconsidering; and the treatment recommended by this earnest and vigilant\r\nobserver is so wisely deduced from the symptoms, that even in the\r\npresent day we might take that treatment as a model.\r\n\r\nWe could have borrowed much more largely from this source of\r\nbiographical researches had we not deemed that these quotations would be\r\nsufficient for the purpose we had in view in this work. But from these\r\nauthorities we think it may justly be concluded, that infectious and\r\ncontagious diseases among horned cattle have frequently appeared from\r\nthe remotest times down to the middle of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nAll these attacks of epizootia were a frequent and severe cause of\r\nsuffering and misery among animals and men; but the ravages which they\r\nleft behind them were of slight importance each time, if we compare them\r\nwith those attending the epizootia which towards the year 1746 affected\r\nthe animal kingdom. This dreadful scourge lasted ten years, and swept\r\naway nearly the whole race of horned cattle throughout Europe. It was\r\nclosely studied and thoroughly understood in its causes, its symptoms,\r\nand its treatment by the scientific authors of that day, and those\r\nwriters, more judicious than we, did not designate the malady by the\r\ntitle of PLAGUE. This particular visitation deserves to fix our\r\nattention in an especial manner, not only on account of its striking\r\nresemblance to the disease which now makes us all so anxious, but\r\nbecause it induced two English physicians, Malcolm Flemming and Peter\r\nLayard, to write on this disease two accounts or statements which are\r\nequal, if not superior, to all the volumes which have since appeared on\r\nthe subject of the Cattle Disease. There is no help for it, and our\r\npride must bend itself to the acknowledgment: these two men, our seniors\r\nby a century, were men of quite another stamp. Their expositions,\r\nenriched with quotations from the Greek and Latin authors, abounding in\r\nfacts, ingenious insights and inferences, are far superior in merit to\r\nthe multitude of voluminous works which have been written and published\r\nsince then. It would be easy to prove that these two sagacious inquirers\r\nfar better understood than we have done the real nature of this cattle\r\ndisease, and that we must be grateful to them for first opening the way\r\nwhich all of us must take in order to discover the preventive and\r\ncurative means of which we are still ignorant.\r\n\r\nLet us observe, in passing, that these two physicians, who appear to\r\nhave been scarcely known, enlightened by the effects of the inoculation\r\nof small-pox, then practised from man to man, appear to have first\r\nconceived the idea, now practised in Russia, of preventing the\r\npropagation of the contagious cattle disease by means of inoculation;\r\nand we may raise the interest of this remark by reminding the reader\r\nthat their experiments to inoculate cattle were made in 1757, eight\r\nyears after the very year which gave birth to the future inoculation of\r\nman with animal virus by the celebrated Jenner. By this it would appear\r\nthat the twofold honour of applying the method of inoculation as both\r\npreventive and curative means in respect of contagion in cattle, and as\r\nthe preventive means by the variola of the cow to resist the ravages of\r\nthe small-pox in man, is the indisputable claim of English\r\nphysicians.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nVery little is known of the origin or first outbreak of the epizootia\r\nwhich produced such fearful ravages in the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Some suppose that it first appeared in Tartary, where it\r\noccasioned a disorder twice as extensive in its pernicious effects as\r\nany similar distemper which had been known up to that time. Thence it\r\npassed into Russia, from which it spread on one side into Poland,\r\nLivonia, Prussia, Pomerania, and Holland, and from that country into\r\nEngland; on the other side towards the East, it invaded the Turkish\r\nEmpire, Bohemia, Hungary, Dalmatia, Austria, Moravia, Styria, the Gulf\r\nof Venice, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, the banks of the Rhine, and\r\nDenmark.\r\n\r\nBut another opinion has assigned Bohemia as the source from which this\r\ndestructive epizootia took its rise, and its supporters allege that\r\nduring the siege of Prague the cattle feeding in its plains had been\r\ndeprived of their usual fodder by the continual _razzias_ of the French\r\nto supply their own cavalry.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, this virulent cattle disease having at length\r\nassumed the proportions of a public calamity, the several governments\r\nwere obliged to take it into serious consideration, and the medical\r\nfaculties and most celebrated physicians began to make it the subject of\r\ntheir studies and reports. In France, therefore, the professors of the\r\nfaculty of Paris and Montpellier, suspending every other pursuit,\r\ndevoted their most assiduous care and attention to dumb animals.\r\n\r\nSauvages, the Dean of the Faculty at Montpellier, drew up a most\r\nphilosophical and learned account of the prevailing disease, in which,\r\nlike Stahl, he forgot probably for a moment the part which, in the\r\nprogress of distempers, he ascribes to the soul.\r\n\r\nThe professors of Paris, very famous in their day, but who, having left\r\nbehind them no works so valuable as the \"Nosologia\" of Sauvages, are now\r\ncompletely forgotten, likewise addressed the result of their inquiries\r\nand lucubrations to the King.\r\n\r\nDoctor Leclerc was sent into Holland, whence he brought back a Memorial,\r\nwhich was a reflex of the opinions he found current in Denmark, and\r\nwhich has been transmitted to us in the _Memorials of the Royal Society\r\nof Science at Copenhagen_.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the reflections found in the writings of Malcolm\r\nFlemming, Layard, and other competent observers, that this formidable\r\nepizootia was in its character identical with the one described by\r\nRamazzini and Lancisi in 1711; and we feel warranted in saying, after\r\nhaving examined every work of any importance which has treated of that\r\nvisitation, that it resembles the disease now prevailing among cattle,\r\nin its march, in its symptoms, and in its gravity. We believe that these\r\nthree visitations constitute but one and the same malady, occurring at\r\nthree different periods. This appears to us a most important fact, for\r\nif such be the case, the tentative treatment of that time deserves our\r\nmost particular attention. Consequently, a few retrospective glances may\r\nperhaps be permitted us, in considering the subject of cattle disease.\r\n\r\nThe medical professors (including several English physicians), who\r\nobserved and described the epizootia of 1745, divided the same into\r\nthree periods.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the disease, when it passed through all its phases up to\r\nthe death of the affected animal, consisting of from ten to twelve days,\r\nthey usually ascribed to each of these periods or stages an average\r\ncontinuance of three or four days.\r\n\r\n_1st Period._--After a few days of latent incubation, which the observer\r\ncould not suspect, the sick animal betrayed signs of the morbid state\r\nwhich was about to declare itself, by his careless feeding, by drooping\r\nhis head, and by exhibiting the deepest dejection of spirits in his\r\nattitude and look. Rumination, already imperfect, soon ceased\r\naltogether, the appetite failed, the horns, ears, and hoofs were cold,\r\nthe hair grew stiff, the tongue and mucus looked white; the eyes were\r\ntearful and fixed, the hearing obtuse, whilst, in the cows, the supply\r\nof milk diminished. In cases of unusual gravity, transient shiverings\r\ntestified to a serious disturbance in all the animal functions. These\r\nshiverings were followed by a violent fever, the blood became inflamed,\r\nthe breath hot, the respiration hurried and sometimes attended with\r\nslight coughing; when, if too violent a repercussion was transmitted to\r\nthe nervous centres, the pressure on the vertebral line became\r\nintolerable, and the animal, seized with vertigo, and almost delirious\r\nwith pain, would fall during this first period, as if struck by\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomena are sometimes observed in the typhoid fever of man,\r\nwhich offers moreover some analogy with the contagious typhus of the ox;\r\nbut as the ox and the horse have likewise the real typhus fever, they\r\nmay some day supply us with the preventive virus for that fever, in the\r\nsame manner as the cow now supplies us with the preventive virus for the\r\nsmall-pox.\r\n\r\n_2nd Period._--In most cases the disease pursued its course with greater\r\nor less regularity; the sick animal experienced gnawing pains or\r\ntwitchings, and spasmodic shootings in the limbs, apparently attended\r\nwith pain. His thirst was insatiable, but he had no appetite, the\r\nfunctions of the bladder and intestines were impeded, then diarrhoea\r\nsupervened, accompanied with dry, fetid, and sometimes bloody excreta.\r\nThick viscid mucosities dripped from the nostrils, mouth, and eyes. The\r\ndorsal regions and the loins were constantly aching, headache and\r\nsleeplessness were permanent. The animal continued either standing or\r\nlying down, and if he wanted to rest, he could not bend himself\r\ngradually, but would fall like an inert mass to the ground.\r\n\r\n_3rd Period._--Diarrhoea was continual, becoming more fetid every day,\r\nthe wasting of flesh made rapid strides; the cellular tissue beneath the\r\nhide was filled with gas along the vertebral channels and under the\r\nabdomen; the nostrils were stopped up with mucosities, the animal could\r\nonly breathe through the mouth, puffing and blowing aloud as he drew in\r\nthe air; and at last pustular eruptions showed themselves on various\r\nparts; but as this depurating crisis was insufficient, the poor beast,\r\nin this final period of the attack, fell a sacrifice to it between the\r\nseventh and twelfth day. If he chanced to be lying down his agony was\r\nslow, but if standing, he would sink upon himself, and expire at once.\r\n\r\nIn this dreadful epizootia, very few of the smitten cattle survived--not\r\nmore than four or five in a hundred; and in these favourable cases, the\r\nsymptoms presented certain signs and critical phenomena of a happy omen.\r\nIn these rare exceptions, the pulse did not exceed seventy, the\r\nbeatings of the heart were always perceptible, the patient did not\r\nrefuse to drink, the continuous fever exhibited no aggravation at night,\r\npustular eruptions and tumours appeared on the dewlap and the fore\r\nlimbs, and the epidermis over the mouth and nostrils peeled off about\r\nthe twelfth day.\r\n\r\nWhen dissected, the bodies offered to view the following alterations,\r\nthe same having already been observed by Frascator during the prevalence\r\nof the epizootia in 1514, and by Lancisi and Ramazzini during that which\r\nwas so fatal in 1711. The mucous glands of the mouth were livid, and\r\noccasionally excoriated; the bronchial tubes were obstructed with\r\nmucosities; the lungs, besides being partially congested, were sometimes\r\nemphysematous, that is, inflated with compressed air. Of the four\r\nstomachs, the rumen was full of food, the reticulum, the omasum, and the\r\nabomasum exhibited purple or livid spots, according to their place. The\r\nthin intestine and the thick intestine showed either a general\r\ninjection, scattered livid spots, or ulcerations, according as the fever\r\nhad worn the exanthematous or typhoid form; for the mucous membrane of\r\nthe digestive channels, and especially that of the intestines, displays,\r\nlike the external tegument in man and the brute creation, divers forms\r\nof inflammation, analogous with the measles, the scarlatina, and the\r\nsmall-pox; so that, if the typhoid fever in man, which is nothing else\r\nthan the small-pox of the intestines, is so frequently cured, it is\r\nbecause the general morbid condition, the fever, often conceals\r\ndifferent intestinal lesions, albeit they seem to be similar in the\r\ngeneral symptoms, which taken collectively constitute the disease.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of these diseased animals was blackish, and devoid of blood;\r\nthe animals which fed upon it, if uncooked, sickened afterwards, or\r\ndied. The wrecks of the bodies, and more particularly the skin,\r\nsometimes retained a strength of contagion so deadly, that the mere\r\nexportation of them was enough to cause its propagation, and to this\r\ncause was at that time attributed the outbreak of the contagion in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary case of this pernicious influence, which is related by\r\nHartmann, who observed this epizootia at its decline in 1756, will give\r\nan idea of the subtlety of this malignant virus.\r\n\r\nA farmer who had lost an ox in consequence of that virulent distemper,\r\nburied it in one of his fields. The following night a bear smelt the ox,\r\nraked it up with his feet, ate a portion of the flesh, and a few days\r\nafter, the beast of prey was found dead in a neighbouring wood by a\r\npeasant in the parish of Eumaki. The skin belonging to this bear was\r\nmagnificent. The peasant flayed the animal and carried home his skin in\r\ntriumph. But his triumph was short; for that same night the poor\r\ncountryman fell ill, and died two days after the attack. The magistrates\r\nof Wiburg, having heard of this occurrence, sent orders to have the\r\ninfected skin burned. Meanwhile, the skin had been given to the curate\r\nof the place as a compensation for the offices of burial; but his\r\ncupidity having persuaded him that this fine skin could not have\r\ndestroyed the peasant whom he had just buried, he did not burn it at\r\nall, but induced another peasant to clean and dress it for him. This\r\nsimple fellow and two other clodpoles, who assisted him in the\r\npreparation, fell ill, and all three of them died in the course of a\r\nfew days. A new and peremptory order now came from Wiburg to burn this\r\nskin, to burn the house in which it had been dressed, to burn even the\r\npresbytery itself, should it be deemed necessary. The skin had already\r\npassed through several hands. However, the curate being still reluctant\r\nto part with it, took it home again. \"Can it be possible,\" said he to\r\nhimself, \"that this skin has really proved fatal to life? What can have\r\nbeen the cause, I wonder?\" At the same time he rubbed it in his hands\r\nand smelt it. Unlucky curate! A few days afterwards he himself was taken\r\nill and died. (_Memoirs of the Academy of Stockholm._)\r\n\r\nA native of Clermont Ferrand, in the department of Puy de Dôme, in\r\nFrance, the birth-place of Pascal, one day finding an ox which had died\r\nof the epizootia, stripped off the skin and carried it away. After his\r\nreturn home, the black typhus, and then gangrene, broke out on one of\r\nhis arms, which had to be cut off, and the patient died of the effects\r\nof the amputation.\r\n\r\nA butcher having slaughtered an ox smitten with this typhus, sold the\r\nflesh for meat to some soldiers of the Regiment Royal Bavière, then\r\ngarrisoned in one of the towns of Languedoc. All those who partook of\r\nthis meat were seized with diarrhoea, dysentery, and fever, and\r\nseveral of the sick soldiers very nearly died. The butcher, whose\r\navarice had caused all this mischief, had richly deserved some exemplary\r\npunishment, and some of the sufferers proposed that he should be hanged\r\noutright, but the majority, more clement, sentenced him to be beaten\r\nblack and blue with horsewhips.\r\n\r\nThe popular saying, _when the beast is dead the poison is dead_, being\r\ngenerally true, the virulence of the contagion, in the above instances,\r\npossessed venomous properties of an exceptional character, for if every\r\nsick animal slaughtered by the butchers and sold to the consumers, or\r\nthose which had been flayed for the sake of the skin, had contained so\r\nmurderous a virus in their tissues, the number of victims to the\r\ncontagion among the human species would have been appalling. And in that\r\ncase, too, similar sacrifices would be witnessed at present, for it\r\ncannot be doubted that, in the actual state of the meat market in\r\nLondon, the people are now in the daily habit of eating the flesh of\r\ncattle which are diseased.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nPhysicians of different countries have naturally bestowed much time and\r\ncare in considering and discussing the nature of this epizootia, because\r\nthey have felt that a satisfactory theory and appreciation of its\r\nprincipal phenomena, might afford the medical faculty a rational basis\r\nfor some special treatment.\r\n\r\nLayard and the physicians of Geneva have considered this cattle disease\r\nto be _a malignant fever with an eruptive tendency_.\r\n\r\nIn the estimation of the faculties of Paris and Montpellier, this cattle\r\ndisease, considered in its symptoms, was nothing more than _a malignant\r\nfever essentially contagious_, the action of which appeared to tend\r\nexclusively towards the skin, and therefore it was rational to provoke\r\nexternal eruptions and deposits which, as they matured, diverted from\r\nthe centre the greatest part of the morbific matter.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_, to which, above all, we invite the reader's attention\r\n(more particularly that of medical men), necessarily varied according to\r\nthe period of the disease. It was sometimes preservative, sometimes\r\ncurative, as the case might be.\r\n\r\n_The Preventive Treatment._--The farmers and cattle-breeders, whose\r\nherds were still exempt from the contagion, mindful of the advice which\r\nthey received through the public press, took very particular care of\r\ntheir cattle during this season of epizootia: they rubbed them over with\r\na brush, and washed them at least once a day; they sheltered them from\r\nthe inclemency of wind and rain; they took their milch cows, which until\r\nthen they had kept shut up in unhealthy cow-houses, into the open air of\r\nthe fields; they washed and fumigated the stables; they examined the\r\nquality of the fodder and of the other articles of food; they added\r\nmarine salt to their drinking water, or poured salt water over their\r\nforage; and above all, they took care that no foreign animal commingled\r\nwith their flocks and herds.\r\n\r\nSome physicians, on their side conscious of the duty which devolves upon\r\nthem in such seasons of calamity, instead of resting satisfied with\r\nrecommending remedies, betook themselves boldly to the work, and studied\r\nthe disease experimentally in respect to its propagation and prevention.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, certain Dutch physicians, in 1754, wishing to know\r\nwhether the morbid matter would transmit the disease by inoculation,\r\nmade incisions in the necks of some oxen, cows and calves, inserting in\r\nthe wound a little tow saturated with the morbid secretions discharged\r\nfrom the eyes and nostrils. This direct inoculation having been\r\npractised on seventeen animals, transmitted the disease to them all in\r\nthe course of a few days.\r\n\r\nThe English physicians having been made acquainted with these\r\nexperiments, applied them to a more practical purpose, no longer to\r\ndiscover whether the disease could thus be transmitted (for that had\r\nbeen proved), but to find out (what was far more important) whether this\r\nfearful distemper could be prevented and kept off.\r\n\r\nMalcolm Flemming, in 1755, merely suggested the idea of inoculation as a\r\npreventive means, without proceeding to a course of experiments to\r\nratify his opinion. He intimates his notion in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"I apprehend that inoculation will stand the better chance of bringing\r\non the distemper, if the subject it is performed on is as young as\r\nsafety will permit, the vessels being then most absorbent, and the\r\nanimal economy most easily put into disorder.\r\n\r\n\"But even in case the inoculation of calves should be found so\r\nsuccessful as universally to prevail, the method I recommend will not be\r\naltogether useless; for, by being properly modelled and adapted to\r\ncircumstances, it may, I am persuaded, prevent contagion, and likewise\r\nact as a preparative in any epidemical affection of the inflammatory\r\nkind, not only in horned cattle, but likewise in all other quadrupeds\r\nthat civil society may think worthy of preservation, and even in the\r\nhuman species.\"\r\n\r\nLayard, in 1757, devotes the seventh chapter of his work, \"The Means to\r\nprevent the Infection,\" to the consideration of the preventive\r\ntreatment, in which he says:--\r\n\r\n\"No one will think of bringing the infection into any place free from\r\nit, merely for the sake of inoculating their cattle; but if the\r\ncontagious distemper be in the neighbourhood of a herd, or break out so\r\nas to endanger the stock, the grazier or farmer may, by inoculating his\r\ncattle, with proper precautions, at least secure his stock, since he can\r\nhouse them before they fall sick, prepare them, and have due care taken,\r\nknowing the course of the distemper.\r\n\r\n\"Sir William St. Quintin, the Rev. Dr. Fountayne, Dean of York, and\r\nother gentlemen have succeeded in inoculation: in Holland it has both\r\nfailed and succeeded. These gentlemen all inoculated with matter taken\r\nfrom the running of the mouth, nose, or eyes. Professor Swenke mentions\r\nthat the beast from which he took the matter was recovering from the\r\ndistemper. A circumstance to be attended to is this:--had matter been\r\ntaken after the crisis, from a tumour, boil, pimple, or scab, either on\r\nthe back near the spine, or on the legs, the pus would have proved much\r\nmore elaborated, subtle, and infecting than that which, flowing with the\r\nmucus of the nose, must necessarily be, in some degree, sheathed by this\r\nglutinous excretion, though I am well aware how putrid and acrid it is\r\nrendered by the disease.\r\n\r\n\"That nothing may be omitted which in any shape can contribute to the\r\nsuccess of inoculation, due attention should be paid to the constitution\r\nand state of the beast, no less in this practice on the cattle than on\r\nthe human species. Undoubtedly the young, healthy, and strong bid fairer\r\nfor a good issue than the old, sickly, and feeble; each of these\r\ndifferent constitutions demand a particular treatment, even in the\r\nmethod of preparation; and however trifling it may seem to many--the\r\nurging a necessity of preparation--I will venture to affirm that I have\r\nseen excellent effects arising from a rational preparation, and fatal\r\nevents from want of preparation. I have likewise been witness of\r\nunfavourable turns, merely from an injudicious preparation.\r\n\r\n\"The beasts which are sanguine require moderate bleeding; those that\r\nhave but a small share of blood must have none drawn. The strong must,\r\nbesides moderate bleeding and purging, be kept on light diet, and their\r\nbody kept open. Thus, scalded bran, mixed with their hay and chaff, will\r\ncool them. The weakly, and such as are inclined to scour, must be kept\r\non dry fodder, and have peas and beans given them to strengthen them. A\r\nmess of malt, or a quart of warm ale, with a few spices, will be very\r\nsuitable for them.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever diseases the cattle may be affected with, if time will permit,\r\nthey are first to be removed.\r\n\r\n\"The cattle to be inoculated are first to be well washed, rubbed dry,\r\nand then curried, to remove all the filth from the hair and skin. Then\r\nthey are to be placed in a spacious barn or stable, where the air is\r\ntemperate and no cold can come to them. There they are to be prepared\r\naccording to the direction already given, foddered with good sweet hay,\r\nand watered with clear spring water; and if the distemper be not near,\r\nthey may be turned out into the air, near the barn or stable, and may\r\nstay there a few hours in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n\"When it appears that the cattle are in perfect health, free from any\r\ninfection or disease, brisk and lively, neither costive nor scouring,\r\nand chewing their cud, then the operation may be safely undertaken, and\r\nhenceforth they must be confined to the barn.\r\n\r\n\"Since there is observed to follow the greatest flow of the contagious\r\nand putrid particles separated from the blood, wherever the infectious\r\nmatter makes an impression at first, particular care must be taken not\r\nto inoculate near such vital parts as the heart and lungs, nor near the\r\nwomb, if a cow with calf be inoculated; for, though rowels are properly\r\napplied in the dewlaps to draw off the pestilential humour from the\r\nbreast, and in other cases beasts are frequently rowelled in the\r\nflanks,--yet, in this operation, as matter is inserted by these channels\r\ninto the neighbouring vessels, those vital parts, or the womb, might\r\nbecome the chief seat of the disease, and the event prove fatal.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent such accidents, human beings have been inoculated on the\r\narms and legs, and now-a-days the arms are found sufficient. I would\r\nrecommend that the cattle should be inoculated about the middle of the\r\nshoulders or buttocks, on both sides, to have the benefit of two drains.\r\nThe skin is to be cut lengthways two inches, deep enough for the blood\r\nto start, but not to bleed much. In this incision is to be put a dossil\r\nor pledget of tow, dipped in the matter of a boil full ripe, opened in\r\nthe back of a young calf recovering from the distemper. It may not be\r\namiss to stitch up the wound, to keep the tow in, and let it remain\r\nforty-eight hours. Then the stitches are to be cut, the tow taken out,\r\nand the wound dressed with yellow basilicum ointment, or one made with\r\nturpentine and yolk of egg, spread on pledgets of tow. These dressings\r\nare to be continued during the whole illness, and till after the\r\nrecovery of the beast, to promote the discharge; and then the wound may\r\nbe healed with the cerate of lapis calaminaris, or any other.\r\n\r\n\"On the third day after inoculation, the discolouring of the wound,\r\nwhose lips appear grey and swollen, will be a sign that the inoculation\r\nhas succeeded; but the beasts, as Professor Swenke informs us, did not\r\nfall ill till the sixth day, which answers exactly to the observations\r\ndaily made in the inoculating of children. Yet the Professor adds that\r\non the third day a costiveness came on, which was removed by giving each\r\ncalf three ounces of Epsom salts.\r\n\r\n\"No sooner do the symptoms of heaviness and stupidity appear than the\r\nbeasts must have a light covering thrown over them, and at night\r\nfastened loosely. They must be rubbed morning and evening, and curried,\r\ntill the boils begin to rise; warm hay-water and vinegar-whey must be\r\ngiven plentifully. Should the beasts require more nourishment, dry meat,\r\nsuch as cut hay, with a little bran, may be offered. I should be very\r\ncautious in giving milk-pottage, even after the boils and pimples had\r\nall come out, for fear of bringing on a scouring. However, this caution\r\nis proper, that whenever milk-pottage be given, the vinegar-whey is to\r\nbe omitted for obvious reasons. In cases of accident, the same attention\r\nis to be observed in the disease by inoculation as in the natural way,\r\nand the medicines recommended are the same I would use; but by\r\ninoculation there seldom is a call for any, so favourably does the\r\ndistemper proceed through its several stages.\r\n\r\n\"The crisis being over, it will be proper to purge the cattle, to air\r\nthem by degrees, and to have the same regard in the management of them\r\nas is laid down in the chapter on the method of cure.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the recommendations which Layard has prescribed for those who\r\nhave to practise inoculation as a preventive treatment; it would be\r\ndifficult to offer an example of greater prudence or precision.\r\n\r\nA certain number of oxen were, by means of this inoculation, protected\r\nagainst the attack of the cattle disease; and this mode of treatment\r\nwas, as we shall afterwards explain, adopted in Russia. Unfortunately,\r\nthis rational and preventive treatment was discovered only at the end of\r\nthe epizootia, when already upwards of six millions of horned cattle had\r\nfallen a sacrifice to the contagious fever.\r\n\r\n_Curative Means._--When the first course of the disease had left no\r\ndoubt of the attack, the sick animal was subjected to an appropriate\r\ndiet, and restricted to liquids either as medicinal decoctions, or as\r\nalimentary beverages. The decoctions consisted of whey mixed with a\r\nlittle vinegar, and nitred hay. The broths, or alimentary beverages,\r\nconsisted of a decoction of bread, and of water mixed with bran and\r\nmeal, whether of barley, oats, or wheat.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the curative process, the majority of physicians\r\nrecommended one or two bleedings, in order to abate the violence of the\r\nfever, and of the congestions near the nervous centres and the lungs;\r\nand as constipation prevailed at the time, they strove with the same\r\nobject to empty the digestive passages, the intestines, and the\r\nstomachs, notwithstanding the difficulty that exists to produce this\r\nresult in ruminating animals.\r\n\r\nThe purgatives employed consisted of a decoction of senna, mixed with\r\nprune juice, with a little rhubarb or fresh linseed oil, infused in\r\ntheir drink, or applied as a clyster in warm water slightly salted.\r\nThose who practised polypharmacy administered at night a mixture of\r\nnitre, camphor, red-lead, and rhubarb, in half a pailful of warm water;\r\nand greatly did they boast of the active influence of this beverage.\r\n\r\nSome practitioners even endeavoured, in the first stage of the malady,\r\nto accelerate its action on the skin by giving for that purpose warm\r\ndrinks, and by covering the cattle with woollen cloths, to promote\r\nperspiration; but it was generally admitted that the sick animals\r\npreferred cold drinks, and that they were particularly fond of\r\nacidulated whey.\r\n\r\nIn the second period of the distemper, the same drinks were continued,\r\nadding thereto some theriac or Jesuit's bark, in order to lessen the\r\nfrequency of the diarrhoetic evacuations. They also provoked the\r\ndepurating secretions from the mouth, nose, and eyes, by repeated\r\nwashings; and as those animals, in which the running was most easy and\r\ncopious, seemed to be less seriously affected with the disease, they\r\nstrove to increase that which flowed from the glands of the mouth by\r\nfixing a gag in the jaws, and keeping it there for several hours. This\r\nmeasure seemed so efficacious that a decree from the Parlement de Rouen,\r\nissued on the 13th of March, 1745, ordered the application of a gag, or\r\nbit, for three hours every day, to the cattle under treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the third period, they sought to overcome the wasting of strength in\r\nthe system by means of tonic and nutritious drinks, decoctions of\r\ncentaury, Jesuit's bark, juniper berries, &c. They likewise administered\r\nemollient clysters if the evacuations were bloody.\r\n\r\nMoreover, they placed two or three setons, principally in the dewlap, in\r\norder to obey the signs and indications of nature--_quo natura vergit,\r\neo ducendum_; as a salutary and critical eruption of the skin was at\r\nthat period forcing its way. These setons were kept open with a mixture\r\nof turpentine and yolks of egg, for the purpose of encouraging the\r\nsecretion. The purulent or emphysematous tumours were cut.\r\n\r\nBut whatever means might be employed, almost all the cattle perished,\r\nand the few and rare recoveries only afforded the pessimists the\r\nsatisfaction of claiming the merit of them for themselves. It was\r\nremarked, besides, that the fattest beasts were the least able to resist\r\nthe effects of the distemper.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say, that during the whole course of the\r\ntreatment, great care was taken to keep both the stables and the cattle\r\nin a perfect state of cleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe convalescence of those animals which were cured was invariably long,\r\nand required great attention as to their food and hygienic treatment.\r\nSolid substances, roots, and forage were withheld until rumination\r\nrevived; and it was only after several days of encouraging trials that\r\nthe recovered animal was suffered at last to feed all day in the field,\r\naccording to his pleasure.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was that formidable epizootia which, in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, swept away upwards of six millions of horned cattle,\r\nand which occasioned a loss to Europe exceeding fifty millions\r\nsterling--perhaps we might say a hundred millions--for other domestic\r\nanimals, sheep, horses, &c. (as generally happens in cases of\r\nepizootia), had likewise suffered, in different degrees, from the\r\nvarious complaints arising from inclement seasons.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly necessary to our purpose that we should have taken this\r\nretrospective view of the cattle disease, and it will afford us a\r\nvaluable guide for the future. We may now content ourselves with\r\nbringing together the different annals in the chain of time which\r\nelapsed between Layard's treatise, which was published in 1757, and the\r\npresent day. This chain of time amounts to 108 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe typhus of Horned Cattle, which had shown itself in a manner\r\npermanent, sometimes raging at one part of the globe, sometimes at\r\nanother, could not, under the unaltered conditions by which it had been\r\ngenerated, suspend its ravages; and though, thanks to her isolated\r\nposition, England may be less exposed to it than other countries, it is,\r\nhowever, necessary to take note of what may serve for our instruction in\r\nthe several epizootics which will pass under our view.\r\n\r\nMedical writers relate that contagious typhus broke out several times in\r\nHolland during the years 1768, 1769, and 1770; it also appeared in\r\nFrench Flanders in 1771, in Hainault in 1773. In France one particular\r\nspot was, at this period, completely rendered intact by drawing a\r\nsanitary fence about its limits, and bestowing on the cattle particular\r\nhygienic attention as a safeguard. The stables of these animals were\r\nwashed, cleansed, and fumigated; spring water was given them to drink,\r\ntheir food was chosen with care, and a certain quantity of salt was\r\nmixed with it.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, Holland, a cold and damp country, was once more invaded by the\r\nscourge; and the Government offered in vain a reward of 80,000 florins\r\nto any one who should discover the preventive or specific remedy for the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe typhus which, at that epoch, had likewise broken out again in the\r\nsouth of France, threatened to become an abiding peril to the wealth of\r\nnations. Two French authors, Vicq d'Azyr and Paulet, betook themselves\r\nearnestly to the task of collecting every document which up to that time\r\nhad been published on the successive visitations of the malady, and of\r\noffering the means of preventing it. Their intention was unquestionably\r\nlaudable, but the time for obtaining such a result had not yet arrived;\r\nbesides which, these two writers, whatever may have been their desert,\r\nwere not equal to an achievement of this character. They belonged,\r\nindeed, to that order of men who look upon the cultivation of science\r\nsolely as a step to personal distinction.\r\n\r\nVicq d'Azyr himself was but twenty-five years old when he issued, in\r\n1775, his work, entitled, \"Exposé des Moyens curatifs et preservatifs\r\nqui peuvent être employés contre les Maladies des Bêtes à Cornes.\" We\r\nshould deceive ourselves if we expected to find in this exposition\r\nanything but an interesting compilation of the works already published.\r\n\r\nPaulet's treatise appeared likewise in 1775, under the title,\r\n\"Recherches historiques et physiques sur les Maladies epizootiques, avec\r\nles Moyens d'y rémédier dans tous les Cas, publiées _par ordre du Roi_.\"\r\nParis. Two volumes.\r\n\r\nAfter reading and reflecting on this title, as servile as it is\r\narrogant, I might have dispensed with all examination of the work. A\r\nscientific man, whilst in the pursuit of truth, takes orders from\r\nnobody, not even from kings. Paulet, therefore, writing _by order_,\r\ncould only produce a work of mediocrity, and such is incontestably the\r\ndegree of value of his two volumes, forming, as they do, a fastidious\r\ndissertation of epizootics in general, and of those relating to cattle\r\nin particular.\r\n\r\nThe works of Paulet and Vicq d'Azyr, written at the same time, not being\r\nthe labour of men practising the medical art, are on a level as to the\r\nnotions which they have handed down to us; but that of Vicq d'Azyr\r\nbeing the better of the two, we shall extract therefrom what may chiefly\r\ninterest us.\r\n\r\nVicq d'Azyr relates the history of the epizootics, and expatiates on the\r\noriginal cause of the typhus in horned cattle, and on its nature. The\r\npassages in which he treats of its mode of propagation and its\r\ntreatment, are the most deserving of our notice.\r\n\r\nHe says, that he tried to no purpose to communicate the disease a second\r\ntime to animals which had been fortunate enough to get cured.\r\n\r\nThat cows covered with the fresh skins stripped from dead cattle,\r\nvictims to the distemper, did not contract it.\r\n\r\nThat infected clothes which had been worn by men who had served in\r\nhospitals where cattle were under treatment, having been laid on the\r\nbacks of several beasts in sound health, were found to transmit the\r\ndistemper in three cases out of six.\r\n\r\nThat the gases expelled from the intestines, received into a bladder\r\nball, and let out under the noses of healthy cattle, have communicated\r\nthe disease to them, after ten or fifteen days of latent incubation;\r\nand that the same gases being mixed with their drink, have also\r\npropagated the contagion.\r\n\r\nThat frictions, with the hands impregnated with virus, having been made\r\nover the skin, did not produce any ill effects.\r\n\r\nThat some oxen which had been designedly placed for a few hours among\r\nsick animals, have afterwards been seized with the distemper.\r\n\r\nThat a calf which had been placed in a stall containing some oxen\r\ngrievously affected, but which calf had a basket beneath its nose filled\r\nwith aromatic herbs, withstood the contagion.\r\n\r\nThat cowsheds which had been partially cleansed and fumigated,\r\ntransmitted the disease to other cattle, even several months after they\r\nhad been vacated.\r\n\r\nFinally, he mentions the experiments of inoculation made by Lay and in\r\nEngland, but not understanding their aim and capacity, he adds, that\r\ninoculation does not seem to him of any use, since the inoculated\r\nanimals all died. Yet he quotes the encouraging results obtained by\r\nCamper in Holland, who, out of 112 inoculated cattle, saved 41; and\r\nthose of Koopman, who, out of 94, cured 45 by this very inoculation.\r\n\r\nHe reminds us that the cattle typhus is an abiding disease in Hungary\r\nand Russia, where the beasts having bad water to drink, can only be\r\nprotected by a constant use of marine salt (_sel gemme_); but being\r\ndeprived of this salt, when they go great distances to be sold, and\r\nbeing exposed to extreme fatigue and privations, the typhus then spreads\r\namong them. He likewise tells us that Hungary and Dalmatia, which used\r\nto supply the markets of Italy with butcher's meat, were obliged to give\r\nup sending any cattle there, the Italians having firmly refused to\r\npurchase the same at any price whatever.\r\n\r\nAs regards treatment, the advice which Vicq d'Azyr gives to\r\nagriculturists, is mostly borrowed from the authors who have written on\r\nthe great epizootics of 1711, and 1745 to 1755. Thus, he advises them to\r\ngive as drinks in the first stage, water whitened with meal and nitred;\r\nto purge the animals with linseed oil; even to make scarifications on\r\nthe skin, and to keep up the suppuration with turpentine; to make the\r\nanimals inhale six times a day vapours seasoned with vinegar; to wrap\r\nthem over with woollen cloths; to bleed them once or twice; to\r\nadminister to them, when diarrhoea shows itself, a beverage containing\r\nwormwood, quinine, and diascordium; to cut open the tumours containing\r\npus or air, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is, as is seen, the same treatment as that quoted above; he\r\nguarantees its success, and supports his views by the authority of Van\r\nSwieten and Huxan.\r\n\r\nVan Swieten, however, had somewhat modified the treatment, by the\r\npredominance which he allowed to acids; and this course seemed to him to\r\nbe only reasonable with respect to animals whose sick humours contain an\r\nexcess of alkali.\r\n\r\nVicq d'Azyr fixed his attention on the means of prevention, the most\r\neffectual of which, in his opinion, was to slaughter every animal which\r\nhad either sickened, or had been exposed to the influence of the\r\ncontagion; and as he insisted that the authorities had no measures to\r\nkeep in this matter of public interest, he made it a principle that the\r\ngovernment was bound to compensate the cattle proprietors whose animals\r\nhad to be killed--the more so, said he, that the crafty husbandmen would\r\nnever come forward and freely declare the invalidity of their cattle,\r\nunless some indemnity were held out to them, which they would look upon\r\nas a sort of equivalent for the benefits they had expected by cutting\r\nthem up and selling them as the food of man.\r\n\r\nThe doctors of the period, scenting in Vicq d'Azyr a dangerous\r\ncompetitor, considered the advice of exterminating the diseased cattle\r\nas an _ingenious means of curing_ them, and as the author's age and\r\nexperience gave warrant for this satirical tone of discussion, the\r\npublic joined them in laughing at him.\r\n\r\nThe epizootic typhus, if not so destructive, was at least as frequent in\r\nthe early part of the nineteenth century, as it had been during the\r\neighteenth. The armies during the wars of united Europe against the\r\nFrench Republic and Empire, found it constantly in their train. Nor\r\ncould it be otherwise, the two leading causes of its prevalence being at\r\nhand. For on one hand there was the transit of large herds from the\r\nsteppes of Hungary, and on the other the wretched hygienic conditions\r\namidst which the cattle had to live in the campaigning armies.\r\n\r\nMany books have been published of late years on the diseases of cattle,\r\nin France and Germany; and several distinguished English veterinary\r\nsurgeons, especially Professor Simonds, have also devoted their\r\nattention to the same subject. In the second part of this work, we shall\r\nhave occasion to refer to their labours.\r\n\r\nIn France, Renault, Delafond, d'Arboval, Gellé, whose works enjoy a\r\ndeserved reputation, have discussed the subject of the origin of this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nRenault asserts that the disease has but one single focus, the steppes\r\nof Russia and Hungary. The epizootics of Asia, Africa, and South America\r\nare caused, he considers, by the importation of animals to those\r\ncountries. It is thus that he explains the epizootia which, under the\r\nname of Delombodera, devastated the American Republics in 1832, and that\r\nwhich, in 1841, appeared in Egypt. Renault thinks that neither the long\r\ntransit, nor the filthy state of the markets, nor the most wretched\r\nfeeding, are sufficient to account for contagious typhus among cattle;\r\nthat in addition to these causes, it still requires, in order to produce\r\nand generate it among animals, a predisposition, and a special aptitude,\r\nsuch as, hitherto at least, do not appear to have been witnessed except\r\nin the progeny of the steppes.\r\n\r\nThe other professors of his fraternity have submitted arguments to him,\r\nwhich to us seem very rational; and we will endeavour to do justice to\r\nthem when we discuss the origin of the typhus which at this moment is\r\nafflicting England.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThese historical dissertations and speculations on the subject of the\r\nbovine epizootia certainly deserve to draw the attention of all who feel\r\nan interest in the malady; but how insignificant they are compared with\r\nthe concluding facts which I have still to mention, before I at length\r\naddress myself to the consideration of the epizootia which is now\r\nconsuming our herds!\r\n\r\nThe indisputable fact that so terrible a distemper as this typhus had\r\nfixed itself permanently in Russia, and that it was causing incalculable\r\nlosses to the lordly proprietors of the steppes, as well as to the\r\ngovernment, roused them at last from their indifference. Then, indeed,\r\nthey urged the veterinary doctors to adopt some energetic means to\r\narrest the long duration of the scourge, and we must admit to their\r\nhonour, that various experiments which were tried for the purpose of\r\npreventing the evil, have been crowned with complete success. Any one\r\nmay ascertain the fact by referring to the _Journal Magazin_ of Berlin,\r\nin which the learned Professor Jessen of Dorpat has explained the\r\nresults of these important experiments.\r\n\r\nThe Russian veterinarians having observed that the oxen which had been\r\ncured of the typhus could mingle with impunity with the infected herds,\r\nconceived the idea of communicating the complaint to sound cattle by\r\nmeans of inoculation, and thereby to shield them from the contagion.\r\n\r\nThe first experiments in the inoculation of _Tchouma_ or cattle typhus,\r\nwere made in the year 1853, by order of the government, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Odessa, at the Heridin farm, by Professor Jessen.\r\n\r\nThe first inoculative attempts were very fatal; they caused the death of\r\nall the inoculated animals. But it was soon perceived that these\r\ngrievous results, far from prejudicing the theory, really confirmed it;\r\nand that the virus, attenuated in its toxical properties, would prove as\r\neffectual as was expected. And truly, in 1854 and 1855, at the Dorpat\r\nestablishment, the inoculations made with a better selected virus\r\nafforded results less disastrous. At Kozau they were still more\r\nsatisfactory. In fine, passing from experiment to experiment, they\r\narrived at the conclusion that it was necessary to inoculate several\r\nheads of cattle, the one after the other, without having recourse to any\r\nother virus than the first inoculated, so that they might thereby obtain\r\nvirus of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and up to the 10th generation. The\r\nvirus thus attenuated in its morbid effects answered at length every\r\nexperiment, and oxen thus inoculated could mingle with impunity with\r\ndiseased cattle.\r\n\r\nAt the veterinary establishment of Chalkoff they inoculated, during\r\neight meetings, 1059 animals with virus of the 3rd generation, and the\r\nresults were as satisfactory as could be wished for, only 60 animals\r\nhaving sunk under the effects of this preventive operation.\r\n\r\nThe inoculations made in 1857 and 1858 on an estate belonging to the\r\nDuchess Helena, at Karlowska, in the government of Pultawa, and\r\nconducted by the veterinarian Raussels, likewise afforded the most\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nProfessor Jessen thinks it certain, that beasts born of cows which have\r\nbeen afflicted with contagious typhus do not contract the disease. He\r\nmaintains that Europe may be preserved from this frightful scourge, by\r\ntaking care that no cattle be exported from the steppes of Russia save\r\nthose which have had the distemper either naturally or by inoculation,\r\nand he is striving to propagate this opinion, and to render it\r\npractical, by having all the cattle inoculated, without exception.\r\n\r\nIt is deeply to be regretted that counsels so prudent have not been\r\nheeded in the 47 governments which, out of the 53 possessed by Russia,\r\nhave generated the contagious typhus; for then it would not so\r\nfrequently have effected its passage into the neighbouring states, and\r\nEngland most probably, would not now have to take up arms against its\r\nfatal extension.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nWe here conclude that part of our labour which includes the history of\r\nthis disease, and what we have been able to glean from those medical\r\nwriters, and others, who have given us the results of their experience.\r\nIt may have appeared somewhat protracted, but it has at least laid open\r\nto the student the antecedent investigations of our predecessors, under\r\ncalamities of the same kind, but considerably more fatal than what has\r\nyet been witnessed in Western Europe during our time. We have\r\ndisinterred and brought to light the forgotten works of conscientious\r\nand competent men. Like Brunelleschi, the architect, we have sought, not\r\nto invent a theory, but to recover a practice; and thus we have received\r\nthe observations and precious facts, and finally the preventive\r\ntreatment, of other men and other times, which had coped successfully\r\nagainst the cattle disease when its ravages were infinitely greater.\r\n\r\nTo resume, then: these inquiries (which we undertook without\r\nanticipating so rich a harvest) have proved, and made evident--\r\n\r\nThat the contagious typhus afflicting horned cattle, has spread its\r\ndestructive principle over our globe ever since there have been animals\r\nliving on its surface.\r\n\r\nThat from century to century, not to say from year to year, it has\r\ncarried its terrors amidst nations and peoples.\r\n\r\nThat the remedial measures which had been taken and applied prior to the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century, were utterly powerless either to cure\r\nthis disease or to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThat at that period appeared two English physicians, men of remarkable\r\naptitude and penetration, one of whom, Malcolm Flemming, laid down in\r\ntheory the bases of a preventive treatment; whilst the other, Peter\r\nLayard, applied this theory to practice, by inoculating sound and\r\nhealthy animals with the morbid virus of the typhus, in order to protect\r\nthem from the fatal effects of the contagion.\r\n\r\nThat this all-important progress in medical experience, has been\r\nabsolutely forgotten; so much so, indeed, that the experiments of\r\ninoculation, tried in Russia only ten or twelve years ago with perfect\r\nsuccess, do not seem to be connected by any link with those made in\r\nEngland a century before, and that the invasion of the so-called\r\nCATTLE PLAGUE in 1865 seemed to some men to have introduced a\r\nnew scourge, which men were not armed and prepared to meet--which they\r\nwere powerless to cure, or to stay in its progress.\r\n\r\nThese inquiries, then, have proved, we think, that we are not so\r\nhelpless as we had imagined to resist the evil. But we cannot help\r\nfeeling, that we have laid bare in this exposition some most distressing\r\ninferences concerning the human mind. For, in truth, can anything be\r\nmore deplorable, than thus to see the civilized nations of Europe\r\nendure, from century to century, these reiterated outbreaks of cattle\r\ntyphus, and to see likewise that no man of sufficient energy and\r\nindependence has yet arisen to tell the truth fearlessly to the\r\ngovernments and peoples, however painful that truth may be, and to\r\nexpose the futility of the measures hitherto employed to arrest the\r\nscourge?\r\n\r\nAnd, on the other hand, is it not most afflicting to see discoveries of\r\nindisputable value buried out of view, submerged in public libraries,\r\nutterly unknown and forgotten, like their authors, to such a degree,\r\nthat the distemper which they have made known in its entirety, and which\r\nis as old as the world itself, seems to us almost new in 1865?\r\n\r\nGod send, that these cruel trials and severe lessons which the past has\r\nbequeathed to us may teach us something for our benefit! May the\r\nirresistible might which is derived from the auspicious union of capital\r\nand intelligence supersede the vain and flimsy efforts of isolated\r\nenergy! May the government, which lavishes hundreds of millions upon the\r\ndestructive engines of war, devote some portion of its ample means to\r\nthe study of hereditary infections and contagious diseases! For these\r\nfatal epidemics decimate men as well as cattle, and we may at least ward\r\noff from our children the desolating disease which at present afflicts\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nWe possess already every requisite means to protect ourselves from the\r\nformidable visitation of these diseases: we have science; we have the\r\nmen who cultivate and teach it; we have the experience of the past\r\nadded to our own. To-day, we are called upon to resist the baleful\r\neffects of cattle typhus; but another epizootia may come to-morrow, and\r\nstrike our horses and our sheep--those domestic animals which constitute\r\nour most precious possession. The cholera hovers about us. If we do\r\nnothing, if we talk and debate instead of acting, these scourges will\r\ncome upon us on a sudden, and find us quite as helpless as ever to\r\nresist their sway.\r\n\r\nThese palpable truths deserve to be further developed, and will be\r\ntreated more copiously at the end of this book. They will constitute the\r\ncomplement of our work, necessarily written in haste, since the danger\r\nwe had to expose was itself so urgent and alarming.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] To assist the researches of other inquirers on this vital subject,\r\nnow so generally interesting, we may add, that the cattle treatises\r\nalready referred to--of Malcolm Flemming and Peter Layard--are to be\r\nfound in the Library of the British Museum, bound together in a single\r\nvolume, which is certainly worth ten times its weight in gold. It\r\ncontains, indeed, eight different opuscula, all relating to cattle\r\ncomplaints, which scientific students may consult with real\r\ngratification. I will here transcribe the titles of the most important\r\nof these treatises, the pregnant expositions of the two English\r\nphysicians above-named.\r\n\r\nThat of Malcolm Flemming:\r\n\r\n\"A Proposal, in order to Diminish the Progress of the Distemper among\r\nthe Horned Cattle, supported by Facts.

This must, indeed, be the case, since\r\nafter these disorders have been once developed those who have been cured\r\nof them are not apt to contract them again, the morbid developments\r\nhaving destroyed that natural aptitude which had previously existed to\r\nundergo the morbid action of the contagious virus. These diseases are\r\nnot numerous; they constitute a very distinct class, and the same laws,\r\nwhich regulate the phenomena in one of them are applicable to all the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThese diseases exhibit the following characteristics: 1st, a period of\r\nincubation, during which the whole economy, more particularly the blood\r\nand humours, experience very important changes and modifications; 2nd, a\r\nfebrile state, which varies in its continuous or intermittent types, and\r\nin its intensity, according to the species of the animals, and which\r\nproceeds from the alteration of the blood; 3rd, a revulsion at once\r\ntoxical and congestive towards the nervous centre, inducing _stupor_;\r\n4th, a flux of mucus from the mouth and chest; 5th, a more intense,\r\ncongestive, and inflammatory flux or discharge from the external or\r\ninternal teguments--the skin or the mucous membrane of the digestive\r\nchannels; 6th, a period of adynamia and dejection, with a tendency, in\r\nsome cases, to a critical or salutary rejection of the morbid matter by\r\nthe development of tumours or abscesses in the skin; 7th, they are at\r\nonce infectious and contagious, epizootic or epidemic; that is to say,\r\nthey are transmitted in different degrees by contact, by inoculation,\r\nand at a distance by the means of vitiated air; 8th, finally--and this\r\nis their leading characteristic--_they are not subject to recurrence_,\r\neach individual that has once been affected, losing in general all\r\naptitude to contract the disease a second time.\r\n\r\nThis last characteristic, when well understood, ought in reason to\r\ninduce us to have recourse to the preventive treatment, and such has\r\nbeen the case with respect to the most virulent amongst them--small-pox\r\nand the typhus of the ox.\r\n\r\nPrompted by these principles, which are as logical and fixed as any\r\nmathematical deduction, I suggested in 1855 that inoculation should be\r\napplied in typhoid fever, which is nothing else but the equivalent of\r\nintestinal small-pox, in order to prevent the disease in men. But if the\r\nsimplest truth sometimes requires a contest of ages before it is heard\r\nand understood, I could not hope to fix attention on a fact which might\r\nbe taken as problematical. I felt that I was outrunning time, and that I\r\nshould neither be heard nor understood; and so it has proved.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, these typhous diseases have, as is seen, their laws\r\nand foreseen development. They attack animals generally, but chiefly\r\nherbivorous animals, endowed, as we have shown in the first part, with a\r\nvital resistance which is, relatively speaking, very inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThese febrile typhous diseases (whether their development is caused by a\r\nspontaneous morbid action in the patient or by an evident contagion),\r\nhave a period of incubation during which the vital strength undergoes\r\nlatent morbid modifications, though not sufficient to indicate, save in\r\ntimes of epizootics and epidemics, the particular form which is about to\r\nreveal its symptoms in the course of a few days. This period of\r\nincubation being over, the mouth and chest become affected, and fever\r\ndeclares itself; and then the _materies morbi_, which is to become the\r\nspecial and dominant characteristic of the distemper, is directed either\r\nto the skin, or to the digestive mucous membrane. In the first case, we\r\nsee evidence of exanthematic diseases, which present only the lightest\r\nforms of detersive disorders, such as measles, scarlatina, or that more\r\nserious one, from its pustulous form, the small-pox. In the second case,\r\nthe elimination takes place from the intestinal canal, and then we see\r\nproduced in animals, as well as in men, the typhous diseases: that is to\r\nsay, the typhoid fever--a pustulous and ulcerous malady of the\r\nintestines--or the common typhus of the hospitals, prisons, and\r\ncampaigning armies; and again, in animals, there is also the typhus of\r\nthe steppes, of the marshes, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern pestilence, the plague of Rome in the age of Antoninus and\r\nthe plague of Athens, which might have given to Hippocrates the right\r\nof treating with Artaxerxes as one potentate treats with another, ought\r\nperhaps to be classed among those typhuses not subject to recurrence.\r\n\r\nAs for the _cholera_, it seems to be a contagious and epidemic disorder,\r\nof a distinct and particular kind. We are ignorant of its essential\r\ncause, its nature, and its mode of treatment; and although it has\r\nprevailed in every age, and even frequently of late years, it will\r\nalways, by reason of the strange formation of our medical institutions,\r\nfind us as weak and defenceless to resist its attack as we have ever\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nIf we have been properly understood, typhous diseases are, above all,\r\ngeneral febrile affections. At one time the _materies morbi_, or\r\ndischarge, affects the skin; at another, the digestive mucous membrane.\r\nWhen it acts upon the skin, as clinical observation shows, there is\r\nsometimes a sort of hesitation in the eruptive process; people wonder\r\nwhat disease is coming forth; the eruption wavers in the form it will\r\nassume, till at length its real character is determined. The same\r\nuncertainty prevails when the intestines are affected. Sometimes the\r\nexanthema is merely the equivalent of simple measles or scarlatina of\r\nthe intestinal mucous membrane, and many typhoid fevers of short\r\ncontinuance are nothing else in their nature. The same occurs in common\r\ntyphuses. Sometimes the local affection proceeds as far as pustulous\r\neruption, sometimes only to exanthematic rubefaction; hence the various\r\nalterations which we have witnessed in the intestines of cattle killed\r\nin our presence at the slaughter-houses of the Metropolitan Market, and\r\nwhich we ourselves dissected. The experienced Professor Bouley, from the\r\nEcole Vétérinaire of Alfort, near Paris, whose visit must have been\r\nbeneficial to England, clearly recognised in an ox which was slaughtered\r\nand dissected at the Metropolitan Market, the genuine pustule of typhoid\r\nfever. But in most cases, as we shall show, it is the other forms which\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nWe make these observations in order to anticipate the objections of\r\nthose reasoners who, being more influenced and guided by the local facts\r\nand by the symptoms, than by the general phenomena of comparative\r\npathology, might argue that such or such fact is opposed to our\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nIn a word, then, typhous diseases have their types; but the living being\r\nis subjected to so many different influences, hereditary, idiosyncratic,\r\nclimataic, hygienic, &c., that by the side of one subject going through\r\nthe course of morbid phenomena with fatal regularity, another may be\r\nseen in which such or such functional derangement is readily\r\ndistinguished. Thus in some animals, predisposed thereto by prior\r\ndisorders, the morbid action originally propelled towards the channels\r\nof respiration will continue to be most salient; and after dissection\r\nthe lungs will be congested and emphysematous, and the intestines\r\nrelatively but scarcely altered. The animal, indeed, though bordering on\r\ntyphus, will sink under the effect of functional derangement in the\r\nbreathing passages. In others, by the influence of some particular\r\npredisposing cause, disorders of the nervous centres will be signalized;\r\na cerebral and spinal pains will be intolerable, delirium will quickly\r\nensue, and the asphyxiated patient, if a man, will succumb in the course\r\nof a few days; or if an ox, he will be wild and ungovernable, and then\r\nfall as if thunderstruck, fastened to his stall. Finally, in other\r\ncases, these first two phases of the distemper will not prove fatal, the\r\nintestinal injuries will pursue their course, and the affected animals\r\nwill not die until the third period.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the morbid phenomena may be different, although the\r\naffection continues the same; the typhoid fever or the typhus being\r\nnevertheless the essential disease which prevails.\r\n\r\nThese generalities, to some readers, may appear irrelevant, but let them\r\nnot be mistaken; they have a claim to our notice, and are really\r\nimportant. They show, indeed, that independent of the preventive\r\ntreatment, which is an absolute rule in the case of virulent,\r\ncontagious, and non-recurring diseases, the treatment of the disease\r\nitself, when it has declared itself, and when it pursues its course,\r\ncannot be the same for every patient; and that, moreover, this treatment\r\nmust vary in the different phases of the disease, as physicians and\r\nveterinarians are well aware.\r\n\r\nThese generalities, likewise, explain the various diseases--viz., those\r\nin which the animals blend together the typhous and exanthematic\r\ndiseases. The measles and the scarlet fever, affecting the external or\r\ninternal membranes, are like the first steps of these maladies; they are\r\ngenerally slight, and we have but to watch over the progress of the\r\nsymptoms, and to assist nature, which, with few exceptions, brings all\r\nthings to a favourable issue.\r\n\r\nThese disorders, which are relatively slight and do not provoke in the\r\neconomy any of those changes which in some sort transform the\r\nconstitution, are not absolutely proof against relapse. They lead us\r\nrationally and by degrees to the more infectious and contagious\r\ndiseases, to the common typhus; therefore it is unnecessary to apply the\r\npreventive treatment to them, that being exclusively reserved for the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nLet it then be well understood, that the typhus of the ox, the study of\r\nwhich we are about to enter upon, may vary in its symptoms and\r\npost-mortem appearances, without losing thereby the characteristic mark\r\nwhich renders it a thoroughly distinct, and, in the present day, a\r\nthoroughly well known distemper.\r\n\r\nNow that the reader possesses these general notions of the Contagious\r\nTyphus, we shall be able to speak to him in a language which he will\r\nunderstand, and give a definition which he will be able to judge and\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\nThe typhus of the ox, then, is a _virulent, contagious, febrile, and\r\nnon-recurring disease, with stupor and derangement of the nervous,\r\nrespiratory, and digestive functions; leaving various changes in the\r\nrespective organs of these functions, and chiefly in the intestines_.\r\n\r\nThis new definition seems to us to be more faithful and just than those\r\nhitherto given; and this, if needed, we could demonstrate.\r\n\r\nI do not disguise from myself that some of the opinions expressed in\r\nthese generalities may, at first sight, appear strange and liable to\r\nobjection. Thus, it may be argued that inoculation as a preventive\r\ntreatment of typhous maladies is far from being a general law,\r\napplicable to every case; since in Russia, for instance, where this\r\ninoculation is practised every day, it completely fails in certain\r\nforeign herds, and they die of the consequences of the operation; and\r\nthat this, therefore, might happen in England.\r\n\r\nTo these objections we would reply, first, as regards the novelty of\r\nopinions expressed, that we have taken up the pen, because we had to\r\nwrite something different from what has already been published in known\r\nworks, otherwise it would have been our duty to remain silent; and\r\nsecondly, as regards the inefficacy of inoculation, that organic and\r\nvital phenomena have their principles and their laws, which are fixed\r\nand invincible, from which it is reasonable to deduce consequences and\r\npositive rules of conduct, which cannot yield to superannuated opinions\r\nor imperfectly executed experiments. To institute experiments indeed\r\nunder the rigorous conditions of a logical and irrefutable\r\ndemonstration, is not so easy a matter as may generally be thought.\r\n\r\nFor our part, the principles deduced from strict observation are the\r\nbasis on which we build, and if it so chance that we are baffled in our\r\nexperiments we vary them indefinitely; and if still we are deceived in\r\nour hopes, we ascribe the miscarriage to our impotence, to inadequate\r\nmeans, and to the defective instruments which the physical and chemical\r\nsciences, still in their cradle as regards organic matter, supply for\r\nour use. Above all, we wish it to be remembered--\"_Scribo nec ficta, nec\r\npicta, sed quæ ratio, sensus, et experientia docent._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_The Origin and Causes of the Ox Typhus._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nI have drawn my conclusions as to the preventive treatment of typhus in\r\nthe ox, from the knowledge I had acquired of its morbid phenomena, its\r\nnature, and its non-recurrence; and it is a logical deduction quite as\r\naccurate as could be the result of a syllogism. The study of the origin\r\nof this typhus, and of the causes by which it is generated and spread\r\nabroad, will supply us with additional arguments to sustain this\r\ndeduction, as well as those signs and indications which are the very\r\nfoundation of curative treatment. The description of the disease will\r\ncontribute to the same result; for the rational treatment of a distemper\r\ncan be derived only from a knowledge of all the phenomena which occasion\r\nit, of the functional derangements, and of the alterations observed in\r\nbodies after death.\r\n\r\nI wish particularly to say at once, in entering upon the subject of\r\netiology, that the special works which treat of it contain precise\r\ninformation as to the causes and origin of the typhus in horned cattle;\r\nand that the chief organs of the press in every country--those ephemeral\r\nencyclopædias in which unfortunately so much vital force and\r\nintelligence are dissipated--have published articles of the highest\r\ninterest on this subject. It would be physically impossible for me to\r\nbegin again a bibliographical labour similar to the one exhibited in the\r\nFirst Part, in order to afford due justice to each of these public\r\nwriters, who have met the epizootia on the confines of their country and\r\nfought hand to hand with it. This work is not susceptible of so much\r\nenlargement. Let it be well understood, that I claim no other merit than\r\nthat of discussing these questions of etiology, in that order and with\r\nthat common sense which fix ideas firmly in the mind--which, if I may\r\nuse the term, _photograph_ them on those parts of the brain allotted to\r\nthe memory and judgment; also of drawing from known and admitted facts\r\nmore rational and practical conclusions than those which have been\r\ncurrent up to the present time.\r\n\r\nMuch has been already said and argued on the origin of the contagious\r\ntyphus which affects the ox; some adhering exclusively to the special\r\nconditions observable in the breed of those oxen which are reared and\r\nfed on the steppes of Russia and Hungary; others, more reasonably, as it\r\nseems to us, ascribing it to the hygienic conditions generally, that is\r\nto say, to the climate, the season, the feeding, &c., &c., amidst which\r\nthese animals are living.\r\n\r\nAll these discussions upon what has been said and argued on this subject\r\nhave been very useful. For, had it been rigidly proved that the oxen of\r\nthe steppes, by some peculiar organization, carry within them those\r\ngerms or physiological elements which at given times become the leaven\r\nof the distemper, and, at a subsequent period, the elements of the\r\ncontagion, then, indeed, a fact of capital importance and prominent\r\nauthority would have been established, and the attention of all men\r\ninterested in these inquiries would have been exclusively concentrated\r\non that particular race of animals and on those countries smitten with\r\nthe curse, in order to arrest and confine the disease within its one and\r\nonly focus.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of this theory, concerning the first circumscribed origin\r\nof the typhus, maintain that all the epizootics whose deplorable history\r\nwe have given in the first part of this work, have had no other\r\ngenerative causes than the propagation of the complaint, born and\r\nbegotten on the banks of the Wolga and the Danube, and subsequently\r\nconveyed to the different parts of the earth by the emigration of the\r\ncattle. And in this manner, too, they have accounted for the appearance\r\nof the typhus in South America, in Africa, and in Asia.\r\n\r\nSince this doctrine on the origin of the typhus has been conceived and\r\nmaintained by men of a high order of understanding, we must suppose that\r\nthey had been struck and convinced by important facts and serious\r\nreasons; and as it would be unfair to oppose a plain denial to an\r\nopinion now so generally adopted, we are bound to say in what manner\r\nthese authors justify their views, after which we shall endeavour to\r\nrefute them.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of the circumscribed origin, who make it depend\r\nexclusively on the peculiar organization of the race of the steppes,\r\nhave based their argument, peremptory and unanswerable as they imagine,\r\non the prime fact, that it has always been possible to trace the\r\ndiffusion of the typhus in a given country, to some sick animal of the\r\nsteppes conveyed to that kingdom. In this manner it is, that they\r\nexplain the generation of the epizootics which have so frequently wasted\r\nthe continent of Europe. On whatever point of the globe they may appear,\r\nthis, and only this, is the source of their existence. The isolated\r\nposition of Great Britain is made to support their arguments. \"Behold,\"\r\nthey exclaim, \"Great Britain, which, thanks to its surrounding seas, has\r\nescaped most of the epizootics which have desolated France and Germany\r\nduring the early part of the nineteenth century.\" Nay, more, the present\r\nvisitation of the distemper is also seized upon to sustain their theory,\r\nsince certain oxen, natives of the steppes, appear to have imported it\r\ninto London.\r\n\r\nWe must add, that nothing is wanting in order to prove this assertion;\r\nfor they relate with perfect regularity, and step by step, the course\r\ntaken by the contagion; they specify the time occupied on its passage,\r\nand even the names of the infected vessels which have thus imported the\r\nprinciple of the typhus.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that all the facts thus stated are indisputable; we\r\nacknowledge as true, that the bovine race of the steppes has conveyed\r\ninto other countries the contagious germs of the disease; we admit that\r\nits dissemination may be thus accounted for.\r\n\r\nBut to admit this fact, and to draw from it the conclusion that the\r\nbovine race of the steppes alone is capable, by some particular and\r\ndistinct organization, of developing the original typhus of the ox, and\r\nthat this typhus has no other focus on the earth than the banks of the\r\nDnieper and the Don, does not appear to us a sound logical deduction.\r\nAnd as, if this conclusion were positively recognised, we might see but\r\none side of the evil, and deduce very serious consequences therefrom, it\r\nis necessary to receive these facts for what they are worth, and no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nLet us first observe, that those writers who ascribe the contagious\r\ntyphus to the race of Southern Russia, do not take into consideration\r\nthe epizootics of this typhus, the account of which has been handed down\r\nto us by the ancient authors of Greece and Rome; and that they refer\r\njust as little to those which are quite as frequent in the republics of\r\nSouth America as on the banks of the Dnieper. For even if we allow that\r\nonce, and only once, one of these epizootics may be traced to the\r\narrival of a ship containing oxen brought from the steppes, how, on the\r\nother hand, can we believe that all other epizootics have had such a\r\nfortuitous cause to generate it; consequently, the typhus, in these\r\ncases, must have been locally developed and diffused among American\r\ncattle?\r\n\r\nMoreover, we seek in vain for the reasons which would authorize us to\r\nassign to the bovine race of the steppes a particular organization,\r\nrendering it alone fit to engender the typhus. But let us grant for a\r\nmoment, that the Russian and Hungarian oxen constitute a peculiar race,\r\nas their framework and the length of their horns would seem to imply;\r\nthis much being conceded, it still remains to be shown in what respect\r\ntheir anatomical and physiological structure differs from that of other\r\nanimals to such an extent as to render them alone liable to originate\r\nthis fatal typhus.\r\n\r\nOh! if it were true that the bovine race of the steppes alone could\r\nengender the typhus! we would hail the fact with joy, and would show\r\nwithout much exertion of reasoning that, in that case, we possessed not\r\nonly the means of preventing the disease by inoculating sound and\r\nhealthy cattle, but the far more important means of sweeping it for ever\r\nfrom the earth, by at once exterminating that cursed race, smitten with\r\nthe original predisposition of this plague; and as, after all, the\r\nmurderous scourge of the typhus of the steppes has already cost, and may\r\nperhaps continue to cost the various nations of the Old World millions\r\nupon millions, they would feel that their most urgent interest would be\r\nto come to an understanding (nor would the sacrifice be too much for\r\ntheir resources) so as to destroy and extirpate the evil at its original\r\nsource. There would then be no difficulty in raising up a new breed of\r\ncattle in those countries, by transporting to it those of other nations\r\nfree from the infection.\r\n\r\nBut who does not understand that this heroic sacrifice would be\r\nillusory, and that the foreign races, modified in time in this new\r\nmedium, would regenerate the typhus; so that the double sacrifice of\r\nextermination and indemnity would have been made to no purpose?\r\n\r\nWe wish we could adopt this hypothesis, so simple and so consolatory, of\r\nthe circumscribed origin of the typhus, and its exclusive propagation\r\nthrough the race of the steppes; but our mind is altogether opposed to\r\nthat view, and for the following reasons, amongst others:--\r\n\r\nIf the bovine race of the steppes alone could produce the typhic virus,\r\nby reason of a particular organization which is the prime condition of\r\nits existence, _this race alone would of necessity be fit to receive its\r\ntaint_ by the influence of contagion. But if the other animals of the\r\nsame species, as unfortunately too surely happens, can receive the\r\nprinciple of the disorder, develop the ailment, and die of its effects,\r\nthen the reasoning of our opponents is faulty from its source; and it\r\nmust be admitted that all horned cattle are apt to generate the typhic\r\nvirus in those countries which afford the conditions of its production,\r\nand that this exclusive predisposition as it is called, attributed to\r\nthe race inhabiting the steppes, is simply a chimera.\r\n\r\nBut arguments are seldom exhausted even to defend a bad cause, and it is\r\nobjected that the fact that all oxen may contract the typhus transmitted\r\nby the contact of animals from one to another, does not prove that the\r\noriginal predisposition is the same in every race; and they persist in\r\nmaintaining--1st, that the typhus of the steppes is alone able\r\noriginally to beget the disease; 2nd, that having thus begotten and\r\nproduced it, it becomes, after this organic conception, apt to be\r\ntransmitted to every animal, and fit to be assimilated with them.\r\n\r\nTo these subtleties and argumentative refinements it would be as easy\r\nfor me to oppose abstract reasonings equally strong, as it would have\r\nbeen for the Jansenists and Mollinists, had it so chanced that they had\r\nbeen drawn into a debate on the origin and nature of the virus of the\r\nplague which carried off Jansenius. But let us confine ourselves to\r\nserious facts and conclude--\r\n\r\n1st. That we have no proof of any anatomical and physiological\r\ndifference in the humours or in the blood--that is to say, in the\r\norganic, intimate, and biological elements of the individuals which\r\ncollectively constitute the bovine species.\r\n\r\n2nd. That we have a right to believe, that all horned cattle are apt to\r\ndevelop the typhic virus when they are placed within the conditions\r\nrequired for that effect--that is to say, when they are exposed to the\r\nspecial morbific causes which form its condition _sine quâ non_, and\r\nwhich are met with on the banks of those great rivers which water\r\nSouthern Russia and Hungary, in Africa, on the banks of the Nile, in\r\nSouth America, on the margins of the lakes, and in what are called hot\r\nclimates, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBut if the origin of the typhus cannot exclusively depend on the\r\npeculiar organization of certain individuals of the bovine species, we\r\nmust inquire after and search for the real causes which produce it.\r\n\r\nWe have explained already, in the First Part, what alterations organic\r\nmatter undergoes in general, when accidental causes happen to modify its\r\norganic elements; and we have pointed out the fact, that of all living\r\ncreatures herbivorous animals were those that offered the least vital\r\nresistance to the causes of disease and destruction.\r\n\r\nThis unquestionable fact being taken for granted, let us now consider\r\nunder what conditions live the multitudinous herds of horned cattle\r\nwhich in Russia and in South America are reared and supported solely for\r\nthe produce of their flesh, and sometimes, too, for that of their hides.\r\n\r\nThe great breeders and proprietors fix the number of their heads of\r\ncattle according and in proportion to the quantity of the pastures, but\r\nlike other men, they mortgage the future for their benefit without\r\nmaking due allowance for accidents or extreme changes of weather, as\r\nwhen years of unusual drought succeed those of heavy rain; so that these\r\nherds, by the single fact of these extreme fluctuations in the degrees\r\nof temperature, are exposed to a multiplicity of causes productive of\r\ndisease. The same nature which generates life and health generates\r\ndisease and dissolution, and when the former are neglected the latter\r\nwill prevail.\r\n\r\nIn the prosperous and favoured countries of the temperate zone, such as\r\nEngland and France, these extreme variations in the seasons, which are\r\nalways the cause of a deficiency or alteration in the production of\r\nfodder, are equally the cause of the numerous epizootics which attack\r\nall the herbivorous species, and particularly those to which oxen fall\r\nvictims, such as the tumourous typhus (_le typhus charbonneux_), the\r\nso-called aphthous fever, the contagious peripneumonia (which is not\r\nliable to return and is prevented by inoculation), parasitical cutaneous\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nBut in less favoured countries, in those which are damp, argillaceous,\r\nswampy, inundated by the overflows of their lakes and rivers, or by the\r\nreflux of the sea, there is deposited a slimy or brackish water, which a\r\ntemporary torrid heat afterwards causes to ferment; and then a\r\nsuperabundance of life, a teeming vegetation, springs up in all\r\ndirections. In the midst of this swarming vitality live and thrive an\r\ninfinity of worms, maggots, animalculæ, insects, mollusca, fish,\r\nreptiles, birds, &c.; and here, too, all these creatures die and decay,\r\nwhen this slime, the prolific source of generations which we might look\r\nupon as spontaneous, begins to dry up and disintegrate. Then from these\r\norganic vegetable and animal matters, in a state of decomposition,\r\nescape those deleterious gases, such as hydrogen, carbonic oxide,\r\nnitrogen, carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and even phosphoretted\r\nhydrogen.\r\n\r\nOften to all these causes of infection are added myriads of\r\ngrasshoppers, which cover the ground, where they die, aggravating the\r\nmass of pestiferous vapour which fills the atmosphere. Finally, the\r\nwater which slakes the thirst of the herds of cattle is corrupted; the\r\nplants on which they feed distil poisons; the air, the water, and the\r\nplants, carry within them a principle of venom and death. After this,\r\nhow can we be surprised if this flood of putrid emanations is\r\ntransformed into a contagious typhic virus, whose subtle and\r\npestilential effluvia are conveyed by the ox to considerable distances?\r\n\r\nIn fine, let us recapitulate in our minds all the causes of destruction\r\nto which these passive creatures are exposed, and we shall acknowledge\r\nthat there is no necessity to attribute to them a peculiar organization\r\nin order to understand the development of the typhus, which, at a given\r\nmoment, cuts them all off; and that in the deltas of the different\r\ncountries, as well in Asia, Africa, and America, as in Europe, are to be\r\nfound those conditions of infectious disease which we have described. In\r\nthese causes, and only in these causes, or in those which resemble them,\r\nwill rational men seek for the principle of the contagious typhus in the\r\nbovine race.\r\n\r\nMoreover, who is there who does not understand that what is true with\r\nregard to cholera is likewise applicable to this contagious typhus? The\r\ncholera, for causes analogous to these, subject to the particular state\r\nof the soil, is generated, not exclusively, it is true, but most\r\nfrequently, on the banks of the Ganges, in the same manner as the\r\ncontagious typhus is developed in certain countries where its natural\r\nfocus is found.\r\n\r\nThe race of animals which exists on this deadly and destructive soil is\r\nan instrument of incubation for typhus, not in consequence of their\r\npeculiar structure, but because the conditions under which they live\r\ncondemn them to this fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nNow the breeding of cattle, and the feeding and fattening of them for\r\nthe market, constitute a branch of industry--a great interest. They all\r\nhave to be removed, conveyed to various distances, and sold; so that\r\nthis traffic becomes a new cause to be added to all those which foster,\r\ndevelop and propagate the distemper.\r\n\r\nIn prosperous times, when the seasons, conformably with our wishes, have\r\npursued a course which we call regular (for we are fain to believe that\r\nthe planets turn on their axes on our account), and when the cattle find\r\nthe ground covered with rich pastures, and limpid streams--conditions\r\nwhich are eminently favourable in themselves, though in Hungary it is\r\nnecessary to add gum, salt, mineral water, and arsenic acid, before the\r\nhealth of these animals is satisfactory,--then the cattle breeders make\r\ntheir sordid calculations, and select the heads of cattle intended for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nWith animals, as with man, health is but relative, not absolute; the\r\nhealthiest in appearance often bearing within its frame the fatal\r\nprinciple of no distant death. Fatness not being by any means a sure\r\nsign of vital strength, many of these cumbersome beasts, though\r\nseemingly in good and sound condition, contain in their systems, in\r\nvarious stages of incubation, the tainted leaven of contagious\r\naffections, such as peripneumonia, or even the typhus itself.\r\n\r\nBut, regardless of this liability, their sale and migration are resolved\r\nupon at length. Hitherto these harmless creatures have lived in the most\r\nperfect stillness and retirement. Their calm, monotonous life has been\r\nas regular as the course of time; never by a single pulsation have their\r\nhearts exceeded the wonted number per minute; they are all gifted with a\r\nnervous sensibility of which the vulgar have no notion. Some favoured\r\nfew have felt the sympathy of friendship for the herdsman who tended\r\nthem, and for the companions with which they fed. They have been leaders\r\nof their own herd, they have marched at their head; they have given the\r\nsignal when to seek shelter beneath the trees, or when to repair to the\r\nbrook. They have loved the fields amidst which they have grown and\r\nthriven. Some of them, reared and fed beneath the domestic thatch, were\r\ngrateful for the care they had received; their master was endeared to\r\nthem, they would run to meet his coming, answer to their name, and lick\r\nhis hand with fondness.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the course of this tranquil, this happy existence, that is\r\nabout to be broken abruptly. It is this creature, the pattern of\r\ngentleness and goodness, that we are going to treat like a heap of\r\ninsensible and inert matter--which we are going to subject to\r\nunutterable torture!\r\n\r\nAnd now, indeed, these creatures are all at once handed over to the\r\nsavage guidance, to the thongs and cudgels, of a hind, whose cruelty\r\nkeeps pace with his stolid ignorance, and who abets his dogs to quicken\r\ntheir course to the neighbouring market. From this moment, half-fed and\r\nathirst, these poor animals are forced to make long journeys afoot; or\r\nsince the construction of railways, to be heaped together confusedly in\r\na locomotive pen. There, the shaking, the sudden starts, the friction of\r\nfive hundred wheels on the rails, the horrid snorting of the engines,\r\nalarm and terrify them to such a degree as to turn the whole mass of\r\ntheir blood.\r\n\r\nIn such a state of vital prostration or feverish excitement, entire\r\nherds are carried to the public markets or to annual fairs with other\r\nanimals, and nearly all sent to the shambles. But some amongst them are\r\nreserved for another fate. The females, for instance, are set apart to\r\nserve as milch cows; and in this manner they carry with them into the\r\ncowsheds, wherein they are received, the taint of those contagious\r\ndistempers, the germs of which lay concealed in their frames, or which\r\nthey have contracted from the companions of their journey.\r\n\r\nSome of these heads of cattle, starting from the steppes of Russia, have\r\nto travel five hundred miles in an open cage, less cared for and\r\nprotected than bales of merchandise, exposed to the rain, to the heat\r\nof the sun, to sudden changes of temperature, to cold and cutting\r\ndraughts, increased by the rapid motion of the train;--these animals,\r\nfoundered, prostrate, panting with fever and torturing pains, still have\r\nto undergo new trials, if they cross the sea. In this case, the wretched\r\nvictims are violently expelled from the locomotive, rocking sheds of the\r\nrailway; a leathern strap hanging from a crane lifts them into the air,\r\nand lets them down into the mid-deck of a ship, where they are crowded\r\nas closely together as possible, for here, too, space is very costly.\r\nFinally, the vessel gets under way and ploughs the ocean; contrary winds\r\nbeat it about in every direction, and these poor creatures have to\r\nendure a new kind of torture, accompanied by the intolerable pangs of\r\nsea-sickness; and in this state it is that they alight on the British\r\nsoil, and are driven off to the different markets.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to expatiate at length on the state of general derangement\r\nand disease in which these oxen reach their final destination. Some\r\namongst them have endured for eight or nine days these unspeakable\r\ntortures, without being sustained by nourishment--for no animal, when\r\nhis spirits forsake him, can assimilate his food amidst all this\r\nphysical suffering and so great a shock to his nervous system.\r\n\r\nLet us here declare that these animals, though removed from their\r\nmeadows with all the signs and appearances of sound health, at a time\r\nwhen a fine season had been productive of abundance, and when no\r\nepizootia was raging in the country which they have left, may\r\nnevertheless bear within them the taint of contagious typhus; and let us\r\nask ourselves what must come to pass in those disastrous years when this\r\ntyphus prevails under the influence of those destructive causes which\r\nwere passed in review just now, and when the Russian and Hungarian\r\nproprietors, eager to forestall an inevitable general calamity, hasten\r\nto send off to Italy, France, Holland, Finland, or to the ports of\r\nEngland, many animals already seized with typhus, and whose virus must\r\nhave acquired infectious properties still more intense and deadly under\r\nthe influence of the deep disquiet and commotion which the removal and\r\nconveyance of these animals, under conditions so deplorable, must have\r\nproduced in their frames.\r\n\r\nSuch are indeed the pernicious conditions in which oxen may be, and\r\noften are, dispatched to England; and such appears to be the real cause\r\nof the outbreak of the spreading epizootia which we witness at this\r\nmoment, and which has created so much alarm in so many counties of\r\nEngland.[B]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider this contagious typhus in its destructive extension\r\nover the British soil; let us study and examine the causes of its\r\ndiffusion as they pass under our notice.\r\n\r\nThe mooted question of determining whether the cattle typhus was\r\noriginally imported from abroad, or whether it broke out spontaneously\r\nin England, has been, and still is, a subject of dubious debate amongst\r\nsome professional men, amongst the leading writers of the public\r\njournals, and also amongst agriculturists and farmers.[C]\r\n\r\nAnd, in truth, the propagation of the distemper is occasionally\r\nwitnessed under conditions so singular and striking, that it seems to\r\nwarrant and supply arguments for every conceivable opinion.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease was recognised and identified for the first time on the\r\n24th of June, 1865, public opinion ascribed its appearance to contagion\r\narising from some diseased cows imported from Finland, and which, after\r\nbeing exposed in the Islington Market on the 19th, were sold and removed\r\nto the cowsheds of a breeder or dairyman.\r\n\r\nWe may observe that, on hearing the intelligence of this sudden\r\ninvasion, the public mind, which is so excitable in England, did not\r\ndisguise the indignation it felt against foreign countries which had\r\nbeen capable of contaminating an island so advantageously situated and\r\nso well protected, and infecting her magnificent herds, exuberant with\r\nhealth. But after a closer examination of the facts, and possibly\r\nalarmed, at the serious consequences of a Continental blockade which\r\nwould deprive the United Kingdom, not of the entire twenty or thirty\r\nthousand live stock, such as oxen, sheep, pigs, &c., which they receive\r\nevery week, but only of the eight or ten thousand head of cattle which\r\nare landed weekly on their coasts to supply their markets, public\r\nopinion was appeased. But, unfortunately, this national susceptibility\r\nnow took the opposite extreme; and the only causes it now saw were the\r\ndirt and want of adequate ventilation in the metropolitan stables and\r\nsheds; and to these causes it attributed, first the generation, and then\r\nthe propagation or diffusion of the malady; an opinion which appeared\r\nall the more natural and reasonable, in that the oxen and cows of the\r\ngraziers were the first victims of the typhus.\r\n\r\nWe all know how liable, among all nations, the public mind is to waver\r\nand fluctuate, and how susceptible and open it is to new impressions\r\nduring fatal visitations and general calamities; nor can we feel the\r\nleast surprise at the uncertainty which has so long prevailed, and still\r\ncontinues, as to the real causes of the introduction of the bovine\r\ntyphus in England.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore examine this question of etiology, and try to discover\r\nwhat opinion ought to prevail.\r\n\r\nIt is important to establish at once two material facts which seem to us\r\nindisputable:\r\n\r\n1st. That the contagious typhus in cattle which is known to be permanent\r\nin the southeast of Europe, actually existed there during the month of\r\nJune, 1865; 2nd, That some of the horned cattle, fed and reared in that\r\npart of Europe, were transported to England, after having crossed\r\nthrough Russia from south to north, in order to avoid passing through\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nAs for the first of these facts, it is admitted and received, as might\r\neasily be proved by reproducing the speeches and addresses delivered by\r\nthe veterinary doctors at the Congress now being held at Vienna, and at\r\nwhich were present the men whose experience of this cattle distemper\r\ngives them the highest authority--Hertwig, Jessen, Röll, Siegmund,\r\nGerlach, &c.\r\n\r\nThe contagious typhus of horned cattle is so fully in the epizootic\r\nstate in those countries which are washed by the Black Sea, that it was\r\nenough for the veterinarians present at the Congress to manifest a\r\ndesire to see cattle afflicted with this disease, for the opportunity so\r\nto do to be immediately afforded them.[D]\r\n\r\nThus, then, the fact is undeniable, the contagious typhus was raging, in\r\nJune, 1865, in Hungary and Russia, as it rages there at all times.\r\n\r\nAs for the conveyance of cattle from those countries into England, the\r\nfact is no less certain and assured. It is well known that a convoy of\r\n300 heads of cattle, proceeding from the pasture-grounds of Hungary and\r\nAustria, was transported into Finland by rail, and afterwards shipped at\r\nRevel for England. Thanks to the rapid locomotion by steam, the\r\nmigration of these cattle had lasted but ten days--two days for the\r\ntransport by land, and eight days for the passage by sea, through the\r\ntortuous line of the Baltic; but this was sufficient length of time for\r\nthe incubation to be produced, even supposing the animals to have looked\r\nsound when their transit began.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is indubitable that the markets of this immeasurable London\r\nhave for many years been supplied with horned cattle from every country:\r\nfrom France, Holland, Belgium, Podolia, Poland, Prussia, Austria,\r\nHungary, and Russia.\r\n\r\nThus, the Islington Market (the fact is assured) had received horned\r\ncattle imported from the countries where typhus is known to be\r\npermanent. Were these cattle thus imported affected with the typhus?\r\nThis fact likewise is as certain as the other, since two of the foreign\r\ncows thus imported, were the first to fall sick, and to die of this\r\ntyphus.\r\n\r\nBut if the contagious typhus of horned cattle rages permanently on the\r\nbanks of the streams which discharge themselves into the Black Sea, and\r\nif the beasts reared in those countries have long been transported to\r\nEngland and other countries, how, it will be asked, is it that the\r\ndisease has not broken out more frequently, for it has never been seen\r\nin Great Britain, at least, during the former part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury?\r\n\r\nThis question is not devoid of a certain degree of importance, and\r\ndeserves to fix our attention for a moment.\r\n\r\nNow the conditions in which the animals were exhibited in 1863 and 1864\r\nwere precisely the same as those of 1865, before the outbreak of the\r\ndisease; and yet the contagion has been possible in 1865, whilst it was\r\nnot so in 1863.\r\n\r\nWe do not presume to explain the mysterious phenomena which govern the\r\ndevelopment of epidemics and epizootics; but it seems to us not\r\naltogether impossible to give a rational and satisfactory elucidation of\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nIn general, in _epizootics_, and I might even say in some particular\r\nepidemics--in that of the typhus, for instance--three connected and\r\ninseparable facts form the condition _sine quâ non_, of the generation\r\nof the disease. First, a focus for producing the virus; secondly, for\r\nthe most part a favourable soil, and a special predisposition amongst\r\nanimals to receive and propagate it; thirdly, what is called an epidemic\r\nor epizootic genius--that is to say, a particular state of the\r\natmospheric elements, or the air, which hitherto has escaped our\r\nanalyses, and whose morbific properties vary in their degrees of\r\nintensity. Thus the epizootic genius of 1711, the terrible one of 1750,\r\nand the one which now diffuses its contagious miasma, have differed in\r\nsome of their virulent conditions.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, it will be sufficient to glance back at the past to\r\nassure ourselves that, in general, epizootics have been coincident with\r\nsome violent change of season, such as extreme droughts, or\r\nsuperabundant rains; that is to say, when the cattle, disturbed in the\r\nphysiological conditions of their health, have become favourable to the\r\nincubation of the miasmatic leaven scattered through the air, or else\r\nwhen these animals were living under irregular conditions, and had to\r\nendure unwonted fatigues and privations, as in the folds of campaigning\r\narmies, for instance.\r\n\r\nThese epizootics have appeared to depend not only on the state of the\r\nsoil and of the health of the cattle, but also (we repeat it designedly)\r\non an element no less indispensable to the propagation of the disease--a\r\nspecial state of the air, which favours the development and preservation\r\nof typhic miasma: for sometimes a sudden change of temperature has\r\nproved sufficient to stop the rampant progress of the contagion, the\r\nother conditions remaining unaltered.\r\n\r\nThese relations of cause and effect between the contagious principle,\r\nthe predisposition of the animals, and the state of the atmosphere,\r\nevidently are subject to some exceptions; but we must allow that in the\r\npresent epizootic they are absolutely and completely applicable. For, in\r\ntruth, the years 1864 and 1865 have been distinguished, if not by the\r\npersistency of a high rate of temperature not often witnessed, at least\r\nby an excessive drought during the months which are both hot and rainy;\r\nand this has happened in the various countries of Europe, thereby\r\nproducing a falling off in the pasture and fodder both as respects their\r\nquantity and quality.\r\n\r\nAs to England, a country usually cold and damp, but renowned for its\r\nspacious green fields and meadows, it has suffered more than any other\r\ncountry from these unfavourable conditions, and their destructive\r\ninfluence on the grass and corn; the herds having found a great\r\nreduction of food where formerly they met with abundance. Everybody has\r\nseen, as we have ourselves, large herds of cattle, wandering in\r\namazement from field to field, and seeking for something to browse on a\r\nparched and arid soil. A supplementary provision of corn, roots, malt,\r\nand the grounds of the beer vat or spirit barrel, no doubt served to\r\nmitigate the sad effects of these privations on the health of cattle;\r\nbut in spite of all that could be done, their blood became impoverished,\r\ntheir strength and vital resistance sank, and (like the animals which we\r\ntransferred at will into a soil more favourable to the spread of\r\nparasitic diseases), they afforded last June, as they do now, an unusual\r\npredisposition to suffer and transform the morbific principles of\r\ntyphus, which in all probability they would have been proof against at\r\nany other time. We may very fairly infer this much, for we must of\r\nnecessity believe that the regular importation of cattle from those\r\ncountries which are considered as the permanent focus of typhus, has\r\nfrom time to time transported the miasmatic germs of this malady into\r\nEngland, although the virus did not take effect on British cattle at\r\nthose periods, for want of one or other of the conditions necessary to\r\nits generation and development.\r\n\r\nWe may likewise infer, and a watchful appreciation of the facts\r\ncontained in the veterinary medical journals would show that this\r\nopinion is not unfounded, that the special disease which constitutes\r\nthis typhus (similar in that respect to epidemic diseases), may develop\r\nitself in one beast by accident, spontaneously, sporadically--that is to\r\nsay, without immediate contagion; in a word, _apart from those epizootic\r\nconditions which alone render its propagation possible_. To be brief, we\r\nthink that an isolated case of cattle typhus may by chance be detected,\r\nwhen there is no epizootia prevailing to account for it, just as we\r\noccasionally meet with cases of typhus or cholera among men during\r\nseasons absolutely free from these epidemics. It would not, therefore,\r\nappear to us altogether impossible, that under the influence of very\r\nspecial conditions, the contagious typhus of the ox might have its birth\r\nin England; and this would favour the theory of those reasoners who\r\nmaintain that this typhus met with the first causes, and the origin of\r\nits development, in the stalls and cowsheds of London. But such has not\r\nbeen the cause of cattle typhus in the epizootia which we see at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nNo doubt some animals suffered great privations, but, whatever\r\nalteration their health may have sustained, all this is nothing to be\r\ncompared to the sufferings endured by the cattle in the steppes under\r\nthe influence of deleterious conditions of the most exceptional\r\ncharacter, which do, indeed, give birth to this typhus, and which we\r\nhave already described.\r\n\r\nNo, certainly not! _Nothing authorizes us to believe that the typhus now\r\nunder our observation was bred and born, at first, within the stalls and\r\ncowsheds of London._ It was most assuredly imported. But it is true,\r\nnevertheless, that this cruel scourge found the horned cattle of England\r\npredisposed to receive it, and it likewise met with atmospheric\r\nconditions favourable to its subsequent diffusion; in a word, it met\r\nwith the epizootic genius proper for the generation and propagation of\r\nthe typhus miasma.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that we may account for and reconcile the two contending\r\ntheories, one of which refers the cause of this typhus to foreign\r\nimportation, whilst the other insists that it originated in the filthy\r\nand half-ventilated cowsheds of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nBut if this typhus could not spring up spontaneously out of the bovine\r\nrace of England, it must be confessed that, independently of the general\r\npredisposition due to a great and protracted drought, it found in the\r\nsickening sheds of the metropolitan and country cattle the most\r\nfavourable conditions for its incubation and subsequent diffusion.\r\n\r\nIt would, indeed, be difficult to conceive of anything more directly\r\nadverse to the hygienic laws of health in cattle than the stalls and\r\nsheds dotted over the densely populated districts of London. Most of\r\nthese pent-up cribs are situated in narrow lanes and yards, in filthy\r\nstreets and blind alleys; and within these close, hot, and steaming\r\nreceptacles the miserable cows, pressed against each other, without\r\never moving a limb, waste away and become phthisical in a very short\r\nspace of time. We may readily imagine what a prey to the contagion must\r\nbe afforded by these animals, already more or less ailing, some of which\r\nare fed in a great measure on malt, so sour and acrid that the very\r\nsmell of it is intolerable. The milk from these cows is, moreover, of so\r\nwretched a quality, that in a cowhouse containing 48 of these poor\r\ncreatures, at Kensington, I found only one, the milk of which exhibited\r\nthe taste and quality fit for a sick child, for whom I ordered a milk\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, to be wondered at that the present epizootia,\r\nduring this late tropical season[E] especially, should have met with all\r\nthe conditions most conducive to its development and propagation.\r\n\r\nWhen the cattle distemper first broke out, the graziers, not suspecting\r\nits gravity, attempted to treat the animals themselves, but soon\r\nafterwards perceiving the fruitlessness of all their remedial measures,\r\nthey felt that the best thing they could do was to turn their sick\r\nbeasts to whatever account they could, by driving them to market or to\r\nthe slaughter-houses, an expedient which they were the more disposed to\r\nadopt, inasmuch as the diseased cows had ceased to give milk. And then,\r\nthe removal of these animals, in various stages of the disorder, became\r\nthe most rapid means of disseminating the contagion, which, had it been\r\nconcentrated and pent-up at first within its narrow focus, would\r\notherwise have spread with less fearful havoc.[F]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the sick cows being commingled with thousands of heads\r\nof cattle exposed for sale at the different markets, communicated far\r\nand wide the principle of the disease; and as a certain number of these\r\nanimals remaining unsold were driven back to the farms, into stalls\r\nuntil then removed from every cause of contagion, they introduced among\r\ntheir sound companions the fatal germs of the distemper; and as, again,\r\nthis effectual means of propagating the evil was repeated several times\r\nin the same week, the consequence was that, by the end of July--a little\r\nmore than a month after the outbreak--the whole of the south of England\r\nwas in some sort contaminated. Thence the contagion extended to the\r\nnorth of the kingdom, and passed into Scotland; so that, at present, the\r\ncattle-typhus has spread its ramifications over a great number of the\r\ncounties of Great Britain.[G]\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, the contagion spread from animal to animal by\r\nmeans of an infecting influence in some degree direct, among cattle\r\nsheltered beneath the same roof, or collected in swarms within the same\r\nmarkets. But very soon the air itself was impregnated and polluted by\r\nthe vaporization and diffusion of the typhic miasma; and herds of cattle\r\nwhich had no contact, either direct or indirect, with infected animals,\r\nwere seen to be tainted with the distemper. Whether this contamination\r\nwas produced by the passage of attainted cattle along the public roads\r\n(having fields on the right and left), or otherwise, nothing but an\r\nabsolute isolation, an utter impossibility of contact, appeared to offer\r\na perfect immunity against the spread of the evil.\r\n\r\nThe miasma, condensed by the fogs and transported in all directions by\r\nthe winds, now began to overleap every natural or artificial barrier,\r\nand the favoured herds, ruminating at their ease in the manorial farms\r\nof the wealthy patricians, in their well-kept parks and amid every\r\nluxury, were suddenly smitten with an evil which in their case seemed an\r\nanomaly. In such peaceful homes these innocent creatures were tended by\r\nintelligent and benevolent hands, which understood and felt for their\r\nfrail constitutions; food of the best quality was lavishly supplied to\r\nthem, and whatever they could wish for lay around them in abundance;\r\nrichly reared, they had themselves become so many ornaments within these\r\nscenes of beauty, and all men thought that here, at least, were plots of\r\nrural ground which the genius of epizootia would not invade, and in\r\nwhich the healthy herds were invulnerable to contagion.\r\n\r\nIt was under these circumstances that the fine farms of Earl Granville,\r\nat Golder's Green, skirting the Finchley Road,[H] containing as many as\r\n130 milch cows, were suddenly and fiercely attacked amidst their\r\nseeming immunity, and struck down in great numbers.\r\n\r\n\"When I left England a month ago,\" said the noble lord, \"there were\r\nabout 130 milch cows in four sheds; in the two largest and best managed\r\nI found only one cow yesterday, September 4th.\"\r\n\r\nThe park of Holly Lodge,[I] which is partly bounded by the main road\r\nalong which pass and repass files of cattle going to and coming from the\r\nmarkets, was visited by the same unsparing scourge. Now certainly, the\r\nnoble and beneficent lady of the manor, who secured to her cattle every\r\nattention, and who, confiding in the resources of medical science,\r\nattempted every means to save these stricken creatures doomed to an\r\ninevitable death; she whose enlightened mind, equally open to the claims\r\nof science as to those of misfortune, desired that experiments should be\r\nmade which might tend to throw any light on this devastating malady;\r\nshe, at any rate, one would think, might have escaped the common lot\r\nwithout exciting wonder or envy at the privilege which she enjoyed. But\r\nthis fell and sweeping epizootia, inexorable in its latitudinarian\r\nmarch, entered those shady bounds, and decimated those orderly sheds\r\nwith the same impartiality as it did that of the poor man, Cutting,\r\nwhose whole fortune was stored up in the two milch cows whose death he\r\nhad to deplore.\r\n\r\nThis epizootia threatens to invade, one by one, all the European States,\r\nlike the awful scourge of 1750, to which we have already drawn\r\nattention. For even now Holland and Belgium[J] have been smitten; and\r\nthe alarm it has excited has for a time superseded the panic which the\r\nstealthy advance of the cholera to the west had kindled. Some imagine\r\nthat it might have been kept out of Great Britain, or have been checked\r\nin its outbreak. But, in spite of all the safest precautions and the\r\nsoundest measures of preparation, it would most likely have baffled\r\nhuman skill, and neither been held aloof nor stifled in its focus. But\r\nhow painful it is, to have to write and to think that ignorance,\r\ncarelessness, revolting cupidity, and the most wanton violation of the\r\nlaws, have all contributed to extend the evil, with the foulest\r\npremeditation and the blindest disregard!\r\n\r\nTo feel one's self a stranger in a country, and to be able to rejoice at\r\none's connexions with it, and at the same time to be obliged to give\r\npublicity to certain truths distasteful to those to whom they are told,\r\nis a most painful task. But, as it would be to swerve from that duty and\r\nloyalty which the national interests as well as those of science impose\r\nupon a writer, not to speak out with impartial justice in a matter of so\r\nvital an importance, we beg permission to consider, without reserve,\r\nthis delicate question:--the causes which have contributed to propagate\r\nthe complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nEngland, so long spared by that wasting scourge, which had so often\r\nextended its ravages over France and other kingdoms during the last\r\nsixty years, was taken by surprise; and the regulations and laws\r\nnecessary to stifle without delay the distemper in its focus--that is to\r\nsay, in the metropolis--not being in readiness, the outbreak of the\r\ndisease found her helpless and unarmed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the organic forms of the English Government and\r\nmunicipal bodies, the reserve of the Cabinet during the vacation, the\r\nlimited power of the Lord Mayor and his civic counsellors, the\r\nsubdivision of London into parishes and vestries, as in the good times\r\nof the middle ages, the loose scattering of the shambles and meat\r\nmarkets through the many streets of the huge town, the right asserted by\r\neach man to be absolutely independent and free, the sanctity of the\r\nEnglishman's home, &c., &c., all concurred to let loose and propagate\r\nthe contagion, instead of keeping it within bounds.\r\n\r\nIndeed, whilst the competent authorities, with all the energy which\r\ncould be expected of them on so grave a matter, were meeting and\r\ndiscussing the best measures to be taken, and the interesting debates at\r\nthe Mansion-house were throwing the first light upon the question, the\r\ninsidious malady pursued its destructive progress, diffusing new terror\r\nand alarm. When at length the Privy Council issued their orders,\r\nprescribing the public declaration of sick cattle, and that no affected\r\nbeast was to be conveyed either by rail or by ship, whilst all the\r\nnecessary means of purification and disinfection were to be employed,\r\n&c., it was unfortunately too late, the dreadful calamity having taken\r\nroot and multiplied its stem like the upas-tree.\r\n\r\nWhat a field for reflection there is in these cases, which originating\r\nwith the imperfect state of the laws and institutions, have fostered and\r\nencouraged the disease! But this is a subject which it would not behove\r\nus to discuss, and we prefer to show by the notes which will be found\r\nappended to the end of this work, and which are produced as attesting\r\ndocuments, that cattle proprietors, by their own confession, too often\r\nsacrifice the interests of the public to their own private advantage.[K]\r\n\r\nNor have we been able to participate in the thoughts and reflections of\r\nso many sensible and judicious persons, on the impotence and\r\ndilatoriness of the public authorities, and also, let us say, on the\r\ninadequate pecuniary means proposed by a people so lavish of its wealth\r\nwhen useful and great undertakings are designed, without paying a\r\nnatural tribute of regret, to the memory of a Prince who took so deep an\r\ninterest in the progress of agriculture, and who, had he still been\r\nliving, would have known how to direct with a firm and steady hand, the\r\nright measures to be taken amidst so many intricacies and\r\nembarrassments.\r\n\r\nSometimes allusion has been made to France in the speeches delivered at\r\nthese meetings, presided over by that active magistrate, the Lord Mayor.\r\nIn the course of these remarks the speakers have praised and held up to\r\nadmiration the advantages of her system of centralization, the decrees\r\nof her sanitary police, and the promptness with which she executes the\r\nmeasures which the public interests require. That is true. France is\r\ncertainly in a state to resist the scourge with very effectual means to\r\narrest its progress; but if in this matter, as in some others, she have\r\nacquired a superiority, it has only been by an experience dearly\r\npurchased, these epizootics having returned more than once to destroy\r\nher flocks and herds. Politically, the same might be said of her\r\nrevolutions, those great moral epidemics.\r\n\r\nAn orator, a writer, went so far as to say, in one of his numerous\r\nletters, the one dated the 24th of August: \"I regret to say some of our\r\nneighbours laugh at our expense.\"[L]\r\n\r\nNo, your neighbours will not laugh at your misfortunes. They sympathize\r\nat present both in your joys and sorrows, and if I have taken up my pen\r\non this occasion, it has only been because I could not look with\r\nindifference on your too just anxieties, when I flattered myself that I\r\nmight write some useful pages to mitigate and relieve them.\r\n\r\nAs most newspaper readers are aware,[M] and as everybody may easily\r\nascertain, the diseased cattle, in spite of reiterated orders to destroy\r\nthem immediately, were, nevertheless, driven to the markets to be sold\r\nfor what could be got for them; or when their tainted condition was too\r\nglaring they were at once sent off to the private shambles, the owners\r\nof which, in order to disguise the accusatory proof of the misdemeanor,\r\nhastened to sell the body of the animal. It would be quite impossible to\r\nmention all the violations of the law, which every day continue to fill\r\nthe columns of the public journals. One graceless wretch, who deserved\r\nto be hanged for it, if his ignorance do not excuse him, was so infamous\r\nas to introduce a sick cow into a shed not yet attainted, in his\r\ncriminal desire of propagating the disease there.[N]\r\n\r\nThus, then, independently of the causes inherent to the typhus itself,\r\nwhich served of necessity to diffuse it, other causes proceeding from\r\nthe defective state of the law, and the perfidy of individuals, have\r\ncontributed to its dissemination. And yet the Government circulars, the\r\nnewspapers, and the reports of veterinary doctors have made known that\r\nthe slightest omissions and inattentions were serious--that the want of\r\nventilation and cleanliness in the stables, the overcrowding of the\r\ncattle, and their abiding near their own droppings, or dung-heaps--that\r\nthe keeping of dead bodies close to farms, cowsheds, enclosed grounds,\r\nand fields--that the hasty and imperfect burial of cattle--that the\r\ncollection and transit of their fragments, bones, horns, and skins--that\r\nthe driving on the public roads of any animal either tainted itself, or\r\nhaving lived among those that were sick--that the clothes of persons and\r\nstable utensils, soiled with putrid liquids--that all these, and similar\r\ncauses, were capable of propagating or aggravating the disease.\r\n\r\nBut whilst we must loudly condemn the voluntary misdeeds of those who\r\ndrove their sick cattle to market, it must likewise be allowed that, to\r\nconform one's self rigidly to the given injunctions, was sometimes\r\nattended with serious embarrassments. How great, indeed, must have been\r\nthe perplexity of any grazier who, being the owner, for instance, of\r\nforty head of cattle, and having seen ten of them perish under his eyes,\r\nwithout knowing where to dispose of them, was threatened with the loss\r\nof the remaining thirty within a few days! How could he calmly and\r\npatiently resign himself to suffer so large a quantity of animal matter\r\nto accumulate and putrefy around him, when, suddenly ruined, and\r\ndestitute of every resource, the authorities held back instead of coming\r\nto his assistance.\r\n\r\nThe prime cause of all the transgressions committed in despite of the\r\nPrivy Council's orders, may therefore be referred in part to the want\r\nof compensation to be granted to the owners of infected cattle. It all\r\nmight be almost reduced to a question of money. For let us suppose for a\r\nmoment, that inspectors entrusted with adequate powers, had been\r\nauthorized, after a close examination, to point out the tainted cattle;\r\nto fix a moderate price on them by way of compensation; to have them\r\nslaughtered, carried away, and immediately buried, would not such a\r\ncourse have diminished the generation of contagious miasma in a\r\nconsiderable proportion?\r\n\r\nMoreover, some cattle-breeders and farmers exposed themselves to the\r\nimposition of fines and penalties without any evil designs; for when\r\nthey drove their beasts to market they were only in the stage of\r\nincubation, at the preliminary period, when it is really no easy task to\r\ndistinguish the distemper. The following fact will exemplify this.\r\n\r\nAt each market, in spite of continual warnings, the inspectors pick out\r\nand despatch to the slaughter-houses a certain number of sick cattle,\r\nnot only those affected with typhus, but with other disorders. One\r\ncannot help wondering, on seeing the poor, lean, sickly condition of\r\nsome of these creatures, how their owners could have been so mad as to\r\nexpose them for sale; but in their number there are a few which,\r\nalthough sick, appear in good health to the common observer.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight ago, during one of our visits to the great\r\nMetropolitan Market, Mr. Tegg, the veterinary inspector, whose\r\nintelligence and earnestness are quite equal to the very difficult\r\ncharge with which he is entrusted, ordered to be seized and removed to a\r\nsecluded fold near the slaughter-houses, a dozen diseased animals. When\r\nonce these cattle had been thus collected in a body, it was easy to\r\nsubmit them to a still closer examination. Most of these beasts, adult\r\ncows and oxen, were lean, panting, feverish, dispirited, and remained\r\nmotionless where they stood. But among them was a cow, with a brisk and\r\nlively look, a quick open eye, which watched us with anxiety, and fled\r\nat our approach every time we passed by her. The turn came for this cow\r\nto be examined. Mr. Tegg, strong and handy--as every good veterinary\r\ndoctor should be--seized hold of one of her horns, but he was quickly\r\nshaken off; other persons came up to assist him; the fiery animal was\r\nsuddenly seized by both horns, by the nostrils, and the tail; but so\r\nstrong and spirited was the animal, that she defended herself with\r\nadvantage against all her adversaries, and once more shook herself free.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, however, to master the creature, so they surrounded\r\nher again, pressing her back this time into a corner of the pen, to\r\noverpower her. But lo! the animal takes a sudden spring, and leaps over\r\nthe bars. Assuredly this cow, for a beast suspected of the typhus taint,\r\nhad given a proof, if not of health, at least of extraordinary vigour;\r\nand her owner, who had seen her condemned with much vexation, now\r\nthought he saw ample reason to reclaim her, and drive her back to the\r\nmarket for sale. However the cow, on taking such a leap, and under\r\nconditions so unfavourable, came down with all her weight upon her\r\nlimbs, fracturing one of her forelegs.\r\n\r\nAfter this accident, we were able to prosecute the examination we\r\ndesired, and Mr. Tegg showed us a row of little glandular swellings on\r\nthe ridge of the gums, and livid spots on the vaginal mucous membrane,\r\nwhich confirmed his diagnosis. The owner of this cow, nevertheless,\r\nstill discredited the diseased state of the beast; so to convince him,\r\nshe was driven off at once to the slaughter-house to be struck down;\r\nbut, unfortunately, three or four others filled the required area, so\r\nthat the poor cow was forced to witness the execution of her\r\nfellow-creatures before being killed herself. The look and posture of\r\nthis cow, her excited yet terrified glance as she surveyed this scene of\r\ncarnage, was one of those pictures which no pencil could draw; and\r\nalthough we acknowledge that man possesses an incontestable right to\r\napply to his own use the dead or live matter of animals for his food and\r\nsustenance, we could not help feeling for the poor victim, slipping over\r\nthe blood, and thus scenting death before receiving the stroke.\r\n\r\nWe are not excessively sensitive; we have seen a hundred horses bleeding\r\nfrom the incisions made by veterinary pupils, and scores of oxen\r\nslaughtered; we ourselves have practised numerous experiments on\r\nanimals; but the affecting sight of that animal witnessing the slaughter\r\nof others, and waiting her turn to die, touched us deeply. We could not\r\nhelp asking ourselves, how it was that man could dispense with\r\ncompassion and good feeling even in that bloody toil, and why he did not\r\nbandage the eyes of the doomed creatures he was going to sacrifice?\r\nThese dumb animals that we treat like inert matter are sensitive like\r\nourselves; they are very conscious of pain; and if it be our privilege\r\nto compute the number of our days, we ought not to forget that they are,\r\nlike us, endowed with intelligence, so that when they are thus detained\r\nat the place of execution, all their senses and faculties being\r\nconcentrated on their destroyer, they are fully conscious of the cruel\r\nfate which awaits them.\r\n\r\nAt last it was the poor beast's turn to be slaughtered, and ten minutes\r\nafterwards we opened her entrails, and had proof that Mr. Tegg's\r\njudgment was exact, for already the stomach and intestines offered to\r\nview indubitable signs of the typhus at its first period.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the cow was then convinced and brought to reason, but he\r\nstill very fairly asserted the goodness of his motives, about which none\r\npresent doubted at all, and applied for compensation to the full value\r\nof the beast, both as butcher's meat and offal, which application was\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nJudge, therefore, by this particular example, how many tainted cattle\r\nthere must have been which have propagated this distemper, some with and\r\nsome without the knowledge of their owners; and, \"_horresco referens!_\"\r\nhow much of this tainted meat must have been purchased and eaten by the\r\npublic, since this cow had all the appearance of health and vigour, and\r\nthe real diseased condition might not have been detected at all, but for\r\nthe experience and sagacity of Mr. Tegg, the inspector.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nIn this consideration of the causes of the contagious typhus in bovine\r\ncattle, we have deemed it essential to invite attention both to those\r\nwhich are generally recognised and admitted, and to those which, though\r\nthey may have been settled in the minds of observant and experienced\r\nmen, may yet appear hypothetical to certain readers.\r\n\r\nBesides which, in every scientific work, allowance must be made for the\r\npast and future; and here we have two vital distinctions. If the man\r\nwho undertakes this task does not go on, he falls back; and it was to\r\navoid incurring this reproach that we have passed our old boundaries and\r\nvisited new avenues. We are aware that more than one objection might be\r\nurged against the opinions and theories which we have exposed, in order\r\nto account for the outbreak of typhus in England; we might anticipate,\r\nwe might reply to these objections; but we would rather recapitulate our\r\ninquiry into the causes, in the tangible form of practical propositions.\r\n\r\nFrom the general considerations above given, we think we may conclude,\r\n\r\n1st. That the causes which generate the cattle typhus on our globe are\r\npermanent and unceasing, not only on the banks of the great rivers which\r\nempty themselves into the Black Sea, but also in other countries--in\r\nAmerica, in Africa, &c.; wherever, in a word, exist the conditions, not\r\nof race (the race of the animal in this case being but secondary), but\r\nof climate and of the organic elements which are indispensable to the\r\nformation and development of typhic miasma.\r\n\r\n2nd. That the cattle typhus, although it exists not necessarily, but\r\nthrough the improvidence or want of caution in man, on different parts\r\nof the earth, never appears at all in the temperate and more genial\r\nzones, save under particular and special circumstances, analogous in\r\nsome degree with those which generate the human typhus--inclemency of\r\nthe seasons, overcrowded dwellings, bad or insufficient food, and want\r\nof cleanliness; and that these particular and special circumstances give\r\nbirth to the epizootic genus, rendering the cattle fit and apt to\r\nreceive the germs of the contagious virus, and to foster its incubation.\r\n\r\n3rd. That the cattle typhus, thus accidentally developed in the\r\ntemperate and genial zones, by means of the vicious hygienic conditions\r\namidst which horned cattle are accustomed to live, and which serve as\r\nthe causes of its propagation, is afterwards transmitted by the contact\r\nof animals living in the same stall or shed, or collected in herds on\r\nthe same ground, or transported in the same vehicles, by land or sea.\r\n\r\n4th. That the droppings of animals, their litter, their dead bodies, and\r\ntheir detritus, or broken-up remains--also the stables, vehicles, and\r\nimplements which have served for their use, and all matters or\r\nsubstances which have touched them or approached them--are generative\r\nelements of the distemper.\r\n\r\n5th. That the typhic miasma, thus reproduced and multiplied in one place\r\nunder the influence of all these producing causes, is conveyed by the\r\nwinds to great distances, smiting those well guarded cattle which\r\nappeared to be fully protected from the possibility of infection by\r\ntheir isolation.\r\n\r\n6th. That the want of prompt and stringent measures first to\r\nconcentrate, and then to stifle this typhus in its focus; the love of\r\nlucre, the perfidy of some, and the absence of foresight and caution in\r\nothers, may be, and have been in the particular cases which we are\r\ndealing with, material causes and agencies of its diffusion.\r\n\r\nSuch we consider to be the causes which engender and propagate cattle\r\ntyphus, and which will serve as a basis for the preventive measures to\r\nbe employed in order to withstand and check its propagation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] We are aware that the transport of cattle is conducted in a\r\ndifferent manner during the prevalence of this epizootia. The account\r\ngiven by two German veterinary surgeons of the management of the vessels\r\nof the North German Lloyd's, and of the manner in which the animals are\r\ntreated, is a proof of this; but before the appearance of the epizootia,\r\nthe transport of animals by land and by sea left much to be desired.\r\nThis account will be found at the end of this work (NOTE A); and all\r\ndocuments in support of the facts which have served as the basis of our\r\ndissertation, are also in the Appendix, arranged alphabetically in the\r\nform of notes.\r\n\r\n[C] See Notes B, C, D, E.\r\n\r\n[D] See Note F.\r\n\r\n[E] On the 15th of September, the thermometer stood at 80° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n[F] See Notes G, J.\r\n\r\n[G] See Notes K, L.\r\n\r\n[H] See Note M.\r\n\r\n[I] See Note N.\r\n\r\n[J] See Notes O, P.\r\n\r\n[K] See Notes R, S, T.\r\n\r\n[L] See Note V.\r\n\r\n[M] See Note Y.\r\n\r\n[N] See Note Z.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Description of the Contagious Typhus of the Ox; its Symptoms, Course,\r\nProgress, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already written the history of the typhus which affects the ox; I\r\nhave shown and dwelt upon the signs and characters of typhus diseases\r\ngenerally, deducing therefrom the denomination and definition of that of\r\nthe ox in particular; finally, I have described the causes which\r\ngenerate and diffuse it abroad.\r\n\r\nNow, I must make known the various phases and alterations to which the\r\ndisease is liable, and which, in the language of the medical schools,\r\nare called its symptoms and characteristics; its progress or course; its\r\nprognosis; its _post-mortem_ appearances, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThis examination, like those which have preceded it, will afford new\r\nfoundations for medical practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n_Symptomatic Characteristics._--The typhus of the ox, like all\r\ninfectious and contagious diseases, offers to observation four\r\nsuccessive changes: 1st, a _period of Incubation_, during which the\r\noriginal structure is subject to internal and latent derangements; 2nd,\r\na _period of Initiation_, during which the first evident signs of the\r\ndisease are manifested; 3rd, a _period of Endurance_, during which the\r\nphenomena are fully developed; 4th, a _period of Decline_, or wasting\r\natony.\r\n\r\nThese divisions and classifications, it will readily be conceived, are\r\nrather fanciful, for nature does not adapt herself to our methodical\r\nforms. Still we shall abide by them, because they have their relative\r\nand practical utility, and because they will afford to the practitioner\r\nsuggestions more easily understood; and finally, because the organic\r\nchanges are different at these various periods, which in their entirety\r\nconstitute the typhus of the bovine species.\r\n\r\nThe description of those different phases through which the organism of\r\ncattle smitten with the contagion has to pass, has moreover been given\r\nin a masterly manner by the veterinary physicians of the different\r\nEuropean countries, especially by those in which opportunities to\r\nobserve it have been most frequent--that is to say, by the Russian,\r\nGerman, and French veterinary doctors, Jessen, Röll, D'Arboval, Gellé.\r\n\r\nThe English physicians of the 18th century, as we have already seen,\r\nwere also in no respect inferior to those of our own time. Finally, Mr.\r\nSimonds, who published a very able Report on his return from his\r\nscientific exploration in Galicia, in 1857, and the skilful Professor\r\nBouley, in his recent communications to the Académie de Médecine, in\r\nParis, respecting his examination of the present cattle typhus in\r\nEngland, have described the disease with minute exactness, as we\r\nourselves have verified on the various sick beasts which we have seen\r\nduring the last two months.\r\n\r\n1. _Period of Incubation._--Several careful experiments, which have been\r\ncited in the historical division of this work, and numerous fortuitous\r\noccasions, have authorized us to assign a duration of nine or twelve\r\ndays to the period of incubation, according to the general conditions\r\nof the epizootia, the manner in which the contagion is transmitted, and\r\nthe former state of health of the affected cattle.\r\n\r\nThus an epizootia at the outset, either when it has become general, or\r\nwhen it is at its decline, does not always transmit typhic miasma of the\r\nsame virulent intensity, nor does it always provoke in the frame a\r\nlabour of incubation which is invariable. The contagion transmitted from\r\nanimal to animal living continually in the same stalls or sheds is\r\nfollowed by an incubation more quick and active than that which results\r\nfrom a chance contact in the markets, or from a contagion produced at a\r\ndistance, by the transmission of the miasmatic effluvium along the\r\npublic highways.\r\n\r\nLet us add to these considerations the relative state of each animal's\r\nhealth, and we shall then perfectly understand that the incubation must\r\nvary both in its continuance and in the characteristics of its\r\nmanifestation. In some animals it scarcely betrays the derangements\r\nproduced by its morbid operation: they preserve their appetite and their\r\nusual looks. A close and attentive observation would alone be able to\r\ndistinguish some slight alterations in their way of living, in the\r\nregularity of their rumination and sleep. But in others, there is no\r\nmistaking a something irregular and unusual in their appearance and\r\nliving; the vital state is no longer the same. Thus an animal which used\r\nto be cheerful and familiar becomes silent and solitary; it browses the\r\ngrass with less eagerness and avidity; it lies down more frequently and\r\nlonger; it lingers by the side of the hedge along the field, or it\r\nwanders about, here and there, with a listless look, and without any\r\nobject. Others moan and complain, bellowing at intervals in an unusual\r\nmanner, very expressive of languor and pain.\r\n\r\nBut apart from seasons of epizootia, the beasts too often exhibit these\r\nimperceptible shades of variety in their looks and actions for the\r\nattention to be struck by them; these changes, therefore, are almost\r\nalways unnoticed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the typhic miasma absorbed at the same time by the respiratory\r\nand digestive mucous membranes serves to modify the qualities of the\r\nblood, and secretly reacts on the nervous system; soon after, the\r\nanimal exhibits more decidedly those changes which previously were\r\nhardly to be detected; his want of appetite is more marked, his sadness\r\nmore obvious, and his attention fixes itself more slowly and carelessly\r\non the objects which surround him. When he is in the shed, his usual\r\nfood is found in excess of his wants, his thirst is much keener and more\r\nfrequent, and a continual dejection and lowness of spirits or a\r\ntransitory agitation disturb all his functions. When the farmers or\r\ngraziers notice these premonitory signs for the first time they pay but\r\nlittle attention thereto; but if the contagion has found its way into\r\ntheir stalls and sheds they are no longer deceived by them, but begin to\r\napprehend that in a day or two fresh victims will be added to the\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n2. _Period of Initiation._--Soon the elaboration of the virulent miasma\r\nin the organic structure changes the quality of the blood and humours,\r\nthe functions of assimilation and secretion are modified, the nervous\r\ncentres receive vitiated organic elements and are disturbed in their\r\nphysiological conditions, and the smitten animal displays that state of\r\nlatent uneasiness which he is imperfectly conscious of by a general\r\nlook of heaviness and stupor (+Typhos+), which has suggested for this\r\ndisease its name of typhus.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the poor animal's eyes are fixed, the hearing becomes obtuse or\r\nindifferent, as may be seen in the sinking of the ears, those organs\r\nwhich are so sensitive, so contractile, and so vigilant in herbivorous\r\nanimals. With the head hanging down and motionless, the neck stretched\r\nout, their forelegs open and spread, their buttocks drawn together and\r\none of them completely lax, they seem to succumb beneath the weight of\r\ntheir bodies. In a word, the animal exhibits through its whole bearing a\r\nheavy sadness, a general dejection, which bespeak a great derangement in\r\nthe whole structure. From this time, in the animals which are most\r\nseriously affected, the appetite ceases, the rumination becomes\r\nirregular and partial, whilst in some others the appetite and rumination\r\nare maintained in different degrees.\r\n\r\nBut the incubation of the morbid elements pursues its course, the\r\nalteration of the blood becomes general, and the circulation is\r\nincreased and quickened. After this the fever interposes and stops the\r\nsecretions, that of the udders is dried up, the mucous channels cease to\r\nflow, the mucous membrane of the mouth becomes whitish, the little\r\nglands situated on it are more permanent, especially in the\r\ncircumference of the gums; the floor of the tongue and the larynx are\r\ninflamed, the mucous membrane of the cow's sexual organs is red and\r\nfurrowed with livid streaks, the white of the eye is parched, and the\r\nskin feels alternately hot and cold, as well as the horns and hoofs.\r\n\r\nSome of the sufferers have an external horripilation, transient\r\nshiverings are felt in the front and hind quarters and at the junction\r\nof the limbs with the trunk. Some pregnant cows near their delivery\r\nmiscarry. In a word, at this period of irritation, the whole frame is at\r\nwar with the typhic elements which besiege it, and which overcome the\r\npreservative power of the vital forces, and from this general\r\ndisturbance arises an incandescent fever, which drains and stops all the\r\nsecretions at their source.\r\n\r\nThese general symptoms are the first signs and warnings of functional\r\nderangements more significant, which may, however, vary according to the\r\npredispositions of each animal, and transfer their evolutions either to\r\nthe nervous centres or to the respiratory mucous membrane, or to that of\r\nthe digestive channels, in the inflammatory and febrile form of the\r\ncontagious typhus. Such at least is what we observe in the typhus of\r\n1865 in England.\r\n\r\nThe functional derangements, in truth, subordinate to and depending on\r\nthe predispositions exhibited by the cattle, are far from being the same\r\nin all. In some, the nervous derangements predominate; in others, it is\r\nthose of the respiratory, and in others, it is those of the digestive\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nAs in this period of irritation the nervous centres are more\r\nparticularly affected, the animal suffers cerebral and rickety pains, a\r\nconstant cephalalgia, which provokes vague anxiety; he is sometimes\r\ncheerful, sometimes wild and furious; he clenches his teeth and yawns,\r\nthe muscles of his face spasmodically contract, the spine feels very\r\nsensitive when pressed, a burning and insatiable thirst comes on, the\r\nbreathing is hurried, and the intestinal evacuations are suspended.\r\n\r\nIn this form the toxæmia appears to concentrate about the nervous\r\ncentres--as is observed elsewhere at the outset of certain violent\r\nfevers, in the typhus and typhoid fever of man, for instance--and some\r\nof their number may perish the victims of these nervous disorders, and\r\neven fall as if struck with electricity. They die apparently from the\r\nresult of the typhic poison; for at this second period, we do not trace\r\nin the nervous centres those injuries which might account for so sudden\r\na death.\r\n\r\nWhen the respiratory apparatus concentrates upon it the febrile\r\ncongestion, the breathing becomes painful, accelerated, embarrassed,\r\nsometimes convulsive, and a deep, oppressive cough is heard from time to\r\ntime. The animal, under the yoke of this oppressive uneasiness, turns\r\nhis head from right to left, scents, and seems to question his flanks,\r\nwhere the seat of the disorder is; and then, whether the pulmonary\r\naffection is congestive or inflammatory or emphysematous, he may die of\r\nthe consequences of obstruction to the pulmonary circulation and from\r\nthe alteration of the blood, under the influence of a slow asphyxia,\r\nbut only at the third or fourth period.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the typhus localizes more particularly its morbid\r\nphenomena on the digestive channels, we discern local alterations on the\r\nfloor of the tongue and the buccal mucous membrane, spots of livid red,\r\nleaving behind them ulcerations of greater or less extent and depth on\r\ndifferent parts of the intestinal canal. In this form, which follows\r\nmore regularly all the periods, constipation is obstinate at the outset,\r\nevacuation of the bowels takes place with difficulty, the fæces are hard\r\nand the urine scanty, the belly is inflated and sensitive.\r\n\r\nSometimes at this period of initiation, one of these three symptomatic\r\nforms--the nervous, the pulmonary, and the digestive--may predominate\r\nexclusively, so far as to mask the disease as a whole, and to constitute\r\nit a special malady. But in that case, it is only the exaggeration of\r\nthe functional derangements which in their total constitute the typhus:\r\nfor when the distemper pursues its course, these three principal centres\r\nof life are always affected in different degrees. Thus, not one of the\r\ncattle smitten with the typhus goes through all the phases of the\r\ndisease, without suffering at a given moment in its nervous,\r\nrespiratory, and digestive functions.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, the typhus of the ox presents an apparent analogy with\r\nthe typhoid fever in man, although it is different. Consequently, the\r\nname of _typhus fever_ given by some veterinary surgeons, is not\r\naltogether inapplicable to it.\r\n\r\n3. _Period of Duration._--At this stage of the disease, which may be\r\nsaid to extend from the fourth to the seventh day, the nervous\r\nderangements are confined to symptoms of uneasiness and sensibility\r\nalong the dorsal spine; for those cases which exhibited more violent\r\nderangement in the nervous functions have proved fatal. In this period\r\nof the disease the breathing is more embarrassed, particularly when the\r\npulmonary form of the disease prevails. The pulse, which is hard and\r\nfrequent, indicates from forty to sixty pulsations; the beatings of the\r\nheart are more violent and audible; the mucous membranes, dry at the\r\noutbreak, recover their secretions, but these latter are endowed with\r\nirritating properties. Thus the eyelids, swollen and tumefied at the\r\nedges beneath the lashes, drip with a corrosive liquid, which soon marks\r\nits furrow along the chanfrin; the bronchiæ, the trachea, the nostrils,\r\nthe salivary glands, exude a serosity which runs out of the nasal and\r\nbuccal orifices. The exanthematic eruption having discharged itself\r\nthrough the digestive channels, constipation is followed by diarrhoea,\r\nrumination is completely stopped, the beast declines all solid\r\nnutriment, and pants for drinks,--for those especially which have a\r\nslight taste of acidity in them.\r\n\r\nThe derangements at this period pursue a rapid course--the breathing\r\nbecomes more and more difficult, the skin is hot and dry, the hairs\r\nstiffen more and more, gases are developed in the cellular tissues\r\nbeneath the skin, along the dorsal vertebræ, at the abdominal folds of\r\nthe posterior limbs and under the abdomen, in the form of flat, uneven,\r\ncrepitant tumours, which crackle when pressed with the hand; the\r\ndiarrhoea becomes more liquefied and irritant, for then it is no\r\nlonger a flow of droppings covered with mucus which is expelled, but\r\nsecretions already putrid, sometimes reddish in colour, and attended\r\nwith foetid gases, which induce tenesmus in the rectum, and force up\r\nthe tail. The animal grows perceptibly lean, his dejection is extreme,\r\nand cows which are with calf miscarry.\r\n\r\nAt night, the animal seems to have an increase of fever, sometimes of a\r\nremittent type, after which he becomes drowsy and lies down to rest\r\nhimself or to sleep, if he can; but the difficulty of breathing, the\r\nabdominal pains, soon force him to rise again, which he cannot do\r\nwithout an effort.\r\n\r\n4. _Period of Decline and Sinking._--This stage is observed to extend\r\nfrom the eighth day to the twelfth or the fourteenth. The morbid\r\nfunctions pursue their course, for the disease has its regular phases\r\nand a successive variation of phenomena. The secretions, which a few\r\ndays before were fluid and irritating, have undergone a change; they\r\nhave become thick and purulent, they flow more slowly from the ocular\r\nmucous membranes, and also from the nasal and buccal, which are red and\r\ninflamed, and they already emit a foetid smell. The dull tarnished\r\neyes become hollowed, purulent mucus lodges within their orbits, the\r\nbronchiæ are stopped up, the breathing grows louder and more panting,\r\nthe animal instinctively stretches his neck to ease it; the wasting of\r\nthe flesh exposes the bones of the sacrum and coccyx, laying bare the\r\nvertebræ and the ribs; the emphysematous tumours are more extensive and\r\ncrackling; the skin, less heated, wrinkles up and splits about the bony\r\nprotuberances; the udders are crusty and excoriated; detached boils,\r\nhard and rounded at first, then soft and purulent, begin to show\r\nthemselves on the trunk and the upper parts of the limbs. The\r\ndiarrhoea, still frequent, becomes bloody and intolerably offensive.\r\n\r\nAt this final period the organic structure yields to the effects of a\r\ngeneral alteration of the liquids and solids. The vital force has lost\r\nthe power of reaction; a mass of blood, decomposed by the double\r\ninfluence of a virulent toxæmia and the obstructions of respiration,\r\nconveys to all the organs a principle of dissolution; the nervous system\r\nis in a manner paralysed, as is shown in the animal's insensibility.\r\n\r\nThe secretions stop up the various channels and cavities; they lodge\r\nwithin them; they undergo a putrid decomposition, and pass out with\r\ndifficulty in the form of a purulent and bloody flux, in the highest\r\ndegree infectious. Very soon the sick animal has ceased really to live;\r\nit struggles and labours with its agony; if the lungs are clogged with\r\ngas or fluid they rattle hurriedly and often; the animal cannot hold its\r\nhead up even when lying down, and when standing moves it to and fro as\r\nif affected with the natural shaking of old age, and as if seeking to\r\nward off some indescribable evil, the occurrence of which it was\r\nawaiting.\r\n\r\nThe animal's body is a prey given up beforehand to the laws of organic\r\ndecomposition: the internal mucous membrane of the cheeks and lips peels\r\noff in strips when rubbed; the sores on the skin have a livid and\r\ngangrenous look; the eggs which the flies deposit on the edge of the\r\neyelids and at the nasal orifices, or on the excoriations of the skin,\r\nquickly pass into the state of larvæ. The air they expire is cold and\r\ninfectious; the native caloric, extinguished in every focus\r\nsuccessively, disappears; the vaginal mucous membrane is tumefied, the\r\nanal opening gapes, and from it flows a bloody and decomposed liquid\r\nwhich the rectum can no longer expel. The mouth, half open and coated\r\nwith a thick glutinous foam, vainly tries to inhale long draughts of air\r\nwhich can no longer reach the lungs. Finally, if the animal is lying\r\ndown, he expires in slow agony, his head borne down by its own weight;\r\nor, if standing, he sinks and falls down, his death having anticipated\r\nthe fall.\r\n\r\nSuch are the symptoms--the subjective signs which enable us to detect\r\nthe contagious typhus of the ox. But all animals do not exhibit these\r\ndisorders of the vital functions with the same regularity and excess.\r\nSome of these we have seen, from first to last, sustain the internal\r\neffects of the morbid process--in some sort passively--without revealing\r\nany deep derangements in the nervous, respiratory, and digestive\r\nfunctions. The poisonous virus had smitten them; they suffered in their\r\ngeneral structure; they looked stupefied; they lost, at a given moment,\r\ntheir appetite and rumination; they had fever; their breathing had\r\nbecome short and frequent; they had diarrhoea; they gradually lost\r\nflesh, and the excreta passed through certain changes and\r\ntransformations. In a word, the animal had manifestly the bovine typhus;\r\nbut, thanks to a relative immunity, to a special organization, which\r\nrenders some of these beasts capable of resisting the contagion for a\r\nlong period, and sometimes altogether[O]--thanks to that variety which\r\nwe observe in different constitutions (for small-pox and typhus in man,\r\nand the true typhoid fever in animals, do not operate with the same\r\nviolence on all alike)--thanks to this privileged organization,--we have\r\nseen some oxen pass through every stage of the disease without\r\nexhibiting this terrible train of morbid phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn these cases--for even this mild form of the distemper at last\r\nproduces death--the injuries fix themselves more exclusively on the\r\ndigestive channels, and we witness, in dissection, ulcerations in some,\r\nin others mere spots of a livid red, more or less extensive.\r\n\r\nFinally, although the typhus be one of the gravest maladies which\r\ndestroy and decimate cattle, all sick animals are not mortally affected\r\nthereby. In the present epizootia, five per cent., as nearly as can be\r\nascertained, recover; and when that happens, signs of a favourable omen\r\nare observable during the course of the attack. In these favourable\r\ninstances, indeed, the symptoms, even though they exhibit a certain\r\ngravity, pursue a regular course; fever does not become remittent; the\r\nfæcal discharge is copious and easy, with less foetor; the animal\r\nloses flesh slowly and progressively; the tumours are cutaneous,\r\ninflammatory; their character is good, depurative, and rather purulent\r\nthan gaseous and crackling. The droppings do not show that high degree\r\nof pestilential decomposition described above; the animal in his drink\r\nwelcomes and digests a mixture of bran and flour; the secretions of\r\npurulent mucus and the fæcal discharges dry up and stop in the early\r\npart of the period of decline; the epidermis of the openings through\r\nwhich they passed out peels off in thin scales, and afterwards in scurfs\r\nor husks--in a word, the economy does not experience those acute\r\ndisturbances which strike one of the tripods of life--that is to say,\r\neither the nervous centres, the lungs, or the digestive organs.\r\n\r\nNow, in these curable cases, in which the cure is most generally due to\r\nnature's own efforts, but which a systematic treatment might render far\r\nmore frequent, the convalescence is long, and requires great attention\r\nand a well-regulated diet, in which the food is carefully measured and\r\ndivided. Here there must be a rigid superintendence. A laxity in the\r\nwatchfulness, or too much reliance on the reviving health, have produced\r\nsudden relapses, and been fatal to many sick cattle, which had been\r\nlooked upon as thoroughly cured. For it may well be conceived that\r\nconvalescent animals, after sustaining such violent derangements in\r\ntheir health, and having been brought down to the lowest degree of\r\nprostration and marasmus--to a reconstitution, we may call it, of the\r\nsolids and liquids--have a devouring hunger. If, therefore, the keeper\r\nwho looks after them unhappily forgets that the principal lesions or\r\nsores are seated in the stomach and intestines, and if he gives them too\r\nmuch solid nutriment, he impedes the cure, irritates the ulcerations not\r\nyet thoroughly covered over, and soon adds another victim to those which\r\nhad already died.\r\n\r\nThis convalescence lasts from fifteen to twenty days, and the animal\r\nonly recovers its health at last by slow degrees. Still the careful\r\nkeeper need not be afraid of a relapse when he is patient and watchful.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the contagious typhus of the ox. Type of the unreturnable\r\ninfectious diseases, its virulent miasms undergo within the structure a\r\nseries of transformations: they produce in the frame a general disorder\r\nfully capable of annihilating the predisposition or aptitude of the\r\nanimal to receive the taint. A disease essentially specific, it affects\r\nthe principal centres of life; it kills its victim both by its deadly\r\nvirus and by the local derangements to which it gives rise; for how is\r\nit possible to preserve life when the whole nervous system, that\r\npromoter and regulator of all the functions, is upset?--when the lungs\r\nwhich revivify the blood, when the digestive organs which are the very\r\nsources of alimentation, are smitten with stagnation?--when, in fine,\r\nnot only these vital centres have ceased to operate, but when each by\r\nitself is the cause of torturing pains and exhaustion?\r\n\r\nThe typhus, moreover, is observed in all animals of the bovine species,\r\nwhatever may be their race, their age, or their sex. The recovered\r\nanimals may live with impunity amidst diseased herds of cattle, thanks\r\nto its non-relapsive nature. Jessen has even witnessed cows which, after\r\ntheir own cure, communicated a sort of immunity to their offspring. For\r\nthe same reason it is that epizootias are less fatal in those countries\r\nwhere they often occur, the constitutions of those animals which are\r\nengendered amongst such habituated herds, preserving a prophylaxy\r\ninherent to the blood which has been transmitted to them.\r\n\r\nBesides, what a pregnant subject is this for the physician, and what\r\nmore meritorious task can he set himself than the treatment of such a\r\ndistemper, which reason assures him must eventually lead to the cure and\r\neradication of the same complaint in the human species?\r\n\r\nFrom a cause which as yet has been indistinguishable and imponderable,\r\nwhat important, what marvellous results loom in the future! The air\r\nseems to us pure and wholesome, yet it conceals a typhic miasma of the\r\nmost deadly kind; it carries this pernicious principle into the richest\r\nmeadows, where we see feeding flocks and herds which to us seem\r\nexuberant with health. Then this miasma is inhaled and absorbed, and it\r\nmeets in the frame the special and indispensable organic element which\r\nis needed for its multiplication; there it undergoes certain latent\r\ntransformations, and a fermentation, a germination, which we call\r\n_incubation_, in order to explain a process which we cannot understand.\r\nThen fever is kindled, all the functions are disturbed, and the sick\r\nanimal is struck down, leaving us wondering, ignorant, and powerless\r\nspectators in the presence of phenomena which, nevertheless, are the\r\neternal work of nature and have endured through all time.--But if in\r\nthe invisible typhic atom nature gives us death, it also gives us life\r\nin the zoosperma.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_Lesions found in the Bodies of Oxen after Death._\r\n\r\nThe description which we have given of the disorders produced in the\r\ndifferent functions by the operation of the typhus, may easily suggest\r\nwhat must be the lesions exhibited by the organs of the body.\r\n\r\nDeath, we have said already, may overtake the disease at any of its\r\nperiods, and thus show every aspect and every degree of the organic\r\nlesions. Such an animal being struck down at the period of initiation,\r\nwill not, of course, present the changes and varieties of the period of\r\ndecline, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nIn general, the state of the dead bodies is that of the most decided\r\nmarasmus; the remains are intensely repulsive, as well by the stench\r\nthey emit as by the sight they afford; and, in summer especially,\r\ndecomposition sets in with great rapidity. Consequently, the utmost care\r\nis required in conveying them from place to place; and this attention\r\nis the more essential, because in the transit, the cavities being\r\ndeprived of their contractile power, let flow the pestilential liquids\r\nwhich they contain, thereby infecting the carriages and public roads.\r\nThe urgent necessity there is to inhume at once these dead bodies, the\r\nmost active agents in diffusing the contagion, is equally the drift of\r\nthis observation.\r\n\r\nThe deceased animal, as a subject of anatomy, enables us to certify the\r\nseat of the emphysematous tumours, and to see that they are really due\r\nto the air which insinuates itself into the cellular tissue, and which,\r\nreceding from the pressure of the fingers between the cells, produced\r\nthe crackling sound we noticed above. This penetration of the air is,\r\nmoreover, a far more general effect than was supposed.\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained, likewise, from the examination of these subjects,\r\nthat the round, fluctuating, and smaller tumours, are indeed purulent\r\ngatherings, which occasionally find a passage into the layers and\r\ninterstices of the muscles.\r\n\r\nThe muscular flesh is usually flabby, bloodless, unsightly, of a very\r\nnauseous smell; and it would be difficult to imagine that the most\r\navaricious trickster would dare to offer even the most presentable parts\r\nof it for sale and consumption. But when the expedients and artifices\r\nknown to the butcher's trade are had resort to, when, regardless of the\r\npublic health, the unprincipled dealer selects the most fleshy parts,\r\nwhen he dresses and adorns them by colouring them over with the blood of\r\na healthy beast, the unwary eye of the purchaser may be deceived.\r\nObserve, that we are now speaking of cattle that have died in the last\r\nstage of this marasmus, so that we might suppose, even if the many\r\nsummonses before the magistrates, and the too moderate fines which have\r\nbeen imposed on the guilty parties, had not shed the broadest light upon\r\nthe fact, that _a large number of sick cattle which had been slaughtered\r\nat different stages of this frightful disease, have been dressed and\r\nadorned, exposed for sale, sold, and eaten by a very large portion of\r\nthe inhabitants of London and of the country likewise_.\r\n\r\n_Digestive Channels._--The mucous membrane of the buccal cavity is, for\r\nthe most part, of a livid whiteness; ecchymosed stains, and sometimes\r\nulcerations, differing in their form and number, are visible on the\r\nfloor of the tongue. Mr. Simonds has had an anatomical model\r\nconstructed, which presents a perfect type of these ulcerations, some of\r\nwhich are of a scarlet hue, with perpendicular edges. The _stomachs_\r\nexhibit a variety of ulcerations.\r\n\r\nThe _paunch_, or first stomach, always contains a large quantity of food\r\nintended for rumination; sometimes these aliments are dry, and lie\r\nsticking to its sides; at other times they are diluted with water which\r\nhad not yet been absorbed after drinking. The inner membrane of this\r\nfirst reservoir may show flat spots, with livid injections of different\r\nsizes.\r\n\r\nThe _honeycomb_, or second stomach, generally exhibits the same injuries\r\nas the paunch.\r\n\r\nThe _manyplies_, or third stomach, contains between its laminæ hard,\r\npulverulent, and dry alimentary substances, which are seen sticking to\r\nthe different leaves. On removing these substances, some ecchymosed\r\nspots are laid bare, the epithelium of which easily peels off;\r\nsometimes ulcerations, and even perforations, are visible.\r\n\r\nThe _reed_, or fourth stomach, whose sides are thicker, more fleshy, and\r\nmore vascular, exhibits within its folds various kinds of lesions or\r\nsores: they consist of large flat stains of a darkish red, more or less\r\nsoft, and sometimes ulcerations red on their deep surface, with clean\r\nedges.\r\n\r\nAs for the intestines, properly so called, the _duodenum_ shows the same\r\ninjuries, but most generally large ecchymosed spots.\r\n\r\nThe _small intestine_ appears on the outside, even when it preserves its\r\nplace in the abdomen, of a reddish colour, lined with vessels distended\r\nwith blood, the signs of a general congestion of its membranes. The\r\nexamination of the mucous membrane, after it has been cut open\r\nlengthways, shows, indeed, that this portion of the digestive tube is\r\nthe principal seat of the distemper; for, independently of this general\r\ninjection, you perceive ulcerations which have succeeded to detached\r\npustules or lengthy flat spots, the result of a cluster of several of\r\nPeyer's glands, brought together by the plastic influence of\r\ninflammation. These flat spots, or wafers, very similar to those we\r\nobserve in the typhoid fever of man, are inflamed and ulcerated in\r\ndifferent degrees.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the _large intestine_ exhibits lesions depending\r\non the period of the disease. About the third period, the injection is\r\nsometimes general, especially near the rectum; but in the fourth and\r\nlast period we often meet with ulcerations which are smaller in the\r\nupper part, larger and deeper about the lower or rectal part. The\r\nmembrane of the sexual parts of the cow is strongly injected, and of a\r\ndull red colour.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the different organs of the digestive apparatus may, in\r\nthis typhus, offer to view extensive alterations perfectly consistent\r\nwith the gravity of the symptoms or the functional derangements. In two\r\ncases in which disorders of the respiration had prevailed, and which had\r\nbeen sacrificed on the eighth or tenth day of the disease, we only\r\nobserved partial injections of a very limited character, either on the\r\ngastric membranes or on that of the intestine, and which might have\r\nbeen detected in the case of common intestinal inflammation. Therefore,\r\nin these two cases, the characteristic lesions of the typhus, if they\r\nmust be localized in the intestine, were, so to speak, absolutely\r\nwanting. It was, we will not say exactly the same, on four other\r\nanimals, three oxen and one cow; but if, in two of them, the fourth\r\nstomach was inflamed, if in the third the small intestine was congested,\r\nand if, lastly, in the cow the large intestine showed ulcerations, we\r\ncould not in these lesions distinguish those of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nThese facts struck us with great surprise, for we were far from\r\nsuspecting them. We hoped, on opening the intestine of these animals,\r\nwhich had certainly all died of the typhus, to meet assuredly in a\r\ndetermined spot some well-known lesion declared beforehand. To our great\r\nastonishment, such has not always been the case. So that our theories,\r\nconclusive as they seemed on the identity of the ox typhus and the\r\ntyphoid fever in man, and which more than anyone else we wished to see\r\nconfirmed, must submit to observation.\r\n\r\nIn fine, in this epizootia the intestinal lesions or sores present\r\ndifferent appearances. Developed to the utmost in some cases, so much so\r\nas to exhibit ulcerations at the root of the tongue as well as in the\r\nintestines, and to be in a manner the excess of the injuries which are\r\nseen in typhoid fever, they are in other cases scarcely perceptible, and\r\nsometimes entirely absent, when the animal is struck down in the third\r\nor fourth period, that is to say, when the exanthematic or pustular\r\nstate has had time to develope itself on the digestive channels. One of\r\nthese animals seized by Mr. Tegg at the Camden Town market, was in such\r\na state of exhaustion that he could not be driven to the\r\nslaughter-house, only two hundred yards distant; they were forced to\r\nfell him on the spot midway, in order to have him conveyed to the place\r\nof dissection. We only detected partial injections on the digestive tube\r\nof this beast. The pulmonary emphysema which had caused this animal's\r\ndeath was developed in the highest degree.--He was opened at the request\r\nof M. Bouley, of Alfort.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus of Respiration._--Here, again, the typhus shows us injuries\r\nwhich differ from those of typhoid fever; for if the breathing is always\r\nmore or less obstructed at the outbreak of this fever, no serious\r\norganic change in the lungs is the consequence thereof. In the ox\r\ntyphus, on the contrary, when the pulmonary form prevails, the\r\nderangements of the respiratory organs are remarkable. Thus, the mucous\r\nmembrane of the nostrils, from which flows a purulent and fetid mucus,\r\nis sometimes ulcerated and excoriated. The larynx and the trachea or\r\nwindpipe, choked up with frothy mucus, show the same alterations, though\r\nless frequently. The lungs, which are rather congested than inflamed,\r\nare emphysematous, the air having entered and distended the cellular\r\ntissue which unites the lobes together.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the lungs are so gorged with air that their lobes\r\nconstitute but a single heap, rendering them irrecognisable, so greatly\r\ndo their volume, their specific gravity, and their spongy aeriform\r\naspect differ from the natural state.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus of Circulation._--The inner sides of the heart show\r\necchymosed spots, and the same is the case with the larger vessels. The\r\nblood, diminished in its quantity and altered in its quality, is\r\nblackish and more fluid; but in most cases it coagulates instantaneously\r\nand in a mass, without separating into its solid and liquid parts.\r\n\r\n_Nervous System._--Having observed and dissected the dead bodies at the\r\nslaughter-houses of the markets, we were not able to examine either the\r\nbrain or the spinal marrow. Besides, let us remark in this place, that\r\nthe mode of felling cattle in England would have rendered impossible\r\nsuch an examination. For the animals are struck with a club, which kills\r\nthem both by cerebral concussion and by the direct alteration of the\r\nbrain; the instrument having a sharp end which perforates the skull and\r\ninjures the cerebral lobes. Nor is this all; the moment the animal is\r\nstruck down, a flexible rod is inserted into the hole made in the skull,\r\nand driven as far as the spinal canal, so as to tear to pieces the\r\nprotuberance and the bulb, that is to say, the vital knot. This manner\r\nof killing cattle seems to us, however, preferable to the one adopted\r\nin France, where the animal does not sink till he has been struck\r\nrepeatedly with the club.\r\n\r\nBut be that as it may, those authors who have examined the nervous\r\ncentres of horned cattle which had perished victims of the typhus, have\r\nusually found the meninges, or membranes that envelope the brain,\r\ninjected, whilst the brain itself was slightly dotted over with blood.\r\n\r\nThese anatomical lesions of the nervous centres being insufficient of\r\nthemselves to explain the death at the second period, we have\r\nendeavoured to give the explanation of it in treating of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe other organs, the spleen, the liver, the kidneys, present\r\nalterations of a secondary interest only.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n    _Diagnosis--Prognosis--Use of the Flesh of Animals which have\r\n      Died of the Typhus--Danger of direct Absorption._\r\n\r\nThe typhus of the ox has such distinct and strongly marked\r\ncharacteristics that it is not easily mistaken. However, to conform\r\nourselves to received custom, I will say some words about the principal\r\nsymptoms of some distempers affecting the ox, between which and typhus\r\nunprofessional persons might be embarrassed, and hesitate to distinguish\r\nthem. We will transfer, however, those particulars pertaining to the\r\ndiagnosis to the part written for the special use of agriculturists,\r\nfarmers, and graziers, in order that they may readily find whatever it\r\nmay be necessary for them to know when they chance to have any sick and\r\ntainted cattle to treat and cure.\r\n\r\nWe have likewise a few words to say on the subject of the prognosis of\r\nthe disease, as regards its propagation and its time of lasting.\r\nFinally, we will unfold a question of very real importance in\r\nhygiene--we mean the use and consumption of the flesh of animals as\r\nfood, and the danger which may accrue to man and other animals from\r\ncontact with their dead bodies, or fragments of the same.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of the ox, which we are accustomed to consider as\r\ndistinguished from typhus, are the contagious peripneumonia, the\r\napthous fever, and the \"charbonneux\" typhus; but, as we have just said,\r\nwe will mention by-and-by their chief characteristics.\r\n\r\nEveryone is anxious, and natural indeed is that anxiety, to know what\r\nthis epizootia will become--what will be its course; how long it will\r\nlast; whether it will extend its ravages over the whole extent of the\r\nthree kingdoms; and if, in fine, it will invade all Europe.\r\n\r\nTo answer in a precise manner these questions would be a difficult task;\r\nfor who amongst us can assign at present any definite course to the\r\natmospheric variations? and yet they have a genuine influence on the\r\nprogress of the epizootia. On the other hand, the measures which have\r\nbeen taken hitherto to confine the contagion to its different foci, have\r\nunhappily proved almost ineffectual, but it may be hoped that, assisted\r\nby experience, we shall be able to resist the evil more effectually, and\r\ncheck its propagation.\r\n\r\nIf the atmospheric conditions and the preventive measures could not\r\nmodify the spread of the distemper, we should have reason to dread a\r\nstill greater extension of the contagion; for the virulent character of\r\nthe epizootia appears to be of an exceptional intensity, and we may\r\nperhaps compare it with the famous epizootia, of the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, which for ten years afflicted all Europe with its\r\nravages, striking down six millions of horned cattle.\r\n\r\nLet the reader cast an eye over the extracts borrowed from the\r\nphysicians of the principal faculties who have described this typhus,\r\nand which we have reproduced in the first part of this book relating to\r\nits history, and he will then be convinced that the disease is\r\nabsolutely the same as that which then raged so fiercely. And if that is\r\nthe case, we must anticipate that it will extend its ravages whilst\r\nprolonging its duration. Already it has spread to Holland and Belgium;\r\nHungary and other provinces in the south-east of Germany--a fact much\r\nless surprising--are likewise smitten with it; and now we hear the news\r\nthat France, though so vigilantly on her guard, has seen her frontiers\r\npassed over. In spite of the _cordon sanitaire_ which she had prudently\r\nestablished everywhere, some horned cattle have been seized with the\r\ntyphus at the town of Raubaix, in the north.\r\n\r\nWithout setting ourselves up as pessimists, let us declare that we must\r\nexpect that the contagion will continue to spread. Let us make up our\r\nminds to this, in order to take the necessary sanitary measures, and set\r\nourselves seriously to work by trying the preventive treatment. But,\r\nalas! between the Government, the municipal corporations, the\r\nagricultural societies, the cattle proprietors, and, with regret we add,\r\nthe veterinary surgeons, there has been sadly wanting, up to the present\r\ntime, that mutual understanding; that prompt and decisive action, and\r\nthose pecuniary advances which are so necessary to encounter and contend\r\nwith this great calamity.\r\n\r\nAs for estimating with any approach to accuracy the sacrifice of\r\nproperty; the pecuniary loss, which this fatal epizootic may occasion\r\nthe country, the want of exact statistics as to the number of cattle\r\nwhich have already been struck down will not permit us to do it. But we\r\nmay, perhaps, already set it down approximately from 50,000 to 60,000\r\nhead of cattle for England and Scotland, until we have obtained more\r\nprecise statistical information on this significant point of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThat would represent, however, a very considerable capital; for if we\r\ncompute the loss of each animal at the average sum of 15_l._ only, the\r\nsacrifice already incurred would not be less than from 750,000_l._ to\r\n900,000_l._ This sacrifice in money might possibly have proved the be\r\nall and the end all; and at this point we might, perhaps, have arrested\r\nthe contagion, had we all been able to act advisedly and harmoniously\r\ntogether, in the name and for the interest of the public, from the first\r\nappearance of the disease. But this calculation of, let us say,\r\n900,000_l._, is made on the supposition that each cattle owner had been\r\nwilling to abide by his own loss; whereas, unfortunately, many of them\r\nhave striven to shift it on others, and large numbers of the sick and\r\ntainted beasts having been sold and consumed, a proportionate sum thus\r\nrecovered by those avaricious men must be of course _deducted_ from this\r\nestimate. Deducted, indeed! Considering the consequences on the public\r\nhealth, is it not rather an aggravation than a mitigation of the loss?\r\n\r\nThese last assertions naturally lead us to inquire whether we are not\r\njustified in saying that the flesh of sick and tainted cattle, thus\r\ncirculated and consumed, has not had its baleful effects on the public\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThe butchers who sold the flesh of these sick and tainted cattle have no\r\ndoubt been careful to abstain from using it in their own families; and\r\nthe first time they speculated on the health of their fellow-citizens,\r\nwell knowing what they did, their conscience probably reproached them\r\nwith the misdemeanour. But afterwards, when no bad consequences to their\r\ncustomers had been seen, their own impunity, joined to this apparent\r\nharmlessness to their neighbours, rendered them bolder, and it became a\r\ndaily habit with them to sell this peccant offal, which poisons even the\r\nearth by its contact.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the graziers themselves were in league with the butchers, and\r\ntook care to slaughter the affected animals before the wasting of their\r\nflesh by the progress of the distemper had bereft them of their greatest\r\nvalue. Their private interest prompting them thus to dispose of the\r\nsick animals as fast as they could, the majority of the tainted beasts\r\nwere sold and eaten in the second stage or period of the typhus.\r\n\r\nNow, if the flesh of these diseased animals had been eaten raw,\r\naccidents most terrible and appalling would certainly have been the\r\nconsequence, although dogs may have fed upon it without injury. But the\r\ncooking of animal flesh at 100 degrees of heat has the property of\r\ndestroying for a time the septic germs, as the famous debates now being\r\nheld by the experimentalists who are studying the subject of spontaneous\r\ngeneration tend to show. This poisonous meat, therefore, may at first\r\nhave been digested without producing immediate ill effects.\r\n\r\nOur medical practice, however, authorizes us to declare that, after\r\nmaking every allowance for the influences of this extraordinarily hot\r\nsummer, digestive and nervous complaints of the acutest description, and\r\nwithout any special cause to account for them, have been very numerous\r\nindeed during the last two months, and beyond all proportion greater\r\nthan they usually are in London. And we cannot but feel that, if the\r\ncholera should reach the shores of England at this critical conjuncture,\r\nit will find organisms most ready to receive its virus. Then, indeed, if\r\nthe typhic miasma come to mix and blend with the choleraic miasma, all\r\nliving beings will have to contend with the most deleterious causes of\r\nalterations in their health, and we may (God send it be otherwise!)\r\nwitness one of those measureless calamities which, known in former ages\r\nas the _Black Pestilence_, decimated cattle and men indiscriminately,\r\nand which, when we read the sorrowful accounts of it in history, make\r\nthe flesh creep with affright.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely hope that such misfortunes may be spared us. But ought we\r\nto abstain entirely and absolutely from consuming the flesh of cattle\r\nsmitten with typhus? It is a delicate question, but still we shall\r\nanswer it, making due allowance for every interest concerned.\r\n\r\nWe conceive that all animals which are smitten with the early effects of\r\nthe disorder, which begin to operate at the opening of its second\r\nperiod, that is to say, when the first symptoms are declared, such as\r\nstupor, loss of appetite and shiverings, may be handed over to the\r\nbutchers. But this must only be done on the _positive understanding and\r\ncondition_ that every animal, sick or not sick, in times of epizootia,\r\nshall pass, either in the farm, the market, or the stable, under the\r\nexamination of a competent veterinary inspector, who shall mark the\r\nbeast when fit to be sold for consumption. With this precaution, which\r\nat present is put in practice in Belgium, every interest is cared for\r\nand guarded--those of the public health as well as those of the cattle\r\nowners.\r\n\r\nBut there is another question of some importance which deserves to fix\r\nour attention for a moment. People sometimes inquire whether the\r\nox-typhus can be communicated to other animals, and even to man, either\r\nby contact, by direct absorption, or by inhaling the miasma floating in\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\nExperiments of great interest might be made on this subject; but we can\r\nalready assert, on the evidence of facts publicly known, that the direct\r\nabsorption of putrid matter and purulent secretions, and likewise the\r\nmere contact with tainted flesh, when the epidermis or scarf-skin is\r\ncracked or peeled off, or when the least open sore exists, may give\r\naccess to the disease, and produce death, both in man and other animals.\r\nIn these cases, the absorbed virus operates, not as a specific agent,\r\ngiving birth to typhus, but as a provocative septic agent, endowed with\r\ninfectious properties, which infuse into the economy a germ of virulent\r\nand mortal disease. So long as a sound and intact outer skin stands as a\r\nsafeguard between us and absorption, we may fearlessly touch and handle\r\nthe tainted flesh of these animals. But the slightest sore or abrasion\r\nis an open door to let in death. A young veterinary surgeon, who had a\r\nslight wound in one of his arms, was carried off within forty-eight\r\nhours, as was proved at a coroner's inquest, after he had dissected an\r\nox which had died of the typhus.[P]\r\n\r\nWe see by this fatal example that we must be particularly careful not to\r\ntouch an ox tainted with typhus when we carry about us any open sore,\r\nunless we take the utmost precaution in order to guard against all\r\ndirect contact or absorption. Man, as we have said and shown, breathes\r\nwith comparative impunity an atmosphere laden with the infectious miasma\r\nof this typhus. But that which to-day is true may not be true\r\nto-morrow; let us, therefore, be also on our guard against the too\r\ncontinuous absorption of an atmosphere impregnated with these\r\ndeleterious principles.\r\n\r\nAs for herbivorous animals in general, a similar organization must, in\r\ntheir cases, predispose them to receive the contagion. Whenever we visit\r\nthe markets, we cannot help fearing to see the ox typhus communicated to\r\nthe sheep and pigs which are stationed around them. It is an\r\nunquestionable fact that, in certain epizootias, all animals without\r\ndistinction have been smitten and struck down, and the herbivorous\r\nanimals more rapidly than any other. The habit of collecting such vast\r\nnumbers of cattle in the same market, and on the same day, though\r\nconvenient for business, appears to us injudicious, especially during\r\nthe prevalence of this scourge.\r\n\r\nThis part of our treatise was in the printer's hands when Mr. Simonds\r\nwrote a letter to the Privy Council which justifies all our\r\napprehensions. The typhus of the ox has been communicated to a number of\r\nsheep, and we must all expect to see this cruel disease assume much\r\nlarger proportions than heretofore, since it has now obtained a second\r\nfocus for its maintenance and dissemination.\r\n\r\n      \"Veterinary Department, 23, New-street, Spring-gardens,\r\n      Sept. 25th.\r\n\r\n      \"SIR,--I beg to report that, acting on the\r\n      instructions received from you to investigate without loss\r\n      of time the statement received at your office relative to an\r\n      outbreak of the cattle plague in a remote part of the county\r\n      of Norfolk, supposed to have arisen from cattle having been\r\n      in contact with some diseased sheep, recently brought to the\r\n      premises, I have visited the district in question, and\r\n      inquired into all the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n      \"It appears that as far back as the 17th of August Mr. C.\r\n      Temple, farmer and merchant, of Blakeney, received on his\r\n      farm 120 lambs which he had instructed a dealer to procure\r\n      for him for feeding purposes.\r\n\r\n      \"The lambs were bought at Thetford-fair on the preceding\r\n      day, and were immediately sent by rail to Fakenham, from\r\n      which place they were driven to Blakeney, a distance of\r\n      about ten miles. On their arrival they appeared to be\r\n      fatigued to a greater extent than ordinary, which was,\r\n      however, attributed to the heat of the weather and the\r\n      exertion the animals had undergone.\r\n\r\n      \"In addition to this, the shepherd observed that several of\r\n      them seemed unwell, and he remarked to his master that they\r\n      did not appear to be a 'very healthy lot,' and that he\r\n      thought it would be better to return them to the dealer.\r\n      Within a day or two of this time the symptoms of illness\r\n      were more marked in all the original cases, and many more of\r\n      the animals had been attacked. On the 24th two of the worst\r\n      cases were removed from the field to the farm premises, and\r\n      were placed in a shed for treatment, in which afterwards a\r\n      cow was put. On the 25th two of the lambs died, and in\r\n      consequence of this, and of the large number which were now\r\n      affected, the whole were brought, on the morning of the\r\n      27th, into the same yard where the shed previously alluded\r\n      to was situated. There is also another shed, separated from\r\n      this yard only by some old furze faggots, into which the\r\n      cows were driven night and morning for being milked. The\r\n      lambs remained in the yard till the morning of the 28th,\r\n      when having had some medicine administered to them, they\r\n      were returned to the fold and never came again near the\r\n      cows.\r\n\r\n      \"While in the yard three died, two on the 27th, and one on\r\n      the 28th, and on the following day two others died in the\r\n      field. From this time the disease went on, so that by\r\n      Friday last, the 22nd of September, the day of my visit,\r\n      forty-six had either died or been killed, and twenty-seven\r\n      were in a very precarious condition.\r\n\r\n      \"On the 7th of September, ten days after the last exposure\r\n      to the sheep, a cow gave evidence of being affected with the\r\n      cattle plague, this animal being the one which had been put\r\n      into the shed occupied by the diseased sheep on the 24th of\r\n      August. A second cow was attacked on the 11th of September,\r\n      and a third shortly afterwards, which was followed by\r\n      others; so that by the 16th all the cows, six in number, a\r\n      heifer, and a calf, were all dead.\r\n\r\n      \"My examination of the lambs showed that they were\r\n      unmistakably the subjects of the plague. The symptoms agreed\r\n      in almost every particular with those observed in cattle\r\n      affected with the malady, and the _post-mortem_ appearances\r\n      were also identical.\r\n\r\n      \"With a view to ascertain the true nature of the changes\r\n      produced in the system prior to death, I had four of the\r\n      lambs killed, and from these I took some diseased parts and\r\n      forwarded them to the Royal Veterinary College without note\r\n      or comment. These parts were examined by my colleague, Mr.\r\n      Varnell, who at once recognised the special changes of\r\n      structure which are caused by the cattle plague.\r\n\r\n      \"The whole facts of the case leave not the least doubt of\r\n      sheep being liable to the disease termed the cattle plague,\r\n      and that when affected they can easily communicate the\r\n      malady to the ox tribe; and moreover, that when so conveyed\r\n      it proves equally as destructive as when propagated from ox\r\n      to ox in the ordinary manner.\r\n\r\n      \"The case is also more important from having occurred in a\r\n      place no less than fourteen miles distant from any other\r\n      where the cattle plague exists, thus placing beyond a doubt\r\n      the fact of the malady being introduced among the cattle by\r\n      the sheep alone.\r\n\r\n      \"I regret to add that this is not a solitary case of sheep\r\n      being affected by the cattle plague. I learned that some\r\n      sheep were supposed to be similarly affected belonging to\r\n      Mr. R. J. H. Harvey, M.P., on his estate at Crown Point,\r\n      near Norwich. This place I also visited, and found a large\r\n      flock of upwards of 2000 lambs, among which the malady was\r\n      prevailing. A large number had been separated from the\r\n      diseased, and gave no evidence of the malady. Very many,\r\n      however, had died, and the disease was making rapid\r\n      progress. I also examined many of the dead, and found the\r\n      _post-mortem_ appearances to be identical with those seen in\r\n      the other cases spoken of in this report.\r\n\r\n      \"In this instance the malady was brought into the estate by\r\n      the purchase of some cattle, which afterwards died from the\r\n      disease, and which were unfortunately pastured with the\r\n      sheep at the time the disease manifested itself.\r\n\r\n      \"The whole matter is one of the greatest importance, and\r\n      which I lose no time in submitting to you for the\r\n      information of the Lords of the Council.\r\n\r\n      \"I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n      \"JAS. B. SIMONDS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n      _General Considerations on the Ox-Typhus, and the\r\n      Recapitulation of the Symptoms._\r\n\r\nWe have seen the causes, the symptoms, and the cadaveric alterations of\r\nthe Bovine typhus, and we may therefore apply ourselves at present to\r\nthe consideration of its pathogenia and its nature. Only, the limits of\r\nthis book will not admit of a complete discussion of every point of this\r\nimportant question of pathology; for if we desired to show in what\r\nrespect the typhus differs from, and in what respect it resembles, such\r\nand such a morbid entity, febrile, infectious and contagious like it,\r\nsuch a dissertation would require a whole volume for itself; we are\r\ntherefore obliged to keep within certain limits.\r\n\r\nLike every watchful physician who has applied himself to the study of\r\ncomparative pathology, we entertained our own preconceived opinions as\r\nto the nature of this _Cattle Plague_. Arguing _à priori_ from what we\r\nknew, from the laws of the pathogenia of those exanthematic diseases\r\nwhich we have alluded to in a former chapter; from the identity of\r\nvariola in various animals; from the preventive treatment to which this\r\nidentity has led; believing that animals and man have each their typhoid\r\nfever, as they have their variola or small-pox; considering with the\r\nEcole de Tours, typhoid fever as a variola of the intestinal mucous\r\nmembrane, and having proposed, in 1855,[Q] to adopt inoculation as a\r\npreventive treatment, drawing an easy comparison between the typhus we\r\nare now observing and the typhoid fever in man; hoping, we may say,\r\nindeed, to find in this typhus the inoculative and preventive virus\r\nwhich is required for our typhoid fever, all will understand with what\r\neager and vivid curiosity we have examined the entrails of the victims\r\nstruck down by this epizootia. For, if this typhus had been a genuine\r\ntyphoid fever, the bovine species which has already provided the\r\npreventive virus for small-pox, would equally have afforded us the\r\npreventive virus for typhoid fever. In this hypothesis, our proposal to\r\ninoculate the typhoid fever, which up to this time has been tried on\r\nhorses only, and in experiments badly conducted, by pupils of the\r\nVeterinary School of Lyons, was perhaps on the eve of being realised.\r\nBut we regret to say, we have been forced to submit to evidence, and to\r\nacknowledge that the present infectious typhus is not the one we require\r\nto provide us with the anti-typhoid virus.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as pathologists disagree as to the question, whether\r\nthe typhus and typhoid fever in man are one and the same disease, so\r\nshould we long debate, without coming to an agreement, as to that which\r\nrelates to the typhus and typhoid fever of the ox. We cannot pretend to\r\nproduce a reconciliation between these dissentient schools; all we\r\ndesire, is to sum up what observation has suggested to us, on account of\r\nthe practical and therapeutic interest belonging to the subject.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, the typhus and the typhoid fever of the ox are two\r\ndiseases of the same order, but nevertheless distinct; and the reasons\r\nupon which we ground our opinion are suggested to us by the nature of\r\nthe intestinal lesions, the symptoms, and causes of these distempers.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, the contagious typhus of the ox, at least that\r\nof the present epizootia, is an infectious disease, which varies in the\r\nintensity of the functional disorders and the cadaveric lesions to which\r\nit gives rise. The typhoid fever, we mean the real one,--for there are\r\nother intestinal exanthematic fevers which simulate it,--always localize\r\non the small intestines a pustulous exanthem, and in the typhus of the\r\nox, this pustulous exanthem and the ulcerations by which it is\r\nsucceeded, are frequently wanting.\r\n\r\nThe real typhoid fever springs up in every country under the influence\r\nof local causes, and is not in the same degree infectious and contagious\r\nas the typhus proper. In fine, the typhoid fever smites many species of\r\nanimals--the horse, the pig, etc., without transmitting its contagion\r\nwith the same intensity.\r\n\r\nThe contagious typhus of the ox appears to be more especially proper to\r\nthat animal; for in those latitudes where it developes itself other\r\nanimals are not affected by it.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, then, to which we could easily add many others, we\r\nconsider the typhus of the present epizootia a special and distinct type\r\nof typhic diseases, and differing from the typhoid fever: it is the\r\nhighest expression of its class, and occupies the first degree in the\r\nscale of infectious typhic diseases. Next to it we should place the\r\ntyphoid fever, which we admit is not often found in the ox. But\r\nveterinary pathology is still less understood than human pathology, and\r\ntyphoid fever may perhaps be recognised in those diseases which the\r\nformer science has described under the names of _adynamic_ and _ataxic\r\nfevers_. Besides, a persistent research among the veterinary memorials\r\nand reports might possibly enable us to discover some instances in which\r\nthe real typhoid fever in the ox had been traced, apart from the\r\nepizootic conditions. Here is an instance of it:--\r\n\r\nGellé, in vol. i. page 245 of the _Pathologie Bovine_, quotes the\r\nfollowing abstract which had been forwarded to him by one of his\r\nbrethren, on the dissection of an ox, which was made on the 10th of May,\r\n1824:--\r\n\r\n\"_Duodenum._--Uniform redness of the mucous membrane, with thickening,\r\nsoftening, and petechial spots. In the middle portion were discovered\r\nsome of Peyer's glands, small round pustules, whitish at the top, with\r\na reddish circumference. In some parts contiguous to these pustules lay\r\nulcerations somewhat extensive, which seemed to be the result of the\r\nsoftening of the pustules which had preceded them. A dark pus issued\r\nfrom these ulcerations. The inflammation by which they were attended was\r\ndiffused in some places, whilst in others it was circumscribed. In some\r\nparts the intestinal mucous membrane was utterly destroyed. The\r\nmesenteric glands were red and soft.\"\r\n\r\nGellé adds:--\"I have recorded this interesting narrative, as it may\r\nperhaps serve hereafter to throw light on a point of doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nThe intention which Gellé nurtured at the time, is, we see, now\r\nfulfilled conformably with his object.\r\n\r\nThe contagious typhus of the ox not being a real typhoid fever, we shall\r\nnot, consequently, be able to borrow from it the preventive virus for\r\nthat disease in man. But if these diseases differ, and if it is\r\ndifficult, in the present state of science, to assign to them such\r\ndistinct characters as to produce a perfect agreement among all medical\r\nwriters, we must, however, admit, that to designate the ox-typhus now\r\nbefore us by the generic name of PLAGUE, after the Germans, who\r\nhave given it the name of RINDERPEST, would carry us too far\r\nback.\r\n\r\nLet us acknowledge also, that the denomination of _contagious typhus_,\r\nadopted by the French veterinary doctors, is not, any more than the\r\ndesignation of TYPHUS FEVER, applied to it by English physicians,\r\ntotally free from objection.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the various species of typhus whose characteristics we have\r\nalready given (see p. 73), are all of them febrile and contagious.\r\nWhoever uses the word _typhus_, speaks of a contagious and febrile\r\nmalady, inasmuch as we cannot conceive typhus without its\r\naccompaniments, fever and contagion. But as the prevailing\r\ncharacteristic of this infectious disease is, above all, its\r\n_contagion_, we have preferred to adopt the name of _contagious typhus_,\r\nwithout, however, deceiving ourselves as to the value of the\r\ndenomination. The final elucidation has not yet been found for these\r\ndiseases; at some future day they will be methodically divided and\r\narranged, and each of them will then receive a special title, which will\r\nremove from the mind that vague uncertainty which at present we regret.\r\n\r\nBut if some faults of doctrine are open to debate, no doubt whatever can\r\nexist in the mind as to the morbid individuality of ox-typhus, or the\r\ngeneral conditions of its pathogenia; and we are able to deduce from the\r\npreceding explanation, the following conclusions as so many propositions\r\ndefinitively settled:--\r\n\r\n1st. The typhus of the ox is a disease essentially infectious, which is\r\nproduced by the absorption of the morbigenous miasma in the air.\r\n\r\n2nd. This typhic miasma is absorbed and engendered by the ox, under the\r\ninfluence of a number of special deleterious causes.\r\n\r\n3rd. When the miasma has been absorbed and incubation produced, the\r\ndisease itself is but a supreme effort of nature--a struggle between the\r\nvital forces and the morbid evolution of the poison, in order to guard\r\nand defend life against the danger which threatens it.\r\n\r\n4th. A malady essentially general, _totius substantiæ_, it directs its\r\naction, in different degrees, over the whole structure, but chiefly on\r\nthe nervous centres, on the organs of respiration, and on the digestive\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n5th. Its progress is regular; to the latest period of incubation it\r\nsucceeds that of the general poisoning of the blood--that of the pyrexia\r\nof general fever--which for a time stops up all the secretions. Then,\r\nthe morbid flux is localized according to particular predispositions:\r\neither on the nervous centres, when the animal is struck down at the\r\noutbreak; or on the lungs, when the respiratory derangements become the\r\nleading symptoms; or on the digestive channels, when the train of\r\ntyphoid phenomena is observable.\r\n\r\n6th. The period of acute inflammation, which had dried up the sources of\r\nsecretion, gives place to that of the depurative and critical\r\nexhalations or secretions; from every mucous membrane, from every\r\noutlet, there issues a mucous discharge, which at first is thin and\r\nclear, but afterwards becomes thick and purulent, and endowed with the\r\nmost infectious properties. The intestinal mucous membrane, smitten with\r\na particular lesion, becomes the seat of a flux extremely copious and\r\nintolerably fetid. Gases, and occasionally purulent deposits, are\r\ndeveloped in the cellular tissue beneath the skin.\r\n\r\n7th. The organism or physical frame, disturbed in the very centres of\r\nlife, undergoes a general transformation, a kind of organic\r\ndecomposition beforehand, and all the symptoms of reaction are followed\r\nby a period of wasting atony and adynamia, which usher in dissolution or\r\nlife's extinction.\r\n\r\n8th. Finally, throughout the whole course of the distemper, one special\r\nfunctional derangement--_stupor_--has been witnessed as the predominant\r\nsymptom, the nervous system being in a manner annihilated in its\r\nfunctions in consequence of the general infection.\r\n\r\nSuch are, in a brief outline, the principal symptoms of this typhus,\r\nwhich, when once engrafted on the economy, pursues its fatal march, and\r\nno treatment can then arrest its evolution. As in small-pox, so in\r\ntyphoid fever and in most general disorders, Nature for a time must be\r\nallowed to exercise her new functions, which succeed each other in due\r\ncourse, and which the physician must not stop; for if he did, he would\r\naccelerate death; but he must watch with a vigilant eye, in order to\r\nassist the vital powers.\r\n\r\nThe medical man, satisfied with these facts, will therefore abandon the\r\nchimerical hope of finding a specific remedy for such a disease. The\r\nvirus once absorbed, the frame will endure, and fatally endure, all the\r\nmorbid phenomena which must produce and succeed each other. _Against\r\nsuch a poison no other antidote exists than the poison itself._ And this\r\nwill be easily understood. What necessity have we for a specific remedy\r\nto resist a distemper, which carries within itself its preventive\r\ntreatment? If it germinates and is propagated, let us not accuse Nature\r\nand render her responsible; our own blindness, the lack of a community\r\nof interests among the people, our social institutions, the still\r\nimperfect state of the exact sciences, &c., amply explain how it is\r\nthat we have not yet employed the effectual means we possess, not of\r\ncuring it, but preventing it. If we could have our choice between\r\nprevention and cure, should we not naturally take the former?\r\n\r\nIndeed, the sources, the causes which generate the typhic miasma, are\r\nthoroughly well known to us, and these we can avoid. The developed\r\nmiasms hang suspended in the air; we may, perhaps, one day destroy them,\r\nif not in the outer atmosphere, at least in the stalls and sheds where\r\nthe animals inhale and absorb them. In fine, if we are powerless to\r\narrest the fell disease when its periods revolve, we may hope at some\r\nfuture time to act with greater efficiency upon it during its period of\r\nincubation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if this formidable disease cannot be stopped in its\r\nprogress, does it follow that we should not treat it at all? Certainly\r\nnot! Far be such a heresy from our thoughts. What would be the\r\nconsequence, if we left to their fate the sufferers from the small-pox,\r\nfrom typhoid fever, and from typhus itself, instead of watching over\r\nthem with the utmost solicitude? If the physician, the enlightened\r\ninterpreter of morbid phenomena, did not direct them with a bold and\r\nfearless hand, but abandoned Nature to her helpless course, why,\r\nnecessarily, every patient would die, whereas a large number are now\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nThat which is true in the case of man, is likewise true in the case of\r\nanimals: we are bound to treat them when they are ill. If to-day we\r\nthink it more expeditious and more profitable to exterminate them, we\r\ncertainly neglect our duty. We are the sovereign masters of animals;\r\nthey are the companions of our toils and pleasures, their lives must be\r\ngiven to preserve our own; but on their well-being and their happiness\r\nour own well-being and happiness also depend. They will return to us the\r\nsufferings and diseases of which they die a hundred times over. Like\r\nourselves, they die of consumptive, tubercular, cancerous, eruptive,\r\ntyphoid, and parasitical diseases. And who can tell whether they have\r\nnot communicated these disorders to man, who was, perhaps, originally\r\nexempt from them; and whether they do not continually communicate them\r\nto him?\r\n\r\nWhat noble pages might be written on the close connexion which exists\r\nbetween all organized beings, both physically and morally! Let us love\r\nthese animals, let us treat them with kindness, and all our other\r\nqualities will be raised by so doing.\r\n\r\nBut as a man must belong to the time he lives in, we will take up for a\r\nmoment with the doctrines of the economists; we will tolerate the\r\nextermination of diseased animals, as a painful necessity. Our duty is\r\nto seek in the study of the diseases of animals _and in their cure_, the\r\ncure of the disorders which afflict the human species. We shall,\r\ntherefore, now proceed to consider the subject of the treatment of\r\nhorned cattle, both as relates to preventive and curative medication.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[O] Mr. Simonds has for three months had under his observation a cow\r\nwhich has lived with impunity among animals sick and dying of the\r\ntyphus. And a young calf did not contract the disease for more than\r\nthree weeks.\r\n\r\n[P] Another instance of the fatal effects of the terrible disease now\r\nravaging our flocks and herds of cattle, and resulting in the death of a\r\nveterinary surgeon, has just occurred in the town of Sudbury, Suffolk.\r\n\r\nLast week the epidemic made its appearance in the stock-yard of Mr.\r\nRuffell, farmer, Melford, and the cases were attended by Mr. Robert John\r\nPlumbly, veterinary surgeon, Sudbury. On Thursday a cow, which was\r\nevidently suffering from the disease, was brought out and shot by Mr.\r\nPlumbly, who afterwards made a partial _post-mortem_ examination of the\r\ncarcase. In doing so with a small scalpel his shirt-sleeves became\r\nsaturated with blood, &c. from the animal. He returned home, and the\r\nsame day was attacked with sickness and acute pains in the head and\r\nchest, accompanied with a soreness in the bones generally. On the\r\nfollowing day he appeared somewhat better, and was able to attend to his\r\nduties, but became worse towards evening, and was confined to his house\r\non the following day. He considered that he was merely suffering from\r\nthe effects of a severe cold, and did not call in medical assistance\r\ntill Saturday night. He slept well that night, and seemed somewhat\r\nbetter on Sunday morning. About two o'clock in the afternoon he got out\r\nof his bed to have it made, when he appeared comparatively strong and in\r\ngood spirits; but almost immediately afterwards he was taken in what\r\nseemed to be a fit, and expired in a few minutes, before the surgeon,\r\nwho only lived next door, could come to his assistance. It was thought\r\nthat death had resulted from apoplexy, and a medical certificate to that\r\neffect was given. Rumours, however, soon becoming current that Mr.\r\nPlumbly's death was caused by the cattle plague, the borough coroner (R.\r\nRansom, Esq.) directed a _post-mortem_ examination to be made. But, by\r\nthis time, so rapid was the spread of the virus through the system that\r\nthe body appeared perfectly plague-stricken, and by Tuesday morning,\r\nwhen the surgeons arrived to examine it, and it was taken out of the\r\ncoffin, the corpse scarcely retained the semblance of a human being, the\r\nhead and trunk being much swollen and black in colour, the features\r\nquite undistinguishable, and all the flesh converted into a putrid\r\njelly-like mass. The tissues were completely disintegrated, so that it\r\nwas utterly impossible to make any examination.\r\n\r\nAn inquest was held on Tuesday afternoon, at the court room, Town Hall,\r\nbefore the coroner, R. Ransom, Esq., and a jury; Mr. Joseph Barker,\r\nchemist, being chosen foreman. The mayor (S. Higgs, Esq.) and other\r\ngentlemen were present during the whole of the inquiry, which lasted\r\nfour hours.\r\n\r\nThe jury went and viewed the body, which lay in an outhouse, but were so\r\novercome with the fearful spectacle that they were permitted by the\r\ncoroner to retire to partake of stimulants before they could further\r\nproceed with the inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe first witness called was Mr. William Brown, veterinary surgeon, and\r\npartner with the deceased, who deposed to having gone with him to Mr.\r\nRuffell's farm at Long Melford, on Thursday last, to examine several\r\ncows down with the cattle plague. One was brought out and shot by the\r\ndeceased, who proceeded to examine the intestines and viscera, which did\r\nnot present the appearances usually observable in advanced stages of the\r\ndisease, there being but slight ulceration of the coats of the stomach\r\nand bowels. The lungs were not examined, as the deceased had only a\r\nsmall scalpel with him. In making incisions in the body the\r\nshirt-sleeves of the deceased became covered with blood, but he did not\r\nprick or cut himself.\r\n\r\nHenrietta Dansie, nurse, was examined, and said that deceased had been\r\nsuffering from boils on his right arm, one of which she had poulticed on\r\nWednesday, the day before he had examined the diseased animal. He\r\nremoved the poultice himself, but declined to put on a plaster as the\r\nplace was a small one, although not healed. He changed his linen on his\r\nreturn from Melford; but the same afternoon he was taken with sickness\r\nand vomiting, and complained of acute pains in his head and bones. On\r\nSunday afternoon, shortly before he died, he wished to have his bed\r\nmade, and got out and stood whilst it was being done. He then complained\r\nof faintness, and got into bed again, and witness to revive him washed\r\nhis face and hands; in doing so she observed that the nails of one of\r\nthe hands which had lain in the bed were turning black. She was about to\r\ngive him some pills when she noticed a sudden change come over him; and\r\nthinking he was going to faint or have a fit, she rang for assistance\r\nand went herself for the doctor, who, being from home, another surgeon\r\nresiding next door was called in, but by this time the unfortunate\r\ngentleman was quite dead.\r\n\r\nMr. Maurice Mason, surgeon, said he was called in to see the deceased\r\nthe night before he died, and visited him again on Sunday morning, and\r\nordered him a lotion and leeches for his head and effervescing drinks\r\n(the leeches were not applied). From the appearance of the body and the\r\nevidence which had been adduced, witness was of opinion that the death\r\nof the deceased was caused by the absorption of poisonous virus from the\r\ndead beast.\r\n\r\nMr. W. B. Smith, surgeon, gave similar evidence, and added that the\r\ntissues of the body were so disintegrated that it would have been\r\nutterly impossible to have made a _post-mortem_ examination.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour's consultation the jury returned a verdict, \"that\r\ndeceased died from the effects of the absorption of virus or poison into\r\nhis system upon the occasion of his making a _post-mortem_ examination\r\nof a cow which had died from a certain disease called the cattle\r\nplague.\"\r\n\r\nThe sad occurrence has caused much sensation in the town, the deceased,\r\nwho was only 23 years of age, being well known and much respected.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Q] \"Appel à des Expériences dans le but d'établir le Traitement\r\nPréservatif de la Fièvre Typhoide et des Maladies infectieuses\r\ninrécidivables, par l'inoculation de leurs produits morbides.\" Memoire\r\nlu à l'Institut, le 8 Octobre, 1855. Inséré dans la Gazette Hebdomadaire\r\nde Médecine. Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_Treatment and Cure of the Ox-Typhus._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn now addressing ourselves to the treatment, and, as far as human\r\nagency can effect it, to the cure, of this insidious distemper, we\r\ncannot conceal from ourselves, that this is the most difficult, the most\r\ndelicate, and, at the same time, the most important division of our\r\nwork; for it is to this part, above all, that attention will be\r\ndirected. This portion of our task, therefore, will prove especially\r\narduous; and nothing can give a better notion of the difficulties we\r\nshall have to encounter than the many fruitless attempts which, for\r\nseveral months past, have been made to overcome them by many ardent\r\ninquirers, stimulated by the best possible intentions.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the moment--if we may be allowed the metaphor--to take\r\nthe bull by the horns; and we do so without hesitation. If, like so many\r\nothers, we are baffled and overcome in this unequal struggle--if our\r\nstrength is not on a level with our desires--we trust we shall be\r\npardoned.\r\n\r\nSeveral paths leading to the same end may be followed in this exposition\r\nof the treatment of ox-typhus. After mature reflection, we shall adopt\r\nthe one, which will allow us to take the disease at its birth, _ab ovo_;\r\nto study it in all its phases, in its first and second causes, and then\r\nin the successive periods of its development.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, we shall be able to give an account of each fact of real\r\nimportance mentioned in the foregoing pages, and to comprise within the\r\ntreatment whatever is connected either directly or indirectly with the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThus we will relate in so many separate articles,--\r\n\r\n1st. The means and measures to be employed to meet and resist the first\r\nlocal causes which may generate the typhus, then the secondary causes\r\nwhich serve to propagate it.\r\n\r\n2nd. The means of preventing the spread of the disease to animals still\r\nin good health.\r\n\r\n3rd. The means of treating it at its different periods, from the period\r\nof incubation to that of its decline.\r\n\r\n4th. Finally, we shall insert the laws and sanitary regulations which\r\nhave been published in England relative to this disease.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen, by adopting this method, the whole matter will be\r\nconsidered consecutively and in regular order; and the reader will\r\nunderstand that when such a phase of the malady is developed it is\r\nbecause the preceding one, which is the cause of it, has not been\r\neffectually contended with.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n    _Means and Measures to be employed to resist the Causes of\r\n      the Contagious Typhus of the Bovine Species._\r\n\r\nWe have shown fully and explicitly in what countries of the globe, and\r\nin what particular conditions, the typhus is generated among oxen. We\r\nknow that this dire disease has its focus on the banks of great rivers\r\nor lakes, which are periodically overflowed, and on which is deposited a\r\nslime teeming with organic matter; in marshy plains, where the same\r\nnatural impurities are fostered; and that these first hotbeds of the\r\nevil are found in China, in India, in America, in Africa, as well as on\r\nthe shores of the Black Sea. A spirit of observation which delights in\r\nmeasuring the phenomena of nature with the contracted compass of its own\r\nshort views and conceptions, could alone have imagined that the\r\nox-typhus was only to be found originally in the steppes of Hungary and\r\nRussia, and that the bovine species of those countries, thanks to a\r\nspecial organization, was alone capable of generating the typhus.\r\n\r\nSince we know, then, in what conditions this disease is developed, and\r\nespecially in what manner it is propagated in Europe, it is not\r\nimpossible now, when nations are united by the means of quick and easy\r\ncommunication, by commercial treaties, and by the mutual relations of\r\nscience, to examine what measures might be taken to modify and control\r\nthese conditions. A commission formed for this purpose, a scientific\r\ncongress, would be able to make on the spot a study of all the\r\ncircumstances which favour the development of typhus, and the result of\r\ntheir reports would enlighten the peoples as to the causes which produce\r\nit and from which they are first to suffer. They would be recommended to\r\nchoose as pastures the healthiest places, to withdraw their cattle at\r\ncertain seasons from those plots of ground which are baleful to them;\r\nnew systems of agriculture would be planned and tried, &c. These\r\nquestions being carefully examined, might lead to important results; nor\r\ncan we understand how, in the age in which we live, the same\r\nindifference and apathy as prevailed in the past should be maintained in\r\npresence of the positive and permanent causes of this infectious\r\ndisease, whose contagion, as we now see by many proofs, may extend at\r\nonce to so large a portion of Europe. There is now something to be done\r\nin this matter; it is the duty of the governments to deal with it\r\neffectually, and to take serious measures to destroy the evil radically,\r\nif radically it can be destroyed, and, if not, to alleviate its\r\npernicious effects as much as possible.\r\n\r\nMoreover, many breeders of cattle have not waited until now to guard\r\nagainst some of the first causes of the typhus: already they give the\r\nanimals rock salt, ferruginous and arsenical preparations, but all this\r\nis done without method, and according to each man's will and pleasure.\r\nIt would, therefore, be necessary to institute regulations, and to see\r\nthem carried out and practised under the superintendence of public\r\nfunctionaries, armed with sufficient power and authority.\r\n\r\nThese measures having been taken, others no less indispensable ought to\r\nfollow. They should determine for the herds of cattle intended for\r\nexportation, the ways and channels they must travel by to go to any\r\ncentral part or to any railway station; and there the inspectors on duty\r\nshould mark every animal that passes out of the district he is leaving.\r\nHeavy penalties should be inflicted on all who might infringe these\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nThese precautions would contribute in part to arrest the propagation of\r\nthe complaint; but there is another measure more radical and effectual,\r\nwhich should be taken in order to prevent its extension--we mean\r\ninoculation, which has met with complete success in some of the\r\ngovernments of Russia.\r\n\r\nThus we see, there are powerful means of withstanding the production of\r\nthe disease in its focus, or generative bed, and likewise its extension\r\namong the herds of neighbouring countries; and these latter might render\r\nthem in some sort obligatory, by refusing most rigidly to admit to their\r\nmarkets, as in Italy has sometimes been done, every head of cattle which\r\nwas not marked as inoculated or which was not furnished with a permit of\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive that those countries wherein the ox-typhus has\r\nits birth, and for which the breeding of cattle and their exportation\r\nare a great source of wealth, would soon feel that they are more\r\ninterested than any other in stifling the contagion in its focus, and in\r\naffording to those countries that receive their herds, every security\r\nand guarantee which they have a right to expect. Interest in this case\r\ncoming to the help of common sense, very satisfactory results would in\r\ncourse of time be obtained.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we are conscious that we are here dealing with very\r\ncomplicated questions; for, though in a book they may seem simple and\r\neasy, their application is a matter of extreme difficulty. We know too\r\nwell that these preventive measures for protecting animals will meet\r\nwith many obstacles, and only be adopted at last with tardy reluctance,\r\nsince man himself continues in some respect indifferent to the causes\r\nwhich spread about the fearful epidemics to which he falls a victim in\r\nconsequence of his neglect.\r\n\r\nIn truth, it is well known that the cholera of the present day--that\r\nmuch more serious _plague_--had its origin on the banks of the Red Sea,\r\namidst the infectious miasmata developed near Mecca, where thousands of\r\npilgrims who had died of fatigue and privation, and hundreds of\r\nthousands of sheep butchered and religiously offered up in sacrifice,\r\nhave, beneath a torrid heat, generated the choleraic miasma, which\r\nformerly was supposed to be produced exclusively on the banks of the\r\nGanges. This fact duly ascertained and proved, we might suppose that the\r\ngovernments of the different nations among which the cholera is about to\r\nextend its ravages, were indignant and had complained at thus being\r\nsmitten with a scourge, due to the careless ignorance and sordid avidity\r\nof some official of the Turkish Government. But we should be mistaken.\r\n\r\nNo! every one hoped at first that he, at least, would be spared by the\r\ncontagion, and the authorities did nothing to resist the evil but adopt\r\nthe old course of _quarantine_--a remedy more illusory now than ever,\r\nsince the nations are in constant communication, either in their own\r\npersons or by the exchange of their commodities; and consequently, the\r\nepidemic is pursuing its invading course from week to week.\r\n\r\nThat which is being done for the cholera gives us a scale by which we\r\nmay estimate the efforts which will be made to arrest the generation and\r\nthe contagion of the cattle typhus.[R]\r\n\r\nWe are certainly bound to resist the introduction of horned cattle\r\ntainted with typhus; but in the conditions amidst which they live, some\r\nof them may bear the seeds of the distemper, even whilst they appear in\r\nperfect health, and therefore able to endure the fatigue of a long\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to avoid exciting the incubation of the typhus during\r\ntheir transit either to Finland, Holland, France, or England, it must\r\nnever be forgotten that these animals are gifted with a nervous\r\nsensibility of wonderful acuteness, joined to the weakest vital\r\nresistance. Care must be taken to husband their strength, to give them a\r\nchoice distribution of food easy of assimilation; barley-meal, or other\r\ngrains, must be mixed up with their drink; they must be protected from\r\nthe changes of weather; they must have room enough and air enough in the\r\nlocomotive stalls on the railway trains and on board ship.\r\n\r\nWe pass over in silence the hygienic measures to be taken in order to\r\nkeep these vehicles of transit in a proper sanitary state: the sanitary\r\npolice regulations inserted further on will make them sufficiently\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nAll these measures having been taken to meet and withstand distant\r\ncauses and dangers, let us now direct our attention to those local\r\ncauses which strike our eyes, and which likewise have their share of\r\ninfluence in propagating the disease. Thus, whenever an inclement season\r\ncomes to deprive the herbivorous animals of sufficient pasture, or to\r\ndeteriorate its natural qualities, we are bound to remedy this change,\r\nand to increase the cares we devote to them; for these frail and\r\nhelpless creatures, immediately feel and suffer from the effects of a\r\nsustenance less than usually restorative. Under such circumstances, we\r\nmust make exceptional sacrifices; when they return from feeding on the\r\ngrass, we should give them some additional fodder, or roots of a\r\ngenerous quality. We must imitate the regimen used in the country of the\r\nsteppes, by adding to their forage a solution of marine salt, or a\r\nsolution of sulphate of iron. Day by day we must give to the weakest and\r\nleast fed cattle, a ration consisting of bruised oats, pounded juniper\r\nberries, gentian, sulphate of iron, and carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\nFor, if we neglect to take those measures which are required to prevent\r\namong herbivorous animals the development of those ordinary epizootias,\r\nwhich every year are generated on our own soil, they will certainly\r\nafford a favourable seat to the typhic miasma transmitted by foreign\r\nanimals, or exceptionally generated by themselves. These cares and\r\nattentions must be greatly increased, when the foreign epizootia, has\r\nspread itself, as in the present instance, among our flocks and herds.\r\nThen, indeed, we must be careful not to load these creatures with\r\npampering food for the purpose of fattening them. For it may be\r\nprofitable, and the breeder may plume himself, on having produced an\r\nadipose monstrosity to such a degree as to bury, for instance, a pig's\r\nhead in the fleshy exuberance of his thorax; but such a derogation from\r\nthe laws of nature borders closely on disease, and assuredly such an\r\nunnatural accumulation, predisposes the glutted animals to epizootic\r\ndiseases in general.\r\n\r\nThe water given them to drink must be attended to with particular\r\nsolicitude. It should never be drawn up from ponds or stagnant rivers.\r\nThe animals kept in the pasture grounds should always find at their\r\ndisposal, in receptacles intended for their use, a supply of pure fresh\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAfter these precautions with respect to their food and sustenance,\r\nattention must next be directed to the hygienic conditions required by\r\nthe animal. Every morning he should be cleaned, washed, brushed, and\r\ndried; what is every day done for the horse must now be done for the ox.\r\nThese unusual cares will be most salutary to him, and greatly increase\r\nhis vital resistance.\r\n\r\nThe animal thus protected in his food and particular necessities,\r\nattention must next be directed to the stalls and sheds. Over-crowding\r\nmust be carefully avoided; the proper cube of air for breathing must be\r\nmeasured out for each head of cattle; every day the latter must be\r\ncarried out into the open air; the floor of the stall or shed must first\r\nbe thoroughly cleansed and washed out, after which it must be sprinkled\r\nwith a solution of chloride of lime. If the stall is not well aired, a\r\nlittle straw should be burned on the ground, to improve the atmosphere,\r\nor else branches of resinous trees, or juniper berries may be used. In\r\nsome cases aromatic fumigations of sage, rosemary, or mint, boiled in\r\nwater, are employed, the balsamic vapours which arise therefrom being at\r\nonce tonic and purifying. During the night a tub, containing pitch and\r\ntar, should be left in the stall, or a large piece of camphor should be\r\nsuspended from the ceiling. Vinegar may be spilt on a piece of red-hot\r\niron, or powder of sulphur may be burned into sulphuric gas and diffuse\r\nits vapours through the stall or shed. This excellent parasiticide may\r\nperhaps be equally endowed with anti-typhic properties.\r\n\r\nFinally, when this fatal epizootia is ravaging the country, every farmer\r\nand agriculturist must carefully abstain from mixing with his herds any\r\ncattle which have been bought either at fairs or markets; he must take\r\ncare, conformably with the directions issued by the Privy Council, (to\r\nwhich we refer the reader for more ample details,) to avoid all contact\r\nboth direct and indirect with horned cattle tainted with the typhus, as\r\nhe might himself become an instrument of the contagion.--Let him never\r\nforget that to take as the guide for his actions in these times of\r\ncalamity his private and personal interest, is the greatest crime a man\r\ncan commit. Let him strive, therefore, to assist the authorities in the\r\nmeasures which they have taken for the interest of all.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nNow that we have examined the measures which prudence directs us to take\r\nto defend ourselves against the causes which produce and propagate\r\ntyphus, let us think of the means of preventing it, when the contagion\r\nthreatens to diffuse itself over a whole kingdom, as at present it is\r\ndoing in England.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 19th of last June, it was believed that the typhus or\r\nCattle Plague, as they continue to call it, had effected its invasion in\r\nEngland, the Government, informed by professional men of the serious\r\ndanger to which the interests of the country would be exposed, if the\r\ndisease should spread, might have considered this distemper not as a\r\nquestion of private interest, but as one of public and national concern.\r\nIt might at the outset have given to this epizootia all the significancy\r\nof a public calamity, have looked upon it as the invasion of an enemy\r\nthreatening to destroy its territory, and have employed every possible\r\nmeans to stifle it at its birth.\r\n\r\nWe well know that the English Government, derived as it is rather from\r\npolitical than from religious and social changes, is at once\r\nmonarchical, aristocratic, and partially democratic, and for that reason\r\nembarrassed in its working by so many wheels. Its authority is scattered\r\nand divided, whilst the respect ascribed to the prerogatives of each\r\ndistinct public power is the safeguard of the State. In the absence of\r\nboth Houses during the recess, it could take no resolution as to ways\r\nand means; for the difficulties on this unhappy occasion, we cannot too\r\noften repeat it, are reduced to a question of money. Deprived of the\r\nrequisite authority, it was unable to do more than exhume the old laws\r\non the matter and ordain new ones. And yet, the impotence of the\r\nGovernment was not perhaps so great as is imagined; for whilst it\r\nsuffered the typhus almost unmolested to devastate the country, it very\r\njustly, and in the name of the public interest, took vigorous and\r\neffectual measures to stamp out another epidemic--the rash and insane\r\nconspiracy of the Fenians. It stood still and would not authorize\r\ndomiciliary visits in stables and stalls, nor the seizure of sick\r\nanimals, but it did not falter a moment at the domiciliary visits and\r\nincarceration of insurgent citizens meditating mischief, so that in\r\nthis instance, the privilege of immunity has been given to the brute\r\ncreation. Everybody, both in England and out of England, admires their\r\nvigour and despatch in stifling the insurrection in its bud. But why not\r\nact with equal promptitude in the case of an epizootia?\r\n\r\nArming itself, in this manner, in the public interest, and with\r\nsufficient power, the Government might have appointed an executive\r\ncommission, with the Lord Mayor as president. Such a commission would\r\nhave applied itself at once to the consideration and studious\r\nexamination of the subject in all its bearings, and would have proposed\r\nprompt and energetic measures, which the Government, with equal\r\ndespatch, would have confirmed by giving to them the authority of law,\r\nas they have since tardily done. A fund, which, for the wealth of\r\nEngland, would not have been considerable, 250,000_l._--the cost of a\r\nfew Armstrong guns--might have been placed at the disposal of this\r\nBoard, to enable its directors to meet and provide for, without delay,\r\nevery just claim and want arising from the scourge.\r\n\r\nAn auxiliary commission, exclusively medical, and consisting of medical\r\nand veterinary doctors, might have been formed conjointly with the\r\nformer, and every preventive measure, considered by them as necessary to\r\nstamp out the complaint at the outbreak, after it had been proposed by\r\nthe medical board, and submitted to the executive commission, and by\r\nthem to the Home Secretary, might have been acted upon by law within\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nTaken unawares, and the mode of treating the sick animals not being\r\nknown at first, they would have been reduced to the cruel necessity of\r\nexterminating at once all tainted cattle, as well as those belonging to\r\ntainted herds, but not without compensating the owners of those\r\ncattle.[S]\r\n\r\nThey would have sent two physicians to Russia and Hungary, to observe\r\nand study the preventive and curative medication, especially their mode\r\nof inoculation, and thanks to the rapid locomotion of these times,\r\ntwenty days would have been sufficient for this foreign exploration.\r\nThe physicians constituting the medical board should have been\r\nauthorized to seize any beast tainted with the typhus; a company should\r\nhave been charged to collect and keep ready for the public service, at\r\nthe four quarters of London, an ample retinue of horses, closed\r\ncarriages, and working men, to convey at all hours of the day and night\r\nthe carcases of the slaughtered animals to the respective spots, where\r\nlong and deep trenches had been dug to receive them. Each carcase before\r\nburial to have been well sprinkled with chloride of lime.\r\n\r\nBy taking this course, every one's interest would have been respected,\r\nas much as can be desired when a great calamity threatens a country;\r\nbesides, in doing so, the present ministers would but have followed the\r\nexample of the Government (with regard to compensation), during the\r\nepizootia of the eighteenth century. The proprietors who had thus\r\nreceived, not the full and absolute price, but a sum sufficiently\r\nremunerative for their sacrificed cattle, would have assisted the\r\nauthorities, and thereby would have served the common interest, because\r\ntheir sick cattle, perishing every hour within their stalls and sheds,\r\nwere no longer a real source of embarrassment and ruin. They would not\r\nhave been obliged to drive them to market to get what they could out of\r\nthem and disencumber themselves. The most active cause of the contagion\r\nwould by this means have been prevented.\r\n\r\nThis allowance having been made for the most pressing dangers, attention\r\nshould next have been directed to a matter no less important--we mean\r\nthe treatment and cure of this distemper; for we will never admit that\r\nEngland can have fallen back a century, and that whilst those\r\nenlightened men--Malcolm Flemming and Layard--proposed and tried to cure\r\nand prevent ox-typhus in 1757, we, in 1865, shall have been reduced to\r\nthe horrible alternative, the repugnant barbarity, of the general and\r\nindiscriminate extermination of the tainted cattle.\r\n\r\nWhilst, therefore, the treatment of the typhus would have been studied\r\non the spot, and the most urgent measures would have been taken to\r\nwithstand the propagation of the evil, they would have established, a\r\nfew miles from London and on the northern side, in the direction of the\r\ngreat cattle market, a number of hospitals or sanitariums, and, as far\r\nas possible, within a park. These hospitals, constructed of wood,\r\ncontaining, besides stables and sheds, a slaughter-house, a\r\ndwelling-house for the staff of employés, a laboratory stocked with all\r\nthe physical and chemical instruments required, &c., would in two or\r\nthree weeks have been sufficiently prepared to receive a certain number\r\nof cattle.\r\n\r\nProvided with these advantages and opportunities, a permanent stage of\r\noperation would have been raised on which trials and experiments might\r\nhave been made with every chance of fruitful results. In these\r\nsanitariums, for instance, the most practical physicians and\r\nveterinarians might have entered upon a systematic course of treatment,\r\ndividing the bovine patients into classes, according to their periods of\r\ndisease, their age, &c.; and trying some particular mode of treatment,\r\nsome remedy considered as effectual, alternately, upon each of these\r\nclasses of tainted cattle. These experiments, having been made under\r\ncircumstances so favourable, would have enabled the faculty to\r\nestablish a medical basis, which, if not infallible, would have been\r\nrelatively efficacious, and might have saved a large number of the\r\ninfected animals.\r\n\r\nWhilst thus fixing their attention on the cure of the sick animals,\r\nthese experimentalists would have carefully studied and practised the\r\npreventive treatment by inoculation, availing themselves both of\r\nLayard's hints and recommendations and of the practical knowledge\r\nacquired by the medical expedition to the steppes, which would by that\r\ntime have returned from their mission. They would have selected animals\r\nsmitten with the genuine typhus, of the typhoid and intestinal form, in\r\n_the third period_, whilst the depurative and critical secretions are\r\nrunning from the mucous membranes; they would have gathered the virus\r\nfrom its springs of infection or from its purulent subcutaneous deposits\r\nor from the serum of the blood.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, they might have chosen four heifers, of good\r\nconstitutions and healthy, and these they might have prepared, according\r\nto Layard's advice, for inoculation, by a special treatment, and by\r\nhygienic and medical cares. On some of these the inoculation would have\r\nbeen made near the tail, according to the subcutaneous process, with a\r\nlancet charged with typhic virus; on others, a crucial incision, or\r\ncross-cut, would have been made on the crupper. But, to speak truth, we\r\ncannot do better than Layard, whose ingenious treatment, with all due\r\ndeference to a certain veterinarian of our day, deserves a very\r\ndifferent epithet than that of being amusing.[T] Layard says:--\r\n\r\n      \"That nothing may be omitted which in any shape can\r\n      contribute to the success of inoculation, due attention\r\n      should be paid to the constitution and state of the beast,\r\n      no less in this practice on the cattle than on the human\r\n      species. Undoubtedly the young, healthy, and strong bid\r\n      fairer for a good issue than the old, sickly, and feeble;\r\n      each of these different constitutions demand a particular\r\n      treatment, even in the method of preparation; and however\r\n      trifling it may seem to many--the urging a necessity of\r\n      preparation--I will venture to affirm that I have seen\r\n      excellent effects arising from a rational preparation, and\r\n      fatal events from want of preparation. I have likewise been\r\n      witness of unfavourable turns, merely from an injudicious\r\n      preparation.\r\n\r\n      \"The beasts which are sanguine require moderate bleeding;\r\n      those that have but a small share of blood must have none\r\n      drawn. The strong must, besides moderate bleeding and\r\n      purging, be kept on light diet and their body kept open.\r\n      Thus, scalded bran, mixed with their hay and chaff; will\r\n      cool them. The weakly, and such as are inclined to scour,\r\n      must be kept on dry fodder, and have peas and beans given\r\n      them to strengthen them. A mess of malt, or a quart of warm\r\n      ale, with a few spices, will be very suitable for them.\r\n\r\n      \"Whatever diseases the cattle be affected with, if time will\r\n      permit, they are first to be removed.\r\n\r\n      \"The cattle to be inoculated are first to be well washed,\r\n      rubbed dry, and then curried, to remove all the filth from\r\n      the hair and skin. Then they are to be placed in a spacious\r\n      barn or stable, where the air is temperate and no cold can\r\n      come to them. There they are to be prepared according to the\r\n      direction already given, foddered with good sweet hay, and\r\n      watered with clear spring water; and if the distemper be not\r\n      near they may be turned out into the air, near the barn or\r\n      stable, and may stay there a few hours in the middle of the\r\n      day.\r\n\r\n      \"When it appears that the cattle are in perfect health, free\r\n      from any infection or other disease, brisk and lively,\r\n      neither costive nor scouring, and chewing their cud, then\r\n      the operation may be safely undertaken, and henceforth they\r\n      must be confined to the barn.\r\n\r\n      \"Since there is observed to follow the greatest flow of the\r\n      contagious and putrid particles separated from the blood,\r\n      wherever the infectious matter makes an impression at first,\r\n      particular care must be taken not to inoculate near such\r\n      vital parts as the heart and lungs, nor near the womb, if a\r\n      cow with calf be inoculated; for, though rowels are properly\r\n      applied in the dewlaps, to draw off the pestilential humour\r\n      from the breast, and in other cases beasts are frequently\r\n      rowelled in the flanks,--yet in this operation, as matter is\r\n      inserted by these channels into the neighbouring vessels,\r\n      those vital parts, or the womb, might become the chief seat\r\n      of the disease, and the event prove fatal.\r\n\r\n      \"To prevent such accidents, human beings have been\r\n      inoculated on the arms and legs, and now-a-days the arms are\r\n      found sufficient. I would recommend that the cattle should\r\n      be inoculated about the middle of the shoulders or buttocks,\r\n      on both sides, to have the benefit of two drains. The skin\r\n      is to be cut lengthways two inches, deep enough for the\r\n      blood to start, but not to bleed much. In this incision is\r\n      to be put a dossil or pledget of tow, dipped in the matter\r\n      of a boil full ripe, opened in the back of a young calf\r\n      recovering from the distemper. It may not be amiss to stitch\r\n      up the wound, to keep the tow in, and let it remain\r\n      forty-eight hours. Then the stitches are to be cut, the tow\r\n      taken out, and the wound dressed with yellow basilicon\r\n      ointment, or one made with turpentine and yolk of egg,\r\n      spread on pledgets of tow. These dressings are to be\r\n      continued during the whole illness, and till after the\r\n      recovery of the beast, to promote the discharge; and then\r\n      the wound may be healed with the cerate of lapis\r\n      calaminaris, or any other.\r\n\r\n      \"On the third day after inoculation, the discolouring of the\r\n      wound, whose lips appear grey and swollen, will be a sign\r\n      that the inoculation has succeeded; but the beasts, as\r\n      Professor Swenke informs us, did not fall ill till the sixth\r\n      day, which answers exactly to the observations daily made in\r\n      the inoculating of children. Yet the Professor adds that on\r\n      the third day a costiveness came on, which was removed by\r\n      giving each calf three ounces of Epsom salts.\r\n\r\n      \"No sooner do the symptoms of heaviness and stupidity appear\r\n      than the beasts must have a light covering thrown over them,\r\n      and at night fastened loosely. They must be rubbed morning\r\n      and evening, and curried, till the boils begin to rise; warm\r\n      hay-water and vinegar-whey must be given plentifully. Should\r\n      the beasts require more nourishment, dry meat, such as hay,\r\n      with a little bran, may be offered. I should be very\r\n      cautious in giving milk-pottage, even after the boils and\r\n      pimples had all come out, for fear of bringing on a\r\n      scouring. However, this caution is proper, that whenever\r\n      milk-pottage be given the vinegar-whey is to be omitted for\r\n      obvious reasons. In cases of accident, the same attention is\r\n      to be observed in the disease by inoculation as in the\r\n      natural way, and the medicines recommended are the same I\r\n      would use; but by inoculation there seldom is a call for\r\n      any, so favourably does the distemper proceed through its\r\n      several stages.\r\n\r\n      \"The crisis being over, it will be proper to purge the\r\n      cattle, to air them by degrees, and to have the same regard\r\n      in the management of them as is laid down in the chapter on\r\n      the method of cure.\"\r\n\r\nThe typhic virus is so highly infectious and poisonous that the first\r\nanimals inoculated would have all died; it would have been necessary to\r\ninoculate successively a number of animals with the virus derived from\r\nthe first inoculation, and transmitted from an inoculated animal to a\r\nhealthy one, by which means they would have acquired a virus of the\r\nfirst, second, third generation, and so on. These inoculations having\r\nalways been made on four animals at a time; on two of them, the disease\r\nwould have been left to take its own course, in order that the\r\nexperimentalists might watch its progress and development, and the two\r\nothers would have supplied the virus for inoculation.\r\n\r\nAt the third or fourth generation, the virus, modified and attenuated in\r\nits infectious principles, would no longer have been mortal in its\r\neffects, as experience has proved in Russia. Then the inoculated\r\nanimals, placed under the control of hygienic cares and a few purgative\r\nand tonic medications, would have passed from convalescence to health.\r\nThe virus thus attenuated would have supplied the means of a practical\r\ninoculation on a large scale to all healthy animals.\r\n\r\nProceeding thus, they would, moreover, but have followed the method\r\nadopted in those times of epidemic and epizootia when the small-pox is\r\nraging. On those occasions, we subject our sick patients to vaccination\r\nor revaccination; we inoculate the variola in our sheep threatened with\r\nthe contagion; we pursue the same course in cases of epizootia, of\r\nperipneumonia. And truly, that which it is reasonable to do in one case\r\nmay be generalized and applied to a greater number.\r\n\r\nThe experiment we have suggested might, perhaps, have been long and\r\ndifficult, nay, even costly, but we should have established, after a\r\ncertain time, the rational method of this preventive treatment, and have\r\ndistributed the same throughout the country. Veterinarians would have\r\nformed in particular districts their centre of operation, in which the\r\npreventive virus might have been produced, and they might have gone from\r\nfarm-house to farm-house to inoculate all the cattle within them.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts and observations made by the physicians, precious\r\ndocuments would have been derived; and if, contrary to all expectation,\r\nsuccess had not justified every hope, we should have bequeathed to\r\nfuture generations facts and experiences which would have been of the\r\nmost useful character to them and full of instruction. Thus it is that\r\nscience advances and progress is accomplished.\r\n\r\nIf all that we have just indicated as a realizable matter had been done,\r\nin effect, England would have afforded in this, as she has so often done\r\nin other cases, a noble example to be followed, and would have acquired\r\na new title to the admiration of other nations.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately it has not been so: silence has succeeded to\r\neloquence at Guildhall, and the meetings at the Mansion-house have\r\nflickered away. That which was held on the 27th of September, seems\r\nlikely to be the last of them.[U]\r\n\r\nThe subscriptions which, in spite of all the praiseworthy efforts and\r\nearnestness of the Lord Mayor, did not reach 2000_l._, were returned to\r\nthe subscribers, so that all the attempts which have been made to\r\ncentralize the direction to be given to the various measures have proved\r\nabortive. The plan of forming sanitariums, as well as that of\r\ncompensating the owners of cattle, have both fallen to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhat can we think of such a state of things when we see the ox-typhus\r\nextending its ravages to sheep, and have to fear that the disease will\r\nspread to other animal species? What serious reflections it creates in\r\nour minds, and what awful consequences we might deduce therefrom! But\r\nwhat would be the use of them?\r\n\r\nLet us add, however, that France, save on the recognised principle of\r\nindemnification, and a more speedy extermination of her tainted cattle,\r\nhas shown the same deficiency as to the means of treatment as England;\r\nwhilst we have the consolation of attributing this impotence on the part\r\nof this country to the fact that the outbreak of the epizootia has\r\noccurred during the Parliamentary recess.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, to institutions rather than to individuals that we\r\nmust ascribe the impossibility of conquering the difficulties which have\r\nbeen met, and which at any other time might not have obstructed the\r\ncourse of things. Far be it from us therefore to accuse of indifference\r\na great people renowned for their zealous promotion of public interests,\r\nfor their charity and inexhaustible philanthropy, whose innumerable\r\nasylums have been opened to every misfortune, who support so many\r\nhospitals and public charities by their voluntary contributions, and\r\nwho, in so many calamities, have seen some devoted heroine issue from\r\nher retirement to assuage them. For if the Crimean war produced its lady\r\nbeneficent in the person of Florence Nightingale, all of us must allow\r\nthat if others had followed the example of Miss Burdett Coutts, who, in\r\na manner, has stood alone against the storm, by the facilities she has\r\nafforded for treating and experimentalizing on the cattle smitten with\r\ntyphus, the formidable scourge might have been arrested in its focus.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_Curative Medication._\r\n\r\nWe might acquire the means of resisting the general causes which develop\r\nthe typhus; we might stop its diffusion, we might even prevent it, by\r\ninoculating the sound and healthy animals, and yet it would be\r\nnecessary, none the less, to search for the means of curing it; for, as\r\nin the small-pox, the preventive treatment of which we know, certain\r\ncircumstances would arise in the disease which would oblige us to treat\r\nit. And as we are far from being able to resist the generation and\r\ndissemination of this scourge, which reckons almost as many victims as\r\nsufferers, it is important to make known what treatment we can oppose to\r\nthe functional derangements to which it gives rise.\r\n\r\nAs we have already said, this typhus, when the organism has absorbed its\r\npeccant and infectious miasma, produces a succession of disorders which\r\nbecome in a manner temporary functions; it pursues its phases, its\r\nperiods; and as the functional derangements differ at these several\r\nepochs from the development of the morbid phenomena, the course of\r\nmedicine which is employed to check them cannot always be the same.\r\nStarting, therefore, from practical data, we will attend the disease in\r\nits gradual advance--that is to say, in its distinct periods--and will\r\nafterwards explain certain predominant symptoms, which, owing to their\r\nimportance, must likewise fix the attention of the careful therapeutist.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that we have recognised four periods in the\r\nregular course of typhus:--\r\n\r\n  1st, a period of incubation;\r\n  2nd, a period of initiation;\r\n  3rd, a period of duration;\r\n  4th, a period of decline.\r\n\r\nBut, in the first place, before beginning the treatment, every farmer or\r\ngrazier, or cattle-owner, who keeps a certain number of cattle, should\r\ndivide his herd into several classes, in order to regulate and methodize\r\nthe cares to be given to the sick.\r\n\r\nThus, he will form a first class, comprising the animals in a sound and\r\nhealthy state, having had no intercourse, either direct or indirect,\r\nwith the tainted cattle, and which he will be careful immediately to\r\nisolate and keep apart.\r\n\r\nA second class must be formed of those beasts, which, though as yet\r\nunaffected with the distemper, have, nevertheless, been exposed more or\r\nless directly to its contagion, by living and consorting with them, or\r\nby their contact with other animals, either at fairs or markets, or in\r\nthe ships and cattle-trucks on the railway during their transit from one\r\nplace to another. The horned cattle composing this latter class must be\r\ncarefully watched, and be made the subject of the preventive treatment,\r\nthe moment the first sign appears of the working of the incubation.\r\n\r\nA third class must be formed, consisting of cattle actually smitten with\r\nthe distemper.\r\n\r\nThese divisions of animals being thus settled and separated, will\r\ndiminish the labour and the cost of treatment and the liability to\r\ndiffuse the complaint, especially when the epizootia begins to lose its\r\nvirulence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Period--of Incubation._\r\n\r\nWe have said that infectious diseases, when once the frame had suffered\r\nthe effects of the poisonous miasma, pursued their fatal course, and\r\nthat, generally speaking, it was impossible after such infection to\r\narrest its development. We say generally, for the typhus at the outbreak\r\nof its appearance on a virgin soil sometimes manifests itself in a\r\nbenignant manner, then it becomes more destructive, by-and-bye its\r\npernicious properties decline, and it in some sort goes out of itself.\r\nOne would say that the epizootia, like those it smites, has likewise its\r\npeculiarities, its period of initiation, of duration, and of decline.\r\nThere are in consequence fixed times or epochs during which the\r\nsufferers afford better scope for our means of action; at a given moment\r\nthe attenuated virus, having lost much of its deadly effects, ceases to\r\nproduce death, which decline is the real source of the marvellous\r\nsuccesses obtained by certain remedies against the epizootia.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the distemper at its period of duration, and at its\r\nmost critical moment, cannot be fettered, we should not be justified in\r\nasserting positively the same, as respects the period of incubation.\r\nIndeed, we are convinced ourselves, that if ever this disease shall be\r\nclogged in the wheel, _if ever its specific remedy shall be discovered,\r\nit will be within the period of incubation_, when the economy begins to\r\nstruggle with the first phenomena of the poisoning. Be that as it may,\r\nwe cannot, in epizootic times, too earnestly enjoin the owners of cattle\r\nto submit their animals to a strict and close inspection, in order that,\r\nwhen the first signs of incubation appear, they may modify the animal's\r\nusual diet, and attack the disease at its birth, so as to render it\r\nabortive, if the thing can be done.\r\n\r\nAt this period we must endeavour to come to Nature's assistance, we must\r\nshake and stir up the economy, we must unseat the morbid functions which\r\nseek to master us, and then the vital force, thus solicited and\r\nstimulated, may sometimes struggle with advantage. To do this\r\neffectually, if the animal is atonic and predisposed to adynamia, if his\r\ninternal organs are relaxed, we will strengthen him by administering\r\nevery day a stimulating beverage. If he is confined to the stall we\r\nwill give him the open air, and let him graze the fields; which is a\r\ntreatment by itself for the invalid animal, so vivifying is the pure air\r\nof the common, and so thoroughly different from the atmosphere which is\r\npent up within his stall. If the animal is strong, lusty, exuberant with\r\nhealth, let him be purged once or twice, the purgative to be given at\r\nintervals of twenty-four hours. (We shall give the medical formula in\r\nthe chapter addressed to farmers, graziers, &c.)\r\n\r\nThis purgation, moreover, will correspond with the theory of those\r\nauthors who consider the evacuations as the proper means of delivering\r\nthe economy from the infectious miasms which have been absorbed.\r\n\r\nIf the beast is plethoric, recourse should sometimes be had to bleeding,\r\nespecially in hot and dry seasons, like the one we have recently passed\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nThese stimulative and depletive medications cannot but be favourable to\r\nthe animal, since it will anticipate the treatment to which he must be\r\nsubmitted a few days later, when the disease shall have declared\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nTo this treatment, in some sort preventive, must be annexed an\r\n_antimiasmatic_ beverage, either a _permanganate of potash_, or a\r\nsolution of _chlorate of potash_, or of _arsenic acid_ in powder, mixed\r\nwith some aromatized beverage, or solution of _arseniate of soda_. These\r\nanti-typhic drinks must be discontinued on those days when the sick\r\ncattle are purged.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said, that during this period of incubation the\r\nfeeding of the cattle must be strictly attended to, and that the animal\r\nmust receive unusual hygienic care.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Second Period, or that of Initiation._\r\n\r\nAt this period the constitution and temperament of the sick cattle must\r\nfirst of all be deliberately studied, so as to ascertain fully which are\r\n_lymphatic_, which are _nervous_, and which are _sanguine_. We must\r\nnotice the age, the sex, the state of gestation, and make allowance for\r\nany prior complaints to which any of the sick cattle may have been\r\nsubject. For if, like certain system-mongers, we reduced the treatment\r\nof all tainted cattle to the same mathematical formula of medication,\r\nthat is, either to bleeding or to purging exclusively, we should\r\ncertainly increase the number of victims.\r\n\r\nIn this stage of the disease we have to contend with the derangements of\r\nthe circulation and secretions. The fever is generally intense, the\r\nblood is inflamed or vitiated, the mucous membranes are dried up;\r\nshiverings, alternations of cold and heat, &c., occur. We must then\r\nmitigate these morbid phenomena either by bleeding or purging. The\r\nbleeding must be more or less copious, according to the strength of the\r\nanimal. For, it must not be forgotten that we have several critical\r\nphases to pass through, and if we exhaust the animal by too largely\r\ndraining him of blood, we may forfeit the success of the treatment. If\r\nbleeding is considered unnecessary, let the sufferer be purged at once,\r\nby administering either _sulphate of magnesia_ (_Epsom salts_), _or\r\nsulphate of soda_ (_Glauber's salt_). These purges to be taken daily,\r\nfor two or three days, according to the way they operate. Linseed oil,\r\nmixed in some warm beverage, may be given instead of these, or else a\r\nmixture of rhubarb and calomel, or even a decoction of senna. Preference\r\nshould be given to saline or laxative purges, as, drastic purgatives,\r\nsuch as aloes or jalap, sometimes concentrate the inflammation on the\r\nnarrow parts of the digestive channels.\r\n\r\nIn this second stage--the period of initiation--the appetite is\r\ngenerally gone, the thirst excessive; so that nutritive or solid feeding\r\nmust of course be suppressed.\r\n\r\nAs for the drinks, they must be cold, consisting of water with\r\nsufficient flour mixed in it to whiten it, and a little vinegar or\r\nsulphuric acid, to acidulate it. A decoction of good hay with some\r\nmarine salt, or nitrate of potash; a decoction of pellitory or\r\nwall-wort, of ground-ivy, or whey, or buttermilk, likewise acidulated,\r\nand which the cattle are very partial to, will in every way be suitable\r\nfor their use. If the heat of the skin diminishes, and if congestion\r\nappears to settle on the lungs, the drinks must be given warm,\r\nconsisting of a decoction of borage leaves, mallows, marsh-mallow, and\r\npellitory. In these cases, the body must be protected from chills by\r\noverlaying it with blankets, so as to keep the mass of the blood as much\r\nas possible on the surface, and check the tendency it has to load the\r\ninternal organs.\r\n\r\nBy following these prescriptions, we shall answer all the conditions of\r\nthe treatment during the second period. In truth, by the process of\r\nbleeding, we shall have reduced the heat of the fever, and prevented too\r\ngreat a flow towards the nervous, pulmonary, or digestive centres. The\r\npurgings will have acted with similar effects; and, what is more, they\r\nwill have cleared the _primæ viæ_, and rendered the circulation of the\r\nabdominal apparatus more easy. In fine, the drinks will have contributed\r\nto assuage the violence of the fever. The washing, which must be\r\neffected with a wet sponge passed over the nose, mouth, and eyes, and\r\nthen over the skin, which must afterwards be rubbed dry, will be both\r\nuseful and pleasant to the sick animal. This cleansing will maintain the\r\nimportant functions of the skin in due order.\r\n\r\nSome persons have advocated as most efficacious at this period\r\nhydro-therapia, or the Water-cure, in the form of warm and cold\r\nablutions, vapour baths, &c. This treatment, so bracing by its revulsive\r\naction, and the powerful influence of which we witnessed for several\r\nyears in the establishment which we superintended at Belle Vue, near\r\nParis, might prove of some service in ox-typhus, especially in the form\r\nof the vapour bath; but it requires so much practice, and so incessant\r\nand watchful a care, that it is needful to have the process attended by\r\nan experienced practitioner.\r\n\r\nWe must remark, in addition, that the general state of the animal, and\r\nhis desire for food, will show the degree of strictness and restraint\r\nwhich must be observed in regulating his diet. His instinct must be\r\ntaken by us as a guide; and if the drinks rendered nutritive by the\r\naddition of bran, oatmeal, barley flour, or even seed of grass pounded,\r\nare relished by him, we must indulge his desires to some extent, in\r\norder to keep up his strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third Period, or that of Duration._\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the distemper we must watch and follow step by step the\r\nsymptoms which attend it, and come to their relief.\r\n\r\nAll the secretions have now resumed their course; from the mucous\r\nmembranes there occurs a copious discharge, first of all serous, then\r\nthick and muco-purulent; the breathing may be obstructed, the\r\ndiarrhoea frequent; the air infiltrates beneath the integument. The\r\nfever is sometimes continuous, sometimes intermittent. We must satisfy\r\nthe cravings of the vital powers by administering the same beverages as\r\nin the preceding period. Far from checking the diarrhoea, as some\r\nadvise, we must regulate the evacuations by means of laxatives, such as\r\ntartrate of potash, sulphate of magnesia, or sulphate of soda. It is\r\nvery essential, indeed, that the mucous membranes of the digestive\r\nchannels should be free, and not irritated by the contact of solid\r\nalimentary substances or bilious secretions.\r\n\r\nIf the diarrhoea be too frequent or irritating, we must give the\r\nsufferer night and morning a clyster, consisting of bran water.\r\n\r\nAt this period we will follow the advice given over and over again by\r\nall the physicians of the last century, and apply cauteries with red-hot\r\niron, or fix one or two setons either on the dewlap, the neck, or the\r\nthighs, and these issues must be kept open by means of basilicon\r\nointment. It is unquestionably of the highest importance to promote all\r\nthe depurative secretions in animals whose cellular tissue is choked up\r\nwith grease and lymph. Those only have got well in which the running has\r\nbeen regular and copious, and the wasting of the flesh progressive.\r\n\r\nIf the fever is not regular, two pills of sulphate of quinine must be\r\ngiven, each pill containing one gramme, one pill in the morning, the\r\nother during the day, in order to prevent the fit, which usually takes\r\nplace in the evening. If the state of atony, of adynamia, comes on at\r\nthis period, _acetate of ammonia_ must be given, from one to six ounces,\r\nin a pint of water, the same to be administered in two doses; only the\r\nacidulous or alkaline drinks must be discontinued, otherwise the acetate\r\nof ammonia would be decomposed in its passage into the digestive\r\nchannels. Finally, the eyes, the nostrils, and the mouth must be\r\nfrequently washed with an infusion of camomile, or some other aromatic\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe setons must be kept up very carefully. If the sick animal relishes\r\nthe nutritive beverages, let him have a decoction of bread, rice,\r\nbarley, or oats.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fourth Period, or that of Decline._\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the disease, in which adynamia predominates, everything\r\nmust tend to support the organism. The drinks must be bitter and\r\nstimulating; beer, with plenty of hops in it, with an addition of\r\npowdered Peruvian bark or sulphate of iron, may be given; or a decoction\r\nof this bark, with gentian roots, centaury leaves, and hops; or again, a\r\nbeverage may be administered night and morning, made of veterinary\r\ntheriacum, of extract of juniper and alcohol; or finally, an infusion of\r\naromatic plants.\r\n\r\nIf the diarrhoea be bloody and fetid, give the animal night and\r\nmorning a clyster, consisting of a decoction of Jesuit's bark, adding\r\nthereto a spoonful of powdered wood charcoal, pounded to the finest\r\npowder, and passed carefully through a sieve. If the running ceases, its\r\nreturn must be excited by injecting in the nostrils a spoonful of\r\nsternutatory vinegar or smelling salts. Finally, the purulent boils must\r\nbe opened, and dressed with stimulating ointment.\r\n\r\nAt this closing period, which determines the fate of the disease, as we\r\nsay, there is a tendency to despair of the cure. Seeing the fatal course\r\nof most attacks, we lose heart, death seems inevitable, and we yield its\r\nprey to its fangs. But let us not despair; let us remember that, in\r\nthese febrile infectious diseases, above all, the phenomena must almost\r\nalways proceed to the last stage of exhaustion of the vital powers to\r\nrender the cure attainable. Some patients, smitten with typhoid fever or\r\ncholera, have owed their lives to the indefatigable tenacity of the\r\ncontest _in extremis_ between life and death.\r\n\r\nI still see before me a choleraic patient, whom, during the epidemic of\r\n1849, I had left in the morning at ten o'clock, passing into the cold\r\nperiod. At five o'clock I returned to see him; the whole family was in\r\ntears, and the sheet had been thrown over the patient's head, as if he\r\nhad already breathed his last. Time was precious to me at that fell\r\nseason, and I was about to retire, when I applied my finger to the wrist\r\nof the sufferer, and felt a faint pulsation at long intervals. I threw\r\nmy coat off directly, called for flannel and essential oil of mustard,\r\nwhich I had prescribed that morning. I set the example, and instantly\r\nthe whole family helped me to rub the patient in every direction. In a\r\nquarter of an hour the heart quickened and revived, and in less than\r\nhalf an hour more the circulation resumed its course; at the end of an\r\nhour of this obstinate struggle the vital heat began to show itself--in\r\na word, the patient was saved.\r\n\r\nWe must not, therefore, give up the contest until the death of the\r\nsufferer is fully ascertained; and the same persistency should be\r\npractised in the case of animals smitten with the typhus. If the\r\ncirculation slackens, if the skin turns cold, take a piece of wool, coat\r\nit with rubefacient liniment, and rub the animal therewith, more\r\nparticularly along the spine. Then give him a cordial drink, and pass\r\n_raies de feu_ over the loins. All these appliances will help to\r\nstimulate the nervous system, and resuscitate the exhausted powers of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIf, at last, we are so fortunate as to overcome the profound adynamia\r\nwhich has utterly prostrated the frame, we next shall have to sustain\r\nthe sick animal by giving him decoctions of meat with sea-salt, or\r\nsulphate of iron added to it, or a light broth, made with meat and\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nHerbivorous animals, put upon a carnivorous diet, would not generally\r\nendure it, of course; but some of them rather incline to unctuous\r\nbeverages, and even to cooked or raw meat. All men know that certain\r\nhorse trainers give race-horses a small portion of meat, especially when\r\nthe races are coming on, in order to increase their mettle and strength.\r\n\r\nWe remember a sheep, which we saw at the Ecole d'Alfort, during our\r\nstudies of comparative pathology and the cutaneous diseases of domestic\r\nanimals, which manifested a great liking for meat, and even ate it\r\nravenously like a glutton.\r\n\r\nIn convalescence, the animal must be sent into the open air, in some\r\nfold enclosed with bars; he must be taken every day to pasture, each day\r\nincreasing the time he is allowed to feed, and gradually he will be left\r\nto return to his usual regimen. But still it must be observed, that in\r\nthis distemper convalescence is long and slow, and very deceitful. A too\r\nsubstantial course of feeding often revives the inflammation of the\r\nintestines by irritating ulcerations not yet healed, and more than one\r\nanimal which had been looked upon as cured has perished in its\r\nconvalescence through a lack of watchful attention.\r\n\r\nHerbivorous beasts, therefore, incline to and digest animal food;\r\nconsequently, we must give sick oxen meat broths, pure milk, or milk and\r\nwater. With these must be mixed wheat straw chopped small, for hay or\r\neven oat straw would swell and distend the stomachs.\r\n\r\nThe typhus in this epizootia is not regular in its progress and\r\ndevelopment. Frequently the nervous or pulmonary phenomena predominate,\r\nwhen the treatment, such as we have just explained, must be modified. We\r\nmust also bear in mind that nature does not divide a disease into\r\nperiods, like those we have adopted to render our exposition of the\r\nsymptoms more intelligible and the treatment itself more methodical.\r\n\r\nIf the nervous form of the disease prevails--if the animal shows\r\nalternations of dulness and restlessness--if, pressure on the spine is\r\nvery painful--above all, if, in bulls, for instance, there is plethora,\r\nlet the bleedings and purgings be increased in order to abate the\r\nnervous erethismus. In this form, the violence of the attack usually\r\ncarries off the beast. Should there, however, be any chance of saving\r\nhim it will be by employing this medication, which is at once revulsive\r\nand depletive, notwithstanding the well-known fact that bleedings, far\r\nfrom relieving the nervous system, sometimes aggravate its irritability.\r\n\r\nA general ablution with cold water may be tried in _desperate cases_.\r\nThe animal must then be immediately well rubbed, and covered with wool,\r\nin order to excite a thorough reaction.\r\n\r\nIn the pulmonary form of the typhus, but only during the acute stage,\r\nthe drinks must be warm and emollient, composed of a decoction of\r\nsoothing substances, with mallows, &c.; or one of linseed, to which must\r\nbe added some oxymel of squills and opium. The purgatives must be\r\nnon-stimulating; and emetics, freely diluted, for instance, will be\r\nvery serviceable.\r\n\r\nAt the third and fourth period in this pulmonary form of the disease,\r\nadopt the treatment prescribed for intestinal typhus.\r\n\r\nWe might have greatly enlarged the list of the pharmaceutic agents, but\r\nthe richer a treatment is in remedies the poorer it is in cures. We have\r\nmade choice of the simplest and safest among all the remedies advised by\r\nexperienced men, making allowance for the difficulties inherent to the\r\nnumber of animals, the mode of application, the cost, &c., always\r\nkeeping in view the life of the animal to be saved and the interest of\r\nthe cattle owners.\r\n\r\nWe think that the treatment by inoculation might have prevented the\r\ntyphus in a very large proportion, and that the curative medication\r\nmight have saved many of the infected cattle at the worst period of the\r\nepizootia.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the results which will one day be obtained, when we\r\nshall be able to supersede the barbarous process of general\r\nextermination, by the adoption of a rational treatment, founded at once\r\non science and practical experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n    _Hygienic Measures to be taken against the Extension of the\r\n      Contagion--Acts and Orders concerning Sanitary Police\r\n      Regulations._\r\n\r\nI have purposely neglected, in discussing the various plans of\r\ntreatment, certain measures to be adopted with the object of opposing\r\nthe spread of the contagion. The memorandum published on this subject by\r\nthe Privy Council, and drawn up by Dr. Thudichum, is so complete and so\r\nclear, that we can find nothing better to say. I recommend its perusal\r\nto all who possess horned cattle, and who have occasion to send them to\r\nany distance. It is of the highest importance to follow this judicious\r\nadvice, as the general interest will constitute here the safeguard of\r\nthe pecuniary interests of each in particular. I add to this memorandum\r\nupon hygienic measures, the consolidated and amended acts and orders\r\npublished under the head of \"Sanitary Police.\" In this way those\r\ninterested will have beneath their eyes all which it is important for\r\nthem to know, both in a medical and legal point of view.\r\n\r\n        MEMORANDUM _on the Principles and Practice of\r\n          Disinfection, as applicable to the present Epidemic of\r\n          Cattle Disease_.

Definition of disinfection.]\r\n\r\n      1. The term disinfection signifies the removal and\r\n      destruction, or destruction and subsequent removal of the\r\n      products of destruction, of all matters actually being or\r\n      containing products of disease capable of reproducing\r\n      disease in other animals.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 2. May include special purification and\r\n      deodorization.]\r\n\r\n      2. If the same processes and means, as used for this\r\n      purpose, are applied to the purification and deodorization\r\n      of places and things not actually infected, but capable or\r\n      suspected of being infected, then these preventive measures\r\n      are practically and properly included under the definition\r\n      of disinfection.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 3. Reproducers and primary carriers of\r\n      infection.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Infectious parts of dead animals.]\r\n\r\n      3. The reproducers of the infectious matter or contagion are\r\n      all kinds of cattle of the ox tribe, which also are at\r\n      present in this country the only animals liable to its\r\n      specific effects. It is probable that the contagion adheres\r\n      with particular pertinacity to all secretions and discharges\r\n      from sick animals. For this reason, fæces or droppings,\r\n      urine, ruminated food, all secretions from the mouth, nose,\r\n      and eyes, and any sore parts of the surface of the diseased\r\n      animals must be considered as the principal and primary\r\n      carriers of the infectious matter or plague poison. It is\r\n      also probable that many parts of animals which have died\r\n      from the cattle plague, or have been killed during advanced\r\n      stages of the disease, are infectious, some because they are\r\n      primarily imbued with the contagion, others because they\r\n      have been in contact with it after the death of the animal.\r\n      Skins, hides, hair, horns, and hoofs, must therefore always\r\n      be treated with precaution. The chances of infection by\r\n      flesh, fat, cleaned guts, and blood, are perhaps more\r\n      remote, but cannot be lost sight of.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 4. Particular danger of droppings, or fæces.]\r\n\r\n      4. The cattle plague, although affecting every part of the\r\n      animal, shows its visible effects most extensively in the\r\n      intestinal canal. It is believed, and apparently upon good\r\n      grounds, that the intestinal discharges are the principal\r\n      agents, upon the distribution of which mainly depends the\r\n      spread of the disorder.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 5. Enumeration of infected things and places.]\r\n\r\n      5. It follows from the above, that all articles which have\r\n      been in contact with a diseased animal, or any of its\r\n      discharges, particularly its fæces, are capable of carrying\r\n      the infection for an indefinite time, and must be looked\r\n      upon as being actually infectious to other healthy animals.\r\n      Such are racks of wood or iron; cribs or mangers of wood,\r\n      iron, or stone; articles used for fastening animals; leather\r\n      collars and straps, ropes and chains; all harness of any\r\n      animals used for drawing, and all carts, waggons, and\r\n      carriages which they have actually been drawing; the stalls\r\n      or sheds in which animals have been standing; the whole\r\n      lengths of the gutters and drains through which their urine\r\n      has been flowing; the entire surface over which their manure\r\n      has been drawn, and all implements with which the removal\r\n      has been effected; the entire dung-heap upon which infected\r\n      manure has been put, and the fluid contents of the manure\r\n      pit, or of the special receptacle for the urine; yards or\r\n      sheds in which cattle have been kept to tread down long\r\n      straw, and the whole of such straw and manure, as also the\r\n      ground beneath them; paths and roads upon which diseased\r\n      cattle have walked or been carried; fields and meadows upon\r\n      which they have been grazing; all carts, carriages, trucks\r\n      and railway trucks in which diseased cattle have been\r\n      conveyed, and all the platforms, railings, bridges, and\r\n      boards upon which they have been moved thereto; as also all\r\n      apparatus which has been used to pen, tie, lift, haul,\r\n      lower, and fix them; the clothes, and particularly shoes and\r\n      boots, and iron-pointed sticks of drivers and their dogs;\r\n      the apparel of all cattle-herds or attendants, particularly\r\n      their shoes and boots; the shoes and boots of all persons\r\n      visiting places where diseased cattle are or have been\r\n      standing; and, in general, the clothes of all persons\r\n      visiting infected places, ships, and all parts of the\r\n      platforms, stages, stairs and bridges, hoists and cranes\r\n      used for embarking and landing the animals; markets, and all\r\n      sheds, and pens, and implements used in contact with cattle;\r\n      slaughter-houses, and all persons and implements in them\r\n      which have been employed upon sick cattle, as also sundry\r\n      parts or organs which come from sick animals killed in\r\n      slaughter-houses; knackers' yards, trucks or carts, horses,\r\n      men, and implements which have been employed in the disposal\r\n      of sick or dead animals; wells and ponds from which diseased\r\n      cattle have been drinking, or into which any portion of\r\n      their excreta has had any opportunity of flowing, directly\r\n      or indirectly; all fodder, grass, hay, straw, clover, &c.,\r\n      and particularly remnants of fodder upon which diseased\r\n      cattle have been feeding; and, in general, all persons,\r\n      animals, places, buildings, and movable things which have\r\n      been in contact with matters proceeding from diseased\r\n      cattle, or with such diseased cattle themselves. To the\r\n      above-mentioned places and things any of the processes and\r\n      agents enumerated and described in the following may have\r\n      to be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: II.

The ground chosen for such\r\n      interment should be dry. The quickest, and cheapest, and\r\n      most certain way of disinfecting an animal dead from the\r\n      plague is to bury it entire.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 2. Burying of dung.]\r\n\r\n      2. The droppings, and all straw and other matters\r\n      contaminated therewith, may also be buried into ground where\r\n      they are not likely to be disturbed for a long time. The\r\n      places from which such droppings have been removed to be\r\n      cleaned and disinfected as will be described below.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 3. Infected manure and compost heaps.]\r\n\r\n      3. Manure heaps and the down-trodden manure of cattle yards,\r\n      if they have become infected by even a small quantity of the\r\n      droppings of a diseased animal, should be carefully shifted\r\n      to a suitable piece of ground, and there be transformed into\r\n      compost heaps. A layer of manure one or two feet in\r\n      thickness should be covered all over with six inches of dry\r\n      earth, ashes, and mineral rubbish; upon this another layer\r\n      of manure may be placed, and then again a layer of earth,\r\n      and so forth, until the whole of the manure is stacked; it\r\n      should be covered all over with a continuous layer of earth\r\n      of from six inches to one foot in thickness. If the manure\r\n      heap or yard manure cannot be shifted, it may be covered on\r\n      the spot with a layer of dry earth, after which all animals\r\n      are to be kept away from it.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 4.

If the floor of any shed or stable in which diseased\r\n      cattle has been standing is not constructed with special\r\n      water-tight and impenetrable material, it must be assumed to\r\n      be infected to the depth of at least six inches. This ground\r\n      should therefore be removed, together with any stones,\r\n      pavements, or wood work which may have been in contact with\r\n      it, carted to a piece of dry land and buried. Half-rotten\r\n      wood is a particularly favourable carrier of infection.\r\n      Mortar, bricks, loam, or any other lining of the sides of a\r\n      pen in which a diseased animal has been standing, should be\r\n      broken out and buried.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: B.

Burning.]\r\n\r\n      B. _Disinfection by Fire._ 1. _Burning._--All infected\r\n      articles of a minor value, or made of incombustible\r\n      materials, can be disinfected by exposing them to a heat\r\n      which will char organic matter. To this class of articles\r\n      may be reckoned racks of wood or iron; cribs or mangers of\r\n      wood, iron or stone; leather collars and straps, ropes and\r\n      chains; dry manure, residues of fodder from which diseased\r\n      cattle have eaten; and all such small articles of little\r\n      value which can easily be replaced by new ones. Chains may\r\n      be exposed to a dull red heat; all other articles may be\r\n      heated over a fire of coal, brushwood, or straw until well\r\n      scorched. All new articles of ironware should be bought in a\r\n      galvanised state, to prevent the formation of rust, the\r\n      accumulations of which form convenient seats for infectious\r\n      matter, and for the same purpose it is desirable that iron\r\n      articles which have been disinfected by heat as above should\r\n      afterwards be either galvanised, or, at least, while hot be\r\n      treated with resin, to cover them with a durable varnish, or\r\n      should be varnished or painted.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: C. Disinfection by chloride of lime. General\r\n      remarks.]\r\n\r\n      C. _Disinfection by Chloride of Lime._--Chloride of lime, or\r\n      bleaching powder, is the most powerful, the cheapest and\r\n      most easily managed of all artificial disinfectants. It can\r\n      be had everywhere, and at any time, and in quantities\r\n      sufficient for every purpose. It should as much as possible\r\n      he applied in solution, of a strength varying somewhat with\r\n      the particular purpose for which it is to be employed; and\r\n      after it has been allowed to act upon the surface or matter\r\n      to be disinfected a reasonable time, should be washed off,\r\n      together with all products of decomposition. As chloride of\r\n      lime does not destroy only the infectious matter in a\r\n      mixture, but destroys all organic matter without\r\n      distinction, it is not applicable to large quantities of\r\n      matter, such as the manure of cattle, dung-heaps, &c.,\r\n      inasmuch as twice or three times the weight of these matters\r\n      of chloride of lime would be required for their effectual\r\n      destruction and disinfection. It is further inapplicable to\r\n      all matters rich in ammonia, particularly putrid urine, as\r\n      it destroys the ammonia and evolves a large amount of gases,\r\n      some of which have a repugnant odour, and are perhaps not\r\n      quite innocuous. But for the disinfection of surfaces of\r\n      things and places no better or more suitable agent than\r\n      chloride of lime is at present known to science.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: D. Special directions for disinfection of\r\n      stables, sheds, &c., trucks, and ships, &c.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 1. Special directions.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Washing.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Scrubbing.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: All washing water to be disinfected.]\r\n\r\n      D. _Special Directions for the Disinfection of Stables,\r\n      Sheds, Vans, Railway Trucks, and Cattle Ships,[V] and of\r\n      Persons and Things connected with them._--1. After such a\r\n      place has been cleaned by mechanical means, scraping, &c.,\r\n      as much as possible, and all manure and dirt has been\r\n      carefully buried, the entire surface which has been\r\n      contaminated, or is likely to have been contaminated, should\r\n      be covered with a layer of chloride of lime in powder. The\r\n      powder should be worked about with a broom until equally\r\n      distributed. It is intended to disinfect the water to be\r\n      used in the washing process which is now to commence. Clean\r\n      water, from a hose in which it flows under pressure, or from\r\n      a force-pump, garden-engine, or from large watering-pots or\r\n      water-cans, or poured freely from buckets, should now be\r\n      applied to the entire surface by one person, while another\r\n      at the same time scrubs the entire surface; and particularly\r\n      all crevices, joints, and irregularities. The washing water\r\n      and chloride of lime are then to be worked down the gutters,\r\n      into the sinks, cesses, or natural watercourses. No washing\r\n      water from any infected place or thing should ever be\r\n      allowed to flow into any cesspool, urine-hold, dung-heap,\r\n      pond, sewer, or natural watercourse, without having\r\n      previously been mixed and stirred with a liberal amount of\r\n      chloride of lime. When the place has thus been scrubbed\r\n      until the water flows off clean, it is ready for effectual\r\n      disinfection.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 2. Actual disinfection.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Solution of chloride of lime.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: How applied.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: How long to be left on.]\r\n\r\n      2. For this purpose a solution of chloride of lime in water,\r\n      in the proportion of one pound of the powder to one gallon\r\n      of water, is made. For the lair of one animal from six to\r\n      ten gallons of such fluid should be prepared. This fluid is\r\n      now distributed over the whole surface to be disinfected,\r\n      gradually, by squirting from a syringe, or by pumping\r\n      through a force-pump, garden-engine, or by watering from a\r\n      watering-pot or can with a finely pierced rose. All\r\n      woodwork, stones, bricks, cement, mortar, all fixtures of\r\n      whatever material, should be well wetted with the solution,\r\n      and immediately be scrubbed with a hard brush. Floor and\r\n      ceiling are also scrubbed, and the whole is left in this wet\r\n      state covered with the chloride of lime solution for at\r\n      least one hour, during which time care is taken that no\r\n      parts become dry.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 3.

As the chloride of lime and the products of its\r\n      decomposing action upon infectious matters may be hurtful to\r\n      cattle, these matters have to be carefully washed off by a\r\n      second and final flushing. For this too much water and too\r\n      much scrubbing cannot be employed. Care should be taken to\r\n      apply the clean water always to the highest parts, so as to\r\n      cause it to flow thence to the lower parts, and to wash away\r\n      the waste from the lower parts before applying any fresh\r\n      water to the upper parts.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 4. Care not to carry back dirt by brooms, boots,\r\n      &c.]\r\n\r\n      4. Care should also be taken to rinse and flush every broom\r\n      which has worked away sediment and waste from the lower\r\n      parts into and through the gutters and drains before\r\n      applying it again to the clean upper parts. Care should also\r\n      be taken that the working persons should not step from the\r\n      dirty or partially cleansed places on to the clean ones, as\r\n      this may suffice to bring infection back to the disinfected\r\n      place.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 5. Disinfection of workmen and tools.]\r\n\r\n      5. Lastly, all persons employed in this work, having swept\r\n      and flushed the gutters with the same care as the lairs, are\r\n      collected, together with all engines and tools which they\r\n      have used, as near as possible to the sink or place of final\r\n      egress of water from the premises, and there disinfected as\r\n      will be described.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Tools.]\r\n\r\n      The tools, such as hooks, forks, spades, hoes, barrows, &c.,\r\n      are scrubbed with the above solution of chloride of lime,\r\n      and subsequently water until clean; they are then\r\n      repeatedly wetted with the solution, and after it has had\r\n      time to disinfect the entire surfaces of them, they are\r\n      washed clean and laid up, or hung up to dry.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Workmen.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Disinfection of boots.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Disinfection of workpeople's bodies, hands, &c.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Changing and disinfecting clothes.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Burning of articles of little value.]\r\n\r\n      The workmen, then, having finished the disinfection and\r\n      flushing of all objects and surfaces, effect their own\r\n      disinfection in the following manner:--They wash their boots\r\n      most carefully with chloride of lime and water, scraping the\r\n      soles and scrubbing the seams where the soles join the upper\r\n      leather. They wash their hands and arms, and by means of\r\n      clean rags or sponges they remove any splashes from their\r\n      clothes. After this they go indoors, remove all clothes from\r\n      head to foot, wash their bodies, and particularly their\r\n      hands, faces, hair and feet, with plenty of soap and water,\r\n      and put on fresh clothes and linen. The clothes and linen\r\n      which they have taken off should be treated as infected, set\r\n      to soak immediately in boiling water and afterwards\r\n      disinfected, or in water containing two ounces of chloride\r\n      of lime to the gallon in solution, or containing four ounces\r\n      of Condy's red permanganate of potash fluid in solution; or\r\n      the clothes and linen should be put in a copper and boiled\r\n      and subsequently washed. All articles of little value which\r\n      are much soiled should be burned on a bright fire.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: E. Disinfection of live stock.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 1. Stock may carry infection in two modes.]\r\n\r\n      E. _Disinfection of Live Stock._--1. Live cattle may carry\r\n      infection in two ways: first, by being themselves infected\r\n      with the plague and reproducing the poison; and secondly, by\r\n      accidentally carrying the poison from other animals in a\r\n      dormant state upon some part of their surface, their hair,\r\n      and particularly their feet. These latter animals may\r\n      therefore infect others without being or becoming themselves\r\n      subjects of the plague. All persons therefore buying new\r\n      animals, should disinfect them before allowing them to enter\r\n      their premises. In a similar manner, if in a stable there\r\n      has been a case of plague, the healthy or apparently healthy\r\n      animals should all be disinfected.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 2. Mode and means of disinfecting live stock.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Warming and refreshing drink.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Penned in the quarantine shed.]\r\n\r\n      2. The mode in which live animals may be disinfected,\r\n      consists in washing them with disinfectant solutions of such\r\n      strength as will destroy the contagion without injuring the\r\n      surface of the animal. A solution of two ounces of chloride\r\n      of lime in a gallon of water, is a proper solution for\r\n      washing the coat of animals. A mixture of four ounces of\r\n      Condy's red permanganate of potash fluid, with one gallon of\r\n      water, is also a proper disinfectant solution. For\r\n      full-sized cows and bullocks, &c., several gallons of either\r\n      of these solutions should be used. Great care should be\r\n      taken to keep the solution away from the eyes, nostrils,\r\n      mouth, and tender parts. When the entire surface is washed\r\n      and disinfected, all disinfectant is removed by the\r\n      application of great quantities of clean tepid water to all\r\n      parts. The animal is given a warming and refreshing drink,\r\n      and is conducted by a clean attendant to the clean\r\n      quarantine shed. There it should receive fodder both dry and\r\n      green, and sop, and plenty of pure cold water, and be rubbed\r\n      dry with whisks of straw and hay.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: F. The quarantine shed.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 1. Objects.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Both quarantine and surface disinfection are\r\n      required.]\r\n\r\n      F. _The Quarantine Shed._--1. The quarantine shed is\r\n      intended to keep the new and suspected cattle separate for a\r\n      period of at least ten days, in order to afford the\r\n      security, to be obtained by observation alone, that it is\r\n      not actually infected with plague. While, therefore,\r\n      disinfection of the surface of cattle removes one kind of\r\n      danger, another, which cannot be removed, can only be kept\r\n      circumscribed or penned in, and this is done by the\r\n      quarantine shed. But the keeping of cattle in the quarantine\r\n      shed would not disinfect its surface with certainty even\r\n      during a much longer period than ten days; disinfection of\r\n      the surface therefore cannot supply the precaution of the\r\n      quarantine shed, and a rigorous quarantine cannot supply the\r\n      effect of surface disinfection. Both precautions are\r\n      necessary for perfect security, although either of them,\r\n      without the other, obviates a particular kind and a certain\r\n      amount of danger.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 2. Management of the quarantine shed.]\r\n\r\n      2. The quarantine shed should be situated in an isolated\r\n      part of the premises. All manure and urine from it should\r\n      flow and be carried to a particular place separate and\r\n      distinct from the common dung-heap, and be buried daily.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Cleanliness.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Persons attending healthy stock not to attend\r\n      quarantine shed, and vice versâ.]\r\n\r\n      The utmost cleanliness should be observed in the shed. All\r\n      tools, pails, currycombs, etc., used in this shed should be\r\n      used in it exclusively and nowhere else. The person\r\n      attending the quarantine shed should not be allowed to go\r\n      into the shed where healthy stock is kept, or permitted to\r\n      approach healthy stock. No person attending healthy stock\r\n      should be permitted to approach quarantine cattle, or to go\r\n      near or into the quarantine shed. But should unfortunately\r\n      only one person be available for both duties, that person\r\n      should be allowed to approach quarantine cattle only when\r\n      clothed in the safety dress to be immediately described.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: G. The safety dress.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 1. Description.]\r\n\r\n      G. _The Safety Dress._--1. This consists of strong\r\n      water-boots reaching up to the knees, well greased all over;\r\n      of a waterproof coat, buttoned close all the way up in\r\n      front, and closing tightly round the neck and wrists. The\r\n      head is to be covered with a cap which takes the hair well\r\n      in.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 2. Persons who should use the safety dress.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: To disinfect before leaving suspected or infected\r\n      premises.]\r\n\r\n      2. Every person having occasion to visit sheds in which\r\n      there is diseased cattle, or suspected cattle, or quarantine\r\n      cattle, should be provided with the above dress, put it on\r\n      when entering the place, take it off when leaving the place,\r\n      and have it disinfected immediately. This precaution should\r\n      be strictly observed by all inspectors, all veterinarians,\r\n      or others called in to attend sick cattle, by all dealers\r\n      and butchers entering sheds, yards, or meadows, for the\r\n      purpose of sale or purchase, and by all other persons coming\r\n      on the premises on business in connexion with cattle.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 3. Strangers not to enter sheds except in\r\n      disinfected safety dresses.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Proprietors of cattle to keep safety dresses.]\r\n\r\n      3. The owners of stock should not allow any strangers to\r\n      enter their sheds, yards, or meadows, except in disinfected\r\n      safety-dresses; and in case this should give rise to\r\n      difficulties, they will do well to have themselves one or\r\n      two such safety-dresses at hand, and to cause all persons\r\n      whose business compels them to enter their sheds, to leave\r\n      their own boots behind, and to put on the long boots,\r\n      waterproof-coat, and special cap. Only thus can they hope to\r\n      exclude all ordinary and obvious chances of infection from\r\n      their previously healthy sheds, yards, and meadows.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: H. Measures to be taken where plague has\r\n      appeared.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Killing and burying diseased animals.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Disinfecting the living and the stables.]\r\n\r\n      H. _Measures to be taken on Premises where Plague has\r\n      actually appeared._--1. When the plague has actually\r\n      appeared in any shed, yard, or place, the sick animal should\r\n      at once be removed with all due precautions. It is certainly\r\n      the safest and best to pole-axe the animal at once, and to\r\n      bury it entire, and then to disinfect the particular lair as\r\n      above described, clear out the stable or shed, disinfect\r\n      the whole of it and all apparatus, also all the animals, and\r\n      only to let the animals enter the shed, &c. again, after it\r\n      is completely sweet and dry.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 2. Hospital shed.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Situation of.]\r\n\r\n      2. If, however, a proprietor is desirous of keeping a sick\r\n      animal because its illness does not appear severe or fatal,\r\n      he should place it in a separate shed, which must not be the\r\n      same as or near to the quarantine shed, and be distant from\r\n      all healthy animals, and so situated that the prevailing\r\n      wind does not blow from this hospital shed towards the\r\n      healthy or quarantine shed. The water should also not flow\r\n      from this hospital shed towards the others, or the yard, or\r\n      any meadow, but should be carefully drained away and sent\r\n      off the premises by a special sink.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 3. Preventing of diffusion of fæces.]\r\n\r\n      3. To prevent the scattering of fæces by infected animals\r\n      (and also by suspected animals and all animals suffering\r\n      from diarrhoea), their tails should be so tied to one or\r\n      other of their horns as to protect them against being soiled\r\n      by the intestinal discharges, and to prevent them from\r\n      distributing such discharges by the ceaseless motions\r\n      peculiar to these organs. The spattering of fæces should be\r\n      prevented by a copious supply of rough straw, with some\r\n      sand, sawdust, or ashes placed behind and underneath the\r\n      animal. The straw and fæces should be dealt with as has been\r\n      described. Animals affected with plague or diarrhoea should\r\n      not be led along streets, highroads, and paths, as they\r\n      would be certain to drop infectious fæces, which would then\r\n      be distributed over the entire length of these roads by the\r\n      feet of men and animals, and the wheels of vehicles.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 4. Special management of hospital shed.]\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Persons to be employed.]\r\n\r\n      4. The sick animals should be disinfected repeatedly; their\r\n      pens should be cleaned and disinfected repeatedly, during\r\n      the course of the illness. This should be done by persons\r\n      either guarded by the safety dress, or--and this is\r\n      safest--by such as may not come into contact with healthy\r\n      cattle, or have to enter healthy sheds. All tools, pails,\r\n      fodder, &c., to be used in the hospital shed to be kept for\r\n      that purpose only, and never to be used with healthy, or\r\n      quarantine, or only suspected cattle.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 5. Disinfection of parts of dead or killed\r\n      animals.]\r\n\r\n      5. If the proprietor of any dead piece of cattle, whether it\r\n      has died naturally or been killed, should decide upon\r\n      dismembering it instead of burying it entire, and upon\r\n      utilising the hide, horns, hoofs, tallow, and bones, he\r\n      should disinfect the skin, horns, and hoofs, by steeping\r\n      them for one hour in a strong solution of chloride of lime,\r\n      containing one pound of the powder in each gallon of water,\r\n      and afterwards washing them. The tallow should be thickly\r\n      powdered with chloride of lime all over, and be sent\r\n      directly to the boilers. It should not be boiled in any\r\n      vessel employed on the farm. Under all circumstances, it is\r\n      advisable to let this dismemberment of dead and fallen\r\n      cattle he performed at the knacker's yard.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 6.

The grass on the entire\r\n      meadow should then be cut and burned.

They should be kept clean and\r\n      disinfected, as a precautionary measure, by the proceedings\r\n      above described.\r\n\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: III.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS.\r\n\r\n      In conclusion it must be pointed out to farmers, dairymen,\r\n      and all persons having charge of cattle,\r\n\r\n      _That the same great measures which are known to maintain\r\n      and restore the health of human beings, will also maintain\r\n      and restore the health of cattle._\r\n\r\n      Pure air; dry, spacious, well-ventilated and well-drained\r\n      clean sheds; clean and dry meadows; plenty of pure water;\r\n      frequent currying and washing; the prevention of the\r\n      development, by the destruction of the germs, of internal\r\n      and external parasites, particularly entozoa; proper food in\r\n      suitable quantities, and at proper times; protection from\r\n      inclement weather; the utmost cleanliness in the removal of\r\n      manure; the storing of the manure at a great distance from\r\n      the cattle-shed, and, in addition, the most conscientious\r\n      observance of the precautionary and disinfecting measures\r\n      above described--all these measures and agents together\r\n      will secure the utmost possible health of stock and the\r\n      prosperity of the agriculturist and dairyman. But the\r\n      neglect of any one of them will make the stock liable to\r\n      become infected, and the more so the more several or all\r\n      collateral conditions of the healthy existence of animals\r\n      are neglected. The negligent man is therefore certain to\r\n      lose, to injure his neighbour by defeating his precautions,\r\n      and to damage society; but the watchful and painstaking man\r\n      will be rewarded not only by the preservation of his\r\n      property, but particularly by the consciousness that it has\r\n      been preserved by his own care and attention, and that\r\n      thereby he has also benefited the state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis consolidates and amends the former Orders.\r\n\r\n      (_Copy._)\r\n\r\n      At the _Council Chamber, Whitehall_, the 22nd day of\r\n      _September_, 1865.\r\n\r\n      By the Lords of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council.\r\n\r\n        PRESENT.\r\n\r\n        Lord President.\r\n        Duke of Somerset.\r\n        Earl of Clarendon.\r\n        Earl de Grey and Ripon.\r\n        Mr. Secretary Cardwell.\r\n        Mr. H.

This Order shall extend to all parts of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      2. The said Orders dated respectively the 24th of July, the\r\n      11th, 18th, and 26th of August, 1865, are revoked, with the\r\n      exception of so much of the said Order of the 24th of July,\r\n      1865, as empowers the Clerk of Her Majesty's Privy Council\r\n      to appoint Inspectors within the limits of the Metropolitan\r\n      Police District, provided that such revocation shall not\r\n      affect any appointment made, or any act done, or penalty\r\n      recoverable, under any Order hereby revoked.\r\n\r\n      3. In this Order the word \"animal\" shall mean any cow,\r\n      heifer, bull, bullock, ox, calf, sheep, lamb, goat, or\r\n      swine; and the word \"Inspector\" shall include any Inspector\r\n      appointed under this Order, or under any of the said revoked\r\n      Orders.\r\n\r\n      4. Whenever the Local Authority, as hereinafter defined,\r\n      shall be satisfied of the existence of the said disorder in,\r\n      or have reason to apprehend its approach to, the district\r\n      over which his or their jurisdiction extends, it shall be\r\n      lawful for such Local Authority, if he or they shall think\r\n      fit, from time to time to appoint one or more Veterinary\r\n      Surgeon or Surgeons, or other duly qualified person or\r\n      persons, to be an Inspector or Inspectors, for the purpose\r\n      of carrying into effect the rules and regulations made by\r\n      this Order, within the district for which he or they shall\r\n      have been appointed. And the same authority may, from time\r\n      to time, revoke such appointment.\r\n\r\n      5. Subject to the powers herein reserved to the Clerk of Her\r\n      Majesty's Privy Council, the Local Authority within the City\r\n      of London, and the liberties thereof, shall be the Lord\r\n      Mayor; in any municipal borough in England or Wales, the\r\n      Mayor; in any Petty Sessional Division in England or Wales\r\n      (exclusive so far as relates to the jurisdiction of the\r\n      Inspector of so much of the said division as lies, within\r\n      the limits of a municipal borough for which an Inspector has\r\n      been appointed), the Justices acting in and for such Petty\r\n      Sessional Division. The Local Authority in any burgh or town\r\n      in Scotland which is subject to the jurisdiction of a\r\n      Provost or other Principal Magistrate, shall be the Provost\r\n      or such Principal Magistrate; and in any other place in\r\n      Scotland not within the jurisdiction of such Provost or\r\n      other Principal Magistrate, the Justices of the County in\r\n      Sessions assembled.\r\n\r\n      6. Every Inspector shall from time to time report to the\r\n      Local Authority by which he is appointed, the steps taken by\r\n      him for carrying into effect the regulations prescribed by\r\n      this Order; and the Local Authority shall certify, in such\r\n      manner as may be directed by one of Her Majesty's Principal\r\n      Secretaries of State, the number of days that such Inspector\r\n      has actually been engaged in the performance of his duty,\r\n      and the number of miles travelled by him while thus engaged.\r\n\r\n      7. Every Inspector shall furnish the Lords of the Council\r\n      with such information in regard to the said disorder, as\r\n      their Lordships may, from time to time, require.\r\n\r\n      8. Every person having in his possession, or under his\r\n      custody, any animal labouring under the said disorder, shall\r\n      forthwith give notice thereof to the Inspector of the\r\n      district within which such person resides, or if no\r\n      Inspector shall have been appointed for the district within\r\n      which such person resides, then to the Officers hereinafter\r\n      named, according to the place of residence of the person\r\n      obliged to give notice; that is to say: within the\r\n      Metropolitan Police District, to the said Clerk of the Privy\r\n      Council; within the City of London, and the liberties\r\n      thereof, to the Lord Mayor; within any other borough, burgh,\r\n      or town subject to the jurisdiction of a Mayor, Provost, or\r\n      other Principal Magistrate, to such Mayor, Provost, or other\r\n      Principal Magistrate; elsewhere in England, to the Clerk of\r\n      the Justices acting in and for the Petty Sessional Division;\r\n      and elsewhere in Scotland, to the Clerk of the Peace of the\r\n      county.\r\n\r\n      9. Every Inspector shalt have power to enter upon and\r\n      inspect any premises or place in which any animal or animals\r\n      may be found within the district for which he is appointed,\r\n      and to examine and inspect, whenever and wherever he may\r\n      deem it necessary, any animal within such district.\r\n\r\n      10. Every Inspector shall have power within his district to\r\n      seize and slaughter, or cause to be seized and slaughtered,\r\n      and to be buried, as hereinafter directed, in any convenient\r\n      place, any animal labouring under the said disorder.\r\n\r\n      11. Every Inspector shall have power within his district to\r\n      cause to be cleansed and disinfected, in any manner which he\r\n      may think proper, any premises in which animals labouring\r\n      under the said disorder have been, or may be, and to cause\r\n      to be disinfected, and if necessary destroyed, any fodder,\r\n      manure, or refuse matter, which he may deem likely to\r\n      propagate the said disorder. And every owner or occupier of\r\n      such premises shall obey any order given by such Inspector\r\n      for that purpose.\r\n\r\n      12. Every Inspector shall have power within his district to\r\n      direct that any animal which he suspects to be labouring\r\n      under the said disorder, shall be kept separate from animals\r\n      free from the said disorder. And every person having in his\r\n      possession, or under his custody, such animal, shall obey\r\n      any order given by such Inspector for that purpose.\r\n\r\n      13. Every person having in his possession, or under his\r\n      custody, any animal labouring under the said disorder,\r\n      shall, as far as practicable, keep such animal separate from\r\n      all other animals, and shall not, if the animal be within a\r\n      district for which an Inspector has been appointed, remove\r\n      the same from his land or premises, without the licence of\r\n      the Inspector.\r\n\r\n      14. No person shall send or bring to any fair or market, or\r\n      expose for sale, or send or carry by any railway, or by any\r\n      ship or vessel coastwise, or place upon, or drive along, any\r\n      highway or the sides thereof; any animal labouring under the\r\n      said disorder.\r\n\r\n      15. No person in any district for which an Inspector has\r\n      been appointed shall, without the licence of the Inspector,\r\n      send or bring to or from market, or remove from his land or\r\n      premises, any animal which has been in the same shed or\r\n      stable, or has been in the same herd or flock, or has been\r\n      in contact, with any animal labouring under the said\r\n      disorder.\r\n\r\n      16. No person shall place, or keep, any animal labouring\r\n      under the said disorder in any common or unenclosed land,\r\n      or, if the animal be in a district for which an Inspector\r\n      has been appointed, in any field or pasture, where, in the\r\n      judgment of the Inspector, such animal may be likely to\r\n      propagate the said disorder.\r\n\r\n      17. All animals having died of the said disorder, or having\r\n      been slaughtered on account thereof; shall be buried with\r\n      their skins, and with a sufficient quantity of quick-lime,\r\n      or other disinfectant, as soon as practicable, and shall be\r\n      covered with at least five feet of earth, or shall, in\r\n      districts for which an Inspector has been appointed, with\r\n      the consent of the owner, be otherwise disposed of; in\r\n      manner directed by the Inspector.\r\n\r\n      18. During the continuance of the \"cattle plague\" within\r\n      the said City of London, or that part of the Metropolitan\r\n      Police District which is under the jurisdiction of the\r\n      Metropolitan Board of Works, no animal shall be brought or\r\n      sent to the Metropolitan Cattle Market, or any other market\r\n      within the said City or the said part of the Metropolitan\r\n      Police District, except for the purpose of being there sold\r\n      for immediate slaughtering; and every such animal, as soon\r\n      as sold, shall be marked for slaughter, in the manner in\r\n      which cattle are ordinarily marked for slaughter in the\r\n      Metropolitan Cattle Market.\r\n\r\n      19. Whenever any Local Authority, as hereinbefore defined,\r\n      declares, by notice published in any newspaper circulating\r\n      within his or their jurisdiction, that it is expedient that\r\n      animals, as hereinbefore defined, or some specified\r\n      description thereof, shall be excluded from any specified\r\n      market or fair within that jurisdiction, for a time to be\r\n      specified in such notice, it is hereby ordered, that after\r\n      the publication of such notice, it shall not be lawful for\r\n      any person to bring or send such animals or description\r\n      thereof into such market or fair: provided always, that this\r\n      clause of this Order shall not, unless renewed by a further\r\n      Order, be in force after the expiration of three calendar\r\n      months from the date of this Order.\r\n\r\n      20. Every person offending against this Order shall, in\r\n      pursuance of the said Act, for every such offence forfeit\r\n      any sum not exceeding twenty pounds which the Justices\r\n      before whom he or she shall be convicted of such offence may\r\n      think fit to impose.\r\n\r\n             (Signed)             ARTHUR HELPS.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[R] Since these lines were put into the printer's hands, the French\r\nGovernment have proposed to other nations to take measures collectively\r\nto prevent the pilgrimage to Mecca continuing to be a cause of the\r\nspread of cholera. We hasten to render justice to this prudent\r\ninitiative. But why not take the same measures against typhus which are\r\njudged necessary against cholera?\r\n\r\n[S] The typhus which broke out fifteen days ago near Roubaix, in France,\r\nbordering upon Belgium, where the epizootia rages, appears to have been\r\nstifled in its focus by the instantaneous extermination of the whole\r\nherd in which it declared itself.\r\n\r\n[T] \"It is amusing to read authors of the last century on the treatment\r\nof this disease. They were far more confident in their powers than we\r\nhelpless creatures pretend to be. The directions given are full and\r\ndistinct, and in chapters boldly headed 'The Cure.' The beast is to be\r\nbled, washed, and hot vinegar and water, with aromatic herbs, may be\r\nplaced in the stable to revive the cattle. The animal must be rubbed a\r\nquarter of an hour, both morning and evening, and the bags of a milch\r\ncow should be anointed morning and evening with warm oil. A rowel is to\r\nbe made in the dewlap by taking a skein of hemp, tow, or twisted\r\npackthread, a foot long, and as thick as a man's thumb. _The\r\nprescriptions are most amusing._ They may serve to entertain those who\r\nwant the cure at present, and for this reason I reproduce one or\r\ntwo.\"--_Gamgee, Letter on 21st August._\r\n\r\n[U] Dr. Letheby reported that 12,916 lbs., or more than five tons of\r\nmeat, had been condemned in the City markets during the past week as\r\nunfit for human food. It consisted of 64 sheep, 4 calves, 7 pigs, 142\r\nquarters of beef, and 361 joints and pieces of meat; 5377 lbs. were\r\ndiseased or from animals that had died of disease, and the rest was\r\nputrid. All of it was destroyed. Yesterday, a sub-committee of the\r\nMetropolitan Plague Committee, at a meeting at the Mansion House, passed\r\nan unanimous resolution, on the motion of Mr. Brewster, recommending\r\nthat, as unexpected and insuperable difficulties had arisen in carrying\r\nout the purposes for which they were appointed, the money already\r\nsubscribed should be returned to the subscribers, after deducting, _pro\r\nratâ_, the expenses already incurred.\r\n\r\n[V] For the disinfection of railway trucks and cattle ships, see Special\r\nMemorandum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD PART.\r\n\r\n_To Farmers and Graziers._\r\n\r\n\r\nYou would have had just cause to reproach me with a want of common sense\r\nif I had obliged you to read a book of two hundred pages, and to lose\r\nyour time in looking for the advice you will require, if the cattle\r\nplague should visit your stalls and herds, instead of being able to turn\r\nat once to the matter which concerns you. I have taken up my pen on\r\npurpose to be of service to you; this is my principal duty, which I am\r\nnow going to fulfil by summing up in a few pages the most important\r\nfacts which have been described in the two first parts of this work.\r\n\r\nThe cattle plague, which has lately fallen upon horned beasts, is a\r\nplague, no doubt: but there are different species of plagues, and it is\r\nnecessary that you should know that this disease is one arising from\r\nthe absorption of seeds and germs with which the air is impregnated, and\r\nwhich is drawn by the animals into their bodies when breathing the air\r\naround them. When these germs, these infectious poisons, have penetrated\r\ninto the lungs and blood of the animals, these seeds of infection remain\r\nthere from eight to twelve days without producing any very perceptible\r\neffects; but after that time the tainted animal becomes dejected, loses\r\nhis appetite, is seized with fever, laborious breathing, and\r\ndiarrhoea, to which sum of disorders in the health of oxen, cows, &c.,\r\nthe name of _typhus_ has been given; or, as this distemper is contagious\r\nin the highest degree, it has also been called the _contagious typhus_.\r\n\r\nYou may compare this disease, in order to form a more precise idea of\r\nit, to the small-pox, which sometimes afflicts your children, or to\r\ntyphoid fever. These complaints, which are familiar to most of you, have\r\nsome resemblance to the typhus of the ox. Only in the small-pox, which\r\nis caught by contagion, and which seldom attacks more than once, like\r\ntyphus, the disease is localized on the skin; whilst in the cattle\r\nplague the internal organs are the principal seat of the evil.\r\n\r\nThis comparison will show you at once that the cattle plague, or rather\r\nthe cattle typhus, can only be cured when the disease has run its full\r\ncourse, as you have observed in a person tainted with small-pox; so that\r\nyour task must be to help the sick animal to endure his complaint until\r\nthe end, or until he is cured; and you must not attempt to check it by\r\nviolent means, for if you did you would hasten the death which you\r\ndesire to prevent. You will likewise understand that if the disease--as\r\nis certainly the case--does not attack the same animal twice, it would\r\nbe very beneficial to inoculate the animal whilst he is sound and\r\nhealthy, whenever this scourge threatens--as in the present time--to\r\nattack all cattle. Perhaps you may be told that inoculation, which\r\nprevents small-pox in man, cannot be applicable to cattle; that animals\r\ninoculated with the virus of the typhus have all died of the\r\nconsequences of the operation, and so on. To all these objections you\r\nwill answer, with that downright good sense which belongs to your class,\r\n_that Nature cannot have two weights and two measures_; and that if the\r\ninoculation of the typhus kills animals, whilst the inoculation of the\r\nsmall-pox saves men, both maladies being governed by the same laws, it\r\nis the inexperience of physicians, and not the operation itself, which\r\nmust be made to account for it.\r\n\r\nIn a word, to sow virus is to reap it; but there are many ways of sowing\r\nit, and one man will reap a rich harvest, whilst another shall gather\r\nnothing but tares. Let those unbelievers say what they like, and take my\r\nword for it, that we shall one day cure typhus as frequently as we do\r\nsmall-pox, by inoculating it, and when it appears in spite of that\r\ncourse, by treating it medicinally.\r\n\r\nThis contagious disease is very frequent in certain countries,\r\nprincipally in Russia and Hungary, on the banks of the great rivers\r\nwhich empty themselves into the Black Sea. In those remote countries,\r\nwhen the seasons are either too rainy or too hot--and you know what a\r\nsummer that of 1865 has been--the pastures generate the pestilential\r\npoisons of the typhus, the cattle absorb these destructive principles,\r\nand die of them.\r\n\r\nBut as the herds of cattle in those countries are bred for sale, and are\r\nsent for that purpose to other countries, to France, Italy, England,\r\n&c., the animals which have had the germ of the disease transport it\r\nwith them wherever they go. Thus, it is certain that some oxen conveyed\r\nfrom Russia and Hungary, where the typhus frequently rages, brought the\r\ndisease with them into Great Britain in the month of last June; and as\r\nthe complaint is communicated from one animal to another, and afterwards\r\nat great distances, it spread with great rapidity over England and\r\nScotland. So great are its powers of contagion, that some of the cattle\r\nsent back from England have transmitted the disease to Holland, in the\r\nfirst place, and afterwards to Belgium; and it was feared at one time\r\nthat all Europe would be invaded by it.\r\n\r\nThe first belief was--and everything tends to make good the\r\nopinion--that the typhus originally came from abroad; but many\r\nrespectable authorities, seeing the foul and nauseous state of the\r\nstalls and cowsheds both in London and elsewhere, the overcrowding of\r\nthe animals, and the general neglect to which they are exposed, have\r\nasserted that the disease had its origin in London. This, we repeat, is\r\nnot likely to have been the case, but it is not absolutely impossible;\r\nat all events, there can be no question that the grievous conditions in\r\nwhich some of your brethren keep their cattle have contributed to spread\r\nthe distemper, independently of other causes.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is necessary to tell you, that sheep and horned cattle are\r\nof all living animals those which are most sensitive to the influence of\r\ncontagious diseases. Every year you see instances of this fact in your\r\nown fields and meadows. Your sheep, you all know, easily contract the\r\nsmall-pox, worm diseases both on the skin and in the interior of the\r\nbody; your oxen have aphthous diseases, disorders of the blood and the\r\nlungs, scabs and carbuncles--diseases which are all more or less\r\ncontagious, and which are generally brought on by want of care, and,\r\nabove all, by improper feeding: by which you see how much of the\r\nsufferings of the cattle, and of the heavy losses to you which follow\r\nthem, depends upon yourselves and may be avoided. Besides, these poor\r\ncreatures, which some of you treat so harshly, are extremely\r\nsusceptible, and the blows they receive may easily affect their whole\r\nmass of blood. You must, therefore, for your own sakes, treat them more\r\nkindly and gently.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the typhus which was imported from Russia into England,\r\nfinding your cattle in such wretched conditions of cleanliness and\r\nhealth, was propagated amongst them with fearful rapidity. When once the\r\ndisease had developed itself within your sheds and stalls, it would have\r\nbeen the wisest plan immediately to kill the sick cattle, or to treat\r\nthem medicinally, carefully abstaining from driving to market any of\r\nyour beasts which had been exposed to the contagion. But unfortunately\r\nyou did not act in this manner; many amongst you could not put up\r\npatiently with your losses, and only consulting your private interest,\r\nto the detriment of the general good, you sold your sick cows and oxen,\r\nand sowing the contagion about the country and through the markets, the\r\nscourge was soon scattered in every direction, so that instead of\r\nstifling the disease at its birth everything was done to propagate and\r\ndiffuse it.\r\n\r\nNow, if we add, that the germs of this typhus penetrate everywhere, that\r\nit is sufficient to convey sick cattle along the public roads, and by\r\nthis means to pass near farms and meadows containing healthy cattle, to\r\ntransmit the contagion, that these noxious germs impregnate your own\r\nclothes, the fleece of sheep, and every article, implement, and vehicle\r\nused in agriculture, you cannot but see how often, though unwillingly,\r\nyou must have disseminated the evil far and wide.\r\n\r\nThe germs, the miasmata of the disease, insinuate themselves not only\r\nupon animals and men, but they shed their virus upon the grass of the\r\nfields, the walls of the stalls and stables, and every agricultural\r\nutensil. Every tainted animal scatters the pestilential and contagious\r\ngerms, not only by the air he expires, but by his droppings, and after\r\ndeath by his mortal remains--his hide, his horns, his entrails, his\r\nflesh--all of which disseminate the deadly germs into the atmosphere,\r\nwhich afterwards diffuses them in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe germs of this virulent distemper have no doubt smitten some cattle\r\nwhich appeared in the best health and conditions, those of the rich as\r\nwell as those of the poor; but, just in the same manner as the cholera\r\nchiefly fixes itself upon the sickly, the ill-fed, the unclean, upon\r\nthose who live in crowded dwellings and badly ventilated rooms; so, too,\r\ndoes the typhus choose its victims among the stalls and stables of those\r\ngraziers who keep their cows tied up for years to the rack, giving them\r\nneither air nor exercise, and feeding them, not on that diet which their\r\nhealth requires, but on those things which add to their milk and\r\nincrease their flesh. It follows, of course, that the greater number of\r\nthese cows, more or less disordered by this long course of baleful\r\ntreatment, and many of which die of consumption, after their\r\ndeteriorated milk has infused into men the seeds of diseases, must\r\nafford an easy prey to the typhus, _to receive which they seem almost\r\nexpressly to have been trained_.\r\n\r\nIt is highly important then, farmers and graziers, that you should be\r\nable to recognise this ox-typhus; in the first place, that you may take\r\nthe necessary measures to prevent its contagion; and secondly, that you\r\nmay apply the treatment which shall have been recommended to you.\r\n\r\nYou must at all times, but above all when the contagious disease is\r\nraging, keep a watchful eye on your cattle. If you notice in their gait,\r\nin their looks, about their ears, any unusual signs; if they seem to you\r\nless eager, less active, less vigilant, if they leave any part of their\r\nrations when in the stables, or if, when in the fields, they no longer\r\nbrowse with that continual alacrity which sometimes it is difficult to\r\ndivert them from, be upon your guard, and dread the outbreak of the\r\ncomplaint. If to these changes of minor importance is added an appetite\r\nreally less acute, if the rumination is less regular, if the animal\r\nlooks sad and dispirited, if he exhibits an unwonted look of gloom, if\r\nhis leaden eye continues fixed, astonished, be sure a morbid change is\r\ninwardly at work, and that this cruel distemper is spreading through his\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nBy-and-bye the animal loses his appetite more and more; rumination is\r\nshorter and less frequent; he holds his head down, his ears sink and\r\nfall; he grinds his teeth. Then as to the cows: their milk, which was\r\nalready diminished, suddenly dries up altogether, and that lowness of\r\nspirits which had been visible for some days before, passes into stupor.\r\nIf at this time you touch their horns, their extremities, their hide in\r\nany part, you find that all these different parts are sometimes warm,\r\nsometimes cold. From this day forward you will witness, one by one, a\r\nsuccession of disorders in the animal's health: partial shiverings at\r\nthe attachment of the fore and hind limbs, loud panting breathing, with\r\nslight cough, the urine scanty and thick, the droppings hard and\r\nconstipated, and finally, general excessive warmth. If you press the\r\nback the pressure will be painful, and all the signs of intense fever\r\nwill be manifest.\r\n\r\nAlready these indications have divulged the nature of the malady you\r\nhave to deal with; but others more significant succeed them which remove\r\nevery doubt. The breathing becomes more hurried and oppressed, more\r\npuffy; from the eyes, nostrils, and mouth there issues a discharge\r\nwhich, thin and irritant at first, soon becomes thick and purulent, and\r\nof a fetid smell. Diarrhoea takes the place of constipation; the\r\nsexual organs of the cow are red and inflamed, and furrowed with livid\r\nstreaks. The cattle grow leaner and leaner, some of them dying at this\r\nperiod. If they still hold out, the diarrhoea becomes more frequent,\r\nmore fetid, and sometimes bloody; gases are developed under the skin,\r\nalong the spine, where they form wide flat tumours, which crackle when\r\npressed upon with the fingers. Finally, the mucus which runs from the\r\nhead becomes still thicker and more fetid; a glutinous foam stops up the\r\nmouth; the eyes, filled with humour, sink in the orbit; the bodily\r\nwarmth decreases, the animal sways his head from right to left, becomes\r\ninsensible, cold; his head lolls on one side, and he dies, panting, from\r\nexhaustion and asphyxia, the tenth or twelfth day after the disease has\r\nbeen confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe carcass exhibits a repulsive appearance; the hide is dry,\r\nexcoriated, and cracked; it sticks to the bones, which show the form of\r\na skeleton, and the putrid decomposition, which had already set in\r\nbefore death, seizes rapidly on all the tissues.\r\n\r\nThe course of the disease is not always the same. Sometimes the animal\r\nis agitated at first, and all the functions of life are so disturbed\r\nthat death comes on in the two or three first days. At other times, the\r\nlungs are more affected than the other internal organs; the cough is\r\nmore intense, the breath hurried and obstructed, the excess of mucus\r\npreventing the air from passing into the chest.\r\n\r\nWhen once you have seen this disease it is impossible to mistake it for\r\nany other, unless it be the chest complaint called peripneumonia, which\r\nis likewise contagious. But in this disease, as the Report of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society states, the attack is generally insidious; the eyes\r\npreserve their vivacity, and the appetite is not lost until towards the\r\nclose. A short, dry cough shows itself from the outbreak, and persists.\r\nThe breathing is frequent and painful; the sides of the chest when\r\nstruck with the fingers give out the hard, solid sound of a full barrel,\r\nthis percussion being painful. The eyes, nose, and mouth do not\r\ndischarge those purulent secretions seen in typhus; the diarrhoea only\r\ncomes on at the end, being less frequent and fetid. In the milch cows\r\nthe milk decreases, but is not quite suppressed. The heat of the horns\r\nand lower extremities is retained. The peripneumonia, in a word, runs\r\nits course more regularly, and carries off the animal about the fourth\r\nweek. Thus it will be seen that the two distempers widely differ in\r\ntheir symptoms.\r\n\r\nEvery beast which dies of the contagious typhus, bears on its digestive\r\norgans the traces of the malady, more or less strongly marked. The third\r\nand fourth stomachs and the intestines exhibit red or livid patches, and\r\nat other times ulcerations.\r\n\r\nThe cattle plague is by far the most formidable malady which can affect\r\nanimals. When left to itself, or treated without discernment, it carries\r\noff ninety cattle out of a hundred. In prior visitations, especially\r\nthat of 1750, when six millions of horned beasts were swept off in\r\nEurope, England lost from three to four hundred thousand; and we may\r\nsuppose that the number of cattle which have perished since last June\r\nexceeds sixty thousand.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is very difficult, owing to the contagious character of\r\nthe disease, and it has given rise to much discussion. In some\r\ncountries, the governments, considering the distemper incurable, only\r\nseek to stamp it out wherever it may appear. They slaughter all the sick\r\ncattle, and even those which had come near them, allowing a compensation\r\nof half the value of the beast. This measure has not always proved\r\nsuccessful, the disease having in spite of it sometimes extended over\r\nthe whole of the country thus defended from its diffusion.\r\n\r\nEngland protected by the sea, and which has been spared for a century,\r\nwas taken somewhat unawares, so that some uncertainty has been witnessed\r\nin the measures employed to arrest its course. In some districts, the\r\nparties interested have had the good sense to form assurance funds; and\r\nit is much to be regretted that the same plan has not been adopted for\r\nthe metropolis.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot help what has been done; let us, therefore, be reconciled\r\nwith the past, and see what is best to be done in future for the\r\ninterests of all. What is the present state of the matter? A certain\r\nnumber of districts, both in England and Scotland, are still exempt from\r\nthe typhus; in others the disease is generally extending its ravages.\r\n\r\nThose districts which hitherto have been spared, should institute\r\nassurance funds, and take every precaution to secure themselves against\r\nthis scourge. In France, in Belgium, even in Great Britain, some places\r\nmanaged, in 1750, to successfully protect themselves by prohibiting the\r\nimportation of any foreign cattle or animal. These preventive measures\r\nmay now be taken with some chance of success in certain parts. Ireland,\r\nwhich, thanks to the published Orders in Council, seems to have escaped\r\nup to this time from the contagion, shows us the effectual results of\r\nthese sanitary measures.\r\n\r\nAs for the districts already infected, it is of the highest importance\r\nto send no more tainted beasts to the different fairs and markets,\r\notherwise the distemper will spread indefinitely: the unsold cattle, the\r\nsheep, the pigs, which are placed only a few yards apart, must\r\nnecessarily convey the contagion everywhere. It would even be necessary\r\nat this time not to collect oxen and other animals together in the same\r\nmarkets; we urgently invite the attention of all public authorities to\r\nthis most important question.\r\n\r\nAt all events, the farmers and graziers who, after all the cautions they\r\nhave received, all the orders which have been published, and all the\r\ndangers which have been clearly exposed to them, should still persist in\r\ndriving their cattle out of their abodes, would deserve censure, and\r\nought to be heavily fined. The best they can do, since the contagion has\r\nnot been prevented, is to submit their cattle to the treatment which we\r\nare now going to explain to them in detail.\r\n\r\nIt has been abundantly proved by the many convictions at the various\r\npolice courts, that the flesh of cattle seriously diseased has been sold\r\nto the consumers, to the great injury of the public health; and if the\r\ncholera, which is steadily and surely advancing towards us, should mix\r\nits fatal germs with those of the ox-typhus, we must all expect\r\ndeplorable consequences, in case the flesh of tainted oxen should\r\ncontinue to be sold by the butchers, as during the last three months it\r\nhas been.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer or grazier who shall have fully ascertained that the ox\r\ntyphus has insinuated itself into his farm or his stables, must\r\ninstantly have recourse to the necessary measures and safeguards by\r\nmeans of which he may limit its pernicious influence, and prevent the\r\nspread of the contagion to his other cattle still sound and healthy. Let\r\nhim immediately divide his stock of animals into three classes or\r\nlots--the first class must consist of healthy cattle, having had no\r\ndirect contact with the infected beasts; the second class must contain\r\nthose cattle which, though not yet sick, may become so, because they\r\nhave been in contact with those tainted; the third class will be\r\ncomposed of cattle smitten with the typhus.\r\n\r\nThe sound and healthy cattle forming the first class must be removed\r\nfrom the farm, and driven to the field separately, by some other road,\r\nin different pastures, and only after the dispersion of the morning\r\nmists. Those which are accustomed to continue at the rack must be taken\r\nout twice a day, for the twofold object of taking wholesome exercise,\r\nand allowing their stalls and sheds to be cleaned.\r\n\r\nTheir feeding must be attended to and watched with very particular care;\r\nthe rations of those which were being fattened up must be decreased, and\r\nthey ought to be sold to the butcher for consumption as soon as\r\npossible. Let the following provisions be added to their daily\r\nsustenance:\r\n\r\n  Pounded oats                 4 pounds.\r\n  Pounded juniper berries      1 pound.\r\n  Powdered gentian             1 ounce.\r\n  Sulphate of iron             2 drachms.\r\n  Carbonate of soda            2   \"\r\n\r\nThe herdsman who tends the cattle whilst feeding in the fields must have\r\nthem cleaned every day: he will carefully wash and scrub them; he will\r\nnot allow them to drink out of the ponds, or at any stagnant and muddy\r\nwatercourse.\r\n\r\nThose belonging to the second class must receive the same strengthening\r\nand tonic ration in the morning; and, twice every day, one of the\r\nfollowing anti-contagious preparations: either a solution of _chlorate\r\nof potash_ or of _permanganate of potash_; two drachms of either of\r\nthese salts dissolved in eight ounces of warm water, mixed afterwards\r\nwith a gallon of an infusion of sage or hyssop, just at the time when\r\nthe drink is given to them.\r\n\r\nOr you may employ, for the same purpose, a solution of arseniate of\r\nsoda--two grains dissolved in four ounces of water, and mixed with\r\ntheir drink in the same way. You need hardly be told that these doses\r\nmust be reduced one half, when you have to treat a calf or a heifer, and\r\nthat the same diminution will hold good, in their cases, for all other\r\nmedicaments. _The use of these anti-contagious drinks is of the highest\r\nimportance; I recommend you earnestly to study their effects, and to\r\ncontinue them even after the distemper shall have broken out._\r\n\r\nThese drinks having no disagreeable taste, the cattle take to them in\r\ngeneral; should the contrary be the case, give them in a bottle as all\r\nmen who are cattle owners know how to do.\r\n\r\nIf the health of any of these animals among which the outbreak of the\r\ntyphus is apprehended should seem below the standard, you must apply a\r\npurgative to those whose bowels do not operate well, and even have\r\nrecourse to bleeding in exceptional cases.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of those cattle which are undergoing the preventive\r\ntreatment, let the hygienic conditions of their stalls and sheds be\r\nlooked to; for no circumstance must be overlooked or neglected if we\r\nhope to withstand the propagation of so formidable a malady. Be careful\r\nto take out the litter every day, to wash the floor and cleanse it of\r\nthe droppings, to ventilate the place thoroughly, to fumigate it with\r\nburnt sulphur or aromatic plants, such as juniper berries, sage,\r\nrosemary, salted with nitrate of potash and arsenic acid; in order to\r\npromote the combustion and give effect to its disinfectious properties.\r\nAt night, camphor or tar, or naphthaline, or creosote, or even iodine,\r\nmay be left in the stable to diffuse their vapours; all these measures\r\nare very effectual in modifying the air.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what must be done with respect to the sick animals\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe typhus, as we have said, when once it is developed in an ox or cow,\r\nusually pursues its fatal course until the last period of its cure;\r\ngenerally death alone can arrest its march. Besides, the disorders which\r\nthis disease produces in the various functions of the body are not the\r\nsame at the different stages of its duration. Thus, for instance, the\r\nfever produces great excitement in the beginning, but later it produces\r\nexhaustion. Without being a physician, a man can understand that the\r\ntreatment to be applied to these different states ought not to be the\r\nsame. We must, moreover, observe that the typhus is of all known\r\ndistempers the most difficult to treat. It requires in the doctor a\r\ndegree of skill, of practical experience, vigilance, decision, and\r\nsureness of hand which no man can be expected to possess at the first\r\noutbreak of the epizootia.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the constitution of the ox, so easily shaken,\r\nundergoes in two weeks all the commotion which a man labouring under\r\ntyphoid fever would be subject to in a month. The phenomena succeed each\r\nother with terrific swiftness, leaving scarcely time for us to act, or\r\nfor the medicines to operate. Do not, therefore, marvel at the great\r\nmortality among your cattle, and at my repeated recommendations of the\r\npreventive treatment by means of inoculation.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak, you must reduce the violence of the fever, prevent the\r\nderangements in connexion with the nervous centres, assuage the thirst,\r\nempty the stomachs and intestines, which will be the principal seat of\r\nthe complaint, and sometimes let blood.\r\n\r\nBut how are you to obtain these results? By abolishing the solid\r\nfeeding, which is easily done, since the animal has lost his appetite.\r\nGive him to drink, three or four times a day, half a pailful of a\r\ndecoction of good hay, adding thereto a sprinkling of salt; or a\r\ndecoction of wall-wort, with a drachm of nitrate of potash; or water\r\nwhitened with bran and flour, or whey, with a little vinegar. If the\r\nanimal has a tendency to cold, if he coughs, if his breathing is\r\noppressed, give him warm drinks, consisting of an infusion of mallow\r\nleaves and borage, or else a light decoction of barley and oats, and\r\ncover the animal's body warmly over.\r\n\r\nNow, with respect to purgatives: give the animal, night and morning,\r\naccording to the effect produced, 6 or 8 ounces of Epsom salts (sulphate\r\nof magnesia), or an equal dose of Glauber's salt (sulphate of soda),\r\ndissolved in two pints of honey-coloured water; or 12 ounces of linseed\r\noil in some warm drink; or a decoction of senna leaves and prunes, with\r\nan ounce of sulphate of soda added thereto.\r\n\r\nWe might point out a larger number of purgatives, but we shall desist\r\nfrom so doing. Those which we have just prescribed, not being irritant\r\nto the intestines, are the best which can be employed.\r\n\r\nIf the animal is very restive, if he passes through alternate fits of\r\ndejection, stupor, and great excitement, you must have recourse to\r\nbleeding, particularly local bleeding, by opening the small veins of the\r\nhead. If the excitement does not abate you must add, night and morning,\r\nto one of his drinks, 2 grains of extract of belladonna, or a half ounce\r\nof powdered belladonna leaves. If the fever, at first, is irregular, and\r\ntends to become malignant, you must then have recourse to sulphate of\r\nquinine, 20 grains in the morning, and the same quantity during the day.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease is principally seated in the lungs, add to one of the\r\npectoral drinks 4 ounces of oxymel of squills, and 2 grains of opium,\r\ngiving also an emetic--5 grains of tartar-emetic to 4 pints of water--to\r\nbe taken in four times, at intervals of two hours.\r\n\r\nWhilst this medication is applied to the internal organs, let the animal\r\nhave unusual care taken of him; let his head be washed several times a\r\nday with vinegar and water.\r\n\r\nSuch is the course of treatment to be adopted during the first three or\r\nfour days. It must be, of course, followed methodically, watching and\r\nobeying the signs of nature. The purgatives must not be given on those\r\ndays when the sick animal is bled, and the doses must vary with the\r\neffects they produce.\r\n\r\nFrom the fourth to the seventh day the symptoms change, diarrhoea\r\nshows itself, and the running appears at the nose, mouth, and eyes; you\r\nmust then continue the use of purgatives, but the dose must be weaker.\r\nThose mentioned above are suitable in every way. The drinks, too,\r\ncontinue the same. Sometimes, at this period of the disease, the animal\r\nis utterly cast down, nothing can draw him from his stupor: he lies down\r\nthe whole day; in this case you give him acetate of ammonia, from 1 to 6\r\nounces, in a pint of water, gradually increasing from 1 to 2 ounces a\r\nday, according to the effect produced; and meanwhile, plain\r\nnon-acidulated drinks should be administered.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the disease it is right to assist the depurative work\r\nof nature. This is effected by inserting a seton in the neck, and the\r\nsecretion of this issue is kept up by means of such an ointment as the\r\nbasilicon with powdered cantharides. Finally, the mouth, nose, and eyes\r\nmust be washed very often with an infusion of camomile and sage.\r\n\r\nAt the last period of the distemper, the beast sinks into a state of\r\ngeneral exhaustion; his life seems all but extinguished through excess\r\nof weakness. You must now sustain and keep him up by every possible\r\ncontrivance; give him bitter and stimulating drinks, beer diluted with\r\nwater, adding thereto some powder of Peruvian bark, or sulphate of\r\nquinine. This is prepared by steeping in 8 pints of boiling water,\r\nPeruvian bark, gentian root, centaury leaves and flowers, and hops, 1\r\nounce of each; or else prepare a drink consisting of veterinary treacle,\r\nextract of juniper, 1 ounce of each, dissolved in 2 ounces of alcohol,\r\nand then mixed with 3 pints of water.\r\n\r\nWhen the diarrhoea becomes fetid and bloody, give, night and morning,\r\na clyster composed of a decoction of Peruvian bark, and a teaspoonful of\r\npowdered charcoal from the poplar, well sifted. If the running from the\r\nnostrils begins to stop, you must inject into the nasal orifices some\r\nspoonfuls of a sternutatory solution, thus composed--\r\n\r\n  Spanish pepper                 1 ounce.\r\n  Essence of turpentine          1   \"\r\n  Camphor                        2 drachms.\r\n  Vinegar                        2 pints.\r\n\r\nShould any sores form on the skin, or should they arise from the opening\r\nof purulent deposits, dress them with the following ointment--\r\n\r\n  Acetate of copper             ½ a drachm.\r\n  Calcined alum                 20 grains.\r\n  Sal ammoniac                  20   \"\r\n  Camphor                       ½ a drachm.\r\n  Common ointment               ½ an ounce.\r\n\r\nIf the natural heat diminishes greatly, if the chill reaches the hams\r\nand skin, let the beast be rubbed all over, three times a day, with\r\nwool, moistened with the following liniment--\r\n\r\n  Laurel oil                    ½ an ounce.\r\n  Green soap                    ½     \"\r\n  Volatile oil of lavender      ½ a drachm.\r\n  Solution of ammonia           ½     \"\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the above, give the following cordial, to be drunk\r\nin two draughts--\r\n\r\n  Cinnamon                      ½ an ounce.\r\n  Extract of gentian            1 ounce.\r\n  Red wine                      2 pints.\r\n\r\nShould the animal fall into a state of lethargy, you must have recourse\r\nto strokes of fire, according to surgical usage.\r\n\r\nThis distemper must extend to its extreme degree of gravity before it\r\nadvances towards its cure; you need, therefore, not despair until the\r\nlast moment. At this period of exhaustion, the drinks above-mentioned\r\nare given up, or you add nutritive beverages to them, such as beef-tea,\r\nfat soups, milk, and farinaceous drinks.\r\n\r\nIf the animal holds on, and his appetite returns, which will be shown by\r\nthe desquamation of the nostrils, by the return of rumination, by the\r\nhabit of the beast to look right and left, to question you in a manner,\r\nadd cut straw to his nutritive drinks: send him out every day into the\r\nopen air, and let him return by slow degrees to his habitual feeding.\r\nBut it is extremely important to watch the intestinal functions; to\r\ndiminish and change the food, if the diarrhoea returns; as such\r\nrelapses often cause the death of an animal considered out of danger.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, farmers and graziers, is the treatment to be opposed to the\r\nox typhus: it is simple as respects the remedies, and I have deemed that\r\nit ought to be so, in order that the medicines prescribed might be had\r\neverywhere, and at a cost which the poor man could command as well as\r\nthe rich. The disease is variable, it is not always equally deadly; and\r\nthere comes a moment when in some sort it cures itself, with a little\r\nassistance and watching. The great point is, to be careful and vigilant,\r\nto attend to nature and the instincts of the suffering cattle, and lend\r\nyourselves to both.\r\n\r\nI cannot reproduce here the instructions given by the Privy Council to\r\nprotect your cattle from contagion, and above all not to propagate it,\r\nbut I shall refer you to Doctor Thudichum's _Memorandum_, page 257. This\r\nexposition is too complete to need anything added to it by me; study it\r\nwell; let it be your monitor and guide; read it over again and again;\r\nyour own interests and those of the whole country depend on the manner\r\nin which you shall treat this admirable warning.\r\n\r\nThere are in this disease, as in every other, unforeseen varieties and\r\ncomplications, such as those which are brought on by the gestation and\r\nabortion of cows, and those proceeding from prior disease; for these\r\naccidents you will provide. Moreover, such a terrible distemper can only\r\nbe treated according to the advice of a professional man. Call him in,\r\nthen, follow his advice and prescriptions with rigid exactness, and do\r\nnot attempt to do better than he; and, above all, arm yourselves against\r\nthe insidious pretensions of quacks and charlatans, whatever mantle they\r\nmay put on to hide their ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH PART.\r\n\r\n    _Suggestions on the Improvements to be effected in the Study\r\n      of Medical Science, in order that we may be in a Condition\r\n      to confront Diseases generally, but Epizootic and Epidemic\r\n      Diseases in particular._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epizootia of bovine typhus which is now extending its unrestricted\r\nravages over this island, and which has assumed the magnitude of a\r\ngeneral calamity, has naturally excited and stirred up the public mind.\r\nThoughtful and earnest men could not look on and witness unmoved the\r\never progressive march of the scourge; but each observer has,\r\nconsistently with his means and qualifications, striven to find a remedy\r\nto resist the evil. Thus, we have seen, and with respectful interest we\r\nhave watched, the gentlemen of the press, and other men of letters,\r\neconomists, scientific men, and, above all, physicians, producing from\r\nday to day in the newspapers articles and letters of remarkable merit\r\non the all-engrossing subject of this epizootia. The re-opening of the\r\nmedical colleges furnished the skilful professors at their head with a\r\nseasonable opportunity to consider this dire distemper, according to the\r\nviews of general pathology and medical philosophy, and this they have\r\ndone with unquestionable talent and ability. Still, something remains to\r\nbe said on this important matter, and since I have taken up my pen, like\r\nothers, I wish to mingle my voice with that of my brethren, and inquire\r\nwhether the time is not come to avail ourselves more fully than we have\r\ndone yet of the grand discoveries of the exact sciences, which, with\r\nrespect to the science of medicine, are the instruments of its progress.\r\nAnd my object in doing so, is, that we may, as far as possible, rise to\r\na level with the ordeal which the future may have in store for us.\r\n\r\nMedicine is at once an art and a science. An art it has been at all\r\ntimes, and in every age of civilized man; but it became a science only\r\nwhen human knowledge had acquired a certain expansion; when natural\r\nphenomena had been tested and explained; when mathematics, physics,\r\nchemistry, botany, general anatomy, general pathology, had enabled the\r\ninquiring physician to study with important results whatever belongs to\r\nhis theme; to understand the serial chain and connexion of bodies with\r\neach other, in the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, and to\r\ninvestigate their immutable laws. Uric acid, as we see with the\r\nmicroscope, will always crystallize in rhombohedrons, according to a\r\nfixed law; the vegetable cell, the germination of a seed, must obey, and\r\nalways submit to, the innate and indestructible forces inherent in them.\r\nThat which is true in the vegetable is true in the animal world, as\r\nregards the pre-established order which regulates and controls the\r\nphenomena of life. These laws which govern the development of organic\r\nphenomena being immutable and everlasting, permit the different\r\ngenerations which succeed each other on our globe to build upon a\r\ndurable basis, which certifies to the slow and laborious, but\r\nirresistible march of human progress.\r\n\r\nMedical science being in truth only the application of other positive\r\nsciences to the preservation of health and the cure of diseases,\r\ncontinues like them to perfect itself incessantly; but all it can do is\r\nto follow them at a distance, and it can never hope to reach their\r\ndegree of superiority.\r\n\r\nThese are truths which have been long admitted and felt by us.\r\nTherefore, we have appealed for assistance to the discoveries of the\r\nnatural sciences: physics, chemistry, have in our hands become effectual\r\nmeans of observation and analysis; and we, in our age, gain more\r\nknowledge in fifty years than our forefathers did in several centuries,\r\nfor they were then necessarily rather artists than scholars. In a word,\r\nmedical science or biology is constituting itself, and if it be fully\r\nconscious of its impotence in the case of many diseases, it also knows\r\nits progressive improvement. It is striving to achieve the highest place\r\namong social institutions, and the day may come when it shall obtain it,\r\nfor nations will then owe to us their health and life--that is to say,\r\ntheir earthly happiness.\r\n\r\nThe laws by which organic phenomena are regulated, are, we have said,\r\neverlasting; we may also declare that they are general. One of these\r\nlaws common to the plant, to the shell, to every species of vertebrata,\r\nreappears in man, whose organization comprises all the functions divided\r\namong the other organic kingdoms. Not only does the organization of man\r\nobey the laws which govern the vital phenomena of other animals; not\r\nonly does he possess their organs and functions, but he is a tributary\r\nsubject to their diseases. So that the knowledge of the laws affecting\r\nthe functions and diseases of those creatures which are placed below him\r\nin the scale of animals ought to be the first foundation of all medical\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThese truths are too manifest to be new; they are written and professed\r\neverywhere, and every one amongst us has received general notions of\r\ncomparative anatomy and physiology at the beginning of his course of\r\nstudy. But let us admit that these notions only served to expand the\r\ncircle of our knowledge and ideas, and that we seldom or never apply\r\nthem to the practice of our art. It would have been very different had\r\nwe received at the beginning of our medical novitiate, not merely in\r\ntheory and books, but practically and experimentally, precise notions of\r\nanatomy, physiology, and, let me add, of the _pathology of all\r\nanimals_. Let us suppose for a moment that the task had been imposed\r\nupon us before entering upon the study of human maladies, to observe the\r\nstructure of plants and animals, to submit their tissues to\r\nmicroscopical examination and chemical analysis; to study experimentally\r\nall their functions and diseases, and acknowledge that had such been the\r\ncase, the anatomy, physiology; and pathology of man would have been far\r\nbetter understood, and that most of the difficulties against which we\r\nnow contend in vain in our helplessness, might easily have been\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nComparative anatomy and physiology are the first conditions of all\r\nmedical instruction of a serious character; there can be no doubt on the\r\nsubject, but the evidence being not perhaps so palpable with respect to\r\ncomparative pathology, it will not be useless, therefore, to enter into\r\nfuller particulars as to this subject.\r\n\r\nWe know not whether any one has ever sought to retrace the first origin\r\nof our diseases in the animal kingdom, but it would undoubtedly be a\r\nstudy of great scientific interest. As for us, we gladly believe that\r\nman, created to be the sovereign lord of the earth, did not originally\r\nreceive the principle of every organic disease with which we see him\r\naffected. It seems to us probable that he was created sound in body and\r\nin mind, but unequal is his vital powers, and in his faculties and\r\ntalents, the social functions being various and dissimilar, and subject\r\nto physical and moral infirmities. We think it likely that plants and\r\nanimals, from which, in course of time, man's substance is formed, have\r\ntransmitted the first causes, the germs of some organic diseases with\r\nwhich they were themselves affected. We see in this transmission of\r\nanimal diseases to man, a connecting link, which appears to us to be a\r\ncondition of harmony, order, peace, and happiness among all living\r\nbeings. It seems to us that the first injunction of a legislator should\r\nbe--_love other animals like yourselves_; for if man had practised this\r\nmaxim, he would have logically applied the same to his fellow-creatures;\r\nand no doubt, with such principles to guide them, past generations would\r\nnot have bequeathed to us the innumerable calamities we have had to\r\ndeplore.\r\n\r\nWe think that we receive from animals some of their diseases, because\r\nthe fact is palpably evident; thus they have parasitical diseases, such\r\nas favus, tænia, psora, trichinosis, which they transmit to us. They are\r\nlikewise smitten with small-pox, typhoid fever, and with typhus; and\r\nunder certain given conditions they may transmit them to us. They die of\r\nconsumption and cancer, and it is probable that they transfuse into us\r\nthrough their milk and flesh the germs of these diseases. Finally, we\r\nhave our epidemics as they have their epizootics; and here we will limit\r\nour instances of this reciprocation.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the study of these maladies in animals would have\r\nbeen for us the source of precise knowledge, which, if well understood\r\nand explained, would have often led to their preventive treatment. This\r\nis what has occurred in the case of small-pox; it is what will one day\r\noccur in typhoid fever, in times of epidemic, as will be the case in a\r\ncertain number of other general or local diseases.\r\n\r\nIn truth, some complaints now looked upon as inherent to the human\r\nspecies, were originally foreign to it; most parasitical diseases\r\nbelong to this class. Thus man has not the _psora_, or itch--the\r\ndisease does not properly belong to him; the parasite which engenders it\r\nis not bred in him, it is always transmitted to him by animals. It is\r\nthe same with the tænia, or tape-worm, with the trichina, or fine\r\nhair-worm.\r\n\r\nMedical science, instituted on the bases of comparative pathology, would\r\nhave made the study of diseases in the brute creation, not the\r\ncollateral, but the principal object of its inquiries. It would have\r\napplied itself to the cure of the lower animals; and whilst learning to\r\ncure them, it would have ensured the cure of men's diseases.\r\n\r\nIf such be the case, can any one believe that the treatment of diathetic\r\nand hereditary maladies would be, as they still are, insoluble problems;\r\nand that the physician would have the misery of seeing decimated, whilst\r\nhe helplessly looks on, a large part of the population, condemned\r\ninevitably to die of consumption and cancer? Would every man smitten\r\nwith hydrophobia be irrevocably condemned to death? Assuredly, it would\r\nnot be so.\r\n\r\nThat the physician should have been reduced to the painful necessity of\r\nconfessing his want of means, when medicine could be nothing more than\r\nan art, we admit; but now that science has grown up and come of age,\r\nsociety has a right to challenge him to do, what in past ages could not\r\nhave been expected of him. Briefly, we think that the time is come, by\r\nblending comparative pathology with anatomy and physiology, to construct\r\none of the bases of the tripod on which medical science will have to\r\nrest. The success which has already been achieved in this direction is a\r\ncertain guarantee for those which we may hope for hereafter.\r\n\r\nSuch is our deep conviction, and perhaps we have some title to speak out\r\ndecidedly on this point, as we have long since exemplified our precepts\r\nby actual proofs.\r\n\r\nPersuaded for many years that comparative pathology afforded to\r\nindustrious men a new mine, rich in precious veins for working, we\r\nseveral times endeavoured to explore this fertile field. But,\r\nunfortunately, our means of action not being consistent with our\r\nsanguine expectations, we were repeatedly compelled to suspend our\r\npursuits, until at last we found at the Ecole Vétérinaire d'Alfort, the\r\nfavourable opportunity and the essential conditions of which we had so\r\nlong been in quest.\r\n\r\nGrieved at our helplessness to stay the ravages of pulmonary\r\nconsumption, I formed one day the resolution to study that wasteful\r\ncomplaint in animals in order to discover, or at least to look for, the\r\nrequired remedy. With that view, I confined in a dark, cold, and damp\r\ncellar a number of animals to practise on: birds of different species,\r\nrabbits, a monkey, a dog, &c. To these animals I dealt out a deficient\r\nquantity of food. The monkey, as might have been expected, was the first\r\nto be affected, since in our climates they all die of consumption. Next,\r\nand for the same reason, it was the parrot's turn; then the chickens and\r\nducks died; after them the rabbits;--in fine, at the end of fourteen\r\nmonths, the dog alone survived. All the rest had sunk under consumption,\r\nand exhibited tubercles in different organs--in the lungs or mesentery.\r\n\r\nIt was then necessary to have the counter-proof: to place a second set\r\nof animals in the same conditions, to produce the disease again, and\r\nattempt its cure. But the first experiment had been a long one, and I\r\nwas forced to relinquish the inquiry, which, moreover, was above my\r\nmeans at that period.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, it seemed to me strange that we should be obliged\r\nto open the bladder of patients suffering from the stone, or to subject\r\nthem to lithotrity, which has also its perils. Nature, I said to myself,\r\nforms calculi by uniting organic elements, by crystallizing them, and by\r\ncementing them with vesical mucus. But would it not be possible to cure\r\nthe disease by employing contrary means--dissolving the calculi in the\r\nbladder by means of continued injections, changing the chemical agents\r\naccording to the composition of the calculus, and adding thereto the\r\naction of a galvanic current?\r\n\r\nAfter this, I pursued my inquiry in this direction. I studied for\r\nseveral months the chemical composition of calculi by examining them in\r\ntheir dissolved state; and I saw that those in which the alkaline bases\r\nprevailed, being submitted to a diluted solution of tartaric acid, which\r\nwould not injure the bladder, crumbled after a time; that the calculi\r\nwith excess of acid were also attacked by an alkaline solution; in\r\nfine, that the calculi of oxalate of lime alone seemed to resist the\r\naction of these chemical solutions. But it is well known that they\r\nsometimes defy all lithotrite instruments, and compel us to have\r\nrecourse to the knife.\r\n\r\nThese preliminary experiments over, it was necessary to come to their\r\napplication, and for that purpose to make experiments on some animals.\r\nThe canine species, omnivorous like ourselves, was chosen in preference.\r\nBitches were selected to be practised on; for as their urinary passages\r\nare wider and more flexible, it enabled me to insert in the bladder\r\nfragments of calculi already analysed, which were to serve as the nuclei\r\nto the stones they were intended to develop.\r\n\r\nThis second assortment of animals, penned up apart from each other, were\r\nsupplied with different modes of sustenance: some of them were put upon\r\na diet of meat only, others on a farinaceous diet, and a third set on a\r\nmixed course of food. These experiments were being regularly followed\r\nup, when an important and unforeseen event compelled me to desist at the\r\nend of six months. The poor animals were destroyed; but all of them, as\r\nI had anticipated, had generated calculi of various chemical\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nThese unfinished inquiries concerning comparative pathology, thus\r\ninterrupted in spite of myself, might, had circumstances allowed them to\r\nreach the goal, have authorized us to undertake in man the dissolution\r\nof stone in the bladder. And how would this have been effected? By\r\nseizing the stone between the two ends of the catheter with the double\r\ncurrent, and by injecting a well-sustained series of dissolvents into\r\nthe patient, whilst lying at his ease in a recumbent posture.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. They would likewise, I believe, have thrown some light\r\non the organic production of calculi, on the lithic diathesis, and the\r\nparticular formation of the stone; and led us, in some degree, to their\r\npreventive treatment, which is always superior to the curative remedy.\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent occasion, I betook myself to my task under more\r\nfavourable conditions. I undertook at Alfort, conjointly with Professor\r\nDelafond, a course of experiments on the cutaneous diseases of animals\r\nin relation to comparative pathology, having already, whilst walking\r\nthe hospitals, published a work on the \"Entomology and Pathology of\r\nPsora in Man,\" which had been printed at the expense of the Academy.\r\n\r\nThese inquiries and examinations at Alfort were persisted in for five\r\nyears, and were considered to have led to very satisfactory results as\r\nregards general pathology. But I have spoken of these labours in the\r\nfirst part of my book.\r\n\r\nPardon me, reader, and do not suppose that vanity or any desire to\r\nparade myself has induced me to refer to these experiments. No; my only\r\nobject is to show to what results similar studies might lead, if they\r\nwere executed on a large scale and on the whole animal kingdom; if,\r\ninstead of these partial efforts made under favour, some special and\r\nappropriate medical institution encouraged earnest experimentalists,\r\nsupplying them without stint with all necessary resources, and with the\r\nbest and completest instruments of observation.\r\n\r\nWill any one deny, that if medical science had been settled on this\r\nfoundation fifty years ago--that is to say, since the exact sciences\r\nfirst began to provide us with the means of investigation, it would now\r\nbe so impotent? Epizootias and epidemics would not thus flout us as they\r\ndo; the cholera would no longer be an enigma, nor the ox typhus so\r\nincurable. No! a hundred times no! Medical science would not he helpless\r\nand impotent in our day, had our forerunners been more mindful and\r\nprovident.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of this, the science for which we plead would have done\r\ngood work. It would have made and confirmed an infinite variety of\r\nobservations on the brute creation; it would have transmitted our\r\ndiseases to them as they transmit their diseases to us; it would have\r\ntreated and cured these diseases, and every such cure would have been a\r\nnew triumph, a new victory for mankind.\r\n\r\nFor instance, during an outbreak of cholera, this science would have\r\nbeen ready and prepared to try different experiments on men and animals;\r\nit would first have communicated the cholera to animals, and then\r\nsubmitted them to a variety of experimental treatments. This cholera,\r\nwhich is not an infectious fever, with its regular and assigned periods,\r\nlike typhus, and which we are not obliged to suffer to run its course,\r\nbut which, on the contrary, is a nervous affection produced by some\r\npoisonous miasma, the toxical effects of which first of all assail the\r\nnervous system and then more particularly the great sympathetic; the\r\ncramps being but the result of a reflective action--_this cholera, we\r\nsay, must be curable_, and well-advised experiments would reveal the\r\nremedy we want for it, nor should we have to wait long for the\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I once made a desperate attempt in this direction. It was\r\nduring the cholera of 1854. We remarked whilst dissecting subjects, as\r\nis always the case, that the mucous membranes of the stomach and\r\nintestines, which were in a manner paralyzed, had suffered the fluid\r\nparts of the blood to ooze out on the surface. Hence the cause of those\r\nvomitings, and those watery and colourless diarrhoeas which nothing\r\ncan stop, so that at a given moment the patients die, poisoned, of\r\ncourse, but dying more particularly through want of circulation, the\r\nblood being reduced to its solid parts and unable to circulate any\r\nlonger. Relying on this fact, and trusting for want of better to the\r\nsecondary effects, I strove to restore to the blood its aqueous part,\r\nand, if possible, to re-establish the circulation.\r\n\r\nWith this view, I went to the Hôpital de la Charité, provided with all\r\nthe requisite instruments. Choleraic patients were being brought there\r\nevery hour. The experiments being new, venturesome, and _dangerous_, in\r\nthe eyes of the hospital directors, I was only suffered to operate on\r\nthe moribund. The first patient, considered to be in a state\r\nsufficiently desperate to be given up to me, was a woman, forty-five\r\nyears old. She was literally insensible, and thoroughly cold. I\r\nhesitated for a moment to try the operation under conditions so\r\nunreasonable, so preposterous--almost upon a corpse. The radial arteries\r\nin the arm had ceased to beat, and the heart alone kept up a feeble\r\ncirculation at the central parts. At length I opened the vein, from\r\nwhich not a single drop of blood proceeded, and taking the usual\r\nmeasures to prevent the air from having access, I gradually and slowly\r\ninjected two ounces of alkaline solution, the process of injection\r\nlasting twelve minutes. It was scarcely over before the patient\r\nhalf-opened her eyelids, and looked about her with astonishment; the\r\npulse became perceptible for a few moments, and all present thought she\r\nwas saved. We put a few questions to her; the patient could not answer\r\nus, but she nodded as much as to say \"yes,\" when asked if she felt\r\nbetter. But this was all we could do in her case. The circulation\r\nstopped again, the patient relapsed into her state of insensibility and\r\ndied two hours after the injection.\r\n\r\nThe result obtained in this instance had not answered our expectation.\r\nHowever, the circulation had for a minute or two resumed its course, and\r\na flash of reason had once more shown itself.\r\n\r\nI thought the experiment ought to be repeated, and accordingly the next\r\nmorning I made another trial. The patient this time was a working\r\nshoemaker, thirty-eight years of age, exactly in the same far-gone,\r\nhopeless state as the patient of the day before. In his case, the inward\r\ncommotion caused by the injection was more powerful; twenty minutes\r\nafter the injection he was able to see, to understand, to speak, to\r\nraise his head; but this vital recovery was, as in the former case, but\r\nof short continuance, and two hours and a half after the operation the\r\nman expired.\r\n\r\nAfter these experiments I dissected the two bodies, and then, finding\r\nthat their lungs were infiltrated with water, I understood that the\r\nalkaline solution had not been assimilated, that it had stopped in its\r\npassage into the pulmonary parenchyma, to the detriment of the functions\r\nof the hæmatosis. I also understood that the proper injection, instead\r\nof distilled alkaline water, would have been the serum of the blood,\r\ndrawn at the very moment from some man or animal.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion which I drew from these experiments was that a variety of\r\noperations, made at different stages of the malady, might lead to\r\nbeneficial results, especially if we succeeded in transmitting the\r\ncholera to animals, as that would enable us to test a large number of\r\ncurative agents and to pursue a methodical course of experimentalization.\r\n\r\nFrom all I have said, I infer that life, health, and disease, being\r\nsubject to the same laws throughout the whole animal kind, it is certain\r\nthat the physician should possess precise knowledge as to the\r\norganization, the functions, and diseases of animals. That by proceeding\r\nin this manner, we shall advance from the simple to the complex, from\r\nthe plant to the animal, and from the animal to man. That we must of\r\nnecessity emerge from the state in which we are now entangled BY FOUNDING\r\nAND ESTABLISHING IN LONDON A COLLEGE OF THE NATURAL AND MEDICAL SCIENCES.\r\nEvery medical pupil might spend two years in this college, receiving in\r\nit an experimental and practical training; he would devote himself in it\r\nto the chemical analysis of all bodies, to physiological experiments and\r\ntests, without limit and of every kind.\r\n\r\nMost deeply do I appreciate the many difficulties and obstacles that\r\nwould interfere with the execution of such a design. In our civilized\r\nage, nations seem rather bent on seeking out the means of exterminating\r\neach other than of protecting themselves and animals from epidemics and\r\nepizootias. It is believed that every first-rate kingdom now spends from\r\n400 to 500 millions of francs (16 to 20,000,000_l._) annually in\r\nmaintaining their land and sea forces, whilst one-half of their\r\npopulations are living in misery and ignorance, in disease and\r\ncorruption. The time is not come--shall we ever see it?--to employ the\r\nvital powers of the peoples, to better incessantly their social\r\ncondition. Perhaps, by reason of its organization, the Government of\r\nthis country would not be authorized to devote 100,000_l._ or\r\n200,000_l._ to the establishment of an institution like the medical\r\ncollege I suggest, notwithstanding its paramount necessity. But England\r\nis in the habit of doing great things independently of the Government.\r\nIn default of the ruling powers, then, let me appeal to the national\r\ninitiative, for if the spectacle which we are at present witnessing was\r\nnot, in the case of England, one of those trials which invigorate a\r\npeople by the salutary teachings which they bring; if it did not induce\r\nthem to take some energetic resolution by which their interests would be\r\nsaved and their power enlarged, it would indeed be a deplorable sign of\r\nthe times and make us despair of its future.\r\n\r\nMoreover, to show the urgency of founding a _College of Natural and\r\nMedical Science_, let us add, that in every other country they are\r\nendeavouring to unite this indispensable complement to medical\r\neducation. The German universities, the Faculty of Paris, have, for\r\nseveral years past, incorporated a course of comparative pathology, with\r\nthe other series of public lectures.\r\n\r\nIt is not a mere Utopia that we propose, but an extension and\r\nimprovement, all the parts of which are already prepared. If this\r\nCollege could be thrown open to-morrow, competent professors would be\r\nready at the call of duty to indite the programme for this instruction\r\nwithin twenty-four hours; and as for the professors themselves, there\r\nwould be enough to choose among the large body of efficient scholars who\r\ndo honour to the country.\r\n\r\nIf we have been rightly understood, we desire to see established in\r\nLondon an institution which would afford an equivalent to what exists in\r\nParis, at the Museum and Collège de France, where numerous courses of\r\nlectures on anatomy, physiology, physics, and chemistry are given. Only\r\nin London this special college would be formed and organized on such a\r\nscale as to bear away the palm from every previous foundation of the\r\nsame kind; it would be an institution unexampled in the world, out of\r\nwhose halls would one day come anatomists, physiologists, and\r\npathologists of the very highest order of excellence.--But organic\r\nmatter would not be the sole object of this instruction, for the animal\r\nis something more than matter. Courses of medical history and\r\nphilosophy, of really general pathology, would introduce the students to\r\nthe grand phenomena of nature, to the great laws which govern the worlds\r\nand the globe; and descending from the heights of science to the\r\nobservation of the infinitely minute, they would never forget the\r\nimportant part of the vital powers, and of that unknown power called at\r\ndifferent times by the names of +pneuma+, _archéc_--_mind_ and _soul_.\r\n\r\nThe Regent's Park would, we think, be the proper site for this college,\r\nas the contiguity of the Zoological Gardens would afford continual\r\nopportunities for investigating the diseases of animals.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this college would not trench upon or interfere in any manner\r\nwith those medical and veterinary establishments which at present exist;\r\nit would ally itself with, and complete them, nothing more. The\r\ninstruction received at this \"College of Natural and Medical Science\"\r\nwould be so useful and necessary, and so attractive withal, that the\r\nsons of the great families would come to it to finish their collegiate\r\nstudies, to the great benefit of the country. Other young men, in\r\nconsiderable numbers, would flock to it from various parts of the world.\r\nThe foundation of such an institution would be an epoch in the history\r\nof science, and would give England another claim to the esteem of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nI conclude, then, with a conviction that a nation which owes to Lord\r\nBacon, the founder of experimental philosophy, his imperishable book on\r\nthe _restoration, the method and teaching of the sciences_; to Harvey,\r\nthe circulation; to Priestley, the constitution of chemistry; to\r\nSydenham, the modern Hippocrates, his treatise on \"Practical Medicine\";\r\nto Jenner, vaccination; and to Charles Bell, the discovery of the\r\nsensitive and motor nerves--is a people too great and too enlightened to\r\nretrograde; and that, if the epizootic of ox typhus did find them at\r\nfirst unready and disarmed, they will in the end convert this disaster\r\ninto a new source of greatness and strength.\r\n\r\nSuch is the sincere hope which I cherish and the prayer I offer up for\r\nthe happiness of a country which, for the future, has become my own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\n  BREMEN, August 30.\r\n\r\nThe following report, drawn up by two German veterinary surgeons, of a\r\nrecent visit to London to examine into the cattle murrain, has been\r\nfurnished by the agent of the North German Lloyd's at Nordenhamm:--\r\n\r\n\"On Wednesday, the 9th instant, we, the undersigned, were requested to\r\nbe at Nordenhamm, if possible, the following morning. Upon our arrival\r\nwe were asked by the agent of the North German Lloyd's, who had\r\nconsulted with several of the chief cattle exporters, to undertake a\r\nvoyage to London at once in the steamer _Schwan_, in the interest of the\r\ncattle export from the Weser. The object of our mission was, first, to\r\nexamine as closely as possible into the epidemic cattle disease raging\r\nin and around London for some time past; then carefully to observe the\r\ntreatment of cattle upon the vessel during the voyage, upon arrival, and\r\nat the time of disembarkation; lastly, to use every means in our power\r\nto prevent obstacles being opposed to the continued export of cattle\r\nfrom these ports to England.\r\n\r\n\"Furnished by the agent of the North German Lloyd's with letters of\r\nintroduction to cattle dealers in London, and with the necessary funds,\r\nwe left Nordenhamm in the steamer _Schwan_, Captain Christensen, at 4\r\nP.M., on the 10th instant. The vessel carried 347 head of large\r\ncattle, 2 calves, and 260 sheep. Favoured by very fine weather, we\r\narrived in the Thames at 2 P.M., on the 12th. At the beginning\r\nof the voyage the animals were rather uneasy, trampled a good deal, and\r\ncaused considerable motion in the ship; after a time, however, they\r\nbecame quiet. A sharp, penetrating smell was easily perceptible in the\r\n'tween decks of the ship, which was quickly removed upon a light breeze\r\nspringing up, by means of the excellent ventilation and numerous\r\nair-pipes and wind shafts. The animals were several times watered, and\r\nit was easy to see how greatly they were refreshed. The hay in the\r\nracks, on the other hand, was hardly touched.\r\n\r\n\"Upon arriving in the port we were introduced by the captain to the two\r\nveterinary surgeons stationed here to inspect the cattle, and witnessed\r\nthe rapid disembarkation of the cargo, all of which were thoroughly\r\nhealthy, not one being condemned. The cattle, when landed, were\r\nimmediately brought to carts standing in readiness and transported to\r\nLondon, where they are cleansed and then driven into the adjacent\r\nfields.\r\n\r\n\"After doing all in our power to attain the object of our journey, we\r\nwent back to the port to wait for the _Schwan_, having first thoroughly\r\ncleansed the clothes we had worn during our inspection of the diseased\r\ncattle. The _Schwan_ came in shortly after our arrival, and disembarked\r\n256 head of large cattle, 12 calves and 400 sheep, all in good\r\ncondition. Mr. Philipps, the London agent of the North German Lloyd's,\r\nwas on the spot, together with several reporters from newspapers, who\r\nwished to see by personal investigation how and in what condition cattle\r\nare brought from the Weser.\r\n\r\n\"We re-embarked on the _Schwan_ upon the 19th. The crew were engaged\r\nduring the voyage in carefully cleansing the ship. The weather was fine,\r\nand we arrived safely at Nordenhamm upon the 21st.\r\n\r\n  (Signed)\r\n\r\n  \"G. J.

He had been appointed by the Royal Agricultural Societies\r\nof England and Ireland to proceed to the Continent in 1857, when there\r\nwas a rumour that the disease which existed among cattle in this country\r\nat the present time was prevailing in Mecklenburg. Consuls sent\r\ndespatches that the rinderpest was prevailing largely, and the\r\nGovernment, as a precautionary measure, closed the ports against the\r\nintroduction of cattle from the Baltic to this country. He found,\r\nhowever, from his observations abroad that since 1817 there had been no\r\ndisease of this kind westward of a line between Revel in the Baltic and\r\nthe Gulf of Venice, but to the eastward of that line it had existed. He\r\ncame up with the affection at the Carpathian mountains, where it was\r\nraging in 1857 just as it is raging in England at the present time. Not\r\nonly had it existed there, but it had been carried into the interior of\r\nRussia in the ordinary method of the cattle trade. A person who was in\r\nthe habit of purchasing cattle attended a fair and bought a number of\r\nanimals, and took them to his own farm, and in the course of ten days\r\none or two were seized with the disease, and the result was there was a\r\ngradual spread of the evil in that district. It gained ground until the\r\nGovernment instituted the sanitary police regulations, which, though\r\nthey were such as would be considered strange in England, were, he\r\nbelieved, absolutely necessary for the extirpation of the plague. It was\r\nundoubtedly true that no foreign animals had been seized at our ports or\r\nin the metropolitan market; but it was not necessary for the case they\r\nhad in hand to say whether the disease was or was not of foreign\r\nimportation. There was this fact before them, that it was not until the\r\nmonth of June that the disease appeared in England. A certain number of\r\nanimals came out of a diseased district. He had documentary evidence\r\nthat animals came from Revel and came from the district of Esthonia. He\r\nhad before him proof that the disease now in England was raging in that\r\ndistrict. They had proof that shortly after the arrival of those cattle\r\nin England the disease manifested itself here. He admitted there were\r\ndifficulties in the way of checking the importation of foreign cattle.\r\nThe Government had its eyes open to the matter, and he did not think it\r\npossible for the Government to have done more than they had done or to\r\nhave done more quickly what they had been doing. At this moment half the\r\nsupply of the metropolitan market came from foreign countries, and he\r\ndid not wish to convey any reflection by saying that this disease had\r\nits origin from abroad. He would admit that the animals from Germany and\r\nHungary were coming in a healthy condition; but he could not admit that\r\nthey came from Russia, Poland, or Galicia in so perfect a condition,\r\nbecause the regulations there were not sufficient to stamp out the\r\ndisease. The Government had made an inquiry as to the general health of\r\ncattle on the Continent. They believed France, Belgium, Holland,\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, Oldenburg, and a large part of the Continent that\r\nsupplied cattle to this country were free from disease. This went to\r\nshow that we had admitted a disease not from where we received our\r\nsupplies of meat, but from some other district. Then it must be\r\nassociated with the fact that it came into this country when animals\r\narrived here from an infected district in Russia. Animals from Germany\r\nand Hungary were often shipped and mixed with others from a diseased\r\ndistrict. As regarded the disease being spontaneous, we had been free\r\nfrom it for twenty years. What was the state of our cowsheds fifty years\r\nago? Were they not in a more filthy condition than they are now? If,\r\ntherefore, the disease had been induced from common causes it would have\r\nbeen here years and years ago. It was no reflection to say that a great\r\nmany cases could be traced directly to the metropolitan market. Take one\r\ncase which occurred in Sussex. Certain cattle had been bought in the\r\nmetropolitan market and were taken home. In three or four days they were\r\nill, and presented symptoms of this affection. In a few days more the\r\ncows and calves were dead. In another instance calves were bought in\r\nChichester Market, where they had been taken from London. The result was\r\nthe death of twelve cows and ten calves. The people had other cattle on\r\nthe same farm, and not one of them took it. He could say, too, that\r\npersons who had only one animal had lost it by the disease. How had the\r\ndisease got into Norfolk and Kent but by the animals which went from the\r\nmetropolitan market? He could prove by documentary evidence that it was\r\nso. He could show there was not a single instance where the origin of\r\nthe disease could not be traced to the metropolis. It was the most\r\nfearful visitation that had ever been seen in England. They had adopted\r\na system of compensation in Norfolk, and if by this meeting something\r\nwas done to shut out the animals of infected districts, no doubt the\r\npromoters would receive not only the thanks of London, but the country\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nMr. Gibbins--Now, if the disease came from abroad, and diseased cattle\r\nwere shipped on the other side of the sea, no doubt the voyage would\r\nconcentrate and aggravate the disease. The Government inspectors\r\nreported, however, that not one instance had been seen of foreign cattle\r\nso diseased, nor had any been seized and destroyed in London or anywhere\r\nelse. Whether the disease came from abroad or elsewhere he was not able\r\nto state. Sir George Grey asked him whether he had found any disease\r\namong the foreign cattle that came into the market. He said not one.\r\nThey had, no doubt, many instances of the disease amongst the cows that\r\nwere ordinarily called milch cows, but that were not milch cows when\r\nthey came to market, because one effect of the disease was to deprive\r\nthe animal of milk. These were then sent to the market and sold as fat\r\nstock. He could only say they had had no cases, except in cows, whether\r\nthey came from the dairies in London or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE C.\r\n\r\nM. Dembinski, Professor of Analytical Chemistry and Natural Science, had\r\nalso addressed a communication to the Lord Mayor on the subject. The\r\nprevalent Rinderpest, he said, originated in the steppes of Podolia,\r\nfrom which considerable herds of cattle were exported through the\r\nsteppes to Moscow, St. Petersburg, Riga, and Revel, and thence to the\r\nports of Memel, Königsberg, Dantzic, Hamburg, Kiel, and the Hague.\r\n_Deprived of congenial food and pure water on their transport through\r\nthe steppes, and then arriving at marshy lands, the exhausted animals\r\ndrank the stagnant water, which, during hot weather, exhaled a\r\npestiferous malaria, and infected them with a predisposition to the\r\nepidemic in question, which developed itself into a kind of fever on the\r\nvoyage to England in a crowded condition._\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE D.\r\n\r\n  INTERNATIONAL VETERINARY CONGRESS, VIENNA,\r\n  August, 1865.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the cattle plague, it may be well to state that Austria\r\nhas been most unfortunately situated, from the readiness with which\r\nRussian cattle have been admitted into the country at various parts of\r\nthe western and southern frontiers. At the opening of the Congress this\r\ndifficulty was particularly noted by the Ministerial counsellor, Dr.\r\nVell, who attended on behalf of the Government, for the purpose of\r\nwelcoming the assembly, and giving an assurance that its deliberations\r\nwould meet with all the attention they deserved. He specially referred\r\nto the fact that the laws relating to cattle disease prevention had been\r\nentirely revised in 1850, but that the Steppe murrain continued to be\r\nintroduced by smuggled stock into the western and southern provinces of\r\nthe State. It was therefore necessary to attempt a more effectual\r\ncontrol over the propagation of so disastrous a malady.\r\n\r\nHerr Pabst welcomed the meeting on behalf of the Minister of Trade. He\r\nsaid that the value of the cattle of the Austrian dominions considerably\r\nexceeded one hundred million pounds sterling (one thousand million\r\nAustrian florins), and that cattle plagues completely put a stop to the\r\ndevelopment of that essential branch of agriculture which embraces the\r\nimprovement and increase of live stock in a country. He assured the\r\nassembly that all would be done that was possible to improve the\r\nexisting state of matters, and that he hoped they would greatly aid the\r\nGovernment by the discussions which would take place and the conclusions\r\nat which they would arrive.\r\n\r\nI may state, by the way, that an opinion rather generally expressed by\r\nsome, and stoutly maintained by others, was that the peculiar\r\ndisposition of some of the Austrian subjects, and the feeling existing\r\nin Hungary against State measures, rendered the law, to a great extent,\r\ninoperative. I can, from personal experience, state that although\r\nstringent and most efficient means are used for the suppression of\r\ncattle plagues, and with the best results in Austria proper, there is\r\ngreat difficulty in carrying out the law in districts where Austrian\r\nrule is at a discount. Indeed this is clearly indicated by the manner in\r\nwhich the Rinderpest penetrates into Austria, where the laws are similar\r\nto those in the kingdom of Prussia, which is, and has long been,\r\ncompletely protected from invasions of the disorder.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the first International Congress, held in Hamburg in\r\n1865, Dr. Röll stated that owing to the length of time to which the\r\nquarantine for Russian cattle extended on the Austrian frontier, herds\r\nof cattle were often smuggled through, and companies had been formed for\r\nthe purpose of insurance against seizure by the authorities. The\r\nunlawful traffic was therefore carried on with comparative safety to the\r\ndealers, who cared not what misfortune they brought on a country if only\r\ntheir personal ends could be served. This question was the first to\r\noccupy the attention of the Congress last week; when a resolution was\r\nproposed to shorten the period of quarantine for cattle from Russia\r\ninto any country from twenty-one days to ten. The discussion was keen.\r\nIt was stipulated, however, that the quarantine should be carried out\r\nmost strictly over all parts of the frontier, without respect to any\r\nbreed of cattle or other circumstances which might be brought forward as\r\nexceptional reasons for retaining animals in quarantine. The committee\r\nappointed to prepare a succinct report on the subject included\r\nProfessors Unterberger, Seifmann, Werner, Zlamal, Hertwig, Haubner, and\r\nRöll; and the committee decided in favour of the shortened quarantine,\r\non the following conditions:--First--When the establishment of\r\nquarantine institutions is effected in accordance with the requirements\r\nof trade and the peculiarities of the frontier, special attention must\r\nbe paid to the erection of quarantine stables, &c., where there are\r\nfacilities for procuring an abundance of fodder and water. Second--The\r\nanimals to be kept under efficient veterinary supervision wherever they\r\nhave to submit to quarantine. The inspectors must be properly qualified\r\nveterinary surgeons. Third--The use of a brand to indicate that the\r\nanimals have been in quarantine. Fourth--The effectual disinfection, by\r\nwashing and otherwise, of animals as they leave the quarantine.\r\nFifth--The introduction of a poll-tax along the eastern frontiers, and\r\nthe appointment of proper veterinarians to be on the watch as to the\r\nhealth of cattle along the frontiers. Sixth--Careful supervision to be\r\nplaced over the traffic in cattle wherever it takes place in a country.\r\nSeventh--The punishment to the full extent that the law allows of all\r\nwho break the rules relating to quarantine or other means for the\r\nprevention of the cattle plague.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hertwig, of Berlin, whose opinion is always listened to with\r\ngreat respect in veterinary circles, stated his reasons for adopting\r\nthese resolutions now, whereas in 1863 he was against shortening the\r\nperiod of quarantine. He referred chiefly to the importance of not\r\noffering temptations for cattle dealers to evade the law by insisting on\r\nunreasonable restrictions. The feeling of the assembly was greatly in\r\nfavour of avoiding vexatious and expensive measures, which might greatly\r\ninterfere with the employment of capital in cattle traffic. A small\r\nnumber of professors, not exceeding eight or nine, held out for a\r\nquarantine of twenty-one days.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to state that quarantine regulations, which have been\r\nregarded as almost useless in the prevention of human disorders, from\r\nthe great difficulties in the way of carrying them out efficiently, are\r\nrecognised as of great value in controlling the propagation of cattle\r\nplagues. It is possible to control the movement of herds, and the\r\ngovernments of Central Europe have found it absolutely essential so to\r\ndo. Indeed, the ablest medical men who have written against the adoption\r\nof a quarantine system for human small-pox and cholera, such as\r\nProfessor Siegmund, of Berlin, acknowledge its value and absolute\r\nrequirement with regard to the Rinderpest. A professor from Galicia\r\nargued in favour of controlling the movements of people wherever the\r\ndisease appeared, and no fact seems to have been better ascertained than\r\nthat of the communication of the Rinderpest from herd to herd by human\r\nbeings. Professor Jessen, of Dorpat, states that in Russia the malady\r\nwas at one time speedily propagated by the people, who regarded the\r\ndestruction of their stock as a visitation of Providence, and who\r\nsummoned a priest into their stables to pray with them that the plague\r\nmight be stayed. Moving from farm to farm, the malady was by this means\r\nrapidly transmitted. In Hungary, many outbreaks result from people\r\ndressing the carcases and hawking about the meat, which, even where\r\nhuman beings remain uninjured, is deadly to the cattle whenever the\r\nwater with which it is washed is thrown about the yards, or the meat is\r\nhung up near sheds containing living animals.\r\n\r\nThe members present at the International Congress spoke in favour of\r\nestablishing a fund, apart from the Government grants, for the payment\r\nof diseased or infected animals which have to be slaughtered with a view\r\nto the prevention of the plague. Special precautions were suggested as\r\nto the transmission of articles the product of diseased animals.\r\n\r\n1. Perfectly dried skins, the points of horns cut off, as they often are\r\nfor commercial purposes, the salted and dried intestines of cattle,\r\nmelted tallow, wools, cowhair, &.c., could be freely allowed to pass\r\nunobserved.\r\n\r\n2. Entire horns, hoofs, &c., which are detached from the soft parts, but\r\nwhich often contain adhering flesh, &c., should be disinfected with\r\nchloride of lime.\r\n\r\n3. As melted tallow is often conveyed in bags which may be charged with\r\nthe poison, those bags should be washed with chloride of lime solution.\r\n\r\n4. Fresh bones, fresh skins, and intestines, unmelted tallow, raw flesh,\r\nand fresh sheepskins, should not be sold whenever the Rinderpest exists\r\nin a district.\r\n\r\nAccording to all the accounts which reach us, the foreign observations\r\nand resolutions may be of essential service in England. The members of\r\nthe Assembly were informed by Mr. Erner of the origin and the progress\r\nof the cattle plague in England, and were deeply interested by the\r\naccount given of the imminent danger in which many countries are placed\r\nthat purchase breeding stock in the British isles. The theories of\r\nspontaneous origin amuse the learned here not a little, as they justly\r\nthink we ought not to be so far behind every nation in the possession of\r\nknowledge regarding the propagation of such a disorder as the steppe\r\nmurrain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE E.\r\n\r\nNow, if the disease came from abroad, and diseased cattle were shipped\r\non the other side of the sea, no doubt the voyage would concentrate and\r\naggravate the disease. Whether the disease came from abroad or elsewhere\r\nhe was not able to state. Sir George Grey asked him whether he had found\r\nany disease among the foreign cattle that came into the market. He had\r\nnot one. He could only say they had had no cases, except in cows,\r\nwhether they came from the dairies in London or elsewhere. So far as\r\nthey knew, not one single bullock or ox had been condemned.--MR. GIBBINS,\r\n_18th August, Meeting at the Mansion House_.\r\n\r\nThe very first shed in which the plague must have appeared in London is\r\na pattern of cleanliness, and the stock was magnificent, as proved by\r\nthe animals in a shed to which the disease has not been propagated.\r\nAlmost simultaneously the malady broke out in the Essex marshes, and in\r\nevery instance we trace a more or less direct contamination by foreign\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE F.\r\n\r\n  VIENNA, August, 1865.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of August about thirty of the members of the Congress\r\naccepted an invitation to visit the renowned agricultural establishment\r\nat Altenburg, in Hungary. After the visitors had inspected the herds and\r\nother appurtenances of this institution, Professor Maasch, its director,\r\nintimated that the Rinderpest had appeared at Nickolsdorf, about four\r\nGerman miles from Altenburg. The President of the Congress had known\r\nthis fact before the party left Vienna for Hungary; but as he feared\r\nsome enthusiasts would first see the plague, and then inspect the\r\nAltenburg herds, he preferred to adopt the stratagem of communicating\r\nthe information through Professor Maasch, after the great Agricultural\r\nCollege of Hungary had been viewed. Nickolsdorf, where the steppe\r\nmurrain appeared on the 10th of August, is an exquisitely clean village,\r\nwith well-whitewashed buildings and broad roads, constituting the centre\r\nof a thriving agricultural district. Its people are typical Hungarians,\r\nnot too anxious to work, and, on the whole, poor; but they are\r\nintelligent, notwithstanding the national proclivity to farm a thousand\r\nacres badly rather than one-fourth the quantity to perfection. Their\r\nwants are not great, and their worldly luxuries, beyond potatoes and\r\nschnaps, are bought with the profits made on large herds of cattle. One\r\nherd only had suffered from the cattle plague when we visited the\r\nvillage. This herd consisted of 1225 animals, divided into three lots.\r\nThe affected portion numbered 450 animals--bullocks intended for work\r\nand slaughter--varying in age from three to seven years. The cows and\r\nheifers had not been smitten. The 450 animals amongst which the disease\r\nappeared were housed in no less than sixteen different sheds in\r\nNickolsdorf. Out of each of these places sick animals had been taken,\r\nand either slaughtered or permitted to die. We killed four for\r\ndissection on the 29th. Six more had been previously killed, their hides\r\nslacked, and the entire body buried; nine had died, and two we left in\r\nlife to be soon slaughtered and disposed of as the others. The district\r\nveterinary surgeon in constant attendance was an extremely active and\r\nintelligent man, who recognised the disease on its first outbreak, and\r\nadopted such measures for separation, destruction, and burial, as\r\nprevented the disease from spreading so rapidly as it has in England.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the outbreak was the intermingling of cattle-dealers' stock\r\nwith the Nickolsdorf herd; and although the animals which carried it\r\nhave not been fully traced, they are believed to have been owned by a\r\nbutcher who had purchased them in Comorn, where the malady is raging.\r\nSingular variations have been seen in the symptoms exhibited, especially\r\nwhen animals are first affected. During the Nickolsdorf outbreak there\r\nhas been an invariable incubation of five or six days; then furor or\r\ndelirium appears: the bullocks stare, roar, stamp with their feet, are\r\nprepared to attack people who approach them, and seem to be dizzy at\r\nintervals. They shiver, their muscles twitch, the eyes soon begin to\r\ndischarge, and the mucus which flows from the mouth foams. The pulse is\r\nat first slower than usual, until all the fever symptoms appear. There\r\nis more constipation than diarrhoea, though, on examination, the\r\nmucous membranes are all found to be affected precisely in the manner so\r\noften observed in England during the present outbreak. The differences\r\nin the symptoms are accounted for by peculiarities of breed, the\r\ncondition of stalls, the food the animals have lived on, and similar\r\ncircumstances. We may hear more of these Hungarian outbreaks, but the\r\nchances are we shall not witness in any part of Austria the wholesale\r\ndevastation now going on in Great Britain.--_International Veterinary\r\nCongress._\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE G.\r\n\r\nAt present the cowkeepers send off the infected beasts to the market, or\r\nto some slaughter-house, where they might be killed. There was believed\r\nto be great danger in allowing the infected cows to be driven through\r\nthe streets. If the good could be separated from the bad animals, and if\r\nthe latter could be conveyed to sanitoriums, where the medical men could\r\noperate upon them, then much benefit would result; and then, too, if the\r\nanimals died, they would be buried on the spot. All the professors were\r\nagreed in this, that if a compensation fund were raised, and the\r\ncowkeeper were told that he would be remunerated for his loss, he would\r\nat once inform the authorities when the disease made its appearance in\r\nhis cowshed. Shed after shed was being now shut up, and men and women\r\nwho seemed to be affluent one day were the next reduced to ruin. An\r\nillustration of this would suffice. One day last week a cowkeeper at\r\nPimlico had 70 or 80 healthy cows. On Wednesday three of them were found\r\ndead. On Thursday 42 of them were sent to the market. Of these 42 three\r\nshowed symptoms of the disease, and then the whole of the 42 beasts had\r\nto be slaughtered because of the disease being among the three. The poor\r\nfellow was thus ruined. Last Monday he sent nine more cows to the\r\nmarket, and these also had to be slaughtered. At present the man was\r\nabsolutely out of his mind. Out of his 70 beasts, he had not one left.\r\nSome persons were saying that the disease arose from bad water, bad\r\nventilation, and bad cowsheds; but in the case of Miss Burdett Coutts,\r\nwho had had 40 head of cattle, which were most carefully housed and\r\nattended to--particularly from the moment she heard that the disease was\r\namongst them--all were gone, with the exception of one cow; so that,\r\nwhether it was a want of water or a want of ventilation which in other\r\ncases caused it, this was an instance in which everything was done that\r\ncould be done, and yet the plague raged and the mortality\r\nensued.--MR. GIBBINS, _Meeting at the Mansion House_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE J.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning Dr. Jarvis, medical officer of St. Matthew's,\r\nBethnal-green, received information that Mr. Castell, an extensive\r\npurveyor of milk, had lost eighty-four cows during the past week. Other\r\ncowkeepers in this district have also experienced great losses. The\r\ndisease has manifested itself with more or less virulence at St. Anne's,\r\nLimehouse; St. John, Hackney: St. Mary-le-Bow, St. George's-in-the-East,\r\nSt. John, Wapping; Christ Church, Spitalfields; St. Leonard's,\r\nShoreditch; St. Mary, Whitechapel; St. Paul's, Shadwell; the hamlet of\r\nRatcliff, Stoke Newington, Kingsland, and Tottenham.\r\n\r\nMr. Gibbins, chairman of the Metropolitan Markets Committee, Mr. Rudkin,\r\na member of the committee, Mr. Tegg, veterinary surgeon to the market,\r\nand Mr. Baldry, clerk to the market, applied to the sitting magistrate\r\nat Clerkenwell Police Court yesterday for summonses against cowkeepers\r\nfor sending diseased cows into the market. During the course of the\r\npresent week no less than nineteen cows had been seized in the market\r\nand fairs and condemned. The order was asked for under the 8th section\r\nof the recent Order in Council, which recited that it shall not be\r\nlawful to send or bring to any fair or market, or to send or carry by\r\nany railway, or by any ship or vessel coastwise, or to place upon or to\r\ndrive along any highway, or the sides thereof, any animal labouring\r\nunder disease. The cattle seized had not been examined by a Government\r\ninspector, and no certificate had been given to the owners that they\r\nwere fit to be removed. The market authorities wished it to be known\r\nthat proceedings would be taken in every case that was brought under\r\ntheir notice. Mr. Cooke observed that the inspectors had power to seize\r\nand slaughter, or cause to be slaughtered, and to be buried in any\r\nconvenient place, any animal labouring under the disease. Had that been\r\ndone? Mr. Tegg said that the animals were in some of the cases\r\nslaughtered, and the others would be slaughtered in the course of the\r\nday. The summonses were granted.\r\n\r\nYesterday, the summonses issued at the instance of Mr. Frederick Thomas\r\nStanley, a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and one\r\nof the inspectors appointed under the Order in Council, came on for\r\nhearing before Mr. Burcham, magistrate at the Southwark police court.\r\nThe summons in the first case was addressed to Thomas Meredith, of the\r\nFlying Horse-yard, Blackman-street, for that the defendant, without the\r\nlicence of the said inspector, did unlawfully remove from his premises\r\nsome animals labouring under the cattle disease. Mr. Sleigh, instructed\r\nby Mr. Gant, appeared to support the summons; and Mr. W. Edwin for the\r\ndefendant. Evidence was given that the defendant had been warned that\r\nthe cows were diseased, but that he had removed them notwithstanding.\r\nThe further hearing of the case was adjourned, as were also the other\r\nsummonses of a like nature.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of powers vested in him by the Manx Legislature, the\r\ngovernor of the Isle of Man has issued a proclamation prohibiting the\r\nimportation of cattle into the island. Tinder the same Act his\r\nExcellency has power to subject all cattle imported into the island to a\r\nfive days' quarantine.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE K.\r\n\r\nTracing, as we have done, the sale of infected stock from abroad as far\r\nback as the 19th of June, we find that each week that the disease has\r\nbeen amongst us a fresh county has been contaminated; and more than that\r\nwhen we consider that Scotland has not escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE L.\r\n\r\nSCOTLAND.--The cattle plague has travelled North to Aberdeenshire, and\r\nhas killed a number of animals almost simultaneously on three farms at\r\nmany miles distance from one another. The owners of stock in one of the\r\ndistricts, and the Royal Northern Agricultural Association, are taking,\r\nor resolving to take, sharp and prompt steps to stay the progress of the\r\ndisease. The committee of the association having met on Friday,\r\nappointed a committee of inspection, arranged for a public meeting of\r\npersons interested, and favourably entertained the notion of forming a\r\nfund for mutual insurance against the sacrifices and losses which the\r\nextension of the disease might occasion. A meeting of the General\r\nCentral Union was also held at Stirling on Friday, and a committee was\r\nappointed to confer on the subject with the directors of the Highland\r\nSociety, and report to another meeting to be held next Friday.--\r\n_Scotsman._\r\n\r\nThe most important communication received to-day is from Scotland. The\r\nmalady has undoubtedly broken out near Kelso, on fourteen head of cattle\r\nimported into London and sent north. Twenty-eight animals have been\r\nseized with the disease at Woolwich, and calves from the London market\r\nare said to have taken the malady down to Horsham and Grinstead.\r\n\r\nInformation has been received concerning the sale of at least fifty-four\r\ndiseased and infected animals in the Metropolitan Cattle Market the 3rd\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE M.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Panter has, at the request of Earl Granville, drawn up a\r\nstatement relative to the health of the cows on a farm hired by his\r\nlordship at Golder's-green, on the Finchley-road. In publishing the\r\nstatement, Earl Granville says: \"When I left England, a month ago, there\r\nwere about 130 milch cows in four sheds. In the two largest and best\r\nmanaged I found only one cow yesterday (Sept. 4). His Royal Highness the\r\nDuke of Coburg informed me last week that what he believed to be the\r\nsame disease visited Coburg last year. No one could trace its origin,\r\nand no medical treatment was successful. Air and water were their only\r\nremedies. Some men had died from eating the meat killed at a particular\r\nstage of the disease. His Royal Highness had seen a horse die in four\r\nhours, killed by flies which came from the carcase of a cow which had\r\nbeen allowed to remain above ground. The disease disappeared in the\r\nautumn as mysteriously as it had come. I understand that Professor\r\nSimonds is of opinion that the disease mentioned by the Duke of Coburg\r\nis not the same as that from which we are suffering here--that its name\r\nis the Siberian Pest.\" Mr. Panter's statement is dated Sept. 4, and is\r\nas follows:--\"On the 13th of July I purchased five Dutch cows in the\r\nMetropolitan Market, and placed them in quarantine at Child's-hill Farm,\r\none mile from here. On the 22nd of July one of them showed signs of\r\ndebility; diarrhoea followed. Thinking it was only a cold, she was\r\ntreated accordingly, but continued to get worse, and died in five days.\r\nTwo more were attacked in a similar way, when veterinary advice was\r\ncalled in, but in five days the whole either died or were slaughtered.\r\nEvery precaution was used to prevent the spread of infection here; the\r\nmen who attended the sick cattle were not allowed to go among the\r\nhealthy ones, and _vice versâ_. But, previous to this, bearing of the\r\ndisease in the London cowsheds, I adopted precautionary measures, such\r\nas a liberal use daily of chloride of lime, administered one ounce of\r\nnitre in half a pint of water to each cow, and a small quantity of tar,\r\nand painted their noses with tar. But on the 8th of August,\r\nunfortunately, the disease showed itself here in a fat cow that had been\r\nfor ten months in the best built, best drained and ventilated shed. No\r\nnew stock had been added for nine weeks. In a few hours four more cows\r\nshowed symptoms of it. I immediately had them all removed and\r\nslaughtered, and made a _post-mortem_ examination of them, and found the\r\nwindpipe in a state of decomposition, the lungs inflated, the small\r\nintestines red and inflamed, and the meat of a dark yellow colour\r\noutside, and dark red inside, which I think unfit for human food after\r\nthe first stage. The disease confined itself to the above shed of\r\nforty-eight cows (which are now all gone) till the 20th of August, when\r\nit broke out in another shed of thirty-five cows, some ten yards from\r\nthe former one, and continued its ravages, taking from two to four cows\r\ndaily, till they are all gone but two, one of which has not been\r\nattacked; the other, which was a bad case, is cured, and partly come to\r\nher milk again. On the first symptoms I had her separated from the other\r\nstock, and did not treat her for two days, when diarrhoea set in; I\r\nthen gave her a bottle of brandy and four ounces of ground ginger in\r\nthree quarts of old ale. She lay in a kind of stupor for twelve hours,\r\nwhen I could see a change in her for the better. I continued to give her\r\ndaily four quarts of gruel made with old ale and two ounces of ginger.\r\nIn four days she was sufficiently recovered to eat a little hay, &c.,\r\nand do without further treatment. In another case the above treatment\r\nfailed, and the animal died in three days. In other cases I allowed\r\nanyone to treat them who thought they had a remedy, both professional\r\nmen and others. One persevering young veterinary surgeon came up out of\r\nSomersetshire and treated two cases most energetically, but failed in\r\nboth; one died in four, and the other in eight days. In other cases\r\ntonics, stimulants, blisters, and setons have been tried, but all\r\nfailed. The whole of the eighty-one cows lost were of the English breed;\r\nwe have not as yet had any loss out of the other two sheds, consisting\r\nof about half English and half Dutch cows, and standing about forty\r\nyards from the infected shed. It may be interesting for your lordship\r\nto know that I had the shed at Child's-hill Farm immediately cleansed\r\nwith disinfectants, and washed with hot lime, &c., and bought twelve\r\nfresh cows and placed them there on the 16th, which are now in perfect\r\nhealth; and a neighbour situated midway between here and that farm had\r\ntwenty-three cows lying in a field; the plague took twenty of them, and\r\nin three weeks he replaced them with new stock, which are still healthy,\r\nhe having had them a month. Another neighbour, a mile distant, had a\r\nfine herd of seventy-two cows (English) lying in the fields a fortnight\r\nago. The plague broke out among them, and now he has only eight left in\r\nhealth. From my own experience, and from all I can learn, I believe the\r\ndisease is atmospheric, and of a typhoid character. The first symptom in\r\na milking cow is an almost entire loss of milk, then loss of appetite, a\r\nwatery discharge from the eyes, nostrils, and mouth, which thickens as\r\nthe disease develops itself; rumination ceases, her ears hang down, her\r\neyes are heavy and sunken, bloody matter is seen in the excrement, great\r\ndebility is seen, diarrhoea sets in, and death takes place in from\r\nthree to nine days. I have read of iron water being a preventive of the\r\ndisease. All the water your cows have drunk comes six miles through\r\nrusty iron pipes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE N.\r\n\r\nTHE CATTLE MURRAIN AT HOLLY LODGE.--On the 27th of June an\r\nAlderney bull was purchased at Bushey, near Watford, and placed with the\r\nrest of the herd, then consisting of eleven cows, five sucking calves,\r\nthree yearling heifers, and one bull. The bull had been imported from\r\nAlderney for several months. About a month after--namely, on the 29th of\r\nJuly--a cow in calf was attacked with unusual symptoms. She was\r\nseparated from the rest; nourishing drinks were administered; but having\r\ncalved, she died forty-eight hours after the first symptoms were\r\nobserved. This led to the belief that she died of the disease which then\r\nbegan to prevail. This cow had been pastured with the others in a field\r\noccasionally used for grazing sheep that were taken to the Metropolitan\r\nCattle-market, and, if not sold, brought back again until the next\r\nmarket day; the sheep were separated from the cows by iron hurdles. The\r\nHolly Lodge Estate is partly bounded on the east by the route taken by\r\ndrovers with foreign and other cattle to and from the market, some of\r\nwhich are also occasionally brought back to neighbouring fields. The\r\nhigh road forms the western boundary within a few yards of the\r\ncattle-sheds and pastures. These facts are stated to show that the\r\ncontagion might have been easily communicated to the animals. A few days\r\nlater three calves were attacked with cold shivering and twitching of\r\nthe muscles. The previous nights having become suddenly and unusually\r\ncold and wet, the symptoms were at first attributed to that cause.\r\nAlthough these calves had been pastured quite apart from the cow which\r\nfirst died, the cow had been driven across the field where the calves\r\nlay to the shed in which it died, the calves having been placed in the\r\nnext shed, where two of them died on the 6th of August, unmistakeably\r\nof the cattle plague. The third calf was sent to the Royal Veterinary\r\nCollege, where it also died. By the 9th of August four cows and the bull\r\nwere seized with the disease so virulently that it was thought necessary\r\nto kill them after three days' illness. On the 12th a cow and a heifer\r\nwere also destroyed, and on the 14th one of the sucking calves died.\r\nThus, out of a herd of nineteen animals, twelve had died within a\r\nfortnight. The malady had taken so strong and sudden a hold upon them\r\nthat no systematic means of remedy could be applied except separation,\r\nwarmth, stimulants, and the medicines ordinarily given in cases of cold\r\nand fever. On the 13th of August two more cows were pronounced incurable\r\nby two of the veterinary surgeons who had been called in; but it was\r\ndetermined, upon further advice, to try a mode of treatment upon them\r\nnot hitherto adopted. One drachm of calomel was administered in gruel,\r\nfour hours afterwards one pint of castor oil, and three hours later one\r\nquart of yeast. About two quarts of warm porter were added to a gruel of\r\nyeast and oatmeal, and given at intervals. These remedies acted most\r\nefficiently, and in one case gave much encouragement. The next day the\r\ncow began to eat hay, to chew her cud, and to yield a good quantity of\r\nmilk. These remedies, together with bi-sulphate of soda, which\r\ninvariably produced a return of the milk, and quinine, were then tried\r\nupon four other patients, with varied success. But in the end all these\r\ncows died, not, it is believed, of the cattle murrain, but of exhaustion\r\noccasioned by the activity of the drugs administered to them. This\r\nbelief was strengthened by the healthy appearance presented by the\r\nviscera of the first cow thus experimented upon, on its being partially\r\ndissected after death. The remaining cow thus treated is still alive. It\r\nis impossible to avoid believing that had the medical man who kindly\r\ngave his attention to these animals, been better acquainted with the\r\nconstitution of the creature, or had those who tended them had any\r\nknowledge of medicine, three of the cows treated in this manner might\r\nand probably would have recovered; and even when the animals succumbed\r\nthe consequences were less serious, the virulence of the poison being\r\nexpelled--at least it was undiscernible to those who dissected them.\r\nDuring the fortnight that the murrain was raging, one cow in calf and\r\none calf remained perfectly healthy, apparently, until both were seized\r\nwithin a day of each other; these had always been kept separate from the\r\nsick animals, and tended by other men. The calf died, and the cow was\r\ndestroyed, in consequence of the symptoms being so violent. In this case\r\nvery little calomel was given. As it may be as well to mention all\r\nparticulars, it may be stated here that the men who tended the animals\r\nwere provided with a dress, and that it was found desirable that a\r\ncertain quantity of stimulants--brandy, coffee, and strong soup--should\r\nbe given to prevent nausea and other uncomfortable feelings from which\r\nthe men suffered. All the directions respecting the burying of the\r\nanimals issued by the Privy Council have been strictly complied with;\r\nclothes, &c., have been burnt, chloride of lime (Macdougall's\r\ndisinfectant) was used with others to destroy insects and flies, with\r\nabundance of white-washing. The men were recommended to use, as a wash\r\nfor the mouth, manganate of potash. The first crop of grass in the field\r\nwhere the cattle lay before their sickness, and during it, has been\r\ndestroyed also; and it is intended to use some disinfectant, such as\r\ncharcoal or lime, to spread over the field. Miss B. C. feels so\r\npersuaded that some mode of treatment could be found to alleviate, if\r\nnot to save life, that she has determined to employ a medical gentleman,\r\nwho kindly offers his services, and to take also the advice of a good\r\ncow or veterinary surgeon, and to try the effects of various remedies in\r\nsome of the cowsheds where persons will be glad to let such experiments\r\nbe tried; and it is also her intention to ask the Privy Council to allow\r\none of the Government Inspectors to assist and report upon the cases. It\r\nmay not be altogether unimportant to add that the state of the\r\natmosphere seemed to have some effect upon the health of the animals, as\r\nupon those occasions the symptoms were most severe during the\r\nthunder-storms which then occurred. The milk which returned was found to\r\nbe rather watery, and the cream had a peculiar appearance. At first the\r\npigs declined it, and it was not thought advisable to continue to give\r\nit at all to any animals for about a week. It is now perfectly good.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE O.\r\n\r\nAdvices from Holland, dated the Hague, Sept. 6, state: \"The cattle\r\ndisease has now been observed in the parishes of Kethel, Delfshaven,\r\nMoordrecht, Uaardingen, Averschie, Kvalingen, Nieuwerkerk on the Issel\r\n(two hours from Rotterdam), Spykenisse, Schiedam, Herrjansdam, Maasland,\r\nSommelsdyk, and Zevenhuisen. It has spread most at Kethel, where it\r\nfirst broke out among a cargo of cattle not admitted into England. In\r\nthe other parishes some sixty animals were infected on the 1st inst. The\r\npost-mortem examination of the diseased beasts presents the abnormal\r\nappearances that have been found in the disease elsewhere, _i.e._,\r\nswollen mucous membranes with red spots, peculiar exudations in the\r\nfourth stomach and intestines, &c. The medical commission declares the\r\nmalady to be the _typhus contagiosus bovum_ of modern veterinary\r\nsurgery, and recommends that infected animals should be treated with\r\nfrom three to four drachms of muriatic acid, mixed with six ounces of\r\ntreacle and decoction of linseed. Decoctions of Peruvian bark and osier\r\npeelings, with sulphuric ether, are also said to be beneficial to weak\r\nanimals. The avoidance of all contact of the cattle-tenders with\r\ninfected beasts is especially enjoined, and ventilation and cleanliness\r\nof the stalls strongly recommended. Cattle markets and fairs are\r\nsuspended until further orders, and extraordinary measures for\r\ndisinfection are applied upon steamboats and railways.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE P.\r\n\r\nThe following document has been received at the Foreign Office from her\r\nMajesty's Agent and Consul-General at Bucharest:--\r\n\r\n(_Translation from the Official \"Monitoral,\" No. 173, August 8-20,\r\n1865._)\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIRECTION OF THE SANITARY SERVICE.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1st to the 15th July a typhus epizooty broke out among the\r\nlarge horned cattle in the districts of Ilfov, Jassy, Bolgrad, Falcin,\r\nBuzeo, and Roman, which still continues, but is on the decrease.

Addressing the magistrate (Mr. Burnham) Mr.\r\nEbsworth said that on that morning he, in his capacity of medical\r\nofficer of health for the parish of St. Mary, Newington, received an\r\norder to attend professionally a man who was seriously ill in\r\nKent-street, within the parish. While paying the visit to the patient\r\nhis attention had been drawn to the condition of a slaughter-house on\r\nthe other side of the street, where it was reported to him there were\r\nfifteen cows which had been ordered by the Government officer to be\r\ndestroyed at the Bricklayers' Arms Station, and then to be buried. The\r\nanimals were accordingly destroyed by the men in the employ of Mr.\r\nGeorge Nicholls, the proprietor of the yard in question; and from Mr.\r\nNicholls he had learned that, instead of the carcases of the animals\r\nbeing buried, they were carted through the parish of St. George's to\r\nMitcham, where they were boiled down, and brought back through the\r\nparish of St. Mary, Newington, in the shape of cats'-meat. He (Mr.\r\nEbsworth) felt it his duty to come before the magistrate with this\r\ncomplaint, especially when the cattle plague was so prevalent. He had a\r\nright to inquire upon what grounds the carcases had not been disposed of\r\non the spot where they had been slaughtered, instead of being carted\r\nthrough the parish he represented, in a way calculated to spread the\r\ninfection. He could not but regard this as a most iniquitous proceeding,\r\nand he attended with a view to prevent a repetition of the practice. Mr.\r\nFrederick T. Stanley presented himself, and said that he was a member of\r\nthe Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. He had been appointed an\r\ninspector of cattle under the orders issued by the Privy Council. Within\r\nthe district there were no means of burying the carcases of the diseased\r\nand condemned animals, and in the instance referred to they could not\r\nhave been buried in the cowshed. It was impossible to bury the carcases\r\nin the London districts, and hence they were sent to the knacker's yard,\r\nwhere it was supposed they would be disposed of. Mr. Ebsworth: And\r\nthat, your worship, is what I complain of. Mr. Burcham: You think that\r\nthe practice to which you have called my attention is calculated to\r\npropagate the extension of the disease. Mr. Stanley declared that the\r\nskins were disinfected under his especial orders. Mr. Burcham remarked\r\nthat the animals had been taken to the slaughter-house, not for the\r\npurpose of being killed and buried, but that their skins should be taken\r\noff and disinfected. Why should they have been taken to Mitcham? Mr.\r\nStanley stated that the disease could not be communicated from a dead\r\nanimal, and it was conveyed only by inoculation, or through the breath\r\nof a living animal upon the dead body of a diseased ox. Mr. Burcham: I\r\ndo not agree with you in that opinion. I believe that infection may be\r\nconveyed by a dead animal. Mr. Ebsworth said that such was his opinion,\r\nand, having regard to 28,000 patients in the parish, he had felt it his\r\nbounden duty to come forward to make this complaint. He thought such\r\nthings ought not to occur. Mr. Burcham was of the same opinion, and that\r\nsuch a commodity ought not to be allowed to be conveyed through the\r\npublic streets in open carts. Just before the magistrate was about to\r\nrise, Mr. Stanley introduced to his worship Professor Simonds, and a\r\nlong colloquy (in private) ensued between them. At its close Professor\r\nSimonds retired, and Mr. Burcham said: I wish to state that I wanted to\r\nbe satisfied that everything was done by Mr. Stanley that could be done\r\nunder the circumstances by which he was surrounded, in the midst of\r\ngreat difficulty. I have had an interview with Professor Simonds, and he\r\ninforms me that there are the greatest difficulties, if not\r\nimpossibilities, in finding any places near London in which the dead\r\ncarcases of diseased animals can be buried. In the case now before me\r\nthese animals were slaughtered at the Bricklayers' Arms Station, and\r\nwere then taken to the slaughter-house in Kent-street, under the notion\r\nthat the owner of the slaughter-house had the means of boiling them\r\ndown. It appears that he had no such apparatus, and hence he found it\r\nnecessary to send the carcases to Mitcham, the nearest place at which he\r\nbelieved the carcases could be buried and disposed of, and the\r\nneighbourhood thereby disinfected. Professor Simonds is perfectly sure\r\nthat this meat when boiled down cannot by any probability cause the\r\ninfection to spread. It was possible, but not probable, that infection\r\nmight be introduced by the carcases of the diseased animals on their way\r\nto the place where they had to be boiled down; but it appears to me,\r\nfrom what I have just heard, that every precaution has been taken to\r\nprevent such an occurrence. It seems that the authorities cannot find a\r\nplace within a reasonable distance in which the carcases can be buried,\r\nand, therefore, they are obliged to have recourse to boiling them down,\r\nas the only alternative. It is right that I should add that the conduct\r\nof Mr. Stanley, the inspector, has been quite in conformity with the\r\ndirections he has received, not only under the Orders in Council, but\r\nalso sanctioned in my presence to-day by Professor Simonds. I trust that\r\nthis statement will remove from the mind of Mr. Stanley any unfavourable\r\nimpression he may have entertained; and I will only add my opinion, that\r\nthe diseased cattle ought to be removed through these populous\r\ndistricts in closed and not in open carts. The conversation then closed,\r\nand at an unusually late hour the court adjourned.\r\n\r\nDISEASED MEAT.--At the Thames Police Court yesterday Henry\r\nFrost, an old man, was charged with having allowed to be deposited on\r\nthe premises occupied by him in the rear of the house, No. 13,\r\nSidney-street, Stepney, four quarters of beef prepared for sale and\r\nintended for the food of man, but which was unfit for human food. Frost\r\ncarried on the business of a greengrocer. He asserted that he let the\r\nplace to other men, who were the actual offenders. It was intimated that\r\nthe vestry had no disposition to press for a heavy penalty. Mr. Paget\r\nfined the prisoner 40s. At Clerkenwell, Mr. Tegg, inspector at the\r\nMetropolitan Cattle Market for the City authorities applied to Mr.\r\nD'Eyncourt for an order to destroy a quantity of diseased meat which he\r\npurposed seizing. Mr. D'Eyncourt said the meat must be actually seized\r\nand condemned upon evidence before he could make the order. In the\r\nmatter of the seizure of 32 quarters of beef, weighing about 3000 lbs.,\r\nwhich was found on the premises of a knacker in Pleasant-grove,\r\nBelle-isle, Mr. D'Eyncourt dismissed an application made against the\r\ndefendant under the Nuisances Removal Act. The defence set up was that\r\nthe meat was recognised as bad and diseased by the killer as soon as the\r\nanimals were slaughtered.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE S.\r\n\r\nThe Orders in Council seemed only to complicate the matter, and how\r\neffectually to combat the evil was a most difficult question. Some said\r\nthe grand remedy was the knife, and others suggested that the diseased\r\nanimals should be sent to a sanatorium. To destroy the diseased cattle\r\nwas impossible, except the owner of them or the inspector went round and\r\nobtained an order from a magistrate for their destruction. The last\r\nmeeting was adjourned, among other purposes, in order that the committee\r\nmight take the opinion of the law officers upon the subject. It so\r\nhappened, however, that most of the law officers of the Corporation were\r\nat present out of town. Fortunately the Common Serjeant was found, and\r\nhe gave an opinion which confirmed the committee in their view that they\r\nhad no power to kill, and no power to do anything except in the matter\r\nof isolation. Then the committee passed a resolution that another\r\ncommittee ought to be formed to raise the necessary funds for\r\ncompensating the cattle-owners, and to see that those funds were\r\nproperly applied, for the money was only intended to apply to the cattle\r\nplague, and was not meant to go in the shape of compensation for\r\npleuro-pneumonia, or for the foot diseases. In other words, they were\r\nnow legislating for the cattle plague or Rinderpest only. He resided at\r\nDulwich, and he found that in the villages adjoining there were many\r\ncows, and never in his life had he seen finer cows. Not one of them had\r\nbeen affected by the disease. There was a cowkeeper at Peckham who had\r\n200 cows, and all of them were in the most healthy state. At Brixton\r\nHill a man had 30 cows in the same excellent condition. At Dulwich\r\nnearly all the cows were diseased, but there the shed and other\r\naccommodation was exceedingly bad. In parts of Peckham Rye some of the\r\ncowkeepers had lost their cattle, but there again the places were badly\r\nventilated, and the cows were badly cared for. He believed that the\r\ndisease might be prevented by the use of proper precautions on the part\r\nof those who had the greatest interest in keeping their cows in a\r\nhealthy state. He believed, too, that this question affected the whole\r\nof the metropolitan district quite as much as it did the City itself.\r\nThere were no fewer than 106 head of diseased cattle lately seized; but,\r\nas he said before, they could not be killed without an order from a\r\nmagistrate, and a magistrate would naturally feel a difficulty in\r\nissuing an order to kill so many as 106 head. It was necessary, under\r\nsuch circumstances, that a deputation should wait upon the Home\r\nSecretary and ask him to provide a remedy, and tell the authorities what\r\nthey were to do at such a crisis. If, as it now appeared, the inspectors\r\nand the markets' committee had been slaughtering beasts without\r\nauthority, who was to pay the costs should proceedings against them be\r\ncommenced? Professor Simonds seemed to think that next session a bill of\r\nindemnity would be introduced, and certainly something of this kind was\r\nrendered necessary, for cattle were now coming here which were consigned\r\nto A., B., and C., and then the owners could not be found, and without\r\nthe consent of the owners the diseased beasts could not be killed. The\r\nnext subject in the report had reference to slaughter-houses. As there\r\nwere no places at present to which cattle in an incipient stage of the\r\ndisease could be removed from the sheds in which they were placed along\r\nwith untainted cattle, it was now proposed that slaughter-houses should\r\nbe established in London for their reception. Then came the question,\r\nhow were the beasts to be removed from the sheds to the\r\nslaughter-houses? It was the opinion of many that they ought to be\r\nremoved in vans, and not driven through the streets; but, however that\r\nmight be, slaughter-houses should be erected in the metropolis where the\r\ntainted animals might be killed. Then came the question, how was an\r\nanimal to be dealt with when first stricken with the disease? It was\r\nsuggested that hospitals or sanatoriums should be provided, to which the\r\nbeasts should be sent. But this was a matter of great importance, to\r\nwhich the attention of the committee to be appointed and that of the\r\nmedical men would have to be directed. If the plague went on it would\r\naffect all classes, rich and poor alike, and instead of meat being as\r\nnow at a reasonable rate, it would go up 4_d._ or 6_d._ per pound; but\r\nhe had hopes that the disease might be checked, particularly as\r\nProfessors Simonds and Gamgee had been more successful in the treatment\r\nof it than they had previously been.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE T.\r\n\r\nAugust 31.\r\n\r\nDEPUTATION TO THE HOME OFFICE.--Yesterday afternoon the Lord\r\nMayor proceeded from the Mansion House to the Home Office, and had an\r\ninterview with Mr. Waddington on the subject of the cattle plague, and\r\nthe desirability of establishing hospitals or sanatoriums within the\r\nmetropolitan districts for the reception and medical treatment of\r\ndiseased cattle. His lordship was accompanied on the occasion by the\r\nfollowing deputation from the Markets and Cattle Plague Committees:--Mr.\r\nGibbins (Chairman of the Markets Committee), Mr. Webber, Mr. Gower, Mr.\r\nBrewster, Mr. Rudkin, and Dr. Jarvis (the Medical Officer of Health for\r\nBethnal-green). Sir George Grey having left London for Falloden.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor introduced the deputation to Mr. Waddington, and in doing\r\nso, said that their object was to obtain the sanction of Government to\r\nthe establishment of hospitals or sanatoriums within the metropolitan\r\ndistricts, to which diseased cattle could be conveyed from the cowsheds\r\nin order that they might there receive medical treatment, and be, if\r\npossible, restored to health. He observed that similar establishments\r\nhad been formed at Edinburgh and other large towns, and that they had\r\nbeen found to work most satisfactorily, not only in separating the\r\ndiseased cattle from those which were non-diseased, but in affording\r\nfacilities to the medical profession to exercise their skill and\r\nknowledge under circumstances more favourable to a fair trial of both\r\nthan they could expect to find in crowded cowsheds, many of which were\r\nin a filthy condition and badly ventilated. He pointed out the progress\r\nthe plague had made, and was still making, in the metropolis, and how\r\nits effects upon the high price of meat and milk were affecting all\r\nclasses of the community. The difficulties, he said, of adequately\r\nmeeting the necessities of the case were at present very great, and some\r\nof these consisted in the alleged illegality of slaughtering diseased\r\nanimals without an order from a magistrate, and also the illegality of\r\nremoving those diseased from the cowsheds to the hospitals, supposing\r\nthe latter to exist. But he hoped the Government, who had no doubt well\r\nconsidered a subject of such vast importance, would speedily do away\r\nwith those difficulties, and render the fullest aid to the Markets'\r\nCommittee and Metropolitan Cattle Plague Committee, who were unceasingly\r\ndevoting their time and attention to mitigate, and, if possible, put an\r\nend to the evil. At present, however, the object of the deputation was\r\nlimited to that of obtaining the sanction of the Government to the\r\nestablishment of the hospitals or sanatoriums. This was an object which\r\nhad not only received the general approval of the two committees\r\nmentioned, but also of the medical profession, and he might add, what it\r\nwas by no means unimportant to bear in mind, that the cowkeepers\r\nthemselves and the salesmen of the Cattle Market were also in favour of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. Gibbins and the several members of the deputation corroborated what\r\nhad fallen from the Lord Mayor, and strongly advocated the necessity of\r\nhaving the hospitals speedily established.\r\n\r\nMr. Rudkin called the attention of Mr. Waddington to the fact that the\r\nday before there were fourteen diseased cows seized at the\r\nslaughter-house of the Cattle Market, which had been sent there from the\r\ncowsheds of the metropolis. He argued that this in itself was a proof\r\nthat the Order in Council, as at present carried out, was insufficient\r\nto prevent diseased cows from being sent from the cowsheds by their\r\nowners to be slaughtered for human food.\r\n\r\nMr. Waddington, who listened very attentively to the whole of the\r\nstatements, said he would take an early opportunity of communicating\r\nwith Sir George Grey upon the subject. In the first instance, however,\r\nhe wished the deputation to forward to him their views in writing, and\r\nthese also would be transmitted to the Home Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe deputation promised to comply with the suggestion, and thanked Mr.\r\nWaddington for the courtesy with which he had received and the patience\r\nwith which he had listened to them.\r\n\r\nYORKSHIRE.--The plague has extended to this district. The cases\r\nreported, however, are extremely few, and precautions are being taken\r\nwhich it is hoped may stop the further progress of the disease. On\r\nTuesday a meeting of the Yorkshire Medical Veterinary Society was held\r\nat Leeds, and the question was discussed in all its bearings. It was\r\nstated that four cases had occurred in Leeds, and the disease has also\r\nappeared in the Skyrack division of the Riding. The general result of\r\nthe discussion was, that members of the society were recommended, when\r\ndiseased cattle were submitted, not to order them to be killed, but to\r\nplace them in a sanatorium for medicinal treatment; the wholesale\r\ndestruction of the animals being regarded as a blot upon the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE V.\r\n\r\nIndeed, information has reached us of the disease existing in\r\nDumfriesshire, but there is some doubt on this point. So long as we hear\r\nof infected, or probably infected, cattle being disseminated in large\r\nnumbers from the great markets of the country, we must have the\r\npropagation of the malady. For the welfare of this country, it is deeply\r\nto be regretted that our Government cannot deal with this question as\r\nContinental authorities do. _I regret to say some of our neighbours\r\nlaugh at our expense._ They see us helpless owing to the wretched state\r\nof our laws on the subject, and they are not a little amused at the\r\ntheories of spontaneous development of the disease which some still\r\nadvocate. The French Emperor has sent over Professor Bouley, who is\r\nstill in this country, and who telegraphed on his first arrival, about\r\nten days ago, that the ports of France should be instantly closed to\r\nBritish cattle. This has been done, and we may depend upon it the French\r\npeople will not suffer as we now must.--GAMGEE, _Lettre du 24 Août_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE Y.\r\n\r\nAugust 16.\r\n\r\nMORE SEIZURES OF DISEASED MEAT.--Yesterday Mr. Paget, in the\r\ncourse of the proceedings at the Thames Police Court, was informed that\r\nthere was a large quantity of meat in a van in the police-yard\r\nadjoining, which had been seized that day by Mr. J. Stevens, the\r\nsanitary inspector of Mile-end Old Town, and which was described as\r\nunfit for human food. The inspector stated, that in consequence of\r\nhaving been informed that there was a quantity of diseased meat at the\r\nshop of Mr. Frost, butcher, Sydney-street, Mile-end Old Town, he went\r\nthere that morning, and found four quarters of beef (two fore and two\r\nhind quarters) which were from a diseased beast. He made a seizure of\r\nthem, and heard that the animal had been sent by a person of the name of\r\nStephens, a cowkeeper in business on Bow-common. The meat was in a very\r\nnasty state, and totally unfit for human food. (Mr. Paget went into the\r\npolice-yard to examine the meat, which was in a very shocking state.)\r\nDr. Freeman, Medical Officer of Health of the Hamlet of Mile-end Old\r\nTown, stated that his attention was called to the state of the meat by\r\nthe sanitary inspector. He examined it, and gave his opinion that it\r\nshould be destroyed, as it was not only in a diseased condition, but he\r\nbelieved that it had died from some disease. Mr. Paget: Can you state\r\nthe nature of the disease which caused its death?--Witness: I cannot.\r\nMost likely it was the prevailing epidemic; and if it were eaten it\r\nwould be very injurious. Mr. Paget, after hearing the evidence, ordered\r\nthat the meat should be immediately destroyed, when the inspector took\r\nthe van with its contents to a knacker's yard to see the order carried\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE Z.\r\n\r\nNEFARIOUS ATTEMPT TO SPREAD THE PLAGUE.--Yesterday Mr. Gifford,\r\nSanitary Inspector to the parish of Paddington, asked (at Marylebone\r\nPolice Court) for the magistrate's advice under the following\r\ncircumstances:--Applicant said that, in consequence of information\r\nreceived, he yesterday went to a cowshed situate on the Maryland Farm,\r\nHarrow-road. He found the door fastened. On looking through one of the\r\nchinks, he saw a cow which apparently was in the worst stage of the now\r\nprevailing disease, and his opinion was verified after he had burst open\r\nthe door and examined the animal. He subsequently ascertained that the\r\ndiseased cow had been brought some distance by a man who was at feud\r\nwith the owner of the Maryland Farm, and surreptitiously placed amongst\r\nthe healthy cattle. This was the first case where the disease had shown\r\nitself in the parish of Paddington. Mr. Yardley referred the applicant\r\nto the Order in Council, dated the 24th of July, 1865, under which he\r\nthought inspectors of nuisances had power to act summarily.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON:\r\n  SAVILL AND EDWARDS, PRINTERS, CHANDOS STREET,\r\n  COVENT GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |             Transcriber's Note:               |\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    | Inconsistent hyphenation and spelling in the  |\r\n    | original document have been preserved.        |\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    | Greek words are transliterated and marked     |\r\n    | +like so+                                     |\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    | Typographical errors corrected in the text:   |\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    | Page  62  Ge11e changed to Gellé              |\r\n    | Page  67  Bruneleschi changed to Brunelleschi |\r\n    | Page 142  Röol changed to Röll                |\r\n    | Page 175  charboneux changed to charbonneux   |\r\n    | Page 253  eat changed to ate                  |\r\n    | Page 354  lairs changed to fairs              |\r\n    | Page 377  Boulay changed to Bouley            |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+",
