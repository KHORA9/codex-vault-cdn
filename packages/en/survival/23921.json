From a want of attention to the barometer, they\r\n    have either closed the land (if at sea), or have put to sea (being\r\n    in harbour in safety) at improper times; and in consequence of such\r\n    want of precaution the ships have been lost, owing to bad weather\r\n    coming on suddenly, which might have been avoided had proper\r\n    attention been paid to that very simple instrument. While alluding\r\n    to the use of barometers, I may remark, that if such weather-glasses\r\n    were put in charge of the Coast-guard, at the principal stations\r\n    round the coast, so placed as to allow any one passing by to look at\r\n    them, they might be the means, not only of preventing ships from\r\n    going to sea just before bad weather was coming on, but of\r\n    preventing the great losses of life which take place every year on\r\n    our coasts (particularly in the Orkney Islands and on the coasts of\r\n    Scotland and Ireland), owing to fishing vessels and boats going to\r\n    sea when bad weather is impending. No bad weather ever comes on our\r\n    coasts without timely warning being given by the barometer. The\r\n    oldest seaman are often deceived by the look of the weather, but\r\n    there is no instance on record of very bad weather, such as would\r\n    have involved loss of life to the extent we have heard of in several\r\n    years, having come on without the barometer having given timely\r\n    warning. By the very small expense of an establishment of\r\n    barometers, so placed as to be accessible to any fishermen, boatmen,\r\n    or others on the coasts, much loss of life, as well as loss of\r\n    boats, and even shipping, might be prevented.\r\n\r\n    \"What state of the barometer indicates danger?--It varies in\r\n    different climates according to the range. The range is small\r\n    between the tropics, but very large in the higher latitudes. In our\r\n    climate the range is usually about two inches. The barometer falling\r\n    considerably below its average height is at once an indication that\r\n    some considerable change is going to take place, and when it falls\r\n    low, as for instance (in our climate) to near 29 inches, or below 29\r\n    inches, a gale is certain to follow.\r\n\r\n    \"Are the Committee to understand that you are of opinion that every\r\n    ship ought to have a barometer on board?--I think that every ship\r\n    ought to have either a barometer or sympiesometer, which is an\r\n    efficient substitute for a barometer.\r\n\r\n    \"Does the barometer show a sudden change of wind as well as the\r\n    coming on of bad weather? Supposing a gale of wind is blowing, and\r\n    you are sailing with a fair wind, does the barometer show any change\r\n    of wind?--Decidedly.\r\n\r\n    \"Supposing the wind was at West-north-west and it shifted suddenly\r\n    to West-south-west, would the barometer indicate that?--It requires\r\n    some practice to be able to say _exactly what is likely to take\r\n    place_ after a change in the barometer; but the principal point for\r\n    a seaman is, that no violent wind will blow without the barometer\r\n    giving warning. He may not know exactly from what quarter the wind\r\n    will come, but no strong wind will come on without warning being\r\n    given.\r\n\r\n    \"You recommend that at the Coast-guard stations there should be a\r\n    barometer, by means of which people would know when a violent wind\r\n    was coming on; but as it would not indicate the quarter from which\r\n    it was coming, would you have the merchant ship always remain in\r\n    port till the barometer showed fine weather?--Being accustomed to\r\n    the barometer on our coast, one could tell from what quarter the\r\n    wind would probably come by the height of the barometer, taken in\r\n    connexion with its previous height, and the state of the weather,\r\n    and the strength of winds that had prevailed before. Taking the\r\n    state of the barometer in connexion with the appearance of the\r\n    weather one could make a satisfactory conclusion as to the quarter\r\n    from which any violent wind would come. And the barometer, after\r\n    very little practice, can be used by any man. There is no difficulty\r\n    in using it sufficiently to know that danger is coming on; and if\r\n    danger is coming on, a man refrains, of course, from exposing\r\n    himself to it; the quarter from which the wind comes being of minor\r\n    consequence.\r\n\r\n    \"With a North-easterly wind, in this part of the world, the\r\n    barometer stands, on an average, about half an inch higher than with\r\n    the same strength of wind from the South-westward. All over the\r\n    world there is a similar difference proportionate to the range of\r\n    the mercury for which allowance should always be made in considering\r\n    the height of the barometer.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn the first Number of Meteorological Papers, published by the Board of\r\nTrade, 1857, is the following passage respecting the use of\r\nweather-glasses:--\r\n\r\n    \"The variety of interesting and useful, if not always important,\r\n    subjects included within the range of meteorology, is not perhaps\r\n    sufficiently realized in the minds of active participators in the\r\n    world's stirring work. Irrespective of any scientific object, how\r\n    much utility is there to all classes in what is commonly called\r\n    'weather wisdom'? In our variable climate, with a maritime\r\n    population, numbers of small vessels, and especially fishing boats,\r\n    how much life and property is risked unnecessarily by every\r\n    unforeseen storm? Even animals, birds, and insects have a presaging\r\n    instinct, perhaps a bodily feeling, that warns them; but man often\r\n    neglects his perceptive and reasoning powers; neither himself\r\n    observes, nor attends to the observations of others, unless special\r\n    inclination or circumstances stimulate attention to the subject.\r\n    Agriculturists, it is true, use weather-glasses: the sportsman knows\r\n    their value for indicating a good or bad scenting day; but the\r\n    coasting vessel puts to sea, the Shetland fisherman casts his nets,\r\n    without the benefit of such a monitor, and perhaps without the\r\n    weather wisdom which only a few possess, and cannot transfer to\r\n    others.\r\n\r\n    \"Difficult as it is to foretell weather accurately, much useful\r\n    foresight may be acquired by combining the indications of\r\n    instruments (such as the barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer)\r\n    with atmospheric appearances. What is more varying than the aspect\r\n    of the sky? Colour, tint of clouds, their soft or hard look, their\r\n    outline, size, height, direction, all vary rapidly, yet each is\r\n    significant. There is a peculiar aspect of the clouds before and\r\n    during westerly winds which differs from that which they have\r\n    previous to and during easterly winds, which is one only of the many\r\n    curious facts connected with the differing natures of easterly and\r\n    westerly currents of air throughout the world, which remain\r\n    unchanged, whether they blow from sea to land, or the reverse.[2]\r\n\r\n    \"Perhaps some of those who make much use of instruments rather\r\n    undervalue popular knowledge, and are reluctant to admit that a\r\n    'wise saw' may be valuable as well as a 'modern instance;' while\r\n    less informed persons who use weather-glasses unskilfully too often\r\n    draw from them erroneous conclusions, and then blame the barometer.\r\n\r\n    \"Not only are reliable weather-glasses required at the smaller\r\n    outlying ports and fishing places, but plain, easily intelligible\r\n    directions for using them should be accessible to the seafaring\r\n    population, so that the masters of small vessels, and fishermen,\r\n    might be forewarned of coming changes in time to prepare for them,\r\n    and thus become instrumental in saving much property and many\r\n    lives.\"\r\n\r\n_June 1858._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO FORETELL WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamiliar as the practical use of weather-glasses is, at sea as well as\r\non land, only those who have long watched their indications, and\r\ncompared them carefully, are really able to conclude more than that the\r\nrising glass[3] USUALLY foretells less wind or rain, a falling barometer\r\nmore rain or wind, or both; a high one fine weather, and a low, the\r\ncontrary. But useful as these general conclusions are _in most cases_,\r\nthey are _sometimes_ erroneous, and then remarks may be rather hastily\r\nmade, tending to discourage the inexperienced.\r\n\r\nBy attention to the following observations (the results of many years'\r\npractice and many persons' experience) any one not accustomed to use a\r\nbarometer may do so without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe barometer shows whether the air[4] is getting lighter or heavier, or\r\nis remaining in the same state. The quicksilver falls as the air becomes\r\nlighter, rises as it becomes heavier, and remains at rest in the glass\r\ntube while the air is unchanged in weight. Air presses on everything\r\nwithin about forty miles of the world's surface, like a _much_ lighter\r\nocean, at the bottom of which we live--not feeling its weight, because\r\nour bodies are full of air, but feeling its currents, the winds. Towards\r\nany place from which the air has been drawn by suction,[5] air presses\r\nwith a force or weight of nearly fifteen pounds on a square inch of\r\nsurface. Such a pressure holds the limpet to the rock when, by\r\ncontracting itself, the fish has made a place without air[6] under its\r\nshell. Another familiar instance is that of the fly which walks on the\r\nceiling with feet that stick. The barometer tube, emptied of air, and\r\nfilled with pure mercury, is turned down into a cup or cistern\r\ncontaining the same fluid, which, feeling the weight of air, is so\r\npressed by it as to balance a column of about thirty inches (more or\r\nless) in the tube, where no air presses on the top of the column.\r\n\r\nIf a long pipe, closed at one end only, were emptied of air, filled with\r\nwater, the open end kept in water and the pipe held upright, the water\r\nwould rise in it more than thirty feet. In this way water barometers\r\nhave been made. A proof of this effect is shown by any well with a\r\nsucking pump--up which, as is commonly known, the water will rise nearly\r\nthirty feet, by what is called suction, which is, in fact, the pressure\r\nof air towards an empty place.\r\n\r\nThe words on scales of barometers should not be so much regarded for\r\nweather indications, as the rising or falling of the mercury; for, if it\r\nstand at _Changeable_, and then rise towards _Fair_, it presages a\r\nchange of wind or weather, though not so great, as if the mercury had\r\nrisen higher; and, on the contrary, if the mercury stand above _fair_\r\nand then fall, it presages a change, though not to so great a degree as\r\nif it had stood lower: besides which, the direction, and force of wind,\r\nare not in any way noticed. It is not from the point at which the\r\nmercury may stand that we are alone to form a judgment of the state of\r\nthe weather, but from its _rising_ or _falling_; and from the movements\r\nof immediately preceding days as well as hours, keeping in mind effects\r\nof change of _direction_, and dryness, or moisture, as well as\r\nalteration of force or strength of wind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this part of the world, towards the higher latitudes, the quicksilver\r\nranges, or rises and falls, nearly three inches--namely, between about\r\nthirty inches and nine-tenths (30·9), and less than twenty-eight inches\r\n(28·0) on extraordinary occasions; but the usual range is from about\r\nthirty inches and a half (30·5), to about twenty-nine inches. Near the\r\nLine, or in equatorial places, the range is but a few tenths, except in\r\nstorms, when it sometimes falls to twenty-seven inches.\r\n\r\nThe sliding-scale (vernier) divides the tenths into ten parts each, or\r\nhundredths of an inch. The number of divisions on the vernier exceeds\r\nthat in an equal space of the fixed scale by one.[7]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy a thermometer the _weight_ of air is _not_ shown. No air is within\r\nthe tube. None can get in. But the bulb of the tube is full of mercury,\r\nwhich contracts by cold, and swells by heat--according to which effect\r\nthe thread of metal in the small tube is drawn down or pushed up so many\r\ndegrees: and thus shows the temperature.[8]\r\n\r\nIf a thermometer have a piece of linen tied round the bulb, wetted\r\nenough to keep it damp by a thread or wick dipping into a cup of water,\r\nit will show less heat than a dry one, in proportion to the dryness of\r\nthe air, and quickness of drying.[9] In very damp weather, with or\r\n_before_ rain, fog, or dew, two such thermometers will be nearly alike.\r\n\r\nFor ascertaining the dryness or moisture of air, the readiest, and\r\nsurest method is the comparison of two thermometers; one dry, the other\r\n_just_ moistened, and _kept so_. Cooled by evaporation as much as the\r\nstate of the air admits--the moist (or wet) bulb thermometer shows a\r\ntemperature nearly equal to that of the other one, when the atmosphere\r\nis extremely damp, or moist; but lower at other times,--in proportion to\r\nthe dryness of air, and consequent evaporation,--as far as twelve or\r\nfifteen degrees in this climate; twenty or even more elsewhere. From\r\nfour to eight degrees of difference is usual in England; and about seven\r\nis considered healthy for living rooms.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer fixed to a barometer intended to be used only as a\r\nweather-glass shows the temperature of air about it nearly--but does not\r\nshow the temperature of mercury within exactly. It does so however near\r\nenough for ordinary practical purposes--provided that no sun, nor fire,\r\nnor lamp heat is allowed to act on the instrument partially.\r\n\r\nThe mercury in the cistern and tube being affected by cold or heat,\r\nmakes it advisable to consider this when endeavouring to foretell coming\r\nweather by the length of the column.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBriefly, the barometer shows weight or pressure of the air; the\r\nthermometer--heat and cold, or temperature; and the wet thermometer,\r\ncompared with a dry one, the degree of moisture or dampness.[10]\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the state of the air _foretells_, rather\r\nthan shows present weather (an invaluable fact too often overlooked);\r\nthat the longer the time between the signs and the change foretold by\r\nthem, the longer such altered weather will last; and, on the contrary,\r\nthe less the time between a warning and a change, the shorter will be\r\nthe continuance of such foretold weather.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the barometer has been about its ordinary height, say near thirty\r\ninches, at the sea level,[11] and is steady, or rising--while the\r\nthermometer falls, and dampness becomes less--North-westerly, Northerly,\r\nor North-easterly wind--or less wind--may be expected.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary--if a fall takes place, with a rising thermometer and\r\nincreased dampness, wind and rain may be expected from the\r\nSouth-eastward, Southward, or South-westward.\r\n\r\nA fall, with a low thermometer, foretells snow.\r\n\r\nExceptions to these rules occur when a North-easterly wind, with wet\r\n(rain or snow) is impending, before which the barometer often rises (on\r\naccount of the _direction_ of the coming wind alone), and deceives\r\npersons who, from that sign only, expect fair weather.\r\n\r\nWhen the barometer is rather below its ordinary height, say, below\r\ntwenty-nine inches and nine-tenths (at the sea level _only_), a rise\r\nforetells less wind, or a change in its direction towards the\r\nNorthward,--or less wet; but when the mercury[12] has been low, say near\r\n29 inches--the first rising usually precedes, and foretells, strong\r\nwind--(at times heavy squalls)--from the North-westward--Northward--or\r\nNorth-eastward--_after_ which violence a rising glass foretells\r\nimproving weather--if the thermometer falls. But, if the warmth\r\ncontinue, probably the wind will back (shift against the sun's course),\r\nand more Southerly, or South-westerly wind will follow. \"Backing\" is a\r\nbad sign, with any wind.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous shifts of wind, and the heaviest Northerly[13] gales\r\nhappen after the mercury first rises from a very low point.\r\n\r\nIndications of approaching changes of weather, and the direction and\r\nforce of winds are shown less by the height of mercury in the tube, than\r\nby its falling or rising. Nevertheless, a height of about 30 inches (at\r\nthe level of the sea) with a continuance of it, is indicative of fine\r\nweather and moderate winds.\r\n\r\nThe barometer is said to be _falling_ when the mercury in the tube is\r\nsinking, at which time its upper surface is _sometimes_ concave or\r\nhollow. The barometer is _rising_ when the mercurial column is\r\nlengthening; its upper surface being then, as in _general_, convex or\r\nrounded.[14]\r\n\r\nA rapid rise of the barometer indicates unsettled weather. A slow rise,\r\nor steadiness, with dryness, shows fair weather.\r\n\r\nA considerable and rapid fall is a sign of stormy weather and rain.\r\nAlternate rising and sinking show very unsettled weather.\r\n\r\nThe greatest depressions of the barometer are with gales from the S.E.,\r\nSouthward, or S.W.; the greatest elevations, with winds from the N.W.,\r\nNorthward, or N.E., or when calm.\r\n\r\nAlthough the barometer generally falls with a Southerly, and rises with\r\na Northerly wind, the contrary _sometimes_ occurs; in which cases the\r\nSoutherly wind is dry and the weather fine; or the Northerly wind is wet\r\nand violent.[15]\r\n\r\nWhen the barometer sinks considerably, high wind, rain, or snow will\r\nfollow: the wind will be from the Northward if the thermometer is low\r\n(for the season)--from the Southward if the thermometer is high.\r\n\r\nSudden falls of the barometer, with a Westerly wind, are sometimes\r\nfollowed by violent storms from N.W. or North.\r\n\r\nIf a gale sets in from the Eastward or S.E., and the wind veers by the\r\nSouth, the barometer will continue falling until the wind becomes S.W.,\r\nwhen a comparative lull may occur; after which the gale will be renewed;\r\nand the shifting of the wind towards the N.W. will be indicated by a\r\nfall of the thermometer as well as a rise of the barometer.\r\n\r\nThree things appear to affect the mercury in a barometer:--\r\n\r\n1. The direction of the wind--the North-east wind tending to raise it\r\nmost--the South-west to lower it the most, and wind from points of the\r\ncompass between them proportionally as they are nearer one or the other\r\nextreme point.\r\n\r\nN.E. and S.W. may therefore be called the wind's extreme bearings\r\n(rather than _poles_?)\r\n\r\nThe range, or difference of height, of the mercury, due to change of\r\ndirection _only_, from one of these bearings to the other (supposing\r\nstrength or force, and moisture, to remain the same) amounts in these\r\nlatitudes to about half an inch (shown by the barometer as read off).\r\n\r\n2. The amount, taken by itself, of vapour, moisture, wet, rain, hail, or\r\nsnow, in the wind or current of air (direction and strength remaining\r\nthe same) seems to cause a change amounting, in an extreme case, to\r\nabout half an inch.\r\n\r\n3. The strength or force alone of wind from any quarter (moisture and\r\ndirection being unchanged) is preceded, or foretold, by a fall or rise,\r\naccording as the strength will be greater or less, ranging, in an\r\nextreme case, to more than two inches.\r\n\r\nHence, supposing the three causes to act together--in extreme cases--the\r\nmercury might range from about 31 (30·9) inches to near 27 inches, which\r\nhas happened _occasionally_.\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, as the three act much less strongly, and are less in\r\naccord--ordinary varieties of weather (the wind varying as usual--with\r\nmore or less cloudiness, or rain) occur much more frequently than\r\nextreme changes.\r\n\r\nAnother general rule requires attention; which is, that the wind usually\r\nveers, shifts, or goes round, _with the sun_, (right-handed in northern\r\nplaces, left-handed in the southern parts of the world,) and that, when\r\nit does not do so, or backs, more wind or bad weather may be expected\r\ninstead of improvement.\r\n\r\nIn a barometer the mercury begins to rise occasionally before the\r\nconclusion of gale, sometimes even at its commencement, as the\r\nequilibrium of the atmosphere begins to be restored. Although the\r\nmercury falls lowest before high winds, it frequently sinks considerably\r\nbefore heavy rain only. The barometer falls, but _not always_, on the\r\napproach of thunder and lightning, or when the atmosphere is highly\r\ncharged with electricity.[16] Before and during the earlier part of\r\nserene and settled weather, the mercury commonly stands high, and is\r\nstationary.[17]\r\n\r\nInstances of fine weather, with a low glass, occur exceptionally, but\r\nthey are always preludes to a duration of wind or rain, _if not both_.\r\n\r\nAfter very warm and calm weather, rain or a storm is likely to occur;\r\nor at any time when the atmosphere has been _heated_ much above the\r\nusual temperature of the season.\r\n\r\nAllowance should invariably be made for the previous state of the\r\ninstrument during some days as well as hours, because its indications\r\nmay be affected by remote causes, or by changes close at hand. Some of\r\nthese changes may occur at a greater or less distance, influencing\r\nneighbouring regions, but not visible to each observer whose barometer,\r\nnevertheless, feels their effect.\r\n\r\nThere may be heavy rains or violent winds beyond the horizon, out of\r\nview of an observer, by which his instruments may be affected\r\nconsiderably, though no particular change of weather occurs in his\r\nimmediate locality.\r\n\r\nIt may be repeated, that the longer a change of wind or weather is\r\nforetold by the barometer before it takes place, the longer the presaged\r\nweather will last; and, conversely, the shorter the warning, the less\r\ntime whatever causes the warning; whether wind or a fall of rain, hail,\r\nor snow, will continue.\r\n\r\nSometimes severe weather from an equatorial[18] direction, not lasting\r\nlong, may cause no great fall of the barometer, because followed by a\r\n_duration_ of wind from polar regions:--and at times it may fall\r\nconsiderably with polar winds and fine weather, apparently against these\r\nrules, because a _continuance_ of equatorial wind is about to follow. By\r\nsuch changes as these one may be misled, and calamity may be the\r\nconsequence if not thus forewarned.\r\n\r\nThe veering of the winds is a direct consequence of the earth's\r\nrotation, while currents of air from the polar regions are alternating\r\nor contending with others from the equator.\r\n\r\nThe polar currents are cold, dry, and heavy. Those from the equatorial\r\nparts of the world are warm, moist, and comparatively light. Their\r\nalternate or combined action, with the agencies of solar heat and\r\nelectricity, cause the varieties of weather that we experience.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended to discourage attention to what is usually called\r\n\"weather wisdom.\" On the contrary, every prudent person will combine\r\nobservation of the elements with such indications as he may obtain from\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThe more carefully and accurately these two sources of foreknowledge are\r\ncompared and combined, the more satisfactory will the results prove.\r\n\r\nA few of the more marked signs of weather--useful alike to seaman,\r\nfarmer, and gardener, are the following:\r\n\r\nWhether clear or cloudy, a rosy sky at sunset presages fine weather; a\r\nred sky in the morning, bad weather, or much wind (if not rain):--a grey\r\nsky in the morning fine weather; a high dawn, wind; a low dawn; fair\r\nweather.[19]\r\n\r\nSoft-looking or delicate clouds foretell fine weather, with moderate or\r\nlight breezes;--hard edged oily-looking clouds, wind. A dark, gloomy,\r\nblue sky is windy;--but a light, bright blue sky indicates fine weather.\r\nGenerally, the _softer_ clouds look, the less wind (but perhaps more\r\nrain) may be expected;--and the harder, more \"greasy,\" rolled, tufted,\r\nor ragged, the stronger the coming wind will prove. Also, a bright\r\nyellow sky at sunset presages wind; a pale yellow, wet:--and thus by the\r\nprevalence of red, yellow, or grey tints, the coming weather may be\r\nforetold very nearly: indeed, if aided by instruments, almost\r\nexactly.[20]\r\n\r\nSmall inky-looking clouds foretell rain; a light scud, driving across\r\nheavy clouds, wind and rain; but if alone, wind only.\r\n\r\nHigh upper clouds crossing the sun, moon, or stars, in a direction\r\ndifferent from that of the lower clouds, or wind then blowing, foretell\r\na change of wind (beyond tropical latitudes).[21]\r\n\r\nAfter fine clear weather the first signs (in the sky) of change are\r\nusually small, curled, streaked, or spotty clouds, followed by an\r\novercasting of vapour, that grows into cloudiness. This murky\r\nappearance, more or less oily or watery, as wind or rain will prevail,\r\nis a sure sign. The higher and more distant the clouds seem to be, the\r\nmore gradual, but extensive, the coming change of weather will prove.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, natural, quiet, delicate tints or colours, with soft\r\nundefined forms of clouds, foretell fine weather: but gaudy or unusual\r\nhues, with hard, definite outlines, presage rain and wind.\r\n\r\nMisty clouds forming, or hanging on heights, show wind and rain\r\ncoming--if they remain, or descend. If they rise, or disperse, the\r\nweather will improve, or become fine.\r\n\r\nWhen sea birds fly out early, and far to seaward, moderate wind and fair\r\nweather may be expected. When they hang about the land, or over it,\r\nsometimes flying inland, expect a strong wind, with stormy weather. As\r\nmany creatures, besides birds, are affected by the approach of rain or\r\nwind, such indications should not be slighted by the observer of\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThere are other signs of a coming change in the weather known less\r\ngenerally than may be desirable; and, therefore worth notice here.\r\n\r\nWhen birds of long flight, such as swallows and others, hang about home\r\nand fly low--rain or wind may be expected. Also when animals seek\r\nsheltered places, instead of spreading over their usual range: when pigs\r\ncarry straw to their sties; and when smoke from chimneys does not ascend\r\nreadily, (straight upwards during a calm,) an unfavourable change may be\r\nlooked for.\r\n\r\nDew is an indication of fine weather. So is fog. Neither of these two\r\nformations occurs under an overcast sky, or when there is much wind. One\r\nsees the fog occasionally rolled away, as it were, by wind--but not\r\nformed while it is blowing.\r\n\r\nRemarkable clearness of atmosphere, near the horizon; distant objects,\r\nsuch as hills, unusually visible; or raised (by refraction); and what is\r\ncalled \"a good _hearing_ day\" may be mentioned among signs of wet, if\r\nnot wind, to be expected.[22]\r\n\r\nMore than usual twinkling of the stars; indistinctness or apparent\r\nmultiplication of the moon's horns; haloes; \"wind-dogs;\" and the\r\nrainbow; are more or less significant of increasing wind, if not\r\napproaching rain.[23]\r\n\r\nNear land, in sheltered harbours, in valleys, or over low ground, there\r\nis usually a marked diminution of wind during part of the night--and a\r\ndispersion of clouds. At such times an eye on an overlooking height may\r\nsee an extended body of vapour below; which the cooling of night has\r\nrendered visible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the preceding remarks are probably sufficient for their\r\nprincipal purpose--these pages may fall into the hands of persons\r\nfamiliar with the subject, to whom the following observations may be\r\naddressed, as some of the _reasons_ for what has been so briefly, if not\r\ntoo positively outlined.\r\n\r\nAs the mercurial column rises with increase of pressure by the\r\natmosphere, and descends when the pressure diminishes, it indicates a\r\ngreater or less accumulation of air, which, like other fluid, such as\r\nwater (when heaped above its average level or reduced below it, from\r\nwhatever cause),--will have a tendency to fall or rise till the general\r\nequilibrium is restored. An observer may be under the centre of such\r\naccumulation or depression, he may be more or less distant from it,\r\nthough within the influence of whatever horizontal movement of air may\r\nbe caused by such temporary increase or diminution of pressure. Hence\r\nthe barometer shows, and generally foretells, changes of wind; but as\r\ncomplications always occur, and as changes are of greater or less\r\nextent, affecting or extending through a wider or more limited area,\r\naccompanied by hygrometric and electrical alterations, it is extremely\r\ndifficult at times to say beforehand what particular change of weather\r\nis to be expected, and at what interval of time; although after the\r\nevent the correspondence of barometric changes with those of the weather\r\ncan be readily traced. However, notwithstanding occasional perplexity,\r\nthe general character of weather during the next few days may be\r\npredicted by an observer who understands the nature and use of this\r\ninstrument and the thermometer, and has watched them in the few\r\nimmediately preceding days.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to foretell weather, the general peculiarity should\r\nalways be remembered, that the barometric column usually stands higher\r\nwith easterly than it does with westerly winds; and with winds from the\r\npolar regions higher than with those from the direction of the equator.\r\nHence the highest columns are observed with north-east winds in northern\r\nlatitudes, and with south-east in the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIn middle latitudes there is an average difference (unreduced or\r\nobserved height as read off) of about half an inch, other things being\r\nsimilar, between the heights of the mercury with North-easterly, and\r\nwith South-westerly winds.\r\n\r\nThe steadier the column, or the more gradually it moves, the more\r\nsettled in character will the weather be, and conversely: because it\r\nshows a quiet settled state of the atmosphere; or, if otherwise, the\r\nreverse. In the tropics, when the barometric column moves contrary to\r\nits usual daily motion, inferior weather may be expected (temporarily),\r\nbecause the usual air currents are disturbed.\r\n\r\nThis regular movement, whether tidal, or otherwise connected with the\r\nsun's influence--sensible in tropical latitudes, but more or less masked\r\nelsewhere--amounts to nearly two-tenths of an inch near the equator, the\r\nhighest being at about nine, and the lowest near three o'clock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome movements of the atmosphere may be illustrated by reference to the\r\nmotion of water drawn off from a reservoir by a small opening below; or\r\nby similar _upward_ draught through a syphon; or by a gradual pouring in\r\nat the upper surface.\r\n\r\nFrom a slight motion at the commencement, affecting only that portion of\r\nthe fluid adjoining either of those places of diminution or repletion,\r\ngradually all the water becomes influenced and acquires more or less\r\nrapid movement. But suppose a long reservoir or canal of fluid which has\r\ntwo such points of exhaustion or two of such repletion (as imagined\r\nabove), and that one of either is near each end of the vessel. If each\r\naperture be opened at the same moment, equal effects will be caused in\r\neach half of the fluid towards either end of the vessel, but in the\r\nmiddle there must be a neutral point at which the water falls, yet has\r\nno horizontal motion. The converse takes place in raising the level. And\r\nin the case of fluid drawn off or diminished in weight at one end while\r\nincreased by repletion at the other, the _whole_ body of water will move\r\nsimilarly to that in the former vessel, but unequally. Hence it is\r\nevident, that before horizontal motion occurs, an augmentation or a\r\ndiminution of pressure must take place somewhere more or less remote;\r\nand so it is with the lighter fluid atmosphere,--which has centres,\r\nlines, or areas of depression towards which currents flow.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations show in some degree why the barometric changes\r\nusually precede, but sometimes only accompany, changes of weather: and,\r\nthough very rarely, occur without any sensible alteration in the wind\r\ncurrent of the atmosphere. An observer may be near a central point\r\ntowards which the surrounding fluid tends,--or from which it diverges.\r\nHe may be at the very farthest limit of the portion of fluid that is so\r\ninfluenced. He may be at an intermediate point--or he may be between\r\nbodies of atmosphere tending towards opposite directions.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, that \"a whirlwind which sets an extended portion of\r\nthe atmosphere into a state of rapid revolution diminishes the pressure\r\nof the atmosphere over that portion of the earth's surface, and most of\r\nall at the centre of the whirl. The depth of the compressing column of\r\nair will, at the centre, be least, and its weight will be diminished in\r\nproportion to the violence of the wind.\" Yet this has been controverted\r\nwith respect to the _general_ effect of air in horizontal motion, and\r\nthe depth of the column in question.\r\n\r\nCertainly there are two kinds of whirlwinds--one caused by rarefaction,\r\ntending to lighten vertical pressure under the vortex, though not,\r\nperhaps, under all the current drawn towards it; and the other, a\r\nconsequence of opposing winds, which occasion huge eddies or whirlwinds\r\nof compression.\r\n\r\nSome whirlwinds are accompanied by rushes from the upper atmosphere,\r\nfrom the colder regions, which, mingling with warmer and moister air\r\nnear the sea, cause dense clouds. About their centre it sometimes\r\nhappens that the barometer falls as much as two or three inches, showing\r\na diminution of atmospheric pressure by nearly a tenth part; when it\r\nshould be expected, from physical considerations alone, that very dense\r\nclouds would be formed.[24]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe column of mercury falls about one tenth of an inch for each of the\r\nfirst few hundred feet above the sea level, but varying when it becomes\r\nmuch more elevated.[25] Due allowance, therefore, should be made in\r\nobserving, when on high land.\r\n\r\nThe tides are affected by atmospheric pressure, so much that a rise of\r\none inch in the barometer will have a corresponding fall in the tides of\r\nnine to sixteen inches, or about one foot for each inch.[26]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVessels sometimes enter docks, or even harbours, where they have\r\nscarcely a foot of water more than their draught; and as docking, as\r\nwell as launching large ships, requires a close calculation of height of\r\nwater, the state of the barometer becomes of additional importance on\r\nsuch occasions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo render these pages rather more useful at sea, in _any_ part of the\r\nworld, a few words about squalls and hurricanes are here offered to the\r\nyoung seaman.\r\n\r\nGenerally, squalls are preceded, or accompanied, or followed by clouds;\r\nbut the very dangerous \"white squall\" (of the West Indies and other\r\nregions), is indicated only by a rushing sound, and by white wave\r\ncrests.\r\n\r\n\"Descending squalls\" come slanting downwards, off high land,[27] or from\r\nupper regions of atmosphere. They are dangerous, being sometimes\r\nviolently strong.\r\n\r\nA squall cloud that can be seen through or under is not likely to bring,\r\nor be accompanied by, so much wind as a dark continued cloud extending\r\nbeyond the horizon. How the comparative hardness or softness of clouds\r\nforetells more or less wind or rain, was stated in pages 13 and 14.\r\n\r\nThe expressions \"hardening up,\" \"softening,\" or looking \"greasy,\" are\r\nfamiliar to seamen: and such very sure indications are the appearances\r\nso designated, that they can hardly be mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe rapid or slow rise of a squall cloud--its more or less disturbed\r\nlook--that is, whether its body is much agitated, and changing form\r\ncontinually, with broken clouds, or scud, flying about--or whether the\r\nmass of cloud is shapeless and nearly quiet, though floating onwards\r\nacross the sky--foretells more or less wind accordingly.\r\n\r\nAn officer of a watch, with a good eye for clouds and signs of changing\r\nweather, may save his men a great deal of unnecessary exposure, as well\r\nas work, besides economising sails, spars, and rigging.\r\n\r\nIn some of the \"saws\" about wind and weather, there is so much truth\r\nthat, though trite and simple, their insertion here can do no harm.\r\n\r\n    Adverting to the barometer:--\r\n          When rise begins, after low,\r\n          Squalls expect and clear blow.\r\n    Or:--_First_ rise, after very low,\r\n          Indicates a stronger blow.\r\n    Also:--Long foretold, long last:\r\n           Short notice, soon past.\r\n    To which may be added:--In squalls--\r\n          When rain comes before wind,\r\n          Halyards, sheets, and braces mind.\r\n    And:--When wind comes before rain,\r\n          Soon you may make sail again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Also, generally speaking:--\r\n            When the glass falls low,\r\n            Prepare for a blow;\r\n            When it rises high,\r\n            Let all your kites fly.[28]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo these short expressions--well known, in practice, to the experienced;\r\na very concise but sure rule may be added, for avoiding the central or\r\nstrongest part of a hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, tornado, or circling\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nWith your face towards the wind, in North latitude, the centre of the\r\ncircling, or rotatory storm, will be square to your right. In South\r\nlatitude, square to your left.\r\n\r\nThe apparent veering of the wind, and the approach or retreat of the\r\ndangerous central circle, depend on your position in the curvilinear\r\nwhirl or sweep.\r\n\r\nDraw a circle;--mark the direction of the rotation or circulation, by an\r\narrow with the head towards the left hand (against the movement of a\r\nwatch's hands) in North latitude; but towards the right (or with the\r\nhands of a watch) if in South latitude. The direction of the wind, and\r\nthe bearing of the centre, show your position in the meteor, for such it\r\nis, though perhaps hundreds of miles in diameter; and the veering of the\r\nwind, or the contrary, and its change in strength, will show how the\r\nmeteor is moving bodily--over an extensive region, revolving\r\nhorizontally--or inclined at a certain angle to the horizontal plane.\r\n\r\nIf the observer be stationary, in North latitude, and the centre pass on\r\nhis polar side, he will experience a change of wind from Southward by\r\nthe West towards North; but if it pass between him and the Equator, the\r\nchange will be from Southward by the East towards North; but otherwise\r\nin South latitude, as his place in circles sketched will show more\r\nclearly than words. The roughest sketch or diagram, indicating the\r\nvarious directions of wind, and the course of the meteor's centre, will\r\nshow more plainly than descriptions--which must necessarily vary with\r\neach case, and are tedious.\r\n\r\nCyclonology, or really meteorology, is simple enough in these great\r\ncharacteristic effects; but their causes must be the philosopher's\r\nstudy, rather than that of the young practical seaman.\r\n\r\nWere it not for this reflection, one might endeavour to show how all the\r\ngreat Easterly trade winds--the no less important anti-trades,[29] or\r\nnearly constant Westerly winds,--and their complicated eddying offsets,\r\nare all (on greater or smaller scales) breadths, or zones of atmosphere,\r\nalternating, or circulating, or crossing (superposed or\r\nlaterally)--between which, at distant intervals, occur those strong\r\neddies, or storms, called hurricanes--typhoons--tornadoes--or cyclones.\r\n\r\nThe great easterly and westerly movements--so clearly shown by\r\nphilosophers to be the consequences of cold polar currents of air--warm\r\nequatorial currents--and diurnal rotation of the earth;[30] are grand\r\nruling phenomena of meteorology--to which storms, and all local changes,\r\noccurring but occasionally, are subordinate and exceptional. Further\r\ninvestigations into electrical and chemical peculiarities will probably\r\nthrow additional light, perhaps the strongest, on meteorological\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the previous observations, general reference has been made to\r\nmercurial barometers of the ordinary kind; but, excepting the\r\nconstruction of the instruments themselves, those observations apply to\r\nall barometers, wheel--aneroid--or metallic--and likewise, of course, to\r\nthe sympiesometer, which is a modified barometer. But as these four\r\nlast-mentioned instruments are scarcely so familiar as the simplest form\r\nof barometer, it may be useful to add a few words about each of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe WHEEL barometer has a syphon tube, partly filled with mercury, on\r\nwhich, at the short or open end of the tube, a float moves, to which a\r\nline is attached that moves a wheel, carrying an index.[31]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANEROID barometers, if often compared with good mercurial columns, are\r\nsimilar in their indications, and valuable; but it must be remembered\r\nthat they are not independent instruments; that they are set originally\r\nby a barometer,[32] require adjustment occasionally, and may deteriorate\r\nin time, though slowly.\r\n\r\nThe aneroid is quick in showing the variation of atmospheric pressure,\r\nand to the navigator who knows the difficulty, at times, of using\r\nbarometers, this instrument is a great boon, for it can be placed\r\nanywhere, quite out of harm's way, and is not affected by the ship's\r\nmotion, although faithfully giving indication of increased or diminished\r\npressure of air.[33] In ascending or descending elevations, the hand of\r\nthe aneroid may be seen to move (like the hand of a watch), showing the\r\nheight above the level of the sea, or the difference of level between\r\nplaces of comparison.[34]\r\n\r\nThe principle on which it is constructed may be explained in a few\r\nwords, without going into a scientific or too minute detail of its\r\nvarious parts. The weight of a column of air, which in a common\r\nbarometer acts on the mercury, in the aneroid presses on a small\r\ncircular metal box, from which nearly all air is extracted; and to this\r\nbox is connected, by nice mechanical arrangement, the hand visible over\r\nthe face of the instrument. When the atmospheric pressure is lessened on\r\nthe vacuum box, a spring acting on levers, turns the hand to the left,\r\nand when the pressure increases, the spring is affected differently, the\r\nhand being turned to the right. It acts in any position, but as it\r\n_often varies several hundredths with such a change_, it should be held\r\nuniformly, while read off.\r\n\r\nThe known expansion and contraction of metals under varying\r\ntemperatures, caused doubts as to the accuracy of the aneroid under such\r\nchanges; but they were partly removed by introducing into the vacuum box\r\na small portion of gas, as a compensation for the effects of heat or\r\ncold. The gas in the box, changing it bulk on a change of temperature,\r\nwas intended to compensate for the effect on the metals of which the\r\naneroid is made. Besides which, a further and more, reliable\r\ncompensation has lately been effected by a combination of brass and\r\nsteel bars.[35]\r\n\r\nMETALLIC barometers (in _outer_ shape and size like aneroids) have not\r\nyet been tested adequately in very moist, hot, or cold air for a\r\nsufficient time. They, as well as sympiesometers, are likewise dependent\r\nor secondary instruments, and liable to deterioration. For limited\r\nemployment, when sufficiently compared, they may be very useful,\r\nespecially in a few cases of electrical changes not foretold or shown by\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\nThe SYMPIESOMETER is considered to be more sensitive than the marine\r\nbarometer, falling sooner, and rising earlier: but this is partly in\r\nconsequence of the marine barometer tube being contracted, to prevent\r\noscillation or \"pumping.\" In the sympiesometer a gas is used, which\r\npresses on the confined surface of the liquid with an uniform pressure\r\nat an equal state of temperature. The liquid is raised or depressed by\r\nan increase or diminution in the density of the atmosphere, and change\r\nof temperature is allowed for, by the sliding scale of the instrument\r\nbeing always set to agree with the height of the mercury in the attached\r\nthermometer, bringing the _pointer_ on the sliding scale of the\r\nsympiesometer to the same degree on the inverted scale (over which it\r\nslides) as is indicated by the thermometer. The height of the fluid, as\r\nthen shown by the sliding scale, indicates the pressure of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs the instrument is delicate, great care should be taken, in carrying\r\nor handling, to keep the top always upwards, and to exclude casual rays\r\nof the sun, or a fire, or lamp.\r\n\r\nOil sympiesometers seem to be affected more than mercurial, or others,\r\nand much more than the barometer, by lightning or electricity. That\r\nthey, and the hermetically sealed \"STORM GLASSES,\" are influenced by\r\ncauses besides pressure and temperature, appears now to be certain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe daily movement of the barometer may be noted (in a form or table of\r\ndouble entry) at the time of each observation, by a dot at the place\r\ncorresponding to its altitude, and the time of observing; which dot\r\nshould be connected with the previous one by a line. The resulting free\r\ncurve (or zig-zag) will show at a glance what have been the movements\r\nduring the days immediately previous, by which, and not merely by the\r\nlast observation, a judgment may be formed of the weather to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nSuch a diagram may be filled up by _uncorrected_ observations, its\r\nobject being to serve as a weather guide for immediate use, rather than\r\nfor future investigation. If closely kept up, it will prove to be of\r\nutility, and will in some degree reward the trouble of keeping a regular\r\nrecord. For purely scientific objects much more nicety and detail are\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHESITATION is sometimes felt by young seamen, at first using the vernier\r\nof a barometer, for want of some such familiar explanation as the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nThe general principle of this moveable dividing scale is, that the total\r\nnumber of the smallest spaces or subdivisions of the vernier are made\r\nequal, taken altogether, to one less than that number of the smallest\r\nspaces in an equal length of the fixed scale.\r\n\r\nFor example: ten spaces on the vernier being made equal to nine on the\r\nscale, each vernier space is one tenth less than a scale space; and if\r\nthe first line or division of the vernier agree exactly with any line of\r\nthe scale, the next line of the vernier must be one tenth of a tenth (or\r\none hundredth) of an inch from agreement with the next _scale_ division;\r\nthe following vernier line must be two hundredths out, and so on:\r\ntherefore, the number of such differences (from the next tenth on the\r\nscale) at which a vernier line agrees with a scale line, when set, is\r\nthe number of hundredths to be added to the said tenth; (in a common\r\nbarometer, reading only to hundredths of an inch).\r\n\r\nThe vernier of a barometer reading to thousandths of an inch, is on a\r\nsimilar principle, though differently divided. In this application of\r\nit, generally, twenty-five vernier spaces equal twenty-four of the scale\r\nspaces, which are each half a tenth, or five hundredths of an inch;\r\ntherefore, the difference between one of the vernier and one of the\r\nscale is two-tenths of a hundredth, or two thousandths of an inch\r\n[25)·050(·002].\r\n\r\nThis is the usual graduation of scientific barometers; but for ordinary\r\npurposes, as weather-glasses, a division, or reading, to the hundredth\r\nof an inch is sufficient.\r\n\r\nWhen set properly, the vernier straight edge, the top of the mercury,\r\nand the observer's eye, should be on the same level; the edge (or\r\npointer) just _touching_[36] the middle and uppermost point of the\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be taken to look thus square, or at

required, it may be _re-set_ thus--When at the upper station\r\n(_within its range_), and having noted the reading carefully, touch the\r\nscrew behind so as to bring back the hand a few inches (if the\r\ninstrument will admit), then read off and start again. _Reverse the\r\noperation when descending._ This may add some inches of measure\r\n_approximately_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *

BAROMETER,\r\n\r\nADOPTED BY\r\n\r\nHER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT,\r\n\r\n_On the recommendation of the Kew Observatory Committee of the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis instrument should be suspended in a good light for reading, but out\r\nof the reach of sunshine or the heat of a fire or lamp. It should be as\r\nnearly amidships, and exposed as little to sudden changes of\r\ntemperature, gusts of wind, or injuries, as possible. In a ship of war\r\nit should be below the lowest battery or gun-deck. Light should have\r\naccess to the back of the tube, to admit of setting the index so as to\r\nhave its lower edge a tangent to the surface of the mercury--the eye\r\nbeing on the same level, which is known by the back and front edges of\r\nthe index being in one line with the mercury surface. White paper or\r\ncard will reflect light for setting the vernier correctly. The height of\r\nthe cistern above or below the ship's water-line should be ascertained,\r\nand entered on the register.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to place the barometer in such a position as not to be\r\nin danger of a side blow, and also sufficiently far from the deck above\r\nto allow for the spring of the metal arm in cases of sudden movements of\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nIf there is risk of the instrument striking anywhere when the vessel is\r\nmuch inclined, it will be desirable either to put some soft padding on\r\nthat place, or to check movement in that direction by a light elastic\r\ncord; in fixing which, attention must be paid to have it acting only\r\nwhere risk of a blow begins, not interfering otherwise with the free\r\nswing of the instrument: a very light cord attached above, when\r\npossible, will be least likely to interfere injuriously.\r\n\r\nThe vernier, as usual in standard barometers, reads to the two\r\nthousandth (·002) part of an inch. Every long line cut on the vernier\r\ncorresponds to ·01 part; each small division on the scale is ·05; the\r\nhundredth parts on the vernier being added to the five when its lower\r\nedge is next above one of the short lines; or written down as shown by\r\nthe figures on the vernier only, when next above one of the divisions\r\nmarking tenths.\r\n\r\nIn placing this barometer, it is only necessary to fix the instrument\r\ncarefully, as indicated in the above directions, and give a few gentle\r\ntaps with the fingers on the bottom, to move the mercury. Without\r\nfurther operation it will usually be ready for observation in less than\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nWhen moving the barometer, or replacing it in its case, the mercury\r\nshould be allowed to run gently up to the top of the tube, by holding\r\nthe instrument for a few minutes inclined at an angle. The vernier\r\nshould be brought down to the bottom of the scale. No other adjustment\r\nfor portability is required. During carriage, it ought to be kept with\r\nthe cistern end uppermost, or lying flat, the former position being\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\nIf the mercury should not descend at first by a few gentle taps, use\r\nsharper (but of course without violence), by which, and two or three\r\ntaps, with the finger ends, on the tube--between the scale and the\r\ntangent screw--the mercury will be made to begin to descend.\r\n\r\nIn reading off from a barometer, it should hang freely, not inclined by\r\nholding, or even by touch.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though rarely, at sea the mercury seems _stopped_. If so,\r\ntake down the instrument (after _sloping_), reverse it, tap the tube\r\ngently while the cistern end is upwards, and then replace as before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTESTING BAROMETERS, HYDROMETERS, AND THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1853 a conference of maritime nations was held at Brussels,\r\non the subject of meteorology at sea. The report of this conference was\r\nlaid before Parliament, and the result was a vote of money for the\r\npurchase of instruments and the discussion of observations, under the\r\nsuperintendence of the Board of Trade. Arrangements were then made, in\r\naccordance with the views of the Royal Society and the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, for the supply of\r\ninstruments properly tested.\r\n\r\nIn the barometers now in general use by meteorologists on land, the\r\ndiameters of the tubes are nearly equal throughout their whole length,\r\nand a provision is made for adjusting the mercury in the cistern to the\r\nzero point, previous to reading the height of the top of the column. The\r\nobject of the latter arrangement, it is well known, is to avoid the\r\nnecessity of applying a correction to the readings for the difference of\r\ncapacity between the cistern and the tube. At sea, barometers of this\r\nconstruction cannot be used. Part of the tube of the marine barometer\r\nmust be very much contracted to prevent \"pumping,\" and the motion of the\r\nship would render it impracticable to adjust the mercury in the cistern\r\nto the zero point. In the barometer usually employed on shore, the index\r\nerror is the same throughout the whole range of scale readings, if the\r\ninstrument be properly made; but in nearly all the barometers which have\r\ntill recently been employed at sea, the index correction varies through\r\nthe range of scale readings, in proportion to the difference of capacity\r\nbetween the cistern and the tube. To find the index correction for a\r\nland barometer, comparison with a Standard at any part of the scale at\r\nwhich the mercury may happen to be, is generally considered sufficient.\r\nTo test the marine barometer is a work of much more time, since it is\r\nnecessary to find the correction for scale readings at about each half\r\ninch throughout the range of atmospheric pressure to which it may be\r\nexposed; and it becomes necessary to have recourse to artificial means\r\nof changing the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of the mercury\r\nin the cistern.\r\n\r\nThe barometers intended to be tested are placed, together with a\r\nStandard, in an air-tight chamber, to which an air pump is applied, so\r\nthat, by partially exhausting the air, the Standard can be made to read\r\nmuch lower than the lowest pressure to which marine barometers are\r\nlikely to be exposed; and by compressing the air it can be made to read\r\nhigher than the mercury ever stands at the level of the sea. The tube of\r\nthe Standard is contracted similarly to that of the marine barometer,\r\nbut a provision is made for adjusting the mercury in its cistern to the\r\nzero point. Glass windows are inserted in the upper part of the iron\r\nair-chamber, through which the scales of the barometers may be seen; but\r\nas the verniers cannot be moved in the usual way from outside the\r\nchamber, a provision is made for reading the height of the mercury\r\nindependent of the verniers attached to the scales of the respective\r\nbarometers. At a distance of some five or six feet from the air-tight\r\nchamber a vertical scale is fixed. The divisions on this scale\r\ncorrespond exactly with those on the tube of the Standard barometer. A\r\nvernier and telescope are made to slide on the scale by means of a rack\r\nand pinion. The telescope has two horizontal wires, one fixed, and the\r\nother moveable by a micrometer, screw so that the difference between\r\nthe height of the column of mercury and the nearest division on the\r\nscale of the Standard, and also of all the other barometers placed by\r\nthe side of it for comparison, can be measured either with the vertical\r\nscale and vernier or the micrometer wire. The means are thus possessed\r\nof testing barometers for index error in any part of the scale, through\r\nthe whole range of atmospheric pressure to which they are likely to be\r\nexposed, and the usual practice is to test them at every half inch from\r\n27·5 to 31 inches.\r\n\r\nIn this way barometers of various other descriptions have been tested,\r\nand their errors found to be so large that some barometers read half an\r\ninch and upwards too high, while others read as much too low. In some\r\ncases those which were correct in one part of the scale were found to be\r\nfrom half an inch to an inch wrong in other parts. These barometers were\r\nof the old and ordinary construction. In some the mercury would not\r\ndescend lower than about 29 inches, owing to a fault very common in the\r\nconstruction of the marine barometer till lately in general use, that\r\nthe cistern was not large enough to hold the mercury which descended\r\nfrom the tube in a low atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nThe practice which has long prevailed of mounting the marine barometer\r\nin wood is objectionable. The instrument recently introduced agreeably\r\nto the recommendation of the Kew Committee, is greatly superior to any\r\nother description of marine barometer which has yet been tested, as\r\nregards the accuracy with which it indicates the pressure of the\r\natmosphere. The diameter of the cistern is about an inch and a quarter,\r\nand that of the tube about a quarter of an inch. The scale, instead of\r\nbeing divided into inches in the usual way, is shortened in the\r\nproportion of about 0·04 of an inch for every inch. The object of\r\nshortening the scale is to avoid the necessity of applying a correction\r\nfor difference of capacity between the cistern and the tube. The\r\nperfection with which this is done may be judged of from the fact, that\r\nof the first twelve barometers tested at the Liverpool Observatory with\r\nan apparatus exactly similar to that used at Kew (whence these\r\ninstruments were sent by railway, after being tested and certified), the\r\nindex corrections in the two pressures of 28 and 31 inches in three of\r\nthem were the same; two differed 0·001 of an inch; and for the remainder\r\nthe differences ranged from 0·002 to 0·006 of an inch. The corrections\r\nfor capacity were therefore considered perfect, and, with one\r\nunimportant exception, agreed with those given at Kew.\r\n\r\nIn order to check the pumping of the mercury at sea, the tubes of these\r\nbarometers are so contracted, through a few inches, that, when first\r\nsuspended, the mercury is perhaps twenty minutes in falling from the top\r\nof the tube to its proper level. When used on shore, this contraction of\r\nthe tube causes the marine barometer to be always a little behind an\r\nordinary barometer, the tube of which is not contracted. The amount\r\nvaries according to the rate at which the mercury is rising or falling,\r\nand ranges from 0·00 to 0·02 of an inch. As the motion of the ship at\r\nsea causes the mercury to pass more rapidly through the contracted tube,\r\nthe readings are almost the same there as they would be if the tube were\r\nnot contracted, and in no case do they differ enough to be of importance\r\nin maritime use.\r\n\r\nThe method of testing thermometers is so simple as scarcely to require\r\nexplanation. For the freezing point, the bulbs and a considerable\r\nportion of the tubes of the thermometers, are immersed in pounded ice.\r\nFor the higher temperatures, the thermometers are placed in a\r\ncylindrical glass vessel containing water of the required heat; and the\r\nscales of the thermometers intended to be tested, together with the\r\nStandard with which they are to be compared, are read through the glass.\r\nIn this way the scale readings maybe tested at any required degree of\r\ntemperature, and the usual practice is to test them at every ten degrees\r\nfrom 32° to 92° of Fahrenheit. For this range of 60° the makers who\r\nsupply Government are limited to 0·6 of a degree as a maximum error of\r\nscale reading; but so accurately are these thermometers made, that it\r\nhas not been found necessary to reject more than a very few of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHydrometers are tested by careful immersion in pure distilled water; of\r\nwhich the specific gravity is taken as unity.\r\n\r\nIn water less pure, more salt, dense, and buoyant, the instrument floats\r\nhigher, carrying more of the graduated scale out of the fluid.\r\n\r\nThe zero of the scale should be level with the surface of distilled\r\nwater, and rise above it in proportion as increase of density causes\r\nless displacement.\r\n\r\nThe scale is graduated to thousandths--as far as ·040 only--because the\r\nsea water usually ranges between 1·014 and about 1·036. Only the last\r\ntwo figures need be marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LONDON:\r\n Printed by GEORGE E.

Daussy.\r\n\r\n[27] Williwaw (Whirl-awa?) of the old sealers and whalers.\r\n\r\n[28] Seamen call the light sails, used only in very fine weather,\r\n\"flying kites.\"\r\n\r\n[29] Herschel.\r\n\r\n[30] Dové.\r\n\r\n[31] For a barometer of this kind, Admiral Milne has invented\r\nself-registering mechanism, that answers well.\r\n\r\n[32] A small turnscrew being applied gently to the screw head at the\r\nback. This is often necessary, on receiving or first using an aneroid\r\nthat has long been lying by, or that has been shaken by travelling.\r\n\r\n[33] It is a good weather glass--to be suspended on or near the upper\r\ndeck, for easy reference;--and is unlikely to be injured by mere\r\nconcussion of air, or vibration of wood, when guns are fired.\r\n\r\n[34] Allowing 0,0011 of an inch for each foot.\r\n\r\n[35] The manufacture of these useful auxiliary instruments (all French\r\noriginally) has increased much latterly: and now the patent has expired.\r\nThey might be so improved so to be worth more than double their present\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n[36] Like the sun's edge or limb, touching the sea horizon, as seen\r\ninverted when using a sextant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Barometer and Weather Guide, by Robert Fitzroy",
