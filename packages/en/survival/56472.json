The frequent failure of red clover in normal seasons,\r\n  especially on normal soils occupying the highest land, is\r\n  undoubtedly due in part at least to the absence of the proper\r\n  bacteria (sometimes the soil lacks lime or phosphorus).

(Sweet clover is a tall, rank-growing, sweet-scented\r\n  leguminous plant widely distributed over Illinois, especially\r\n  along the roadsides in the northern and central parts of\r\n  the state, and in many places in bottom lands in southern\r\n  Illinois.)

HOPKINS, CHIEF IN AGRONOMY AND CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the several different classes or groups of bacteria there are two\r\nwhich are of special importance to agriculture because of their relation\r\nto the element nitrogen, this being commonly considered the most valuable\r\nelement of plant food.[1] These two classes of bacteria are, first, the\r\nnitrifying bacteria, and, second, the nitrogen-gathering bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NITRIFYING BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nitrifying bacteria are those which have the power to form nitrates.\r\nIn the following brief discussion of this subject we include at least\r\nthree species of bacteria which by their combined or successive action\r\nhave the power to transform organic nitrogen into nitrate nitrogen, which\r\nis a suitable form of nitrogen for plant food. For the exact information\r\nwhich we now have regarding the nitrifying bacteria we are indebted to\r\nthe researches of Pasteur and Schlösing and Müntz of France, Winogradsky\r\nof Russia, Warington of England, and others.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen in the soil is almost entirely in organic compounds; that\r\nis, the nitrogen (which is a gas in the free, or uncombined, state) is\r\nunited or combined with other elements, notably with carbon, hydrogen,\r\nand oxygen, in the form of partially decayed vegetable or organic matter.\r\n(By organic matter we mean matter which has been formed by the growth\r\nof some organism, either plant or animal, as grass or flesh.) Plants\r\ncannot use the free nitrogen of the air as plant food, neither can they\r\nuse the organic compounds of nitrogen which occur in the soil. There\r\nare at least three different kinds of bacteria, and also three different\r\nsteps or stages involved in the process of nitrification, the nitrogen\r\nbeing changed from the organic compounds first into the ammonia[2] form,\r\nsecond, into the nitrite form, and third into the nitrate form. During\r\nthe process the nitrogen is separated from the carbon and other elements\r\ncomposing the insoluble organic matter, and is united or combined with\r\noxygen and some alkaline element (as calcium) to form the soluble\r\nnitrate, such as calcium nitrate, which is one of the most suitable\r\ncompounds of nitrogen for plant food. Calcium is the alkaline element\r\ncontained in lime or limestone. The name _calcium nitrate_ indicates just\r\nwhat elements this compound contains; namely, calcium, nitrogen, and\r\noxygen. (In the names of compounds the ending _-ate_ always means oxygen.)\r\n\r\nThis is the general process of nitrification in which the nitrifying\r\nbacteria transform or transfer the nitrogen from insoluble organic\r\ncompounds into soluble compounds in which it may serve as available\r\nplant food. The nitrate which is thus formed may be calcium nitrate or\r\nmagnesium nitrate or potassium nitrate or even sodium nitrate, depending\r\nupon which of these alkaline elements is present in the must suitable\r\nform. If no alkaline element is present in available form then no\r\nnitrates can be made in the soil. One of the reasons for applying ground\r\nlimestone to soils which are deficient in lime is to furnish the element\r\ncalcium in suitable form for the formation of nitrates in the process of\r\nnitrification. Ground limestone is calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), a compound\r\ncontaining one atom of calcium (Ca), one atom of carbon (C) and three\r\natoms of oxygen (O₃). This is the same form of lime which is contained\r\nnaturally in limestone soils—soils which are noted for their great\r\nproductiveness—and it is generally the most economical form of lime to\r\nuse for correcting soil acidity and promoting nitrification.\r\n\r\nIn the process of nitrification, that is in the formation of nitrates,\r\nthere is required, not only the presence of calcium, or some other\r\nalkaline element, in suitable form, but also a good supply of the element\r\noxygen; for calcium nitrate, Ca(NO₃)₂, contains one atom of calcium\r\n(Ca), two atoms of nitrogen (N)₂, and six atoms of oxygen (O₃)₂, in\r\neach molecule as indicated in the formula, Ca(NO₃)₂. Magnesium nitrate,\r\nMg(NO₃)₂, potassium nitrate, KNO₃ (K is from the Latin word _Kalium_,\r\nwhich means potassium), and all other nitrates, also, contain oxygen. The\r\nsupply of oxygen for the formation of nitrates in the soil comes from the\r\nair, which consists of about twenty percent oxygen, seventy-eight percent\r\nnitrogen, and two percent of other elements and compounds, as argon,\r\ncarbon dioxid, CO₂, water vapor, H₂O, etc. One of the important effects\r\nof cultivation, or tillage, is that it permits the air more freely to\r\nenter the soil, and thus promotes nitrification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NITROGEN-GATHERING BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the nitrogen naturally in the soil is contained almost\r\nentirely in the organic matter. Any process which tends to decompose\r\nor destroy this organic matter, such as nitrification or other forms\r\nof oxidation, will also tend to reduce the total stock of nitrogen in\r\nthe soil. Because of this fact the matter of restoring nitrogen to the\r\nsoil becomes of very great importance. Of course a part of the nitrogen\r\nremoved in crops may be returned in the manure produced on the farm;\r\nand nitrogen may also be bought in the markets in such forms as sodium\r\nnitrate (containing 15 to 16 percent of nitrogen), ammonium sulfate\r\n(containing 20 to 21 percent of nitrogen), and dried blood (containing 12\r\nto 15 percent nitrogen); but, when we bear in mind that such commercial\r\nnitrogen costs about 15 cents a pound, and that one bushel of corn\r\ncontains about one pound of nitrogen, it will be seen at once that the\r\npurchase of nitrogen cannot be considered practicable in general farming,\r\nalthough in market gardening, and in some other kinds of intensive\r\nagriculture, commercial nitrogen can often he used with very marked\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nNitrogen is removed from the soil not only in the crops grown, but also,\r\nand frequently in larger amounts per annum, in the drainage waters, and\r\nin some other ways, as by denitrification and by the blowing and washing\r\nof the surface soil. Professor Snyder, of the Minnesota Experiment\r\nStation, has shown that during a series of years the total loss of\r\nnitrogen from some Minnesota soils in some cases amounts to several times\r\nthe amount actually used in the crops produced.\r\n\r\nConsidering all of these facts, and the additional facts that there\r\nare about seventy-five million pounds of atmospheric nitrogen resting\r\nupon every acre of land, and that it is possible to obtain unlimited\r\nquantities of nitrogen from the air for use of farm crops, and at very\r\nsmall cost, the inevitable conclusion is that the inexhaustible supply\r\nof nitrogen in the air is the store from which we must draw to maintain\r\na sufficient amount of this element in the soil for the most profitable\r\ncrop yields.\r\n\r\nIt is often stated that leguminous plants, such as clover, have power to\r\nobtain free nitrogen from the air. This is not strictly true. Red clover,\r\nfor example, has no power in itself to get nitrogen from the air. It is\r\ntrue, however, that the microscopic organisms[3] which commonly live in\r\ntubercles upon the roots of the clover plant do have the power to take\r\nfree nitrogen from the air and cause it to unite with other elements to\r\nform compounds suitable for plant food. The clover plant then draws upon\r\nthis combined nitrogen in the root tubercles, and makes use of it in its\r\nown growth, both in the tops and in the roots of the plant.\r\n\r\nThese nitrogen-gathering bacteria live in tubercles upon the roots of\r\nvarious leguminous plants,[4] such as red clover, white clover, alfalfa,\r\nsweet clover, cowpeas, soy beans, vetch, field-peas, garden-peas, field\r\nand garden beans, etc. These tubercles vary in size from a pinhead to a\r\npea, varying with the different kinds of plants, being especially small\r\nupon some of the clovers, and very large upon cowpeas and soy beans. The\r\ntubercles are, of course, easily seen with the eye, but the tubercle is\r\nonly the home of the bacteria, somewhat as the ball upon the willow twig\r\nis the home of the insects within. The bacteria themselves are far too\r\nsmall to be seen with the unaided eye, although they can be seen by means\r\nof the most powerful microscope. Several million bacteria may inhabit a\r\nsingle tubercle. It is not necessary to see the bacteria, because if we\r\nfind the tubercles upon the roots of the plant, we know that the bacteria\r\nare present within, as otherwise the tubercle would not be formed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the plant itself, as clover, for example, has no power to\r\nfeed upon the free or uncombined nitrogen in the air, yet these\r\nnitrogen-gathering bacteria do have the power to absorb the free nitrogen\r\nand cause it to combine with other elements, forming nitrates or other\r\ncompounds which are suitable forms of nitrogen for plant food.\r\n\r\nIt has also been demonstrated that, as a rule, there are different\r\nspecies of nitrogen-gathering bacteria for markedly different species\r\nof leguminous plants. Thus we have one kind of bacteria for red clover,\r\nanother kind for cowpeas, another kind for soy beans, and still a\r\ndifferent kind for alfalfa.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED CLOVER BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat clover has no power in itself to gather atmospheric nitrogen,\r\nand that the bacteria do have power to feed the clover plant with\r\nnitrogen gathered from the air is very easy to demonstrate. It is one\r\nof the regular laboratory practices of the students in soil fertility\r\nin the Agricultural College to make this demonstration. Plate 1 is an\r\nillustration of such student work. The two pots which are shown were\r\nprovided with all elements of plant food, excepting the one element\r\nnitrogen. Thus far the two pots are exactly alike. Each contains no\r\nnitrogen, as indicated by the label “No N.” Each pot is planted with the\r\nsame number of red clover seeds. To the right-hand pot, however, some\r\nbacteria (“Bac.”) were added, while none were added to the left-hand\r\npot. These bacteria were obtained by taking about one pound of soil from\r\na clover-field where abundance of tubercles were found on the clover\r\nroots, adding this soil to about one quart of pure water, shaking for a\r\nfew minutes, allowing the soil to settle, then taking a small quantity\r\nof almost clear solution, and adding it to the pot which we wished to\r\ninoculate with the red clover bacteria. Aside from the addition of these\r\nmicroscopic bacteria to the right-hand pot, these two pots were treated\r\nexactly alike throughout the experiment. It will be plainly seen that\r\nwhere the bacteria were added the clover was furnished with sufficient\r\nnitrogen to make a strong and luxuriant growth, while without the\r\nbacteria the clover (in the left-hand pot) only germinated and made what\r\nlittle growth it could with the small amount of nitrogen contained in the\r\nseed. This result is the difference between success and failure of the\r\nclover crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 1. RED CLOVER: EFFECT OF BACTERIA. NO NITROGEN IN\r\nTHE SOIL OF EITHER POT.]\r\n\r\nIn general the clover bacteria are well distributed over the northern and\r\ncentral part of Illinois, but we now have some very strong evidence that\r\nthey are not well distributed in some soils of large area in southern\r\nIllinois. There is also some evidence that they were not originally\r\npresent even in the soils where they are now found in great abundance;\r\nand, furthermore, it seems very probable that these bacteria may cease to\r\nlive in a soil where they have once been present, provided clover is not\r\ngrown on the land for several years.\r\n\r\nIt will help us to understand this matter if we bear in mind that the\r\nhome of these bacteria is the tubercle upon the clover root. It is quite\r\nevident that they will continue to live upon the decaying tubercles or\r\nroots for three or four years after the clover plant has been killed. On\r\nthe other hand, we have some notable evidence that the bacteria do not\r\ncontinue to live in a soil after five or six years’ continuous cropping\r\nwith absolutely no clover growing on the land during those years. It\r\nis a simple matter for any one to determine whether the bacteria are\r\npresent or not, for the tubercles which are formed if the bacteria are\r\npresent are plainly seen attached to small roots. They look somewhat like\r\nminiature potatoes, varying in size from pinheads on clover to peas on\r\nsoy beans or cowpeas. (See Plates 2 and 4.) It is important to remember\r\nthat the bacteria live in the soil and not in the seed.\r\n\r\nWhen clover is cut for seed, it is frequently left to lie upon the ground\r\nuntil the straw becomes half rotten and very dirty; and, consequently\r\nwhen it is threshed, it practically always happens that there is at least\r\nsome small amount of dust and dirt taken with the seed. This dirt is\r\nalmost sure to carry with it some bacteria from the soil. If these few\r\nbacteria are scattered with the clover seed when it is sowed they will\r\ninoculate at least a few plants, and if they are allowed to multiply on\r\nthese plants, and especially if the same field is repeatedly seeded with\r\nclover, the soil will ultimately become thoroughly infected with the\r\nclover bacteria. Of course they may be carried from one part of the farm\r\nto another, or even from one farm to another, by various agencies, as\r\ndust or wind storms, surface drainage or flood waters, manure made from\r\nclover hay, implements used in cultivating the soil, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nMany of the older farmers of Illinois have stated to the writer that\r\nwhen this country was very new it was commonly found difficult to get a\r\n“catch” of clover on new land. After a good “catch” was once gotten, then\r\nit was easier to get clover to grow on that land the next time. There was\r\na saying among the farmers that clover would not do well until they got\r\nthe “wild nature” out of the land. Their final success was undoubtedly\r\ndue, not to getting anything out of the land, but rather to getting the\r\nbacteria into the land. Several Illinois farmers have reported some quite\r\nremarkable results from very light applications of the clover chaff or\r\nstraw (obtained in hulling clover) in its beneficial effect on clover\r\non land where it was otherwise difficult to get a “catch.” There is a\r\nsomewhat general belief among farmers of long experience that clover\r\nstraw or chaff has some special value in getting a catch of clover aside\r\nfrom its value as manure or for the seed which it sometimes contains.\r\n\r\nManager F. A. Warner of the Sibley Estate, Ford County, recently stated\r\nto the writer that they had had very great difficulty to get clover to\r\ngrow when they first began growing clover on that large estate, some six\r\nor eight years ago, although, after a good crop was once secured, they\r\nrarely had any further difficulty in getting a catch of clover on the\r\nsame land.\r\n\r\nOn the common gray prairie soil of the Lower Illinoisan Glaciation,\r\nin southern Illinois, the commonest type of soil in more than twenty\r\ncounties, practically no red clover is grown. In the spring of 1903 we\r\nseeded red clover on that type of soil in three places; namely, on the\r\nUniversity of Illinois soil experiment fields near Edgewood, Effingham\r\nCounty, near Du Bois, Washington County, and near Cutler, Perry County.\r\nOn certain plots the soil acidity had been corrected with lime and an\r\nabundant supply of phosphorus (in bone meal) had been provided, potassium\r\nalso having been added on some plots. These fields were carefully\r\nexamined the latter part of June, and at Cutler and Du Bois the clover\r\nwas found to be dead or dying, and no tubercles could be found upon the\r\nclover roots, although on the clover which had been seeded at about the\r\nsame time on the University fields at Urbana the root tubercles were\r\nfound in great abundance. At Edgewood a few tubercles were found and the\r\nclover appeared to be growing fairly well. Infected red clover soil was\r\nat once procured and scattered over the fields at Edgewood, Du Bois,\r\nand Cutler, but it was evidently too late to be of any marked benefit.\r\nAt Cutler and at Du Bois the clover was a complete failure. (It will be\r\ntried again next year.) At Edgewood it continued to grow fairly well,\r\nand its progress next season (1904) will be watched with much interest.\r\nIt should be stated that the Experiment Station has been growing clover\r\nfor several years with varying degrees of failure on land adjoining the\r\npresent clover field at Edgewood, and it is possible that this year’s\r\napparent success from the start is due in part at least to the bacteria\r\nwhich have been incidentally introduced and multiplied year after year\r\nand scattered over the adjoining land by wind and dust storms. Before the\r\nclose of the season the tubercles developed in abundance on the roots of\r\nthe clover at Edgewood.\r\n\r\nAn experience reported by Professor Herbert W. Mumford, of the Animal\r\nHusbandry Department of this university, will be of interest and value\r\nin this connection. Professor Mumford commonly grows clover in his\r\nrotations on his own private farm, but he states that at one time one\r\nparticular field was cropped continuously with timothy, oats, and corn\r\nfor some six years or more without any clover whatever. It was then again\r\nseeded to clover, but the crop made a complete failure, although on other\r\nland where clover had been grown more recently a successful clover crop\r\nwas grown from the same kind of seed seeded at about the same time.\r\nThe following year this particular field was again seeded to clover.\r\nThis time the “catch” was not a total failure, but it was too poor to\r\nsave, and it was plowed up and the land again seeded to clover the next\r\nyear, and an excellent catch of clover resulted. After this, clover was\r\nfrequently grown on this field, and no special difficulty was had in\r\ngetting good crops.\r\n\r\nWhile the failure of clover may often be due to drouth, and in some\r\nplaces due to soil acidity (lack of lime), and sometimes even due to\r\nan insufficient supply of available phosphorus or of potassium, we now\r\nknow with certainty that it sometimes fails because of the absence of\r\nthe nitrogen-gathering bacteria, especially on land which has never\r\ngrown clover, and probably also on land which has not grown it recently.\r\nWe should always remember that the bacteria do not thrive in strongly\r\nacid soils. Even though they may sometimes live in such soils and\r\nperhaps produce some tubercles upon the roots of certain hardy, strong\r\ngrowing legumes, like cowpeas, nevertheless we are obtaining some strong\r\nevidence that in such acid soils they have but little power to gather\r\nnitrogen from the air. That ground limestone is the most economical\r\nand satisfactory material to use in correcting the acidity of soils is\r\nstrongly indicated by the information we have thus far obtained. On\r\nthe upland prairie soils of the Lower Illinoisan Glaciation where red\r\nclover has never been grown successfully, largely because of the acidity\r\nof the soil, it will undoubtedly be helpful and profitable not only to\r\ncorrect the acidity of the soil with ground limestone, but also to secure\r\ninfected soil from some field of timber land or bottom land where red\r\nclover is growing, well provided with root tubercles, and inoculate the\r\nfield with it. This soil should be collected to a depth of three or four\r\ninches and scattered over the prairie land at the rate of a few hundred\r\npounds per acre at the time the clover is seeded or before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COWPEA BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate 2 is made from a photograph of a cowpea root with the tubercles\r\nupon it. This illustration shows the cowpea tubercles at nearly natural\r\nsize, which is about as large as the seed of ordinary garden peas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 2. COWPEA ROOT TUBERCLES, NATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\nThe cowpea bacteria are already quite widely distributed in southern\r\nIllinois, especially where this crop has been grown for several years,\r\nbut they are not common in the soils of other parts of the state. It\r\nis doubtful, however, if it is necessary or even worth while to take\r\nthe trouble to inoculate soil for cowpeas. Some few tubercles almost\r\ninvariably develop on cowpea roots the first year they are seeded,\r\neven where they have never been grown before, and if seeded the second\r\nyear on the same land the plants are usually abundantly provided with\r\nroot tubercles. Just why the cowpea bacteria develop so rapidly even\r\nwithout special inoculation is not definitely known. It may be that the\r\nsame bacteria also live on some other leguminous plant which is more or\r\nless widely distributed over the state, but it seems more likely that\r\nthe bacteria are brought with the seed. As a matter of fact, the cowpea\r\nharvest is usually dirty. This is an annual plant, and consequently the\r\ncrop is grown on recently plowed land and is sometimes cultivated during\r\nthe season. Cowpeas are commonly harvested with a mowing machine and then\r\nraked up on the loose ground. When they are threshed more or less dirt\r\nremains with the seed. Furthermore, the seed coats are not infrequently\r\ncracked, thus providing an excellent place for the lodgment of particles\r\nof soil.\r\n\r\nWhether it would be profitable to inoculate the land for cowpeas would\r\ndepend very largely upon the difficulty or cost of obtaining the infected\r\nmaterial. If soil thoroughly infected with the cowpea bacteria can be\r\nscattered over the land at the rate of about 2,000 pounds to the acre\r\nat a cost of $1.00 or less per ton, it might prove profitable. It is\r\ndoubtful if a light application of 100 or 200 pounds would produce any\r\nvery marked effect in the yield the first season. After the soil becomes\r\nwell infected the cowpeas then obtain much nitrogen from the air, and the\r\nyield of cowpeas is likely to be largely increased. Of course there is no\r\nfixation of atmospheric nitrogen if there are no tubercles on the roots.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 several plots of cowpeas were seeded on the soil experiment\r\nfield at the university. One of those plots (404) had become thoroughly\r\ninfected with the cowpea bacteria because of its being so situated that\r\nmore or less surface drainage water flowed over it from an adjacent field\r\nupon which cowpeas had been grown for three successive years. Another\r\nplot (408), owing to a slightly different situation, had not become\r\ninfected. The two plots were seeded in July after a crop of oats had been\r\nremoved from the land. Within three weeks after seeding, numerous root\r\ntubercles could be found on the plants on the infected plot. Later on,\r\nten average consecutive plants were taken up as completely as possible,\r\nand 412 tubercles were found on the roots, making an average of more than\r\n40 tubercles to the plant. On Plot 408 only an occasional plant was found\r\ninfected, and such plants would usually have only a single large tubercle\r\non their roots. Ten average plants not infected were collected from Plot\r\n408 for comparison with the ten infected plants from Plot 404.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 3. COWPEAS; EFFECT OF BACTERIA IN ORDINARY ILLINOIS\r\nBLACK PRAIRIE SOIL.]\r\n\r\nPlate 3 shows these two bunches of plants, the infected plants with root\r\ntubercles on the _right_, and the plants without tubercles on the _left_.\r\nFour more sets of ten plants each were then collected, two sets from Plot\r\n404 and two from Plot 408. Each set of infected plants was separated into\r\nthree parts, (1) tops, (2) roots, (3) tubercles; and each set of plants\r\nnot infected was separated into (1) tops, and (2) roots. All of these\r\nsamples were dried and analyzed for nitrogen. The results obtained are\r\nshown in Table 1.\r\n\r\nThe results clearly show the very great value of the nitrogen-gathering\r\nbacteria in growing cowpeas. In each of the separate trials A, B, and C,\r\nthe infected plants contained about twice as much total dry matter as the\r\nplants not infected. The infected plants also contained a much higher\r\npercent of nitrogen than the plants not infected, the infected plants\r\ncontaining 4.09 to 4.33 percent in the tops and 1.45 to 1.53 percent in\r\nthe roots, while those not infected contained only 2.32 to 2.69 percent\r\nin the tops and .88 percent in the roots. Besides this, the tubercles\r\non the infected plants contain 5.76 to 6.05 percent of nitrogen. In\r\nthese young and rapidly growing plants the tubercles are much richer in\r\nnitrogen than any other part of the plant. It should be stated that as\r\nthe plants approach maturity the nitrogen is largely absorbed from the\r\ntubercles and stored in the tops and roots. At the time these plants were\r\ntaken up the tubercles actually contained more nitrogen than the roots.\r\nThe infected plants contained nearly four times as much nitrogen as the\r\nplants not infected, and about three-fourths of the total nitrogen in the\r\ninfected plants was obtained from the air. The roots and tubercles of\r\nthe infected plants contained six to seven times as much nitrogen as the\r\nroots of the plants not infected.\r\n\r\nTABLE I.—FIXATION OF NITROGEN BY COWPEAS.\r\n\r\n    =============================+========+========+========+=========\r\n              COWPEA PLANTS.     |  Dry   |Nitrogen|Nitrogen|Nitrogen\r\n    -----------------+-----------+ matter,|content,|amount, |fixed by\r\n          No.        |   Part    |  cgs.  |percent.| cgs.   |bacteria,\r\n                     |           |        |        |        | cgs.\r\n    -----------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n    A1—Ten plants,   | Tops      |  3580  |  4.09  |   146  |\r\n    with bacteria    | Roots     |   620  |  1.45  |     9  |\r\n    present.         | Tubercles |   190  |  5.97  |    11  |\r\n                     |           |  ----  |        |   ---  |\r\n                     | Total     |  4390  |        |   166  | 125\r\n                     |           +--------+--------+--------+\r\n    A2—Ten plants,   | Tops      |  1560  |  2.42  |    38  |\r\n    without bacteria | Roots     |   300  |   .88  |     3  |\r\n                     |           |  ----  |        |   ---  |\r\n                     | Total     |  1860  |        |    41  |\r\n    -----------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n    B1—Ten plants,   | Tops      |  3970  |  4.31  |   171  |\r\n    with bacteria    | Roots     |   690  |  1.47  |    10  |\r\n    present.         | Tubercles |   300  |  6.05  |    18  |\r\n                     |           |  ----  |        |   ---  |\r\n                     | Total     |  4960  |        |   199  | 140\r\n                     |           +--------+--------+--------+\r\n    B2—Ten plants,   | Tops      |  2060  |  2.69  |    55  |\r\n    without bacteria | Roots     |   430  |   .88  |     4  |\r\n                     |           |  ----  |        |   ---  |\r\n                     | Total     |  2490  |        |    59  |\r\n    -----------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n    C1—Ten plants,   | Tops      |  3300  |  4.33  |   143  |\r\n    with bacteria    | Roots     |   520  |  1.53  |     8  |\r\n    present.         | Tubercles |   290  |  5.76  |    17  |\r\n                     |           |  ----  |        |   ---  |\r\n                     | Total     |  4110  |        |   168  | 124\r\n                     |           +--------+--------+--------+\r\n    C2—Ten plants,   | Tops      |  1730  |  2.32  |    40  |\r\n    without bacteria | Roots     |   400  |   .88  |     4  |\r\n                     |           |  ----  |        |   ---  |\r\n                     | Total     |  2130  |        |    44  |\r\n    -----------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOY BEAN BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoy bean bacteria are evidently much less likely to be carried with\r\nthe seed than are the cowpea bacteria. The soy bean plant grows more\r\nerectly than the cowpea (see Circular No. 69, “The Cowpea and Soy Bean in\r\nIllinois”), and the crop is quite commonly harvested with a self-binder\r\nwhich keeps it quite free from dirt. The soy bean seed is nearly round\r\nand smooth, and the seed coat is not commonly cracked. These facts may\r\nexplain why the soy bean seed carry so few bacteria as compared with\r\ncowpeas.\r\n\r\nOn one of the soil experiment fields on the university farm at Urbana,\r\nwhere soy beams have been grown for three years, no tubercles could\r\nbe found on the plants either the first or second year, and only an\r\noccasional plant with tubercles could be found the third year. In 1902 a\r\nseries of plots, some of which had been treated in different ways with\r\napplications of limestone, phosphorus, and potassium, were seeded with\r\nsoy beans. No tubercles could be found at any time during the season on\r\nthe soy beans growing on any of the different plots. In 1903 the same\r\nplots were again seeded to soy beans, and at the same time part of each\r\nplot was inoculated with infected soy bean soil drilled in with the seed\r\nat the rate of about 500 pounds of infected soil to the acre. When the\r\nplants were only a few weeks old tubercles were to be found upon many\r\nplants growing where the infected soil had been applied, and before the\r\nclose of the season at least half of these plants in the inoculated part\r\nof the field had one or more tubercles upon their roots, and some plants\r\ncould be found whose roots were abundantly provided with tubercles. (See\r\nPlate 4.)\r\n\r\nOn the uninoculated part of the field soy bean plants were examined\r\nprobably fifty times during the season, several plants being taken\r\nup each time, but not a single tubercle was found at any time,\r\nnotwithstanding that this was the second crop of soy beans upon this\r\nsoil. Of course the inoculated part of the field did not become\r\nsufficiently infected to markedly benefit the 1903 crop, but it is\r\nplanned to grow soy beans upon this field again in 1904 when the bacteria\r\nwill doubtless have multiplied sufficiently to produce marked results in\r\nthe growth of the crop.\r\n\r\nFrom these and from other somewhat similar experiments it is concluded\r\nthat as a rule soy beans should be inoculated when they are first seeded,\r\nand that they should then be grown a second year upon the same land. If\r\nsoy beans are afterward grown upon this land once in every three or four\r\nyears, the soil will doubtless remain well infected with the soy bean\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that 100 pounds of infected soy bean soil per acre will\r\nbe sufficient to produce a thorough infection the second year, and it\r\nis improbable that one ton of infected soil per acre would produce a\r\nthorough inoculation the first season. One ton is only twenty times 100\r\npounds, while one tubercle which will be produced during a single season\r\nfrom a single bacterium may contain many million bacteria, thus it will\r\nbe seen that it will be more economical to inoculate rather lightly\r\nand allow the bacteria to multiply themselves rather than to inoculate\r\nheavily at great expense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 4. SOY BEAN ROOT TUBERCLES, NATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\nIt may be stated that the infected soy bean soil used in these\r\nexperiments was obtained from Mr A. A. Hinkley of Du Bois, Illinois, who\r\nhas been growing soy beans on the same land for many years until it has\r\nbecome well infected. Mr. Hinkley has consented to furnish infected soy\r\nbean soil so far as he is able to do without serious interference with\r\nhis regular work, to any one who may desire it, at a price which will\r\ncover his expense and loss. This will probably amount to about $1.00 for\r\nthe first 100 pounds and fifty cents for each additional 100 pounds, in\r\nthe shipment, including the cost of bags, the purchaser to pay freight\r\nfrom Bois station, which is located in Washington County, Illinois, on\r\nthe Illinois Central Railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALFALFA AND SWEET CLOVER BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat soil inoculation with alfalfa bacteria is commonly of very great\r\nvalue in growing alfalfa has been shown very conclusively by the\r\ninvestigations reported in Bulletin No. 76,[6] “Alfalfa on Illinois\r\nSoil.” In some places, however, inoculation was found to be unnecessary.\r\nA careful and extensive investigation of alfalfa growing in different\r\nparts of Illinois revealed the fact, as stated in Bulletin 76, “that the\r\nalfalfa bacteria are certainly present in some places in the state while\r\nin most other places they are certainly not present in sufficient number\r\nto become of appreciable assistance to the alfalfa within three or four\r\nyears, and the question naturally arises how it happens that some fields\r\nare already infected while others are not.” It was suggested in that\r\nbulletin that the alfalfa bacteria may “live on some other plants besides\r\nalfalfa and that one of these plants is native or has been introduced\r\nin certain sections” of the state. It was also suggested “that a few\r\nbacteria are always carried with alfalfa seed, and that if the alfalfa\r\nis grown continuously or repeatedly in any place the soil will finally\r\nbecome thoroughly infected, and the bacteria will then be carried by\r\nflood waters, dust storms, etc., over adjoining fields, and possibly for\r\nlong distances, especially along river valleys.” This latter suggestion\r\nwas known to be a fact at the time it was written; and subsequent\r\ninvestigations have furnished conclusive proof that the alfalfa bacteria\r\ndo live upon another plant; namely, the ordinary sweet clover (_melilotus\r\nalba_). This is a rank-growing leguminous plant, frequently reaching a\r\nheight of four to six feet. When young it markedly resembles alfalfa, but\r\nit can easily be distinguished by its characteristic odor when cut or\r\nbruised, as by rubbing between the hands. As the sweet clover approaches\r\nmaturity it differs very much from alfalfa. The sweet clover grows very\r\ntall, and usually branches from a main stem. It has white flowers (there\r\nis also a less common yellow variety), and the seeds are borne in small\r\nround pods (usually containing only one or two seeds each), arranged on\r\nlong slender spikes, each spike bearing many pods. The alfalfa commonly\r\ngrows about two and a half feet high, with many stems growing from the\r\ncrown of the root, especially after it is two or three years old. It\r\nbears purple flowers and peculiar spiral-shaped seed pods. Sweet clover\r\nis a biennial plant, dying after reaching maturity, which commonly\r\noccurs the second year of its growth. Like many other biennial plants,\r\nit probably often lives more than two years if not allowed to produce\r\nseed. Alfalfa is a perennial plant, and it is said that there are alfalfa\r\nfields which have been cut annually for more than fifty years without\r\nreseeding. The similarity of alfalfa and sweet clover when young, and\r\nalso the similarity of the tubercles formed on the roots of each have\r\nlong been noticed, and the possibility of the same bacteria living upon\r\nboth plants has already been suggested in the agricultural press.\r\n\r\nDuring the season of 1903 the writer spent some time in the northern\r\npart of Illinois in connection with the general and detail surveys of\r\nIllinois soil. Many new fields of alfalfa were observed, and they were\r\ncarefully examined for root tubercles. In Winnebago County, where sweet\r\nclover is very prevalent along roadsides and in waste places, it was\r\nnoted that the abundance of root tubercles on the alfalfa plants seemed\r\nto be closely related to the presence of sweet clover in the vicinity,\r\nstrongly indicating that the bacteria which live upon sweet clover were\r\nalso at home upon the alfalfa roots. These indications were strengthened\r\nby further investigations in Lake County, especially upon the Fowler\r\nfarm, near Lake Villa, where a field of alfalfa seeded last spring\r\nwithout artificial inoculation was found to be thoroughly infected with\r\nthe bacteria, and growing vigorously with a good dark green color. This\r\nfield had a few sweet clover plants growing in it, and the borders of the\r\nfield were covered with sweet clover. Other fields of alfalfa seeded in\r\nthe neighborhood at the same time, but upon soils where sweet clover had\r\nnot grown near by, were apparently complete failures, many of the plants\r\nhaving died and most of those still living being only a few inches high,\r\nvery weak, and yellow or pale green in color.[7]\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain more absolute knowledge regarding this important\r\nsubject, a series of pot culture experiments has been carried on under\r\ncontrolled conditions in the pot culture laboratory at the university.\r\nFive pots were filled with sterilized sand which was practically devoid\r\nof plant food. A supply of phosphorus, potassium, and all other mineral\r\nelements necessary for the growth of plants was added to each of the five\r\npots, care being taken to keep the sand practically free of combined\r\nnitrogen. Alfalfa seed were then planted in each of the five pots, and at\r\nthe same time four of the five pots were inoculated as follows:\r\n\r\nPot No. 1.—Not inoculated (check pot).\r\n\r\nPot No. 2.—Inoculated with bacteria obtained from infected alfalfa soil.\r\n\r\nPot No. 3.—Inoculated with bacteria obtained from alfalfa root tubercles.\r\n\r\nPot No. 4.—Inoculated with bacteria obtained from infected sweet clover\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nPot No. 5.—Inoculated with bacteria obtained from sweet clover root\r\ntubercles.\r\n\r\nPlate 5 clearly shows the results obtained and certainly furnishes\r\nconclusive proof that the same effect is produced upon the growth of the\r\nalfalfa whether the nitrogen-gathering bacteria used for the inoculation\r\nare obtained from alfalfa soil, from alfalfa tubercles, from sweet clover\r\nsoil, or from sweet clover tubercles. It also illustrates the importance\r\nof bacteria in growing alfalfa as will be seen by comparing the four\r\ninoculated pots with the uninoculated pot, which is No. 1, on the left in\r\neach series of views. The upper view was taken when the alfalfa plants\r\nwere five weeks old; the next series when they were six weeks old; the\r\nnext, seven weeks old; and the lower series when they were eight weeks\r\nold, from the time of seeding.\r\n\r\nA duplicate series of pots prepared in exactly the same manner gave\r\nsimilar results.\r\n\r\nThe infected alfalfa soil was obtained from a field of three-year-old\r\nalfalfa, which was inoculated when first seeded, with infected alfalfa\r\nsoil obtained from an old alfalfa field in Kansas. About one pound of\r\nthis soil was shaken in a quart of water, the soil allowed to settle, and\r\nsome of the nearly clear solution used for the inoculation of Pot No. 2.\r\nThe alfalfa tubercles from which bacteria were obtained were carefully\r\nwashed in distilled water to free them from adhering soil particles, and\r\nthen rubbed up in distilled water, a small amount of this water being\r\nthen used for the inoculation of Pot No. 3. The infected sweet clover\r\nsoil was obtained from a place by the roadside where sweet clover was\r\ngrowing luxuriantly and well provided with root tubercles. This place was\r\nabout two miles from the nearest field ever seeded to alfalfa, so far as\r\nknown. A water extract from this soil was used to inoculate Pot No. 4.\r\nThe bacteria from sweet clover tubercles were obtained in the same manner\r\nas those from alfalfa tubercles, and were used to inoculate Pot No. 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 5. ALFALFA: EFFECT OF BACTERIA FROM ALFALFA AND FROM\r\nSWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nPot 1.—No bacteria.\r\n\r\nPots 2 and 3.—Bacteria from alfalfa.\r\n\r\nPots 4 and 5.—Bacteria from sweet clover.\r\n\r\nThe four series of photographs were taken five, six, seven and eight\r\nweeks from time of planting, respectively.]\r\n\r\nFrom these investigations we thus have conclusive evidence that infected\r\nsweet clover soil can be used for the inoculation of alfalfa fields,\r\nthe bacteria of the two plants acting the same. The infected soil may\r\nbe obtained from any place where the sweet clover is found growing with\r\nabundance of tubercles on its roots. The soil may be collected to a depth\r\nof three or four inches and scattered over the alfalfa field at the rate\r\nof 100 pounds or more to the acre. It is well to scatter the infected\r\nsoil at about the time the alfalfa is seeded, and harrow it in with the\r\nalfalfa seed, although it may be applied some days or even some weeks\r\nbefore seeding time, and probably it would be all right to apply the\r\ninfected soil the fall before, for it is known that the bacteria will\r\nlive in soil for several months, even though the soil be placed in sacks\r\nand allowed to become quite dry.\r\n\r\nInvestigations have shown that 100 pounds of thoroughly infected soil\r\nto the acre is sufficient to produce a very satisfactory inoculation\r\nwithin one year from the time it is applied. Of course, somewhat heavier\r\napplications may well be made if it can be done at small expense. The\r\ninfected soil need not be applied with any high degree of uniformity, but\r\nspecial care should be taken that the higher places and watersheds are\r\nnot missed in scattering it over the field. If a few square yards, or\r\neven square rods, should be missed on the slopes or lower land, it would\r\nmake but little difference, as the bacteria will be washed over such\r\nplaces from the higher land.\r\n\r\nAfter the soil becomes somewhat dry it is easily scattered by hand from\r\nthe wagon or from a sack which one can carry. Sometimes it is applied by\r\nmeans of an end gate seeder or a fertilizer drill, or it could be spread\r\nby a manure spreader with an application of manure.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises whether there is not danger of getting\r\nsome sweet clover seed with the infected sweet clover soil, and thus of\r\ngetting sweet clover mixed with the alfalfa in the field.\r\n\r\nIn the writer’s opinion there is little or nothing to fear in this\r\nmatter. In the first place, the amount of sweet clover seed thus obtained\r\nwould be very small, probably none at all, if one were careful to scrape\r\noff the vegetable matter, and perhaps a half inch of earth before\r\ncollecting the infected soil (most of the bacteria are probably between\r\none-half inch and six inches in depth, as most of the tubercles develop\r\nand decay between those depths); second; it is doubtful if a small amount\r\nof sweet clover hay would lessen the value of alfalfa hay in the least,\r\nfor stock frequently eat small amounts of sweet clover of their own\r\nchoice even when it is nearly mature, and if it is cut while still quite\r\nimmature and tender it makes quite satisfactory hay, so much so that in\r\nsome sections of the United States, particularly in the South, sweet\r\nclover is regularly seeded on fields and cut for hay, and it is found to\r\nbe a valuable and very nutritious feed, the live stock eating it in large\r\nquantities, and with apparent relish, after they have acquired a taste\r\nfor it; third, sweet clover is not known as a bad weed in the fields or\r\nmeadows, even where it has been a common roadside plant for many years,\r\nand, being naturally a biennial plant, if it were cut down every five or\r\nsix weeks, as we commonly cut alfalfa during the season, it would almost\r\ncertainly die out after a few years while alfalfa, a perennial plant,\r\nwould continue to live.\r\n\r\nOnly one instance has come to the writer’s attention where alfalfa has\r\nbeen growing for several years with sweet clover growing in the field or\r\nfence rows beside it. This is on the farm of Mr. D. S. Mayhew, of Mercer\r\nCounty, Illinois, who writes as follows regarding the matter:\r\n\r\n    “Will say that the sweet clover has made no headway in my\r\n    meadow, as it did not go to seed, on account of my cutting\r\n    it so often. The sweet clover got into the alfalfa in the\r\n    seed when I sowed it. I do not think it will do any harm in\r\n    a meadow, but I believe it would do harm in a pasture if it\r\n    wasn’t cut down as stock will not eat the sweet clover.”\r\n\r\nOf course if sweet clover should get into the field and persist in\r\ngrowing, and if it were found to injure the alfalfa appreciably or\r\nmarkedly, we can always resort to plowing the ground up and growing corn\r\nor other crops, thus obtaining some benefit from the leguminous crop for\r\nits fertilizing value, and at the same time completely eradicating the\r\nsweet clover, but leaving the soil well infected with alfalfa bacteria\r\nready to serve in case alfalfa should be again seeded within a few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general agriculture in Illinois, whether it be grain farming or\r\nordinary livestock farming, the growing of legumes is absolutely\r\nessential as a part of any economic system which shall maintain the\r\nfertility of the soil; and for the successful growing of legumes the\r\npresence and assistance of the proper species of nitrogen-gathering\r\nbacteria are also absolutely essential. These facts being granted, it\r\ncertainly follows that when sowing any legume on land, where the same\r\nlegume has never been grown before, or perhaps where it has not been\r\nsuccessfully grown within recent years, we should always consider the\r\nmatter of inoculation; and, unless there is good reason to believe that\r\nthe soil has been inoculated by the washing from other higher lying\r\nland where these bacteria are known to be present or by applications of\r\nmanure made from that legume, or by some other such incidental means; or\r\nunless there is evidence that the bacteria are carried with the seed in\r\nsufficient quantity to effect a satisfactory inoculation (as appears to\r\nbe the case with the cowpea), then we should inoculate the soil directly\r\nwith the specific bacteria required by the legume which we desire to grow.\r\n\r\nWhile some Illinois soils are becoming deficient in phosphorus and\r\nin lime, especially in the southern part of the state, and while\r\nphosphorus[8] and ground limestone can be applied to such soils with\r\nmarked benefit and profit, especially for the growing of legumes, there\r\nis abundant evidence that one of the dominant causes for the failure\r\nor unsatisfactory growth of some of our most valuable legumes, and on\r\nsome soils the sole cause of failure, is the absence of the proper\r\nnitrogen-gathering bacteria.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that any of the different species of\r\nnitrogen-gathering bacteria will live in the soil for more than a few\r\nyears[9] in the entire absence of any legume upon which they naturally\r\nlive, and the accumulating evidence strongly indicates that the bacteria\r\nwhich are present in places in our soils, such as the red clover\r\nbacteria, now found abundantly in many places in the state, especially\r\nin northern and central Illinois, the cowpea bacteria more common in\r\nsouthern Illinois, and the alfalfa or sweet clover bacteria, which are\r\nbecoming prevalent in some sections—that all these have been, and are\r\nbeing, gradually introduced and extended almost entirely by mere chance.\r\nOf course if the wagon-wheel, which carries the mud along the road,\r\ncarries with it sweet clover seed from one place to another, it may also\r\ncarry the sweet clover bacteria which live on the sweet clover roots.\r\n\r\nIt now seems absurd to suppose that there were red clover bacteria in\r\nIllinois soil before red clover itself was grown on Illinois soil, unless\r\nthe same bacteria live also upon some other legume which was native to\r\nour soils. There is some evidence that the vetch bacteria are native to\r\nour soil, possibly living upon the native wild vetches. At any rate,\r\ntubercles commonly develop on vetch roots without artificial inoculation.\r\nInvestigations are in progress to ascertain whether the notorious failure\r\nof crimson clover in Illinois may not be due in part, at least, to the\r\nabsence of the proper bacteria. (It has been stated by some writers that\r\nthe bacteria of crimson clover and those of red clover are identical, but\r\nwe already have some reason to doubt the accuracy of this statement.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It should be remembered that there are ten essential elements of\r\nplant food each of which is of equal importance to the plant, for if\r\nthe plant is deprived of any one of the ten essential elements it is\r\nimpossible for it to develop and mature. Carbon has no market value\r\nas plant food because the plant obtains carbon in the form of carbon\r\ndioxid, a gas which is present everywhere in the atmosphere and which the\r\nplant inhales through its leaves. Both hydrogen and oxygen are without\r\nmarket value because they are the elements which compose water, a liquid\r\ncompound which plants absorb through their roots. Calcium, magnesium,\r\niron, and sulfur have no market value as elements of plant food because\r\nthey are present in practically all soils in abundance as compared with\r\nthe amounts required in plant growth. The three elements nitrogen,\r\nphosphorus, and potassium, do have market values, because they are\r\nrequired by plants in very considerable quantities, and they are present\r\nin most soils in rather limited amounts, and when the available supply\r\nof any one of these elements becomes too much reduced in a soil the crop\r\nyield also becomes reduced. For further information regarding the use\r\nof these elements of plant food on Illinois soils, see Circular No. 68,\r\n“Methods of Maintaining the Productive Capacity of Illinois Soils.”\r\n\r\n[2] Technically this first step is preliminary to, and not a part of,\r\nnitrification.\r\n\r\n[3] Among the scientists who were prominent in making these discoveries\r\nregarding the action of bacteria in the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen\r\nwere Hellriegel, Willfarth, and Nobbe in Germany, Atwater in America,\r\nLawes and Gilbert in England, and Boussingault and Ville in France.\r\n\r\n[4] It may be well to call attention to the fact that there are numerous\r\ninstances where two different kinds of plants live together in intimate\r\npartnership relation. If only one of the two plants receives benefit from\r\nthis relationship or association, then the plant receiving the benefit is\r\ncelled a parasite. Thus the mistletoe is a parasite upon the elm or gum\r\nor other tree on which it lives. The mistletoe draws its nourishment from\r\nthe tree. The tree is injured rather than benefited by the mistletoe.\r\nDodder is also a parasitic plant, living upon other plants, except during\r\nthe early part of its growth. Ticks and lice are common examples of\r\nanimal parasites living upon other animals.\r\n\r\nIn some cases a relationship exists which is not parasitic but symbiotic.\r\nThe term symbiosis, which is commonly used by biologists to define\r\nthis relationship, means living together in mutual helpfulness. The\r\nassociation of bees and flowers may serve to illustrate this mutual\r\nhelpfulness, although this is not an example of intimate symbiosis. Thus\r\nthe bees obtain their food from the flowers and, in turn, the flowers,\r\nmany of them, are incapable of producing seed or fruit unless the pollen\r\nis carried from the male flower to the female flower by bees or other\r\nagencies. It is well known that plant lice and ants are mutually helpful.\r\n\r\nLikewise the association of nitrogen-gathering bacteria and leguminous\r\nplants is a relationship of mutual helpfulness and this is one of the\r\nbest illustrations of what is meant by symbiosis. The legume furnishes\r\na home for the bacteria and also furnishes in its juice or sap most of\r\nthe nourishment upon which the bacteria live. The bacteria, on the other\r\nhand, take nitrogen from the air contained in the pores of the soil, and\r\ncause this nitrogen to combine with other elements in suitable form for\r\nplant food which is then given up to the legume for its own nourishment.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of remarkable parasitism, if not, indeed, one of\r\ntrue symbiosis, is found in the common lichens living upon rocks and\r\ntrees. The lichen is not a single plant, but two plants—an alga, which\r\nlives upon the wood or stone, and a fungus which lives upon the alga.\r\nAlgæ also live in the free state separate from fungi, and the present\r\nopinion of botanists seems to be that when the two are associated in\r\nthe form of lichens this association is not detrimental, but rather\r\nbeneficial, to the alga, as well as to the parasitic fungus. If this is\r\ntrue, then it is another case of true symbiosis. (There is reason to\r\nbelieve that the fungus has some power to feed upon atmospheric nitrogen,\r\nand then to furnish combined nitrogen to the alga upon which it lives.)\r\n\r\nIn the symbiosis of leguminous plants and nitrogen-gathering bacteria we\r\nhave a partnership or relationship of immeasurable value to agriculture.\r\nHere is a class of plants (legumes) that are capable of consuming\r\nor utilizing nitrogen in quantities larger than could possibly be\r\nobtained from ordinary soils for any considerable length of time. They\r\nhave no power in themselves of taking nitrogen from the atmosphere,\r\nand to them the symbiotic relation with this low order of plants (the\r\nnitrogen-gathering bacteria) is especially helpful, and for the best\r\nresults it is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n[5] There are some noteworthy exceptions to this rule (see following\r\npages for illustration), and there is some evidence that, by a\r\ncomparatively long process of breeding, or evolution, the bacteria which\r\nnaturally live upon one kind of legume may gradually develop the power\r\nto live upon a distinctly different legume to which they were not at\r\nfirst adapted. Of course this process of forcing bacteria to live upon a\r\nlegume to which they are not naturally adapted has little or no practical\r\nvalue because it is unnecessary if there is a species of bacteria which\r\nnaturally lives upon the same legume. On the other hand, if, by any\r\nsuch process of breeding, or evolution, a species of nitrogen-gathering\r\nbacteria could be developed which could live on a non-leguminous plant,\r\nas corn, for example, it would be of incalculable practical value. As yet\r\nthe efforts of bacteriologists, working on this problem, have given only\r\nnegative results, so far as known to the writer.\r\n\r\n[6] In this connection attention is called to the fact that the so-called\r\n“spot disease” of alfalfa, which is not uncommon in the western states,\r\nespecially during wet seasons, became somewhat prevalent in Illinois\r\nin 1903. When the effect of this disease becomes marked, the leaves\r\nturn yellow and growth is retarded. If this occurs the alfalfa should\r\nbe clipped. This is the only effective remedy known to be practicable.\r\nSeeding alfalfa with a light nurse crop is gaining favor in Illinois.\r\n\r\n[7] Some of these observations have already been reported in the\r\nagricultural press. (See, for example, the Breeders’ Gazette, September\r\n9, 1903, page 391, and September 16, 1903, page 442.)\r\n\r\n[8] Steamed bone meal is the most economical and satisfactory form of\r\nphosphorus for use on Illinois soils, unless ground rock phosphate (not\r\nacid phosphate) shall prove to be still more economical. Experiments to\r\ndetermine this are in progress.\r\n\r\n[9] Just how long the bacteria will live in a soil without a leguminous\r\ncrop upon which they can feed is not definitely known. Certainly they\r\nlive for two or three years, but probably not more than five or six\r\nyears. Further investigation is needed to establish the length of time\r\nthe different kinds of bacteria may remain in the soil under different\r\nconditions.",
