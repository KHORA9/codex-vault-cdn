It is thus that the study of trees and plants,\r\nferns and field flowers, occupies and delights us. And a similar interest\r\nwould be found to attach to Seaside Pebbles, as one branch of mineralogy,\r\nif we could once come to observe and understand them.\r\n\r\nBut while the marine shells of England have been all numbered and\r\nclassified, and even the seaweeds are emerging out of dim confusion into\r\nthe order of botanical arrangement, there is no popular work extant on\r\nthe subject of our pebbles.\r\n\r\nDr. Mantell, indeed, published an elegant little volume, entitled\r\n“Thoughts on a Pebble;” but he therein treats of a single species, the\r\n_Choanite_; whereas, we have other fossil creatures beside Choanites\r\npreserved in the heart of siliceous pebbles; and our shores yield from\r\ntime to time varieties of agate and jasper, differing from the oriental,\r\nand some of them of great beauty.\r\n\r\nIn the present treatise, an attempt has been made to commend this subject\r\nto more general attention, by grouping together many scattered facts and\r\nmethodizing the results. Learned disquisitions and technical terms have\r\nbeen as much as possible avoided; but in the concluding chapters, sundry\r\ninteresting points in natural philosophy bearing upon the subject are\r\nhandled rather more scientifically; and here, some original matter will\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nThe coloured plates are after drawings by a well-known and ingenious\r\nartist;[1] the original specimens being in my own collection. They have\r\nbeen carefully and faithfully executed, and are on the same scale as the\r\npebbles themselves.\r\n\r\nIf this essay of mine should induce any one possessed of ampler leisure\r\nand more adequate powers to enter more largely upon the merits of the\r\ntheme, I shall be indeed gratified.\r\n\r\n                                                           J. G. FRANCIS.\r\n\r\n_Isle of Wight, 1859._\r\n\r\n[1] M. W. S. Coleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEACH RAMBLES, ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    ASPECT OF A BEACH, AND ITS PROBABLE ORIGIN.—TRUE NATURE OF THE\r\n    PEBBLES WHICH COMPOSE IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know of few things more pleasant than to ramble for a mile along one\r\nof our southern beaches in the early days of autumn. We get the sniff of\r\nthe sea-breeze; we see prismatic colours dappling the water, or curiously\r\nreflected from capes of wet sand; solemn, beetling cliffs, broken here\r\nand there by a green slope, rise on one side of us; while, on the other,\r\nwe are enchanted by the wild music of the waves, as they dash noisily\r\nupon the shingle at our feet, and then trickle back with faint, lisping\r\nmurmurs into the azure gulf.\r\n\r\nAlpine scenery is majestic, and river-lit landscapes are delicious; but\r\nthey seem as pictures of still life compared with the stir and resonance\r\nof the shore and the ocean. The breeze which bends the standing corn\r\ndoes not impart so much pleasure as that which dimples the bay at the\r\nfoot of our rustic garden; the thunder-cloud resting on a mountain is\r\nnot so impressive as that huge wall of inky blackness, which seems as if\r\nit would choke the very light and air while it gathers on the horizon,\r\nbut will presently rend asunder and purify the overcharged atmosphere by\r\nlaunching a tempest upon the face of the deep.\r\n\r\nThere are few persons who, after spending one or two consecutive summers\r\nat Eastbourne, or in the Isle of Wight, can repress an ardent longing to\r\nvisit similar scenes from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe sea-side stroll has, however, been accused of monotony. But this\r\nis either by really incompetent judges, or by inveterate sportsmen, to\r\nwhom the neighbourhood of the ocean suggests nothing more apposite than\r\na meet with harriers on the downs, or a raid upon puzzled rabbits in\r\nsome outlying warren, with the aid of a keeper, ferrets, and “varmint”\r\ndogs. To such, even a brief sojourn on the simple-featured coast may,\r\nundoubtedly, prove wearisome; but the fault rests with themselves. For,\r\nall the while, others, who are better informed and more awake to what\r\nlies around them, will be cheerfully occupied in kindred pursuits at the\r\nfoot of the cliff, or away on the beach, or far out, at low tide, among\r\nthe weedy rocks and sand. Here they hunt the cockle and the razor-shell,\r\ncollect bright algæ and marvellous zoophytes, or search for agates and\r\nfossils among the endless heaps of shingle.\r\n\r\nThe delicate actiniæ and the rarer sea-weeds cannot be obtained in\r\nwinter; but the pebbles, which are intended to form the subject of this\r\nlittle book, may always be met with; and the changes induced by rough\r\nwinds and surging tides, yield them in even greater abundance.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure of collecting pebbles has been greatly enhanced, to my\r\nmind, by considering how it is that we come to have pebbly beaches at\r\nall. Inevitable as these may appear to some people, they are quite a\r\nphenomenon in their way, and to the full as deserving our attention as\r\nthe colony in a rabbit-warren.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the land alone possesses such materials; but it is the sea\r\nwhich finds them out; and these two facts, put side by side, have\r\nsometimes reminded me of the arbitrary allotment of the sexes in the old\r\nmythology. _Oceanus_ being an enterprising gentleman. _Terra_ (always\r\nfeminine) is the quiescent lady, to whom he pays his court. She carries a\r\nprodigious number of these treasures in her flinty bosom; but it is only\r\nhe, and his friends the rivers, who can get at them and draw them forth.\r\nIn our English Channel, Ocean is as fond of doing this, and of fringing\r\nhis waterline with a brown pebbly border, as other gentlemen are,\r\nnow-a-days, of wearing, if possible, a beard like that of the Sophi. Nor\r\nis this surprising, when we remember that all creatures naturally desire\r\nsomething which they have not got. For the bottom of the sea itself is no\r\nbeach at all, but chalk or sand, and sometimes hardened sandstone, with,\r\nI dare say, many precipitous pits and hollows, and many pointed crags.\r\nHere, gigantic fronds of the oar-weed wave to and fro among thousands of\r\nacres of dulse and bladderwrack; while porpoises and dog-fish dive, and\r\nlimpets and mussels crawl, and arrowy lobsters shoot through the cerulean\r\ngloom, and (if Mr. Tennyson may be believed) mermen and mermaids play at\r\nhide-and-seek. Wonderful things there must be, if we could only spy them\r\nout; but I do not think many pebbles. Whereas, our mother Earth teems\r\nwith these latter. There are jaspers in the conglomerate, and agates in\r\nthe mountain rocks, and veins of porphyry and serpentine in the trap\r\nand basalt, and garnets and sapphires in the granite, and flint-nodules\r\nin the chalk, and quartz-crystals almost everywhere. Probably these\r\nexist, also, in many of the submarine strata; but unless a volcanic\r\neruption should occur, there is no force in operation there to dislodge\r\nthem. The bed of the ocean, and all depths of it below a hundred feet\r\nperpendicular,[2] as _divers_ well know, remain calm and still, even when\r\na tempest is raging above. But on what we are pleased to call “terra\r\nfirma,” the case is reversed. Solid as the ground appears, all is subject\r\nto elemental change and motion; and whenever the waves of the sea or the\r\nstrong current of a river can plough some crumbling chine, or wear away\r\nthe face of a cliff, down come the imbedded pebbles and crystals, and\r\ngradually form a _beach_ upon the margin of the ocean. And this beach\r\nis tossed up and down, and rolled to and fro, until most of the stones\r\ncomposing it have become as smooth as hazel-nuts.\r\n\r\nThe above may be rather a rough sketch of the source of a beach; but I\r\nbelieve it is correct in its leading features. In a subsequent chapter we\r\nmay better note certain peculiarities which are more than meet the eye.\r\n\r\nBut what are the pebbles themselves?\r\n\r\nMost persons have occasionally handled specimens of the precious stones\r\nor “gems;” but few of them, perhaps, are aware that our pebbles of\r\nthe road-side and sea-shore claim a common origin with these dazzling\r\ncrystals. Such is, however, the fact. Chemical analysis, availing itself\r\nof the blow-pipe, the solvent acids, and the voltaic battery, has\r\nsucceeded in determining the base of every known gem. And the earths\r\nwhich furnish such bases are chiefly two—ALUMINA, or clay, and SILICA, or\r\npure flint. From these, with an admixture of lime, and sometimes of iron,\r\nin small quantities, all the native gems are derived, with the exception\r\nof the diamond, whose base is CARBON.\r\n\r\nIntensely hard as these substances are, and apparently not susceptible of\r\nchange if left to themselves, they have probably passed through great\r\nchemical changes in the silent laboratory of Nature. For it is supposed\r\nthat our operations in analysis, if carefully conducted, merely bring\r\nback their subjects, by a kind of _reversing_ process, to their several\r\nprimitive bases.\r\n\r\nNow it is evident that the commoner pebbles are derived from these same\r\nearths, of clay or flint, albeit in a debased condition. For there\r\nis nothing else of which they could be made: neither do they exhibit\r\nany properties foreign to those which such substances possess. Yet,\r\nhow vast is the difference between an oriental gem and the brightest\r\nproduction of clay-pits or granite rocks. Not greater, however, than that\r\nbetween Damascus steel and coarse pig-iron; or, between French lawn and\r\nsail-cloth. And if Art can work such distinctions, why not Nature?\r\n\r\nIn fact, a perfect gem is a master-piece which chemistry and\r\ncrystallization have combined to elaborate, and which man has ransacked\r\nthe corners of the earth to obtain. The deep has been made to surrender\r\nits treasures to the diver or the sunken net: the rock has been blasted,\r\nand its inmost vein searched: the rushing river filtered, and its sand\r\nsifted: and the contents of the jeweller’s caskets are the result. Here\r\nmay be seen diamonds from Golconda; and rubies from Samarcand and Pegu:\r\nsapphires, emeralds, and amethysts from Persia, Arabia, and Armenia:\r\nthe topaz, blazing like fire, from the Indies or from the Ural: the\r\nturquoise, with its delicious blue, from Arabia and Palestine: the opal\r\nfrom Honduras: the blood-red garnet and amandine from Bohemia, Ceylon,\r\nand Greenland: the jacinth and the chrysoprase, the chrysolite and beryl,\r\nwith pure pearls of globular form, all from the land of the rising sun,\r\nwhile a deep brown jasper, rayed with stripes and rings as black as jet,\r\nhas travelled like a wandering palmer from sultry Egypt or the terrible\r\ndesert of Sinai.\r\n\r\nTo form and perfect the finer crystals, extremes of heat or cold appear\r\nto be necessary: whereas our clime has perhaps always been temperate.\r\nBeside this, it is probable that the mother-earth is not found pure with\r\nus. There is a kind of white clay, called “kaolin,” obtained in one\r\nparticular quarry near Meissen in Saxony, and met with nowhere else. From\r\nthis clay the exquisite Dresden porcelain is baked, and this clay cannot\r\nbe exactly imitated. A near approach to it has been made by mixing good\r\npotter’s clay with pounded chalcedony-flints; but still the _biscuit_\r\nso produced is never equal to that from the “kaolin.” In like manner, we\r\nmay suppose that the peculiar earth which exists in sapphires no longer\r\noccurs in our post-tertiary clay-beds.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we know that there are many different clays occurring in our\r\ngeological strata. We have the clays of the Lower Tertiary; the clay of\r\nthe Wealden; and the Kimmeridge and Oxford clays, both of which belong to\r\nthe Oolite. Also in these main divisions, sundry mineralogical varieties\r\nare comprised under a common name. But the great age of the granite\r\nformation renders it certain that from none of these clays could those\r\nsapphires have come (as to their _base_), which are born of the granite\r\nrock. Indeed, our existing beds of clay are more or less mingled with\r\nfelspar, and felspar is one of the “silicates;” whereas the blue sapphire\r\nis pure alumina free from all admixture of silica.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the great fields for gems are in India and the\r\nisland of Ceylon, and in certain parts of the Russian dominions. No very\r\nvaluable stones have as yet been obtained from Australia; although the\r\nvicinity of gold-mines has always been held to be prolific in at least\r\none kind: the “mother of ruby” being a roseate substance embedded in the\r\nrock, and generally met with alongside of a vein of gold. The topazes are\r\nnot equal to those from Saxony.\r\n\r\nAs to our own sea-girt Isle, it is surely as guiltless of indigenous\r\ngems, as of white elephants or birds of paradise. Had any such existed\r\nwith us, they must long ere this have been brought to light and appeared\r\nin the market. We have bored the plain to two hundred fathoms’ depth: we\r\nhave pierced the hillside in tunnels which extend for miles: geologists\r\nand antiquarians have delved and hammered and sifted: many curious\r\nfossils have turned up, and a world’s wealth in minerals, but never\r\nanything like a diamond or an oriental sapphire.\r\n\r\nIt is well that, to console us under such apparent poverty as to the\r\ngems, we possess the treasure an hundred-fold in other shapes, though\r\nderived from the same sources. Clay gives us no sapphires; but it floors\r\nour ponds and canals, furnishes our earthenware, and yields the bricks\r\nwhich have built the ribs of London. Carbon refuses to flash upon us in\r\nthe rays of an indigenous “brilliant,” but it feeds our furnaces, propels\r\nour steamers and locomotives, and cheers a million of household hearths\r\nunder the well-known form of Coal. And Iron is our national sceptre:\r\nit reddens here no jacinth or ruby; but it supplies us with spades and\r\nploughshares, lays down thousands of miles of railway, and has made\r\nEngland the forge and workshop of the known world for giant engines and\r\nmassive machinery.\r\n\r\nIf our wealth be less dazzling than that from Golconda or Peru, it is, we\r\nmay hope, more durable; flowing to us through a healthier channel, by the\r\nhonest labour and steady perseverance of the sons of the soil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat of a digression from the subject of Sea-side pebbles.\r\nBut then, as was said, the magnificent crystals are their near kindred;\r\nand in society the custom is to bring in any great connections we may\r\nhave, on the first fair opportunity: that once done, our _respectability_\r\nis supposed to be established.\r\n\r\n[2] On the banks of Newfoundland, and to the south of the Cape of Good\r\nHope, extraordinary exceptions occur to this rule; the sea being there\r\nagitated to a vast depth, perhaps as much as five hundred feet. But this\r\nis probably connected with the current of the great gulf-stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    THE LAPIDARY’S BOARD; AND HIS WORKSHOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some of our provincial towns along the coast, the open door and\r\ncheerful bow-window of the lapidary, generally situated in the best\r\nstreet, form a _coup d’œil_ which can hardly fail of enticing a visitor\r\nto look in once during his morning walk.\r\n\r\nIf he should do this, he will probably become aware, by a certain\r\nwhirring sound, that there is an inner room which serves for a workshop.\r\nThis latter I have always been partial to: but as the contents of the\r\nshow-room are the most attractive, I will speak of them first, reserving\r\nto the end of the chapter a description of the lapidary’s wheel and other\r\nimplements of his trade.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that we are in the pretty town of Sidmouth in South Devon.\r\nSomebody wishes for a jet bead to replace one missing from a bracelet,\r\nand we sally forth in quest of a jeweller’s shop, but come first\r\nupon that of his cousin the lapidary, which may probably do as well.\r\nEntering the doorway, a gigantic “snakestone” from Whitby, flanks the\r\nthreshold on one side; and on the other a lump of iron ore, of some two\r\nhundred weight, keeps company with a quartz agate of equally cyclopean\r\ndimensions. These are striking objects: and instinctively we pause for a\r\nmoment and consider whence they came. One of them has been washed out of\r\nthe ribs of the conglomerate: another, after being dug from the bowels of\r\nthe earth, was sent aloft by the miners as lumber: the third, once the\r\nshell of a living ammonite, must have lain for thousands of years in its\r\ncemetery of limestone rock, and was only disinterred when some northern\r\ncontractor, reckless probably of fossil remains, but wide-awake to the\r\nactualities of his own generation, was excavating for a railway tunnel.\r\nInland productions these, for the most part. But the threshold is only\r\nintroductory: pass a few steps onward, and we shall handle substances\r\nwhich are as strictly marine as “crassicornis” or tangle.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the shop is fitted up with a massive semicircular dresser\r\nof elm or maple, some four feet in height, and perhaps half as many in\r\nwidth. This is heaped with specimens culled from various beaches, and\r\nseveral convenient shelves are similarly adorned; the polished stones\r\nlying in open trays, but set at an angle so as best to reflect the light.\r\nThe eyeless head of a Saurian, a creature belonging to an extinct race,\r\nis suspended from the ceiling; and a stuffed cormorant, a well-known\r\nsea-bird of our own day, mounted on a rude tripod of fir-bough, fills the\r\nonly spare niche in the apartment. But there is no study or affectation\r\nin all this: it is as genuine as the tent of shipwrecked Crusoe. The\r\nlapidary has from the first felt himself at home with Nature, and has\r\nfound room for many of her devices and eccentricities, which he could not\r\nnow bear to turn out of doors. Neither are we inclined to quarrel with\r\nhim about his arrangements, though his shop exhibits nothing which will\r\nremind us of a frontage in Pall Mall or Bond Street. Moreover, when we\r\nlook a little closer, he is not such a mere dreamer after all. Commerce\r\nhas not been forgotten, nor is a certain kind of elegance lacking. Those\r\nwell-washed panes of crown-glass are decorated with wisps of dried\r\nsea-weed more delicate than ostrich-feathers, and which serve the purpose\r\nof a hygrometer. And, interspersed with these, are sundry nuggets of\r\namber, bones of the cuttle-fish for your pounce-box, and a string of\r\nveritable jet-beads: from which latter we at once select our purchase.\r\n\r\nBut we are now standing before the central counter, and our attention is\r\ndrawn to the curious and beautiful fossils which lie upon it. We take up\r\none to which the late Dr. Mantell kindly gave the name of a “choanite.”\r\nIn doing this, he not only adopted a foundling, but conferred endless\r\nbenefit upon the lapidaries. Nothing will sell in this country without _a\r\nname_: the appellation chosen by the Doctor was judged suitable, and a\r\nlarge and increasing sale of the fossil has followed upon it. This one is\r\nof a portly size; and the lapidary, after slicing it in two, has polished\r\none of the flat surfaces. The internal structure revealed by this section\r\nis not unlike the corolla of a daisy, and at once reminds us of the\r\nliving zoophyte called “actinia bellis.” _Choanite_ means “funnel-body:”\r\nand the creature which lies here petrified must, when alive, have been\r\nglobular or pyriform, with many tubular arms branching out from one\r\ncentral trunk.\r\n\r\nThe petrifaction has been faithful to its prototype: the several tubes\r\nbeing now charged with limestone, and the space between them, once a\r\ngelatinous substance, still retaining that appearance in a medium of\r\nsemi-pellucid chalcedony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALCYONIUM DIGITATUM.]\r\n\r\nBy the side of the choanite is another fossil, which we now call an\r\n“alcyonite:” the learned name of the nearest living species being\r\n“alcyonium digitatum.” It is known in the Isle of Wight as “deadman’s\r\nfingers.” Despite the above unpleasing nickname, this is a most beautiful\r\nfossil. Its outer form resembles that of a branching ice-plant: while a\r\npolished section of one of the stems shows filaments all lying in the\r\ndirection of the axis, and exhibiting in their cut ends an effect not\r\nunlike that of the granulations in a slice from a fresh cucumber. When\r\nthe pith, as sometimes happens, is particoloured, I do not know a more\r\ndesirable stone for the cabinet.\r\n\r\nFine specimens of this are now very scarce.\r\n\r\nAnother of these alcyonites has been polished all round, instead of\r\ndividing it: and the pebble being translucent, one can almost count the\r\nfibres or tubes disposed lengthwise.\r\n\r\nThen we have a zoophyte, not _injected_ as are the choanites, but\r\npreserved bodily, in delicate gray flint. It is an undoubted “actinia:”\r\nin every respect the same with those pulpy individuals who are displaying\r\ntheir jelly-like bodies and floral hues in many a household aquarium.\r\nThis creature once floated up and down in shallow marine pools, or clung\r\nto banks of ribbon-weed fringing the coast-skerries. At present, himself\r\nof stone, he is firmly wedged in a hollow within a large pebble, and\r\nreminds us of the words of a pretty song:—\r\n\r\n    “I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls.”\r\n\r\nSeveral silicified sponges may next be examined. These are not exactly\r\nbeautiful, but they are curiously intricate; the once elastic tubes\r\nhaving stiffened into “silex” of a light brown colour, and a horizontal\r\nsection displaying their fine reticulations.\r\n\r\nA step further, and what is that handsome stone? It is a block of\r\nDevonian jasper: scarcely so hard as the Egyptian, but more attractive,\r\nowing to the richness of its hues. It is striated with veins of agate,\r\nand here and there “shot” with a dark metallic “moss” of the colour\r\nof bloodstone. As a set off to this, the lapidary has arranged with\r\ntrue taste some quaint pieces of conglomerate, in which the nodules\r\nof chalcedony or crystals of quartz have taken a high polish, and are\r\nagreeably relieved by streaks of red jasper and blotches of yellow\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the board exhibits a score of the well-known “echini,”\r\nwhich children call “sea-eggs.” These embrace two varieties, “spatangus”\r\nand “cor anguinum;” or, in the vernacular dialect, “fairy-loaves” and\r\n“fairy-hearts.” A third form of the Spatangus kind, but with a pointed\r\ncusp, is called “Galerites albogalerus.” A few are chalcedonized: in\r\nothers, a bright spar has filled up the interior of the hollow conical\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANANCHYTES OVATUS. FAIRY LOAF.\r\n\r\nCOR ANGUINUM. FAIRY HEART.\r\n\r\nGALERITES ALBOGALERUS. A FAIRY LOAF.\r\n\r\nAMMONITE.]\r\n\r\nA small open tray of twisted card contains several bits of carnelian,\r\nand a true bloodstone from the Yorkshire coast: while on a strip of\r\ncanvas as a _lit de repos_, lie a cray-fish and some belemnites from the\r\nGault formation of the Wight, hemmed round by lustrous sharks’ teeth:\r\nthe latter now hardened into stone, and proclaiming by their isolated\r\ncondition that the jaws in which they once grew were cartilaginous, and\r\nhave therefore perished.\r\n\r\nThus the store of the lapidary comprises two main divisions, stones\r\n_organic_ and _inorganic_, of the past history of the latter we know\r\nlittle; and can only judge by surmise, upon approved geological\r\nprinciples. In the former, there occur plain indications that we are\r\nnot handling either an accidental “lusus” or an embryo; but that the\r\nstructure here perpetuated was once endowed with life, and belonged to a\r\ncreature having its assigned place in the scale of animated being.\r\n\r\nLet any one fill a drawer with such specimens gathered by himself: and,\r\nomitting the question of mere marketable value, what jeweller’s counter\r\ncan compare with it for real interest? The oriental gems, though they\r\ngleam as if “all air and fire,” are but dead crystals, and have never\r\nstood higher than they stand now: whereas these pretty fossils from our\r\nwave-beaten coast tell each a wondrous tale, and form a kind of tangible\r\nlink between the zoophyte of to-day and his far-removed ancestry in the\r\nearliest seas which washed the surface of our globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CRAY-FISH, FROM THE GAULT.\r\n\r\nA SHARK’S TOOTH.]\r\n\r\nBut let us now look into the back-parlour, where all the cutting and\r\npolishing takes place. A peep behind the scenes is generally instructive.\r\n\r\nThe first time I ever entered such a “sanctum,” I remained there nearly\r\nan hour; _asking questions_, you may be sure.\r\n\r\nThe lapidary works by means of wheels. These wheels are instruments for\r\nsawing and filing the stones which come under his hand: he has nothing\r\nto add to them, but a good deal to take away from them. When any one\r\ndivides an orange with a sharp knife _equatorially_, he treats it as a\r\nchoanite is treated in the simplest case: but the principle is somewhat\r\ndifferent. The knife may cut the first as smooth as cheese, owing to the\r\nsuperior hardness of the steel and the compressibility of the fruit: but\r\nno instrument that man can invent will ever do this with a substance like\r\nflint or jasper. All that the wheel can do is to act like a saw, and\r\nto take out from the centre of the pebble, in the shape of saw-dust, a\r\nsection equal in thickness to the wheel itself. If this be effected, and\r\nno more, then that part of the work is perfectly done: and this is not\r\neffected, without some fault, once in a dozen times, unless the workman\r\nbe both skilful and attentive. The usual fault is, that the plane of\r\nsection is not kept perfectly horizontal.\r\n\r\nBut let us now see how the wheels act. There must always be two of\r\nthem: one which is to cut by its edge, and another which is to polish\r\nby its surface. But the lapidary is generally provided with several of\r\nboth kinds; partly in case of accident, partly on account of variety in\r\nthe texture of the pebbles brought to him. Each wheel is fixed upon an\r\naxis of its own, of perhaps a cubit’s length. And this portable axis is\r\nbevelled as a screw, for some inches, at the other end, so that it can\r\nbe screwed at pleasure into a solid revolving spindle planted upright in\r\nthe floor of the workshop. The spindle itself may either be worked by a\r\nleathern strap and a treddle; or, as is more usual, by a winch-handle\r\nacting at a mechanical advantage.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal wheel being made to spin round by turning the winch with\r\none hand, the workman grasps the pebble firmly in the other, and presses\r\nit against the edge of the disk, which revolving in a horizontal plane\r\nacts like a saw. A pencil-line may first be drawn on the stone, to mark\r\nout the intended section.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. A _dry_ wheel, although it were formed of the finest\r\nsteel, could barely scratch the surface of an agate: or, if great force\r\nwere exerted at the winch, would splinter it. The lapidary has need of\r\ndiamond-powder, emery, and rotten-stone. He makes use also of a peculiar\r\nkind of oil, and has a jar of water within reach for ordinary purposes.\r\nThe oil is called “brick-oil.” It comes from coal-tar, and does not\r\nheat by friction, as common oil would: consequently, it neither burns\r\nthe operator’s fingers, nor injures his specimens by causing the wheel\r\nto glow too fiercely. Of the above materials, the most expensive is the\r\ndiamond. Although obtained by crushing “bort,” of little intrinsic value,\r\nit never costs the lapidary less than twenty-five shillings per _carat_;\r\nand he can do nothing without it. Emery, on the other hand, which is a\r\ncoarse variety of corundum, is cheap enough.\r\n\r\nThe first wheel put on the spindle is an extremely thin one, it can\r\nscarcely be too thin, and is made of tin or of the _softest_ steel. Its\r\ndisk should lie exactly level in the plane of the horizon, and it must\r\nnot have the shadow of a notch or bend upon its delicate edge. This wheel\r\nthe lapidary wets, along its entire rim, with oil or water, by means\r\nof a feather. A small portion of the diamond, ready mixed with oil, is\r\nthen applied to the edge of the wheel, the latter being made to revolve\r\ngently, until it has taken up the mixture from his finger.\r\n\r\nThe wheel thus primed is now set in motion, at first slowly, but by\r\ndegrees more rapidly, and the pebble being steadily pressed, not\r\n_pushed_, against it, the diamond eats into the metal, and the metallic\r\nedge armed with an adamantine tooth eats into the solid stone, and at\r\nlength saws it asunder.\r\n\r\nIn this way an agate of a couple of inches diameter, and of average\r\nhardness, will be neatly divided in less than a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nThe two surfaces thus obtained are then inspected, and if the stone be\r\njudged worthy, the lapidary proceeds to _polish_ either or both of them.\r\nThere is always some difference between the two, a slice having been\r\ntaken out of the pebble answering to the thickness of the wheel; hence\r\nthe importance of using a delicate disk, especially for valuable agates.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the polishing, the thin wheel of steel is now exchanged for\r\na much thicker one of lead, which takes its place upon the spindle. It\r\nis no longer the edge, but the ribbed upper surface which is now to do\r\nthe work; and to charge it for this, it is smeared over with rotten-stone\r\ndipped in water. This heavy wheel is then set spinning at a rapid rate,\r\nand the pebble is pressed flat upon it with great force; the heavier the\r\nhand the better. As it slidders about, the action of the rotten-stone,\r\nwhich is very fine in the grain, gives it by degrees a high polish. And\r\nthis polish is durable, and will preserve the agate from the corroding\r\neffect of our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nLess than the above will not dress a pebble for the cabinet.\r\nOccasionally, much more is needed. For a very fine jasper I have seen two\r\nor three polishing wheels employed, the last disk being always loaded\r\nwith soft rotten-stone.\r\n\r\nAs to the expense, it will cost from sixpence to ninepence to cut a small\r\npebble through; and to polish one surface, perhaps as much more. This is\r\nsupposing that you take your specimens direct to a working lapidary. If,\r\ninstead of doing so, you leave them at a jeweller’s shop with directions\r\n_to get them done_, you may expect to be charged fully twice as much.\r\nNor is this so unreasonable as it sounds; for the man so deputed acts\r\nas your servant and will look to be paid for his trouble: he must have\r\nrecourse to the lapidary, and you might at once have done so yourself.\r\n\r\nTo dress a large pebble, especially if a difficult stone in the grain,\r\nis a more costly affair. It demands many consecutive hours of labour and\r\nunremitting attention, and involves a perceptible outlay in diamond.\r\nMoreover, the weight of such a stone causes, by its _vis inertiæ_, a\r\nsevere strain on the machinery, which then fares like an engine drawing\r\na monster-train up the inclined plane. This wear and tear of the wheels\r\nis so serious a consideration in provincial towns, where the supply of\r\n“plant” is limited, that few lapidaries out of London will undertake, for\r\nany reasonable sum, to dress the agates and close-grained jaspers when\r\nthey run large.\r\n\r\nOne of my jaspers, a Devonshire beauty, took eight hours of cutting and\r\npolishing in Clerkenwell; and even this was a trifle compared to some\r\nof which I have heard tell. Certain substances again are intrinsically\r\nteasing to the wheel. There is a class of jaspery flints which have a\r\ndodge or twist in their texture; the lapidary abhors these visitors, and\r\nwill not meddle with them, if he knows it, without bargaining for extra\r\npay.\r\n\r\nI have a great pleasure in seeing fine pebbles of my own polished. You\r\ncan stop the wheel every now and then, and watch how the stone gets\r\non. When the chiaroscuro begins to come out on the coloured pattern,\r\nthe effect is like that produced by holding some lively object before\r\na mirror. The surface no longer appears flat; but you obtain aërial\r\nperspective, as in a good painting.\r\n\r\nIt were vain to deny that the lapidary’s acquaintance might in time\r\nprove an expensive amusement; for pebble-hunting is a hobby, and like\r\nall hobbies is liable to be over-ridden. But experience begets caution.\r\nFor a score of stones which a tyro will leave on the board to be cut, a\r\nconnoisseur will not venture above two or three.\r\n\r\nBeginners, however, always run some risk, being naturally enthusiastic;\r\nand the best way for them is to lay down a few sound rules, and to adhere\r\nto these strictly. One good maxim is, to pay for all work upon the spot.\r\nEven an enthusiast will soon grow weary of parting with ready money for\r\nmere trash.\r\n\r\nSome persons set up a wheel, &c., of their own, and operate upon their\r\ntreasure at home. I do not recommend this course to any one, unless\r\nhe were the son of a lapidary, as Achilles was “son of Peleus,” and\r\nintend to devote himself to the occupation. For most amateurs it will\r\nbe found difficult. It is five to one that a young hand signalizes his\r\napprenticeship by spoiling his best agates, cutting his fingers, and\r\ndamaging his machinery. The only advantage, as far as I know, which such\r\na plan may possess, is that you might try some curious experiments in\r\nworking at odd pebbles.\r\n\r\nA lapidary’s implements, if complete as they ought to be, will cost\r\nhim from seven to ten pounds. About five pounds’ worth of diamond is a\r\nvery good commencing stock. Five pounds more will fit up his shop with\r\na counter and drawers to lock, and his work-room with a table, stool,\r\nhammers, a few cloths, and a good lens. This is all that he requires,\r\nbesides knowledge and patience.\r\n\r\nSuppose the entire outlay should amount to twenty pounds; in a good\r\nwatering-place, on the south coast of England, he ought to make from\r\na hundred to a hundred and fifty pounds a year, without doing any\r\nnight-work. But by day he must not spare hands nor eyes: and he cannot\r\nafford to make any serious mistakes with his customers. If he cuts a\r\nfine choanite the wrong way, or mutilates a rare alcyonite, or robs a\r\npromising “landscape-pebble” of its pellucid sky, it is well-nigh over\r\nwith his professional reputation; and that once gone, he will get little\r\ncustom of value. When I was last in Ventnor, the sea had thrown up some\r\nsingularly fine pebbles for several successive tides. Three working\r\nlapidaries rented houses in the town; but all the more valuable orders\r\nwent to one of them. This man knew admirably well how to handle almost\r\nany stone which was brought to him; while his two brethren in the craft,\r\nthough both of them hard-working men, were comparatively ignorant. They\r\nwere like quack-doctors, and he was a learned professor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    THE CONTENTS OF A GOOD BEACH, AND HOW TO OBTAIN THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always been fond of trying conclusions with Nature at first hand.\r\nWhen a boy at school, I learnt to swim by following some bigger boys, who\r\ncould swim already, into water which was quite out of all our depths.\r\n\r\nI had never till then tried, except in shallow places, which, whatever\r\npeople may think, afford no criterion of how it will fare with you in a\r\ndrowning current. On this occasion we swam about fifty yards, in ten-foot\r\nwater, not without trepidation at first on my part, but towards the end\r\nI gained breath and confidence. After that, I never had any difficulty,\r\nwhether in lakes or rivers, and I have ventured into scores of them at\r\nall seasons, and that without the slightest previous notice of their\r\ndepth or temperature.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, I am convinced that to master anything, whether bodily\r\nor intellectual, the all-important point is to make a genuine effort of\r\nour own. Books may do something for us; teachers, if we can afford them,\r\nsomething more; but we must do the main part ourselves.\r\n\r\nI am reminded of the above in proposing to describe a good beach. A\r\nlapidary once said to me, “Sir, you know this bit of the coast as well\r\nas I do myself.” It was a high compliment, but it was not unmerited. The\r\ntruth is, I possess “memoranda,” jotted down from time to time, of divers\r\nbeaches and their usual contents, and I find that, omitting all mention\r\nof bare reefs in shale and sandstone, or long reaches of sand, which are\r\nof continual occurrence, there remain some forty odd miles of shingle\r\nlying in three different parts of the English coast, with the character\r\nof which I am thoroughly well acquainted.\r\n\r\nSome of these beaches are very superior to others, and I select such for\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nAmid countless boulders of flint, and heaps of hardened gravel, we have\r\nupon a good beach certain smooth, translucent pebbles, and we have fossil\r\npetrifactions enveloped in an opaque crust, and we have the variegated\r\njaspers and moss-agates.\r\n\r\nOur semi-pellucid stones were, with the exception of an occasional bit\r\nof “bloodstone,” the only pebbles of native growth known in Britain half\r\na century ago. They consist of two or three varieties of agate, two of\r\ncarnelian, and one of the crystal called an aquamarine. The presence of\r\nthis latter on the coast is a mere accident, as it is for the most part a\r\nfar-inland production, the growth of granitic rocks.\r\n\r\nAgates and carnelians were once of frequent occurrence, but they have now\r\nbecome scarce. Their brilliancy insures their being instantly seen, when\r\nnot buried under the loose shingle.\r\n\r\nAGATE, with us, is always found smooth, and some of the best specimens\r\nare indented on the sides, as if they had been subjected to a pinch\r\nor pressure while in a soft state. As this substance is not met with\r\nunder the spiked form of a crystal, we may suppose that it never was\r\ncrystallized.\r\n\r\nIt is not laminar, like the diamond, nor coated, like a pearl, but one\r\nsimple concretion. It contains some alumina, but more silica, and is\r\nprobably one form of the onyx-stone. It is seldom very bright, being\r\nmore or less debased with earthy particles, but it is a pretty thing\r\nto pick up, and it takes a high polish on the wheel of the lapidary. I\r\nbelieve it is harder than jasper, but perhaps scarcely so _tough_.\r\n\r\nIn England, we find the agates greenish white, lemon colour, or dark\r\ngrey; and on the island of Iona, hard by the ruined monastery, they are\r\npicked up of a soft green hue, and as clear as a chrysolite. The best\r\nlump of agate I ever saw came from an unfrequented bay in the Isle of\r\nWight; the colours were dullish, but in texture it approached an oriental\r\nonyx, and it weighed above a pound. I know of no equal specimen in the\r\ncollection of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nCARNELIAN, which is our purest form of chalcedony, is undoubtedly a more\r\nbeautiful stone than the agate. This is either milk-white or of a deep\r\nred. The latter tint is becoming scarce in Britain, having been much\r\nsought out for the manufacture of seals and ring-stones, but now that\r\n“sards” are so much in vogue, the real carnelian may get a respite and\r\nappear in force again, as salmon have sometimes been known to do in their\r\nnative streams after falling off for many years.\r\n\r\nThe “sard” may be considered as the carnelian of the desert, or the\r\n“carnelian” as the sard of the seashore. Sards are plentiful in the east.\r\nTravellers, whose path lies over the waste plains and sandy reaches of\r\nEgypt or Lybia, should pick up any darkly-tinted pebble they may descry\r\non the surface of the ground: it is probably a sard, perchance a valuable\r\nspecimen. One day, in homely Brighton, stepping into a lapidary’s, I\r\nfound upon his counter half-a-dozen unusual-looking stones already\r\ncut in two, and some of them polished. “These are not English,” said\r\nI, “where did you get them?” He told me, in reply, that a gentleman\r\njust arrived from Egypt had taken these stones out of the mouth of his\r\ncarpet-bag and left them with him to be dressed. I examined them closely.\r\nAs I had expected, on learning the locality, one was a blood-red sard,\r\nand two others were jaspers; a fourth was curiously mottled and ribbed\r\nwith chalcedony. They had been obtained without any expense, and at no\r\ntrouble beyond that of stooping to pick them up, and all four were very\r\n_saleable_ articles in the trade.\r\n\r\nThe finest red carnelians are brought from the East, but they occur also\r\nin Silesia, and splendid specimens of a dark hue have been obtained from\r\nthe sands of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, on the beach of St. Andrew’s, I found a pretty variety,\r\n“eyed,” but it is scarce. I have since seen similar stones, which had\r\nbeen picked up at Cromer or at Aldborough.\r\n\r\nThe AQUAMARINE is sometimes met with on the sea-shore at Aberystwith in\r\nNorth Wales, and more rarely on our eastern coast. Of course it is a\r\ncrystal, which has come down from the inland rocks, and has afterwards\r\nbeen rolled smooth by the action of the waves among other pebbles.\r\n\r\nThe base of all our English crystals is _Silica_, with an admixture\r\nof lime. Rock-crystal is the purest form of Silica. Common spar is a\r\ncarbonate of lime. The black or grey flints, which are shed in myriads\r\nfrom many a chalk-cliff, are “Silex” much debased; some dark, viscous\r\nmatter, such as bitumen, having united, I think _chemically_, with the\r\nclearer substance. Quartz are the small crystals of silica; a mass of\r\nthese will vary in its configuration.\r\n\r\nCairngorum stones are rock-crystals from the mountain of that name,\r\ndeeply impregnated with iron and aluminium. The claret-coloured ones,\r\nfound on Ben M’Dhui, are our nearest approach to an amethyst, and some\r\ndeep-red specimens remind us of the garnet.\r\n\r\nAs I propose here to speak only of our sea-shore pebbles, I shall not\r\ndwell upon the Scotch crystals, which are, moreover, familiar to almost\r\neverybody in the ornaments of tartan dresses. Neither shall I touch upon\r\nthe fluor spars of Derbyshire, or the magnificent crystals found in the\r\nmines of Cornwall and Cumberland.\r\n\r\nAll these belong to crystallography, and I am persuaded that, in our\r\nproductions of the seaside, a crystallizing process has been the\r\nexception and not the rule. I will only add to what is said above, that,\r\nas far as I know, amidst the great range of tints comprised in the\r\ndifferent crystals from Scotland and from Ireland, there is no instance\r\nof the _peach-colour_ or delicate pink, such as are picked up on some of\r\nthe “moraines” on the Alps of Savoy.\r\n\r\nSecondly, such parts of our coast as are hemmed in by cretaceous\r\nor sandstone cliffs abound in fossil pebbles. The organisms which\r\nthese inclose are, almost universally, those of zoophytes. Dendritic\r\nor vegetable markings are rare, occurring principally in the white\r\nchalcedony. A good pebble of this kind used to be called a mocha-stone;\r\nthe difficulty always was how to be quite sure where it came from. Those\r\nfrom the Indies would generally be handsomer; while, on the other hand,\r\nan equally fine specimen from our own shores would be of treble value.\r\n\r\nBut the petrifactions described in Chapter II. may be readily obtained\r\nthroughout the entire range of coast from Hastings to Selsea Bill, and\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nIn gathering these pebbles, if you intend them for the cabinet, and not\r\nmerely to amuse a passing hour, regard should be had to three points;\r\nthe size, the pattern, and the colour. The last-mentioned, which is,\r\nnine times out of ten, the cause of average specimens being seen at all,\r\nwill itself be determined by the material of which the pebble consists.\r\nChalcedony has a bluish cast in the solid stone, especially when it is\r\nwet with brine; but where “moss” is present, this will cause a golden\r\nor red tint. Jasper, when semi-transparent, is greenish, otherwise, a\r\nblood-red.\r\n\r\nAs to size, choanites and the globular “sponges” will vary from that of\r\na small pippin to that of a full-sized orange. Very rarely they exceed\r\nthis. If the pebble be of the right sort, the larger the better: but, as\r\na general rule, the finer ones run small.\r\n\r\nThe pattern is the most important feature; as you will soon recognize in\r\nmaking a collection. And this, moreover, if no injury has yet been done\r\nto the stone, decides the “contour” of the rolling beauty.\r\n\r\nI shall not, however, say much about these patterns; not wishing to be\r\ncharged with exaggeration, as I probably should be, by those who have\r\nnever seen good ones, and who do not conceive of the endless varieties\r\ninto which four or five colours can thus be wrought in the stony loom of\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nAmateurs must learn for themselves what these really are, and how to\r\njudge of them scientifically, when they pick up a fossil weighing,\r\nperhaps, a pound avoirdupois, and looking like a champion-potato. One\r\nor two hints may be ventured. If the creature was an “alcyonite,” its\r\n_facsimile_ in stone should have the external rings or mouths clearly\r\ndefined, and, if possible, equi-distant. Such a one, when cut, will\r\nexhibit its tubes evenly disposed—not unlike a section of fir-wood under\r\nthe microscope. If it was an “actinia,” then the body of the zoophyte\r\nshould be central in the pebble, and the tentacles will be not much\r\nmelted away in a good slice.\r\n\r\n“Sponges” must be chosen principally for their colour; in other words,\r\nfor the _texture_ of the stone. Those which exhibit the reticulations,\r\nwhite or straw-colour, upon a very dark ground, are the most effective\r\ngenerally: but the most perfect one I ever saw had a blood-red pattern\r\nupon white. For a single _slice_ from this stone, half a guinea was\r\noffered by me, and refused.\r\n\r\n“Choanites” are easily discerned.\r\n\r\nThe “ventriculite” must have been a creature lower down in that scale\r\nthan the choanite. This fossil is repeatedly met with on our coast, but I\r\ndo not admire it enough to have retained a single specimen. When alive,\r\nit would appear to have resembled, in stature and configuration, an\r\nordinary toadstool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENTRICULITE.\r\n\r\nCHOANITE.]\r\n\r\nThe choanite was, undoubtedly, a beautiful creature, and, as ten thousand\r\nof the family testify, abundant. Dr. Mantell said that its form, when\r\ncomplete, was that of a pear or fig, and I think he obtained such a\r\nfossil from the Lewes chalk, where it was growing upright on a stalk, in\r\nthe way in which he afterwards depicted it. Looking over my collection, I\r\nsee that I have a similar one, in black chalcedony-flint, which I picked\r\nup at Shanklin; only, in my specimen, which came from the beach, the\r\ndelicate stem is, of course, gone.\r\n\r\nThe complete pyriform mound is rare, for obvious reasons. I never saw but\r\nthree instances of it; the above, of my own finding, was one. Another was\r\nin pellucid white agate, spotted all over with the ends of the feelers.\r\nThe third, which I also picked up, had been pounded on a rough beach, and\r\ncrumbled in my hand.\r\n\r\nChoanites and ventriculites, as animals, are supposed to be extinct.\r\nPerhaps they are so, though I do not see how any one can take upon him to\r\npronounce as to what living organisms the great Southern Ocean may or may\r\nnot contain.\r\n\r\nThe creature, however, which I admire most, as perpetuated in these\r\nmarine fossils, is not a choanite, but an actinia of the “crass” kind.\r\nOne of these, large and of a globular form, in which the tubular\r\ntentacles are distinctly shown, and the colour is yellow in the agate,\r\nI found, in a sequestered spot, where the deep sand must have received\r\nand sheltered it shortly after it had dropped from the cliff. The outer\r\nwhitey-brown crust was unbroken: and as this crust is the cuticle of\r\nthe pebble, and which always wears away first, I have no doubt of the\r\nspecimen being a perfect one. It could never have undergone a rub, beyond\r\nthat from soft sand or softer seaweed.\r\n\r\nLastly, striped jaspers and bloodstones are to be had for the seeking,\r\non our Devonshire and Yorkshire coasts. The bloodstone is too well known\r\nto need any description; neither is there much variety or interest in\r\na rush-green, spotted with red. But the jaspers embrace several other\r\ncolours, and many lively patterns. South Devon has good ones, resembling\r\nagatized wood. Scarborough has good ones, some of them quite equal\r\nto the “weed-agate” of India. At Eastbourne, a dark-brown variety is\r\noccasionally found, which is highly prized, because it approaches the\r\ncharacter of the Egyptian. Fine pebbles of this kind are also to be\r\nobtained in the neighbourhood of St. Alban’s, in Hertfordshire, but they\r\nare liable to be gritty.\r\n\r\nBeside the above, which are true jaspers, scores of jasper-flints in\r\nbright red, yellow, or green, occur on almost any beach. These are simply\r\nburnt flints, containing a portion of oxide of iron. Their present\r\ncondition is probably the result of extinct volcanic agency. These\r\nare not nearly so hard as the true jaspers, and their _fracture_ is\r\n“conchoidal.”\r\n\r\nFor pleasing the eye, perhaps the choicest stone in Britain is a\r\nmoss-agate, of which the pretty name yields an accurate description.\r\nThe “moss” is some oxidized metal, whose ramifications form a striking\r\ncontrast with the limpid chalcedony in which it seems to float like\r\nseaweed or sponge.\r\n\r\nWhen a fine specimen of one of these stones has been cleverly cut,\r\nit is not unusual to obtain in its section the principal features\r\nof a mimic landscape—the clear sky, and the fuscous earth. Some, in\r\naddition, display a setting sun, &c. Such stones get the name of\r\n“landscape-pebbles.”\r\n\r\nOn the shores of Loch Tay, in Perthshire, remarkable ones are found—in\r\nwhich the imaginative Highlander fancies he can trace the features of\r\nhis beloved mountain-scenery. Great store is set by these, on account\r\nof their pattern; but they are mostly in sepia, and white, being never\r\nsuffused with warm colours, as are our marine specimens.\r\n\r\nI may note here, finally, that to a true connoisseur, the prettiest\r\nmoss-agates are not so welcome as those which exhibit a bold and haggard\r\nstyle. Some of the French pebbles, from the neighbourhood of Dieppe,\r\nwould be very fine indeed, only that they are spoiled by an undue\r\nquantity of black “moss,” as black as mud.\r\n\r\nMost of the above-named treasures may be obtained by any one who owns\r\na fair amount of perseverance, provided he or she have an eye for\r\npebbles. And nobody need be discouraged from the search, who likes them\r\nwell enough to be willing to take a good deal of trouble to find them.\r\nOne-half of what are counted difficulties in this life have their root\r\nand growth in our constitutional laziness, and may be overcome by a\r\nlittle energy. We have all of us an eye for ripe cherries and red roses,\r\nwhy not for pebbles?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet me now state in a few brief paragraphs the merits of the case. People\r\nsay there is luck in all things. It may be so, once or twice; I never\r\nknew it hold for a continuance. A course of practical experience in\r\nalmost any department of life will bring a sure quietus to such crude\r\nfancies.\r\n\r\nThe searcher after pebbles must look to more sterling qualifications. He\r\nshould have good legs, good eyes, good judgment, and—I may as well say it\r\nat once—a good temper. He should choose a likely part of an unfrequented\r\nbeach: and should go down at the right hour, somewhere about half-tide,\r\nwhen the tide _is running out_.\r\n\r\nIt is as well for him to walk with the sun a little behind him, and on\r\none side; and I would recommend him, if possible, to avoid entertaining a\r\nnorth-easter in his teeth.\r\n\r\nThen he should be suitably rigged for the expedition. If he has ever\r\nfished salmon, he will need no wrinkles here: but in case not, I may\r\nspecify the following. Strong ancle-boots, with double soles and on real\r\nhob-nails, and a stout woollen sock within; rough trowsers, which he will\r\nnot grudge damping in the brine; and a coat of fustian or tweed, with\r\nample pockets. When the season is wintry, add to these a warm wrapper\r\nfor the neck; and, in one of his pockets, a Cording’s india-rubber cape\r\nwith sleeves. A water-proof cap, with a curtain to it. No umbrella, no\r\nstick; but a light geologist’s hammer; and a canvas-bag, worked with open\r\nmeshes, for the heavier specimens, which otherwise he would have to carry\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nIf he is going far, and it is as well to count upon eight or ten miles\r\nfrom home, let him carry a flask of any liquid he likes best to imbibe;\r\ntogether with a hunch of bread and cheese. [N.B. This will be found more\r\nsustaining than a meat-sandwich.] Lastly, a few mild cigars, not omitting\r\nthe usual implements for striking a light _sub dio_. The fragrant weed\r\nis always a cheerful companion, and doubly welcome when your path lacks\r\nflowers: moreover, it has historical associations, which cabbages have\r\nnot, and will bring to mind Sir Walter Raleigh, who was a great man.\r\n\r\nThe above rules concerning the toilet will hold good for the fair sex,\r\n_mutatis mutandis_. Only in addition, ladies should engage some stalwart\r\narm to lean upon; and should on no account venture themselves among\r\nslippery rocks. As for those knights and esquires who accompany the\r\ngentle dames on such a quest, they must look to themselves. I cannot now\r\nstop to warn them of their peculiar peril; but they know what I mean.\r\nIt was among the Ocean-isles that Briseis led captive the stern son of\r\nPeleus.\r\n\r\nAbove all, let the Pebble-searcher have nothing on his mind when he sets\r\nforth: no broken engagements, no crying debts. Otherwise, he may look in\r\nvain for moss-agates. Shakspeare, when he has to account for a valiant\r\nwarrior and politic general, a crowned king to boot, losing the great\r\nbattle of Bosworth-field, ascribes it all to the ghosts who sat heavy on\r\nhis soul. Any neglected or injured creature may prove on such occasions a\r\nvengeful ghost.\r\n\r\nSupposing your hours free, the best are those in which the daylight is\r\nmost powerful: say, from ten in the morning until four in the afternoon;\r\nor, to take things in moderation, from eleven to three. A beaching\r\nexpedition made thus with determinate purpose, once or twice in the\r\ncourse of six days, I hold to be reasonable diversion; and for matter\r\nof interest, I know of no out-door pursuit which excels it, not even\r\nInsect-catching, or Fly-fishing.\r\n\r\nThe above hints being attended to, one important point remains still to\r\nbe considered. It is absolutely necessary to understand pebbles in the\r\nrough.\r\n\r\nThe more peculiar a beach is in its contents, the less will it exhibit\r\nto catch the eyes of one who has never learnt to appreciate them.\r\nColoured seaweeds are enticingly bright; pearly shells are as evident as\r\ntrinkets; but the external coat of a genuine pebble differs widely from\r\nits internal structure, and may yield to the uninitiated no indication\r\nwhatever of the value of the latter. A crust of hardened lime or\r\nsandstone is a frequent envelope of the best specimens in one kind of\r\nzoophyte. The stone itself is very likely mis-shapen, and perhaps lies\r\nmore than half buried in sand or shingle. Without knowing anything of the\r\nnature of these fossils, you may occasionally pick up such “darkies” at a\r\nventure; but you will never feel assured of them, you will never be able\r\nto glean them from the multitudinous gravel, as the determined Fly-fisher\r\ngets the best trout out of a pool, if you have not the pleasure of an\r\nintimate acquaintance with their species. The readiest way of acquiring\r\nthis, and it is not born with anybody, is to spend a wakeful half-hour,\r\nonce and again, at the board of any civil lapidary, and there thoroughly\r\nto inspect his casual store. A trifling purchase will abundantly content\r\nhim in return, the more as he hopes to cut several pebbles for you.\r\n\r\nObserve, then the peculiar way in which the outer crust of an old pebble\r\nis worn, as compared with that of one which has newly descended upon the\r\nbeach. This crust or cuticle is highly suggestive, if you can once come\r\nto understand it; and as a hopeful indication of progress, you may safely\r\nassume that you _do_ understand it, when you find that you can obtain\r\npebbles such as nine persons out of ten somehow never “have the luck” to\r\nmeet with. Sometimes a stone has parted with its original coating, and\r\nhas donned another: and this operation may either be complete, or still\r\n_in fieri_. In the latter case, there will always be some token; either\r\nby the substance not lying evenly, or by a change in the colour of the\r\nsecond envelope, which becomes apparent on chipping off a fragment from\r\nits surface.\r\n\r\nLose no opportunity of perfecting your judgment upon any form or texture\r\nthat comes in your way: for upon this will really depend what sort of\r\ncollection you shall win from the bosom of the coy beach. Nothing is\r\neasier, on an average coast, than to pick up a score of showy-looking\r\nbut inferior stones. Few things will be found more difficult than to\r\nbring home, as the fruit of your morning’s walk, two or three valuable\r\nspecimens. And the cause of this lies not at all in luck, nor altogether\r\nin mere labour; for in all departments there are dunces who will still\r\ndrudge hard. It lies in the presence or absence of sound information on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nA good rule is, even early in your apprenticeship, to eschew trumpery.\r\nBut beware of hasty conclusions. Some collectors will take nothing away\r\nwith them from the beach which they do not feel quite sure about. This is\r\nshallow practice, for it assumes an amount of discernment which nobody\r\npossesses. I can see as far into a stone wall in this sense as most\r\npeople; but I rather like to carry off occasionally an odd-looking stone\r\nwhich, like Bassanio’s happy casket, “rather threatens than doth promise\r\naught.” Such a pebble may turn out a prize. The things which every one\r\nshould reject without hesitation are those whose character is evident,\r\nand with it their little worth.\r\n\r\nMediocrity in pebbles is insufferable. Do not assume that the\r\n_wet_ portion of a beach necessarily yields the best chances. Many\r\npebble-hunters never get over this early delusion. On a coast which\r\nis rarely trodden, the upper range contains the richest store. And in\r\nevery case, the tide runs twice in the twenty-four hours over banks\r\nwhich now look dry and dusty, as well as over that narrow strip which\r\nyou see glistening with saline moisture. And while you cannot fail to\r\nremark a pellucid stone or fossil which is sprinkled by the wave, if\r\nyour attention is caught by anything lying high and dry, the latter is\r\nprobably worth stooping for.\r\n\r\nWalk rapidly over a poor, unproductive beach; but take your time and make\r\ngood use of your eyes when you find you are in the land of plenty.\r\n\r\nIf you carry a hammer with you, let it be of the right sort; a\r\nwell-tempered metal, not too large to stow away in a hind-pocket, and\r\n_not armed with a spike_. When you have such a one, it is tolerably safe\r\nto strike even a heavy blow on a large pebble in your other hand; but if\r\nyou do the same by a small one, you may chance to maim your left palm for\r\nlife: because in this case there is little reaction, and the blow you\r\ndeal will _drive_ the stone. But even with large pebbles, the preferable\r\nmethod is to plant one foot firmly on the stone, leaving a portion\r\nexposed to your aim. If your boots are of a sensible thickness, nothing\r\nwill come to grief.\r\n\r\nNever dash pebbles down upon others in order to break them open. In\r\nthe first place, you risk a wound in your face from the rebound of a\r\nfragment in what mathematicians term the “angle of reflexion,” an angle\r\nwhich you have probably not calculated; but besides this, you may by\r\nsuch imprudence destroy a valuable specimen. You can open plenty of\r\nfossil flints and waterworn jaspers in the manner I have recommended\r\nabove; which knocks off a corner, and shows you the true nature of the\r\nformations you are walking upon. I have learned a good deal in this way.\r\n\r\nLastly, when you are landed upon a superior beach, with the promise of a\r\nfew hours of open weather, use the golden opportunity and do your best.\r\n\r\nSolomon was quite right when he said, “Whatever thy hand findeth to\r\ndo, do it with thy might.” It is evident that if you do not _in foro\r\nconscientiæ_ think such a hobby worth the while, you ought not to meddle\r\nwith it. I quite agree that making shoes is more profitable, provided\r\nalways that you have custom; although I have known more than one instance\r\nof working craftsmen who at intervals picked up some very good pebbles\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nThe above rules may sound marvellously simple. I only wish that a few as\r\nsimple were generally acted upon. We might then hope to see some noble\r\ncollections of really instructive pebbles from our as yet little known\r\nsea-coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    WHICH BE THE BEST BEACHES IN ENGLAND.—CONCERNING STATIONARY AND\r\n    MOVABLE SHINGLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe variety exhibited by Nature seems to be almost infinite, take what\r\nground we will for observation and comparison. This has been frequently\r\nnoted in both the animal and vegetable departments of Creation. I believe\r\nit to be no less true of the mineral, especially when we embrace under\r\nthat head fossil remains.\r\n\r\nIf there be any feature in British scenery which to a cursory observer\r\nappears uniform and identical everywhere, it is the yellow-looking beach\r\nalong the coast line. Yet it will be found on trial that our beaches\r\ndiffer widely from each other. No two are quite alike. Devonshire is not\r\nmore diverse from Yorkshire, or Norfolk from the Isle of Wight, than are\r\ntheir respective beaches, as to what these contain.\r\n\r\nNay more: on the range of the Sussex coast—a very monotonous range—I am\r\nacquainted, at this present time of writing, with four beaches, which I\r\ndo not scruple to pronounce totally different one from another. If I were\r\nshown the pebbles, I could generally tell from which quarter they came.\r\nBut to become aware of variety, you must observe certain admitted facts.\r\nThe frequenters of our coast-scenery, not one-tenth part of whom can\r\nplead the sad excuse of being invalids, usually know but little of the\r\ncharacter of a beautiful beach lying in their intermediate neighbourhood.\r\nOrdinarily speaking, a man will be better informed concerning the plains\r\nof the Pampas, or the windings of the Coppermine River, than he is upon\r\nthe nature of the soil which is under his feet, or of the bough which\r\nhangs over his head in the forest. And the reason of this is obvious; we\r\nneglect the reality for the sake of the appearance. We greedily devour\r\ncertain stereotyped works as a kind of royal road to knowledge; but we\r\nomit to notice and inquire into the sensible objects which are strewn\r\nalong our daily path.\r\n\r\nOf course, we pay the penalty in kind. Two-thirds of our “book-knowledge”\r\nis merely conceited ignorance; not the genuine gold, fit for current\r\ncoin, but a baser metal washed over, which will stand no one in stead\r\nfor long.\r\n\r\nI will now describe accurately three beaches which occur in three\r\ndifferent counties. Any one who makes their acquaintance hereafter,\r\nespecially if in quest of pebbles, will, I believe, recognize the\r\noriginal of each sketch. One of them now lies far away; but to think of\r\nthem is like dwelling on the still vivid impressions of a dream.\r\n\r\nI am in a district of the New Red Sandstone, and as far as my eye can\r\nreach I see towering cliffs of a kindred formation, wheeling round or\r\njutting out in foxy-coloured masses, while the innumerable points of\r\nshingle glow like an autumn stubble at their feet. I commence searching\r\nnear the bright water-line, and what with the simple grandeur of the\r\nscene, and what with the balmy breath of the south, I insensibly stray\r\nonward for several miles, until the increasing weight in my pockets\r\nsuggests a pause. Now I will sit down under the shadow of that mid-way\r\nrock, light a cigar, and inspect my treasures.\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done. What a calming sensation a whiff of good\r\ntobacco induces on these burning days! But what have I got? Above thirty\r\nglobes of chalcedony, blue and white, as oval as bantams’ eggs. I select\r\nhalf a dozen on account of some beauty or peculiarity, and fling the\r\nremainder into the sea, there to undergo a fresh impregnation. Next,\r\nsundry bits of the red and white conglomerate. Let me advise everybody\r\nwho has the opportunity, to pick this up. When sliced and polished,\r\nthe surface obtained beats the inlaid work of a cabinet-maker all to\r\nnothing. Next, a couple of choanites, one in the dark “rag,” ribbed like\r\nsea-weed; the other in pretty light-brown moss-agate. These two go into\r\nmy breast-pocket for safety. Lastly, what has never been out of my hand\r\nsince I found it—a huge, knotted jasper-agate, of five pounds’ weight.\r\n\r\nI will only add that the beach here described is a first-rate one in its\r\nway, although not my absolute favourite. I had, however, never seen it\r\nbefore, and have never visited it since; moreover, I had not a hammer\r\nwith me, nor any refreshment beyond a cigar, after tramping over many\r\nmiles of deep shingle; consequently, I do not suppose I did justice to\r\nthe contents of that bit of coast.\r\n\r\nBut where am I now? Two hundred miles away, and the scene is changed. I\r\nhave just rounded a headland, on whose summit the ripening corn-field is\r\nwaving and gleaming like the tuft on the head of a woodpecker. Dizzy\r\nprecipices of chalk stand like sugar-loaves against the blue sky, here\r\nand there cleft in a tortuous, yawning chasm. Beneath, the beach seems to\r\nslumber, so gentle is that lisping murmur, where the long billowy swell\r\nwashes the face of the skerries, and lifts up and down their heavy fringe\r\nof tangle like a giant’s beard. Two hours are mine, as we mortals reckon,\r\nbefore I am expected at the evening meal. This time I have my hammer\r\nwith me—no clumsy carpenter’s tool, which might rend or splinter, but a\r\ntempered steel.\r\n\r\nI did but walk a couple of miles in all. I found sundry pieces of\r\nperfectly white agate, one of which proved good enough for a seal. I\r\nbroke open a score or two of jaspers, and was rewarded at last by a\r\nfine slab of the rich brown (quasi-Egyptian). Then I hunted up from\r\nthe shingle a pocketful of “sponges,” and a choanite in dark purple\r\nflint, which is rare. And then time was up, and scaling the cliff by a\r\nwell-known gap and pathway, I returned home to crab-pie and a cup of tea,\r\nand the welcome of a dear, kind face. This part of our coast is much\r\nvisited now by pebble-seekers.\r\n\r\nNow I have crossed a channel of the sea, and have looked upon the mighty\r\nthree-deckers, and all the flower of the yachtery of England; and I\r\nhave strolled through a smart modern town, and have passed a meditative\r\nhalf-hour in a very ancient village, and then, at a sharp turn, I have\r\nquitted the high-road, with its hot milestones, and picked my way through\r\na blossoming lane where the nightingales were singing; and I have\r\nscrambled over the edge of a snipe-bog, and hurried past the mouth of a\r\ndiluvian estuary, and here I am, stretched at full length on the choicest\r\nbit of beach in all the realm of Queen Victoria. In front of me are\r\nsoaring pinnacles of chalk, ribbed and dotted with primeval flints, like\r\nthe gun-muzzles in an upper deck. Behind me rises another barrier, formed\r\nof the dark “greensand;” and on one side, for the space of a mile, these\r\nlofty brows have dipped and disappeared, that the red edge of the wealden\r\nmight crop out from a wide tract of rush-grown water-meadows. Through the\r\nheart of these latter steals a rivulet, beloved of stray wild-fowl, but\r\nnot tenanted by anything so lively as a trout.\r\n\r\nThe position of this beach is all that can be desired, and its contents\r\nwill not disappoint expectation. It has sometimes reminded me of one of\r\nthose angular nooks formed externally by the converging hedges of a\r\ncover and a crop, where you are sure to meet with the hares and pheasants\r\nwhich have come out to feed on your wheat-stubble or turnips. Here,\r\nhowever, instead of the scuttling game, you must look for matchless\r\npebbles.\r\n\r\nOften as I have paced this charming strand, the occasion of my first\r\nstepping upon it was pure accident, as, indeed, are some of the\r\npleasantest turns in life. I remember one summer’s day, when the solid\r\ncliffs seemed to be pulverizing under the heat, and the air-vessels in\r\nexposed sheaves of bladderwrack were splitting and popping like crackers,\r\nI found four or five specimens within a couple of hundred yards which I\r\nhave never since surpassed, seldom equalled. Two of these were _deep red_\r\nchoanites, conveying the idea, not of dull “oxide,” but that the animal’s\r\nblood had suffused the agate; another was a particoloured madrepore,\r\nanother, a moss-jasper.\r\n\r\nThis bay, however, possesses peculiar advantages. In addition to the\r\nfossils which drop from time to time out of its own overhanging cliffs,\r\nit is fed in a remarkable manner from other sources.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUntil of late years, Sussex has been the usual resort of those who\r\ndesired to collect pebbles for the cabinet. The capabilities of this\r\ncoast vary with every twenty miles. The Brighton beach was once famous\r\nfor the supply of “landscape-pebbles;” but in the lapse of years its\r\nfecundity has been sadly impaired. The best chance remaining now is\r\nthat of an occasional waif during the March winds on the sweep fronting\r\nBrunswick Terrace, and for about half a mile toward Shoreham.\r\n\r\nBognor has long reefs of rock at low water, and, by the usual rule, it\r\nought to yield petrified sponges; for I think that, generally speaking,\r\nthe locality determines the animal. But the infirmity of the Bognor shore\r\nis, that its pebbles are chafed and worn to skeletons by the furious\r\nstorms which assail this unprotected coast in winter. No fossil with a\r\ndelicate constitution can long withstand the effect of these gales and\r\nplunging seas.\r\n\r\nOff Beachey-head, in the other direction, is found a variety which I\r\nhave not met with elsewhere. The specimen shown to me was vermicular;\r\nthe creature, which had perhaps been a “sabella,” lying in distinct\r\ncoils, not unlike _macaroni_, in the blue agate. This pebble was a very\r\nlarge and perfect one; and the man who had picked it up, and paid\r\nperhaps half-a-guinea for the dressing of it, was desirous to realize a\r\nfive-pound note. I wish much that it had found its way to the British\r\nMuseum. There is no stone there resembling it.\r\n\r\nAt Deal and Ramsgate, “fortification-agates” may be readily met with,\r\nand sometimes a bit of carnelian: but this last, bright and homogeneous,\r\nis rare. The Hastings beach is mainly worn out. Aldborough, in Suffolk,\r\nwas wont to be famous for its coloured agates; and Fifeshire, and part\r\nof Forfarshire, for eyed jaspers: but many years have gone by since I\r\nvisited either of these counties, and I would not venture to speak with\r\nconfidence concerning their actual beaches now.\r\n\r\nVery good pebbles are picked up at Cromer; and, occasionally, carnelians,\r\nboth red and white. Felixstowe, a little lower down the coast than\r\nAldborough, abounds in yellow agates, some of them beautifully\r\ntranslucent, and rivalling the carnelian in smoothness of texture. At\r\nScarborough, remarkable specimens both of the agates and jaspers are\r\nobtained by those who know where to look for them. Filey has the same\r\ncharms for enticing strangers to wander onwards along its pretty coast.\r\nIndeed, all the Yorkshire beaches deserve and will repay a visit, both in\r\nfossils and transparencies.\r\n\r\nCarnelians are peculiar stones as to their habits, if I may use such an\r\nexpression in speaking of inanimate substances. It were absurd to doubt\r\nthat plenty of them still haunt our English coast; but where they manage\r\nto hide themselves has often perplexed me. The method of searching for\r\nthem is as follows. Instead of keeping the sun behind you, he should now\r\nbe full in front, like a candle in your eyes. But you must not look at\r\nthe sun: you must look along the surface of the beach; and whenever a\r\nbit of carnelian peeps out from the shingle, you will at once descry it,\r\nowing to the position of the great light.\r\n\r\nI tried this once at Blackgang Chine for three-quarters of an hour,\r\nand in the course of that time I filled both my waistcoat-pockets with\r\nred bits. It is true, none of these were larger than pudding-raisins,\r\nand some of them scarcely more brilliant; still, the search was very\r\ndiverting. If the shingle had not been unusually damp, I might have lain\r\ndown every now and then and looked along its surface; in which case I\r\nshould, doubtless, have succeeded better.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Blackgang leads me to speak of the Isle of Wight, as the\r\nchoicest storehouse for this kind of fossils in Britain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as some geologists aver, that the pearly “Vectis” was\r\nat one time joined on to our Hampshire coast, from which it afterwards\r\nbroke off like a loose morsel from the side of a cake, that would go far\r\nto explain the abundance and beauty of its organisms. For, upon such\r\na separation from the mainland, the industrious sea would have great\r\nopportunities of denuding the face of the cliffs and sucking the orifices\r\nof the chines. Also, this circumambient sea is peculiar in its character\r\nhereabouts; and the crystallizing waves impart an unusual lustre to\r\nrolling agates and jaspers.\r\n\r\nThe beaches of the Wight are circumscribed in extent, which is a great\r\nrelief after the interminable ranges on the Sussex coast. The difference\r\nis as great as that between a quiet forenoon spent in the museum in\r\nJermyn Street, and the laborious distractions experienced if we pass a\r\nsimilar interval of time amidst the endless rooms and innumerable cases\r\non the first floor of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe village of Sandown, from the flag-staff on as far as Red Cliff and\r\nCulver, exhibits a tempting and instructive shore. In winter, it is\r\nbetter to commence at the dyke, and end with Red Cliff; but in summer,\r\nyou may walk the whole range with advantage. Here, a couple of hours may\r\nbe taken to as many miles; and if you do not shut your eyes, you must\r\nfill your pockets. But look with resolution for good ones.\r\n\r\nFrom Sandown to Shanklin, in the opposite direction, it is scarcely\r\ninferior. It was once even better; but, lying so near at hand, it has\r\nbeen unceasingly hunted over; and to look for a fine pebble there now, is\r\nalmost like hoping to find a hare sitting in your kitchen-garden. Many\r\ntons’ weight of beautiful fossils have been gathered within the compass\r\nof a morning’s walk here, in the last few years.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of Shanklin Chine occurs a singular collection of\r\nlimestone pebbles, siliceous within, which are well worth examining.\r\nExtraordinarily-tinted choanites are here sometimes detected in the heart\r\nof most unattractive and mis-shapen blocks. I once asked a successful\r\nbeaching lapidary there, how he _knew_ them? He declared that he did\r\nnot know them at all; but that whenever he saw fresh bonzes thrown up,\r\nespecially if with a deep-sea mark upon them, he would break them all,\r\nand generally obtained a superb specimen among them. The objection to\r\nthis murderous process was, as he confessed, that some of the finest were\r\nwont to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nLatterly, I thought I discovered a way to recognize the presence of any\r\nsuch choanite. It is to look closely for a peculiar depression in the\r\nstone which is connected with the principal _air-hole_ belonging to the\r\nfossil. But this method demands time and care.\r\n\r\nOnwards to Luccombe, the beach disappears, owing, I imagine, to immovable\r\ndepth of sand. At Luccombe Chine, it partially revives: but do not linger\r\nhere. Go on to Bonchurch, and as you approach that lovely hillside,\r\nrouse all your energies. Here comes in a mile of sand, small shingle,\r\nand half-buried pebbles, which will put your skill to the test, if skill\r\nyou have. Look out for symptoms of the “tubular” structure, and diverge\r\nnow and then to the pools among those weedy rocks. Many a beautiful\r\n“actinia” in flint lies there snug enough, wedged in a dark cranny,\r\nand coated over with glutinous moss. You must really not be idle now.\r\nDo not even light a cigar, but hammer and delve and scrape away; only\r\ndo not give in until you lay hold of something worth the while. Two\r\nzoophytes, of the agatine-siliceous kind, were picked up on this spot\r\nabout a twelvemonth since, for which large sums of money were offered in\r\nVentnor the same day. For one of this sort, an American gentleman, not\r\nlong ago, gave eight pounds sterling. But there is in Brighton, or was\r\ntill very recently, a pebble from the Rottingdean beach, for which fifty\r\nguineas have been offered to its possessor, and refused. I have not seen\r\nit myself, but I am told that it is a spotted pyriform choanite; the\r\nmaterial, very beautiful agate.\r\n\r\nAt Ventnor, red gravel and diminutive carnelians, some of them not bigger\r\nthan pins’ heads, await the pebble-seeker. Occasionally an agate is found\r\nhere which is “chatoyant,” like an opal, but this is scarce.\r\n\r\nI once tried the Freshwater strand, “ultima thule,” but I only met with\r\ndoubtful, ragged flints. The north side of the island presents on its\r\nshores a surface chiefly of mud and estuary drift, delightful to solans\r\nand sea-gulls, but not profitable for the cabinet of the mineralogist.\r\n\r\nI ought here, in common gratitude, to say something of the beauties of\r\nthe Garden Isle. But, though some of the happiest hours of my life have\r\nbeen passed there, I grudge to dilate upon the theme. I could not, if I\r\nwould, convey to a stranger a sense of the unutterable attachment which I\r\nfeel for its swelling downs and curling seaward bays. Much of the charm\r\nof our old English scenery, which is fast disappearing elsewhere before\r\nthe railway and the canal, is still to be met with in this sequestered\r\nisland. Here are uncultivated rocky slopes, proffering rare wild-flowers;\r\nivy-mantled cliffs and moss-grown brambles; bays which in winter witness\r\nthe howling storm, and sometimes the fearful wreck, but in summer are\r\ninvested with the calm beauty of a moonlit lake. The inhabitants also,\r\nmany of them “aborigines,” have a primitive, unsophisticated character\r\nin the inland villages; while, on the coast, this is chequered by that\r\nroving disposition and semi-superstitious bent which are always to be\r\nfound among sailors.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, the story of a pebble illustrates this trait of character.\r\nSome years ago, I was calling on a lapidary in Sandown who had done\r\na good deal work for me, and done it well. His account was settled,\r\nand I was wishing him good morning, when he drew my attention to a\r\nremarkably beautiful pebble, ready cut and polished, and begged my\r\nacceptance of it. Now the stone, displayed on his board along with other\r\nspecimens, could not fail to sell; and was worth _to him_, I should say,\r\nperhaps a sovereign. I was very unwilling to take it, but there was no\r\nrefusing without offending an old friend; so it went home in my pocket.\r\nBut somehow curiosity was stirred in my mind when reflecting on the\r\ncircumstance afterwards. Why should he wish to make me a present? Or,\r\nallowing for goodwill taking so straightforward a course, why part with a\r\nstone of so much moneyed value? A few days after I dropped in again. My\r\nfriend was out: but I found his wife, and stayed for a chat. Presently\r\nI referred, quite cursorily, to the gift which her husband had made me,\r\n“and,” said I, “I wish only it had been something of less value.” The\r\ngentler sex are sometimes more communicative than their mates. “Ah! sir,”\r\nreplied Mrs. ⸺, “there was reason for giving you _that_, may be. Anyways,\r\nI’m real glad that it’s gone from _us_.” “Indeed! how is that?” “Why,\r\nthat stone was an unlucky stone for us, and I wished it to go, somehow.”\r\nThen I learned from her the following singular tale.\r\n\r\nTwo brothers, sea-faring men, were great friends of the lapidary and his\r\nwife. One day, one of these brothers found this pebble on the beach, and\r\nhad it cut. It turned out, as I have said, a remarkably fine specimen. It\r\nwas what they call a “deep-sea” pebble, and the “choanite” of a reddish\r\nhue lay exactly central in the bonze of white limestone. The sailors\r\nwere both of them quite fond of it: and when they went to sea again, the\r\nhandsome pebble went with them, and was laid “o’ nights” on a shelf by\r\nthe hammock.\r\n\r\nTheir boat was upset: one brother was drowned: the other righted the\r\ncraft and got to shore, not without difficulty. Several articles were\r\nmissing, having gone to the bottom; but the pebble was safe.\r\n\r\nThe survivor brought it back to the lapidary, and made him accept of\r\nit, being unwilling to retain it himself. The lapidary took it, and\r\nput it aside: but his better half found it out, and insisted that he\r\nshould neither sell it nor keep it. So, he _gave it away_. This stone I\r\nafterwards parted with to a London collector: not wishing to preserve\r\nso sad a reminiscence. I took a fossil in exchange, which I almost\r\nimmediately lost. So, nothing connected with the mysterious choanite was\r\n“lucky.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps every feature in “Vectis,” from the matted festoons on its\r\nhoney-combed rocks to the “witchery of its soft blue sky,” predisposes\r\na frequent visitor to approve also of its pebbles. But it is an\r\nunprejudiced fact, that in texture and colour they excel those which are\r\nfound on the Sussex beaches. And while I think highly of our Devonshire\r\njaspers, I remember a jasper-agate, gathered some years ago at Sandown,\r\nwhich might challenge all such stones of native growth in our London\r\nmuseums, and bear away the palm.\r\n\r\nMany a calm summer’s evening, many a stormy winter’s forenoon, have I\r\nwhiled away in absolute contentment on that most interesting shore. In\r\nthe hot noons of July the bathing is delicious; and after your bath, the\r\nshadow cast by overhanging cliffs, and a fanning breeze from the sea,\r\nmake a ramble onwards irresistible. But I found winter as pleasant in its\r\nway. When the gust roared, and chimneys smoked, and the heavens looked\r\ndark and disturbed, it was inspiriting to go forth roughly clad, and to\r\nwatch the fitful changes where the weather-gleam strikes upon Culver;\r\nor to mark how that treacherous mist would come creeping round Dunnose,\r\ntill the “white horses” rose on the sea, and the heavy squall which had\r\nlong been packing in the offing burst with a wild cry, driving in a yet\r\nheavier element with tatters of oar-weed and splinters of broken dyke\r\nagainst the face of the immovable cliff.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Shanklin, the style of scenery as far as Luccombe and the\r\nFishers’ huts, is quaint and picturesque. Here the “Gault” makes its\r\nappearance, and the hill-paths are in consequence slippery and dangerous.\r\nAfter this, succeed several miles of fairy-like beauty. And then, the\r\nstern grandeur of Black-gang, the coast-line trending away in a range\r\nas savage as that of Calabria. And last, the chosen home of the poet,\r\nsublime Freshwater, and rainbow-tinted Alum-Bay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving said so much on the pleasure of beach-rambling, it may be well\r\nto put tourists on their guard in two important particulars. The first\r\nof these touches personal safety. No one should set out upon what may\r\nprove a prolonged expedition without first ascertaining, _on Kalendar\r\nauthority_, the hours of the tide for that day. There are sundry points\r\non the coast of the Isle of Wight, for instance, where after a couple\r\nof hours’ progress, on scientific thoughts intent, the pedestrian may\r\nfind himself hemmed in by a jutting precipice in front, while the\r\nadvancing tide behind has gradually cut off all hopes of a retreat on\r\n“terra firma:” and as the face of the cliff is seldom such as admits of\r\nbeing scaled, it will then fare badly with him if he be not “the king of\r\nfishes.”\r\n\r\nThe other matter respects fatigue. Hearty exercise is desirable; not\r\nso that which results in utter exhaustion. My own experience is as\r\nfollows:—I have climbed to the summit of Sca’ Fell, and then walked back,\r\nfootsore and fasting, to Keswick. I have swum a mile before breakfast. I\r\nhave ascended Mount Etna at midnight in December’s snow. But for sheer\r\nfatigue, pulling at the muscles, and drying up the marrow, there is\r\nnothing equal to ten miles of stiff shingle, while a foggy north-easter\r\ncurrycombs your face, and perhaps your shoe-leather has been laid open by\r\nthe edge of an inauspicious flint.\r\n\r\nIf in addition to all this, forgetting “Cording,” you have sallied forth\r\n_non bene relictâ parmulâ_, your condition is by no means enviable.\r\nTherefore, whoever intends to go beaching in earnest should look to his\r\nouter man, and carry with him certain creature-comforts, not omitting to\r\ninclude in these a supply of good tobacco.\r\n\r\nYet one word more upon this head. Have a due regard to the well-being of\r\nyour eyes. They are, as you will not fail to acknowledge, the working\r\nparty on these occasions. Manage how you will, they _must_ be subjected\r\nto a great stress and strain. Give them half an hour’s respite, if\r\npossible, while you sit down and inhale the “weed.” It is unpleasant to\r\nfind, after too intense a service on the part of your “daylights,” as you\r\nreturn homewards along the meadow-path, that a beach you have left two or\r\nthree miles behind you is all _coming back_, whether you like it or no,\r\nupon your organs of vision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the whole, summer is the most fruitful season for stocking a cabinet,\r\non account of the more powerful illumination cast upon the objects of\r\nyour search. But in winter the beach itself is very likely to be in\r\nbetter condition, for it is oftener agitated, and many specimens will\r\ncome to the surface which in calmer weather lie buried under sand. It\r\nis important to train yourself to attentive observation, and after long\r\nhabit the ear will listen intuitively.\r\n\r\nIf you hear the sea make a dull, booming noise during the night, be on\r\nthe look-out two or three tides later, when the first shingle now thrown\r\nup has sifted and settled down. Large pebbles will then be found on the\r\ntop of all, the process being much like that which takes place on shaking\r\na basin of lump sugar.\r\n\r\nBut it will be well for you to be always on the alert. The seaside\r\nelements must be coaxed and humoured, if you hope to get anything by\r\ntheir agency. A beach itself is exceedingly capricious. On some days you\r\nmay walk for miles and remark nothing worth picking up; perhaps the next\r\nday, over the same ground, so great will be the profusion of fossils as\r\nto suggest the idea that since your last visit a petrified shoal had\r\nreturned to life, swum into the bay, and there been once more stifled in\r\ngurgling lime, or liquid silex, and penetrated by the metallic “moss.”\r\n\r\n“The sea yields its harvests without sowing or planting,” and\r\nseaside scenery is exquisite if you have come upon it where it is\r\nunsophisticated. Happily it is in such sequestered “Edens of the\r\n_western_ wave” that the most desirable pebbles are met with. I have\r\ngathered rare specimens where the dor-hawk was wheeling overhead, and\r\nsaucy sea-gulls screeching almost in my face; while a cunning crow would\r\nwatch from a projecting ledge of rock to see whether I was about to\r\ncapture, and afterwards throw away, anything which might serve him for a\r\nluncheon.\r\n\r\nThe terraces of Margate and Ramsgate are invaluable to the tired artizans\r\nof London seeking their well-earned recreation; but no poet could venture\r\nto affirm of them what Scott said of “Brignall banks,” that they are\r\n“wild and fair.” But quit these populous thoroughfares, and get away to\r\npearly Beachey Head, or roam the lone strands of Yorkshire or Devon,\r\nor go and lose yourself among shadowy nooks and gleaming bays in the\r\nsweetest of all islands, and you will possess the genuine colour and\r\nscent, and music and mystery of the sea, as the Creator has framed and\r\nblended that wondrous element.\r\n\r\nYou need not look for pebbles unless you like; sometimes it were\r\nbetter not. But saunter down to the water’s crinkled edge, and inhale\r\nthat indescribable odour from old rock, slippery now with dulse and\r\nribbon-weed—Piesse and Lubin distil nothing to equal it—and con the page\r\nin Nature’s volume which lies open before you; it will never give you a\r\nhead-ache, nor a heart-ache either.\r\n\r\nHere, after presently stripping to the elbow, you may surprise a\r\nhermit-crab, or catch the spotted “goby” in his dark saline pool, but\r\nplease let him go again; you ought to give him his freedom, if only out\r\nof gratitude; for all this time your own tired body is being braced and\r\nrefreshed, and your mind, yesterday jaded and careworn, is winning back\r\nits elasticity under a sense of blessed repose.\r\n\r\nI will now mention some peculiarities in the nature of our beaches, which\r\nI have noted from time to time in the book of my experience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA BEACH is supposed to be a permanent accumulation of pebbles and small\r\nshingle, due to such cliffs or banks as are near at hand. And this\r\ngeneral definition would be so far scientifically correct, if nature\r\nwere stagnant like the surface of a deserted mill-pond. But, as Nature\r\nis always at work, always shifting the scenes, the above definition,\r\nalthough it sounds like a truism, does not hold good in either of its\r\nclauses. The accumulation which we look upon is _not_ permanent, nor\r\nis it always due to a neighbouring source. Sometimes the collection of\r\nstones which we find heaped up in an immemorial bay has been washed\r\nround—much of it, perchance, recently—from a distant quarter. And this\r\nmight be taking place under our very eyes, and we not know it, just as\r\nwe do not _see_ the grass grow. Except in very calm weather, beaches are\r\ncontinually travelling, and they travel rapidly along certain lines of\r\ncoast, until they arrive at a terminal point or headland. To get round\r\nthis latter takes time, but they do get round it at last, with the help\r\nof strong gales prevailing in one direction, and under the rushing tides\r\nof an equinox. Now if we suppose a few acres of shingle to be once fairly\r\ncarried past such a promontory, and discharged into the curve of an\r\nelliptical bay, they will be locked in, and may, perhaps, never get out\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI have myself no doubt that Sandown Beach is fed and replenished in this\r\nmanner: and the bay being deeply indented with the points of Culver and\r\nDunnose, prominent at opposite extremities, egress is difficult. Yet\r\nmost persons might naturally suppose that whatever they find on the\r\nbeach here is due to its overhanging cliffs.\r\n\r\nSome of the best pebbles travel fast, and are, in fact, migratory, till\r\nthey reach such a “nidus” as I have described. This is owing to the\r\nrounded form which fossils usually assume. Angular lumps rather remain\r\nstationary. Jasper I suppose makes few excursions: while the agates and\r\noval choanites are continually on the move, and may have visited a dozen\r\ndifferent localities before they are picked up. I have hunted a bit of\r\nyellow agate in this way for above a mile in the course of a few weeks,\r\ndropping it again on purpose, and never finding it in the same place.\r\n\r\nBeside the above real motion of a beach, there is an apparent total\r\nchange for a time which is by no means uncommon in exposed situations.\r\n\r\nThis is, when an inshore gale drifts the sand and conceals for a day or\r\ntwo the entire mass of shingle. It is a provoking circumstance when it\r\noccurs, but it seldom lasts long in its effects. The sudden re-appearance\r\nof half a mile of solid beach, as if by magic, on a change of the wind,\r\nhas sometimes surprised me in spite of past experience.\r\n\r\nIn average weather, when a beach is not migrating, the rise and fall of\r\nthe pebbles in the same lines is very observable. The only change then\r\ninduced in a stratum of shingle is by the suck and draught of the sea.\r\nThis latter, however, is unceasing, as may readily be tested by bathers;\r\neverything which you set your foot upon under the wave being in a gentle\r\nrolling motion. It yields an amusing diversion in the water, to play the\r\npebbles about under one’s feet. The effect of it, however, is not so\r\nquaint as that which I remember experiencing many years ago in Loch Long,\r\nwhere are no pebbles, but plenty of mud. Here, wading out in the shallows\r\nto arrive at swimming depth, I put one foot after the other on the backs\r\nof some unsuspecting flounders lying on the sand, and laughed aloud at\r\nthe tickling sensation as they glided away from under me.\r\n\r\nBut all _motion_ is a source of interest and charm, especially while we\r\nare on the sunny side of forty. I believe that this forms one feature of\r\ndelight in the capture of winged insects. Exquisite as is a good British\r\ncollection, the dry side of the science, whatever learned entomologists\r\nmay say, is not the most inviting, and would attract comparatively few\r\npersons after a time.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, who would care for cover-shooting, if all were\r\nsitting-shots? But the “runners” and “fliers” impart a zest.\r\n\r\nEven here, my friends the seaside pebbles have a claim to please: for,\r\nalthough inanimate, they are not altogether devoid of motion, as I think\r\nI have shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    CONCERNING CERTAIN PETRIFIED ZOOPHYTES, NOW GENERALLY SUPPOSED\r\n    TO BE EXTINCT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe petrifaction of an animal form or structure has always appeared to\r\nme a most singular process in Nature. The change of such substances as\r\ncellular tissue, or fish-bone, or cartilage, or a light, leathery skin,\r\ninto minerals such as silex and agate, seems at first like magic. Scott,\r\nwhen describing the “foliaged tracery” in the east oriel of Melrose\r\nAbbey, tells his reader:\r\n\r\n    “Thou wouldst have thought some fairy’s hand\r\n    ’Twixt poplars straight the osier wand\r\n    In many a freakish knot had twined,\r\n    Then framed a spell when the work was done,\r\n    And changed the willow wreaths to stone.”\r\n\r\nBut there is no magic in Nature; and when we meet with undoubted\r\nphenomena, however strange they may appear, in any department of her\r\nrealm, we must behave ourselves like matter-of-fact persons and set\r\nabout accounting for them logically. In a genuine petrifaction there\r\nare two ways of doing this, or, in other words, there are two different\r\nmodes in which Nature may have acted so as to produce the result which\r\nwe are considering. One of these is that of a simple _substitution_; the\r\nparticles of one substance being gradually removed, and those of another\r\ntaking their place. This must have been the process which obtained in\r\nmany well-known instances: as, for example, when the thin, leathery shell\r\nor husk of an echinus is found perfectly rendered, both as to its general\r\noutline and minute markings, in solid flint or limestone. We feel quite\r\nsure that the original husk has perished; but here is its second self.\r\n\r\nThe other mode is that of actual _transmutation_, wherein no part\r\nof the original substance is destroyed or removed, but its physical\r\nconditions undergo a total change, by means of either infiltration,\r\nor crystallization, or perhaps both of them combined. This process\r\nhas obtained in such cases as a petrified shark’s tooth, or a fossil\r\ntrilobite from the Wenlock.\r\n\r\nThe tooth, which was once bone, is now a kind of metallic stone: the\r\ntrilobite once, as we suppose, shell and cartilage, is now a something\r\nbetween limestone and cast-iron. And this change is very wonderful; but,\r\nas was said above, there is no magic in it, no more than in the hardening\r\nof an infant’s skull, or the solidifying of the arm and leg-bones by the\r\nabsorption of phosphate of lime. Besides, the stone and metal now present\r\nare still something different from what we ordinarily mean by those\r\nterms: the petrified tooth is not like a flint-stone, neither could you\r\ncut horse-shoe nails out of the trilobite.\r\n\r\nIn fact, every _real_ process has a character of its own: a something\r\nwhich distinguishes it from any other, despite of general resemblances up\r\nto a certain point.\r\n\r\nPetrifaction, then, being assumed, as an operation which has really taken\r\nplace after one way or another, it falls next to be considered, what\r\nwas the original nature of these fossils? I mean the objects which we\r\nfind thus preserved in our seaside pebbles. What was the department in\r\nCreation to which they belonged? Was it _animal_ or _vegetable_ before it\r\nthus became altogether _mineral_?\r\n\r\nFor myself, I will at once say that I have no doubt it was animal; but\r\nnot an animal of a very high order. The specimens which I now possess,\r\nand which are all of them chosen, some of them _rare_, I should assign\r\nto such creatures as the “zoophytes” or “polyps,” both radiated and\r\nglobular. And I know of nothing, among many hundreds of specimens\r\ngathered from a dozen different beaches, which presents the evidence of\r\nhaving belonged to vegetable organization, with the exception of sundry\r\nvarieties of petrified wood, which speak for themselves, and could not be\r\nmistaken by anybody.\r\n\r\nI will now state two or three reasons, which to my own mind are\r\nconclusive, for the above decision.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, the structures here perpetuated in stone are\r\nof great delicacy, and they have been immersed in ancient seas, as is\r\ntestified by the localities in which they are obtained. Now vegetable\r\nstructure as fine as this, if immersed long enough for any such change\r\nto come in question, must have utterly perished by maceration, and then\r\nthe petrifaction could not have taken place. I know that part of the\r\nstem (and I think fruit) of one species of “conifer” has been found in\r\nthe Isle of Wight in the condition of a fossil; but this belonged to a\r\nhardy class of plants, and the lobes or plates which composed its bark\r\nand husk are themselves highly siliceous, to say nothing of the presence\r\nof iron in the rind of most of these stems. So that the process would be\r\na long one, and the fibrous material of the tree would stand it well. But\r\nin these pebbles some of the threads or tubes run from the size of small\r\ntwine to that of the rays in a spider’s web; and no vegetable substance\r\nwith which I am acquainted, excepting the filaments of “asbestos” (which\r\nis a vegetating _mineral_) in rock-crystal, could abide and retain its\r\nform, so as to allow of the changes by infiltration or otherwise which\r\nhave passed upon the original structure.\r\n\r\nIf it be said in reply to this, that we have the exquisitely delicate\r\n“dendritic” markings, as of leaves and filaments of shrubs or sea-weed,\r\nin the heart of the white chalcedony “mocha-stones” from the East, the\r\nanswer is evident: these are not _really_ vegetable traces, but only\r\n_resemble_ such in their configuration and colours. They are simply\r\nshoots and ramifications of a metal,—as iron or manganese. Those in the\r\n“weed-agate” of India, which exactly resemble sprays of fine sea-weed,\r\nare produced by “delessite.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is both diverting and instructive to observe how Nature\r\npermits, and even seems to abound in, curious coincidences and striking\r\nresemblances between things of entirely diverse character. The dried\r\npolyp, called “encrinoid echinoderm,” bears a wonderful likeness to one\r\nspecies of Indian corn. (See the plate at p. 137 of Mr. Rymer Jones’s\r\nbeautiful work on “The Animal Kingdom.”) And the other day, when I was\r\nenjoying a leisure hour in the British Museum, I suddenly remarked that\r\nthe “carapace” (back-shell) of the splendid fossil specimen of the\r\n“Holoptychius nobilissimus” in one of the cases might serve for a sketch\r\nof the back of a _capercailzie_, where the grey and purple feathers\r\noverlap one another. Yet here is no _real_ connection whatever. Only Dame\r\nNature had gone to play.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ The preservation of these “polyp” forms, in the manner in\r\nwhich they _have_ been preserved, seems to me to be due to a feature\r\nor circumstance which is strictly animal and not vegetable. I refer to\r\nthe fact of the creature, while it was alive, _inhabiting a house_, a\r\nhouse built by himself, or emanating from his own substance. For, just\r\nas we could know but little of the existence or habits of “shell-fish,”\r\nwere it not for their _shells_, so I think we may assume that the\r\n_choanite_ must, when alive, have dwelt in a tough, horny “coperculum,”\r\nanswering to the shape of his body and the number of his “polyps” (if\r\nhe was a _compound_ creature), because otherwise he would have been\r\nlike a jelly-fish or naked slug, and his “polypary” could not have been\r\npreserved in a stony fossil. Of course, whatever was merely flesh,\r\nor adipose matter, has long since perished; but the _house_ or shell\r\nin which it whilome dwelt remains. Thus, the “echinus” built himself\r\na _dome_, such a residence as a _hedgehog_ would require to live\r\ncomfortably in, and through the various orifices of which his spines\r\ncould be protruded at pleasure. The “ammonite,” being shaped like a\r\n_snake_, preferred living in a shell of that form, where the creature\r\nwhen coiled up was safe. The “alcyonite” had a more exquisite taste in\r\nhouse-building, answering, we may be sure, to the complex and beautiful\r\nstructure with which the great Creator had endowed him. His home was a\r\npalace, containing long galleries and secret doors and wheel-windows; and\r\nhere some of the delicate tubes are fringed at their extremities like the\r\npetals of a flower.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of these formations may be very great, we can scarcely\r\ntell how far removed from our own era. For, while the zoophyte itself is\r\nof a perishable nature, we are acquainted with no substance more durable\r\n(if we except the gems) than that calcareous matter of which these tubes\r\nand plates were formed, when once it has been subjected to processes of\r\ninfiltration by crystallizing mineral and metallic oxides.\r\n\r\nNow, I think this argument a very strong one; in fact, although simple,\r\nalmost unanswerable. For no _plant_ dwells thus in a house. We have the\r\nplant itself, but nothing more; and if this be not capable, and I hold it\r\nto be incapable, of sustaining the most vehement mineralizing process in\r\nthe crucible of Nature, its history must be a brief one, and excepting in\r\nthe dark “lithographs” of the coal-measures, its memory must pass away. I\r\nhave already allowed an exceptionable case in favour of the _conifers_,\r\nwhich, be it observed, nowise resemble anything portrayed in siliceous\r\npebbles, and it is remarkable how much this class of plants predominates\r\nin the COAL.\r\n\r\nI have always been suspicious of what are called “vegetable\r\npetrifactions.” I examined those at Tivoli, near Rome, in the year 1845,\r\nand I made up my mind that they are simple _incrustations_. In like\r\nmanner, many of the buildings at Pæstum are constructed with a kind\r\nof “travertine” taken from the bed of a neighbouring river, and which\r\nrapidly incrusts any solid objects submitted to the action of its waters.\r\nBut the truth is, the vegetable pipe or “straw” remains for a while,\r\nowing to the silex which entered into its composition while the plant\r\nwas growing. After some years the _straw_ decays, and there is a hole or\r\ndepression in that part of the pillar or pediment. On the other hand, a\r\ncalcareous “menstruum,” imbibing silex and iron, hardens into a substance\r\nwhich, like the best mortar or cement used in building, will sometimes\r\noutlast even the blocks of limestone or oolite which it was put to bind\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ Animal organization, such even as these polyps possessed,\r\nrenders the phenomena much more intelligible. Our best authorities in\r\nsuch matters tell us that “_insects_ have neither lungs nor branchiæ;\r\nbut in them the air passes into _a system of tubes_, whose structure\r\nresembles that of an elastic webbing.” And again, “The _annelids_\r\npossess an _uninterrupted circulation_.” And again, “In the ‘Nymphon’\r\nand ‘Pycnogonum’ molluscs, which are crustaceans having considerable\r\nresemblance to certain of our field spiders, the intestine _penetrates to\r\nthe very extremities_ of the feet and claws.”—_Animal Kingdom._ Now here\r\nare cited some of the very desiderata which I should have named, had I\r\nbeen asked what conditions were needed _à priori_ for such petrifactions\r\nto occur. I will only add, under this head, that a fine _annelid_ occurs\r\nin the blue agate off Eastbourne; that a “myriapod,” which is among the\r\nchromo plates of this volume, has all the characteristics of _insect_\r\nlife and motion; and that a _spider_ is the nearest thing I know of, in\r\nsome respects, to what the “choanite” must have been when that mollusc\r\ncondensed himself from a cylinder to a sphere. Perhaps, however, the\r\nstrongest clause in this part of the argument may be drawn from the\r\n“sponges.” Here the creature itself, wonderful to relate, is a _viscous\r\nfluid_, and the intricate mansion which he inhabits is a globose,\r\nhorny skeleton, perforated with endless small tubes opening into wider\r\ngalleries. There was, however, in the perfect animal, I am assured, one\r\nmain central cavity, which gave strength and unity to the entire fabric\r\nby the plan of its walls, and, perhaps, by a main valve. Throughout the\r\nwhole of this hydraulic system the sea-water, on the circulation of which\r\nthe zoophyte depended for life and health, could be pumped to and fro\r\nat pleasure. And, evidently, when the “habitat” of such a creature was\r\nsuddenly invaded by a siliceous crystalline solution, extinction of the\r\nanimal and a petrifying investment of his abode would be simultaneous.\r\n\r\n_Lastly._ If the objects here petrified had been vegetable in their\r\nextraction, should we not, with the aid of the microscope, be able to\r\nidentify them? But this I have never yet succeeded in doing; yet all\r\nthe petrified “woods” are well known. I have myself obtained slabs of\r\nthe “acacia” from the coast of South Devon; of the “beech,” in Sussex;\r\nof coniferous wood almost everywhere. And, what is more to the purpose,\r\nthough the petrifaction in such cases is deep and perfect, no one looking\r\nupon it could doubt for a moment that the original structure had been\r\nthat of wood from a forest-tree. Agatized as it is, and penetrated here\r\nand there by metallic colours, and shot with rays of jasper, the lines in\r\nits fabric reveal _the texture of wood_.\r\n\r\nI may mention here, that every one who walks our beaches, with a view to\r\nthe collection of fossil specimens, will do well to carry in his or her\r\npocket a good lens, of large external diameter; mine measures about two\r\ninches across, and I may truly say it has saved me a world of trouble,\r\nbesides affording me much satisfaction at odd moments in the scrutiny of\r\npebbles of different kinds and textures.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter I may be permitted to draw the reader’s\r\nattention to a theory held by the late Dr. Mantell. I cannot, at this\r\nmoment, lay my hand upon the volume in which it occurs, but I am pretty\r\nsure it will be found in his “Geology of the Isle of Wight:” a book\r\nwhich, for elegance of composition, and sound information, can hardly\r\nbe too much commended; though a resident lapidary in Sandown _did_ once\r\nsay to me, while thumbing the pages of a well-worn copy, “Ah, sir!\r\nif the Doctor had come _here_ and stayed a week instead of listening\r\nonly to what those fellows told him in Ryde, I could have shown him\r\nsomething which he doesn’t seem to know, as to how the bit of coast runs\r\nhereabouts.” Dr. Mantell’s idea was this: he held that when a mollusc\r\nwas subjected to the first stage in the petrifying process, there was,\r\nin the dying of the creature, some effusion of blood (or _quasi_-blood),\r\nand that this, being the very pith and strength of the animal’s system,\r\nwould, in many cases, tinge the future stone indelibly. He carried this\r\nnotion so far as to assign some dark blotches, apparent in the masonry of\r\na wall, to such a source as being their most probable cause; and he gave\r\nto the thing itself the graphic title of _Molluskite_. In this view I\r\nwill only add that I am inclined to agree with him; and in my “myriapod,”\r\nalready referred to, there is a blood-red spot which pierces through the\r\nstone, appearing on both sides, and which I at first supposed to be a\r\npiece of “shell-lac,” but I now rather regard it as the trace left of\r\nhimself by some marauding “pholas,” who, after drilling a hole through\r\nthe solid pebble, found his own grave there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    ON THE LITORAL LABOURS OF THE OCEAN, AND ON SEASIDE SPORTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more I consider the various phenomena occurring from time to time\r\non the dry land, and the more opportunity I have of observing for\r\nmyself simple facts in geology, the more I am struck at once with the\r\ntruthfulness and the _unexpectedness_—if I may use such a word—of the\r\nassertion which Moses makes in the 1st chapter of Genesis, that the\r\nappearance of the “dry land” was due to “the gathering together of the\r\nwaters unto one place.”\r\n\r\nThe assertion has an unexpected (_à priori_) character; for continents\r\nand tracts of dry land do not, on the face of them, suggest the idea of\r\nany recent presence of incumbent masses of salt water—perhaps miles in\r\ndepth. But it is eminently truthful, for it is a key to many an abstruse\r\nproblem in Nature, and a confirmation of every sound and enlarged view of\r\nthe past history of this globe.\r\n\r\nThe ocean has been busily at work—in old times, inland; in later times,\r\ncoastwise; in all times subterraneously. This last point is proved by\r\nthe volcanoes, and that in a twofold argument. Such volcanoes as are\r\nnow extinct, are so because they have lost all communication with the\r\nsea; such of them as are active, are so because they draw supplies of\r\nsalt-water from the nearest part of the ocean, and this they can only do\r\nsubterraneously.\r\n\r\nBut in speaking of the labours of the ocean, I shall confine myself to\r\nthe seashore, as the scope of this little volume does not go beyond\r\nthat region. The point where sea and land meet is the critical point\r\nfor all observers of Nature. Here the disciple of geology should serve\r\nhis apprenticeship, and if he cannot accumulate facts, and glean a kind\r\nof inspiration here, he cannot do so anywhere. Moreover here, better,\r\nwe think, than in any inland scenery, Man can muse and meditate. That\r\never-varying curved line of moisture on the shore depicts the fluctuating\r\nchanges which momentarily visit his “little day;” the tide running in\r\nis the flood of his early life; the tide running out is the ebb of his\r\ndeclining years; the vast sweep of the coast, backed by the upland\r\nranges and everlasting hills, and itself only lost to sight in the far\r\nhorizon, tells of a steadfast future, an immutable eternity.\r\n\r\nAbove all, those who desire to note epochs in the flight of Time, and\r\nto set up way-marks in the Earth’s chronology, must study the line of\r\nthe sea-coast, the ancient and the modern, for here, if anywhere, the\r\ndial-plate is uncovered, and the shadow of the gnomon may be traced\r\nthrough some seconds of the enormous day which has witnessed the\r\nexistence of the heavens and the earth.\r\n\r\nI have already, in my opening chapter, remarked how the sea brings down,\r\nin the course of ages, many a pebbly beach from cliff and causeway. But\r\nI am far from assuming, therefore, that _all_ the pebbles of a beach\r\ncome from the land. The usual bottom of the sea is, indeed, no pebbly\r\nshore; but there are many submerged rocks of sandstone and oolite, out of\r\nwhose ribs and crevices, from time to time, fossils may be washed, just\r\nas our own chalk-cliffs, the main resort of the siliceous pebbles, were\r\nthemselves laid down in deep seas. And the salt water, which is always\r\nacting gradually to dissolve certain rocks, when it removes portions\r\nof these from the edges and promontories, will occasionally bring their\r\ncontents to shore. But these results, although interesting to those who\r\nmaybe searching after pebbles (and a deep-sea pebble is a prize), were\r\nnot what I pointed at when I spoke of the labours of the ocean.\r\n\r\nI have frequently walked the shore, and observed the colour of the waves,\r\nafter what is termed a “ground swell,” which had lasted, perhaps, for\r\nthirty or forty hours. The cerulean hue is then gone, and to it has\r\nsucceeded, in certain localities, an opaque chalky tinge, showing that\r\nthe water is now heavily charged with lime. Also fragments of shells\r\nrolled together are united with heavy masses of sand, and sometimes of\r\nbroken pumice-stone, and a kind of rough marl is rapidly formed, and\r\nleft on the beach. After a gale, and succeeding “swell,” I have met with\r\nthese imperfect boulders, varying in size from that of a man’s fist to\r\nsome larger than his head. At the same time, any low ranges of littoral\r\nrocks become crusted over with the superabundant lime, being more than\r\nthe waves will long hold in solution; and a coating is thus given to such\r\nrocks which is sometimes as hard as is the native limestone itself, a\r\nfew weeks’ exposure to the sun and air sufficing to effect this.\r\n\r\nSome fourteen years ago, I had an opportunity, when in Sicily, of\r\nexamining a portion of the coast between Messina and Catania, and I\r\nregret that I did not avail myself of it more heartily. But I have\r\nseen M. Quatrefage’s book on this subject, and his observations, most\r\ncarefully and laboriously conducted, may almost be said to close\r\nthat part of the subject, as far as any prospect of eliciting fresh\r\ninformation is concerned. I think he measured some of the long reefs,\r\nand the evident increase _by incrustation_ extended for many miles of\r\nthe coast-line, and was of considerable thickness. I have observed the\r\nsame “masonic” phenomenon off the coast of St. Andrews, in Fifeshire,\r\nwhen swimming out among the weedy rocks, and afterwards climbing to the\r\nshore. I then thought it was the work of marine insects, as I had heard\r\nof molluscs building causeways of tubes of limestone, but I incline now\r\nto think it was the sea doing it, as they say, at _first-hand_. The sea,\r\nhowever, does a great deal in the same line at second-hand, by means,\r\nchiefly, of two species of zoanthoid polyps. Of these little creatures,\r\none kind constructs the bases of coral islands, and another the summits\r\n(at the least) of the madrepore reefs. It is impossible to doubt that by\r\nlabours so patiently carried on, and so widely diffused, some beneficent\r\npurpose is aimed at and attained by Providence. Perhaps they operate,\r\nfinally, to warn the shipping of adventurous merchants from entering\r\ncertain dangerous bays and straits; and if the humble madrepore has got\r\na bad name through this, as though he had made the danger, he certainly\r\nsuffers unjustly, for what real difference, as to ultimate and assured\r\nsafety, can a few inches more of water in such places make? Far better\r\nto raise an impassable bar across the way at once, and proclaim, “no\r\nthoroughfare!”\r\n\r\nThen the ocean supplies a great market, much the greatest in the world. I\r\ndo not know the proportion of persons in Central Europe who live on fish\r\nto those who live on meat, but I think, in both Northern and Southern\r\nEurope, the former exceed the latter. In Connemara, on the western coast\r\nof Ireland, and in the Scotch highlands of Argyle and Inverness, fish is\r\ndecidedly the staple article of diet, as far as animal food is concerned.\r\nI believe the same is true of Cornwall and part of Devon. The herring,\r\nthe pilchard, the haddock, the cod, and the salmon—to say nothing of the\r\nsole and other flat-fish—feed millions of persons, and, with the help of\r\noatmeal, barley-cakes, and (in a good year) potatoes, feed them well.\r\nShell-fish are also no mean item, and are sometimes the most refreshing\r\nof all dishes, especially at the supper-table. Now the sea, it must\r\nbe remembered, does all this for man without harrowing, ploughing, or\r\nsowing. The fisherman’s net may be said to _reap_, that is all.\r\n\r\nAgain, if jewels be of any real value, what is the value (among such)\r\nof a collar of faultless pearls? what is there among minerals, so pure,\r\nso exquisitely beautiful, whether we regard their tint or their form?\r\nThese are the spontaneous production of a humble shell-fish; some say, an\r\noffering from the creature when he has been wounded. If so, men may here\r\nlearn a lesson in kind, and return good for evil to those who persecute\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAgain, the ocean is _our_ defence: long may it prove so!\r\n\r\n    “Britannia needs no bulwark,\r\n    No towers along the steep,\r\n    Her march is o’er the mountain wave,\r\n    Her home is on the deep.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt, since man is a creature who _lives_ upon the dry land, the\r\nland is on the whole the most valuable; but what would the land be\r\nwithout the sea? Nay, to go no further, how could we exist in summer and\r\nautumn, if deprived of the sea-breezes? For myself, though naturally fond\r\nof field-sports, and delighting in botanical and entomological pursuits,\r\nI know of no treat equal to that of a seaside ramble in the month, say,\r\nof September or October.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider how very little mischief the ocean does us. Much\r\nfewer people die of what are called “casualties” by sea, than of those by\r\nland. The truth is, we always hear of such as are lost at sea, because\r\nof the loss of _the ship_, which involves a question of insurance-money;\r\nbut of deaths inland, especially in far countries, and if belonging to\r\nstrange peoples or savage tribes, we perchance scarce hear at all. YEH,\r\nthe Chinese Commissioner, killed, it was said, 70,000 persons in the\r\ncourse of his brief career, for _political_ reasons. How long would it\r\ntake for 70,000 persons to perish by storms or accidents at sea, in the\r\nusual course of things, in one small part of the globe?\r\n\r\nA wreck, it must be allowed, is a terrible thing; but so is a house on\r\nfire, or a flood up the country.\r\n\r\nThe sea, moreover, labours to help the land in other ways, some of them\r\nsingular enough. Many thousands of poor unproductive acres have, in these\r\nlast ten years, been rendered rich and fertile by supplies of GUANO. And\r\nwhence did we get the guano? why, from the _sea-fowl_, and from a barren\r\nrock in the bosom of the seas! This is no trifling benefit to reap from\r\nthe “desert sea.”\r\n\r\nWhat a beautiful thing is _glass_, and how indispensable it has become to\r\nus! Perhaps no other material can be insured to be _perfectly_ clean and\r\npure for drinking out of. For many years our glass-works depended mainly\r\nupon a constant supply of _kelp_ from the Orkneys, and even now they\r\ncannot dispense with the sea-sand.\r\n\r\nThe porcelain mills in Staffordshire and elsewhere are very glad to\r\nobtain a cartload of pebbles from the beach. These go to the “crushing”\r\ndepartment; and if among them there are, as there are pretty sure to\r\nbe, a dozen lumps of chalcedony, the material of the next batch of\r\nteacups will be unusually fine, provided some one who understands them\r\n_picks_ the stones first. Indeed, if I had no preferable occupation in\r\nthis world, I have often thought I would collect the rough agates and\r\nchalcedonies from sundry localities I wot of, and fabricate a _biscuit_\r\nof my own, as the king of Saxony does at Meissen. But though I have not\r\nthe leisure for this, others may have; and so I mention it here.\r\n\r\nEspecially I incline to think that a splendid kind of “Wedgewood” ware\r\nwould result from the crushing of certain jaspers, for I suppose their\r\ncolours would not fade in the furnace.\r\n\r\nThen, the seaside visit, I must not omit to mention, can be enlivened\r\nby sundry local pursuits and amusements. Besides the pleasures of a\r\nsailing-boat, and a run with the “dredge” and the “dipping-net,” there\r\nis the exciting march of the Shrimper, knee-deep in the wave, pushing\r\nthe hoop-net before him, and every now and then halting to fill his\r\nfront pocket with the silvery jumpers. If there are rocks near at hand,\r\nthere will be _lobster-pots_ to visit; and the habits and deportment of\r\na live lobster are among the most curious in creation. In agility and\r\ncunning he surpasses even a salmon. Also, for the benefit of those who at\r\nall regard what they eat—and he who disregards it is a goose—I may just\r\nventure to hint that a _real_ lobster-salad (London confectioners have a\r\nway of selling _sham_ ones,) is a dish worthy their serious attention:\r\nBarclay’s stout being not a bad accompaniment.\r\n\r\nBut the above will sound to some persons too “Epicurean.” O gentle\r\nreader, do you love moonlight? and if you have ever admired the\r\nreflection of that planet in a lake or river, what will you say to it\r\nwhen you contemplate it in Sandown Bay? Culver on one side, looking\r\nas if it were of green glass, and the cliffs of Shanklin on the other\r\nresembling walls and pillars of porphyry! Or is your taste for the\r\nsterner beauty of storms and angry seas? Then visit Blackgang Chine\r\nlate in winter, and you may “sup full of horrors.” The appearance of\r\nthe waves below, as they come in over that fatal “race,” and the aspect\r\nof the earth and the heavens above, when the lightning darts from “St.\r\nCatherine’s head” and sweeps like a destroying Angel down the chasm of\r\nthe Chine, yield together perhaps the grandest picture of desolation and\r\nterror that English scenery ever shows.\r\n\r\nThere are persons still living who are unwilling _to speak_ of the\r\nfearful tempest they witnessed on that coast when the Clarendon was lost.\r\n\r\nLastly, to return to our “pebbles,” the sea is an indefatigable agent in\r\nthe partly mechanical, partly chemical, work of infiltration; a process\r\nto which both the fine texture and varied colours of these agatized\r\nfossils are mainly due.\r\n\r\nBut of this I must treat in the chapter which follows.\r\n\r\nEnough, for the present, of the ocean itself—of its labours and its\r\nsports. But, as some readers love _a comparison_, and hold that every\r\ntheme grows dull without this, I will quote from the lips of a great\r\ntraveller, whom it was once my luck to meet, his opinion of the rival\r\nclaims of the Desert, to that admiration which we islanders lavish on\r\nthe heaving Ocean and the winding Shore. I cannot pretend to remember\r\nhis very words; but he was eloquent as the son of Laertes, and he\r\nmade me long to visit the East. He said that the Desert was “another\r\nworld,” more marvellous than this of our land and sea: it was a home\r\nand a domain, like the former; yet was it waste and boundless as the\r\nlatter. I asked about the _sands_. “Vast, beyond computation.” “And the\r\nmaterial?” “Powdered quartz, all of it. Quartz mountains, crushed, and\r\npulverized, and sifted!” The reddish hue is from the peroxide of iron.\r\nNo particle of anything like organized matter has ever been detected in\r\nits composition. The caravan-camels which drop and die daily on their hot\r\nmarch, as they have done for centuries, leave their skeletons, after the\r\nvulture’s inquest is over, to bleach upon the surface; and, in the course\r\nof a season or two, these bones must turn to an impalpable powder: but\r\nthat does not mix with the sand, or phosphate of lime would at once be\r\nfound on analyzing it.\r\n\r\nThen he spoke of the sunrise, and the glowing sunset; and of the\r\ndelicious hours of night; and of tent-life in the Desert; and of\r\nwandering Arabs, who revere the grave and silent man; and of the charms\r\nof an encampment in some green “oasis;” and then, strongest commendation\r\nof all, he said, “I am going back, among the children of the Desert!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    CONCERNING CERTAIN NATURAL PHENOMENA.—ORIGIN OF THE\r\n    DIAMOND.—FORMATION AND COLOURING OF GEMS.—INFILTRATION\r\n    OF PEBBLES.—CAUSE OF TRANSPARENCY.—INTEGRITY OF THE\r\n    FOSSIL-NODULES.—THEORY OF THE SHATTERED FLINTS.—CONCLUDING\r\n    OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charm which wins and rivets our attention in such pursuits as those\r\nof Geology or Mineralogy, is not that the phenomena which we meet with\r\nare capable of being classified, and of forming a scientific system.\r\nAll this is, no doubt, one day instructive and interesting; but it was\r\nan afterthought, the result of experiment. The first charm lay in that\r\nsilent mystery which broods over every part of creation, a veil as yet\r\nunpenetrated by Science: it lay in our instinctive consciousness that\r\nNature, in what are, perhaps, her simplest movements, still transcends\r\nall the master-pieces of Art.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, the crystalline gems. These are the most remarkable\r\nsubstances with which we are acquainted; they are also among the most\r\nsimple. Chemically speaking, the metals and gases may claim to be\r\nregarded as simpler bodies; but then it must be remembered that we do not\r\nmeet with them in nature thus unmixed. Gases vary, both in volume and\r\ncharacter, every instant; and ordinary metallic ores are penetrated and\r\ndisguised by foreign matter; whereas faultless crystals, once perfected,\r\nappear to be unalterable.\r\n\r\nSome of these, as the DIAMOND, would almost seem to be an elementary\r\nsubstance; and yet this can hardly be the actual case. The philosophical\r\naccount of a crystal, as “some substance, all the particles of which,\r\nbeing free to move, have been operated upon in the way of a chemical,\r\nperhaps an electrical change,” certainly makes against it; for, according\r\nto this definition, such “substance” is a first desideratum, without\r\nwhich we cannot have the “crystal.” Thus, oxygen and hydrogen, blended\r\ntogether in certain definite proportions, yield the fluid substance,\r\nWATER; and the “crystal” of water is ICE. In like manner, common white\r\ncarbonate of lime, and the fluor spars, whose ingredients we know, are\r\nin daily process of formation.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical idea, so accurately expressed in the above definition,\r\nis, doubtless, correct, if once we assume a past history for some\r\nsubstance, and take the crystal before us as its result. But, whether all\r\nbodies which we now meet with under the form of crystals _have, in point\r\nof fact, had such a history_, is quite another question.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is universally held to be pure CARBON crystallized. Its high\r\nrefraction indicated this to Newton long ago; and the proof has since\r\nbeen given twofold: for the diamond scales off and evaporates under\r\nintense heat, and its dust has _carbonized_ iron-filings, turning them\r\ninto steel.\r\n\r\nFurther, this carbon is supposed to be of vegetable origin; and, if so,\r\nit would seem to follow that there must have been plants, and perhaps\r\ncoal-strata, before there could be any diamonds.\r\n\r\nBut _what was the process_ actually carried out in nature? No one has\r\nhitherto succeeded in obtaining this gem, answering to the conditions of\r\na “brilliant” in water, lustre, and weight, by any attempted method,\r\nfrom the base of carbon. The French chemists have now, for some years\r\npast, been experimenting upon _boron_, by means of the voltaic battery;\r\nand they have, it seems, taken out of the crucible sundry small, pale\r\ncrystals, which are found to be nearly as hard as adamantine spar (a\r\nvariety of _corundum_); but they cannot show, as the fruit of their\r\nlabours, a diamond weighing one carat, and worth, according to the\r\ntariff, eight pounds sterling in the market of Europe. Indeed, if this\r\nboron be a mineral intermediate between carbon and silex, their gems will\r\nassuredly partake of the character of rock-crystal, a stone which has no\r\naffinity with the diamond whatever.\r\n\r\nThe process of Nature, therefore, being unknown, if indeed it ever took\r\nplace, the question fairly arises—whether diamond be a derived crystal,\r\nor itself an original type of created matter. Or it might be put thus:\r\n“If diamond be the purest form of carbon known, what is carbon then but\r\ndiamond debased?”\r\n\r\nNeither does this exhaust the argument. The ruby owns a matrix: the pearl\r\ngrows in the mother-of-pearl. What is the nature of the diamond-rock? Is\r\nit a dark conglomerate? or is it diaphanous?\r\n\r\nWe know how diamonds are obtained: how they are picked out of the\r\ncrevices of certain rocks, and washed out of the sands of certain\r\nrivers—in the Carnatic, and Brazil, and Borneo; but we do not seem to be\r\nmuch nearer to the history of their parentage.\r\n\r\nAgain, _what is_ their “crust” or coating with which they are always\r\nfound enveloped? Is it an integral part of the stone, or is it\r\nadventitious? In the best diamonds this crust is of a greenish hue.\r\n\r\nSome say that while the gem itself has _positive_ electricity, its crust\r\nshows _negative_. If this be so, the last question is answered—the crust\r\nin that case cannot be an integral part of the stone. The only absolute\r\nreason I know of for concluding the diamond to be a _derived_ substance\r\nis, that it is laminar. The Eastern lapidaries, as it is well known, will\r\nsometimes _divide_ a stone by striking it a sharp blow in the cleavage.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the most extraordinary property of the diamond, as pure\r\ncarbon, is its weight. It is fifty times the weight of refined charcoal.\r\nHow was the element of carbon condensed and inspissated thus? Was it by\r\nthe action of LIGHT? This is the vegetable analogy; as we see in the\r\ncase of all growing plants: did it hold here?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we were to inquire how oriental sapphires, including the ruby, the\r\nblue sapphire, the emerald, and the amethyst, are formed from CLAY, that\r\nclay which exists in the granite rocks, the difficulty would be nearly as\r\ngreat. We do not know at all.\r\n\r\nBut there is some satisfaction in having undoubted proof of the nature of\r\ntheir “base.” And the obvious evidence upon this point is very simple,\r\nand prior to that of chemical analysis. My own attention was first\r\ndrawn to it many years ago, in a casual remark made by a friend. We\r\nwere handling some crystals of the _white_ sapphire, a stone of little\r\nvalue. “These look very like glass,” said I. “Yes, but you may always\r\ntell them from glass by their _coldness_. Touch one with your tongue.”\r\nThen followed the inquiry. “And why is it so much colder than glass is?”\r\n“Because the ‘base’ of the sapphire is CLAY, and clay is a very cold\r\nsubstance.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to consider the question of COLOUR. In the existing\r\nvarieties of gems, we have all the colours of the _spectrum_ perpetuated\r\nand vivid.\r\n\r\nWhat is the source of these colours? And how are they blended with the\r\nsolid crystal?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no reason for doubting that the immediate source or\r\ncause of colour is the presence of some oxidized metal. All the colours\r\nwhich Nature has impressed appear, as far as we can trace them, to be\r\ndue to such a presence. Opaline tints, and those of the “cat’s eye,”\r\nare an exception; being the perceptible result of a peculiar texture\r\nand configuration; so also are the iridescent hues on a _soap-bubble_,\r\nwhich are probably caused by polarized light. But it is _a metal_ which\r\nmakes the bark of certain trees and shrubs to glisten; aided, in the case\r\nof the birch and wheat-stubble, by particles of silex. It is a metal,\r\nabsorbed from juices of the soil, which gives their tints to flowers, and\r\ntheir deep tinge to fruits. It is a metal which dyes the plumes of the\r\nking-fisher; and the gleaming scales of the dragon-fly and diamond-beetle\r\nowe their brilliancy to metallic lustre. Why should this all-pervading\r\nlaw vary in the crystals?\r\n\r\nWe know that metals proper affect crystalline forms, assuming them\r\nspontaneously; and we know that the gems have come in contact with\r\nmetals. _Iron_, whose rust is of a reddish hue, enters into many of them;\r\nand in the _red_ stones it is said to be abundant.\r\n\r\nProbably, the finer permanent tints are due to _gold_, in infinitesimal\r\nproportions. Professor Faraday has said that the ruby-tinted glass\r\ncalled “Bohemian” derives its colour from gold in a pure form, finely\r\nattenuated, and not from any chemical combination of that substance.\r\n\r\nA white diamond has far more lustre than one which is yellow or\r\nviolet-tinted. But in all the sapphires, the deeper the hue, the more\r\nbrilliant and valuable the stone. Hence the technical term for the\r\ncolour of a diamond is its _water_. In all these gems the hues (whatever\r\ntheir origin) are homogeneously united with the crystal; and the _modus\r\noperandi_ of Nature is a profound secret.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we descend in the mineralogical scale, and come to such stones as\r\nagates and jaspers, the process which has been followed seems quite\r\ncapable of being traced—for its antiquity is not so great. The colours\r\nwhich we now find in pebbles more or less opaque, though occasionally\r\nlively, exist under very different conditions from those by which they\r\nreside in the crystalline gems. It is necessary, however, to consider\r\nfirst, the origin and nature of _pebbles_ as distinguished from casual\r\nfragments of stone.\r\n\r\nThis was long held to be one of Nature’s riddles; but as soon as it was\r\nexperimentally dealt with, it met with a solution in some of its most\r\ndifficult points.\r\n\r\nIt was early decided that pebbles are _distinct formations_, complete\r\nin themselves, except in so far as they have been worn away by gradual\r\nattrition. The first difficulty was, how to account for the great\r\nhardness of many of our seaside specimens. Although for the most part\r\ninclosing an “organism,” which must have been that of some zoophyte,\r\nthey show no traces, in their present compact texture, of the soft and\r\nyielding consistency they must at that time have possessed. The matrix\r\nin which they lie, and from which they drop as the ripe nuts fall from a\r\nhazel-bush, is seldom or never of so hard a substance as are the pebbles\r\nthemselves; in many cases the difference is as great as between the teeth\r\nand gums of a living mammal.\r\n\r\nBut the evidence of the inclosed organism is conclusive as to a past\r\nhistory; and in all mixed pebbles—and ninety-nine out of a hundred of\r\nours are mixed—it is quite certain that an _impregnation_, or an actual\r\n_infiltration_, has taken place.\r\n\r\nEither a fluid menstruum, usually siliceous, must have enveloped and\r\nsaturated the animal form, or there was actual injection of chalcedony\r\nand limestone, in a soft state, into the tubes and cells of the skeleton\r\nfirst, and afterwards into the pores and crevices of the new stone.\r\nFrequently both processes have obtained. The only alternative, viz. that\r\nwhich suggests that composite pebbles, revealing in their structure\r\ndistinct traces of animal or vegetable organization, _may have been_\r\nformed thus at first, like the coloured prints in a book, I consider\r\nto be untenable. One might as readily credit a spontaneous growth of\r\nalmond-cakes or oyster-patties by some sudden spasmodic effort of our\r\npresent sea and land.\r\n\r\nImpregnation has, no doubt, been always going on.\r\n\r\nA French _savant_, M. Reaumur, above a century ago, wrote as follows:—“By\r\na coarse operation emery is reduced to powder and suspended in water\r\nfor several days; but nature may go much further than this, for the\r\nparticles which water detaches from hard stones, by simple attrition,\r\nare of an almost inconceivable degree of fineness. Water thus impregnated\r\ncontributes to the formation of pebbles by petrifying the stone, as it\r\nwere, a second time. Stones already formed, but having as yet a spongy\r\ntexture, acquire a flinty hardness by impregnation with this crystalline\r\nfluid.”[3]\r\n\r\nFrom such a source, as he supposes, has arisen the close texture of\r\nEgyptian pebbles, coloured jaspers, and even agates. If he means to\r\ninclude the _homogeneous_ agates, which are alike free from sparry\r\ncrystals, metallic scum, and all traces of organized matter, I do not\r\nagree with him. But in the case of _mixed_ chalcedonic pebbles, among\r\nwhich may be classed our pretty Isle of Wight specimens, no doubt such\r\nimpregnation took place, and was followed by a further process of\r\ninfiltration. For when the flint-nodules, _impregnated_ as above, were\r\nstill soft—soft enough we know they were to take delicate impressions of\r\nthe spines of the echinus—chalcedony, in a semi-fluid or viscous state,\r\nwould pass through the pores of the flint, because the former is the\r\nfiner substance of the two. And after such infiltration, the entire lump\r\nwould harden, resisting, for the most part, further change. And this\r\nwould be the pebble as we now find it.\r\n\r\nIn the “Geological Museum,” now open in Jermyn Street, there is a case\r\n(on the first floor) where the nature of infiltration is well shown in\r\nsome jasper-agates. It will readily be seen here that each internal layer\r\nhas been formed in succession _from without_, the centre of the pebble\r\nfilling up last. In another case (labelled “Silica”), on the opposite\r\nside of this room, are some “choanites” and “sponges” presented by the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nThose latter will be found worthy of ten minutes’ inspection, even as\r\nseen through the plate of glass which serves to protect them. They are\r\nselected, not as being the finest specimens in his cabinet, but as\r\nillustrating, each of them, a particular animal, or a peculiar _position_\r\nof one in the fossil state. They are, however, very good specimens,\r\nmuch above the average; and if any one became missing, it could never\r\nbe exactly replaced, though you should search the world over. Nature\r\ndoes not stamp the same “medal” _twice_. Any person who, after examining\r\nthese, likes to start a theory of his own to account for their forms\r\nand colours, has my full permission to do so. But one word I would say\r\nin friendly warning, seeing that theories do abound. The Chinese, that\r\nancient and wise people, have a theory that “asbestos” cloth may have\r\nbeen manufactured “of the hair of certain rats that lived in the flames\r\nof certain volcanoes.” It were monstrous to doubt it.\r\n\r\nIn my beach-rambles I have often picked up and examined globes of\r\nsandstone which were partially chalcedonized, and that by evident\r\ninfiltration. The lapidaries call these “sand-agates,” and reject them\r\nas unfit for the wheel; and so they are at present, but it would be\r\ninstructive to meet with some of them twenty years hence, after they had\r\nundergone a more confirmed treatment at the hands of Dame Nature.\r\n\r\nThe well-known specimens of “petrified wood,” common on our coasts, and\r\noccurring in some beautiful varieties of beech and acacia in the bays of\r\nSouth Devon, are a further example of infiltration; but the process here\r\nmust have been somewhat different.\r\n\r\nThe presence of metallic particles, what lapidaries term the “moss,” in\r\nmany of our agates, argues an impregnating fluid, thoroughly charged with\r\nmineral matter. In most cases this fluid was a ferruginous stream, such\r\nas may often be seen issuing from some hidden reservoir, and trickling\r\ndown the face of a cliff of gault or greensand. This tinges everything\r\nthat lies in its path with an indelible red stain; it then oozes on\r\nthrough the shingle, and reaches the verge of the sand. The nearest pool\r\nbecomes saturated between tides, and the suspended crystals of salt,\r\nwhich are of a penetrating character (as the state of your beaching-boots\r\nwill soon inform you), enter into chemical combination with the metallic\r\nrust, and help to conduct its particles into the heart of many a\r\nlimestone pebble.\r\n\r\nDark inland pebbles, on the other hand, will discharge much of the oxide\r\nwhich they have imbibed, and may be observed to brighten and improve\r\ntheir complexions after a few months’ sponging and tossing in the purer\r\nsea-water.\r\n\r\nSome of our handsomer pebbles, when cut in two, reveal blotches of metal,\r\nwhich are glossy after polishing on the wheel. This metal is occasionally\r\nnative iron. The darker varieties of “moss” contain a good deal of\r\nmanganese, and some silver.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said about impregnation, we may readily conclude\r\nthat the _colours_ found in our agate-pebbles have been chemically\r\ninwrought, and that the symmetrical _patterns_, over which these\r\ncolours are disposed, are not due to a succession of “layers,” as in\r\nthe ribbon-jaspers and Scotch pebbles, but must be referred to the\r\norganization of some extinct zoophyte, whose skeleton is preserved in the\r\nexisting fossil.\r\n\r\nThe cause of translucency, or even _transparency_, in some pebbles is, no\r\ndoubt, to be sought in their finer and more even texture, but especially\r\nin the latter quality. Sir Isaac Newton was of opinion that the opacity\r\nof certain substances is simply a result of their cross-grained\r\ncomposition. He held that in a transparent body the particles must be\r\nregularly and evenly disposed at equal intervals, so that a ray of light\r\nentering such a substance would pass steadily on, according to the known\r\nlaws of gravity and motion, meeting with no obstruction beyond that of\r\nthe homogeneous density of the medium which it had to traverse. Whereas,\r\nin opaque bodies, he supposes these constituent particles to be unevenly\r\ndisposed, and that the ray which enters at the surface is, as it were,\r\npushed about and thrust aside, and at length lost to sight.\r\n\r\nThe purity of spring-water, when undisturbed, illustrates this beautiful\r\ntheory of the great philosopher; and, among solid substances, good\r\nglass, especially plate-glass which, after fusing in the furnace, has\r\nbeen carefully run and settled in the frames. It may also be simply shown\r\nin the act of wetting or steeping certain dry substances. Thus, stout\r\nwriting-paper, owing to its cross texture, is opaque when dry; but if we\r\nimmerse a sheet of it in oil, and then hold it up to the light, we find\r\nit has become transparent. For the smooth medium thus imbibed has entered\r\nits pores, and _equalized_ the general texture.\r\n\r\nWe find also a striking argument for the probable truth of Newton’s\r\neagle-eyed conclusion in certain minerals which possess double refraction.\r\n\r\nICELAND SPAR, one of these, is perhaps the most perfectly transparent\r\nsolid with which we are acquainted. Now, Iceland Spar _transmits_ both\r\nthe rays, as we see in the twofold image which is presented to us. But\r\nTOURMALINE is opaque, even the red specimens looking almost black; and\r\nwe find that Tourmaline _absorbs_ one of the two rays of polarized\r\nlight. This singular stone polarizes a beam of light if it enter in any\r\ndirection but that of the longer axis.\r\n\r\nNo solid with which we are acquainted is absolutely transparent. And\r\nthere is no perfect _reflector_ known. The best-polished surface\r\n_absorbs nearly one-half_ of that quantity of light which strikes upon it.\r\n\r\nAs to our seaside pebbles, the most compact of them are even _visibly_\r\nporous. Cut through the hardest jasper, and polish one face till it\r\nshines like a steel mirror, and then hold it so as to reflect the light,\r\nyou will at once discern numerous minute specks or flaws on this surface,\r\nas if the point of a needle or graving-tool had been busily at work upon\r\nit. These specks have always been there. They are _air-holes_, and in the\r\ncase of a fossil-pebble were, some of them, doubtless, connected with the\r\nposition which the animal occupied just before he died. These air-holes\r\nmust have traversed this hard stone in every direction, for, cut the\r\npebble how you will, you meet with them. Others again, incomparably\r\nmore numerous, but which can scarcely be discerned without the aid of a\r\npowerful microscope, are the true _pores_ belonging to this apparently\r\nimpenetrable substance.\r\n\r\nI have found that the action of daylight tells even upon polished agates\r\nafter a time. Some of the spots and markings in the finest stones grow\r\nfainter in the course of many years. Others appear to deepen. This is, no\r\ndoubt, a change resulting from the oxygen, contained in a beam of light,\r\nacting readily upon carbon, silex, and other substances. And it furnishes\r\nan independent argument for concluding that the visible beauty of these\r\nformations, in perpetuating a coloured pattern, has been due rather to\r\nmixed _chemical_ processes than to pure crystallography.\r\n\r\nThe fossil nodules, mostly siliceous, which we find upon a sea-beach, are\r\n_integral_ specimens. It never but once happened to me to meet with what\r\nappeared to be _two_ choanites in the same pebble, and I incline now to\r\nbelieve that this was in fact _one_ choanite who had _divided_ himself\r\nafter the manner of the Luidia. But even supposing that here were,\r\nindeed, a pair of perfect animals, when it is considered that this was\r\none single instance, occurring among more than a thousand picked up by\r\nme, in which the choanites were always solitary, such an exception may be\r\nalmost said to prove the rule.\r\n\r\nThe late lamented Hugh Miller has stated the like fact concerning his\r\nMorayshire and Cromarty icthyolites. At pp. 194, 195, of his “Cruise of\r\nthe Betsy,” he remarks that “the limestone nodules take very generally\r\nthe _form_ of the fish which they inclose; they are stone coffins\r\ncarefully moulded to express the outline of the corpses lying within.”\r\nThen, after observing that the shape of the stone conforms to the\r\nattitude of the fish in every instance, he goes on to state that “the\r\n_size_ of the fish regulates that of the nodule. The coffin is generally\r\nas good a fit in size as in form; and the bulk of the nodule bears almost\r\nalways a definite proportion to the amount of animal round which it had\r\nformed.”\r\n\r\nHe then gives, in his usual clear and graphic language, the following\r\nremarkable statement, the result of direct experiment.\r\n\r\n“When a calcareous earth, mixed up with sand, clay, and other extraneous\r\nmatters, was deposited on some of the commoner molluscs of our shores,\r\nit was universally found that the mass, incoherent everywhere else,\r\nhad acquired a solidity wherever it had been penetrated by the animal\r\nmatter of the molluscs. Each animal, in proportion to its size, was found\r\nto retain, as in the fossiliferous spindles of the Old Red Sandstone,\r\nits coherent nodule around it. Here the animal matter gave solidity to\r\nthe lime in contact with it. But in the _natural_ phenomenon of the\r\nicthyolite beds, there was yet a further point, for in these the animal\r\nmatter must have possessed such _an affinity_ for the mineral, as to\r\nform, in an argillaceous compound, a centre of attraction powerful\r\nenough to draw together the lime diffused throughout the mass.”\r\n\r\nHugh Miller concludes the above passage by saying that “it still remains\r\nfor the geologic chemist to discover on what principle masses of animal\r\nmatter should form the attracting nuclei of limestone nodules.”\r\n\r\nUpon which last remark, I would suggest that the principle of the “law\r\nof definite proportions,” established by Dalton, and fully borne out\r\nby all succeeding experiments in chemistry, appears to meet the case,\r\ngeologically as well as chemically, in every respect. For such a law must\r\nof course obtain, whether the chemical ingredients be present in the\r\nforms of mineral, vegetable, or animal life; in fact, we have never known\r\nthe law to vary. It holds for the compounded elements which we term AIR\r\nand WATER; it holds for the crystals; it holds for vascular and cellular\r\ntissues; why should it fail when the further instance of a mollusc or a\r\nzoophyte is in question?\r\n\r\nI see no reason to doubt that the blood, muscle, membrane, or adipose\r\nmatter of any animal have their due respective affinities for the\r\ndifferent substances of the mineral creation.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, however, electricity, as an active cause, bears directly upon\r\nall such phenomena.\r\n\r\nI remember many years since being greatly perplexed with the _discovery_\r\n(as I then thought it) that in certain parts of the Isle of Wight, and\r\nalong the Dorsetshire coast, the rows of dark flints imbedded in the\r\nupper chalk of the cliff-ranges were all _broken_; broken _small_, so\r\nthat if one were taken out of its chalk socket it crumbled in your hand.\r\nOften and often, I turned this fact over in my mind, and sought some\r\napparent way to account for it. But I think I now see one way to account\r\nfor it; and which may perhaps be judged worthy of acceptance, until a\r\nbetter solution is hit upon. In Dr. Hook’s experiment with that once\r\ncommon household implement, the “flint and steel,” he found that the\r\n_sparks_ which “fly” upon collision taking place are minute spherules of\r\nmetal. And further, that this metal was now not _steel_ any longer, but\r\niron; the fragments struck off _having lost their polarity_ in the moment\r\nof contact with the flint.\r\n\r\nThis experiment shows that silex possesses some remarkable affinity for\r\nthe magnetic fluid, since in this case it had robbed the steel of it,\r\nfor those spherules would not answer to the magnet. May not, therefore,\r\nthe rows of flints in the cliff have attracted the lightning in severe\r\nthunderstorms, and been shivered by the blow? This would not necessarily\r\nhurl the chalk down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Arabs have a proverb which says, “Under the lamp it is dark.”\r\nCertainly, the chief mystery of every animated creature seems to reside\r\n_in its life_, and _Life_ is like a burning lamp. Once the life extinct,\r\nwe can anatomize and analyze, and arrive at many partial conclusions;\r\nbut, meanwhile, the life has departed, and we do not know what that was.\r\nThe nearest thing to its likeness is _expression_; and animals rank high\r\nin the scale of being, according as they command and impart expression.\r\nA dog or horse have a great deal; a bird some; a reptile or insect,\r\nabsolutely none to our eyes.\r\n\r\nWith these latter, however, their _habits_, while alive, take the\r\nplace of any more intelligent expression; especially some of their\r\nmore excited movements. We know by the _sound_, when a snake is angry;\r\nand as to motion, the attack of a provoked hornet is a startling thing\r\nto witness. Ordinarily speaking, however, all their habits tend to\r\nconcealment; no doubt, for the sake of safety. I believe no one ever\r\nsees the Sphynx-moth, called a “Death’s-head” (_Acherontia Atropos_), on\r\nthe wing. Yet we discern many others which, like it, fly in the hours of\r\ndusk. But this insect whirls through the air like a stone from a sling.\r\nIt has never yet, in my experience as a naturalist, been my lot to meet\r\nwith the burrowing insect called an Ant-lion. Only twice in my life have\r\nI encountered a slow-worm in the woods of Devon and the Isle of Wight.\r\nAnd to instance the case of a far commoner creature, how seldom does it\r\nhappen to any one to take the large dragon-fly behind his green leaf!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd yet the problems of inanimate matter are perhaps the most difficult\r\nto solve. They have deeply exercised philosophers in every age of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n“All things considered,” says Newton, “I think it probable that God,\r\nin the beginning, formed matter in solid, hard, impenetrable, movable\r\nparticles; of such sizes and figures, and with such other properties\r\nas most conduced to the end for which He formed them. And that these\r\nprimitive particles, being solids, are incomparably harder than any of\r\nthe sensible porous bodies compounded of them; even so hard as never to\r\nwear, or break in pieces; no other power being able to divide what God\r\nmade one in the first Creation. While these corpuscles remain entire,\r\nthey may compose bodies of one and the same matter and texture in all\r\nages; but should they wear away or break in pieces, the nature of things\r\ndepending on them would be changed. Water and earth composed of old worn\r\nparticles and fragments of particles, would not be of the same nature\r\nand texture now with water and earth composed of entire particles at the\r\nbeginning. And therefore, that Nature may be lasting, the changes of\r\ncorporeal things are to be placed only in the various separations and new\r\nassociations of these permanent corpuscles.”\r\n\r\nSo wrote the man, “Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit,” who at the age\r\nof twenty-four had already invented the Fluxional Calculus, discovered\r\nthe Decomposition of Light, and enunciated and proved, in a series of\r\nlemmas, the law of Universal Gravitation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut soft! What is this which steals upon our senses through bobbing\r\napple-blossoms at the open casement? It is the delicious, oystery smell\r\nof the Sea, as the afternoon tide runs in with a sound like that of\r\nfairy-bells upon the sand and rock and loose shingle.\r\n\r\nThat scent, and sight, and sound, are altogether irresistible. We throw\r\naside Dr. Buckland and Hugh Miller, clap on a “wide-awake,” rush down\r\nat once by the zig-zag path, and madly catch up a bunch of dripping\r\ntangle, and kick a hole in the moist sand, and presently find that our\r\n“Balmorals” are ancle-deep in the brine of a nimble wave.\r\n\r\nAnd now I descry a faint purplish hue upon the red beach which lies at\r\nthe foot of Culver. To-morrow, we will breakfast early, and hunt up a\r\nscore of pebbles before the day grows hot.\r\n\r\n[3] “Mémoires de l’Académie des Sciences.” Anno, 1721.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    PNEUMATICS AND HYDRAULICS.—POWER OF THE WIND.—POWER OF THE\r\n    WAVES, AND VELOCITY ACQUIRED BY THE WATER.—OCCASIONAL HEIGHT\r\n    OF TIDES.—TIDAL WAVE.—CURRENTS.—TIDAL PHENOMENA ON THE ISLE OF\r\n    WIGHT.—VARIATIONS IN THE COAST-LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elemental powers which are constantly at work in Nature all around\r\nus are upon a vast scale; a scale, in fact, which is immeasurable by\r\nus, except when observed under certain favourable circumstances. As our\r\npractical ideas of locomotion are immensely surpassed by the speed of the\r\nEarth’s rotation on her axis, which is at the equator rather more than\r\n1000 miles an hour, and yet far more surpassed by the rate at which she\r\nmoves in her orbit round the Sun, which exceeds 20,000 miles an hour, so\r\nalso our experience of a puff of wind on the hillside, or a dash of water\r\nin our face, when a slanting shower or the spray from a cataract salutes\r\nus, gives us no conception of the stupendous powers which are exerted\r\nwhen the sea, convulsed by a storm, rages along some unprotected coast.\r\n\r\nOnce in my life, I remember being knocked down by a blast of wind; and\r\nseveral times, as I suppose has happened to many persons, I have been\r\n_floored_ by an unexpected billow while bathing. I always made this\r\nreflection at the moment: “Its power is not known: it has floored _me_\r\neasily enough, but perhaps it would have felled an ox.”\r\n\r\nBut a wave impelled by the gale, which could take an ox off his legs,\r\nis nothing at all. What is the measure of force actually applied when a\r\nstout ship is shivered on a lee shore? No one knows. When the Clarendon,\r\nWest-Indiaman, struck on that fatal “race” off Blackgang Chine, she went\r\nutterly to pieces _within seven minutes_! Yet, what a delicate thing is\r\nAIR! What a yielding thing is WATER! But then the air and water threw her\r\n_on a lee shore_.\r\n\r\nObservations, carefully made at the right time and place, enlighten\r\nour ignorance upon all these matters. Air, delicate as it seems, when\r\ncompressed, explodes in the roar of the thunder; and water is almost\r\n_in_compressible, and therefore its blow will knock down _anything_.\r\n\r\nLet us speak first of the power of the WIND. The sands of the Desert, as\r\nhas been said, are powdered quartz and quartz is a heavy substance; but\r\nwhen a strong wind ploughs the surface of the Desert at an angle, these\r\nSands are lifted, and made to gyrate in spiral folds, and a huge column\r\nis formed—perhaps a hundred and fifty feet in height—and this monstrous\r\ntrunk is presently carried along at whirlwind speed; and if it meet a\r\nparty of travellers, they will be overwhelmed and buried.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the sand is in very minute particles; and this is\r\ntrue. But if they are, therefore, the more easy to disturb and to catch\r\nup aloft, they are all the more difficult to bind together in a spiral\r\nform, and to hurry along the desert unbroken.\r\n\r\nThe power of the wind, especially when it comes in sudden gusts, and with\r\na whirling motion, against timber-trees and the upper parts of buildings,\r\nis only too well known; on wide, exposed plains, its fury, in the early\r\npart of the year, sometimes brings destruction to everything within its\r\nrange. But it is on the open sea, where the hurricane, once let loose\r\nfrom heaven, can sweep, unchecked, perhaps for hundreds of miles, that\r\nthe latent forces of this unseen element are revealed in all their terror\r\nand majesty. For here the wind not only has free scope, but it also finds\r\nanother element, fluid but incompressible, to obey its impulse and follow\r\nin the course which it takes. If the WIND be like a wild spirit, the\r\nWATER is a mighty, irresistible body, endowed with motion by the other,\r\nand capable of any work, from the drowning of a sea-gull to the wrecking\r\nof a stately ship.\r\n\r\nThe waves which roll in from the open sea, when the tide is _making_, are\r\nthe most powerful. Fortunately, these do not reach the shore with quite\r\nthe same force which they exert at the distance of some miles from it;\r\nbut in exposed situations, their altitude and momentum are very great.\r\nThe billows of the Atlantic which break on the western coast of Ireland\r\nrun from thirty feet to fifty feet in height, and they arrive on that\r\ncoast with an impetus which has (up to a certain point) been gaining\r\nstrength, perhaps for half the time of a tide. It was this fearful onset,\r\nfrom a foe that never slumbered, which broke up and rendered useless the\r\neastern extremity of the great Submarine Electric Telegraph Cable between\r\nIreland and America.\r\n\r\nIt has now been decided that when stormy winds prevail long in one\r\ndirection, another and peculiar force is given to the waves on which\r\nthey operate. For the wind, by pressing long _on the side_ of a wave,\r\nchanges its form from that of an upright ridge (_i.e._ with _vertical_\r\naxis) to one which has a stoop or bend, sometimes of great inclination.\r\nSuch a wave will come in upon the shore with far greater momentum, for\r\nits _velocity_ has been enormously increased, while its _bulk_ is nowise\r\ndiminished. The speed which the water acquires under the influence of a\r\nprolonged sou’-wester on the coasts of Sussex and Hampshire, although\r\nthere the gale has only traversed the breadth of the Channel, is very\r\nnotable at times. At Lowestoft and at Peterhead, easterly points of land,\r\nthe danger of the winds from the North Sea is proportionally far greater,\r\nas a larger body of water has been continuously acted upon. For it must\r\nalways be remembered that a wave at sea is simply an _oscillation_ of\r\nthe water which rises and falls in that place. The identical wave does\r\nnot pass on to the shore, though it appears to do so; it is the _motion_\r\nwhich is propagated, and, as it were, handed on, like an electric shock\r\nthrough the successive plates of a battery. Now this motion _increases_\r\nwith the onward career of the gale. “Vires acquirit eundo.” And when the\r\nmass of the fluid over which the wind is blowing has once been agitated,\r\nand the equilibrium of its upper layers been thoroughly disturbed, if the\r\ncurrent of air not only continue, but wax stronger and stronger, there\r\nscarcely seems any limit to the momentum which the rolling wave may thus\r\nacquire. The arithmetic of a few facts upon this subject will, however,\r\ngive us some idea of what that momentum must be on certain occasions.\r\n\r\nIt has been found, by experiment, that the velocity imparted to an\r\nincoming wave sometimes equals _seventy feet in a second of time_. Now\r\nthis would give nearly one mile in a minute, if it were a projectile in\r\nfree space; but the case here is, of course, different, since the wave\r\nis only a portion of the mass to which it belongs, and no individual\r\nwave travels very far. Still, the amount of rush and pressure which are\r\nexerted is altogether stupendous. Probably the _breakers_, which in an\r\nenduring storm rise against a lighthouse in the open sea, are among the\r\nstrongest instances with which we are acquainted, and, next to these, I\r\nsuppose, the billows off the Cape of Good Hope. But we may take those on\r\nthe Irish coast, westward, as a well-known sample. I have often watched\r\nthese—once in a gale of wind—and I have seen, in one as yet _unbroken_\r\nwave, a body of water which I should compute roughly at two hundred tons’\r\nweight, and as having, at the moment, a velocity of not less than sixty\r\nfeet in the second, discharge itself upon the reef of rock. On such\r\noccasions, if you happen to stand on the shore, you will feel the ground\r\n_vibrate_ apparently, though the sensation is probably electrical. But\r\nlet any one consider the conditions of the wave cited above, and reckon\r\nwhat is _the force of the blow_ at the moment of impact. I have no doubt\r\nit would knock down a good strong house, if delivered against the upright\r\nface of it.\r\n\r\nOne winter, when I was at Sandown, in the Isle of Wight, a spot\r\nfrequently mentioned in these pages, I found I was _utterly unable_\r\nto traverse the bit of open road reaching from the Fort to the point\r\nwhere the lane turns off to Yaverland. Yet I had on at the time a stout\r\nCording’s waterproof, with sleeves, and a slouched hat tied under my\r\nchin, and held a powerful oaken stick in my hand to help me win my way.\r\nIn fact, it was a trial of dynamics between me and the gale, whether\r\nthis “body,” acted on by a continuous muscular force, in nearly a right\r\nline, could be propelled through that resisting medium. I am sorry to\r\nsay, it could _not_; but, in the attempt, it lost a neck-button from its\r\ncoat, and was within an ace of being blown into the hedge, like a certain\r\n“man in Thessaly, wondrous wise,” whom we have heard tell of in our\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nThis storm held on for seven or eight hours, and as the sea rose many\r\nfeet higher than usual under its influence, when the tide was well\r\nin, the strife of elements, and their combined assault upon the works\r\nof men’s hands were truly grand. A breach was made through the solid\r\ncauseway, compact long ago of clay, and gravel, and boulders of flint,\r\nand guarded seaward by dykes of timber. This breach was effected, I have\r\nno doubt, by the _stroke_ of the wave, as the sword of Roland is said\r\nto have cut through the rock in the fight of Roncesvalles. A wall of\r\nstout masonry, not above five feet in height, and supported behind by\r\nearthworks, so as to resemble an escarpment, yielded before the weight\r\nof water, as a pane of plate-glass would give way at the charge of a\r\nlocomotive engine. Some twenty yards’ length of it was rent and thrown\r\ndown. On examining this fragment afterwards, I found that the materials\r\nof the wall were solid blocks and angular bits of Wenlock limestone, and\r\nthe cement used of the strongest. I believe, however, if it had been\r\nthree times as strong a barrier, those waves would have levelled it.\r\n\r\nI subsequently witnessed in that very neighbourhood a yet more furious\r\ntempest of wind, but had no opportunity of measuring its effects.\r\n\r\nAt Eastbourne, about two years age, I made acquaintance with a phenomenon\r\nin this line which was altogether new to my experience. We had a\r\ntremendous gale late in the autumn of 1857. I cannot exactly cite the\r\nquarter from which the wind blew, as I do not accurately know the points\r\nof the compass in their bearing on the town and bay; but the storm seemed\r\nto beat in from the south-east, as it faced the Marine Esplanade. I went\r\nforth, with perhaps a score of others, to gaze upon this magnificent\r\n“encountering shock” of earth, air, and water. We were all of us drenched\r\nto the skin by the dashing spray, and occasionally well-nigh swept off\r\nour legs by the gust; but we held on stoutly, _till_ something saluted\r\nthose nearest the beach, which rendered a retreat imperative. This was\r\nnot the salt spray, nor the rattling hail neither, but a cloud of\r\n“skirmishers” in the shape of _pebbles and gravel_ from the strand below.\r\nThe sea had actually lifted the surface of the bed of beach, and whirled\r\naloft some bushels of its solid contents. A coast-guard told me next day,\r\nthat he saw a “flight” of pebbles, some of them as big as hens’ eggs, at\r\nleast thirty feet high in the air; and he added, that if the direction\r\nof the wind had changed a little, every pane of glass on the ground and\r\nfirst-floor of the Esplanade must have been shivered to atoms. As it was,\r\nof course much damage was done to windows and sashes; but not by the\r\nactual pebbles.\r\n\r\nAfter this gale had subsided, I ascertained by personal inspection that\r\nsome hundred tons’ weight of solid shingle had been moved along the shore\r\na distance of a quarter of a mile, in the space of a few hours. This was\r\nby the sidelong _drag_ of the tide.\r\n\r\nThe village of Seaford, on this same line of coast, had long been in\r\ngreat danger of being swept away by the tide. Its outworks and very\r\nstanding ground were perceptibly yielding, season after season.\r\n\r\nAbout eight years ago, the inhabitants took the alarm, and drew up a\r\nremonstrance and petition, which were duly forwarded to the authorities.\r\nProper officers were deputed to go down from London and report; and\r\nthe result of their representations was that an able engineer from\r\nhead-quarters was empowered “videre ne quid Respublica detrimenti\r\ncapiat;” or, in the modern vernacular, to see that the Queen’s lieges in\r\nSeaford suffered no wrong.\r\n\r\nThe remedy hit upon was simple and forcible; but, assuredly, it was an\r\ninstance of what is called “Hobson’s choice.” The engineer said, “There\r\nis only one thing to be done; a solid breakwater must be formed west\r\nof the town, to break the rush of the sea and divert the course of the\r\ncurrent. We will throw down a section of the chalk-cliff; that will\r\nmake a mound, on which works of masonry, if necessary, can be erected\r\nafterwards.”\r\n\r\nThis was done about two miles east of Newhaven, by firing an enormous\r\ncharge of gunpowder in chambers drilled in the limestone. I went over\r\nfrom Brighton to witness it, and the sight was a striking one, as soon\r\nas the smoke and dust consequent on the explosion had cleared away. The\r\noperation, neatly conducted with an electric battery, proved successful;\r\nand its result, in the amount of chalk thrown down on the beach, was\r\njudged sufficient for the time.\r\n\r\nBut for this “pièce de resistance,” Seaford might by this be in a fair\r\nway to furnish to future generations a gigantic specimen of a marine\r\nfossil.\r\n\r\nThe danger to Seaford arose not from storms or any casual visitations,\r\nbut from the steady continuous action of the tide encroaching on the\r\nline of coast where the town stands. Whether the chalky breakwater above\r\ndescribed will long suffice to counteract this elemental mischief may be\r\ndoubted. If after a while it should prove inadequate, the operation will\r\nhave to be repeated on a larger scale.\r\n\r\nThe height of the tides at sea is always known; and it varies little,\r\ndepending upon astronomical causes, chiefly on the attraction exercised\r\nby the moon. But on shore, and inland in certain rivers, the case is\r\nwidely different. Here the land itself, with its rocks and embankments,\r\nintroduces artificial conditions which influence the local tides in an\r\nextraordinary manner. Thus, at Chepstow, by the Castle rock, the rise\r\nof a spring-tide is sometimes as much as _sixty feet perpendicular_. In\r\nMount’s Bay, Cornwall, it is fully _forty feet_; while in the north of\r\nScotland on the coast, it does not average more than _ten_.\r\n\r\nThe tides have other variations beside this of local magnitude; and one\r\nof these, which takes place along our southern coast, is interesting and\r\nimportant, but was little known till the Admiralty surveyors went to\r\nwork. It may be briefly described as follows.\r\n\r\nAs far as Scilly Isles and the Lizard’s Point, the great tidal wave,\r\nwhich twice in every twenty-four hours flows in from the Atlantic,\r\nmaintains pretty nearly the same level on the opposite shores; and this\r\ncontinues as far as Exmouth on the Devon coast, and St. Malo on that of\r\nBrittany. But when this great wave reaches the “Needles” which form the\r\nwesterly point of the Isle of Wight, it divides into two very unequal\r\nportions. Of these, the southern and larger portion sweeps round the\r\nbase of the island, passing Freshwater and Chale and Blackgang, and\r\nthen rounding St. Catherine’s promontory and running up to Dunnose with\r\nscarcely-diminished velocity; but the northern and smaller half enters\r\nthe Solent, and owing, it is supposed, to the resistance of two shores\r\n(by _friction_) to its progress, advances but slowly, and does not arrive\r\nat Southampton Water before the other has made Dunnose and is filling\r\nSandown Bay with a _back_-stream. This causes many differences in the\r\namount of water at almost any given moment on the two sides of the Isle\r\nof Wight, north and south; and it gives rise to many curious varieties\r\nof tides, real or apparent. In one spot near Shanklin, my attention was\r\nfrequently drawn to the fact of a partial tide suddenly _flowing_, for\r\nperhaps the space of an hour, during the time of ebb.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the only “water-company” here at work, nor is the above\r\nthe only class of phenomena resulting from such agency. Beside the\r\n_tide-wave_ there is the Ocean-_current_, which is quite a distinct\r\nthing. This current is due to a branch of the Gulf-stream; and it flows\r\nhere from west to east, and from south to north. That is to say, after\r\nleaving Newfoundland, so much of it as actually reaches Britain would run\r\nup St. George’s channel northwards, and up the English channel eastwards.\r\nAnd although the velocity of this current is but trifling, yet, owing\r\nto its unceasing action in one direction, its effects are remarkable.\r\nMoreover, it is not affected by the waves; whether the sea be sleeping in\r\na calm or tossed with storms, the motion of the current is the same. The\r\nonly change as yet observed is when its waters come to the surface and\r\nhave their temperature lowered by a chill wind; for, this gulf-stream is\r\nitself a river of _warm water_, though its bottom and banks are of the\r\nsame element _cold_.\r\n\r\nThus, between tide-waves and currents, changes are going on continually\r\nboth in the volume and the physical constitution of the sea-water.\r\nAnd this, which might at first on a hasty glance look like casual and\r\nunimportant variation, when we come to consider it attentively, is found\r\nto be an arrangement fraught with wisdom and beneficence; for it insures\r\ncontinual variations of temperature, it attracts the purifying storms,\r\nrestores the elastic spring of the atmosphere, and provides for weary\r\nman a healthy tonic breeze when he rambles along the beach or scales the\r\nface of the cliff. Without the motion imparted by the tides, the sea\r\nwould probably become putrid. Now the tides depend upon the MOON; yet\r\nhow seldom do we think of her invaluable services, when we gaze upon her\r\npale face! An Italian once told me that he “loved the moon, adored the\r\nmoon, never tired of looking at the moon.” And the Padishah,[4] I have\r\nheard say, prefers “moon-faced” ladies for his soft companions; but I\r\ndoubt whether either the pensive Italian or the glittering lord of the\r\nBosphorus ever bestowed five minutes’ thought on the mighty phenomenon of\r\nthe TIDES.\r\n\r\nThere are other changes in what may be termed the tidal “high-water\r\nmark,” due to the lapse of ages, which the sea has chronicled on the face\r\nof many a shore and cliff. It is well known that the coast-line, in this\r\nand other countries, has experienced many alterations as to its level. In\r\nsome places, the ocean has apparently encroached upon the land; in many\r\nothers, it has receded. One striking _index_ of this latter, and which\r\nmay be implicitly trusted as proving the fact, occurs where the waters\r\nhave retired from their former level, and have left exposed to view the\r\nremains of an ancient _beach_. Thus, between Brighton and Ovedean, is\r\nfound what goes by the name of the “Elephant-bed,” because such fossil\r\nbones lie among the pebbles in this part of the cliff. The entire stratum\r\nundoubtedly was at one time a beach. Similar phenomena have been traced\r\nalong the coast-lines of Arbroath and Cromarty shires.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the sea has gained upon the land; undermining the friable\r\nsandstone cliffs, and, as it were, melting down the headlands, so as to\r\nchange the outline of the coast. But in these latter instances, although\r\n“terra firma” has given way, it may be doubted whether the water itself\r\nhas _risen_. Wherever it has indubitably done so, to the extent _e.g._ of\r\nsubmerging a village, I should apprehend the presence of volcanic agency.\r\n\r\n[4] Sultan, “Father of the Faithful.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    GEOLOGY LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF EARTHLY THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no strong reason for doubting that every elementary\r\nsubstance of which we have any knowledge was _separated_ at the first\r\nfrom that crude mass called “the earth,” and which, along with “the\r\nheaven,” God created in the beginning.\r\n\r\nFor, after that first assertion, we read of continued acts of\r\n“separation” by an Almighty _fiat_. Thus light is separated from\r\ndarkness; waters from waters; water from earth. And by a like analogy we\r\nmay suppose that the “firmament” or atmosphere, the lower part of which\r\nwe breathe, was also eliminated in its component gases from the primitive\r\nshapeless bulk of matter.\r\n\r\nIf we take forty-five miles as the average height of this atmosphere\r\nabove the surface of our globe, it is proportionately, like the thin rind\r\nupon an apple, or the bloom upon a peach; and may very well have come\r\nforth without any violence done to nature, or any waste of her resources,\r\nfrom the womb of the earth.\r\n\r\nOXYGEN is a gas universally diffused, for without a large supply of it\r\nhuman beings and all the mammals, birds, and reptiles, would die. But\r\noxygen is not a more _simple_ element than CARBON or SILICON; and silicon\r\nis almost as universal, for it enters largely into the composition of all\r\nknown rocks, excepting coal, limestone, and rock-salt.\r\n\r\nThen, beside silicon and carbon, there is BORON, and many others, all of\r\nwhich will combine permanently with the principal gases, and which we\r\nmay, therefore, fairly suppose did so in the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen which we breathe enters into composition with almost all known\r\nsubstances. It constitutes about one-fifth of the atmosphere, perhaps\r\neight-ninths of the water, and helps chemically to compound all forms of\r\nearth and rock, and all the metals save five. Now this proclaims at once\r\na _kindred_ element, and does not look like a substance made independent\r\nof all the others at the first. Even _potash_ and _soda_, which were long\r\ncalled “fixed alkalis,” having resisted all attempts to decompose them,\r\nyielded at last to a galvanic process, and were found to be compound;\r\noxygen, in both cases, having united itself intimately with a metallic\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, therefore, that every substance which we can handle, or\r\nof which we can recognize the presence by a chemical test, was as truly\r\na part of the chaotic Earth as was the clay or the granite. The gaseous\r\natmosphere or “firmament” was eliminated by an act of creation from\r\nthe torpid mass, the waters were drawn off and gathered together, the\r\nrocks consolidated, the metals precipitated, most of the crystals were\r\nprobably perfected by galvanic operations. But there is nothing, from\r\nthe crystallized blocks of the mountains to the salt held in solution in\r\nthe sea, from the heavy rain-cloud which darkens the sky to the gossamer\r\nfilms of vapour which fringe the outermost edge of our atmosphere,\r\nwhich was not actually present as an existing particle when the Earth,\r\n“_Mother_-Earth,” was made. And the EARTH, as we see, could very well\r\nfurnish all these concomitant and subsidiary elements, without being\r\nimpoverished at all. Indeed, as far as experiments and investigations\r\nproper have gone, we have as yet only touched the _surface_ of our\r\nglobe. The deepest mine which men have ever sunk into the bowels of the\r\nearth bears in its depth the same proportion to the earth’s radius, as\r\na _line_, or one-eighth of an inch, bears to the height of the monument\r\nat London Bridge. Some of the exposed strata of rock, allowing for the\r\n_tilting-up_ of their edges, certainly reveal a deeper sample than this;\r\nbut still, it is like the prick of a pin on the hide of a rhinoceros;\r\nit does not even penetrate the creature’s folded hide; but of what lies\r\n_within_ it tells us nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. Baily’s successful attempt at “weighing the Earth,” which, with\r\nconsummate patience and skill, he brought to a termination in his house\r\nin Tavistock Square, has established the physical fact that this planet\r\nis not “a hollow sphere,” as some persons had supposed, but _solid_,\r\nprobably to its very centre, and of considerable specific gravity. Here\r\nis a mighty mass of Matter; it may be, as Dr. Whewell has argued, the\r\n_greatest mass_ (in solid contents) in our Solar system. What do we\r\nknow of its interior construction, economy, and arrangement? Nothing,\r\nexcept that all obey the _laws_ established by the Creator, whether\r\nthose of gravitation, cohesive attraction, or chemical combination. The\r\n“statistical report” is wanting, especially in such departments as those\r\nof the Trap and Volcanic lavas.\r\n\r\nThe amount of SALT in the ocean is a circumstance which geologists have\r\nnot, I think, sufficiently considered. This salt, if precipitated,\r\nwould, it is believed, yield a solid range of mountains equal to that\r\nof the entire Himalaya. Now, mighty rivers run into the sea, as those\r\nof La Plata, Amazons, Mississippi, St. Lawrence, Orinoko, and many\r\nothers; but _none of these rivers are salt_; they are enormous bodies of\r\nfresh water. How, then, does the ocean maintain everywhere its saline\r\ncharacter unimpaired? not to ask, whence did so much salt come? There\r\nis, indeed, a hill of salt in Spain, and there are mines of rock-salt\r\nin Poland and Hungary; but the _effort_ which was made, so to speak,\r\nwhen the proportion now existing in the ocean was squeezed out of the\r\nhuge terrestrial sponge, must far have exceeded that of any subsequent\r\naddition or contribution.\r\n\r\nThe ocean itself, as _girding_ this globe, is a prodigious mass of water,\r\nindeed. But, if we remember the size of the globe itself, as given by\r\nits diameter, Ocean appears like a rain-pond. For, if we call its average\r\ndepth five miles—and it cannot be more than this, may be much less—such\r\na watery envelope would be represented in its proportion to the solid\r\nsphere which it surrounds, by a coating of varnish of the thickness of\r\nthis paper lying on a globe which is twenty feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe COAL-MEASURES are also a remarkable item in the list of substances\r\nmet with in beds and ranges, and claiming to be considered as rocks—for\r\nthe coal is a _petrifaction_, perhaps a partial _crystallization_—but due\r\nto the deposition of vegetable matter, subjected afterwards to enormous\r\nhydrostatic pressure. We have no true estimate of their amount as yet,\r\nfor fresh mines are being continually discovered; but here seems to\r\nconsist the chief proportion of CARBON, as developed in this part of the\r\nvisible creation.\r\n\r\nCHALK constitutes one-eighth part of the crust of this globe. The mass\r\nof this must have been thrown up _at once_, when the atmosphere was\r\neliminated, and the waters separated, and the sphere became condensed\r\nand solid. It is a “carbonate of lime” in its chemical description, and\r\nthere is abundance of the limestone-rock all over the world; but it is\r\nvery difficult to extract from this, in any quantity, the soft, friable,\r\nslightly unctuous mineral which goes by the name of chalk (Latin, “calx”).\r\n\r\nThe METALS exist in the rocks, generally some distance down in the\r\nearth’s interior. Their amount, in some instances, is very great indeed.\r\nThe only one which is rarely met with on our globe, and then in small\r\ngrains, is the NATIVE IRON, _i.e._ iron in its _pure_ state. This want,\r\nhowever, could not have been recognized if we had not happened to find\r\nthe substance in question in those blocks of meteoric iron, and in the\r\nsmall meteoric stones which have, from time to time, fallen to the\r\nsurface of the earth during atmospheric storms, and, probably, owing to\r\nastronomical disturbances. For, of the iron, in its mixed conditions\r\nof different ores, we have an abundant supply. It is a singular fact,\r\nthat the _native gold_, both in pure grains or flakes, and in solid\r\n“nuggets,” appears now to be the more prevalent form of that ponderous\r\nand imperishable substance. The ranges of quartz-rock in many chains of\r\nmountains are certainly thickly sown with seeds and nodules of fine gold.\r\n\r\nI may mention here, as an interesting circumstance to mineralogists and\r\ncollectors of fossil pebbles, that the “native iron,” which is so scarce\r\non the surface of the ground, is met with, from time to time, along with\r\n_manganese_, in the heart of siliceous pebbles. But I have never seen it\r\nwhere there is not the presence of some animal organism.\r\n\r\nNow all these _solids_, gold, iron, chalk, coal, salt—and I select\r\nincongruous items on purpose—are as truly portions of the earth’s mass\r\nas are the granite and slate, the sandstones and clays. And _so are\r\nalso_ the flowing waters and the suspended clouds; and _so are also_ the\r\ncomponent elements of these—oxygen, hydrogen, and the rest. It is, all\r\nof it, MATTER; it all obeys the law of gravitation, and it needs just as\r\nmuch to be taken into account, in a geological scheme or system, as the\r\nupheaving of granite rocks, the flux of lavas, or the icthyolite beds\r\namidst the semi-crystalline ranges of the Old Red Sandstone formation.\r\n\r\nConsequently I have found, as has partly I trust been shown in the\r\npreceding pages, that even to handle and pronounce upon a pebble, such\r\nan one as we can pick up on the sea-shore any summer’s day, _all these\r\nelements_ must be taken into the account.\r\n\r\nIn a “moss-agate,” for instance, I discover—\r\n\r\n_First._ A sandy cuticle, which we will rub off, as it is like the dust\r\non your drawing-room table, a real thing, but out of place.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ Siliceous matter.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ A purer form of this in chalcedony.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly._ The “moss,” which is a metal proper, tinged by _oxidation_.\r\n[N.B. Here is oxygen inside a pebble!]\r\n\r\n_Fifthly._ The whole or a part of some extinct animal’s petrified\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n_Sixthly._ One thing more, _sometimes_ a drop of water.\r\n\r\n_Seventhly and lastly._ Air, permeating the stone in fine pores and\r\nchannels, one of the largest of which was in some cases a breathing-hole\r\nused by the zoophyte before he drew his last gasp.\r\n\r\nWho shall therefore say that a PEBBLE from the sea-shore has nothing\r\nremarkable in it or about it, merely because the passing schoolboy can\r\npick it up if he pleases, and, without looking at it for a moment, can\r\nfling it at the head of a gull, or dash it to atoms against a larger\r\nstone? It is a microcosm in itself; and if it lead us on to further\r\ninquiry and patient thought, it will amply repay our trouble, though we\r\n_have_ loitered away a summer morn or an autumn evening among the Pebbles\r\nof the Beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    GUESSES AT THE PROBABLE FEATURES OF A PAST SCENE.—WHAT WAS THE\r\n    EARTH’S _COMMENCING_ ROTATION.—LAW OF THE TIDES AT SUCH A TIME,\r\n    AND CORRESPONDING ACTION OF THE SEA UPON THE LAND.—ORIGINAL\r\n    CHARACTER OF THESE FOSSIL FORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the apparent scope or tendency of some of the\r\ngeological theories which are rife in the present day, no person who has\r\nreally considered the subject in its principal bearings has any doubt\r\nthat the surface of our globe, both as to the land and the water, was\r\nonce very different from what it is now. All sound argument must allow\r\nthis to be possible: all careful investigation pronounces it to be the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThere are potent “menstrua” and mighty furnaces in the laboratory of\r\nNature; and while the actual _amount_ of MATTER in existence has, we\r\nsuppose, never varied since the original creative act which gave birth to\r\n“the heaven and the earth,” the conditions, sensible or chemical, under\r\nwhich that matter presents itself have altered from century to century\r\nand from moment to moment.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to deem otherwise, if we believe that the “laws” which\r\nare established now in this creation were established then.\r\n\r\nLet us take, for instance, the law of Universal Gravitation, that law by\r\nwhich the heavenly bodies move in their orbits, and a seconds’ pendulum\r\nmeasures _time_ at the surface of our Earth.\r\n\r\nWe feel assured that this law has never varied; but it is almost equally\r\ncertain that it must have _begun_ to operate _under different conditions_\r\nfrom those which obtain at this day.\r\n\r\nNewton, who always maintained that the commencing axillary movement of\r\nthe Earth was due to an impulse from the hand of the Creator when He\r\nlaunched it into space,[5] and who declared that without this he could in\r\nno way account for its having rotatory motion at all, was nevertheless\r\nwilling to allow that the time occupied in the first rotation may not\r\nhave been, as now, twenty-four hours, but possibly an entire year. And\r\nas the Earth, once projected, would fulfil, according to the Law of\r\nGravity, the conditions of “a body falling through space,” we find that\r\ntaking the nth term (2_n_-1) of the arithmetical series … 1. 3. 5. 7. …\r\n(2_n_-1) … where the successive terms represent the _velocities_ acquired\r\nin successive annual periods, about 183 such terms must elapse before\r\n365 rotations would be accomplished within the space of one year, or,\r\nin other words, the rotation of the earth be _diurnal_, as at present.\r\nThis point of speed once reached, the centrifugal and centripetal forces\r\nbalanced one another, and the axillary movement became steady.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the above hypothesis, the assuming of one year for the\r\nfirst period is arbitrary; it may have been more, it may have been less;\r\nbut within certain limits there is no absolute reason for supposing that\r\nit was a span of twenty-four hours, as now. _Revelation_ nowhere asserts\r\nsuch a dogma.\r\n\r\n_Supposing_, then, amid confessed ignorance as to how the fact stood,\r\nthat the Earth’s early times of rotation were far longer than now, and\r\ntaking, say, _one year_ as the first period, how would this influence\r\nother features in a scene which has now long gone by? How would it\r\ninfluence the Tides of the Ocean?\r\n\r\nAssuming a correspondingly slow motion of the Moon in her orbit, we\r\nshould, it seems, have in the lapse of the first year _one_ rotation\r\nof the Earth and _two Tides_ of the Ocean; in the second year, _three_\r\nrotations of the Earth and _six Tides_ answering to them; and so on.\r\n\r\nNow these flowing Tides would, in fact, have been vast _inundations_,\r\nthe sea rising steadily for many months together; and in like manner the\r\nprolonged ebb which followed upon each flood would have given rise to a\r\n_subsidence_ and to the deposition of such particles of mud, lime, silex,\r\n&c., as the waters then held in solution after their visiting the higher\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we see at once, without going further, that the agency exerted\r\nby the ocean in ancient times may probably have been different from and\r\ngreater than any with which we are now actually acquainted, save in the\r\naccount given to us, in the inspired Record, of the Deluge in the days of\r\nNoah.\r\n\r\nWhen such mighty agencies were in operation, it is not unreasonable to\r\nsuppose that great changes took place in the way of partial extinction of\r\nanimal life, and the substitution of new forms to fill up the apparent\r\ngap left by the perishing creatures. The contents of the upper chalk, of\r\nthe greensand, gault, and sandstones, as has already been observed, point\r\nto such revolutions and cycles in the history of animated nature.\r\n\r\nMAN, who is himself an evident exception to all this, may perhaps, _as_\r\nan exception, be said to prove that such had been the rule. For, it must\r\nbe remembered, _all_ the creatures were pre-Adamitic. Not only those\r\nvast saurians and mammals, whose fossil remains we have exhumed, and\r\ncannot contemplate without wonder, were prior to our race in their actual\r\npossession of the domain of the earth’s surface, but every bird, reptile,\r\nfish, and zoophyte were certainly made before the man. Now, as the man\r\ncame last in order, but first in dignity, created in his Maker’s image,\r\nand endowed with dominion over all the works of His hand, there was no\r\nlonger place or argument for extinction, substitution, or change, among\r\nthe creatures. _Death_ was excluded, and could not enter into the world,\r\nunless by a moral delinquency of the chiefest creature.\r\n\r\nBut already it is probable, although he perhaps knew it not, Man stood,\r\neven in the day of his innocence and happiness, in the midst indeed of a\r\nblooming creation, but upon the crust of a fossil world.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we know from Scripture that minerals find metals abounded;\r\nso that the presence of these near the Earth’s surface ought not to be\r\nreferred (as by some they have been) to the epoch of Noah’s Deluge. “Gold\r\nand bdellium and the onyx-stone” were already in the “land of Havilah;”\r\nand Tubal-Cain was “an artificer in brass and iron,” which must therefore\r\nhave been exposed in veins of the upper rocks.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Earth already showed her nuggets of gold and lumps of onyx,\r\nit is not likely that she was deficient in beautiful fossils. Certainly,\r\nsuch substances as manganese and native iron did not find their way into\r\nthe heart of siliceous pebbles in _modern_ times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it by no means follows from the above, that all these fossil forms\r\nbelonged to creatures whose species are wholly extinct. Indeed, in some\r\ninstances, this cannot be allowed for a moment. Probably, the “choanite”\r\nis extinct. I doubt whether the “ventriculite” be so. Dr. Mantell was\r\npleased to assume that this last-mentioned zoophyte _grew_—like one of\r\nthe “mushroom” class of plants—rooted to one spot. There is no evidence\r\nfor this whatever, and my impression leans another way. In the class of\r\nmarine “Acrita” termed _Acalephæ_, there is a family which bears the\r\nname of _Rhizostoma_. These animals are composed mainly of a large,\r\nmushroom-shaped, gelatinous disc, and of a supporting central pedicle.\r\nIn structure and function this latter organ much resembles the root of a\r\nplant; and, no doubt, it absorbs nourishment by seizing upon the minute\r\nanimalculæ which abound in the water where the “rhizostome” is floating\r\nabout. The entire animal is very like a toadstool, or “agaricus,” in\r\nform; but for all that, he does not grow, as a plant, in one spot, but\r\nis always sailing about by means of his large disc above-mentioned.\r\nHis general appearance closely resembles that of a “ventriculite” from\r\nthe flint; and I think it a probable guess to assign them to the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe “branching alcyonite,” on the other hand, did, I imagine, grow, like\r\na Coral or “Encrinite,” in one place; and I suppose it was much like an\r\nice-plant in form, but that it had the power of drawing back at will all\r\nits branches and suckers—which were, in fact, the creature’s arms and\r\ntentacles—into the root or bulb which formed its base. The “sponges,” a\r\nlarge family, we know are not extinct; and the conformation of the living\r\nindividuals fully bears out all the marvels which have been predicated of\r\nthe fossil animal. I have handled these creatures, fresh from the sea,\r\nat Brighton; and I had an unpleasant consciousness, while holding one in\r\nmy hand, that the round, greenish, jelly-like bush was only his _house_;\r\nbut that the gummy fluid, which held possession of it after squirting\r\nout the sea-water, was the individual himself, though independent of the\r\naccessories of bone and muscle. This kind of “sponge” floats about: there\r\nis another, well-known among submerged rocks, which is fixed, and grows.\r\nI believe the fossil specimens to have belonged to the migratory class.\r\n\r\nI once picked up, near Hove, a pebble which contained a fragment of the\r\nlungs of a tortoise; the elevated ridges, and depressed pulmonary cells,\r\nappeared to have left their peculiar structure in the flint. I have\r\nmislaid this specimen, and so cannot give a sketch of it here.\r\n\r\nThe “holothurida,” or “sea-cucumber,” is found occasionally in the Isle\r\nof Wight, beautifully fossilized. A specimen was shown to me, from the\r\nbeach near Chale; it was a _variety_, but unquestionably of this class of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nA fossil, figured in one of the “chromo-plates” to this volume, has\r\nobtained the name of a “troglodyte;” I do not know why. I suspect it was\r\none of the “asteridæ” when alive, but that in the death-struggle, the\r\nlong arms collapsed and twisted together.\r\n\r\nI have frequently found what I believe to have been some such organ as\r\nthe stomach of a star-fish in the centre of hard pebbles. The form was\r\nalways pentagonal, like the corolla of certain flowers pressed flat.\r\n\r\nThe “myriapod,” depicted in Plate V., I should at once conclude to have\r\nbeen a marine insect, answering to some of our “scolopendridæ,” if the\r\n_head_ were not lacking. But since the back or spine in this fossil is\r\nall in one piece, and there are no lateral plates or divisions for the\r\nseveral pairs of feelers, it may be, in accordance with such a frame,\r\nthat the head fitted on without the apparent juncture of a neck; and if\r\nso, this may be an entire insect. It is right however to add, that I feel\r\nsome doubts about this.\r\n\r\nThe Plate VI. contains a figure of a fossil to which I have attached the\r\nname of “Spindle-choanite.” In fact, the specimen, until cut in twain,\r\nwas fusiform; and, I have no doubt, a complete animal.\r\n\r\nThe choanite from Eastbourne, _uncut_, Pl. IV., portrays a creature who,\r\nI think, expired in a vehement struggle. This would keep him on the\r\nsurface of the siliceous flood; and it would harden, for the most part,\r\nbeneath him, leaving his limbs sprawled out on the top of the pebble, as\r\nnow seen. The beautiful “pyriform” specimen, Pl. VI., shows a similar\r\nstruggle, amidst liquid agate and manganese. In the large Actinia, or\r\n“star-choanite,” portrayed in the frontispiece, the happy animal died\r\nquite quietly; and that is why his fossil mummy is of such a noble size\r\nand development.\r\n\r\nThe figure called “Nondescript,” Pl. IV., I do not think represents any\r\ncomplete animal, but a part of the organization of one. I have traced\r\nits likeness, in the “Animal Kingdom,” by T. Rymer Jones; and think it\r\nnot improvable that a woodcut at p. 364 of that most interesting volume\r\ndepicts, in the _arms_ of one of the “Brachiopoda,” in that “calcareous\r\nloop” with its curved “crura,” the exact structure which, in the living\r\nanimal, served to open or shut the bivalve shell, but in the fossil\r\nspecimen looks like a miniature-painting on ivory, to perpetuate some\r\ncurious organism in the liveliest colours of the pallet. “Terebratula\r\nChilensis” is Mr. Rymer Jones’s animal; and in the very vicinity where\r\nI found my fossil in question, I have since obtained, in a flint pebble\r\nfrom the cliff, a beautifully petrified “Pecten” (same species of shell)\r\nin agate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI might multiply remarks and instances such as these; but it is not\r\nneeded. Every one will form their own opinion, in collecting fossil\r\npebbles, as to what the _originals_ were; but I think they will generally\r\nagree with me, that while our living individuals differ in many points,\r\nstill we have mostly types of the same species actually existing in our\r\npresent seas.\r\n\r\nWhat all connoisseurs, and even amateurs, should do, is to preserve\r\nevery remarkable specimen they may obtain, along with an accurate note\r\nof where they got it. It is a great pity that, among so many persons\r\nwho have at once discernment and a liking for this branch of Mineralogy,\r\nthere are so few who will be at the trouble of what lawyers call “taking\r\nminutes” of the evidence which comes before them in the course of the\r\npursuit. I have looked over several fair enough collections made by\r\namateurs; but, with one exception, I never knew an instance in which\r\nthe collector could tell me, with any degree of certainty, from what\r\nparticular beach he had gathered this or that specimen. Of course, when\r\na scientific investigation is proposed, such omission renders the most\r\nvaluable part of the collection comparatively useless. For the locality\r\nis all-important. A pebble may thus be always traced to its geological\r\n“home” or birthplace. It can only have had one of three sources: either\r\nit was first dropped _here_, where you find it; or, it is a “travelled”\r\npebble, having come round from some distant beach; or, it is an offering\r\nfrom the deep sea. The latter case is of exceedingly rare occurrence, and\r\nneed hardly be taken into account; nevertheless, for truth’s sake, and to\r\ninclude all possible varieties, I cite it here.\r\n\r\nA genuine deep-sea pebble is a waif which I have only twice, as yet,\r\nmet with in my sea-side experience. One of these was, I think, fished up\r\nin a dredging-net; the other was thrown on the beach during a storm. In\r\nboth instances, the fossil was a “choanite,” and bore the marks of having\r\nbeen washed out of a limestone rock. The age of such fossil could not\r\nhave been less than 4000 years, the date of Noah’s deluge, for obvious\r\nreasons; but it may have been considerably greater.\r\n\r\nIf there were any known method of softening these pebbles to a\r\nconsistency like that of melted glue, we might learn something concerning\r\ntheir past history; but I am not aware of the existence of any such\r\nprocess at present. _Silex_, once hardened into the condition in which\r\nwe meet with it, is a most intractable substance to deal with; and the\r\nvery fact of its having at one time been viscous, renders it highly\r\nimprobable that, in the course of nature, its texture will ever assume a\r\nplastic character again. Moreover, while the majority of our flints are\r\nconcretions, there are some which are semi-crystalline. These latter,\r\nit is evident, cannot now advance to the stage of perfect crystals; but\r\nneither can they retrograde: the next change which awaits so hard a\r\nsubstance must be, to crumble away.\r\n\r\nSometimes, on our beaches, hollow globes of flint are picked up,\r\nwhich, when you break them open, are found to be full of a white,\r\npowdery substance, like the chemist’s magnesia. This is much the same\r\nas the “rock-milk” of mineralogists, a very fine deposition of lime,\r\noccasionally met with in beds of the chalk strata, and considered to be\r\na result of some filtering process, when the water, after being long\r\npent up, had escaped by small crevices. But in the flint-globes no such\r\nstraining can have taken place; and in sundry specimens which I have\r\nexamined, I generally came to the conclusion that some conchiferous\r\nanimal had been inclosed in the nodule, and his shell had afterwards\r\nbroken and been pulverized. Sometimes I found within the “rock-milk” a\r\ndark-brown, carbonaceous spot; this would be the creature’s body, as Dr.\r\nMantell supposes of his “molluskite.” The cavity is never quite filled\r\nup. I imagine many of these “powder-horns” to be altogether modern in\r\ntheir date.\r\n\r\nA much more curious phenomenon than the above occurs from time to time\r\nin solid agate-pebbles, which, when picked up, are found to contain in a\r\ncentral chamber, visible to the eye, a drop of water. These are scarce,\r\nand fetch a high price at the museums. As much as twenty pounds has been\r\nmore than once given for an undoubted specimen. How the above-mentioned\r\nsingular effect was arrived at, has, I believe, never been explained; at\r\nleast, not so as to satisfy a close reasoner. The same _lusus naturæ_\r\nis met with, I think more frequently, in rock-crystal and in the dark\r\nfluor-spars.\r\n\r\nThe last apparent animal organism which I shall notice, as having more\r\nthan once occurred to me as a _possible_ explanation of the patterns\r\ndisclosed in certain sections of agate-pebbles, is that of some\r\ncreature’s “ovary.” The eggs of the whelk, and those of the cuttle-fish,\r\nare deposited in clusters, like some of the “grapes” on sea-weed. I have\r\nfound, in some of the Isle of Wight pebbles, a conformation closely\r\nresembling this, but on a much smaller scale. That the original substance\r\nwas part of an animal, I have no doubt whatever; and the arrangement of\r\nthe lobes or spherules, composing the mass, more resembles that of the\r\nspawn of the above-named fishes than anything else which I am acquainted\r\nwith. Still, resemblance is not identity. The thing may be only a curious\r\ncoincidence, resulting from some unexplained freak of nature; as when\r\nshe carved the profile of Napoleon’s face in the outline of a part of\r\nMont Blanc, and also (quite as distinctly) in that of a hill which\r\noverlooks the town of Belfast.\r\n\r\n[5] See his Letter to Dr. Burnet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES TO THE CHROMO-PLATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the frontispiece is represented the polished section of a pebble which\r\nthe author picked up on the beach at Bonchurch, in the Isle of Wight.\r\nThis is an unusually large and perfect specimen, the body of the Choanite\r\nlying nearly central. The pebble contains one or two blotches of _native\r\niron_. The “cuticle” is uninjured.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE I.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.
